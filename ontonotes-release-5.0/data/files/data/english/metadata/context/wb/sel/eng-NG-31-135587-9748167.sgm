In Java, the general term for mapping key to value is the interface
&quot;Map&quot;, which can be implemented as HashMap or TreeMap etc. The
single term implies both the data structure and the accompanying
methods for changing the contents and performing a lookup.
Unfortunately the word &quot;map&quot; means something entirely different
outside C++ and Java:
- Lisp: Applying function to each element of a sequence.
- Geography: Diagram showing where places are in relation to each other.
Other terms are:
- &quot;associative array&quot; (seems to be the preferred term in WikiPedia,
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array &gt;
but I don't like it because it seems to imply that it's implemented
to look like an array)
- &quot;mapping&quot;, &quot;finite map&quot; (similar problems as with &quot;map&quot;)
- &quot;hash&quot; (unfortuately seems to imply implementation as a hashtable)
- &quot;dictionary&quot; (means something completely different to most people)
- &quot;lookup table&quot; (sounds more like something that uses linear
search rather than more efficient hash or tree search, and
seems to refer to the data alone without the accompanying methods)
- &quot;index&quot; (means something rather different to most people)
- &quot;index file&quot; (sounds just like &quot;index&quot; except to database experts)

Does anybody have a better term to suggest to keep it
language-neutral (not specific to Java or Perl or PHP) and not
confusing/misleading to novices? I'm thinking of &quot;associative map&quot;,
but I'm not totally comfortable with it.

All these meanings are variations the same meaning of the term &quot;map&quot;:
having two sets of items and some sort of relation between the items in
the sets that defines which elements in one set correspond to which
elements in the other set.

In Java and C++ (and Perl and awk and ...), the data structure contains
both sets and it also contains the definition of the relationship
between them.  So, it's a more specific use, but it's still a map.

In Lisp, the term &quot;map&quot; is used as a verb, but it is still used in this
sense, because you have an input list and an output list.  Both of the
lists can be viewed as sets, and the function you're applying is the
definition of the relationship.

In geography, one set is physical (usually two-dimensional) space, and
the other set is some sort of quality or quantity or attribute associated
with that point in space.  For example, in an elevation map, the set of
points in 2-D space has a relationship with elevation.

My point here is not that all the usages of the word &quot;map&quot; are the same.
They're not the same.  But they're not entirely different, and I would
argue that the similarities are greater than the differences.

So, I guess what I'm wondering is what's so wrong with &quot;map&quot;?  If it's
necessary for a term to be completely unambiguous in the broadest
possible context, then I guess &quot;map&quot; isn't a perfect term, but we don't
really use language like that because things would get impractically
wordy if we did.

I don't mind this term at all.  I just look at this as a definition by
analogy.  Everyone knows (well, programmers do at least) what an array is,
and a traditional array has the restriction that indexes must be integers.
An associative array behaves like an array but opens up the restriction
on the keys to allow any set on which you can compare any two elements
for equality.  (Or at least something like that.  Some implementations
only allow strings as keys.  But the interesting part is that it allows
certain things which don't satisfy all the properties of integers.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - &quot;mapping&quot;, &quot;finite map&quot; (similar problems as with &quot;map&quot;)
">

I agree that these terms are just minor variations on &quot;map&quot;, so they
aren't much better (or worse) than it as a term.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - &quot;hash&quot; (unfortuately seems to imply implementation as a hashtable)
">

Yes, it is a bit of a misnomer because it does imply a certain
implementation.  So it's inaccurate, but on the other hand, it is
probably a pretty good term if your goal is to get the point across.
Language often endorses (and canonicalizes as standard usage) terms
that are not accurate but have a close relationship to the actual
concept desired.  For example, the phrase &quot;the crown&quot; is often used
to mean &quot;the king&quot; (or &quot;the queen&quot;, or royalty in general) even though
a crown itself is just a physical object.  The word takes on a broader
meaning.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - &quot;dictionary&quot; (means something completely different to most people)
">

Yes, although it's not such a bad term as terms made through analogy go.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - &quot;lookup table&quot; (sounds more like something that uses linear
&gt;     search rather than more efficient hash or tree search, and

I agree.  This term is not very good for this purpose.  It means too
many different things.  To me, it implies a technique for implementing
software where you take a function which can be defined with an
algorithm and instead you define it by enumerating all the inputs and
outputs to the algorithm.  For example, supposing you have a robot that
can travel one of 12 directions, and you want to convert the angle it's
traveling into a vector, you could either compute sines and cosines at
runtime, or you could just pre-compute all 12 possible answers and store
them in a lookup table.  (And the lookup table could use an array with
integer indices if you store the angles as integers.)

So, to me, lookup table is something more akin to memoization, except
that the set of computations is known before they're ever used.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - &quot;index&quot; (means something rather different to most people)
&gt; - &quot;index file&quot; (sounds just like &quot;index&quot; except to database experts)

I agree that these have so many meanings that it's hard to be unambiguous
when using them.

&quot;Set of key/value pairs&quot; is unambiguous and easily understood, but
it's a bit wordy.  However, in practice that terms seems to get used a
lot to clarify things when other terms cause confusion.  Personally, I
think that of the terms in common usage, &quot;associative array&quot; is the
best because it's clear and unambiguous, and while it is a bit of a

&quot;Associative array&quot; is good.  But how about &quot;keyed array&quot;?

I hate 'hash' and 'hash map', and don't care much for 'dictionary' either.

May I suggest the obvious, key/value map, or, if you want a more
compact term, a KV map.  It covers the key (you should excuse the
expression) features - the map is a function from one space to
another, the two being discordant, with one space being what you
want (the value) and the other what you have (the key).

As an alternative that will baffle the average programmer call it
a signification set (a sign set would be more compact and more
accurate, but programmers would automatically interpret &quot;sign&quot; as
numeric sign). What we have is a set of signs with the key being
the signifier and the value being the signified.  The trick is,
given the signifier (the key), find the sign that connects the
signifier to the signified (the value).

'Dictionary' seems pretty language neutral to me.  The meaning also
seems very clear, especially to computer science people.  Of course,
dictionary has implied uniqueness which is not always the case with
key value lookups.

The name does not seem very important to me.  I think that the names
chosen for the implementation should fit the project and the names for
the abstract data types should be clearly documented.

The c.l.m folks may have some ideas (as used in their own languages,
perhaps). FWIW I would call all of these mappings from a source set to
a result set. Mapping seems to me to be more general. For example, y =
square(x) is a mapping whether 'square' is an array or a function.

When I saw your question I thought 'associative array' as that is the
most familiar term.

Of the comments you've already received 'keyed array' from Frank
Swarbrick was a new one to me but immediately conveyed the thought.

Someone else said that a dictionary was familiar to IT folk. I think,
though, that Database people might think of a data dictionary.

How do you want to use the term? Is it for a language or library, or
is it for communication with humans?

Interestingly, human-language dictionaries vary according to whether
they have unique keys or not.  I would say the majority of them follow
a system where a head word appears twice if the two entries have
unrelated etymologies (i.e. are truly homonyms, which means that the
identical spellings are essentially an accident), but there are
dictionaries that list every spelling only once, merging the entries
for homonyms together under one head word, even though they might
subdivide the entry within itself.

The reason I find this interesting is that you can do the same thing
with an associative array:  if you have an associative array implementation
which does not support multiples of the same key, you can store a list
as the value and achieve the same effect.  The functionality you get is
exactly the same; it's just that one way or the other might be more or
less convenient for certain purposes.

And the relevance of that for this discussion is that both regular
human-language dictionaries and computer-science dictionaries have in
common that either form is allowed.  Which to my mind makes it a fairly
good analogy.

And speaking of database terminology, this set of key/values is a
relation.

Map and mapping have similar meaning in mathematics, a mapping from
one set to another set is a relation, and also commonly called a
function.

All of this is jargon, so trying to find one term to map(stand in for)
all of these similar words and phrases is a real challenge.

I would suggest when you go to use the term you finally choose, you
put the term in context. Provide a brief definition where it is first
used in the document, and if possible, a more detailed description
later (somewhere in the body of the document, in a sidebar, or in an
appendix/glossary/dictionary).

&gt;&gt; but I'm not totally comfortable with it.

&gt; The c.l.m folks may have some ideas (as used in their own languages,
&gt; perhaps). FWIW I would call all of these mappings from a source set to
&gt; a result set. Mapping seems to me to be more general. For example, y =
&gt; square(x) is a mapping whether 'square' is an array or a function.

&gt; When I saw your question I thought 'associative array' as that is the
&gt; most familiar term.

&gt; Of the comments you've already received 'keyed array' from Frank
&gt; Swarbrick was a new one to me but immediately conveyed the thought.

&gt; Someone else said that a dictionary was familiar to IT folk. I think,
&gt; though, that Database people might think of a data dictionary.

&gt; How do you want to use the term? Is it for a language or library, or
&gt; is it for communication with humans?
">

my case, I have usually used 'hash' and 'dictionary'.
hash, for when I am using a hash table.
dictionary, for when it is less clear as to the details (say, a binary
tree).
object, has also been used, but typically only languages of mine using
prototype OO (where an object and a dictionary are essentially analogous).

Sorry for not answering the original post, I couln't find it in c.l.m.

I think you exaggerate the difference between different meanings of the
term &quot;map&quot; or &quot;mapping&quot;. The &quot;mathematical&quot; definition of mapping explains
very naturally the &quot;non-mathematical&quot; uses of the term:

In geography, a map (a piece of paper, for example) is a &quot;mathematical&quot;
mapping from a point on the paper to the corresponding point in the target
space (the surface of earth, for example).

The lisp map really maps a list to another, using a function to map each
element to a new element. Again we are talking about &quot;mathematical&quot;
mapping.

Hash and dictionary are just special cases of maps:

A hash is a mapping from an object to its hash code, designed to
distribute as well as possible given the very restricted target set.

A dictionary is a mapping from an object (word) to its &quot;translation&quot; or
&quot;explanation&quot;.

Mapping can be used to explain a lot of things (mathematics and FP are
&quot;powerful&quot;). For example a list is a mapping from a non-negative integer
to an object.

An index (of a book) is a list of term-page pairs. So while index can be
explained using the term mapping, it is so different we may forget it
here.

Conclusion: map is a good term for a key-value data structure.

A minor correction: the pairs consist of a term and a list of page
numbers. And the pairs are sorted by the term so the index can be

&gt; All these meanings are variations the same meaning of the term &quot;map&quot;:
&gt; having two sets of items and some sort of relation between the items in
&gt; the sets that defines which elements in one set correspond to which
&gt; elements in the other set.

Except in Java the word means a data store and algorithm that
produces a single value per key request, whereas the Lisp meaning
is all data processed en masse in a particular sequence, no random
access at all, and in geography it's a gestalt view where the
*user* has the burden of actually doing the lookups manually by
visual processing, and where a whole lot of relationships between
different items at the same level are displayed simultaeously.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In Java and C++ (and Perl and awk and ...), the data structure
&gt; contains both sets and it also contains the definition of the
&gt; relationship between them.

The *range* isn't a set, it's a multi-set, in the sense that
different keys can happen to produce identical values, so the
values occur more than once in effect.

However it occurs to me that &quot;relationship&quot;, as in &quot;relational
database&quot;, or mathematics, is the correct general concept, and then
specifically a many-to-one relationship is what &quot;map&quot; means. In
RDBS jargon, there are two columns, left and right, and the left
column is a unique key. The major difference is that in a RDBS both
the direct single-result function and the reverse multiple-valued
function are provided, whereas in general a &quot;map&quot; doesn't provide
the reverse mvf at all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In Lisp, the term &quot;map&quot; is used as a verb, but it is still used
&gt; in this sense, because you have an input list and an output list.

You don't actually have an output list, except when the mapping
function is MAPCAR or it's MAP with type-of-output 'LIST. And you
don't have it except immediately after the mapping is performed.
And even after you have it, you can't do a key lookup to get the
value. The key-to-value lookup isn't in the mapping function, it's
in the function that it applied to elements in the list.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Both of the lists can be viewed as sets, and the function you're
&gt; applying is the definition of the relationship.
">

Yes, but like I said, that function being applied isn't the mapping
function, rather the test rig that applies it to the test suite is
the mapping function. So the name MAP mismatches where the map
really is, hence the word &quot;map&quot; is misdirecting.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; An associative array behaves like an array but opens up the restriction

Yes, my point.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but on the other hand, it is probably a pretty good term if your
&gt; goal is to get the point across.
">

Further point against it: Hash actually means two different things:
- The full process of computing a pseudo-random deterministic
function of the key, then reducing it modulo the number of
primary buckets to yield a first-attempt bucket number,
then resolving conflicts to yield a single bucket containing the
key (or empty so the key is immediately put in there), in a standard
hash table, or alternately sticking with that original bucket
but searching down an alist to find the key in a list of keys
all in the same primary bucket, so the actual bucket is in the
alist rather than in the primary table.
- What I nicknamed a &quot;pre-hash&quot;, just computing the pseudo-random
deterministic function, without any of the rest of the work in
locating a specific bucket in a specific table. As the size of
the table changes because it filled up, the pre-hash might not
change at all even while the buckets are grossly scrambled.
Note that even after you hash the key and find the bucket, per the
first option there, still it takes one more memory access before
you have the value. So neither sense of &quot;hash&quot; actually provides
the value already, just the cell (in first sense) or 32-bit number
(in second sense).

So I argue that you really aren't getting the point across.

Now &quot;hashtable&quot; is presumed to do all of that, plus the actual
fetch of the value, per the &quot;gethash(key)&quot; function.
So what really captures the concept is the hashtable and gethash
function together. Given the other problem with forcing an
implementation, I reject the term here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Language often endorses (and canonicalizes as standard usage)
&gt; terms that are not accurate but have a close relationship to the

&gt; general) even though a crown itself is just a physical object.

I agree as to the state of archaic language misnomers, but I'm
opposed to deliberately introducing further examples of misnomers.
For example, common usage is that whales are fish and bats are
birds, but I reject the idea that we should deliberate persist that

I have some other new ideas for the jargon:
- Key-Value (KV) collection
- Lookup collection
The basic idea is to emphasize two things, that it's a collection
of data rather than a general function that could potentially
compute a result from gazillions of possible inputs, it can compute
the result only for the data that has already been collected, and
that there's a lookup (key to value) function inherent in the
thingy, it's not *just* a collection without also a lookup method.

But I'm not totally comfortable with those new ideas either.

&gt; May I suggest the obvious, key/value map, or, if you want a more
&gt; compact term, a KV map.  It covers the key (you should excuse the
&gt; expression) features - the map is a function from one space to
&gt; another, the two being discordant, with one space being what you
&gt; want (the value) and the other what you have (the key).

Yeah, it was obvious to you, and just like special relativity it
was obvious to the rest of us after you or Einstein happened to
mention it first. So I guess in any document I would introduce it
as KV (key/value) map, after which I could just say KV map through
the rest of the same article. Or I could introduce it that way but
immediately say &quot;henceforth to be known as &lt;em&gt;map&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, and
consistently use em around use of the term later in the document. I
could even have a HyperLink to the Java class by that name, and
&quot;a.k.a. associative array&quot; with link to WikiPedia article. I think
that would cover all bases while allowing use of the shortest term
within the article.

Einstein didn't get a Nobel prize for s.r., so I guess you lose, sigh.
&lt;joke&gt;Maybe you should write a book called &quot;An Incovenient KV Map&quot;&lt;/joke&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As an alternative that will baffle the average programmer call it
&gt; a signification set ...
">

Unfortuately that implies just the set of ordered pairs, without a
machine to automatically perform lookups. I want to emphasize that
*both* are present, the data collection and the automated lookup
method. It's both a repository for data, and a very good reference
librarian guaranteed able&amp;willing to find anything in the collection.

It's like the difference between a &quot;programmed text&quot; as printed
book, where you see a page number and spend a few seconds to flip
through the pages to find that page, compared to a HTML file where
you click on a link and your Web browser automatically takes you to
that page. For your curiosity, when I first automated this process:
&lt; http://members.tripod.com/~MaasInfo/MaasInfo/MaasInfo.HowWide.html#Ol... &gt;
Richard Stallman did a similar thing 3000 miles away about the same
time, INFO mode of EMACS.

It's like the difference between the index in the back of a book,
where you manually perform binary search to find the key, thereby
obtain the page number, then manually flip pages to find the topic,
compared to a search engine where you enter the keyword and all the
lookup is done automatically giving you the resultant URL which
your browser then uses to fetch the actual data. The URL is
analagous to the handle on the data object, which the Map gives you
directly, and the Web page is analagous to the data within that
object, which you get automatically once you have the handle.

It's like the difference between an association list without any
function to do lookups, you just print it out and do the lookups
yourself manually, compared to an association list together with
the ASSOC function which does the lookups. Or a hash table by
itself without an accompanying gethash function, so you do a
coredump of the hashtable and find the item yourself, or with an
accompanying gethash function. Or a balanced binary tree by itself,
which you print out and manually traverse, or a bbt with
accompanying lookup function. Or a TreeOfLife Web page which you
manually browse to find the clade of interest (almost like 20
questions, is it a animal yes, is it a vertebrate yes, is it a
mammal no, is it a reptile yes, is it a crocodilian yes, is it an
american alligator no, is it an australian crocodile yes, compared
to the search engine in tolweb.org where you type in the clade and
the search engine automatically takes you to the right place. Or
like a tree of binary division to &quot;guess the number between 1 and
100&quot;, is it less than 50, etc., which you do manually ,compared to
you just type in the number and it does all the binary search
automatically.

Sorry for belaboring the point of including both the efficient data
structure *and* the automated algorithm for using that structure to
find the key and thence the value associated with it. (I use the
word &quot;efficient&quot; loosely here. For small collections, for example
just twenty key-value pairs, even an alist is sufficiently
efficient, more efficient than if you buried twenty key-value pairs
in a forest and had to search the entire forest just to find *any*
key-value pair much less the one you wanted. Remember Colossal Cave?)

Now my Subject field may have been slightly misleading. When I said
&quot;for key-to-value lookups&quot;, I intended that the lookups were part
of the jargon I was seeking, rather than something related to it
but not part of it? But it's hard to fit a correct description of
what I wanted in the Subject field. For example:
What is best term for key-to-value lookups using a data structure?
would have emphasized only the lookup method, not the structure.
What is best term for key-to-value lookups and the data structure where data is stored and in which the search is performed?
is 124 chaacters, too long for a proper newsgroup Subject field, as
well as getting the cart before the horse, you have to build the
structure first and *then* start performing searches. &lt;TMI&gt;You
build an empty structure, then alterately search and add new item
if not already present.&lt;/TMI&gt;
What is best term for the combination of a data structure containing key-value pairs and the accompanying automated procedure for using that structure to perform key-to-value lookups?
is correctly phrased but 183 characters, way way too long!! I don't
want to write Subject fields like Brad Guth or Archemedes Plutonium!!
I suppose if I had it to do all over again, if it were possible to
revise articles after posting, I would keep the original Subject
field but then word-wrap that 186-character question as the first
paragraph.

By the way, it occurs to me that the data structure by itself is
analagous to the inverted index used by the Google search engine,
while the lookup procedure is analagous to the search engine that
is run per user queries which uses that pre-computed index.
So another way of asking the question is what do you call the
combination of an index and the search engine that uses it, in the
special case where only exact key matches are supported, or for an
ordered set where only exact-or-nearest matches are supported.
The index can be as simple as an association list (alist),
or as advanced as a distributed hashtable or proxhash-table.

&gt; 'Dictionary' seems pretty language neutral to me.  The meaning also
&gt; seems very clear, especially to computer science people.  Of course,
&gt; dictionary has implied uniqueness which is not always the case with
&gt; key value lookups.
">

Actually I'd probably say &quot;data dictionary&quot; to make it clear I'm
talking about a database-jargon usage for the word rather than
normal Webster's use. But unfortunately that has a very different
meaning, namely &quot;a set of metadata that contains definitions and
representations of data elements.&quot;
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dictionary &gt;

Note that the word &quot;&quot; by itself has four common meanings:
A dictionary is a list of words and their meanings.
Dictionary may also mean:
* Biographical dictionary
* Associative array, a specific type of Set (computer science)
* Dictionary (software), a dictionary included in Mac OS X v10.4
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_%28disambiguation%29 &gt;
Note that my use is only third among four, not good enough to
satisfy me.
&lt;nitpick&gt;Associative array (dictionary, Map) is *not* a specific
type of Set, but vice versa, a Set is a specific type of Map
whereby the value is universally empty for every keys. I.e. a Set
can be emulated, given a Map, simply by storing dummy values for
all keys, but given just a Set there's no efficient way to emulate
a Map. If you simply store ordered pairs in a Set, then you can
only check whether a given &lt;key,value&gt; pair is present in the Set,
not perform a key-&gt;value lookup. Mathematically the two are
equivalent, but in computer science it's the difference between a
result generator and a mere result checker. Imagine for example key
is large composite number and value is its prime factorization.&lt;nitpick&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The name does not seem very important to me.  I think that the names
&gt; chosen for the implementation should fit the project and the names for
&gt; the abstract data types should be clearly documented.
">

In this case I'm doing this by myself, not part of any pre-existing
project, so this issue of compatibility with established jargon for
project doesn't apply. I want a *new* *personal* project to use the
best term I can find via brainstorming in a newsgroup.
So far &quot;associative array&quot; (because it's most standard, except in
Java) and &quot;key-value (KV) map&quot; (because it expresses the idea best,
and is Java friendly) are my current favorites. I've tentatively
discarded my previous personal favorite &quot;associative map&quot; in favor
of KV map, but I might change my mind again and revive it.

Oh, further clarification of Subject field: The term &quot;etc.&quot; refers
to the lookup method which uses the data structure, as well as
the various methods to build/modify the structure. For example,
with a Map object in Java, &quot;etc.&quot; refers to the 'get' method
&lt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#get(java.lan... )&gt;
as well as a void (no arguments) constructor and methods 'put' and 'remove'.
One thing I noticed just now when referring to that javadoc page is
that Map also includes a 'containsValue' method, which is *not*
implied by my &quot;etc.&quot; in the Subject field. This implies that the
Java interface essentially requires both the forward map itself and
the backward Set (just tell if any keys to match value, but not
actually list them all). I wonder why? Did Sun Microsystems make a gaffe?
&lt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#containsValu... )&gt;
&quot;This operation will probably require time linear in the map size
for most implementations of the Map interface.&quot;
Like why even bother requiring it, since if ever needed it can be
easily implemented simply by mapping down the set of all keys and
checking whether any value matches, which is probably what the
implementation in the class would do anyway. IMO only operations
that are reasonably efficient given the data structure should be
required to be provided, plus one operation that simply dumps the
data contents to another form that can be searched by user code.
For example, call
&lt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#keySet ()&gt;
then iterate the Set through it via
&lt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/util/Set.html#iterator ()&gt;

How about a &quot;function&quot;? A Map is a binary relation with KEY and VALUE
attributes such that there is a functional dependency KEY-&gt;VALUE, so
the term &quot;function&quot; is not as odd as it may seem.

Yeah. I take ideas from all corners. Who knows when some obscure
term in some obscure field will turn out to be generally applicable
and also easily understood across fields. For example &quot;Game Theory&quot;
is a small area of study, but turns ot to have applications to
warfare and evolution and social relations and business negotiation
street crime and all sorts of other topics. Non-zero-sum games are
especially important. With single one-time interaction, selfishness
to the utter degree is the best strategy. But with repeated
interactions with known &quot;opponents&quot;, building trust as much as
possible is the best strategy. (Too bad my former wife was too
stupid and arrogant to learn that.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I wanted to get just the right amount of generalization. IMO
&quot;mapping&quot; as you define it is too general.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; For example, y = square(x) is a mapping whether 'square' is an

Definitely too general for my purpose. From general to specific:
- Relation
- Many-to-one relation i.e. abstract function
- Clearly defined function (such as halting predicate for Turing machines)
- Effectively computable function (such as Ackerman's, or factoring integers)
- Efficiently computable function (such as the one you cited).
- Computable function with cache of results already computed.
- Many-to-one relation defined *only* via the actual data, no
abstract function, but with an efficient procedure for performing
key-&gt;value lookups (I seek the best term for *that*).
- Various implementations such as hashtable or self-balancing
binary tree or simple association list or trie etc.
- Specific implementations of collision resolution in hashtable
(simple chaining, quadradic chaining, second-hash-function
chaining, linked-list-per-bucket) or sbbt (red-black, AVL tree, Batcher
synchronous sorting network, MBBT, Arne Andersson tree,
Sleator/Tarjan splay tree).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yeah, that's what I thought too, probably because I saw the term in

list etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yeah. At first I thought &quot;dictionary&quot;, mentionned by one of the

up I realized it refers more to XML semantics, basically a set of
restructions on the basic XML syntax, given as a set of allowed
usages, nothing else allowed unless explicitly listed, sort of like
BNF. Obviously that's nothing at all like what I am trying to name.
So that would be even more misleading than &quot;... array&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How do you want to use the term? Is it for a language or library, or
&gt; is it for communication with humans?
">

Not for a language, i.e. I'm not designing yet another programming
language. Common Lisp and Java and PHP are quite enough for my
present needs.

For in-code comments/documentation as well as formal external
documentation and posted articles or Web pages summarizing what
I've accomplished. For example, I've long known the term &quot;Balanced
Binary Tree&quot;, but just recently I've switched to the more accurate
term &quot;Self-Balancing Binary Tree&quot;. (Technically as a mere
structure, it doesn't balance itself, the associated functions or
methods do the balancing of it. But as either an OO class or as a
package of functions &quot;it&quot; balances itself in the process of
ordinary usage when put or delete methods are called, and with
splay trees even 'get' method usually rebalances. You don't have to
call a special method outside the package which externally performs
a balance, as might be implied by the original term.)

Only for a library in the sense that I'd like the function/method
names to correspond to the documentation to make it easier to use
the API for it. For example, assume class/library MKVL meant
&quot;Maas Key-to-Value Lookup&quot;, then the functions might be:
make-mkvl
mkvl+key+val-put
mkvl+key-find
mkvl+key-delete
mkvl-size
and for OO method or named package you'd just drop the &quot;mkvl&quot;
prefix since that's redundant with the package name or class name:
Lisp package: (setq animals (mkvl:make)) (mkvl:put animals &quot;Carp&quot; &quot;Fish&quot;)
Java class: Mkvl animals = new MySuperHashTable(); animals.put(&quot;Carp&quot;, &quot;Fish&quot;).
where MySuperHashTable implements the Mkvl interface, for you Java experts.

So I want the self-documenting code and the comments and formal
documentation and discussions/advertisements to all use the same
easy-to-grok jargon.

&gt; every spelling only once, merging the entries for homonyms together
&gt; under one head word, even though they might subdivide the entry
&gt; within itself.

But in all cases it's up to the human to scan the various main
headings and identify which are a match for the intended spelling
and then read those and filter per meaning. This is all so
conflated as to mask what's really going on as a metaphor for what
I was asking about in this thead. I'm talking about an automated
procedure where the user (calling function) passes a keyword
(parameter) to the server (called function) and gets back a single
result, which is deteministic per the current state of the
collection object. A Web-based dictionary seems a better metaphor
than a printed dictionary: The client program submits a form to the
dictionary application, which returns a single (1) Web page, which
is formatted to show everything desired, which may be multiple
&quot;entries&quot;, but they are all structured within the single (1) Web
page that was returned. There's a clear distinction between the
actions of the Web service (given key, produce exactly one (1)
return value) and the client (given the return value, study it
locally).

As per your details, one service &lt;dictionary.com&gt; for example
provides a Web page which is divided into a section for possible
misspellings, a section for alterate languages, and a separate
section for each dictionary it draws upon. Each of those
separate-dictionary sections is organized however that particular
dictionary likes to do it. But still, the mapping from key to value
is deterministic (given the current state of the various Web sites
that constitute the virtual collection-object) and single-valued
(wouldn't it be &quot;fun&quot; if it popped up twenty different windows,
scattered all across your screen in random arrangement, almost like
spam? And if it can't do that because you're running lynx on Unix,
it cracks into your ISP and into your shell account and starts up
multiple lynx processes, one each per Web page it wanted to show you???
And in Java or other programming language, would you like a
key-to-value lookup that automatically forked your thread whenever
there was more than one value to return? Not for me!! But DSFDF.).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes, that's a more honest way of wording it. *You* find it interesting.
The rest of us, not necessarily.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; is that you can do the same thing with an associative array:  if
&gt; you have an associative array implementation which does not
&gt; support multiples of the same key,
">

Um, except for a RDBS, which deals with arbitrary relationships
rather than just many-to-one relationships as implied here, where
you get back a &quot;result set&quot;, even when there's only a single match,
or even no match, I can't think of any *implementation* that allows
multiple return values (except like in LIsp where the second return
value is a boolean to distinguish between NIL meaning nothing found
or something found and it was exactly NIL), and even in RDBS this
kind of query is not called an &quot;associative array&quot; AFAIK. Every
implementation of &quot;associative array&quot; AFAIK allows only one return
*value* (ignoring boolean success/failure side-values again). If
you know otherwise, please show the Web page that documents this
usage. So what you say next is *universal*, not just &quot;sometimes&quot;:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; you can store a list as the value and achieve the same effect.
">

Sure. Or you can pass back a continuation (i.e. an iteration or
stream etc.), for example how a RDBS passes back a &quot;result set&quot;, an
object with two methods IS_NEXT:boolean and GET_NEXT:value.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The functionality you get is exactly the same; it's just that one
&gt; way or the other might be more or less convenient for certain
&gt; purposes.
">

Sure, you can emulate multiple values within single values by
returning a list or continuation etc., or you can emulate single
values within multiple values simply by never taking advantage of
more than one value. But conceptionally, or per Kent Pittman's idea
of the &quot;intention&quot; of the data, single value per key and more than
one value per key are different mechanisms, and the methods are
correspondingly different:
- Single value:
-- Put(key,value)
-- Delete(key)
-- Get(key):value
- Multiple values:
-- Add(key,value)
-- Remove(key,value)
-- RemoveAll(key)
-- Get(key):value+continuation
-- GetAll(key):listOfValues
To emulate multiple values as list of values within single value
mechanism, you need to do all the extra work yourself outside the ADT:
-- Put(key,list[value])
-- PushNew(get(key), anotherValue)
-- Put(key, Remove(unwantedValue, get(key)))
The ADT does one thing, the API tells you how to do that and
nothing else, and if you want to do anything extra you do it
yourself.

So I'm talking, in this thread, about an ADT for single value from
each distinct key (or no value if that key wasn't yet put in the
table, or has been deleted since then), not about what additional
value-added features you can do yourself on top of the ADT for
key-&gt;singleValue lookup.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And the relevance of that for this discussion is that both
&gt; regular human-language dictionaries and computer-science
&gt; dictionaries have in common that either form is allowed.
">

*Not* for the specific ADT that I'm trying to find the best name
for via this newsgroup thread. The problem with the term
&quot;dictionary&quot; is that it's too vague, allows a different ADT than
what I want to talk about, so the word is **bad** for my specific use.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Which to my mind makes it a fairly good analogy.
">

Only for the more general concept of &quot;relationship&quot;, such as the
relationship between different columns, via rows, in a table of a RDBS:
Title of first column, and value of that column, yields set of all
rows that have that value in that column, then readout of second
column, with duplicates automatically condensed, yields the actual
&quot;result set&quot;).  SELECT col2 FROM table WHERE col1 = key

Since I'm trying to be at a particular level of specification here,
specific enough to include *only* single-result lookups
(and general enough to include all of hashtable binarytree and alist),
&quot;dictionary&quot; seems to be not the appropriate word for my use.

By the way, elsewhere in this thread I happened to look up the
formal definition of Java's 'Map' interface, and found something I
didn't quite like. I'd like to formally compare my ADT with Java's
'Map' now:  &lt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/util/Map.html &gt;
Method                               Java       My ADT
void clear()                         optional   optional
boolean containsKey(Object key)      required   optional
boolean containsValue(Object value)  required   not recommended
Set entrySet()                       required   desired
boolean equals(Object o)             required*
Object get(Object key)               required   required
int hashCode()                       required*
boolean isEmpty()                    required   desired
Set keySet()                         required   desired
Object put(Object key, Object value) optional   required
void putAll(Map t)                   optional   optional
Object remove(Object key)            optional   desired
int size()                           required   desired
Collection values()                  required   optional
* means specific to the way Java works internally
&quot;not recommended&quot; means any implementation is sure to be very inefficient
&quot;required&quot; means it's essential for what I intend my ADT to do
&quot;desired&quot; means it's not really essential, but it'd be nice to have
to be like all the other ADTs we know and 'love', or it'd be hard
to write user code to emulate this given only the *required* ADT,
so I'd recommend including it.
&quot;optional&quot; means it's trivial for user to implement this
efficiently on top of the given required+desired API, so it's
really not at all necessary to include in the API itself.

By the way, since this *is* comp.programming where we like to
discuss best practices, I thought I'd mention this alternative:
Instead of having to call first containsKey to determine whether a
key is present, then if it returned TRUE call get to actually get
the corresponding value, or alternately call get first then if
result is NULL call containsKey to see if it was NULL because it
actually found NULL as the value, maybe the Lisp approach instead:
Just call get with an optional argument saying what default value
to return when the key wasn't found. Then in all cases you need
make just one call to get both the is-key-present and what-value
info. If the default value was something constructed locally in the
calling code, then it can't possibly match anything actually in the
key-to-value table, so you're safe. Always compare the return value
against that local object to see if key was not present, then if
compare fails because key was present you actually process the
returned value. If the implementation of the API is something
relatively expensive, then this might cut the time in half, and if
concurrent threads may be

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; And speaking of database terminology, this set of key/values is a
&gt; relation.
">

Yes, except that term is more general than what I want to name. In
databases, generally each table has one or more columns which are
required to have unique values, and one of these unique-valued
columns is designated as the &quot;primary key&quot;. (My jargon may be
slightly sloppy. I hope you understand what I'm getting at.) Am I
basically correct so-far?

Any mapping from primary key to another column is guaranteed to be
single-valued going to the selected row and then of course
single-valued going to the value of the target column within that
row. This is the kind of mapping I'm referring to. SELECT ... WITH
KEYCOL = FOO is guaranteed to select either one row or zero rows,
so the result_set is guaranteed to have zero or one item.
This is termed a many-to-one relation in UML diagrams.

Any other mapping, from a non-unique column to any other, may return
multiple values.
This is termed a many-to-many relation in UML diagrams.

Of course if you have more than one unique column, and you map from
one to another, you have a one-to-one relation, which I don't
discuss here.

So is there any specialized term for the idea of a many-to-one
function used in the left-to-right direction (not in the reverse
direction) thereby being a &quot;function&quot; in the strict mathematical
sense (except of course for time-dependency caused by updates to
the data store)?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Map and mapping have similar meaning in mathematics, a mapping
&gt; from one set to another set is a relation, and also commonly
&gt; called a function.
">

Yes. Unfortunately the word &quot;function&quot; in math education implies
something you can write somewhat in closed form (until you get into
college and discuss the formalities of functions simply as a type
of relation and *nothing* more implied). Also &quot;function&quot; in
computer programming means something entirely different too, namely
an automated procedure that returns a value (and in Common Lisp as
well as C a function doesn't even have to formally return a value).
And like I said, &quot;relation&quot; is too general, allowing many-to-many
database lookups, which I want to exclude by definition.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; All of this is jargon, so trying to find one term to map(stand in for)
&gt; all of these similar words and phrases is a real challenge.

Yeah, that's why I started a thread to bring in more minds to help

independent modules (some tutorial, some merely in-code
documentation), I'll define the term briefly then immediately
provide URL of WikiPedia page for &quot;associative array&quot; which lists

If you look at only one point on the map at a time, that's true,
but generally you look at a whole section of a map together as a
gestalt whole. Thus 'map' implies a geometrical arrangement of the
domain and gestalt viewing. My ADT for &quot;associative map&quot; implies no
such thing. In fact there need not even be a geometrical relation
within the domain whatsoever. For example, consider the following
database table:
NAME      GENDER
Robert Maas       Male
Heather Thompson  Female
Hal 9000          Neutral
Dave Bowman       Male
Stanley Kubrick   Male
with the implied function NAME -&gt; GENDER. It would do no good
whatsoever to try to lay out the various NAMEs in any geographical
relationship to increase understanding of the GENDER values.
Compare to a geographical map laid out in a DB table, mapping
latitude and longitude to altitude or political unit etc., and the
data becomes immensely more comprehensible when drawn on a 2-d
surface instead of simply given by direct lookup. So I claim the
word &quot;map&quot; as used in geography has implications not wanted in my

Haha.  Sounds like the only possible term for the things you want to

Seriously, how about keyed data structure?

In trying to design data structures for a new language I am coming
round to the view that the name /could/ be dispensed with altogether.
I wouldn't recommend this yet but the reasoning is as follows.

Option 1 is to provide a small set of limited structures that cover
most cases. Option 2 is to provide a comprehensive suite of
structures. There may be a middle way, option 3, to provide combinable
features. These could be:

1. How do you want to index the data - names, integers, both?
2. Can names be used bare or do they need to be quoted? For example,
cheque[&quot;payee&quot;] and cheque.payee.
3. Does storage have to be contiguous?
4. Does the whole structure need to be in memory?
5. Are data to be returned as tuples or as packed binary and is the
index/name to be included? (The name is normally included when
considering database records but not arrays. The array approach is
fine as long as only one item is being referenced but does not work
well for a range. For a range each index may be needed to identify the
row or record returned.)

Here you could use associative-array or associative-data-structure but
programmers would not like the bother of the long names (a pain to
type and inhibit compactness, most notably requiring some calculations
to split over a line). Perhaps that is why language designers make up
a name or put their own interpretation on an existing term.

Some options:

keyed-node (a node can exist in many structures)
keyed-tuple (generic keyed info)

though perhaps it depends on whether you see the node or the
collection of nodes as being keyed. Maybe:

keyed-collection

Robert,

It might help to know a phrase I have used for many years which is

Self-documenting code isn't.

Normally I use this in the context that code can only tell you what it
does (the implementation), it cannot tell you what it should do (the
requirements). I think you might be overreaching for a easy term for
all those contexts. An abstract data type is abstract for a reason.
The functionality (look up a value for a given key) can be very
different from the implementation. just define the functionality in
the comments and design document, pick a term to associate with that
for your context and move on.

yeah ... wiki is good.  i just did a paper on job tickets, and found a whole
workflow language section, and lots of references to industry users that
have standardized job integration practices ... i have one computer that is
only for wiki.  that is almost full of it..  gotta go christmas shopping for
wiki2 computer.

OLE was designed to allow Microsoft Windows platform applications to
cooperate by linking and embedding the copies of files, or the applications
commands together.

im doing this other format project named virtual documents which by nature
use the data in the database.

CGI is just programming with some special types of input and a few strict
rules on program output.  Everything in between is just programming.  Of
course, there are special techniques that are particular to CGI, and thats
what the book CGI Programming on the World Wide Web is all about.

Client ---&gt; Server ---&gt; Application

A user on the Web (client) submits a completed form to the server.  The
server will call an application (common gateway interface).  The
application's response is passed back to the server, and then to the user on
the Web.

CGI changes the Web from just a simple collection of static hypermedia
documents (html) into a whole new interactive medium, in which users can ask
questions and run applications.

Overview of the Book

What is CGI - &quot;These documents could consist of, among other things, forms
that ask for feedback or registration information, imagemaps that allow you
to click on various parts of the image, counters that display the number of
users that accessed the document, and utilities that allow you to search
databases for particular information.&quot;

In a way, CGI is as easy as using simple recipes.  CGI is part of the Web
server that can communicate with other programs running on the server.  With
CGI the Web server can call up a program, while passing user-specific data
to the program (such as what host the user is connecting from, or input the
user has supplied using HTML form syntax).  The program then processes that
data, and then the server passes the program's response back to the Web
browser.

CGI is just programming with some special types of input and a few strict
rules on program output.  Everything in between is just programming.  Of
course, there are special techniques that are particular to CGI, and thats
what the book CGI Programming on the World Wide Web is all about.

&gt; Are you the same JSH who usually postes crankish stuff about
&gt; factorization algorithms to sci.math? If so, this is an amazing
&gt; improvement to see you posting like a normal person instead:

&gt; &gt; The c.l.m folks may have some ideas (as used in their own languages,
&gt; &gt; perhaps).

&gt; Yeah. I take ideas from all corners. Who knows when some obscure
&gt; term in some obscure field will turn out to be generally applicable
&gt; and also easily understood across fields. For example &quot;Game Theory&quot;
&gt; is a small area of study, but turns ot to have applications to
&gt; warfare and evolution and social relations and business negotiation
&gt; street crime and all sorts of other topics. Non-zero-sum games are
&gt; especially important. With single one-time interaction, selfishness
&gt; to the utter degree is the best strategy. But with repeated
&gt; interactions with known &quot;opponents&quot;, building trust as much as
&gt; possible is the best strategy. (Too bad my former wife was too
&gt; stupid and arrogant to learn that.)

&gt; &gt; FWIW I would call all of these mappings from a source set to a
&gt; &gt; result set. Mapping seems to me to be more general.

&gt; I wanted to get just the right amount of generalization. IMO
&gt; &quot;mapping&quot; as you define it is too general.

&gt; &gt; For example, y = square(x) is a mapping whether 'square' is an
&gt; &gt; array or a function.

&gt; Definitely too general for my purpose. From general to specific:
&gt; - Relation
&gt; - Many-to-one relation i.e. abstract function
&gt; - Clearly defined function (such as halting predicate for Turing machines)
&gt; - Effectively computable function (such as Ackerman's, or factoring
integers)
&gt; - Efficiently computable function (such as the one you cited).
&gt; - Computable function with cache of results already computed.
&gt; - Many-to-one relation defined *only* via the actual data, no
&gt;    abstract function, but with an efficient procedure for performing
&gt;    key-&gt;value lookups (I seek the best term for *that*).
&gt; - Various implementations such as hashtable or self-balancing
&gt;    binary tree or simple association list or trie etc.
&gt; - Specific implementations of collision resolution in hashtable
&gt;    (simple chaining, quadradic chaining, second-hash-function
&gt;    chaining, linked-list-per-bucket) or sbbt (red-black, AVL tree, Batcher
&gt; synchronous sorting network, MBBT, Arne Andersson tree,
&gt; Sleator/Tarjan splay tree).

&gt; &gt; When I saw your question I thought 'associative array' as that is the
&gt; &gt; most familiar term.

&gt; Yeah, that's what I thought too, probably because I saw the term in
&gt; some tutorial for Perl or PHP or both. But in both languages the
&gt; syntax is as if arrays, which tends to eliminate Japa 'map' and
&gt; Lisp 'hashtable' as anything the reader would think of.

&gt; &gt; Of the comments you've already received 'keyed array' from Frank
&gt; &gt; Swarbrick was a new one to me but immediately conveyed the thought.

&gt; Yeah, except it too has the connotation of it being syntactically
&gt; an array rather than a hashtable or balanced tree or association
&gt; list etc.

&gt; &gt; Someone else said that a dictionary was familiar to IT folk. I think,
&gt; &gt; though, that Database people might think of a data dictionary.

&gt; Yeah. At first I thought &quot;dictionary&quot;, mentionned by one of the
&gt; early posters, was the right DB term, but when I actually looked it
&gt; up I realized it refers more to XML semantics, basically a set of
&gt; restructions on the basic XML syntax, given as a set of allowed
&gt; usages, nothing else allowed unless explicitly listed, sort of like
&gt; BNF. Obviously that's nothing at all like what I am trying to name.
&gt; So that would be even more misleading than &quot;... array&quot;.

&gt; &gt; How do you want to use the term? Is it for a language or library, or
&gt; &gt; is it for communication with humans?

&gt; Not for a language, i.e. I'm not designing yet another programming
&gt; language. Common Lisp and Java and PHP are quite enough for my
&gt; present needs.

&gt; For in-code comments/documentation as well as formal external
&gt; documentation and posted articles or Web pages summarizing what
&gt; I've accomplished. For example, I've long known the term &quot;Balanced
&gt; Binary Tree&quot;, but just recently I've switched to the more accurate
&gt; term &quot;Self-Balancing Binary Tree&quot;. (Technically as a mere
&gt; structure, it doesn't balance itself, the associated functions or
&gt; methods do the balancing of it. But as either an OO class or as a
&gt; package of functions &quot;it&quot; balances itself in the process of
&gt; ordinary usage when put or delete methods are called, and with
&gt; splay trees even 'get' method usually rebalances. You don't have to
&gt; call a special method outside the package which externally performs
&gt; a balance, as might be implied by the original term.)

&gt; Only for a library in the sense that I'd like the function/method
&gt; names to correspond to the documentation to make it easier to use
&gt; the API for it. For example, assume class/library MKVL meant
&gt; &quot;Maas Key-to-Value Lookup&quot;, then the functions might be:
&gt; make-mkvl
&gt; mkvl+key+val-put
&gt; mkvl+key-find
&gt; mkvl+key-delete
&gt; mkvl-size
&gt; and for OO method or named package you'd just drop the &quot;mkvl&quot;

&quot;Fish&quot;).
&gt;   where MySuperHashTable implements the Mkvl interface, for you Java
experts.

&gt; It might help to know a phrase I have used for many years which is
&gt; Self-documenting code isn't.
">

&quot;A half truth is a lie.&quot;

So-called &quot;self documenting&quot; code goes a long way to making it
easier to follow code when somebody is studying the code to see how
it works interally, which can be at all levels of abstraction, from
low-level tools that hack machine registers or use tricky bit
vectors etc., to high-level scripts that merely piece together all
the mid-level utilities to accomplish an overall task. Consider the
difference between reading code where the local variables follows
the Java or Lisp convention of long descriptive names, vs. short
cryptic names.

But I agree such code doesn't fully document itself, see your
comments and my responses below:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Normally I use this in the context that code can only tell you
&gt; what it does (the implementation), it cannot tell you what it
&gt; should do (the requirements).
">

For ease of human understanding, I would go further: Comments
directly accompanying the code make it much easier for humans to
grasp the basic idea of the algorithm, after which reading the
actual lines of code is like &quot;of course, of course, of course, of
course&quot; instead of &quot;what is *that* supposed to do, why is that line
of code there, wait a minute how does this actually work&quot;.

Now back to topic:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think you might be overreaching for a easy term for all those
&gt; contexts. An abstract data type is abstract for a reason. The
&gt; functionality (look up a value for a given key) can be very
&gt; different from the implementation. just define the functionality
&gt; in the comments and design document, pick a term to associate with
&gt; that for your context and move on.
">

Unfortunately the most obviously descriptive term is too verbose:
&quot;Thingy that contains keys and associated values in some sort of
table and provides the service of mapping any one key to the
associated value via lookup&quot;
Repeating that whole phrase a hundred times in documentation for a
software application would be ugly!! For example, here's the
description of a function that takes a set of keys and produces a
set of values:
&quot;Given a thingy that contains keys and associated values in some
sort of table and provides the service of mapping any one key to
the associated value via lookup, and given a set of the keys, find
which of the keys are actually in the table, and retrieve their
associated values, and collect those values into a set with
duplicates removed.&quot;
I would like to make that more terse, something like
&quot;Given a &lt;foo&gt;, and given a set of the keys, find which of the keys
are actually in the &lt;foo&gt;, and retrieve their associated values,
and collect those values into a set with duplicates removed.&quot;
where &lt;foo&gt; is some suitable jargon term. I take it you would
prefer I keep the longwinded &quot;thingy&quot; description instead?

Now back to the general topic: I prefer a whole set of
documentation, starting with general purpose and use cases, then
specifications of how to implement use cases in terms of high-level
sub-tasks and general nature of persistent data stores, and then a
description of the purpose and methodology of each function/method
plus a general description of the purpose of each module of
functions/methods. **And** Java/Lisp-style verbose names for
everything to make it easy to follow the detailed code whenever
necessary *after* the general stuff has first been read and
basically understood. I'm ambivilent about the value of hierarchial
function-calling diagrams and UML etc., except for interlocked
tables in a relational database where UML or equivalent really
helps, partly because I like to work from a concept of bottom up
tool building, where there's no reason the manager of the toplevel
application needs to even know that the low-level utilities exist
much less how they call even lower level utilities. All the
low-level stuff that is reusable code should be &quot;invisible&quot;, just
part of the API rather than part of the application itself as far
as the manager is concerned, except for paying whoever wrote it in
the first place.

">

I disagree. CGI forces a completely different kind of program
management from other kinds of programming (such as &quot;main&quot; program
calling subroutines, GUI event-driven, or distributed actors
exchanging messages). The application is dominated by the need to
process the form contents (and optionally cookies) to re-establish
the program state for picking up where it previously left off, and
then for somehow saving the program state after transmitting the
next user form before closing the process. Some applications can be
completed in a single CGI transaction, submit form and get results
and you're all done, no state needs to be saved after a
transaction. But that's only a special case, such as a Google
search. Consider instead multi-transaction applications such as
Web-based e-mail
(log in, browse folders, view messages, compose and then send
outgoing messages, move messages between folders, log out),
or computer-assisted instruction
(log in, choose topic, see mini-tutorial and question, answer
question, read discussion of your answer, move on to next
question likewise, log out),
or online store
(log in, browse merchandise categories, read merchandise
descriptions, logically put instances of items in virtual
shopping cart, present credit card or PayPal card at checkout),
etc. Imagine how different such a program would be organized for
CGI (or JSP etc.), compared to event-driven GUI on a single
machine, or &quot;main&quot; program calling a command loop. The &quot;business
logic&quot; might be the same in all three cases, but the overall
program organization would be grossly different.

Well, to a large degree it depends on whether a relational database

I don't know of any free Web hosting services that provide it.

publ. Sams.net 1996.  Chapter 21 is a chapter of Part III : Using Your
Intranet - Business Applications.  The title of Chapter 21 is &quot;Creating a
Dynamic Site&quot;.

Static Data
Even the most dynamic intranet will contain a fair amount of static data,
such as employee handbook or memos that likely would be in text or HTML
files.  The problem with static data, however is that discerning old data
from new data can be difficult.  For this reason, you should establish a way
to tag or mark static data with a time stamp or date indicator that can be
posted on the site.

In the floral shop, the delivery personnel's directions and the bouquet
diagrams for the designers,such as fig. 21.1 Intranets Unleashed, pp. 323,
are examples of static files.

Image and Audio Data
In addition to the data input listed previously, users might input other
types of data onto the company intranet.  Images or audio files are an
example of uer-input data that could dynamically enhance your site.  The
creation and manipulation of image and audio files is getting easier.

Many companies have computer cameras.  After taking a snapshot the image is
saved as a .jpg file (Joint Photographic Experts Group) Intranets Unleashed
pp. 324.  Image input onto the intranet is especially useful for creating
easily updatable catalogs.  The designers at the flower shop might post GIFs
or JPGs to their bulletin board as a way to exhibit newly designed floral
arrangements, or to show examples of particulkar breeds of flowers.  A GIF
visual diagram showing how to contruct a flower arrangement pp. 324.

Inventory Data
These datasheets list available product stock or other type of inventory or
employee information; they can be organized with a spreadsheet program, like
Microsoft Excel or Lotus 1-2-3.  The floral shop requires that each of the
10 stores keep an individual inventory datasheet, but the board wants to
build a common inventory database for the company intranet.  This way, a
clerk would access the site when looking to see whether a product not
available in his store is available in another.

In the case that it is available in another, the clerk could then post a
message requesting the needed product.  Your intranet should allow employees
to input inventory data.  How the data will be stored and manipulated is
discussed later in the chapter Intranets Unleashed, chapter 21 pp. 323.

The Dynamic Site
On pp. 321 &quot;The Dynamic Site&quot;, the managers will use the site to administer
payroll for all employees and to create weekly schedules (all the employees
will be entering requests for days off into the website).  Managers also
will use the site to keep the employees up-to-date with the amount of work
and the type of work that will be needed for particularly busy times of the
year, such as holidays.  For example, because Mother's Day is one of the
more lucrative holidays for florists, managers will want to send information
to the employees for handling the influx of business during that week.

The data manipulated by the managers will need to be secured so that
sensitive data such as selaries and time-off requests will not be accessible
to everyone.  Therefore, a password system needs to be implemented for the
databases that the managers will be accessing.

Let's look at an example of the development of a dynamic intranet.  the
board of Directors of a floral comany with stores in 10 differrent locations
has decided to redesign its current Web site, which is a simle home page
listing the names, addresses, and phone numbers of the stores, in a static
HTML file.  The Directors have decided that the site should be expanded to
allow more options, not only for the public, but for the employees as well.

The primary internal goal is to allow the employees of the 10 stores to use
the site to communicate with each other.  the stores employ clerks,
managers, delivery people, and floral designers.

The needs of each class (or type) of employee should be incorporated into
the site.  First ill look at the needs of each type of employee, and then
i'll talk about what techniques and tools are available for meeting the
goals of the board of directors and the needs of the employees.

Clerks
Clerksk will use the site to record finiancial data about the stores' sales
and to update the product inventory (because they are responsible for
maintaining a steady stock of greeting cards and gifts).  Along with all the
inventory, clerke might also record the number of hours they work each week;
the site woulkd take the place of the time-clock system currently in use.
Clerks also use the site to communicate with the clerks from the other store
locations.  And because some of the stores are nerarby to one another, the
employees -especially the clerks -shift from store to store as necessary.

Managers
The managers will use the site to administer payroll for all the employees
and to create weekly schedules (all the employees will be entering requests
for days off into the site).  Managers also will use the site to keep the
employees up-to-date with the amount of work and the type of work that will
be needed for particularly busy times of theyear, such as holidays.  for
example, Mother's day.  the strategies for the busy week of Mothers day will
be posted.
A password system needs to be implemented for the databases that the
managers will be accessing.

Delivery Personnel
The delivery personnel will have uses for the site.  They will have
available maps, and delivery directions for the office buildings of frequent
clients, which are posted at the site.  New delivery drivers are given
access during their training.  And the status of the delivery personnel
would also be updated regularly throughout the day.

The destination of a delivery person is entered into the site when the clerk
who receives the order, fills out the invoice.  Then by means ofo a CGI
script, or programming communicating with a database, the current location
of a particular delivery truck can be tracked throughout the day.
Managemtent could track this information, by taking a snapshot of delivery
operations at particular times of the year (or even the day) and could use
the information as a reference for developing employee schedules.

Designers
The store's floral designers will benefit from the site as well.  Diagrams
and photographs of specialty bouquet arrangements will be available through
either, postingns or downloadable files.  The board of Directors also wants
to establish a designner's bulletin board, so that tips of the trade can be
communicated from the design teweam in one store, to the design teams in the
other stores.  when one designer creates a specialty design for a particular
holiday, the site will allow for an immediate posting of a photogaph, a
diagram, and written instructions to allow the designers in other stores to
implement the new floral arrangement immediately.

Intranet : Disadvantages
For one disadvantage, the intranet administrator must learn the
technicalities and techniques of establishing and maintaining such a dynamic
website.  In these regards the practices of quality, security, technical
ability, and expertise are most important.  And in the final analysis, the
intranet has to be useful, not only in its operations but in its
psychological appeal.  A friendly technology, is what this means.  Otherwise
the employees will not cooperate as alies with the sites design.

A concern about site development, would be how the division between the
internal site  which is used by the employees, and the public site which is
used by the people who want to place orders or simply to learn about the
comany, has been designed.  Because some of the information, such as a
customer order or complaint, will traverse from external site to internal
site, the public and the private aspects of the site structure must be
united (continuous).  The site designer must determine a way to allow unity
without jeopardizing security.

Intranet : Advantages
A secure and dynamic intranet that unites public and private access can be
established if the intranet builder (site developer) is creative and
knowleldgeable about what operations to include on the site.  In fact, a
dynamic intranet should be more secure than a static one, because the
contents of the pages are determined by the users and the scripts.  These
pages do not exist as files on the server , they are virtual documents not
files which are vulnerable to break-in.  These virtual documents do not even
exist until the client requests them, and when the user has obtained the
needed information and has logged off the server, these virtual documents
cease to exist.

Another advantage of creating a dynamic intranet: its nature requires that
the developers use databases as a means ofo organizing the data.  Having
information in a database makes it easier to manipulate later, should you
change platforms or redevelop the site, or expand company operations.

A dynamic intranet also increases the flexibility in terms of how you
capture, manage, and analyze data.  The way in which you choose to store
your  data is important: what you do now (data and otherwise) will affect he
stability,

approach databases and the Web..

The book is divided into several parts.  &quot;Building and Managing a Web Based

Building and Managing a Web Based Information System
This is an article which appears as chapter 15, authored by William Stanek,
Gregory Stenstrom, Richard Tuttle, and Sandra Tuttle.  The chapter 15's
subchapters are given as:

Web Publishing on the Company Network      pp. 448
Building a Large-Scale Information Structure      pp. 452
Web Publishing Database Products and Providers     pp. 457
Giving Your Files and Databases a Home      pp. 459
A Brief Walk-Through of a Large-Scale Web Publishing System Implementation
pp. 462
Network Publishing on Your New Web-Based Information System   pp. 465

The definition of a large-scale information structure is often a relative
one.  It could mean networking a small company's asset computers so that
they can access flat files, use email, and share information.

For a company with 10,000 employees, and an existing network, the concept of
a large-scale information structure could mean using Internet tools to
access corporate information structures i.e., databases.  These Internet
tools were listed in a business oriented database book as follows:

Internet Business Tools -
ad hoc query
analysis
reporting
data management

Consequently, in the sense of a variable environment (of diverse sizes), a
method you use to build an information structure using Internet tools
largely depends on your situation and needs.  Still, the data at the heart
of your information structure will generally be in the form of flat files
and databases.

From a section below about Scripting, &quot;CGI scripts can use this input to add
entries to an index, to search databases, to create customized documents
on-the-fly and much more.  Yet the most worderful thing about CGI scripts is
that they hide their complexities from users.  If you've used a fill-out
form or an image map on the Web, you've used a gateway script and probably
dodn't even know it.  This is because everything seems to happen
authomatically.  You enter data, click a mouse button, and a moment later a
resuylt is displayed.  This chapter explains what you need to know about CGI
scripts -what they are, how to use them and why to use them..&quot;

From Fundamentals of Information Systems by Ralph M. Stair (Florida State
Univ.) and George W. Reynolds (Univ. of Cincinnati) publ. Course Technology,
Boston Massachusetts 2001, Preface, &quot;We have always advocated that education
in information systems is critical for employment in almost any field.
Today, information systems are used for business processes from
communications to order processing to number crunching and in business
functions ranging from marketing to human resources to accounting and
finance.&quot;

business processes - communications, order processing, number crunching
business functions - marketing, human resourses, accounting, finance

To be successful, you must be able to view information systems from the
perspective of business and organizational needs.

Due to this requirement to understand the importance of information systems
in perspective of business and organizational needs a course in information
systems is essential for students of today's high-tech world.  Managerial
problem solving and decision making, gain benefit from the use of an
important set of economic tools (vii Brickley, et. al Managerial Economics
1997).  The set of tools which Brickley refers to is the economic model of
management to be used for the problem of managing their organizations.

The general concept of management will include a constant analysis of the
inputs by the management system upon the environment.  In most cases the
focus of interest in a computer system is not on new technology, but on
integrating well-understood technology into an organization.  -We can
evaluate the ways that the analysis of inputs by the management system can
require new tools, and integration of the technology within the
organization.

Managerial problem solving and decision making are pursuits which benefit
from the use of an important set of economic tools (vii Brickley, et. al
Managerial Economics 1997).  The set of tools which Brickley refers to is
the economic model of management to be used for the problem of managing
their organizations.  The general concept of management will include a
constant analysis of the inputs by the management system, and upon the
environment.  This statement suggests the integration of Web publishing as a
necessary organizational tool.

The development of an input table i.e., Radlow and a transition table would
be used to document the management system.

Today, information systems are used for business from communications to
order processing to number crunching, and in business functions ranging frm
marketing, to human resources, to accounting and finance.

File-Oriented Systems
The core of most document and information structures would be file-oriented
environments.  As is often the case, the company's documents are probably
scattered about with no real structure.  Many important documents are in
personal directories on hard drives which no one can access and the
secretaries spend a lot of time passing floppy disks about the office.  Some
key documents that could benefit everyone are stored in a location that only
one person knows about.

A few documents may be in directories or formats that are widely accessible.
As the company grows, the value of public directories, files, and exchange
of documents becomes increasingly apparent, especially when it is necessary
to distribute information to large groups of employees.

Publishing Your Web Site
Most of the time HTML pages, Web Publishing Unleashed pp.732, and associated
files must be in very specific directories in order for the files to be
accessed.  That would refer to the public_html directory.  But ifi your
files are in the correct directory and you still can not access them check
the following :

File and Directory Permissions
File Extensions
Index Files

File and Directory Permissions -
All operating systems flag files and directories with permissions.  The
permissions on files and directories are very important.  This is especially
true on UNIX systems where the default file permissions are set according to
an involved permission set.  If you are having problems accessing the file,
check permissions on both the file and the directory the file is in.

On a Windows/DOS system, valid modes for files and directories include,
system, hidden, read-only, executable ..

File Extensions -
The file extension you use should match the file type and format.  Web
servers may use the extension to determine what type of file you are trying
to access.  Web browsers may use the extension to determine what type of
file you are retrieving and the action to take on the file.

Your server may be configured to recognize the extension of .htm, as a valid
HTML document, it is often easiest to handle to avoid any hassle and use the
extension .html with UNIX, McIntosh, or some other servers.

If you use a Windows-based server, your HTML pages should have the extension
*.htm  Web Publishing Unleashed pp.733.

I am noting that the file extension is described as it applies to the
internal use of the server, and applications.  The exchange of files does
not seem to have been noted as a criteria which presents difficulties.

Index Files -
Most Web server software wants directories with HTML documents to have an
index file.

Servers will generally display the index when a user specifies a directory
name instead of a filename, and if the index file doesn't exist, you may
experience problems.

The index file is sometimes called index.html, but not always.  On a
Macintosh server running MacHTTP or WebStar, each folder should have an
index file called default.html.

Where Will the Files Be Stored
The question of business organization and information soon involves all of
the valuable resources which employees have created over the years.  The
answer to this question is to integrate key documents into the company's
information structure, but before you begin you should carefully consider
how and where you will store files.  Even for a small network, or even a
personal single-user environment, this is an important decision.

In a multiuser environment it will be a very important question.

Most people fail to use a file storage methodology for managing publishing
environments.  Years of experience in working with   networked environments
shows that it is a rare employee who maintains electronic documents in an
organized fashion.  Even those computer folks who should know better rarely
organize their documents in any fashion except whimsical.

Disorganized Structures -
A majority of users and organizations will have cryptically labeled, or
unlabeled documents, video tapes, music cassettes, and photos in a file
cabinet in the office.  And that is also how these organizations store the
data in their computer systems.
In evaluating large organizations and the data storage needs, the fact is
more than 90% of all documents stored will never be used again.

The 10% of documents that you would use again if you could find them are
often stored in an electronic labyrinth that only Houdini could help them to
escape from.

Getting organized is the key to making sense of the document storage

so was this relate to was the original question ??  attributes keyed to the
indexing, perhaps searching by storage location, as described.  now adays
using enterprise storage, data can be transcontinental and full-time access
can be in question....  did i get this one ?

Database-driven systems offer the advantage of assigning unique information
to a data element, commonly referred to as attributes,  which permit users
to better manage theiir publishing environment.

An attribute of a data element can refer to anything that is useful to the
publishing environment such as customer's ZIP code, address, or product
preferences.

An attribute could also refer to  a key element of a larger document, such
as a Web-published reference guide withattributes that refer to the format
the guide is written in (such as SGML), the auathor, the revision number,
whether it is a rough draft or in final form, and so on.

Information About the Document
A collection of attribute information about the document and its individual
components, as well as the information regarding organization and structure,
make up the data model for a database-driven publishing system.

As i have now read and reviewed .. there are two types of connections to
data, one is by the object, the other is by the attribute.  I see you have
suggested a shopping cart, where the contents are retained until the art is
emptied, even between sessions.  that is a good feature at www.powells.com
an online bookstore.  i see wherestate is important.  i am myself trying to
locate the instructions for registering a CLSID (class) so that i can try to
call a program using CGI.  but that is one of many programming issues.  i
use vbscript to an extent, but just now working on the design for a general
purpose website templete which can pass variables, in different uses i.e.,
overnite updates, read-only access, write-only access, chain of links from
earlier pages viewed, vertical projects organization, horizontal data
structure, OLE containers, data warehouse, terminal access (telnet),
scripts, publishing forms, machine systems, human behavior, television and
opera houses, handels messiah.. for the last 10 years was working to get to
where i am... basically a student

i see where CGI is a general term which can refer to many gateway program
facilities, incorporating a server, a client, programming language, and some
automated task which needs to be reckoned with.  However, the implementation
of a scripting engine, within a browser such as Netscape or Internet
Explorer, does away with questions of what language to use, and what server
(facilities) to use, and specifies browser issues to be wary about.  Where
CGI is not really an implementation, but sort of a goal..

Active Scripting (formerly known as ActiveX Scripting) is the technology
used in Windows OS to implement component-based scripting support.  It is
based on COM (more precisely OLE Automation) and allows installation of
additional scripting engines in the form of COM modules.

Active Scripting technologies were first released in 1996, with the Internet
Explorer 3.0 and IIS 3.0 products.

about two thirds down the column of text, OLE is described in detail.  the
explanation is describing a CORBA-type of messaging platform which exchanges
data which conforms to common formats i.e., tables, and numbers columns, and
integrates with the point and click Windows buttons, and image maps.  And
data produced within a Microsoft application i.e., Excel, or an SQL query
analysis tool is used across the connection at the browser, when it is
merged into a page of common HTML using special tags.  The connection to
this data can be delayed using a separate control OCX i.e., a command
button, a hyperlink, or client/server CGI voodoo...  Corba has been the
framework used for enterprise data integration, including common record
formats for records (medical, drivers license) which saves alot of
confusion.  The publishing industry trades on these successes, using a page
layout in standard organizing of images, text, clips, like the current
www.nytimes.com headline page.  A commentator describes a failure of global
economic development, which does not meet the expectations of this
technology.  The issue however, is that the enterprise is not bound to
global economics which are trancended by a new world order spinning in
CORBA.

i did in fact find the CLSID information.  I have the book programming
Windows 95 Unleashed publ. SAMS 1995.  since i have a lingering presense i
add these points on the OLE automation class.  The GUID (Global Unique
Interface ID is a 128-bit number represented in a string form by 32 hex
digits.  A CLSID (class ID) is used to uniquely identify an object.

A CLSID is a GUID.  There is also an interface ID IID, which identifies an
interface, also  a GUID.  An esample of the 32-bit hex CLSID is:

{00021a00-0000-0000-C000-000000000046},

above is used by Microsoft Visio.  An example of an IID is
{00000000-0000-0000-C00000-000000000046}, which belongs to IUnknown.  Use
{eight hexdigits-four hex dig.-four hex dig.-four hex dig.- 12 hex digits}
with all the hexdigitts in Uppercase.

Taken from chapter 24, component object model (COM).  Sections in the
chapter Interfaces, IUnknown, GUID, IClassFactory, Interfaces Revisited,
Marshaling, IShellLink.

An introduction to chapter 24, The COM is a specification for how objects
communicate with each other.  In its simplest form, COM is a contract for
binary compatibility among OLE obects.

Interfaces ch 24.
Every OLE object typically has multiple interfaces, each with a specialty.
An example discusses a file interface, a printing interface, and a
calculation interface.  Functions or procedures witin the fle interface can
be used to read, write, or delete a file.

One way toconceptualize an interface, is to imagine your PC as an OLE
object.  DOS can be thought of as an interface, which handles your I/O
methods.  Windows is another interface which handles your screen methods and
requires your DOS methods.

Chapter 23 OLE for the First Timer and chapter 24Compinent Object Model
(COM) were written by Lawrence Harris SAMS Indianapolis, IN.

The information and the development of topics which were subsequently
written in other texts, will serve me in the work I'm doing using Windows
RAD development environments.  I have the books for PowerBuilder 4 and
PowerBuilder 5 publ WROX 1996 -Instant PowerBuilder 5.0 Objects.. I will be
using Optima++ Developer.  It was offered as a client/server developer.

The book Intranets Unleashed publ. 1996 gives the code which follows:

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;Title&gt;Matthew Baird's ActiveX Test Page
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Matthew Baird's ActiveX Text Page

&lt;object&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

A few test instances from the integration design shown the above can
eventually lead to use of the new Microsoft Visual Web Developer 2008
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/beginner/bb964635.aspx see the features
exploration video.  For anyone interested, the server technology being used
tends to organize the page using larger organizational units, closer to BLOB
objects than HTML tags. Greetings to Mertes  from Celia Cruz and Carmen

out how the brain stores memories etc.),
so that later that understanding can be used by that same brain to
solve problems that involve the concepts that were learned, then

sizes of session co-existing with those, so the word &quot;session&quot; by
itself is useless to say what you really mean.

Consider the case where you are shopping on behalf of several other
people, carrying several different shopping carts (one for each
person you're shopping for), all within a single login session of
your own, and at any time you can &quot;check out&quot; one of the carts and
have that batch of goods delivered while you are still shopping
with the other carts. Each cart has associated with it:
- Your own login ID (same for all these carts).
- ID of person you're shopping for (different for each cart).
- Shopping list for that person, with entrees that are somewhat
vague, like &quot;bring back medium size package of baking soda&quot;,
which *you* must convert to UPC of item that can be purchased
- Accumulated actual items (UPCs thereof) so-far.

I don't quite understand why you need to do anything like that.
To set up a CGI program, you either have the application directly
as a script in the CGI file (typical way to do it in sh or perl),
or the application directly machine-executable (C, C++), or you set
up a sh script which launches the actual application (lisp, java).
Auto-loading of modules in lisp or java is part of the mechanism of
the language itself, having nothing to do with CGI. You just need
to make sure the classpath is correct in java, and that you have
autoload stubs in lisp.

I heard a lecture on the separation from localism, and resources during the
last few days.  At the root was a question of money for money's sake, and
the distinction between production, and progress.

Your point about the login session is a good use of language, but i already
thought it was a good point.  I only mentioned as a commendation, of sorts.

But the difference between object data, and attribute/value pairs, is in the
parent of the data.  An attribute value/pair is written in ASCII text.  An
object is something which is a data independent source, where the data can
on another machine in some other format (ODBC translated).  Data storage is
anywhere in the world with an Oracle database.    They also are known for
having agency contracts.  Are they doing an update?

Here's a scriptable index and retrieval proposal im working with.  In order
to manufacture a data system you need to create empty records which are
indexed.  As you know HTML is used to transfer data on the internet.  Once
HTML is set up on a server, you just feed data to the appropriate record.
Unfortunately for you, you're not a programmer more of a cheerleader i
think.

As noted above a script can be used to scan for the title, department,
project code, etc.  With this the index Web page is created.

Note that an entire enterprise could add minutes by this method because
there are no inherent physical restrictions and no need to manage the local
organization.  A sample intranet Web page for this hypothetical project
might appear similar to Table 47.1 see Intranets Unleashed pp. 705.

And I'll take two scooter pie jr's  and a box of &quot;good and plenty&quot;.  For my
nephew, we'll have 6 hot dogs with chili and cheese.  No wine..  I want to
point out that the use of internet involves a cache of the data.  Although
there may be two ends of the connection, there may not be a connection.  You
have to turn off the cache, and you can store the orders in the warehouse
computer, and a copy in the office server.  But using a directory service
such as Microsoft's Active Directory, the replication is done as required by
the directory.

I know a web database course with a working model of a test taking system,
Each test has many questions, and there are several tests to take.  Each
question is multiple choice.  There are of course right answers, and wrong
answers associated with each question.  He uses the Access database to store
the questions, and answers.  But in your model, you could store the
connections to the web pages which contain sets of answers, and indexed
questions (by test).

Try the www.599cd.com web database seminar its $99 on their website,  He'll
do hourly programming jobs too.  He can also administer the server for you.
He ca start your company for you, and work there for you.  He can set your
alarm clock, and then turn it off.  I'll just take a couple more
ring-dings...

i actually don't know the best way to combine C executables with the CGI
framework.  I though that the answer was to use an HTML page with an ActiveX
connection to the executable (through the operating system) using those
CLSID  numbers.  The executable would first be registered with the operating
system as a component.  The tutorial for Microsoft Personal Web Server
contins instructions for creating a component with Java anad regestering it.
Java is used for internet components since it works across different
platforms.  C programs only work on platforms which they are compatible
with.  Got any of those little coffee cakes ?

HTML 3,0 streamlines the query process and makes it easier to perform
queries on indexes.  Performing an ISINDEX query under HYML 3.0 is a five
step process.

Step 1. - the user access a document containing an ISINDEX query.   The
ISINDEX tag has an attribute HREF used to specify a gateway script for
searching.  That will also override the server's default URL.

&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;Searchable Document&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;ISINDEX REF=&quot;address.db&quot; PROMPT=&quot;What address would you like to search
for?&quot;&gt;

The PROMPT attribute of the ISINDEX tag is used as above to comment about
the user..
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;

It would look to me as if, the example above Web Publishing Unleashed Ch. 11
Writing CGI scripts pp. 355 will open a program which has been associated
withe the filename extension  &quot; .db &quot;.  This use of associating filename
extensions with a &quot;helper application&quot; was a new feature of HTML 3.0  Yet
the use of URLs is relative to a match of relative or absolute paths,  also
involving time and date references.

CGI itself is a browser extension.

I have some other related information.  I have some information about
sessions and cookies which is not what i am doing here though.  I am doing
gateway CGI programs.

- Gateways - Web gateways are programs or scripts used to access information
that is not directly readable by the client.  For example, say you have an
Oracle database that contains baseball statistics for all the players on
your company team.  And now say that you want to provide this information on
the Web.  Certainly you could not point your client to the database (i.e.,
open the URL associated with the file) with the expectation of seeing any
meaningful data. -This suggests that we need to reconsider our data
formatting where we can have a means to talk to the database data using the
database, other than HTML.

Unfortunately the example above seems to suggest pointing the browser at the
database, but it only opens the database.  What we want is the script with a
query.

CGI provides a solution in the form of a gateway to information that is not
directly readable by the client.  See Chapter 9, Gateways, Databases, amd
Search/Index Utilities for information about a language which can be used to
read the information contained within the database.

Step 2. - Following the prompt, the user enters a search string and client
relays this to the server.
Step 3. - Server sends search string to the script as a URL-encoded search
string.
Step 4. - the script uses the search string to perform an acion, such as
generating a document containing the results of the search.
Step 5. - Server sends results to client.

A sentence about this reads - &quot;Once you have the information, and read from
the media using a DBI extension to Perl to form SQL queries (to read the
information within the database for example), you can format and send it to
the client.  In this case the CGI serves as a gateway to the Oracle
database.&quot;

Simple Example: CGI
Similarly, you can write gateway programs to any other Internet Information
Service (IIS), including Archie, WAIS, and NNTP (Usenet News).  See Chapter
10 Gateways to Internet Information Services to locate examples of
interacting with other Internet services.

- Simple forms - can be used to collect information from the user.  This is
a reference given above.

The GET and POST methods of the FORM tag are both discussed.  Only the HTTP
GET method uses URL-encoded search strings.  This applies when a server
receives an URL-encoded search string, the server assigns the value of the
search string to the QUERY-STRING variable in the HTTP header.

As the server sets the following environment variables itr also passes the
input to the script - All the variables i.,.e, protocol, port, script name,
are filled in and displayd Ch 11. pp 357 Web Publishing Unleashed.

Using the environment, you can get an HTML with a DBI context (database
index page) and use the BASE tag to point for m a path to your scripts
directory.  Your DBI page should have links to scripts.  If you call an ASP
page you can use server side includes, or activate components such as
database connections.  A script is a little task oriented program for
generating reports from data often.  The script sends HTML back to the
client.  If you learn how to make the environments more compatible you can
do things like push and pop data onto queues, or fling pop ups.

Cheese doodle!!

How can I do anything you mention with Windows...?  I hae a book which
states, &quot;One long term strategy might be to adapt slightly nonmainstream
technlogy to utilize many applications' capabilty to use ODBC.  Using
products such as Nomad Developments corp.'s WebDBC or Allaire Corp.'s Cold
Fusion, developers can build pages that send and retrieve data using ODBC,
instead of building SQL inside CGI, Perl, or Embedded SQL-C scripts..&quot;

Further down in this page, &quot;The Web browser serves as the Universal client
and must be able to access and display data from virtually anywhere.
Unix-based and NT systems have an edge as a data source, because they
support intranet standards.  However mainframes and midrange computers are
not as fortunate.  Not only do you have to convert working networking
protocols, you must also concern yourself with different text standards
(ASCII and EBSDIC) and the nuances of terminal based communication.  One way
of handling this problem is straight forward: You convert terminal based
forms into Web pages, creating CGI fields mimicking the source screen.  This
process is often called wrapping (or screen wrapping), because you are
simply adding a translation layer between the terminal based application and
the Web-based application..&quot;

Although I only have use UNIX in a programming mode, with a C compiler, the
UNIX systems have documentation that is worse than even Windows systems.  It
seems to me that it gets worse until you to give up on Unix altogether, with
regard for applications.  It would most likely be impossible to achieve a
UNIX server which is secure, and write even a mickey mouse application to
run on it, without employing a dozen people for at least 5 years.

I doubt if I know how to create terminal based forms into Web pages.  Where
I came from terminal based forms used XWindows or some similar graphical
user application development language.  The article I was citing - Web
Publishing Unleashed (i think) suggested that converting Windows Word
documents into Web pages was elementary work.  -That implementation would be
handy to merge a file of addreses into a general letter format.  Each of
those documents would then have the Title, PRoject, Department etc, already
in the heading.  And the same data file would be used to create an indexing
web page.  - There is an functioning example of wrapping approaching what
the Unix people wished for.  -There must be a Unix browser by now .. but i
haven' used one, except possible at the public library.  Im working with an
article about how to manage applications of various types to integrate them,
and the users into a modern intranet.  The topic is WorkFlow, at the highest
level enterprise the multinational holding corporation.  I don;t know if
unix is used for applications any more.  The IT department has my employment
application but after all ... which is how they address the issue of
hopefull longing in vain from behind an Iron Curtain of technology

This is a paper I wrote under gthe name Wally : The Gerry Fallwell Story
with some observance on observance .. George ..

The reference book to begin here, Access Database Design and Programming by
Steven Roman publ. O'Reilly and Associates, Sebastopol, California 1997.  If
you want to have as much control over your databases as possible, you will
need to do some programming.  In fact, even some simple things require
programming.  For instance, there is no way to retrieve the list of fields
of a given table using the Access graphical interface -you can only get this
list through programming.

In addition, programming may be the only way to access and manipulate a
database from within another application.  For instance, if you are working
in Microsoft Excel, you can create and manipulate an Access database with as
much power as if you were working with Access itself, but only through
programming -because Excel does not have the capability to render graphical
representations of database objects.

You can create the database within Access and then manipulate it
programmatically from within Excel (can an Access form be opened within
Excel, no ?).  This gives the increased functionality of Access to an Excel
file (is it created as an Access or Excel file, Access table?). (Create it
using VBA code in Excel .. also, if that works.. not sure how to try it).

For the most part the preliminary interest would be to use Access data
storage in connection with other Microsoft data sharing applications.  This
type of office automation and data sharing will occur often with the use of
LAN network technology within an organization.

Organization
An organization is a formal collection of people and other resources
established to accomplish a set of goals.  The primary goal of a for-profit
organization is to maximize the shareholder value, often measured by the
price of the company's stock.  Nonprofit organizations include social
groups, religious groups, universities, and other organizations that do not
have profit as the primary goal.

An organization is a system.  Money, people, materials, machines, and
equipment, data, information, and decisions are constantly in use in any
organization.  If data is to represent a real world problem, then the data
must be copied into an application as a quantity, and the system will react
and transform the data into information which is designed to effect some
problem in the real world.  Part of the process of data design is to specify
how to quantify each data item.

Data characteristics - applies to the use of data, as a copy translated to
and from, an attribute/value pair.

Data File Design - internal database technology characteristics
The issue of quantifying each data item is the issue of representation of
quantities with symbols such as $24/ft or $14.98 a yard.  Representation of
a quantity can be  considered in terms of a copy of a measurement in
translation, with the use of a symbol.  Data characteristics, applies to the
use of data, as a copy translated to and from, an attribute/value pair.

Logical data modeling is a philosophy as well as a technique, for
recognizing and documenting the fact that business data have an existence,
independent of how they are accessed, who accesses them, and whether or not
such access is computerized.  These business facts are true even if there is
no current need to produce a report or to answer queries about these
business facts.  They have a different way of looking at business facts in
that they consider the potential of file relationships to be involved.  But
what exists is the representation of facts as units which can transfer into
a processing system, and also then translate to be the effect or process of
transformation of the environment by the system.

The propose business facts such as:
Business Facts
- Customers place orders
- People eat ice cream cones
- Some people pay bills on time
- Some people do not pay bills on time
- Some people do not pay bills at all

Typical Data Characteristics
Some typical data characteristics are:
Location attributes (address, country, warehouse bin)
Physical attributes (weight dimension, volume, color, material, texture)
Conceptual attributes (name, rank, serial number)
Relational attributes (assemblies consist of sub-assemblies, authors write
multiple books)
Value attributes (currency, goodwill, esteem)

And each item of data should have a description:
Name
General description (what is it?)
Ownership (who is responsible for it?)
Data characteristics (how is it measured and how big or small can it be?)
Logical events, processes, and relationships (how and when is it created,
modified, and used?)

Issues which involve data constitute an important portion of the software
engineering process.  The eventual result of (1) analysis of existing data
structures, (2) application documentation, and (3) review, is to arrive at a
conceptual view of your application's information.  The issues of the
application's information (What, Where, When, and Why..) describe and
explore how various departments, organizations, and your application itself
need to use data to achieve a goal.

A last point to be aware of is on the use of utility programs to copy files
and name them appropriately.  The Push model involves performing an SQL
command to create a recordset or dataset that matches the fields in the
report, and passing that object to the report.  The creation of files
themselves should be performed in such a way the complete file is written to
the media in a single procedure; which allows the compression of data on the
hard disk to fill the disk with the maximum amount of compressed data per
media sector.

You can combine the recrods from the two tables by creating a query that
shows just the information that you need.

Today we live in an information economy.  Information itself has value, and
commerce often involves the exchange of information, rather than the
exchange of tangibles. Investors are using information systems to make
multi-million dollar decisions.  And financial institutions are employing
information systems to transfer billions of dollars around the world
electronically, and manufacturers are using them to order supplies and to
distribute goods faster than ever before.

In an experimental database which has tables and relations about horseracing
some of the entities may be:
Horse (hname, trainer/jock, sire, dam, damsire, breeding farm, age)
Track (race #, horse #, region, purses, race type (clm, alw), known class
horses, known class trainers, known breeding stables)
Pairings of attributes (horse/track, trainer/horse, trainer/jockey)
Indices (evaluations of indices,
Data about data - metadata
reference data - data warehouse environment
transaction structure data
transaction activity data
transaction audit data

The Different Kinds of Reference Data
Reference data may be a distinct class of data, but it is still very
diverse.

Some major kinds of reference data are:

(1) Things that are not involved with the enterprise: Countries, currencies,
and time zones are examples of things that exist, but are not parties to the
transactions that an enterprise carries out.  Yet the enterprise still needs
to use the information about these things to process and report on its
transaction data.
Classification schemes: Human beings can classify transaction information in
an infinite number of ways, depending on what they view is important about
it.  Classification schemes may be broadly accepted, like industry codes, or
highly personal and transient.
Constant values:  &quot;Things&quot; are typically described by codes and descriptions
in reference data tables.  Yet, some reference data covers specific
properties of these things.  Tax rates, economic indicators and currency
exchange rates are good examples.   They are non-key attributes of reference
data tables, and typically change their values over time.

Non-key attributes from reference data tables
Codes for classification (M,F)
External references (currencies, countries, cities, time, location, project,
table name)

Type codes: These define entity subtypes in a database.  For instance,
Employee Position may be Administrative or Professional.  Type codes have
values that are known when a database is designed.

Status codes: These control the life cycles of entities in a database.  An
order may be placed, filled, shipped, received, have payment received, and
have payment cleared.  Each of these states has a different description, and
is usually represented by a code in a physical database table.  Again, these
codes have values that are known at database design time.

Other: There are other kinds of reference data, but these are the major
classes.  It can be seen that although they often have similar structures -
tables consisting of codes and descriptions - they have quite different
functions and behaviors.

Access Database Design and Programming , by Steven Roman publ. O' Reilly and
Associates, Inc.1997 suggests that database design and database programming
are two separate topics.  And Romans suggests that while the knowledge of
the one does not directly lead to knowledge of the other, the topics are
linked.  A database user needs to know something about both subjects -
database design and database programming, in order to effectively create,
use, and maintain, a database which will produce the information about these
relationships.  What the book by Roman says is fairly close to Von Halle and
Fleming who evaluate the logical data model design (database design) and the
implementation using technology (database programming).

Relational Database Design Considerations
The use of multiple tables is promoted in order to overcome some of the
following concerns which occur with the use of a flat file database:

Redundancy
Update anomalies
Insertion anomalies
Avoiding data loss
Maintaining relational integrity
Creating views

As a summary of the discussion about the issues above

The phenomenologist philosophers were dedicated to observations of observers
observing...  Nonetheless, the recording of the observervances is assumed to
serve practical goals, I suppose.  he comment by Bernard Shaw seems to fall
into line with that idea.  Why not cynicism, because that is not observing
according to Shaw.  Ok.  I wrote down some data related characteristics,
which came to me via early books in the computer field., and experience of
the authors, and college librarians who collect such works.  I am working on
technically friendly systems.   Problem solving is a major business
practice, yet the definition of business systems is simply what IBM says
that it is ..The operative word is data propaganda (propagation) ... Too

&gt; This is a paper I wrote under gthe name Wally : The Gerry Fallwell Story
&gt; with some observance on observance .. George ..

&gt; The reference book to begin here, Access Database Design and Programming
by
&gt; Steven Roman publ. O'Reilly and Associates, Sebastopol, California 1997.
If
&gt; you want to have as much control over your databases as possible, you will
&gt; need to do some programming.  In fact, even some simple things require
&gt; programming.  For instance, there is no way to retrieve the list of fields
&gt; of a given table using the Access graphical interface -you can only get
this
&gt; list through programming.

&gt; In addition, programming may be the only way to access and manipulate a
&gt; database from within another application.  For instance, if you are
working
&gt; in Microsoft Excel, you can create and manipulate an Access database with
as
&gt; much power as if you were working with Access itself, but only through
&gt; programming -because Excel does not have the capability to render
graphical
&gt; representations of database objects.

&gt; You can create the database within Access and then manipulate it
&gt; programmatically from within Excel (can an Access form be opened within
&gt; Excel, no ?).  This gives the increased functionality of Access to an
Excel
&gt; file (is it created as an Access or Excel file, Access table?). (Create it
&gt; using VBA code in Excel .. also, if that works.. not sure how to try it).

&gt; For the most part the preliminary interest would be to use Access data
&gt; storage in connection with other Microsoft data sharing applications.
This
&gt; type of office automation and data sharing will occur often with the use
of
&gt; LAN network technology within an organization.

&gt; Organization
&gt; An organization is a formal collection of people and other resources
&gt; established to accomplish a set of goals.  The primary goal of a
for-profit
&gt; organization is to maximize the shareholder value, often measured by the
&gt; price of the company's stock.  Nonprofit organizations include social
&gt; groups, religious groups, universities, and other organizations that do
not
&gt; have profit as the primary goal.

&gt; An organization is a system.  Money, people, materials, machines, and
&gt; equipment, data, information, and decisions are constantly in use in any
&gt; organization.  If data is to represent a real world problem, then the data
&gt; must be copied into an application as a quantity, and the system will
react
&gt; and transform the data into information which is designed to effect some
&gt; problem in the real world.  Part of the process of data design is to
specify
&gt; how to quantify each data item.

&gt; Data characteristics - applies to the use of data, as a copy translated to
&gt; and from, an attribute/value pair.

&gt; Data File Design - internal database technology characteristics
&gt; The issue of quantifying each data item is the issue of representation of
&gt; quantities with symbols such as $24/ft or $14.98 a yard.  Representation
of
&gt; a quantity can be  considered in terms of a copy of a measurement in
&gt; translation, with the use of a symbol.  Data characteristics, applies to
the
&gt; use of data, as a copy translated to and from, an attribute/value pair.

&gt; Logical data modeling is a philosophy as well as a technique, for
&gt; recognizing and documenting the fact that business data have an existence,
&gt; independent of how they are accessed, who accesses them, and whether or
not
&gt; such access is computerized.  These business facts are true even if there
is
&gt; no current need to produce a report or to answer queries about these
&gt; business facts.  They have a different way of looking at business facts in
&gt; that they consider the potential of file relationships to be involved.
But
&gt; what exists is the representation of facts as units which can transfer
into
&gt; a processing system, and also then translate to be the effect or process
of
&gt; transformation of the environment by the system.

&gt; The propose business facts such as:
&gt; Business Facts
&gt; - Customers place orders
&gt; - People eat ice cream cones
&gt; - Some people pay bills on time
&gt; - Some people do not pay bills on time
&gt; - Some people do not pay bills at all

&gt; Typical Data Characteristics
&gt; Some typical data characteristics are:
&gt; Location attributes (address, country, warehouse bin)
&gt; Physical attributes (weight dimension, volume, color, material, texture)
&gt; Conceptual attributes (name, rank, serial number)
&gt; Relational attributes (assemblies consist of sub-assemblies, authors write
&gt; multiple books)
&gt; Value attributes (currency, goodwill, esteem)

&gt; And each item of data should have a description:
&gt; Name
&gt; General description (what is it?)
&gt; Ownership (who is responsible for it?)
&gt; Data characteristics (how is it measured and how big or small can it be?)
&gt; Logical events, processes, and relationships (how and when is it created,
&gt; modified, and used?)

&gt; Issues which involve data constitute an important portion of the software
&gt; engineering process.  The eventual result of (1) analysis of existing data
&gt; structures, (2) application documentation, and (3) review, is to arrive at
a
&gt; conceptual view of your application's information.  The issues of the
&gt; application's information (What, Where, When, and Why..) describe and
&gt; explore how various departments, organizations, and your application
itself
&gt; need to use data to achieve a goal.

&gt; A last point to be aware of is on the use of utility programs to copy
files
&gt; and name them appropriately.  The Push model involves performing an SQL
&gt; command to create a recordset or dataset that matches the fields in the
&gt; report, and passing that object to the report.  The creation of files
&gt; themselves should be performed in such a way the complete file is written
to
&gt; the media in a single procedure; which allows the compression of data on
the
&gt; hard disk to fill the disk with the maximum amount of compressed data per
&gt; media sector.

&gt; You can combine the recrods from the two tables by creating a query that
&gt; shows just the information that you need.

&gt; Today we live in an information economy.  Information itself has value,
and
&gt; commerce often involves the exchange of information, rather than the
&gt; exchange of tangibles. Investors are using information systems to make
&gt; multi-million dollar decisions.  And financial institutions are employing
&gt; information systems to transfer billions of dollars around the world
&gt; electronically, and manufacturers are using them to order supplies and to
&gt; distribute goods faster than ever before.

&gt; In an experimental database which has tables and relations about
horseracing
&gt; some of the entities may be:
&gt; Horse (hname, trainer/jock, sire, dam, damsire, breeding farm, age)
&gt; Track (race #, horse #, region, purses, race type (clm, alw), known class
&gt; horses, known class trainers, known breeding stables)
&gt; Pairings of attributes (horse/track, trainer/horse, trainer/jockey)
&gt; Indices (evaluations of indices,
&gt; Data about data - metadata
&gt; reference data - data warehouse environment
&gt; transaction structure data
&gt; transaction activity data
&gt; transaction audit data

&gt; The Different Kinds of Reference Data
&gt; Reference data may be a distinct class of data, but it is still very
&gt; diverse.

&gt; Some major kinds of reference data are:

&gt; (1) Things that are not involved with the enterprise: Countries,
currencies,
&gt; and time zones are examples of things that exist, but are not parties to
the
&gt; transactions that an enterprise carries out.  Yet the enterprise still
needs
&gt; to use the information about these things to process and report on its
&gt; transaction data.
&gt; Classification schemes: Human beings can classify transaction information
in
&gt; an infinite number of ways, depending on what they view is important about
&gt; it.  Classification schemes may be broadly accepted, like industry codes,
or
&gt; highly personal and transient.
&gt; Constant values:  &quot;Things&quot; are typically described by codes and
descriptions
&gt; in reference data tables.  Yet, some reference data covers specific
&gt; properties of these things.  Tax rates, economic indicators and currency
&gt; exchange rates are good examples.   They are non-key attributes of
reference
&gt; data tables, and typically change their values over time.

&gt; Non-key attributes from reference data tables
&gt; Codes for classification (M,F)
&gt; External references (currencies, countries, cities, time, location,
project,
&gt; table name)

&gt; Type codes: These define entity subtypes in a database.  For instance,
&gt; Employee Position may be Administrative or Professional.  Type codes have
&gt; values that are known when a database is designed.

&gt; Status codes: These control the life cycles of entities in a database.  An
&gt; order may be placed, filled, shipped, received, have payment received, and
&gt; have payment cleared.  Each of these states has a different description,
and
&gt; is usually represented by a code in a physical database table.  Again,
these
&gt; codes have values that are known at database design time.

That's one of those aspects that is usually transparent, so it

You mean there isn't a real-time end-to-end connection? Of course
there *must* be an end-to-end virtual connection when using HTTP.
(End-to-end means client-to-server. There needn't be a
user-to-database virtual connection in real time. User-to-client,
client-to-server, and server-to-database, can be relatively
asynchronous to some degree, while each of the three is internally
synchronous.)

That's garbage! With manually taken test on mark-sense paper, of
course multiple-choice is the only feasible way. But with
InterNet-based client/server tests, short-answer fill-in with
automatic guidance toward correct spelling of correct answer with
partial points-off for such corrections needed, is much much better
than multiple choice. There's really no excuse for pretending we
have a batch system of submitting decks of mark-sense cards, when
we actually have an interactive Web client/server system.

Guessing multiple choice by elimination is nowhere as good as
short-answer fill-in in determiming whether somebody really knows
the correct answer to a question. Multiple choice shifts the
thought process away from actually knowing the answer, to learning
heuristics for eliminating obviously false answers the guessing
randomly from the rest, which distracts from actual learning.
Fill-in restores the emphasis in learning the correct answer and
testing whether the student really knows the correct answer even if
slightly misspelled.
English: &quot;perchance&quot;
Spanish: &quot;*** casualidad&quot;
Don't you think it rather defeats the lesson if five multiple
choices are given instead of the user just typing the correct
3-letter word?
English: &quot;The word of the day&quot;
Spanish: &quot;La palabra *** d{i'}a&quot;

Spanish: &quot;mis padres ** aman&quot;)
Ditto (2 letters)?
English: &quot;forever&quot;
Spanish: &quot;**** siempre&quot;
Ditto (4 letters)?
I actually think a person who knows the correct answer is more
likely to make a mistake matching the letter A,B,C,D,E with correct
answer than just typing the short answer in directly, and typing
directly is faster than scanning multiple choices too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There are of course right answers, and wrong answers associated

With short-answer fill-in there is no need to set up strawmen wrong
answers. Just store the secret correct answer and be done with it!
Question goes database-&gt;server-&gt;client-&gt;user
Student's answer goes user-&gt;client-&gt;server
Correct answer goes database-&gt;server
Comparison occurs on server, which is secure against student's eavesdropping.

Yes. (And for computational questions, such as solving algebraic
equations, which are parameterized in real time, the database would
store an algorithm for computing the correct answer, or a one-way
algorithm for comparing correct/student answer without first
computing the correct answer.)

Note that for a final exam we'd need some way to prevent the
student from cheating by doing a Google search to find the Web
pages containing the Q/A pairs and then simply copying and pasting.
Google Images keyword-tagging game provides a start to a solution:
Suppose we have native English speakers learning Spanish, and
native Spanish speakers learning English. One fact about foreign
languages is that it's easier to translate from foreign to native
language than vice versa. Another fact is that supplying one
missing word is easier than supplying the entire translation. So
here's my idea for a &quot;final exam&quot; which can't be cheated: Random
text in language A is picked from the Web. It's passed to native
speakers of language A to proofread. If a vast majority accept it
as valid, it goes to the next step, else it's rejected. Natives of
language B are asked to translate from language A. If a vast
majority agree on the translation, then it goes to the next step,
else it's rejected. Natives of either language are asked to fill in
just one missing word of their foreign language, given full text of
their native language. Grading &quot;on the curve&quot; per Shannon entropy
is performed. I.e. if 100% of the students get it correct, in both
directions A-&gt;B and B-&gt;A then it's regarded as &quot;too easy&quot;. If just
one person gets it wrong, that person gets a big bad mark while
everyone else gets a small good mark. If just a few get it right,
they get big good credit while everyone else is penalized only a
little. If there's a spread from exactly correct answer through
slightly misspelled correct ansers to completely wrong answers,
partial credit is given. Since all translations are on-the-fly via
the proofreading game and the full-translation test, it's very
unlikely that the translation pair already exists online, and on
the average it wouldn't be profitable for any student to try to
cheat by using Google to look for the translation pair. As a extra
protection, the test-maker system might explicitly do a Google
search for each translation pair, and also ask BabelFish for
translation, just to make sure neither affords a way to cheat. Of
course for the *final*exam*, students would be locked in a room
with no access to cellphone or any other way to cheat. Then they
could be given 100% questions they already studied online, and
nearly 100% correct answers could be expected to match what the
student claimed to demonstrate online.

&gt; i actually don't know the best way to combine C executables with
&gt; the CGI framework.
">

Why is that an important question. Didn't you ever hear of &quot;good enough&quot;?

What sort of C executables do you feel would be needed within a CGI
framework? Are you talking about the standard types of utilities
such as occur on Unix? Or are you talking about custom C
applications per the specific CGI application?

The standard utilities basically take in one dataset and produce
another, possibly refering to another dataset (these datasets
typically being flat text files). These are easy to incorporate
into a higher-level script, regardless of whether that script is
written in sh (or csh etc.) or perl or lisp or PHP etc. If
application-specific executables are likewise written in the same
style, they should likewise be easily incorporated into the
toplevel script.

But this all begs the question whether there's any need for custom
C applications. If the main CGI application is written in lisp or
java, there might not be any need whatsoever to call any C
sub-application.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I though that the answer was to use an HTML page with an ActiveX
&gt; connection to the executable (through the operating system) using
&gt; those CLSID  numbers.
">

Why is that needed? Why not just run the executable as a
sub-process under lisp, with stdin and stdout piped through the
toplevel application? The toplevel calls FORMAT to transmit
commands to the sub-process, and uses READ-LINE followed by some
simple parser to receive results back from the sub-process.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The executable would first be registered with the operating
&gt; system as a component.
">

With stdio sub-applications, all you need to invoke it is the
directory-path and filename, and with shell variable $PATH set up
properly you can omit the directory-path. Why bother with a more
complicated system of registering components?
