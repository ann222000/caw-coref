I will never go to another camera store.  It amazes me how these
places stay in business.

I have a 3 year year old digital camera that suddenly stopped working.
I took it to a local camera store to inquire about getting it
repaired.  As soon as I showed it to the guy he handed me a form to
fill out.  After I filled it out, he told me that the camera would be
checked and I would get a repair estimate.  If the camera was
repairable, they would fix it, and the cost would be anywhere from
$100 to $200.  He stuffed my camera in an envelope along with the form
I filled out and said I had to pay $50 downpayment, of which half
would be applied to the repair costs if I decided to do the repair,
otherwise I'd just be out the $50 and the dead camera would be
returned to me.  At this point I told him I would not pay the $50 and
I'd just take the camera somewhere else for repair.

Then this guy shows me a new camera and tells me that mine is obsolete
anyhow, and for $289 I could buy this new one.  I knew at this point
that it was time to leave the store.  I quickly looked at the new
camera and made a mental note of the model number and left the store.

I went to Walmart where I found the exact same camera brand and model
on the shelf for $129.  I later called another store and found they
had this same model for $135.

If this is what these camera stores do (rip people off), I will never
step foot in another one.

By the way, my so-called &quot;obsolete&quot; camera took excellent pictures and
was compatible with any PC computer.  I am going to see if I can get
it repaired by the factory or another place other than a camera store.

Has it occurred to you that perhaps it is unwise to
extrapolate from the treatment you received at one camera
store to a generalized opinion about all of them?

Probably all the guy was going to do is ship your camera off to the
manufacturer. Think about it, it's a digital camera... Likely contains
not much more than a few micro-chips which can neither be repaired or
replaced.

Solid state electronics are disposable.

A new camera that is twice as good can be had for the cost of repairing
your old camera, and the new one will still be PC compatible.

Which camera store did you go to?  Your rant may be fully justified,
but without knowing where you went it does no one any good.

As to your general statement about camera stores ripping you off - you
couldn't be more wrong.  I've been a serious amateur photography for
over 40 years.  Camera stores are, in general, staffed with the most
knowledgeable and honest sales people of any specialty field.  You'll
get a lot more than a receipt when you buy something from them rather
than at a big box discount store.  So, it just comes down to what you
want for your money.

And finally, low end electronics, and this includes digital cameras,
is throw away technology.  They're just not worth fixing.  And any
digital camera that can be replaced brand new for under $150.00 is
definitely low end.
