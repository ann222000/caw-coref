I'm sorry to hear of your loss.  They are never with us long enough.  I made
a scrapbook album and put together a video of my Barney.  I still cry when I
watch it.

oh i'm so sorry for your loss. it's so hard.

when i lost my poodle, siren, i made a box for her. i got a nice
wooden box, and i put her things in it, along with some photos of her.
i got her ashes back, so they're in there, her pink princess tshirt,
her best sweater, her collar and tags, her leash. it helped.

above all, be gentle with yourself. you've lost your friend and family
member. it's ok to take a time to grieve.

I cried a lot.  I found myself seeing our dog out of the corner of my eye
when he wasn't there.  I cried some more.  After a while, we brought another
dog into our lives.

They're never with us long enough.  I am so very, very sorry - it hurts so
much.

the first but to help heal the heart)

I'm so sorry for your loss of Teaka. There are no words that I could write
that could make you feel better....only time will do that.

After I lost Finn, I stayed at a friend's apartment for almost a week. I
didn't want to stay here alone (even though my heart cat was still alive
then) with only the memory of him. I live in a teeeeeeny NY studio, so
there was no place I could go where I wouldn't see the spot on the floor
where he took his very last step or the indentation on the bed where he
took his last breath. I needed some distance from that.

I pretty much cried for a week. Then I cried on and off for another week.
The sniffling and eye watering at every thought of him lasted a long time.

I brought his ashes to my stepdads farm. It was one of his favorite places.
He's still sitting on the mantel by the fireplace. This summer, Ill be
bringing the ashes of my heart cat to join him....and they'll be buried
together. The field rabbits up there better watch their asses- those two
were fiery and loved to hunt :-)

Be well.

Tara

You cry a lot, you see her out of the corner of your eye, you
think you hear her barking, you find yourself walking to
refrigerator at her feeding times, your lap and arms feel empty.
You allow yourself to grieve, no matter how much it hurts.

You remember everything you can about her.  Some people make a
scrapbook, others a web site, others a video, others a journal.
Or if you already have something, you take it out and read it,
and cement the good memories in your heart, there for you to open
up and treasure in the days to come.

Eventually, you may want to adopt another dog - maybe in a day or
two, maybe in a year or two.  The love you had for her is big
enough to love another one, not as a replacement, but as one with
whom you can share your life again.

My first "own dog" (as opposed to "family dog") was a chihuahua
named Tika - probably pronounced the same way as your Teaka
(tee'-kah).  She was with me until she was sixteen.  We've shared
our lives with four other dogs since then, two still alive.
Their only failing is that they don't live long enough.

I'm sorry for your loss.

I'm very sorry for your loss; it is something most of us understand all
too well.

Many people find some comfort in "The Rainbow Bridge" and other things
found at http://www.petloss.com .

Peace be with you.

I'm so sorry for your loss. Folks really invest their hearts into the pet
members of their family. When they lose them it seems as though part of the
heart kind of goes numb. That's normal. You would grieve if a human member
of your family died as well so it's only normal that you go through the same
process. You feel mostly profound sadness now with a few moments of smiles
as you let the good memories surface. Over time, you will have mostly good
memories &amp; smiles with just a few moments of passing sadness.

It's not much of a comfort, but you did an awesome job getting Teaka to 14
years old.  I'm sure she gave you some wonderful years and you gave her a
wonderful family in return. Savor those memories and know that she is free
of the physical restraints of old age.

I'm very sorry for your loss. I know it doesn't help now, but it may
help later, to say that the intensity and immediacy of the loss DOES
fade. You don't lose the love, but after a while, most of the time it
doesn't hurt so much as it does right now to remember it.

When my first dog died, I cried. I talked to other people who loved
her, and to other people who had pets or who had lost pets. You can't
talk about it to people who aren't pet people; they won't understand.
I've done this with every pet since. We buried Sunday in the back
yard; I don't recommend this anymore, because I've moved half a dozen
times since then. I think it's better to have a pet cremated, and
either scatter the ashes someplace that she loved, or get a nice urn.
For two of my cats, Midori and Absynthe, who were littermates, their
ashes are sitting on the bookcase they liked to perch on top of.

Eventually, you'll very likely find you're ready for a new pet to
share your life. Don't feel you're being disloyal to Teaka if/when
that happens; she'd want you to be happy. But also don't let anyone
else rush you into it, with the argument that that's the way to get
over this. It might be, for some people it is, but what matters is
what's right for you and your feelings. You'll know when you're ready.
I've usually had multiple pets, which can also be a comfort. When my
tortie kitty, Kahlua, died at age 13, she was one of four, and I never
got a successor for her. When Absynthe died, at the tender age of
four, I waited a few months and got another kitten--which put Midori's
nose out of joint, but she got over it. (She got over it a lot faster
than she got over Absynthe's loss, for sure.) And when Midori died at
age eleven, the last survivor of a sweet but not very healthy litter,
well, it's been two years that Aquavit (Absynthe's successor) and
Retsina (the Grand Old Lady of the household, at just shy of 14) have
gotten along with that hole in our household, and I just now got, not
a new cat, but a new dog.

You will get through this. It will get better. Don't let anyone tell
you how FAST you should be getting through it. Grief takes its own
time.
