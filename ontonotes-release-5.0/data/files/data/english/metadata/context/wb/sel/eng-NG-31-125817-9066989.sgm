Big cable ties is what you want.

yes, but the main problem is that a jubilee clip is likely to foul on
something, it would be ok on the inner end though.  I usually use cable ties
, if the kit hasn't got those nice metal ones that crimp up tight.

They will loosen off or move and rip themselves to bits with the off balance
vibration. The bit with the screw/housing is a counterweight.
Big cables ties is the solution as suggested by the other posters.

What he said. I sometimes &quot;daisy-chain&quot; a couple of smaller cable ties
where space is tight (eg Minis).

I've fitted many of them. On certain vehicles, it's the only way to keep the
boot on, unless you manage to get a proper crimp on metal band (an actual
crimp on one, not one of the pull tight and fold over ones).

Main issue is to make sure there is enough clearance.

They're not the ideal solution, but they do the job.

It's the inner end of an outer CV that I'm looking at.  The metal
pinch clip has somehow become loose, although I have managed to
(temporarily) tighten it by re-pinching it.

Sounds good, and other posters seem to agree.

That should be a permanent fix. Otherwise buy a stainless steel cable tie
from Maplins/RS

Are these necessarily any better than the plastic ones?

Yep, you can pull them tighter &amp; they're stronger. If the plastic one's
tight enough then that's irrelevant, but I've found them to 100% reliable.

you cant beat the proper metal band, &amp; with the correct tool to close the
clip up, it makes for a better job.
some vehicles use plastic boots &amp; cable ties wont hold it secure enough to
the housing.

Ive had no problems with using jubees on CV boots, although on the outer
end of an outer CVyou have to take care it wont contact the hub
carrier/strut areas (bear in mind that when rotating at full speed or
under the stress of cornering it might expand a smidge and catch). Also
the bolt/screw bit of a jubilee will slightly off-balance the rotating
assembly.
