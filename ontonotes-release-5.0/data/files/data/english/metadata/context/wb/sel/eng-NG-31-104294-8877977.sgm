I am running out of ideas.  I am trying to display really large filled
polys of 1000+ points in non-VML / non-SVG enabled environments.
Everything I try just hangs the browser.  I can display segmented
polylines but I cannot display polygons composed of small segments.  I
am encoding both.

Can someone point me to a working example in non-VML / non-SVG
browsers ?  Thanks very much.

Also, when polys overlap (intersect), their opacities are additive.  A
REALLY COOL option would be to let the developer decide how to combine
their opacity parameters.  In my case, I would like to be able to
shade an entire state then reduce the opacity for selected counties.
A negative opacity might do the trick.
