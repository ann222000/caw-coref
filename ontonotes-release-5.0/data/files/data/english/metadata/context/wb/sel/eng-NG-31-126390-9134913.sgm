Is there a way to run OSX and apps from a smaller partition (or small
HD) but have your User documents, especially graphics and video files,
on a larger partition (or second internal  HD)?

As far as I can see, OSX insists of having user files on the boot disk.
When I open iPhoto, for example, it will not use the iPhoto library on
another disk.

I have a reason for wanting to do this.  When I boot from my larger
internal HD (a WD), my G4 won't sleep.  It will sleep normally when I
boot from the OEM Maxtor HD which, however, is too small to hold our
iPhoto library and video projects.

Perhaps someone can set me straight on this.

If you are using 10.4 this might help:

I think netinfo manager is gone in 10.5, but it most likely is replaced
with something that might be easier, even.

This is Unix, so absolutely, there's a way.  : )

That depends. If you mount your /Users folder from a separate partition,
iPhoto won't even know the difference to begin with, and will happily
function none-the-wiser.

If you ask me, you should concentrate on solving this problem rather
than trying to implement a work around solution.

What happens when you try to put the machine to sleep manually while
booted on this drive? What errors, if any, show up in the system log - I
would expect something to show up.

I have a separate disk for /Volumes/Home (Leopard makes this easier than
ever), that's where my user directories go.  I have no problem with any
apps.

Just a small sidebar.  I used to have similar sleep problems until I
recently got rid of the Maxtor and put in another drive.  I had
previously thought the problems were related to my Mac model.  I was
stunned to see how &quot;normal&quot; the sleep and energy saver functions became
w/o the Maxtor.  YMMV of course.

Certainly. It's trivial to do so, using the System Preferences/Account
settings in Leopard, or slightly less trivially done from NetInfo in earlier
versions of OS X.

That's easily done, too, from inside iPhoto.

You can use the Unix command ln to redirect a reference to folder on
your small partition to a folder on  your larger partition. You need
to be careful when you pick the folder. You best avoid any system
folder, those folders needed at startup You could pick some user data
folder. Please try this when you have a full backup.

mac harddrive &gt; Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal
man ln
ln -s target source

An alternative way would be to install SymbolicLinker.  SymbolicLinker
is a tiny contextual menu plugin that, once installed, allows any user
to create symbolic links to files inside the Finder.

And here's how to do it in Mac OS X 10.4:
