Hi -

Kudos to Dave Snowden for revisiting KM and Sin. It recalls the famous CIO
quote from 2001 on KM.

&quot;Knowledge management is like teenage sex,&quot; he says. &quot;Everyone is talking
about it all the time, everyone thinks everyone else is doing it, almost no
one is really doing it although everyone is bragging about it, and those who
are doing it aren't doing it very well.&quot;

Sadly, it remains even more true today, particularly among the legions of
timid KM dilettantes, aka, the fluffy bunnies.

John,
While your views on KM are both evident and clear, KM bashing as a topic
seems a bit outside the topic of value networks. This latest teenage sex
email does not appear to follow a thread that included both value
networks and KM.

As someone who is working hard to complete a KM Masters degree, I am
finding usefulness in my KM learnings, and think there is room for all
of us to get along, without bashing KM for the sake of fun - or what
ever pay-off this may have for you.

While admitedly, I cannot hang with the likes of; you, Charlie, Benoit,
the Dave's, and Verna in contributing to VN discussions - I am learning
much about the concepts and worth of VN's from this group. I also have
made good associations through this group which have supported my
educational and professional pursuits. I have attended your Cluster and
enjoyed Verna's teachings.

Cordially,
Ian

Hi Ian -

Thanks.

The purpose is to point out simply that to improve, grow and lead, KM must
examine itself. It needs to be deliberate and conscious. There is no
bashing. (?) KM has become stagnant and highly failure prone precisely
because it does not examine itself or learn from it mistakes. Usually
failure is not fun, but it is always hugely informative. The irony is that
KM preaches these KM techniques, like AAR, double-loop learning, post
mortems, etc., but is allergic to adopting these practices for themselves.

That's all. Simple.

If references to near decade-old, prescient industry opinion of KM from
leaders, experts and stakeholders like the 11 Sins or Teenage Sex, are
painful for you or anyone else to hear, the maybe, just maybe, they are
making an impact. Otherwise, if KM retrospection and introspection, and most
importantly, prospection becomes unbearable, then perhaps is not the right
place to be at the moment.

The reason for posting here is that value networks and analysis hold a
enormous promise for KM. After all, KM is nearly entirely about intangibles.
Today's KM has failed to provide method, tools or techniques to master the
complex, dynamic pathways of intangibles, their co-creation and their
conversion into entirely new forms of business, economic, societal and
environmental value. That, in short, is what value networks do for KM.
Simple.

Meanwhile, there are some very faint signals that KM is rebounding, notably
the demise of the foolish KM certification nonsense, the total collapse of
process-centric KM and the rise of authentic, accredited academic programs
like you mention.

Noteworthy also to KM is value networks and the '2.0' hype are rapidly
accelerating the fundamental social reorientation of work; something KM has
been trying to do for decades. These are encouraging signs!

Cordially,

-j

Hi John

I had a chuckle at this thread, especially because I suspect the anaolgy may be even better using &quot;Senior Citizen Sex&quot; Â as there seems to be a lot of arthric thinking that prevails at the moment..
I think that what has passed for KM in recent memory has largely been supply oriented and limited in it's efficacy.
A long time ago Stan Davis had suggested that people rushing to create knowledge organizations should realize that this was seriously misguided..
The organization needs to be put in place to support the business.
And his point was that before you have a knowledge based organization, you need a knowledge based business.
Many KM projects involved trying to implement knowledge organization patterns in traditional businesses.
A bank for example trying to implement KM and creating a knowledge organization with no change to it's industrial, transaction processing, linear business model.
Or a widget company ( eg. the pump company?) trying to be a smarter &quot;widget company&quot; without re-framing it's business model and seeing its new purpose as
being in the '&quot;fluid dynamics&quot; knowledge business.
No big surprise then - much of this was a big waste of money, time, and effort, and indeed failed to deliver much transformation and new value creation.
Fortunately there is a real global knowledge based economy and it continues to grow and dynamically expand.
As this happens, we see the evolution of better emergent modalities such as value networks, knowledge markets, knowledge innovation zones, and importantly it's also time we got smarter about knowledge based business models. With regard to the latter most traditional KM practitioners know very little and this is a growing liability.

Thanks- I found the referenced links to be profound- in the sense that
the teachings I am receiving from effective KM Practitioners and others
are guiding our class toward behaviors which &quot;undo&quot; the sins.
Your response tells me we are on the same page.

Bryan,

Just to point out, as it is not obvious, GenIsis in its full version
does enable one to develop a knowledge based strategy for an
organisation - based on Karl-Eric Sveiby's work. It focuses on what
are sometimes termed the &quot;foreground intangibles&quot; of competence,
internal structure and business / external relationships.

The increasingly significant &quot;background intangibles&quot; of environmental
health, social citizenship, corporate identity are not formally
addressed from a &quot;knowledge&quot; perspective as far as I know, but they
certainly feature in Impact and Value Creation Analyses.

Referring to fluid dynamics and sex reminds me of the joke about
different engineers.But will leave to another day!

Ian, thank you for your posting. One of the things I love about the KM
community is that people in KM really have great heart and passion and
commitment to bringing people together with a higher quality of
connection and a deep respect for the intelligence everyone brings to
the party. This came through loud and clear in your posting and I
thank you for that.

John and Dave are my favorite curmugeons because I know that both have
great and good hearts and that their occasional crankiness and ranting
stems from the frustrations of sincerely trying to make the world a
better place. Many people complain, but few proactively really try to
make a change. It is very hard work as most on this discussion board
know.

One of the reasons I am so passionate about value network analysis is
that it is thoroughly grounded on the brilliant breakthroughs on
intangible value and assets that virtually all of the early KM
pioneers talked about at least as much as - if not more than -
knowledge management. Value network brings us full circle back to that
orientation which is based on profoundly different principles that I
believe will ultimately lead us to new business and economic models
that include the fabric of society and the web of life on the planet.
As David Meggitt points out it is also integrated with the KM tools of
Karl-Erik Sveiby whose work I admire enormously for being both deeply
rooted in theory and thoughtful reflection and the practicalities of
every day business. I believe it also fills a void in the KM world in
helping people make a socko business case for KM initiatives without
falling back into the old industrial age thinking.

Transformation happens one darn person at a time and if people don't
have new business tools to work with we can talk until we are blue
about change but nothing will happen. Even if people really don't know
anything about KM, intangible assets, sustainability or networks this
simple way of mapping out how their business &quot;really&quot; works will lead
them into the new way of thinking. Too many people try to &quot;sell&quot; new
ideas instead of providing the on-ramps for people to learn them for
themselves.

&gt; most importantly, prospection becomes unbearable, then perhaps is not
&gt; the right place to be at the moment...

&gt; The reason for posting here is that value networks and analysis hold a
&gt; enormous promise for KM. After all, KM is nearly entirely about
&gt; intangibles. Today's KM has failed to provide method, tools or
&gt; techniques to master the complex, dynamic pathways of intangibles, their
&gt; co-creation and their conversion into entirely new forms of business,
&gt; economic, societal and environmental value. That, in short, is what
&gt; value networks do for KM. Simple.

&gt; Meanwhile, there are some very faint signals that KM is rebounding,
&gt; notably the demise of the foolish KM certification nonsense, the total
&gt; collapse of process-centric KM and the rise of authentic, accredited
&gt; academic programs like you mention.

&gt; Noteworthy also to KM is value networks and the '2.0' hype are rapidly
&gt; accelerating the fundamental social reorientation of work; something KM
&gt; has been trying to do for decades. These are encouraging signs!

&gt; Cordially,

&gt; P.S. Good luck with your studies!

&gt; Hi -

&gt; Kudos to Dave Snowden for revisiting KM and Sin. It recalls the famous
&gt; CIO quote from 2001 on KM.

&gt; &quot;Knowledge management is like teenage sex,&quot; he says. &quot;Everyone is
&gt; talking about it all the time, everyone thinks everyone else is doing
&gt; it, almost no one is really doing it although everyone is bragging about
&gt; it, and those who are doing it aren't doing it very well.&quot;

&gt; Sadly, it remains even more true today, particularly among the legions

Hi -

When people begin to adopt whole system perspectives through value networks
and VN analysis there is a common epiphany. It goes something like this,
&quot;Gee, that cool. Thanks for explaining what I've been doing for the last
twenty years.&quot;

Honestly, social citizenship and environmental responsibility, for example,
are not new concepts, they have just been badly hurt and devalued by
unsustainable corporate process archetypes like BPR and SCM. Conventional,
overbearing command and control hierarchy seriously and intentionally
attenuates key social &amp; environmental values and foundations as well.

For example, some big companies have 'citizenship and environment' as part
of their published value system as in, say, a &quot;people, planet, profit&quot;
tagline. Problem is, these edicts never gets down to the supply chain,
distribution channels or factory floor. They are hollow, specious. They are
considered empty and rather ludicrous by the rank and file AND by the board
of directors.

The problem is, and it is a KM problem, leaders see business, citizenship,
environment as mutually exclusive. Value networks and VN analysis quickly
illustrates they are inexorably interdependent. Quite simply, applying value
networks coheres, refracts and anneals through visualization and analysis,
the inescapable interdependence of business, citizenship, environment once
and for all. The outcome of the value network perspective is sharp business
growth, improved civil societies and much healthier environments.

Concerning intangibles, the problem so far is they have been described and
led with anecdotal evidence and a sort of unctuous business folklore. Many
individual guru-style experts have written on them, some good, some bad.
Often, understanding intangibles was an arcane science with little or no
roadmap, standards, tools or guidelines. It was quite difficult too.

Fortunately, that is changing rapidly. Some of the key factors influencing
the mastery of intangibles for business are:

1. Â  Â The rise of value network analysis and robust mathematical analysis
and visualizations like GenIsis;

2. Â  Â Govt mandates like intangible standards for the management discussion
and analysis (MD&amp;A) of the 10-K;

3. Â  Â Failing, low payoff methods like 6-Sigma; the law of diminishing
returns for process archetypes &amp; methods.

This is the perfect storm for rapid adoption - govt mandate, proven
mathematical technique, failing process infrastructures.

To stay abreast of breaking developments in the critical field of
intangibles, you may syndicate this open feed:

http://kmblogs.com/public/blog/85529

Meanwhile, My belief is that we all carry with us an integrated,
whole-system mental model of business, citizenship, environment. Problem is
we check citizenship &amp; environment at reception every day before starting
'work.' (?) It so that we can be hero-fools and focus on 'business' for the
whole day, then some. Sadly, this has been the deliberate objective of
modern organizational archetypes and their ordered regiments. Citizenship
and the environment have suffered for generations under these debilitating
process and function models.

Today, however, new value networks techniques, models and methods allow
people to embrace these innate, visceral mental models of business,
citizenship, environment. They allow all to truly express themselves in
their roles, links and exchanges, the entirely of their behaviours and
activities, to achieve greater wealth, health and happiness.

Fluffy bunnies multiply like...well...like bunnies. They are
everywhere. Worst cases are those who believe that their particular
potion, be it KM, value networks, Lean, SNA or whatever is the one
magic pill that will cure all corporate evil. The only thing that will
cure all corporate evil is pure and simple backbone for people to do
what they know to be the right thing for the good of the whole. That
doesn't come in a pill - or a methodology.

development and who don't engage at any level below their &quot;peers&quot;

The top executives keep painting a rosy picture based on 15% yr/yr growth
rate in top line revenue.

Paul,

Your suggestion to convince the CEO to do xxx is the problem. Â Your
recommendation may or may not be the route to go and the organization does
not &quot;own&quot; their way out of their dilemma (which is what? gross margin?).

What are they trying to achieve? higher net earnings, greater market share,
higher profit per employee, more satisfied customers, develop new market
opportunities? Â Is this a public or private company, are they subject to
regulation?

What is the compelling reason for them to do anything different from what
they are currently doing? Â See our blog post on
3M&lt; http://c21org.typepad.com/21st_century_organization/2007/06/what_aile... &gt;

Is anyone accountable or responsible for different results?

I would start with these questions and suggest that the CEO use a
multi-stakeholder (all levels - internal and external) approach to answer
these and other questions. Â Laying the work off on just a few &quot;experts&quot;
internal or external just lets the ownership of the issue (still not clear)
reside away from the organization members who need to be accountable.

A network analysis to follow to identify key stakeholders internal and
external - see what is invisible.

A stakeholder process to create and design what needs to happen, how it will
happen, who will lead, what org design supports, milestones,
metrics/measurement etc. Â based on network analysis. Â Keep iterating so the
organization is constantly adapting to the market.

Large system processes have been around for quite a while with remarkable
results. Â They are hard work, have the advantage of quick pace, involve the
whole system or organization but nothing good comes without some elbow
grease.

Good luck and be glad to continue the discussion.

Regards,

Victoria

Victoria,

interesting insights, thanks!

1) they are a public company in an unregulated industry. Â Their explicit
value proposition is expressed in a form solving for shareholders, with
customers and employees as inputs to the process.

2) one of their flagship products contributes nearly 2/3 of their gross
revenue with a 90% market share and no one competitor is over 5% market
share.

3) the quality of their primary flagship product is very low from a customer
perspective, and they spend a large portion of the gross revenue on a
dial-in customer support group to compensate for the issues lack of quality
causes their customers.

4) the shareholders do not have visibility into the prodigious waste and
&quot;work fare&quot; the company exhibits.

5) the primary beneficiaries of the current operating mode are employees at
all levels who are over-employed (could not possibly find equivalent jobs
for equivalent wages)

6) the customers are unknowingly suffering because they could be benefitting
from better quality and meaningful new product features which could become
available from improved product development

6a) the customers are cognizant of the quality issues and have consistently
issued the company a net-promoter score below 30 for their primary flagship
product.

7) the shareholders are unknowingly suffering because the share price could
easily double if the company chose to be more efficient

The current lever with senior executives is that they are cognizant of the
quality issues in their primary product, and they are fearful that a
credible competitor could enter the market with a higher quality product and
have a strong negative impact on the $1.6B of revenue the product is
generating.

8) the incentive structure at all levels rewards the status quo of 15% yr/yr
growth, and ultimately the only entity &quot;accountable&quot; or &quot;responsible&quot; for
long-term risk is the BOD which has not yet set any meaningful
risk-management goals or rewards for the CEO ... my current assessment is
that none of the existing stakeholders will feel any sense of urgency until
a credible competitor rises and starts eating their lunch, at which point it
is too late to respond in a meaningful fashion.

we did not get to my second question from below,

what are effective means of exploring existing social networks which are
&quot;off the org chart&quot; ?
...

thanks in advance,

Paul

Hi -

Good work fellas and ladies.

Remember the aggregation of the power distribution in the long tail is FAR
greater, persistent and pervasive than the tall part of the curve.

Also, the long tail is not a lifecycle concept; it is about diffusion and
distribution.

For KM to have a long tail, it would need to have an enormous number of
highly diverse applications, that would dwarf the hype-fuelled popular
notions of enterprise portals, document administration and
storage/search/retrieval processes and architectures.

Social media like blogs and wikis definitely fit the long tail. An example
is the staggering number of blogs that only have a few visitors. The
explosion in social network applications and software also exhibits the long
tail phenomenon.

My opinion is the revolution in social media is authentic KM, so yes indeed
you could probably conclude KM has a long tail. There are others, besides
social media, that are beginning to inhabit the long tail of KM. They are
principally led by the social reorientation of work, value networks and
knowledge markets.

However, the grave problem is that most KM people are not fluent and even
fearful of new media and network applications. So in that case, KM
definitely does not have a long tail. KM is still sadly dominated by a
stagnant community having a rigid preoccupation with documents, processes
and information control frameworks.

Meanwhile, concerning network analysis, the discipline is not nearly
pervasive enough to have long tail properties. For example, there is only
one widespread network configuration pattern for a robust knowledge sharing
network. There should be dozens, hundreds really, before it has a long tail.
It is changing rapidly. One big signal of the incredible ascent of value
networks is the pop/mainstream media coverage of business network analysis.
You can read about it in seat-back airline magazines, for heaven's sake!

Specifically concerning value networks and VNA, pull-through and adoption is
normally and successfully led by a key shift in mindset. This is being
accelerated by the early success &amp; popularization of business network
analysis, the new vocabulary and network narratives of business, and the
stunning success of companies and business models that are adopting value
networks.

Look, a decade or more ago KM was populated with top thinkers like Thomas A.
Stewart and JS Brown. Then it was promptly hijacked by odious product
vendors and their well-manicured shills. The top KM thought leaders took
flight for greener pastures. The discipline was then back-filled by legions
of feeble fluffy bunnies. KM leadership was eviscerated, leaving a noble
discipline in shambles, leaderless. The problem is compounded because KM is
afraid of itself, and fails to learn from its staggering mistakes.

(There are some faint signals and distant indications that KM is evolving
out of the morass, but that is a different thread.)

Fortunately, the sharp growth in business network analysis will not follow
this same path for a host of important reasons. For one example, because
value network analysis can only begin with business value leading to
favorable outcomes, VNA assures positive alignment with business model
success, economic growth and environmental well-being. Well executed with
tools and methods like GenIsis it is impossible for it to get off-track, in
the weeds, irrelevant to business, like so many failed KM efforts. In
addition, network science is based on a number of immutable laws and
mathematics, unlike woolly notions of KM. Â Value networks are specific,
natural, innate, living, perpetual, omnipresent -- just there to be
discovered, visualized and optimized for rapid, scalable and dramatic
business performance improvements.

John, the point is not that network analysis is in the long tail, but
that it will have one. Â It is no more the wonder solution than was
KM, it will have its day, it will add value, it will have its
evangelists.

KM on the other hand is in the long tail, it does have diversity. Â I
also think your comments are excessive. Â Many of us (including Tom,
myself Buckman and others) did not and have not deserted KM. Â Yes we
have diversified, but we still practice in the field. Â Verna and I
(along with Buckman) will for example be keynotes at KM Asia. Â I am
writing this from Sydney after keynoting at KM Australia which was
active, vibrant and alive. Â This is less true in the US, but KM World
this year will have its fair share of good interesting people dong
good things. Â I am not prepared to go along with dismissal of KM and
KM people.

Blogs and Wikis are far from in their tail, they are active and the
new social forms are as yet unclear but they will be different. Â The
fact that many do not have visitors is just a reflection of the large
number of players. Â A significant number have significant numbers of
visitors and commentators. Â I see it as an overlapping life cycle
with KM, not a part of it.

Hi â

Thanks for your message.

Please, everyone, letâs drop the silly notions of âwonder-solutions,
cure-all, panacea, magic bullets,â when discussing networks or ANY other
fundamental properties of nature. It is embarrassing. It is also wrong,
provocative and a weak polemic.

Few points.

Value networks already inhabit the long tail, itâs just they have yet to be
discovered. There is serious confusion here from David Snowden, Charles Ehin
and others that somehow networks are another packaged method, technique,
tool or lifecycle. (?) They are not. That is a naÃ¯ve, harmful view.

Networks are innate to all nature and activities. It is problematic when
properties of nature are declared as method. Is gravity a method?

Newsflash: network analysis has been around for well over a half-a-century;
câmon, Dave and Charles, it is hardly new, and you know better, a lot
better. (?)

What is new in value networks are the stunning discoveries, business
improvements, economic growth, environmental health, etc., Â made possible
with broad network mindset &amp; adoption, entirely new network capabilities and
deep network analysis techniques. This includes rigorous benchmarks and
focused specialization in vertical value networks.

Concerning KM, just because it has a rubber-chicken circuit with the same
old speakers year-in and year-out is hardly a fair measure of the viability
of the discipline or health of the community. In fact, it is harmful and
perpetuates todayâs leaden inertia in KM. In my experience, there has been a
material diminishing of the KM leadership aptitude of participants and
speakers over the last ten years. There is fear, rejection of new thinking.
Fact is, KM has become much more akin to risk management than a key
enterprise and business leadership concept.

For example, phony KM people exclaim, âKM is about people!â Then, quite
deliberately and shamelessly, then do their level-best to focus on
documents, processes and commercial information management frameworks. It is
as specious as the CFO proudly saying, âPeople are our greatest asset!â Then
expensing them like annoying costs and overhead, treating them like cogs,
w/o blinking an eye. These counterfeit KM people then flock to
vendor-conferences to self-validate with other phonies. Bunnies LOVE being
around other bunnies. Itâs their nature.

Look, it is not my intention to be harsh or the big bad wolf with a huge
appetite for fresh rabbit. Institutional-style, document-centric, pseudo-KM
is not necessarily bad, since risk management is rqrâd and document control
is an important enterprise regiment. Again, however, it must be noted the
boring, vanilla KM confabulations as described here, and all the KM
self-fulfilling prophecies, contradict a main tenant of KM -- to embrace,
pursue diversity of thinking, practice, outlook and behaviours.

BTW, It is awfully corrupt and deceitful when overly frequent KM âkeynotersâ
claim the viability of their audience. Wow! This is shameful self-promotion
for personal gainâ¦ what a breathtaking sellout.

A large part of the grave KM problem is due to procedure and method fatigue.
Packaged methods attracts the fluffies like fresh, dewy carrots. They repel
innovators, inventors and risk-takers. KM has gone from the sublime to the
ridiculous in just over a decade. It is precisely because of method fatigue,
that the misinformed use derisive terms like âwonder-solution, cure-all,
panacea, magic bulletsâ to describe things the just donât understand (yet).

Meanwhile, it is routine for fossilized community like KM and its embedded,
rigid âkeynoteâ establishment to reject, condemn criticism, to âkill the
messenger.â These KM bullies can really dish it out, but are patently
allergic and hypersensitive to any criticism whatsoever.

BTW, this rejection of criticism, per se, is the main symptom of a terminal
KM community. I take the flak, the return fire, since it is important, and
because the rise of authentic KM like social media, value networks and
knowledge markets provide compelling and innovative new approaches that will
propel KM successfully and permanently into the future.

Finally, there is a lot of confusion about the long tail. It is a simple
concept. The Long Tail was popularized by friend and cluster speaker Chris
Andersen, editor of Wired Magazine. For the benefit of all, TLT was
specifically used to describe, ââ¦a relative handful of weblogs have many
links going into them but &quot;the long tail&quot; of millions of weblogs may have
only a handful of links going into them.â -- &quot;Power Laws, Weblogs and
Inequality&quot; (Shirky). Câmon, if you want to pretend to be keynoters,
scientists or other KM bigshots and authorities, please get your facts
straight.

Cordially,

John, the point is not that network analysis is in the long tail, but that
it will have one. It is no more the wonder solution than was KM, it will
have its day, it will add value, it will have its evangelists.

KM on the other hand is in the long tail, it does have diversity. I also
think your comments are excessive. Many of us (including Tom, myself Buckman
and others) did not and have not deserted KM. Yes we have diversified, but
we still practice in the field. Verna and I (along with Buckman) will for
example be keynotes at KM Asia. I am writing this from Sydney after
keynoting at KM Australia which was active, vibrant and alive. This is less
true in the US, but KM World this year will have its fair share of good
interesting people dong good things. I am not prepared to go along with
dismissal of KM and KM people.

Blogs and Wikis are far from in their tail, they are active and the new
social forms are as yet unclear but they will be different. The fact that
many do not have visitors is just a reflection of the large number of
players. A significant number have significant numbers of visitors and
commentators. I see it as an overlapping life cycle with KM, not a part of
it.

Hi John,

&quot;There is serious confusion here from David Snowden, Charles Ehin and others that somehow networks are another packaged method, technique, tool or lifecycle?&quot; I'll let Dave speak for himself but what I said is that value networks are not the end of the road. Of course they are an extremely valuable methodology and need to be understood and used more widely. At the same time, we also need to be careful in labeling VNA as a universal cure-all or the end of history.

BTW my wife has called some of my views all sorts of things in our 49 years of marriage but never naÃ¯ve or harmful.

Cheers,
Charlie

Hi -

Thanks for your message.

Please, everyone, let's drop the silly notions of &quot;wonder-solutions, cure-all, panacea, magic bullets,&quot; when discussing networks or ANY other fundamental properties of nature. It is embarrassing. It is also wrong, provocative and a weak polemic.

Few points.

Value networks already inhabit the long tail, it's just they have yet to be discovered. There is serious confusion here from David Snowden, Charles Ehin and others that somehow networks are another packaged method, technique, tool or lifecycle. (?) They are not. That is a naÃ¯ve, harmful view.

Networks are innate to all nature and activities. It is problematic when properties of nature are declared as method. Is gravity a method?

Newsflash: network analysis has been around for well over a half-a-century; c'mon, Dave and Charles, it is hardly new, and you know better, a lot better. (?)

What is new in value networks are the stunning discoveries, business improvements, economic growth, environmental health, etc., made possible with broad network mindset &amp; adoption, entirely new network capabilities and deep network analysis techniques. This includes rigorous benchmarks and focused specialization in vertical value networks.

Concerning KM, just because it has a rubber-chicken circuit with the same old speakers year-in and year-out is hardly a fair measure of the viability of the discipline or health of the community. In fact, it is harmful and perpetuates today's leaden inertia in KM.

Long tails: I think that Dave Snowden was wrongly
using the term to mean something like Gartner's
plateau of productivity (or Bunyon's slough of despond
perhaps). And you are right that Chris Anderson uses
it in a specific way. I can dimly perceive how value
networks apply to Anderson's models but how do
participants in the long tail leverage value networks
for their own advantage - more details less rhetoric
please.

No, gravity is a theory about the nature of reality
that we still don't properly understand. Even after
Einstein's work in general relativity, the links
between gravity and the other 3 fundamental forces of
the nature are far from cut and dried. Being subject
to gravity and trying to understand it are two very
different things. The same applies to our models of
human behaviour (of which value networks is one).

I am pleased with your semantic precision regarding
&quot;long tails&quot; but worry that you do not apply the same
rigour to &quot;value networks&quot;. If everything is a value
network then the term loses its power (I also
recognise that wanting to get too anal about these
things is counterproductive).

Either value networks is a bunch of mumbo-jumbo or it
is a set of powerful models &amp; techniques for

believe it is the latter but we'll have to see. And to
an extent Dave is right - many people who will use the
term &quot;value networks&quot; will simply be trying to push
their own perspective of the world which will have
jack to do with networks of any sort.

And yes KM bad, value networks good. Two legs bad,
four legs good. Three bags full. Anything else we need
to clear up?

Here's my take on True Love Networks: Value networks are to social
organization as Bernoulli's principle is to an ideal fluid. Even while
unnamed, unnoticed, and undocumented, the principle helped ships to sail for
hundreds of years. Once studied, documented, and understood, it was widely
applied to yield far greater utility in a much shorter time span.

Hi Matt --

Good message, funny and accurate. Glad some people can take the lighter side
while still being prescient.

Value networks are an exponent, an improvement of network analysis for
business. There is at least 60-years of robust scholarship and empirical
data for network analysis. It is growing exponentially. As mentioned, every
graduate school worth its salt is ramping a network analysis lab and
research capacity.

The solid academic, practice and theoretical foundation inoculates value
networks against the disease of hype; they have been successfully vaccinated
against mumbo-jumbo. Because of a long academic history and deep
scholarship, network analysis does not have the brain parasites that have
incapacitated and ruined contemporary KM.

As mentioned, specific value networks inhabit and exhibit long tail
properties, they just aren't discovered yet, so we are in the rhetorical
stage, if that works for you.

You might get in trouble calling gravity a theory outside physics class. It
is easy to guarantee if you jump of a building you will fall. Same goes --
if you have a heartbeat, you inhabit value networks.

Cheers,

-j

P.S. It would be good for me to develop the patience and perseverance to
elaborate ideas to a wider range of people. It is not a native, natural
behavior like it is for others. We all have our areas for improvement.

Could you be tempted to extend this to greater complexity in

We should be more ambitious!

John, there are times when I find this sort of thing amusing, times
when it is irritating. Â Today it is more the latter. Â Three points:

- If you want to throw around words like naive and harmful feel free
but don't expect to be taken seriously, it is to use your words
&quot;provocative&quot; and a strong &quot;polemic&quot;, so please take your own
medicine before you prescribe it for others.

- I for one would greatly welcome you dropping language which implies
that things you believe in are &quot;wonder-solutions, cure-all, panacea,
magic bullets&quot; and anything you don't like is the preserve of fluffy
bunnies and only worthy of scornful dismissal.

- In my experience the KM community is very open to criticism and I
am afraid I do not recognise your polemical stereotyping as
reflecting Â anything I have seen in that community.

Finally as one of the &quot; overly frequent KM 'keynoters'&quot; and as a
personal friend of the most frequent KM keynotes I find your remarks,
insulting, lacking coherence and plain wrong. Â I don't recognise your
descriptions of people and motivations, not have I seen you in that
space to believe that you have any basis to make the crude statements
you do (but maybe your absence is the issue). Robust debate is one
thing, trivialising a subject by a form of name calling which would
be out of place in a playground, let alone a serious listserv and it
does you little credit.

&gt; fatigue. Packaged methods attracts the fluffies like fresh, dewy
&gt; carrots. They repel innovators, inventors and risk-takers. KM has
&gt; gone from the sublime to the ridiculous in just over a decade. It
&gt; is precisely because of method fatigue, that the misinformed use
&gt; derisive terms like &quot;wonder-solution, cure-all, panacea, magic
&gt; bullets&quot; to describe things the just don't understand (yet).

&gt; Meanwhile, it is routine for fossilized community like KM and its
&gt; embedded, rigid 'keynote' establishment to reject, condemn
&gt; criticism, to 'kill the messenger.' These KM bullies can really
&gt; dish it out, but are patently allergic and hypersensitive to any
&gt; criticism whatsoever.

&gt; BTW, this rejection of criticism, per se, is the main symptom of a
&gt; terminal KM community. I take the flak, the return fire, since it
&gt; is important, and because the rise of authentic KM like social
&gt; media, value networks and knowledge markets provide compelling and
&gt; innovative new approaches that will propel KM successfully and
&gt; permanently into the future.

&gt; Finally, there is a lot of confusion about the long tail. It is a
&gt; simple concept. The Long Tail was popularized by friend and cluster
&gt; speaker Chris Andersen, editor of Wired Magazine. For the benefit
&gt; of all, TLT was specifically used to describe, &quot;...a relative handful
&gt; of weblogs have many links going into them but &quot;the long tail&quot; of
&gt; millions of weblogs may have only a handful of links going into
&gt; them.&quot; -- &quot;Power Laws, Weblogs and Inequality&quot; (Shirky). C'mon, if
&gt; you want to pretend to be keynoters, scientists or other KM
&gt; bigshots and authorities, please get your facts straight.

&gt; John, the point is not that network analysis is in the long tail,
&gt; but that it will have one. It is no more the wonder solution than
&gt; was KM, it will have its day, it will add value, it will have its
&gt; evangelists.

&gt; KM on the other hand is in the long tail, it does have diversity. I
&gt; also think your comments are excessive. Many of us (including Tom,
&gt; myself Buckman and others) did not and have not deserted KM. Yes we
&gt; have diversified, but we still practice in the field. Verna and I
&gt; (along with Buckman) will for example be keynotes at KM Asia. I am
&gt; writing this from Sydney after keynoting at KM Australia which was
&gt; active, vibrant and alive. This is less true in the US, but KM
&gt; World this year will have its fair share of good interesting people
&gt; dong good things. I am not prepared to go along with dismissal of
&gt; KM and KM people.

&gt; Blogs and Wikis are far from in their tail, they are active and the
&gt; new social forms are as yet unclear but they will be different. The
&gt; fact that many do not have visitors is just a reflection of the
&gt; large number of players. A significant number have significant
&gt; numbers of visitors and commentators. I see it as an overlapping

No, Dave was using it to describe the way in which KM is extending
its life through multiple mutations, extensions into different
technologies (including as technology components). Â The phrase &quot;long
tail&quot; existed before it was applied to web logs, and has of recent
years been used extensively to describe a new approach to
understanding adoption curves.

Favorite posting of the day is Matt's. Made me LoL. Thanks.

I appreciate the way the group &quot;holds&quot; the intelligent thread of the
discussion and helps us navigate toward a more inviting kind of
discourse. I especially appreciate the persistence of the Davids,
Charles et al in sorting through sometimes very long postings to find
the nuggets. (Wow, Charles, 40+ years - that is a very special
relationship indeed!)

John, I do appreciate the very human learning note in your last
posting where (almost lost as a PS) you said:

&quot;P.S. It would be good for me to develop the patience and perseverance
to
elaborate ideas to a wider range of people. It is not a native,
natural
behavior like it is for others. We all have our areas for
improvement.&quot;

It is quite surprising how different your postings sound (not always
in a good way) when written on a discussion board than when you
express your ideas in person, where you are consistently effective.
Your earlier posting was a bit over the top. But you do get people
going...

Cheers,
Verna

&gt; John, there are times when I find this sort of thing amusing, times

&gt; - If you want to throw around words like naive and harmful feel free
&gt; but don't expect to be taken seriously, it is to use your words
&gt; &quot;provocative&quot; and a strong &quot;polemic&quot;, so please take your own

&gt; - I for one would greatly welcome you dropping language which implies

&gt; - In my experience the KM community is very open to criticism and I
&gt; am afraid I do not recognise your polemical stereotyping as
&gt; reflecting Â anything I have seen in that community.

&gt; Finally as one of the &quot; overly frequent KM 'keynoters'&quot; and as a
&gt; personal friend of the most frequent KM keynotes I find your remarks,
&gt; insulting, lacking coherence and plain wrong. Â I don't recognise your
&gt; descriptions of people and motivations, not have I seen you in that
&gt; space to believe that you have any basis to make the crude statements
&gt; you do (but maybe your absence is the issue). Robust debate is one

&gt; &gt; Hi -

&gt; &gt; Thanks for your message.

&gt; &gt; Please, everyone, let's drop the silly notions of &quot;wonder-
&gt; &gt; solutions, cure-all, panacea, magic bullets,&quot; when discussing
&gt; &gt; networks or ANY other fundamental properties of nature. It is
&gt; &gt; embarrassing. It is also wrong, provocative and a weak polemic.

&gt; &gt; Few points.

&gt; &gt; Value networks already inhabit the long tail, it's just they have
&gt; &gt; yet to be discovered. There is serious confusion here from David
&gt; &gt; Snowden, Charles Ehin and others that somehow networks are another
&gt; &gt; packaged method, technique, tool or lifecycle. (?) They are not.
&gt; &gt; That is a naÃ¯ve, harmful view.

&gt; &gt; Networks are innate to all nature and activities. It is problematic
&gt; &gt; when properties of nature are declared as method. Is gravity a method?

&gt; &gt; Newsflash: network analysis has been around for well over a half-a-
&gt; &gt; century; c'mon, Dave and Charles, it is hardly new, and you know
&gt; &gt; better, a lot better. (?)

&gt; &gt; What is new in value networks are the stunning discoveries,
&gt; &gt; business improvements, economic growth, environmental health, etc.,
&gt; &gt; made possible with broad network mindset &amp; adoption, entirely new
&gt; &gt; network capabilities and deep network analysis techniques. This
&gt; &gt; includes rigorous benchmarks and focused specialization in vertical
&gt; &gt; value networks.

&gt; &gt; Concerning KM, just because it has a rubber-chicken circuit with
&gt; &gt; the same old speakers year-in and year-out is hardly a fair measure
&gt; &gt; of the viability of the discipline or health of the community. In
&gt; &gt; fact, it is harmful and perpetuates today's leaden inertia in KM.
&gt; &gt; In my experience, there has been a material diminishing of the KM
&gt; &gt; leadership aptitude of participants and speakers over the last ten
&gt; &gt; years. There is fear, rejection of new thinking. Fact is, KM has
&gt; &gt; become much more akin to risk management than a key enterprise and
&gt; &gt; business leadership concept.

&gt; &gt; For example, phony KM people exclaim, &quot;KM is about people!&quot; Then,
&gt; &gt; quite deliberately and shamelessly, then do their level-best to
&gt; &gt; focus on documents, processes and commercial information management
&gt; &gt; frameworks. It is as specious as the CFO proudly saying, &quot;People
&gt; &gt; are our greatest asset!&quot; Then expensing them like annoying costs
&gt; &gt; and overhead, treating them like cogs, w/o blinking an eye. These
&gt; &gt; counterfeit KM people then flock to vendor-conferences to self-
&gt; &gt; validate with other phonies. Bunnies LOVE being around other
&gt; &gt; bunnies. It's their nature.

&gt; &gt; Look, it is not my intention to be harsh or the big bad wolf with a
&gt; &gt; huge appetite for fresh rabbit. Institutional-style, document-
&gt; &gt; centric, pseudo-KM is not necessarily bad, since risk management is
&gt; &gt; rqr'd and document control is an important enterprise regiment.
&gt; &gt; Again, however, it must be noted the boring, vanilla KM
&gt; &gt; confabulations as described here, and all the KM self-fulfilling
&gt; &gt; prophecies, contradict a main tenant of KM -- to embrace, pursue
&gt; &gt; diversity of thinking, practice, outlook and behaviours.

&gt; &gt; BTW, It is awfully corrupt and deceitful when overly frequent KM
&gt; &gt; 'keynoters' claim the viability of their audience. Wow! This is
&gt; &gt; shameful self-promotion for personal gain... what a breathtaking
&gt; &gt; sellout.

&gt; &gt; A large part of the grave KM problem is due to procedure and method
&gt; &gt; fatigue. Packaged methods attracts the fluffies like fresh, dewy
&gt; &gt; carrots. They repel innovators, inventors and risk-takers. KM has

What little I know of Navier-Stokes holds out some intriguing possibilities
if applied to rates of social structuring and change. But as more of a

The more I read, the more I see Dave as a command and control extended person and John as a command and control release person. (holy grail of liberty)

I am observing you two fellows coming into completion of one another's life time investment.
Once completed, humanity will benefit from a breakthrough of the first technological step into the universal passage from stranger to family, connecting the facts of history with the intangibles of destiny, leading the discipline from local to global, leading the way in the full view from micro to macro with the maturity of the Open Source Movement...

It is in anticipation of such a picture of the future, in which militancy melts into radiance, that I seek to develop contemplative thoughts such as The Ancient Voice of Humanity's Youth meeting with The Quietening Silence of Patient Wisdom.

&gt; that we still don't properly understand. Even after
&gt; Einstein's work in general relativity, the links
&gt; between gravity and the other 3 fundamental forces of
&gt; the nature are far from cut and dried. Being subject
&gt; to gravity and trying to understand it are two very
&gt; different things. The same applies to our models of
&gt; human behaviour (of which value networks is one).

&gt; I am pleased with your semantic precision regarding
&gt; &quot;long tails&quot; but worry that you do not apply the same
&gt; rigour to &quot;value networks&quot;. If everything is a value
&gt; network then the term loses its power (I also
&gt; recognise that wanting to get too anal about these
&gt; things is counterproductive).

&gt; Either value networks is a bunch of mumbo-jumbo or it
&gt; is a set of powerful models &amp; techniques for
&gt; understanding the world &amp; then acting in it. Now I
&gt; believe it is the latter but we'll have to see. And to
&gt; an extent Dave is right - many people who will use the
&gt; term &quot;value networks&quot; will simply be trying to push
&gt; their own perspective of the world which will have
&gt; jack to do with networks of any sort.

&gt; And yes KM bad, value networks good. Two legs bad,
&gt; four legs good. Three bags full. Anything else we need
&gt; to clear up?

John,

So your basic argument is: &quot;It could never happen
here?&quot;

If you say so, papa bear.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The solid academic, practice and theoretical

Hi â

Thanks Dave and others.

It is reassuring when there are such obvious, easy confirmations of
observations. Most startling and disturbing is the rejection of simple
criticism from people in the rigid KM establishment. It is proof positive of
their unctuous sellout and pandering to failed KM.

David (Snowden) you are well-known, popular KM bully. Thatâs fine. We donât
care, and welcome, encourage and expect your (mostly) fine contributions all
the same and all the time. Part of your bullying is to summarily reject
criticism and wishing to appear always correct. That is also fine, but if
you are going to kick sand, bait people, it is important that you back up
your bullying with solid, or at least accurate facts, so that we can learn
and develop. Your need to know your factual errors, emotional responses and
ad hominem positions in listservs distract from the important principles
under discussion. On the flip side, your thoughtful contributions counteract
the downside, so it is pretty much a wash. BTW, everyone here would benefit
from the mostly excellent Cognitive-Edge Blog.

http://www.cognitive-edge.com/

Anyway, some comments and specifics.

Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  &quot;wonder-solutions, cure-all, panacea, magic bullets&quot; â are
derisive words from YOU and your ilk like Charles; it IS harmful for YOU to
use these foolish words to bait people; Â give yourself a break; get your
fact straight; talk a walk, get some air. Also, we would all âgreatly
welcomeâ you and Charles having a closer relationship with facts and your
prior statements here. Remember: your posts here are retrievable. Also, the
is a Value Networks Group. Interest and enthusiasm for the this theme is to
be expected. There are plenty of generic KM groups to join.

Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  Again, the specific pattern here is your grave errors of fact and
errors of omission; open your eyes, contemporary KM has failed as a
leadership concept; it is like enterprise IT -- KM is operational document
housekeeping, a risk management task. As said, contemporary KM is just not
strategic, leadership or even business-oriented.

Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  The irony and disappointment of this foolishness is that you are
much more needed as a speaker and thought leader at the over-capacity,
standing-room-only Enterprise and Web â2.0â events, not KM conferences. By
in large it will be impossible for waning KM people to do anything with your
important principles. If thatâs okay with you, fine. Adoption would be a lot
faster in an authentic business leadership community, outside of KM. My
advice? Get your agent or bureau to book you speaking gigs at real-world
conferences.

Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  KM rejects criticism. Donât believe me? Just visit ACT-KM or AOK.

Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  Dave, thanks, but you popularized âfluffy bunniesâ as your own
stereotype of silly KM people; nice work, it stuck. Please donât try and
revise the origins of your stereotyping. Remember: your posts here are
retrievable.

Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  Again, as said, the rubber-chicken KM Conferences and the keynotes
cover the same material year-in, year-out, with little or no innovation;
they are boring presentation modalities where counterfeit speakers commerce
in KM pap without being challenged. Note: there has been very little/no new
KM publishing, journals, magazines, blogs, projects, discussions or books;
contemporary KM is declining rapidly.

Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  It IS naÃ¯ve and harmful to be glib about the networks and network
analysis; Dave and others, the network and relationship revolution this is
not some wooly Powerpoint; it is not a take it or leave it proposition;
network analysis is NOT new; it has at least 60-years of empirical research,
breakthrough scholarship and refined practice.

Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  People here are far too clever to empathize with the imaginary
internecine method challenges facing personalities like Dave S.; this group
continues its fast growth; people discover and join here to discover and
adopt value networks and network analysis.

Allow me to summarize the specific points in this recent exchange in an
effort to try and discharge some of the emotional outbursts (and good
points) by Dave and others and to stay within the important content theme
boundaries here â

1. Â  Â Networks are innate; network analysis is not new.

2. Â  Â A network perspective is not a method, practice or procedure; it is a
mindset.

3. Â  Â Networks are highly diverse; as discovered they adopt a long tail
configuration.

4. Â  Â Network analysis is no more a panacea that x-ray or MRI are cure-alls.

5. Â  Â At the moment, KM is stale, lifeless, allergic to critique. It is akin
to corporate IT and risk management.

6. Â  Â The KM establishment props up failed practices; KM conferences are
incestuous; speakers &amp; organizers are sellouts.

7. Â  Â Method fatigue has set in; it hurts comprehension and adoption of new
concepts; old habits die hard.

8. Â  Â Value networks represent a critical business, economic, societal and
environmental leadership imperative.

9. Â  Â Social media, value networks and knowledge markets provide compelling
and innovative new approaches for KM.

Look, some people may find the enthusiasm and passion here a bit
uncomfortable, painful. Easily, by now, for example, David and Charles would
have been admonished, moderated or even dismissed (âbannedâ) as can and does
happen elsewhere, on other groups, for factual inaccuracies and ad hominem
replies.

However, this important, fast growing value networks group is much
different. The fireworks emerge from the fundamental reorientation of work
from task to relationship and from process to network. These are enormous,
difficult transformations. They rock the status quo. All are welcome,
encouraged to contribute. Beware, through, the fur will fly and feathers
will be ruffled. There is substantial disequilibrium at the moment. Thatâs
okay, but fasten your seatbelt, it might be a bumpy ride. It is all part and
parcel of progress, advancement and creating the future!

Cheers,

-j

John,

You state, &quot;Look, some people may find the enthusiasm and passion here a bit uncomfortable, painful. Easily, by now, for example, David and Charles would have been admonished, moderated or even dismissed ('banned') as can and does happen elsewhere, on other groups, for factual inaccuracies and ad hominem replies.&quot; I'd like to know what you're smoking. &quot;...factual inaccuracies and ad hominem replies?&quot; I don't know what you're talking about unless whatever you say/write is ALWAYS 100% correct.

I'm sorry but I think you've finally gone over the edge. You call Dave a bully but the real bully faces you in the mirror everyday. You are not addressing a bunch of kindergartners here. Have a little respect for others as much as you demand it yourself. Also please don't threaten me. If you want to &quot;ban&quot; me that's your prerogative but please don't play word games with me. I've dodged real bombs and bullets so your snippets don't add up to much.

Charlie

&gt;&gt; Long tails: I think that Dave Snowden was wrongly

&gt;&gt; perhaps). And you are right that Chris Anderson uses
&gt;&gt; it in a specific way. I can dimly perceive how value
&gt;&gt; networks apply to Anderson's models but how do
&gt;&gt; participants in the long tail leverage value networks
&gt;&gt; for their own advantage - more details less rhetoric
&gt;&gt; please.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Networks are innate to all nature and activities. It

Damn it! I'm going to start my own value networks
list. Only the cool kids can join and everyone will
agree with me and it'll be great and not at all like
high school.

BTW Anybody have any comments about the Web 2.0 &amp;

John, you have an ability to see the mote in other people's eyes
while not seeing the log in your own

You were grossly insulting to many people for whom I have great
respect, if you treat my defending them in this dismissive way then
there is little hope of dialogue. Â  I have not objection to you
throwing stuff at me, but leave the other guys out of it - OK?

&gt; Hi -

&gt; Thanks Dave and others.

&gt; It is reassuring when there are such obvious, easy confirmations of
&gt; observations. Most startling and disturbing is the rejection of
&gt; simple criticism from people in the rigid KM establishment. It is
&gt; proof positive of their unctuous sellout and pandering to failed KM.

&gt; David (Snowden) you are well-known, popular KM bully. That's fine.
&gt; We don't care, and welcome, encourage and expect your (mostly) fine
&gt; contributions all the same and all the time. Part of your bullying
&gt; is to summarily reject criticism and wishing to appear always
&gt; correct. That is also fine, but if you are going to kick sand, bait
&gt; people, it is important that you back up your bullying with solid,
&gt; or at least accurate facts, so that we can learn and develop. Your
&gt; need to know your factual errors, emotional responses and ad
&gt; hominem positions in listservs distract from the important
&gt; principles under discussion. On the flip side, your thoughtful
&gt; contributions counteract the downside, so it is pretty much a wash.
&gt; BTW, everyone here would benefit from the mostly excellent
&gt; Cognitive-Edge Blog.

&gt; http://www.cognitive-edge.com/

&gt; Anyway, some comments and specifics.

&gt; Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  &quot;wonder-solutions, cure-all, panacea, magic bullets&quot; -
&gt; are derisive words from YOU and your ilk like Charles; it IS
&gt; harmful for YOU to use these foolish words to bait people; give
&gt; yourself a break; get your fact straight; talk a walk, get some
&gt; air. Also, we would all 'greatly welcome' you and Charles having a
&gt; closer relationship with facts and your prior statements here.
&gt; Remember: your posts here are retrievable. Also, the is a Value
&gt; Networks Group. Interest and enthusiasm for the this theme is to be
&gt; expected. There are plenty of generic KM groups to join.

&gt; Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  Again, the specific pattern here is your grave errors of
&gt; fact and errors of omission; open your eyes, contemporary KM has
&gt; failed as a leadership concept; it is like enterprise IT -- KM is
&gt; operational document housekeeping, a risk management task. As said,
&gt; contemporary KM is just not strategic, leadership or even business-
&gt; oriented.

&gt; Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  The irony and disappointment of this foolishness is that
&gt; you are much more needed as a speaker and thought leader at the
&gt; over-capacity, standing-room-only Enterprise and Web '2.0' events,
&gt; not KM conferences. By in large it will be impossible for waning KM
&gt; people to do anything with your important principles. If that's
&gt; okay with you, fine. Adoption would be a lot faster in an authentic
&gt; business leadership community, outside of KM. My advice? Get your
&gt; agent or bureau to book you speaking gigs at real-world conferences.

&gt; Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  KM rejects criticism. Don't believe me? Just visit ACT-KM
&gt; or AOK.

&gt; Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  Dave, thanks, but you popularized 'fluffy bunnies' as
&gt; your own stereotype of silly KM people; nice work, it stuck. Please
&gt; don't try and revise the origins of your stereotyping. Remember:
&gt; your posts here are retrievable.

&gt; Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  Again, as said, the rubber-chicken KM Conferences and the
&gt; keynotes cover the same material year-in, year-out, with little or
&gt; no innovation; they are boring presentation modalities where
&gt; counterfeit speakers commerce in KM pap without being challenged.
&gt; Note: there has been very little/no new KM publishing, journals,
&gt; magazines, blogs, projects, discussions or books; contemporary KM
&gt; is declining rapidly.

&gt; Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  It IS naÃ¯ve and harmful to be glib about the networks and
&gt; network analysis; Dave and others, the network and relationship
&gt; revolution this is not some wooly Powerpoint; it is not a take it
&gt; or leave it proposition; network analysis is NOT new; it has at
&gt; least 60-years of empirical research, breakthrough scholarship and
&gt; refined practice.

&gt; Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  People here are far too clever to empathize with the
&gt; imaginary internecine method challenges facing personalities like
&gt; Dave S.; this group continues its fast growth; people discover and
&gt; join here to discover and adopt value networks and network analysis.

&gt; Allow me to summarize the specific points in this recent exchange
&gt; in an effort to try and discharge some of the emotional outbursts
&gt; (and good points) by Dave and others and to stay within the
&gt; important content theme boundaries here -

&gt; 1. Â  Â Networks are innate; network analysis is not new.
&gt; 2. Â  Â A network perspective is not a method, practice or procedure;
&gt; it is a mindset.
&gt; 3. Â  Â Networks are highly diverse; as discovered they adopt a long
&gt; tail configuration.
&gt; 4. Â  Â Network analysis is no more a panacea that x-ray or MRI are
&gt; cure-alls.
&gt; 5. Â  Â At the moment, KM is stale, lifeless, allergic to critique.
&gt; It is akin to corporate IT and risk management.
&gt; 6. Â  Â The KM establishment props up failed practices; KM
&gt; conferences are incestuous; speakers &amp; organizers are sellouts.
&gt; 7. Â  Â Method fatigue has set in; it hurts comprehension and
&gt; adoption of new concepts; old habits die hard.
&gt; 8. Â  Â Value networks represent a critical business, economic,
&gt; societal and environmental leadership imperative.
&gt; 9. Â  Â Social media, value networks and knowledge markets provide
&gt; compelling and innovative new approaches for KM.

&gt; Look, some people may find the enthusiasm and passion here a bit
&gt; uncomfortable, painful. Easily, by now, for example, David and
&gt; Charles would have been admonished, moderated or even dismissed
&gt; ('banned') as can and does happen elsewhere, on other groups, for
&gt; factual inaccuracies and ad hominem replies.

&gt; However, this important, fast growing value networks group is much
&gt; different. The fireworks emerge from the fundamental reorientation
&gt; of work from task to relationship and from process to network.
&gt; These are enormous, difficult transformations. They rock the status
&gt; quo. All are welcome, encouraged to contribute. Beware, through,
&gt; the fur will fly and feathers will be ruffled. There is substantial
&gt; disequilibrium at the moment. That's okay, but fasten your
&gt; seatbelt, it might be a bumpy ride. It is all part and parcel of
&gt; progress, advancement and creating the future!

Damn it! I'm going to start my own value networks

agree with me and it'll be great and not at all like
high school.

BTW Anybody have any comments about the Web 2.0 &amp;

Dave,

By the word &quot;judgment&quot;, I take it that you mean &quot;discernment&quot; as opposed to &quot;trial and sentence&quot;.
Given the context that the future of humanity is presently with its back up against the wall, then sooner or later, no matter how uncomfortable it may be for the ego(s), necessity's order of survival will cause polarity such as you and John to fight the same battle, because genuine intelligence will no longer have the luxury of avoiding or dismiss each other. Â Intelligence is already causing the two of you to face such reality and to slug it out. Â I see such activity as the first steps in the emergence of the Personal Sector.

The other word that you recommend that I reflect upon is &quot;categorization...&quot;
I think that this is where many experts will have to adapt much of the expertise, which Â will cause many to learn simplification of unneeded goods and services' complexities the hard way.

Because of the global context, I see time itself causing you and John to eventually recognize how valuable your teaming up can be for the future itself, and not because of what you wish or not.

I am observing you two fellows coming into completion of one another's life time investment.
Once completed, humanity will benefit from a breakthrough of the first technological step into the universal passage from stranger to family, connecting the facts of history with the intangibles of destiny, leading the discipline from local to global, leading the way in the full view from micro to macro with the maturity of the Open Source Movement...

It is in anticipation of such a picture of the future, in which militancy melts into radiance, that I seek to develop contemplative thoughts such as The Ancient Voice of Humanity's Youth meeting with The Quietening Silence of Patient Wisdom.

No, Dave was using it to describe the way in which KM is extending its life through multiple mutations, extensions into different technologies (including as technology components). The phrase &quot;long tail&quot; existed before it was applied to web logs, and has of recent years been used extensively to describe a new approach to understanding adoption curves.

John,

Long tails: I think that Dave Snowden was wrongly
using the term to mean something like Gartner's
plateau of productivity (or Bunyon's slough of despond
perhaps). And you are right that Chris Anderson uses
it in a specific way. I can dimly perceive how value
networks apply to Anderson's models but how do
participants in the long tail leverage value networks
for their own advantage - more details less rhetoric
please.

Networks are innate to all nature and activities. It
is problematic when
properties of nature are declared as method. Is
gravity a method?

No, gravity is a theory about the nature of reality
that we still don't properly understand. Even after
Einstein's work in general relativity, the links
between gravity and the other 3 fundamental forces of
the nature are far from cut and dried. Being subject
to gravity and trying to understand it are two very
different things. The same applies to our models of
human behaviour (of which value networks is one).

I am pleased with your semantic precision regarding
&quot;long tails&quot; but worry that you do not apply the same
rigour to &quot;value networks&quot;. If everything is a value
network then the term loses its power (I also
recognise that wanting to get too anal about these
things is counterproductive).

Either value networks is a bunch of mumbo-jumbo or it
is a set of powerful models &amp; techniques for
understanding the world &amp; then acting in it. Now I
believe it is the latter but we'll have to see. And to
an extent Dave is right - many people who will use the
term &quot;value networks&quot; will simply be trying to push
their own perspective of the world which will have
jack to do with networks of any sort.

And yes KM bad, value networks good. Two legs bad,
four legs good. Three bags full. Anything else we need
to clear up?

Matt

Hi Dave -

Thanks. Look, personally, I have easily led, organized, sponsored, keynoted,
participated in more KM events and structured KM confabulations in the last
decade than all the people here and that you speak of combined. Any
indictment of contemporary KM is a cold examination of KM, our roles,
including my own, and the trajectory of the discipline. Needless to say
again, it's not a pretty picture. The opinion advanced is mostly a consensus
of leaders; there simply has been a material flight from KM of good
leadership. It is not so bad for a discipline to go into reset; particularly
when it is infested with self-fulfilling prophesies and weak, craven
leadership. Again, KM preaches change management, yet when faced with own
change and transformation, it falls down badly. You have been very
instrumental in raising the KM bar, and you have a lot of arrows in your
back to show for it. You can continue if you think the patient will recover.
Frankly, IMO, science and leadership for traditional KM practices have
consolidate around other domains outside of KM like value networks, markets,
narrative, complexity and media, and it might make sense to give them your
focus, instead of fighting a losing battle.

Cheers,

&gt;&gt; I am observing you two fellows coming into completion of one
&gt;&gt; another's life time investment.
&gt;&gt; Once completed, humanity will benefit from a breakthrough of the
&gt;&gt; first technological step into the universal passage from stranger
&gt;&gt; to family, connecting the facts of history with the intangibles of
&gt;&gt; destiny, leading the discipline from local to global, leading the
&gt;&gt; way in the full view from micro to macro with the maturity of the
&gt;&gt; Open Source Movement...
&gt;&gt; It is in anticipation of such a picture of the future, in which
&gt;&gt; militancy melts into radiance, that I seek to develop
&gt;&gt; contemplative thoughts such as The Ancient Voice of Humanity's
&gt;&gt; Youth meeting with The Quietening Silence of Patient Wisdom.

&gt;&gt;&gt; John,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Long tails: I think that Dave Snowden was wrongly
&gt;&gt;&gt; using the term to mean something like Gartner's
&gt;&gt;&gt; plateau of productivity (or Bunyon's slough of despond
&gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps). And you are right that Chris Anderson uses
&gt;&gt;&gt; it in a specific way. I can dimly perceive how value
&gt;&gt;&gt; networks apply to Anderson's models but how do
&gt;&gt;&gt; participants in the long tail leverage value networks
&gt;&gt;&gt; for their own advantage - more details less rhetoric
&gt;&gt;&gt; please.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Networks are innate to all nature and activities. It
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is problematic when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; properties of nature are declared as method. Is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gravity a method?

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, gravity is a theory about the nature of reality
&gt;&gt;&gt; that we still don't properly understand. Even after
&gt;&gt;&gt; Einstein's work in general relativity, the links
&gt;&gt;&gt; between gravity and the other 3 fundamental forces of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the nature are far from cut and dried. Being subject
&gt;&gt;&gt; to gravity and trying to understand it are two very
&gt;&gt;&gt; different things. The same applies to our models of
&gt;&gt;&gt; human behaviour (of which value networks is one).

&gt;&gt;&gt; I am pleased with your semantic precision regarding
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;long tails&quot; but worry that you do not apply the same
&gt;&gt;&gt; rigour to &quot;value networks&quot;. If everything is a value
&gt;&gt;&gt; network then the term loses its power (I also
&gt;&gt;&gt; recognise that wanting to get too anal about these
&gt;&gt;&gt; things is counterproductive).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Either value networks is a bunch of mumbo-jumbo or it
&gt;&gt;&gt; is a set of powerful models &amp; techniques for
&gt;&gt;&gt; understanding the world &amp; then acting in it. Now I
&gt;&gt;&gt; believe it is the latter but we'll have to see. And to
&gt;&gt;&gt; an extent Dave is right - many people who will use the
&gt;&gt;&gt; term &quot;value networks&quot; will simply be trying to push
&gt;&gt;&gt; their own perspective of the world which will have
&gt;&gt;&gt; jack to do with networks of any sort.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And yes KM bad, value networks good. Two legs bad,
&gt;&gt;&gt; four legs good. Three bags full. Anything else we need
&gt;&gt;&gt; to clear up?

I am a management consultant and lurker on this group, so I guess I
have two strikes against me already. Â But I am surprised and confused
by the venom and antipathy that is sometimes shown between KM and
Value Networks on this group.

Aren't we all members of the same team?

These days, I (and many of my colleagues) think of KM or knowledge
management as a collective noun for the techniques and body of
knowledge that managers need focus on to be successful and create
value in the knowledge era.

Understanding value networks, analysing them and guiding them are some
of the elements of this toolbox known collectively as knowledge
management. Â Where is the conflict?

I understand that many might be unhappy with this wide definition of
knowledge management, but I have found it to be much more successful
in describing what KM is and how it is practised than many of the
narrower attempts.

Let's not get bogged down on defining or mis-defining this or the
other. Â I think we all agree that management focus is changing, and
has to change. Â There are many perspectives on how this change can be
accomplished with no universal truth (or if there is - it is yet to be
discovered, or at least explained to me).

tentatively,

Mark

&gt; Hi -

&gt; It is reassuring when there are such obvious, easy confirmations of

&gt; David (Snowden) you are well-known, popular KM bully. That's fine. We don't

&gt; ad hominem positions in listservs distract from the important principles

&gt; the downside, so it is pretty much a wash. BTW, everyone here would benefit

&gt; Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  Again, the specific pattern here is your grave errors of fact and

&gt; strategic, leadership or even business-oriented.

&gt; Â· Â  Â  Â  Â  The irony and disappointment of this foolishness is that you are
&gt; much more needed as a speaker and thought leader at the over-capacity,
&gt; standing-room-only Enterprise and Web '2.0' events, not KM conferences. By
&gt; in large it will be impossible for waning KM people to do anything with your
&gt; important principles. If that's okay with you, fine. Adoption would be a lot
&gt; faster in an authentic business leadership community, outside of KM. My

&gt; continues its fast growth; people discover and join here to discover and
&gt; adopt value networks and network analysis.

&gt; Allow me to summarize the specific points in this recent exchange in an
&gt; effort to try and discharge some of the emotional outbursts (and good
&gt; points) by Dave and others and to stay within the important content theme
&gt; boundaries here -

&gt; 1. Â  Â Networks are innate; network analysis is not new.

&gt; 2. Â  Â A network perspective is not a method, practice or procedure; it is a

&gt; 9. Â  Â Social media, value networks and knowledge markets provide compelling
&gt; and innovative new approaches for KM.

&gt; Look, some people may find the enthusiasm and passion here a bit
&gt; uncomfortable, painful. Easily, by now, for example, David and Charles would
&gt; have been admonished, moderated or even dismissed ('banned') as can and does
&gt; happen elsewhere, on other groups, for factual inaccuracies and ad hominem
&gt; replies.

&gt; However, this important, fast growing value networks group is much
&gt; different. The fireworks emerge from the fundamental reorientation of work
&gt; from task to relationship and from process to network. These are enormous,
&gt; difficult transformations. They rock the status quo. All are welcome,
&gt; encouraged to contribute. Beware, through, the fur will fly and feathers
&gt; will be ruffled. There is substantial disequilibrium at the moment. That's
&gt; okay, but fasten your seatbelt, it might be a bumpy ride. It is all part and

Mark,

It's great to see a contribution...keep them coming!

As a management consultant you will be involved in changing things. So
a thought for you....

Refer to a rather excellent book called &quot;Exploring Strategic Change&quot;
by Julia Balogun and Veronica Hope Hailey.
and, in particular, the final chapter &quot;Concluding Comments&quot;.

They refer to the content of the book as largely covering top down
change, but then raise the issue of what organisations will be like in
the future, based on (guess what) change bubbling up from people who
are in contact with the markets. They go on to describe approaches for
handling continuous change with an eye on what is labelled the &quot;ideas
lens&quot; in a &quot;sister&quot; Â text &quot;Exploring Corporate Strategy&quot;. Â The
language used resonates all the way through with the that of value
networks, although it is not mentioned.

Now a personal comment: I would much rather accept the challenge of
introducing a new way of perceiving the way things &quot;really&quot; are via VN/
A than attempt whatever &quot;corrections&quot; are needed in the KM fold and
then introduce VN/A type thinking through that.

I am much happier, personally, reintroducing knowledge based
strategies if needed via VN/A, which can be done (see above). At least
with VN/A there are few preconceptions as yet as to what it is.

However, along with other thoughtleaders (in this list) you may wish
to &quot;re-educate&quot; your KM colleagues as a special calling.

Just a thought..D

Dave,

If that is so, I am now more confused than I thought. Â How can I possibly exercise trial and sentence of any kind in a place like here?
I might be coming across as judgemental as a result of having lived with my back up against the wall of poverty and insanity for so long, working in the hope to see a great social healing, that I now see mirages of hope and of brightness potentials, such as a future where intelligence does come together to assemble lost egos, connecting humans up from beyond our personal capacity for deceit and evil production that keeps existence and business going on as usual, keeping the powers that be so busy with the complexity of mistrust and conflicts, that any accountability to life itself becomes irrelevant to decision making.
Much complexities can and must be done away with, if sanity is to appear on the local-global future's landscape. Â Resistance to the reconciliation's path and progress is a dishonor to intelligence, no matter who does it. Â To me, that is a basis in reality, strong enough to discern how to maintain contact and at which proximity in order to stay within acceptable comfort and security.
So in that sense, we are both right, I do judge from discernment. Â By both staying free from sentencing, that becomes a relationship. Â I thank God that I have no power of sentencing and that I do have the power to forgive and to deliver from what is being forgiven..

Sooner or later, such intelligence must be yielded to, or else, the awareness of sanity disappear, without one being aware of the disappearance. Â That is the point at which simplicity of the connection with the whole grows on more and more complex in order to justify ones existence. Â The more power one exerts in that direction and the more complex and detached everything becomes from the whole.
So far, I've witnessed you go on to justify complexity instead of moving toward the simplicity of connectivity between the whole and the parts. Â John is also king of the hill in his own way and from how I read him, he's had it enough with the isolation and insanity caused by complexity, that he goes on provoking a reaction against a future with no horizon, but war, war, war and disasters of all kinds, against which humanity needs to rally, for we are not prepared to face what is coming up.
Where is the opening for the assembling of the parts with the whole to grow complete, healthy and functional if we remain closed to reconciliation? Â What is the point of any Value-Networks if the fundamental worth of life is not the primary focus?
Because of his name calling, John and others need reconciliation. Â Can we not all learn to assemble and to move on stronger and clearer than before, within the experience that offers a future to humanity?
True Love is the name of this thread and we should not be deceived by complexity and its promotion, but rather, we should move to accommodate the simplicity of being in the moment, growing and moving where good health and happiness rule within personal and community governance.
A genuine True Love social policy made of Health-Education-Correction is what I mean to say, in context of this conversation with this group of elite, front line thinkers and human thought operators.

Dave,

By the word &quot;judgment&quot;, I take it that you mean &quot;discernment&quot; as opposed to &quot;trial and sentence&quot;.
Given the context that the future of humanity is presently with its back up against the wall, then sooner or later, no matter how uncomfortable it may be for the ego(s), necessity's order of survival will cause polarity such as you and John to fight the same battle, because genuine intelligence will no longer have the luxury of avoiding or dismiss each other. Intelligence is already causing the two of you to face such reality and to slug it out. I see such activity as the first steps in the emergence of the Personal Sector.

The other word that you recommend that I reflect upon is &quot;categorization...&quot;
I think that this is where many experts will have to adapt much of the expertise, which will cause many to learn simplification of unneeded goods and services' complexities the hard way.

Because of the global context, I see time itself causing you and John to eventually recognize how valuable your teaming up can be for the future itself, and not because of what you wish or not.

Once completed, humanity will benefit from a breakthrough of the first technological step into the universal passage from stranger to family, connecting the facts of history with the intangibles of destiny, leading the discipline from local to global, leading the way in the full view from micro to macro with the maturity of the Open Source Movement...

It is in anticipation of such a picture of the future, in which militancy melts into radiance, that I seek to develop contemplative thoughts such as The Ancient Voice of Humanity's Youth meeting with The Quietening Silence of Patient Wisdom.

With love and truth...
Benoit

John,

Long tails: I think that Dave Snowden was wrongly
using the term to mean something like Gartner's
plateau of productivity (or Bunyon's slough of despond
perhaps). And you are right that Chris Anderson uses
it in a specific way. I can dimly perceive how value
networks apply to Anderson's models but how do
participants in the long tail leverage value networks
for their own advantage - more details less rhetoric
please.

Networks are innate to all nature and activities. It
is problematic when
properties of nature are declared as method. Is
gravity a method?

No, gravity is a theory about the nature of reality
that we still don't properly understand. Even after
Einstein's work in general relativity, the links
between gravity and the other 3 fundamental forces of
the nature are far from cut and dried. Being subject
to gravity and trying to understand it are two very
different things. The same applies to our models of
human behaviour (of which value networks is one).

I am pleased with your semantic precision regarding
&quot;long tails&quot; but worry that you do not apply the same
rigour to &quot;value networks&quot;. If everything is a value
network then the term loses its power (I also
recognise that wanting to get too anal about these
things is counterproductive).

Either value networks is a bunch of mumbo-jumbo or it
is a set of powerful models &amp; techniques for
understanding the world &amp; then acting in it. Now I
believe it is the latter but we'll have to see. And to
an extent Dave is right - many people who will use the
term &quot;value networks&quot; will simply be trying to push
their own perspective of the world which will have
jack to do with networks of any sort.

And yes KM bad, value networks good. Two legs bad,
four legs good. Three bags full. Anything else we need
to clear up?

Benoit, while I frequently find it difficult to understand your
posts, I have the greatest respect for the passion and obvious
thought which goes into them. Â So let me try and clarify what may be
an important series of points. Â Our language and conceptual bases are
however very different so this may have little hope, but I will
attempt the task.

- I think you are wrong to interpret any disagreement as a clash of
egos. Â I find it particularly judgemental in this case as I was not
asserting a strong position, or in any way attacking value networks.
I was seeking to ask John to moderate his statements as I found some
of them offensive to people for who I have the greatest respect.

- John and I agree on many things, and have done so in public, we
also disagree. Â It is through that sort of exchange that learning
progresses. Â However (and this may be an ontological disagreement
between us) Ultimately some things are wrong and others are right
(not all but many).

- The argument you make for reconciliation could in logic be turned
into a argument for reconciliation between Hitler's fascism of
liberal democracy. Â Reconciliation of ideas can be a good thing, but
not in all cases. Â It is not defacto the right thing to do.

- Throughout your posting there are strong value judgements, you are
saying that not to follow the path you advocate is wrong, or more
specifically evidence of ego, or lack of respect for intelligence.
You are asserting a strong position in a highly judgemental way, but
the position you take is to condemn such assertions. Â This is a
contradiction.

- I have no idea if you and I are using complexity as a word in the
same way. Â However for me complexity is life (scientifically) and
connectivity by its essential nature leads to complexity. Â I see no
association of the term with war or disaster in a causal way as you
imply. Â That said you are making strong judgements here about what
John and I are saying, and our motivations which from my perspective
have little or no correspondence with reality, and come across to a
degree as patronising and paternalistic.

- I do not find name calling helpful and attempt (not always
successfully to avoid it). Â I think it is also right to stand up (as
I did on this occasion) and say that the name calling as gone too
far. Â Charles did the same. Â Reconciliation is not the same thing as
limitless tolerance.

- Complexity properly understood is about simplicity

&gt; Dave,

&gt; If that is so, I am now more confused than I thought. Â How can I
&gt; possibly exercise trial and sentence of any kind in a place like here?
&gt; I might be coming across as judgemental as a result of having lived
&gt; with my back up against the wall of poverty and insanity for so
&gt; long, working in the hope to see a great social healing, that I now
&gt; see mirages of hope and of brightness potentials, such as a future
&gt; where intelligence does come together to assemble lost egos,
&gt; connecting humans up from beyond our personal capacity for deceit
&gt; and evil production that keeps existence and business going on as
&gt; usual, keeping the powers that be so busy with the complexity of
&gt; mistrust and conflicts, that any accountability to life itself
&gt; becomes irrelevant to decision making.
&gt; Much complexities can and must be done away with, if sanity is to
&gt; appear on the local-global future's landscape. Â Resistance to the
&gt; reconciliation's path and progress is a dishonor to intelligence,
&gt; no matter who does it. Â To me, that is a basis in reality, strong
&gt; enough to discern how to maintain contact and at which proximity in
&gt; order to stay within acceptable comfort and security.
&gt; So in that sense, we are both right, I do judge from discernment.
&gt; By both staying free from sentencing, that becomes a relationship.
&gt; I thank God that I have no power of sentencing and that I do have
&gt; the power to forgive and to deliver from what is being forgiven..

&gt; Sooner or later, such intelligence must be yielded to, or else, the
&gt; awareness of sanity disappear, without one being aware of the
&gt; disappearance. Â That is the point at which simplicity of the
&gt; connection with the whole grows on more and more complex in order
&gt; to justify ones existence. Â The more power one exerts in that
&gt; direction and the more complex and detached everything becomes from
&gt; the whole.
&gt; So far, I've witnessed you go on to justify complexity instead of
&gt; moving toward the simplicity of connectivity between the whole and
&gt; the parts. Â John is also king of the hill in his own way and from
&gt; how I read him, he's had it enough with the isolation and insanity
&gt; caused by complexity, that he goes on provoking a reaction against
&gt; a future with no horizon, but war, war, war and disasters of all
&gt; kinds, against which humanity needs to rally, for we are not
&gt; prepared to face what is coming up.
&gt; Where is the opening for the assembling of the parts with the whole
&gt; to grow complete, healthy and functional if we remain closed to
&gt; reconciliation? Â What is the point of any Value-Networks if the
&gt; fundamental worth of life is not the primary focus?
&gt; Because of his name calling, John and others need reconciliation.
&gt; Can we not all learn to assemble and to move on stronger and
&gt; clearer than before, within the experience that offers a future to
&gt; humanity?
&gt; True Love is the name of this thread and we should not be deceived
&gt; by complexity and its promotion, but rather, we should move to
&gt; accommodate the simplicity of being in the moment, growing and
&gt; moving where good health and happiness rule within personal and
&gt; community governance.
&gt; A genuine True Love social policy made of Health-Education-
&gt; Correction is what I mean to say, in context of this conversation
&gt; with this group of elite, front line thinkers and human thought
&gt; operators.

&gt;&gt; Dave,
&gt;&gt; By the word &quot;judgment&quot;, I take it that you mean &quot;discernment&quot; as

&gt;&gt; Given the context that the future of humanity is presently with
&gt;&gt; its back up against the wall, then sooner or later, no matter how
&gt;&gt; uncomfortable it may be for the ego(s), necessity's order of
&gt;&gt; survival will cause polarity such as you and John to fight the
&gt;&gt; same battle, because genuine intelligence will no longer have the
&gt;&gt; luxury of avoiding or dismiss each other. Intelligence is already
&gt;&gt; causing the two of you to face such reality and to slug it out. I
&gt;&gt; see such activity as the first steps in the emergence of the

&gt;&gt; The other word that you recommend that I reflect upon is
&gt;&gt; &quot;categorization...&quot;
&gt;&gt; I think that this is where many experts will have to adapt much of
&gt;&gt; the expertise, which will cause many to learn simplification of
&gt;&gt; unneeded goods and services' complexities the hard way.
&gt;&gt; Because of the global context, I see time itself causing you and

I'd like to offer the following constructive perspective.
The creative and knowledge-based economy is a multi-trillion economy.
It's also the fastest growing sector of most developed economies and creating the largest number of new and interesting jobs.
Whether KM has a short or long tail is debatable.
What is not in question surely is there are more and more human capital, relational capital, structural capital, and intangible assets that need to be optimized.
From a demand perspective there should be an increasing need for smart strategies, tools, and techniques, to assist organizations to manage their assets.
Let's be open, innovative, use the best ones we can think of, and focus on that.

Best
Regards

Bryan

You have been very instrumental in raising the KM bar, and you have a lot of arrows in your back to show for it. You can continue if you think the patient will recover. Frankly, IMO, science and leadership for traditional KM practices have consolidate around other domains outside of KM like value networks, markets, narrative, complexity and media, and it might make sense to give them your focus, instead of fighting a losing battle.
