Contribution to the U. S. Constitution

Sean Callan

Purpose

The purpose of this research is to look at the enormous
contributions Native Americans, the League of the Iroquois in
particular, had on the &quot;Founding Fathers&quot; who helped shape our nation.
A curriculum unit and lesson plans will be developed to assist
teachers and students in broadening their understanding of how the
United States was formed and the structure of democratic ideals that
are in place today. Specifically this curriculum unit will be used in
the Native American Studies course sponsored by the Indian Education
Unit of Albuquerque Public Schools. In facilitating this instruction,
the teacher will see the direct correlations between student learning
and the District Core Curriculum Scope and Sequence in listening and
communication, self esteem, language arts 9-12, geography 9, world
history, United States history, government, as well as areas in math
and science.

Academic Setting

The School

I teach for the Indian Education Unit (IEU) of the Albuquerque
Public Schools (APS) and I am currently assigned to Albuquerque High
School (AHS). I teach Native American Studies (NAS), and have other
non teaching duties. APS is a very large district (127 K-12 schools)
with a student population of over 80,000. AHS has a student body count
neighboring 2,200 students. AHS is centrally located in the city,
serving a diverse mix of ethnicity, race and languages. According to
APS Research Development and Accountability (RDA), the following
breakdown represents the self identification of ethnic codes for AHS:
68 % Hispanic, 20 % White, 5 % African American, and 5% Native
American. AHS also has a significant minority of various Asian descent
students. Overall there are over a dozen languages other than English
spoken by the students and staff.

For immediate implementation, I will share this unit with the NAS
classes. Of course this unit would fit in any 6-12 sociology,
government, or history class. There are approximately 140 Native
American students at AHS. Over forty Tribal Nations are represented
and as many languages spoken, either by the student or the families.
The backgrounds of the NAS students are extremely diverse.

Some students still reside on traditional land and commute to the
city, others have never been to a tribal community. Some are fluent
and others struggle in their native languages. Like all students,
there exists a broad continuum in terms of knowledge and prior
knowledge of traditional or tribal culture. I have performers at many
levels of readiness and students from grades 9 to 12.

One of my duties includes acting as a sponsor to the Intertribal
Club. As a sponsor and a teacher I help bring guest speakers and
mentors from tribal elders / community members to the school. These
guests are generally successful people with unique experiences. I also
help promote Native American and American Indian weeks in APS in
November and April with ongoing culture activities specifically for
the Native American students. I encourage non-Native students and
staff participation.

The percentage of students receiving free or reduced meals is 24 %
of the students at AHS. In comparison, 55 % Native American students
receive free lunch. A substantial number come from single parent homes
and many have jobs, or sibling care-taking responsibilities. These
factors contribute to how students learn.

Native American students have the misfortune of leading APS in
several categories. Unfortunately these categories all represent
failure or the opposite of success. School drop-out rates, recidivism,
absenteeism, teen pregnancy, reading scores, English language
proficiency ratings, special education services (not gifted). These
issues are reflective of general status Native American education
throughout the United States. In an effort to address these issues and
rather than dealing directly with the institutional racism that exists
and perpetuated by false or misleading Euro-centric text books and
biased instructional practices, the IEU developed the NAS course.To

The Class

The NAS class is an elective offering, presently only available to
Native Americans due to federal budget policies from Johnson O'Malley
and TITLE IX. APS Administrators are, at their initiative or student
request, able to offer it to non-natives at any of the four present
sites offering NAS, is though appropriate fiscal appropriation.
Currently NAS is offered at four high schools (AHS, Highland, Rio
Grande, West Mesa) with IEU instructors, while two high schools have
initiated the course offering at their sites (there are 12 high
schools in the district). NAS is also offered by IEU at one mid school
(Van Buren) and one whose administrator took appropriate action in
attempting to meet district goals and directives.

The NAS course was designed to promote literacy foundations and
literacy building skills that will translate into success in other
academic areas. Students learn using the multiple intelligence model
(Gardner 1993) and differentiated instruction (Tomlinson, 1995) to
organize, plan, prepare, present (written and oral) while learning
about general history, practices, issues, and contemporary realities
that will culminate in a long term research project in an area of
personal interest. Students learn while building self worth and
esteem, which aid them in overcoming perpetual stereotyping and
discriminating social practices.

NAS has a level I and level II. Level I is for 9-10 graders. Level
II is designed for 11-12 grade students with additional emphasis in
post secondary challenges, like higher education and the world of
work. Depending on numbers during enrollment and time the course is
offered, some classes include 9-12 grade, from special education to
gifted students.

Utilizing Bloom's Taxonomy and Higher Order Thinking Skills or
HOTS, this unit plan will meet and exceed APS High School District
Core Curriculum Scope Sequence (APSHSDCCSS) standards. Overall the NAS
course is designed to be interdisciplinary and is correlated closely
with grade level APSHSDCCSS in language arts including reading,
writing and comprehension, social studies, math, and science.

Goals and Objectives

Upon completion of this unit students will be able to read
critically; develop the ability to discern between fact and fiction;
refine comparison and contrast skills; use, understand and be aware of
the story telling tradition of oral history people; gain insight into
the way history is reported, and by whom for what reason; begin to
appreciate and share the truth in regards to &quot;American Democracy&quot;; and
feel proud of the accomplishments Native Americans have contributed to
the United Sates Constitution and development of this country.
Students will learn about geography of the eastern United States. They
will learn about the development and unification of the thirteen
colonies based on Iroquois example, and the structure of power, checks
and balances, and also about diplomacy.

Furthermore, students will learn about Five Nations becoming Six
Nations, the Great Law of Peace, Iroquois culture and society,
relations among and between Native Nations, and the political concept
of sovereignty and how it applies to Native American Nations, and of
course they will learn about the undeniable impact the Iroquois had on
the founding fathers.To Top

Narrative

Rationale

The rationale for teaching this unit is multi-fold. The teaching
of the Iroquois Democracy, found in the Great Law of Peace, as well as
the United States Constitution, helps put the record straight. Senator
Daniel Inouye, as Chairman of the Select Committee on Indian Affairs
submitted a report that resulted in the passage of Senate Resolution
76 and House concurrent Resolution 331 that:

&quot;Acknowledges the contribution of the Iroquois Confederacy
of Nation to the Development of the United States Constitution and to
Reaffirm the Continuing Government -to -Government Relationship
between Indian Tribes and the United States Established in the
Constitution&quot; (100th Congress 2d Session).

This public acknowledgment and personal study will act as a source
of pride and inspiration for the Native American student. It shares an
important, overlooked aspect of Indian -white relations. It can foster
interest in sovereignty, self governance or an exploration in the
traditional wisdom or &quot;policy&quot; that has guided the various Indigenous
Nations, which the student can use in their individual research for
the NAS class.

It will provide a basis for understanding sovereignty and
government to government relations. It will bring attention to
neglected and disregarded treaty rights. Of course, foremost to the
valued knowledge, it will stimulate thought, discussion debate,
comparison, and contrast. Perhaps with appropriate encouragement it
will extend to civil or social democratic action, like voting or
community service.

I have been sharing insights and data regarding Iroquois
contribution to the Constitution for years, as an aside. This unit
provides the opportunity to address, acknowledge and flesh out the
indigenous momentum surrounding the revolution and idealists and lofty
goals of a young republic. Both teacher and student will come to
accept the role of the orators, spokesman, and leaders of the
Iroquois.

It will provide opportunities for students to use primary
documents as well as oral histories. It will create a forum for debate
dealing with contemporary state of democracy ideals and reality. It
will also provide a clearer understanding of differences, cultural,
language, practice and fulfillment of ideals.

This unit may also provide opportunity for lessons in tolerance.
Living diversity is a reality and not just a theory. Centrism and
xenophobia are some of the lessons to be learned here.

Background

The Iroquois confederacy has existed for a minimum of 600 years.
It became known as the league of the Iroquois and after the Tuscarora
joined the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca and Cayuga, thus, the Six
Nations. They controlled the trade economy and diplomatic interactions
among nations, both foreign and domestic up to and through the
colonizing period.

The Six Nations had practiced a democratic representative
government for at least 300 years by the time of the American
Revolution. Although the earlier colonist and revolutionaries held the
Native American in general in a lower class, even regarding them as
savages, the framers of our constitution could not deny the
&quot;indissoluble union&quot; that &quot;subsisted ages&quot; of the Iroquois Confederacy
(Wallace, 1994).

Benjamin Franklin's writing of the Albany plan echoed and
reiterated the words of the Iroquois Grand Council. The Albany Plan
was, of course, the precursor to the constitution. John Locke's
writing of Free Government in the second treatise can be traced to the
Canadian Huron's (Burton, 1988). The language and concepts used to pen
these influential documents, that later matured into the work of the
Constitutional Convention of 1787, reflect the Constitution's
indigenous roots.

I would first like to give more background on the Native
Americans, the original inhabitants of what we now know as North
America has been populated by its Indigenous Peoples for conservative
estimates between 10,000 and 50,000 years ago. Population estimates
have ranged from one million to several hundred million. It is
pointless to debate either of these demographics. Currently, the 558
federally recognized tribes, the one and one half million Native
Americans (1990 census) and the over 300 languages still spoken are
decimated survivors of 500 years of &quot;active&quot; genocide perpetuated by
&quot;civilized&quot; European and European decent people. Needless to say the
Indigenous people have lived here since time immemorial.

Today, indigenous people in North America have been classified
into ten cultural regions according to National Geographic and the
late Dr. Alfonso Ortiz. The Iroquois are regarded as a Northeast
Woodlands culture. Each of the Six Nations speak their own dialect of
the Iroquois language family.

The Algonquian, who are also Northeast Woodland people with their
own language family, have written accounts in the Walla Olum or Red
Record, which describes their return across the land bridge to their
ancestral land on &quot;Turtle Island&quot; (1992). The Algonquian were a large
nation joined with many smaller nations. Their individual rights and
freedoms also became beacons for the Constitution and Bill of Rights,
when witnessed by colonial representatives and Indian agents.To Top

The Iroquois, who have a very rich and encompassing culture, are
known as audenosaunee, or People of the Longhouse. Architecturally
speaking this was an early model for apartment living, ecologically
and environmentally sound. The Longhouse was built with tree limbs and
bark. They were long and wide, they generally housed three or four or
more families. There were openings for the smoke for every hearth
inside the Longhouse.

For authentic replicas of historical long houses see some painting
and works of Charles White. He was able to capture the essence of the
Iroquois living community. His work has provided detailed images of
the early contact period.

Community was based on a matriarchal society. That is land,
property and so on was passed through the female lineage in the
family. It is a good time to point out that the Iroquois, as well as
most of indigenous people of North America, did not share the same
perspective on land or property ownership.

Land was a gift of the creator, to be used and cared for by the
people, not to be bought, sold or amassed. It was a means for
survival. The Iroquois practiced sound ecology: waste not, want not is
an apt applicable concept. Never take more than what you need and
replenish what you take. The agricultural practice included the
burning of harvested fields and the rotating of harvests, so as not to
deplete the nurturing power of the land.

Iroquois subsistence was on the &quot;three sisters&quot; of agriculture,
hunting, and gathering. The reference to three sisters is the uniquely
North American early farming practices that yielded corn, beans, and
squash. Due to migratory practices of Native American nations, a
competition arose among tribes for resources. This set the stage for
prosperity, jealousy, poverty and battle.

This was about the time of Deganawidah. Deganawidah, otherwise
known as &quot;Peacemaker,&quot; was, according to prophecy, to have been born
of a virgin mother and carry with him a message from the creator. His
words and wisdom would become the Great Law of Peace (Great Tree of
Peace, as law translates to mean peace in Iroquois) that guided and
protected the Iroquois Confederacy.

Traditional Haudenosaunee intertwine their existence with
existentialism. In other words, they live their religion on a daily
basis. One practices their religion everyday, worship, action and
interaction is an ongoing philosophy that does not separate society,
government, or religion. Interestingly enough, one is free to practice
and celebrate religion anyway they see fit.

Every member (of the League) had individual and communal
responsibilities. These duties usually followed traditional roles. For
instance in the matrilineal society women had specific
responsibilities. Raising of children was generally the women's role,
that was, of course, for the obvious reasons of feeding and nurturing.
Women also were responsible for passing on family history and
fulfilling their role in a clan based system of social
relationships/interactions. Women were elected as clan mothers. Clan
mothers contributed in instrumental societal and governmental roles. I
will expound upon these roles later.

Symbolism and art were intricate tools in realizing personal
commitment to the League, clan, and family. Art was as much aesthetic
as it was useful. Symbols were also used to denote clans, family
affiliation. Symbols and art were both used to create wampum.

Wampum was a traditional form of communication and of recording
events. Wampum used specifically colored seashells, arranged to
express detailed data that reflects the oral tradition and retelling
of historical events. These recorded documents, &quot;wampum,&quot; were and are
sacred to the Haudenosaunee.

In fact, wampum, although not used in bartering, was often
exchanged as a trust or commitment. Copies were made for each party
participating in an international agreement. Wampum value, therefore,
being so precious, became a colonial and post colonial colloquialism
for money.

Clans are extended family, a system of relations, handed down
through the mother. A man who married would live among his wife's
people, their children would be of the mother's clan. They would
reside in her Longhouse, in her village. Again the role of the
matriarch was and is very instrumental in the Iroquois way of life.

There are many clans. These clans are the direct descendants of
the first beings on Turtle Island in the Haudenosaunee creation
stories. Clans among the Iroquois implore the use animal symbols,
while each Nation share four of the same clans. Thus one always has a
relative no matter where she is. Each clan is protected, guided and
protects for their animal. To Top

Great Law of Peace

Dates have once again become an issue, but Deganawidah was said to
have been born to a young Huron virgin somewhere between 1000-1500 AD.
Deganawidah's story is prophetic and carries the burden and backbone
of the United States Constitution. Deganawidah, or Peacemaker, was
assisted in his mission by Hiawatha.

Deganawidah's appearance came at a point in Iroquois existence
that threatened the survival of the Haudenosaunee. The Five Nations
were warring with each other, as well as with nations with a tradition
of conflict. Raid after raid, destruction ensued. Deganawidah, who, it
is said, was a messenger of the creator, was to &quot;bring Good News of
Peace and Power to the Five Nations&quot; (Wallace 1994).

According to Iroquois history, the Peacemaker's instructions were
to travel east and unite the nations under three reasons
righteousness, health and power. His message from the creator is that
we are all related, and we shall love one another and live together in
peace. Each reason, or part, has two branches: righteousness means
justice practiced between men and nations, it also means to see
justice prevail; health, means soundness of body and mind, it also
means peace because that is what comes when minds are sane and bodies
are cared for; power means authority, the authority of law and custom
backed by such force as is necessary to make justice prevail, it means
also religion, for justice enforced is the will of the holder of the
heavens and has his sanction.

Oren Lyons, faith keeper of the Onondaga, reiterates today the
four principles that drive the Kanonsionni. Peace, equality, justice,
and the power of good minds are what continue to hold the Kanonsionni
together. These principles are the same as the original principles
(Lyons, et al. 1992).

The opportunity to join with the new league was extended to all
nations, this was the message of the creator. In fact other nations
and lesser nations were members of the league. Nations like the
Tuscarora, who spoke Iroquois, in what would become North Carolina
joined the league, or the Kanonsionni. The colonies were later
extended this opportunity union with the Iroquois. They chose not to
join, but they did choose to model their structure of government on
the Iroquois. The French were also invited to join, but they did not
trust the Iroquois.

In Deganawidah's travels, his efforts to secure peace were
sometimes met by skepticism and opposition. Atotarho, also known as
Tadodaho, was an Onondaga chief who was ruthless and very difficult to
bring into the Great Peace. They said he was a man with a twisted
body, twisted mind, and hair a mass of tangled snakes. This was a
challenging task for Deganawidah, and he solicited assistance from one
who came to be called He Who Combs, Hiawatha.

Deganawidah set out to end the brutality and fear of a man-eating
humans. His goal was to share the new mind, replacing killing with
thinking. Once Hiawatha saw reason and a good mind it changed him. He
was to join Deganawidah and share the new mind.

While Hiawatha was preparing to deal with Atotarho, Deganawidah
convinced the Mohawk to believe in the Great Peace, and they became
the first founding member of the league. Deganawidah first had to
prove his words were true. His miracle was to survive a falling tree
set to fall over a river while perched at the highest branch.

Hiawatha's dealings proved fruitless, tragedy struck his family,
and he became a wanderer. While on his personal journey Hiawatha
discovered the use of lake shells strung like beads as a form of
writing, or system of memory recall, wampum. Hiawatha would redeem
himself with the efforts of Deganawidah and the Iroquois condolence
prayer song.

Wampum strings were carried by the Peacemaker and his partner to
the various nations and were used to explain the Great Peace. Mohawk
leaders accompanied Deganawidah and Hiawatha in their recruitment for
member nations. Soon the Oneidas and the Cayugas joined the Mohawks.

All Onondaga chiefs, except for Atotarho, were compelled to join,
and even the &quot;warlike and independent&quot; (Wallace 1994) two branches of
the Seneca had joined. Atotarho was the only left to convince. With an
eloquent statement followed by a show of support of the Five Nations,
Atotarho To Topfinally succumbed to the Peace movement. He was not
without benefit though.

Deganawidah had negotiated the host site of the council and
council the presidership to Atotarho, now referred to as Tadodaho, as
all head chiefs of the Six Nations have since been titled. The union
was to remain strong, for it was to be a leader in unity in diversity.
Five nations had five different customs, rituals, and practices that
were preserved through their membership in the Kaianerekowa.

The Great Tree of Peace has its own constitution, originally in
strings of wampum. The Constitution of the Great Tree of Peace is an
instrument of a way of life rather than a defensive product abdicating
protection from aggression. It is as simple, thorough, and complex as
the U. S. Constitution. The many similarities can be traced directly
to colonial experience in Haudenosaunee villages.

The starkest differences are the intentional elimination for
women's rights. Rights and responsibilities go together. Iroquois
women as mentioned previously have a tremendous role in Iroquois
society. They nominated, or appointed leadership. They had the power
of veto and impeachment and leaders could be removed from office for
failing to lead an exemplary life.

Robert Venable calls it a betrayal to Iroquois values to have
omitted women. The checks and balance system that now has more check
and less balance. In the U.S. majority can rule an important issue,
whereas the Iroquois call for consensus on all important issues before
their council. The council is made up of two houses: Elder Brothers;
Mohawk, Seneca, Onondagas and the Younger Brothers, Cayuga, Oneida and
Tuscarora.

Each nation sent representatives, some held more seats than
others, but in the end each nation has only one vote, one voice. Each
of the nations supported the league by offering its best leadership.
As mentioned before, Onondaga became the host site and Atotarho was
the agenda setter, moderator, and mediator in times of disagreement or
confusion.

Councils met a minimum of once a year and as needed by sending
runners to all nations. It was each member's responsibility to
consider seven generations ahead in all their decisions. (Names of the
original chiefs of the first council meeting became the titles for
future chiefs). Different nations held variations of veto powers. For
example, the Seneca, as the military leaders of the league, had veto
power regarding war and other acts of aggression.

Other differences include the fact that the U.S. distinctly
separates church and state and to the Iroquois there is no difference
they are inseparable and integrated into Iroquois life. Another large
discrepancy is the philosophy regarding property rights and individual
ownership versus communal usufruct. Some things that are so common to
the Iroquois were not included in their constitution.

Freedom of religion was considered a natural right and was a moot
point. When new nations join, they are encouraged to practice and
maintain any religious practice they have. Freedom of speech goes
without saying for the Iroquois.To Top

Implementation

The creation of this unit plan was designed exactly as the APS IEU
curriculum development team created the NAS curriculum guide. It was
designed to address the APSHSDCCSS with every lesson. As a reminder
NAS is an elective credit course, but our goal is to improve student
success and we do that by interdisciplinary study for holistic
learning. Therefore, we address APSHSDCCSS standards in multiple
disciplines across our curriculum.

Our NAS curriculum guide is developed in a way that allows for
student growth (academically and personally). I intend to use this
unit early in the school year. It is a rather limited unit, but the
extension activities and related study are boundless. This unit will
provide a strong foundation in portraying a people with pride and
dignity and a unique system of justice in the oldest living democracy.

One way to meet our objectives at IEU in building healthy, strong,
self-esteem in our students is to aid and empower them. I believe that
by studying the Iroquois Native American students will feel a sense of
pride through the recognition and significance of Native American
influence, impact and contribution, to not only the Constitution, but
the birth of a nation.

Unit Overview

This unit can take five to ten class periods. The length depends
on student engagement, teacher background and knowledge and choice of
extension activities. The reasoning behind the planned lessons and
extension activities is that they provide for anchoring exercises,
full immersion into Bloom's Taxonomy from Knowledge to Evaluation, and
in addressing each students multiple intelligences.

To begin this unit, I would begin with a brief history of the
Haudenosaunee (people of the long house). This history may start with
contemporary Haudenosaunee celebrities. This is important to show the
longevity, survival and continuance of the Six Nations. Iroquois
government and culture is alive and well and the students need to be
aware of this fact. In fact the Iroquois has a seat in the United
Nations.

There are two videos that give a unique perspectives of the People
of the Longhouse. The first is titled &quot;A Matter of Promises&quot; by the
Native American Public Broadcasting Consortium, and the other is a PBS
special Bill Moyers with Oren Lyons. There are other videos that are
also good, including a PBS video on the Iroquois creation story. These
videos paint a picture of a contemporary people with a living history,
tradition and culture while exploring current issues of the
Haudenosaunee.

TNT has produced a program that aired on television called &quot;Broken
Circle&quot;. This film characterizes Iroquois action during the American
revolution. It is an appropriate film for understanding the
complexities that faced the People of the Longhouse. To Top

Lesson Plan I

While discussing the who, what, when, where, and why the teacher
can point to Iroquois members who have reached celebrity or public
figure status. For instance the Iroquois Lacrosse team that took
runner up in the World Lacrosse Championships in Australia this year.
One can identify actors like Graham Green, musicians like Robbie
Robertson, and comedians like Charlie Hill. These bring opportunities
for the students to identify with someone they may be familiar with.

Of course lacrosse was a sport indigenous to this continent and
was a major event for entertainment, sport and political discourse for
the Iroquois. Hockey is another area where Iroquois men have earned
respect in the National Hockey League. History books often reflect on
the skills and aptitude of Iroquois men who built the sky towers and
high risers in New York city. Obviously once the student's interest is
peaked then you go into your lesson.

I start with a Geography check. Asking the student's where the
Iroquois six Nations are? Where is New York? You can mention that
Buffalo (i.e.: Bills, Sabres) is right outside of Onondaga, the
central fire of the League. I would check students knowledge of the
Great Lakes, rivers, like the St. Lawrence and so on . You can discuss
the flora and fauna, ecology and environment.

I use different types of maps, atlas', globe, wall maps, and
National Geographic maps of Indian land and reservations. For a hands
on project I have students make maps creating their own legends or
keys. This can be organized and carried out in a variety of ways.
Individual or small group, rubrics and criteria can be established
with student involvement.

I introduce, or reintroduce, geographical terms and concepts going
over cardinal directions and so on. Learning map reading is a valuable
life long tool. We discuss the fact that the Mohawk Nation is on both
sides of the United States and Canadian border and how it came to be
that way. There are plenty of opportunity to discuss boundary disputes
between Canada, United States and the Haudenosaunee.

In Canada the reservations are called reserves. Canada, not having
the best track record with its indigenous people, has made significant
conciliations and recognition of the rights of the native people of
Canada in recent time.

In the geography portion of the lesson my intention is for the
student to know where the Eastern woodlands are, who the eastern
woodlands people are, to name all 5-6 nations of the Iroquois, the
five Great Lakes, the St. Lawrence river, the Atlantic Ocean. I would
expect the students to be able to read maps, understand keys, legends
and orientation, as well as to know terms and symbols.

Vocabulary is important in developing literacy skills. NAS
students in particular need to be aware of specifics terms and
concepts as applied to the unique relationships between indigenous
Nations and the United States government. Things like sovereignty,
Treaties and Treaty Law, are important to all people, especially for
Native Americans. Other terms and language as recognized by the
particular classroom teacher are added to the list. I usually have a
writing exercise involving use of vocabulary.

Having students write sentences with vocabulary and term concepts
is a lower level of understanding . Having student write a three or
four paragraph essay utilizing their definitions and class notes asks
them to analyze and synthesize the interrelationship between terms,
vocabulary and student learning. Poetry is another option that offer
students another learning perspective.

An extension exercise would be to calculate square mileage of
Iroquois territory, before and after European contact and the American
Revolution. You can do this for the entire league or individual
nations. Learning the resources and economic conditions also
demonstrate to the student, the depth of the Iroquois society.

This lesson meets the APSHSDCCSS standards in the following areas:
Geographic.

Understanding- Relative and Absolute location Place; physical and
human systems Interaction; human and physical systems Regions;
criteria and definition Math-IV Geometric concepts, calculating,
formulasTo Top

Lesson Plan II

Since NAS has multiple responsibilities that include, learning to
prepare for, and conduct research for their final project, it is
logical to include a research exercise. The goal of this lesson would
be to introduce or familiarize students with Internet exploration and
conduct a library search. Done early in the year, this will prepare
students for their long term project.

Students will become familiar with the AHS library and Internet
search engines while gathering additional / supplemental material on a
directed topic. Students can work in pairs investigating specific
concerns. Students will learn how to focus their search, zero in on
their topic, and choose the more appropriate search engine. Here again
is a chance for vocabulary building; search engine, URL, and other
terms learned while data searching.

The teacher can choose a topic like Iroquois or League of Six
Nations for students to begin their search. They can also go after
contemporary topics like World Lacrosse or an actor or celebrity. I
use two class periods for this exercise. Students prepare to share
their findings and URL's as well as their experience in exploring the
net.

Therefore, while developing skills for individual research
project, students are becoming proficient with computer use. In order
to enhance student learning, challenges and rewards must be present.
The computer provides those along with entertainment! Computer use and
proficiency is a primary goal of Title IX grant in IEU.

Obviously, a teacher would need to reserve time in the computer
lab. At AHS we have &quot;flex&quot; days where classes are two periods long.
That works best for our computer use. I just learned we no longer have
flex days, and I will have to make some adjustments and carry some
lessons an extra day.

There are some great primary documents that can be accessed
through educational software and CD-ROM. Check with your Librarian for
what is available at your school.

Evaluation is, of course, on going: student portfolio, using
teacher / student developed rubrics per lesson / unit. Here the
teacher would monitor time on task, development of resource list and
proper identification of URLs, group work, preparedness to share
findings.

Lesson Plan III

In this next lesson we are prepared to delve into the Great Law of
Peace or the Kaianerekowa of the Haudenosaunee, Iroquois Confederacy
founded by Deganawidah sometime during the 10th-15th century (Schaaf,
1987). For this portion I use Dr. Schaaf and Jake Swamps presentation
in a pamphlet produced through the Tree Of Peace Society. It includes
the U. S. Constitution and many reference and resources. Dr. Schaaf
uses American Indian Agent George Morgan's official and personal
papers that explain the connections and &quot;borrowing&quot; by the framers of
the U.S. Constitution.

The focus of this lesson is to become familiar with the Great Law
of Peace. To recognize the use of wampum and wampum interpretation and
how this democracy worked in the life of a member of the Six Nations.
This lesson allows for the exploration of symbols and symbolism. DCCSS
history skills on research, primary documentation, and analyses will
be met.

Symbols and symbolism predicate the Iroquois culture. It permeates
the Great Law of Peace and the constitution. The United States
borrowed many symbols and ideas that are prevalent today from the
Iroquois. They appear on our coins, our bills, our national bird, our
speech, and slang.

The Iroquois, remember, used a great white pine to represent the
Great Tree of Peace. The white pine was chosen because it was tall and
it reached toward the sky (Heavens). The roots of the pine were said
to extend to all four quarters of the earth. This was so, according to
the Peace Maker, because the law (peace) was extended to embrace all
mankind. The large branches signified shelter and protection for all
member nations.

The Haudenosaunee referred to the confederacy as the &quot;Great
Peace.&quot; The eagle who is regarded in a sacred way, watches out for
evil to protect the great peace. Again, Deganawidah's instructions
called for the end to violence and abuse. Warriors were instructed to
bury their weapons underneath the great white pine. Thus, the saying,
&quot;bury the hatchet.&quot;

Another opportunity to include art is during the discussion of
symbols and symbolism. Students can draw or create an Iroquois symbol
or concept and then write about its significance to the Haudenosaunee
and to themselves. An optional assignment is to have them construct a
poem using terminology from the Kaianerekowa. A rubric can be created
for these assignments.

Time must be spent either in lecture, or storytelling format,
meeting APSHSDCCSS communication and listening standards, to share the
evolution of the Great Law of Peace. Getting students to see the
reasoning and the motivation for the work of Deganawidah will help
them see its significance to the Haudenosaunee today. Students can
work in pairs or small groups to read and come to understand the
Kaianerekowa through question and discussion.

The next part of the lesson is constructing charts for later
comparison with the constitution. Students can use butcher paper to
establish linear timelines for their comparisons. An extension
activity could be the opportunity to show the PBS Bill Moyer Interview
with Oren Lyons. Obviously a local elder or member of the Six Nations
would be a great asset as a guest speaker or storyteller.

Again various APSHSDCCSS disciplines and competencies are met.
Under Math Geometric Concepts IV linear measurement, graphing,
inductive and deductive reasoning are applied. Language arts listening
skills are met at various levels, speaking skills are addressed as
well as reading comprehension. To Top

Lesson Plan IV

Now it's time to check student knowledge of the Constitution. Some
student recognition of similarities will have come up during the
reading of the Kaianerekowa. A great video recently released for youth
is hosted by Bill Maher of Politically Incorrect. This video makes fun
while explaining the constitution at a level students will enjoy. The
video can provide for a relaxed environment in which to discuss the
constitution and the merits of its presentation.

After reviewing the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, students
will draw on the some of the similarities. The challenge you pose to
them will be to look for the differences between the Great Law of
Peace and the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Students will
continue to work in pairs and small groups completing their comparison
charts and time lines. Vocabulary and terms are important here to
facilitate student understanding. This will segue into a discussion of
current situations for both governments.

There are also several articles for the students to read in this
lesson. These articles by Dr. Bruce Burton, Dr. Greg Schaaf, National
Geographic, and Congressional Resolution 76, acknowledge and defend
the fact that the Great Law of Peace, the democratic government
practiced by the Haudenosaunee, predates European exploration or
colonization in North America. Furthermore, evidence by the Morgan
Papers, Benjamin Franklin's own words and writings, the structure and
practice of our current government, cannot deny proper acknowledgment
and appropriate recognition.

At this point students should be expected to know quite a lot
about he Haudenosaunee and the Great Law of Peace, and that it
predates the United States Constitution by at least 300 years.
Students have now been progressively informed on the history and
political philosophy of the Haudenosaunee. They have been reminded of
the Constitution and Bill of Rights. They have now reached the
synthesis stage in Bloom's taxonomy and the evaluation stage is next.

Assessment and evaluation are ongoing and meet previously stated
APSHSDCCSS standards.

Lesson Plan V

It is time for discussion and debate. Are there really
differences? Are there really similarities? What are they? Have
students present their charts to the class and share their findings.
Check student understanding with a written or verbal quiz, or perhaps
a class game like Jeopardy. Depending on the size of the class,
students could role play a Council meeting where colonist are present
or another scenario.

These are the types of culminating activities that showcase
enthused learning. A video tape of a reenactment or the game will be
great for the students to watch at a later time. Photos would be
appropriate for their portfolios.

Writing is important in our literacy based program, and the
ability to express thoughts and understandings not only is necessary
to communicate effectively it is a performance standard set by the
district. Students should write an essay on the differences of the
systems, philosophy of the Iroquois and the colonists, system of
personal preference and reasoning behind it. It doesn't really matter
as long as they are writing about their learning. Once again a rubric
needs to be established, unless a standing rubric is used.

Portfolio assessment has been the means of assessment for three
years now in APS IEU. It is comprised of student work, including first
drafts and works in progress, quizzes, assignments and the rest of the
work involved in NAS for the entire school year. IEU has also tried to
empower the students by seeking their input in developing rubrics for
assignments, as well as for their research projects.

In these lessons for the unit, Iroquois Contribution to the
Constitution, the emphasis is placed on communication and
understanding. Our goal is to empower students with history and
tradition that is substantial and substantiated. It is hoped this
exploration and mini research inspires a student to learn more of
their tribal traditions and governments. Maybe it will just spark an
idea, or support for tribal sovereignty.

As explained throughout the unit our assessment tools for this
lesson will be to add to their portfolio. We will be assessing daily
involvement and group work participation, note taking, discussion
leading or supporting, timelines, charts of comparison and
differences, maps, essay and related learning assessable participation
in role playing or class game. To Top
