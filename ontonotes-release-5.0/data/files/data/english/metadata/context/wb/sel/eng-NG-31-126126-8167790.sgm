I'm hearing rumblings that little Julie Power/Lightspeed, now age 17 in
the comics, member of the Loners, former member of Power Pack, either
is, or will soon be turned into a lesbian lusting after Micky/Turbo. Can
anyone confirm or debunk this? I didn't pick this title up since I'm
having to cut back on my comics, so I haven't read this book. And how
does she go from 11 to 17 while Franklin Richards stays at 5 forever?

It's strongly hinted in LONERS that Julie lusts after certain females.
It's not nearly as strongly hinted that she does so to the exclusion of
certain males. She's also at an age where teen girls in affluent
societies often experiment sexually, so it's way too early to suggest
she's being &quot;turned into a lesbian&quot;, strictly speaking. (That might well
be the endpoint of her story, of course, but it's only one possibility.)

Also, Franklin has been aged and de-aged on many occasions, including
since his initial meeting with the early Power Pack. His apparent age
(which his MK4 and THE THING appearances in the last couple years suggest
should be in the 9-12 range, rather than the eternally-five you posit),
therefore, really should not be used as a basis for judging the relative
ages of those around him. (Additionally, since they take place entirely
out-of-continuity, Franklin's extreme youth in the SON OF A GENIUS strips
should also be ignored for this purpose.)

That's ridiculous. How could Mr Fantastic even get all five
necessary drops into his cereal?

I chalk Franklin up to using his powers to stay young.  He makes no
sense otherwise.  As for Julie...so what if it's true?  She's make a
good match for Karolina Dean.
