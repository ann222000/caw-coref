Now that I've successfully coded my own rss feed, I now understand
better how Rob from podcast411 was able to offer listeners extra
podcasts - but only to subscribers.  I'm a subscriber to his podcast,
so it was never a problem for me, and I understood that he did this to
encourage people to subscribe.  I don't know, what do people think
about this technique?  Good idea?  Does it work?

I offer exclusive content to people who sign up for my newsletter. Upon
verification of subscription, an automatic email is generated providing the
URL. I think it's a good idea to offer some kind of incentives for signing
up.

All podcasts are &quot;subscriber only,&quot; by their nature.  Are you talking
about offering things in the feed that aren't available for direct
download?

About half of all listeners do so at their desks in front of their
computers.  I don't know if it's a good idea to segregate your content
-- better to provide all listeners with as many ways to listen as
possible.  Give them a choice; don't make them work.

A lot of people create revenue by offering a free product and selling an
enhanced or in some way superior version to those interested. As long as the
freebie isn't irritatingly inferior or an annoying obvious come-on for paid
content, I don't think it creates any ill will. It's not how I go about it
(I offer exclusive content for newsletter subscribers), but it's a tried &amp;
true approach for some.

I think you are confused. Some podcasters have released a show that can only
be found on the feed. It doesn't get posted to the website. Granted the user
just has to go to the feed... but that is besides the point.

It's unfortunate, the confusion over the term &quot;subscribe&quot;.  It unfortunate
because it often confuses, as so many folks consider a &quot;subscription&quot; to
indicate something that is paid for -- I'm still not certain, in reading
this thread, whether the OP was referring to paid content or free content.
Was the OP referring to content that is only able to be downloaded once paid
for?  Or was the OP referring to the free subscription to an RSS/podcast
feed?  It would be so useful to have some new terms to use when explaining
this stuff...

I distinguish on my website and my spoken material between &quot;subscribing&quot; to
the podcast and &quot;signing up&quot; for the newsletter.

Like others I'm confused by your use of &quot;subscribe&quot;.  For example, you
are probably subscribed to this Yahoo group via email, and Google Reader
allows you to &quot;subscribe&quot; to XML feeds through their online news
aggregator, but these are not paid services, which is (I assume) what
you're referring to.  So you might want to find another name for that.

I think Rob's RSS-only episodes are his &quot;soapbox&quot; shows, where he tends to
stray a bit from the standard podCast411 format.  He uses these special
episodes as a kind of &quot;bonus&quot; for subscribers.  Overall, it's not a bad
idea, and if you have a lot of subscribers, it could be something fun to do
on occasion.
