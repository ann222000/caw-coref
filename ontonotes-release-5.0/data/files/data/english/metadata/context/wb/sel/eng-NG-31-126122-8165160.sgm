I knew a guy that could take a few tokes of pot and start bouncing off the
walls. He'd get in people's faces and insist they listen to his excitable

The only thing that would mellow him out: a line of coke.

&quot;The researchers said they couldn't prove that marijuana use itself
increases the risk of psychosis, a category of several disorders with
schizophrenia being the most commonly known.

There could be something else about marijuana users, &quot;like their
tendency to use other drugs or certain personality traits, that could
be causing the psychoses,&quot; Zammit said.&quot;

Thus any claim that marijuana causes psychosis is suspect and probably
bogus.  Much more significant is that what causes people to by
psychotic probably induces them to use recreational drugs outside the
accepted norm of alcohol.

Man. Mitch Ryder and Peter Tosh.

My Peter Tosh story is nothing like that. Peter was booked to play The
Bottom Line. At the time, he had a minor hit that featured Mick Jagger.
I got tickets to the show, after the announcement that jagger would not
be there. Repeatedly, DJ's announced that Mick would not be there.

I went to the show. Jagger was not there. Good show, though.

Not only that (&quot;Don't Look Back,&quot; not the Boston song!), Mick sang it
with him on Saturday Night Live, and took him on tour as the Stones'
opening act in '78 I think it was, I had seen them at RFK stadium in
Philadelphia (Foreigner was on the bill  too, think they only had the
one album out, I remember it rained too!).  So when in an effort to
make pleasant conversation with the reggae star, I asked him about the
Stones and he seemed disdainful of them, he struck me as a bit
ungrateful - seeing that from my point of view, it seemed Jagger had
basically plucked him out and single-handedly made him a star (I
wouldn't have known Tosh without the Jagger association).  Didn't seem
like a particularly friendly guy in this short encounter, but his girl
cousin that I new was nice and lots of fun.

Cool!
I saw him open for the Stones in 78. He and Mick did their hit &quot;Don't
Look Back&quot;
Peter lit a huge spliff on stage, which was ironic cause my friend and
I got kicked out of the show for smoking. Bastard cops took our stash
and tickets and kicked us out minutes before the Stones were due
onstage.
No problem, we walked around the stadium, picked up tickets at 10
bucks a pop and were right back in. Minus stash, but oh well.

I was a sophomore in College when I saw this so I was about 21. We
watched it in Anatomy class, we were learning about the brain at that
period.

I always thought Sonny looked a tad bit stoned himself.

During my 6th- or 7th-grade health class, a diagram they showed revealed
to me for the first time that the penis is supposed to go into the vagina.

It was only later that I found out you're actually supposed to move back
and forth with it, though. I thought you just stuck it in and left it there.
