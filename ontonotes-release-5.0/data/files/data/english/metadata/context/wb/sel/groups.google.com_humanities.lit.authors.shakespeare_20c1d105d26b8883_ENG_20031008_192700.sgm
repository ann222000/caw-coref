PENSHURST PLACE, KENT By Cavendish, Richard

Sir Henry Sidney (1529-86), Edward VI's childhood friend, grew
up at court and married above himself. His wife, Mary Dudley, [who]
nursed Elizabeth through smallpox in 1562, contracted the disease
herself and was so hideously disfigured that she wore a mask in public
all the rest of her life. Her husband remained devoted to her and in a
touching story in their son's ARCADIA a woman's face is destroyed by
acid, then her beauty is restored by magic. Her brother Robert Dudley,
Earl of Leicester, was Elizabeth's principal favourite and
the queen loved `sweet Penshurst', which she often visited.

&quot;ARCADIA was the charmed circle where all his spirits
forever should be enchanted.&quot; --Sir P. Sidney.
----------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;In 1598 Lope de Vega married Doña Juana de Guardo,
daughter of a wealthy BUTCHER
and wrote the pastoral romance _LA ARCADIA_

Knight of Malta working for the Duke of Alba.

Wrote: &quot;No one is so stupid as to admire Miguel de Cervantes.&quot;

Son Carlos Félix dies off the coast of Venezuela in 1612.
Lope appointed an officer of the Inquisition in 1614.
Lope's daughter Amarilis went blind &amp; insane.
Lope's daughter Antonia was abducted by a courtier.
Lope scourged himself furiously

Some of his works were based on his own chaotic love life,
among them Dorothy (1632): 'a novel in dialogue.'

Most of his large incomes was devoted to charity &amp; church.

He died in Madrid on AUGUST 26, 1635 more or less poor.
Lope's state funeral lasted for NINE DAYS.

Yes, Dave, it does.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Will Kemp bragged about doing the MORRIS danced from
London to Norwich in NINE DAYS in his _Nine Daies Wonder_ (1600).

&quot;When a Mason told Lincoln in a conversation during that campaign
that all his opponents were Freemasons, especially noting that
Stephen A. Douglas was an early member of the Masonic lodge in
Springfield, Lincoln's home town, and he was not,
Lincoln replied, 'I am not a Freemason, Dr. MORRIS,
though I have great respect for the institution.'&quot;
-----------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Will Kemp, colleague of Shakespeare, fellow shareholder in the
Globe Theatre, Europe's most famous comic actor amd morris dancer
extraordinary. It is likely that several of Shakespeare's clown roles
were written specifically for Kemp, but in 1599, the two fell out.

Whatever the cause of the quarrel, Kemp decided to demonstrate that he,
not the upstart bard, was still the people's favourite and in a sort
of 16th Century publicity stunt, he set off to dance all the way from
London to Norwich. In spite of primitive roads and winter weather, he
achieved the feat in just NINE DAYS* and wrote a book about the event
(A nine daies wonder) which gave us the phrase &quot;a NINE DAYS wonder&quot;.

*This excludes the week or so be was holed up in a hotel
in Bury St. Edmonds in heavy snow and the two half days
which he decided not to include.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;In those old days, they cooked in the kitchen with a big kettle that
always hung over the fire. Every day they lit the fire and added things
to the pot. They ate mostly vegetables and did not get much meat. They
would eat the stew for dinner, leaving leftovers in the pot to get cold
overnight and then start over the next day. Sometimes the stew had food
in it that had been there for quite a while -hence the rhyme,

&quot;Peas porridge hot, peas porridge cold,
peas porridge in the pot NINE DAYS old.&quot;&gt;&gt;

The Odyssey Book XII By Homer
Translated by Samuel Butler

&lt;&lt;&quot;'You will find the other rocks lie lower, but they are so close
together that there is not more than a bowshot between them. [A large
fig tree in full leaf grows upon it], and under it lies the sucking
whirlpool of Charybdis. Three times in the day does she vomit forth her
waters, and three times she sucks them down again; see that you be not
there when she is sucking, for if you are, Neptune himself could not
save you; you must hug the Scylla side and drive ship by as fast
as you can, for you had better lose six men than your whole crew.'&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;[The wind got into the South again, which frightened me
lest I should be taken back to the terrible whirlpool of Charybdis.
This indeed was what actually happened, for I was borne along
by the waves all night, and by sunrise had reacfied the rock of Scylla,
and the whirlpool. She was then sucking down the salt sea water, but I
was carried aloft toward the fig tree, which I caught hold of and clung
on to like a bat. I could not plant my feet anywhere so as to stand
securely, for the roots were a long way off and the boughs that
overshadowed the whole pool were too high, too vast, and too far apart
for me to reach them; so I hung patiently on, waiting till the pool
should discharge my mast and raft again- and a very long while it
seemed. A juryman is not more glad to get home to supper, after having
been long detained in court by troublesome cases, than I was to see my
raft beginning to work its way out of the whirlpool again. At last I
let go with my hands and feet, and fell heavily into the sea, bard
by my raft on to which I then got, and began to row with my hands.
As for Scylla, the father of gods and men would not let her get
further sight of me- otherwise I should have certainly been lost.]

&quot;Hence I was carried along for NINE DAYS till on the
tenth night the gods stranded me on the Ogygian island,
where dwells the great and powerful goddess Calypso.&quot;&gt;&gt;

Illiad (Book VI)

&lt;&lt;Antea, wife of Proetus, lusted after [Bellerophon],
and would have had him lie with her in secret;
but Bellerophon was an honourable man and would not, so she told
lies about him to Proteus. 'Proetus,' said she, 'kill Bellerophon or
die, for he would have had converse with me against my will.' The king
was angered, but shrank from killing Bellerophon, so he sent him to
Lycia with lying letters of introduction, written on a folded tablet,
and containing much ill against the bearer. He bade Bellerophon
show these letters to his father-in-law, to the end that
he might thus perish; Bellerophon therefore went to Lycia.

When he reached the river Xanthus, which is in Lycia, the king received
him with all goodwill, feasted him NINE DAYS, and killed nine heifers in
his honour, but when rosy-fingered morning appeared upon the tenth day,
he questioned him and desired to see the letter
from his son-in-law Proetus.&gt;&gt;

Sept 13 Eleusinian Mysteries begin

&lt;&lt;Eleusinian Mysteries began on the 15th day of the Greek lunar month
of Boedromion and ended NINE DAYS later. (Other writers mention the
autumn equinox as the starting date and certainly the full moon
nearest the autumn equinox, what we call the Harvest Moon, would be
an appropriate time to celebrate the mysteries of the grain and its
transformation). For centuries, people came from all over the world
to Eleusis to participate in a series of structured rituals, which
produced a change of consciousness in the participants (much like
the mystery-religions of today, which generally call themselves
other things). Most of the initiates were women, but men
(including SOPHOCLES, Aristides and CICERO) also took part.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;[Augustine's mother] Monica died and was buried in the Roman
seaport of Ostia in the year 387 while she and her son, a
recent convert to her faith, waited for clement weather for
the voyage back to their native North Africa. As Augustine
tells it, her death occurs just NINE DAYS after their
famous experience of a shared rapture, the so- called
&quot;vision at Ostia,&quot; in which mother and son mystically
ascend together to glimpse the eternal life in God.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Odin hung upon the branches of Yggdrasil, the sacred Tree. For nine
days and nine nights he suffered. Self wounded by his spear, sacrificed
by his hand, an offering unto himself. In agony and torment he stared
into the bottomless depths of Niflheim, searching the dark pool in
silence. Finally, with great effort, he reached down before him.
His hand was chilled to the bone in the ice cold waters.
With a cry of triumph he grasped the knowledge he sought

- the Sacred RUNEs, their magic and their power.

He took the RUNEs and he used them well.

He carved them upon the shaft of his spear; he carved RUNEs
upon all things. By this means he obtained power over all.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;THE recorded facts of (his) life are very scanty. Of his earlier
life &amp; education nothing is known, He was at any rate a man of
some culture, and had probably received such education
as an Elizabethan Grammar-school allowed. . .

conviction was the pre-eminent virtue of an aristocracy, so that

Cripplegate silk weaver &amp; balladjournalist: Thomas DeLoney(154?-1600)
[(?)Not(?) to be confused with Oxfordian: J.Thomas Looney].
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[ From --   ]

&lt;&lt;(DeLoney founded) one of his ballads on the play of Edward III and
often remembering Shakespeare in the plot and dialogue of his novels.

`I was told it was the great Ballad-maker, T. D., alias Thomas Deloney,
Chronicler of the memorable lives of the Six Yeomen of the West, Jack
of Newbury, the Gentle Craft, &amp;c., and such like honest men, omitted by
Stow, Hollinshed, Grafton, Halle, Froissart, and all the rest of those
well deserving writers. . .Such triviall trinkets and threedbare trash,
had better seemed T.D. whose braines beaten to the yarking up of
Ballades, might more lawfully have glaunst at the quaint conceites
of connycatching and crosse-biting'.
--_Defence of Conny Catching_ (1592) Robert Greene

Nash's Haue With You to Saffron-Walden (1596) gives a list of
Deloney's pamphlets, some of which have entirely perished
or cannot be identified with certainty.

'-as Thomas Deloney, the Balletting Silke-Weauer, of Norwich, hath rime
inough for all myracles, and wit to make a Garland of Good will, more
than the premisses, with an epistle of Momus and Zoylus; whereas his
Muse, from the first peeping foorth, hath stood at Liuery at an Alehouse
wispe, neuer exceeding a penny a quart, day or night, and this deare
yeare, together with the silencing of his looms, scarce that; he being
constrained to betake him to carded Ale: whence it proceedeth that,
since Candlemas or his Iigge of John for the King, not one
merrie Dittie will come from him, but the Thunder-bolt against
Swearers, Repent, England, repent, and the strange iudgments of God.'

Nash's epithet 'the Balletting Silke Weauer of Norwich' seems to point
to that town as the place of his birth, and it is significant that one
of his earliest ballads -- The Lamentation of Beckles (1586) -- was
printed 'for Nicholas Coleman of Norwich'. His name may indicate French
ancestry, and this, combined with his strong Anti-Catholicism, perhaps
points to descent from a Protestant silk-weaving family, one of those
which took refuge in East Anglia from Continental religious persecution.
From the earliest times Norwich had been colonized by Flemish and
Walloon refugees, and in 1571 there were 3,925 aliens dwelling within
the city.(Beauties of England and Wales (Norfolk), p. 132; Bloomfield's
History of Norfolk, vol. iii, p. 282.) The number of silk workers
(Deloney's own craft) seems to have increased considerably during the
latter half of the sixteenth century. 'Among the trading Strangers',
writes Strype, 'that came over into England from Elanders and those
Parts for their Religion, in the said Queen Elizabeths Reign, there
were divers of this Sort that dealt in dressing and preparing Silk
for the other trades';(Survey of London (Stow, edited Strype, 1720)
bk. v, p. 233.) and it may be remembered that alien artisans
figure very prominently in Deloney's novels.

In the next Year [1596] Sir Stephen Slany, Maior, in the Month of July
was brought to his Hands a certain Ballad, containing a Complaint of
great Want and Scarcity of Corn within the Realm. And forasmuch as it
contained in it certain vain and presumptuous matters, bringing in the
Queen, speaking with her People Dialogue wise in very fond and undecent
sort (as the said Maior in his letter, wrote also to the Lord Treasurer
shewed) and prescribing Order for the remedying of this Dearth of Corn;
which was extracted, as it seemed, out of a Book, published by the Lords
the last Year, but done in that Vain and indiscreet manner, as that
thereby the Poor might aggravate their Grief . . . The Maker of this
scurrilous Ballad was one Delonie, an idle Fellow, and one noted with
the like Spirit, in printing a Book for the Silk Weavers: Wherein was
found some such like foolish and disorderly matter. Him the Maior also
was in Search for, but could not yet find him; as he signified also
the said Lord, and sent him a Copy of the foresaid Ballad.'

The Ballad on the Want of Corn has entirely disappeared,
together with the 'Book for the Silk Weavers'.

_The Shadow of Truth_ (1598)

Like to the fatal ominous Rauen which tolls
The sicke mans dirge within his hollow beake,
So euery paper-clothed post in Poules,
To thee (Deloney) mourningly doth speake,
And tells thee of thy hempen tragedy,
The wracks of hungry Tyburne nought to thine.
Such massacre's made of thy balladry,
And thou in griefe, for woe thereof maist pine.

But I was given since to understand, your late general (of the
ballad-mongers), Thomas, died poorly (as ye all must do) and
was honestly buried, which is much to be doubted of some you.'

To Kemp's Nine Daies Wonder (April, 1600) is appended `Kempes humble
request to the impudent generation of Balladmakers and their coherents,
that it would please their Rascalities, to pity his pains in the
great journey he pretends; and not fill the country with lies of
his never-done-acts, as they did in his late Morrice to Norwich.
To the tune of Tomas Deloney's Epitaph.'&gt;&gt;

Kemps nine daies vvonder

Performed in a daunce from

London to Norvvich

Containing the pleasure, paines and kinde entertainment
of William Kemp between London and that Citty
in his late Morrice.

Wherein is somewhat set downe worth note; to reprooue
the slaunders spred of him: many things merry,
nothing hurtfull.

Written by himselfe to satisfie his friends.
LONDON

Printed by E.A. for Nicholas Ling, and are to be
solde at his shop at the west door of Saint
Paules Church. 1600.

The first daies journey, being the first Munday in cleane Lent,
from the right honorable the Lord Mayors of London.

The first mundaye in Lant, the close morning promising a cleere day,
(attended on by Thomas Slye my Taberer, William Bee my servant and
George Sprat, appointed for my overseer, that I should take no other
ease but my prescribed order) my selfe, thats I, otherwise called
Caualiero Kemp, head-Master of Morrice-dauncers, high Head-borough of
heighs, and onely tricker of your Trill-lilles, and best bel-shangles
betweene Sion and mount Surrey [Sion neere Brainford, and mount Surrey
by Norwich.] began frolickly to foote it, from the right honorable the
Lord Mayors of London, towards the right worshipfull (and truly
bountifull) Master Mayors of Norwich.

My setting forward was somewhat before seaven in the morning, my Taberer
stroke up merrily, and as fast as kinde peoples thronging together would
give me leave, thorow London I leapt: By the way many good olde people
and divers others of yonger yeeres, of meere kindness, gave me bowd
sixpences and grotes, blessing me with their harty prayers and
God-speedes.

To make a short end of this tedious description of my entertainment;
Satterday no sooner came, but I returned without the Citty through Saint
Giles his gate; and beganne my Morrice where I left at that gate, but I
entred in at Saint Stephens gate, where one Thomas Gilbert in name of
all the rest of the Cittizens gaue me a friendly and exceeding kind
welcome; I haue no reason to omit, vnlesse I would condemne my selfe of
ingratitude, partlye for the priuate affection of the writer towardes
me: as also for the generall loue and fauour I found in them,
from the highest to the lowest, the richest as the poorest.
It followes in these few lynes.

Master Kemp his welcome to Norwich.

[W]ith hart, and hand, among the rest,
[E]specially you welcome are:
[L]ong looked for as welcome guest,
[C]ome now at last you be from farre.
[O]f most within the Citty, sure,
[M]any good wishes you haue had;
[E]ach one did pray you might indure,
[W]ith courage good the match you made.
[I]ntend they did with gladsome hearts,
[L]ike your well willers, you to meete:
[K]now you also they'l doe their parts,
[E]yther in field or house to greete
[M]ore you then any with you came,
[P]rocur'd thereto with trump and fame.

your well-willer,

T.G.

To the tune of Thomas Delonies Epitaph

My notable Shakerags, the effect of my sute is discouered in the Title
of my supplication; but for your better understandings, for that Iknow
you to be a sort of witles beetle-heads, that can understand nothing,
but what is knockt into your scalpes, These are by these presentes to
certifies vnto your block-headships, that I, William Kemp, whom you had
neer hand rent in sunder with your vnreasonable rimes, am shortly God
willing, to set forward as merily as I may; whether I my selfe know not.
Wherefore, by the way, I would wish ye, imploy not your little wits in
certifying the world that I am gone to Rome, Ierusalem, Uenice, or any
other place at your idle appoint. I knowe the best of ye, by the lyes
ye writ of me, got not the price of a good hat to couer your brainless
heads: If any of ye had come to me, my bounty should haue exceeded the
best of your good masters the Ballad-buiers, I wold haue apparrelled
your dry pates in party coloured bonnets, and bestowed a leash of my
cast belles to haue crown'd ye with cox-combs. I haue made a priuie
search, what priuate Iigmonger of your iolly number, hath been the
Author of these abhominable ballets written of me. I was told it was the
great ballet-maker T.D., alias Tho. Deloney, Chronicler of the memorable
liues of the 6. yeomen of the west, Iack of Newbery, the Gentle-craft,
such like honest me[n]: omitted by Stow, Hollinshead, Grafto[n], Hal,
froysart, and the rest of those wel deseruing writers; but I was giuen
since to understand, your late generall Tho. dyd poorely, as ye all must
do, and was honestly buried; which is much to be doubted of some of you.
The quest of inquiry finding him by death acquited of the Inditement, I
was let to wit, y[e]t another Lord of litle wit, one whose imployment
for the Pageant was vtterly spent, he being knowne to be Eldertons
immediate heyre, was vehemently suspected: but after due inquisition was
made, he was at that time knowne to liue like a man in a mist, hauing
quite giuen ouer the mistery. Still the search continuing, I met a
proper upright youth, onely for a little stooping in the shoulders, all
hart to the heele, a penny Poet, whose first making was the miserable
stolne story of Macdoel, or Macdobeth, or Macsomewhat; for I am sure a
Mac it was, though I neuer had the maw to see it; and hee tolde me there
was a fat filthy ballet-maker, that should haue once been his Iourneyman
to the trade, who liu'd about the towne, and ten to one, but he had thus
terribly abused me and my Taberer: for that he was able to do such a
thing in print. A shrewd presumption! I found him about the bankside,
sitting at a play; I desired to speake with him, had him to a Tauerne,
charg'd a pipe with Tobacco, and then laid this terrible accusation to
his charge. He swels presently like one og the foure windes, the
uiolence of his breath, blew the Tobacco out of the pipe, the heate of
his wrath drunke dry two bowlfuls of Rhenish wine. At length hauing
power to speake, &quot;Name my accuser,&quot; saith he, &quot;or I defye thee, Kemp,
at the quart staffe.&quot; I told him; and all his anger turned to laughter:
swearing it did him good to haue ill words of a hoddy doddy, a habber de
hoy, a chicken, a squib, a squall, one that hath not wit enough to make
a ballet, that, by Pol and Aedipol, would Pol his father, Derick his
dad: doe anie thing, how ill so euer, to please his apish humor. I
hardly beleeued, this youth that I tooke to be gracious, had bin so
graceless; but I heard afterwards his mother in law was eye and eare
witness of his fathers abuse by this blessed childe on a publique stage,
in a merry Hoast of an Innes part. Yet all this while could not I finde
out the true ballet-maker, till buy chaunce a friend of mine puld out of
his packet a booke in Latine, called Mundus Furiosus printed at Cullen,
written by one of the uildest and arrantest lying Cullians that euer
writ booke, his name Iansonius, who, taking upon him to write an
abstract of all the turbulent actions that had beene lately attempted or
performed in Christendome, like an unchristian wretch, writes onely by
report, partially, and scoffingly of such whose pages showes hee was
unworthy to wipe, far indeed he is now dead: farewell he! euery dog must
haue day. But see the luck on't: this beggerly lying busie-bodies name
brought out the Ballad-maker, and, it was generally confirmed, it was
his kinsman: he confesses himselfe guilty, let and man look on his face;
if there be not so redde a colour that all the sope in the towne will
not washe white, let me be turned to a Whiting as I passe betweene Douer
and Callis. Well, God forgiue thee honest fellow, I see thou hast grace
in thee; I prethee do so no more, ceace writing these beastly ballets,
make not good wenches Prophetesses, for little or no profit, nor for a
sixe-penny matter, reuiue not a poore fellowes fault thats hanged for
his offence; it may be thy owne destiny one day; prethee be good to
them. Call vp thy olde Melpomene, whose straubery quill may write the
bloody lines of the blew Lady, and the Prince of the burning crowne;
a better subiect I can tell ye: than your Knight of the Red Crosse.
So farewel, and crosse me no more, I prethee, with thy rabble of
bald rimes, least at my returne I set a crosse on thy forehead
that all men may know thee for a foole. &gt;&gt;

2 Samuel 21:19
And there was again a battle in GOB with the Philistines,
where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite,
slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite,
the staff of whose spear was like a WEAVER's beam.
-----------------------------------------------------------
&quot;Nature her selfe was proud of his designes,
And joy'd to weare the dressing of his lines !
Which were so richly SPUN, and WOVEN so fit,
As, since, she will vouchsafe no other Wit.&quot;
-Ben Jonson

Pericles (Act 5, Scene 3)

GOWER Imagine Pericles arrived at TYRE,
Welcomed and settled to his own desire.
His woeful queen we leave at EPHESUS,
Unto Diana there a votaress.
For certain in our story, she
Would ever with MARINA be:
Be't when she WEAVED the SLEIDED SILK

&quot;WEAVED (S)LEIDED(S)ILK&quot; =&gt;
&quot;I KILL EDWA(S)D DEVE(S)E&quot; [+&quot;Break-spear&quot;]
&quot;(S)hake- (S)peare&quot;

[Issac Asimov's _Guide to Shakespeare_]

&quot;In October 356 B.C. [Diana's Temple at ephe-SUS] was destroyed by fire
and it proved to be a case of deliberate arson. When the culprit was
captured, he was asked why he had done this deed. He replied that
he did it in order that his name might live forever in history.
He was executed and to defeat his desire it was ordered that his
name be erased from all records and never be spoken. (However,
the man had his wish after all, for a name purporting
to be his survives somehow. It is Herostratus.)&quot;
