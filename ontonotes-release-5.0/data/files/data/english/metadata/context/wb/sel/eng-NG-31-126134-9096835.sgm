So are people feeling ready to look at the 2001 releases, now that we're

Yeah, hence why I started a new one. I knew nobody would check a
follow-up to a two-month old thread.

I think we should do it, I've always said a 5-year lag seems
appropriate.  Some may disagree, and if no one seems interested
there's no point in only getting like 8 votes.

&gt; &gt; I think we should do it, I've always said a 5-year lag seems

&gt;&gt; i'm down.

&gt;&gt; i'm taking next week off, with nothing to do after getting back from

&gt; Are you just going to Vegas in general for a vacation, or something

So I've collected the suggestions posted so far and unless there's stuff
that doesn't belong in that year (I haven't checked each and every one),
this is our working list...

I took out Tame One's When Rappers Attack, cos it said 2003 on discogs
AND cduniverse.
On the other hand, with Cunninlynguists' Will Rap For Food, discogs got
it wrong. They say it's 2002, but qn5.com lists it as 2001. They should
kno...

Y'all know the rules. Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines...

Are these just instrumentals of his released songs?  If so, get rid of
this.  If they're original, OK.

No...this dropped in like '99.  I think was pulled off the shelves

Too lazy to check...who listed this in '01?  I have it listed under
'02, my copy has copyright '02.  I have a vague memory of shopping w/
my boy circa May '02 and the 12&quot; had just dropped.  Quick Internet
search finds one site calling it '01 though.

Hmmm...I have an album called _Thug Matrix_ from '01.  _Against All
Odds_ has some but not all of the same songs. I think my _Thug Matrix_
is slightly bootleggy, in that it wasn't on a label, but it was being
sold in retail stores.  Later he put out another &quot;official&quot; _Thug
Matrix_.  TJ, can you break this all down for us and issue a verdict

Hey, don't hater the poster, hate the websites...
I usually rely on discogs, cduniverse or the artists' websites, so there
is no guarantee I get everything right.

So let's keep cleaning out the odd ones and then I'll get you guys
another list to bitch about, in a whole new thread for the lame asses
and blind folks. ;)

You broke it down pretty much 100% accurately.  Because the albums are
different and Thug Matrix was sold in stores I put it on the list in
addition to Against All Odds.  In 03 or 04 he put out a thug matrix 2
which was a similar bootleggy/semi-official type thing that hit retail
and major online spots.  Then last year he put out a cd called &quot;thug
matrix&quot; which was on a label and had nothing to do with either of the
previous 2 Thug Matrices to my knowledge.  Anyway, Tragedy is just a
pain in the ass.

Your 2005 cd is a completely different album from Thug Matrix from
2001 or Thug Matrix 2 from 03ish.  The 01 Cd is an early version of
the Against All Odds album with some 12&quot; type stuff from the post CNN
period of Trag's career.  I believe Thug Matrix 2 served the same role
with regard to Still Reporting (AZ's Sosa disc would pretty much fit
in the same category).  Trag went on to confuse things by putting out
official albums called Thug Matrix and Thug Matrix 2 in 05 and 06.
