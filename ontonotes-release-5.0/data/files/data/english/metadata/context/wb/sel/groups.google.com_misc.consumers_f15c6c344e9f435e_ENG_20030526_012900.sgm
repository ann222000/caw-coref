Hi,
We went to the dealer to buy a Honda Element EX 2WD . The dealer also
showed us a EX 4WD. It had 2700 miles on it. According to him someone had
returned it because they couldn't make the payment.

The carfax report showed 03/22/2003 Odometer reading:34 Source: Sevice
plan Co. General comments:Service contract issued
04/21/2003 Odometer reading:blank space Source:IL motor vehicle dept.
Title# General comments: Title issued, First owner reported, loan or Lien
reported.

Does this mean that the guy who bought it, bought it on April 21st? If so
he has put 2700 miles on it in a month! Isn't that a lot?
What does &quot;Service contract issued&quot; mean?

The invoice price on edmunds is $19,262, MSRP is $20,850 (not including
destination price)
The dealer quoted $19200 + 4.5% financing (He will give us this price only
if we finance with him!)

The dealer has marked 'new' on the pricing sheet he gave us. I feel this
vehicle should be considered used. What implications can this have?

My husband feels its a good deal but I am not convinced. Doesn't the value
of a car decrease 10% when it is driven off a dealers lot? Is this a good
deal or are we getting ripped off?

Would you buy this car or would you go for a new 2WD at MSRP? Any input
will be greatly appreciated.

"/> Used! As soon as an owner takes possession it can no longer be
considered &quot;new&quot;.

And 2700 miles sounds like a lot. I wouldn't trust the dealer's story
either. It could have
been driven by himself or someone on the staff after it was returned and
that's the story
they are using to explain 2700 miles. Think about it, that's almost 100
miles a day!

In either case, once it's been driven, I'd knock about 20% off the price
of the car, plus
about $0.30 a mile, just like the dealer would do if you leased the car.

2) used cars generally to not have the same extensive warranty coverage

Anyhow, why buy a suspect car from this guy when you can pay nearly an

for a car that really is new, or pay a lower price for a car that
everyone agrees is used?

"/> At best the dealer is being dishonest with you. At worst he is
attempting a fraudulent sale. I don't know what the rules are in IL
but in CA a car can be sold as new only if it hasn't been previously
registered or titled. This allows them to run up miles on a &quot;program&quot;
car that is driven with dealer license plates on the car.

You can't trust the dealer now, so are you going to be able to trust
him if you need factory service? Go someplace else. Do not even
consider buying from this dealer.

You also might try to contact the state agency that regulates car
dealers in IL since you have a copy of the pricing as evidence.
Although I suspect he will just tell the state it &quot;was a mistake,&quot; he
might have a history of shady deals and this might add ammo for the
state.

Good luck. Tell us what you decide.

According to the Motley Fool website, the depreciation on a new car or
truck can be as much as 40% in the first year (more typically,
depreciation is over 20%). Buying a new car is one of the worst things
you can do with your money; Buying a &quot;new&quot; car like the one you're
talking about could be even worse, though.

IAC, it behooves you to save as much money as you can on the purchase
price; let's be nice and say that your Honda--just by virtue of its
brand name--will depreciate only 15% during its first year. 15% of $20K
is 3,000. Divided evenly over 12 months, that's an extra $250 per month
you're paying on that vehicle over and above the principle, interest,
insurance, gas and maintenance payments, so you should figure that much
more into your monthly budget during the first year. You'll need to
budget just slightly less each year thereafter on depreciation to
apprehend the real cost of your &quot;new&quot; vehicle.

Hope you really enjoy that new car smell.

I would call it &quot;pre driven&quot; :)

RUN away from this 'deal' as fast as you can. At the least, I would offer
2,000 or 3,000 less than he is asking. Even then, one wonders why the car
was returned--if the previous buyer couldn't make even one payment, one
wonders what he or she did to the car in the interim.

I would investigate what the official used price is for a vehicle like this
(2700 miles). It may that the Honda Element is so new that you can't get
numbers from Kelly Blue Book, but that's a place to start for determining what
it's really worth.

Dishonesty from a car dealer? I can't see why everyone else seemed so
shocked. Aren't these guys known for being master manipulators? Running away
from one will likely put you at another dishonest car dealer, won't it?

My main concern would be with the real reason the vehicle has 2700 miles on
it. It's unlikely that they would tell you the full story on that. It may be
that the first purchaser returned the vehicle because it had some major
problem that couldn't be addressed under the warranty. Now you would be stuck
with it.

"/> Well, there's dishonest and then there's dishonest.

*Any* car dealer is going to try to get you to pay as much as possible
for your car. They have a lot of tricks they use, like getting you to
concentrate on the payment instead of the price, having you negotiate
with a salesman who can't (or says he can't) make a final price (has
to be approved by the manager), etc. They'll also try to lowball your
trade-in.

But all of that is just negotiation. They're probably better at it
than you are, because they do it all the time. But if you keep the
price you are willing to pay firmly in mind, you can at least put a
cap on all this. And of course look at &quot;confessions of a car
salesman&quot; at  www.edmunds.com/advice

But not every car dealer is going to outright _lie_ about whether the
car is new or used. If you have somebody who goes that far, you know
you're dealing with somebody near the bottom of the slimepool. If you
try a different dealership, you might at least find somebody a little
nearer the surface.

customers. &quot;Oh, I love that color&quot;, does not put one in a good
bargaining position. ;-)

&gt;2. Run away fast. You don't want to do business with that dealer.

"/> I guaranty you that it wasn't the sales manager or the dealer that made the
statement that the vehicle was new. They are not that stupid as to jeopardize
their license by trying to sell a used car as new. It was some uninformed,
unintelligent salesman just trying to push a sale. Had he actually written the
order and put 'NEW' on it, his manager would have rejected the deal.

Someone brought up Program cars....

Well I used to buy them (Program cars) on a regular basis. My neighbor
was a zone rep for
a major manufacturer untl re retired last year..
I would buy a car that was the current model year maybe 6 months old,
never more then 6,000
miles and carried a full warranty for about 60 percent of the sticker
price...

I see no reason to pay anywhere close to sticker on a previously titled
car (its used) ..period..
.
I do know of one individual who purchased a car with nothing down and
actually drove the car for close to a month when their financing was
revoked..(misreprenated info by the buyer) And the car was taken back by
the dealer... But this happened 20 years ago !

It may vary by state, but in Ohio if its been titled then its a used
vehicle regardless of how many miles. As for 2700 mile/month, 2700
miles is just under 700/week, 140/day (5days) or 70 miles one way to
work. I know lots of people that put that much milage on a vehicle. I
run about 50/day, so no thats not a lot of miles for a month for some
people.

I think the biggest question about this deal is why would anyone want
to buy a butt ugly vehicle like the Honda Element. 2003 ugly car of
the year.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; We went to the dealer to buy a Honda Element EX 2WD . The dealer also
&gt; showed us a EX 4WD. It had 2700 miles on it. According to him someone had
&gt; returned it because they couldn't make the payment.

&gt; The carfax report showed 03/22/2003 Odometer reading:34 Source: Sevice
&gt; plan Co. General comments:Service contract issued
&gt; 04/21/2003 Odometer reading:blank space Source:IL motor vehicle dept.
&gt; Title# General comments: Title issued, First owner reported, loan or Lien
&gt; reported.

&gt; Does this mean that the guy who bought it, bought it on April 21st? If so
&gt; he has put 2700 miles on it in a month! Isn't that a lot?
&gt; What does &quot;Service contract issued&quot; mean?

&gt; The invoice price on edmunds is $19,262, MSRP is $20,850 (not including
&gt; destination price)
&gt; The dealer quoted $19200 + 4.5% financing (He will give us this price only
&gt; if we finance with him!)

&gt; The dealer has marked 'new' on the pricing sheet he gave us. I feel this
&gt; vehicle should be considered used. What implications can this have?

&gt; My husband feels its a good deal but I am not convinced. Doesn't the value
&gt; of a car decrease 10% when it is driven off a dealers lot? Is this a good
&gt; deal or are we getting ripped off?

&gt; Would you buy this car or would you go for a new 2WD at MSRP? Any input
&gt; will be greatly appreciated.

This a used car being sold to you at a new car price so yes, you should get
at least 10% + some more because of the mileage.

No, you're right, this is a criminal line. Dealers do not like
crossing this line into fraud. It *really* looks bad with the
franchisee. The franchise is worth *millions* and can be pulled
for any significant wrong-doing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;There is entirely too little information in this post to justify any
&gt;&gt;such decision. If one is buying a car to drive, rather than buying it
&gt;&gt;as an investment, prior ownership or titling has no relevance
&gt;&gt;whatsoever.

&gt; Not if you're paying new car price for the used car. Would you pay new car
&gt; price for a car that has already depreciated 25%?

"/> There's something else to consider, though. You can usually get better
deals when shopping for a loan for a NEW car, as opposed to shopping for a
loan for a USED car. For example, you might get a percentage rate 2% lower
if you buy a NEW vehicle. While it's not a smart idea to pay new price for
a vehicle with a previous title and 2700 miles on it, the money might work
out to be a wash if the OP can get a significantly lower interest rate on
the loan, which could save thousands over the life of the loan.

But if it was me, I would run, not walk, away from a dealer who tried to
pass off a used vehicle as a new one. Ironically, most dealers want to
charge MORE THAN NEW MSRP for slightly used vehicles like the one in the OP.
So the dealer in the OP sounds really sleazy. That is, he's not content to
make the usual markup for a slighly used vehicle . . . he's going to REALLY
jack up the price by trying to pass it off as new. Yikes.

Oh, and 2700 miles is a bit above average for one month of use, but not
outrageous. My last vehicle often had two oil changes per month . . . at
3000 mile intervals. -Dave
