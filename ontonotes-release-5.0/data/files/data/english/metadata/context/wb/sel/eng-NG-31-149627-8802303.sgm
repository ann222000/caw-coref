*Journey from Bohra (a kind of Shiaa) to True Muslim by believing on the
Quraan*

http://www.islamhelpline.com/about.asp

Mu' meneen Brothers and Sisters,

As Salaam Aleikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.  (May Allah's Peace, Mercy
and Blessings be upon all of you)

We are team of brothers on a mission to spread the true deen of Islam.

We ask for no reward and no thanks from our readers in the least. Our reward
is in the safe custody of the Lord of the Worlds

Our mission is to proclaim the truth from the Holy Quran and let the people
decide for themselves what path they want to choose. When the truth comes,
falsehood will vanish by itself.

Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 17 Surah Bani Israel verse 81:

And declare, &quot;The Truth has come and falsehood has vanished! And falsehood
is a thing that must by its nature vanish

Our duty is to invite our Bohra brethren to read and understand the Quran
and realize that the promises Allah makes in the Holy Quran will definitely
come to pass. The promises made by the leaders of the hierarchy will vanish
on the Day of Judgment. Our mission is more to do with the hereafter and its
accounting, rather than this transitory worldly life.

We have no copyright issues on our articles and encourage the brothers who
read our messages to send them to anyone they wish … for the Pleasure of
Allah Alone.

May Allah reward every brother and sister who works in propagating Allah's
true deen of Islam to all mankind.

May Allah guide you and us all to the Siraat ul Mustaqeem. May Allah take us
all into His infinite Mercy and Protection. Ameen.

Your brother and well-wisher in Islam,

Burhan

*One of our brothers/sisters has asked this question:*

*I am going in your personel life ,I know before you were Bohra ,So can u
tell us what make you change from that &amp; also can you write about how you
got all this knowledge &amp; how much time it took to get all this knowledge &amp;
the place where u learned all this things.I am sure you will reply this
question.*

In the name of Allah, We praise Him, seek His help and ask for His
forgiveness. Whoever Allah guides none can misguide, and whoever He allows
to fall astray, none can guide them aright. We bear witness that there is no
one (no idol,  no person,  no grave, no prophet,  no imam,  no dai,
nobody!) worthy of worship but Allah Alone, and we bear witness that
Muhammad(saws) is His slave-servant and the seal of His Messengers.

Allah is my witness,  that whatever I am about to tell you about my personal
life is absolutely true.   The story is not sensational,   nor is it one of
a sudden change of heart,  nor is it one particular incident which made me
turn to Allah in repentance!    It is just a simple,  humane story and
experience!

Allah has indeed blessed me with every possible 'nehmah' there can be… a
healthy life,  enough 'rizk',  God-fearing wife,  obedient and healthy
children,  brothers and sisters, parents, … there is not a 'nehmah' that I
can think of which Allah has not blessed me with.   And above all,  Allah
guided me to read and understand the Holy Quran and thus leave all the other
beings that we bowed down to,  and brought me to understand who our Creator
is,  and what are His Rights on His slaves.

I was born in a devoutly obedient 'Bohra' family.   My late father was given
the 'laqab' of sheikh by the leadership when I was probably an infant,  thus
I do not recollect the date.   He spent all his life and probably all his
wealth in the service of the 'daawat'.    He used to do regular 'ziyaafats'
in our house,  which obviously was considered a big deal at that time…  Our
whole lives revolved around the Syedna and his families,  and my father was
very close to some of the bhaisahebs and they were regular visitors to our
place.  Every year our holidays  revolved around doing the 'ziyaarahs' of
all the graves of the past Dais in India.   We basically grew up in a
devoutly 'believing' Bohra family … attended every 'waaz' in Aashura,
attended regular prayers and the 'big nights' in Ramadan,   regularly
visited the 'Raudat Tahera',  went to the madrasa in Badri Mahal, etc.
That was predominantly my &quot;Bohra' knowledge base,  and I just believed
everything I heard in the 'waaz',  even if it did not make sense.  I was
even enrolled to attend the Jamiat-us-Safiya in Surat,  but due to some
circumstances,  I did not attend it.    My parents used to force us to
pray,  and read Quran, etc. ,  but because I did not understand anything
anyways,  I just tried to avoid praying regularly.    Just did all the
basics and always tried to stay away from trouble.   Whenever I asked any
question to either my parents or my elders,  they always rebuked me …
basically I was told to shut up and obey the Syedna,  and believe like they
believed that he will guide us to Paradise.

I was yet in my youth,  but I always remembered my elders talking between
themselves about the bhaisahebs and how each of them was trying to extort
more and more money from them in different ways,  and almost always got away
with it.   I also sat through several of the negotiations which were done
prior to the salaam of the Syedna in the 'ziyaafats',  and could clearly see
that these people were more interested in money,  than the actual deen.
But I was too young,  and had absolutely no knowledge… just followed my
father and my elders blindly and believed in everything they believed in,
without ever using my common-sense or getting any guidance from the Holy
Quran.

When I was about 18 years old,  a muslim friend invited me to come to his
house for an Islamic lecture from the Holy Quran.    I was so engrained in
the beliefs which I was taught from childhood,   that I was absolutely
closed to any ideas or knowledge which was not with the so called 'raza' of
the leadership.   We were taught from childhood that the Quran is a Book
which cannot be understood by us,  and it was the sole monopoly of the
Syedna and his family.   Only they were authorized by Allah to understand
it,  and if we tried to understand it,  like the other muslims,  we too
would be mis-guided!    I was taught that each aayah of the Quran has
several meanings,  and each aayah has hidden meanings (taaweel) which we
just could not comprehend.

Anyways,  I attended this lecture at my friends house.    The person giving
the lecture read one of the Surahs from the Last Chapter and gave a lecture
giving meanings for each word and each aayah.    It was really refreshing
and interesting for me to hear the meanings of the Quran.    The lecture was
set in a very informal atmosphere,  unlike the 'waaz' and 'darees' I was
used to going.    After the lecture,  the scholar asked if we had any
questions on the subject or anything else in Islam.    I was never allowed
to ask any questions to the Bohra aamils or leadership or scholar,  and this
gave me a good opportunity to vent my questions on Islam.     The scholar
was extremely learned and a very kind and gentle man,  who accepted any sort
of questions with patience and answered each of them with 'hikmah' and
wisdom,  always giving evidence from the Holy Quran,  which obviously was
irrefutable… because whatever the Holy Quran says makes absolute logic and
is acceptable to every person who has basic common-sense.

But I was so engrained in my ignorance from the little knowledge gained at
the 'waaz',  that I challenged the scholar in almost everything he said.   I
said that we Bohras were on the Right Path,  and everything he was saying
was incorrect!!    The scholar tried to explain giving evidence from the
Holy Quran,  who Allah is,  what are His Attributes,  who is the Messenger
of Allah (saws),  what was his mission,  and what kind of people will
go to Paradise
and what kind of people will go to Hell Fire… all according to the Quran.
But since I did not have an iota of knowledge from the Quran,  and all my
knowledge was from the 'waaz' and here-say of the Bohras,  I just kept on
challenging him without any knowledge.    But the scholar kept on answering
all my questions with patience,  no matter how rude or challenging they
were… and never ever showed any dissent!    He regularly asked me to show
him evidence,  either from the Quran or the Sunnah of the Messenger (saws)….
And obviously I was not able to produce any!   My only answer used to be
that our 'Maula' and our 'bhaisaheb' does this and says this….  And he used
to say,  &quot;I respect your Maula,  but I also know that he is not the Creator
of this Universe…  Allah is!… and This Quran is His Book of guidance .. and
He has appointed the Messenger Mohamed ar Rasool Allah (saws) …. And your
'Maula' is not the Master of the Day of Qiyaamah….&quot;.   All his arguments
were always based on the Quran and obviously I could not say anything to
challenge the Quran.

I then started attending these weekly lectures from the Holy Quran
regularly,  although now I realize,  I just closed my heart to the guidance
of the Quran …. And did not believe a word he said against my 'Bohra'
beliefs….  I must have attended the weekly classes for almost 2 years … and
everytime I used to challenge everything he said,  always believing in what
the Syedna and the bhaisahebs had said!    It came to a point where I used
to get upset and was even rude at times … but this scholar never showed an
iota of dissent,  and treated me better than most of the other listeners!
He used to always tell me to read the Quran,  but I always refused,  saying
that we were not allowed by the Bohra leadership,  and would never read
without the 'raza' of the Syedna.

One day this scholar came to me in private,  and by this time,  I obviously
started liking this brother for his
