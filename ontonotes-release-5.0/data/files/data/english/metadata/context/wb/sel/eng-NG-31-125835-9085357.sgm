i'm in a lower ground/basement flat &amp; we were flooded back in July, we've
had the plaster &amp; sand/cement off the walls up to 1.2m high &amp; the
dehumidifiers &amp; fan blowers have been going at it for nearly 6 wks now, the
surveyor said it should be certified dry in the next few weeks. Next i
assume would be to get the brick walls injected with silicone, i can still
see the bore holes in my brick wall 6&quot; above my concrete floor when this was
done ?? yrs ago before i bought the flat. But another surveyor says silicone
injection is rubbish in his opinion, a good sand/cement course followed by
finishing plaster would be OK. Any advice? note* the concrete floor does
have a DPC sheet under which runs up to the brick wall, i found this when i
poked around at it to see what was below :)

i'm thinking of doing the silicone injection myself to save money, have done
some research on other websites but my question is, what brand &amp; any
recommendations? there seem to be quite a few ranging from £20-£60 a tube!!
the general advice given is to inject downwards into the bore hole &amp; fill it
up to the opening. My question is... how does the silicone work within the
brickwork? does it permeate over time into the bricks &amp; form a kind of
chemical seal to prevent rising damp? the old boreholes i have now are all
empty, clean as a whistle which leads me to think it does permeate into the
bricks.

The silicon is absorbed into the bricks like a sponge.

The cheapest method would be to hire the injecting equipment from somewhere
like HSS. Wands (which have perforations) are placed into the holes &amp; the
silicon pumped under pressure. This will have to be done inside &amp; out of the
property prior to replastering.
