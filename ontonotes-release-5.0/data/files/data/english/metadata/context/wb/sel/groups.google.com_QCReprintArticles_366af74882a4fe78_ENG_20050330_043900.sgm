5 Steps You Can Take Today To Lower Blood Pressure Naturally
Copyright © 2005 Frank Mangano
The Silent Killer Exposed
http://www.thesilentkillerexposed.com

High blood pressure, or hypertension, is not something to be
taken lightly. It is a serious disease the cause of which is
unknown. One fact health care professionals do know is that
left untreated, high blood pressure over time can lead to
serious heart disease and other vascular troubles, even death.

Blood pressure medications come in a wide range of formulas and
dosages; each aimed at reducing the pressure going through the
blood vessels either as the heart pumps blood or relaxes. Some
medications strengthen the blood vessels while others thin the
blood in an effort to reduce the strain. Trial and error is
usually a doctor’s only course of action when determining which
combination of drugs and treatments will benefit a specific
patient. The problem with this approach is the dangerous side
effects, which often accompany these medications.

There is however some good news about hypertension! There are
steps you can take today that will begin to lower your blood
pressure almost immediately. Overtime, the result is a sustained
healthy blood pressure reading that supports your blood vessels
and heart for years to come.

Start with these 5 easy lifestyle changes. Always consult with
your doctor before trying anything new with your health regime,
and never go off of any medication without the advice of your
doctor. Here is a list that any doctor can approve of:

1. Drink Water. Yes, water is a way to cleanse and refresh
every part of the body, even your blood vessels. Drink 8-10
glasses each day to flush out excess salt and toxins that make
their way into the blood stream. You can use water to replace
some drinks containing caffeine that temporarily raise blood
pressure.

2. Stop Smoking. If you are a long time smoker, you know how it
affects your breathing. What you may not realize is its impact
on your blood pressure. If you can’t quit completely, then cut
down. Even a 50% reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked
each week can help.

3. Exercise. A cardiovascular workout strengthens the heart.
This is important because high blood pressure over time puts
added strain on the heart. Just 20 minutes, 3 times per week of
a sustained increase in heart rate will aid in lowering blood
pressure.

4. Eat Right. If you are eating better and exercising, a nice
by-product will be weight loss. By reducing your weight by 10%,
you can significantly lower blood pressure. A diet that includes
the freshest fruits and vegetables will support healthy blood
pressure. Reduce or eliminate salt intake, and especially beware
of “hidden” sodium found abundantly in pre-packaged convenience
foods.

5. Relax. Many people have a temporary raise in blood pressure
when they are under stress. If you have high blood pressure
because you are over weight or have a family history of
hypertension, then stress raises it that much more. Try
taking a walk, meditating or listening to relaxing music to
take the edge off a stressful day. Make time for decompressing
each and every day.
