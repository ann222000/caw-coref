&quot;Hey! Watch it.&quot;

It starts when she trips, running through the cargo bay between the boxes. Her
ankle twists and she loses her balance, falling face first into his chest. His
arms catch her around the waist and she feels his hands at the base of her
spine.

&quot;Sorry Jayne!&quot; Kaylee gasps out.

Then sprints away because she can hear River's laugh getting closer and see a
flash of color too close for comfort. Her breath is hot and hard in her chest,
her own laugh bubbling up. Her feet know the path of the ship and they land
surely on every step, her hand clutching the stair rails and pulling her up
faster as she squeals her delight in getting away. She doesn't stop, doesn't
have the time.

But her skin remembers, stores it away for later, the feel of those large hands
steadying her. A glint in his eye that she doesn't recall being there before,
not for her anyways.

***

Hell. There are four women on this gorram boat and a helluva lot more nights to
be spending alone. Thoughts wander sometimes, to the women he sees everyday, he
ain't been bothered about it much before, but he's been focusing on Kaylee a
lot lately and he can't be held responsible for it. Not when she grins at him
like that, not when her hands on his arm make him stand rock still.

Who went ahead and told her it was okay to be winking at him? To smile at him
so bright when he gave her those gorram apples way back after Ariel? Sure as
hell wasn't him. She's just about the only one who'll look at him like he's
worth a damn and it cuts just as deep to know he's not.

Somebody has to put a stop to it. Right shameless it is. If'n she found out
about some of his thoughts, Jayne knows she'd stop smiling.

***

Kaylee likes to cook. Most of the times they ain't got much to work with, but
she'll do her damnedest to make it special when it's her turn. She likes the
idea of creating meals that they all eat, that they gather and laugh and talk
over. It makes her warm.

Cooking ain't much different to fixing engines, she thinks. People need both.
She takes care of Serenity and they go on flying. She takes care of their
bellies and they go on living. Sliding the pin into a grav thruster just right,
getting her hands good and greasy, is just the same as feeling food mulch
between her fingers. Putting the bits together so that when it's done nobody
can much determine the separate pieces, just the shiny result.

Sometime during dinner she becomes intensely aware that Jayne won't meet her
eyes. It jolts her, makes her wonder, she don't like tensions, especially when
they revolve around her.

She realizes that Simon has been trying to get her attention for some time.

***

He didn't hang about the table long after dinner, needed to get away. Jayne's
not too sure why there's such a shift, why Kaylee just spent the whole meal
trying to wheedle him into meeting her eyes, or why he had to avoid them.

There are footsteps overhead as he hauls himself up into chin lifts from the
handles attached under the gangway. His eyes follow the flash of her red shirt
down the stairs. Mandarin curses spill easily from her lips, enough to make -
well, him - blush. Jayne can see the angry flush on the back of her neck.

&quot;Doc strike out again, did he?&quot;

He can't resist teasing her, but the moment she jumps and spins to face him,
face angry and more than a hint of tear in her eye, he wishes he'd found a way.

&quot;Shove it, Jayne.&quot; Her hands are shaking and she tries to hide it by brushing
her hair behind her ears.

&quot;Aw, c'mon Kaylee.&quot; He's genuinely hurt by her anger and he knows she'll soften
if he shows it. &quot;I didn't do nothin'.&quot;

&quot;What's wrong with me, Jayne?&quot; Her sigh comes out in a bitter gust of air as
she spreads her arms out and challenges him. &quot;Am I that hideous?&quot;

He gives a slow, very deliberate gaze up and down her body, smiling at the
blush that floods her cheeks.

&quot;Ain't nothing wrong from this angle.&quot; There's plenty right with her, from what
he can see. Given the invitation, Jayne takes his time in letting his eyes seek
out the little hollow in the front of her neck where a butterfly medallion
nestles, the slope of her shoulders, a curling tendril of hair under her ear,
the hourglass curve of her waist between her breasts and hips, the coveralls
which cover nothing when she lets them hang around her waist. &quot;Why? What angle
you showin' him?&quot;

It brings a twinkle to her eyes and he sees her mouth twitch, but she's damned
stubborn and intent on staying mad.

&quot;Don't matter none, he ain't noticed one yet.&quot;

&quot;Doc ain't gonna change.&quot; He finds a particularly self serving moment to
dispense the advice he's been holding on to for a while now. &quot;You need to
forget him and move on.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; She looks at him as if he's still struggling to grasp the basics of
breathing in and breathing out. In that order. &quot;That's easy for you to say,
Jayne, you got girls all over the place when we stop. Not too many choices for
me.&quot;

He watches her count it out for him on her fingers.

&quot;Wash is married. Mal is... well, the Captain is the Captain. Simon is
obviously incapable of human interaction.&quot; She gives an adorable little growl
of frustration, running out of options at three. &quot;Hell, even Inara won't
service crew.&quot;

Jayne's eyes spark up, he's grinning.

&quot;Inara, huh?&quot;

&quot;I was just sayin'.&quot; She glares and punches him lightly on the arm, but there's
still light in her eyes.

&quot;Well?&quot; He asks. &quot;Ain't you forgettin' someone? There's another man on this
ship, you know.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Light dawns on her face, followed instantly by another frown. &quot;I hardly
think the Sheppard's up for the job neither.&quot;

&quot;And?&quot; He pushes, urging her on with his eyes. He's just about ready to stamp
his foot like a child. &quot;Dammit, Kaylee! Ain't I a man?&quot;

She laughs. Out loud.

&quot;Sure, Jayne, sure. You and me. Right here.&quot; Her challenge dies on her lips as
he keeps looking at her, eyebrow raised, and she gets all flustered and jittery
again. &quot;Wo duh ma. You're serious?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; He thrusts his chin forward. &quot;What's wrong with that?&quot;

She stops smiling.

&quot;That's enough, Jayne.&quot;

&quot;No, hey.&quot; It's his turn now. &quot;What's wrong with me, then?&quot;

Her eyes slide down from his face and he can see them glitter as she studies
him, as seriously as he studied her. He manages to flex his biceps when her
glance passes them and it makes her smile again.

&quot;Um, well, no.&quot; She has to swallow. &quot;Nothing.&quot;

&quot;Then?&quot;

He takes a step closer to her. She doesn't step back, but she starts to look
around for a quick exit should he bring his hands up, just like he decides to
do, and place them on either side of her shoulders against the stairs behind
her.

&quot;You ain't never looked at me like that before, Jayne.&quot; She accuses.

&quot;Sure about that?&quot; He asks casually, lifting her hair off her shoulder. &quot;Are
ya, little Kaylee?&quot;

She's blushing, she keeps having to look down and away from his eyes, which he
keeps locked on hers, her hands keep fluttering, unable to stay still, but she
ain't making any moves to get away, not really. Jayne can read a body as well
as the next person.

&quot;Well,&quot; She all but pouts it. &quot;You ain't said nothing.&quot;

He shrugs.

&quot;Neither have you.&quot; Her mouth opens to protest before she can stop it and he
grins, knows he's caught her. &quot;Though, by that expression, you have had
thoughts.&quot;

&quot;What expression?&quot;

&quot;That one.&quot; He laughs. &quot;Where your brows shoot right up an' your eyes go all
wide an' you pretend to be as innocent as a kitten, when we all know you're
anything but.&quot;

She grins.

&quot;You think you're so...&quot;

And she's probably right, he's willing to admit it, whatever she was going to
say before he leans forward and kisses her. It's slow and gentle and he feels
her soften against him, feels her hand come up against his chest and linger
there. He keeps his eyes open so he can watch hers flutter closed.

***

Her pulse escalates, speeds up as she closes her fingers around his shirt and
pulls him closer. Kaylee lets out the breath that got caught in her throat and
feels his hand close around the side of her head, warm and trembling, as they
break apart. His lips are shining.

Sounds come from above them, Mal and Inara, voices breaking out of her shuttle.
Jayne's arm grabs her around the waist and pulls her further under the stairs.
She giggles against him, can't help it as his eyes warn her to keep quiet. It's
contagious and he grins as his shoulders begin to shake.

Kaylee likes that, the feel of him rumbling against her, his whole body
enjoying the moment. She's in no hurry to let him go, even after the voices and
footsteps float down and away and they're alone again. She reaches up and cups
his chin.

&quot;You're all scratchy.&quot; She pouts, pretending to complain, pretending that the
rough feel of it against her skin wasn't sending sparks around her body.

&quot;You know.&quot; His voice is a low growl, thicker than she remembers it. &quot;You're
real pretty.&quot;

She rolls her eyes and pushes against his shoulder.

&quot;You don't have to sound so surprised.&quot;

His eyes widen and he's opening his mouth to negate her implication, but she
gets up on her tippy toes and kisses the end of his nose. A quick peck, gone
before he knows it's there. She pokes her tongue out at his confusion.

&quot;I got work to do.&quot;

His hand trails on her hip as she walks away and she decides that she likes it,
likes the sudden change of pace, the definite direction. Kaylee smiles to
herself as she flies up the stairs, in a much better mood than when she came
down them.

***

His hand lingers on the door to his bunk when he thinks about the engine room.
He imagines that it's glowing, warm and alive. It takes a split second for him
to change direction.

She's there, lying on the floor, looking up into the big beating machine, arms
reaching up into moving parts. Sometimes it scares him when she does that, her
skin is so soft and machines got an ugly way of changing that. He waits until
she lets her arms fall again, free of the engine.

&quot;Forgotten him yet?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; She raises her head and it hits the metal. A low groan sounds as she
lowers it back to the floor, hand cupping her forehead. She looks at him,
slightly dazed. &quot;Forgot who?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Jayne grins, knowing she's just fine. &quot;I thought so.&quot;

He chuckles all the way back to his bunk.

***

Kaylee sits at the dining table, eating breakfast, protein by any other name.
Her hand jumps out and slaps at River's. The girl giggles and the game starts
again. River tries to get Kaylee's hand, she's focusing hard, eyes watching
everything. Kaylee likes it when she smiles, when she's enjoying herself.

The room is buzzing with conversation, Simon talking to Book, Mal talking to
Zoe. It's almost impossible not to notice when they go quite around her.
Everyone is looking up at Jayne who has just entered. She chews her bottom lip,
sure suddenly that everyone knows, everyone can see.

She does sneak a quick glance at him, though, and sees with some surprise that
his neck is bare, skin gleaming pink around the neatly trimmed beard. He gives
her a small grin, not at all subtle, but it makes her look down again, all warm
and tingly. She sees River looking back and forth between her and Jayne, eyes
glowing with awareness.

&quot;Jayne?&quot; Mal's all curious. &quot;You shave this morning?&quot;

Kaylee laughs so hard that milk substitute comes out of her nose.

***

Jayne moves his shoulder in circles, testing it. He can feel the skin pulling
at the new stitches as he gestures to Mal that it's his turn in the infirmary.
They all came back a little bruised and bloody this time. Zoe and Wash have
already disappeared, their usual state of affairs after a job with action, and
they won't surface for hours yet. Book is babysitting River and Inara won't be
back until nightfall.

That leaves him and Kaylee and he knows she's down in the cargo bay, fussing
over the goods because she can't fuss over them. None of them are badly hurt
and Mal will only tease her for carrying on about it. Jayne don't mind none, he
kinda likes the way she cares if they're hurt, especially if she's caring about
him.

He stands at the top of the stairs watching her. She's sorted the boxes as much
as she can, into sections that will go into each compartment, but she hasn't
tried to carry any of 'em by herself. Probably knows that he or Mal would skin
her alive if she tried. He can tell she wants to, sees it in the way she
hesitates with her hands at the edges of each box.

&quot;Don't you dare.&quot; He warns.

&quot;Jayne!&quot; She calls up, her hands springing behind her back as if he'd caught
her doing something wrong, and he likes his name in her voice. &quot;You're
okay?&quot;

&quot;Course I am.&quot; He grunts back as he begins to walk down the stairs. &quot;Takes
more'n a knife to stop me.&quot;

She winces and he wishes he had better words, something pretty that the doc
might use. Her eyes, when he reaches her, look straight at the fresh bandage
and he gets the impression that she wants to touch him, to feel for herself
that he's okay. Jayne finds that he wants her to.

&quot;See?&quot; He says as he pulls his shirt down over his shoulder. &quot;Barely a scratch.&quot;

***

He's all but grabbing her hand and placing it on his wound and it makes her
smile. Kaylee doesn't like to disappoint, so she reaches up and presses the
edges of the bandage, feeling his collar bone under skin. She makes the
appropriate whimper of concern and he breathes in as she runs a hand down the
muscles of his arm.

&quot;Big burly men.&quot; He says as he steps back, putting his hand on either edge of a
crate, waiting for her. &quot;Lots of 'em.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; She smiles, letting him have his moment.

They heft the cargo together and Kaylee sees him wince, but he doesn't say
anything and it doesn't stop him trying to shoulder more than his fair share of
the weight from her. When they slide one of the crates into the spaces, they're
crouched down next to each other and Kaylee likes the fact of their arms
pressed together, wrist to elbow, and that he doesn't pull away. She tests it,
moves so that their shoulders touch for a second.

&quot;An ambush.&quot; He brags again and she's not listening to his words, so much as
the deep cadence of his voice, the roll of it through his throat. &quot;But I had
Vera.&quot;

She pictures his hands cradling his favorite gun, cocking it, fingers squeezing
the trigger until she popped. It's a thought that creates others, spills them
into her brain before she can stop it.

Kaylee blinks her eyes, wide and innocent.

&quot;Never learnt how to hold a gun proper.&quot;

Jayne's mouth splits into a grin as he considers her face, his eyes are sharp
and they're not missing much. She feels the blush spread over her cheeks, knows
that he's caught her again, knows that she meant him to.

&quot;It's easy enough.&quot; She stands still as he steps behind her, reaches around and
takes her hands. She feels her fingers close around cold metal and wonders if
she shivers because of the gun or his body. &quot;Don't be scared of it.&quot;

His chin juts over her shoulder and if she turns her head she'll be kissing
him. Yeah, she decides, it's his body.

&quot;Hold it like you know it.&quot; They both know what he means by that as he presses
her fingers into the right places. She breathes deep, presses her back into his
chest. &quot;Ya gotta keep your arms steady.&quot;

Like she has any chance of keeping things steady right now.

&quot;Then you just squeeze the trigger.&quot;

Kaylee thinks maybe he's forgotten a lot of things, stuff even she knows, like
taking off the safety, loading the bullets, hell, even aiming straight, but she
don't think either of them care much about the gun anymore.

&quot;Kaylee?&quot;

His voice is thicker and deeper again and she knows she's supposed to answer,
say something. What she does is twist in his arms, push herself up on her toes
and kiss him.

Hard.

***

Damned if she ain't kissing him again. Hot tongue in his mouth and hands around
his neck and she's pulling him down. The gun dangles loose in his hand and he
has to remind himself that the shells are empty and the safety is on before he
drops it.

It sounds loud as it echoes off the floor.

Jayne wraps his hands around her waist, pulls her closer and up against him.
She's all tiny like this, when he can actually feel how his hands take up all
the space her sides have, when he can lay one hand spread all over the small of
her back, tiny in a way she don't seem when he usually looks at her.

She's all soft up against him. Soft as he snakes his hands under her shirt and
up the plane of her spine, skin warm and pliable as he presses fingers into it,
making ten points of pressure.

She moans into him and it drives him crazy. Jayne breaks from her lips, leaves
her gasping as he seals his mouth over her neck. Her head rolls back and he
licks the stretched tendons, sucks at them, pulls more sounds from her throat.

Her hands are slow as they inch down from his neck to his chest, fingers
splaying over his muscles and he wants her to dig into them, wants her to latch
on hard. Kaylee jerks her head away and now he's the one left gasping as she
twists and begins to kiss along his jaw line. Her hands are slow, but her mouth
is fast and eager and demanding.

The wall isn't far away and Jayne easily propels her against it, pressing into
her more, attacking her mouth again. She's so soft she makes him hard. His
hands want more and he lets them slide down around her waist, up over the
ridges of her rib cage. Her breath hitches and she swallows to stop herself
bursting out in laughter.

&quot;You're tickling.&quot; She whispers into his mouth. &quot;Stop it.&quot;

&quot;You're ticklish?&quot; He teases, making his touch deliberately light. &quot;Really? I
never knew.&quot;

&quot;Yes you did!&quot; Kaylee squirms, face red. &quot;Now stop it.&quot;

He shrugs.

&quot;Okay.&quot;

Then he's back at her throat and she's back to moaning. There's not much
thought left in his brain as his hands cup her breasts under her shirt, thumbs
sliding over her nipples, but there is one.

It's been a while for him and he knows it's been a lot longer for her. He don't
want this to be some quick thrust in the cargo bay that makes them both awkward
and stilted after. She deserves better than that.

&quot;That's enough, now.&quot; He pulls his head back and the look she throws him is
comical, all frustration and need and disbelief. &quot;We gotta pack all these
crates away.&quot;

Jayne doesn't want to stop, but he needs to, 'cause any more and he wouldn't be
able to think straight. So he listens to her mutter under her breath as they
lift and heave and find an easy rhythm of movement.

He thinks he hears the word 'tease' a lot.

***

Sometimes tinkering with engines helps when she's like this, edgy and restless,
needing to move in the silence when others are sleeping, her body clock
flailing without a planetary orbit to steady her. To ground her. She's still
not completely used to space travel, doesn't think she ever will be, really.

And then there are times when it's no help at all, when she walks laps of the
ship, unable to stay in one spot long enough to pick up a tool, let alone use
it. Wanting nothing more than to feel earth under her feet, to know that
opening a window won't kill her and everyone she cares about, to know that she
can break into a run and keep running without ever having to stop or turn
around until she wants to.

It's these nights she hates, because that restlessness brings its own craving,
a deep yearning for human contact. Not just sex, but the intimacy of touch, of
having someone wrap their arms around her and hold her tight, to have someone
know her that well and to know them back. It's a hunger that eats at her, gnaws
at her when she sees Wash and Zoe together, burns holes into her when Inara
brushes her hair and she realizes with a jolt that two days have passed without
anyone else deliberately touching her skin.

Kaylee is often devastated that nine people living in such close proximity can
be so isolated.

She thinks about Jayne, his easy touches and heated hands, how he clings to her
like he doesn't want to let her go, how he makes her all hot and fluid. It
makes her think about Simon, about his desperate clutch on the rules and
traditions of a society that betrayed him, remembers how she had to get him
drunk before he'd let her move into his personal space and how she'd spent days
apologizing for it.

The bunk is dark and no one sees her as she climbs down.

&quot;Hold it.&quot; His voice growls, full of suspicion.

&quot;You ain't gonna shoot me, Jayne, so put the gun away.&quot;

Rustling in the dark. She knows he's scrambling to cover himself.

&quot;Kaylee?&quot; He's more relaxed, but twice as confused. &quot;Somethin' wrong?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; She points out and lets her coveralls fall to the floor, stepping out of
them as well as her sandals. His eyes glitter in the dark as he eyes her shirt.
&quot;I'm lonely and you're not gonna ask questions.&quot;

He's warm when she pushes him back down to the mattress, scrambles under the
covers and pulls his arms around her. Her head rests on his arm as it cradles
her, his hand coming around to her shoulder. His other arm drapes around her
waist. She can feel it spread all the way over her, his breath on the nape of
her neck, his chest at her back, his knees coming up under hers, mirroring her.
His awkwardness drains away and he relaxes into it, confusion to acceptance.

Kaylee feels the small hairs on the back of her neck ruffle as he smiles. It's
too close not to be a kiss, but his lips don't make contact.

She's asleep in minutes.

***

He's tired, but Jayne lays awake as long as he can. At first it was like he
couldn't breathe, he'd wanted to jump straight up and out, frightened to break
something between them, but the longer he lies there with Kaylee asleep in his
arms, the more he wants to stay.

Her hand covers his, holds it to her chest and he can feel the steady beat of
her heart under her breastbone. The back of her neck smells clean, like the
shampoo that they all use, and wisps of her hair tickle his nose if he breathes
out through it. Her breath is heavier when she breathes out, not quite loud
enough to be called snoring, but it's getting close.

She told him not to ask questions, but he doesn't have any. He understands.
He's been on ships, off and on, since he was old enough to know the business
end of a shotgun.

He's not an idiot, he knows what they think when they look at him. A hired
thug. Muscle with a gun. Someone who'll sell out a girl and her brother for
whatever coin and safety it will bring. Most of the times, that's what he is.
Sometimes he wants to be more. Kaylee looks for more, brings it out of him when
he needs it.

So if she needs this from him, she'll get it.

***

Kaylee's glowing when she climbs out of his bunk early the next morning, she
can't help smiling. Jayne lies, still sleeping, and his body moves into the
warmth she just left behind and that makes her smile, too.

At this hour she doesn't expect anyone else to be awake. It's one of the perks
of growing up on an outer planet with two suns: twenty two hours of sunlight
and six of darkness. Kaylee needs less sleep for more hours of lucidity and
often finds herself getting most of her work done in private, alone with
Serenity.

But she's not alone. Zoe stands by the bridge, eyes moving from Kaylee to
Jayne's door and back to Kaylee. There's a moment of quiet that stretches out
as they don't move. Then Zoe smiles.

&quot;Good morning.&quot;

&quot;Hey.&quot; Kaylee answers, completely unsuccessful in her attempt to stop feeling,
and therefore looking, so gorram happy with herself.

&quot;Okay, then.&quot;

Zoe nods and Kaylee leaves her standing there. It's not like she wants to hide
anything, she don't really care what they all think about this new development,
whatever it is. She just don't want to flaunt it without talking to Simon.
After that however, she grins to herself, Jayne is all kinds of fair game.

Kaylee skips a little on the way to the engine room.

***

Jayne's getting a weird feeling over the lunch table and it's not the woman
sitting next to him, the woman who presses her leg into his, reaches across
from him for food so that her breast pushes into his arm, keeps giving him
small little smiles that no one else can see. No, he figures it's the woman
sitting across from him, the puzzled way her dark eyes watch his every move.

&quot;Got docking orders.&quot; Wash joins them. &quot;We touch down tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; Jayne rips the edge of a bread roll with his teeth. &quot;Cargo's burning a
hole. We need to get paid.&quot;

&quot;That so?&quot; Zoe's eyes twinkle as she looks at him over her mug of tea. &quot;I would
have thought you got enough action yesterday.&quot;

Jayne snaps his head up and feels Kaylee tense next to him.

&quot;What, with the fight and everything.&quot; Zoe finishes.

River's laugh tinkles over the room as Jayne begins to breath again. Mal's got
his brows furrowed real hard as he looks back and forth. Kaylee puts on that
damned innocent face as she raises her chopsticks to her mouth.

***

Kaylee can't say no when Inara comes to tempt her, there's not much to do with
the engines right now and she can think of nothing better than to let Inara
wash her hair, to sink into the world of luxury that is Inara's shuttle, to be
pampered, to have the warm familiar voice lull her into a stupor.

River appears out of nowhere, curious and bright eyed. She's never been less
subtle as she tries to wheedle an invite, fingers coiling in her own hair as
her eyes linger on Inara's hands pouring the warm water over Kaylee's hair into
the basin, wringing it dry, caressing her neck with a towel.

&quot;Sit.&quot;

Kaylee pats the floor in front of her, grabbing the brush. River springs
instantly, not waiting to be asked twice. She sits Indian style, legs crossed
and back straight. Kaylee lifts the brush and begins dragging it through stray,
fly away tangles.

&quot;Want me to put it up when I'm finished?&quot; Inara's suggestion has a smile to it
and River mewls her agreement, almost purring into Kaylee's repeated strokes.
&quot;Show Simon what he's missing?&quot;

Kaylee feels the heat of blood infusing her face and her hands catch on River's
hair as the girl shakes her head.

&quot;Musical chairs. Simon forgot to listen.&quot;

&quot;Did he?&quot; Inara bends down and cups Kaylee's chin, turning her face slightly.
&quot;So why are we blushing?&quot;

River's hair is shining, long and silk, it falls in wisps down her back. Kaylee
watches as River leans her head back, stretching her neck so she can look up at
the two of them.

&quot;Secret kisses.&quot; She smiles, happy, eyes sparkling. &quot;Trembles and fun.&quot;

Kaylee feels her hair fall to her shoulders, forgotten, and has to smile as
Inara comes around, settling herself excitedly in front of them, eyes glowing.
It's a rare state for Inara and Kaylee enjoys it, sometimes she's surprised to
be reminded just how young the companion really is.

&quot;Really?&quot; Kaylee is the focus of Inara's glee and she can't help but grin as
Inara claps her hands. &quot;Who is it?&quot;

River clucks her tongue.

&quot;Secret.&quot; She insists gravely. &quot;Don't tell.&quot;

It doesn't take a mind reading genius, Kaylee thinks, to figure out the next
question as Inara frowns before she can stop herself. A small crinkle between
her brows as her eyes flicker between her and River.

&quot;It's not...?&quot;

River practically rolls on the floor, she's laughing that hard. Kaylee can't
stop the smile, either, but the blush is getting deeper.

&quot;No!&quot;

Inara obviously doesn't like being out of the loop, but she's still enjoying
herself, even if she's getting impatient. Between them, River picks herself up
and sits daintily upright, hands primly placed in her lap. She looks straight
at Inara and speaks seriously.

&quot;Girls aren't equipped properly for me.&quot;

It takes about five seconds of struggling before they give into the laughter.
Kaylee wants to freeze everything, stop this moment right now and have everyone
be happy. It's the breathless kind of laughing that bubbles up and flows over,
erupting again seconds after it seems to die down.

A knock sounds and they try to hush each other.

&quot;Come in.&quot; Inara calls.

It's physical, Kaylee can see it, the change that Inara goes through, face
smoothing out into a mask of calm, limbs straight and controlled, she fusses
over a non existent wrinkle in her gown. No sign of the giggling heap of
moments ago. It kills Kaylee's good mood.

&quot;I'm sorry.&quot; Simon's voice floats into the shuttle a second before he does.
&quot;Have you seen... River!&quot;

&quot;I'm found.&quot; River sighs, breath still heavy from laughing. &quot;Hair is done.&quot;

&quot;It's okay.&quot; Simon stammers and Kaylee is willing to bet he's blushing redder
than she just was, now that he's deep into girl world. &quot;You stay. I don't want
to interrupt.&quot;

&quot;Simon?&quot; Kaylee stands, it's now or never. &quot;Can we talk?&quot;

His hand rests on her arm as they walk out and she wishes it didn't, wishes he
didn't look so concerned for her. Behind them, Kaylee can hear the girlish
chatter begin again.

&quot;You know.&quot; Inara's voice accuses. &quot;Tell me!&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Comes River's giggle. &quot;Not yet.&quot;

***

They check the weapons carefully, making sure everything is ready for the next
day's early start.

&quot;Jayne?&quot; Zoe cocks the gun in her hand. &quot;You hurt her and I'll kill you dead.&quot;

He nods his agreement.

&quot;Sounds fair enough.&quot;

***

&quot;Simon,&quot; She begins, not really knowing how. &quot;Um...&quot;

&quot;Kaylee.&quot; His voice is soft as he leans against the bench. &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; She interrupts, too nervous to let him go on for fear that she'll never
be able to start again. &quot;Let me speak. I like you, I really do...&quot;

&quot;Kaylee...&quot;

He starts again, a faint tone of amusement in his voice, but she ain't
listening, can't seem to get past her own glaring admission. Her hands twist
into themselves and her mouth is dry as she leans against the cot.

&quot;You're real nice and all, Simon... and I did want... really want... but now...&quot;

&quot;Kaylee!&quot; He reaches forward and grabs her hand. She finally stops babbling.
&quot;It's okay. I know.&quot;

She gasps.

&quot;You know?&quot; He's altogether too embarrassed for this conversation, she notes,
and Kaylee narrows her eyes. &quot;What do you know?&quot;

&quot;That you, you know.&quot; He's stammering again and she has the strangest urge to
slap it out of him. He gestures back through the infirmary to the way they
came. &quot;... and Inara...&quot;

&quot;Inara? No, it ain't Inara.&quot; Her laugh of relief dies quickly and she flashes a
glare at him, at his disbelieving face. &quot;Why does everyone keep pairing me off
with women?&quot;

&quot;It's not Inara?&quot; He asks astutely, carefully sidestepping her question. &quot;So it
is someone, then?&quot;

Kaylee blinks with wide eyes.

He's lifting weights when Mal finds him.

&quot;A word? Jayne?&quot;

Jayne's pretty sure he knows what this is about. Hell, the whole gorram ship is
rife with nothing else and that probably won't change until they land tomorrow.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; He sits up and faces Mal. &quot;This is about a girl, ain't it?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Mal hesitates. &quot;Things have changed between you two, haven't they?&quot;

&quot;Notice, did ya?&quot; Who hasn't? Jayne thinks.

&quot;Hard not to.&quot; Mal's face is all serious. &quot;Secret looks over lunch, playing
games with guns in the cargo bay when you think no one is looking.&quot;

Jayne can't help the smile that breaks over his face when he remembers.

&quot;Thing is, Jayne,&quot; Mal's all manner of uncomfortable and Jayne thinks that he
probably wants to be anywhere other than here right now, having this
conversation. &quot;It's complicated, messin' around with another man's woman.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Jayne's honestly offended, for Kaylee and for himself. &quot;She don't belong
to no one and I ain't like that, either. You don't need to worry, she's talking
with him, right now. I bet.&quot;

&quot;Wo duh ma, Jayne.&quot; Mal sounds tired and angry all at once. &quot;You even thought
about this? Serenity's not that big, people are gonna get hurt and when that
happens they're gonna wanna leave. I can't spare people right now, Jayne.
Breaking up a marriage...&quot;

&quot;Marriage? What?&quot; Jayne clicks and begins to chuckle. &quot;You think I'm chasing
Zoe? Nah, Mal, it ain't Zoe.&quot;

&quot;It's not?&quot; Mal breathes a heavy sigh of relief, then looks at Jayne, puzzled.
&quot;Then who the hell were you talking about?&quot;

Jayne shrugs and lies back down to his weights.

Kaylee catches him unawares, pulls him into the engine room when no one is
around. They hide against the wall by the door, free from everyone else.

&quot;We live on a ship of nosy, nosy people.&quot; She tells him, laughing.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; He agrees, feeling the lines of her face under his fingers. &quot;I'm
sleeping with Zoe.&quot;

&quot;I'm sleeping with Inara and River.&quot; She feels the laugh that springs out of
his chest. &quot;At least you got paired with a woman.&quot;

&quot;So did you.&quot; He grins. &quot;Two of 'em.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, relax.&quot; She pushes his chest, playful. &quot;It ain't true so stop
drooling.&quot;

&quot;True in my head.&quot; He teases, closing his eyes. &quot;And don't ya all make a pretty
picture?&quot;

&quot;Give it time.&quot; She teases back. &quot;You'll be paired off with Mal or Book soon
enough.&quot;

&quot;Say again?&quot; His eyes spring open and he puffs his chest up against her. &quot;I
ain't sly none.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; She challenges. &quot;It's okay for me, but not for you?&quot;

&quot;'Sides.&quot; He continues. &quot;Inara'd scratch my eyes out I even look twice at Mal.&quot;
