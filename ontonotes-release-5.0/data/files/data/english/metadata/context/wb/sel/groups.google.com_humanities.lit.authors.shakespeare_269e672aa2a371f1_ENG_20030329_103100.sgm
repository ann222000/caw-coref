There are many &quot;coincidences&quot; between Shakspere &amp; de Vere:

1) they both took over the lease *BLACKFRIARS* Theatre
from Henry Evans (25 years apart):
---------------------------------------------------------------
1583 Lessor of *BLACKFRIARS* Theatre: Henry Evans =&gt; Ed de Vere
1608 Lessor of *BLACKFRIARS* Theatre: Henry Evans =&gt; Shakspere
---------------------------------------------------------------
2) and they both had daughters named &quot;Susan&quot; born on May 26:
--------------------------------------------------------------
SUSANna Shak. born on St. AUGUSTINE's day May 26, 1583
SUSAN Vere born on St. AUGUSTINE's day May 26, 1587
-------------------------------------------------------
3) they both had wives named Anne born in 1556:
-------------------------------------------------------
GRAY's Inn Hall was built in 1556.

&lt;&lt; The Comedy of Errors played in GRAY's Inn Hall in 1594
in the intervals of 'dancing &amp; revelry with gentlewomen'. &gt;&gt;

THE GRIFFIN of GRAY's Inn

The arms of the Society are - Sable a Griffin sergeant
or, that is a golden griffin standing on a black field.
It is thought to be borrowed from Richard Aungier,
thrice Treasurer of the Inn, at the turn of the 16th
century, and it is a more spectacular heraldic device
than the plain bars of the de GREY arms which were
previously used - they may be seen above the main
entrance to the Treasury Office in South Square.
A GRIFFIN is the offspring of a lion and eagle with the
body of the former and the head &amp; shoulders of the latter,
but 'also with animal ears. It is sacred to the SUN,
being seen, e.g., on the Temple of Apollo at Miletus
and was used by the ancients to guard TREASURE.

Knight of the Tree of the SUNNE
------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;In Alan Young's Tudor and Jacobean Tournaments...recounts Oxford's
participation in one of his last tournaments (prior to his imprisonment
in the Tower), at Whitehall, on 22 January 1581. The circumstance of
this contest was the Earl of Arundel's &quot;friendly&quot; challenge to knightly
gallants as one Callophisus, a Lover of Beauty, to which challenge
responded, among others, Lord Windsor, Sir Philip Sidney, Sir William
Drury, and Lord Oxford. Young tells us that all of the respondents
to Arundel's challenge at Whitehall styled themselves, rather
unpretentiously (save one!), by such unimaginative nomenclature as the
Red Knight, the White Knight, and the Blue Knight-- but, according to
Young, &quot;the Earl of Oxford appeared in the Whitehall tiltyard as the
Knight of the Tree of the SUNNE . . . and it appears that he concealed
himself in his pavilion [a 'statlie Tent of Orenge tawny Taffata,
curiously imbroydered with Siluer, &amp; pendents on the Pinacles']
before any of the other participants arrived.&quot;

&quot;From forth this Tent came the noble Earle of Oxenford in rich gilt
Armour, and sate down vnder a great high Bay-tree, the whole stocke,
branches and leaues whereof, were all gilded ouer, that nothing but
Gold could be discerned. [ . . . ] After a solemne sound of most
sweet Musique, he mounted on his Courser, verie richly caparasoned,
whe[n] his page ascending the staires where her Highnesse stood
in the window, deliuered to her by speech [his] Oration ....

Oxford told Her Majesty &amp; the august assembly before the Queen that
he, a wandering knight, had met &quot;an aged 'Pilgrime or Hermit' who
showed him 'a Tree so beautiful, that his eyes were daseled.&quot;'

As the speech unfolds, it becomes clear that this &quot;Tree of the SUNNE&quot;
represents Elizabeth. It is unique like the Phoenix, and it eclipses all
other trees. In an allusion to Elizabeth's virginity, we are told that
&quot;Vestas bird sitteth in the midst, whereat Cupid is euer drawing, but
dares not shoot, being amazed at that princely and perfect Maiestie.&quot;
In the shade of the tree, the knight has found &quot;such content, as
nothing coulde bee more comfortable,&quot; and has &quot;made a sollemne vowe,
to incorporate hys harte into that Tree, and ingraft hys thoughts vppon
those vertues. Swearing, that as there is but one SUNNE to shine ouer
it, one roote to glue life vnto it, one toppe to maintaine Maiestie: so
there should be but one Knight , eyther to lyue or die for the defence
thereof. Where-vppon, tree swore himselfe onely to be the Knight of
the Tree of the SUNNE , whose life should end before his loyaltie.&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;In John Quincy Adams's *A Life of William Shakespeare*, there is
an extract of a letter from Sir Henry WOTTON to Sir Edmund Bacon

the two Earls brothers: the first a small, exceeding white pearl,

In Oxford's letters, he mentions tin more than fifty
times. In the entire works of Shakespeare, tin is
mentioned just that once.

Though Oxford's fascination with tin spanned the
late 1590s, Shakespeare did not mention tin until
after Oxford's death.

All the more reason to believe the works are autobiographical, Art.

Perhaps a wink by Moby Shakespeare. ;-)
---------------------------------------------------
I would love to claim that the word TIN was first spoken in a Shakespeare
play in the very year of the author's death but, unfortunately, there is no
evidence to that effect:
---------------------------------------------------
1) &lt;&lt;In 1842 P. Cunningham announced the discovery - in the Audit Office,
Somerset House - of certain books of accounts kept by the Master of the
Revels, showing the expenses incurred in the production of plays before
royalty. In one of these _Revels' Books_ appears the entry:

'1605. By the King's Maties Plaiers
Hallamas Day being the first of November
A: play in the Banketinge house at Whitehall
called _The Moor of Venis_
by Shaxberd'

(The context shows that '1605' is a clerical error for '1604.')

Some years later the leaves of the _Revels' Books_ containing references to
Sh.'s plays were declared by experts to be forgeries.&gt;&gt; -Who's Who in
Shakespeare.

2) Neither the 1622 Quarto nor the 1623 Folio mention &quot;TIN&quot; in
Iago's monologue where he suspects Othello of making him cuckold:

Knaueries plaine face is neuer seene, TILL vs'd. - [(Quarto) 2.1]

_Don Quixote_ CHAPTER XII
OF THE STRANGE ADVENTURE WHICH BEFELL THE VALIANT
DON QUIXOTE WITH THE BOLD KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS

&quot;The sceptres and crowns of those play-actor emperors,&quot; said Sancho,
were never yet pure gold, but only BRASS foil or TIN.&quot;

&quot;That is TRUE,&quot; said Don Quixote, &quot;for it would not be right that
the accessories of the drama should be real, instead of being mere
fictions and semblances, like the drama itself; towards which, Sancho-
and, as a necessary consequence, towards those who represent and
produce it- I would that thou wert favourably disposed, for they are
all instruments of great good to the State, placing before us at every
step a mirror in which we may see vividly displayed what goes on in
human life; nor is there any similitude that shows us more
faithfully what we are and ought to be than the play and the
players. Come, tell me, hast thou not seen a play acted in which
kings, emperors, pontiffs, knights, ladies, and divers other
personages were introduced? One plays the villain, another the
knave, this one the merchant, that the soldier, one the sharp-witted
fool, another the foolish lover; and when the play is over, and they
have put off the dresses they wore in it, all the actors become
equal.&quot;
&quot;Yes, I have seen that,&quot; said Sancho.
&quot;Well then,&quot; said Don Quixote, &quot;the same thing happens in the comedy
and life of this world, where some play emperors, others popes, and,
in short, all the characters that can be brought into a play; but when
it is over, that is to say when life ends, death strips them all of
the garments that distinguish one from the other,
and all are equal in the grave.&quot;

As we know, Elizabethans freely used &quot;n&quot; where we use &quot;ll&quot; and
that's how I found the word &quot;fun&quot; when it truly meant &quot;full&quot;
and this use of &quot;tin&quot; is really &quot;till.&quot; That's how Hamnet can be seen
as being Hamlet or Hamlett. Tin and fun are NOT in the canon.

Oxford had little 'fascination' with tin. He merely wanted
a regular income from a Royal monopoly. IMO it is quite
likely that his wife wrote those letters for him -- in a vain
attempt to get him to sort out his finances.

In which play (or in which poem) do you sense the
absence of appropriate references to tin? Would
some fit into Macbeth? Or into Lear? Or into The
Tempest?

That would make better sense to legitimize your

So why did he sit on it for twenty years? Please don't
answer in that flighty manner of building upon even

Wife, dog, whoever. Authorship is not your forte, Paul.
How does incessantly begging for privileges he never

The tyne letters were written between 1595 and 1599.
Elizabeth Trentham was married to the earl since 1593,
the year their son Henry (Helry) was born.

Tin was on Oxford's mind but not on Shakespeare's.
I was granting the one mention but we all know it

NOW I see why you want to divorce de Vere from
the tyne letters--they are atrocious examples of usury,
greed, desperation. Phraseology foreign to Shakespeare.

So you invent that his wife did it. Makes perfect sense.

The Stratfordian 'dating' of the plays is a nonsense. There
are very few records for most plays before the First Folio
(e.g. ten plays have only one record). Yet, because the
time available is so short, Strats usually have to say, in
respect of each play, that it was written immediately before
its first record. They ignore earlier records (inventing Ur-
Hamlets, Ur-Lears, Ur-Shrews, etc.). They ascribe near-
omniscience to Meres, who lists twelve (eight for the first
time AFAIR); they all have to be squeezed in before 1598.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Many were started (in early versions) in the 1570s and

"/>

Hey, take care, you're getting dangerously close to
the truth. The FINAL version of Hamlet was
published in 1605.

But to answer your general point, they tried to give
the 'playwrighting career' of 'William Shake-speare'
a rough kind of sense. It was _roughly_ planned.
The weakest material (and that which was, by that
time, inappropriate for revision) was published first.
The 'career' started with the juvenile long poems.
(*Lucrece* is so weak, that its publication at that
date was a joke -- as was the nonsense of its being
a 'second major work'.)

Of course, the whole 'career' is so condensed that,
in reality, it makes no sense (putting Hamlet within
ten years of Titus, for example). But then the
authorities knew they were addressing dopes who
would believe almost anything. Although they
would never have conceived that four hundred
years later there would be people who would take
that 'scheme' seriously -- especially when they have
the whole canon set out before them.

&gt; Paul Crowley wrote:

&gt;&gt; He wrote the play for a court and aristocratic audience.

&gt; Evidence? None.

"/>

The primary evidence consists of:
(a) The nature of the play. (b) The nature of the actually
recorded performances.

Broadly there were three classes in Elizabethan England:
(1) aristocrats, (2) middle-class, and (3) the rest. The middle-
classes were largely puritanical, and disliked the theatre,
leaving it to the two other classes. So we have two kinds
of theatrical productions for the two very different types
of audience.

This is (in effect) the opening speech of the play. Do
you think that it was aimed at illiterate groundlings?

&quot;Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:
But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
And, in conclusion,
Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
'I have already chose my officer.'
And what was he?
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
That never set a squadron in the field,
Nor the division of a battle knows
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
Wherein the toged consuls can propose
As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.&quot;

Here is another famous exchange. Do you think that
it rang bells with illiterate groundlings in their common
discussions on the importance of 'reputation'?

IAGO What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
CASSIO Ay, past all surgery.
IAGO Marry, heaven forbid!
CASSIO Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost
my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,
Iago, my reputation!
IAGO As I am an honest man, I thought you had received
some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than
in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false
imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without
deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,
unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!
there are ways to recover the general again: you
are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in
policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his
offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue
to him again, and he's yours.

HA! If Hamlet is Oxford and Polonius is Burghley--that proves
Burghley wrote the work autobiographically! Why not?
They are just the characters and you could not arbitrarily make
either one of them the author. Your logic is dangerous.

You could not differentiate between biographical and
autobiographical. But it does make perfect sense
that Oxford, in being a stunning imbecile and a public
laughingstock, would find his way into the contemporary
literature. Many other people did--perhaps [note how I
couch my conjecture rather than jam them Crowley-style]
even Shakespeare's neighbor Sir Lucey. If Oxford is a
model for any character, there is no indication that it is
as first person--it is far more likely to be third person
BECAUSE it is only a tiny portion of the works. He
isn't 500 characters--so you're stretching it. And I don't
see any more linkage between Oxford's life than anyone else's
somewhere in the works. A writer gets the panorama of it all,
whereas the courtiers, the masons, the countrymen, the soldiers
are all smack dab in it. Hamlet cannot understand himself, so how
could he be the one revealing himself? It has to be third person.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;He wrote the play for a court and aristocratic audience.

&gt;&gt;Evidence? None.

&gt; The primary evidence consists of:
&gt; (a) The nature of the play. (b) The nature of the actually
&gt; recorded performances.

&gt; Broadly there were three classes in Elizabethan England:
&gt; (1) aristocrats, (2) middle-class, and (3) the rest. The middle-
&gt; classes were largely puritanical, and disliked the theatre,
&gt; leaving it to the two other classes. So we have two kinds
&gt; of theatrical productions for the two very different types
&gt; of audience.

&gt; This is (in effect) the opening speech of the play. Do
&gt; you think that it was aimed at illiterate groundlings?

&gt;&quot;Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
&gt; In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
&gt; Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,
&gt; I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:
&gt; But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,
&gt; Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
&gt; Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
&gt; And, in conclusion,
&gt; Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
&gt; 'I have already chose my officer.'
&gt; And what was he?
&gt; Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
&gt; One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
&gt; A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
&gt; That never set a squadron in the field,
&gt; Nor the division of a battle knows
&gt; More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
&gt; Wherein the toged consuls can propose
&gt; As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,
&gt; Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:
&gt; And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
&gt; At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
&gt; Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd
&gt; By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,
&gt; He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
&gt; And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.&quot;

&gt; Here is another famous exchange. Do you think that
&gt; it rang bells with illiterate groundlings in their common
&gt; discussions on the importance of 'reputation'?

&gt; IAGO What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
&gt; CASSIO Ay, past all surgery.
&gt; IAGO Marry, heaven forbid!
&gt; CASSIO Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost
&gt; my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
&gt; myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,
&gt; Iago, my reputation!
&gt; IAGO As I am an honest man, I thought you had received
&gt; some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than
&gt; in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false
&gt; imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without
&gt; deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,
&gt; unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!
&gt; there are ways to recover the general again: you
&gt; are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in
&gt; policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his
&gt; offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue
&gt; to him again, and he's yours.

&gt;&gt;Evidence against? Plenty.

&gt; Except that -- strangely -- you can't remember any.

&gt;&gt;Intrinsic probability? Poor.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The profits from the _known_ public performances
&gt;&gt;&gt;of Shake-speare's plays for the thirty years between
&gt;&gt;&gt;1593 and 1623 would not pay an aristocrat's food
&gt;&gt;&gt;bill for one day.

&gt;&gt;You are a filthy, disgusting liar!

&gt; If I was, you would be able to show it with a few
&gt; figures. Strangely, you forget to present them.

Oh God! Here we are back in November of 1999 again.

As I said then:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you cannot see that, for example, &quot;Is there no way for men to be but
women / must be half workers,&quot;&amp;c., with its loose flow of rhythm and
sudden turns in thought, is the work of an older and more assured poet;
if you cannot perceive Shakespeare's gleeful and masterly winding of
twist upon twist in the plot, all to be let off by the magnificent
clockwork rocket of the final scene; if you cannot understand that
&quot;Cymbeline&quot;, like &quot;The Winter's Tale&quot; and the other romances, is the
work of a man who has been through &quot;Lear&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot; and come out
safe on the other side (or, to put it in a simultaneously more primitive
and contemporary tone, that &quot;Cymbeline&quot; is Shakespeare's way of saying,
&quot;Lear? Been there; done that.&quot;), then I suspect your taste in tragedy
remains as adolescent as your scholarship.
vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

and later:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Great God! man, can you really see no difference between:

In Syracusa was I born and wed
Unto a woman, happy but for me,
And by me, had not our hap been bad.
With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
By prosperous voyages I often made
To Epidamnum; till my factor's death
And the great care of goods at random left
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
From whom my absence was not six months old
Before herself, almost at fainting under
The pleasing punishment that women bear,
Had made provision for her following me
And soon and safe arrived where I was.
There had she not been long but she became
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
And, which was strange, the one so like the other
As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
That very hour and in the self-same inn
A meaner woman was delivered
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,
I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
Made daily motions for our home return:
Unwilling I agreed; alas! too soon
We came aboard.
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
Before the always wind-obeying deep
Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
But longer did we not retain much hope;
For what obscured light the heavens did grant
Did but convey unto our fearful minds
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
Weeping before for what she saw must come,
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
And this it was, for other means was none:
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
To him one of the other twins was bound,
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:
The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
And, by the benefit of his wished light,
The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
Two ships from far making amain to us,
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
But ere they came -- O, let me say no more!
Gather the sequel by that went before.

and:

1 He that hath miss'd the Princess is a thing
Too bad for bad report. And he that hath her --
I mean, that married her, alack, good man!
And therefore banish'd -- is a creature such
As, to seek through the regions of the earth
For one his like, there would be something failing
In him that should compare. I do not think
So fair an outward and such stuff within
Endows a man but he.
2 You speak him far.
1 I do extend him, sir, within himself,
Crush him together rather than unfold
His measure duly.
2 What's his name and birth?
1 I cannot delve him to the root. His father
Was called Sicilius, who did join his honour
Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
But had his titles by Tenantuis whom
He served with glory and admired success,
So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
And had, besides this gentleman in question,
Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time
Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,
Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
That he quit being, and his gentle lady,
Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased
As he was born. The King he takes the babe
To his protection, calls him Postumus Leonatus,
Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
Puts to him all the learnings that his time
Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,
And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court --
Which rare it is to do -- most praised, most loved,
A sample to the youngest, to the more mature
A glass that feated them, and to the graver
A child that guided dotards; to his mistress
For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;
By her election may be truly read
What kind of man he is.
2 I honour him
Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,
Is she sole child to the King?
1 His only child.
He had two sons. If this be worth our hearing,
Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,
I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery
Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge
Which way they went.
2 How long is this ago?
1 Some twenty years.
2 That a king's children should be so convey'd
So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,
That could not trace them!
1 However is, 'tis strange,
Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,
Yet it is true, sir.
2 I do well believe you.

The one so almost entirely end-stopped that it all but seems to have
been written with training wheels, the other mostly enjambed; the one
with two feminine endings in 60 lines, the other with 16 feminine out of
59 (if I did not lose count); and you can detect no difference? -- no,
even more, you think the latter the earlier and &quot;cruder&quot;? Have you no
ear at all?

Point to earlier lines as daring as &quot;Do't, and to bed then.&quot;, &quot;My dear
lord! / Thou art one o' the false ones.&quot;, or &quot;Why did you throw your
wedded lady from you? / Think that you are upon a rock; and now / Throw
me again.&quot;

Even without an 'ear' it is possible to count. Look at my
graph of this at
(You may ignore the Marlovian propaganda at the beginning!)

The use of enjambments and feminine endings clearly
increases dramatically over time. Adding the two figures
together for each play, and expressing this as a percent-
of the number of lines of verse, we find only five plays
which exceed 69%. They are Coriolanus, The Winter's Tale,
Cymbeline, The Tempest and Henry VIII.

&gt; You know, it's rather amusin', in a Gilbertian sort of way, to see

&gt; What I find especially funny is his notion that the urban poor have no

"/>

What is amusing is the near-complete incomprehension
of the English working-class (and also of everything in
Shake-speare) by modern Yanks -- and by Stratfordians
generally. The word in the famous passage of Othello is
&quot;reputation&quot;. Even today a working-class Englishman
(say, a cockney) would find talk of his 'reputation' peculiar.
&quot;Wotcher on abaht, Gov?&quot;. Only toffs have 'reputations'
or worry about losing them. In law, they are (or were till
recently) the only ones who can (could) sue about such
a matter.

The word is of French origin. French concepts in the
language relate to upper classes, and have done so
since the Conquest. That goes so deep that it is rarely
discussed. Those who live with it do not need to.
However, it forms part of every English institution, such
as the law.

Quote a case from English literature -- or from history --
where a working class man has expressed concern about
his reputation -- or where others have suggested that he
might have such a concern.

The same, broadly, applies to nearly all other concepts
brought into the canon. They are of interest only to
(and discussed only by) upper-classes and of little or
no concern to those from the lower classes.

How is it that I have to explain elementary facts of
English society and English literature?

Oh, I remember -- I'm talking to Strats.

First, what is the point of bringing in the King of Hungary in this scene?
According to the Riverside:
&quot;The Duke referred to in connection with the King of Hungary's peace

Anne's brother, who was in England in 1604 to raise men in the

This 'theory' is based on the assumption that the
poet could not tell the difference between a
masculine and a feminine ending -- and that his
verse was the product of some unconscious,
automatic process. Therefore (the 'theory' goes)
he could not possibly vary his style as he chose
(in this, or in any other, respect).

There _may_ be a broad trend. But it did not
come from a machine, and there is no reason why
the author would not have varied his style -- often
quite drastically -- on numerous occasions, and
for various purposes throughout his career.

Stratfordians must necessarily think of the poet
as a kind of mindless automaton. (And that
conception reflects on their view of all literature.)
Why is that also required for Marlites? Or are
you just blindly following the Stratfordian lead?

Cymbeline is, I think, the work of a mature or, at least,
an adult poet. I find it hard to judge his age, because
(like most great poets) this one was extraordinarily
precocious, and was (like most great poets) able to
put into words thoughts and expressions that

Yeah, sure. All great artists are like that. They
produce works of unparalleled beauty and stature
in their maturity, and then sit back, saying 'been
there, done that' and churn out 'potboilers' when
they are tired old men . . . at the age of about 43.
Just like, say, Beethoven, Milton, Chaucer, Swift,
Michaelangelo, Raphael, Titian, . . . . and so on
and on.

(For any lurkers -- Stratfordians maintain that the
Stratman began 'winding down' around 1607 -- when
he was 43. The poor old man was 'retired' by the
age of 48 (in 1612). He'd had an intense 'career',
starting when he was about 29.

Curiously, no one at the time commented on this
strange 'career' -- made even stranger by his
background of illiteracy -- on which no one
commented either.

However, that's alright. It all make sense

-- to Stratfordians.)

This is good, competent verse but -- _from_this_

It would have been well within his capacity in his
early twenties (i.e. before 1575).

Do you know of any other great poet whose ability
in his early twenties was so weak that he was
obliged to produce poor work?

What do you find in Cymbeline that says the poet
MUST be in his late thirties or forties ? Does it
contain some expressions, some thoughts or some
reflection of life-experience, that indicates an
older man?

You are _not_ applying ordinary commonsense
rules here, but some weird 'Stratfordian' ones,
which you would never dream of applying to any
other poet or author.

Is there anything in these passages from
Cymbeline (or from anywhere in the play) which
(allowing for the obvious differences) you would
say could not come from a Keats, a Shelley, a
Byron or any other poet aged about 30?

Has anyone EVER applied such 'rules' to any other
poet? (Silly question.) Has anyone EVER thought
of applying these 'rules' to any other poet?
(Another silly question.) What other poet is
known to have gradually altered his use of
feminine endings during his maturity? What other
poet is known to have gradually and consistently
altered his poetic habits -- in some excessively
crude (if easily measurable) manner -- during his
career?

Why does 'Shakespearean Studies' attract such
dolts? And such doltish thinking?

More silly questions. What else would we expect
from Strats?

Amusing how Crowley, like most Shakespeare-rejecters, is convinced that the

about those things as they believe he did, but Crowley himself need not have any

It is quite clear from the graph that the author *did* vary
his style. Each deviation above or below the trendline
illustrates this (subject to a certain amount of inaccuracy
in the dating, but not *that* much).

The average (mean) value for all of the Shakespeare plays is
40%. Every play differs from this to a greater or lesser
extent. It is possible, however, to calculate that 90% of
this difference is likely to be due to the trend, and only
10% to other factors (such as the deliberate choice of the
poet to deviate from the trend on this occasion).

Going back to
*Cymbeline* is easily found as the highest value of all, and
dated 1610. Now move that value back to where you think
*Cymbeline* should be (1595?) to see how extremely unlikely
such a huge deviation would have been at that time.

Not to me. What makes composition of the play around 1595 unlikely is the real
evidence--no mention of the play by Meres plus first recorded performance having

This is a classic example of how to fool yourself
with numbers. You can calculate the trend for Shake-
speare's usage of his top (most frequently used)
1,000 words (and I have). For each word, &quot;each deviation
above or below the trendline [will] illustrate this (subject
to a certain amount of inaccuracy in the dating, but not
*that* much).&quot;

&gt; The average (mean) value for all of the Shakespeare plays is
&gt; 40%. Every play differs from this to a greater or lesser
&gt; extent. It is possible, however, to calculate that 90% of

&gt; 10% to other factors (such as the deliberate choice of the
&gt; poet to deviate from the trend on this occasion).

Peter, please try to get your feet back on the
ground. We are not talking about some natural
phenomenon. We are talking about a set of the
poet's entirely deliberate artistic decisions to do
one thing rather than another. Can you think of
anything roughly equivalent in your own life?
Maybe when you take the dog for a walk you
sometimes go around the block and sometimes
go to the park? Maybe you sometimes go to the
'Dog &amp; Duck' for a drink rather than to the 'Fox &amp;
Goose'? Could someone plot these decisions on
a graph, and tell you of a consistent 'trend' over
your adult life? (That is, for example, that your
percentage attendance at the 'Dog &amp; Duck'
increased steadily and consistently over the
years -- and, given knowledge of a percentage
attendance, we could say how old you were at
the time.)

OK, you may find those examples too trivial, so
can you suggest another set of decisions --
concerning yourself or any other person?
(Ideally it should be some _deliberate_ literary
behaviour of an author -- but any other
deliberate behaviour will do for a start.)

I bet you can't, because deliberate decisions
made by individual human beings (on issues
of some significance to them) do not follow
graphs -- they are determined by the person's
needs and opinions at each stage.

&gt; Just using my brain, Paul.

It's a fundamentally 'Stratfordian' brain. You
have adopted the (incredibly stupid) Strat
way of 'thinking' about Shakespeare, with
their assumption that that he was some kind
of automaton -- with a magic pen.

Paul understands that the Oxfordianism and the orthodox
chronology are not compatible. He is certain that he's
right about Oxfordianism. Therefore, you are wrong.
QED. (ie. He needn't waste any of his stupendous brain
power considering statistically how unlikely or likely
his preferred chronology is.)

Perhaps you remember that some time ago I wrote a program
that goes through a bunch of tagged texts, produces a
list of &quot;rare words&quot; based upon a cutoff value, and
counts the number of rare words shared between texts.
I've continued to work on it off and on.

A couple of notes on the current state of the process:

#1. All words starting with a capital letter are still
discarded in the first step.

#2. The counts are now based upon sets of 9574 randomly
selected words taken from each text. (Most of the words
in each set are not rare words.) To compensate for
the statistical fluctuations inherent in the method, the
process is repeated thousands of times, (The reported
values are the averages of the results from all of the
iterations.)

A few weeks ago, I ran Shakespeare's plays(excluding HVIII and
Pericles) through. Here's a table listing the results for
Cymbeline for cutoffs of 6, 12, 18. 24. and 30:

Clearly, rare words most closely connect Cymbeline to the plays
generally believed to have been written very late in Shakespeare's
career, which I think may be reasonably taken(by those not enjoying
Paul's level of certainty) as an independent confirmation of your
findings.

As anyone can see, the table is generally in good agreement with the
overall orthodox chronology. (The exception being JC which appears to
be about equally well connected to early, middle and late plays.)

I've just begun to glance at the rare word connections
between Marlowe's work and Shakespeare's. You may
find the preliminary results to be of interest, so
I give some below. At the moment, I'm looking only
at VA, RL, and that part of HL acknowledged to be Marlowe's.
(Due to the smaller number of words in the poems, the size
of the sets of randomly selected words had to be reduced
from 9574 to 4516. As there are only 3 texts in the study,
I've been setting the cutoffs quite low.)

The resulting connection matrices:

cutoff=2
RL VA HL
RL 0.00 65.85 55.32
VA 65.85 0.00 48.34
HL 55.32 48.34 0.00

Absolutely NOT TRUE, Paul. If you really believed in your argument, you would
not so
outrageously misrepresent your opponents' beliefs. As I've told you before,
scholars
dating the plays have based their conclusions PRIMARILY on (1) dates of first
recorded
performances; (2) dates of first known publication; (3) dates of first recorded
references
to the plays; (4) dates of plays that are clearly of the same type, or--to put
it another way--
dates of play-fashions or literary fashions (e.g., euphuism, comedy of humors,
revenge
plays); (5) dates of probable source material; (6) topical allusions,
particularly ones that
seem unlikely to have been spliced in later; other things I'm not scholar enough
to be able
to think of right now. They base their dating SECONDARILY on such things as (1)
apparent dramaturgical competence; (2) things like number of enjambments; (3)
fluidity
of versification; (4) dimensionality of characters; (5) unstiltedness of
plotting; (6) et
cetera. All these things are SUSPECT because not capable of objective analysis
the way
the other things are.

Paul, if you were an artist or had studied a single artist as
an artist rather than as a propagandist, you would know that NO
artist makes nothing but &quot;entirely deliberate artistic decisions
to do one thing rather than another.&quot; Edgar Allen Poe claimed to,
and probably came as close to doing so as any poet much of the time--but seems
to Poe experts to have been guided by subconscious needs to such a degree
as to have possibly gone as FAR from doing so as any poet, at other times.

I'll leave the rest of this rubbish for Peter to have fun with. I wonder
if it will give him more sympathy for those of us on the other side who
sometimes become impolite when debating with wacks like Paul.

I have three books to hand in which the dating of Cymbeline

mentions verse tests, and then only to say that though

This is true. The point you are struggling to make
eludes me, however.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The average (mean) value for all of the Shakespeare plays is
&gt;&gt; 40%. Every play differs from this to a greater or lesser
&gt;&gt; extent. It is possible, however, to calculate that 90% of
&gt;&gt; this difference is likely to be due to the trend, and only
&gt;&gt; 10% to other factors (such as the deliberate choice of the
&gt;&gt; poet to deviate from the trend on this occasion).

&gt;&gt; Going back to  http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/appx7a.htm
&gt;&gt; *Cymbeline* is easily found as the highest value of all, and
&gt;&gt; dated 1610. Now move that value back to where you think
&gt;&gt; *Cymbeline* should be (1595?) to see how extremely unlikely
&gt;&gt; such a huge deviation would have been at that time.

&gt; Peter, please try to get your feet back on the
&gt; ground. We are not talking about some natural
&gt; phenomenon. We are talking about a set of the
&gt; poet's entirely deliberate artistic decisions to do
&gt; one thing rather than another.

"/>

You may be, I am not. I am discussing behaviour
which may or may not be derived from conscious
decisions. Having said that, I find it difficult
to believe that Shakespeare was any more conscious
that he was using a run-on line or a feminine
ending at the time he was writing than he was
conscious of what part of speech (noun, verb, or
whatever) he had just used. What 'sounded right'
to him would be my guess.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Can you think of

&gt; a graph, and tell you of a consistent 'trend' over
&gt; your adult life? (That is, for example, that your

"/>

The basic flaw in your argument is that you assume
a single decision for the play (how much shall I use
run-on lines and feminine endings this time?) where
the decision in fact was, in the case of Cymbeline,
made (whether consciously or unconsciously) over 5
thousand times, i.e. two decisions per line of verse.
It is at this 'large number' level where statistical
approaches to measuring patterns of behaviour are
appropriate, even if they can tell you nothing about
what particular decisions will be made for any single
line.

&gt; It's a fundamentally 'Stratfordian' brain. You

No, but I do believe that the author was sufficiently

Lor' love e a duck, you seem to draw your notions of working-class

Not in what I assume are your terms. I start with my observations of how my
mind works, add what others have said about how their minds work, and what
behavior and made objects tell me about how human minds work, then work out a
neurophysiology based on what neuroscience says about the brain (as close as I
can get it, considering my incomplete knowledge of neuroscience, but not
contradicting any of it that I know of). The aim is a model of the brain that
accounts for all of human psychology, including (prominently) its variations.
The character types are, in my theory, a consequence of the variability of three
mechanisms of the brain: character, accommodance and accelerance (mental
stability, mental flexibility, mental quickness, to put it roughly).

I test my theory's explanation of various character types subjectively, by
comparing the types the theory says exist to the types I have observed (and
checked against the types others have observed and written about). Of course, I
had a &quot;theory&quot; of character types before I worked up my theory of the mind, and
it no doubt influenced that theory. But my theory of the mind also influenced
my initial theory of character types.

The point is, that I go to hard facts--what my mind does, what others' minds
do, etc.--and try to explain them with my theory. I don't use statistics,
except unconsciously and unscientifically, or second-hand, from real scientists'
studies--but the latter only to boost my morale when the studies confirm my
theory, or to look more closely at my theory when they do not.

Interesting topic and I could go on and on. But I have other things to do at
the moment.

Nonsense. It only makes sense IF the author is

are not influenced by a variety of external factors.

Imagine that a new play of Shakespeare's was

Would you be confident -- without knowing the
nature of the play -- in predicting the number of
run-on lines?

Of course, we should really focus on other
authors (where absurd fantasies are not the order
of the day). Pick an author you respect. Can you
confidently forecast the nature of his/her next work?
Can you even more confidently predict some crude
measure of style?

Of course you can't. Predictions can only be made
for extremely weak authors: &quot; . . . Jeffrey Archer's

sentences without verbs . .&quot; . . &quot;Jilly Cooper's

thread that he has--in order to make you look the
epitome of sanity?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;He DECIDED exactly how often
&gt;he would rhyme or end-stop the lines. It was an
&gt;artistic decision, going to the root of his work.
&gt;In LLL and Comedy of Errors he went for doing
&gt;them often because they suited his intentions for
&gt;those works. In Hamlet and Lear they usually didn't.

Now a question for Paul. Did Shakespeare know
exactly how many r's and h's he used at all
times? This is something I keep track of in
my own creative writing. Also, did he decide in
advance how many verbs beginning with c that he'd
use in a given work like I do?

Anti-continuumism, Paul: the belief that everyone is
either fully aware at all times of what he is doing
or oblivious of what he is doing at all times. But
most people, and all good creative writers, are
only partially aware of what they are doing--as
you would know if you have had any experience
as a creative writer.

&gt;Paul, if you were an artist or had studied a single artist as
&gt;an artist rather than as a propagandist, you would know that NO
&gt;artist makes nothing but &quot;entirely deliberate artistic decisions
&gt;to do one thing rather than another.&quot;

Bob, I'm an artist - says so on my recording contract. Songwriter. Lyrics.
Rhymes. Poems. I have written LOTS of songs that were deliberately meant to be
different from the one preceding it, or deliberately aimed at some particular
period, or mood, etc. I have written songs that sprang from modes popular in my
childhood, or even before, as well as songs expressing current events in
abstract contempo lyrical styles, on the same day. Deliberately. I'm all over
the map, style-wise. I know a good many artists of every stripe who are
deliberate like that, by far the majority. Way far. Too, I often go back to
revise early things, the sort John Kennedy described as having training wheels,
sometimes radically. Some I leave rude. My skills are better honed now, but you
couldn't say when they were applied, if applied, to a particular piece. Unless
I totally misunderstand what you two are slapping each other around about, and
while noting your &quot;nothing but&quot; - a condition I don't remember Paul mentioning
- I'd say the absoluteness in your, &quot;NO&quot; up there is a trifle... unright.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Even without an 'ear' it is possible to count. Look at my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; graph of this at  http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/appx7a.htm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (You may ignore the Marlovian propaganda at the beginning!)

&gt;&gt;&gt; This 'theory' is based on the assumption that the
&gt;&gt;&gt; poet could not tell the difference between a
&gt;&gt;&gt; masculine and a feminine ending -- and that his
&gt;&gt;&gt; verse was the product of some unconscious,
&gt;&gt;&gt; automatic process. Therefore (the 'theory' goes)
&gt;&gt;&gt; he could not possibly vary his style as he chose
&gt;&gt;&gt; (in this, or in any other, respect).

&gt;&gt; What are you blethering about? The graph demonstrates a high
&gt;&gt; correlation between (a) the approximate date given to the
&gt;&gt; plays by most Shakespearean scholars and (b) the number of
&gt;&gt; enjambments and feminine endings used. It can tell us nothing
&gt;&gt; about whether the writer did this consciously or unconsciously
&gt;&gt; or whether this was unique to him or part of a general trend.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The use of enjambments and feminine endings clearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; increases dramatically over time.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There _may_ be a broad trend.

&gt;&gt; There is a very clear and statistically highly significant
&gt;&gt; trend.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But it did not
&gt;&gt;&gt; come from a machine, and there is no reason why
&gt;&gt;&gt; the author would not have varied his style -- often
&gt;&gt;&gt; quite drastically -- on numerous occasions, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; for various purposes throughout his career.

&gt;&gt; It is quite clear from the graph that the author *did* vary
&gt;&gt; his style. Each deviation above or below the trendline
&gt;&gt; illustrates this (subject to a certain amount of inaccuracy
&gt;&gt; in the dating, but not *that* much).

&gt;&gt; The average (mean) value for all of the Shakespeare plays is
&gt;&gt; 40%. Every play differs from this to a greater or lesser
&gt;&gt; extent. It is possible, however, to calculate that 90% of
&gt;&gt; this difference is likely to be due to the trend, and only
&gt;&gt; 10% to other factors (such as the deliberate choice of the
&gt;&gt; poet to deviate from the trend on this occasion).

&gt;&gt; Going back to  http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/appx7a.htm
&gt;&gt; *Cymbeline* is easily found as the highest value of all, and
&gt;&gt; dated 1610. Now move that value back to where you think
&gt;&gt; *Cymbeline* should be (1595?) to see how extremely unlikely
&gt;&gt; such a huge deviation would have been at that time.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Stratfordians must necessarily think of the poet
&gt;&gt;&gt; as a kind of mindless automaton. (And that
&gt;&gt;&gt; conception reflects on their view of all literature.)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is that also required for Marlites? Or are
&gt;&gt;&gt; you just blindly following the Stratfordian lead?

&gt;&gt; Just using my brain, Paul.

&gt; Paul understands that the Oxfordianism and the orthodox
&gt; chronology are not compatible. He is certain that he's
&gt; right about Oxfordianism. Therefore, you are wrong.
&gt; QED. (ie. He needn't waste any of his stupendous brain
&gt; power considering statistically how unlikely or likely
&gt; his preferred chronology is.)

&gt; Perhaps you remember that some time ago I wrote a program
&gt; that goes through a bunch of tagged texts, produces a
&gt; list of &quot;rare words&quot; based upon a cutoff value, and
&gt; counts the number of rare words shared between texts.
&gt; I've continued to work on it off and on.

&gt; A couple of notes on the current state of the process:

&gt; #1. All words starting with a capital letter are still
&gt; discarded in the first step.

&gt; #2. The counts are now based upon sets of 9574 randomly
&gt; selected words taken from each text. (Most of the words
&gt; in each set are not rare words.) To compensate for
&gt; the statistical fluctuations inherent in the method, the
&gt; process is repeated thousands of times, (The reported
&gt; values are the averages of the results from all of the
&gt; iterations.)

&gt; A few weeks ago, I ran Shakespeare's plays(excluding HVIII and
&gt; Pericles) through. Here's a table listing the results for
&gt; Cymbeline for cutoffs of 6, 12, 18. 24. and 30:

Agreed. 'Respect' is important. But it is a very
different concept from 'reputation'. Words are
not interchangeable. You can NOT sue someone
for being disrespectful. (The word is unknown to
the Law.) You can (if you are not working-class)
sue someone for damaging your reputation.

That may change (or may be changing) but we
are talking about plays written 400 years ago.
There are no (or virtually no) legal cases in
English legal history of working-class men
suing for defamation. The idea of 'reputation'
is foreign to the English working class, whereas
it is a core one for the upper classes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;The word is of French origin. French concepts in the

&gt;&gt;However, it forms part of every English institution, such
&gt;&gt;as the law.

&gt; Well, that's me answered then. Respect is from a *Latin* root, so
&gt; obviously only Princess Michael of Kent could possibly be bothered

'Respect' is a very modern concept -- essentially
black American. If you want to make an argument

It's 15 plays written by a 33-year-old man, who
started to write at the age of 29 -- with material that
was (in some ways) extraordinarily crude (if still
being, in other ways, amazingly sophisticated).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Some of them adaptations

A few Stratfordian 'scholars' date the first
canonical plays to 1591. I don't think any
put them earlier. On who are you relying

His wife gave birth to twins when he was 21.
He was in Stratford around that time -- and
(even under wild Strat theories) for some
time after that.

Sure, sure. Amid the great luminaries of
Stratford-upon-Avon. No doubt he set up
his own theatre company there -- with all his
the highly literate companions in the village.
(Heck, any fantasy will do for Stratfordians.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; After Meres, the first mentions come so thick and fast

The 'so what' is that the _second_mentions_ of the

&gt;It's 15 plays written by a 33-year-old man, who
&gt;started to write at the age of 29 -- with material that
&gt;was (in some ways) extraordinarily crude (if still
&gt;being, in other ways, amazingly sophisticated).

"/>

He was 28 or 29 when his first known PUBLISHED
work appeared. However, there were references
to earlier work of the late eighties. Interestingly,
Ben Jonson was 28 when his first published work
appeared, but it is known from other sources
(Henslowe, one of them) that he was writing
plays at least three years before that.
I don't have access to a list of plays published
in Shakespeare's time, but I know that there was
not a big market for them. It is absurd to guess
when Shakespeare started writing plays using
just the date of his first published play.
It makes sense to assume that he started writing
when young, and took a while to write anything
good enough to be performed or published. That he
started at 23 is a fair guess but, as I said, he
could well have written his first play much earlier.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Some of them adaptations
&gt;&gt; of others' plays or novels. And the Henry 6 play is
&gt;&gt; really just one long play. One-and-a-half plays a year
&gt;&gt; if he started at age 23, which seems likely.

&gt;A few Stratfordian 'scholars' date the first
&gt;canonical plays to 1591. I don't think any
&gt;put them earlier. On who are you relying
&gt;(at this moment, and for this argument) ?

"/>

Just about all of them assume dates in the late eighties
for the first works. Boyce (Shakespeare A to Z) says
scholars date Titus from 1588 to 1594. Boyce says &quot;we
know&quot; that Henry VI, Part 1, was written between 1589
and 1592. The consensus. according to Boyce, is that
the three Henry VI plays and Richard III were written
in 1591 and 92. I, myself, think the first in the
tetralogy must have been written earlier than 1589 but
a reference to the Faerie Queene, published in 1589,
seems to put it after the Faerie Queene. I don't know
the reference, so don't know whether it might not
have been added later--or, as you would probably have
it--influenced Spenser rather than the other way around.

All this ignores possible (I would say probable) lost
plays, especially patchings of others' work.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;His wife gave birth to twins when he was 21.
&gt;He was in Stratford around that time -- and

We know he was not in Stratford but in London for
large portions of his life. Therefore, it is not wild
to believe he may not have been much in Stratford
after he was married. Certainly, there is no evidence
as to where he was except for the day in Stratford when
he impregnated his wife--if she never went to London.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And it is quite possible he had written rough drafts
&gt;&gt; earlier, even as a teen-ager.

&gt;Sure, sure. Amid the great luminaries of
&gt;Stratford-upon-Avon. No doubt he set up
&gt;his own theatre company there -- with all his
&gt;the highly literate companions in the village.
&gt;(Heck, any fantasy will do for Stratfordians.)

"/>

Paul, it is not fantasizing to suggest he went
to the school available in Stratford, nor that
that school, like other schools, had plays in
its curriculum. Schoolboys, I've read, acted in
plays sometimes. Shakespeare could have seen
visiting troupes perform, too. Ergo, unless he
was a moron, he could have tried his hand a making
up plays. As, indeed, pre-school children do,
for Pete's sake. Oh, and it IS possible to write
plays for no one but oneself, as I know from
experience.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Oh? I wasn't aware of that. If true, though, so what?

&gt;The 'so what' is that the _second_mentions_ of the
&gt;plays are usually _way_ down the road -- in the

&gt;until the First Folio came out in 1623. So claiming
&gt;that the first mention came immediately after the
&gt;composition in nearly every case is . . . . . err . . .
&gt;more than a tad suspicious.

"/>

We've been through this before. You have to examine the
plays on a case by case basis. The fact that the King's
Men had a lot of clout and could stay publication of their
plays undoubtedly was one of many factors in why so
many of Shakespeare's plays were not published till
the First Folio. Also, of course, the fact that the
company was wealthy and did not need to make money through
the sale of plays to publishers.

No one claims, by the way, that the first mention came
immediately after the composition, only that first mentions
strongly suggest recent composition.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Which is it, Creepy? Are you going to lie and say that &quot;respect&quot; means
&gt;&gt; nothing to the working class?

&gt; It certainly has a very different sense today to
&gt; a young black than it had to a working-class
&gt; Londoner around, say, 1940.

&gt;&gt; Or are you going to twist and start
&gt;&gt; saying that you'll only use words as they are defined in law, or in
&gt;&gt; chemistry, or in Islamic philosophy, or in whatever dictionary you can
&gt;&gt; find that will serve to confuse the argument.

&gt; It's important to understand the language used
&gt; at the time. So here are the questions once again:

&gt; Where is the ONE case from English literature of a
&gt; working-class man expressing concern about his
&gt; 'reputation'?
&gt; Where is the ONE case from English history of a
&gt; working-class man expressing concern about his
&gt; 'reputation'?

&gt; Where are there other cases of working-class
&gt; men expressing interest in intellectual, literary, or
&gt; artistic matters?

D.H.Lawrence for a start!

&gt;&gt; Why don't you make the experiment yourself. Walk into a London pub, and

&gt;&gt; don't know what &quot;reputation&quot; means.

&gt;&gt; I'll be in the car.

&gt; They would know what 'reputation' means; and
&gt; they would be far from ignorant. The question
&gt; is whether or not they feel that anyone has ever
&gt; impugned their own reputation or those of their
&gt; family or friends, and whether or not they and
&gt; their friends worry about such things.

&gt; This discussion is ridiculous.

&gt; Rob,

&gt; Thanks for this. Not quite sure what you now mean by
&gt; 'cut-off point' if you are no longer restricting it to 'rare
&gt; words'. Could you explain a bit more please?

"/>

A bit simplified...

The program starts with these three steps:

#1. Every noncapitalized word found in the texts is put
into a table. There is one table entry per word appearance,
so the table contains duplicates.

#2. Using that table and the cutoff value, a list of rare words
is found.

#3. A table like that found in step #1 is made for each text.
(These tables also contain duplicates.)

And then for each pair of texts, the following trial
is repeated thousands of times:

A. A set of 9754 randomly selected words is taken from one of the
text tables found in step #3.

B. The same thing is done for the other text.

C. For each *unique* word in the randomly selected set of words
found in step B,
If the word exists in the set found in step C and is in
the rare word list,
the shared rare word count is incremented.

A note on the &quot;*unique*&quot; mentioned in step D: The randomly selected
sets will usually contain multiple instances of some words, but only
the first instance of each word is checked.

The final value for each pair of texts is the average
of all of their trial shared rare word counts.

Does that make sense?

One further note: The 9754 mentioned above in step
B(in step C, implicitly) is determined at run time.
It is a value exactly equal to the number of words
in the smallest table found in step #3. (ie. It
will vary depending upon the size of the smallest
text in the run.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Even without an 'ear' it is possible to count. Look at my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; graph of this at  http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/appx7a.htm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (You may ignore the Marlovian propaganda at the beginning!)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This 'theory' is based on the assumption that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; poet could not tell the difference between a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; masculine and a feminine ending -- and that his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; verse was the product of some unconscious,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; automatic process. Therefore (the 'theory' goes)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he could not possibly vary his style as he chose
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (in this, or in any other, respect).

&gt;&gt;&gt; What are you blethering about? The graph demonstrates a high
&gt;&gt;&gt; correlation between (a) the approximate date given to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; plays by most Shakespearean scholars and (b) the number of
&gt;&gt;&gt; enjambments and feminine endings used. It can tell us nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt; about whether the writer did this consciously or unconsciously
&gt;&gt;&gt; or whether this was unique to him or part of a general trend.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The use of enjambments and feminine endings clearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; increases dramatically over time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There _may_ be a broad trend.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a very clear and statistically highly significant
&gt;&gt;&gt; trend.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But it did not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come from a machine, and there is no reason why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the author would not have varied his style -- often
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quite drastically -- on numerous occasions, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for various purposes throughout his career.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is quite clear from the graph that the author *did* vary
&gt;&gt;&gt; his style. Each deviation above or below the trendline
&gt;&gt;&gt; illustrates this (subject to a certain amount of inaccuracy
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the dating, but not *that* much).

&gt;&gt;&gt; The average (mean) value for all of the Shakespeare plays is
&gt;&gt;&gt; 40%. Every play differs from this to a greater or lesser
&gt;&gt;&gt; extent. It is possible, however, to calculate that 90% of
&gt;&gt;&gt; this difference is likely to be due to the trend, and only
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10% to other factors (such as the deliberate choice of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; poet to deviate from the trend on this occasion).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Going back to  http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/appx7a.htm
&gt;&gt;&gt; *Cymbeline* is easily found as the highest value of all, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; dated 1610. Now move that value back to where you think
&gt;&gt;&gt; *Cymbeline* should be (1595?) to see how extremely unlikely
&gt;&gt;&gt; such a huge deviation would have been at that time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stratfordians must necessarily think of the poet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as a kind of mindless automaton. (And that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conception reflects on their view of all literature.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is that also required for Marlites? Or are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you just blindly following the Stratfordian lead?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just using my brain, Paul.

&gt;&gt; Paul understands that the Oxfordianism and the orthodox
&gt;&gt; chronology are not compatible. He is certain that he's
&gt;&gt; right about Oxfordianism. Therefore, you are wrong.
&gt;&gt; QED. (ie. He needn't waste any of his stupendous brain
&gt;&gt; power considering statistically how unlikely or likely
&gt;&gt; his preferred chronology is.)

&gt;&gt; Perhaps you remember that some time ago I wrote a program
&gt;&gt; that goes through a bunch of tagged texts, produces a
&gt;&gt; list of &quot;rare words&quot; based upon a cutoff value, and
&gt;&gt; counts the number of rare words shared between texts.
&gt;&gt; I've continued to work on it off and on.

&gt;&gt; A couple of notes on the current state of the process:

&gt;&gt; #1. All words starting with a capital letter are still
&gt;&gt; discarded in the first step.

&gt;&gt; #2. The counts are now based upon sets of 9574 randomly
&gt;&gt; selected words taken from each text. (Most of the words
&gt;&gt; in each set are not rare words.) To compensate for
&gt;&gt; the statistical fluctuations inherent in the method, the
&gt;&gt; process is repeated thousands of times, (The reported
&gt;&gt; values are the averages of the results from all of the
&gt;&gt; iterations.)

&gt;&gt; A few weeks ago, I ran Shakespeare's plays(excluding HVIII and
&gt;&gt; Pericles) through. Here's a table listing the results for
&gt;&gt; Cymbeline for cutoffs of 6, 12, 18. 24. and 30:

&gt;&gt; Clearly, rare words most closely connect Cymbeline to the plays

&gt;&gt; Paul's level of certainty) as an independent confirmation of your

What kind of logic is that? Upper-class twits have
always been extremely concerned about their
reputation among other upper-class twits because,
(for each individual) their power depended upon it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Such classes don't have power. Their incomes and
their 'careers' don't depend on their 'reputation'
among their mates. They work for one boss (often
for most of their lives) and all that matters is their
boss's opinion of the work they do. The boss judges
that on what he sees before him. 'Reputation' is not
just irrelevant -- it is meaningless.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Males are rarely concerned about 'what the
neighbours think. (Females may be, especially
about sexual conduct, where reputation may well
come in. But that is a very special area, with no
relevance to the current issue. It has its own
vocabulary, of which there is plenty in the canon.)

We could do the same kind of analysis for all the
other topics that Shakespeare brings into his plays
and poems. In nearly every case we will find that
upper-classes are interested and need to be
concerned about them, and working-classes aren't
interested and don't need to be concerned. This
is not a matter of 'snobbery' -- as Strats like to
claim. It is simple plain fact -- about the way in
which all societies work.

The nonsense of Shakespeare writing for the
'groundlings' is simply crazy. Everyone knows
this, even if the Strats can't admit it.

Paul.

The above is typical of Paul. Based on who knows what experience of creative
writing, Paul can't believe Shakespeare wrote anything not aimed exclusively at
geniuses like himself and, in his view, Queen Elizabeth I. He doesn't
understand that any writer worth a sou writes for humanity, and is therefore
understood at SOME level by everyone, and not understood at some level by
everyone--perhaps even including himself. And Paul believes, even more
insanely, that if one holds that Shakespeare expected (&quot;illiterate&quot;) groundlings
to understand his words sufficiently in all cases, and entirely in some, one
necessarily holds that Shakespeare aimed his work at groundlings exclusively.

This was not 'dialog' in any ordinary sense.
It is an extraordinary speech, and it makes no
particular sense (from the point of view of the
plot) when put into the mouth of the dying
John of Gaunt. It is clearly the expression of
an opinion, held (or thought to be held) by
some of those at the pinnacles of power.

You can take it as more-or-less straight
reporting of that opinion. Or you can read it
as the poet pushing its expression to the limit
and -- to a large extent -- taking the piss.

Knowing our playwright, there is really no
choice on that issue -- for a reader with a
sliver of intelligence.

The estimate by Stratfordian 'scholars' comes from
several indications. There are the first mention of
the canonical plays, and a misreading of Henslowe's
note of 'ne' as 'new' when it almost certainly indicates
'Newington Butts' -- the location of his other theatre.

Then there is the 'first heir of my invention' -- in the
dedication of V&amp;A in 1593. Also there is the famous
mention in Groatsworth -- which you swallow whole.
It seems that you are now ready to junk all that, and
decide that (a) the poet was a liar; (b) that the author
of Groatsworth was happy being a liar; and (c) that
all of the latter's (knowledgeable) readership would
be happy seeing him writing lies.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

As always, nothing Stratfordian makes any sense.
You can make far-fetched speculations about

&gt;&gt;his own theatre company there -- with all his

You will use exactly the opposite argument when
you (i.e. Stratfordians) date the composition of a
large number of the plays to just before the
publication of their first quarto (or other printing
record, such as a 'stay'): 2 Henry VI, AYLI,
Anth &amp; Cleo, Troilus &amp; Cressida, Much Ado,
Merry Wives, 1 &amp; 2 Henry IV, Rom &amp; Jul,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

'First mentions' should NOT strongly suggest
recent composition. They only suggest
composition at some time within the previous
twenty-five years or so. Working purely on the

The issue is NOT authorship -- but the dating of
the works of a known author. As an example, let's
say we find a work which we decide is by John
Ford. We now want to estimate _when_ he wrote it.
Did Ford gradually and consistently change some
particular aspect of his style over the years?

The question is next to absurd. There is not a

&gt; 'Newington Butts' -- the location of his other theatre.

"/>

Most of what follows was found by looking through Carson's _A Companion to
Henslowe's Diary_.

61 out of 63 of the performances marked 'ne' also mark the first
appearance of a play in the accounts. One of the two exceptions is
_Alexander and Lodowick_ for which we see the first and second
performances marked with 'ne'. The other exception is the _French Comedy_
which is first seen in the list on 11 Feb 1595 and marked there with 'ne'.
The play appears to have been performed six times in the next few
months(none of those receipts are marked with 'ne') and then disappears
until 18 Apr 1597, when it appears to have been revived. The first
performance in that revivial was marked with an 'ne'.

It seems unlikely that a 3% error rate would be enough to to break the
model in the eyes of most people, but there's at least one more fact to
consider. Although there are 61 times where 'ne' seems to match up very
well with what seem likely to have been new plays, there are also 52 times
where we don't see an 'ne' where we might expect to see one. (ie. When a
play is first mentioned in the account.) That fact, as far as I know,
presents the best point against the usual identification of the meaning
for Henslowe's 'ne'. (As far as I know, it is not impossible that most,
if not all, of the apparent discrepancies were revivals of old plays.)

What about Paul's idea that 'ne' meant 'Newington Butts'?

On the pro side, there's the coincidence of letters and the fact that a
few of the performances in Henslowe's accounts were definitely at that
theater. (Yes, I know those are extremely slight points from which to
reason to &quot;almost certainty&quot;. Perhaps, Paul will let us know what I've
missed.)

On the con side, Newington Butts was located at least a mile south of the
city. The Rose, on the other hand, was located within a stones throw of
the Thames. (Some readers may remember the Privy Council order that
remarked on the &quot;tediousness of the way&quot; to Newington.) Nevertheless, the
receipts marked 'ne' are almost uniformly the largest. (Typically, the
receipts from following performances of the same play tail off gradually.)

There is a set of entries in Henslowe's accounts under the heading &quot;In the
name of God Amen begininge at Newington my Lord Admeralle men and my Lorde
Chamberlen men, As ffolowethe 1594&quot;. (I believe no other entries in
Henslowe's accounts explicitly mention Newington.) The average receipt in
of the ten explicitly known Newington performances appears to be 1/4(or
less) of the average of the receipts outside that list. (An example: a
_Jew of Malta_ performance one month earlier brought in 2 pounds 8
shillings. At Newington, Henslowe listed 10s for one _Jew of Malta_
performance and 4s for another.) If 'ne' meant 'Newington' the two weeks
of performances explicitly listed as being at Newington must have been
some sort of aberration.

There is just one performance on the Newington list marked 'ne'. If 'ne'
meant Newington, one could reasonably expect either all or none of the
plays to be marked with 'ne'. (ie. One would have to expect that the
'ne' was something of a mistake. I observe that the 'ne' there does mark
the first time _Bellendon_ appears in Henslowe's accounts, so it is
entirely consistent with 'ne' meaning 'new'.)

As another illustration of the receipt difference, I note that Henslowe
listed 17 shillings income for the 'ne' _Bellendon_ performance at
Newington. The average over the entire set of accounts for the receipts
from a play marked 'ne' appears to be better than 3 pounds. Indeed, the
next account of a performance of _Bellendon_ is not under the Newington
heading, is not marked 'ne' and Henslowe's account shows it as bringing in
3 pounds 4 shillings.

You can all make up your own minds, but for what it's worth, my own view
is that Henslowe's 'ne' very likely was meant to indicate 'new'.

&lt;snip of long detailed argument on this&gt;

I readily withdraw my &quot;almost certainly indicates
'Newington Butts' . .&quot;. I can't remember where I
picked up that impression -- possibly from Gurr.
But if it is wrong -- as seems probable from Rob's
argument -- then so be it.

Let's say Henslowe wrote them down as 'new'.
What does that mean? They may have been
entirely 'new' to Henslowe or, possibly, they were
starting a new run. The latter does not get us far.
There are plenty of items that suggest an earlier
existence for many plays, but all are disputed.

The former has been the traditional view, and
(with the 'first heir' bit in the dedication to V&amp;A)
is the basis for the daft and fantastical Stratfordian
line that the playwright began his career when he
was nearly 30.

In my view they were probably new to Henslowe.
The Shakespeare plays were old, performed at
court, and this is the first time they were released
to the public stage as 'commercial' products.
The great printing run of 1594 shows that there
had been a recent change in policy, probably
brought about by a health scare in respect of the
Queen and a realisation that if the plays were
not put into print, the new dynasty might suppress
them altogether, leaving posterity with nothing.
The release of the plays to the commercial stage
(and to Henslowe) would have been a part of
that new policy.

&gt; You can all make up your own minds, but for what it's worth, my own view

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; is that Henslowe's 'ne' very likely was meant to indicate 'new'.

What is amazing is how it is possible to have
such a detailed, logical and rational (even
'scholarly') discussion within an overall
framework which is so insane -- a near-
peasant, with no evidence of education, from
an illiterate family, with illiterate children, is
supposed to have started his 'career' at the
age of 29, and then retired at the age of 48
(winding down towards the end). And during
that brief 'career' he is supposed to have
progressed from poor efforts like 'Lucrece'
Titus Andronicus to works of unparallelled
grandeur.
