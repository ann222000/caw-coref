Ok, here I am a lazy touring boat paddler now trying to paddle an old
ww boat. Once up to speed and given any excuse these boats want to
turn 180. Do people ever add skegs to ww boats when they have to
paddle them a fair distance upstream or on flatwater? Thanks.

WW boats are designed to go in a circle, not a straight line.

I had the same experience the first time me and my crew rented some WW
kayaks to go on a float on a flatwater river. We has a miserable time
trying to get the damned things to go straight! We were cussing and
kicking and crying about how they should have put a keel on them, or
sumpin!! (White Bros kayaks)

Funny thing happened though. Within the year we all signed up for a
whitewater kayak class, and we all bought whitewater kayaks, having
learned how to paddle them. And a couple of years later, somebody
bright a White Bros kayak to the pool chass, and I saw it and said
"I've got to paddle this thing!" And I got in, and paddled it straight
and fast across the pool! I was amazed at how fast a boat it was too!

Difference? I had learned how to paddle a whitewater boat. If you want
a whitewater boat to go straight, you have to steer it straight with
every paddlestroke. The boat's not gonna help you go straight,
*you've* got to paddle it straight by steering it straight with each
paddlestroke, which I had learned to do.

Practice helps one heck of a lot.  I let a friend use my little Otter
rec kayak one day and I used my old Dancer ww.  He was sure I had some
sort of keel on it, because his other friend with a ww boat couldn't
keep a line worth a damn.  But I'd been using mainly the ww Dancer for
rec touring and gotten very used to it.

Don't try to go fast at first.  You'll dig in too hard on one side or
another.  Don't get upset about little front end wiggles and go
overcompensating.  Just keep on using the boat and it'll come
naturally.  Should you do a 180, paddle it into a 360 and keep on
going.  Keep in mind the motto of the cat, "I meant to do that."

If nothing else, do cross stream ferries.  You'll get to know the
whole river / lake that way....  :)

It can be done. Most people don't do it, but if you want to, why not?
Yeah, OK, you'll be better off in the long run learning to control the
boat with paddle strokes, but you're a "lazy touring boat paddler,"
right? It's your boat, do what makes you happy.

I'm inclined to do so. I could then practice paddling with the skeg up
and still put it down whenever I was tired and struggling. I'm
surprised this isn't more commonly done. Retractable skegs are common
-- but not on ww boats.

Ah, you're not so lazy after all if you're going to go to the trouble of
fitting a retractable skeg on an Outburst. As I said, it's your boat,
enjoy it how you want.

There is one...........

Pyranha Master TG has a drop down skeg....it is a big boat that is
great for first time users.....i can imagine that river running must
be cake with this boat....
instead of grab loops it has handle molded in....i have heard
hilarious reports that water can shoot up through those handles if you
are on a wave and bury the bow a little bit....
kinda like the boat is sneezing....

Well, I know it takes at least ten sweeps to turn my CD Storm 360
degrees. These silly ww boats will turn 360 with one sweep. Now on the
Storm you then add a rudder -- for even more stability -- so I'm
mystified why retractable skegs are not common on ww boats, especially
the old ww boats with some length to them. I think the added stability
would be good for paddling upstream and for crossing flatwater. Once
you approach ww you'd pull the skeg up.

'Cause those that use WW kayaks a lot paddle them without problems.  It
doesn't take that long to get used to applying a correction on every
stroke.  A skeg is one more thing to fuss with and one more thing to
break.  Since these paddling skills are essential for WW, applying them
to the flatwater sections of a river are no big deal.

Hardware is no substitute for skill.

Dave, lazy may be less relevant.

I go down to the lake to run laps for a work out in my WW. I have been
paddling for years and can make it go where ever I want.  I just want
to get the cardio work out. Lots of forward motion at the pace of the
music in my ipod.

I found a belt on skag on the internet a couple of years back.  It's
6" deep and I belt it (3" strap) behind the seat, on the combing.  I
can position it whereever and when ever, ie while on the water.

I'm not finding the site where I found it, but it was a surf site.

You could buy a surf fin and secure it to a strap... cost of $15.

My next idea is to add some bungee lines to the decks, for use on
flatwater.
