In this month's &quot;Rifle Magazine&quot;  16 gun writers  went to Africa, most
taking a small bore and a big bore rifle with them.  Some took old
calibers and some modern new short magnum calibers.  There they were
wined and dined and allowed to gun down 100 head of African game
animals on a game farm.  Can you imagine how expensive this would have
been if they would have had to pay for it?  I guess we could easily
call this &quot;the million dollar hunt&quot;.

Two writers took the 9.3x62 and the classic 7x57 Mauser rifles .
Both, after a period of shooting found the 7x57 killed just as well as
the big bore blaster the 9x3x62 (.365 cal.)  Both eventually switched
over to using the 7x57 and not with the very heavy weight bullets as
you might have thought but using the 150 grain Nosler Partition that
has been around longer than many hunters.  The 156 gr. Norma Oryx was
also used.  Seems as though the &quot;Elmer Keith&quot;  &quot;extra toughness myth&quot;
about African game was  just that, only a myth.   Of Course many, many
years ago Jack O'Connor said the same thing, much to the outrage of
&quot;big bore only&quot; Elmer Keith.

Some modern calibers were also used such as the .325 Win. Short
Magnum, which by the way failed miserably with fast expanding bullets
proving if you use the wrong bullet that even the magnums can fail to
penetrate, no matter how big and how fast they are.

Other calibers used were the .270 Winchester, 7mm-08, .308 Win..300
Win. Short Magnum, .300 Win. Mag., 338 Win. Magnum, and the ubiquitous
375 H &amp; H Magnum.

Lessons learned: It matters not what caliber you shoot standard or
magnum, big bore or small bore but bullet placement and construction
that was the key, not caliber, and yes the smaller calibers killed
just fine, including the .270 Winchester which again refutes the
&quot;Elmer Keith&quot;  &quot;Big Bore Myth&quot; (that anything less than a magnum big
bore is totally worthless, especially on the mythical  super tough
African game.)

Seriously, what would Elmer have said if he had been on this recent
hunt and observed 100 head of  &quot;mythical tough&quot; African game being
gunned down with nothing more than the .270 Winchester.  I think his
best bet to save face would have been to throw himself off of Victoria
Falls with Jack O'Connor giving him a standing ovation.

I'd imagine he would have said something like &quot;I never liked the
taste of crow, but when that's all there is to eat all that is left to
say is Bon Apitite!&quot;.

Seriously, They have been using the 7 and 8mm Mauser in Africa for
years. I hear a lot of people talk of how you need something like a
50BMG to take down a cape buffalo, and I agree that in a tight
situation, it is always nice to have a little edge with respect to sheer
power, but as was found out, it is all about shot placement. I know
people who have killed some pretty big critters with a .22 LR. It wasn't
as fast or clean as the one step and drop kind of kill that might have
been done with something like a .308 or 6.5x55, but it took the critter
out just the same.  I'm not advocating using a .22lr on a Rhino, but I
don't buy the idea that a 30-06 would bounce off a Rhino's side if he
were shot with that caliber. In fact, I'd bet that the 338-06 variant
would be able to take plenty of African game in the hands of a good
rifleman. The same goes for a lot of classic hunting rounds. I think
Jack O'Connor was a bit more of a realist then Elmer Keith. Now it is
Ackley Improved stuff that is all the rage. Take a perfectly good case,
flatten the shoulder, add a little more powder and voila! the cartridge
you can't live without. I'm sorry, but I just plain don't buy into this
improved and magnum mania. I respect what such rifles can do and admit
that they do deliver a little more punch, but I am not going to retire a
..308 so I can get an Ackley Improved .308 or some Elmer Keith over
pressured round. Doing things like loading a .45 Colt to .44 mag
pressures is not my idea of a safe and fun time.   People hunted without
the aid of big Magnums for a good many years. They still do with great
success. I know I'm not retiring my non magnum, non 'improved' rifles
anytime soon. Guess I will really stir up a stink the next time I go out
with my 30-40 Krag!. My goodness, I better not hunt anything bigger then
a field mouse!

Here's an interesting experiment--why don't you go to Africa and hunt
Cape Buffalo with a .22 LR? Should make for some fascinating reading.

Shot placement, bullet construction, penetration capabilities of
loading.  This is more important than just &quot;caliber&quot;.

Typical plains animals in africa are easily taken with normal
calibers. As long as its suitiable for elk it will work there. I don't
think anyone ever really contested that.

A 270 for cape, rhino, elephant...?  Certainly less has been used.
Dozens of elephants are killed every year with 7.65x39's.  Clean
humane kills? Not from what Ive seen.

Im going to have to read that article. Sounds interesting.
The part about &quot; allowed to gun down 100 head of African game animals
on a game farm&quot; kind of caught my eye.  Were these fish in a barrel
shots, or excited angry hunted animal shots?

Talk about using emotive language: &quot;big bore blaster&quot; indeed!  The
9.3x62 is a gentleman of a cartridge.  Certainly, it has a larger
diameter than the 7x57, but your point is what exactly?  The 9.3x62
isn't a 'blaster', it delivers modest velocities unlike, say, a .300WM.

Now, more to the point, what species were these folks shooting?  There
is a massive (literally) difference between a springbok, an oryx, and a
buffalo.  You haven't indicated what species they were shooting, that's
a vital piece of information.  Why did you omit it?  Without this
information, you post is virtually meaningless and reduced to mere
noise: knocking anything larger than a .308W and knocking certain
deceased writers.

Of course, certain people killed many elephants with the 7x57 but that
doesn't mean the cartridge is suitable for the task.  Or are you saying
it is?

#Seems as though the &quot;Elmer Keith&quot;  &quot;extra toughness myth&quot;
#about African game was  just that, only a myth.

Have you had any first hand experience of African game?  Have you seen
the thickness of the hide on an oryx?  It seems unlikely.  Do you know
anything about wound ballistics?  What tissue (other than bone) presents
the greatest resistance to the passage of a bullet?  Clue: it's skin.
You mention (below) that some 'fast expanding' bullets failed to
penetrate.  What bullets were these, and on what game?  Do the writers
say why they chose to use unsuitable bullets?  We require details, not
your opinions - we can form our own opinions so give us all of the facts
not just the one or two that suit your prejudices.

#Some modern calibers were also used such as the .325 Win. Short
#Magnum, which by the way failed miserably with fast expanding bullets
#proving if you use the wrong bullet that even the magnums can fail to
#penetrate, no matter how big and how fast they are.

Correct.  The **bullet** failed, the cartridge didn't fail.  If these
writers knew anything on the subject, they wouldn't have used &quot;fast
expanding bullets&quot;, would they?  It is fair to say that the hunters
failed, not the .325WSM cartridge.  It is well known that firing a
standard bullets at high velocity (e.g. a close range shot from a
.300WM) can result in an explosive surface wound and a failure to
penetrate.  That's nothing new, it's why Winchester developed Black
Talons for hunting - to cope with all conditions and circumstances.

#Other calibers used were the .270 Winchester, 7mm-08, .308 Win..300
#Win. Short Magnum, .300 Win. Mag., 338 Win. Magnum, and the ubiquitous
#375 H &amp; H Magnum.
#
#Lessons learned: It matters not what caliber you shoot standard or
#magnum, big bore or small bore

Well, **of course** it matters.  Try shooting a buffalo or a giraffe
with a .22-250 and see what happens.

#but bullet placement and construction
#that was the key, not caliber,

Which is why the anecdote you mentioned in another post, where a hunter
shot a moose several times and it didn't drop and had to be killed by
another hunter using a .270, is apropos.  You blamed the hunter's choice
of cartridge, I blamed the hunter's poor shooting (he must have missed
with every shot since you mention no additional wounds).  But as I said,
a miss.  I'm pleased to hear that you agree with me for once, bullet
placement is the most important issue.

#Seriously, what would Elmer have said if he had been on this recent
#hunt and observed 100 head of  &quot;mythical tough&quot; African game being
#gunned down with nothing more than the .270 Winchester.  I think his
#best bet to save face would have been to throw himself off of Victoria
#Falls with Jack O'Connor giving him a standing ovation.

Who knows what he would have said?  He would probably have said a .270
is fine for impala but not for buffalo.  ;-)

Now, how about you give us the full details of this trip?  What species
were shot etc?  Unless we know what species were shot your entire post
is meaningless.  See, I could argue that the .22LR is the perfect
cartridge since I've cleanly killed hundreds of animals with it, no one
needs anything bigger - and I'd be correct.  We could then have a
discussion about bigger calibres, people's favourite this or that and so
on.  Of course, if I then mentioned that I'd been shooting rabbits and
rats, not wild boar, you say that I should have given that information
at the start.

So, give us the information to put the calibre debate into perspective
please.

I always enjoy reading challenges based on stupid bravado (with the emphasis
on stupid)
I guess some people never grow out of the elementary school yard mindset

You put that .22 in that buffalo's eye and through his brain pan, that
buffalo will fold up like an accordeon.
Hell,, if you use a .17 you can even do it from farther away.
It's NOT the size of the bullet that is important
It's WHERE you put it

But so what ?
If you had nothing else with you at the time and you needed to put down that
buffalo, you would use whatever you had with you to do the job
But that does NOT mean that you would specifically go out to do it, UNLESS
you were doing it to respond (like a child) to the challenge of another
child.

Nitro Express and he would have used the 700 nitro if it had been
available back then.

The caliber most commonly used to cull elephants is the 7.62 NATO.

Does that mean I'd use it on an elephant hunt?

Hell no.

Blather about what Karamojo Bell did with a 6.5 Mannlicher-Schoenauer
is irrelevant today.  Bell had nerves of stainless steel, was a superb
shot and hunted elephants when it was possible to approach a herd
without having the beasts panic and convert him into a wet spot on the
Serengeti.

Making a shot on dangerous game under ideal conditions is far
different from dealing with the bad boys when they are riled up and
headed your way in a hurry.

Most African big game hunters used heavy big bore guns that they had
their gun-bearers tote for them until it was time for the shot.

Yes and it is very easy to kill humans with a 38 Spec. But in Miami
Platt was fatally shot and still after receiving a fatal wound managed
to return fire, kill 2 FBI agents and wound a few others before he died.

Do you really want to suffer a surprise attack by something hard to kill
intent on disemboweling you armed with an only adequate gun?

How is recutting the *chamber* to a more blown out AI version of the
same cartridge going to restore the *throat*?

This is certainly the myth that the &quot;Big Bore fanatics&quot; like to
promote.  The real facts are that Bell's writing tell of him getting
so close he could smell the elephants and he survived many charges
totally refuting the claim that once an animal becomes enraged only
the shell form a 20mm aircraft rapid fire cannon will stop him.  The
stories remind me of the Aesop's fables about mythical Greek monsters.

Just a few years ago there was a TV documentary showing the culling
(polite term form slaughter)of an Elephant herd.  The rifles used were
FN Fal's using nothing more than 150 grain fmj military ammo and the
Elephant victims bit the dust as if they were hit by lightening.  Of
course the &quot;big bore boys&quot; come up with the wildest excuses and
explanations for such visual proof of small bores killing the biggest
of land creatures.

I think he meant that when the gun is re-chambered the barre is first
set back and then the chamber is re-cut which moves the chamber

and decades.

In response to the &quot;myth&quot; that Bell only hunted on the open plains
where he could &quot;pick his shots at long range&quot;,  the &quot;big bore boys&quot;
should all read this one.

There is even one story out of Bell's books that tell of him hunting
elephants in such tall grass on the open plains (are you listening to
this &quot;big bore boys&quot;) that he had to use a ladder to shoot over the
grass at elephants that he was right on top of.  Now if he had never
been able to stop a charge with his 6.5 Mannlicher or 7x57 the book
would never have been written.  So you see the &quot;big bore boys&quot; do not
even take into consideration that when you could find elephants on the
&quot;open African plains&quot; the plains were not so open at all when the
grass was taller than a mans head.  Another &quot;Myth buster&quot; exposed as
they say on the boob tube.  So how did he stop a charging elephant
that was on top of him, why with his 6.5 Manlicher.

&quot;Another myth is that these guys were all super shots&quot; formulated by
the &quot;big bore fanatics&quot; which in turn  sub-consciously implies that
the big bores would kill better if  a  modern &quot;Joe average hunter who
cannot shoot to well, would be better off using, meaning of course
that the &quot;big bore&quot; kills even with a badly placed shot.  Again pure
balderdash as a poorly placed shot with either the big or small bore
means a wounded animal but the &quot;big bore boys&quot; will solemnly
postulate, with of course a completely &quot;straight face&quot; that when using
the 'big bores' even if the shot is poorly placed will knock an animal
down, spin him around or make him disappear in a read puff of mist.

I also should have mentioned another very, very famous man Jim Corbett
that was so famous at the time of his encounters with man eating
Tigers that newspaper reporters were actually sent &quot;out into the
field&quot; to get the latest progress reports on his hair raising hunts
against the &quot;toughest and most blood thirsty carnivorous beasts&quot; that
ever lived.
Corbett too fell for the &quot;big bore myth&quot; and started out using a
double barrel elephant rifle of .45 caliber to fell the bloodthirsty
beasts until one day he walked into a gun store in India and there he
be-held one of the most beautiful rifles he had ever seen sitting in a
horizontal rack on the gun shop counter.  It was, you guess it, an
English 275 Rigby 98 Mauser rifle (7x57 mm).   He bought said gun and
ditched his &quot;big bore blaster&quot; and never wanted to look at it again.
In one hunt he shot 3 man eating tigers (a tiger family) on the run in
slightly more than 3 seconds.  None of the beasts got away showing the
tremendous killing power of such a weapon.

Now lets take a look at another incident that happened about the same
time in Africa against a charging Lion.  A certain British hunter who
was of royal blood was using an 8mm magnum rifle when he was charged
by a Lion.  The bullet he was using was of a new quick expanding type
that flew to pieces and did not penetrate, which resulted in the
hunter being mauled and killed. This story by the way was widely
published in many of the shooting magazines of the time.  Now right
away the &quot;big bore&quot; fanatics of the time started screaming, &quot;see we
told you so&quot;, he should have used a big bore  blaster.   This totally
ignored the facts of the case i.e. that he was using the wrong bullet
and in spite of using a &quot;magnum cartridge&quot; the beast still killed
him.  I think we can begin to see the how and why's of how so many of
the &quot;big bore&quot; myths and philosophies got started and how they were
perpetuated down through the years.

It must also be remembered that other famous hunters also used small
bore guns such as Neuman who also shot probably as many elephants as
Bell did and he too used small bore guns like the .303 British at a
time when it was considered near suicide to use such a weapon on such
big beasts.  And if you read his writings, he did not shoot them at
1,000 yards either, but up close where it was &quot;down and dirty&quot;
blasting.  And yes he even tells of the beasts charging him.

I think too the &quot;myth&quot; formulated by the &quot;big bore boys&quot; about how
easy it was to knock off elephants at 1,000 yards with small bores
should read the writings of Selous who was also a great elephant
hunter and one of the &quot;early African hunters&quot;  who the &quot;big bore boys&quot;
say, was at a time, when you could knock off  elephants like flies and
at long rang.

The facts are Selous's writings show he seldom got the opportunity to
knock any of them off at long range.  No, he did not usually use small
bores but the lesson to be learned here was that an elephant hunt
often took place at very close ranges and no he just did not jump off
his horse and carefully pick his shot as the &quot;big bore myth creators&quot;
would have you believe.  In the old days the hunting was done mostly
on foot and it often took several days of near running flat out to
keep up with an elephant heard that at a mere walk were traveling as
fast as a man can run flat out and when the elephants were spooked
they ran as fast as a race horse.  When said hunter finally did catch
up with them he had to take the shot often under very dangerous
circumstances and when he did other elephants would charge the hunter
in addition to the one he had just shot. When shooting such large
numbers of dangerous animals the law of averages dictates that you are
going to get charged sooner or later and it is probably sooner not
later.  So you can see that if the small bore had been totally
worthless none of the &quot;old time hunters&quot; that were hunting at the same
time Selous was and unlike Selous were using &quot;small bores&quot; would ever
have lived to write any books about it

Let us not also for get J.F. Burger who was actually a big bore user
but was honest enough to relate a story about a widow woman who was
forced to kill cattle killing lions in the middle of the night with
nothing more than a 7x57 and her flashlight.  Burger was aghast,
telling her she should be using a much bigger caliber for such
dangerous work.  She was rather surprised and simply answered that if
you hit them right this little rifle works just fine.  Nuff said, just
another example of the hundreds of  people that used small bores in
Africa over the last 100 years, and the people who have been beating
the &quot;big bore drums&quot; for years simply do not want you to hear about
these people.

All this reminds me of a young fellow who while sitting down at a
dinner one night got some bad romantic news about his unfaithful girl
friend.  He dove straight away, head first out the window and you
could hear his voice echoing in the night evening as he ran pell-mell
through the night.  We could hear him screaming, &quot;it can't be true, it
can't be true&quot;.  I think the big bore boy's often react the same way
to factual hunting exploits of people using small bores and of course
they do not want to believe it either

Thank you for blowing holes in your own theory. You say she was 'forced'
to use the 7x57. Well, duh. When forced, one makes do with what one has.
That doesn't make it the best tool for the job.

&gt;&gt;Shot placement, bullet construction, penetration capabilities of
loading.  This is more important than just &quot;caliber&quot;.

Ill add &quot;shock factor to system&quot; to that.

Who again exactly are these big-bore myth creators? and more
importantly, when exactly in time did they make these myths?
Did they start hunting in the dawn of smokeless powder? Before bullet
technology developed with the hunters needs?

I killed a cow once for my uncle with one clean .22lr hole in the head
from about 3 feet.  Same as he had done before. Therefore the .22lr is
a suitable cow bullet.

The next fall, he had me shoot another one the same way, and this time
the animal kicked and bucked horribly. He calmed it down the best he
could, and had me shoot it again, it bucked and kicked and carried on
even worse.  My uncle took the revolver, and looked at it, looked at
me and shot the cow the third time, and it still didn't die.  The same
gun, same box of bullets. The animal was too excited at this point to
try again for a good while.  I had had enough at this point. The
animal was put down later that morning with another shot.
Since the animal died, desired effect accomplished,  is the .22lr
still then a suitable cow bullet?  Or does it just work ok many times?
Is &quot;ok many times&quot; good enough for hunting?  Good enough for hunting
dangerous game?  If I had had a bigger bore .38, or .44spl would it
have worked better in that situation?
I was probably 12 years old then, and will never ever forget that.
What happened? Thicker harder bone in the skull of that particular,
much older cow.

The whole point of hunting responsibly, is trying your best to insure
a quick humane kill.  Period. That includes choosing a cartridge and
shooting/hunting ethic, that together, covers all or as many negative
scenarios as possible. Choosing a caliber, that is minimal at best for
a given game species is not a good ethic.  It is not &quot;trick shooting&quot;
either. It is pushing the luck of the hunter, his fellow hunters, and
the humane death of the intended animal.

What is minimal?  Does the projectile have the capability to penetrate
to the vital areas of the given game, from all angles? Some angles?
head shots?

Ive seen elephants dropped with one NATO round in the base of the
skull, from a helicopter.  Ive seen footage of other elephants,
absorbing 30 or more of the same rounds before dying later from blood
loss and shock.  If you are simply talking &quot;killing&quot; of an animal,
well yes the animals were killed.  If you are trying to say these
types of calibers are suitable for hunting, because they have &quot;killed&quot;
certain animals, well there is the problem.  You are not a hunter.
You are confusing just &quot;killing&quot; with the humane death intended by
ethical hunting.

Also, it doesn't matter what anyone SAID they killed an animal with.
How many did they NOT mention, that had to be put down later, or were
never recovered and died miserably.  How many thrashed some poor
native gun toter to death.  Oh, of course they ONLY had excellent
luck, because they WANTED to sell books and be known as great
hunters.

Much clearer now that the set back part has been explictly mentioned.
At first reading it sounded like just a rechamber which would leave
the throat unchanged.

I use my 30.06 for hunting deer and elk, not too much impact energy to
ruin meat on smaller game, and enough to get the job done on larger.
I also hand load for the specifics of what I'm hunting so that I know
I'll have the proper load to do the job.  Another thing, I don't take
much stock from stories (and thats what they all are), I go by what I
know works, and what is affordable to me.  When I can afford to take
an African hunting trip (and I probably never will), then I'll worry
about what to bring.

I personally want to thank browninglopowertheyahoo for presenting the
group with such consistent idiocy and ignorance that stimulates such
lively discussion about how clueless he is.

One might think he does it on purpose, a devil's advocate of a sort.

But probably not.

In the case of lion / elephant / buffalo  hunters, a quick, clean kill
is not only sporting, it helps you survive so you can write about it.

My new issue of Rifle magazine finally arrived so I got to read John
Barsness' article for myself.  The other hunters were just hunters,
not writers, and the article gives no reason to assume they didn't
paid their own way.  With regard to the rifles used Barsness has
always been very reasonable about recommending sensible cartridges,
good bullets, and careful placement as the key to success, so his tone
was not one of surprise.  As for this being a million dollar hunt
let's do a little math.  If the trophy fee for each of the 181 animals
taken had been $1000 each then the total would have been a $181,000.
But the smaller antelope and warthog don't usually cost anywhere near
that much, and many of the animals taken were on cull, so the fees
would have been much less.  Let's assume $1500 each for airfare ($1500
x 17 = $25,500) and a $300 daily fee for each hunter only one of whom
was there for both week long hunts 18 x 7 x $300 = $37,800).  That
comes to $244,300, which, split 17 ways comes to about ten animals and
$14,370 per hunter, at most.  Where I come from that's called a
bargain.  Hunting in Africa is great fun.  Every serious hunter should
try it, before it's too late.

One point that was not discussed is that when a vital organ is hit it
shuts down.  Now does it matter if it shuts down because it was
destroyed by a small bore or large bore.  Of course not, but this
concept is not ever accepted by the big bore boys.  They will solemnly
tell you that the big bore kills quicker and kills with a poorly
placed shot and has much more knock down power.  Strange that for the
big bore boys the laws of physics always change according to their
current mythical beliefs.  Facts are that a bullet that weighs many
times less than a big animal is physically not capable of knocking the
heavier than itself animal down at all.  Yes, they may appear to be
blown off their feet when the body collapses as when the spin or head
is hit but they are in  no way actually blown off their feet by the
bullet itself, as they are simply falling down because of instant
incapacitation, just as when a person faints.  The medicine a sick
person takes may  cause a person to fall down but the medicine they
swallowed did not blow them off their feet either.

Several years ago a very tragic event took place in Cleveland, Ohio.
A church group was picking fruit in an orchard when some scum bags
drove by and opened fire on the group for a thrill killing.   They
shot a young boy with nothing more than a .177 cal. High power pellet
rifle.  The victim fell dead on the spot.  The whole point of this is
that the boy would not have been any deader if the scum bags had used
an elephant gun to shoot him with instead of a .177 cal. Pellet
rifle.  He would have expired irregardless of the caliber.  This of
course does not fit in with the &quot;big bore&quot; philosophy, but dead people
are irrefutable proof of the extreme deadliness even of small caliber
weapons.  We may not like the laws of some other countries like Great
Britain that even regulates the velocity of a pellet gun to be legal
but they are right when they label it a deadly weapon, as dead bodies
prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.  This is not to say I want the
same laws here in the U.S., I do not, but their law was not without
reason either.

Roy Weatherby to prove a point once shot a charging African Buffalo
dead on the spot with nothing more than a 243 Weatherby.  Still the
&quot;big bore boys&quot; called it a trick shot, a fluke,  or a luck shot.  It
really would not have mattered how many times Roy did it as people
will believe what they want to believe and as they say &quot;please do not
confuse me with the facts as I have already made up my mind&quot;.

For those of you  old enough to remember, down through the past, many,
gun writers have repeated the story of how high velocity calibers,
especially those of .22 caliber should be outlawed for hunting as they
only leave terrible surface wounds which result in lingering deaths
for game animals.  Never mind that P.O. Ackely found that the .220
Swift killed 600 pound mules better than the bigger calibers he used.
Many years ago at the beginning of the 20th century the old .22 Savage
High Power with long heavy bullets was used all over the world for big
game hunting, something the gun writers tend to sweep under the rug
and try to forget as it does not fit in with &quot;standard bullistic
mythology&quot;.  The fact that the .22 Savage High Power was even used to
kill Grizzly Bears is something that the gun writers only speak of in
&quot;hushed tones&quot; behind heavily locked doors as it would be &quot;politically
incorrect&quot; to speak publicly about such facts.

I  have personally witnessed white tall deer shot with the .223 Rem.
with fmj bullets run no farther than when hit with the 30-06 before
expiring.   So you see that when one of the other posters  seemed to
think that it was totally inhumane to use &quot;less than an optimum
caliber&quot; for the job, he may not have really have had any experience
with such calibers.  I have and have found that when the bullet is
placed properly and it penetrates deep enough and it destroys a vital
organ the result is lethal even if it is small bore, and it is just as
lethal as when an animal is hit with a big bore gun.  This the big
bore boys can never accept no matter how many dead animals you pile up
on their front porch.

The simple conclusion is that if you use the wrong bullet i.e not
enough penetration or place your shot badly the caliber is irrelevant
as both the small bore and the big bore will fail under such
circumstances or will succeed if the above criteria is met.  This is
where the &quot;big bore boys&quot; and I disagree.

I think one of the most dramatic videos you can watch that totally
refutes the &quot;bigger is better myth&quot; is the movie called &quot;IN THE BLOOD&quot;
which is a movie about Teddy Roosevelt's Great Grand Son going to
Africa and shooting a Cape Buffalo&quot; with Teddy's actual double barrel
elephant rifle that he himself took to  Africa many , decades ago.  In
the movie the boy shoots a buffalo not once but twice with two well
place shots and at close range.  The Buffalo simply takes off running
a good 25 yards and after realizing he is mortally wounded slowly sits
down and dies.  Now if the Buff had run in the other direction which
would have been at the shooter the story may have had a very unhappy
ending as this elephant rifle despite having put two big rounds right
into the boiler room of the Buff did not blow the buffalo off his
feet, did not spin him around like a top and did not make him
disappear in a red puff of mist.  Now the moral of the story is if the
boy had used say a 7x57 Mauser instead of the .450 double there would
have been a great &quot;hue and cry&quot; shouted by the &quot;big bore boys'
saying , &quot;see I told you so&quot; and they would have postulated on how
&quot;worthless&quot; the small caliber was.  The fact that he used a &quot;big bore&quot;
and it failed is simply passed off with the standard excuse that &quot;the
Buff was one tough critter&quot; and this was not the fault of the big bore
caliber for not knocking the buff down instantaneously .  I think now
you can begin to see how twisted the logic is of the &quot;big bore boys&quot;.

It's quite possible to kill a moose with a 22LR. Do you think the 22LR
should be a legal caliber for moose hunting?

Just because something HAS worked or CAN work doesn't mean it should be
considered the standard. There are a lot of&quot;if&quot;'s in one of those
sentences. IF the bullet penetrates...IF the bullet is placed
properly...IF it destroys a vital organ. What if it is placed properly
but doesn't penetrate? You have to string together a bunch of IF's to
make this equation work.

Don't get me wrong: I'm not a magnum guy at all. My deer rifle is a 270,
and I would use the same rifle to hunt anything on the continent with no
hesitation. I understand your point about the big bore proponents and
the idea of overkill...but there's such a thing as underkill as well.
Just because you CAN kill a bear with a 22 CF round doesn't mean you
SHOULD.

Just my $.02

Many years ago, at our local (free public) library, I came upon a book
by Jack O'Connor. One passage which has stuck-out in my mind, all these
years later (esp with relevence to your above), is (paraphrase, but
essentially a quote):

&quot;For perhaps a half-hour or so, a friend of mine and I, danced-around a
severely annoyed Cape Buffalo, which continued to move about, despite
having 13 of our .375 H &amp; H magnums slugs gone in, none placed at just
the right angle.&quot;

I've always remembered that bit of text.

Once again you are arguing with yourself. The &quot;big bore boys&quot; are
figments of your imagination and the straw arguments you delight in
&quot;refuting&quot; are yours. No one in his right mind has ever said that a
bullet over 30 caliber would &quot; blow the buffalo off his feet, ... spin
him around like a top or make him disappear in a red puff of mist. &quot;.
YOU said that.

A crucial concept that you seem determined not to grasp is that
judging caliber / bullet effectiveness is a question of *percentages*.
A small caliber bullet might bring about a quick kill *sometimes*, but
a larger one will do it a greater percentage of the time. Comparing a
single kill to another single kill means NOTHING.

I don't recall any African hunters who use 220 Swifts with FMJ bullets
on buffalo, but according to your arguments it should be just the
ticket. Perhaps you should go to Africa and try it.

Really?? If that were true then anyone or anything that has ever been
wounded in a vital organ would be dead. Guess we don't need doctors or
vets anymore huh?? Please stop making such sweeping statements. You're
credibility has already been seriously damaged by the fact the other

# That last statement is so ridiculous it's hard to type without laughing. Have you ever shot something like a coyote with a caliber as lowly as the 7.62x39mm FMJ hitting it broadside?? Watch what happens! The animal will go flat down on it's opposite side like it had been run over. I don't think it learned to fall like that in Judo class!
Do you not know anything about external ballistics such as the energy
of a projectile like foot pounds of energy on a target or the pressure
waves in front of and behind said projectile and it's effects??
You're trying to compare the effects of bullet energy and a drop in
blood pressure due to sudden blood loss as one in the same thing...get
a clue please??

Having never hunted &quot;Big Game&quot; I can only agree with this based on
shooting Water Mellons and 1 gallon cans of Pork/Beans.

In shooting a large water mellon, we found the following:

22LR - small entry hole, small exit hole - this is very repeatable, exit
hole is about 1&quot; in size - never tips the mellon over.

50 Cal Black Powder Rifle - breaks the mellon into large peaces - easy
to identify all parts, could even put it back together (meaining that
all the parts were there). Parts mostly within 5 feet.

M1 - scattered the mellon in small pieces, but you could still tell it
was a mellon. Parts scattered about 10 feet.

12g Shotgun, Slug - Not much to identify, mess all over the place, most
impressive.

7mm Rem Mag - Nosler 150g Ballistic Tip - 50 Foot spray of mellon, no
parts left, no way to tell it was even a mellon, just a pink mist
everywhere. This was the most impressive shot we did - nothing left, not
a single part that we could tell was a mellon. The scatter was mostly
left, up, right, little went to the back.

We shot a 1g can of pork and beans - metal plate above/below with
concrete plates above/below the can to hold it in place. We only did
this with the 7mm Rem Mag, what a mess - same as the Mellon with the 7,
not a solid bean anywhere, can split in 1 or 2 places, sometimes the can
would split top/bottom other than the seam, top/bottom lid always
separated.

While the mellon is not an animal charging me, I would say that I would
want something like a 7 instead of a 22 to hunt with where I wanted to
KILL the animal quickly - I don't mean quickly with a perfectly placed
shot, I mean quickly if I'm not perfectly on target. I would think that
the 7 vs 22 would show that the 7 is the clear winner in power delivery
and destruction of the most area of impact.

What if you miss with a 22 and hit a leg, do you really think that a 22
would bring the animal down, or would the 7mm take its lef off or at
least damage enough that it's now a useless leg?

Yea, I shoot a 22WMR and a .17HMR for fun and at very small game, but if
I was going into the field to shoot anything that I though could kill
me, I would never consider those and would take the 7mm with me. I would
also have to say that the 7 (or 300) would be more accurate at a longer
distance than the smaller rounds, giving me a better kill chance than
with the 22.

So, even if I could kill an elephant with a 22 with a perfectly placed
shot at 100 yards, I'm not about to trust that I can make that shot on a
charging animal and I'm going to go with something that imparts more
power on impact in case I'm off a little in shot placement - not to
mention the better selection of bullets for the 7/300 vs 22LR.

You are incorrect on two counts, BHP.  Firstly, the law here which
'regulates' air guns is not based on velocity but kinetic energy.  You
are confusing the statutory 12ft-lb threshold for an air rifle (note an
air rifle, the law here does not recognise the term 'pellet gun') above
which a firearm certificate is required with the velocity thresholds
that some other countries apply.

Secondly, the law here does not 'regulate' whether an air gun is or is
not lethal: that is a matter of fact for a Court to decide on a case by
case basis.  There are, however, working rules of thumb that are
applied.  For example, air guns that delivered much less than 12ft-lbs
KE, and therefore were not subject to firearm certification procedures
(i.e. can be freely possessed by adults), are known to have caused
fatalities.  If an air gun is evidence in a case and on testing it is
capable of delivering KE or velocities known to have caused fatalities,
then is it considered to have lethal potential.  I'm not going to
explain what 'lethal' means under English law but refer anyone
interested to the test case known as Moore v Gooderham.

You don't like the 'big bores'.  Fine, no one is saying you have to.  No
one is trying to press on into your hands.  But you are becoming rather
tiresome.  You've made your point (i.e. expressed your prejudices long
and loud).  You aren't going to persuade anyone who, and no one is going
to persuade you.   Now, why don't you give it a rest?
