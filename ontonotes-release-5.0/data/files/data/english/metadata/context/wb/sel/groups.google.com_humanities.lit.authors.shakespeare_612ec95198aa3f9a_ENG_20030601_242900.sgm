Francis Bacon was created Viscount St. Alban on 3rd February 1621, shortly
after his sixtieth birthday. Thanking King James, Bacon told him that:-

This is now the eighth time that your Majesty hath raised me. the eighth
rise or reach, a diapason in music, even a good number and accord for a
close. And so I may without superstition be buried in St. Alban's habit or
vestment.

'The eight in music,' Bacon wrote elsewhere1, 'is the sweetest concord'; but
perhaps he had a premonition of what lay ahead, for he also noted that
'Swans are said at the approach of their own death to chant sweet melancholy
dirges'.2 Within a few weeks, without notice, he was falsely accused in
Parliament of taking bribes, impeached, stripped of his office and sentenced
to a crushing fine. Obeying the command of the King, as demanded by his
oath, Bacon did not defend himself but pleaded guilty to the empty charges.
In the notes of his interview with the King he refers to himself as being
both as innocent as any born upon St. Innocent's Day and an oblation or
sacrifice to his Majesty.

Interestingly the original St. Alban, who lived at Verulamium, had been
martyred by his Emperor. Bacon's country (and family) estate, Gorhambury,
stretched over the site of the Roman town of Verulamium, after which Bacon
had been given his first title, Baron Verulam of Verulam. But it was in
reference to the saint that Bacon was given his second, higher title, and
from that time on he commonly signed himself Francis St. Alban or Fr. St.
Alban. It was a unique title, referring to a person (saint) rather than a
place, and has profound implications.

St. Alban (Albanus), besides being reputed by the Church as the first
Christian martyr in Britain, is claimed by Freemasonry in their Legend of
the Craft as the founder of Freemasonry in England. He was reputedly born in
the 3rd century ad, in Hertfordshire, near Verulamium, went to Rome as a
young man where he served as a soldier under the Emperor Diocletian, and
then returned to Verulamium in the company of Amphibalus, a Christian, by
whom he was taught. When the persecution of Christians commenced, Amphibalus
was sought after but was helped to escape by Albanus, who donned his
preceptor's cloak and gave himself up to the soldiers instead. After being
imprisoned and tortured, Albanus' real identity was discovered. Amphibalus
was also found, and both suffered martyrdom for being Christians. The Abbey
church of St. Albans was later erected over the site where St. Alban's body
had been interred.

Freemasonry adds to this story. Its legend, collected from several sources
and embellished over the course of several centuries, declares that Masonry
flourished in Britain since before the time of the Druids, and that during
the Roman rule lodges and conventions were regularly held. However,
continual wars reduced Masonry to a low ebb. It was then that Masonry was
reintroduced into England by St. Amphibal, a Christian monk, and first
communicated to St. Alban, who was a knight.

The story goes that when Carausius revolted from the Roman Emperor
Maximilian and set himself up as the Emperor of Britain, he employed St.
Alban to environ the city of Verulam with a wall and to build for him a
splendid palace. To reward his diligence in executing these works, the
Emperor Carausius appointed St. Alban as Steward of his household and chief
ruler, after himself, of the realm. He also made St. Alban the paymaster and
Governor of the King's (Emperor's) works. Then, in order to make himself and
his government acceptable to the people of Britain, Carausius assumed the
character of a Mason and raised the Masons to the first rank as his
favourites, appointing St. Alban as the Principal Superintendent of their
assemblies. St. Alban gave the fraternity the Charges and Manners as St.
Amphibal had taught him (i.e. framed for them a constitution), assisted them
in making Masons, treated them with great kindness and increased their pay.
Later on, in the year AD 287, Carausius granted the Masons a charter and
commanded Albanus to preside over them as Grand Master.

According to the Masonic record, which until recently has been largely
accepted as historically accurate, St. Alban was martyred in the year AD
303. Modern scholarship, however, has convincingly shown that the historical
St. Alban was martyred on 22nd June 209 by Geta, eldest son of the Emperor
Severus, when they visited Britain AD 208-9. It is also clear that St. Alban
was certainly never a knight (knighthood was a chivalric honour invented
much later in history), nor the steward of an emperor's household and chief
ruler (after the emperor) of the realm, and that Amphibalus is a
personification of the ecclesiastical cloak, amphibalum, which St. Alban
donned (just as St. Veronica is a personification of Christ's true image
imprinted on the handkerchief which covered his face).

However, the strange elements of the story, when applied allegorically to
the later St. Alban-Viscount St. Alban-fit like a glove. Sir Francis Bacon
was a knight and he was also St. Alban-Viscount St. Alban, who wore the
cloak or 'vestment' (amphibalum) of St. Alban. He served a King, James
Stewart of Scotland, who was considered by many Englishmen to be a usurper
of the throne of England, and who was the first to bear the title of Emperor
of Great Britain. Lord St. Alban was his faithful 'steward' and proxy chief
ruler of the realm. The 'continual wars' which reduced Masonry to a low ebb
were the many centuries of foreign wars, the civil wars (romantically named
the Wars of the Roses) and religious persecution. Moreover, King James did
support the Masons in the manner described, and it was in his reign that
Freemasonry became established (or revived) in Britain. The 'palace' which
St. Alban (Bacon) built for him was a temple of learning, a temple of light,
constructed by Bacon's 'fraternity in learning and illumination':-

And surely, as nature createth brotherhood in families, and arts mechanical
contract brotherhoods in commonalities, and the anointment of God
superinduceth a brotherhood in kings and bishops; so in like manner there
cannot but be a fraternity in learning and illumination, relating to that
paternity which is attributed to God, who is called the Father of
illuminations or lights.

Francis Bacon, Advancement of Learning, Part 2 (1605).

I have held up a light in the obscurity of Philosophy, which will be seen
centuries after I am dead. It will be seen amidst the erection of tombs,
theatres, foundations, temples, of Orders and fraternities for nobility and
obedience - the establishment of good laws as an example to the world. For I
am not raising a capitol or pyramid to the pride of men, but laying a
foundation in the human understanding for a holy temple after the model of
the world.

Francis Bacon, Advancement of Learning, Bk II.

Such a temple is a temple of the Holy Spirit, the 'house Sanctus Spiritus',
his method the 'perfect Method of all Arts', his Natural History the Librum
Naturae, and his fraternity in learning and illumination the 'Fraternity of
the Rosie Cross' mentioned in the famous Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis, or
Discovery of the Brotherhood of the most laudable Order of the Rosie Cross.
In his New Atlantis Bacon, who was called 'Solomon', calls his temple the
House of Solomon or College of the Six Days' Work (i.e. of Creation),
founded by Solamona (Solomon) and comprised of a society of
philosopher-priests whose badge is a red cross and who maintained a secrecy
or invisibility from the world at large. Robert Boyle, writing in 1646-7,
referred to the College as the 'Invisible College' or 'Philosophical College
'.

According to the Freemason's Guide and Compendium, the modern history of
English Freemasonry starts with the record of Elias Ashmole's admittance
into Freemasonry in 1646, although it is recognised that speculative as well
as operative Freemasonry existed in England long before this. Moreover,
artefacts exist showing that the Royal Arch Degree as well as the basic
Craft Degrees existed in the time of Queen Elizabeth I.

The legendary dates of St. Alban, given so precisely as if factual, are part
of the allegory. In the Kaye Cipher 287 = Fra. Rosi Crosse. The mythical
year of 303 is likewise a cipher, which reduces to 33 since 0 is
traditionally counted as a null. In Simple Cipher 33 = Bacon. The number is
also the count of the word 'Free', the meaning of 'Francis', as well as
signifying the Thirty-Third degree of initiation. (See FBRT essay on
'Ciphers'.)

The Shakespeare plays, besides being authored by Francis Bacon and signed
with the above two cipher signatures, are full of Masonic symbolism,
meanings and words. The founding (or refounding) of the Grand Lodge of
Freemasons took place in 1716, the centenary of the actor William Shakspere'
s death. In 1723, the centenary of the publication of the Shakespeare Folio
of plays, modern Freemasonry emerged into the open with the publication of
The Book of Constitutions of the Free-masons. Also in the same year was
published the Benson Medley edition of Shakespeare's Sonnets, the title page
headpiece of which depicts the symbols of the higher degrees of Freemasonry.
100 is the cabalistic cipher of 'Francis Bacon'.
