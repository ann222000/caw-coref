* Â &quot;I don't believe in Atheists!&quot;
* &quot;Interesting. So when you die, nothing happens? You just
decompose and that's it? I'll bet whoever came up with that one is
just rolling in cash.&quot;
* &quot;I was an atheist for a while. No, seriously, quit laughing! It
was while that show 'Mork and Mindy' was on. I figured if something
like that could exist, then I probably shouldn't.&quot;
* &quot;People seem to think atheism is this huge problem that has to
be dealt with before anything else gets dealt with. It's actually
around Number 79 on My list, just below Ending the Scourge of Chronic
Sinus Infection.&quot;
* &quot;The truth is, I removed all my evidence of creating this world
so that the smarter guys wouldn't believe in me. And what were the
consequences? My Heaven only welcomes smart people. Those people will
believe in me when they meet me in person! That's what I gave them the
brains for, see? The last thing I need is a bunch of loony fanatics
wandering around up there, getting their nose hairs all over the
furniture.&quot;
* &quot;People sometimes say, 'Well, if there's a God, then why does he
let bad things happen in the world?' Folks, I'm busy. I've got
committees to chair, luncheons to plan; you don't think I'm the only
schmuck running one of these 'planet' things, do you? If you've got
problems with the way things are running down there, write your
Congressman, for God's sake. Hm? Oh, did I do it again? HA!&quot;
* &quot;All these different sects, cults, denominations,
quasi-denominations, schisms, independent churches, internal church
movements... All this confusion is actually good, because it distracts
all the atheists from the real truth, which is that I don't know what
the hell I'm doing.&quot;
* &quot;I know when you are sleeping, I know when you're awake. I know
if you've been bad or good... crap, there I go, confusing myself with
Santa Claus again! Seriously, though, I do know.&quot;
* &quot;They're right, actually. We know God can't exist, because it
says so in Richard Dawkin's books.&quot;
* &quot;I am an Atheist myself... I don't believe in other gods.&quot;
* &quot;Atheists who are dyslexic insomniacs lie awake at night
wondering if there really is a dog. That must be a bummer.&quot;
* If there's no god then who the fuck invented the female form eh?
You cant trust evolution to get nice tits, it just doesn't work.&quot;
