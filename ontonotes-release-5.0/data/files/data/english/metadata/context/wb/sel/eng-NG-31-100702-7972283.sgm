Contestors Converge on Toronto for First Ever National Convention

Toronto, Ontario - Up to 650 contestors are expected to attend the 1st
Annual National Contestors Convention (ANCC) www.contestconvention.com
being held at The Sheraton Centre in Toronto on September 21-23, 2007.
Attendees will participate in a range of activities including their
favourite activity - vying for prizes.

&quot;There is over $20,000 in prizes being given away, including three of
the four C's of contesting: computers, cash, cars and cruises, said
Richard Adams, Co-Director of the Canadian Contestors Association
(CCA). Major corporations have donated hundreds freebies and samples
for the show bags along with dozens of prizes to be won during the
session draws. With a maximum of 450 full weekend pass attendees and
200 Saturday day pass holders, the odds of winning are either 1 in 450
or 1 in 650 on Saturday.&quot;

In addition to the prizes, there are many other activities planned
including a diverse line-up of featured speakers. Attendees will find
out why companies run contests, learn how to avoid the hazards of
online contesting, and discover how the ancient oriental art of
placement, feng shui, can help improve your luck. Attendees can also
get their contesting questions answered by the experts at Q&amp;A sessions
following each presentation.

Further enhancing the experience will be the opportunity to meet the
&quot;rock stars&quot; of the contesting community. These leaders of the
contesting world are the owners of the most popular contesting
websites and newsletters in Canada including: Joe Head and Dave Larade
of www.contestcanada.com , Linda Horricks of www.contestgirl.com , Lori
Novak of www.canadiancontests.com and Sylvia Gold of www.winacontest.com .

&quot;There is nothing like the exhilarating energy of a big group of
contestors in one room&quot;, said Adams,. &quot;Especially, when they have a
bag full of freebies and are winning prizes. There is less screaming
at rock concerts!&quot;
