Here's a holiday treat for those who have speculated as to what I might
be growing in my back yard,  :-)

and for those who just like this sort of thing.

I have a wireless web cam attached to the back of my house that has pan
and tilt controls, so that it can be operated remotely. I live on the
edge of a canyon. You can't see the canyon because the camera isn't
mounted high enough, but you can see my entire back yard as well as the
trees and whatnot off in the distance. There's a fountain that attracts
a lot of birds, especially hummingbirds.

It only works in Internet Explorer 6 or above

http://76.88.36.240

This IP will probably only work for a day or so. When it says &quot;page not
found&quot; that means the IP has changed.

You have to have Active X enabled and download a custom control.
Go to
Tools, Internet Options, Security Settings, Custom Level

Turn on all the Active X crapola
Either &quot;Enable&quot; or &quot;Prompt&quot;

When IE says &quot;The publisher cannot be verified&quot; and asks you if it's ok
to download and install an Active X control you have to say yes
Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. The software installation is coming
directly from the camera. It's an Airlink101 AICAP650W. You can download
the manual online from Airlink101 and verify that for yourself if you
want to.

Not only is it perfectly safe, but I have no way of monitoring who is
watching the live feed or operating the camera controls. Those who
aren't willing to take my word for that can just do without.

Not to worry. There's nothing growing in my back yard that can't be
purchased at Home Depot. The only thing I have to worry about is not
walking in front of the camera when someone is looking.  ;-)

The birdies have flown the coop!

I watched them hatch from eggs, grow up and take their first steps out
of the nest. I missed their first flight, but it's nice to know that
they all survived. That's when I moved the camera to the back yard. I be
watching out next spring to see if the nest is occupied again.

Ah, it's not that nice.   :-)
Kinda small, actually. But it is nice to be on a canyon and also not
have a neighbor's two story house towering over my back yard. It's very
private and yet there's lots to look at. I can even see the mountains
way off in the distance, but they don't show up on the web cam because
the resolution isn't good enough.

You should see the hummingbirds fighting over the fountain. It gets
pretty intense sometimes, because they are very territorial.

My favorite birds are the red tail hawks that soar over the canyon. It's
amazing to me how they can hunt from so high up. How can they possibly
spot a rodent from that distance?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Which one?  :-)

All the way to the left (I've been told) is a Liquid Amber and
proceeding clockwise from there is a clump of three trees. I don't know
what they are, but my neighbors and my wife hates them because they drop
a lot of seeds that have to be swept up. I like 'em, because they
provide a lot of shade and also a good place to mount my two giant
staghorn ferns. That's what those two giant clumps are on the trunks of
those trees if you can't make them out.

Slightly to the right of center is a small pine tree that has been
trimmed to keep it short. Further to the right is another pine tree that
was recently trimmed to make a kind of &quot;V&quot; shape. And I have no idea
what the tree all the way to the right is, but it's a nice one.

As I was panning around just now I saw a squirrel sitting on the fence
eating a nut.  :-)

I'm happy to do so, though since I posted the IP here it appears that

Unfortunately the video is very choppy today and my internet access is
very slow. That means it's the network and not my setup, so hopefully
it'll be better soon.

Here are some tips for faster panning:
Use the presets
Click on the image and the camera will center on that spot.

It can be tricky to get Internet Explorer configured correctly, so I've
posted detailed instructions here:

It should not be this complicated and that's why I'm trying to find some
software that'll display the video on a web page without expecting
people to tinker with their browser settings.

How is it I KNEW youd use that web cam as yet ANOTHER reason to whine
about how victimized you are here?

Cmon, Kenny, NO ONE would be stupid enuf to post about a web cam here
and have it set up so it could be controlled by strangers to see any
thing about where they live if they were really the victim of a CRIMINAL
CONSPIRACY like you whine about being with sickening regularity here!
Give me a fuckin break!

And ya SAY that someones info cant be traced while using yer web cam and
the download is clean?  LOL Yeah, right.  After all, we all know how
truthful YOU are about so many things, huh?  Right Schwantz?

Cmon, Kenny, the world wants to know:  why would anyone who claims to be
the victim of CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY set up a web cam to give someone the
remote OPPORTUNITY to even TRY to see ANYTHING about where they live?
One of yer family could walk in front of it, including a minor child!
Cant explain that one, can ya?  At least not without looking really
stupid or like a HUGE liar or a bigger moron.

Oh, wait, I know!  You were doing out of the goodness of yer heart,
right?   After all, its not like we cant see birds, flowers anywhere
else!  Thats FAR more important then using common sense if yer truly the
victim of a criminal conspiracy!

Admit it, ya set the web cam up so you could make up these lies a few
days later and get some attention and mebbe get someone to believe
whatta victim ya are, thats why ya did it.  Youve been trying to get
someone to buy that bullshit for ages now.  Whatta perfect chance!  Pity
that no one in their right mind would set up a web cam to see any part
of their home, inside or out, if they were truly the victim of a
CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY--esp. posting to tell ppl about how to use it on the
very ng where you say the conspirators hang out!

Once again, ya want attention, and ya CREATED the circumstances to get
more of it, and then told yer story within a matter of days after
setting it up as &quot;look at my pretty birdies &amp; flowers!&quot;  and ya started
in about someone trying to stalk you visually or some kinda foolishness
like that.

Pity I didnt run a pool to see how long it took from the time ya posted
about the web came till ya claimed it was being used to watch you for
some nefarious purpose.  Im sure there wouldve been allot of money to be
made!

And dont forget, I dont need to see whatcha look like.  Yer pic got
posted on the usenetcowards.org website last year, and trust me, yer
nothing I care to look at ever again.  Remember, asshole?  Wait a
minute, my bad...that was yer face.  Easy mistake.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;What next?   Another 'flyer' show up in yer neighbors
&gt;&gt;mailboxes?

&gt; A reference to something else that this stalker was involved in
">

Yer a liar and ya know it.  C'mon, Kenny, PROVE IT! I dare ya. For ONCE,
why dontcha try doing something other then whining and making shit up.
Prove soemthing.  Be original for a change!  Show ppl that you can do
something other then bully and whine!

Wheres a fingerprint, a witness, ONE PIECE OF REAL PROOF other then &quot;Cuz
I say so&quot;....ANYTHING that would really tie me or Jill or anyone else to
even one of those fliers, if they really exist outside of yer own
computer.  You keep saying theres a crime...wheres the cops or the DA or
SOMEONE in authroity who is investigating it?  You surely know where to
send em to find Jill, if whatcha keep claiming is true.  Why dontcha put
up or shut up.  Either report her and have her investigated so she can
be cleared and you can stop posting lies about her here and on yer
website...so you can learn if someone else did it and harrass them
instead.

But the truth is, you dont WANT anything cleared up or to stop abusing
Jill and telling lies about her, cuz then what would you have to whine
about?  Trying to clear things up, if they are even real, would rob you
of the thrill you get out of trying (unsuccesfully) to fuck w/Jill thru
me.  Its obvious to everyone that youve never forgiven her for leaving
here before you got a chance to really tear her to shreds and thats why
you are so eager to call me Jill, so I can stand in as her proxy and you
can try to convince yerself that Im really her and you can pretend that
its just as fun.  But its not and ya know it.  Yer still aching for
payback cuz ya got thrown off yer ISP, and you blame Jill for it even
tho it was yer fault, huh Schwantz?

If the flyer is real and you believe Jill had a part in its creation or
distribution, why havent you had the cops talk to her????????  Why not
want to konw the truth and give her a chance to clear her name?  (dont
worry, its a retorical questtion)

Then again, everyone knows that if ya file a false police report yer
arse can get in some serious trouble.  Is that why  no cops have ever
shown up at Jills door or called or emailed her?  Hell, Ive even given
permission for Jill to give the cops MY contact info if they do contact
her over any of yer ranting accusations, cuz Im not Jill and I have
nothing to do w/any stupid flyer either.  So whats stopping you, Kenneth
W. Padgett?

Other then yer a pathetic liar, that is.

So man up or shut up!  Its sposed to be a &quot;CRIMINAL
CONSPIRACY&quot;!!!!!!!!!!!!  Youve used that phrase so many times in the
past year that I coulda sworn you were getting royalties for each time
ya posted it!

You claim its a big ole CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY and ya say ya know Jill is
part of it and what?  You cant even (or wont) get her questioned even
minimally or ANYTHING????????

No, instead of getting it investigated, you post a web cam that shows
where you live on the ng where these so called conspirators post and read!

Yer pathetic!

So odds are that yer just full of shit about the flyer, the criminal
conspiracy, and anyones involvement.  Otherwise, someone in this vast
conspiracy you have carried on about wouldve at least been QUESTIONED by
now and you wouldnt be giving ppl any kinda access to yer life thru a
webcam, cuz what if one of yer MINOR children walked in front of it?????

Mebbe next time youll think thru these stupid stunts first, cuz they are
making you look like a first class idjit.

You sure do remind me of a character in an episode of the original
Twilight Zone called &quot;Four O'Clock&quot;?  The main character in it is just
like ya, Kenny!

If ya dont remember the episode, let me remind ya.  A guy is at his
window looking out waiting for the stroke of four, cuz when it turns 4
o'clock, he believes all the 'little ppl' in the world really will turn
physically little, to match their small minds.  Well, 4 o'clock comes
and viola!  He was right!  All the ppl w/little minds turned physically
little!  The problem is, that HE is the only one whose body shrunk!
He's now about 1/3 of his former size, to match his small mind.  HE was
the only true 'little man', but his hate and malevolence left him blind
to the fact that it never was everyone else, just HIM that has such a
small mind, and now he also has a small body to match.

Yep, just like po lil Kenny.

And in yer case, Kenny, yer also the only kook here.  So be sure to
watch out for that parrot!

Bwahahahahahahahaha

Last but not least, lets not forget...its summertime, and anyone who has
spent any time hereknows that virtually every summer, lil Kenny Padgett
starts going into an intensely manic phase and it keeps escalating till
he gets so outta control that he ends up w/the cops at his door
repeatedly or his ISP gets disconnected for seriously violating the TOS.

Of course it wasnt!  After all, if YOU were whining endlessly about
being the victim of a &quot;criminal conspiracy&quot; for over a year, would you
then turn around and set up a webcam that shows yer property, that one
of yer children or spouse could walk in front of, and then post about
giving access to all in the very ng where the so called conspirators
post at?  OF COURSE YOU WOULDNT!

But I did ask lil Kenny in my last post exactly that question, and even
tho hes responded to seveeral posts here, he totally dodged that one
(and a few other good questions too).  Thats cuz theres no way to answer
it without looking like a liar or worse.  And what does he do anytime he
gets caught in a lie?  He ignores the questions about it like they arent
even there.  Its his usual behavior.

His silence screams volumes about his lies, his character and his motives.

Kenny posted that webcam so he could do exactly what hes done here.
Claim someones trying to spy on him.  Not so we could see the birdies
and trees.

Insane hatred of me makes for some strange bedfellows indeed.

http://kook.us/marilu-rudez.htm
&quot;The excessive amounts of opiates and benzodiazepines she regularly
consumes has always made her quite paranoid...&quot;

http://kook.us/marilu-rudez.htm
&quot;...Her anger at being scorned by me can apparently no longer be
contained and she has recently been attacking me publicly with such
absurd nonsense as her assertion that I'm a DEA double-agent who writes
reports on what transpires in the chronic pain group. &quot;

The only thing that surprises me about these latest ridiculous
assertions from the &quot;LC&quot; and &quot;Codeee&quot; Kooks is the total lack of
imagination that went into them. I mean, why stop at accusing me of
collecting IPs or
of setting up a web cam just so I could claim someone is obsessed with
me, when they could have &quot;gone all the way&quot; and falsely accused me of
installing a trojan horse or some other spyware on the computer of
anyone who uses the web cam?

Ah well, as has been previously noted on many occasions, these Kooks
aren't exactly brainiacs, but they do understand the standard troll
tactic of telling outrageous lies with the goal of getting their enemy
to refute their lies, which they then use as an opportunity to tell even
more outrageous lies.

You will of course note the incredible irony of the Loose Cannon Kook's
claims that I would be using a web cam in an attempt to prove to
everyone that there are people who are obsessed with me. LOLOL

I'm glad that some people are getting enjoyment out of using the web
cam. I posted the address here for the same reasons I try to help out
whenever I can. Reasonable people can understand that. Unreasonable
people who have an obsessive hatred of me will always see evil intent in
everything I do.

But gee, Kenny, thats EXACTLY whatcha do....did you forget that ya
posted all about it just a couple of weeks ago?:

&quot;Do you think that I don't know how to read server logs? For instance,
you friend Legend is actually the most frequent visitor to my site. IP:
69.114.86.16 has 174 hits so far, just in the month of June.
HaHaHaHa&quot;
Juba, Message-ID: &lt;11oe11.ce9.1 ... @news.alt.net&gt;

So you DO collect IP's cuz ya think ppl are obsessed w/ya!  And just
having the IP doesnt do ya any good!  You have to then go thru posts to
match em up w/the person!

Oops, I guess ya forgot about that.  Im sure with all those voices in
yer brain, its easy to forget all the lies ya tell.

when they could have &quot;gone all the way&quot; and falsely accused me of

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; installing a trojan horse or some other spyware on the computer of

I didnt make that accusation cuz I dont know it to be fact and I havent
even tried to find out one way or the other.  Therefore, I have no
proof, and unlike you, I dont post lies and call em facts!  But I
wouldnt put it past you to put a worm in the download, Kenny, cuz youve
got such a rich history of lying, forging others email addys, threats
and other sick and dangerous behavior over the years.  You putting a
worm into the web cam download so you can spy on those ya want so badly
to hurt isnt even a blip on the radar compared to so many of yer past acts!

But lets be honest here...try it, Kenny, ya might even like it....why
would ANYONE who screams that hes the victim of a &quot;CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY&quot;
for over a year now EVER put up a web cam and let ppl see ANY of his
property and risk having a family member walk in front of it, if he
truly believes there was even a small but real criminal conspiracy
directed against him?

HUH?

Curious minds are dying to know!   And its the 3rd time Ive asked, but
as usual, if ya cant answer the question without being made to loook
foolish, you just ignore it completely.

Yer silence to this repeated question is all we need to hear.

Gee, you sure do know allot about 'standard troll tactics', huh?  And we

No, not the web cam itself.  Just the concept of it.  Just putting it up
in a post gave you an automatic excuse to whine some more about how ppl
are obsessed w/you, when NO ONE who believed that ppl were obsessed
w/them would ever put up a web cam showing any part of their home and
ADVERTISE about it on the ng where the ppl he beleives are obsessed
w/him actually read!!!!!

Yeah, you help em out by making threats, divulging info about em and
telling em to give their retarded adult child a blow job, or other such
rich and intricate and disgusting things.

Yer list of victims is a long one Kenny.  So we know how ya help ppl
out.  You get em to trust you by sticking up for them in various ways,
then they confide in you, and once youve learned their secrets, you then
start manipulating them to do yer dirty work, and they usually comply
cuz they see what youve done to others, and when they finally break free
of yer grasp, you take all you learned about them and post it here,
prolly embellished tenfold, trying to hurt and humiliate them even
further.  You tell ppl that all that you'd originally defended them
aggainst was actually true all along, and in fact, you embellish that in
an attempt to hurt them more too.

And to make matters worse, you then try to make it seem like that these
women loved you and when you deprived them of yer company, they became
women scorned, willing to say or do ANYTHING to hurt you cuz they loved
you SO much  and you cut em off, kicked em to the curb.  Scraped them
off the bottom of yer shoe.

Get over yerself.

And THEN whatta ya do?  Ya  start quoting scripture.  Is Kenny the
Christian the next incarnation we're gonna have to endure of you?

Yeah, Kenny, we've all witnessed how you help ppl out.  Out of their
privacy.  You help them outta their ability to trust another person ever
again.  Yer version of help is what the rest of the world considers
hurting ppl.

And if by chance youve EVER done anything nice for someone, it was done
only to cultivate em so you can use em as yer next dupe.  Youve done it
to too many ppl now.  Someone would have to be out of their mind to
accept yer 'help' unless they wanna see THEIR secrets all over Usenet
after refusing to do yer dirty work later on.

Unreasonable

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

First of all, yer not evil.  Yer sick.  Twisted.  In serious need of
mental health intervention.  But evil implies you see yerself as
something above and beyond a normal human.  Yer not.  Yer just an
ordinary human being physically, with a twisted mind.  That doesnt
elevate you.  It lowers you.

And to see you as sick, one doesnt have to be unreasonable.  They just
have to know how to read.  They can read yer posts about someone telling
a woman to give a blow job to her retarded son and have her husband get
into the act with em.  They just have to read yer posts, cuz you lie and
lie and lie.  They just have to read the kinds of things you wrote to
someone whose name will be left otu of it. See yer sick posts that you
put up while forging someone elses email addy.  Yer list of sick acts is
really really long.  Theres pages of it, and thats just compiling yer
better known things.  There are hundreds &amp; hundreds of smaller, less
known nasties too, and prolly thousands more under yer myriad of other
sockpuppets. These arent acts of yer youth, but as recent as TODAY, in
the ppost I'm responding to even!   One doesnt post those kinds of sick
things and then turn around and become something so special that if
someone questions you or yer behavior, they are &quot;unreasonable&quot;.

Yer clearly starting to gear up into another manic phase.  Does yer
family have a bunker or a safe room set up for when ya start in like that?

Whatcha do THIS year once yer in full on crazy mode only remains to be
seen, but I guarantee you, it wont be evil.  It'll just be proof that
you need to be locked up, medicated and have all chances to hurting
another human being taken away from you.

I honestly believe that one day in yer manic phase, yer gonna seriously
physically hurt someone, or possibily even kill them, cuz every time yer
in one of these modes, yer behavior keeps getting worse till the fallout
from what yer doing literally forces you to stop, such as the cops being
brought to yer door repeatedly or yer ISP being turned off, cuz when yer
all worked up, ya clearly dont give a shit WHAT laws you have to break
to get the satisfaction you need, so a third party intervention has to
shut you down.

No, Kenny, I'm not unreasonable.  In fact, these are conclusions based
on reading some of the most disturbed thoughts Ive ever seen put into
writing--by you.

Even yer statement that anyone who doesnt like you or the way you act is
unreasonable is proof of yer mental health issues.

Yer not evil.  Yer just sick.  Thats not special, its just pathetic.

Its clear right now thatcha dont have anyone to do yer dirty work.
Theyve all jumped ship, and youve shown everyone what you do to those
who wont remain in yer control.  So go ahead and quote scripture all ya
want.  NO ONE is ever gonna be that dumb to fall for yer innocent act
again unless you once again change socks and move onto another unknowing
and unsuspecting ng and find a whole new audience to manipulate, cuz
thats the only way yer EVER gonna find anyone dumb enuf to fall for yer
shit again.
