I figure a few around here may be interested in this........in 1969, a
documentary filmmaker made a short film about a 4 year boy in the
Haight being raised by hippy parents. Apparently the film caused quite
a ruckas at the time. This film maker followed up 30 years later to
find out how the boy turned out, resulting in &quot;Following Sean&quot;.

This in on tonite in the Chicagoland area on PBS, featured on the POV
show.

I don't recall this documentary, but there was another one about a
little tyke who was snatched from his family cottage in Detroit and
raised in the panhandle of Golden Gate park by a mixed family/commune
of mules and aardvarks. They trained him to do various things to help
them get by. He would hawk The Berkeley Barb and The Oracle on the
corner of Haight and Masonic. Dip the pockets of tourists. sneak into
the apartments where dealers were capping acid and bagging grass to
grab what he could before he skipped out the fire escape. The little
tot was notorious. But the hippies couldn't stay mad at him, he was so
cute, begging for a miracle down at the Fillmore with his little soft
shoe dance and penny-whistle. He fell into bad company when he went on
tour with the Cowsills sometime around 1970 or so. The band took him
in, said he could earn his keep with a mop. The rest, as they say, is
history...
