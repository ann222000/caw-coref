Single and return tickets on the Metrolink are to increase by an average of
5.7% from 18 November.

Maybe it is to pay to repaint the trams in Stagecoach livery ??
Or more likely, because the cost of electricity keeps rising.?

A friend of mine lives in Bury and whenever i meet her in Manchester i ask
if she has travelled on the tram, each time she replies it is simply too
expensive.

Shame, they'd look a lot better than the current drab turquoise, black
and white.

It is, but it's also full to capacity at rush hour. Unless the money is
raised for more new trams, this will only get worse. That said, I think
the offpeak fare could be less, and even cheaper tickets which had an
afternoon peak exclusion would be a good idea too...

When I lived in Besses o' th' Barn, it was cheaper to take the bus into
the centre of Manchester, but the tram was much better in terms of time,
and reliability.
