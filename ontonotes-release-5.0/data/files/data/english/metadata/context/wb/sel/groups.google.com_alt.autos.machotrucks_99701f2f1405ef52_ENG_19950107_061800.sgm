--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------

Zero Flat tire enhancer actually helps prevent flat tires and extends
tire life.

The Revolutionary formula instantly seals punctures up to 1/4&quot; in
diameter, preventing air loss and resulting flats.

Made from a complex formula of chemicals, fibers, and liquids, Zero
Flat remains liquid for the life of the tire and rim installation. As the
tire rotates, centrifugal force spreads the solution evenly over the tread
area, side walls, and rim. When a puncture occurs, thousands of interlocking
fibers seal the opening to prevent air loss. Unlike aerosol tire treatments,
Zero Flat evenly coats the inside of the tire, its balance is not affected.

Zero Flat extends tire life by reducing heat build-up. The compound
boasts an extended tempature range of -50 degrees F to 366 degrees F. A
built-in rust inhibitor protects rims, valve stems, and steel belts. Because
slow leaks are sealed, Zero Flat prevents underinflation, resulting in longer
tire life and better gas milage. Zero Flat also helps maintain proper tire
pressure by blocking air valve leaks.

***** Zero Flat Installation is FAST &amp; EASY *****
Simply remove the valve core from the valve stem of the tire being treated.

Pump Zero Flat into the tire then inflate the tire to the required PSI.

This easy process takes about 10 minutes per car and effective for the
lifetime of the tire.
