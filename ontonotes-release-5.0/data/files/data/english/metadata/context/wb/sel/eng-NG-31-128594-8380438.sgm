Hi, not sure if it's too late but please feel free to use my pictures... they're
on http://photos.yahoo.com/kgalaski when you go to this page, it's the &quot;Costa
Rica 2007&quot; album, 187 photos. There were tons posted to the facebook page as
well over 400 I think, I can't seem to find that group now, was it closed??
Anyway, I hope this helps. I wish I could be one of the contributers because I
LOVE writing and I really enjoyed writing the journal, but since you have been
meeting in TO and I'm in Jamaica I haven't volunteered. If you need anything
reviewed electronically I'd be happy to do so, but I imagine the deadline is
fast approaching. I would love to read it anyway.

Kelly

&gt; &gt; &gt; Date:Fri, 27 Jul 2007 16:56:26 -0400I am unable to view the video on
&gt; these
&gt; &gt; days as I am not back in Ontario until August, but I won't be back in
&gt; &gt; Toronto until late August, so don't worry about including me.  I would like
&gt; &gt; to see it sometime but I trust that will be great!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks again Tristan for all of your hard work,

&gt; &gt; Dudes.... we need photos!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This Y-Magazine article is gonna
&gt; &gt; look pretty shady if we can't get some sweet photos together.  Lets all try
&gt; &gt; and throw a few pics into the mix.  The key is getting a bunch of good
&gt; &gt; action shots to pick from.  So far we really don't have much to work with.
&gt; &gt; So if everyone could send at least one or two photos to Howard, Ruwan, or
&gt; &gt; myself by Monday it would be much appreciated!!!

&gt; &gt; Please.... send us photos.  Good god please.

&gt; &gt; Ruwan offered to give everyone who submits a photo or two $600 cash.

&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance team!!!

&gt; &gt; On a side note, I think this article's gonna be pretty sweet!  Ruwan,
&gt; &gt; Laura and Emily have all made some awesome contributions!

&gt; My pics are on Facebook and as you can tell, most of my pics are
&gt; scenery and not much action (unless you count walking). But feel free
&gt; to take a gander and let me know if you like any.

&gt; MICHELLE WK :)
