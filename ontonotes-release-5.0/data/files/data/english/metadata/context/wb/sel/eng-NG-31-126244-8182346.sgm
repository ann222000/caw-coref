Because, the boycotters say, ¡§Israel¡¦s 40-year occupation has seriously
damaged the fabric of Palestinian society through annexation, illegal
settlement, collective punishment and restriction of movement,¡¨ that there
exists a ¡§complicity of Israeli academia in the occupation.¡¨
The British lecturers excoriated Israel because, as one of their complaints
went, Palestinian students were inconvenienced by security checkpoints as
they carried their books to school each morning. the ¡§sanctity¡¨ of the
college setting was forgotten when Palestinian Authority forces, believing
it was being used as a staging area for Hamas rocket launches, stormed the
17,000-student Islamic University in Gaza. The entire campus was set
ablaze -- destroying books in its library, gutting offices, classrooms and
the student center.

Apparently the concept of academic freedom had to be revoked here, since
virtually every leading figure of Hamas has taught or studied at Islamic
University.

So we are to be sold the israel is forced to be the shit government they are
, cannot clean up their act? R u fuled yet???
Or how to have christians assisting and supporting their own suppression?

Jews. All were Christians. Most of the generals in charge of these
anti-Christian pogroms were Jews. Stalin considered Jews to be the only

Strike Breaking
STRIKE BREAKING (AS REPORTED BY NYT AND OTHER AMERICAN PAPERS)

THE JERUSALEM POST CORRESPONDENT HIRSH GOODMAN  ¡V they have not received
any
terrorist training, nor are they members of a terrorist organization. Rather
they are
members of that Palestinian generation that grew up knowing nothing but
occupation

With anger, hatred, and sheer ferocity, thousands of youngsters hurled rocks
at their Israeli occupiers, undaunted by the gunfire that greeted them. This
was more than civil unrest. ...It was the beginning of a civil rebellion -
Dan Fisher, Los Angeles Times, December 20, 1987.
On that day, - wrote John Kifner in The New York Times, - the vast army of
Arab laborers who wait on tables, pick vegetables, haul garbage, lay brick
and perform virtually all Israel's menial work, stayed home.: John Kifner,
New York Times, December 22, 1987.

The Israeli response to the uprising was brutal. Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin ordered the use of tanks, armored vehicles and automatic rifles
against an unarmed population.

The San Francisco Examiner cited Rabin as openly advocating assassination.
&quot;They can shoot to hit leaders of disorder,&quot; Rabin said in defense of the
army's practice of using marksmen with high-powered .22-caliber rifles to
shoot indiscriminately at Palestinian youth. - San Francisco Examiner,
December 23, 1987.

Rabin ordered house-to-house searches, first for young men and later for
anyone of whom an example might be made. By December 27, over 2,500
Palestinians were seized, many of them as young as twelve; by the end of
January the number reached 4,000 and was rising.  The &quot;militants &quot;were
marked for deportation. Israeli high-security jails and detention centers
were overflowing. Mass trials of Palestinians were underway.

The act of brutality which most inflamed the Palestinian population was the
army seizure of the wounded from hospital beds. This practice, standard
procedure throughout the invasion of Lebanon in 1982, made Shifa Hospital in
Gaza a center of resistance. Great crowds amassed to defend the wounded,
whom, they rightfully feared, would never be seen again.

No fear of Jews standing up against cruelty and sadism as the Christians DID
again and again.

REMEMBER THIS IS AN UNARMED POPULATION UNDER OCCUPATION. -
http://www.mafhoum.com/press2/74P51.htm

A mother of a Palestinian man shot three times in the head by Israeli
soldiers was asked if she would let her remaining sons join the
demonstrations. &quot; As long as I am alive, &quot;she responded, &quot;I am going to
teach the young people to fight ... I don't care whatever happens, as long
as we get our land.&quot;  - John Kifner, New York Times, December 21, 1987.

&quot;They entered the house like animals, shouting,&quot; the 22-year old student at
Bir Zeit University said. &quot;They took us from the house, kicking us in the
head, beating us, all the soldiers with their rifle butts.&quot;Two others, he
said, beat his hands with lengths of two-by-fours, breaking the bones.

The first priority is to use force, might, beatings. [This] is considered
more effective than detention ... [because] he may then resume stoning
soldiers. But if troops break his hand, he won't be able to throw stones. -
New York Times, January 21, 1988.

AGAINST AN UNARMED CIVILIAN POPULATION.

No matter which house one calls, the anguished accounts of family members
wounded or arrested pour forth. Convoys of buses cruise the streets of
Nablus followed by vans of the Mossad, Israel's secret police. Army units go
from house to house pulling youths from their beds at 3 a.m. As the buses
fill, the soldiers beat the youths viciously around the head, shins, groin
and back. Shrieks fill the air.

AGAINST AN UNARMED CIVILIAN POPULATION.

By April 1988 over 150 Palestinians had died. The Israeli government had
admitted to the arrest of 2,000 people, bringing the acknowledged total to
4,000. The real figure was far higher.

Sources in the West Bank and Gaza established that the number detained by
the weekend of March 27 had exceeded 13,000. Bassam Shaka'a, deposed Mayor
of Nablus, placed the total held solely in a hastily constructed barbed-wire
encampment at Dhariyah at 10,000.

In the Balata camp outside Nablus, and in the Casbah - the old quarter -
l, 000 people were arrested in a period of 48 hours. The discovery of people
in ditches in the fields - shot in the back or with their heads caved in -
has been reported from villages throughout the West Bank and Gaza

TWO OF THE CHILDREN, AGES 9 AND 11 , WERE TAKEN BY THE SOLDIERS IN THEIR
night clothes, frog-marched in the streets and beaten as they were forced by
the jeering soldiers to clear debris.

NEW YORK TIMES
Fleets of helicopters fly over Nablus at night dropping a dense, green toxic
gas over the city. The smell pervades every house. Armed units fire
canisters of the substance into houses at random. Doctors at Ittihad
Hospital reported several deaths and severe lung injuries from this as-yet
unidentified asphyxiating chemical, totally distinct from tear gas.

Among the victims was the grandmother of the Da'as family and the
100-year-old father of noted Nablus attorney Mohammad Irshaid. Soldiers had
entered the house at 2 a.m., smashing furniture and firing a canister of the
dreaded green gas while preventing the family from leaving.

Simultaneously, the Israeli army targeted the hospitals. Army trucks rammed
ambulances and blocked them from reaching the homes of those overcome by the
gas. Soldiers entered the Ittihad Hospital in Nablus numerous times,
arresting the wounded and those waiting to give blood to family members.
EVEN THE OPERATING THEATRE WAS INVADED WHILE SURGEONS WERE OPERATING ON
PATIENTS.

DOCTORS WERE BEATEN AND EQUIPMENT SMASHED. FAMILY MEMBERS WERE PREVENTED
FROM ENTERING THE HOSPITAL AND THE CARS OF DOCTORS AND NURSES WERE DESTROYED
BY SOLDIERS.

Meanwhile, all of Nablus was paralysed by a total strike. All the streets in
every quarter of the city were without open shops or business activity. As
gas permeated the city, cries and chants filled the night.

Gas canisters recovered by Bassam Shaka'a, Yousef al-Masri [chief of Ittihad
Hospital] and American author Alfred Lilienthal bear the markings &quot;560 cs.
Federal Lab. Saltsburg, Pa. USA MK2 1988.&quot; Biochemists are studying their
properties as casualties mount.

JOHN KIFNER reported on April 4 that &quot;Hundreds of refugees were treated in
United Nations clinics for gas inhalation.&quot; On April 15, Kifner wrote,
&quot;...gas has been thrown inside homes, clinics and schools where the effects
are particularly severe.&quot;

This is still going on today, just cleverly concealed with active
participation of western democracies governments, western democracies
religious institions and western democracies media.

Apparently only the ungodly unreligious students find their conscience  so
stirred that they have gone to the oppressed citizens aid with the following
results.

By Gideon Levy

At 6 A.M. the shepherd girl wakes up, grabs a bite to eat,
readies the sheep and heads for the pasture, together with her grandmother
and her cousin. Two hours from Tel Aviv, 2,000 years from Tel Aviv, there
are two tents in the middle of nowhere, made out of old bags of plaster, a
family of horses, a makeshift sheep pen and a water tank. Every morning the
three shepherds - the grandmother, Fadiya Anami, 60, the cousin, Salama
Anami, 12, and Hanan Anami, also 12 - take the sheep out to the pasture,
which is near the tent. Salama and Hanan no longer go to school in the
unrecognized Bedouin village of the Abu Krinat tribe in the Dimona area,
which is far from the pasture.

Last Wednesday the three shepherds set out as usual. In the
winter months they take their animals farther north and west, near Kibbutz
Tze'elim and the adjacent army training base, where the grass is greener.
They say they have permission from the Agriculture Ministry. They pitch
tents and remain until summer, when the grass withers. A man from the tribe
brings supplies. They spend their days and nights between the pasture and
the tent, without electricity or running water - without anything. A
grandmother and two granddaughters, with a few herding dogs watching over
them and the flock of 120 sheep.

Last Wednesday began like any other day. The sheep fed on the
grass, now abundant, and the three shepherds sat a few hundred meters from
each other. The field of blooming squill was crowded with flocks herded by
Bedouin.

Advertisement

On the ridge opposite stood, as usual, a row of camels. We saw
them last Sunday when we visited the site with Abed Anami, Hanan's uncle and
Salama's father. Abed Anami, 38, comes occasionally to visit his mother,
daughter and niece. His brother, Yusuf, Hanan's father, also comes
occasionally, as he did last Wednesday. As Yusuf made his way to the tents
that day, a neighbor who passed him on the road flashed his lights, and
called out: &quot;Your daughter Hanan was wounded in the head.&quot;

The road to Tze'elim is littered with yellow warning signs
mounted on concrete cubes - &quot;Danger, firing zone&quot; - in three languages,
along with the terrifying image of a skull. But on the descent from the road
after the Basor wadi there are no signs, only a warning to bicycle riders
coming from the north about the road.

We followed the blue Subaru until it suddenly stopped. Abed
emerged from the car, followed by &quot;the old woman,&quot; as he called her, his
mother, Fadiya, covered from head to toe. We followed her until she abruptly
lay down on a mound of sand. Here, she said, in a whisper, Hanan fell.

It was about 3 P.M. last Wednesday, when Salama suddenly noticed
small objects falling on the sand and kicking up little clouds of dust.
Salama told her father later that she had no idea what they were; she had
never seen a volley of live bullets. A few minutes later she saw her cousin
Hanan slump to the ground, a hole in her head. In a panic she left
everything and ran to the tent camp, about three kilometers away, to summon
help.

In the meantime, other shepherds rushed to the wounded girl. She
was unconscious. They put her into a van and drove quickly to the main road.
Someone had called an ambulance, which picked up Hanan on the road. Yusuf
reached the ambulance while the medics were still treating his daughter. She
was seriously hurt. Yusuf says she looked &quot;almost dead.&quot;

Fadiya sits on the mound of earth, which is strewn with sheep
droppings, and is silent. A vulture circles overhead. Over the hill is the
Tze'elim army base, hidden from view. Between the main road and the earth
mound we couldn't find even one firing zone warning sign - either from the
direction of the road or near the tents. All we saw was a van of the &quot;Green
Patrol&quot; of the Israel Land Authority. Abed says that since the tragedy, the
Green Patrol has been warning shepherds not to approach the firing area.
Nevertheless, shepherds were there with their flocks on Sunday.

Under a spring-like sun, we followed the Subaru to Fadiya's two
tents. The lambs bleat in their pen, the dogs bark at the strangers and the
horses - mother, father, foal - are doing their thing. Suddenly a flock of
sheep appears, their full udders swinging to and fro, as is the bell hung on
the neck of one of them. The sheep make a mad rush for the pen; each knows
its offspring. The lambs rush to suckle. Only the noise of an Israel Air
Force plane overhead drowns out this desert cacophony, an earsplitting
chorus of sheep and agitated dogs.

On the way back, we pass the orchards of Kibbutz Tze'elim -
green, dense, cultivated, with a sophisticated irrigation system. &quot;I blame
the Israel Defense Forces for not warning us,&quot; says Abed.

Her swollen eyes shut, a kerchief on her head, her skin
pockmarked with white spots - a beautiful girl who lies in the neurosurgical
ward of Soroka Medical Center in Be'er Sheva, her parents by her side. Only
now, four days after the incident, did Yusuf Anami let his wife, Maryam,
visit their daughter. Before entering the room he cautioned her to be
strong. The kerchief covers a scar that splits Hanan's skull, which is held
together by metal pins. The couple have eight children; Hanan is the
firstborn.

Yusuf quotes eyewitnesses as saying that a great many bullets
were fired that day into the pasture area.

The IDF Spokesman's Unit issued the following response: &quot;Within
the framework of staff work that was done in regard to the firing zones, all
the zones in Israel were mapped and it was decided which can be entered and
which cannot. The Bedouin tribe to which the citizen belongs knows that
entry to this zone is forbidden. Additionally, a few months ago, following a
deliberate incursion into this zone, the Green Patrol removed the Bedouin
from the area by force. Metal signs in three languages (English, Arabic and
Hebrew), stating that entry is forbidden, have been placed at the entrance
to the zone.&quot;

Not a word of regret. Nor did the IDF think to send a
representative to visit the girl its soldiers wounded. A Bedouin activist,
who asked not to be identified for fear of being harmed told us this week:
&quot;It is not by chance that no one from the army has come to visit her and
support the family. Wouldn't a soldier who was wounded by accident be
visited? There was a mistake, and the IDF says the girl is to blame - let's
say - but not to visit her? That attests to a policy of abandonment. They
are abandoning the Bedouin. Everything here is deliberate. If the girl had
been in an educational framework, none of this would have happened. She
dropped out of school and no one cares.&quot;

It's not hard to guess what would happen if a girl from nearby
Kibbutz Tze'elim had been wounded by friendly fire. Says the father of &quot;the
citizen,&quot; as the IDF calls the girl: &quot;No one told us not to go out with the
sheep. There is no sign there. You didn't see any sign, so how could the
girl have seen one?&quot; Again, an examination by Haaretz this week found not
one IDF warning sign.

Yusuf has not budged from his daughter's bed. Now both parents
are in the room, staring at their sleeping daughter. When she arrived, her
chances of survival were &quot;less than 1 percent,&quot; says Dr. Vladimir Merkin,
the neurosurgeon who operated on her. &quot;The situation was critical, judging
by all the parameters. Statistically, her prospects of making it were even
worse. If a bullet passes one of the midlines of the skull, the chances are
1 percent, and in her the bullet passed two lines, meaning less than 1
percent.&quot;

The bullet entered Hanan's head from the direction of the ear
and stopped at the frontal lobe, where is will probably remain for all time.
Nevertheless, a miracle occurred and Hanan began to recover.

&quot;To our surprise, she is conscious, and after two days she
started to talk, even though the bullet passed through the part of the brain
that is responsible for speech. She has a weakness on the right side of her
body, but not paralysis,&quot; says the doctor, &quot;and that is very surprising. Her
eye was damaged, but it's too early to say for certain. The cognitive
functions may have been damaged, but it is too early to say for certain.&quot;

Christian homes being knocked down???
The new homes were built by a group of limited income Palestinian Christian
families who banded together as the Arab Orthodox Housing Project to build a
new life. They obtained a 99-year lease from their Church, the Greek
Orthodox Church, 22 years ago and then began the agonizing process of
organizing and saving enough money to start construction.

&quot;We were renters for 40 years,&quot; Dalal Awad, a mother of five told me. &quot;We

In a letter to the conference host, UNESCO Director-General Koichiro

encouraging intolerance  and   racism in our societies.&quot;

The SS was particularly enthusiastic in its support for Zionism. An
internal   June 1934 SS position paper urged active and wide-ranging support
for   Zionism by the government and the Party as the best way to encourage
emigration of Germany's Jews to Palestine.

The Jewish Agency delegation headed by Golda Meir (Meirson) ignored a
German
offer to allow Jews to emigrate to other countries for $250 a head, and
the
other Jewish groups  made no effort to influence the United States and the
32 other countries attending the conference to allow immigration of German
and Austrian Jews.

It's no secret that Zionism embraced political expediency to advance
the cause of carving Eretz-Israel from the land of its native
inhabitants. In his 1983 book, Zionism in the Age of the Dictators,
Lenni Brenner shows that 20th century Zionists observed shockingly few
limits to that expediency. Not surprisingly, the book received little
coverage in the American media.

Now, in 51 Documents, Brenner has compiled a wide variety of letters,
statements, articles, and judgements?some of which appeared in his
earlier  book?by a broad array of activists and authors, that documents
Zionist
cooperration with the Nazis.

On the face of it, the notion seems absurd. However, Brenner
presents the case?made in many Zionists? own words?that the Nazi
agenda of expelling the Jews from Germany fit nicely with the Zionist
PLAN FOR ENTICING THOSE JEWS INTO SETTLING IN PALESTINE AND CREATING A
NEW JEWISH NATION.

In addition to introductory and concluding chapters, the book is
organized into five sections which lead the reader through early,
pre-Zionist documents; pre-Holocaust ideological factions; the
Holocaust era itself; and a chapter on the Stern Gang and the Nazis.

Readers should note that a few documents are not indicative of
collaboration in and of themselves, but provide the background to
others written in response.

These latter do indicate levels of collaboration between Zionists and
fascists, both the Nazis in Germany, and those in Mussolini's Italy.
Brenner's brief explanatory notes at the beginning of each document
are helpful, as are the glossary and index.

51 Documents assumes a certain knowledge of Zionist history, and
requires a close reading and some deconstructive efforts on the part
of the reader. Those willing to commit the time and effort, however,
are rewarded with some stunning revelations. The reason some Zionists
eschewed the boycott against Hitler?s Germany, for instance, is that
http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-060706mideast,1,7895295....
oll=chi-news-hed&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true
they had a financial deal?Ha'avara?with Germany allowing Jews to
exchange their wealth for goods to be exported to Palestine at less of
a loss, as an incentive to emigrate. Those wondering why Zionists
today are so organized and experienced in their public relations
efforts discover that these battles have been fought before. Moreover,
the section on Nazi and Zionist understandings of 'nationality' versus
citizenship reveals how German and Israeli practices are based on the
same concept.

51 Documents also sheds a whole new light on the term Holocaust
guilt, frequently understood to mean Western, non-Jewish guilt for
not acting against the Holocaust earlier. However, these documents
make it clear that Holocaust guilt began with those Zionists who made
the undoubtedly difficult, but politically expedient choice to place
Eretz-Israel at the top of their priorities, above the lives of their
threatened European brethren.

From a Zionist Executive Meeting speech by Yitzhak Gruenbaum on Feb.
18, 1943:

And when some asked me: Can't you give money from Keren Ha Yesod
(Palestine Foundation Fund) to save Jews in the Diaspora? I said:
?No!  And again I say no....And, because of these things, people
called me an anti-Semite, and concluded that I'm guilty, for the fact
that we don't give ourselves completely to rescue actions.(p. 211)

Strike Breaking
STRIKE BREAKING (AS REPORTED BY NYT AND OTHER AMERICAN PAPERS)

THE JERUSALEM POST CORRESPONDENT HIRSH GOODMAN  ¡V they have not received
any
terrorist training, nor are they members of a terrorist organization. Rather
they are
members of that Palestinian generation that grew up knowing nothing but
occupation

With anger, hatred, and sheer ferocity, thousands of youngsters hurled rocks
at their Israeli occupiers, undaunted by the gunfire that greeted them. This
was more than civil unrest. ...It was the beginning of a civil rebellion -
Dan Fisher, Los Angeles Times, December 20, 1987.
On that day, - wrote John Kifner in The New York Times, - the vast army of
Arab laborers who wait on tables, pick vegetables, haul garbage, lay brick
and perform virtually all Israel's menial work, stayed home.: John Kifner,
New York Times, December 22, 1987.

The Israeli response to the uprising was brutal. Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin ordered the use of tanks, armored vehicles and automatic rifles
against an unarmed population.

The San Francisco Examiner cited Rabin as openly advocating assassination.
&quot;They can shoot to hit leaders of disorder,&quot; Rabin said in defense of the
army's practice of using marksmen with high-powered .22-caliber rifles to
shoot indiscriminately at Palestinian youth. - San Francisco Examiner,
December 23, 1987.

Rabin ordered house-to-house searches, first for young men and later for
anyone of whom an example might be made. By December 27, over 2,500
Palestinians were seized, many of them as young as twelve; by the end of
January the number reached 4,000 and was rising.  The &quot;militants &quot;were
marked for deportation. Israeli high-security jails and detention centers
were overflowing. Mass trials of Palestinians were underway.

The act of brutality which most inflamed the Palestinian population was the
army seizure of the wounded from hospital beds. This practice, standard
procedure throughout the invasion of Lebanon in 1982, made Shifa Hospital in
Gaza a center of resistance. Great crowds amassed to defend the wounded,
whom, they rightfully feared, would never be seen again.

No fear of Jews standing up against cruelty and sadism as the Christians DID
again and again.

A mother of a Palestinian man shot three times in the head by Israeli
soldiers was asked if she would let her remaining sons join the
demonstrations. &quot; As long as I am alive, &quot;she responded, &quot;I am going to
teach the young people to fight ... I don't care whatever happens, as long
as we get our land.&quot;  - John Kifner, New York Times, December 21, 1987.

&quot;They entered the house like animals, shouting,&quot; the 22-year old student at
Bir Zeit University said. &quot;They took us from the house, kicking us in the
head, beating us, all the soldiers with their rifle butts.&quot;Two others, he
said, beat his hands with lengths of two-by-fours, breaking the bones.

The first priority is to use force, might, beatings. [This] is considered
more effective than detention ... [because] he may then resume stoning
soldiers. But if troops break his hand, he won't be able to throw stones. -
New York Times, January 21, 1988.

AGAINST AN UNARMED CIVILIAN POPULATION.

No matter which house one calls, the anguished accounts of family members
wounded or arrested pour forth. Convoys of buses cruise the streets of
Nablus followed by vans of the Mossad, Israel's secret police. Army units go
from house to house pulling youths from their beds at 3 a.m. As the buses
fill, the soldiers beat the youths viciously around the head, shins, groin
and back. Shrieks fill the air.

AGAINST AN UNARMED CIVILIAN POPULATION.

By April 1988 over 150 Palestinians had died. The Israeli government had
admitted to the arrest of 2,000 people, bringing the acknowledged total to
4,000. The real figure was far higher.

Sources in the West Bank and Gaza established that the number detained by
the weekend of March 27 had exceeded 13,000. Bassam Shaka'a, deposed Mayor
of Nablus, placed the total held solely in a hastily constructed barbed-wire
encampment at Dhariyah at 10,000.

In the Balata camp outside Nablus, and in the Casbah - the old quarter -
l, 000 people were arrested in a period of 48 hours. The discovery of people
in ditches in the fields - shot in the back or with their heads caved in -
has been reported from villages throughout the West Bank and Gaza

TWO OF THE CHILDREN, AGES 9 AND 11 , WERE TAKEN BY THE SOLDIERS IN THEIR
night clothes, frog-marched in the streets and beaten as they were forced by
the jeering soldiers to clear debris.

NEW YORK TIMES
Fleets of helicopters fly over Nablus at night dropping a dense, green toxic
gas over the city. The smell pervades every house. Armed units fire
canisters of the substance into houses at random. Doctors at Ittihad
Hospital reported several deaths and severe lung injuries from this as-yet
unidentified asphyxiating chemical, totally distinct from tear gas.

Among the victims was the grandmother of the Da'as family and the
100-year-old father of noted Nablus attorney Mohammad Irshaid. Soldiers had
entered the house at 2 a.m., smashing furniture and firing a canister of the
dreaded green gas while preventing the family from leaving.

Simultaneously, the Israeli army targeted the hospitals. Army trucks rammed
ambulances and blocked them from reaching the homes of those overcome by the
gas. Soldiers entered the Ittihad Hospital in Nablus numerous times,
arresting the wounded and those waiting to give blood to family members.
EVEN THE OPERATING THEATRE WAS INVADED WHILE SURGEONS WERE OPERATING ON
PATIENTS.

DOCTORS WERE BEATEN AND EQUIPMENT SMASHED. FAMILY MEMBERS WERE PREVENTED
FROM ENTERING THE HOSPITAL AND THE CARS OF DOCTORS AND NURSES WERE DESTROYED
BY SOLDIERS.

Meanwhile, all of Nablus was paralysed by a total strike. All the streets in
every quarter of the city were without open shops or business activity. As
gas permeated the city, cries and chants filled the night.

Gas canisters recovered by Bassam Shaka'a, Yousef al-Masri [chief of Ittihad
Hospital] and American author Alfred Lilienthal bear the markings &quot;560 cs.
Federal Lab. Saltsburg, Pa. USA MK2 1988.&quot; Biochemists are studying their
properties as casualties mount.

JOHN KIFNER reported on April 4 that &quot;Hundreds of refugees were treated in
United Nations clinics for gas inhalation.&quot; On April 15, Kifner wrote,
&quot;...gas has been thrown inside homes, clinics and schools where the effects
are particularly severe.&quot;

This is still going on today, just cleverly concealed with active
participation of western democracies governments, western democracies
religious institions and western democracies media.

Apparently only the ungodly unreligious students find their conscience  so
stirred that they have gone to the oppressed citizens aid with the following
results.

O German Bishops See Racist Israel First Hand

&gt; After visiting the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Museum in Jerusalem
&gt; recently, a group of German bishops crossed over into Occupied
&gt; Palestine and compared Israeli treatment of Palestinians to Nazis
&gt; treatment of the Jews during the Holocaust.

&gt; Bishop Gregor Hanke of Eichstaett reported, &quot;This morning we saw
&gt; pictures of the bestial Warsaw Ghetto at Yad Vashem, and in the
&gt; evening we were in the ghetto of Ramallah. It gives one the creeps,&quot;
&gt; he said.

&gt; Cardinal Joachim Meisner, who served as bishop of Berlin when it was
&gt; divided by the Communist-built Berlin Wall, commented when crossing a
&gt; checkpoint into eastern Jerusalem, &quot;This is something that is done to
&gt; animals, not people.&quot; He later explained to reporters, &quot;I never
&gt; thought I would see something like this again in my life.&quot;

&gt; Walter Mixa, the bishop of Augsburg spoke of Palestinians facing
&gt; &quot;ghettoization with almost racist characteristics.&quot; When asked to
&gt; clarify his comment he replied, &quot;I wanted to say that building the
&gt; wall between Israel and the Palestinian autonomous areas, as well as
&gt; the many Israeli settlements, amounts to a degree of provocation from
&gt; the point of view of the Palestinian population.&quot;

&gt; As might be expected, the bishop's statements have been condemned as
&gt; anti-Semitic, just as President Jimmy Carter has been accused of anti-
&gt; Semitism for daring to tell the truth about Israeli-American policies
&gt; in his best seller, &quot;Palestine - Peace Not Apartheid.&quot;

&gt; Israel's killing, maiming, imprisonment, torture and abuse of
&gt; Palestinian men, women, children and elders is supported by Congress
&gt; with US tax dollars.

One Shot Dead by Israeli Troops in Central G.Strip

GAZA, Palestine, March 10,2007 (IPC+ Agencies) - - A 18- year old
Mohammed Al Ghalban was shot dead , from south east KhanYounis city OF
Gaza Strip when the Israeli occupation forces opened fire at him while
he had been working in his farmland east Deir Al Balah, central Gaza
Strip.

Medics reported that Al Ghalban was shot lethally in the head, killing
him on the spot.

16 wounded in anti-wall demo
picture: http://tinyurl.com/2bvlqt

Two peaceful protesters on Friday paid the price for standing in
solidarity with the villagers of Bilin to protest the theft of their
land when they were attacked and had to be carried to an ambulance for
evacuation. Ben received a blow to the forehead from a rifle butt
whilst a sound bomb was thrown at Jonathan's foot, which exploded on
his shoe leaving him unable to walk.

After the last two large demos, today's march to the wall could be
seen as an anti-climax, but the villagers of Bil'in were determined to
maintain the momentum of their struggle and were not disheartened by
the turn-out of around a hundred.

As has been the pattern in recent weeks soldiers reacted aggressively
to the peaceful chanting and flag waving, and when a few stray stones
came their way were quick to try and disperse the crowd with tear gas
and sound grenades.

Large numbers of soldiers poured through the gate to remove those who
remained and many were grabbed, pushed over and dragged along the
ground merely for standing there.

The occupation soldiers continued to use sound bombs and batons
against the protesters. Iyad Burnat, a member of the popular committee
in Bil'in who was hospitalized at the demo two weeks ago, was again
targeted and beaten on his body. Eleven other protesters were shot
with rubber bullets.

Apartheid Wall built by Israeli occupation forces has annexed almost
60% of the land of Bil'in village in the West Bank.

South Bethlehem villagers protest at worksite of illegally built
apartheid wall
Villagers from the South Bethlehem region came together again this
Friday to protest at the annexation and destruction of their
agricultural land. After prayers held on land belonging to Umm
Salamuna village, speeches were given by representatives from the
local communities and national organisations, and one speech was given
in English for the around 30 international and Israeli activists
appealing for support in the upcoming struggle.

The 200-strong crowd then marched along the razed land which is
currently being leveled for the Apartheid Wall by diggers.

Some of the diggers moved away to work in a different area and
soldiers then blocked the path of the marchers to this area. The
villagers pointed out the injustice and illegality of the Wall but the
soldiers were unmoved and grabbed and pushed them back.

Residents from Wadi Annis sat down in front of the line of soldiers
and anti-occupation slogans were chanted before the crowd dispersed.

Ten villages surrounding Bethlehem will have agricultural land annexed
and destroyed by the Wall with the villages of Wadi Anniss, Um
Salamuna, Wadi Rahhal and Al Ma'sara most effected.

'Knowingly exposed'

The Israeli army occupied the Kasbah, or old town, in Nablus for five
days at the end of last month. It said it was hunting for militants
and their weapons.

Soldiers conducted house-to-house searches. They imposed a two-day
curfew on tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians.

Amid Omeira, aged 15, told B'Tselem that a group of soldiers used the
barrels of their rifles to force him to enter a number of houses ahead
of them.

His 24-year-old cousin Samah told the group and the BBC of a similar
experience, as did Jihan Dadush, aged 11.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

knowingly exposed Samah and the two children to danger as they
expected to find armed men in the houses.

B'Tselem has accused Israel's military authorities of not adequately
informing soldiers about both Israeli and international laws which
prohibit using civilians as human shields.

B'Tselem says the delay in investigating similar alleged incidents in
the past suggests a leniency in the army's attitude towards soldiers
who use civilians in this way.

2000 YEARS OF TERROR
THE COMPILATION OF JEWISH RITUAL MURDERS FROM BEFORE THE TIME OF
CHRIST UNTIL 1932

The earliest of historians, Herodotus, informs us about the Hebrew
cult of human sacrifice. He writes: &quot;The Hebrews sacrificed humans to
their God Moloch.&quot; (Herodotus, Vol. II, p. 45) Christ said to the
Jews: &quot;Your father was a murderer from the beginning.&quot; (John 8:44) By
this he meant Moloch-Yahweh, the supreme Jewish Devil-God. Also, the
prophets Isaiah (57:5), Jeremiah (7:30- 31), Ezekiel (26:26-30), and
Micah (6:7) reproached the Jews for their abominable offerings. Isaiah
said:

&quot;You enflame yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the
children in the valleys under the cliffs of the rocks!&quot;

The ritual murders that have been passed down through writings since
before the time of Christ until today are:

169 B.C. -- &quot;King Antiochus Epiphanes of Syria, during the plundering
of the Temple of Jerusalem, found a Greek lying on a bed in a secret
chamber. He begged the King to rescue him. When he began to beg, the
attendants told him that a secret law commanded the Jews to sacrifice
human beings at a certain time annually. They therefore searched for a
stranger which they could get in their power. They fattened him, led
him into the woods, sacrificed him, ate some of his flesh, drank some
of his blood, and threw the remains of his body into a
ditch.&quot; (Josephus, Jewish historian, Contra Apionem)

418 A.D. -- Baronius reports the crucifixion of a boy by the Jews at
Imm, between Aleppo and Antioch.

419 A.D. -- In the Syrian district of Imnestar, between Chalcis and
Antioch, the Jews tied a Christian boy to a cross on a holiday and
flogged him to death. (Socrat)

425 A.D. -- Baronius reports the crucifixion of a boy.

614 A.D. -- After the conquest of Jerusalem, the Jews purchased, for a
small amount of money, 90,000 prisoners from the Persian King Chosros
II and murdered them all in the most disgusting ways. (Cluverius,
Epitome his. p. 386)

1071 A.D. -- Several Jews from Blois crucified a child during the
Easter celebration, put his body into a sack and threw it into the
Loire. Count Theobald had the guilty ones burned alive. (Robert of
Mons, Mon. Germ. hist. Script VI 520)

1144 A.D. -- In Norwich, during Passover, 12-year-old St. William was
tied by the local Jews, hanged from a cross, and his blood drained
from a wound in his side. The Jews hid the corpse in the nearby woods.
They were surprised by a local citizen, Eilverdus, who was bribed with
money to keep quiet. Despite this the crime still became notorious.
(Acta sancta, III March, Vol., p. 590)

1160 A.D. -- The Jews of Gloucester crucified a child (Mons Germ.
hist. Script 520)

1179 A.D. -- In Pontoise, on March 25th before Passover, the Jews
butchered and drained St. Richard's body of blood. Due to this, the
Jews were expelled from France. (Rob. of Turn., Rig.u.Guillel. Amor.)

1181 A.D. -- In London, around Easter, near the church of St. Edmund,
the Jews murdered a child by the name of Roertus. (Acta sanct, III
March Vol., 591)

(Blanca Hispania illustrata, tom. III, p. 657)

1191 A.D. -- The Jews of Braisme crucified a Christian who had accused

murdered a boy, St. Heinrich. (Murer, Helvetia sancta.)

1225 A.D. -- In Munich a woman, enticed by Jewish gold, stole a small
child from her neighbor. The Jews drained the blood from the child.
Caught in her second attempt, the criminal was handed over to the
courts. (Meichelbeck, Hist. Bavariae II. 94)

1235 A.D. -- the Jews committed the same crime on December 1st in
Erfut. (Henri Desportes, Le mystere du sang, 66)

1236 A.D. -- In Hagenau in Alsace, three Christian boys from the
region of Fulda were attacked by the Jews in a mill during the night
and killed in order to obtain their blood. (Trithemius; Chronicle of

Wilhelm of Rete. (Matthew v. Paris, op. cit. V. 39)

1244 A.D. -- In St. Benedict's churchyard in London, the corpse of a
boy was found which bore cuts and scratches and, in several places,
Hebrew characters. He had been tortured and killed; and his blood had
been drained. Baptized Jews, forced to interpret the Hebrew signs,
found the name of the child's parents and read that the child had been
sold to the Jews when it was very young. Distinguished Jews left the
city in secret. The Catholic Church venerated the Martyr under the
name of St. Paul.

1250 A.D. -- The Jews of Saragossa adopted the horrible dogma that
everyone who deliverd a Christian child for sacrifice would be freed
from all taxes and debts. In June, 1250, Moses Albay-Huzet (Also
called Albajucetto) delivered the 7-year-old Dominico del Val to the
Jews for crucifixion. (Johan. a Lent, Schedias, hist. de pseudomes,
judaorum, p. 33)

1255 A.D. -- At Lincoln, in England, on Peter and Paul's Day, 8-year-
old St. Hugh was stolen by the local Jews, hidden, and later
crucified. The Jews beat him with rods for so long that he almost lost
all his blood. (Acta santa 6 July 494)

1257 A.D. --So that they could commit their annual sacrifice, the Jews
of London butchered a Christian child. (Cluvirius, epitome

did not come to trial until two and a half years later (Sept. 29th to
Oct. 28th, 1913). In the intervening period numerous attempts were
made to lead the investigating officers on to the wrong track.
Meanwhile a large number of incriminating witnesses suffered sudden
and unnatural deaths; false accusations and confessions followed one
after another due to huge money bribes. Behind the accused lurking in
the shadows, was the figure of Faivel Schneerson of the Lubavitchers,
leader of the 'Zadiks' ('Saints') of the Chassidim sect, who was the
spiritual director of the murder. The trial ended with the release of
Beiliss, but at the same time the court established that the murder
had taken place inside the Jewish brickyard, which was the religious
center of the Kiev Jews, for the purpose of obtaining blood. Almost
all the prosecutors, witnesses, and authorities who had spoken out
against Judaism, later fell victim to the Bolshevik Terror.

1926 A.D. -- The bodily remains of the children Hans and Erika Fehse
were found in a parcel on the public square in Breslau. The children
had been butchered. The corpses were bloodless. The genitals were

night of the 22nd-23rd of March, 1928. In the morning, the blood-
drained corpse lay in front of his parents home. (cf. 'Der Sturmer')

1929 A.D. -- The murder at Manau. The boy Karl Kessler was found
butchered and bloodless on March 17th, 1929, several days before
Passover. (cf. 'Der Sturmer')

1932 A.D.-- Martha Kaspar was butchered and dismembered at Paderhorn
on March 18th, 1932. The pieces of the corpse were drained of blood.
The Jew, Moritz Meyer, was convicted and received 15 years in prison.

&gt;   Jewish Professor Admits Jewish Cult Engaged in Past Jewish Ritual
&gt; Murders

&gt; According to a recent report by the newspaper &quot;The Guardian,&quot; Jewish
&gt; Prof. Ariel Toaff, who is a professor at Bar-Ilan University in Israel
&gt; of Medieval Jewish history but is currently a visiting professor in
&gt; Italy, has written a book,&quot;Pasque di Sangue&quot; (Easter of Blood), which
&gt; describes Jewish ritual murder rites of Jews in the past.

&gt; Some details of the book were published in the paper &quot;Corriere Della
&gt; Sera,&quot; which also has an online section describing the book.

&gt; Prof. Toaff's book reportedly &quot;describes the mutilation and
&gt; crucifixion of a two-year-old boy to recreate Christ's execution at
&gt; Pesach, the Jewish Easter. The festival marks the fleeing of the Jews
&gt; from Egypt and Prof Toaff says Christian blood was used for 'magic and
&gt; therapeutic practices,'&quot; noted the Guardian. Further describing the
&gt; bizarre and hateful customs of Jewish extremists, Prof. Toaff noted
&gt; that Jewish occultists would sometimes mix blood in their matzo balls,
&gt; which was eaten during their religious rites.

&gt; He also describes many children who were reportedly crucified on the
&gt; cross.

&gt; Unsurprisingly, many Jewish supremacists quickly denied Prof. Toaff's
&gt; accurate findings in an attempt to hide their ancient, bizarre, and
&gt; frightening customs from the general public.

&gt; However, Prof. Toaff was hardly the first to acknowledge such crimes
&gt; in recent times. Indeed, in more recent times, a Jewish lady had
&gt; appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show several years ago and described how
&gt; some of her relatives had engaged in similar crimes. The honest and
&gt; brave Jewish lady, Vicki Polin (who used the pseudonym of &quot;Rachel&quot; on
&gt; the Oprah Winfrey show to avoid reprisals), told of how her family had
&gt; engaged in some extremely bizarre Satanic Jewish kabbalistic rites,
&gt; including that of infanticide (video of Oprah's interview with Polin).

&gt; In the interview, Oprah asked the young woman, who undoubtedly had
&gt; been traumatized by the ordeal, about what exactly had occurred. Oprah
&gt; opened the discussion, telling of how the poor girl had grown up in a
&gt; family that &quot;participated in human sacrifice,&quot; undoubtedly causing
&gt; emotional scars that may never heal.

&gt; Here is part of the interview:

&gt; OPRAH: ...You come from generations of ritualistic abuse?

&gt; POLIN: Yes, my family has an extensive family tree, and they keep
&gt; track of who's been involved and who hasn't been involved, and it's
&gt; gone back to like 1700.

&gt; OPRAH: And so you were ritually abused.

&gt; POLIN: Right. I was born into a family that believes in this.

&gt; OPRAH: Does everyone else think it's a nice Jewish family? From the
&gt; outside, you appear to be a nice Jewish girl?

&gt; POLIN: Definitely.

&gt; OPRAH: And you all are worshipping the devil inside the home?

&gt; POLIN: Right. There's other Jewish families across the country. It's
&gt; not just my own family.

&gt; OPRAH: Really? And so who knows about it? Lots of people now.

&gt; POLIN: Well, I talked to a police detective in the Chicago area, and
&gt; several of my friends know, and I've spoke publicly before, and...

&gt; OPRAH: So when you were brought up in this kind of evilness, did you
&gt; just think it was normal?

&gt; RACHEL: I blocked out a lot of the memories I had because of my
&gt; multiple personality disorder, but, yes. I mean, it's like if you grow
&gt; up with something, you think it's normal. I always thought
&gt; something...

&gt; OPRAH: So what kinds of things? You don't have to give us the gory
&gt; details, but what kinds of things went on in the family?

&gt; POLIN: Well, there would be rituals in which babies would be
&gt; sacrificed, and you would have to, you know...

&gt; [end of Oprah excerpt]

&gt; You can read more about Polin's ordeal at the website Lukeford

&gt; Polin is now the CEO of the Awareness Center, which honorably works to
&gt; prevent ritual abuse and other acts of child cruelty.

&gt; In more recent times, the book &quot;Blood Ritual&quot; by Philip DeVier and the
&gt; DVD &quot;Jewish Ritual Murder Revisited: The Hidden Cult Revealed,&quot; the
&gt; latter having an interview with noted scholar Dr. Harrell Rhome and
&gt; also being found online in streamable format, have also covered this
&gt; wicked crime committed by Jewish extremists (video).

&gt; There is no reason to believe that all Jews commit ritualistic
&gt; infanticide. However, there appears to be too much evidence to neglect
&gt; such crimes altogether in the past. If committed today, it is mostly
&gt; occurring in Israel, where Jewish occults and extremists remain
&gt; rampant, and possibly occurring elsewhere in small numbers, often
&gt; attributed as Satanic acts.

Russia Takes Underworld to New Level

2006-09-06

Jewish mobsters enjoy safe haven in Israel

Not long ago there was only one Mafia to worry about. But lately guys
with names like &quot;Guido&quot; and &quot;Joey&quot; have been muscled off the most-
wanted list by other guys with names like &quot;Vitaly&quot; and &quot;Slava.&quot;
Russian mobsters, as Robert I. Friedman shows in his timely new book,
Red Mafiya, aren't just copying their Italian counterparts. In many
ways, they're taking professional crime to a whole new level.

Consider violence. When the Italian mobsters get mad at somebody, it's
usually just the offending party who pays the price. Get on the wrong
side of the Russians, reports Friedman, and they'll wipe out your
whole family. And that's not the only way the two crime groups differ.
In key profit centers, such as bank fraud, Russians are scoring record
gains, but it's in the global arena where they're really beating the
competition.

Being international in outlook gives Russian mobsters an advantage in
drug sales, money laundering and the illegal trade of military
equipment. And being mostly Jewish gives them a safe haven in Israel
where many Russian Mafia types are citizens and thus immune from
extradition to the United States when the feds get after them.

As they did during Soviet times, crime and government function more or
less as one in post-communist Russia. Today, though, the same thing
may be happening in Israel, which, Friedman claims, is close to
becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Russian crime syndicates.
&quot;With two decades of unimpeded growth the Russian Mafiya has succeeded
in turning Israel into its very own &quot;mini-state,' in which it operates
with virtual impunity,&quot; he writes. Warns one international law
enforcement official quoted by Friedman: &quot;Israel is going to have to
do something. They could lose their whole country.&quot;

&gt; Clio Gagged&quot; is a recent article by that intrepid Jewish writer, Israel
&gt; Shamir, a man I believe to be the most courageous and intellectually
honest
&gt; Jew in the world. Shamir, an Israeli former member of the IDF, has dared
to
&gt; present the other side of the Jewish-Gentile conflict. In a media
saturated
&gt; by Jewish power, only one position on this conflict is permitted: Jews are
&gt; always innocent, Gentiles are always guilty. Anything else other than this
&gt; simple polemic is deemed anti-Semitism. In truth, since the Jewish sojourn
&gt; in Egypt, through Roman occupation of Jerusalem, the Babylonian
Capitivity,
&gt; their Middle ages presence in Eastern and Central Europe, to the present
&gt; modern state of Israel, Jewish ideology and power has been far more
&gt; chauvinist, intolerant, hateful and ultimately murderous than that of
their
&gt; antagonists. As my book, JEWISH SUPREMACISM shows, no major writing on
Earth
&gt; comes close to the ethnic supremacism and hatred of the Talmud. Obviously,
&gt; as a person of Jewish descent, Shamir has no wish for reciprocal hatred or
&gt; harm to fall upon the Jewish people. As a person of European descent,
&gt; neither do I, but I am committed to exposing and defending my people from
&gt; the threat of Jewish supremacism. Shamir, perhaps Quixote-like, seeks a
new
&gt; path for the Jewish people, one that seems an unlikely development in a
&gt; Jewish extremist power structure that has refined and fortified itself for
&gt; 3000 years. One thing that Shamir and I know is that Jewish Supremacism
&gt; poses a great threat to the heritage and freedom of the European people,
and
&gt; indeed to all peoples on Earth. It has led not only to the ethnic
cleansing
&gt; and barbarous oppression of the people of Palestine, its media occupation
in
&gt; America and Europe have undermined every worthy tradition and morality of
&gt; the culture of the West, its political power has led to the opening of
&gt; America and Europe to invasion. It is why American treasure and blood are
&gt; shed in the sands of Iraq and Afghanistan, and it leads us to a possible
&gt; apocalypse against Iran. Shamir is not only brilliant in his ideas, but
his
&gt; knowledge and literary ability make his articles a joy and marvel to read.

Buying the Emek
Dr. Arthur Ruppin
The New Palestine
New York, May 1929

The acquisition of the Emek Yizael for Jewish colonization has been
the object of Jewish efforts for many years. It was natural that this
region, the largest fertile plain of Palestine, should have aroused
the interest of the Jewish colonization societies at the very
beginning. When the pogroms of 1890 caused large numbers of Jews to
emigrate from Russia, some of them turned to Palestine. As a result
there arose, in the larger Russian cities, Jewish societies whose aim
was the acquisition of land in Palestine for purposes of colonization.
These societies had connections with the Odessa Committee of the
'Hovevei Zion, which accordingly commissioned its Jaffa office to buy
suitable land in Palestine for these societies. The directors of this
office, Tiomkin, Pines and Bentovim, conceived the plan of purchasing
a considerable part of the Emek Yizael and of the Plain of Acco. It
was not only the fertility of these plains that attracted the, but
also the fact that these were the only regions where it was possible
to purchase a large stretch of land from a single owner, while the
remainder of Palestine was broken up into small parcels belonging to
many individuals, so that the acquisition of a considerable continuous
expanse was exceedingly difficult.

In order to execute this plan the Jaffa office communicated with
Messrs. Kalvariski and Joshua Hankin. The latter, then a young man of
twenty-five had already demonstrated his skill in such negotiations in
the acquisition of land for the colonies Rehoboth and Hederah. By
energetic work he succeeded, in 1891, in reaching an agreement with
large owners in the Emek Jezreel and the Plain of Acco for the
purchase of 160,000 dunams at 15 francs per dunam. These 160,000
dunams included the territory which came into the possession of the
Haifa Bay Development Company a few years ago, and, lately, of the
Jewish National Fund. Hankin had not found it easy to reach this
agreement to a low price, for even then speculators of all kinds were
surrounding the land owners and attempting to frustrate his efforts by
offering a higher price. But Hankin enjoyed the confidence of the
Arabs, so that he succeeded in overcoming the competition of the
speculators. Before the consummation of the agreement, however the
Turkish Government, alarmed by the increasing inflow of Russian Jews,
prohibited Jewish immigration entirely. This blow proved disastrous
for the negotiations. The Russian societies formed for the purposes of
purchasing land were dissolved, failed to send in the money they had
promised, and the entire magnificent project fell through.

Two decades passed before another attempt was made to acquire the Emek
Yizrael (The valley of Jezreel). It was only in 1910 that Hankin --
who, in the meanwhile, had purchased land in Lower Galilee for the ICA
-- resumed his negotiations for land in the Emek. Authorized by a
Russian Jew, Elias Blumenfeld, to arrange for the purchase of 1,000
dunams on which he, Blumenfeld, intended to establish a farm with his
own means, Hankin concluded an agreement for a stretch of 9,500 dunams
in Fule, later Merchavia [Al-Ful in Arabic]. He hoped that the ICA, in
whose employ he was at that time, would buy the remainder of the land.
When, however, the ICA refused to do so, he inquired of me, who was
then the director of the Palestine Bureau of the Zionist Organization,
whether the Zionists would be prepared to purchase this land. Even
before that it had occurred to me, whenever, going from Haifa to
Nazareth, I had viewed the broad expanse of the Emek Yizrael, that,
because of its proximity to Haifa, its excellent railroad and highway
connections, and the ease with which its soil could be cultivated,
this land would be preeminently suited for Jewish colonization.

But it was no simple matter to obtain the money for this purchase.
Only the fact that Franz Oppenheimer was just then seeking land for
the co-operative colonization society he had recently organized, and
the simultaneous appearance of some private purchasers. made it
possible to carry through this project. 3,500 dunams were taken over
by the National Fund for the co-operative colonies, and the rest by
the Palestine Land Development Company.

This, however, did not mean that the transaction was consummated, for
the Turkish Government refused to authorized the sale, even though
official permission was applied for not by the National Fund, nor by
the Palestine Land Development Company, but by a Jew, Efraim Krause,
who was a Turkish citizen. The Governor in Nazareth, a rabid anti-
Zionist, declared that he would fight this purchase to the utmost;
furthermore, he ignored the orders of his superior, the District
Governor in Acco, who wished no difficulties put in the way of this
transaction. We were forced, therefore, to appeal to the Vali, the
Governor General in Beirut. Great haste was necessary, for the
purchase was beginning to attract attention, and influential circles
were doing their best to nullify it.

I still remember how, in February, 1910, Hankin and I rode on
horseback (for the roads were unfit for carriages) from Haifa to
Beirut, through a fearful rainstorm that prevented any ships from
plying between the two cities; it was midnight when we reached Sidon,
so that we arrived in Beirut only on the second day. But although we
remained there for two weeks, and although official permission for the
purchase was promised us from day to day, we were, finally, obliged to
leave Beirut without accomplishing our purpose. Only though the
efforts of Hankin and his friends in Constantinople did we at last
succeed in obtaining from the ministry the necessary sanction. This
meant the gaining of our first foothold in the Emek.; and before long
the Oppenheimer co-operative settlement and some private colonists
commenced their agricultural work there.

About this time, too, the interest of the wealthier Russian Jews in
the purchase of Palestinian land was revived. After the acquisition of
Merhaviah, Hankin had gone over from the ICA to the Palestine Land
Development Company, which offered him the opportunity to exercise his
abilities to the fullest extent. He neglected no occasion for the
increase of our land holdings in Palestine, and, in 1913, commenced
negotiations for a stretch of 20,000 dunam in Meshach, adjoining
Merhaviah, reaching a provisional agreement for a price of about forty
francs per dunam.

On a visit to Russia, and by correspondence, I endeavored to find
buyers for this land; the Odessa Committee, too, made efforts in this
direction. With the assistance of the late engineer Nachum Syrkin of
Kiev the interest of the wealthy sugar manufacturer Brodski was
aroused in this land, where he expected to attempt the cultivation of
sugar
