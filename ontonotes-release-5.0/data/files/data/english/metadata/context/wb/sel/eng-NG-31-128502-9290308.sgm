Your blog won't get listed by Yahoo, or any other search engine,
automatically.  You have to do some work, let them know that you're
there, that you want to be listed, and that you are worthy of being
listed.

1) Get your friends to link to your blog, where your blog is relevant.
2) Participate in forums, where your blog is relevant, and include the
URL.
3) Comment on other blogs, in relevant comments, and include the URL.
4) Put relevant and useful content in your blog.
5) Some search engines may index your blog using the site feed.  Be
sure to activate the feed.
6) When you have done all of the above, your blog will have some
weight.  Submit your blog to the search engines, for indexing.

Remember though, none of this happens overnight.  Search engines can
take months to index your blog fully.  And even when indexed, don't
expect for a search to some key element in your blog to give you an
entry on the first page of the search hits.
