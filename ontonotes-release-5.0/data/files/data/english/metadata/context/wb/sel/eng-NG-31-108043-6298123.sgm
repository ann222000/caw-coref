Discuss: a REALLY deep hole

Suppose that on a D&amp;D world someone wanted to dig a really deep hole,
like 50 miles deep.  Also suppose that such a hole is possible (you
won't run into the mantle and temps won't get excessive).  You want to
be able to later use this hole to transport things up and down so it
has to be fairly large.  Don't worry about disposal of removed
materials (if any) once they reach the surface.

What would be the best way to dig the hole?  Obviously magic needs to
be used but what magic(s)?

Let's set some limits on the discussion:

1) PHB, DMG, MM1, and Spell Compendium only.
2) The lower the level of any required spellcasters (or other leveled
characters) the better.
2a) The fewer the number of spells required the better.
3) No hard time limit but it would be nice to finish ASAP.
4) The hole needs to be big enough to move a 10'x10''x20' object up and
down.

So, have at it!  :-)

Charm Person.  Go have a talk with the Dwarven King.  Bring lots of cash
because friendship is good, but gold is still gold.

In a game world you can get away with saying "no problems".  In a more
realistic world, heat is only one of the problems.  The other one is
plasticity.  Under the pressures that far down, solid stone flows, even if
it isn't liquid due to the heat.

You're wanting a hole 50 miles deep, about 80 km.  The current world record
(held in Russia if I remember correctly) for drilling a hole is about 12 km.

I have a spell in my campaign which will do the job.  Unfortunately, it
takes 2 L17 casters, and is called Volcano.  However, if you rule that it
actually has to hit the mantle to create one, you could use it to drill an
arbitrarily deep hole by simply specifying the depth at which it hits the
mantle and stopping before it gets that far.

What about XP cost? I'd assume that spells with no XP cost to cast are
preferred...

Also what about materials cost? I'd assume that spells with a monetary
(materials) cost are preferably avoided, but that they'd be wieved more
favourably than spells with an XP cost...

Thirdly, very obscure and rarely-useful spells that one might be lucky
enough to find in wands or staves (or even on scrolls), would presumably
be preferred (since one might as well use those charges, rather than
keep otherwise useless magic items lying around).

Rather than a spell, an item, one Lyre of Building.  It's one of our
wizard's favorite items.  He took enough ranks of perform to be able to
keep it up all day.  Then there's that ring of sustenance which means
he can keep at it as long as he wants.  If you do the math he's doing
the work of almost 5000 men... Only problem is figuring out how fast
men can tunnel... well old DMG 1 comes in here we'll average 50 cubic
feet per 8 hours per man, so times 600 he's doing 1500 cubic feet per
30 minute period (normally how long you use the lyre). 72,000 cubic
feet per day (with the ring of sustenance), you need 1,056,000 per mile
at 10x20' so he'll need 14.6 days per mile, or just under 2 years.  Of
course any interruption means no work for the rest of the week which
really hurts, and you need approximately 8 ranks in perform lyre, which
not everyone is going to have. You can always hire a bard or expert,
with even a +2 mod you really only need a lv 3 bard.  You could hire a
bunch of bards and get a bunch of lyres and rings.

I don't believe there are any spells that can match that kind of
production.
There used to be a 'dig' spell but I don't see it anymore.  Passwall is
temporary.  Stoneshape just lets you reshape the stone.  The only other
possibility would be to destroy the stone, such as with disintegrate or
a sphere of annihilation.

Disintegrate looks good, a 10' cube for each casting.  Of course you
need 2 castings to get your 10x20 profile, at 50 miles that's 52,800
castings though, or 144.6 years at 1 casting per day.  Even at 3
castings a day that's almost 50 years - or hey 1 mile per year...
Still much slower than the lyre, but on the other hand you only need to
do for a round or three a day.

The Sphere is a priceless artifact so it's unlikely to fit your needs,
but even so it's pretty slow, by my calculations about the same as a a
lyre using a ring of sustenance again.   But you need a very high
level/int spellcaster to use it instead of about a lv 3 bard.

The only other possibility would be to find something that has a burrow
speed that leaves a tunnel and summon/call/polymorph/shapechange and
use it to create the tunnel, and I don't believe there is anything like
that in the MM, or possibly anywhere though...

On second thought there is the beholder with its ray of disintegration.
Shapechange to a beholder.  At 17th lv, a wizard is going to get 170
minutes of shapechange, or 1700 rounds, being able to use disintegrate
every round at our 52,800 castings that's only 31 castings of
shapechange, which is significantly better than the 2 years of lyre
usage.  If you dominate/charm/befriend a real beholder, or call a
fiendish beholder,  you can get it done in less than 24 hours, which in
actuality may be easier than getting a 17th lv. wizard (or druid) to do
your work for a month.

Beholders must explain where all those underground tunnels/chambers,
maybe the whole underdark comes from their excavations.

You can also use stone to flesh to much the same effect as
disintegrate, but it affects a smaller area, you'd need about 10
castings to 1 casting of disintegrate.

Purple worms have Burrow 20:

Burrow: A creature with a burrow speed can tunnel through dirt, but not
through rock unless the descriptive text says otherwise. Creatures
cannot charge or run while burrowing. Most burrowing creatures do not
leave behind tunnels other creatures can use (either because the
material they tunnel through fills in behind them or because they do
not actually dislocate any material when burrowing); see the individual
creature descriptions for details.

The SRD purple worm says nothing about being able to burrow through
rock nor about leaving a tunnel.  The text above implies that such
creatures do indeed exist.  So there would need to be a critter that
can burrow through stone and specifically says it leaves a tunnel
behind.

I checked the SRD and only a handlful on monsters burrow in stone and
all of those specifically say they leave no tunnel behind (or indeed
even disturb the stone).

This one looks good however I think you are abusing the rules a bit...

Lyre of Building: ...
The lyre is also useful with respect to building. Once a week its
strings can be strummed so as to produce chords that magically
construct buildings, mines, tunnels, ditches, or whatever. The effect
produced in but 30 minutes of playing is equal to the work of 100
humans laboring for three days. Each hour after the first, a character
playing the lyre must make a DC 18 Perform (string instruments) check.
If it fails, she must stop and cannot play the lyre again for this
purpose until a week has passed.
Faint transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate; Price
13,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.

Sustenance: This ring continually provides its wearer with
life-sustaining nourishment. The ring also refreshes the body and mind,
so that its wearer needs only sleep 2 hours per day to gain the benefit
of 8 hours of sleep. The ring must be worn for a full week before it
begins to work. If it is removed, the owner must wear it for another
week to reattune it to himself.
Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Forge Ring, create food and water; Price
2,500 gp.

The perform checks won't be that hard but fatigue is going to start to
set in without rest.  I don't recall the rules for that and can't find
them int he SRD.

Ah, for some reason I thought it was no need of sleep.  Now that I

SRD fatigue and exhaustion:

"Fatigued: A fatigued character can neither run nor charge and takes a
-2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. Doing anything that would
normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to become
exhausted. After 8 hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no
longer fatigued."

"Exhausted: An exhausted character moves at half speed and takes a -6
penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After 1 hour of complete rest, an
exhausted character becomes fatigued. A fatigued character becomes
exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause fatigue."

You could presumably get at least 48 hours a week skipping one nights
rest before getting to exhausted, you don't need to eat or drink so no
need to break for those. But that slows the production down to 2/9ths
so it would be taking about 9 years at that rate.  Or just hire more
bards/performers with lyres &amp; rings to do the work to shorten the time
if money is available.

You'd probably have to pay 3x the going rate for that kind of grueling
work, on the other hand the bonus they'd have of not having to sleep
but 2 hours a day and getting 5 days a week off would be pretty
attractive... At least until local miners union #209 comes around and
starts demanding the work, putting pressure on you.

&gt; &quot;Purple worms burrow deep beneath the ground in a constant search for
&gt; food.&quot;

&gt; Adult: 8-9' diameter, 40-50' long.

&gt; Now I ask you, What kind of creature can search for food very far
&gt; underground with that width and length and not be able to burrow
&gt; through rock?

&gt; I'll tell you, a very short lived species. A very extinct species.

Purple Worms!
Would you be using charm monster or dominate monster with that?
How do you FEED it while it works?

You'd need to specialize. Make a scroll of purple worm control.

Sure, it's very expensive but if you use charm monster you have a 90%
chance at least of it breaking the spell every week.

You colud also have two magic users take turns casting.

A better way might be to knock the worm unconscious. Hack off it's
tail. Open it's mouth. Puncture four holes. Two for ventilation and two
for steering. Stick a halfling into a barrel. String rope through two
holes cut in the creatures maw. Make sure the two ventilation holes are
strung through with tubing and lead to the barrel. Insert barrel w/
halfling into purple worm. Allow halfling to guide purple worm with the
ends of the rope.

How to feed it? Depends on your alignment really.

my contribution - which will probably be ripped apart by the masses.

14th level sorcerers working in teams - with more needed the further
down you go - with Transmute Rock to Mud, Move Earth and Reverse
Gravity.
without high Charisma - x3 reverse gravity (lasts 14 rounds) covers
7x10' cubes each, x6 Transmute Rock to Mud, and x1 Move Earth

TR2M only goes 10' deep, but with RG in effect you can then cast another
and another, using ME at the top of the tunnel to move it out of the
way.

Once you go beyond the range of TR2M you probably need to levitate the
sorcerer down the hole and do it in halves, unless you can use a "dig"
to make an alcove for them to keep out of the way.

The further you go down the more sorcerers you will need to stack
reverse gravity to get the mud to the top.

I haven't done the math, but I think it would be less than a year.

A sphere of anihilation is an artifact and in any case I don't think
there is any enlarge spell that will work on it.  There is a 9th level
spell from the Spell Compendium that works similarly.  However, IIRC it
is a 1 rd/level spell and so won't be able to tunnel very fast.
Disintigrate would go more quickly as well as being availble to more

Arg, totally forgot about Transmute Rock to Mud.   Reverse Gravity is
ingenious.   Move earth indicates it can't be used for tunneling
though, and just shifts stuff around

If you've got access to a 14+ Druid they could Reverse Gravity &amp; Repel
Earth and Stone so the mud/sand floats up and then gets pushed away.

Druids also get Soften Earth &amp; Stone, which is much like Transmute Rock
to Mud, but only goes from 1 to 4 feet down depending on how hard the
material is.  It's a 2nd level spell though so it's likely to be in
much higher supply.

Both Transmute Rock to Mud &amp; Soften Earth &amp; Stone are lower level than
Disintegrate in any case so easier to access.  It also combines well
with the Lyre of Building method I gave as the tunneling rates I gave
was through standard rock, and the tunneling becomes 2x faster through
very soft material (or 1/2 as slow through harder material, which means
it's 4x faster in those instances).

Quite a bit more, see my numbers on disintegrate which transmute rock
to mud would be similar to, about 50 years divided by number of
castings per day, although lower level, so the same person who had
disintegrate would be able to cast more transmute rock to muds, so it's
more efficient, it also covers the requirement of 20x10 with one spell
instead of two, so that reduces time by 1/2 right there.

A lot of people seem to dismiss the notion based on normal Earth-like

Imaginative is fine, but if you're gonna think of realistic consequences,
it's nice if you have the skills to figure out *what* those consequences
will be.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Maybe someone else has mentioned this, but doesn't the force f gravity
&gt; become more as you journey deeper into the earth?
">

No.

The force of gravity becomes *lower* as you journey deeper into the earth.

Quickie proof:  When you're standing on the ground, all of the earth is
below you, pulling down.  When you're 1 mile down, you've got 1 mile less
pulling down on you.

It can be proven (and I'm not gonna do it here) that the pull from the
1-mile thick "skin" above you matches the pull from all other points of the
1-mile thick "skin" in all other directions.  Thus, the effective gravity
when you're 1 mile down is that of the planet less a 1-mile thick layer.
Same thing with 10 miles, 100 miles, or whatever.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Or is that just under
&gt; water?
">

And no.

The force of gravity becomes lower as you journey underwater, too.  However
(using the 1-mile depth example), because the water above you doesn't have
the same pull as the mile of rock in the "skin" in other places, it doesn't
balance and thus doesn't decrease as much as if it were 1 mile of rock above
you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Gravity/pressure may play a role in destroying the characters
&gt; plans just as much as creatures from the depths.
">

However, the OP stated that problems such as these (temperature, plasticity,
pressure) would not be taken into account.

What the hell, let's do this:

Planet 13,000 km in diameter, made of solid iron:
Mass = 9,058 e 21 kg
F = GM/r^2 = 6.67e-11 * 9058e21 / (6500*1000)^2 = 14.3 m/s^2

(Why is it higher than Earth?  Because Earth ain't made of solid iron and is
smaller.)

Cut off a 100 km skin:
Mass = 8,646 e 21 kg
F = GM/r^2 = 6.67e-11 * 8646e21 / (6400*1000)^2 = 14.1 m/s^2

So, even with a bigger planet, made of heavier stuff, and going lots deeper,
the change in gravity is only 0.2 m/s^2, and is *less*, not more.

They really need to teach more science and math in schools.  Having
politicians and lawyers making decisions when they have absolutely no idea
what they're talking about is very disturbing.  Liberal Arts degrees are a
*bad* *thing*.

Why are you so stuck up about your knowledge? Do you expect everyone to
memorize a bunch of formulas that they never use? Do you expect
everyone to live a life conducive to such learning?

There are quite a few things I learned through my experiences that
happen to be much more valuable to my day to day survival than gravity
equations. Maybe there are some things you don't know that I consider
elementary.

That's what is so great about a role playing game. You can learn and

As equal gravity in all directions doesn't "pin" you (gravity's a

Yes, the pressure will crush you, IFF you aren't at the same pressure.
If you are in a oxygenated fluid (perfluorocarbons, usually) then you

The core is the power. If you explode something in the core it will

Opposite. As you enter the core it launches the creation of a new

Paired down at 50 miles effects are similar or less grand. Matching of
course how much of the drug you took. The air must have taken on an

Yes.

I disagree that this is a fun question.

If there was no gravity the earth might as well be sand. If you still
classify this as earth. Fiend Folio says the sandman is clearly from
another plane.

Since gravity is a manifestation of energy bringing things together and
all the other manifestations of energy in the universe alike, if you
didn't have one, you might not have the rest because it is the same
energy, in all it's many forms (or if you prefer, instances). Magic is
an additional energy in some games. Note it is additional, not
subtractive.

Funner quest: You are tunneling though the elemental plane of earth
with a pack of umber hulks. The pack looses it's morale. You either
failed your charima check or the wizard forgot to keep them spelled

2nd Ed. Reverse Gravity's better.  No top to it, so you can shovel
stuff in at any depth and it'll shoot it out (very fast) at the top of
your shaft.  One of my all-time favourite mass-destruction spells.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;If you've got access to a 14+ Druid they could Reverse Gravity &amp; Repel
&gt;Earth and Stone so the mud/sand floats up and then gets pushed away.

15 Druid.  Or can a 14 Druid get L8 bonus spells?

Keep in mind that RG only lasts 1 round per level, and at 15 only
moves stuff up 70 feet.  You're gonna need *lots* of 'em to move stuff
50 miles (3,772 of 'em).

This leads to an interesting set of thoughts.  RG moves stuff up
through it's field "in the same manner as they would during a normal
downward fall".

First, if it only moves stuff the 70 feet a round, then in order to
get stuff up, it's going to take 3,772 6-second rounds to get material
to the top.  Obviously, therefore, casting must be staggered so that
A) spells don't expire before anything even gets to them and B) spells
don't expire while still holding a mass of mud / stone / whatever.  If
they do, this will be... rather unfortunate for the casters further
down the shaft.

Second, if "in the same manner" means "just as if falling" (and this
is borne out by creatures / objects taking damage as if falling 70
feet), then at the top of the first RG, the mud is moving upwards
at...

d=d0+v0t+1/2at^2 --&gt; 70=0+0+1/2(32)t^2 --&gt; 140/32 = t^2 = 2.09 seconds

v=v0+at --&gt; v=32*2.09 = 66.9 FPS

It's gonna zip through the second RG in just under 1 second, gaining
another... about 27 FPS.

The third one's gonna be even faster, and so on until it hits terminal
velocity.

In this case, terminal velocity's going to be lower than 120 MPH
because that sucker's trying to push the entire column of air above it
out, with a corresponding partial vacuum behind (below) it.

Once it's got it's speed up, timing's going to be a little bit
trickier for the mages.  On the other hand, let's say the top speed's
100 MPH.  Once it hits that, you can skip a gap while it slows down
(about 3/4 of the distance used to accelerate it, as a WAG for
safety), then have another sequence of mages accelerate it again.
Another gap, another set, so on and so forth.

You can probably get by with, say, 2,200 mages.

Congratulations, we now have a maglev catapult, without the maglev.
RG isn't Reverse Gravity, it's RailGun.

&gt;Druids also get Soften Earth &amp; Stone, which is much like Transmute Rock
&gt;to Mud, but only goes from 1 to 4 feet down depending on how hard the
&gt;material is.  It's a 2nd level spell though so it's likely to be in
&gt;much higher supply.

&gt;Both Transmute Rock to Mud &amp; Soften Earth &amp; Stone are lower level than
&gt;Disintegrate in any case so easier to access.  It also combines well
&gt;with the Lyre of Building method I gave as the tunneling rates I gave
&gt;was through standard rock, and the tunneling becomes 2x faster through
&gt;very soft material (or 1/2 as slow through harder material, which means
&gt;it's 4x faster in those instances).

&gt;&gt; TR2M only goes 10' deep, but with RG in effect you can then cast another
&gt;&gt; and another, using ME at the top of the tunnel to move it out of the
&gt;&gt; way.

&gt;&gt; Once you go beyond the range of TR2M you probably need to levitate the
&gt;&gt; sorcerer down the hole and do it in halves, unless you can use a &quot;dig&quot;
&gt;&gt; to make an alcove for them to keep out of the way.

&gt;&gt; The further you go down the more sorcerers you will need to stack
&gt;&gt; reverse gravity to get the mud to the top.

&gt;to mud would be similar to, about 50 years divided by number of
&gt;castings per day, although lower level, so the same person who had
&gt;disintegrate would be able to cast more transmute rock to muds, so it's
&gt;more efficient, it also covers the requirement of 20x10 with one spell
&gt;instead of two, so that reduces time by 1/2 right there.
">

Leads to another question.  When casting Transmute Rock to Mud, does
it occur instantly, or does it take a few seconds?

If instantly, then that's the way it goes.

If it takes a few seconds (sort of like a softening field advancing
through the rock), then... if you're removing it as fast as it
changes, does the "max 10' depth" apply at the start, or at any
instant?  I.e., if you're removing the mud as fast as it's being
created, will Transmute Rock to Mud continue to work, trying to create
a 10' depth until it runs out of 10' cubes of effect?

Yeah, it's cheesy, but it provides some interesting possibilities for
*new* spells, don't it?

3' across by 10' long.  That's over 70 cubic feet of FOOD from a Level

guy.  Team it up with Wall of Iron and Transmute Metal to Wood and
have yourself a really big barbeque.)

Interesting question.  From what you've said in previous messages, it
sounds like it should be 'none' -- gravity is pulling 'infinitely' in
all directions.

Thankfully, we're not limited to RL physics.  IMC it's 'heavy gravity',
toward the nearest elemental surface.  You can walk all the way around a
tunnel if you want; if you jump high enough that your center of mass
gets over halfway to the ceiling (hard to do under heavy gravity, mind)
then you'll find yourself 'falling' toward the ceiling.

Why?  I like it that way.

A similar question is 'how much pressure are you under on the Elemental
Plane of Water (or Air)?'  I don't think RL physics can really give an
answer here.  An infinite amount of water, in an infinite space, with no
gravity to encourage it to 'settle'.  I just went with 'subjective' --
whatever the creature observing can comfortably handle.  I considered
having high and low pressure (where 'low pressure' is 'what humans can
handle comfortably') regions, but decided I couldn't be bothered.

Actually, it does.  Pressure is dependent upon a non-uniform
gravitational field.  With infinite material in all directions,
uniform field, no pressure.

Infinite mass in all directions?  Breakdown of certain basic

I just treat it as "underwater", with no pressure, and again,
arbitrary gravity for those who have submersibles.

Bonus fun questions:

Everybody expects darkness on the Plane of Earth (they're tunnels,

Everybody expects light on the Plane of Fire.

Plane of Air - are there really enough pockets of fire (portals to the

move earth was just to shift the mud when it gets to the top of the

a single sorcerer - assuming there are enough reverse gravities
available to get the mud to the top of the shaft?

&gt; 2nd Ed. Reverse Gravity's better.  No top to it, so you can shovel

yep - I restricted myself to d20 SRD. 2ed RG was definitely a fantastic
spell.

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Keep in mind that RG only lasts 1 round per level, and at 15 only
&gt; moves stuff up 70 feet.  You're gonna need *lots* of 'em to move stuff
&gt; 50 miles (3,772 of 'em).
">

and that's the problem I had (which wouldn't have been the case in 2ed).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This leads to an interesting set of thoughts.  RG moves stuff up
&gt; through it's field &quot;in the same manner as they would during a normal
&gt; downward fall&quot;.

&gt; First, if it only moves stuff the 70 feet a round, then in order to
&gt; get stuff up, it's going to take 3,772 6-second rounds to get material
&gt; to the top.  Obviously, therefore, casting must be staggered so that
&gt; A) spells don't expire before anything even gets to them and B) spells
&gt; don't expire while still holding a mass of mud / stone / whatever.  If
&gt; they do, this will be... rather unfortunate for the casters further
&gt; down the shaft.

&gt; Second, if &quot;in the same manner&quot; means &quot;just as if falling&quot; (and this
&gt; is borne out by creatures / objects taking damage as if falling 70
&gt; feet), then at the top of the first RG, the mud is moving upwards
&gt; at...

&gt; d=d0+v0t+1/2at^2 --&gt; 70=0+0+1/2(32)t^2 --&gt; 140/32 = t^2 = 2.09 seconds
">

the other thing I thought of was somehow gating or dimension dooring it
away, but Gate is level 9, and dimension door would require the caster
to touch the mud and go through with it (up the shaft).

Actually that would normally be accounted for in the 'tunneling rate'
but if you are moving the rock an average of 25 miles (assuming you
come across no caverns in the way) it could be considerably longer.  I
don't think the lyre has that kind of range either (without looking it
up).

I also looked again and saw I used the 'soft stone' rate, the hard
stone rate is 1/2 the rate I gave, which probably the majority would
be, and then there's the very soft stone rate which is 1 &amp; 1/2 times as
fast.

Another problem with the whole idea is you'd need some way of getting
people up and down in any case, a pully rope &amp; basket system wouldn't
work as the rope would break from it's own weight long before you
reached 50 miles.

I was thinking building it as a set of spiral stairs.  You could build
a 2nd set that's just a spiral ramp one could slide down.  Or you could
do that both ways with a permanent reverse gravity on one.

If you really don't need a tunnel and you just want to go from point a
to point b, you could just build 2 teleport circles.
