My partner and I had a great week with 9 classes so far.  We each did
a double during the week and boy can my knees tell it.  I'm going to
have to try to make the double such that one class is body sculpting.
Or do very low impact on one of the classes.

Hey instructors!  What's the fastest anyone has earned a challenge in
the past?  How many classes does your leading team have now?  I spoke
with one friend on Saturday, and her team had 12 classes already!

My students are excited about the promo but most aren't motivated to
double up to earn the tee quickly! I probably won't give my first ones
out until the middle of December. Congrats to you and your partner
though for getting 9 points so far!

I have one team with 10 and they are leading.  I made a rule this time
that no one gets double points for coming twice in one day.. I guess
you can call me Scrooge on this, and it's a first for me. I have one
student that would/will come twice a day (20 minutes a class) every
day till her team gets the promo item and then be MIA for weeks. I
told the class the purpose of the promo isn't to see how fast you can
get the tee, but to keep consistency in your workout schedule during a
time when other things might get in the way. I had two boo's and
hisses, and the rest are fine with the rule. (One point per person per
day).  Injuries for a tee shirt= not a good thing!!

Scrooge.

I did a double yesterday - partner didn't as her Navy son rolled in
from a firend's at 3:30 a.m. after saying he'd be home at 2:00. You
never stop worrying about the kids...

So we are at 6 and I'll be going today which will make 7 (she
understandably wants to stay home with her son while he's home on a
short leave).  Next week, I hope to make 4 or 5 and so does she.

I don't really care about the tee - it doesn't do much for me but it
does get me to class.

ME, I never thought of it that way.  Actually I like the way you
think.  Consistency is a great habit to learn.  Unfortunately, we are
always in a bit of a rush because the promo is &quot;while supplies last&quot;.
Even tho' our CO orders a lot of the promo items, they do run out near
the end.  And there are several teams that do a lot of doubles every
week.  Your rule would certainly help out.

Christine, we fitness instructors know the secrets to being fit:
Consistency!  You can overindulge in fitness just like you do food.
We'd much rather that you learn to pace yourself, just like you do in
a run:  You don't hammer and then die, you pace yourself so that you
finish on two feet, rather than on all fours.

As far as any kind of training and fitness goes, you're much better
off doing less over the long haul than doing your max in a short time
span.  The idea behind the promo is to be fit over the holidays and
into the new year, as opposed to being fit for the holidays and then
slacking.  All of us instructors are hoping you guys opt for the big
picture, rather than focusing on the short-term.

Either way, we're all pulling for your success!

The promotion couldn't have come at a better time.  I try to make
class 3 times a week and lately I'd had trouble making  my Monday
class.  I don't think I'm so much after the t-shirt, but the fact that
my partner might want it and I don't want to let her down.  (I
actually don't know who my partner is - I just had the class manager
pair me with someone.)

Our franchise doesn't allow more than one point per day either.  And I
guess there won't be any extra points for doing a routine at the front
of the class with the instructor either.
