&gt;We took Jake to the vet when the spraying started - they said it was

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> DUH! f course I know - but the worst is what pregnant mothers can get
- toxoplasmosis. Since the child has been born, it's unlikely to
suffer any &quot;serious&quot; disease from the cat. Period.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;THat's why pregnant and

"/> Once the baby starts to crawl, behaviour modification would have taken
care of the &quot;problem&quot; anywhere

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;We wouldn't give our cat to an adoption shelter because we know of FAR TOO

"/> is that a fact? At least people who go to shelters generally care more
than people who buy or get cats from newspaper columns...........

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The Humane Societies DO NOT screen adoptive pet owners enough. If

"/> Fine. Then make it your priority to find him a home. Just remember,
you SHOULDN'T KILL HIM -

He didn't ASK to come into your home

He didn't ASK you to buy an expensive carpet for your basement (why
bother in the basement anyway? It's not like its a public area of a
house???)

He didn't ASK for you to lie on your back and have a baby, did he?

So why punish him for YOUR choice to have a child?

Where do you live? if you don't want him and I'm close enough
I'll give him the loving home he deserves

He gets LOTS of love - that's not the problem!

There is a vaccination that babies get to prevent &quot;disease&quot; from cats' feces
(but I can't remember what it is called). So, since my baby has only had
one vaccination, she will not be totally protected from this disease, yet.
So you can't say there is not much likelyhood of a &quot;serious&quot; disease. And
as far as behaviour modification, you can tell her all you want not to go
there - but until babies are about 2 years old, they don't understand
totally. If you turn your head for a minute - she could be there trying to
eat it. (They are quick you know!)

Some (obviously not all) people who adopt from the shelters have good
intentions initially, but once the novelty wears off....... We have seen
this on a number of occasions and we would not subject our pets to that. He
would have to go to someone we KNEW.

And who are you to say our basement is not a public area of our house!!! It
is the centre of attraction at our house. It is our &quot;entertainment&quot; area -
pool table, fireplace, 50&quot; TV, etc. So, that's why we got the expensive
carpet. We were going to get berber carpet, but were told our cats would
destroy that in a couple of years (clawing). So, we chose the expensive
carpet. Though none of this is any of your business. Who are you to judge
&quot;why&quot; we have expensive carpet in our basement!!

No, he didn't ask me to have a child - but in case you haven't noticed, that
is generally a normal way that things happen in most families. As far as
punishing him for our choice to have a child, are you suggesting that we put
the cat before our baby?! That's insane! We are doing all we can to keep
our happy little home and keep EVERYONE happy.

I was only looking for &quot;suggestions&quot; (not critisism on how we chose to live)
on what might help to get Jake pooping where he is supposed to. If I'm not
getting anything but critisism, then there is no sense in even asking!

he said:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> Obviously not that much if you need something to &quot;save&quot; him....

(wife assuming response) i've read your previous posts, and i have
to say that unfortunately, you seem to be one of those people who
look at companion animals as possessions rather than a life! i mean,
it's almost like you're &quot;getting rid of&quot; a sofa you don't like
anymore! sorry if you can't understand, but that makes both my
husband and myself VERY angry! it's a big part of the reason there
are so many strays and so many animals awaiting adoption, cuz
their &quot;owners&quot; found it inconvenient to keep their end of the
relationship up. when you adopt a cat or dog, you're assuming a
responsibility to care for them for the REST of their life!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> Yes, I can actually. The chances of your cat transmitting any
*serious* problems to your child are infinitessimal. Your child has
more chance of catching a cold and dying than anything she could
catch from your cat. i mean, improper defecation that only happened
TWICE isn't necessarily an indication of future problems, ya know?
any animal - JUST like humans themselves - go thru all the emotional
turmoil step by step to acceptance! your cat owned you, now suddenly
there's this little being probably taking up most if not all of your
time! please try and understand where s/he's coming from! and
i assume it's not as if the baby will be left alone at this stage? if
you find additional feces, there's really not a lot to be done to
simply pick it up and flush it away and sponge the area! there's
also the possibility that your cat MIGHT need some behavior
modification - but at this point, that doesn't sound necessary!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> ummmm...excuse me, but isn't that what you're now trying to justify
for yourselves? do you have any idea how many animals are given up by
well-meaning but misinformed parents-to-be? wouldn't it be better for
the cat to have the possibility of new loving owners vs being
KILLED??? i mean, come on! your cat DESERVES to live out the
rest of it's life, even if you're determined it can't be with you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;And who are you to say our basement is not a public area of our house!!! It
&gt;is the centre of attraction at our house. It is our &quot;entertainment&quot; area -

"/> ok, it sounds as if you guys are pretty well off! a quite simple
solution is to restrict the cat's access to your &quot;entertainment area&quot;
by installing a screen door or some louvers. it makes me so sad to
think that there's a cat out there (i know there are LOTS of them)
that is &quot;owned&quot; by someone who wouldn't do all they COULD to try
to make whatever adjustments are needed for peace in their homes!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> sorry, but my husband is foreign and doesn't necessarily know how
things are done over here, so don't get your shorts in a knot! and
speaking of judging, what gives YOU the right to kill your cat, just
because you're unwilling to take the time to assure it that it still
has a place with you and in your heart, and apparently unwilling to
even TRY behavior modification?!?!?!?!!!!!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> afraid i'm with my husband here, tho not in the way you're suggesting
he meant! ALL life is EQUAL, period! i'd wager you used to treat your
cat, as we do, almost like a baby, but now you have a REAL one to
spoil, etc. and the cat is like that old sofa, to be discarded? from
your comments, it certainly doesn't SOUND as if you're doing &quot;all you
can&quot; to keep our happy little home (you don't mind if a take a vomit
break, do you? :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;I was only looking for &quot;suggestions&quot; (not critisism on how we chose to live)
&gt;on what might help to get Jake pooping where he is supposed to. If I'm not
&gt;getting anything but critisism, then there is no sense in even asking!

"/> how you choose to live is none of anyone's concern UNTIL it affects
anyone else - person or animal. i assume you've been alive long enough
to know that not ALL of us follow the mass-consumption lifestyle, and
that having children IS a choice, not what makes you &quot;normal&quot;. if it
takes so little for you to even CONSIDER killing your cat - and that
IS what you would be doing - i submit you don't really deserve to have
such a wonderful, loving life-form! if you don't like that, oh well...

there have been times that one of my cats has started urinating in an
area not of my choosing, and now and again i'd get so angry i'd
actually think about adopting them out. but i simply couldn't do it!
EVERY single one of my cats, and my late, loving cat shadow, were
discards of someone that i'm sure felt they had good justification for
tossing it aside. but all of them give me something that NO human -
not even my husband - can give me! i think of it as &quot;caressing the
tiger&quot; and it is invaluable.

and, come to think of it, the lessons that your child could learn from
such an animal are ALSO invaluable.

please, please THINK ABOUT IT!!!

sherry

p.s.: just a thought - are the two of you keeping the catbox as clean
as it used to be? i mean TRULY? let's face it, a new parent's time is
not his or her own, and chores fall thru the cracks.

pay more attention to the cat, perhaps playing with it while spending
time with your baby, and i think you may find your &quot;problem&quot; solved.

(Husband Dan taking over) I've just been informed about your posts. As
rude as they are and as unwilling as I am to get involved on computer
conversations, I feel compelled to reply to your ignorance. The first
question I have to ask is do you have children? If you do, I can imagine
the feces infested, filthy inhumane house they must live in. I understand
your husband is foreign. I thought he might be more intelligent than he
comes across. In foreign countries, especially Europe, they have spent
hundreds of years battling plagues and inventing better sewer systems to
remove human feces and animal feces from coming in contact and contaminating
water systems, food systems, etc. To try to imagine that we would allow our
new precious life, who depends on our better judgement, to crawl on
carpeting, flooring, etc. contaminated with some kind of fecal content is
ridiculous. I currently have a rule in the house that doesn't even permit
my wife to deficate on the floors - what a world this would be if this was
commonly accepted. Do you have toilets in your house and does your family
deficate all over the house? If so, do you feel this is acceptable?

Sorry for being so crass, I just wanted you to see how it feels if someone
else makes assumptions. Please don't do it again! If you feel you must
continue making assumptions and judgements about other people, without
proper information - don't bother answering the post. I can suggest or find
information for you on manners and culture upgrading.

Jake is MY cat, and I love him dearly. I have had him for over 10 years and
I consider him one of my family, NOT A POSSESSION. To make this more clear
to you, I consider a &quot;watch&quot; a possesion, not an animal. I found Jake in an
autowrecking facility, and I have cared for him with the greatest detail and
attention that I feel can possibly be given to him. To list every detail of
care that we have administered to him to try to convince you that we are
caring owners would be a waste of time. We have spent thousands of dollars
correcting his little mistakes (not an exaggeration)! THat's just the
beginning.

I asked my wife, because of her keen intellect with the computer, to ask
other people on the internet if they have any inventive solutions. We have
called many vets, talked to many people, with no solution to this problem.
I understand, in your previous message, that you think this incident has
only happened twice. Is this another one of your assumptions?

If any one of our animals would deficate on a hard surface on a regular
basis, which does happen with one of our other pets, the solution is clear.
Clean and disinfect the floor. Carpet fibers, unfortunately, are one of the
dirtiest surfaces found in a home. If I could have put a different flooring
in the basement, I would have. But cold basement floors do not lend
themselves well to hard surface floorings.

To address your assumption, again, that we have money pouring out of
closets, we saved for many years and used our RRSP contributions to pay for
the basement retrofit.

If a solution is impossible for my cat, Jake, we have given thought to
finding him a good home. We had a little bit of trouble thinking how we
could advertise this wonderful loving cat. Maybe you can help us. We were
thinking &quot;Beautiful 10 year old tabby. Very gentle. Great housepet. Has
some problems deficating and spraying in houses.&quot; How many calls do you
think we'd get? If we weren't up front with a potention adoption person, my
greatest fear is that they would treat the animal harshly or dump him
somewhere. I don't think I could live with that. Worst case scenario (AND
THIS IS NOT AN OPTION AT PRESENT) would be to put my beloved pet to sleep
and I would be there with him, knowing that I cared for him and that I would
allow NO ONE to mistreat him.

I probably should have answered this question earlier - in regards to the
litter box - we are now currently running dual litter boxes (this means TWO)
and they are checked daily and changed weekly. This IS NOT missed. This
was obviously the first course of action in preventing this occurance.

You should probably know that my wife and myself are advocates in our own
way of animal rights. We are currently known to the people in our area as a
drop-in centre for stray animals. We have saved and relocated MANY animals
in our area at our own expense and we ask for nothing in return. To even
suggest in the slightest way that we do not care for life is asinine.

It's unfortunate that this conversation ever had to take place and that it
had to become so personal. But please do us and the rest of the community a
favour and please stop assuming and dominating the communications with your
witty retorts. We are looking for advice and/or help. If you don't have
any, DON'T ANSWER. I do, however, admire your concern for these little
lives. I do suggest you go about your cause in a less confrontational
manner.

Regards,
Daniel Rohr

"/> No, they do not. However, if an accident occures, we clean and
fumigate any area which may be affected. Such accidents occur
only VERY rarely, mostly as our Flash (our 14yr old Tabby) has
health problems. However, as his quality of life is good, and he is
a loving, sentient being (whilst I had a fever he layed by my head
ALL the time I was bedridden and refused to leave my side (except
for food and toiletries)) we would not dream of KILLING him.

bacteria, unless the animal has an illness himself. The bacteria you
speak of, already exist on your carpet, being brought in on your feet,
etc, and they use the fecal matter as food. They then multiply, and if
ingested cause a problem due to their high numbers. If you cleanse the
area immediately after the cat has deficated on your flooring, and
wipe the area with a mild disinfectant, the bacteria resident in your
carpet will be prevented from multiplying.

The whole point of even bothering responding to you, was to try to show you
how rude you sound. This obviously didn't work. When I began my response,
I told my wife the author must be English - I have a neighbor very much like
you - but he's nice.

As far as your ASSUMPTION (again) of being a typical yuppy American, I am
actually an immigrated German living in CANADA!

Your response still seems to imply that I have a loaded gun aimed at my
cat's head - and as soon as I'm finished writing this I'm going to shoot him
and drive off in my BMW - counting my money and smiling. This is what you
think, isn't it?!

I think the only thing that will come out of this is that you and your wife
will regurgitate these writings like some sort of sport over the dinner
table, concluding that we are cruel yuppy people in America who kill
animals. But meanwhile, in Canada on a quiet night, we will have long
forgotten about you while we watch a quiet movie in our basement, curled up
on the couch with our two cats, one dog and one baby!

If you go back and read the bulletin board, you'll probably find people
(caring people) who responded constructively. (also by personal e-mail)

It's unlikely that someday we would meet. I doubt you would be as bold as
you are in person and if you are, I have to ask, do you have friends?! If
you do consider yourself as having friends, do you think they like you?

This has been entertaining at best. But not helpful.

Daniel Rohr

&lt;kdr ... @mb.sympatico.ca&gt; made me awake from my chaotic existance when
he said:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;The whole point of even bothering responding to you, was to try to show you
&gt;how rude you sound. This obviously didn't work. When I began my response,
&gt;I told my wife the author must be English - I have a neighbor very much like
&gt;you - but he's nice.

"/> Thank you (not)

"/> Nr., deutsche zeigen normalerweise gewehren auf selbst oder leute, die
pacifism, frieden, liebe und das verstehen predigen.

Warum ist es deutsche hat keinen inherrant respekt für irgendeine

"/> I most certainly am. And I have a weariness of germans claiming to
love anything except money, beer and themselves. Ask your British
friend who behaves the worst in Europe at tourist destinations, soccer
games, etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;and if you are, I have to ask, do you have friends?

"/> I most certainly do, but the only german I have EVER liked was
one of the few german jews left on this earth.

jedes feutsche, das ich überhaupt mich getroffen habe, ist concieted
und hat keinen respekt für alles ausgenommen selbst außer einem
arrogant gewesen - und sie war ein Juden

gut sind an, zeigen sie Ihrer katze eine wenig geduld vor Ihnen
praxis, was Ihre landsmänner - euthanasia - dieses ist nicht 1940's

Sie verdienen nicht eine katze
