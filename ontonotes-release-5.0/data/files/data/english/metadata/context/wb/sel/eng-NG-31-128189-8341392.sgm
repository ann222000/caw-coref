things then Alan's plight would somehow be lost on Gazans, but it
wasn't. That's the greatest tribute to him. He wasn't some anonymous
western journalist in Gaza - he was known and, genuinely, I would use
the word &quot;loved&quot;.

&quot;Pandering Won't Be Enough - The endless presidential campaign should
lead to sharp questions on Iranian nukes **&quot;

It is easy for all of them to wave the flag of devotion for Israel.
And it is just as easy for candidates of either party to criticize the
conduct of the war in Iraq. But the crucial question facing the
eventual winner in November 2008 is what they are going to do about
Iran......Will any of them have the mettle to face up to the challenge
and to act to forestall catastrophe? Or will they weakly sit back and
wait for futile diplomacy to defuse a crisis that will already be out
of control?

:: Note the source and the fact that they poopoo the 'futile
diplomacy' we are engaged in with regard to Iran. Just exactly what is
this individual expecting us to do, attack Iran? ::
