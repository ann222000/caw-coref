Hi, I am brand new to this forum, thank you for the opportunity to ask
a question.

I received a Gibson guitar as a hand me down from a relative. It is
small, and I looked up the serial number which I think is a 1963.

I have searched and searched on the web and cannot identify what model
guitar this is. There are no markings inside or around the guitar
other than the serial number and name Gibson.

Any help and or information is most appreciated.

Thanks!
Jamie

Try asking on rec.music.makers.guitar.acoustic. I'm sure someone there will
be able to identify it instantly. I've seen a few of them imported here in
Oz, I think it is called an LG-1 or something like that. It was an economy
guitar, but some of them sound excellent. Could be worth over $1000 in
reasonable condition.

Nice to be appreciated for my efforts finally. I alone invented usenet and
alt.guitar.

It's an LG-0 (zero, not the letter 'o').     They were beginner's guitars,
but are reasonably made.   Mahogany top.   The LG-1 has a spruce top.

It's possible that the bridge on yours has been replaced.     The original
bridge was probably rectangular, and had two pearl dots flanking the bridge
pins - these actually cover bolts.   Many of these guitars got larger,
reverse-curve bridges, like yours has.   Later models may have also had this
larger bridge, some with adjustable saddle.

Here's another 1965 LG-0,  was for sale last year at US$725.

And here's one at Elderly, a 1960 model for US$900
