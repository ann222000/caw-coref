2003 Dodge Caravan w/ 76,500 miles has dead PCM. Dealer is quoting $1100
for repair. This seems very high for unplugging and plugging in a
computer. Can someone please explain the level of work required for this
repair? I understand the PCM is around $450, but why is the install
$650? Also I asked about coverage under the 8/80 Federal Emissions
Regulation and the dealer is denying warrenty coverage, because they are
saying that the problem/diagnoses of the problem did not stem from an
emissions issue. (even though section B of the regulation explicitly
states that manufacture defects/failures are covered)

There is no need to explain the cost. Take and back and tell them to install
one at no charge!!! The PCM is covered under the emssion warranty for
8years/80k miles. Assuming this module has not been altered/or damaged due
to an accident. If you have an owners manual look on the back page for the
toll free number for Chrysler.If you dont have an owners manual go to this
site and download the warranty manual.
http://www.chrysler.com/en/owners/index.html click warranty in the center.

Glenn - thanks for confirming this for me. I called back to the
dealership and spoke with the service manager after posting this
question and got the same story about the failure needing to be linked
to an emissions test failure to be covered and was referred to section
5.2 of the warranty manual for justification of this claim. I tried to
explain to him that's not how the federal regulation or the warranty
manual reads and asked for the general manager of the dealership and was
told he was unavailable. The service manager then quipped that even if
it were covered I was still responsible for a sizeable bill for the
diagnostic work to track the problem to the PCM. Interestingly enough, I
already had a diagnostic test run by a local service center before going
to the dealer and they were able to tell me within an hour that the PCM
was the problem, but they were unable to fix the problem so I had it
towed to the dealership (I didn't inquire as to why I just took the guy
at his word that he couldn't do the repair). I told the dealership when
I dropped off the van what the previous service center has said, but
they still ran their own diagnostic tests anyway. I guess my next call
will be to Chrysler's customer service department

Worst than that. At that price they instal rebuilt PCM because if you dont
give the old one in exchange, they charge you an extra 300$. The price
include the re-programing to your serial number. In fact, it cost to me
1700$ for both PCM and BCM (not sure of the lettres) cause they go in pair.
If you have an anti thief or anti start, disconnect it before doing anything
as it might be it that keep your car from starting. I found that out after
all the repair, as they finaly disconnected it telling me that it was
interfering with the starting even with the new PCM but they could do
nothing as the PCM could not be returned because it has been programed only
for my car.  So I have paid for nothing. I complained directely to Chrysler
and the only answer I got is that they are gone refered my complaint to my
garage.
Hoping you understand well my english as I live in french Québec.
Good luck.
L.G.R.
