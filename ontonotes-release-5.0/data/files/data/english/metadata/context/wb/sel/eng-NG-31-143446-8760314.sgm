Definition:

The Jewish High Holidays, also called the High Holy Days, refer to the ten
day period beginning on _Rosh Hashanah_
( http://judaism.about.com/od/roshhashana/a/all_roshhashana.htm ) Â and ending on _Yom Kippur_
( http://judaism.about.com/od/yomkippu1/a/yk_all.htm ) .

From Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur

Since God judges on Rosh Hashanah and sentences on Yom Kippur, those days and
the days in between are a time of reflection and repentance. Thus, this ten
day period is also known as the Days of Awe (Yamim Noraim) and the Ten Days of
Repentance (Aseret Yamei Tsuvah).

Including Shabbat Shuvah

The Sabbath that takes place between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, during the
Ten Days of Repentance, is called Shabbat Shuvah (Sabbath of Return). This
Sabbath is considered to be an important opportunity for Jews to reflect and
repent before Yom Kippur.

A Time to Repent

It is believed that on Rosh Hashanah, God inscribes us in &quot;books.&quot; God
decides not only whether we will have a good or bad year, but also whether we will
live or die in the upcoming year. Then on Yom Kippur, God seals these &quot;books.&quot;
Thus, on Yom Kippur Jews wish each other a &quot;Good Signing (in the Book of
Life)&quot; (Chatima Tova).

It follows that during the Ten Days of Repentance, the &quot;books&quot; are still
open. God has judged, but not yet passed sentence. Repenting (as well as praying
and giving charity) during the Ten Days of Repentance is the way to reconcile
with God and change His inscription in the &quot;books&quot;. Thus, Jews repent during
the Jewish High Holidays in the hope that God will grant them a good year.
