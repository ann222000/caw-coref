I was wondering how speed and engine running time affects gasoline
mileage. For instance, driving at 60 mph to go from point A to point B
and driving at 25 mph to go the same distance. Would the driving time
that it takes to cover the distance at 25 mph burn more gas than going
the distance at 60 mph? Usually the faster you drive the more gas is
consumed.

Yeah, but at 25 mph yer still in second gear ie if you were in a higher gear
you would travel a longer distance with the same amount of fuel.

On the surface, you'd think "faster burns more fuel" because wind
resistance goes up as the square (or is it the cube? No, I think that's
energy used) of speed.

But its not that simple. Below 60-80 MPH for most cars, you're still on
a fairly flat part of the wind resistance curve so even though the
energy used due to wind resistance is changing as the cube of speed, its
still small compared to rolling resistance and the internal losses in
the drivetrain. What dominates mileage in that case is whether the
engine and transmission are running at their optimum points. For
example, if you're driving so slowly that the transmission can't shift
into overdrive and/or lock its torque convertor, you're wasting more
fuel than you would be by driving a bit faster to get in top gear and
lock the convertor.

Most cars are designed to be efficient in the range of common legal
speeds. IOW, in the US where most speed limits are between 40 and 85 mph
(and 85 is only posted on a few rural interstates) the mileage is
terrible below 20-30 mph, starts climbing as you go up to between 50 and
70 mph, and then falls off very quickly as you go faster than that.

EXCEPT.... valve timing, spark timing, manifold design, etc. sometimes
means that you need to run the engine a little faster than it runs at
the lowest speed you can maintain high gear in order for the engine
itself to be most efficient. But yeah, somewhere near the "bottom" of
your highest gear is generally the most efficient spot to run.

I have to disagree to some extent. Proper gearing is very important,
but a vehicle that is geared too high/low (for the weight, driving
conditions, experience, and etc.) can get worse milage than one that
is geared correctly for the circumstances. For instance: If you are
towing a trailer, being in OD not only hurts the tranny, but also
gives poor gas milage. Why you ask, because you have to open the
throttle and let more gas into the chambers to give you the power
needed to overcome the gearing defect for the conditions.

There are many other factors that are just as important than being in
high gear.

It is a very complex problem and the optimum speed for each brand and
model of car is different.  Here are some of the issues.

Usually the efficiency of an IC engine is maximized at low rpm but
maximum throttle opening.  However, car engines have a problem with
full throttle and low rpm because of drivability (the mixture does
tend to lean out under full throttle.  So most engines have max
efficiency at about 2/3 to 3/4 throttle, again at low rpm.

Aerodynamic drag is the main loss of energy at high speed, but rolling
friction is at low speed.  The exact crossover speed depends on the
streamlining of the car, the tires, bearing design, and vehicle
weight.

Back in the days of the first oil embargo (mid-70s) there were a
number of articles about optimum speeds for various cars.  I seem to
recollect most were in the low 50s.

A low numerical ratio (high gearing) maximizes mpg. In fact, the first
"Mustang MPG" model was merely one with a lower numerical rear axle
ratio.

If you have a stick shift you can maximize fuel economy by short
shifting, picking very low rpm shift points.  Most FI cars can lug
quite well without shaking, which is hard on car.

Mmm.. yes; thanks to you and Steve and Hustlin' Hank for reminding me
that cars use all sorts of power valves and high speed enrichment jets
and fancy fuel/air curves in the FI ECU so that wide open throttle
might not, in reality, be the most efficient engine speed. Although,
having taken apart the carb on my snowblower and found none of those,
I now stipulate that the lowest speed which you can keep in high gear
is the most efficient speed to drive a snowblower, as long as there's
none of that pesky snow to mess up the simple example.

Well, again in THEORY... ;-)

Wide-open throttle at a LOW rpm (basically "lugging" the engine) is
actually very efficient because you get maximum cylinder-filling,
maximum volumetric efficiency, minimum requirement for spark advance,
and low RPM means that you're not actually pumping lots of air/fuel thru
the engine. The engine may reach its absolute peak thermal efficiency at
WOT/high RPM (on the peak of its power curve) but then you don't need
all that power to cruise at 70 mph. And if you designed a car that DID
use 100% of its engine's available power to cruise at 70, it would be
pretty efficient but impossible to drive in the real world because it
would take minutes to get to 70 mph, couldn't climb a hill at 70, and
couldn't merge into traffic.

Only to the point that pumping work (throttling loss) is reduced as MAP
approaches atmospheric pressure. At low-speed the throttle doesn't have
to be even close to fully open to achieve this. The other obvious
benefit of reducing speed is to reduce mechanical friction (rubbing
friction from the bearings, valvetrain and various pumps).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

To reduce throttling losses, one should actually take steps to degrade
VolEff. This would make it easier to get to an unthrottled condition at
lower torque outputs more in line with cruising conditions. This is an
approach used today in many engines with variable cam timing systems.

Minimum spark advance is immaterial. There is no absolute spark timing
goal. Rather, one wants to set the timing so that the maximum torque is
achieved for the particular speed, air-fuel ratio, egr rate and MAP
value. You set spark to achieve optimal combustion phasing where 50% of
the mass is burned at about 8 deg after TDC. The ignition timing setting
to get this doesn't matter.

Nope! WOT is rarely the most efficient in terms of fuel consumption.
Remember, for maximum performance one wants to use up all of the
inducted oxygen to burn fuel. Depending on the particular engine's
in-cylinder mixing, considerable enrichment may be needed to insure that
fuel can find all of the oxygen.

For fuel economy at a fixed speed we want to only use enough fuel hold
that particular vehicle speed. This means the target torque at the
wheels is constant (at the flywheel output too for simplicity's sake).
The goal then is to get rid of as much of the engine parasitic losses as
is possible - pumping losses, mechanical friction, heat transfer, etc.

Hypothetically, sure you could do that (and that, in concept, is similar
to the vehicles that used to participate in the old Shell, IIRC, fuel
economy runs). But, as you point out, that approach would be
unacceptable to just about every vehicle buyer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

How do you figure this to be true? Aero drag power increases with the
cube of speed. Beyond around 40-45 mph, aero drag begins to dominate the
road load requirement.

Nothing says you HAVE to downsize the engine. But, even if you don't
change the engine, a reduction in aero drag will still help improve F.E,
just not as much. If you don't change the mass of the vehicle, then of
course the downsized engine will have poorer acceleration. This is why
so much time and effort is being put into making engines "behave" at
light loads like smaller engines than they really are. (cylinder
deactivation, variable valve timing, etc)

I disagree. Spark advance is used to optimize total power ouput by
making cylinder pressure hit its peak at the optimum point in the crank
ortation, OR in a completely different oprating regime (at part
throttle/low manifold pressure) to act as an efficiency band-aid and
start the slower burn that occurs in a low-pressure cylinder early
enough so that it can mostly complete by the time the exhaust valve
opens. In both of those cases, the price you pay is a big pumping loss
in continuing to compress an already-burning mixture. If you are not in
an operating regime where you need to eke every horsepower that the
engine can produce, you can think differently. If you're trying to
cruise 70 mph and use less than 10% of the engine's maximum power
capability, a very efficient way to do it is to RAISE cylinder pressure
(by opening the throttle and raising manifold pressure) so that the burn
goes rapidly, and LOWER rpm so that you're not extracting a ton of power
(and conincidentally providing more time for the burn to complete before
the exhaust valve opens). In that regime, you can reduce spark advance
and eliminate the associated pumping loss from continuing to compress
the charge as it is already burning.

60 years of economy experiments with aircraft and automobile engines
disagree with you. But perhaps I should say "near WOT" so that a
pedantic assumption of true WOT is not necessary. Back when the Allies
were first experimenting with getting figheter escorts to achieve the
range needed to accompany the bombers to Germany, the answer was to
advance the throttle close to wide open to maximize manifold pressure
(including boost on supercharged engines), but set the prop governor to
lug the engine down to an absurdly low RPM to maintain a reasonable
cruising speed and thus maximize combustion efficiency. The same applies
to auto engines, and while they don't quite hit WOT modern cars when in
top (O/D) gear basically do the same thing. 1500 RPM at 75 mph is
common! Lug the snot out of the engine to maximize cylinder filling,
keep the RPM  down so that the burn more nearly completes before the
exhaust valve opens, and thus extract as much mechanical energy from the
heat as possible. Its not quite "WOT," but the throttle is much further
open than if you took the same engine, put in in a lower gear, and then
adjusted the throttle to cruise at 70.

All true under the caveat you stated of "FOR MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE." I'm
not talking about maximum performance, I'm talking about upping the
efficiency of a car/engine SYSTEM that still retains the ability to
operate in the real world (IOW, has a huge power reserve for passing,
accelerating, merging, etc.) We're not talking about trying to get the
absolute max efficiency out of just the engine, we're talking about
operating a powerful engine at a level on the orderof 10% maximum power
but doing so in the most efficient way possible. Slowing everything down
from 7000 RPM to 1500 RPM changes everything, including providing plenty
of time for the mixture to burn thorougly. Time that DOESN'T exist at
high RPM.

Exactly- which is why high manifold pressure/low RPM operation is so
efficient. Lower pumping loss through less spark advance, hitting your
target torque by operating on the low side of the torque peak, and
getting rid of all the parasitic losses (not the least of which is
crankcase windage) associated with higher-RPM operation.

Maybe I wasn't sufficiently clear, but spark timing is merely the knob
you turn to get the combustion phasing optimized; which by analyzing
over 25 years of in-cylinder pressure data strongly correlates to a 50%
mass fraction burn crank angle of ~8 deg after TDC. It also correlates
to a peak pressure location of about 14 deg ATDC, although the peak
pressure location does have more speed and load dependency. For any
operating condition then, spark is adjusted to achieve best phasing wrt
CA. If you are trying to say setting spark timing close to TDC is always
good for efficiency, then you are wrong.

The standard pumping loss term applies only to the gas exchange portion
of the cycle, exhaust and intake strokes, not late compression stroke.
What you are describing is an increase in compression stroke work due
to combustion initiation and is most commonly categorized as a time-loss
effect. This is a consequence of the fact that combustion is not
instantaneous but spans a range of crank angles. And at low loads burn
duration tends to get longer due to increased residual fraction and
lower in-cylinder gas temperatures.

No, you don't want to necessarily raise cylinder pressure. But you do
want to raise manifold pressure to reduce pumping work. (EGR, Lean burn
if possible, and variable valve timing for example)
Sure, retarding spark while trying to hold load constant will force
you to run higher manifold pressures. But, the cycle inefficiency due to
severely retarded spark will far outweigh the reduction in pumping work.
Also, the retarded spark can also drive exhaust temperatures to
potentially dangerous levels (exhaust valve or catalyst material
temperature limits).

When I see the term WOT, I take it to mean the full load torque vs speed

What you want is high manifold pressures to minimize pumping losses, but
still limit the total trapped air mass to achieve the desired engine
load while maintaining compatibility with emissions aftertreatment
systems (for now, this means running at stoich.). This can be done with
high EGR, variable valve timing (limits trapped mass) or cylinder
deactivation (makes fewer cylinders run at higher loads).

If enough time doesn't exist at high speeds, then how do F1 engines make
900 hp at 19000 rpm from on 3.0 liters of displacement?

Engine burn rates scale nearly linearly with speed. For modern engines
the burn duration in crank degrees only increases slightly with engine
speed. This is reflected in the fairly shallow slope of the MBT spark
vs. speed curve.

Not sure what you mean by this. Do you infer that the light load
efficiency is a function of peak torque (or peak torque speed)? It sure

I think we already agreed that for fuel efficiency, high speed operation
is out of the picture. If you are bringing the ultimate WOT perf. back
in, then sure windage should be considered (and usually is in modern
automotive engines).
