*INTRODUCTION*

Five years ago, I read in the Toronto Star issue of July 3, 1990 an article
titled *&quot;Islam is not alone in patriarchal doctrines&quot;*, by Gwynne Dyer. The
article described the furious reactions of the participants of a conference
on women and power held in Montreal to the comments of the famous Egyptian
feminist Dr. Nawal Saadawi. Her &quot;politically incorrect&quot; statements included:
&quot;the most restrictive elements towards women can be found first in Judaism
in the Old Testament then in Christianity and then in the Qur'an&quot;; &quot;all
religions are patriarchal because they stem from patriarchal societies&quot;; and
&quot;veiling of women is not a specifically Islamic practice but an ancient
cultural heritage with analogies in sister religions&quot;. The participants
could not bear sitting around while their faiths were being equated with
Islam. Thus, Dr. Saadawi received a barrage of criticism. &quot;Dr. Saadawi's
comments are unacceptable. Her answers reveal a lack of understanding about
other people's faiths,&quot; declared Bernice Dubois of the World Movement of
Mothers. &quot;I must protest&quot; said panellist Alice Shalvi of Israel's women
network, &quot;there is no conception of the veil in Judaism.&quot; The article
attributed these furious protests to the strong tendency in the West to
scapegoat Islam for practices that are just as much a part of the West's own
cultural heritage. &quot;Christian and Jewish feminists were not going to sit
around being discussed in the same category as those wicked Muslims,&quot; wrote
Gwynne Dyer.

I was not surprised that the conference participants had held such a
negative view of Islam, especially when women's issues were involved. In the
West, Islam is believed to be the symbol of the subordination of women par
excellence. In order to understand how firm this belief is, it is enough to
mention that the Minister of Education in France, the land of Voltaire, has
recently ordered the expulsion of all young Muslim women wearing the veil
from French schools! [*The Globe and Mail*, Oct. 4, 1994.] A young Muslim
student wearing a headscarf is denied her right of education in France,
while a Catholic student wearing a cross or a Jewish student wearing a
skullcap is not. The scene of French policemen preventing young Muslim women
wearing headscarves from entering their high school is unforgettable. It
inspires the memories of another equally disgraceful scene of Governor
George Wallace of Alabama in 1962 standing in front of a school gate trying
to block the entrance of black students in order to prevent the
desegregation of Alabama's schools. The difference between the two scenes is
that the black students had the sympathy of so many people in the U.S. and
in the whole world. President Kennedy sent the U.S. National Guard to force
the entry of the black students. The Muslim girls, on the other hand,
received no help from any one. Their cause seems to have very little
sympathy either inside or outside France. The reason is the widespread
misunderstanding and fear of anything Islamic in the world today.

What intrigued me the most about the Montreal conference was one question:
Were the statements made by Saadawi, or any of her critics, factual ? In
other words, do Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have the same conception of
women? Are they different in their conceptions ? Do Judaism and Christianity
, truly, offer women a better treatment than Islam does? What is the truth?

It is not easy to search for and find answers to these difficult questions.
The first difficulty is that one has to be fair and objective or, at least,
do one's utmost to be so. This is what Islam teaches. The Qur'an has
instructed Muslims to say the truth even if those who are very close to them
do not like it:

*&quot;Whenever you speak, speak justly, even if a near relative is concerned.&quot;*[
*Al-Qur'an* 6:152]

*&quot;O you who believe stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah,
even as against yourselves, or your parents or your kin, and whether it be
(against) rich or poor.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an* 4:135]

The other great difficulty is the overwhelming breadth of the subject.
Therefore, during the last few years, I have spent many hours reading the
Bible, The Encyclopaedia of Religion, and the Encyclopaedia Judaica
searching for answers. I have also read several books discussing the
position of women in different religions written by scholars, apologists,
and critics. The material presented in the following chapters represents the
important findings of this humble research. I don't claim to be absolutely
objective. This is beyond my limited capacity. All I can say is that I have
been trying, throughout this research, to approach the Qur'anic ideal of
&quot;speaking justly&quot;.

I would like to emphasize in this introduction that my purpose for this
study is not to denigrate Judaism or Christianity. As Muslims, we believe in
the divine origins of both. No one can be a Muslim without believing in
Moses and Jesus as great prophets of God. My goal is only to vindicate Islam
and pay a tribute, long overdue in the West, to the final truthful Message
from God to the human race. I would also like to emphasize that I concerned
myself only with Doctrine. That is, my concern is, mainly, the position of
women in the three religions as it appears in their original sources not as
practised by their millions of followers in the world today. Therefore, most
of the evidence cited comes from the Qur'an, the sayings of Prophet
Muhammad, the Bible, the Talmud, and the sayings of some of the most
influential Church Fathers whose views have contributed immeasurably to
defining and shaping Christianity. This interest in the sources relates to
the fact that understanding a certain religion from the attitudes and the
behaviour of some of its nominal followers is misleading. Many people
confuse culture with religion, many others do not know what their religious
books are saying, and many others do not even care.

*EVE'S FAULT*

The three religions agree on one basic fact: Both women and men are created
by God, The Creator of the whole universe. However, disagreement starts soon
after the creation of the first man, Adam, and the first woman, Eve. The
Judaeo-Christian conception of the creation of Adam and Eve is narrated in
detail in Genesis 2:4-3:24. God prohibited both of them from eating the
fruits of the forbidden tree. The serpent seduced Eve to eat from it and
Eve, in turn, seduced Adam to eat with her. When God rebuked Adam for what
he did, he put all the blame on Eve, &quot;The woman you put here with me - she
gave me some fruit from the tree and I ate it.&quot; Consequently, God said to
Eve:

&quot;I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing; with pain you will give
birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband and he will rule
over you.&quot;

To Adam He said:

&quot;Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree .... Cursed is the
ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days
of your life ... &quot;

The Islamic conception of the first creation is found in several places in
the Qur'an, for example:

*&quot;O Adam dwell with your wife in the Garden and enjoy as you wish but
approach not this tree or you run into harm and transgression. Then Satan
whispered to them in order to reveal to them their shame that was hidden
from them and he said: 'Your Lord only forbade you this tree lest you become
angels or such beings as live forever.' And he swore to them both that he
was their sincere adviser. So by deceit he brought them to their fall: when
they tasted the tree their shame became manifest to them and they began to
sew together the leaves of the Garden over their bodies. And their Lord
called unto them: 'Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you that Satan
was your avowed enemy?' They said: 'Our Lord we have wronged our own souls
and if You forgive us not and bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall
certainly be lost' &quot;* [*Al-Qur'an *7:19:23]

A careful look into the two accounts of the story of the Creation reveals
some essential differences. The Qur'an, contrary to the Bible, places equal
blame on both Adam and Eve for their mistake. Nowhere in the Qur'an can one
find even the slightest hint that Eve tempted Adam to eat from the tree or
even that she had eaten before him. Eve in the Qur'an is no temptress, no
seducer, and no deceiver. Moreover, Eve is not to be blamed for the pains of
childbearing. God, according to the Qur'an, punishes no one for another's
faults. Both Adam and Eve committed a sin and then asked God for forgiveness
and He forgave them both.

*EVE'S LEGACY*

The image of Eve as temptress in the Bible has resulted in an extremely
negative impact on women throughout the Judaeo-Christian tradition. All
women were believed to have inherited from their mother, the Biblical Eve,
both her guilt and her guile. Consequently, they were all untrustworthy,
morally inferior, and wicked. Menstruation, pregnancy, and childbearing were
considered the just punishment for the eternal guilt of the cursed female
sex. In order to appreciate how negative the impact of the Biblical Eve was
on all her female descendants we have to look at the writings of some of the
most important Jews and Christians of all time. Let us start with the Old
Testament and look at excerpts from what is called the Wisdom Literature in
which we find:

&quot;I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a
trap and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God will escape her,
but the sinner she will ensnare....while I was still searching but not
finding, I found one upright man among a thousand but not one upright woman
among them all.&quot; [Ecclesiastes 7:26-28]

In another part of the Hebrew literature which is found in the Catholic
Bible we read:

&quot;No wickedness comes anywhere near the wickedness of a woman.....Sin began
with a woman and thanks to her we all must die.&quot; [Ecclesiasticus 25:19,24]

Jewish Rabbis listed nine curses inflicted on women as a result of the Fall:

&quot;To the woman He gave nine curses and death: the burden of the blood of
menstruation and the blood of virginity; the burden of pregnancy; the burden
of childbirth; the burden of bringing up the children; her head is covered
as one in mourning; she pierces her ear like a permanent slave or slave girl
who serves her master; she is not to be believed as a witness; and after
everything--death.&quot; [Leonard J. Swidler, *Women in Judaism: the Status of
Women in Formative Judaism*, Metuchen, N.J: Scarecrow Press, 1976, p. 115]

To the present day, orthodox Jewish men in their daily morning prayer
recite:

&quot;Blessed be God King of the universe that Thou has not made me a woman.&quot;

The women, on the other hand, thank God every morning for, &quot;making me
according to Thy will.&quot; [Thena Kendath, *Memories of an Orthodox youth* in
Susannah Heschel, ed. *On being a Jewish Feminist*, New York: Schocken
Books, 1983, pp. 96-97]

Another prayer found in many Jewish prayer books:

&quot;Praised be God that he has not created me a gentile. Praised be God that he
has not created me a woman. Praised be God that he has not created me an
ignoramus.&quot; [Swidler, op. cit., pp. 80-81]

The Biblical Eve has played a far bigger role in Christianity than in
Judaism. Her sin has been pivotal to the whole Christian faith because the
Christian conception of the reason for the mission of Jesus Christ on Earth
stems from Eve's disobedience to God. She had sinned and then seduced Adam
to follow her suit. Consequently, God expelled both of them from Heaven to
Earth, which had been cursed because of them. They bequeathed their sin,
which had not been forgiven by God, to all their descendants and, thus, all
humans are born in sin. In order to purify human beings from their 'original
sin', God had to sacrifice Jesus, who is considered to be the Son of God, on
the cross. Therefore, Eve is responsible for her own mistake, her husband's
sin, the original sin of all humanity, and the death of the Son of God. In
other words, one woman acting on her own caused the fall of humanity.
[Rosemary R. Ruether, *Christianity*, in Arvind Sharma, ed., *Women in World
Religions*, Albany: State University of New York Press, 1987, p. 209] What
about her daughters? They are sinners like her and have to be treated as
such. Listen to the severe tone of St. Paul in the New Testament:

&quot;A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I don't permit a
woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam
was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the
woman who was deceived and became a sinner.&quot; [I Timothy 2:11-14]

St. Tertullian was even more blunt than St. Paul, while he was talking to
his *'best beloved sisters'* in the faith, he said:

&quot;Do you not know that you are each an Eve? The sentence of God on this sex
of yours lives in this age: the guilt must of necessity live too. You are
the Devil's gateway: You are the unsealer of the forbidden tree: You are the
first deserter of the divine law: You are she who persuaded him whom the
devil was not valiant enough to attack. You destroyed so easily God's image,
man. On account of your desert even the Son of God had to die.&quot;

[For all the sayings of the prominent Saints, see Karen Armstrong, *The
Gospel According to Woman*, London: Elm Tree Books, 1986, pp. 52-62. See
also Nancy van Vuuren, *The Subversion of Women as Practiced by Churches,
Witch-Hunters, and Other Sexists*, Philadelphia: Westminister Press, pp.
28-30]

St. Augustine was faithful to the legacy of his predecessors, he wrote to a
friend:

&quot;What is the difference whether it is in a wife or a mother, it is still Eve
the temptress that we must beware of in any woman ... I fail to see what use
woman can be to man, if one excludes the function of bearing children.&quot;

Centuries later, St. Thomas Aquinas still considered women as defective:

&quot;As regards the individual nature, woman is defective and misbegotten, for
the active force in the male seed tends to the production of a perfect
likeness in the masculine sex; while the production of woman comes from a
defect in the active force or from some material indisposition, or even from
some external influence.&quot;

Finally, the renowned reformer Martin Luther could not see any benefit from
a woman but bringing into the world as many children as possible regardless
of any side effects:

&quot;If they become tired or even die, that does not matter. Let them die in
childbirth, that's why they are there.&quot;

Again and again all women are denigrated because of the image of Eve the
temptress, thanks to the Genesis account. To sum up, the Judaeo-Christian
conception of women has been poisoned by the belief in the sinful nature of
Eve and her female offspring.

If we now turn our attention to what the Qur'an has to say about women, we
will soon realize that the Islamic conception of women is radically
different from the Judaeo-Christian one. Let the Qur'an speak for itself:

*&quot;For Muslim men and women, for believing men and women, for devout men and
women, for true men and women, for men and women who are patient, for men
and women who humble themselves, for men and women who give in charity, for
men and women who fast, for men and women who guard their chastity, and for
men and women who engage much in Allah's praise. For them all has Allah
prepared forgiveness and great reward.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an *33:35]

*&quot;The believers, men and women, are protectors, one of another: they enjoin
what is just, and forbid what is evil, they observe regular prayers,
practise regular charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger. On them will
Allah pour His Mercy: for Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an *
9:71]

*&quot;And their Lord answered them: Truly I will never cause to be lost the work
of any of you, Be you a male or female, you are members one of
another.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an
*3:195]

*&quot;Whoever works evil will not be requited but by the like thereof, and
whoever works a righteous deed -whether man or woman- and is a believer-
such will enter the Garden of Bliss.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an *40:40]

*&quot;Whoever works righteousness, man or woman, and has faith, verily to
him/her we will give a new life that is good and pure, and we will bestow on
such their reward according to the best of their actions.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an *
16:97]

It is clear that the Qur'anic view of women is no different than that of
men. They, both, are God's creatures whose sublime goal on earth is to
worship their Lord, do righteous deeds, and avoid evil and they, both, will
be assessed accordingly. The Qur'an never mentions that the woman is the
devil's gateway or that she is a deceiver by nature. The Qur'an, also, never
mentions that man is God's image; all men and all women are his creatures,
that is all. According to the Qur'an, a woman's role on earth is not limited
only to childbirth. She is required to do as many good deeds as any other
man is required to do. The Qur'an never says that no upright women have ever
existed. To the contrary, the Qur'an has instructed all the believers, women
as well as men, to follow the example of those ideal women such as the
Virgin Mary and the Pharoah's wife:

*&quot;And Allah sets forth, As an example to those who believe, the wife of
Pharaoh: Behold she said: 'O my lord build for me, in nearness to you, a
mansion in the Garden, and save me from Pharaoh and his doings and save me
from those who do wrong.' And Mary the daughter of Imran who guarded her
chastity and We breathed into her body of Our spirit; and she testified to
the truth of the words of her Lord and of His revelations and was one of the
devout.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an *66:11-13]

*SHAMEFUL DAUGHTERS*

In fact, the difference between the Biblical and the Qur'anic attitude
towards the female sex starts as soon as a female is born. For example, the
Bible states that the period of the mother's ritual impurity is twice as
long if a girl is born than if a boy is (Lev. 12:2-5). The Catholic Bible
states explicitly that:

&quot;The birth of a daughter is a loss.&quot; [Ecclesiasticus 22:3]

In contrast to this shocking statement, boys receive special praise:

&quot;A man who educates his son will be the envy of his enemy.&quot; [Ecclesiasticus
30:3]

Jewish Rabbis made it an obligation on Jewish men to produce offspring in
order to propagate the race. At the same time, they did not hide their clear
preference for male children:

&quot;It is well for those whose children are male but ill for those whose are
female&quot;,

&quot;At the birth of a boy, all are joyful...at the birth of a girl all are
sorrowful&quot;, and

&quot;When a boy comes into the world, peace comes into the world ... When a girl
comes, nothing comes.&quot; [Swidler, op. cit., p. 140]

A daughter is considered a painful burden, a potential source of shame to
her father:

&quot;Your daughter is headstrong? Keep a sharp look-out that she does not make
you the laughing stock of your enemies, the talk of the town, the object of
common gossip, and put you to public shame.&quot; [Ecclesiasticus 42:11]

&quot;Keep a headstrong daughter under firm control, or she will abuse any
indulgence she receives. Keep a strict watch on her shameless eye, do not be
surprised if she disgraces you.&quot; [Ecclesiasticus 26:10-11]

It was this very same idea of treating daughters as sources of shame that
led the pagan Arabs, before the advent of Islam, to practice female
infanticide. The Qur'an severely condemned this heinous practice:

*&quot;When news is brought to one of them of the birth of a female child, his
face darkens and he is filled with inward grief. With shame does he hide
himself from his people because of the bad news he has had! Shall he retain
her on contempt or bury her in the dust? Ah! what an evil they decide on?&quot;*[
*Al-Qur'an* 16:59]

It has to be mentioned that this sinister crime would have never stopped in
Arabia were it not for the power of the scathing terms the Qur'an used to
condemn this practice [in verse 16:59, 43:17 and 81:8-9]. The Qur'an,
moreover, makes no distinction between boys and girls. In contrast to the
Bible, the Qur'an considers the birth of a female as a gift and a blessing
from God, the same as the birth of a male. The Qur'an even mentions the gift
of the female birth first:

&quot; To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He creates
what He wills. He bestows female children to whomever He wills and bestows
male children to whomever He wills&quot; [*Al-Qur'an* 42:49]

In order to wipe out all the traces of female infanticide in the nascent
Muslim society, Prophet Muhammad promised those who were blessed with
daughters of a great reward if they would bring them up kindly:

*&quot;He who is involved in bringing up daughters, and accords benevolent
treatment towards them, they will be protection for him against
Hell-Fire.&quot;*[Agreed upon]

*&quot;Whoever maintains two girls till they attain maturity, he and I will come
on the Resurrection Day like this; and he joined his fingers.&quot;* [Recorded by
*Imam* Muslim]

*FEMALE EDUCATION*

The difference between the Biblical and the Qur'anic conceptions of women is
not limited to the newly born female, it extends far beyond that. Let us
compare their attitudes towards a female trying to learn her religion. The
heart of Judaism is the Torah, the law. However, according to the
Talmud, &quot;women
are exempt from the study of the Torah.&quot; Some Jewish Rabbis firmly declared,
&quot;let the words of Torah rather be destroyed by fire than imparted to women&quot;,
and &quot;whoever teaches his daughter Torah is as though he taught her
obscenity.&quot; [Denise L. Carmody, *Judaism*, in *Arvind Sharma*, ed., op.
cit., p. 197]

The attitude of St. Paul in the New Testament is not brighter:

&quot;As in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in
the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission as
the law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their
own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the
church.&quot; [I Corinthians 14:34-35]

How can a woman learn if she is not allowed to speak? How can a woman grow
intellectually if she is obliged to be in a state of full submission? How
can she broaden her horizons if her one and only source of information is
her husband at home?

Now, to be fair, we should ask: is the Qur'anic position any different? One
short story narrated in the Qur'an sums its position up concisely. Khawlah
was a Muslim woman whose husband Aws pronounced this statement at a moment
of anger: &quot;You are to me as the back of my mother.&quot; This was held by pagan
Arabs to be a statement of divorce which freed the husband from any conjugal
responsibility but did not leave the wife free to leave the husband's home
or to marry another man. Having heard these words from her husband, Khawlah
was in a miserable situation. She went straight to the Prophet of Islam to
plead her case. The Prophet was of the opinion that she should be patient
since there seemed to be no way out. Khawla kept arguing with the Prophet in
an attempt to save her suspended marriage. Shortly, the Qur'an intervened;
Khawla's plea was accepted. The divine verdict abolished this iniquitous
custom. One full chapter (Chapter 58) of the Qur'an whose title is *
al-Mujadilah* or &quot;The woman who is arguing&quot; was named after this incident:

*&quot;Allah has heard and accepted the statement of the woman who pleads with
you (the Prophet) concerning her husband and carries her complaint to Allah,
and Allah hears the arguments between both of you for Allah hears and sees
all things ... &quot;* [*Al-Qur'an* 58:1]

A woman in the Qur'anic conception has the right to argue even with the
Prophet of Islam himself. No one has the right to instruct her to be silent.
She is under no obligation to consider her husband the one and only
reference in matters of law and religion.

*UNCLEAN IMPURE WOMEN*

Jewish laws and regulations concerning menstruating women are extremely
restrictive. The Old Testament considers any menstruating woman as unclean
and impure. Moreover, her impurity &quot;infects&quot; others as well. Anyone or
anything she touches becomes unclean for a day:

&quot;When a woman has her regular flow of blood, the impurity of her monthly
period will last seven days, and anyone who touches her will be unclean till
evening. Anything she lies on during her period will be unclean, and
anything she sits on will be unclean. Whoever touches her bed must wash his
clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening. Whoever
touches anything she sits on must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and
he will be unclean till evening. Whether it is the bed or anything she was
sitting on, when anyone touches it, he will be unclean till evening.&quot; [Lev.
15:19-23]

Due to her &quot;contaminating&quot; nature, a menstruating woman was sometimes
&quot;banished&quot; in order to avoid any possibility of any contact with her. She
was sent to a special house called &quot;the house of uncleanness&quot; for the whole
period of her impurity. [Swidler, op. cit., p. 137]

The Talmud considers a menstruating woman &quot;fatal&quot; even without any physical
contact:

&quot;Our Rabbis taught: ... if a menstruating woman passes between two (men), if
it is at the beginning of her menses she will slay one of them, and if it is
at the end of her menses she will cause strife between them.&quot; [bPes. 111a.]

Furthermore, the husband of a menstruating woman was forbidden to enter the
synagogue if he had been made unclean by her even by the dust under her
feet. A priest whose wife, daughter, or mother was menstruating could not
recite priestly blessing in the synagogue. [Ibid., p. 138]

It is of no wonder that many Jewish women still refer to menstruation as
&quot;the curse.&quot; [Sally Priesand, Judaism and the New Woman (New York: Behrman
House, Inc., 1975) p. 24]

Islam does not consider a menstruating woman to possess any kind of
&quot;contagious uncleanness&quot;. She is neither &quot;untouchable&quot; nor &quot;cursed.&quot; She
practises her normal life with only one restriction: A married couple are
not allowed to have sexual intercourse during the period of menstruation.
Any other physical contact between them is permissible. A menstruating woman
is exempted from some rituals such as daily prayers and fasting during her
period.

*BEARING WITNESS*

Another issue in which the Qur'an and the Bible disagree is the issue of
women bearing witness. It is true that the Qur'an has instructed the
believers dealing in financial transactions to get two male witnesses or one
male and two females [2:282]. However, it is also true that the Qur'an in
other situations accepts the testimony of a woman as equal to that of a man.
In fact the woman's testimony can even invalidate the man's. If a man
accuses his wife of unchastity, he is required by the Qur'an to solemnly
swear five times as evidence of the wife's guilt. If the wife denies and
swears similarly five times, she is not considered guilty and in either case
the marriage is dissolved [24:6-11].

On the other hand, women were not allowed to bear witness in early Jewish
society. [Swidler, op. cit., p. 115] The Rabbis counted women's not being
able to bear witness among the nine curses inflicted upon all women because
of the Fall (see the &quot;Eve's Legacy&quot; section). Women in today's Israel are
not allowed to give evidence in Rabbinical courts. [Lesley Hazleton, *Israeli
Women The Reality Behind the Myths*, New York: Simon and Schuster, 1977, p.
41] The Rabbis justify why women cannot bear witness by citing Genesis
18:9-16, where it is stated that Sara, Abraham's wife had lied. The Rabbis
use this incident as evidence that women are unqualified to bear witness. It
should be noted here that this story narrated in Genesis 18:9-16 has been
mentioned more than once in the Qur'an without any hint of any lies by Sara
(11:69-74, 51:24-30). In the Christian West, both ecclesiastical and civil
law debarred women from giving testimony until late last century. [Gage, op.
cit. p. 142]

If a man accuses his wife of unchastity, her testimony will not be
considered at all according to the Bible. The accused wife has to be
subjected to a trial by ordeal. In this trial, the wife faces a complex and
humiliating ritual which was supposed to prove her guilt or innocence [Num.
5:11-31]. If she is found guilty after this ordeal, she will be sentenced to
death. If she is found not guilty, her husband will be innocent of any
wrongdoing.

Besides, if a man takes a woman as a wife and then accuses her of not being
a virgin, her own testimony will not count. Her parents had to bring
evidence of her virginity before the elders of the town. If the parents
could not prove the innocence of their daughter, she would be stoned to
death on her father's doorsteps. If the parents were able to prove her
innocence, the husband would only be fined one hundred shekels of silver and
he could not divorce his wife as long as he lived:

&quot;If a man takes a wife and, after lying with her, dislikes her and slanders
her and gives her a bad name, saying, 'I married this woman, but when I
approached her, I did not find proof of her virginity,' then the girl's
father and mother shall bring proof that she was a virgin to the town elders
at the gate. The girl's father will say to the elders, 'I gave my daughter
in marriage to this man, but he dislikes her. Now he has slandered her and
said I did not find your daughter to be a virgin. But here is the proof of
my daughter's virginity.' Then her parents shall display the cloth before
the elders of the town, and the elders shall take the man and punish him.
They shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give them to the girl's
father, because this man has given an Israelite virgin a bad name. She shall
continue to be his wife; he must not divorce her as long as he lives. If,
however, the charge is true and no proof of the girl's virginity can be
found, she shall be brought to the door of her father's house and there the
men of the town shall stone her to death. She has done a disgraceful thing
in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her father's house. You must
purge the evil from among you.&quot; [Deuteronomy 22:13-21]

*ADULTERY*

Adultery is considered a sin in all religions. The Bible decrees the death
sentence for both the adulterer and the adulteress [Lev. 20:10]. Islam also
equally punishes both the adulterer and the adulteress [24:2]. However, the
Qur'anic definition of adultery is very different from the Biblical
definition. Adultery, according to the Qur'an, is the involvement of a
married man or a married woman in an extramarital affair. The Bible only
considers the extramarital affair of a married woman as adultery [Leviticus
20:10, Deuteronomy 22:22, Proverbs 6:20-7:27].

&quot;If a man is found sleeping with another man's wife, both the man who slept
with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel.&quot; [Deut.
22:22]

&quot;If a man commits adultery with another man's wife both the adulterer and
the adulteress must be put to death.&quot; [Lev. 20:10]

According to the Biblical definition, if a married man sleeps with an
unmarried woman, this is not considered a crime at all. The married man who
has extramarital affairs with unmarried women is not an adulterer and the
unmarried women involved with him are not adulteresses. The crime of
adultery is committed only when a man, whether married or single, sleeps
with a married woman. In this case the man is considered adulterer, even if
he is not married, and the woman is considered adulteress. In short,
adultery is any illicit sexual intercourse involving a married woman. The
extramarital affair of a married man is not per se a crime in the Bible. Why
is the dual moral standard? According to *Encyclopaedia Judaica*, the wife
was considered to be the husband's possession and adultery constituted a
violation of the husband's exclusive right to her; the wife as the husband's
possession had no such right to him. [Jeffrey H. Togay, &quot;Adultery&quot;,
*Encyclopaedia
Judaica*, Vol. II, col. 313. Also, see Judith Plaskow, *Standing Again at
Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective*, New York: Harper &amp; Row
Publishers, 1990, pp. 170-177] That is, if a man had sexual intercourse with
a married woman, he would be violating the property of another man and,
thus, he should be punished.

To the present day in Israel, if a married man indulges in an extramarital
affair with an unmarried woman, his children by that woman are considered
legitimate. But, if a married woman has an affair with another man, whether
married or not married, her children by that man are not only illegitimate
but they are considered bastards and are forbidden to marry any other Jews
except converts and other bastards. This ban is handed down to the
children's descendants for 10 generations until the taint of adultery is
presumably weakened. [Hazleton, op. cit., pp. 41-42]

The Qur'an, on the other hand, never considers any woman to be the
possession of any man. The Qur'an eloquently describes the relationship
between the spouses by saying:

*&quot;And among His signs is that He created for you mates from among
yourselves, that you may dwell in tranquillity with them and He has put love
and mercy between your hearts: verily in that are signs for those who
reflect.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an* 30:21]

This is the Qur'anic conception of marriage: love, mercy, and tranquillity,
not possession and double standards.

*VOWS*

According to the Bible, a man must fulfil any vows he might make to God. He
must not break his word. On the other hand, a woman's vow is not necessarily
binding on her. It has to be approved by her father, if she is living in his
house, or by her husband, if she is married. If a father/husband does not
endorse his daughter's/wife's vows, all pledges made by her become null and
void:

&quot;But if her father forbids her when he hears about it, none of her vows or
the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand ... Her husband may
confirm or nullify any vow she makes or any sworn pledge to deny
herself.&quot;[Num. 30:2-15]

Why is it that a woman's word is not binding per se? The answer is simple:
because she is owned by her father, before marriage, or by her husband after
marriage. The father's control over his daughter was absolute to the extent
that, should he wish, he could sell her! It is indicated in the writings of
the Rabbis that:

&quot;The man may sell his daughter, but the woman may not sell her daughter; the
man may betroth his daughter, but the woman may not betroth her daughter.&quot;
[Swidler, op. cit., p. 141]

The Rabbinic literature also indicates that marriage represents the transfer
of control from the father to the husband: &quot;betrothal, making a woman the
sacrosanct possession - the inviolable property - of the husband ... &quot;
Obviously, if the woman is considered to be the property of someone else,
she cannot make any pledges that her owner does not approve of.

It is of interest to note that this Biblical instruction concerning women's
vows has had negative repercussions on Judaeo-Christian women till early in
this century. A married woman in the Western world had no legal status. No
act of hers was of any legal value. Her husband could repudiate any
contract, bargain, or deal she had made. Women in the West (the largest heir
of the Judaeo-Christian legacy) were held unable to make a binding contract
because they were practically owned by someone else. Western women had
suffered for almost two thousand years because of the Biblical attitude
towards women's position vis-à-vis their fathers and husbands. [Matilda J.
Gage, *Woman, Church, and State*, New York: Truth Seeker Company, 1893, p.
141]

In Islam, the vow of every Muslim, male or female, is binding on him/her. No
one has the power to repudiate the pledges of anyone else. Failure to keep a
solemn oath, made by a man or a woman, has to be expiated as indicated in
the Qur'an:

*&quot;He [God] will call you to account for your deliberate oaths: for
expiation, feed ten indigent persons, on a scale of the average for the food
of your families; Or clothe them; or give a slave his freedom. If that is
beyond your means, fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths
you have sworn. But keep your oaths.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an* 5:89]

Companions of the Prophet Muhammad, men and women, used to present their
oath of allegiance to him personally. Women, as well as men, would
independently come to him and pledge their oaths:

*&quot;O Prophet, When believing women come to you to make a covenant with you
that they will not associate in worship anything with God, nor steal, nor
fornicate, nor kill their own children, nor slander anyone, nor disobey you
in any just matter, then make a covenant with them and pray to God for the
forgiveness of their sins. Indeed God is Forgiving and most Merciful.&quot;* [*
Al-Qur'an* 60:12]

A man could not swear the oath on behalf of his daughter or his wife. Nor
could a man repudiate the oath made by any of his female relatives.

*WIFE'S PROPERTY*

The three religions share an unshakeable belief in the importance of
marriage and family life. They also agree on the leadership of the husband
over the family. Nevertheless, blatant differences do exist among the three
religions with respect to the limits of this leadership. The
Judaeo-Christian tradition, unlike Islam, virtually extends the leadership
of the husband into ownership of his wife.

The Jewish tradition regarding the husband's role towards his wife stems
from the conception that he owns her as he owns his slave. [Louis M.
Epstein, *The Jewish Marriage Contract*, New York: Arno Press, 1973, p. 149]
This conception has been the reason behind the double standard in the laws
of adultery and behind the husband's ability to annul his wife's vows. This
conception has also been responsible for denying the wife any control over
her property or her earnings. As soon as a Jewish woman got married, she
completely lost any control over her property and earnings to her husband.
Jewish Rabbis asserted the husband's right to his wife's property as a
corollary of his possession of her:

&quot;Since one has come into the possession of the woman does it not follow that
he should come into the possession of her property too?&quot;, and

&quot;Since he has acquired the woman should he not acquire also her property?&quot;
[Swidler, op. cit., p. 142]

Thus, marriage caused the richest woman to become practically penniless. The
Talmud describes the financial situation of a wife as follows:

&quot;How can a woman have anything; whatever is hers belongs to her husband?
What is his is his and what is hers is also his ... her earnings and what
she may find in the streets are also his. The household articles, even the
crumbs of bread on the table, are his. Should she invite a guest to her
house and feed him, she would be stealing from her husband ... &quot; [San. 71a,
Git. 62a]

The fact of the matter is that the property of a Jewish female was meant to
attract suitors. A Jewish family would assign their daughter a share of her
father's estate to be used as a dowry in case of marriage. It was this dowry
that made Jewish daughters an unwelcome burden to their fathers. The father
had to raise his daughter for years and then prepare for her marriage by
providing a large dowry. Thus, a girl in a Jewish family was a liability and
no asset. [Epstein, op. cit., pp. 164-165]

This liability explains why the birth of a daughter was not celebrated with
joy in the old Jewish society (see the &quot;Shameful Daughters?&quot; section). The
dowry was the wedding gift presented to the groom under terms of tenancy.
The husband would act as the practical owner of the dowry but he could not
sell it. The bride would lose any control over the dowry at the moment of
marriage. Moreover, she was expected to work after marriage and all her
earnings had to go to her husband in return for her maintenance which was
his obligation. She could regain her property only in two cases: divorce or
her husband's death. Should she die first, he would inherit her property. In
the case of the husband's death, the wife could regain her pre-marital
property but she was not entitled to inherit any share in her deceased
husband's own property. It has to be added that the groom also had to
present a marriage gift to his bride, yet again he was the practical owner
of this gift as long as they were married. [Ibid., pp. 112-113. See also
Priesand, op. cit., p. 15]

Christianity, until recently, has followed the same Jewish tradition. Both
religious and civil authorities in the Christian Roman Empire (after
Constantine) required a property agreement as a condition for recognizing
the marriage. Families offered their daughters increasing dowries and, as a
result, men tended to marry earlier while families postponed their
daughters' marriages until later than had been customary. [James A.
Brundage, *Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe*, Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1987, p. 88]

Under Canon law, a wife was entitled to restitution of her dowry if the
marriage was annulled unless she was guilty of adultery. In this case, she
forfeited her right to the dowry which remained in her husband's hands.
[Ibid., p. 480]

Under Canon and civil law a married woman in Christian Europe and America
had lost her property rights until late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. For example, women's rights under English law were compiled and
published in 1632. These 'rights' included: &quot;That which the husband hath is
his own. That which the wife hath is the husband's.&quot; [R. Thompson, *Women in
Stuart England and America*, London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1974, p. 162]

The wife not only lost her property upon marriage, she lost her personality
as well. No act of her was of legal value. Her husband could repudiate any
sale or gift made by her as being of no binding legal value. The person with
whom she had any contract was held as a criminal for participating in a
fraud. Moreover, she could not sue or be sued in her own name, nor could she
sue her own husband. [Mary Murray, *The Law of the Father*, London:
Routledge, 1995, p. 67]

A married woman was practically treated as an infant in the eyes of the law.
The wife simply belonged to her husband and therefore she lost her property,
her legal personality, and her family name. [Gage, op. cit., p. 143]

Islam, since the seventh century C.E., has granted married women the
independent personality which the Judaeo-Christian West had deprived them
until very recently. In Islam, the bride and her family are under no
obligation whatsoever to present a gift to the groom. The girl in a Muslim
family is no liability. A woman is so dignified by Islam that she does not
need to present gifts in order to attract potential husbands. It is the
groom who must present the bride with a marriage gift. This gift is
considered her property and neither the groom nor the bride's family have
any share in or control over it. In some Muslim societies today, a marriage
gift of a hundred thousand dollars in diamonds is not unusual (for example,
see Jeffrey Lang, *Struggling to Surrender*, Beltsville, MD: Amana
Publications, 1994, p. 167) The bride retains her marriage gifts even if she
is later divorced. The husband is not allowed any share in his wife's
property except what she offers him with her free consent. [Elsayyed Sabiq,
*Fiqh al Sunnah*, Cairo: Darul Fatah lile'lam Al-Arabi, 11th edition, 1994,
vol. 2, pp. 218-229]

The Qur'an has stated its position on this issue quite clearly:

*&quot;And give the women (on marriage) their dower as a free gift; but if they,
Of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it and enjoy
it with right good cheer.&quot;* (4:4)

The wife's property and earnings are under her full control and for her use
alone since her, and the children's, maintenance is her husband's
responsibility. [Abdel-Haleem Abu Shuqqa, *Tahreer al Mar'aa fi Asr al
Risala*, Kuwait: Dar al Qalam, 1990, pp. 109-112]

No matter how rich the wife might be, she is not obliged to act as a
co-provider for the family unless she herself voluntarily chooses to do so.
Spouses do inherit from one another. Moreover, a married woman in Islam
retains her independent legal personality and her family name. [Leila
Badawi, &quot;Islam&quot;, in Jean Holm and John Bowker, ed., *Women in Religion*,
London: Pinter Publishers, 1994, p. 102]

An American judge once commented on the rights of Muslim women saying:

&quot;A Muslim girl may marry ten times, but her individuality is not absorbed by
that of her various husbands. She is a solar planet with a name and legal
personality of her own.&quot; [Amir H. Siddiqi, *Studies in Islamic History*,
Karachi: Jamiyatul Falah Publications, 3rd edition, 1967, p. 138]

*DIVORCE*

The three religions have remarkable differences in their attitudes towards
divorce. Christianity abhors divorce altogether. The New Testament
unequivocally advocates the indissolubility of marriage. It is attributed to
Jesus to have said:

&quot;But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital
unfaithfulness, causes her to become adulteress, and anyone who marries the
divorced woman commits adultery.&quot; [Matthew 5:32]

This uncompromising ideal is, without a doubt, unrealistic. It assumes a
state of moral perfection that human societies have never achieved. When a
couple realizes that their married life is beyond repair, a ban on divorce
will not do them any good. Forcing ill-mated couples to remain together
against their wills is neither effective nor reasonable. No wonder the whole
Christian world has been obliged to sanction divorce.

Judaism, on the other hand, allows divorce even without any cause. The Old
Testament gives the husband the right to divorce his wife even if he just
dislikes her:

&quot;If a man marries a woman who becomes displeasing to him because he finds
something indecent about her, and he writes her a certificate of divorce,
gives it to her and sends her from his house, and if after she leaves his
house she becomes the wife of another man, and her second husband dislikes
her and writes her a certificate of divorce, gives it to her and sends her
from his house, or if he dies, then her first husband, who divorced her, is
not allowed to marry her again after she has been defiled.&quot; [Deut. 24:1-4]

The above verses have caused some considerable debate among Jewish scholars
because of their disagreement over the interpretation of the words
&quot;displeasing&quot;, &quot;indecency&quot;, and &quot;dislikes&quot; mentioned in the verses. The
Talmud records their different opinions:

&quot;The school of Shammai held that a man should not divorce his wife unless he
has found her guilty of some sexual misconduct, while the school of Hillel
say he may divorce her even if she has merely spoiled a dish for him. Rabbi
Akiba says he may divorce her even if he simply finds another woman more
beautiful than she.&quot; [Gittin 90a-b]

The New Testament follows the Shammaites opinion while Jewish law has
followed the opinion of the Hillelites and R. Akiba. [Epstein, op. cit., p.
196]

Since the Hillelites view prevailed, it became the unbroken tradition of
Jewish law to give the husband freedom to divorce his wife without any cause
at all. The Old Testament not only gives the husband the right to divorce
his &quot;displeasing&quot; wife, it considers divorcing a &quot;bad wife&quot; an obligation:

&quot;A bad wife brings humiliation, downcast looks, and a wounded heart. Slack
of hand and weak of knee is the man whose wife fails to make him happy.
Woman is the origin of sin, and it is through her that we all die. Do not
leave a leaky cistern to drip or allow a bad wife to say what she likes. If
she does not accept your control, divorce her and send her
away.&quot;[Ecclesiasticus 25:25]

The Talmud has recorded several specific actions by wives which obliged
their husbands to divorce them:

&quot;If she ate in the street, if she drank greedily in the street, if she
suckled in the street, in every case Rabbi Meir says that she must leave her
husband.&quot; [Git. 89a]

The Talmud has also made it mandatory to divorce a barren wife (who bore no
children in a period of ten years):

&quot;Our Rabbis taught: If a man took a wife and lived with her for ten years
and she bore no child, he shall divorce her.&quot; [Yeb. 64a]

Wives, on the other hand, cannot initiate divorce under Jewish law. A Jewish
wife, however, could claim the right to a divorce before a Jewish court
provided that a strong reason exists. Very few grounds are provided for the
wife to make a claim for a divorce. These grounds include: A husband with
physical defects or skin disease, a husband not fulfilling his conjugal
responsibilities, etc. The Court might support the wife's claim to a divorce
but it cannot dissolve the marriage. Only the husband can dissolve the
marriage by giving his wife a bill of divorce. The Court could scourge,
fine, imprison, and excommunicate him to force him to deliver the necessary
bill of divorce to his wife. However, if the husband is stubborn enough, he
can refuse to grant his wife a divorce and keep her tied to him
indefinitely. Worse still, he can desert her without granting her a divorce
and leave her unmarried and undivorced. He can marry another woman or even
live with any single woman out of wedlock and have children from her (these
children are considered legitimate under Jewish law). The deserted wife, on
the other hand, cannot marry any other man since she is still legally
married and she cannot live with any other man because she will be
considered an adulteress and her children from this union will be
illegitimate for ten generations. A woman in such a position is called an *
agunah* (chained woman, pl. *agunot*). [Swidler, op. cit., pp. 162-163]

In the United States today there are approximately 1000 to 1500 Jewish women
who are *agunot*, while in Israel their number might be as high as 16000.
Husbands may extort thousands of dollars from their trapped wives in
exchange for a Jewish divorce. [*The Toronto Star*, Apr. 8, 1995]

Islam occupies the middle ground between Christianity and Judaism with
respect to divorce. Marriage in Islam is a sanctified bond that should not
be broken except for compelling reasons. Couples are instructed to pursue
all possible remedies whenever their marriages are in danger. Divorce is not
to be resorted to except when there is no other way out. In a nutshell,
Islam recognizes divorce, yet it discourages it by all means. Let us focus
on the recognition side first. Islam does recognize the right of both
partners to end their matrimonial relationship. Islam gives the husband the
right for *talaq* (divorce). Moreover, Islam, unlike Judaism, grants the
wife the right to dissolve the marriage through what is known as *khula'* -
if the husband dissolves the marriage by divorcing his wife, he cannot
retrieve any of the marriage gifts he has given her. [Sabiq, op. cit., pp.
318-329. See also Muhammad al Ghazali,* Qadaya al Mar'a bin al Taqalid al
Rakida wal Wafida*, Cairo: Dar al Shorooq, 4th edition, 1992, pp. 178-180]

The Qur'an explicitly prohibits the divorcing husbands from taking back
their marriage gifts no matter how expensive or valuable these gifts might
be:

*&quot;But if you decide to take one wife in place of another, even if you had
given the latter a whole treasure for dower, take not the least bit of it
back; Would you take it by slander and a manifest wrong?&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an *
4:20]

In the case of the wife choosing to end the marriage, she may return the
marriage gifts to her husband. Returning the marriage gifts in this case is
a fair compensation for the husband who is keen to keep his wife while she
chooses to leave him. The Qur'an has instructed Muslim men not to take back
any of the gifts they have given to their wives except in the case of the
wife choosing to dissolve the marriage:

*&quot;It is not lawful for you (Men) to take back any of your gifts except when
both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by
Allah. There is no blame on either of them if she give something for her
freedom. These are the limits ordained by Allah so do not transgress them.&quot;*[
*Al-Qur'an* 2:229]

Also, a woman came to the Prophet Muhammad seeking the dissolution of her
marriage, she told the Prophet that she did not have any complaints against
her husband's character or manners. Her only problem was that she honestly
did not like him to the extent of not being able to live with him any
longer. The Prophet asked her: *&quot;Would you give him his garden (the marriage
gift he had given her) back?&quot;* she said: &quot;Yes&quot;. The Prophet then instructed
the man to take back his garden and accept the dissolution of the marriage.
[Recorded by *Imam* al-Bukhari]

In some cases, A Muslim wife might be willing to keep her marriage but find
herself obliged to claim for a divorce because of some compelling reasons
such as: Cruelty of the husband, desertion without a reason, a husband not
fulfilling his conjugal responsibilities, etc. In these cases the Muslim
court dissolves the marriage. [Ibid., pp. 313-318]

In short, Islam has offered the Muslim woman some unequalled rights: she can
end the marriage through *khula'* and she can sue for a divorce. A Muslim
wife can never become chained by a recalcitrant husband. It was these rights
that enticed Jewish women who lived in the early Islamic societies of the
seventh century C.E. to seek to obtain bills of divorce from their Jewish
husbands in Muslim courts. The Rabbis declared these bills null and void. In
order to end this practice, the Rabbis gave new rights and privileges to
Jewish women in an attempt to weaken the appeal of the Muslim courts. Jewish
women living in Christian countries were not offered any similar privileges
since the Roman law of divorce practiced there was no more attractive than
the Jewish law. [David W. Amram, *The Jewish Law of Divorce According to
Bible and Talmud*, Philadelphia: Edward Stern &amp; CO., Inc., 1896, pp.
125-126]

Let us now focus our attention on how Islam discourages divorce. The Prophet
of Islam told the believers that:

*&quot; ... among all the permitted acts, divorce is the most hateful to God.&quot;* [
*Abu Dawud*]

A Muslim man should not divorce his wife just because he dislikes her. The
Qur'an instructs Muslim men to be kind to their wives even in cases of
lukewarm emotions or feelings of dislike:

*&quot;Live with them (your wives) on a footing of kindness and equity. If you
dislike them it may be that you dislike something in which Allah has placed
a great deal of good.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an* 4:19]

Prophet Muhammad gave a similar instruction:

*&quot;A believing man must not hate a believing woman. If he dislikes one of her
traits he will be pleased with another.&quot;* [*Muslim*]

The Prophet has also emphasized that the best Muslims are those who are best
to their wives:

*&quot;The believers who show the most perfect faith are those who have the best
character and the best of you are those who are best to their wives.&quot;* [*
Tirmidhi*]

However, Islam is a practical religion and it does recognize that there are
circumstances in which a marriage becomes on the verge of collapsing. In
such cases, a mere advice of kindness or self restraint is no viable
solution. So, what to do in order to save a marriage in these cases? The
Qur'an offers some practical advice for the spouse (husband or wife) whose
partner (wife or husband) is the wrongdoer. For the husband whose wife's
ill-conduct is threatening the marriage, the Qur'an gives four types of
advice as detailed in the following verses:

*&quot;As to those women on whose part you fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, (1)
Admonish them, (2) refuse to share their beds, (3) beat them; but if they
return to obedience seek not against them means of annoyance: For Allah is
Most High, Great. (4) If you fear a break between them, appoint two
arbiters, one from his family and the other from hers; If they wish for
peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation.&quot;* [Al-Qur'an 4:34-35]

The first three are to be tried first. If they fail, then the help of the
families concerned should be sought. It has to be noted, in the light of the
above verses, that beating the rebellious wife is a temporary measure that
is resorted to as third in line in cases of extreme necessity in hopes that
it might remedy the wrongdoing of the wife. If it does, the husband is not
allowed by any means to continue any annoyance to the wife as explicitly
mentioned in the verse. If it does not, the husband is still not allowed to
use this measure any longer and the final avenue of the family-assisted
reconciliation has to be explored.

The Prophet Muhammad has instructed Muslim husbands that they should not
have recourse to these measures except in extreme cases such as open
lewdness committed by the wife. Even in these cases the punishment should be
slight and if the wife desists, the husband is not permitted to irritate
her:

*&quot;In case they are guilty of open lewdness you may leave them alone in their
beds and inflict slight punishment. If they are obedient to you, do not seek
against them any means of annoyance.&quot;* [*Tirmidhi*]

Furthermore, the Prophet of Islam has condemned any unjustifiable beating.
Some Muslim wives complained to him that their husbands had beaten them.
Hearing that, the Prophet categorically stated that:

*&quot;Those who do so (beat their wives) are not the best among you.&quot;* [*Abu
Dawud*]

It has to be remembered at this point that the Prophet has also said:

*&quot;The best of you is he who is best to his family, and I am the best among
you to my family.&quot;* [*Tirmidhi*]

The Prophet advised one Muslim woman, whose name was Fatimah bint Qais, not
to marry a man because the man was known for beating women:

&quot;I went to the Prophet and said: Abul Jahm and Mu'awiah have proposed to
marry me. The Prophet (by way of advice) said: *As to Mu'awiah he is very
poor and Abul Jahm is accustomed to beating women*.&quot; [*Muslim*]

It has to be noted that the Talmud sanctions wife beating as chastisement
for the purpose of discipline. [Epstein, op. cit., p. 219]

The husband is not restricted to the extreme cases such as those of open
lewdness. He is allowed to beat his wife even if she just refuses to do her
house work. Moreover, he is not limited only to the use of light punishment.
He is permitted to break his wife's stubbornness by the lash or by starving
her. [Ibid, pp 156-157]

For the wife whose husband's ill-conduct is the cause for the marriage's
near collapse, the Qur'an offers the following advice:

*&quot;If a wife fears cruelty or desertion on her husband's part, there is no
blame on them if they arrange an amicable settlement between themselves; and
such settlement is best.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an* 4:128]

In this case, the wife is advised to seek reconciliation with her husband
(with or without family assistance). It is notable that the Qur'an is not
advising the wife to resort to the two measures of abstention from sex and
beating. The reason for this disparity might be to protect the wife from a
violent physical reaction by her already misbehaving husband. Such a violent
physical reaction will do both the wife and the marriage more harm than
good. Some Muslim scholars have suggested that the court can apply these
measures against the husband on the wife's behalf. That is, the court first
admonishes the rebellious husband, then forbids him his wife's bed, and
finally executes a symbolic beating. [Muhammad Abu Zahra, *Usbu al Fiqh al
Islami*, Cairo: al Majlis al A'la li Ri'ayat al Funun, 1963, p. 66]

To sum up, Islam offers Muslim married couples much viable advice to save
their marriages in cases of trouble and tension. If one of the partners is
jeopardizing the matrimonial relationship, the other partner is advised by
the Qur'an to do whatever possible and effective in order to save this
sacred bond. If all the measures fail, Islam allows the partners to separate
peacefully and amicably.

*MOTHERS*

The Old Testament in several places commands kind and considerate treatment
of the parents and condemns those who dishonor them. For example:

&quot;If anyone curses his father or mother, he must be put to death,&quot; [Lev.
20:9] and,

&quot;A wise man brings joy to his father but a foolish man despises his
mother.&quot;[Proverbs 15:20]

Although honoring the father alone is mentioned in some places, e.g. &quot;A wise
man heeds his father's instruction&quot; [Proverbs 13:1], the mother alone is
never mentioned. Moreover, there is no special emphasis on treating the
mother kindly as a sign of appreciation of her great suffering in
childbearing and suckling. Besides, mothers do not inherit at all from their
children while fathers do. [Epstein, op. cit., p. 122]

It is difficult to speak of the New Testament as a scripture that calls for
honoring the mother. To the contrary, one gets the impression that the New
Testament considers kind treatment of mothers as an impediment on the way to
God. According to the New Testament, one cannot become a good Christian
worthy of becoming a disciple of Christ unless he hates his mother. It is
attributed to Jesus to have said:

&quot;If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and
children, his brothers and sisters - yes, even his own life - he can not be
my disciple.&quot; [Luke 14:26]

Furthermore, the New Testament depicts a picture of Jesus as indifferent to,
or even disrespectful of, his own mother. For example, when she had come
looking for him while he was preaching to a crowd, he did not care to go out
to see her:

&quot;Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent
someone to call him. A crowd was sitting around him and they told him, 'Your
mother and brothers are outside looking for you.' 'Who are my mother and my
brothers?' he asked. Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him
and said,' Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does God's will is my
brother and sister and mother.' &quot; [Mark 3:31-35]

One might argue that Jesus was trying to teach his audience an important
lesson that religious ties are no less important than family ties. However,
he could have taught his listeners the same lesson without showing such
absolute indifference to his mother. The same disrespectful attitude is
depicted when he refused to endorse a statement made by a member of his
audience blessing his mother's role in giving birth to him and nursing him:

&quot;As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, 'Blessed
is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.' He replied, 'Blessed
rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.' &quot; [Luke 11:27-28]

If a mother with the stature of the virgin Mary had been treated with such
discourtesy, as depicted in the New Testament, by a son of the stature of
Jesus Christ, then how should an average Christian mother be treated by her
average Christian sons?

In Islam, the honor, respect, and esteem attached to motherhood is
unparalleled. The Qur'an places the importance of kindness to parents as
second only to worshipping God Almighty:

*&quot;Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, And that you be kind
to parents. Whether one or both of them attain old age in your life, Say not
to them a word of contempt, nor repel them, But address them in terms of
honor. And out of kindness, Lower to them the wing of humility, and say: 'My
Lord! bestow on them Your Mercy as they Cherished me in childhood.' &quot;*
[*Al-Qur'an
*17:23-24]

The Qur'an in several other places puts special emphasis on the mother's
great role in giving birth and nursing:

*&quot;And We have enjoined on man to be good to his parents: In travail upon
travail did his mother bear him and in two years was his weaning. Show
gratitude to Me and to your parents.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an *31:14]

The very special place of mothers in Islam has been eloquently described by
Prophet Muhammad:

&quot;A man asked the Prophet: 'Whom should I honor most?' The Prophet
replied: *'Your
mother'*. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: *'Your
mother'*. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: *'Your
mother!'*. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: *'Your
father.'* &quot; [Agreed upon]

Among the few precepts of Islam which Muslims still faithfully observe to
the present day is the considerate treatment of mothers. The honor that
Muslim mothers receive from their sons and daughters is exemplary. The
intensely warm relations between Muslim mothers and their children and the
deep respect with which Muslim men approach their mothers usually amaze
Westerners. [Armstrong, op. cit., p. 8]

*FEMALE INHERITANCE*

One of the most important differences between the Qur'an and the Bible is
their attitude towards female inheritance of the property of a deceased
relative. The Biblical attitude has been succinctly described by Rabbi
Epstein:

&quot;The continuous and unbroken tradition since the Biblical days gives the
female members of the household, wife and daughters, no right of succession
to the family estate. In the more primitive scheme of succession, the female
members of the family were considered part of the estate and as remote from
the legal personality of an heir as the slave. Whereas by Mosaic enactment
the daughters were admitted to succession in the event of no male issue
remained, the wife was not recognized as heir even in such conditions.&quot;
[Epstein, op. cit., p. 175]

Why were the female members of the family considered part of the family
estate? Rabbi Epstein has the answer:

&quot;They are owned - before marriage, by the father; after marriage, by the
husband.&quot; [Ibid., p. 121]

The Biblical rules of inheritance are outlined in Numbers 27:1-11. A wife is
given no share in her husband's estate, while he is her first heir, even
before her sons. A daughter can inherit only if no male heirs exist. A
mother is not an heir at all while the father is. Widows and daughters, in
case male children remained, were at the mercy of the male heirs for
provision. That is why widows and orphan girls were among the most destitute
members of the Jewish society.

Christianity has followed suit for long time. Both the ecclesiastical and
civil laws of Christendom barred daughters from sharing with their brothers
in the father's patrimony. Besides, wives were deprived of any inheritance
rights. These iniquitous laws survived till late in the last century. [Gage,
op. cit., p. 142]

Among the pagan Arabs before Islam, inheritance rights were confined
exclusively to the male relatives. The Qur'an abolished all these unjust
customs and gave all the female relatives inheritance shares:

*&quot;From what is left by parents and those nearest related there is a share
for men and a share for women, whether the property be small or large - a
determinate share.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an* 4:7]

Muslim mothers, wives, daughters, and sisters had received inheritance
rights thirteen hundred years before Europe recognized that these rights
even existed. The division of inheritance is a vast subject with an enormous
amount of details (4:7,11,12,176). The general rule is that the female share
is half the male's except the cases in which the mother receives equal share
to that of the father. This general rule if taken in isolation from other
legislations concerning men and women may seem unfair. In order to
understand the rationale behind this rule, one must take into account the
fact that the financial obligations of men in Islam far exceed those of
women (see the &quot;Wife's property?&quot; section). A bridegroom must provide his
bride with a marriage gift. This gift becomes her exclusive property and
remains so even if she is later divorced. The bride is under no obligation
to present any gifts to her groom. Moreover, the Muslim husband is charged
with the maintenance of his wife and children. The wife, on the other hand,
is not obliged to help him in this regard. Her property and earnings are for
her use alone except what she may voluntarily offer her husband. Besides,
one has to realize that Islam vehemently advocates family life. It strongly
encourages youth to get married, discourages divorce, and does not regard
celibacy as a virtue. Therefore, in a truly Islamic society, family life is
the norm and single life is the rare exception. That is, almost all
marriage-aged women and men are married in an Islamic society. In light of
these facts, one would appreciate that Muslim men, in general, have greater
financial burdens than Muslim women and thus inheritance rules are meant to
offset this imbalance so that the society lives free of all gender or class
wars. After a simple comparison between the financial rights and duties of
Muslim women, one British Muslim woman has concluded that Islam has treated
women not only fairly but generously. [B. Aisha Lemu and Fatima Heeren, *Woman
in Islam*, London: Islamic Foundation, 1978, p. 23]

*PLIGHT OF WIDOWS*

Because of the fact that the Old Testament recognized no inheritance rights
to them, widows were among the most vulnerable of the Jewish population. The
male relatives who inherited all of a woman's deceased husband's estate were
to provide for her from that estate. However, widows had no way to ensure
this provision was carried out, and lived on the mercy of others. Therefore,
widows were among the lowest classes in ancient Israel and widowhood was
considered a symbol of great degradation (Isaiah 54:4). But the plight of a
widow in the Biblical tradition extended even beyond her exclusion from her
husband's property. According to Genesis 38, a childless widow must marry
her husband's brother, even if he is already married, so that he can produce
offspring for his dead brother, thus ensuring his brother's name will not
die out.

&quot;Then Judah said to Onan, 'Lie with your brother's wife and fulfil your duty
to her as a brother-in-law to produce offspring for your brother.'
&quot;[Genesis 38:8]

The widow's consent to this marriage is not required. The widow is treated
as part of her deceased husband's property whose main function is to ensure
her husband's posterity. This Biblical law is still practiced in today's
Israel. [Hazleton, op. cit., pp. 45-46]

A childless widow in Israel is bequeathed to her husband's brother. If the
brother is too young to marry, she has to wait until he comes of age. Should
the deceased husband's brother refuse to marry her, she is set free and can
then marry any man of her choice. It is not an uncommon phenomenon in Israel
that widows are subjected to blackmail by their brothers-in-law in order to
gain their freedom.

The pagan Arabs before Islam had similar practices. A widow was considered a
part of her husband's property to be inherited by his male heirs and she
was, usually, given in marriage to the deceased man's eldest son from
another wife. The Qur'an scathingly attacked and abolished this degrading
custom:

*&quot;And marry not women whom your fathers married - except what is past - it
was shameful, odious, and abominable custom indeed.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an *4:22]

Widows and divorced women were so looked down upon in the Biblical tradition
that the high priest could not marry a widow, a divorced woman, or a
prostitute:

&quot;The woman he (the high priest) marries must be a virgin. He must not marry
a widow, a divorced woman, or a woman defiled by prostitution, but only a
virgin from his own people, so he will not defile his offspring among his
people.&quot; [Lev. 21:13-15]

In Israel today, a descendant of the Cohen caste (the high priests of the
days of the Temple) cannot marry a divorcee, a widow, or a prostitute. In
the Jewish legislation, a woman who has been widowed three times with all
the three husbands dying of natural causes is considered 'fatal' and
forbidden to marry again. [Ibid., pp. 47 &amp; 49]

The Qur'an, on the other hand, recognizes neither castes nor fatal persons.
Widows and divorcees have the freedom to marry whomever they choose. There
is no stigma attached to divorce or widowhood in the Qur'an:

*&quot;When you divorce women and they fulfil their terms [three menstruation
periods] either take them back on equitable terms or set them free on
equitable terms; But do not take them back to injure them or to take undue
advantage. If anyone does that, he wrongs his own soul. Do not treat Allah's
signs as a jest.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an *2:231]

*&quot;If any of you die and leave widows behind, they shall wait four months and
ten days. When they have fulfilled their term, there is no blame on you if
they dispose of themselves in a just manner.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an *2:234]

*&quot;Those of you who die and leave widows should bequeath for their widows a
year's maintenance and residence. But if they [the widows] leave (the
residence) there is no blame on you for what they justly do with
themselves.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an *2:240]

*POLYGAMY*

Let us now tackle the important question of polygamy. Polygamy is a very
ancient practice found in many human societies. The Bible did not condemn
polygamy. To the contrary, the Old Testament and Rabbinic writings
frequently attest to the legality of polygamy. King Solomon is said to have
had 700 wives and 300 concubines (1 Kings 11:3). Also, King David is said to
have had many wives and concubines (2 Samuel 5:13). The Old Testament does
have some injunctions on how to distribute the property of a man among his
sons from different wives (Deut. 22:7). The only restriction on polygamy is
a ban on taking a wife's sister as a rival wife (Lev. 18:18). The Talmud
advises a maximum of four wives. [Swidler, op. cit., pp. 144-148]

European Jews continued to practice polygamy until the sixteenth century.
Oriental Jews regularly practiced polygamy until they arrived in Israel
where it is forbidden under civil law. However, under religious law which
overrides civil law in such cases, it is permissible. [Hazleton, op. cit.,
pp 44-45]

What about the New Testament? According to Father Eugene Hillman in his
insightful book, *Polygamy Reconsidered*:

&quot;Nowhere in the New Testament is there any explicit commandment that
marriage should be monogamous or any explicit commandment forbidding
polygamy.&quot; [Eugene Hillman, *Polygamy Reconsidered: African Plural Marriage
and the Christian Churches*, New York: Orbis Books, 1975, p. 140]

Moreover, Jesus has not spoken against polygamy though it was practiced by
the Jews of his society. Father Hillman stresses the fact that the Church in
Rome banned polygamy in order to conform to the Greco-Roman culture (which
prescribed only one legal wife while tolerating concubines and
prostitution). He cited St. Augustine:

&quot;Now indeed in our time, and in keeping with Roman custom, it is no longer
allowed to take another wife.&quot; [Ibid., p. 17]

African churches and African Christians often remind their European brothers
that the Church's ban on polygamy is a cultural tradition and not an
authentic Christian injunction.

The Qur'an, too, allowed polygamy, but not without restrictions:

*&quot;If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans,
marry women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you
shall not be able to deal justly with them, then only one.&quot;* [*Al-Qur'an*4:3]

The Qur'an, contrary to the Bible, limited the maximum number of wives to
four under the strict condition of treating the wives equally and justly. It
should not be understood that the Qur'an is exhorting the believers to
practice polygamy, or that polygamy is considered as an ideal. In other
words, the Qur'an has &quot;tolerated&quot; or &quot;allowed&quot; polygamy, and no more, but
why? Why is polygamy permissible ? The answer is simple: there are places
and times in which there are compelling social and moral reasons for
polygamy. As the above Qur'anic verse indicates, the issue of polygamy in
Islam cannot be understood apart from community obligations towards orphans
and widows. Islam as a universal religion suitable for all places and all
times could not ignore these compelling obligations.

In most human societies, females outnumber males. In the U.S. there are, at
least, eight million more women than men. In a country like Guinea there are
122 females for every 100 males. In Tanzania, there are 95.1 males per 100
females. What should a society do towards such unbalanced sex ratios? There
are various solutions, some might suggest celibacy, others would prefer
female infanticide (which does happen in some societies in the world
today!). Others may think the only outlet is that the society should
tolerate all manners of sexual permissiveness: prostitution, sex out of
wedlock, homosexuality, etc. For other societies , like most African
societies today, the most honorable outlet is to allow polygamous marriage
as a culturally accepted and socially respected institution. The point that
is often misunderstood in the West is that women in other cultures do not
necessarily look at polygamy as a sign of women's degradation. For example,
many young African brides , whether Christians or Muslims or otherwise,
would prefer to marry a married man who has already proved himself to be a
responsible husband. Many African wives urge their husbands to get a second
wife so that they do not feel lonely. [Ibid., pp. 88-97]

A survey of over six thousand women, ranging in age from 15 to 59, conducted
in the second largest city in Nigeria showed that 60 percent of these women
would be pleased if their husbands took another wife. Only 23 percent
expressed anger at the idea of sharing with another wife. Seventy-six
percent of the women in a survey conducted in Kenya viewed polygamy
positively. In a survey undertaken in rural Kenya, 25 out of 27 women
considered polygamy to be better than monogamy. These women felt polygamy
can be a happy and beneficial experience if the co-wives cooperate with each
other. [Philip L. Kilbride, *Plural Marriage For Our Times*, Westport,
Conn.: Bergin &amp; Garvey, 1994, pp. 108-109]

Polygamy in most African societies is such a respectable institution that
some Protestant churches are becoming more tolerant of it. A bishop of the
Anglican Church in Kenya declared that:

&quot;Although monogamy may be ideal for the expression of love between husband
and wife, the church should consider that in certain cultures polygyny is
socially acceptable and that the belief that polygyny is contrary to
Christianity is no longer tenable.&quot; [*The Weekly Review*, Aug. 1, 1987]

After a careful study of African polygamy, Reverend David Gitari of the
Anglican Church has concluded that polygamy, as ideally practiced, is more
Christian than divorce and remarriage as far as the abandoned wives and
children are concerned. [Kilbride, op. cit., p. 126]

I personally know of some highly educated African wives who, despite having
lived in the West for many years, do not have any objections against
polygamy. One of them, who lives in the U.S., solemnly exhorts her husband
to get a second wife to help her in raising the kids.

The problem of the unbalanced sex ratios becomes truly problematic at times
of war. Native American Indian tribes used to suffer highly unbalanced sex
ratios after wartime losses. Women in these tribes, who in fact enjoyed a
fairly high status, accepted polygamy as the best protection against
indulgence in indecent activities. European settlers, without offering any
other alternative, condemned this Indian polygamy as 'uncivilised'. [John
D'Emilio and Estelle B. Freedman, *Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality
in America*, New York: Harper &amp; Row Publishers, 1988, p. 87]

After the Second World War, there were 7,300,000 more women than men in
Germany (3.3 million of them were widows). There were 100 men aged 20 to 30
for every 167 women in that age group. Many of these women needed a man not
only as a companion but also as a provider for the household in a time of
unprecedented misery and hardship. The soldiers of the victorious Allied
Armies exploited these women's vulnerability. Many young girls and widows
had liaisons with members of the occupying forces. Many American and British
soldiers paid for their pleasures in cigarettes, chocolate, and bread.
Children were overjoyed at the gifts these strangers brought. A 10 year old
boy on hearing of such gifts from other children wished from all his heart
for an 'Englishman' for his mother so that she need not go hungry any
longer. [Ute Frevert, *Women in German History: from Bourgeois Emancipation
to Sexual Liberation*, New York: Berg Publishers, 1988, pp. 263-264 &amp;
257-258]

We have to ask our own conscience at this point: What is more dignifying to
a woman? An accepted and respected second wife as in the native Indians'
approach, or a virtual prostitute as in the 'civilised' Allies approach? In
other words, what is more dignifying to a woman, the Qur'anic prescription
or the theology based on the culture of the Roman Empire?

It is interesting to note that in an international youth conference held in
Munich in 1948 the problem of the highly unbalanced sex ratio in Germany was
discussed. When it became clear that no solution could be agreed upon, some
participants suggested polygamy. The initial reaction of the gathering was a
mixture of shock and disgust. However, after a careful study of the
proposal, the participants agreed that it was the only possible solution.
Consequently, polygamy was included among the conference final
recommendations. [Sabiq, op. cit., p. 191]

The world today possesses more weapons of mass destruction than ever before
and the European churches might, sooner or later, be obliged to accept
polygamy as the only way out. Father Hillman has thoughtfully recognized
this fact:

&quot;It is quite conceivable that these genocidal techniques (nuc
