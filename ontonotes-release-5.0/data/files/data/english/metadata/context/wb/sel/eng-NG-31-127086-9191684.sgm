Dear Blinded,

I never had one, mostly from doing a lot of reading up on them. Firstly, the
advantages. You never have to remember taking another pill again. You may
still need something for a bad flare up, but most of your pain needs are
covered. The amount of medication needed going directly in to the spinal
canal is tiny compared to what you would take orally for the same results.
They usually use a mix of some type of steroid and morphine and/or dilaudid.
There's also another medication called Prialt (generic zinconitide) that's
only for the pump. I've heard both ways on that med, so it's probably all in
dosing. Dosing also determines how often you'll have to go in and get it
refilled. Could be monthly, could be every couple of months. It's like
getting a shot where ever the pump is at (usually around the belly area, but
they can put them anyplace in that general area. I may be leaving out an
advantage or two, but I don't think anything major. The big deal of it all
is the bigger effect for the much smaller amount of medication.
The disadvantages. Outside of the obvious malfunctioning of the unit where
it OD's you massively or gives you nothing, there's battery life. They have
to go in and surgically replace it. They make it sound like no big deal, but
surgery is surgery. When I was looking at them they battery life was
anywhere from 3-5 years. Now they're supposed to have it up to 5-8 years.
The tubing from the pump can come disconnected, again going back in to fix,
which ever end comes loose.
Now I am going to lay this on you but I want to be sure that this is
hearsay. We had a poster in here about 2 years ago, using the handle Dr.
Shame. You can go back and google him but I forget exactly how he spelled
it. He was/claimed to be both a pain specialist and a CP'er as well. He
posted a lot of bad shit about the pump and had lots of footnotes and what
not to back up what he was saying. Much of it was a bit over my head but
I'll give it to you as I understood it which he confirmed was the
essentially the idea. Where the catheter goes in to the spinal canal,
material collected, from your immune system seeing the catheter as a foreign
body. So at the tip of the catheter you end up with all this residue forming
a body which is known as a granuloma. Eventually these granulomas got big
enough and sharp enough that they would actually begin touch the nerves. In
his case it went probably as bad as it could have gone, the granuloma cut in
to the right nerve to land the man in a wheelchair for good. Take it for
what it's worth, as he said it was one of those dirty little secrets doctors
know all about but never tell their patients, so he painted it as a huge
medical conspiracy. What he wrote had the sound of someone bitter at the
medical profession, but as to his reasons? Could be true, could be bullshit,
you decide.
A couple of other things back and forth between pro and cons - people that
had success with them have had life changing for the better experiences.
We're talking damn close to resurrection from the dead. When they were
failures they were huge failures. They absolutely must do a psych evaluation
on you as part of a test drive process. Imagine going through all the
bullshit and finding you're totally grossed out about something implanted
under your skin. They also have to do an inpatient trial to see if it's even
going to be effective. Same thing goes for SCS (spinal cord stimulators)
implanted under the skin. Any doctor that doesn't do that should be avoided
like the plague.
Another thing to consider is how much oral meds you're on and if the dose is
high enough to justify implanting an intrathecal pump. I've seen a guy
asking about getting one, his doctor was pushing it on him when the poor kid
was just taking Ultram/Tramadol, which barely qualifies as a narcotic.
Everybody knows Hawaii Wayne who's taken as much as 3000mgs of morphine or
Oxycontin, I forget which, and I believe he had a bad experience with an
intrathecal pump as well, but I read from a person who was taking 4800mgs of
OxyContin daily, who's doctor was just beginning to push the pump on him. I
read from people who had gotten pumps and plenty of them were in the
2Kmg-3Kmg daily OxyC intake. And plenty in between, usually starting to push
the pump when the dose got between 500 and 1000mg daily.
Finally, there is a Yahoo group called &quot;Pumpsters&quot;, who used to (I don't
know their policy on membership these days) be more than happy to discuss
pumps and pump issues with you. Dropping in on those folks would be more
informative than me even with all my looking and research. Don't give up too
easy either if what I have written has turned you against it. When it works,
it's resurrection and I don't know how long its been since you have had a
normal life (whatever that is), but I can tell you with all that I know and
have read, there are still days where I can tell you I'm ready to set the
events in motion without a look back. So if you put it out of mind today, I
highly suggest not closing the book on it. And the more they do the better
the technology gets, and on the day they have the lifetime battery (or you
have the lifetime of a battery left) a lot of people will be hopping aboard
the pump train.
Best of luck whatever you decide. I don't think there's anyone left around
that were in Pumpsters as well, but don't decide without at least giving
them a try. Get the real deal from the horse's mouth as best you can.

Have a pain free weekend--og

&gt;I really have not seen any information on how well or not well the
&gt;Intrathecal Drug Pumps work.
&gt;    I have the opportunity to have one implanted, but have never heard or
&gt; paid attention to anyone feedback on anyone's experiences with theirs.
&gt;    My major concern is developing a tolerance to the morphine.
&gt; I am already opiate tolerant and really do not want another surgery if the
&gt; unit will become obsolete should I become tolerant to the morphine.
&gt;    Everything I have read has only painted the rosy pictures of it.  I
&gt; need to know the CONS to having one.
&gt;    I worry that if I allow the implant, will that be the last treatment
&gt; option available to me.
&gt;    I am not sure I have express myself as well as I would have like to,
&gt; but it is not a good day
