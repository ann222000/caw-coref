Narcissa Malfoy:
I had heard the rumor that Naomi Watts had been cast for Narcissa Malfoy.
This has since been denied by her management, but I can sort of see her in
that role.  I have also thought Julie Cox would be a nice choice.  If you
don't know who she is, check out the miniseries's &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Children of
Dune&quot;.  She plays Princess Irulan.  True, she isn't a blonde, but she fits
the physical build and can definitely play the haughty snobbish Narcissa.
Her hair color can easily be changed.  At 34, her only drawback may be that
she is a bit too young to play the mother of a 16 year old son.

Rufus Scrimgeor:
If this character is in the film, which I do hope that he is, Bill Nighy is
rumored to be the front-runner.  He is friends with David Yates, the
director.  He would be a good choice for this part.  He fits the role
physically.  I have also previously suggested Rowan Atkinson or Stephen Fry.
While Atkinson doesn't exhibit the physical appearance of Scrimgeor, for
whatever reason, he was who I pictured while reading the book.  The thought
of Edmund Blackadder being the Minister for Magic amuses me.  Stephen Fry
appeals to me because of his role as Charles Prentiss on the show &quot;Absolute
Power&quot;.  Prentiss is all about spinning bad things to look good, and I see
Scrimgeor in the same way.

Mundungus Fletcher:
Again, I don't know if this character will be in the film, but as he does
play a somewhat important role in DH, I would hope that they establish his
character in HBP.  I had a couple of thoughts on who should play Mundungus.
The first was David Jason.  He played a similar character in the show &quot;Only
Fools and Horses.&quot;  A couple of other possible choices could be Eric Idle or
Michael Palin.

Fenrir Greyback:
My only thought on this one is Vinnie Jones.  I know he had a reputation as
tough (pretty nasty actually) footballer, and he tends to play those kinds
of roles.

Any other thoughts?

Kilroy was here.

I think Nicole Kidman would be ok even though I am not a fan.

I'll bet you dollars-to-pesos he isn't. You can easily eliminate the
entire &quot;the locket was stolen by Mundungus&quot; sub-plot in the films
without doing the least bit of harm to the larger story, so it seems
almost self-evident that it's going to hit the editing room floor (and
has probably the editing room floor already).

Nice pick. Although, honestly, if I were making the films I would
seriously consider conserving characters and screen time by simply
allowing Cornelius Fudge to remain the Minister of Magic (and then
killing him in the seventh movie). I know it would send the fans who
believe the movies should slavishly adhere to the written word into an
absolute frothing frenzy, but whatever.

On the other hand, if Yates could some how convince John Major to
guest star as The Other Minister, that would probably make the
inclusion of the Scrimgeour arc worth it.

Nicole Kidman - very unlikely she's american/australian
Christopher Walken - very unlikely he's american

I don't know if you noticed but the entire cast (I believe) of the
films so far have been British or Irish so I can't see why that would
change now and I for one hope that it doesn't.

So do I. Rumors said he wouldn't be cast as he's &quot;too old&quot;, wtf??? He
was too old for a teenager Riddle in first place.
OTOH, I've heard more positive rumors as well.

Nicole and Christopher are among the (small) group who are very good at
accents.

I find it interesting how this series has attracted a large repertoire
of actors (if that is the right word) who are usually very expensive, to
play increasingly smaller roles! If they are paying all the actors their
usual fees, these are very expensive films.

And people who write films usually have a tiny cast. People who write
books (e.g., Charles Dickens) usually have enormous casts, because it
only costs you ink to vreate them! These films have unusually large
casts, but they are still trimmed down from the books, and some
important characters have only a few scenes.

But I gather they are still running at a profit. And I'll buy all the
DVDs as well as the books. (Sucker...)

The point is one of the few good things about the films is that they
have used an entirely British/Irish cast and not brought a load of
American stars in like they usually do.

It's a real shame that the makers of the 1st His Dark Materials film
have not done the same thing but then this is a film I'm torn between
looking forward too and totally dreading.

Jason Isaacs isn't a blond.  So the actress who plays Narcissa doesn't
have to be either.

How about Hugh Laurie as Scrimgeour?

&gt;&gt; &gt;No, no, John Simm should play the other Prime Minster...  ^_^

&gt;&gt; a small role after all but would add massive realism  :)

&gt;While I certainly prefer Blair to Major as a Prime Minister, Major
&gt;would be the historically accurate choice.

It would be cool to see either of them if they could play it nervous and
fidgety. However, if there was ever an expendable chapter in the series,
it was ~The Other Minister~. I doubt that it will make the movie.

&gt;&gt;Narcissa Malfoy:
&gt;&gt;I had heard the rumor that Naomi Watts had been cast for Narcissa Malfoy.
&gt;&gt;This has since been denied by her management, but I can sort of see her in
&gt;&gt;that role.  I have also thought Julie Cox would be a nice choice.  If you
&gt;&gt;don't know who she is, check out the miniseries's &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Children of
&gt;&gt;Dune&quot;.  She plays Princess Irulan.  True, she isn't a blonde, but she fits
&gt;&gt;the physical build and can definitely play the haughty snobbish Narcissa.
&gt;&gt;Her hair color can easily be changed.  At 34, her only drawback may be that
&gt;&gt;she is a bit too young to play the mother of a 16 year old son.

&gt;I think Nicole Kidman would be ok even though I am not a fan.
">

I'll second that. I think she'd be perfect.

Narcissa is described as having a nose that always looks like it is
cringed as if smelling something bad, likely stemming from her snide
attitude towards others that she shared with her husband and son. She is
also described as, &quot;so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness;
the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a
drowned person.&quot;

George Lucas made a statement once the reason he doesn't like shooting
at Elstree (his film was shot there for a very large portion of the
trilogies) was because every day at 4 PM he had to stop for tea
breaks. He said it didn't matter if he was in the middle of a shot, he
had to stop, unless he lobbied for an extra 15 minutes, but they had
to vote and he always got voted down.  LOL.  American actors get andy
waiting around and like to get moving and be done with it.  I see that
at home too; my husband can't stand watching commercials, he wants to
&quot;hurry up&quot; to the next thing; and driving too.  He can't stand to be
behind someone doing the speed limit if everyone is going 15 miles
over.  It's funny how he likes golf!  I just don't get it.

">

That's not all that unusual in the British industry particularly if the
story is a British one too.  Many British actors will jump at a good role
that can bring British filmmaking forward and Harry Potter has proven to be
a good vehicle for the British in recent years.

When the film Battle of Britain was made in the late 1960s the producers
decided not to seek out great actors and simply offered a standard rate to
all cast members.  The film was seen as so nationally significant that it
attracted many major name British actors of the time and the cast reads like
a who's who of greats.  While the Potter films are less historically
significant I suspect a similar sentiment may apply here.

I usually hate when they change actors/actresses in the middle of a series
like that, but in this case I agree 100%.  Gambon ruined it for me when I
first saw him in GoF when after Harry's name appeared in the cup and they
went in the back room, he practically ran across the floor knocking things
over, grabbing Harry and yelling/screaming at him about putting his name in
the cup.  That's not how Dumbledore is and is not even remotely close to how
he reacted in the book.  He plays him too aggressive.  He has said he never
read the books and doesn't want to, but how can you play a character (esp.
one as know and loved as DD by fans) without knowing the characters
demeanor?  I'm not an actor, so I guess I don't know, but it seems logical
to me to find out who someone is in order to portray them correctly.

When Richard Harris passed away, I prayed they would be able to get Ian
McKellen to take over, but alas it didn't happen.  Maybe because once he had
on the beard, costume and make-up to make him into Dumbledore, the audience
who have not read the books and only saw the movies would say &quot;Hey, Gandolf
is in Harry Potter too?!?&quot;
:)

I've also read that Ralph Fiennes has not officially signed to play
Voldemort again... Who would you choose as a replacement??  My backup would
be William Nighy (Victor in Underworld / Davey Jones in Pirates of the
Caribbean as of late).  They both satisfy the apparent requirement that only
English/Irish actors be allowed in the HP series.  I mean, it shouldn't
matter where they come from as long as they get the dialect correct right?
An American can play an English role and get it right.  Look at the Austin
Powers series! Mike Myers nails it! &lt;joking - don't get pissy!&gt;  ;)

I thought Gambon did an excellent job though I do think most agree
Richard Harris was class act all the way.  However, with that said,
even if you couldn't get over Gambon, it wasn't necessarily his fault.
As for that scene, that is simply not the actor's choice 100%; there
is a thing called a director and someone in continuty and the writer,
whom all know how the character is supposed to be played.  He is
written a certain way, he's been acting a certain way and he is told
how to do it a certain way.  So those three people are ALSO
responsible for the outcome.  Personally, I liked seeing his reaction.
He had not expected that tho happen (unlike so much in the
films/books) and he did care so very much about Harry's safety.  So I
can see him p/o'd.

pronounce really RAY or RAFE.  We have Ray's here (short usually for

For my part, I'd always hoped he be cast as Sirius, and was literally
crushed when they chose Oldman.  I'd like to see Tim Curry in the
films, although I'm not certain where he'd fit.  Perhaps Mundungus?

I'm also not a fan of the hippie Dumbledore - I much prefer the
stately intellectual model with a twinkle in the eye.

I tend to think that a lot of it was poor direction.  I've seen Gambon in
other things, and I know he is quite a good actor.  I know that directors
often do several takes of a scene having the actors play each take
differently.  Then the director picks the take that they like the best to be
put in the final cut.  So, I think the director was at fault there.

That said, I still don't fully like Gambon in this role.  He just doesn't
fit it fully in my book.  Richard Harris captured the character of
Dumbledore so beautifully, that I suppose I'm prejudiced a little.

I agree and honestly, even the editor could have some small blame as
oftentimes, editors and directors argue over what's the best cut and a
great editor will often win the battle; even if what they did wasn't
the right thing

Unfortunately for us he did pass away.  In some way Alec Guiness might
have made a good Dumbledor as well.  I just don't think Gambon was
horrible in the role.  I especially liked a few scenes very much like
POA when they've just saved Buckbeak and are headed back up the stairs
to the hospital wing.  Great stuff.

&gt; don't know who she is, check out the miniseries's &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Children of
&gt; Dune&quot;.  She plays Princess Irulan.  True, she isn't a blonde, but she fits
&gt; the physical build and can definitely play the haughty snobbish Narcissa.
&gt; Her hair color can easily be changed.  At 34, her only drawback may be that
&gt; she is a bit too young to play the mother of a 16 year old son.

I realy don't like Naomi Watts for Narcissa. I don't think that she is
right. I also don't like Nicole Kidman. I think I might not go see if
it they cast her. eww.  I also don't like Tilda Swinton for Cissy. I
love Joely Richardson for Narcissa. I think she is perfect. She has

&gt; Rufus Scrimgeor:
&gt; If this character is in the film, which I do hope that he is, Bill Nighy is
&gt; rumored to be the front-runner.  He is friends with David Yates, the
&gt; director.  He would be a good choice for this part.  He fits the role
&gt; physically.  I have also previously suggested Rowan Atkinson or Stephen Fry.
&gt; While Atkinson doesn't exhibit the physical appearance of Scrimgeor, for
&gt; whatever reason, he was who I pictured while reading the book.  The thought
&gt; of Edmund Blackadder being the Minister for Magic amuses me.  Stephen Fry
&gt; appeals to me because of his role as Charles Prentiss on the show &quot;Absolute
&gt; Power&quot;.  Prentiss is all about spinning bad things to look good, and I see
&gt; Scrimgeor in the same way.

&gt; The first was David Jason.  He played a similar character in the show &quot;Only
