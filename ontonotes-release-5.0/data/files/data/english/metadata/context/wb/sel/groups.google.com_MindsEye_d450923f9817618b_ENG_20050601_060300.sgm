Hey Twink, (I like that!)

Raised a Christian, still call myself that but my views have widened, I
guess that might offend a lot of Christians. But, hey, I think Jesus
was a very enlightened being. (Man's narrative aside) Married a great
Jewish fella, spent the last 20 years soaking up everything else.
Would love to believe in magic, (Merlin is my hero) but am more often
than not faced with the reality of the laws of nature as we know them.

Heh labels huh,

I have a very good friend lets just call him Big Dave. Now BD is a
fine inteligent, upstanding young man, with whom I can talk, argue, and
drink beer.

However he will insist that labels are no good and blah blah blah.

Now the thing with labels is, it's how we learn, by labeling things.
Look, look that the words which I am typing, all of them are labels, no
labels = no language.

The problem is not with labels, but with our understanding of them.
What is meant by the label 'The Sun' is easy to clarify, what though is
meant by the label 'The Son'? It all depends on your mindset I guess,
for me it means my Son, my boy, for a Christian, it may well mean
something completely differant, heh or even the same.

Sooooooo lets not be getting into the whole labels are blah blah blah,
and just realise that it is us at fault not the labels we choose to
give to things.

Twink,
I find it hard to lable myself because my thoughts and ideas are
constantly changing the more I learn. If I were to lable myself I
would call myself a philosopher. I am a philsophy student. At this
moment in my life I might call myself an existentialist, but that is
such a broad term most people could feel comfortable accepting the
lable. I like to leave myself lable free so that I am able to keep an
open mind and not feel that I have to defend a certain presupposed
dogma.
As far as religion goes I am a Mormon. I know that you may think that
labling myself in a religious way is hypocritical to what I said
before, but I've found that Mormonism is an intellectually free
religion. It has no creeds or statements of belief that you must
adhere to in order to be &quot;considered Mormon&quot;. They have a standard set
of religious texts, but they are far from being creeds or statements of
belief.

I like Kierkecraig's explanation, as it sort of gets close to where I
am. I'm too analytical to have much faith, but too fascinated with the
possibilities of metaphysics to be a pure rationalist. I'm also too
much of a philosopher (or Craig's less ostentatious &quot;student of
philosphy&quot;) to just ignore the whole question and live life like an
unabashed and apathetic humanist. So instead, to long conversations,
and long hours burning my eyes up reading on delicate states of matter
and someone's take on Kant, and Camus's stranger blinded by heat and
ennui on a beach, and it's good enough for me. That, and sharing and
pondering all these things with a broad spectrum of cross discipline,
cross belief, but open minded set of pseudo intelligentsia like myself.
All of your voices together are just the same as the many toned voice
of god, each filtering the light of truth through your colored pane of
glass, while I sit here and absorb all the shades. Hopefully, I can
also then add a little of my shade to each of you. Does that count as a
religion?

Hi Twink,
I had a near-death experience and I believe (actually, I know) there is
a God. But the experience I had is so different than what I ever
learned in churches. I don't think that God has a gender, yet the
church peoples all talk about a 'Heavenly Father'.

I read some books by Dr. David R. Hawkins (my favorite is &quot;I&quot;) and his
descriptions come the closest to what I remember. This sounds cliche,
but God is love.

Hey tellme,
if it makes you feel any better, many of the words used in the
original Hebrew manuscripts for God, such as 'ichad', imply a
plurality of both genders, so that it literally could be translated
'Gods and Goddesses'. Just a little something to chew on while
considering the issue of a masculine God...I think you are pretty
right on in your thoughts.
Also, on near death experiences, you should really read about the
effects of DMT (DiMethylTryptamine? Any chemists on here?). It is a
naturally occuring chemical in the brain that spikes at death. It is
also a hallucinogen with similar hallucinatory effects on all users,
namely, the feeling of being drawn into a tunnel leading towards
light, floating, and being met by either fairies, elves, angels or
demons depending on their own particular mythos. Users often stop
breathing because they forget their bodies. I can't speak for
everyone, but there seems to be strong evidence that most near death
experiences are a natural and expected DMT 'trip', and follow textbook
hallucinatory effects.

Hi Chris,

My husband is an atheist and said that my near death experience was a
hallucination common among people who have experienced the same. It
could very well be so. I'm not so much afraid of death anymore since
then - just feel a bit sad at the thought of an ending to such a
wonderous life - whenever that may be. I also have the idea that God -
since God is everywhere *including* inside of me (if not, then wouldn't
God be more like swiss cheese?) So, to show gratitude for my wonderful
experiences, I like to try to enjoy everything as much as I can. My
hypothesis is that God can look through my eyes - and for that matter,
experience all of my senses - and feel the enjoyment also. Thanks,
good Buddy!

It may well be DMT that makes people who have near death experiences
&quot;see god,&quot; but I don't think that really devalues them in any way.
All experience is chemical. It really just gives a different
perspective, a perspective which shows a certain divinity inherent in
the universe, which people with a religious background tend to call
god. I'd really like to try DMT myself actually, though I'm not sure
I'd be able to handle it, as it's supposed to be quite intense.

As for labels, I was raised jewish, went to a jewish private school,
and had a Bar Mitzvah. Today I really don't know what to call myself.
I called myself an atheist for a time, but I'm not quite that,
because I do believe the universe is divine in a way. I supposed I
could be called a panthiest, though I'm not quite that either. I have
sort of a Spinoza like conception of God. Maybe I'm a Neutral monist.
I find Taoism, buddhism, and hinduism to be fascinating as well. I
agree with those above though, labels are very limiting.

Near death experience ay? wow, ive never known someone to have one
before. My grandmother told me she had an OBE once (aparently something
anyone can do with alot of concentration, but i dont think ill believe
it till ive experienced i) and she said she flew up out of her body and
herself and my grandfather sleeping, then she flew out of the window
and looked down and she could see all her children sleeping in their
beds. My friend, brie, says she has experienced it too (but knowing her
she probably imagined it, although the way she explains it is very
interesting).

I wouldnt put the DMT theory down as being untrue either. In fact most
&quot;experiences&quot; people undergo can be explained by science. But somehow i
still feel like there is something more than what the eye sees. After
all, you can't see the wind but you know its there and you see what
affects it has on the things it touches. I like think that way about
most things. Things such as aliens, spirits, even mythical figures such
as fairies. I'm not saying i believe they actually exist but i do
believe that something mystical does. Otherwise, where did they get the
idea of a tiny person with shiny wings that spreads magic dust
everywhere? Mermaids have had the same rumours but they have actually
been proven to be real; witness reports mostly but from they have said,
they arnt as lovely and caring as the old stories made them out to be.

These things are the things that make me feel im crazy most of the
time. Thats probably why my friends at school and i are so close
because we all share the same insecurities.

And Tellme, i admire your look on life that you have now. it sounds to
me more like a fresh start, looking at your life as something much more
precious and seeing it with new eyes. You are very lucky.

I have a few sayings for you all and couple of quotes some of you may
have heard before. These are the words i like to live by everyday.

-Think with your heart, remember to dream, be inspired by hope, believe
-by Adele Basheer
-Take life as it comes but never take it for granted
-Best friends are like stars, you may not always see them but you
always know they're there
-Dont try to define life or love, just enjoy, because oneday you may
not have it
-No one is more special than anyone else, we all have talents and they
determine how much better we are as a person, not by comparison
-Listen to your dreams and visions and follow your inner voice
-Place everyone before yourself
-Cherish those who are in your life now, be there for them as they are
there for you

Speaking of near death experiences, my mom was watching a show the
other day about them and she told me of an experience one lady had.
She had gone into surgery, for what I'm not sure, but as she was being
worked on she was looking down on the operation and watching everything
the doctor did. After she sat and watched this for a while she began
to float up through the floors of the hospital and she passed through
the roof she saw a red shoe, she thought that was random and thought
that maybe she was just dreaming. After the operation was over and she
was revitalized, she was told that they almost lost her and that she
was lucky to be alive. She told the doctors and nurses about the
experience she had, she talked to the doctor who worked on her and told
him how she saw everything he was doing, she even explained the
instruments he was using. He told her that she was only hallucinating
because of lack of oxygen and that the reason she was able to describe
the tools and such was because she saw them before she went under. One
of the nurses had heard her story and was curious so she sent someone
up to the roof to look and see if there was anything up there, when
they went up there there was a random red shoe on the roof.
I'm telling this story second hand from my mom, so it might not be
completely accurate, but I think I've got the jest of it. Is this just
a coincidence? Can science solve something like this? Even if science
can explain &quot;scientifically&quot; how people see the things they do, does it
rule out the possibility that what they are seeing is real or at least
divine? I don't know the answers to these questions, but I'm skeptical
as whether everything can be learned by empirical investigation. Don't
get me wrong, I'm all for science, I just think that science can never
replace religion and spirituality, and of course the other way around,
religion can never replace science, they both have their place and
their function.

This happened to my sister also. She had been put in &quot;twilight sleep&quot;
and during the procedure she found herself in a ceiling corner of the
room listening to and watching two of the doctor's talking. When she
told them she had overheard them talking they insisted she must have
been dreaming, because they didn't speak while working directly over
her (although I don't believe you are supposed to even dream while in
twilight sleep) But when she repeated their conversation almost word
for word and then told them where she had been, and THEN informed them
what they were actively doing - they shut up.....pretty quick.

As for OBE's, my daughter had one. She was having a &quot;off&quot; night - felt
bad, couldn't sleep well, etc. She drifted off to sleep at one point
but then felt herself jarred awake soon after, only, she was above her
door - looking down at her sleeping body on the bed. Seeing that and
realizing she was &quot;airborne&quot; she panicked and immediately found herself
back in her body. Another night she found herself in a strange hallway
looking at one of her friends who was beating his head against the
wall. Well, when she told him the next day - he blanched, and said
that that was exactly what he had been doing, contemplating suicide.
And if you're curious, both of these experiences scared her to death!

We talked about the effects of DMT, and its connection to near death
experiences. I have often wondered if the effects of hallucinogens
really are, as posited by so many spiritual leaders from so many
drastically different belief sets, keys to perception of of alternate
(dimensions, levels of conciousness, realities?) I have only anecdotal
evidence to suggest this belief, but I will share:

When I was 18, I partook of some wild lettuce extract. This is not a
psychidelic, it just causes you to see things that are not there.
Although my friend and I were in different cities that night, we had
strikingly similar hallucinations, which included talking figurines,
and deformed children (not a good scene, for the young and
impressionable here). For two days, we lost touch with established
reality, but in almost identical ways.

The consistent effects of DMT are also the same. Everyone sees
basically the same thing. Also, the Fly Agaric mushroom used by south
american shamans for dream walking. Is the striking consistency of
effect in these substances due to some chemical peculiarity, or do
they perhaps enhance perception to the point where we are capable of
seeing those realms which normally escape our detection?

And for the record, I am not endorsing the use of illegal substances
of any kind. Nuff said.

&gt; bad, couldn't sleep well, etc. She drifted off to sleep at one point
&gt; but then felt herself jarred awake soon after, only, she was above her
&gt; door - looking down at her sleeping body on the bed. Seeing that and
&gt; realizing she was &quot;airborne&quot; she panicked and immediately found herself
&gt; back in her body. Another night she found herself in a strange hallway
&gt; looking at one of her friends who was beating his head against the
&gt; wall. Well, when she told him the next day - he blanched, and said
&gt; that that was exactly what he had been doing, contemplating suicide.
&gt; And if you're curious, both of these experiences scared her to death!

I think what psychedics reallly do (and this is what is suggested by
their mechenism of action), is amplify what one already experiences.
Aldous Huxley made the analogy that the human brain is like a valve,
or a filter, in that it really reduces the information we percieve, to
the information that is crucial for our survival. Pychedelics seem to
lower the threshhold of &quot;what's important for survival&quot; and thus we
notice things we don't normally. One thing we tend to notice is how
amazing it is for anything to exist at all, and in this we see
divinity in everything. I am simplifying it a bit, but its really an
impossible sensation to describe. Those that have had it, through
psychedelics or other means, know what I mean.

That makes alot of sense when we take into account all the various
level of activity around us that we typically do not percieve...radio,
magnetic, and other wave types, etc. I know that there were big spates
of research on this in the 20s and in the 50s (Dr. Leary?). Does
anyone know of any current research on this matter?

I have never looked into this scientifically, but philosophically it
sounds very Kantian. Kant believed that there were two worlds, the
world of perception (the phenomenal world), and the world of things
(the noumenal world). He believed that we had no direct access to the
noumenal world, but the noumenal world impresses itself upon our senses
and we synethesize the presentations into concepts that we can make
sense of. Given Kant's metaphysics what benna is saying would make
sense. To call the Brain a filter would be very Kantian indeed.

Admittedly I haven't read enough Kant, but this idea sounds to me
somewhat like the Platonic world of forms. If this is the case, then
I would say that its not quite the filter I mean. It seems to me,
that in that model, the filter is actually filtering parts of the
phenomenal world. When in some way the filter can be made to allow
more in, through psychedelics or other means, the new perception
actually has a tendency to shatter concepts, or forms. Concepts, it
seems to me, usually simplify perception. We have a concept of
&quot;tree,&quot; and when we look at a tree, and think &quot;tree&quot; we are really, in
a way, igoring all of the detail that makes up the tree. When more
information from the phenominal world pushes its way into our
consciousness the concept of &quot;tree&quot; is shattered, and all one sees is
colors, shapes, and textures. This, to me, seems to be more real than
the concepts.

benna,
First of all I think you are confusing Kant's phenomenal and noumenal
world's. Kant believed that it was the noumenal world that impressed
itself upon our senses through perception, and the phenomenal world was
actually what was experienced. You are accurate in judging Kant's
philosophy as somewhat Platonic, many philosphers think of him as a
modern Plato. There is a difference though for Kant the forms are in
the mind, and for Plato the forms are outside the mind.
As for your thoughts on concepts, you say that concepts simplify
perceptions and in a way they do, but on the other hand concepts like
the concept of a tree is a cluster of simpler concepts. So the concept
of a tree is a complex concept made up of more general concepts like
plant, green, living organism, etc. to even more general concepts like
object. And Kant would even generalize that further, but I won't go
that far. So in saying tree we are not ignoring all of the other
concepts, but implying them when we say tree.
I'm confused as to how you think that the information from the
phenomenal (and I think you mean noumenal) world impresses itself onto
our consciousness in a way that destroys the concept of a tree, maybe
you could clarify that a little more. It seems to me that without the
processes of the mind synthesizing the information that is coming in
all that we would see are these colors and lights and such, I probably
wouldn't even go as far as you have in saying shapes and textures, for
those belong to the concept of an object. But since our understanding
does synthesize the noumenal world into the phenomenal world that we
experience, the more this is done, the more complex our concepts
become. And vice versa we are also able to analyze our complex
concepts in such a way as to generalize them into simpler concepts. So
in other words, practice makes perfect. :) Now this isn't really my
emphasis in philosophy, so don't think that I'm speaking for Kant, It's
just that I'm taking a Kant class this summer, and I find it
interesting how his thought applies to some of the topics we are
discussing on here.

Heh, like I said, I haven't read enough Kant. I was simply equating
Kant's Phenominal to Plato's experiences, and Noumenal to Plato's
forms. I don't think thats a completly invalid comparison, since,
though the noumenon exists in the mind, it is still, in a sence, what
lies behind the observed reality, the observed objects. It is this
that I mean by conceptions. Its not a perfect comparison though by
any means. You are right, I think, in a sense, when you say that
shape is a concept. I suppose I was being a bit too lose. What I
mean more is lines of color around the edge of something. It is also
true that, in theory, smaller concepts lie behind bigger ones, like
tree, but I think in every day experience we don't really delve into
the lower concepts, and just look at a tree as a blob called &quot;tree.&quot;
Now, when I say the extra perception destroys the conception of the
tree, what I mean is this. When one is forced to experience every
leaf, and beyond that every line in every leaf, and every shade of
green, of the tree, he loses any sense of the whole being a &quot;tree.&quot;
This is really a difficult sensation to describe, and one that I think
must be experienced to really be understood. But basically, when one
is forced to look at everything in detail, the simplification of
concepts ceases to exist. Everything is experienced directly.

benna,
I understand, but I still think you misunderstand what the noumenal and
phenomenal world are. I'll put it simply. The noumenal world is the
world outside the mind, the world of things. The phenomenal world is
the world that we experience, it is the perceptions in our mind. The
noumenal world is outer, the phenomenal world is inner. Do you see?

This relates to a long standing stoner conversation that goes
something like this...

&quot;So, when you see this color, you see it as blue. And when I see it, I
see it as blue. But, how do you know that what you see when you
percieve blue is actually what I see when I percieve blue...perhaps
your blue is the same as my red?&quot;

Ah yes, the inverted color spectrum thought experiment. I used to
thing about that even before I did any drugs. Its really a good
question though. Daniel Dennett addresses it in Consciousness
Explained. He claims it doesn't have any meaning, but then he denies
qualia all togeather, and I tend to disagree with him there.

But I think it is, especially when dealing with Kant. The true color
of the object is the noumenal color, and our perception of it the
phenomenal. The understanding that our experience of that color could
be 100% different, but both be valid perceptions, is paradoxically an
explanation of Kant's premise, and the foundation of Moral Relativism,
which brings us to perception of reality is reality, and Kierkegaard's
existentialism...correct, Kierkecraig?

Yes but what I call blue is what you call blue as well, isn't that
really all that matters? We may not know whether we are having the
same perception or not, but is there any reason why we should suspect
that we aren't? The very fact that we can communicate such concepts
makes it at least very probable that we are having the same perception.

Well, of course, it doesn't really matter since we all seem to
communicate ok. It's just an interesting thought experiment, which
demostrates that we really don't know the relationship between
physical things (assuming they exist) and our phenomenological
perception of them.

How well do we really communicate? Within our local tribal groupings
we communicate OK, but look at the history of war, and see how many
were fought over differences in religion, language, or percieved
goal...I think that these underlying differences in perception are the
root of that. Recognizing that difference is key in resolving these
intertribal conflicts. One of the first essays (or perhaps
semi-tautological rant is more appropriate) I ever wrote was on this
topic:

Chris,
Do you really think that wars are fought over miscommunication? I

people who start wars, I think, know darn well what their doing, and
know darn well what their enemy is communicating.

Kierkecraig,
have you read 'The Source' by Michener? I think it helps bring a
greater understanding of the underlying societal differences over the
years that began at a microcosmic level, but evolved over eons into
the macrocosm. No, the war being fought today in the middle and far
east between Christians and Muslims is not over misunderstanding. But
the conflict, at its root, does come down to that...that lack of
comprehension that their differences in language and ritual do not
constitute meaningful differences in their religions, and that the
validity of both is equal. Pakistan and India bacame and remain
divided over sectarian division, and the desire for a government which
emphasized a particular sect over another. Similar conflicts play out
every day all over the world. Yes, their is greed, lust, war
mongering, power seeking...but even then, manipulating those
differences in perception is the key to many leaders' ability to spur
their people into war. So yes, I do think wars are fought over
miscommunication; some accidental, and some intentional.

Chris,
The very fact that we can say that someone is &quot;miscommunicating&quot;,
implies that something can be &quot;miscommunicated&quot;. Therefore what I was
originally arguing about still stands. If I say blue, and you say
blue, we are talking about the same color. This type of communicating
pre-supposes that our perceptions are the same. If I say that you
misunderstand me, then that pre-supposes that it is possible for you to
understand me. This is my whole argument.

I don't think we are in conflict. I do believe understanding is
possible. However, in some situations, it is extremely difficult. When
we both see blue, we are in agreement. However, when we both see God
(or other metaphysical concepts), we are less likely to be in
agreement. Therein the problem lies.

Just thought I'd contribute to the origninal discussion - my mom had
an OBE as well the day after I was born - twice, in fact - and both
times she saw the same scene - people in white flowing robes having a
discussion at a round-ish table and she was like an observer in the
corner - the discussion was intense, and important, and serious, and
one of the people in white robes looked really divine-like and had a
halo and white beard, and was smiling though followed the discussion
closely - then in a flash she was back...

benna~ From a scientific perspective, I can tell you (as a Special
Educator) that savant autism is the mind's physical inability to filter
of information communicated to the brain. This is why we see autistic
people who are able to draw entire cities in minute detail with no
mistakes. They lack this &quot;valve&quot; Aldous Huxley spoke of and are able
to recall all of the information stored. With psychedelics, it's not
that the partakers lower or lose these filters and notice things there
they didn't notice before, it's that their memory recall is affected.
The subconscious mind brings up images, smells, sounds, etc. that our
senses have perceived in the past. We may not have seen deforemed
children or fairies before, but we have seen arms or legs, or
Tinkerbell and are able to creatively shuffle them, similar to what we
do in our dreams.

For Tink~ I was &quot;born and raised&quot; Roman Catholic. While I am still
able to receive the sacrements of the church, I chose not to as I do
not subscribe to all of their interpretations of the Bible. In fact, I
interpret the Bible on a personal level. I do support CHrist's
teachings. And I also believe one should live his/her life as the
Buddhists do. So, by that vein of thinking, I am a Humanitarian.
However, I also believe the scientific and philosophical studies of man
are leading us down the path of knowledge about &quot;God&quot;. I believe the
Higher Power is something we can never know as human beings simply
because we don't have the senses/capabilities to understand it's
essence. By that definition, I am Agnostic.

Gratia,
Well it is true that pyschedelics affect memory, but their primary
effect is really more about noticing detail. Hallucinogen is really
the wrong word for them, because its would be extremly rare for
someone to see something that does not exist. One might see objects
in front of them morphed into other objects, but the mind does not
usually just conjure up memories from the past. The perticular place
in the brain, the locus coeruleus, where LSD, Psilocin, and Mescaline,
have their primary effect deals alot with the the integration of the
senses, and secondarily they have an effect on the hippocampus, which
deals not only with forming memories but deciding what memories are
important enough to be formed, and what stimuli should be ignored (and
is therefore, in a way, a filter).
