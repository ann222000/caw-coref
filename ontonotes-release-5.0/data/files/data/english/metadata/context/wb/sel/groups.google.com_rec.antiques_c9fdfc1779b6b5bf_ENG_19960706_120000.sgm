I have just acquired a navy medal from the Spanish-American war. The
metal appears to be copper and is dangling from a blue/yellow striped
ribbon, connected by a small copper ring.

How should I clean the metal portion of this medal without affecting the
ribbon or dismantling the medal assembly?

"/> As a rule, medals or tokens should never be cleaned. With age metals
such as copper or bronze take on a patina which is considered desirable.

To clean the medal will, in all liklihood, devalue it IMHO.

"/> As with almost all antiques and/or collectables
you will almost always take off value by cleaning
the item. You probably have the Spanish Campaign
Medal, a fairly expensive one. This can be
identified by being dated 1898 at the base of the
obverse. If you want to email me what kind of
problem the medal has that would warrent cleaning,
I may have some suggestions.
