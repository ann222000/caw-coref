"/> Could you narrow that down a bit....I have many examples from the
16thC onwards and there are tens of thousands of types, styles,
materials uses and ages....&quot;two old locks&quot; does not give anyone much
to go on !!!!

PS Or should I just say &quot;$100&quot;

Chris,
I don't have a scanner but I'll give a description as best as I can.

The one padlock is shaped similar to a home base plate in baseball.The top is
straight across,both sides go straight down and the bottom is V shaped.The key
is extrememely thin and goes into the front of the lock.The key has a split
with the top of the key going into a small opening and the bottom fits into a
larger slot.The ends of the key come out the back of the lock.There are 4 small
bumps on the front of the lock and 4 on the back.

The other padlock is more rounded and at the top tapers in where the lock
closes.The key also goes in the front but is split slightly differently.The top
and the bottom of this key both have the same shape but go in different
slits.The key also goes all the way through but doesn't protrude as much
because there is a small bump in the back for the tips.This lock has 5 bumps on
the front and 5 on the back.

I know its hard to picture my description,but thanks for taking the time.
John
