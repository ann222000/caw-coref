GREENSPAN:

&quot;If Saddam Hussein had been head of Iraq and there was no oil under
those sands,&quot; Greenspan said, &quot;our response to him would not have been
as strong as it was in the first gulf war. And the second gulf war is
an extension of the first. My view is that Saddam, looking over his 30-
year history, very clearly was giving evidence of moving towards
controlling the Straits of Hormuz, where there are 17, 18, 19 million
barrels a day&quot; passing through.

Greenspan said disruption of even 3 to 4 million barrels a day could
translate into oil prices as high as $120 a barrel -- far above even
the recent highs of $80 set last week -- and the loss of anything more
would mean &quot;chaos&quot; to the global economy.

Given that, &quot;I'm saying taking Saddam out was essential,&quot; he said. But
he added that he was not implying that the war was an oil grab.

&quot;No, no, no,&quot; he said. Getting rid of Hussein achieved the purpose of
&quot;making certain that the existing system [of oil markets] continues to
work, frankly, until we find other [energy supplies], which ultimately
we will.&quot;

&quot;The strait at its narrowest is 21 miles wide [1], having two 1-mile-
wide channels for marine traffic separated by a 2-mile-wide buffer
zone [2], and is the only sea passage to the open ocean for large
areas of the petroleum exporting Persian Gulf States. Some 40 percent
of the world's oil supply passes through the strait.[3] [4] For this
reason, the strait is an important strategic military location in the
Middle East.&quot;

It's Not About Oil, Stupid, but Flattening Arab and Muslim Countries

Israel, Iraq, Iran, Neocons | 1 comment

Now that he is retired, elderly, and has nothing to lose, former fed
banking cartel don Alan Greenspan &quot;has shaken the White House by
declaring that the prime motive for the war in Iraq was oil,&quot; the
Times Online reports. &quot;In his long-awaited memoir,&quot; Greenspan writes
(or his ghost writer writes) that he is &quot;saddened that it is
politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows: the Iraq
war is largely about oil.&quot;

Greenspan's use of the adverb &quot;largely&quot; is deceptive. The invasion and
occupation of Iraq, as Bush crime family intimate Philip Zelikow
admitted, was about the &quot;unstated threat&quot; to Israel, that is to say
Israel's hegemony in the neighborhood. &quot;Why would Iraq attack America
or use nuclear weapons against us? I'll tell you what I think the real
threat (is) and actually has been since 1990-it's the threat against
Israel,&quot; Zelikow told a crowd at the University of Virginia on Sep.
10, 2002. &quot;And this is the threat that dare not speak its name,
because the Europeans don't care deeply about that threat, I will tell
you frankly. And the American government doesn't want to lean too hard
on it rhetorically, because it is not a popular sell.&quot; Because it was
not a &quot;popular sell,&quot; the neocons were obliged to invent any number of
implausible Brothers Grimm stories about weapons of mass destruction,
all of it claptrap lies, not that such lies carry a burden of
responsibility as most Americans apparently don't mind that the
decider-commander guy is a pathological liar.

If indeed Greenspan is at least partially right, the effort to steal
Iraq's oil is floundering big time. &quot;Despite a large reconstruction
effort (including Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF) support
of $1.72 billion), the industry has not been able to meet hydrocarbon
production and export targets since 2004,&quot; reports EnerPub. &quot;According
to the January 2007, Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction
(SIGIR) report, Iraq's petroleum sector faces technical challenges in
procuring, transporting and storing crude and refined products, as
well as managing pricing controls and imports, fighting smuggling and
corruption, improving budget execution, and managing sustainability of
operations. Oil production has not recovered to pre-war levels, and
parliament and cabinet officials are working to map out investment and
ownership rights that will help move the industry forward.&quot;

As Greg Palast notes, the oil industry has a vested interest in making
sure Iraq does not export oil instead of the other way around, as
shortage translates into gargantuan profits. &quot;The oil majors had a
better use for Iraq's oil than drilling it-not drilling it,&quot; writes
Palast. The oil bigs had bought Iraq's concession to seal it up and
keep it off the market.&quot;

And [oil] won't be drilled, not unless Iraq says, &quot;Mother, may I?&quot;
to Saudi Arabia, or, as the James Baker/Council on Foreign Relations
paper says, &quot;Saudi Arabia may punish Iraq.&quot; And believe me, Iraq
wouldn't want that. The decision to expand production has, for now,
been kept out of Iraqi's hands by the latest method of suppressing
Iraq's oil flow-the 2003 invasion and resistance to invasion. And it
has been darn effective. Iraq's output in 2003, 2004 and 2005 was less
than produced under the restrictive Oil-for-Food Program. Whether by
design or happenstance, this decline in output has resulted in
tripling the profits of the five U.S. oil majors to $89 billion for a
single year, 2005, compared to pre-invasion 2002. That suggests an
interesting arithmetic equation. Big Oil's profits are up $89 billion
a year in the same period the oil industry boosted contributions to
Mr. Bush's reelection campaign to roughly $40 million.

In other words, Mr. Greenspan is correct, but not in the way imagined
or reported by the Times Online.

As should be obvious, the invasion and occupation of Iraq-and the
coming attack against Iran and Syria-is not &quot;largely&quot; about oil or
even Israel's &quot;security.&quot; It is about flattening Arab and Muslim
societies and reshuffling the charred and blood-spattered remains into
splintered, emasculated, and &quot;failed&quot; vassal states. No doubt the
retired banking cartel mob boss and former libertarian Greenspan knows
this, but he is not saying. Instead, we are presented the neocon
version of the Hazel Branch, a fairy tale for children, with
transparently nonsensical allusions to &quot;al-Qaeda&quot; and shadowy Quds
Force operatives passing along IEDs to Iraqi dead-enders with venal
intent. A popular mythology shall emerge, as it did in the lead-up to
the Iraq invasion, this time directed against Iran and Syria.

As to the latter, the neocon-infested Israeli daily, the Jerusalem
Post, tells us &quot;the alleged Israeli raid into Syria 10 days ago
targeted a North Korean-Syrian nuclear facility,&quot; a turgid fantasia,
complete with absurd florid embellishments, proffered by John Bolton,
the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, from his haunt at
the American Enterprise Institute, the neocon hang-out where Bush gets
his criminal minds. &quot;Bolton suggested that Syria, which he said has
long sought a range of weapons of mass destruction, might have agreed
to provide 'facilities for uranium enrichment' on its territory for
two allied countries which are being closely watched for nuclear
development,&quot; David Horovitz writes. &quot;Bolton spoke as American
newspapers reported that the alleged IAF raid, over which Israel has
maintained official silence, was aimed at a facility in northern Syria
close to the Turkish border, and that the strike may have been linked
to the recent arrival of a shipment from North Korea, labeled as
cement, but believed by Israel to contain nuclear equipment.&quot;

Back in 2003, we were told the U.S. planned to impose a &quot;Cuba Lite&quot;
embargo on North Korea. &quot;A senior adviser to the Pentagon told The
Sunday Telegraph that attempts to export nuclear devices would now
result in routine 'interdiction' and seizing of ships suspected by US
intelligence of carrying such material.... Under the new plans, nuclear
'spot-checks' would be more aggressively pursued closer to North
Korea.&quot; As we know, the Pentagon tells us these sort of things after
the fact, so we can assume North Korea's shipping is subject to
interdiction, not that we are privy to such information as it makes
selling the fable that North Korea is providing Syria with nukes a
more difficult task, not that the Britney obsessed masses here in
America are paying attention.

Meanwhile, the drumbeat marching toward war-or a campaign of shock and
awe mass murder-continues. &quot;Senior American intelligence and defense
officials believe that President George W Bush and his inner circle
are taking steps to place America on the path to war with Iran, The
Sunday Telegraph has learnt.... Pentagon and CIA officers say they
believe that the White House has begun a carefully calibrated program
of escalation that could lead to a military showdown with Iran.... US
action [against the Fajr base run by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard
Quds Force in southern Iran] would provoke a major Iranian response,
perhaps in the form of moves to cut off Gulf oil supplies, providing a
trigger for air strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities and even its
armed forces,&quot; and of course, although unstated, against Iran's
civilian infrastructure, thus reducing the country to the sort of
Neolithic condition favored by the neocons. If we are to believe the
Jerusalem Post story cited above, an Israeli attack against Syria's
phantom nuclear facility on the Turkish border may be timed to
coincide with the U.S. attack. Of course, there is no nuclear lab in
Syria and the Israeli attack will be a repeat of the brutal IDF attack
against Lebanon last summer, aimed primarily at hapless civilians.

Thus, with each passing day, the neocon master plan for destroying
Arab and Muslim society comes into sharper focus. It now appears the
neocons will hold their hand close to the vest for several months and
wait until the presidential selection-excuse me, election-rolls around
before they launch their attack with the assistance of their criminal
cohort, Israel, and in the process pass the resulting mess on to the
next decider-commander guy, or more likely gal, as the AIPAC groveler
and Bilderberg doorstop Hillary Clinton is slotted to rule next time
around. Naturally, come Hillary's coronation, nothing much will change
and it will be business as usual, although we can expect the neocons
to retire, write their memoirs, and do the lucrative speaking circuit.
Here in America, we love our war criminals, shower them with book
contracts, prestigious academic positions, and weekly appearances on
Fox News as &quot;experts,&quot; that is to say experts in mass murder and
mayhem, when they should be doing the orange jumpsuit perp walk toward
the gallows.

Addendum

Unlike Iran, in denial the neocons will target their water treatment
plants and hospitals, Syria appears to understand all too well what
the neocons and Israel have in mind. &quot;An official Syrian daily warned
on Sunday that US 'lies' over nuclear cooperation with North Korea
could serve as a pretext for an attack on Syria following an Israeli
violation of its airspace,&quot; reports Space War. &quot;This is nothing new,
accusing Syria of things that it has nothing to do with... But what is
new is the scope of the new lie and the way it is being peddled,&quot; Ath-
Thawra told the media. &quot;The United States and Israel need a file...
after the recent violation of Syrian airspace by Israeli planes. The
latest accusation could be a prelude to more attacks on Syria.&quot; Ath-
Thawra understands &quot;the occupation of Iraq was based on this kind of
accusation,&quot; that is to say neocon lies, piled up like cordwood.

I think the threats to the Straits of Hormuz is a crock. What exactly
could the Iranians do to close shipping exactly? It really presents no
stragic value for the Iranians from a military point of view in this
conflict.

Tactically, if the Iranians could lauch their super-high speed
torpedos from there, then maybe. Otherwise is a typical imperialist
scare tactic. Totally bogus.
