In my opinion the development of morality can be explained by
evolution. My argument is that individual social animals must abide by
some type of moral code for the good of the group. Could someone point
me to some reading along these lines? I have many ideas about this,
but they remain fractured. I would like to see a cohesive argument for
the biological origins of morality.

IIRC, Dawkins talks a bit about this in his book &quot;The God Delusion&quot;.
It's a great read, and he seems to agree with your premise. I also
agree. Evolution has a FAR better explanation for morality than any
religion does.

My paleontology professor published these remarks on morality in his
memoirs:

&quot;In the great classic, near eastern religions, man's life on earth is
conceived as pain and suffering, and an inheritance of man's fall from
grace (or Paradise Lost).  According to these traditions, After man's
expulsion from Paradise, because of his disobedience to his &quot;God&quot;, man
alone could not recover his erstwhile innocence, even by striving to become
a superhuman of humility, submission, and kindness, etc., but only by an
intercession of a god, or God-man sacrifice, could man ever hope to regain
Paradise, in another world, a spirit world.  This &quot;New Jerusalem&quot; is a
concept which it contrary to the universal order of things which man's
science has inductively gleaned from the study of nature, and as such,
man's concept of morality is a product of his vision of the world and his
hope to regain lost innocence.

Man's concept of morality has most recently been connected with what he
conceived to be good (moral) and to be bad (immoral).  Man's immorality has
been equated with &quot;sin&quot; in his apriori understanding: this idea of morality
has changed tremendously during his short tenure on earth.  But contrarily,
what is moral in Nature?  And has this natural morality altered through
time?  &quot;Truth&quot; and &quot;falsehood&quot; are important ingredients in man's
consideration of morality, but truth may be defined, in the sense of
subjective truth with its definitions and criteria, differing from person
to person, institution to institution, place to place, and time to time.

Man is essentially incapable of committing &quot;sin&quot; beyond the magnitude of
the individual and collective sins, for the universe is independent of
mankind's hopes, fears, aspirations, and indeed, complete understanding,
past, present, and future.  We may, however, admit a possible transient
misdemeanor in that man's efforts have had some deleterious effects on the
earth, and even possibly on parts of the solar system, but certainly this
can have little or no effect on the galaxy or the universe at large.
Further, the earth and sister planets and their satellites are almost
insignificant parts of our almost insignificant star system in an almost
insignificant galaxy, and in an almost infinitesimal speck in our iniverse
(be it cosmos or chaos matters not).

Man's paradigm of morality is religion based on axiomatic reasoning, not
subject to objective proof, personified as God, omnipotent throughout time
and space. According to this paradigm, Man need not strive to obtain
knowledge from any source other than religion for all is given by God;
submission to his God will make all known which man needs in his life, and
the rest on a &quot;need to know basis&quot; will be revealed to him in the after
world.  This is a lazy system for man need not strive to find truth, but it
is handed down from above:  All things are known to God and all man needs
to do is apply and follow these laws which are made known by individual
revelation from God to man.

Man's concept, and Nature's concept of reality and harmony differ in the
highest order.  Man has accused his a priori deities of duplicity, for men
have always asked the question, &quot;Why should good men suffer&quot;, and very
often the misery of good men is far greater than that of those who do not
conform to the highest criteria for goodness as defined by man's totomic
customs and religions. This question has been asked and answers have been
attempted ever since man realized his &quot;selfness&quot; and became an
introspective creature.

In the last analysis of the Morality of Nature, we see no evidence of mercy
in the cosmos; its indifference extends to the lowest forms of life to that
of man. The cries of humanity, whether the suffering is imposed by man upon
himself or upon other men, or by natural laws operating independantly of
man, echo down the corridors of time and space and evoke no response from
indifferent Nature.

These anguished cries and pitiful prayers for help are merely cosmic
background &quot;noise&quot; to which Nature must (not out of evil intent, spite,
revenge, or punishment, but by necessity) turn a &quot;deaf ear&quot;; for were it
not so, Nature itself would be destroyed by these same laws which Nature
had ordained &quot;in the beginning&quot; (if there was one) and must continue to
operate in perpetuity (if time and the universe are truly eternal), or
there would be and ending to the cosmic laws:  a true &quot;twilight of the
gods&quot;, and of cosmic harmony, Chaos never returning to Cosmos.&quot;

Try some of these:
&quot;The Moral Animal&quot;, Robert Wright
&quot;Unto Others&quot;, Sobor and Wilson
&quot;The Red Queen&quot;, Ridley

There are many more.  One way to find them is to follow links in the
Amazon reviews.

I think it is also important to understand just what you (and everyone else)
means when they talk about 'morality'.  So it might be a good idea to
read something more along the lines of what philosophers say about
'Ethics', rather than what evolutionary psychologists say about morality.

Take a look at modern philosophical 'social contract' theorists like
Nozick or Rawls.  Ask yourself just how universal such a contract
should be in evolutionary thinking.  Then look at some of the stuff
that has been done in evolutionary game theory - especially the
'Tit for Tat' simulations that grew out of the research of Axelrod
and Hamilton.

It is a very big subject.

Could try:

R W Byrne ('The thinking ape' or 'Human cognitive evolution')

Krebs has a good article from 98 'The evolution of moral behaviour'
which is in 'Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology: Ideas, Issues and
Applications'

Tooby and Cosmides have a large number of odds and sods out there -
haven't read a great deal of their stuff though so a bit of a sift
might be an idea.  A lot of it is about culture and evolution.

de Waal has already been mentioned.  You might also want to look up
specific subject elements such as 'theory of mind' as this does have
some bearing on how we might perceive ourselves and compare to other
animals (primates especially).

Whenever looking at EP though I'd recommend bringing a large dose of
salt.  There is also a difference between biological origins and EP
although the line is blurred a lot of the time.  Biology and
psychological issues focus more on the physical brain and nervous
system rather than the possible evolutionary pathways that could lead
to social organisation.

EP does have some insights but is tenuous at best - neither does EP
provide much beyond suggesting a framework for the establishment of
negotiated structures like morality, religion etc.

I don't think that the &quot;good of the group&quot; can be sustained by the concept
of evolution.  It is, however, a reflection of the fact that social animals
have evolved so that individual survival often depends on membership in a
group.  The evolution of  wolf packs is an emergent property of the survival
of individual wolves that benefit from being pack members.  A wolf pack can
bring down a large cervid whereas a lone wolf might starve or be fatally
injured attempting to kill a large animal.  Individual behaviors that
facilitate group living are positively selected, what we can describe as
'morality' is actually a property of the inherent social behaviors of the
individual animals.

These are flawed attempts to suggest morality stemming from an idea.
Evolutionary Psychology tries to understand what we already know about

Ofcourse Darwinists already knew to do that before they called it
evolutionary psychology, it is patently ridiculous to suggest that
they hadn't come up with that before.

So instead of &quot;people should be racist&quot;, it becomes &quot;people are
racists&quot;.The only way that would work is to distinguish between racism
as a logical behaviour pattern based on calculating optimum race
survival and such, and racism as a love of a particular race.

But one can well see that evolutionary psychologists such as Tooby and
Cosmides expressly deny that emotions are free, and so defacto they
incorporate love of race into the logic of racism, and so they
advocate racism. Or so to say, since the Darwinists don't acknowledge
a spiritual realm to which a &quot;should&quot; is applicable to, the only real
&quot;should&quot; is the evolutionary psychology &quot;should&quot;.

The main way that racism is currently averted in the real world, is by
telling people to judge other people by what's in their heart, and not
by the color of their skin, and many other similarlike truths. That is
how the horrors of racism are averted in the real world, time and time
again. Yet Darwinists actively seek to sabotage this opposition to
racism on many levels, thereby causing an increase in racism.

Darwinists try to compensate for this stimulation of racism, by
telling people that every human being is identical, and that variation
within a group is larger then between groups. But first of all, that
is simply objectively false in some aspects, and second it further
stimulates people to judge by material attributes, in stead of judging
people in terms of them being the owner of their choices.

Yep, he's not. As it stands it's correct.  Morals are the product of
social groups and define acceptable behavior for the group for the
interest of the group.  Once upon a time groups where small tribes and
it was morally okay to raid the other group and, you know, kill a few
others. As groups have grown and society has become more complex so
the rules change - although thy arguably outstrip evolution. We
evolved with one set of behavioral traits, some of which is no longer
useful. Our tribal instincts, for example, we have tamed into the form
of sports (although Bush prefers to blow other countries up).

Most of the things we do are adapted forms of simplistic behavior we
used to ensure a group lived and worked well together and lead to
stronger off spring. Get a documentary on ape groups then use some of
that learning on humans, especially groups of young men, and you can
see we're not as evolved as we first appear to be.

Nando doesn't like evolution much - he likes to try and link it to
eugenics, which is not the same thing by a long shot.  He also gets
very confused about what a decision is and refuses to explain what he
means by it, but does have a habit of claiming he already has (which
he hasnt).

Racism is the hate of another perceived race.  In genetic terms these
'races' are usualy defined by social and cultural grouping not, as the
Nazi's got confused about, genetics. Most of use are a very mixed bag
of what used to be called race and anyone who claims 'pure blood' is
probably only going to be correct for about three generations - which
is nothing in evolutionary terms.

Your thinking would be less fractured if you could clarify what you
mean by 'moral code'.

If a dominant chimp stops beating up on a fellow troop member when the
weaker individual acts submissive, is that the result of a 'moral
code' or a genetically programmed response to visual and auditory
stimulus?

If it is the latter, then it would make sense that it has evolved.
With some range of submission/agression/empathy in each individual,
the troop can be organized and effective, to the benefit of all
individuals.

The question then arises: If this behavior is there in the first
place, why do you need a 'moral code' in the human sense---a set of
verbal instructions passed on through generations?

Morality is, in effect, a set of behavioral tendencies that are innate and a
consequence of the evolution of social animals.  Morality does not require
formal instructions unless you consider humans as a special case of animals
without social behaviors or 'morals'.

Much behavior (how humans eat, for example) does not fall in the moral

Does it follow the local tribe's rules for moral behavior? I suspect
there is an inner core of behavior which is genetically shaped, given
a childhood within certain healthy parameters. We seem predisposed to
think that stealing from, or killing, members of one's own tribe is
wrong. It seems clear that growing up in a violent or chaotic
environment encourages the expression of more directly self-serving
behavior.

Morality is also tied up with *polite behavior, which is much more
variable and complex. Maybe it has to do a lot with tribal identity
(&quot;*Decent people excuse themselves from the table before they leave
it, Jonathon.&quot;)

Moral behavior is largely behavior that is good for the tribe.

In the 21st century, behavior is judged partly on how well an
individual can expand his concept of &quot;tribe&quot; to include a wider
circle.

I don't see any connection there with what I said at all. All social

None of which has anything to do with genetic evolution. That's my
point.

Behaviors like sharing food, if they are evolved genetically, would
have to operate by stimulus and response. Various creatures
regurgitate food to feed their young without having had any lessons at
the table; they simply respond to sound or licking or whatever.

The idea that we are 'predisposed' to some complex behavior like &quot;not
stealing&quot; is unreasonable. How does an infant know who owns what?

I disagree - I think morality does have to be taught. I'm sure most of
us have known selfish people who have offspring which also turn out to
be selfish.

If morals didn't need to be taught, if they were an innate consequent of
evolution, then humans, the least genetically variable of known species,
should all have the same moral code. Yet moral codes vary between
societies and even between individuals in the same society.

It seems that, like language for feral children, the normal
developmental progress of learning a moral code as one is dependant upon
having somebody there to teach it.

Language, at any rate, is not necessary for morality (not that that
was claimed).

Those of us who have multiple children can attest that conscience and
empathy (avoiding the loaded word morality for the moment) can vary
quite a bit even within the same family, and that the differences are
evident at a very early age. I don't know exactly how much so-called
morality is a function of nurture and how much it's a function of
nature, but I'll bet that both play a healthy part.

It is to be expected that empathy would vary among individuals.

Empathy is as good a word as I can surmise to describe a basic emotional
state.  Humans don't have a lock on that emotion and it has been
demonstrated in other species.  If empathy is the ability to consider the
emotional state of another of your species it would serve as a biological
basis for the social evolution of morality as a cultural phenomenon.  In a
psychological sense sociopaths have no empathy
for the feelings of other people and are totally amoral, e.g., they have
feelings only for themselves.  The parameters of morality are cultural but
basic empathy is perhaps the source for it.

&gt; I don't see any connection there with what I said at all. All social
&gt; animals *behave*; my question is whether some behavior of social
&gt; animals is moral and some isn't.  Below you (attempt to) make such a
&gt; distinction.

&gt; &gt; Much behavior (how humans eat, for example) does not fall in the moral
&gt; &gt; realm. The word is useful for distinguishing between the two. Also, it
&gt; &gt; may be that people used to judge other animals' behavior by human
&gt; &gt; standards. (&quot;That dog is an adulterer!&quot;)

&gt; &gt; If social animals have competing drives (do I eat this food and risk
&gt; &gt; being ostracized, or do I share this food and improve my chances for
&gt; &gt; reproduction), it might be called something like moral and selfish.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What qualifies a behavior as moral?

&gt; &gt; Does it follow the local tribe's rules for moral behavior? I suspect
&gt; &gt; there is an inner core of behavior which is genetically shaped, given
&gt; &gt; a childhood within certain healthy parameters. We seem predisposed to
&gt; &gt; think that stealing from, or killing, members of one's own tribe is
&gt; &gt; wrong. It seems clear that growing up in a violent or chaotic
&gt; &gt; environment encourages the expression of more directly self-serving
&gt; &gt; behavior.

&gt; &gt; Morality is also tied up with *polite behavior, which is much more
&gt; &gt; variable and complex. Maybe it has to do a lot with tribal identity
&gt; &gt; (&quot;*Decent people excuse themselves from the table before they leave
&gt; &gt; it, Jonathon.&quot;)

&gt; &gt; Moral behavior is largely behavior that is good for the tribe.

&gt; &gt; In the 21st century, behavior is judged partly on how well an
&gt; &gt; individual can expand his concept of &quot;tribe&quot; to include a wider
&gt; &gt; circle.

&gt; None of which has anything to do with genetic evolution. That's my
&gt; point.

&gt; Behaviors like sharing food, if they are evolved genetically, would
&gt; have to operate by stimulus and response.
">

What exactly do you mean by stimulus and response here? Nursing a
crying infant might be more or less a stimulus response, and no doubt
you agree that that behaviour could have evolved. But does that mean
you think that pumping breast milk and storing it in the freezer for
the time you are at work is a behaviour that arose independent of
evolution? It seems to me that many forms of behaviour, drives,
desires, etc may have evolved which interact to produce behaviour far
more complex than regurgitating food when the chick pecks your beak.

Evolution could well select for a drive to protect members of your
group. How that drive played out in individual situations might be
very complicated, particularly when it came in conflict with other,
evolved drives, but that would not mean that the drive itself had
&quot;nothing to do with genetic evolution.&quot;

An infant may not know who owns what, but after a little bit of
experience on the playground, even without adults explaining property
rights, a child tends to develop some clear ideas about who owns what,
and who can enforce those claims.

We may not have a simple &quot;pre-disposition&quot; to avoid stealing, but we
certainly have a set of social predispositions which, when they play
themselves out in the social world, lead us to behave as though not
stealing, at least from members of our group, was the right thing to
do.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If a dominant chimp stops beating up on a fellow troop member when the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stimulus?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it is the latter, then it would make sense that it has evolved.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With some range of submission/agression/empathy in each individual,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the troop can be organized and effective, to the benefit of all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individuals.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The question then arises: If this behavior is there in the first
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; place, why do you need a 'moral code' in the human sense---a set of

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I disagree - I think morality does have to be taught. I'm sure most of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; us have known selfish people who have offspring which also turn out to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; be selfish.

&gt; &gt;&gt; This could support either nurture or nature.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If morals didn't need to be taught, if they were an innate consequent
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; evolution, then humans, the least genetically variable of known
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; species,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; should all have the same moral code. Yet moral codes vary between
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; societies and even between individuals in the same society.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Just like eye color, skin tone, blood type, etc?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It seems that, like language for feral children, the normal
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; developmental progress of learning a moral code as one is dependant
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; upon
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; having somebody there to teach it.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Language, at any rate, is not necessary for morality (not that that
&gt; &gt;&gt; was claimed).

&gt; &gt;&gt; Those of us who have multiple children can attest that conscience and
&gt; &gt;&gt; empathy (avoiding the loaded word morality for the moment)

&gt; &gt; Why are you avoiding the word that is being discussed? What is your
&gt; &gt; definition of morality?

&gt; &gt; It is to be expected that empathy would vary among individuals.
&gt; &gt; Empathy can be reinforced like any other behavior. However, empathy is
&gt; &gt; not morality.

&gt; &gt; I don't know exactly what you mean by &quot;conscience&quot;, but it seems
&gt; &gt; unlikely that that is morality either.

&gt; &gt; So why is it so difficult to just define the term morality?

&gt; &gt;&gt;can vary
&gt; &gt;&gt; quite a bit even within the same family, and that the differences are
&gt; &gt;&gt; evident at a very early age. I don't know exactly how much so-called
&gt; &gt;&gt; morality is a function of nurture and how much it's a function of
&gt; &gt;&gt; nature, but I'll bet that both play a healthy part.

&gt; &gt; Nature and nurture probably both play a healthy part in most human
&gt; &gt; behavior. But morality is not a behavior.

&gt; &gt; -tg

&gt; Empathy is as good a word as I can surmise to describe a basic emotional
&gt; state.  Humans don't have a lock on that emotion and it has been
&gt; demonstrated in other species.  If empathy is the ability to consider the
&gt; emotional state of another of your species it would serve as a biological
&gt; basis for the social evolution of morality as a cultural phenomenon.  In a
&gt; psychological sense sociopaths have no empathy
&gt; for the feelings of other people and are totally amoral, e.g., they have
&gt; feelings only for themselves.
">

It is perfectly possible for a person to be a sociopath and to act
according to some morality.
It is perfectly possible for a person to be amoral and experience
empathy and behave with compassion.

That people don't understand this is very dangerous.
