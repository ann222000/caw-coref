Just took off the aluminum siding on the front of my house.  I don't know if
it's worth the gasoline to drive it to the scrap metal dealer.  I probably
have about 20 lbs.

Is this siding aluminum suitable for melting and casting?

Another question.  My wife has three kilns.  They go up to about 2000° F.
Can I just simply snip up a bunch of siding, place it in a cast iron skillet
and put it in one of her kilns?  Just wondering.

You are fighting physics. The ratio of surface area to volume of your
siding is far too high and as you melt it, it will form a very large
proportion of various aluminium oxides which will settle out as a
thick layer of dross on the surface of your melt. Melting it
commercially they would plunge it into an already molten pool of
aluminium so as to exclude the air. I found all this out when I
started casting a couple of decades ago and was re-cycling beer cans.
Produced as much dross as aluminium.

Now if you cut your siding into kiln sized pieces in a skillet, and
filled the kiln with an inert gas you'd be fine !

Pretty much what Andrew said, although I'd add that the vessel in which
you'd do the melting wouldn't be a good choice.    Molten metals have
considerable solvent power------and will dissolve other metals when well
below their melting points.  That principle is used in assaying, where
molten lead, reduced from litharge, collects metals that melt at much higher
temperatures (platinum, for example)  and includes them in the button.
Platinum melts well over 3,000 degrees F, yet it is dissolved nicely by the
lead at a much lower temperature.

If your objective were to reduce the aluminum for the sake of the exercise,
a cast iron skillet would work, but you'd be contaminating the aluminum and
altering its characteristics.   You would end up with aluminum that is of
poor quality.    You'd also likely regret the stink and smoke that came from
the finish on the siding.

Extruded aluminum, or rolled aluminum doesn't cast as well as aluminum
alloyed for the purpose.  If your objective is to use the resulting metal
for casting, you'd be far better served to re-melt existing castings, which
are alloyed appropriately and flow much better.

Right now, the scrap market is quite strong.   If you have a recycling yard
near, you might be pleasantly surprised to find your material is worth the
trip.   It's no retirement plan, but it should buy a nice lunch for you and
the Mrs.

Oh, sure. And the next time we hear from you, you'll be singing

For a hoot, google up &quot;resawed beans&quot; on the Wreck (rec.woodworking

Hearing these stories always makes me thankful for the mother and wife that
I have. We ate dinner on TV trays several times when I was in high school,
because I had my S.U. carburetors all in pieces on the dining room table,
and the smell of gasoline was too strong to eat there. And my wife never
complained when I used our oven for bending wood, tempering steel, or curing
industrial A-B cure epoxy.

You have to pick these important people in your life very carefully.

It's a noticeable problem in aluminum diecasting, where the aluminum
impinges on the steel with some pressure and cuts right through the oxide to
the parent metal. Other than that, the process of dissolving iron in
aluminum is pretty slow, although, as others have said, it quickly becomes
enough to degrade the aluminum if you melt it in an iron or steel crucible.
One useful solution is Dave Gingery's method of using crucibles made from
&quot;iron&quot; pipe: he coated the inside with a thin wash of refractory clay and
allowed it to dry before using the crucible to melt aluminum.

Aluminum will dissolve in iron, and vice versa, even at temperatures far
below the melting point of iron. The two metals can exist in a very wide
range of solutions.

I learned early on that people change in different ways and at
different rates, so marriage doesn't stay together for very long.
(Some exceptions are some of you old farts.)

By my 10th high school reunion, not ONE of the people I'd attended
high school with who'd gotten hitched (during/since high school) was
still married to the same person. Hell, even my parents got divorced
(and remarried to each other a year later.) At age 14, I attended my
grandfather's wedding. That was 8 years after my parent's wedding.
(Oops, that was Grandpa's second marriage. Never mind.)

It's not the high-temperature &quot;corrosivity&quot; of aluminum that's at issue.
What happens is, iron oxide and aluminum enter into a Goldshmidt reaction
-- that is, the combination is Thermite.

This has the side effect of raising the interface temperature sharply,
further increasing the solubility of the iron in the aluminum.

Yup.  The best miniature soldering irons have tips masked with aluminum

That was Andrew, and it revolves around the huge surface area of thin
objects, which readily oxidize to form aluminum oxide.  Once formed, it is
reduced only with an extremely high temperature, usually accomplished with
an arc furnace.  It's not materially different from the reduction of
aluminum from ore, in other words.

I've been real busy of late, and haven't followed that thread due to lack of

Molten metals are wonderful solvents of other metals.  Think how mercury

at ambient temperature.

&gt;&gt;Good on you two, Ed !  I'm sure you are both equally blessed&gt;

&gt; You didn't hear how long I've been married to my second wife. &lt;g&gt;

&gt; Yeah, we're lucky. Interestingly, many of our friends have been married
&gt; roughly as long. I guess that's why we're friends.

And I just celebrated the 30th anniversary with the 2nd Mrs. W.

Adding that to 14 years with the first one makes for a total of 44 years
of married bliss.

No complaints, the dissolution of my first marriage was an perfect
example of what &quot;clutch&quot; said earlier on this thread:

&quot;I learned early on that people change in different ways and at
different rates, so marriage doesn't stay together for very long.&quot;

And, the first spouse and I handled our divorce with courtesy and
respect for each other and we still have a nonacrimonious relationship.

I'm fond of bragging that my first divorce (Which I hope will also be my
only one.) is better than most marriages. &lt;G&gt;

I think that swans are doing better than homo sapiens with regard to
staying mated for life these days. I hear tell that 50% of all marriages
in the last few decades have ended in divorce.

I may have missed seeing it mentioned, but I'd iexpect that all that
paint or whatever coating is on the siding would likely make one heaven

&gt;&gt; its better to melt it in a ceramic container.  the aluminum is caustic when its
&gt;&gt; molten and can eat through iron.

&gt; molten aluminum eats cast iron really fast. I tried using a nice Lodge
&gt; melting pot with molten aluminum, That was a bad idea.

I've had some success with stainless steel cookware (NOT from the
kitchen, nor in the oven :)
I assume this works because stainless protects itself with an inert
layer of oxide, which even the aluminium can't eat.

&gt; &gt; Oh, sure. And the next time we hear from you, you'll be singing

&gt; &gt; much as you would like her cutting up the frozen turkey with your
&gt; &gt; metalcutting bandsaw.

&gt; &gt; For a hoot, google up &quot;resawed beans&quot; on the Wreck (rec.woodworking

&gt; &gt; Besides, I'm sure you'd have much more fun building your own
&gt; &gt; propane-fired melting furnace.

&gt; Hearing these stories always makes me thankful for the mother and wife that
&gt; I have. We ate dinner on TV trays several times when I was in high school,
&gt; because I had my S.U. carburetors all in pieces on the dining room table,
&gt; and the smell of gasoline was too strong to eat there. And my wife never

That's because most of those getting divorced, are repeat offenders
(What's Liz Taylor up to now, #9?)
Got a buddy, he's just been divorced by wife number three.  Wife #1
is happily remarried, Wife #2 is &quot;happily&quot; single again.
OTOH, I've an old flame who was married three times.  Divorced the

You and I must have worked from the same book.   I, too, was married for 14
years to my ex, and just passed 30 years with my current bride----a keeper.
I was just shy of my 22nd. birthday when I married the first time.

That marriage was dissolved without a great deal of rancor, with a single

This will work if you have to use a steel pipe crucible and is a good

of molten aluminum back when I first started casting and decided to
make a crucible from a length of 4&quot; i.d. steel pipe with a 1/4&quot; thick
plate welded to the bottom.  I fired it 4 times and a hole formed in
the bottom.  It was just a pinhole but it was enough to let aluminum
flood the bottom of the furnace.  Now I melt aluminum in a cast iron
pot coated inside and outside with furnace cement from the hardware
store thinned with water to a thick paint and brushed onto the warm
metal.  This lasts for 2 or 3 heats and can easily be renewed when
neccessary.
