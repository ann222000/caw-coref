The Piano Player

A man walks into a bar and orders a beer. He takes his first sip and sets it
down. While he is looking around the bar, a monkey swings down and steals
the pint of beer from him before he is able to stop the monkey.

The man asks the bartender who owns the monkey. The bartender replies the
piano player. The man walks over to the piano player and says, &quot;Do you know
your monkey stole my beer.&quot;

The pianist replies &quot;No, but if you hum it, I'll play it.&quot;

The Timid Woman

A guy walks into a bar with a pet alligator by his side. He puts the
alligator up on the bar. He turns to the astonished patrons. &quot;I'll make you
a deal. I'll open this alligator's mouth and place my genitals inside. Then
the gator will close his mouth for one minute. He'll then open his mouth and
I'll remove my unit unscathed. In return for witnessing this spectacle, each
of you will buy me a drink.&quot; The crowd murmured their approval. The man
stood up on the bar, dropped his trousers, and placed his privates in the
alligator's open mouth. The gator closed his mouth as the crowd gasped.
After a minute, the man grabbed a beer bottle and rapped the alligator hard
on the top of its head. The gator opened his mouth and the man removed his
genitals unscathed as promised. The crowd cheered and the first of his free
drinks were delivered.

The man stood up again and made another offer. &quot;I'll pay anyone $100 who's
willing to give it a try.&quot;

A hush fell over the crowd. After awhile, a hand went up in the back of the
bar. A woman timidly spoke up. &quot;I'll try, but you have to promise not to hit
me on the head with the beer bottle.&quot;

The Old Prospector

An old prospector walks his tired old mule into a western town one day. He'd
been out in the desert for about six months without a drop of whiskey. He
walked up to the first saloon he came to and tied his old mule to the hitch
rail. As he stood there brushing some of the dust from his face and clothes,
a gunslinger walked out of the saloon with a gun in one hand and a bottle of
whiskey in the other.

The gunslinger looked at the old man and laughed, saying, &quot;Hey old man, have
you ever danced?&quot;

The old man looked up at the gunslinger and said, &quot;No, I never did dance. I
just never wanted to.&quot;

A crowd had gathered by then and the gunslinger said, &quot;Well you old fool,
you're gonna' dance now,&quot; and started shooting at the old man's feet. The
old prospector was hopping around and everybody was laughing. When the
gunslinger fired his last bullet he holstered his gun and turned around to
go back into the saloon.

The old man reached up on the mule, drew his shotgun, and pulled both
hammers back making a double clicking sound. The gunslinger heard the sound
and everything got quiet. The crowd watched as the gunslinger slowly turned
around looking down both barrels of the shotgun.

The old man asked, &quot;Did you ever kiss a mule square on the ass?&quot;

The gunslinger swallowed hard and said, &quot;No. But I've always wanted to.&quot;

Don't mess with the old guys.
