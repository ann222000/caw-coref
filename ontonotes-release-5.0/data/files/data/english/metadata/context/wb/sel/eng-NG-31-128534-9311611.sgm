I own a domain for my small business and with a pay domain host for e-
mail and website. However, my business nature doesn't relay too much
on my website, it is just to show my customers that my company is
still alive. On the other hand, the e-mail is very important.
Therefore, when I found google apps then I really want to use it. Now
the problem is, my domain is xxx.com.hk which i apply from a Hong Kong
company www.hkdnr.hk . I called them and come to know that I can only
change the name server of my domain through their system, that means i
can't change any A records, CNAME and MX records.

Actually the contract of the domain host was ended for 2 months and I
didn't renew it. Now when I go to my website then it will be directed
to the domain host company's first page, but the e-mail is still
working fine.

So I really want to know in this case, can I still use the google
apps? Or I just need to change the name server to point to google
server? If this can be done, then how to map the MX records to google
server?

Sorry for so many question and I hope I can get reply and answer very
soon.

you need to purchase a web hosting package from your web hosting
company in order to use Google Apps, since Google does not provide web
hosting.

hi viwousa,

thank you for your reply and noted. but can you tell me any chance i
can transfer the domain registrat to other company which they can let
me change all things needed for google apps such as DNS, MX record, A
record, etc? i don't know much about this domain registration system
amongest all companies, so what i want is to terminate the current
registration company's contract and transfer my domain to other
company. is it possible?

hope i can have your reply.

hi lookgod88,

you can easily transfer a domain to any other company, all you have to
do is to find the company that suits your needs and contact them with
all details you have about your domain and your old registrar, and
they will start the transfer process, also google can support you with
page creator tools which is similar to page hosting, and the
difference is that page creator will make you unable to upload ready
made pages but you can create your pages online.
