Corn Pancakes
From: Everyday Cooking with Dr. Dean Ornish

1 1/2 cups fresh, canned or thawed frozen corn kernels (I used frozen)
3 large egg whites
1/3 cup soft tofu (I only had firm, but it worked fine,with soft the
pancakes might be a tad thinner)
1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 Tablespoon chopped parsley
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Set aside 1/2 cup corn kernels.

In a food processor or blender, blend remaining 1 cup corn with 1 egg
white, tofu, flour, parsley, baking powder, salt and pepper until
smooth, stopping once to scrape down the sides of the container.
Transfer mixture to a bowl and stir in reserved whole corn.

In another bowl, beat the remaining 2 egg whites to soft, moist peaks
that droop slightly when the beater is lifted. Scoop the egg whites
onto the corn batter and fold them in gently with a rubber spatula.

Preheat oven to low.

Spray a nonstick skillet lightly with nonstick spray and place over
moderate heat. When the skillet is hot enough to make the batter
sizzle, make pancakes, using 1/4 cup batter per cake. Cook until
browned on the bottom, 2-3 minutes, then turn and cook until cakes are
golden brown on the other side, about 2 more minutes. Transfer to a
platter and keep warm in oven. Continue until all batter is used.

Note says to serve them with Swiss Chard with Roasted Onions (another
one of the recipes) or with a favorite salsa or a little fat-free
chutney or maple syrup.
