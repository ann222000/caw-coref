Big Oil in, stability out under new Iraqi law
By Antonia Juhasz and Raed Jarrar
February 28, 2007
http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/IB28Ak02.html

While debate rages in the United States about the military in Iraq, an
equally important decision is being made inside Iraq - the future of
its oil. A draft Iraqi law proposes to open the country's currently
nationalized oil system to foreign corporate control. But emblematic
of the flawed promotion of "democracy" by the administration of US
President George W Bush, this new law is news to most Iraqi
politicians.

A leaked copy of the proposed hydrocarbon law appeared on the Internet
at the same time that it was introduced to the Iraqi Council of
Ministers (cabinet). The law is expected to go to the Iraqi Council of
Representatives within weeks. Yet the Internet version was the first
look that most members of Iraq's Parliament had of the new law.

Many Iraqi oil experts, such as Fouad al-Ameer, who was responsible
for the leak, think this law is not an urgent item on the country's
agenda. Other observers and analysis share Ameer's views and believe
the Bush administration, foreign oil companies and the International
Monetary Fund are rushing the Iraqi government to pass the law.

Not every aspect of the law is harmful to Iraq. However, the current
language favors the interests of foreign oil corporations over the
economic security and development of Iraq. The law's key negative
components harm Iraq's national sovereignty, financial security,
territorial integrity and democracy.

National sovereignty and financial security
The new oil law gives foreign corporations access to almost every
sector of Iraq's oil and natural-gas industry. This includes service
contracts on existing fields that are already being developed and that
are managed and operated by the Iraqi National Oil Co (INOC).

For fields that have already been discovered, but not yet developed,
the proposed law stipulates that INOC will have to be a partner on
these contracts. But for as-yet-undiscovered fields, neither INOC nor
private Iraqi companies receive preference in new exploration and
development. Foreign companies have full access to these contracts.

The exploration and production contracts give firms exclusive control
of fields for up to 35 years, including contracts that guarantee
profits for 25 years. A foreign company, if hired, is not required to
partner with an Iraqi company or reinvest any of its money in the
Iraqi economy. It's not obligated to hire Iraqi workers, train Iraqi
workers or transfer technology.

The current law remains silent on the type of contracts that the Iraqi
government can use. The law establishes a new Iraqi Federal Oil and
Gas Council with ultimate decision-making authority over the types of
contracts that will be employed. This council will include, among
others, "executive managers from important related petroleum
companies". Thus it is possible that foreign oil-company executives
could sit on the council. It would be unprecedented for a sovereign
country to have, for instance, an executive of ExxonMobil on the board
of its key oil-and-gas decision-making body.

The law also does not appear to restrict foreign corporate executives
from making decisions on their own contracts. Nor does there appear to
be a "quorum" requirement. Thus if only five members of the Federal
Oil and Gas Council met - one from ExxonMobil, Shell, ChevronTexaco
and two Iraqis - the foreign company representatives would apparently
be permitted to approve contacts for themselves.

Under the proposed law, the council has the ultimate power and
authority to approve and rewrite any contract using whichever model it
prefers if a "two-thirds majority of the members in attendance" agree.
Early drafts of the bill, and the proposed model by the US, advocate
very unfair, and unconventional for Iraq, models such as production
sharing agreements (PSAs), which would set long-term contracts with
unfair conditions that may lead to the loss of hundreds of billions of
dollars of the Iraqi oil money as profits to foreign companies.

The council will also decide the fate of the existing exploration and
production contracts already signed with the French, Chinese and
Russians, among others.

The law does not clarify who ultimately controls production levels.
The contractee - the INOC, foreign or domestic firms - appears to have
the right to determine levels of production. However, a clause reads,
"In the event that, for national policy considerations, there is a
need to introduce limitations on the national level of petroleum
production, such limitations shall be applied in a fair and equitable
manner and on a pro rata basis for each contract area on the basis of
approved field-development plans." The clause does not indicate who
makes this decision, what a "fair and equitable manner" means, or how
it is enforced. If foreign companies, rather than the Iraqi
government, ultimately have control over production levels, then
Iraq's relationship to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries and other similar organizations would be deeply threatened.

Democracy and territorial integrity
Many Iraqi oil experts are already referring to the draft law as the
"Split Iraq Fund", arguing that it facilitates plans for splitting
Iraq into three ethnic/religious regions. The experts believe that the
law undermines the central government and shifts important
decision-making and responsibilities to the regional entities. This
shift could serve as the foundation for establishing three new
independent states, which is the goal of a number of separatist
leaders.

The law opens the possibility of the regions taking control of Iraq's
oil, but it also maintains the possibility of the central government
retaining control. In fact, the law was written in a vague manner to
help ensure passage, a ploy reminiscent of the passage of the Iraqi
constitution. There is a significant conflict between the Bush
administration and others in Iraq who would like ultimate authority
for Iraq's oil to rest with the central government and those who would
like to see the nation split in three. Both groups are powerful in
Iraq. Both groups have been mollified, for now, Â  to ensure the law's
passage.

But two very different outcomes are possible. If the central
government remains the ultimate decision-making authority in Iraq,
then the Iraq Federal Oil and Gas Council will exercise power over the
regions. And if the regions emerge as the strongest power in Iraq,
then the council could simply become a silent rubber stamp, enforcing
the will of the regions. The same lack of clarity exists in Iraq's
constitution.

The daily lives of most people in Iraq are overwhelmed with meeting
basic needs. They are unaware of the details and full nature of the
oil law shortly to be considered in Parliament. Their
parliamentarians, in turn, have not been included in the debate over
the law and were unable even to read the draft until it was leaked on
the Internet. Those Iraqis able to make their voices heard on the oil
law want more time. They urge postponing a decision until Iraqis have
their own sovereign state without a foreign occupation.

Passing this oil law while the political future of Iraq is unclear can
only further the existing schisms in the Iraqi government. Forcing its
passage will achieve nothing more than an increase in the levels of
violence, anger and instability in Iraq and a prolongation of the US
occupation.

THE ROVING EYE
US's Iraq oil grab is a done deal
By Pepe Escobar
February 28, 2007
http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/IB28Ak01.html

"By 2010 we will need [a further] 50 million barrels a day. The Middle
East, with two-thirds of the oil and the lowest cost, is still where
the prize lies." - US Vice President Dick Cheney, then Halliburton
chief executive officer, London, autumn 1999

US President George W Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney might as
well declare the Iraq war over and out. As far as they - and the
humongous energy interests they defend - are concerned
only now is the mission really accomplished. More than half a trillion
dollars spent and perhaps half a million Iraqis killed have come down
to this.

On Monday, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's cabinet in Baghdad approved
the draft of the new Iraqi oil law. The government regards it as "a
major national project". The key point of the law is that Iraq's
immense oil wealth (115 billion barrels of proven reserves, third in
the world after Saudi Arabia and Iran) will be under the iron rule of
a fuzzy "Federal Oil and Gas Council" boasting "a panel of oil experts
from inside and outside Iraq". That is, nothing less than
predominantly US Big Oil executives.

The law represents no less than institutionalized raping and pillaging
of Iraq's oil wealth. It represents the death knell of nationalized
(from 1972 to 1975) Iraqi resources, now replaced by production
sharing agreements (PSAs) - which translate into savage privatization
and monster profit rates of up to 75% for (basically US) Big Oil.
Sixty-five of Iraq's roughly 80 oilfields already known will be
offered for Big Oil to exploit. As if this were not enough, the law
reduces in practice the role of Baghdad to a minimum. Oil wealth, in
theory, will be distributed directly to Kurds in the north, Shi'ites
in the south and Sunnis in the center. For all practical purposes,
Iraq will be partitioned into three statelets. Most of the country's
reserves are in the Shi'ite-dominated south, while the Kurdish north
holds the best prospects for future drilling.

The approval of the draft law by the fractious 275-member Iraqi
Parliament, in March, will be a mere formality. Hussain
al-Shahristani, Iraq's oil minister, is beaming. So is dodgy Barnham
Salih: a Kurd, committed cheerleader of the US invasion and
occupation, then deputy prime minister, big PSA fan, and head of a
committee that was debating the law.

But there was not much to be debated. The law was in essence drafted,
behind locked doors, by a US consulting firm hired by the Bush
administration and then carefully retouched by Big Oil, the
International Monetary Fund, former US deputy defense secretary Paul
Wolfowitz' World Bank, and the United States Agency for International
Development. It's virtually a US law (its original language is
English, not Arabic).

Scandalously, Iraqi public opinion had absolute no knowledge of it -
not to mention the overwhelming majority of Parliament members. Were
this to be a truly representative Iraqi government, any change to the
legislation concerning the highly sensitive question of oil wealth
would have to be approved by a popular referendum.

In real life, Iraq's vital national interests are in the hands of a
small bunch of highly impressionable (or downright corrupt)
technocrats. Ministries are no more than political party feuds; the
national interest is never considered, only private, ethnic and
sectarian interests. Corruption and theft are endemic. Big Oil will
profit handsomely - and long-term, 30 years minimum, with fabulous
rates of return - from a former developing-world stalwart methodically
devastated into failed-state status.

Get me a PSA on time
In these past few weeks, US Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad has been
crucial in mollifying the Kurds. In the end, in practice, the pro-US
Kurds will have all the power to sign oil contracts with whatever
companies they want. Sunnis will be more dependent on the Oil Ministry
in Baghdad. And Shi'ites will be more or less midway between total
independence in the south and Baghdad's dictum (which they control
anyway). But the crucial point remains: nobody will sign anything
unless the "advisers" at the US-manipulated Federal Oil and Gas
Council say so.

Nobody wants to colonial-style PSAs forced down their throat anymore.
According to the International Energy Agency, PSAs apply to only 12%
of global oil reserves, in cases where costs are very high and nobody
knows what will be found (certainly not the Iraqi case). No big Middle
Eastern oil producer works with PSAs. Russia and Venezuela are
renegotiating all of them. Bolivia nationalized its gas. Algeria and
Indonesia have new rules for future contracts. But Iraq, of course, is
not a sovereign country.

Big Oil is obviously ecstatic - not only ExxonMobil, but also
ConocoPhillips, Chevron, BP and Shell (which have collected invaluable
info on two of Iraq's biggest oilfields), TotalFinaElf, Lukoil from
Russia and the Chinese majors. Iraq has as many as 70 undeveloped
fields - "small" ones hold a minimum of a billion barrels. As desert
western Iraq has not even been exploited, reserves may reach 300
billion barrels - way more than Saudi Arabia. Gargantuan profits under
the PSA arrangement are in a class by themselves. Iraqi oil costs only
US$1 a barrel to extract. With a barrel worth $60 and up, happy days
are here again.

What revenue the regions do get will be distributed to all 18
provinces based on population size - an apparent concession to the
Sunnis, whose central areas have relatively few proven reserves.

The Sunni Arab muqawama (resistance) certainly has other ideas - as in
future rolling thunder against pipelines, refineries and Western
personnel. Iraq's oil independence will not go down quietly - at least
among Sunnis. On the same day the oil law was being approved, a
powerful bomb at the Ministry of Municipalities killed at least 12
people and injured 42, including Vice President Adel Abdul Mahdi.
Mahdi has always been a feverish supporter of the oil law. He's a top
official of the Shi'ite party, the Supreme Council for the Islamic
Revolution of Iraq (SCIRI).

A whole case can be made of SCIRI delivering Iraq's Holy Grail to
Bush/Cheney and Big Oil - in exchange for not being chased out of
power by the Pentagon. Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, the SCIRI's leader, is
much more of a Bush ally than Maliki, who is from the Da'wa Party. No
wonder SCIRI's Badr Organization and their death squads were never the
target of Washington's wrath - unlike Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army
(Muqtada is fiercely against the oil law). The SCIRI certainly
listened to the White House, which has always made it very clear: any
more funds to the Iraqi government are tied up with passing the oil
law.

Bush and Cheney got their oily cake - and they will eat it, too (or be
drenched in its glory). Mission accomplished: permanent, sprawling
military bases on the eastern flank of the Arab nation and control of
some of largest, untapped oil wealth on the planet - a key
geostrategic goal of the New American Century. Now it's time to move
east, bomb Iran, force regime change and - what else? - force PSAs
down their Persian throats.

Selling Iraq by the barrel
By Emad Mekay
March 2, 2007
http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/IC02Ak04.html

WASHINGTON - The US-backed Iraqi cabinet approved a new oil law on
Monday that is set to give foreign companies the long-term contracts
and safe legal framework they have been waiting for, but which has
rattled labor unions and international campaigners who say oil
production should remain in the hands of Iraqis.

Independent analysts and labor groups have also criticized the process
of drafting the law and warned that that the bill is so skewed in
favor of foreign firms that it could end up heightening political
tensions in the Arab nation and spreading instability.

For example, it specifies that up to two-thirds of Iraq's known
reserves would be developed by multinationals, under contracts lasting
for 15-20 years.

This policy represents a U-turn for Iraq's oil industry, which has
been in the public sector for more than three decades, and would
deviate from normal practice in the Middle East.

According to local labor leaders, transferring ownership to the
foreign companies would give the United States a further pretext to
continue its occupation - on the grounds that those companies will
need protection.

Union leaders have complained that they, along with other
civil-society groups, were left out of the drafting process despite US
claims that it has created a functioning democracy in Iraq.

Under the production-sharing agreements provided for in the draft law,
companies will not come under the jurisdiction of Iraqi courts in the
event of a dispute, nor will they be accountable to the general
auditor.

The ownership of the oil reserves under this draft law will remain
with the state in form, but not in substance, critics say.

On February 8, the labor unions sent a letter in Arabic to Iraqi
President Jalal Talabani urging him to reconsider the agreement.

"Production-sharing agreements are a relic of the 1960s," said the
letter. "They will re-imprison the Iraqi economy and impinge on Iraq's
sovereignty since they only preserve the interests of foreign
companies. We warn against falling into this trap."

Ewa Jasiewicz, a researcher at Platform, a British human-rights and
environmental group that monitors the oil industry, said: "First of
all, it hasn't been put together in any kind of democratic process.
It's been put through a war and an occupation, which in itself is a
grotesquely undemocratic process."

The law was prepared by a three-member Iraqi cabinet committee,
dominated by the Kurds and the Shi'ites. It is now expected to be
ratified by Parliament because the powerful faction leaders in the
government have cleared it.

The first draft was seen only by the Iraqi technocrats who penned it,
nine international oil companies, the British and US governments, and
the International Monetary Fund. The Iraqi Parliament will get its
first glimpse next week.

Concerns about the process are compounded because of the ongoing
disputes in Iraq over the legitimacy of the cabinet and the
Parliament, which have been constructed by the governing council,
which itself was created in 2004 by occupation forces along sectarian
lines.

In a speech last month by Hassan Juma, head of the Iraqi Oil Labor
Union, posted on the union's website, he called on the Iraqi
government to consult with Iraqi oil experts and "ask their opinion
before sinking Iraq into an ocean of dark injustice".

The content of the law has also worried international campaigners and
local Iraqi groups who say that it puts Iraqi oil wealth firmly on the
path to full privatization.

"The hydrocarbon law reflects the process of readying Iraq's oil for
privatization," said Jasiewicz, "drafted in secret, shaped by foreign
powers, untransparent, undemocratic and forced through under military
occupation."

Jasiewicz said the law can be regarded as the economic goal of the war
and occupation and that "it will be viewed by most Iraqis as not just
illegitimate, but a war crime".

But officials with the Iraqi government, who have already sent the
draft oil law to Parliament for consideration, say it represents a
step forward for the war-torn country. Under the law, oil revenues
would be distributed to all 18 provinces based on population size, and
regional administrations have the authority to negotiate contracts
with international oil companies.

Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a close ally of Washington, called the
law "another founding stone in state-building".

And Oil Minister Hussain al-Shahristani said: "This law will guarantee
for Iraqis, not just now but for future generations too, complete
national control over this natural wealth."

Initial drafts of the law starting eight months ago saw squabbles
between the Kurdish factions who control the northern part of Iraq and
the Shi'ite-led regime as they both vied for bigger shares of the
country's oil wealth, estimated at 115 billion barrels. That they have
finally come to a final agreement may be a sign of long-sought
stability.

Yet critics, including Iraqi oil professionals, engineers and union
technicians, are instead calling for technical service contracts,
meaning a company would come in and offer services such as building a
refinery, laying a pipeline, or offering consultancy services, get its
fees and then leave.

"It is a much more equitable relationship because the control of
production, the development of oil, will stay with the Iraqi state,"
said Jasiewicz.

"That is the model that Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait generally operate.
There's no other country in the Middle East with the kind of oil
reserves that Iraq has that would consider signing a
production-sharing agreement," she said. "It's a form of
privatization, and that's why those countries haven't signed these,
because it's not in their interests."
