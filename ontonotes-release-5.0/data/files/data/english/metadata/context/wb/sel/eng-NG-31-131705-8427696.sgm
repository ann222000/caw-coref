Hi,

Any help with the following would be appreciated.

I'm familiar with harmonizing major scales in thirds and fourths. I
understand basic harmonization of melodic minors (per Mark Levine's
book).

But, how does one think about harmonizing HW diminished?

And, does anyone have any suggestions for how to practice them to get
them under the fingers in every key?

Thanks in advance,

Rick

There are so many ways to harmonize that scale. I use two basic
harmonizations. 1) Levine, in his jazz piano book, gives a nice
harmonization using just two shapes that I like a lot. One shape looks
like a dom13(b9), no root. The other one looks like a min9 with a Maj
7 and no root. 2) A more basic, inside approach is to  just use a
flying lead for the notes in between chord tones. Sometimes I
harmonize the flying lead a minor tenth below. I probably stole that
from Joe Pass, who does it a lot.

Yea, well your question refers to the older thread concerning the
dom7#9 businesses. Forgive all the wordage:

Again, I never share my knowledge with anyone without recommending to
research for an origin. I would first &quot;auto-harmonize&quot; (that is to
harmonize the chords utilizing the notes from the scale, stacking in
thirds; as you do with the tonal and modal voicings produced on major
and minor scales) the W/H diminished scale (the &quot;origin&quot;). Every
*other* chord within your resultants will produce your H/W diminished
field. Some call these resultants, the &quot;diminished-dominant chords&quot;
and their usage is all too common. You may have heard of the &quot;double-
diminished&quot; chord? This is what you come up with if you keep &quot;going
and going&quot; in building your tertian chord stack. The upper partials of
your staff-built voicing will give you another diminished chord a half
step apart from the first one; with tones that ironically clash with
the bottom of the staff generated voicing. This being the case, it is
necessary to readjust voicings, via octave displacement, in order to
establish chord coalition (a term I borrowed from studying
Persichetti). This adjusted voicing produces the voicing I laid out in
the previous discussion, for example from a G root-bass to soprano: G
B D F Ab A# C# E. The juxtaposing of the b9 and #9 is the only detour
from the pure third stacking fashion. The &quot;symetricality&quot; of the
origin scale warrants this. And this chord resultant has been adjusted
from what the diminished voicing yields &quot;instinctually&quot; as a chord
stack. In other words, we displace intervals by shifting their
locations in the chord stack: the &quot;flat 11th&quot; (the interval that
automatically comes out as an upper partial) now becomes the major 3rd
(by shifting to the lower section of the voicing) and the minor third
(which automatically appears in the second note from the bottom of the
staff-generated voicing) is now jettisoned up to become a sharp 9.
Every other chord, of course in the H/W scale, will produce the
original full diminished chord voicing (no adjustment), as those
positions are born of the bottom partial yield and are &quot;true&quot;
diminished chords. Natural ninth appears in that voicing, as opposed
to altered ninths in the H/W yield. Suddenly you have a b13 and a
natural 11th in the W/H yield to the opposite in the H/W yield. This
is the beauty of the beast-of-dissonance; using the both fields
together to make good music. It would take a mathematician to hip us
to all the theoretical possibilities concerning usage, but music is
spoken here and so, if you want to utilize the two harmonic fields
which are inherently generated form the double diminished chord stack,
I would go on to study the likely uses of diminished chords, for
example # I dim travels well to a ii-7 chord, # 2 dim to a ii-7 chord,
etc and use this in conjunction with your altered dominant resultants
(as one way to use the scale); for example G7 (b9,#9,#11,13) careening
with Abdim-maj (9,11,b13) ad infinitum. There are hundreds of hybrids
and chosen voicings (by deleting tones and/or auto-harmonizing using
clusters or Quartals), but I suggest studying the entire enchilada
first.

Hope this gives ideas for you.

Harmonize this [or any other scale] by writing it on the staff. Then pick
out the intervals above each scale degree to get some basic voicings. Play
them on the keyboard. Some of the root position stuff with close intervals
can be played on guitar and some can't so work out some inversions that you
can use. You can really have a ball exploring some of these possibilities.

As far as practicing goes it's important to focus on very specific things.
When you get zeroed in on a particular passage it becomes a question of
repetition; every finger, every string throughout the entire range of the
instrument. It's just like anything else, really.

Thank you for the responses. I'm still working on understanding them.
Meanwhile, a question I posed before I read the responses.

If I use the CHW, does it make sense to build chords in thirds like

C Eb F# A
Db E G Bb
Eb F# A C
F# A C E

Or, should I take the basic HW chord, which I understand to be a
C7#11b9#9 and just invert it? So I have the notes C Eb F# Bb Db (Do I
use E and G too?) This way seems a little more understandable to me.

Then, if I decide I want a different voicing for every note on the
high E string, do I start with xx2312 or xx1312? Then xx2323 or xx2343
(or do I even do one with G on top?).

Then is it xx5645 or xx4645 or xx8875?

I'm just trying to find a systematic way to approach this to make it
easier to find the voicings on the fly.

Yet another basic question.

Taking the following scale

Bb C Db Eb E F# G A Bb C Db Eb E F# G A etc.

If I stack thirds (the way I would to get C Dm Em etc from a C Ionian)
I get (starting with C)

C Eb F# A C Eb F# A etc ...

It doesn't lead me to the double diminished. How do I get there with
stacking notes?

I do understand that the diminished scale is composed of a four note
diminished chord 1 b3 b5 bb7 and the diminished chord a half step
below.

But, in trying to work out voicings for, say C7b9, the scale is C HW,
i.e.

C Db Eb E F# G A Bb.

The chord tones are C E G Bb Db.  If I think of it as C7#11 b9 #9 I
get C E F# Bb Db Eb. I can build voicings from those tones easily
enough, but what do I do with the G and A? Should I avoid them in
comping?  Can I really use any number of these 8 notes in a voicing
and not make mud?

I have given you a nice chunk of my time and I believe that I have
answered your initial question. There are a few guys like me who
contribute here in a similiar manner with similiar knowledge and
experience, and perhaps another of those few will supply you with more
information, but it is clear to me that you need to study, either with
an experienced teacher or do a lot of reading. I think it is fair to
say that. Some of us have spent an entire lifetime studying and
mastering such elements and putting them into play;at a time when
there was no internet, no CDs and little permission for taping
lectures. What say you?

One of my fav tricks is using the triads based on the note a whole-step
above and a half-step below; i.e., the four triads a minor third apart.  Of
course you can use them in any inversion.

For example, on the scale you gave (Bb C Db Eb E F# G A Bb C Db Eb E F# G
A), using the following major triads:

C E G
A C# (Db) E
Gb (F#) Bb Db
Eb G Bb

a/k/a the chords C, Eb, Gb, A

You can also use a dominant 7th chord, but I usually like the sound of
triads better.

For example:

C E G Bb
A C#(Db) E G
Gb Bb Db Fb a/k/a F# A# C# E
Eb G Bb Db

a/k/a the chords C7, Eb7, Gb7, A7,

You can also use minor triads
C Eb G
A C E
F# A C#
Eb Gb Bb

a/k/a the chords C-, Eb-, Gb-, A-

And minor 7th chords too

C Eb G Bb
A C E G
F# A C# E
Eb Gb Bb Db

a/k/a the chords C-7, Eb-7, Gb-7, A-7

Eeesh, I'm starting to read like Goldstein.  ;-)

What I say is what I said in my previous post: thank you for the
reply. I appreciate the info and I'm working to understand it.

I agree with the notion of detailed study. I just came across this
question in the course of a lesson (with Chico Pinheiro, who was kind
enough to give me a lesson on the fly during his traveling). Chico is
a master of this issue. He can be heard on youtube (check out Popo and
Na Beira Do Rio) and three CD's. The lesson just scratched the surface
of a big topic and I was just trying to figure out where to begin
serious study. I'll check out the other thread and keep working at. I
do study regularly with a brilliant teacher, but this was something
different than what we've gotten into.

I appreciate the knowledge and time people put in trying to help those
of us who are less knowledgable.

It's a term from big band arranging. It means that the chord is either
sustained, or repeated in rhythm with the melody. Meanwhile the horn
playing the top melody line flies above the rest of the horn section.
On piano, you can play block chord solos where every note moves up and
down under the melody, a la Shearing. Or you can just repeat the same
LH chord in rhythm with the RH melody. Big band arrangers will do the
same, and it also works on guitar.

At the risk of being considered pedantic let me try to answer your
questions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

In a way you're right. The scale has 8 tones instead of 7 (I learned it as
octotonic HW scale), therefor by stacking thirds you go to the octave in 4
steps. However in a 7 tone scale after the 7 (or maj7 or b7) you would go
to a 9 (or b9 or #9). If you do that here too, you get to the b9 and by
further stacking you get the double diminished.

Actually the answer to this was in Tony's post. You can play all these 8
notes in your voicing, but the place in the cord stack is what matters.
the Db diminished on top of the C diminished clashes.

I learned this rule of tumb: a b9 interval in a chord sounds bad unless it
is on the root (b9) or on the 5 (b13). When you stack the Db diminished on
top of the C diminished you get four b9 intervals.

To avoid the unwanted b9 intervals between chord tones, you have to
change the place of some of the tones in the chord stack. Put the #9 above
the 3, the 13 (the b7 of your initial diminished chord) above the 7 and
the #11 above the 5 (usually you leave out the 5) That will give you the
dominant 7 b9 #9 #11 13 chord.

Hope this helps,

Guido

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I'm familiar with harmonizing major scales in thirds and fourths. I
&gt; understand basic harmonization of melodic minors (per Mark Levine's
&gt; book).

&gt; But, how does one think about harmonizing HW diminished?
">

Anyway that one wishes to really.
But the results of this type of an operation with an 8-note scale will
be quite different than the results you get with a typical 7-note scale
(i.e. a 7-note scale with no consecutive semitones).
The major and minor scales, when harmonized in 3rds, give us the main
chords used in the major/minor key system.
The chords you'll get from the harmonized dim scale are not key-related
in the same way.

If you harmonize the C w-h dim scale (C D Eb F Gb Ab A B C) in
scale-wise 3rds you'll get the following series of chords:

Cdim, Ddim, Ebdim, Fdim, Gbdim, Adim, Bdim, Cdim
Cdim7, Ddim7, Ebdim7, Fdim7, Gbdim7, Adim7, Bdim7, Cdim7

How, or if, you use those chords within a major or minor key will be up
to you, your sense of taste and your experience.

But usually, dim scale material is used on dom7b9 chords (h-w from the
root) and on dim7 chords (w-h from the root).
These chord-scale relationships yield a palette where there are no avoid
notes from the scale on the given chord.
h-w from the root of a dom7 chord will yield a dom7 chord with the
following extensions: b9, #9, #11, 13.
Eg. B7(b9,#9,#11,13)
w-h from the root of a dim7 chord will yield a dim7 chord with the
following extensions: 9, 11, b13, maj7.
Eg. Cdim7(9,11,b13,maj7)
I.e. All of the dim triads and dim7 chords listed above (and all of the
chords from the harmonized dim scale listed below) will &quot;blend in&quot; in
some fashion over B7b9, D7b9, F7b9, Ab7b9, Cdim7, Ebdim7, Gbdim7 and/or
Adim7.

If you start with these 3 notes:
D F# A - a D maj triad -
and harmonize the scale in parallel motion,
you'll get these chords:
D, Abm/Eb, F, Bm/F#, Ab, Dm/A, B, Fm/C, D

If you start with these 4 notes:
D F# A B - a D6 chord (or Bm7/D) -
and harmonize the scale in parallel motion,
you'll get these chords:
D6, Ab(add#9)/Eb, F6, B(add#9)/F#, Ab6, D(add#9)/A, etc.

If you start with C Eb Gb B [a Cdim(maj7) chord], you'll get:
Cdim(maj7), Dm7b5, Ebdim(maj7), Fm7b5, Gbdim(maj7), Abm7b5, etc.

If you start with C F B [&quot;F(sus#4)/C&quot;?, &quot;Cmaj7(sus4)(no5th&quot;?], you'll get:
Fsus#4, D7(no5th), Ebsus#4, F7(no5th), Gbsus#4, Ab7(no5th), etc.

Pick any 3 or 4 (or 5 etc.) scale tones you like.
Start with them and harmonize the scale in parallel motion and you might
find some sounds that you like over:
B7b9, D7b9, F7b9, Ab7b9, Cdim7, Ebdim7, Gbdim7 and Adim7.

Good luck.

You can't get there by stacking scale-wise 3rds with an 8 note scale.
If you stack the notes of a 7-note scale in 3rds you'll use up all 7
notes. Not so with an 8-note scale.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I do understand that the diminished scale is composed of a four note
&gt; diminished chord 1 b3 b5 bb7 and the diminished chord a half step
&gt; below.
">

Better to think of it as a dim7 chord plus a dim7 chord a whole step above.
And a whole step above each chord tone of the lower dim7 chord you'll
find an available tension on that dim7 chord:

Eg. On Cdim7
A whole step above C you'll find T9.
A whole step above Eb you'll find T11.
A whole step above Gb you'll find Tb13.
A whole step above A you'll find T7.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But, in trying to work out voicings for, say C7b9, the scale is C HW,
&gt; i.e.

&gt; C Db Eb E F# G A Bb.

&gt; The chord tones are C E G Bb Db.  If I think of it as C7#11 b9 #9 I
&gt; get C E F# Bb Db Eb. I can build voicings from those tones easily
&gt; enough, but what do I do with the G and A? Should I avoid them in
&gt; comping?  Can I really use any number of these 8 notes in a voicing
&gt; and not make mud?
">

This scale, when used on dom7b9 chords is not usually just simply
stacked in 3rds.
It might help clarify the relationships if you learn to think of C7b9 as
being Edim7/C and try to visualize the E w-h dim scale as being active
rather than the C h-w dim scale.
Then, you can see the chord tones of F#dim7 as being the added tensions
(except for the C of course) to the basic sound.
C E G Bb Db
plus
F# (#11) A (13) C and Eb (#9)

Again, the extended dom7 chord that the h-w scale yields is
dom7(b9,#9,#11,13).
It can be voiced all sorts of ways.
If you omit the #9, it can be seen as a tertian stack:
1 3 5 b7 b9 #11 13
But these are not *scale-wise* 3rds, at least not from the dim scale, as
you have noted.

Basically, for the most part, you'll need to abandon the paradigm of
stacks of scale-wise 3rds when you're working with harmonizations of
this scale. It's usually best to just pick a combination of scale tones
that you like the sound of and then just transpose them through the
scale, like I detailed in my other post in this thread.

By the way. On a 7 #9 you can also use b13 as a possible tension. From a
scale point of view you can think super locrian instead of diminished HW,
as has been pointed out in the previous tread.

Note that the only differences between super locrian and diminished HW is
the b13 versus 5 and 13.

So when playing with others you have to be carefull with the 5 and the 13
in your voicing.

Like so:

bass to soprano: C Eb Gb A B D F Ab

It is stacked as you would a major chord, but you must understand that
it is a symetrical scale and you autoharmonize just like you do major,
but with the symetrical configuration in mind. You merely repeated the
first four notes. The extensions of that bottom chord form the top
chord. See it? Look at it from another viewpoint. Each extension is a
whole step away from the mother chord: C to D, Eb to F, Gb to Ab, A to
B. Now see the connection with the above stack. Cool?

Just as I had written about in prior posts concerning the stack for
the diminished dominant chord; all is in thirds except the major
second between the flat ninth and sharp ninth.

On the staff, this is how we generate the double diminished chord, by
writing that little detour from pure thirds, between C and B. The 2nd,
4th, 6th and 8th degrees give you: b7, b9, b11, 13.

As I had aforesaid, the extensions clash with the bottom voicing and
interval displacement becomes necessary.

&gt; What I say is what I said in my previous post: thank you for the

&gt; I agree with the notion of detailed study. I just came across this
&gt; question in the course of a lesson (with Chico Pinheiro, who was kind
&gt; enough to give me a lesson on the fly during his traveling). Chico is
&gt; a master of this issue. He can be heard on youtube (check out Popo and
&gt; Na Beira Do Rio) and three CD's. The lesson just scratched the surface
&gt; of a big topic and I was just trying to figure out where to begin
&gt; serious study. I'll check out the other thread and keep working at. I
&gt; do study regularly with a brilliant teacher, but this was something
&gt; different than what we've gotten into.

&gt; I appreciate the knowledge and time people put in trying to help those
&gt; of us who are less knowledgable.

&gt; Rick
">

I can appreciate that.

Perhaps, this subject will be a good one to hone in on with your
current teacher. By stacking the intervals in thirds (on the staff),
except for the seconds created by the altered ninths, you will *see*
the grand picture. Afterward, you will have better command of being
able to voice myriad chord shapes (mixing with clusters and augmented
shapes) in your own way and call upon them as you need them. You will
also understand what extensions and primary tones work together and
which ones do not; much depends on chord functioning.
For example, there are some cases where the b9 and #9 does *not*
function well together (most cases they function well together). And
*that* is a study which I highly recommend to work in concurrence with
this H/W diminished (and W/H) business. For another studying idea, I
suggest digging out the most obvious useful triads from the H/W realm.
Take major and minor from a G H/W: Gmaj Gmin Bbmaj Bbmin Dbmaj Dbmin
Emaj Eminor, but also study each enharmonic equivalent; for example
Gmaj will yield: b13, R, b3. G minor will yield b13, 7, b3. Why that?
Because, the B W/H is identical to the G H/W.
And I believe in utilizing the cycle of three, as good criteria for
this type of study. G is a major third below B. Some of us consider G
to be the &quot;harmonic root&quot; of B. Play B and sing G below and feel the
resonance inside your ears. W.A. Mathieu has a great book on this
stuff, The Harmonic Experience. Much can be learned there. The upper
partials of a C diminished will form B diminished, so there is no
small wonder that 'add' on notes can be a whole step away from each of
the chord tones. B diminished is enharmonically equivalent to D
diminished. When you are comfortable with major and minor triads drawn
from H/W dim, begin experimenting with clusters say bass to top using
G root: G-Ab-B, Ab-Bb-Db, A#-B-D, etc. Again utilize the concept of
enharmonic equivalents: G-Ab-B corresponds to B dim W/H as: b13, bb7,
b3.
After you are comfortable with clusters (&quot;Cluster's last stand&quot;) you
may want to move on to Quartals and polychords within the diminished
system. In other words, yea, study the chords by stacking thirds, but
realize that in practice you will need to utilize a mélange of
intervals. I can help you with that. Feel free to write me.

Go for it.

Harmonizing a scale opens up a range of possibilities. You'll have to
explore them independently and decide what your favorite sounds are. Some
may be more useful than others, but this is up to you to decide.

If you brought this question up as part of a private lesson with me I would
do what I've just done, which is to point you in the right direction. It's
really best for you to explore these harmonies independently. The process of
discovery will reinforce your learning curve. This is  too time consuming to
do in a private lesson anyway.

This reminds me of the Bill Evans interview where his brother asked Bill to
show him some voicings. Bill declined and said something like he didn't want
to deprive his brother of the joy of discovering these sounds for himself.

Good luck.        ........joe

It was really funny in that Harry Evans was recalling that to Bill
himself, for the camera.  You'd think if he'd show them to anyone it
would be Harry.  That video, &quot;The Universal Mind of Bill Evans,&quot; has
some of Bill's greatest playing on his various versions of a standard,
the name of which escapes me at the moment.

He plays his advanced, i.e., top recording professional, version.
Then he plays it the way he says an intermediate student might do
*trying* to play advanced, in which he tends to ramble and maybe play
too much non-connected material.  And then he plays a more simple and
direct version, which is the way he says the intermediate student
should really be playing.

However, Bill's simple and direct version is so outstandingly good a
player could easily make a great career having played like that.

The main thing that I take from that is that there is a certain amount of

you. Developing an advanced harmonic concept in jazz is ultimately a unique
and personal thing.  .........joe

&gt; Hi,

&gt; Any help with the following would be appreciated.

&gt; I'm familiar with harmonizing major scales in thirds and fourths. I

&gt; book).

&gt; But, how does one think about harmonizing HW diminished?

&gt; And, does anyone have any suggestions for how to practice them to get

So, once we establish the fact that a &quot;double-diminished&quot; chord
actually ( best to run to a piano) exists, as a result of diminished
chord coalition created by a marriage with the extensions that are
also realized in the horizontal field, (both chords are built in
stacking thirds plus the adjustment I spoke about), the 'dominant-
diminished' voicing that is staff generated, follows the voicing on
the C tonality ( in my previous post) as such, bass to top: D F Ab B C
Eb Gb A, but this needs to be adjusted by octave displacements
concerning certain intervals as such: D F# A C Eb Fnatch G# B.  This
shows you, staffwise, the fully loaded altered dom, which you are
interested in. It has three enharmonic equivalents, as you already
know, F7alt, G#7(Ab7alt), B7alt. But each of these, become enharmonic
substitutions, because the roots dictate separate functions when used
independently. It is this root function that you want to study. I
would imagine. You look at your staff-generated voicing (the voicing
yielding all the extensions that you wanted to study and codify) and
you begin thinning out from the density. And here is where you form
your own choice of voicings, deleting and/or leaving in tones (utilize
tones from other cycles) as need be according to function.
