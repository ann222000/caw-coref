Addams Family: "Eddie Comes to Visit" Part 1 of 5 Wednesday Addams looked out
the window, waiting for her brother to arrive. The length of cording in her hand
was starting to make her hand cramp. She smiled to herself. She _liked_ cramps.
A movement at the end of the walk... yes! It was Pugsley. She watched as he
bounced along the walkway between the hedgework. Almost time... almost...
Pugsley glanced down, and saw a small "x" chalked on the walkway ahead of him.
He paused, glancing up without moving his head. Yes, there... behind that
window.... A mischievous grin spread over his face. He stepped over the mark.
Wednesday released her cord. Swish! The huge blade swung past Pugsley, just
brushing the seat of his pants as he hurried forward at a pace slightly faster
than normal. He turned and watched the razor-sharp battle-ax swing back and
forth on the end of a slender cable over the walkway until it stopped. He
glanced up at the window Wednesday had disappeared. He felt a cool breeze, and
felt the back of his pants. The ax had neatly sliced a three-inch piece off the
seat of his pants. "Very close, Wednesday," he muttered, a sly grin on his face.
"Very close." He went on into the house and upstairs to change his pants. He had
a guest coming to stay the night. After all, it wouldn't be proper to greet him
with holed pants. On his way to his room, he stopped outside the door to
Wednesday's room. "Better bring in your ax, Sis," he said to the closed door.
The door opened a crack. Wednesday's somber face peeked out. "What ax?" Pugsley
giggled. "Come on, let's set it up for Papa." The two children dashed over to
the window. Pugsley reached up and pulled down the cord, raising the ax.
Wednesday pushed a wire out the window and caught the cable, and pulled it back,
resetting the catch. Once it was set, Pugsley tied off the cable, ready for the
next try. Wednesday walked around behind her brother, and noticed the hole in
his trousers. She stopped, looked at the opening in the fabric, and the cleft in
the white flesh behind it. Quickly, she formed a fist, with her thumb sticking
out, she jammed it between the exposed cheeks. "Whoop!" Pugsley jumped, almost
falling through the window. He whipped around, his hands reaching back to cover
himself. "That's called a goose," Wednesday said, almost smiling. Pugsley
grinned, and looked lustfully at his sister. "Can I try it?" "Why not?"
Wednesday sneered. "It's your ass." She turned and walked away. Pugsley,
covering his bare spot, headed toward his room.

###
The door chimes rang hollowly. The smallish boy stood on the front porch of the
great house, looking around himself. "Looks a lot like home," he thought. The
great door swung open slowly. The tall man looked down at him. "You rang?" he
groaned. "I'm Eddie Munster," the boy grinned up at him. "Pugsley invited me
over to spend the night." The tall butler moaned and nodded slowly. He stepped
inside and motioned toward the staircase. Eddie picked up his gym bag and dashed
up the stairs. Morticia Addams called from her peacock chair in the sitting
room. "Lurch, is that Pugsley's little friend?" The butler groaned assent as he
entered the room. "Very good. I hope they have a good time." She held out her
teacup. "Please?" Lurch took the cup and saucer and headed to the table where a
teapot sat steaming. He poured a cup and took it back to Mrs. Addams. "Gomez is
due home soon," she smiled up at him. "Do check to make sure the children have
not set up any- thing too deadly." The butler nodded, turned, and headed toward
the hall. At that moment, there was a metallic clash outdoors, accompanied by a
shout of triumph. The front door swung open. Gomez stood at the door, twirling
the battle-ax like a drum-major's baton. "I must congratulate the children," he
said, gleefully. "Very ingenious, but a tad slow." He removed the stub of a
cigar from between his teeth. "Still, it did ruin a fine cigar." He handed the
ax to Lurch as he entered the house, and followed Morticia back into the sitting
room. He step- ped over by a small end-table. A box on the table opened, and a
hand appeared, holding a new cigar. "Why, thank you, Thing," Gomez grinned,
taking the cigar. The hand disappeared, and came back with a lighted match.
Gomez leaned forward, puffing the cigar as he lit it with Thing's match. As
Gomez straightened back up, Thing pulled the lid down on the box. "Where are the
children?" Gomez asked. "They're upstairs," Morticia said. "Pugsley has a young
friend over tonight." "Is tonight that night?" Gomez smiled. "The Munster boy,
right?" Morticia nodded. "Have you met him yet?" he asked. "No, I expect Pugsley
to bring him down soon for a rendezvous." "Rendezvous!" Gomez gasped. "Tish!
That's French!" He grabbed Morticia's hand, and kissed her fingers, then the
back of her hand, moving up her arm. When he reached her shoulder, she pushed
him back. "Save some for later," she said, mischievously.

###
"Eddie," Pugsley grinned, "I'd like you to meet my sister, Wednesday."
"Wednesday? Why not tonight?" Eddie asked, puzzled. "Wednesday is my name,
silly," Wednesday said, almost smiling. "Oh. Sorry." "It's all right," she said,
touching his arm. "Every- body does the same thing. It's Pugsley's little joke."
"What do you want to play?" Pugsley said, jumping up and down. "How about
'Electric Chair'? I LIKE that one." Wednesday shook her head. "How about
'Dungeon'?" "That's a good one too," Pugsley said, clapping his hands. "Let's go
downstairs, then." Wednesday took Eddie's hand. "I'm so glad you came along to
spend the night." Eddie looked at her, a small expression of puzzlement on his
face. Wednesday's face showed no expression at all. The three youngsters headed
downstairs.

###
Uncle Fester closed the cover on the listening-pipe. 'Dungeon', eh?" he
muttered. "That's one of MY favorites, too!" He slithered out of his chair, and
slipped into the secret passageway that led to the basement.

###
The three children bounced down the stairs. As they reached the doorway to the
sitting room, Gomez sprang through the door, brandishing his fencing foil. The
tip of the blade quivered a few inches in front of Pugsley's nose. "What, ho!"
Gomez shouted. "Hi, Pop!" Pugsley grinned. "Aren't you going to introduce us?"
Gomez smiled. "Pop, this is my friend Eddie. Eddie Munster." The young man
extended his hand. Gomez put the foil under his left arm and shook Eddie's hand
solemnly. "Pleased to meet you. Do you fence?" "Only when there's a full moon,"
Eddie said. "Eh?" Gomez scratched his head. "Yeah, I fence all over the
neighborhood." Eddie smiled, charmingly. "He means sword-fighting," Pugsley
whispered. "Oh." Eddie looked chagrined. "I don't do that. I thought he meant
marking territory." Gomez shook his head, puzzled. "You should introduce Eddie
to your mother," he told Pugsley. Pugsley nodded. He ushered the others into the
sit- ting room. Lurch stepped up behind Gomez, as the smaller man watched the
children introduce Eddie to Morticia. "There's something about that boy," Gomez
mused. "I wonder what he meant about territory." Lurch moaned deeply, rolling
his eyes, as he turned away.

###
Fester reached the lower levels of the house, and opened a small trap door that
looked into the play- chamber with its equipment. He made sure that he was
hidden completely in the shadows, and settled into a corner. He twisted a few
times on the stool to make sure it was still silent. "All ready," he muttered.
"Let's bring on the show." He watched the stairway expectantly.

###
Introductions made, the children dashed to the stairs leading to the basement.
Gomez called after them, "Be careful, children. Don't make too big a mess." "We
won't," Wednesday called back. At the foot of the first staircase, Wednesday
turned on the lights for the second stairwell. "Watch your step, Eddie," she
whispered. "The third step is a bit longer than the others." Eddie nodded. "Just
like home," he grinned. The three children bounced down the stairs and entered
the playroom. Eddie looked around at the equipment and smiled. "I've always
wanted a room like this," he said. "I'm first!" Pugsley shouted. The sound was
muffled by the walls, which were covered with ancient Persian carpeting.
Wednesday nodded. "Then I get to choose the game." She pointed at an upright
post with chains and man- acles. "The Post!" Pugsley grinned. "Good choice."
"Take off your shirt," Wednesday instructed. Pugsley eagerly complied. Wednesday
latched the manacles around Pugsley's wrists, and pulled the chains through a
loop, tugging Pugsley's arms up over his head. Pugsley faced the post, his naked
back toward the other two. Wednesday chose a cat-of-nine-tails from a rack, and
swung it experimentally. "Ready?" she asked. Pugsley nodded. Wednesday swung the
whip. CRACK! The lashes slapped Pugley's back with a nice snap. Eddie could see
red welts forming. "Oh, yes," Pugsley gasped. "That's good. Again!" Wednesday
was happy to comply. CRACK! "YES! Again!" CRACK! Uncle Fester, his dark corner,
leaned forward, watching intently. His hand went to his lap, where he rubbed at
a growing lump under his robe. Continued in part 2...
