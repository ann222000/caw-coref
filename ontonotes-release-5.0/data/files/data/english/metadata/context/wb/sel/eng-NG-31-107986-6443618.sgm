I just got my hands on 50' of 1/2" Cu toobing.  Does anyone have the
dimensions of a 50' i.e. 10 gal. immersion chiller.  I am most
interested in the diameter, lower and middle coil spacing as seen
here: http://morebeer.com/product_images/1/4204.jpg (the more beer
5/10)

If anyone can help I would really appreciate it.

IMO, just pick a diameter that will fit well inside your kettle.  I don't
think it's too critical.

I found that wrapping it around a coffee can worked good for me but I had
3/8 tubing. With 1/2 that may be a pretty tight coil, you'll have to be
careful. As for spacing, wrap it as tightly as you can and then stretch it
like an accordion so that it's the right depth to match your brew kettle.

One of the guys in our brew club made one and he wrapped it around a cornie
keg. He kept it tight when wrapping and loosened it a little to cover more
area. He has had some issues with the rod of the temp gauge getting caught
and bent, but other than that it is very efficient.

The hard part isn't making the coil - there were some good suggestions
in earlier posts.   The hard part is making the sharp 90 degree bends
at the top where the tubing is bent to go over the lip of the kettle
and is then connected to the garden hose fittings.   If you weren't
already aware there's a good trick for making these bends.  At your
local hardware store or home center they will sell some springs that
you insert into the tubing for when you bend it.   The springs support
the inside of the tubing and keep it from collapsing and kinking if
you bend it too hard.   A little help from a torch will also soften
the copper a bit and make it easier to bend around those sharp
corners.

FWIW I built one last year and it's worked great.   I wouldn't fret
too much about the spacing or trying to achieve morebeers design
exactly.   If you've got 50' of copper in your kettle with cool water
running through it -- you WILL get a lot of heat transfer.

I've also seen some people fill the tube (or that portion) with sand,
with much the same effect.

Thanks all for the info.  I was most interested in the height and that
spacing thing that more beer does to separate a 5 and 10 gallon boil.

As for the bending part, I have a nice 10" piece of pipe at work I was
going to use as my form, and I already have a copper tubing bender.
But again thanks for the advice.

More Beers spacing is just a guess on their part and really doesn't matter.
The height would depend on the dimensions of the particular brew pot being
used. If you have one pot you will use for 5 and 10 gallon batches just use
a ruler to measure the depth for your pot. You could make the coils so they
are totally submerged for 10 gallons and accept whatever amount is submerged
for 5. You would just need to play with your cooling water flow rate
depending on which size batch you boiled.

Where can you get copper tubing?  I've been brewing for just over a
year and am thinking about upgrading from using the sink, ice, and a
stream of water going from one side of the sink to the other to a
copper tubing.  However, with copper prices increasing everyday, I'm
thinking I should get one sooner than later.

I guess the other question is if I should make my own or just purchase
one.  I've seen them at the LHBS, but I don't remember how much they
are.

Thanks,
Keith

You should be able to get copper tubing from your local hardware store.
Places like Home Depot, Lowes, etc.  Whichever you have in your area.

It's up to you.  It's cheaper to make your own, but easier to just buy
one.  Personally I just bought mine, but lots of people on here made
theirs.
