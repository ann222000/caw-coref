The Tomahawk is a Viper V-10 based motorcycle, a 500 horsepower engine with
four wheels beneath it.

Chrysler will be selling the original Tomahawk concept and nine replicas
through Neiman Marcus, for up to $555,000 each. The motorcycles cannot be
licensed, so they cannot be legally driven on public roads. A Chrysler
spokesman told Reuters they were meant as rolling sculptures.

Rumors had the Tomahawk selling for under $200,000, most likely at a loss or
breakeven price, for publicity purposes - but still fully drivable. Wolfgang
Bernhard, Chrysler's not particularly respected first mate, was said to be
enthusiastic about that project, so much so that hundreds were projected to
be built at under $200,000 each. They reportedly cost Chrysler over $100,000
to build (admittedly the work is outsourced).

The Dodge Tomahawk can reach 60 miles an hour in about 2.5 seconds, and has
a theoretical top speed of nearly 400 mph. Each pair of wheels is separated
by a few inches and each wheel has an independent suspension. Bernhard said
four wheels were necessary to handle the power from the engine.

The Tomahawk remains on display at auto shows - though well out of reach of
the general public, elevated on a special display.
