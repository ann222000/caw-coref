Hi All,

I just loaded Netscape 6 and I am not impressed, it takes forever to
load. It could just be my machine, but Netscape 4.75 never loaded this
slow , even on my old Deskpro 90. I feel like I'm back on my first 286.

"/> Hi Mike-

Spot on! Although I do 90 % of my work on a Mac there are a couple of PC' s
networked into the cable modem via a firewall and I keep Netscape up there
24/7 there as well as Auction Assistant when I need to put something up on
eBay.

I downloaded 6.0 mainly to get rid of those damn Pop Up &quot;6.0 Netscape is here
NOW&quot;Ads. It's a piece of shit and turns a good browser into a Slug in minutes
unless you've bought a new PC in the last week. To compare it to our Morgans
or TC's it's like driving a Yugo or stepping on a squid where you thought you
had the accelerator pedal. Not sure I ripped 6.0 out properly via the
Uninstall as there are a ton of Netscape files hanging around. I can broom
them at the holidays. I then went back into the Netscape Archives and
reinstalled 4.75 which I still recommend to Usenet folks. You can view RA by
Subject, Subject with thread map, Author, or Date with a mouse click. BTW I
think I found a way to dig into the Deja Archives but I'll have to reenact
the experience with some of the Black Stuff after the Sun goes over the yard
arm on Saturday.Stay tuned.

PS I also run my Mail Order business on those PC's including the mail list
(now over 63000 names) and invoicing, backorders etc. with the NewHaven
software which I Beta tested for years. There will be an article on them,
supposedly with me, in Inc. Magazine in January. Haven went through a rough
patch in August but survived. It's a great story of success where the
customers had a great belief in the product and fought off the vultures.
After reading it if anyone wants to use it for order processing shoot me an
e-Mail. It was a wild ride for 4 months but I think a nice story of people
that knew each other from user conferences and parties not willing to let
wonderful DOS and Windows products fail just because the gas tank was empty.
As several journalists have commented we are sort of like a business cult but
we pulled this one off in 4 months from CPR to Jogging every day.

"/> Hi Charley,

I had great hopes for Netscape 6, I had heard it was supposed to be a stripped
down version and fast loading. Speed comes in handy when you're squinting at
Auction catalogues, bookmarks and appraisal files all day, there are days when
even high speed access seems too slow.:~)) I noticed that there are indeed a
pile of files left over after my 6 uninstall, my hard drive is cluttered with
many such odds and ends from past program deletions that I will soon have to
clean out. The stuff left over that really makes me angry are those little
snippet of code &amp; cookies that are programmed to report back to the manufacturer,
my firewall blocks them from accessing the internet about a half dozen times a
week, lord knows what info goes with them.

P.S. Thanks for the Newhaven information, I have a project in the works that will
require some sort of order processing, if I can ever find the energy to put it
all together ;~)).
