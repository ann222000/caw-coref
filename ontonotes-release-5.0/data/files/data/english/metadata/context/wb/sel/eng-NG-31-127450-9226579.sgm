Rockies? DON'T make a liar out of me! I called for the Padres to finish 3rd in the NL West, and you can make it happen!

It will be SO VERY GOOD if the Rockies defeat the Padres tonight!  It
will be a confirmation that I am still THE Swami - the guru of
sports!

And I hope it is not a cliff-hanger of a game either!  That the
Rockies beat the Padres handily.  The Rockies by 12-5 would be
wonderful!

Then, as I told all those Padre fans earlier this year, maybe the fans
can get on the management of the Padres - to plunk down the dollars to
field a team that can win.  Instead of those big, fat, ugly people in
management with the Padres sitting up in their suites, clanking
glasses filled with evil spirits and eating high on the hog, while
trying to stretch every buck they pay for the playas to the hilt!
