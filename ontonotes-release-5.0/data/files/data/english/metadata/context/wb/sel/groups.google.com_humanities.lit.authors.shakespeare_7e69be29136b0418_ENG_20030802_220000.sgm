Dear Word Detective: Where did the term &quot;curmudgeon&quot; originate?
Are curmudgeons always crabby old men or can a woman also achieve
curmudgeon status? -- Tom Parks, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico.

I don't see why not, although &quot;curmudgeon&quot; (defined as &quot;an ill-tempered
person full of resentment and stubborn notions&quot; by the American Heritage
Dictionary) has almost always been applied to men.

Still, with sufficient grit and determination, any woman should
be able to attain curmudgeonhood. I must, however, warn aspiring
curmudgeons of either gender that the path to enlightened crankiness
is arduous and unforgiving. Just one slip, be it a stolen moment
with &quot;Touched By An Angel&quot; or a twinge of envy at Martha Stewart's
dogged inventiveness, and all will be lost. Be strong, grasshopper,
and don't swallow a smidgen of the wretched balderdash
that surrounds you.

Just where the term &quot;curmudgeon&quot; came from is, alas, one of
those perennial mysteries that haunt lexicographers, although
we do know that &quot;curmudgeon&quot; first appeared in print around 1577.
Since it seems especially unfair to label such a colorful word
&quot;origin unknown,&quot; however, several theories have been proposed
over the years.

The pioneering English lexicographer Samuel Johnson, in his
dictionary of 1755, asserted that &quot;curmudgeon&quot; was simply
an alteration of the French phrase &quot;coeur mechant,&quot; meaning
&quot;evil heart.&quot; Although this theory sounds good, there is no
linguistic evidence that it is even remotely close to the truth.
Another theory popular for a time held that &quot;curmudgeon&quot; was
a variation on &quot;cornmudgin,&quot; or &quot;corn hoarder&quot; (&quot;mudgin&quot;
being presumably related to the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;much,&quot;
meaning &quot;to hide&quot;). This theory fell apart when it was
discovered that not only was &quot;curmudgeon&quot; an older word
than &quot;cornmudgin,&quot; but that &quot;cornmudgin&quot; itself had apparently
been invented by a particular writer as a pun on &quot;curmudgeon.&quot;

More recent theories have tried to combine &quot;cur,&quot; meaning dog,
with various stabs at what &quot;mudgeon&quot; might possibly mean,
but none has attained general acceptance among experts.
The unfortunate fact is that &quot;curmudgeon&quot; is so old, and
the trail so cold, that we may never know its true origin.

Name-calling is the last refuge of losers, Kathman.

You would be much better off at this point if you had
defended your thesis, lost and gracefully conceded.

Since you won't concede the next best thing is patience.

While you're not the &quot;renown scholar&quot; that your diaperer Webb
likes to claim, no one in HLAS doubts your intelligence, you do
have expertise and you do make the occasional contribution.

My best advice, however, is that if you want to vent in a Usenet
forum don't come in under your own name. I don't can't imagine
what Webb, Reedy, et al are thinking. This stuff is forever.

If you feel you have to use your own name then at least try to
maintain basic civility.

&gt; snip of Kathman's sexist babble about &quot;curmudgeon.&quot;
&gt; Has Professor Crowley or Renaissance Giver of Commencement Addresses
&gt; Weir been consulted?

&gt; --Bob G.

"/>

I looked up &quot;curmudgeon&quot; in the OED, Grummanm, and I had
to laugh out loud because for some centuries it appears that
lexicographers have believed that the etymology of
CURMUDGEON was CORN HOARDER.

The OED notes the correction:

The occurrence in Holland's Livy, 1600, of CORNMUDGIN (q.v.)
has led to a suggestion that this was the original form, with the
meaning concealer or hoarder of corn, mudgin being associated
with ME. much-en, mich-en to pilfer, steal, or muchier, Norman
form of OF. mucier, musser to conceal, hide away. But examination
of the evidence shows that curmudgeon was in use a quarter of a
century before Holland's date, and that cornmudgin is apparently
merely a nonce-word of Holland's, a play upon corn and curmudgeon.

Here's the CORNMUDGEON citation:

1600 HOLLAND Livy IV. xv. 150 A rich corne-mudgin [L. frumentarius],
that with a quart (or measure of corne of two pounds) had bought the
freedome of his fellow cittizens. Ibid. XXXVIII. xxxv. 1004 The
fines that certeine cornmudgins [L. frumentarios] paid, for hourding
up..their graine.

In fact, here are the OED citations prior to 1600 which show that
curmudgeon--contrary to the OED editors--could well be from CORN
HOARDER:

1. 1577 STANYHURST Descr. Irel. 102/2 in Holinshed, Such a clownish
Curmudgen.

Clownish curmudgeon is neutral although Jonson did make the point
that a corn hoarder can be a clown--or an eccho--in Every Man Out
of His Humor.

2. 1593 NASHE Christ's T. 85b, Our English Cormogeons, they haue
breasts, but giue no suck.

Nashe spells it COR-mundgeon and gives it the sense of &quot;hoarder.&quot;

3, 1604 T. WRIGHT Passions v. 289 Why do covetous cormogions
distill the best substance of their braines to get riches.

More sense of &quot;hoarding.&quot; Could it be Wright--who also uses
COR-mogion--is referring to the process of distilling malt from barley
which was also called corn or barley-corn?

Maybe the tradition that the Corn Hoarder died from a bout of
alcoholism comes from that etymological association.

It seems that the OED editors--who must have time on their hands--
have prepared a little pun:

The suggestion that the first syllable is cur, the dog, is perhaps
worthy of note;

Where's the usual citation? I don't see anything that suggests &quot;dog&quot;
between 1577 and 1600 and how is a &quot;dog&quot; a &quot;miser?&quot;

but that of Dr. Johnson's unknown correspondent, cur méchant
for F. méchant cur, evil or malicious heart, is noticeable only as
an ingenious specimen of pre-scientific etymology, and as having
been retailed by Ash in the form, from the French cur unknown,
and mechant a correspondent!

Exclamation point theirs.

Cur in English comes from the ME corre; canis villaticus, domesticus
probl from kurre, or korre from SW and Norw. dog. The OED shows
no French etymology for &quot;cur.&quot;

I can't believe that the OED editors would reconstruct the
etymology of a definition to make a little &quot;dog&quot; pun on
cur méchant. They must be really bored.

Bob,
the message below is for Dave K., a scholar whose learning i respect,
but whose opinions i do not always share; for instance, his ridicule
of EW. As far as I could tell, no one refuted her &quot;Corn Hoarder&quot;
evidence, i.e., that William was hoarding corn in Stratford in late
1590s. True or false? That being said, the rest is for

Dr. Dave--
it does seem beneath a scholar of your accomplishment to try to
instigate a group bashing of elizabeth weir, whose posts are marked by
intelligence, not cognitive dysfunction.

i'd like to propose another form of dysfunction, though: metrical
dysfunction, such as your toady reedy exhibited in another thread. His
pitiful performance made me wonder if any self-proclaimed
&quot;stratfordian&quot; can hear the music of shakespeare's words at all.

along these lines, you once told me, and maybe still believe, that
Shakespeare wrote V&amp;A and Lucrece in the &quot;standard London literary
dialect of the day.&quot; You remember, I questioned how William learned to
write that way, since he was from Warwickshire and he MUST have
learned a Warkwickshire dialect growing up.

But rime royal wasn't standard literary dialect and Rape of Lucrece
was the work of a master poet (we agree on that, i hope). ...How did
William come to master rime royal and decide to write a poem about the
overthrow of tyranny replaced by a republican form of government for a
radical Earl, when (supposedly) he was still a novice playwright? When
do you figure William left Stratford for London and how? Can you
answer in blank verse? If not, maybe you can provide the facts and BG
can turn it into verse. I'd ask for rime royal, but ... baby steps.

I guess we'll have to disagree about that. I don't think
I instigated anything, since plenty of people here have been
bashing Elizabeth on their own, with good reason. I treat this
newsgroup as entertainment pure and simple, and my rather
gentle (I thought) ridiculing of Elizabeth is a form of
entertainment for me. I certainly can't take her seriously,
but many of her statements and behaviors cry out to be ridiculed.
My failing, if it be called that, is in succumbing to temptation.

Well, I was primarily talking about vocabulary, not

speak in rime royal, or write in it unless they were

Well, I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;master poet&quot;. I don't
think Lucrece is as poetically accomplished as the Sonnets,
for example, and lots of people have had comparatively
lukewarm opinions of it. I think it's a fine poem, but
it's a relatively unpolished work, not a masterwork to
cap a career.

Well, he mastered rime royal by reading other poems written in
that form, and presumably by trying it out in earlier poems,
or earlier versions of Lucrece, which are lost because they
were never published. As for why Shakespeare decided on this
particular topic for his poem, I assume it was because the
story was told by Ovid, one of Shakespeare's favorite
classical poets, and it was fashionable at the time to use Ovidian
subjects in these types of poems.

False, I've refuted it many times. There is no document that
exists from that time that says that Shakespeare was &quot;hoarding&quot;
corn or malt or anything else. There is one documents that shows
him *owning* 10 quarters of malt, but citizens were allowed to have
on hand enough grain each person in their household to live on for one year.

From the government's publication, &quot;A New Charge&quot; (1595), where town
officials were told to inspect the grain holdings of its inhabitants,
&quot;...allowing to every householder for his expenses in his house, for
every person thereof according to their quality, sufficient corn for bread
and drink between this and the next harvest, and for their seed after the
rate of their sowing of that country upon an acre.&quot;

Here is what Eccles says concerning Shakespeare's 10 quarters of malt:

&quot;This was a normal supply for household use; the schoolmaster,
Mr. Aspinall, had 11 quarters, and the vicar, Mr. Byfield, had six of
his own and four of his sister's.&quot; (Shakespeare in Warwickshire, p91).

Here is William Harrison's description of his household brewing

&quot;Nevertheless, sith I have taken occasion to speak of brewing, I will
exemplify in such a proportion as I am best skilled in, because it is
the usual rate for mine own family, and once in a month practised
by my wife and her maid-servants, who proceed withal after this
manner, as she hath oft informed me. Having therefore ground eight
bushels of good malt upon our quern, where the toll is saved, she
addeth unto it half a bushel of wheat meal, and so much of oats small
ground.... etc.&quot;

8 bushels, or 1 quarter per month, on an income of 40 pounds a year (Harrison
was a chaplian and a rector, not a wealthy man like Shakespeare). Since
the government would have allowed Harrison (if he had been alive in 1595)
a one year supply of malt, he would have been allowed 12 quarters.

Shakespeare was not a &quot;corn hoarder&quot;. He was a concerned family
man who ensured that the members of his household had sufficient
grain on hand to survive for a year in the event of his sudden death,
a common occurrence at that time, or even if he was merely detained
for business reasons in London for a long time.

&gt;&gt; snip of Kathman's sexist babble about &quot;curmudgeon.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Has Professor Crowley or Renaissance Giver of Commencement Addresses
&gt;&gt; Weir been consulted?

&gt;I looked up &quot;curmudgeon&quot; in the OED, Grummanm, and I had
&gt;to laugh out loud because for some centuries it appears that
&gt;lexicographers have believed that the etymology of
&gt;CURMUDGEON was CORN HOARDER.

&gt;The OED notes the correction:

&gt; The occurrence in Holland's Livy, 1600, of CORNMUDGIN (q.v.)
&gt; has led to a suggestion that this was the original form, with the
&gt; meaning concealer or hoarder of corn, mudgin being associated
&gt; with ME. much-en, mich-en to pilfer, steal, or muchier, Norman
&gt; form of OF. mucier, musser to conceal, hide away. But examination
&gt; of the evidence shows that curmudgeon was in use a quarter of a
&gt; century before Holland's date, and that cornmudgin is apparently
&gt; merely a nonce-word of Holland's, a play upon corn and curmudgeon.

&gt;Here's the CORNMUDGEON citation:

&gt; 1600 HOLLAND Livy IV. xv. 150 A rich corne-mudgin [L. frumentarius],
&gt; that with a quart (or measure of corne of two pounds) had bought the
&gt; freedome of his fellow cittizens. Ibid. XXXVIII. xxxv. 1004 The
&gt; fines that certeine cornmudgins [L. frumentarios] paid, for hourding
&gt; up..their graine.

"/>

Note that 'frumentarius' just means a corn-dealer, not a hoarder.

The Shorter Oxford (all I have space for) mentions a rare synonym
'curmullion'.There is a coincidence between these two words
(curmudgeon, curmullion) and the two words that were used for rum,
rumbustion and rumbullion. In the late 17th or early 18th century,
there was a preference for short words and a number of our
three-letter words originated then: 'mob', 'gin', 'phiz' and the like
(for mobile vulgus, genever and physiognomy respectively). At that
time rum became just rum.

Swift, A Complete Collection of Genteel and Ingenious Conversation
(ironically):
&quot;The only invention of late years, which has any way contributed
towards politeness in discourse, is that of abbreviating or reducing
words of many syllables into one, by lopping off the rest. This
refinement having begun about the time of the Revolution ...&quot; (i.e.
1688).

Maybe at some earlier time, there was an opposite tendency, when
people liked to add a meaningless ending to words that struck them as
unsatisfyingly short; these three-syllable ones, -ullion, -ustion,
-udgeon, being specially suitable for three-letter one-syllable words.
So rumbullion is rum and a curmullion is a cur?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;In fact, here are the OED citations prior to 1600 which show that
&gt;curmudgeon--contrary to the OED editors--could well be from CORN
&gt;HOARDER:

&gt;1. 1577 STANYHURST Descr. Irel. 102/2 in Holinshed, Such a clownish
&gt;Curmudgen.

&gt;Clownish curmudgeon is neutral although Jonson did make the point
&gt;that a corn hoarder can be a clown--or an eccho--in Every Man Out
&gt;of His Humor.

&gt;2. 1593 NASHE Christ's T. 85b, Our English Cormogeons, they haue
&gt;breasts, but giue no suck.

&gt;Nashe spells it COR-mundgeon and gives it the sense of &quot;hoarder.&quot;

&gt;3, 1604 T. WRIGHT Passions v. 289 Why do covetous cormogions
&gt;distill the best substance of their braines to get riches.

&gt;More sense of &quot;hoarding.&quot; Could it be Wright--who also uses
&gt;COR-mogion--is referring to the process of distilling malt from barley
&gt;which was also called corn or barley-corn?

&gt;Maybe the tradition that the Corn Hoarder died from a bout of
&gt;alcoholism comes from that etymological association.

&gt;It seems that the OED editors--who must have time on their hands--
&gt;have prepared a little pun:

&gt; The suggestion that the first syllable is cur, the dog, is perhaps
&gt; worthy of note;

&gt;Where's the usual citation? I don't see anything that suggests &quot;dog&quot;
&gt;between 1577 and 1600 and how is a &quot;dog&quot; a &quot;miser?&quot;

&gt; but that of Dr. Johnson's unknown correspondent, cur méchant
&gt; for F. méchant cur, evil or malicious heart, is noticeable only as
&gt; an ingenious specimen of pre-scientific etymology, and as having
&gt; been retailed by Ash in the form, from the French cur unknown,
&gt; and mechant a correspondent!

&gt;Exclamation point theirs.

&gt;Cur in English comes from the ME corre; canis villaticus, domesticus
&gt;probl from kurre, or korre from SW and Norw. dog. The OED shows
&gt;no French etymology for &quot;cur.&quot;

&gt;I can't believe that the OED editors would reconstruct the
&gt;etymology of a definition to make a little &quot;dog&quot; pun on
&gt;cur méchant. They must be really bored.

I did note that, yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's interesting because I saw &quot;mull&quot; as in &quot;mulled wine.:
One Look shows mull &quot;to heat wine and beer&quot; [heated beer? no thanks]
and the OED shows that &quot;mull&quot; may come from v. moil, as in to soften
or process something.

Anglo-Norman moiller, mouller, muiller to wet, to steep, to pester,
harass, and Middle French moiller, moillier to soak, moisten, stain,
wet, to drench (oneself), to become wet (c1050 in Old French as
moiler; French mouiller: cf. MOUILLÉ a.) and their etymon
post-classical Latin molliare to moisten (1291 in a British source,
1363 in Chauliac) &lt; classical Latin mollia, use as noun (e.g. in mollia
pnis soft part of bread) of neuter plural of mollis soft (see MOLL a.
and n.1). Cf. post-classical Latin molliare to soften (6th cent.),
variant of classical Latin mollre (see MOLLIENT a.). Cf. Old
Occitan molhar, moillar (12th cent.), Occitan molhar, Catalan mullar
(13th cent.), Spanish mojar (1270). With sense 2 cf. TURMOIL v.
3. Cf. MAUL v.2]

Mull--which has about a dozen definitions--in the n. means dust
or something fine as in ground malt [mult?] or the v. to grind so
we're definitely in the malt business here. Grinding, wetting, fermenting,
and then with 'mudgeon, hoarding.

I wonder why the OED editors didn't work this out. Cur is obviously
the slurring of &quot;corn&quot; since cornmudgeon or cornmillion requires a
hesitation between the n and m; corn-mudgeon. Iirc &quot;ilius&quot; in L.
denotes &quot;one who does 'that'&quot; in this case the wife who grinds the
barley into malt and keeps wetting it and drying it for the next several
months. The Will Shaksperes had at least 160 bushels--their legal
allotment and that hoarded lot--so that's a lot of lifting and stirring and
turning and carrying buckets of water.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There is a coincidence between these two words
&gt; (curmudgeon, curmullion) and the two words that were used for rum,
&gt; rumbustion and rumbullion.

"/>

In Stratford the cornmudgeon has a curmillion--Hathaway--to do all
the grinding and wetting and mulling and moiling while his transcendent
intellect turns to tallying up the revenues from usery, hoarding, pandering,
etc.

The OED shows rumbullion for the long form of &quot;rum&quot; although
I notice that it comes later than Shakespeare.

[Of obscure origin: cf. RUMBUSTION. In mod. Devon dial. rumbullion
is used in the sense of ?tumult, uproar?, but evidence of connexion is
wanting.]

Connexion? Is that a Britishism?

Rum. Also, a glass or drink of rum.

c 1651 in N. D. Davis Cavaliers &amp; Roundheads Barbados (1887) 112
The chiefe fudling they make in the Island is Rumbullion, alias
Kill-Devill, and this is made of suggar canes distilled, a hott, hellish

We've lost the sense of the Latin endings but they used to denote
the noun; ullion, ustion, udgeon, one who does [something]--sort
of the noun-verbs that Bacon invented in the Shakespeare plays,
probably from Latin. I wonder how much philology in the plays
has been deliberately ignored to protect the National Pest.

I also noticed why Bacon was so in love with the word &quot;moity&quot; in
his acknowledged works and the Shakespeare plays. it's OF for
&quot;wife.&quot; The pun between the Latin and French would literally mean
&quot;the other half.&quot;

No: 'medietatem', 'half', connected with 'medius'. The French usage

True, but Elizabeth Weird believes that &quot;Verulam means 'state of

&gt;&gt;Connexion? Is that a Britishism?
&gt; It's an example of the OED house style. Not everyone likes that style,
&gt; e.g. &quot;I would add that the comparatively frequent appearance in its
&gt; pages of the last letter of the English alphabet reflects the practice
&gt; of the Press, not my own&quot;, C. Hignett, History of the Athenian
&gt; Constitution (Oxford, 1952), close of the Preface.

I love the British because they produce Hignetts.

I should have been more clear. I've had a little Latin and
know those are English endings.

Again, I was unclear. Moitié is OF for &quot;wife.&quot; I just looked up
&quot;moiety&quot; in the OED and the third definition is the pun that popped
into my head. John Davies, once Bacon's secretary, makes a
similar pun on &quot;wife,&quot;&quot;moiety&quot; and &quot;better half.&quot;

3. humorous. One's wife or husband. Cf. better half s.v. BETTER a. 3.
Obs.

1611 J. DAVIES Scourge Folly cxx. 58 Yet sith I am the Moity of my
wife And one selfe Purse supporteth eithers life, I must confesse I am
the better for you.

Thanks for the discussion Robert. I'm impressed with your knowledge
of English.

Here's the rest of the OED etymology for moiety.

[&lt; Anglo-Norman and Middle French moitié (in Anglo-Norman also moité,
moitee, moeité, etc.) half, part of something, one of two parts of
something (of equal or unequal size) (c1100 in Old French in form
meitiet; 1552 in phrase ma fiere moitié denoting a beloved woman, 1610
in phrase sa plus chère moitié denoting a spouse; French moitié) &lt;
classical Latin mediett-, mediets.

1825 H. WILSON Mem. xiv, The injured husband had confined his frail
moitié in a madhouse ever since.]

If you're going to make up nonsense, at least make it believable. &quot;-on&quot;
is not a Latin ending in the first place.
