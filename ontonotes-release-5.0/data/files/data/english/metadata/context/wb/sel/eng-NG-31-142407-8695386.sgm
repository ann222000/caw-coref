and support the truth! &quot;The individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a
conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists&quot;. J. Edgar Hoover, FBI Director
1924-1972, quoted in The Elks Magazine (August 1956).

It is kind of a collection of articles pertaining to Bush which together paint an
entirely unchristian portrait of our commander-in-chief (and we thought Clinton was
bad!). In all honesty, none of our recent presidential administrations have even come
close to living up to God's righteous standard; but Bush is the man in office now, and
he has taken us to a new low. This site is dedicated to the honest revelation of
President Bush's religious beliefs and anti-Christ political policies. Please understand
that opposing Bush and the neo-conservative agenda does not make you a liberal Democrat!
While this site does contain articles written by liberal Democrats whose bias is easily
identified within their diatribe, the articles are included solely because I deem there
to be factual content behind the spin; not because I am in agreement with the ideology.
More importantly, this site likewise contains numerous articles penned by fellow
constitutional christians who likewise see Bush for what he is - in spite of being a
Republican.

President Bush, his father, and his grandfather are &quot;Bonesmen&quot; - members of the macabre
Skull and Bones secret society. The group meets in building known as The Tomb, and part
of the initiation process involves lying naked in a coffin and reveal sexual exploits.
The Bush's are also members of the elite Bohemian Grove where they attend annual pagan
rituals before the great &quot;Owl&quot; which admittedly includes mock human sacrifice!

esident.htm&gt; Christians seem to be among the most gullible people in the world. And
nowhere is this gullibility observed more than in the way Christians relate to politics.
It seems that many Christians are willing to swallow just about anything if it is
camouflaged in the garb of &quot;Christianity.&quot;

Alberto Gonzales:
Tip of the Iceberg

&lt; http://www.yourchristianpresident.com/Assets/Index%20Commentary/Artic...
0Gonzales-Tip%20of%20the%20Iceberg.htm&gt; As Democratic and Republican leaders alike pile
on to demand Alberto Gonzales' resignation, only George W. Bush is singing his praises.
It's not surprising that Bush would be pleased. Like a good soldier, Gonzales, who
claimed a faulty memory 70 times, was careful not to incriminate his bosses.

Who Makes Foreign Policy?

&lt; http://www.yourchristianpresident.com/Assets/Index%20Commentary/paul3... &gt; The
media, Congress, and the American public all seem to have accepted something that is
patently untrue: namely, that foreign policy is the domain of the president and not
Congress. This is absolutely not the case and directly contrary to what our founding
fathers wanted.

Bush is no Conservative

.

&lt; http://www.yourchristianpresident.com/Assets/Index%20Commentary/Artic...
282006.html&gt; President Bush passes himself off as a conservative Republican and a
born-again Christian. These are disguises behind which Bush hides. Would a Christian
invade another country on false pretenses, kill tens of thousands of innocent civilians,
and show no remorse or inclination to cease the aggression?

Are &quot;Paid For&quot; Christians Hypocrites in how they Vote?

I'm a Conservative Republican who refuses to back Bush/Cheney. The Bible tells me to
&quot;recognize them by their fruits.&quot; I am not a fascist, but I clearly see that Bush/Cheney
are fascists, and that they will tell you any lie to get you to buy off on their agenda.

How much longer will Christians continue to excuse President Bush's blatantly
anti-Christian policies and personal behavior? Is the 'R' representing his political
persuasion reason enough to cast a blind eye? The fact is that Bush's policies are
virtually identical to that of his predecessor, and yet Christians will shower Bush with
praise while nevertheless demonized Clinton. Ole Bubba himself is undoubtedly an immoral
man, but morality is an absolute - it does not change based upon the occupant of the
oval office. If it was wrong when Clinton did it, then it's wrong when Bush does it; to
suggest otherwise is hypocracy!

President Bush clearly wears religion on his sleeve for public consumption. Even so,
Clinton had likewise portrayed himself as Christian, and yet he was despised by most
fundamentalists. So why is it that Bush is more believable?

All of Bush's policies are extravagent extentions of Clinton's core socialistic
ideology. However, the difference, I believe, is that unlike Clinton, George W. Bush is
sincerely a religious man - broadly Christian - and yet twisted and macabre in ways most
people are unaware. In other words, what the Christian community as a whole fails to
understand is that Bush's version of Christianity is far from what is deemed
&quot;fundamental.&quot;

Case in point: President Bush, like his father and grand-father before him, is an
elitist. He is part of a cabal of individuals whom believe that they posess hidden
knowledge passed down through secret societies since the time of King Solomon; and
before. They believe that they are the &quot;enlightened ones,&quot; and that Christ has entrusted
them with ushering-in the prophesied millenium; the thousand years of world peace. They
believe that it is they, through Christ, whom will ultimately save mankind and rule over
the entire earth; a.k.a. the &quot;New World Order.&quot;

This site contains a vast archive of articles documenting the true Bush record. So
please suspend all preconceived notions, disregard his 'conservative' and
'compassionate' rhetoric, and focus solely upon his works; for Christ said that we shall
know them by their fruits.

For example, if you will, consider these very unchristian, unconservative Bush works:

*               During his inauguration, George W. Bush placed his left hand upon the
Holy Bible and took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,
yet since his swearing-in, the Constitution has been violated in almost every
conceivable manner. From FREE-SPEECH ZONES to WARRANTLESS SEARCHES to TORTURING
DETAINEES, Bush has systematically dismantled the very document that he swore an oath
before God to protect.

*               Bush's Department of Homeland Security is the biggest federal power grab
since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt. This trojan-horse poses a greater threat to our
personal liberties than standing armys. Centralizing military and law enforcement power
into the executive branch is the very definition of a Police State!

*               President Bush is the biggest spender in the history of the republic -
not just on military expenditures, but likewise on social programs. SOCIALISM is
unbiblical - God's word commands us to &quot;Love thy neighbor as yourself,&quot; which nullifies
favoritism and/or discrimination. Socialism boils down to government's forcible
extraction of assets from earners for redistribution among non-earners (or to whom-ever
officials feel can be persuaded to return the favor via the ballot-box). It should be
apparent that &quot;Compassionate conservatism&quot; is simply a neoconservative buzz-word for
their brand of socialism. True compassion is defined as the free-exercise of giving;
either of one's time, knowledge, or resources. Monies paid under duress - even for a
lofty purpose - is not compassion; it is theft. It matters not that it is by decree of
government nor by will of the majority, stealing is always a violation of God's Law!

*               Bush claims that the war in Iraq is necessary to prevent further
terrorism, nevertheless our borders remain wide-open. Furthermore, while there remain
many unanswered questions about September 11th and the subsequent absense of WMDs in
Iraq, Bush consistently objects to an independent investigation. We are simply supposed
to believe that our intelligent agencies were inept, but now they have been fixed.

*               Perhaps Saddam Hussein did use chemical weapons against his own people,
but the U.S. government did likewise when it gassed women and children at their church
in Waco, Texas. In that abhorent instance, the military was illegally utilized in
violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. A different administration - yes, but President
Bush has never held the previous administration responsible; and now Bush has publically
called for the dismantling of the Posse Comitatus Act.

*               While Bush has verbally taken a moral stand on homosexuality and
abortion, he has stacked his cabinet with pro-abortionists and homosexual activists.
Bush signed into law a bill which gives federal death benefits to same sex partners, and
a D.C. appropriations bill that allows same sex benefits. Bush has never asked Congress
to stop funding for Planned Parenthood, but he did send $15 billion of American taxpayer
money to the United Nations for HIV/AIDS programs in Africa - so Planned Parenthood can
push its sinister agenda there.

*               President Reagan withdrew from the anti-American UNESCO organization,
basically a global school board which supports the diabolical Earth Charter. President
Bush approves of UNESCO; thus, while our children are neither free to read from the
Bible nor mention the name of Christ in school, they are led to worship Mother Earth
under the guise of education. The Earth Charter is housed in an Ark of Hope which makes
its way around the country. True Christian should be able to see the blasphemous
implications.

*                Would a Christian pass laws to further erode parents' God-given rights
to educate their own children? Bush did just that with his &quot;No Child Left Behind Bill&quot;
which mandates further government intrusion into the very institution (government
schools) used to enforce the homosexual agenda upon our children. The Republican Party
used to run on the platform of dismantling the unconstitutional Department of Education;
however, we now have a Republican president pumping billions of additional dollars into
this ungodly system!
