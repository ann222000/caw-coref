People usually get what's coming to them...unless it's been
mailed.
---------------------------------

A group of young children were siting in a circle with their teacher. She
was going around in turn asking them all questions.

&quot;Davy, what noise does a cow make?&quot;

&quot;It goes moo.&quot;

&quot;Alice, what noise does a cat make?&quot;

&quot;It goes meow.&quot;

&quot;Jamie, what sound does a lamb make?&quot;

&quot;It goes baaa.&quot;

&quot;Jennifer, what sound does a mouse make?&quot;

&quot;Errr.., it goes.. click!&quot;
--------------------------------------------

A boy asks his father to explain the differences among irritation,
aggravation, and frustration.

Dad picks up the phone and dials a number at random. When the phone is
answered he asks, &quot;Can I speak to Alf, please?&quot;

&quot;No! There's no one called Alf here.&quot; The person hangs up.

&quot;That's irritation,&quot; says Dad.

He picks up the phone again, dials the same number and asks for Alf a second
time.

&quot;No -- there's no one here called Alf. Go away. If you call again I shall
telephone the police.&quot; End of conversation.

&quot;That's aggravation.&quot;

&quot;Then what's 'frustration'?&quot; asks his son.

The father picks up the phone and dials a third time:

&quot;Hello, this is Alf. Have I received any phone calls?&quot;
-------------------------------------------

A priest at a parochial school wanted to point out the proper behavior for
church. He was trying to elicit from the youngsters, rules that their
parents might give before taking them to a nice restaurant.

&quot;Don't play with your food,&quot; one second grader cited.

&quot;Don't be loud,&quot; said another, and so on...

&quot;And what rule do your parents give you before you go out to eat?&quot; the
priest inquired of one little boy.

Without batting an eye, the child replied, &quot;Order something cheap.&quot;
