Does SAGE currently include any functionality for manipulating Lie
algebras? (I only need reductive Lie algebras, because I'm using them
to study compact Lie groups.) For instance, I'd like to be able to
manipulate irreducibles (encoded by their highest weights), so that I
can form a tensor product and decompose it into irreducibles.

In specific instances (like GL_n) I know in principle to translate
such questions into terms compatible with the combinatorics
functionality we have from Symmetrica. But I want to experiment with
other cases (like Sp_n) and I'd rather simply work at the Lie algebra
level, without having to keep track of the combinatorics myself.

In any case, I'm likely to be bugging people about this at SAGE Days
7...

I think Sage doesn't include any nontrivial Lie functionality.   Probably
the best way to get it is to write an interface to Lie:

I just looked at the GAP docs, and I don't quite see how to do what I
want (decomposing some random thing into irreducibles, or at least
getting the multiplicity of the trivial representation), but I'm sure
it's possible.

What I do know is that Magma has some of this functionality,
implemented in a fashion that I can understand. So that could be one
possible interface model if we decide to wrap this functionality from
GAP, LiE, or elsewhere.

We already have an optional LiE spkg at http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/lie-2.2.2.p3.spkg
- and I think Mike Hansen did work at some point to wrap
functionality. Somebody please correct me if I got that somehow mixed
up.

Cheers,

Michael

I don't know how you want to specify &quot;some random thing&quot;. As a
tensor product of a list of irreducibles determined by their
highest weight?

I vaguely remember that Willem de Graaf wrote that too. Could easily be
wrong though... I'm ccing him, so he can chime in and correct me if he wants.

Hi Kiran,

Adding good Lie algebra support to Sage has been something on my list
for awhile. I just made it out here to Berkeley and am going to be
here all semester for the program at MSRI.  I was that you were
registered for the workshop next week.  What time do you get in?  We
can discuss things there.  Also, if there is anything in symmetrica
that you'd like exposed just let me know and I can do that right away.

In my case, I start with a single representation (given by the list of
highest weights of its irreducible components, specified with
multiplicities) and I want the multiplicity of the trivial
representation in some  tensor power of that. (I might generate that
initial representation by tensoring together some irreducibles, again
indicated by their highest weights.)

With Willem de Graaf's assistance, I have now Magma code that does
exactly this. (One has to be a bit careful, since there are two ways
to compute this. If you actually try to construct the tensor power and
then decompose it, you get hosed. Instead, you only &quot;construct&quot; it as
a list of highest weights, using some combinatorial method for
computing pairwise tensor product multiplicities.)

Ultimately I might need GAP after all, though, because I'm interested
in compact Lie groups which occasionally are not connected. In that
case, I'll need characters of finite groups too.

Anyway, I'm hoping to get together with Mike Hansen at MSRI next week
to discuss how things should look in SAGE. (I'll also be at SAGE Days
7 two weeks later.)
