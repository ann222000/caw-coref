How To Eat Like the French and Lose
Weight&lt; http://frenchfood.about.com/od/menusdiet/ht/eatfrench.htm?nl=1 &gt;

The French can eat leisurely multi-course meals filled with butter, cream
sauce, wine, and dessert… and never gain an ounce. Impossible? Non. You can
do it too. Here's how to incorporate their habits into your busy lifestyle:
*Difficulty: *Easy
*Time Required: *1 hour, daily
Here's How:

1.

*Eat Breakfast.* Dashing for the door with your keys, phone, and
coffee in hand? Being twenty minutes late for that mandatory morning meeting
is no excuse for skipping breakfast. Numerous studies have shown that people
are better able to maintain their weight when they eat breakfast regularly.
How does this relate to the French diet? The French never skip a meal. Grab
a yogurt, an apple, and a handful of nuts on the way out the door for an
easy energy boost that will boost your metabolism and fat-burning all day
long.
2.

*Be Careful On Coffee Breaks.* Snacking is virtually unheard of in
France. Now slowly back away from the muffin. It's as simple as that.
3.

*Eat a Full Meal.* This is one of the most perplexing habits that the
French embrace. They eat a full meal, usually consisting of several courses
that may include bread, cream sauces, dessert, and wine. The key is that
they slowly savor small portions. Buy petite dinner plates, serve small
portions, and enjoy your meal.
4.

*Sample the Garden.* French cuisine is full of fruit and vegetable
courses, many of them seasonal specialties. Take some time to visit your
produce section or local farmer's market and buy garden-fresh ingredients to
use in your kitchen.
5.

*Enjoy a Glass of Wine.* The French traditionally take pleasure in a
glass of wine with their meals. An antioxidant compound in grape skins
called resveratrol aids in weight loss and overall good health. Does this
give you permission to knock back cocktails with every meal or start
drinking on your lunch break? Not a chance! Just try to substitute wine for
other alcoholic beverages when you have the chance. And remember, always
drink alcohol responsibly – the French live long lives and so should you!
6.

*Get Active.* Don't be a slave to the elevator. Studies have found
that fitting in ten minutes of moderate activity periodically throughout the
day helps people maintain a healthy weight. The slender French are living
proof of this fact. They frequently walk places instead of using private or
public transportation. You don't need to train for a marathon. Just take the
stairs or park your car on the far side of the garage to sneak in extra
activity for yourself.
