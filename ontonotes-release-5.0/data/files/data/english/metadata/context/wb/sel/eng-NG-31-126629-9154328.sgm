Hi folks,
I have noticed over the past year that my 6 silver hatchet fish
(Gasteropelecus sternicla) have a wide range in size. I bought them in
two batches a couple months apart from two different retailers. I
would say the size range is about 1.5&quot; to 3&quot; (that guy is a monster,
he looks like a playing card swimming in my tank (but not
rectangular).

I'm not worried about it, but I'm curious why this happens. I remember
reading somewhere that SW clown fish will grow to a size that fits
their place in the pecking order and will even change genders if need
be (super paraphrasing here).

It's just odd to me that these fish could be so different when kept in
such a similar environment. Think maybe they were raised differently
at the breeder? I don't think the two groups I bought consisted of the
3 smaller ones then the 3 larger ones, they were mixed...

I guess there is not point to this post, just an observation really.
To close with an understatement, fish are cool.

I think there's a life stage where they grow very quickly if provided
the right foods.  The right foods later only result in a slower steady
growth.  This shows itself when you get different batches of fish and
they grow at different rates.  Keeping in mind that size does not
equal age, typically the younger fish in your care would have a growth
spurt, passing older fish which may have gone through their growth
burst window eating only flake food as juveniles.

There are several other variables, such as tank size, water
temperature and genetics, so the juvenile growth window is only part
of the story.  Pretty cool eh?

I started in the hobby some 45 years ago, breeding angels. By the 4th or 5th year, I had bred livebearer hi-breds, corys, tetras and a few others. Angels had the biggest different in the fry size. Some (runts) would still be 1/4&quot; while the larger part of the batch of fry would be 3/4&quot;. The giants within the same batch would be twice that size. As a breeder, I would keep the largest for future brfeeders - sell the mid sized, and cull out the runts. These fish were overfed 5 to 6 times a day - what they didn't eat was removed from the grow-out tanks after 15 min. or so, siphoning out about 20% of the water along with the uneater food and fish waste, and replaced with fresh water. Filtering in grow-out tanks was done with air driven sponge filters, 2,3,4, or 5, depending on the size of the tank. These filters were cleaned before lights out every night. Point is, the fry were all raised the same, and still came in all sizes........... Frank

Hey Frank, a question please. When you cull the runts, is it because they would get sick or have poor health? Or did they just look a bit wierd? Would they work in smaller tank setting?

The first few spawns, not knowing any better, I did try to save every one of the fry. The culls are anything and everything that is, or could be wrong with a fish. They grow wrong - bent spines, bad finage, wrong color or body shape, sickly - just not worth feeding. ie; picking breeders out from a batch of fry, one wouldn't want a small female because her spawns would be 1/4th to mabe even 1/2 the size of the spawn of a large female. Back then, I used to get $1.00 ea. for pure black lace vail angels dime size. With a small female breeder, half the spawn or more, would end up dead or culls - you might end up with 30 or 40 sellers. On the other hand, picking breeders from the giants amoung the spawn, I used to get 200 to 250 sellers from a pair of pure black lace vails - for the same amount of work...
I bred Black-Red Fined Hi-fin Lire-Tail Swords by artifical inslmination. My 5th year female breeders were 6&quot; long and would drop 200+ fry every 28/29 days with very few, if any culls. The young sold wholdsale for $3.00 a trio - 40 years ago. The males couldn't breed on their own, so the breeders would use plan Hi-Fin males to breed with the Hi-Fin Lyre-Tail females (down breeding). This way they would get a batch of 30 or 40 fry, mabe 20% Hi-Fin Lyre-Tails - the rest would be plain Hi-Fins or just plain swordtails. I was getting 100% true color Hi-Fin Lyre-Tails. Point is, at least back then, breeders tried to out do one another, so they culled alot. And back then, there were a lot of home breeders. Anymore, home breeders are few and far inbetween, and most of them don't cull and sell everything just to get that $. Home bred fish in a pet shop are almost a thing of the past. Now-a-days, one pays the same for a cull as the rest of the batch...........Frank

I read of male superior growth in angelfish broods. Whichever babies get
the slightest edge on the others continue increasing their growth at a
faster and faster rate. And they are usually males. I've been reading
what paltry little I've been able to find on the effects of pheromones
in the fish world. Most of what I've read has been pretty general, yes
they exist but no we still have a lot to learn about them. Pheromones
that inhibit the growth of neighboring fish may be a factor in the
legendary &quot;male superior growth&quot; phenomenon, in my poorly educated
humble opinion. I have this in mind as an important part of the reason I
do 90-100% water changes every day and sometimes every evening in my
tanks with the tiniest angels - up to around pea sized. I think I'm
removing pheromones with each water change. I've also come to view the
slime layer on the bottom of the tank as a bacteria bed, not all the
good kind but the kind that grows from food and fish waste. Baby fish
spend a lot of time poking around the bottom. So every 3 or 4 days I use
a paper towel to wipe down the floor of the baby tanks during the water
change. I began the bottom wipe down after seeing my first belly slider,
and since then I have not seen another one. I have two broods of very
young fish right now that I am specifically watching for the early
visible increase in growth rate among some. I'm advancing these two
broods of a few hundred each into larger tanks much sooner than I
usually do to try to reduce the influence of tank size. All baby tanks
have a sponge filter that I rinse daily, they collect stray brine shrimp
and junk quickly. Beginning at around 4 weeks, when they are moved into
larger aquaria, they get a box filter along with the sponge. Never had a
problem with babies getting sucked into a filter. Under these somewhat
controlled conditions I am seeing some growing faster than others and
some remaining as little runts. Meaning that so far I have proved nothing.

Amquel Plus lists among its features that it removes pheromones from the
water. I use it only for shipping, I only have a small amount of
chlorine in my tap water and there's not much nitrogenous buildup in
tanks that get daily water changes. Besides. The stuff gets expensive
for every day use in all those tanks. But I'm thinking of trying it
somewhere down the line in another growth comparison adventure.

At the pet shops that sell my fish, I insist that they do not scrawl
&quot;local bred&quot; across the tank. I ask them to display a small business
card stating that they are from Angelfish Gardens. And my primary pet
shop buyer keeps only my angels in a prominently displayed tank - no
other species and no &quot;local bred&quot; stock with sawed off dorsals or bent
pelvic fins that he gave someone store credit for out of the goodness of
his heart. This special display gives my angels sort of a special status
in the eyes of customers, and they are willing to pay the extra couple
of bucks. The lfs pays me 50% of his retail price. And his retail prices
are significantly higher than my mail order prices. I do wish he hadn't
chosen purple and clown vomit gravel for the display tank, but hey, I
just grow 'em, he knows what his customers go for.

I know you addressed this to Frank, and he replied, but I'd like to add
that culling is a ruthless process - Some angel breeder once said never
breed an angel that you would not be willing to enter into a show. When
I cull, my goal is that I won't sell a fish that I wouldn't be pleased
to display in one of my big tanks in the living room. This means poorly
shaped fins, runts, bumps or depressions where they're not supposed to
be, usually near the head. You mentioned runts specifically - my runts
usually have poor fin development - never growing the tall classic angel
fins but remaining shaped more like a cichlid. As the other brood
members grow bigger, the runts become even smaller in comparison because
they can't compete. I suppose they might be OK in a small tank where
they were the biggest fish. But I wouldn't sell or give one away for
that purpose. Those few that I've kept to watch for a few weeks
inevitably remain highly sensitive to the slightest dips in water
quality or chemisty. They die on their own. I know that talk of culling
tugs on the heartstrings, it tugs on mine a little every time I do it,
but there are enough bad fish being sold that I don't need to add my
rejects to the gene pool. In a typical brood of 300-400 babies, I may
cull as many as 150 or as few as a dozen, deformities and growth
problems can be genetic or can be environmental, but either way, they
don't belong in the market place. Especially with my name on them.
I shudder to think back 30 years on some of the pathetic specimens I
proudly traded to a pet shop for store credit. Coincident with this
topic, my calendar tells me that I've scheduled today to be a culling
day. Not a task I look forward to.

The Angelfish Society is the self appointed American Kennel Club of
angelfish. Their word is not gospel, but they've put a lot of time and
work into developing standards and they are worth taking a look at.

Hey there Mr. G.
I too have seen the male growth spurt. Why it happens....not a clue. I
figure it's just one of those things.
Bettas grow this way too. You'll have a few monsters in a batch of
fry, as long as some migits.
People's views on culling vary depnding on the situation in the hobby.
Some see culling as meaning only death.
To some of us it means separating the not so perfect from the perfect.
For me, fry that are deformed would go into a tank with either adult
angels or bettas. Nature takes it's course quickly.
Fry that are aren't deformed, but aren't breeder quality are fine to
be pets, so no killing needed.
For me personally, being on both sides of the hobby (hobby / breeder)
I have to find a happy medium for me.
I'm not going to kill fry because they're coloring isn't perfect.
Birth defects are a differrent story though.
However, those defects can sometimes turn into the new version of the
fish, such as is the case with Betta finnage now.
So there's a grey area there.

I'm not one of those folks who just breeds anything to get fish to

Because I've never been a large scale breeder, I consider myself a

*must* both be worthy of breeding, period!

That slime layer on the bottom is mainly heterophate bacteria, which break down solids - uneaten foods, fish waste, and those baby fish that spend most of their time on the bottom the first few days. It forms really fast when feeding 5 and 6 times a day. I took the eggs from the breeders (that way the breeders will lay once a week). Removed any off color eggs 2 or 3 times a day and kept a count of the good eggs/wigglers, before they dropped to the bottom - then counted the free swimmers a few days later. The difference (sometimes quite a bit), is how often the bottom is wiped off. Try every night and see how much of a difference it makes...

I'm advancing these two &gt;broods of a few hundred each into larger tanks much sooner than I usually do to &gt;try to reduce the influence of tank size.

My grow-out tanks were 29gal. Baby fish were moved into 4 different tanks by size within the first 4 weeks. A cup of bleach was added to one tank, the runts and culls. Two tanks (the mid sized fish) were put into 70 to 100 gal.old ice box liners that were turned into grow-out vats and the tank with the largest babys were put into 2' x 2' x 6' - 180gal. home made glass front plywood tanks, which 6 &quot;to-be&quot; breeders were picked from. The fish sold to stores came out of the ice box liners - the ones out of the plywood tanks were sold out of my stores...grin.............. Frank

Back in my breeder days, I entered and later judged a lot of fish shows. Color is judged the same as fins, body shape and deportment. Sometimes color has the greater amount of points to be given or taken. ie; it's a whole lot easyer to breed a show quality red swordtail or platy, than a pure black, or hi-bred pure black with blood red fins. A friend bred bettas - worked 6 years to come up with a black body yellow fined betta. Or discus - one would not want, or shouldn't breed a cheaper brown to a power blue and expect to sell the offspring - - - - - - well, now-a-days I guess some, or most stores would buy them.

So there's a grey area there.

Yes, but there shouldn't be................. Frank

That's some serious counting - I don't do any water changes while the
eggs are on the slate. After day 3, any wigglers that haven't left the
slate get strongly encouraged to vacate the premises with a pursuasive
blast of the turkey baster and the slate is removed. I do very careful
50% or so water changes for the next few days, while the wigglers are
still clumping together. By day 5 or 6 I can pretty well see what's
wigglers and what's debris, so I siphon wigglers and attached debris
into a white plastic cereal bowl where I use a 5 ml bulb syringe to
gently blow wigglers apart from debris and return the wigglers to their
hatching container, which has been cleaned and filled with fresh water.
I do this transferring to a cereal bowl thing until they're free
swimming, usually day 7, and from then on it's the once or twice a day
90% water changes. Each time I do anything in the water during the first
week, I add a few drops of MarOxy. The stuff is really good at keeping
fungus down. I have a video and a still shot of week old wigglers in
their cereal bowl on my web site.

I miss the days when I could plunder the town dump and bring home stuff

I used to buy them from the local junk man when ever I could. The guy got $5.00 ea. for them. Just about everybody in the local fish club had his #. He also sold 5 gal. glass acid jugs for $10.00 ea.(brine shrimp hatchery).....

I remember when you first started breeding your angels - didn't think you were going to stick with it once you tryed a few spawns. Most would-be breeders give up by then. Not as easy as it sounds, is it?
You just have the one breeding pair, or is it two now? You raise blacks also, don't you?
May as well start breeding cory cats as well. I used to hatch them out right along with the angels - doesn't cost any more to feed them and they sure do help keeping the grow-out tanks clean. Albinos were the best sellers when I was into breeding and when we had the stores............... Frank

I am now wondering if the same general rules about the faster frowing
fry tend to be males is applicable to discus?  With my lot, there is a
very noticeable size difference between the fish.  They have always
been kept together so there has definitely been no difference in
hausbandry or water conditions to account for it unless it is a case
of the lucky few get the breaks when very young and never look back.
I would be great if that was a definite way of determing sex as I seem
to only have one male out of say 9 adult discus (lucky guy!) so I
could do with another one or two.  I still find it very hard to sex
them when looking at them in the LFS when they are still juvies and to
buy the adult ones costs a small packet and you really dont know what
you are getting (in the way of egg munchers etc).  Spawning pairs sell
for $400.00 a pair which is a ridiculous price (for me).

I think grey area's have their place in the hobby. People and their love affair with the hobby evolve; they learn about fish and their environments, make mistakes, find new resources on the 'net, learn more as different people find lists like this, the time people have to spend with their fish changes, the money they are willing to or can spend on the hobby changes, their tastes change...

As long as the grey area doesn't involve the health of a fish I think it may be OK. A cull may be one thing to a person who wants to spend their time, attention and money on fish to show; it may be a thing of beauty to a beginner and it may be another thing to a person somewhere in between.

As is the case with so many of us, tropical fish have been a part of my
life since the late 1960s. Through my raising a family and chasing the
career years I've always had at least one tank going, and have played on
and off with spawning. A couple of years ago, Missus Gardener, who
God(ess) has decided shall spend most of her life in a recliner in the
living room asked me to get the Old 55 going again and fill it with
angels. So that Christmas was spent almost entirely on aquarium
supplies. I knew that pet store angels were a waste of money, so I found
mine from a breeder in Utah. Decided to set up some spawning tanks, and
after a few months of great reviews from local pet stores I decided to
take it to the limit. Social Security doesn't have a provision for
expensive hobbies, so I knew I was going to have to make my hobby pay
for itself. And it is. I'm not losing money, I'm making a little more
each month. My web site has only been up since August, and I'm pretty
pleased with the responses. And no, it's not as easy as it sounds. It
requires a serious commitment to tend those babies every day, every few
hours.  But it's better than sitting up all night in freezing rain in
the barn helping a goat get through a difficult labor and delivery. Now
THAT takes commitment.

Funny you mention that. I've raised corys in the past and judging from
what I see in the pet shops, albinos are as popular as ever. They are
far from my ideal as far as attractive corys go, but yes, I will be
adding some corys to my lineup soon. Probably just sell them to the
local shops, I don't see a big demand for corys on the internet. I've
also spent a few years working with fancy guppies - I began with a trio
of Wassermans and really enjoyed the challenges of keeping the line
strong. Fancy Guppies and Angelfish appear to be the biggies for
internet merchants. Now that I think of it, Fancy Guppies required as
much as or even more ruthless culling that angelfish.

I have 4 pairs that are actively breeding every 10 days, 3 black pair
and one koi/zebra pair that produces the &quot;Tie Dyes&quot; which have been
selling at a rate that I can't keep up with. I have a couple dozen
blacks that are around 9 months old and beginning to sort themselves out
and pick their mates - I'm looking for some pairs to continue my line
and also to market as proven breeders - there are some serious dollars
to be made from young, proven breeders.

I've got the business on hold for now, I've had a couple of seriously
bad incidents with my shipper and I'm setting up with UPS. Man, they're
expensive. At the same time, I'm test driving various levels of heat
packs and extra box insulation 'cuz no matter where my fish are headed,
they must begin their journey here in COLDville. Which reminds me, I
need to spend some time updating my web site to reflect some new policies.

I think that for the next few months most of the country will have shipping issues on the sending end, receiving end or in the middle - Chicago airports will be chilly probably for the next 6 months.

I enjoy prowling the LFS's, thinking how some of the 'when we win the big lottery' money will be spent. Even when I go in to get supplies, not fish, I look around. I see Angels who are Koi, but, not double black ones. I've only seen double blacks available thru breeders online. So, if someone really wants fish like that they'll spend the money on shipping - especially if they feel they can trust the breeder.

People might also be willing to spend money on a better quality of some breeds of fish than others. Some people might be happy with Wal-Mart Betta's and want to spend the money to get better quality Angels like Mr G's are.

Was it USPS that messed up? My dad is retired from working like 30 or
40 years of his life at usps and has always told me to never send
anything through usps if it is fragile, he says (and I don't now if
this applies to priority) the &quot;guerillas&quot; in back toss and throw
packages into bins to sort them out and if you are sending something
fragile then at this point it would make sense to use another shipper.
And this comes from a loyal employee (albeit retired). Good luck with
ups - I have had excellent results with them with the computer stuff I
have had them ship for me for over a decade now. Good luck all and
later!

Yes. It was USPS Express guaranteed overnight. In my experience with the
company, I have found some highly conscientious and caring employees.
And I have found some of the other kind as well. Problems didn't come
from rough handling, they came from next day guaranteed shipments that
got lost in the system for 3 or 4 days in a couple of cases. I'm not
talking Priority, I'm talking Express, which is handled completely
differently from Priority, but unfortunately, the results were often the

I see. By the way - I use ken's fish too for fish food. Combined with
the extra inexpensiveness of the food I get from ken's fish and the
auto feeders I use which tend to keep me from ever overfeeding I have
to order food from ken's fish only once or twice (maybe three but I
doubt even that) a year. Usually I get the premium guppy flake food
and they seem to always throw in some free spirulina fish flake food
too, I order one 5-pound package each order. Good luck and later! By
the way - I am sorry to hear that express wasted some of your orders;
I always try to hope for the best in everything as much as I can.
