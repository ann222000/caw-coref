I'm fairly new to this group but been really enjoying most of the
discussion that goes on here about one of my fav TV programs ever.

The only thing that confuses me is TOPposter's input to the
discussions. He/she just seems to post regular, unfunny and inane
comments on any descent thread. Its not like he/she gets any kinda
response from anyone (I'm assumming the killfile option has been
exercised by most of you).

So what is TOPposter all about? Sorry, TOPposter, I don't get ya. Are
you trying to be funny?

Let me spread this question to appropriate groups.

Top Poster is a scum Troll to the Nth degree.

A couple of years ago I got him kicked off only
to find him back thanks to an unaccountable Usenet server
call Sisna which I assume a local Edmonton Alberta Canada
ISP called tear-byte is using.

Deluded and slanderous, this turkey exists from scumspace.

Well, TopPoster seems to be stalking doc ... @doctor.nl2k.ab.ca, and

doc ... @doctor.nl2k.ab.ca seems to post regular, unfunny and inane comments

I do not exaggerate when I say that TOPposter's sole &quot;contribution&quot; to
this newsgroup appears to be to post endless and stupid one-line
&quot;rebuttals&quot; to posts made by The Doctor [commonly known as Yads].  I
have no idea if the first few were ever funny, but repeating a joke
literally hundreds (if not thousands) of times is just tiresome.  And
frankly, a sign of needing psychiatric treatment.

Yads himself has the equally tiresome habit of responding with barely
comprehensible comments such as &quot;DFlames flames again&quot; whenever DBurns
posts, but at least that's not the entirety of his output; not that
much else of what he says tends to make a great deal of sense, though!

Some of the other posters around here seem even more disturbed, but
you'll recognise 'em soon enough when you read their posts.

And now I've finally done what I swore not to do: join in with the
interminable &quot;meta&quot; debates on this newsgroup!  Fully half the
discussions on here seem to be diatribes about other posters, or other
such pointless drivel.  No wonder fans of sci-fi programmes have a
reputation for not understanding normal human interaction...!   If
some of the people here behaved in pubs how they regularly behave on
this group, they'd spend most of their weekends recovering from being
beaten up!  {sigh}

&gt; TOPposter is probably one of the sharpest wits on this group. He takes
&gt; the piss out of one of the most obnoxious dorks here (the poster who
&gt; calls himself &quot;The Doctor&quot; - or Yads as we call him). Sure, TP's one
&gt; liners can be cruel, sometimes they don't work, but that's comedy.
&gt; Basically TP's one liners cut through the fanwank. He makes me laugh
&gt; anyway, and although I'm no longer contributing here (only *you* can
&gt; see me Jeff) I still drop by to see TOPposter wind up that dozy twat
&gt; Yads.
">

Talk about horses for courses.  I find TP as funny as a migrane.  I
know that I occasionally snipe at Yads because, well because he is
Yads I suppose, but TP is predictable and IMHO not at all funny.

I don't know, but given your apparent antipathy to Yads,  is it &quot;My
enemy's enemy is my friend&quot; which is applied here?

&gt;&gt; So what is TOPposter all about? Sorry, TOPposter, I don't get ya. Are

&gt;I do not exaggerate when I say that TOPposter's sole &quot;contribution&quot; to
&gt;this newsgroup appears to be to post endless and stupid one-line
&gt;&quot;rebuttals&quot; to posts made by The Doctor [commonly known as Yads].  I
&gt;have no idea if the first few were ever funny, but repeating a joke
&gt;literally hundreds (if not thousands) of times is just tiresome.  And
&gt;frankly, a sign of needing psychiatric treatment.

&gt;Yads himself has the equally tiresome habit of responding with barely
&gt;comprehensible comments such as &quot;DFlames flames again&quot; whenever DBurns
&gt;posts, but at least that's not the entirety of his output; not that
&gt;much else of what he says tends to make a great deal of sense, though!

&gt;Some of the other posters around here seem even more disturbed, but
&gt;you'll recognise 'em soon enough when you read their posts.

&gt;And now I've finally done what I swore not to do: join in with the
&gt;interminable &quot;meta&quot; debates on this newsgroup!  Fully half the
&gt;discussions on here seem to be diatribes about other posters, or other
&gt;such pointless drivel.  No wonder fans of sci-fi programmes have a
&gt;reputation for not understanding normal human interaction...!   If
&gt;some of the people here behaved in pubs how they regularly behave on
&gt;this group, they'd spend most of their weekends recovering from being
&gt;beaten up!  {sigh}
