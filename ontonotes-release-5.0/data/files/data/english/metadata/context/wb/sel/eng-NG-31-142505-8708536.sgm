To the obvious tune:

I'll tell a tale so moving that it's sure to make you snivel,
A turkey learned to peck the keys and post a pile of drivel,
Its owner found this tiresome, and he cried, &quot;Come here, let's have
youse,&quot; [1]
He put it on a lorry that went straight to Bernard Matthews.

Joe the tragic turkey lived in a house,
He found a home computer with a keyboard and a mouse,
He posted, &quot;Gobble gobble,&quot; as his head turned red and blue,
And the turkey farm was riddled with endemic Avian Flu.

Old Matthews came from Norfolk. One day he said &quot;By 'eck,
Thou'st ample weight and ample girth,&quot; and wrung the bugger's neck,
They sent the frozen carcass to a Tesco's store in Surrey,
A housewife cooked it lovingly and made it into curry.

Joe the tragic turkey lived in a shed,
He finished life infused with Eastern spices, like I said,
The other turkeys all began to squawk, &quot;Remember Joe?
Old Farmer Matthews should have had him slaughtered years ago.&quot;

The moral of my story is the simplest you could get,
Domesticated poultry shouldn't post stuff on the Net,
With brains the size of garden peas they've nothing new to say,
And they find it hard to type because their beaks get in the way.

Joe the tragic turkey lived, wrote and died,
They sent him to the butcher to be roasted, stewed or fried,
Though turkeys post a better style of story than a ferret,
None of it shows any kind of literary merit.

Ken Johnson

Apologies to Leonard Lipton, Peter Yarrow, Paul And Mary. I wonder
what happened to them.

[1] You can make &quot;have youse&quot; rhyme with &quot;Matthews&quot; if you really try
hard.

Hey, surviving leukemia at senior citizen age is doing just
_fine_ in my book. She's the oldest of the trio, at around
71 years old. Stuff starts to wear out on a pretty regular
basis by that age.

know what is.

i suppose i should feel lucky; so far the only major repairs to
the infrastructure have been the cataract surgery and the first
stage of the dental reconstrucion work. i can still eat,
breathe, excrete, and sit up without technical assistance,
although if i stand up for too long, my lower back complains
rather loudly. i just hope that your girlfriend likes being
on top...
