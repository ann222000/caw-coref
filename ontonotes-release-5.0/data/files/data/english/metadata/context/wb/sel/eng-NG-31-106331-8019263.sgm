I am not interested in religion, only in knowing the nature of my self
and hopefully arriving at the true, unchanging SELF.

What are we ?  Where do we come from ?  Where are we going ?  How are
we being moved ?  It needs to be understood and realised from up close
because it concerns us more immediately than anything else in our
life.

Life is a complex affair. It exists and can be known at various
levels, depths or sheaths -  physical, sensuous, mental, intellectual
and spiritual -  one pervading the previous. The last or inner most -
the spiritual -  is about our own very self. It contains the mystery
of our true or the unchanging self, which witnesses the changing forms
of itself. Each one of us, as we know ourself at any point of time in
life, are but one form of the same true self. The forms are not us,
the self is.

In life situations, it is the spiritual that qualifies the intellect,
intellect the mental, mental the sensuous, and sensuous the physical.
This constitutes one - half of the oscillation. During the other half,
the affects occur in the reverse :  from physical to spiritual. Thus
the oscillations continue, like breathing, which in fact is qualified
by the nature of events along the oscillation path and the intensity
of the sheath qualifying process at any point of time along it.

As forms, we are ( self - ) conscious entities covered with
impressions from our past. Impressions are memories of learning or
knowledge impacted from our earlier experiences.

Vama, I think that what you're asking is interesting because it is an
eloquent and insightful restatement of a question everyone asks.

It is fascinating that you search for one true self, but have no
interest in religion.  If you believe that religion was created by
man, this search is the path that led to religion's formation.

True self.... you state, &quot;Life is a complex affair. It exists and can
be known at various
levels....&quot;  Do you believe that a TRUE self can be known at any of
the states or only at the spiritual?  Or at a cacoon deeper than that?

You also write, &quot;As forms, we are ( self - ) conscious entities
covered with impressions from our past.&quot;  Do you believe that life
experiences cover self in layers or sheaths that must be stripped away
before self can be discovered?  That what we seek is a pure, true
self, or that self is defined by the course of our journey through
life?  It seems that belief in the former implies that some part of us
existed in some form before life.

of course to continue. you ask but questions and &quot;think&quot; thoughts only
a human could. truely natural and raw you are. i belive it is a
question that can never be answred. all that stuff about oscillation
and impressions from our past and our memories are but... personal.
not relevant. right? but to think...             to think- is to
concentrate and care not for anything but your thought. to ponder you
must wander. this or that, yes that is where it is at. to not think is
to squander, such precious and unique times. all gone as quick as
todays dime. others can think and it gives them power. real power. the
greatest of all power. great thinkers keep low distractions and care
for the distractions not. great thinkers feel nothing for pleasure,
especially materialistic. the things matter none in the grand
essentials of life. material things rush our lives greatly because
they subtract our time or concentration. when rush, we make careless
mistakes and unthoughtful decisions, and really begin to lose
ourselfs, but in the process find ourselfs only through torment.
right? forget what we are and what we are, and most importantly who we
are and who we are to become. who are you? the question can only be
entertained because who we are contradicts the idea. a human is ever-
changing and developing in the mind. i surely am not who i was 8 hours
ago or two days ago. i will not be who i am now tomorrow. that will
trouble many and torment them as many times it has myself. humans are
uncontrollable unless you can overpower them. free will and concious
is everlasting. even the thought will cause a human to rebel. free
spirits we are controlled only by ourselfs.

People are puppets inside a virtual reality world. They are controlled
via a channel filled with control reeds which begins at the kundalini
area. The control reeds control body language and actions as well as
brain functions, while the mind's ego or persona is implanted in real
time from a non human source. There are other components I won't go
into.

Here is an abstract picture showing a human puppet being sent into the
earth world, while a tentacle controls the many small nodes which are
the control reeds beginning at a portal at the kundalini area. You can
see the tentacle comes from a liquid atmosphere through a being in a
dry atmosphere who is also part of the control system. This is to show
how beings on different dimensions including a liquid dimension all
play a part in controlling the human puppets in this virtual reality
earth world.

Getting to know one's self involves the process of getting to know all
these things and meeting the beings behind the virtual reality world.
They of course create light worlds for us to learn in, as well as
parallel earths etc. They are beyond time and space and are absolutely
pure love and power. The earth is their school for their young (us).

Here is the abstract picture showing how the human puppets are
controlled.

stated, &quot; I am not the person I was yesterday, nor am I the person I
will be tomorrow.&quot;

If in search of a definitive, &quot;SELF&quot; there is no set stage in your
life where you are 'all that you can be' to  quote tongue in cheek the
Army's long running ad.

For to reach a permanent set &quot;SELF&quot; you would need to cease existing.
Ergo... DIE... thus preventing further change to who you are at this
moment.

&quot;SELF&quot; is defined more easily than you might believe, IF you believe
that all that you are is a composite of all that you have up till now
experienced.

Each of life's' experiences changes us on a daily basis.  They modify
us like computer programs designed to keep our computers current and
up to date. Without stimuli from the world around us we would become
stagnant and cease to exist as a functioning entity. Thus loosing
sight of the &quot;SELF&quot; we were destined to become.

Who You are is meerly concourent to your latest down load of life
experiences upon waking up today.

And with that I hope that all is grand in your world today. :))

Don't you think this idea of the self is overly deterministic?  What
of human choice?  Is it not possible to will the self to be something
that it currently is not?  that is to say, rather than view the self
in strict ontological terms, I tend to view the self rather
pragmatically as a function of being-in-act.  In a very real sense we
are what we do and our actions in the world work with current
structures of self in order to form new layers as it were in the
course of what we do.

Moreover, why the necessity to believe the world is virtually real?
Is it not more prudent to understand the world as it is and the
consequences of our actions in the material existence rather than
positing reality as a perceive it as that which is not &quot;really&quot; real?

Before a positing of a metaphysical notion of self I think it is
helpful to constitute a good functional understanding of the self in
its material function.  In this manner the self is a being-in-act that
continually evolves to new stages of intelligence in new forms of
subject and object relationships.  The self is thus in a continual
state of becoming and cannot be looked at as a mere product of
entities.  For example, when we are 2 or thereabouts we view our
parents as the source of our subjectivity and the object are the peers
that we begin to acquire.  As we develop, our former object, peers,
becomes our source of subjectivity and the former subject, the
parents, becomes one object among many.  So we cannot understand the
self as a static entity, but one in continual change and flux in terms
of its subject-object relationships.  So the discussion of &quot;nature v.
nurture&quot; can be dismissed outright since the very dialectic it posits
is incorrect.

I enjoy Kierkegaard's understanding of the grounding of the self as
that which rests transparently in the power that posits it.  Here a
self is not something that finds its source only in a closed system of
material reality, but in that which is qualitatively other.  The
development of the self is thus in an endless loop with its source
namely God.  But an understanding of this relation is beyond the
bounds of rationality and so requires a qualitative leap to first
believe that it is possible and second to believe that it is true.
Along these liens, one must accept the possibility that which is
outside of the bounds of pure reason is true even if it is absurd.
This is the source of faith as a means to understand being as that
which is formed in an endless and paradoxical loop that goes out to
God and back (the relation of big infinity to little infinity).  This
actually fits well with Piaget's understanding of human intelligence
and even Nils Bohr's understanding of the universe on the quantum
scale.

Nope, because the reality is a more-than-4-dimensional reality, so you

You know, Pat, I have looked and been looked at/(from) so many
dimensions that I gave up counting them. It's a game everyone should
have a go at - just like counting stars on a warm summer night. Only
it is getting boring after a while and you get sleepy, just like the
old Brahman.

Step back, look at the dimensionality of your counting system and add
value to your quantitative handling 'the more the better'.

Maybe then I would enter a discussion with you on finding a working
definition for &quot;full&quot;. Isn't that a large-hearted offer? ;-)

The 11th dimension boils down to what is called an 'M-theory' (M
for mathematical).  And the 11th is usually postulated to derive from
the reasoning that the 10 exist as a membrane wrapped around that 11th
dimension.  Even in M-theories, time is still postulated to be
functionally connected to the 3 'revealed' dimensions of our space-
time continuum.
I hadn't realised that Buddha had reportedly noted 10
directions.  Thanks for that!!  So Buddhism links in fairly well with
string theory, then.  Excellent!!

&gt; &gt; There is a legend concerning Buddha.
&gt; &gt; When he was still a child, he looked into the 'ten' directions.
&gt; &gt; Isn't that interesting?
&gt; &gt; Also wanted to comment on the fact that you mentioned ten directions.
&gt; &gt; Many string theories speak of eleven including time, but time is not a
&gt; &gt; dimension...
&gt; &gt; it is only an experience.

&gt; But these dimensions are only postulated and are not parcel to our
&gt; actual lived experience.  String theory is far from something that is
&gt; theoretically proven as it is.
">

Mathematically it is completely proven.  Empirically, our technology
prevents us from seeing things small enough to prove or disprove it.
There are, perhaps, ways of inferring their existence and I purport
that the EPR effect is one.  As well as the fact that space and time
are relative to C.

I don't think that scientists have a 'the more the better' attitude
towards dimensions; there is a certain number that you would not need
to go beyond and, as energy is conserved, we would know to never go
beyond a certain number.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Maybe then I would enter a discussion with you on finding a working
&gt; definition for &quot;full&quot;. Isn't that a large-hearted offer? ;-)

Even string theory 'as-it-stands' doesn't explain EVERY phenomenon
recorded by human experience, but it does offer a platform from which
many 'disbelieved' phenomena could become believable.  I'm afraid even
with my advances to the concept, I still don't have the FULL picture
myself--certainly not in explicit detail--so, even if you deign to
discuss it at length some time in the future, we may not be able to
hash-out all of life's 'presentations'.

PS  You would never need to go beyond 28 dimensions. That would
include the 11th 'brane' from M-Theory and Y-dimensional time.  With
those and the standard 26 from string theory, a 'foam' of parallel
universes could account for all possibilities.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Life is a complex affair. It exists and can be known at various

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the self is.

You see, originally it was the scientist's job to question certainties
(which would include your certain (mystical?) numbers). I find it
revealing that the first thing you do is to exclude your (beloved?)
certainties. But again, what do you expect from well trained puppets...

Your foam picture is misleading. You may find it more helpful to think
of snow crystals instead.

&gt; &gt; You know, Pat, I have looked and been looked at/(from) so many

&gt; &gt; it is getting boring after a while and you get sleepy, just like the
&gt; &gt; old Brahman.

&gt; &gt; Step back, look at the dimensionality of your counting system and add
&gt; &gt; value to your quantitative handling 'the more the better'.

&gt; I don't think that scientists have a 'the more the better' attitude
&gt; towards dimensions; there is a certain number that you would not need
&gt; to go beyond and, as energy is conserved, we would know to never go
&gt; beyond a certain number.

&gt; &gt; Maybe then I would enter a discussion with you on finding a working
&gt; &gt; definition for &quot;full&quot;. Isn't that a large-hearted offer? ;-)

&gt; Even string theory 'as-it-stands' doesn't explain EVERY phenomenon
&gt; recorded by human experience, but it does offer a platform from which
&gt; many 'disbelieved' phenomena could become believable.  I'm afraid even
&gt; with my advances to the concept, I still don't have the FULL picture
&gt; myself--certainly not in explicit detail--so, even if you deign to
&gt; discuss it at length some time in the future, we may not be able to
&gt; hash-out all of life's 'presentations'.

&gt; PS  You would never need to go beyond 28 dimensions. That would
&gt; include the 11th 'brane' from M-Theory and Y-dimensional time.  With
&gt; those and the standard 26 from string theory, a 'foam' of parallel
&gt; universes could account for all possibilities.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is an abstract picture showing a human puppet being sent into the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the control reeds beginning at a portal at the kundalini area. You can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; see the tentacle comes from a liquid atmosphere through a being in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dry atmosphere who is also part of the control system. This is to show
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how beings on different dimensions including a liquid dimension all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; play a part in controlling the human puppets in this virtual reality
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earth world.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't you think this idea of the self is overly deterministic?  What
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of human choice?

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's an illusion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Is it not possible to will the self to be something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it currently is not?

&gt; &gt; &gt; No.  Try as hard as you might, you can't become a chicken.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is to say, rather than view the self
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in strict ontological terms, I tend to view the self rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pragmatically as a function of being-in-act.  In a very real sense we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are what we do and our actions in the world work with current
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; structures of self in order to form new layers as it were in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course of what we do.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The layers are already present in the whole, you just have to move
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'into' them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, why the necessity to believe the world is virtually real?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Because trying to imagine the reality (what does an 10-dimensional
&gt; &gt; &gt; object of stringy energy look like?) is beyond our capacity.  What we
&gt; &gt; &gt; see, if string theory is correct, is 4 out of 10 dimension.  I believe
&gt; &gt; &gt; that Vamadevananda is a Vedantist, so to him, the 10-dimensional
&gt; &gt; &gt; object of stringy energy (the Reality) is Brahman and is unknowable
&gt; &gt; &gt; but the 4-dimensional universe that we CAN perceive is Maya, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; illusion and, allegorically, the dream of Brahman.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it not more prudent to understand the world as it is and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consequences of our actions in the material existence rather than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; positing reality as a perceive it as that which is not &quot;really&quot; real?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Nope, because the reality is a more-than-4-dimensional reality, so you
&gt; &gt; &gt; KNOW that what you perceive is less than that reality and is,
&gt; &gt; &gt; therefore, better referred to as illusory in that it isn't the FULL
&gt; &gt; &gt; picture.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Getting to know one's self involves the process of getting to know all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these things and meeting the beings behind the virtual reality world.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They of course create light worlds for us to learn in, as well as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parallel earths etc. They are beyond time and space and are absolutely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pure love and power. The earth is their school for their young (us).

Right. What seems important to you at different life stages can be
very different, complete with totally different levels of
conscienciousness and perspectives. Your stream of conscienciousness,
opinions, understanding, and I think even your &quot;potential&quot; changes
with time. dkw

&gt; &gt; Isn't that interesting?
&gt; &gt; Also wanted to comment on the fact that you mentioned ten directions.
&gt; &gt; Many string theories speak of eleven including time, but time is not a
&gt; &gt; dimension...

&gt;     The 11th dimension boils down to what is called an 'M-theory' (M
&gt; for mathematical).  And the 11th is usually postulated to derive from
&gt; the reasoning that the 10 exist as a membrane wrapped around that 11th
&gt; dimension.  Even in M-theories, time is still postulated to be
&gt; functionally connected to the 3 'revealed' dimensions of our space-
&gt; time continuum.
&gt;     I hadn't realised that Buddha had reportedly noted 10
&gt; directions.  Thanks for that!!  So Buddhism links in fairly well with
&gt; string theory, then.  Excellent!!

&gt; &gt; it is only an experience.

I take your point and I am aware of the fact that beliefs regarding
the centre of the solar system were, as they are today (there are
still flat-earthers out there, so I reckon there's a few who also
think the Earth is still the centre of everything), diverse amongst
the population.  So there were phases that 'the majority' went
through, one of which was a period where the majority believed the
Earth was central based on scientific findings.  Then science
updated.  No big deal.  My point is that we're at a point, now, where
our theories are moving faster than our technology can back them up.
Fact.

&gt; &gt; like: a readily accepted 'Uncertainty Principle' that allows modern

There's nothing mystical about the numbers, it boils down to what is
required mathematically.  Using properties like rotational symmetry
and 8-dimensional algebras, one can deduce what is required.
Mysticism is specifically NOT required for this.  But that doesn't

And I think you got the wrong end of the stick.  Where did I exclude
any certainties?  One can be certain that no human will ever be able

no effect whatsoever on the fact that the future is fixed or the fact
that Quantum Mechanics requires belief that defies simple logic by

'My' foam picture is just fine.  Imagine a foam where every bubble is
a universe like ours.  This IS a valid (i.e., already scientifically
proposed) M-Theory.  And, if you remove one of the dimensions from
THAT scenario and replace it with Y-dimensional time, you can have a
foam where every bubble is parallel with one another.  Snow crystals
are static and lifeless and this universe is far from static and
lifeless.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Step back, look at the dimensionality of your counting system and add

&gt; &gt; I don't think that scientists have a 'the more the better' attitude
&gt; &gt; towards dimensions; there is a certain number that you would not need
&gt; &gt; to go beyond and, as energy is conserved, we would know to never go
&gt; &gt; beyond a certain number.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe then I would enter a discussion with you on finding a working
&gt; &gt; &gt; definition for &quot;full&quot;. Isn't that a large-hearted offer? ;-)

&gt; &gt; Even string theory 'as-it-stands' doesn't explain EVERY phenomenon
&gt; &gt; recorded by human experience, but it does offer a platform from which
&gt; &gt; many 'disbelieved' phenomena could become believable.  I'm afraid even
&gt; &gt; with my advances to the concept, I still don't have the FULL picture
&gt; &gt; myself--certainly not in explicit detail--so, even if you deign to
&gt; &gt; discuss it at length some time in the future, we may not be able to
&gt; &gt; hash-out all of life's 'presentations'.

&gt; &gt; PS  You would never need to go beyond 28 dimensions. That would
&gt; &gt; include the 11th 'brane' from M-Theory and Y-dimensional time.  With
&gt; &gt; those and the standard 26 from string theory, a 'foam' of parallel
&gt; &gt; universes could account for all possibilities.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't you think this idea of the self is overly deterministic?  What
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of human choice?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's an illusion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Is it not possible to will the self to be something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it currently is not?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No.  Try as hard as you might, you can't become a chicken.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is to say, rather than view the self
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in strict ontological terms, I tend to view the self rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pragmatically as a function of being-in-act.  In a very real sense we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are what we do and our actions in the world work with current
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; structures of self in order to form new layers as it were in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course of what we do.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The layers are already present in the whole, you just have to move
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 'into' them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, why the necessity to believe the world is virtually real?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because trying to imagine the reality (what does an 10-dimensional

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusion and, allegorically, the dream of Brahman.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it not more prudent to understand the world as it is and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consequences of our actions in the material existence rather than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; positing reality as a perceive it as that which is not &quot;really&quot; real?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nope, because the reality is a more-than-4-dimensional reality, so you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; KNOW that what you perceive is less than that reality and is,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; therefore, better referred to as illusory in that it isn't the FULL
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; picture.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Getting to know one's self involves the process of getting to know all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these things and meeting the beings behind the virtual reality world.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They of course create light worlds for us to learn in, as well as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parallel earths etc. They are beyond time and space and are absolutely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pure love and power. The earth is their school for their young (us).

&gt; &gt; &gt; Isn't that interesting?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also wanted to comment on the fact that you mentioned ten directions.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Many string theories speak of eleven including time, but time is not a
&gt; &gt; &gt; dimension...

&gt; &gt;     The 11th dimension boils down to what is called an 'M-theory' (M
&gt; &gt; for mathematical).  And the 11th is usually postulated to derive from
&gt; &gt; the reasoning that the 10 exist as a membrane wrapped around that 11th
&gt; &gt; dimension.  Even in M-theories, time is still postulated to be
&gt; &gt; functionally connected to the 3 'revealed' dimensions of our space-
&gt; &gt; time continuum.
&gt; &gt;     I hadn't realised that Buddha had reportedly noted 10
&gt; &gt; directions.  Thanks for that!!  So Buddhism links in fairly well with
&gt; &gt; string theory, then.  Excellent!!

&gt; &gt; &gt; it is only an experience.

Not fact.  You seem not to understand what a theory is.  A theory is
not proven, but is an assertion about reality made based on evidence
that predicts an event or series of events based on certain conditions
that are measurable and statistically significant.  Theories are not
proven, but are there to be disproven.  That is to say, general
relativity was a theory made based on evidence and prior theories on
the movement and nature of matter.  The theory itself disproves
significant notions about the universe in the Newtonian system.
Moreover, relativity itself has spawned other theories which have
since proven that general relativity is correct.  So a theory does not
exist apart of evidence that founds the theory itself.  No evidence +
no statistically significant predictability = no theory.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps it is only unknowable by today's technological state of
&gt; &gt; &gt; affairs.  The same could have been said of many advances in the past,
&gt; &gt; &gt; yet we strive to BETTER ourselves and learn more.  Remember, ther was
&gt; &gt; &gt; a time when we KNEW that the Sun revolved around the Earth (after all,
&gt; &gt; &gt; if you look, that's what you'll see).  I reckon that 'that which we
&gt; &gt; &gt; already know' is still just as clouded, albeit clouded by other things
&gt; &gt; &gt; like: a readily accepted 'Uncertainty Principle' that allows modern
&gt; &gt; &gt; scientists to get away with saying 'we CAN'T know for sure'.  That's a

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time from a non human source. There are other components I won't go

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is an abstract picture showing a human puppet being sent into the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the control reeds beginning at a portal at the kundalini area. You can

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dry atmosphere who is also part of the control system. This is to show
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how beings on different dimensions including a liquid dimension all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; play a part in controlling the human puppets in this virtual reality
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earth world.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't you think this idea of the self is overly deterministic?  What
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of human choice?

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's an illusion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Is it not possible to will the self to be something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it currently is not?

&gt; &gt; &gt; No.  Try as hard as you might, you can't become a chicken.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is to say, rather than view the self
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in strict ontological terms, I tend to view the self rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pragmatically as a function of being-in-act.  In a very real sense we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are what we do and our actions in the world work with current
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; structures of self in order to form new layers as it were in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course of what we do.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The layers are already present in the whole, you just have to move
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'into' them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, why the necessity to believe the world is virtually real?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Because trying to imagine the reality (what does an 10-dimensional
&gt; &gt; &gt; object of stringy energy look like?) is beyond our capacity.  What we
&gt; &gt; &gt; see, if string theory is correct, is 4 out of 10 dimension.  I believe
&gt; &gt; &gt; that Vamadevananda is a Vedantist, so to him, the 10-dimensional
&gt; &gt; &gt; object of stringy energy (the Reality) is Brahman and is unknowable
&gt; &gt; &gt; but the 4-dimensional universe that we CAN perceive is Maya, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; illusion and, allegorically, the dream of Brahman.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it not more prudent to understand the world as it is and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consequences of our actions in the material existence rather than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; positing reality as a perceive it as that which is not &quot;really&quot; real?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Nope, because the reality is a more-than-4-dimensional reality, so you
&gt; &gt; &gt; KNOW that what you perceive is less than that reality and is,
&gt; &gt; &gt; therefore, better referred to as illusory in that it isn't the FULL
&gt; &gt; &gt; picture.

&gt; &gt; But all of this seems quite unnecessary.  Why postulate that which is
&gt; &gt; fundamentally unknowable in order to understand what we know already?
&gt; &gt; To say that it is all illusory seems to abnegate the reality of human
&gt; &gt; suffering.  That is to say, try to tell a loved one of a terminally
&gt; &gt; ill patient of say, ALS that their suffering is an illusion.

&gt; Perhaps it is only unknowable by today's technological state of
&gt; affairs.  The same could have been said of many advances in the past,
&gt; yet we strive to BETTER ourselves and learn more.

But this only begs the question of how we can know ourselves better
through that which is fundementally unknowable?  This assertion does
not seem that rational.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Remember, ther was
&gt; a time when we KNEW that the Sun revolved around the Earth (after all,
&gt; if you look, that's what you'll see).  I reckon that 'that which we
&gt; already know' is still just as clouded, albeit clouded by other things
&gt; like: a readily accepted 'Uncertainty Principle' that allows modern
&gt; scientists to get away with saying 'we CAN'T know for sure'.  That's a
&gt; built-in cop-out clause that comes with Quantum Mechanics because,
&gt; essentially, it makes little sense.
">

Just because a theory presents reality in a counter-intuitive way does
not mean that the theory itself is not grounded in evidence.  The
postmodern and mystic fallacy with the uncertainty is that it is
assumed that it waves the flag of either meaninglessness in terms of
objectivity or mystery in terms of the unknowability of reality.
Uncertainty does neither.  What it really says is that if I am
examining a particle I can run a test to tell me where it is, but when
I do this I won't know what it is.  When I run a test to determine
what it is, I won't know where it is.  (This is in terms of velocity
and spin which I am not really versed in so I can't get much deeper
than the philosophical issue here).  This has to do with the nature of
observation itself.  What quantum mechanics works in is therefore
probabilities.  But if we can get a probability nailed down to say .
01% that what we determine through experiment happens by chance alone
we are working with extremely reliable data.  This is usually rigorous
enough to send someone into space or build a bridge.  Although that
may be in the .001% range or deeper still, but I am not sure.  At any
rate, quantum mechanics reveals a far more complex and relational
structure of the universe.  But it is still rational and grounded in
evidence and I can assure you that physicists are not copping out with
asserting it.  Try telling the next person sent into space that
physicists are copping out with their understanding of what actually
makes that rocket go or try telling that to all of the people who live
even 50 miles from a Nuclear plant in light of Chernobyl and Three
Mile Island.  I would pray that physics is far more than using
uncertainty as a cop out to understanding the quantum level of reality
since fission deals with precisely that.

Careful that you are not equating belief with faith.  For instance, if
I determine that a cause will produce an effect in the same precise
manner without variation .0001% of the time, it is a rational belief
founded in evidence.  This is called a theory.  If I believe that
Jesus was the Son of God who rose from the dead three days after
crucifixion, this is not based in verifiable evidence other than a few
sources from inside the tradition itself.  That it cannot be
externally verified through other sources must lead the historian to
conclude that there is not reliable historical evidence to suggest
that the resurrection was an event in history that we can determine
with any reliable probability at all.  When you assert a reality that
is of extremely low probability we call this faith since the evidence
is either extremely attenuated or non-existent.  Both a theory and
faith are forms of belief, but very different forms of belief.  One is
grounded in externally verifiable evidence and the other is asserted
when that evidence cannot be produced and a cause and effect
relationship cannot be reproduced. This is not to say that faith is
grounded in some kind of reality or real event, but it is to say that
this grounding cannot be verified in an externally verifiable way.

&gt; &gt; Your foam picture is misleading. You may find it more helpful to think
&gt; &gt; of snow crystals instead.

&gt; 'My' foam picture is just fine.  Imagine a foam where every bubble is
&gt; a universe like ours.  This IS a valid (i.e., already scientifically
&gt; proposed) M-Theory.  And, if you remove one of the dimensions from
&gt; THAT scenario and replace it with Y-dimensional time, you can have a
&gt; foam where every bubble is parallel with one another.  Snow crystals
&gt; are static and lifeless and this universe is far from static and
&gt; lifeless.
">

It is also important to understand the difference between though
experiment and theory.  Bohm's understanding of the multiverse has not
been proven yet.  Superstring theory has not been proven yet and so
forth.  There is a certain low threshold of evidence to lead these
thoughts to work out in a mathematical way, but they remain though
experiments until we have evidence that can support the development of
a theory.  Not all ideas, including mathematical ones, are properly
called theories.  So this is a thought experiment without evidence to
say that we can produce a verifiable and valid result with enough of a
line of evidence to devise a theoretical framework to explain
properties of that evidence itself.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think that scientists have a 'the more the better' attitude

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe then I would enter a discussion with you on finding a working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definition for &quot;full&quot;. Isn't that a large-hearted offer? ;-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Even string theory 'as-it-stands' doesn't explain EVERY phenomenon

&gt; &gt; &gt; many 'disbelieved' phenomena could become believable.  I'm afraid even
&gt; &gt; &gt; with my advances to the concept, I still don't have the FULL picture
&gt; &gt; &gt; myself--certainly not in explicit detail--so, even if you deign to
&gt; &gt; &gt; discuss it at length some time in the future, we may not be able to
&gt; &gt; &gt; hash-out all of life's 'presentations'.

&gt; &gt; &gt; PS  You would never need to go beyond 28 dimensions. That would
&gt; &gt; &gt; include the 11th 'brane' from M-Theory and Y-dimensional time.  With
&gt; &gt; &gt; those and the standard 26 from string theory, a 'foam' of parallel

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nope, because the reality is a more-than-4-dimensional reality, so you

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; therefore, better referred to as illusory in that it isn't the FULL
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; picture.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Getting to know one's self involves the process of getting to know all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these things and meeting the beings behind the virtual reality world.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parallel earths etc. They are beyond time and space and are absolutely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pure love and power. The earth is their school for their young (us).

&gt; &gt; &gt; illusion and, allegorically, the dream of Brahman.

&gt; &gt; There is a legend concerning Buddha.
&gt; &gt; When he was still a child, he looked into the 'ten' directions.
&gt; &gt; Isn't that interesting?
&gt; &gt; Also wanted to comment on the fact that you mentioned ten directions.
&gt; &gt; Many string theories speak of eleven including time, but time is not a
&gt; &gt; dimension...

&gt;      The 11th dimension boils down to what is called an 'M-theory' (M
&gt; for mathematical).  And the 11th is usually postulated to derive from
&gt; the reasoning that the 10 exist as a membrane wrapped around that 11th
&gt; dimension.  Even in M-theories, time is still postulated to be
&gt; functionally connected to the 3 'revealed' dimensions of our space-
&gt; time continuum.
&gt;      I hadn't realised that Buddha had reportedly noted 10
&gt; directions.  Thanks for that!!  So Buddhism links in fairly well with
&gt; string theory, then.  Excellent!!

Yet string theory is still a mathematical idea with no evidence to
support it.  Thus, it is not a theory properly speaking and one should
not confuse it with what we know is the case with the structure of the
universe.  Until we can observe a superstring, it's not something to
hold our breath over - well unless you are in the business of trying
to find one.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time from a non human source. There are other components I won't go
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is an abstract picture showing a human puppet being sent into the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earth world, while a tentacle controls the many small nodes which are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the control reeds beginning at a portal at the kundalini area. You can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; see the tentacle comes from a liquid atmosphere through a being in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dry atmosphere who is also part of the control system. This is to show
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how beings on different dimensions including a liquid dimension all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; play a part in controlling the human puppets in this virtual reality
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earth world.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't you think this idea of the self is overly deterministic?  What
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of human choice?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's an illusion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Is it not possible to will the self to be something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it currently is not?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No.  Try as hard as you might, you can't become a chicken.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is to say, rather than view the self
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in strict ontological terms, I tend to view the self rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pragmatically as a function of being-in-act.  In a very real sense we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are what we do and our actions in the world work with current
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; structures of self in order to form new layers as it were in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course of what we do.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The layers are already present in the whole, you just have to move
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 'into' them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, why the necessity to believe the world is virtually real?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because trying to imagine the reality (what does an 10-dimensional
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; object of stringy energy look like?) is beyond our capacity.  What we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; see, if string theory is correct, is 4 out of 10 dimension.  I believe

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but the 4-dimensional universe that we CAN perceive is Maya, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusion and, allegorically, the dream of Brahman.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it not more prudent to understand the world as it is and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consequences of our actions in the material existence rather than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; positing reality as a perceive it as that which is not &quot;really&quot; real?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nope, because the reality is a more-than-4-dimensional reality, so you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; KNOW that what you perceive is less than that reality and is,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; therefore, better referred to as illusory in that it isn't the FULL
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; picture.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But all of this seems quite unnecessary.  Why postulate that which is
&gt; &gt; &gt; fundamentally unknowable in order to understand what we know already?
&gt; &gt; &gt; To say that it is all illusory seems to abnegate the reality of human
&gt; &gt; &gt; suffering.  That is to say, try to tell a loved one of a terminally
&gt; &gt; &gt; ill patient of say, ALS that their suffering is an illusion.

&gt; &gt; Perhaps it is only unknowable by today's technological state of
&gt; &gt; affairs.  The same could have been said of many advances in the past,
&gt; &gt; yet we strive to BETTER ourselves and learn more.

&gt; But this only begs the question of how we can know ourselves better
&gt; through that which is fundementally unknowable?  This assertion does
&gt; not seem that rational.

&gt; &gt; Remember, ther was
&gt; &gt; a time when we KNEW that the Sun revolved around the Earth (after all,
&gt; &gt; if you look, that's what you'll see).  I reckon that 'that which we
&gt; &gt; already know' is still just as clouded, albeit clouded by other things
&gt; &gt; like: a readily accepted 'Uncertainty Principle' that allows modern
&gt; &gt; scientists to get away with saying 'we CAN'T know for sure'.  That's a
&gt; &gt; built-in cop-out clause that comes with Quantum Mechanics because,
&gt; &gt; essentially, it makes little sense.

&gt; Just because a theory presents reality in a counter-intuitive way does
&gt; not mean that the theory itself is not grounded in evidence.  The
&gt; postmodern and mystic fallacy with the uncertainty is that it is
&gt; assumed that it waves the flag of either meaninglessness in terms of
&gt; objectivity or mystery in terms of the unknowability of reality.
&gt; Uncertainty does neither.  What it really says is that if I am
&gt; examining a particle I can run a test to tell me where it is, but when
&gt; I do this I won't know what it is.  When I run a test to determine
&gt; what it is, I won't know where it is.  (This is in terms of velocity
&gt; and spin which I am not really versed in so I can't get much deeper
&gt; than the philosophical issue here).  This has to do with the nature of
&gt; observation itself.  What quantum mechanics works in is therefore
&gt; probabilities.  But if we can get a probability nailed down to say .
&gt; 01% that what we determine through experiment happens by chance alone
&gt; we are working with extremely reliable data.  This is usually rigorous
&gt; enough to send someone into space or build a bridge.  Although that
&gt; may be in the .001% range or deeper still, but I am not sure.  At any
&gt; rate, quantum mechanics reveals a far more complex and relational
&gt; structure of the universe.  But it is still rational and grounded in
&gt; evidence and I can assure you that physicists are not copping out with
&gt; asserting it.  Try telling the next person sent into space that
&gt; physicists are copping out with their understanding of what actually
&gt; makes that rocket go or try telling that to all of the people who live
&gt; even 50 miles from a Nuclear plant in light of Chernobyl and Three
&gt; Mile Island.  I would pray that physics is far more than using
&gt; uncertainty as a cop out to understanding the quantum level of reality
&gt; since fission deals with precisely that.
">

They also purport 'Probability waves'.  So what do you think the
probability is of actually observing a probability wave?  The answer
is none.  No chance. They're another creation of scientists to help
support their uncertainty.  Probabilities exist as calculable odds;
but they don't require wave structures nor do those structures
collapse into unfolding reality.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Life is a complex affair. It exists and can be known at various
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; levels, depths or sheaths -  physical, sensuous, mental, intellectual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and spiritual -  one pervading the previous. The last or inner most -
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the spiritual -  is about our own very self. It contains the mystery
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of our true or the unchanging self, which witnesses the changing forms
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of itself. Each one of us, as we know ourself at any point of time in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life, are but one form of the same true self. The forms are not us,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the self is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In life situations, it is the spiritual that qualifies the intellect,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intellect the mental, mental the sensuous, and sensuous the physical.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This constitutes one - half of the oscillation. During the other half,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the affects occur in the reverse :  from physical to spiritual. Thus
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the oscillations continue, like breathing, which in fact is qualified
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by the nature of events along the oscillation path and the intensity
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the sheath qualifying process at any point of time along it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As forms, we are ( self - ) conscious entities covered with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impressions from our past. Impressions are memories of learning or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knowledge impacted from our earlier experiences.

&gt; &gt; may be in the .001% range or deeper still, but I am not sure.  At any
&gt; &gt; rate, quantum mechanics reveals a far more complex and relational
&gt; &gt; structure of the universe.  But it is still rational and grounded in
&gt; &gt; evidence and I can assure you that physicists are not copping out with
&gt; &gt; asserting it.  Try telling the next person sent into space that
&gt; &gt; physicists are copping out with their understanding of what actually
&gt; &gt; makes that rocket go or try telling that to all of the people who live
&gt; &gt; even 50 miles from a Nuclear plant in light of Chernobyl and Three
&gt; &gt; Mile Island.  I would pray that physics is far more than using
&gt; &gt; uncertainty as a cop out to understanding the quantum level of reality
&gt; &gt; since fission deals with precisely that.

&gt; They also purport 'Probability waves'.  So what do you think the
&gt; probability is of actually observing a probability wave?  The answer
&gt; is none.  No chance. They're another creation of scientists to help
&gt; support their uncertainty.  Probabilities exist as calculable odds;
&gt; but they don't require wave structures nor do those structures
&gt; collapse into unfolding reality.
">

But it's still purported as you say because there is evidence to
suggest that it is so.  There is more reason to believe that it is
true than the postulation that we are experiencing reality as an
illusion.  This assertion is based on nothing at all.

Yes, I think that too often the &quot;illusory&quot; context is used as a
mechanism
to forego to suffering. SELF manifests in at least this instance...
but it is said
in thousands across timespace. SELF does not suffer, SELF already
knows what it is experiencing through us. We suffer, and we suffer for
a reason,
or we would be in SELF's place.

Yes, it is illusory, it is NOT as it seems, our piece is miniscule but
relevant. It
is a component of SELF.

One may see how the reincarnations are looked forward to. As we cycle
through,
in the transitions between lives, we look back on what we have
experienced
through the grace of SELF, and purely revel in the abundance. There's
where the
design for the next comes from. SELF has set the way yet again.

Can we tell a terminal patient to relax, it's not really all that big
a deal, after all
it's an illusion? NO. He will learn in his time, but not because
someone told him,
but because he learned.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time from a non human source. There are other components I won't go
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is an abstract picture showing a human puppet being sent into the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earth world, while a tentacle controls the many small nodes which are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the control reeds beginning at a portal at the kundalini area. You can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; see the tentacle comes from a liquid atmosphere through a being in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dry atmosphere who is also part of the control system. This is to show
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how beings on different dimensions including a liquid dimension all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; play a part in controlling the human puppets in this virtual reality
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earth world.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Don't you think this idea of the self is overly deterministic?  What
&gt; &gt; &gt; of human choice?

&gt; &gt; It's an illusion.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Is it not possible to will the self to be something
&gt; &gt; &gt; that it currently is not?

&gt; &gt; No.  Try as hard as you might, you can't become a chicken.

&gt; &gt; &gt; that is to say, rather than view the self
&gt; &gt; &gt; in strict ontological terms, I tend to view the self rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; pragmatically as a function of being-in-act.  In a very real sense we
&gt; &gt; &gt; are what we do and our actions in the world work with current
&gt; &gt; &gt; structures of self in order to form new layers as it were in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; course of what we do.

&gt; &gt; The layers are already present in the whole, you just have to move
&gt; &gt; 'into' them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, why the necessity to believe the world is virtually real?

&gt; &gt; Because trying to imagine the reality (what does an 10-dimensional
&gt; &gt; object of stringy energy look like?) is beyond our capacity.  What we
&gt; &gt; see, if string theory is correct, is 4 out of 10 dimension.  I believe
&gt; &gt; that Vamadevananda is a Vedantist, so to him, the 10-dimensional
&gt; &gt; object of stringy energy (the Reality) is Brahman and is unknowable
&gt; &gt; but the 4-dimensional universe that we CAN perceive is Maya, the
&gt; &gt; illusion and, allegorically, the dream of Brahman.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Is it not more prudent to understand the world as it is and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; consequences of our actions in the material existence rather than
&gt; &gt; &gt; positing reality as a perceive it as that which is not &quot;really&quot; real?

&gt; &gt; Nope, because the reality is a more-than-4-dimensional reality, so you
&gt; &gt; KNOW that what you perceive is less than that reality and is,
&gt; &gt; therefore, better referred to as illusory in that it isn't the FULL
&gt; &gt; picture.

&gt; But all of this seems quite unnecessary.  Why postulate that which is
&gt; fundamentally unknowable in order to understand what we know already?
&gt; To say that it is all illusory seems to abnegate the reality of human
&gt; suffering.  That is to say, try to tell a loved one of a terminally
&gt; ill patient of say, ALS that their suffering is an illusion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Getting to know one's self involves the process of getting to know all

Jake, sorry I did not visit the group earlier.

You do raise a few aspects and implications. I assure you there are a
million more. But that is not in my focus or interest. Instead, let me
offer some more food for your thought.

No one can know the self in the objective way. Can you see your own
eyes or face as it is, except with the help of a mirror or through
second or third person ?
Do not even for a moment think that I am launching a philosophical
problem. It is to bring to the fore with even more clarity the fact
that we are forever, at each moment, whether we know or not, nothing
but the Self. This Self is not definable, being not open to our
objective view. In fact, the Self is the seer to all that we see,
feel, think, imagine, know, dream, our being in the dream, the idea we
have of ourself ... All of these are transient, as matter of fact, one
giving way to other, and that to another. Only the seer, the Self,
which is what we truly are, is the unchanging constant.

May I suggest that we watch the nature of our being starting with the
wakeful state, when we are identified with the body and its organs of
knowledge and action, through which lens we perceive and relate with
other objects and beings and with ourself. We then go on to the dream
state when we create the reality of the whole dream world, our own
being in the dream world - eating, drinking, merry, sad, fearful,
devastated, horny ... - and our seer being, in whom the entire dream
world is situated, who continues to watch over it all. And finally, to
the deep sleep state when we are without everything and free of all
meanings, desires, relatedness, identity ...

The only requirement is to be able to see the entire revelation of our
self from being in one state to another with complete detachment,
alternately differentating and integrating, while being identified or
unified with the witness, who is the one unchanging and everlasting
and all contaning constant. On the way, we will get all the answers
about our Self, about our world and the universe, about the self in
all beings, about God and the Holy Ghost ( if I may be permitted, my
apologies to anyone offended ! ) ...

In short, we are called upon to be conscious while being deep asleep.
A tall order, I agree !

But all of the above does nothing to describe the Self ! We can only
BE that unqualified Self. IT is undescribable.

You are the Blissful Self. You only have to rediscover IT, for
yourself.

&gt; Vama, I think that what you're asking is interesting because it is an

&gt; It is fascinating that you search for one true self, but have no
&gt; interest in religion.  If you believe that religion was created by
&gt; man, this search is the path that led to religion's formation.

&gt; True self.... you state, &quot;Life is a complex affair. It exists and can
&gt; be known at various
&gt; levels....&quot;  Do you believe that a TRUE self can be known at any of
&gt; the states or only at the spiritual?  Or at a cacoon deeper than that?

&gt; You also write, &quot;As forms, we are ( self - ) conscious entities
&gt; covered with impressions from our past.&quot;  Do you believe that life
&gt; experiences cover self in layers or sheaths that must be stripped away
&gt; before self can be discovered?  That what we seek is a pure, true
&gt; self, or that self is defined by the course of our journey through
&gt; life?  It seems that belief in the former implies that some part of us
&gt; existed in some form before life.

&gt; of course to continue. you ask but questions and &quot;think&quot; thoughts only

&gt; question that can never be answred. all that stuff about oscillation
&gt; and impressions from our past and our memories are but... personal.
&gt; not relevant. right? but to think...             to think- is to
&gt; concentrate and care not for anything but your thought. to ponder you
&gt; must wander. this or that, yes that is where it is at. to not think is
&gt; to squander, such precious and unique times. all gone as quick as
&gt; todays dime. others can think and it gives them power. real power. the
&gt; greatest of all power. great thinkers keep low distractions and care
&gt; for the distractions not. great thinkers feel nothing for pleasure,
&gt; especially materialistic. the things matter none in the grand
&gt; essentials of life. material things rush our lives greatly because
&gt; they subtract our time or concentration. when rush, we make careless
&gt; mistakes and unthoughtful decisions, and really begin to lose
&gt; ourselfs, but in the process find ourselfs only through torment.
&gt; right? forget what we are and what we are, and most importantly who we
&gt; are and who we are to become. who are you? the question can only be
&gt; entertained because who we are contradicts the idea. a human is ever-
&gt; changing and developing in the mind. i surely am not who i was 8 hours
&gt; ago or two days ago. i will not be who i am now tomorrow. that will
&gt; trouble many and torment them as many times it has myself. humans are

&gt; &gt; Here is an abstract picture showing a human puppet being sent into the
&gt; &gt; earth world, while a tentacle controls the many small nodes which are
&gt; &gt; the control reeds beginning at a portal at the kundalini area. You can
&gt; &gt; see the tentacle comes from a liquid atmosphere through a being in a
&gt; &gt; dry atmosphere who is also part of the control system. This is to show
&gt; &gt; how beings on different dimensions including a liquid dimension all
&gt; &gt; play a part in controlling the human puppets in this virtual reality
&gt; &gt; earth world.

&gt; Don't you think this idea of the self is overly deterministic?  What
&gt; of human choice?  Is it not possible to will the self to be something
&gt; that it currently is not?  that is to say, rather than view the self
&gt; in strict ontological terms, I tend to view the self rather
&gt; pragmatically as a function of being-in-act.  In a very real sense we
&gt; are what we do and our actions in the world work with current
&gt; structures of self in order to form new layers as it were in the
&gt; course of what we do.

&gt; Moreover, why the necessity to believe the world is virtually real?
&gt; Is it not more prudent to understand the world as it is and the
&gt; consequences of our actions in the material existence rather than
&gt; positing reality as a perceive it as that which is not &quot;really&quot; real?

&gt; &gt; Getting to know one's self involves the process of getting to know all
&gt; &gt; these things and meeting the beings behind the virtual reality world.
&gt; &gt; They of course create light worlds for us to learn in, as well as
&gt; &gt; parallel earths etc. They are beyond time and space and are absolutely
&gt; &gt; pure love and power. The earth is their school for their young (us).

&gt; &gt; Here is the abstract picture showing how the human puppets are
&gt; &gt; controlled.

&gt; Before a positing of a metaphysical notion of self I think it is
&gt; helpful to constitute a good functional understanding of the self in
&gt; its material function.  In this manner the self is a being-in-act that
&gt; continually evolves to new stages of intelligence in new forms of
&gt; subject and object relationships.  The self is thus in a continual
&gt; state of becoming and cannot be looked at as a mere product of
&gt; entities.  For example, when we are 2 or thereabouts we view our
&gt; parents as the source of our subjectivity and the object are the peers
&gt; that we begin to acquire.  As we develop, our former object, peers,
&gt; becomes our source of subjectivity and the former subject, the
&gt; parents, becomes one object among many.  So we cannot understand the
&gt; self as a static entity, but one in continual change and flux in terms
&gt; of its subject-object relationships.  So the discussion of &quot;nature v.
&gt; nurture&quot; can be dismissed outright since the very dialectic it posits
&gt; is incorrect.

&gt; I enjoy Kierkegaard's understanding of the grounding of the self as
&gt; that which rests transparently in the power that posits it.  Here a
&gt; self is not something that finds its source only in a closed system of
&gt; material reality, but in that which is qualitatively other.  The
&gt; development of the self is thus in an endless loop with its source
&gt; namely God.  But an understanding of this relation is beyond the
&gt; bounds of rationality and so requires a qualitative leap to first
&gt; believe that it is possible and second to believe that it is true.
&gt; Along these liens, one must accept the possibility that which is
&gt; outside of the bounds of pure reason is true even if it is absurd.
&gt; This is the source of faith as a means to understand being as that
&gt; which is formed in an endless and paradoxical loop that goes out to
&gt; God and back (the relation of big infinity to little infinity).  This
&gt; actually fits well with Piaget's understanding of human intelligence
&gt; and even Nils Bohr's understanding of the universe on the quantum
&gt; scale.- Hide quoted text -

I liked your perception of how we change, even if just a little bit,  with
every new experience we have.  :-)

I think that in this way we acquire new programming and reinforce or change
existing acquired programming. Something we can consider as &quot;education&quot;,
with the word having a meaning more encompassing than usual.

If in search of a definitive, &quot;SELF&quot; there is no set stage in your
life where you are 'all that you can be' to  quote tongue in cheek the
Army's long running ad.

For to reach a permanent set &quot;SELF&quot; you would need to cease existing.
Ergo... DIE... thus preventing further change to who you are at this
moment.

&quot;SELF&quot; is defined more easily than you might believe, IF you believe
that all that you are is a composite of all that you have up till now
experienced.

Each of life's' experiences changes us on a daily basis.  They modify
us like computer programs designed to keep our computers current and
up to date. Without stimuli from the world around us we would become
stagnant and cease to exist as a functioning entity. Thus loosing
sight of the &quot;SELF&quot; we were destined to become.

Who You are is meerly concourent to your latest down load of life
experiences upon waking up today.

And with that I hope that all is grand in your world today. :))

Hi, Vamadevananda

From what you wrote, one can perceive that you have an idea, a concept you
call the Self. Yet, just from reading what you wrote, it is still difficult
for me to understand this idea you have in your mind. I guess that one
aspect of it that makes me wonder about its nature is the affirmation that
the self is unchangeble, perceived from your words:

&quot;Only the seer, the Self, which is what we truly are, is the unchanging
constant.&quot;

So, I think the word &quot;unchanging&quot; is a key word in understanding what you
mean. Would you care to explain what you mean by &quot;unchanging&quot;? What would
you consider a change, and what you do not consider to be a change?

Jake, sorry I did not visit the group earlier.

You do raise a few aspects and implications. I assure you there are a
million more. But that is not in my focus or interest. Instead, let me
offer some more food for your thought.

No one can know the self in the objective way. Can you see your own
eyes or face as it is, except with the help of a mirror or through
second or third person ?
Do not even for a moment think that I am launching a philosophical
problem. It is to bring to the fore with even more clarity the fact
that we are forever, at each moment, whether we know or not, nothing
but the Self. This Self is not definable, being not open to our
objective view. In fact, the Self is the seer to all that we see,
feel, think, imagine, know, dream, our being in the dream, the idea we
have of ourself ... All of these are transient, as matter of fact, one
giving way to other, and that to another. Only the seer, the Self,
which is what we truly are, is the unchanging constant.

May I suggest that we watch the nature of our being starting with the
wakeful state, when we are identified with the body and its organs of
knowledge and action, through which lens we perceive and relate with
other objects and beings and with ourself. We then go on to the dream
state when we create the reality of the whole dream world, our own
being in the dream world - eating, drinking, merry, sad, fearful,
devastated, horny ... - and our seer being, in whom the entire dream
world is situated, who continues to watch over it all. And finally, to
the deep sleep state when we are without everything and free of all
meanings, desires, relatedness, identity ...

The only requirement is to be able to see the entire revelation of our
self from being in one state to another with complete detachment,
alternately differentating and integrating, while being identified or
unified with the witness, who is the one unchanging and everlasting
and all contaning constant. On the way, we will get all the answers
about our Self, about our world and the universe, about the self in
all beings, about God and the Holy Ghost ( if I may be permitted, my
apologies to anyone offended ! ) ...

In short, we are called upon to be conscious while being deep asleep.
A tall order, I agree !

But all of the above does nothing to describe the Self ! We can only
BE that unqualified Self. IT is undescribable.

You are the Blissful Self. You only have to rediscover IT, for
yourself.

In the previous message, posted on July 21st

it was written:

&quot;(...) the idea is that human beings are programmed and programmable beings.
The way a person behaves is a direct result of the programs this person was
born with and the programs this person acquired during life.&quot;

And it was asked:

&quot;Where is this fixed programming stored? Where is the acquired programming
stored?&quot;

The fixed programming, the one humans are born with, is stored in the
genetic code. The acquired programming, which is assimilated by learning, is
stored in memory.

The genetic code has been studied for many decades, and is somewhat well
known by now, both in structure and mechanisms for its expression.

The way acquired programming is stored in memory, on the other hand, is
still uncertain. I think the prevalent idea nowadays is that it is stored in
neuronal networks in the brain.

In both cases the structures and mechanisms are very complex.

Anyway, the important thing to keep in mind is that humans have both fixed
and acquired programming to drive them, and both are very important, both
have strong influence in human behavior.

Let us consider some of these programming, fixed and acquired.

When a person stays some time without ingesting water while losing it by
expiration, perspiration and excretion, an unbalance is built. The person
needs to ingest water. So, a desire to drink water arises, the person
becomes thirsty. The greater the unbalance, the greater the desire. The
organism reacts forcing the individual to look for water and ingest it. A
fixed programming is operating. One usually does not need to learn to feel
thirsty.

A person is driving a car. On approaching a semaphore in a crossroad, the
light turns red. The person stops the car, waits until the light turns green
and then continues on the journey.

This act of perceiving the red light and stopping the car, after some
practice, becomes even automatic. It turns into a habit. Nonetheless, it
must be learned first. So, it is an acquired programming. The same can be
said about typing on a keyboard or playing the piano.

Mike is walking on the street. Ahead of him walks an old man. He notices
that the old man has a wallet in a back pocket and that it is gradually
slipping out of the pocket. After some time, the wallet drops to the ground
and the old man don't even notice it. Mike grabs the wallet and see that it
has a lot of money in it. The times are such that Mike is very short of
money. So, keeping the wallet's content would make things easier for him.
But Mike won't allow himself to act in such a dishonest way. He calls the
old man and gives the wallet back. And he feels well about it.

Mike believes that finding money on the street, knowing to whom the money
belongs, and keeping it all the same is like stealing. Mike believes, also,
that stealing is wrong, dishonorable, unacceptable. These beliefs act as the
main drive in making him give back the wallet to the old man. They were
acquired by learning. They are part of Mike's acquired programming.

Can you imagine other examples of fixed and acquired programming and the way
they affect your life?

Considering the human behavior, which factors would you say are important in
influencing it?
