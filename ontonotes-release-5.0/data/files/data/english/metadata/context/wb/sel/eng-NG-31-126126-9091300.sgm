In this thread http://www.marvel.com/news/comics.1501.Baltimore_Retailer_Summit_2007...
It states that everything for years has been a illusion. This is
really going to hurt alot of our favorite characters.

In the story it states that this has been building up in issues for
years. i don't like the sound of this honestly.

I read in a interview on Wizard.com about Elektra being a Skrull one
person thought it would be a good idea that she was always a skrull
since her resurrection. But others stated it had to have been later
on, that they nabbed her and replaced her. My question is do the
Skrulls kill those whom they take over or is there a chance the real
Elektra is still alive?

At a guess I'd say they'd be kept alive.  Since many of those being
imitated would have powers or abilities that are hard to fake, they
probably have some sort of siphon device to suck the abilities out of
the original and direct it to the duplicate for use.

The problem I have with the concept in general is that Skrulls come
from an alien culture.  Behaving like a human would be difficult to do
for a large number of Skrulls.

Well, the one thing we've always seen is that Skrulls (and every other
alien race) act very human. Considering the chaotic nature of most
humans, acting Skrully would certainly fall under most people's radar,
even for years and even by close friends. Lastly, Skrulls by their
nature are (or at least should be) master actors.

It's also possible that some of the Secret Invasion aren't Skrull
duplicates (as in not posing as existing humans), but just posing as
entirely made-up people. Skrulls can shapeshift into nearly anything,
even inanimate objects. They could easily sneak into the very low
security Vital Records Offices around the world and slip forged birth
certificates, etc. into the files, creating their human identities
from scratch.

That said, Skrullverine certainly did have trouble acting his part,
and many people noted his bizarre actions even if they didn't suspect
a Skrull.

But yes, in the past, Skrulls have kept people alive while duplicating
them. For example, Alicia Masters was kidnapped and brought across the
universe to another planet when she was duplicated by Lyja.

Could *all* Skrulls do so?  No.
But when your entire power is chameleon in nature, you really should
be able to blend in with your enviroment in multiple ways.

I was just thinking about that Lyja storyline when reading this
thread.. also, over at DC in the LSH, a Durlan replaced shrinking
violet and got involved with Colossal Boy, like Lyja married Johnny
Storm. In both cases, the relationship continued even after the
deception was discovered. Anyone remember which storyline (Skrull or
Durlan) came first? I seem to recall they were months apart if not
roughly at the same time.. (too bad the internet wasnt that big those
days, i can imagine screams of Copycat!!! being hurled in the
newsgroups.. :-)

Going back to the whole Johnny-married-Alicia-who-was-really-a-skrull
storyline... is that still in continuity? Havent been reading much FF
lately..  Johnny still looks and act like he's barely out of his
teens, Franklin (last time i checked) is still a kid, so how many
years ago did Johnny supposed to have married his Best Friend's girl?
(Awkward!) and where is Lyja these days? (yeah, yeah, I guiess i can
wiki it.. later). It would seem that she would be an obvious character
to pop up in this &quot;fresh and new&quot; storyline....

Although he distracted almost everyone (including the readers)
by suggesting Professor X was the one acting odd.

The various EVENTS that have occured since the Skrulls started
would probably serve as a good distraction for the entire MU.
(And if they'd been engineered by the Skrulls for precisely
this purpose, then that would explain everything.)

The Lyja storyline in FF didn't occur until Fantastic Four V1 #356,
which was mid 90s.  The LSH story you're speaking of was in the 80s.

I guess this could be a way out of the terrible Civil War mess but the
changes they can make by erasing stuff are quite huge because they can make
anyone be a Skrull now and eradicate entire (earlier) story lines if they
want.  I can't wait! :O)

Not true - Americans can correct me if I'm wrong, but AFAIK a series can
have two seasons - seasons are based on TV scheduling rather than production
runs.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you saying Bobby was a Skrull?

You're both right.  In America, a season is a planned production run.
which is how I've heard the word 'series' used outside the U.S.
American TV &quot;seasons&quot; are traditionally also based on TV scheduling
(i.e. the autumn network kickoff once per year), but in recent years
that system has been altered with the advent of cable and &quot;fill-in&quot;
shows which can begin in the summer or winter.

Americans would never use the word &quot;series&quot;, however, to refer to
anything less than the full beginning-to-end run of a television show,
however, which can encompass multiple &quot;seasons&quot; (or non-U.S.
&quot;series'&quot;).

That is how I have always uses TV series vs season.  Series is the
entire run of the TV show, while season is the &quot;yearly&quot; set of
episodes (which is usually Sept to May).  For example: M*A*S*H was one
series with 11 seasons.

I still get thrown off by british fans calling the current set of Dr
Who espisodes series 3 instead of season 3 (or season 29 if you
continued the previous numbering).  I can see the original Dr Who (26
seasons) and the new Dr Who (3 seasons so far) being two different
series, one of which that continues from the previous (call it a
sequal).  But I can not see calling each yearly set of episodes its
own TV series in the way I grew up with the term.

Simple........a set of....lets say.....10 episodes would be a series, as in
a series of episodes. Ahh what do I know.......it's just what we've grown up
with......I'm sure there's a real explanation as to why we say series and
the yanks say season unless...........what I wrote at the start was the
proper explanation and that would make me a genius...or maybe not!!!!

&gt; In this thread http://www.marvel.com/news/comics.1501.Baltimore_Retailer_Summit_2007 ...
&gt; It states that everything for years has been a illusion. This is
&gt; really going to hurt alot of our favorite characters.

&gt; In the story it states that this has been building up in issues for
&gt; years. i don't like the sound of this honestly.

&gt; I read in a interview on Wizard.com about Elektra being a Skrull one
&gt; person thought it would be a good idea that she was always a skrull
&gt; since her resurrection. But others stated it had to have been later
&gt; on, that they nabbed her and replaced her. My question is do the
&gt; Skrulls kill those whom they take over or is there a chance the real
&gt; Elektra is still alive?

Doesn't this remind anyone of the &quot;Who Is Secretly A Manhunter?&quot; theme
that ran through DC's Millennium event? The god Pan turned out to be a
Manhunter replacement! (Way to pay attention, Zeus!)

The miniseries was terrible, it messed with continuity in a
particularly ugly way, and I don't think any of the So-and-so Was A
Manhunter reveals are still in continuity.

Go for it, Marvel.

But it did tie in with mythology - the Death of Pan symbolised the end

Perhaps, but the replacement of Pan by a robot, with all humans and
gods unaware of the switch, does not.
