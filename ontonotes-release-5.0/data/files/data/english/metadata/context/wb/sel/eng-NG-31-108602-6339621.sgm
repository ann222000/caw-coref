Okay, I was flabbergasted to learn that all the rules of capitalization
are NOT what I thought they were.

I write: The patient was taken back to the intensive care unit in
guarded condition.

All the normals on my new account have Intensive Care Unit.

I was reading on MTDesk and, from what I could decipher, things like
St. Vincent Infirmary intensive care unit is correct, whereas I always
learned NOT to cap _unless_ the facility's particular name was in front
of it.

I do have a BOS. It is NOT with me and I don't trust those people
anyway. I want to know what _real_MT's_ do.

I have the BOS, 2nd edition in front of me, and this is what it says about
building, structure, and room names on page 44:

Capitalize all elements of a building address, including the room name.

Sister Mary Helene

St. Agnes Hospital Emergency Room

Ourtown, USA

Then on page 57, under Capitalization, it says:

In particular, avoid the use of unnecessary or inappropriate capitals. Do
not, for

example, capitalize a common-noun reference to a thing or person if it is
just one

of many other such things or persons. Thus, emergency room and recovery room

are not capitalized. Think of the rule for generic versus brand names for
drugs.

The generic term (common noun) emergency room is applied to all emergency

rooms, so it is not capitalized.

Well, I hate to break it to you, but what you've always been doing is
what the BOS advocates, page 47 of the second edition.
"departments
Lowercase common nouns designating department names;reserve capitals
for proper nouns or adjectives, in addresses, or when part of a federal
government agency name.
(examples)
She is head of the St. Mary's Hospital surgery department.
He works for the State Department in Washington, DC.
The patient is head of the English department at the local university.

However, capitalize a department name that is referred to as an entity
(doesn't have the word "department" or "unit" or whatever after it).

The patient was referred to Anesthesia for preoperative evaluation.
The report from Pathology indicates that the tumor is benign."

How embawwassing. I have been doing part of that wrong all these
years. I thought if they said the name of the facility, the department
got capped. Arrgh. Thank you.

Well, crud.  What about, "General anesthesia was induced by the
anesthesia service"?  The normals in my accounts all cap "anesthesia
service", but it looks funny to me.

As you know, I am a bit "old fashioned" about English.  What do I do?  I
follow basic English rules I learned in business school.  I would capitalize
a department if the proper name were before it, Homestead Hospital Emergency
Room, but without Homestead Hospital I would not--he was taken to the
emergency room.  I would do the same with departments.--however in the
example you gave I would have capitalized St. Vincent Infirmary Intensive
Care Unit, because I consider it all part of the title following St.
Vincent.  Just what I would do, not sure if it is right or not--it was right
when I was in business school.  I generally try to follow BOS, but did not
invest in the 2nd edition, when I am doing notes.  However, I do a lot of
letters to referring doctors, and in the letters I follow what I consider
proper business letter rules, which can differ from BOS.  I bought my BOS
just before I found out there was to be a new one, and I was not that
impressed with what I had, and wasn't willing to spend on the new one.  I
have picked up some of the changes from SMT, though, and made notes.

Wait a minute. Isn't this conflicting:

St. Agnes Hospital Emergency Room (Easyrider's post)

St. Mary's Hospital surgery department. (Gisele's post)

Why is one capitalized, and the other one not?

It is conflicting. The right way is now (or maybe always has been!) to
NOT cap the whole thing if the facility name is there. I always did.

That's how I do it too.  I don't remember who told me this, but it was
suggested to me to insert Dr. Smith in place of the department name and
if it jibes grammatically, it gets capped.

The patient was referred to (Dr. Smith) for preoperative evaluation.

I was taught not to capitalize generic department names either (generic
versus brand name - lol). BUT, within the corporate world, the
organization can dictate whether or not they want these things capped
for emphasis on importance I believe is what the reason was, so maybe
the actual account wants it that way?

In Easyrider's example, p. 44, the BOS says, "Capitalize all elements
of a building address, including room name."  The surgery department is
not a room name that would presumably part of the building address.

Well, if you were addressing a letter/envelope to

St. Mary's Hospital Surgery Dept

you'd certainly cap it, wouldn't you?
