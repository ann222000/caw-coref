Good Tiding about Sayyidina Mahdi 'alayhissalam in the Last 10 Days of
Ramadan 1428H

A suhbat by Mawlana Shaykh Muhammad Hisham Qabbani
Wednesday, October 3rd 2007, after Fajr
Fenton, Michigan

A'uudzu billahi minasy syaithanirrajiim
Bismillahirrahmanirrahiim
Nawaytul Arba'in, nawaytul i'tikaf, nawaytul khalwah, nawaytul 'uzlah,
nawaytur riyadah, nawaytus suluuk lillaahi ta'aala l-'aazhim fii
hadzal masjid

[Based on Note, not an exact transcription; my apology for any
mistakes]

We are now at the last 10 days of Ramadan. We spoke in the 1st 10 days
of this Ramadan, about Sayyidina Mahdi 'alayhissalam, and also in the
2nd 10 days.

In this last 10 days, there are preparations now for Sayyidina Mahdi
'alayhissalam to receive the secrets of the Holy Quran. He is the key
of every secrets, of every oceans, of every Holy Books. He is
inheriting this from the Prophet, Sayyidina Muhammad sallallahu
'alayhi wa aalihi wasahbihi wasallam.

As soon as his prayer is excepted, every people who is in his
presence, especially those who wait for a peaceful live in his time,
and in the time of Sayyidina 'Isa 'alayhissalam; they will receive one
beam [of that secrets] that will function as a vehicle for his/her
ascension to the presence of Prophet sallAllahu 'alayhi wasallam.

Amrul Islam (The Matter of Islam religion) has been coming to people
at its lowest level of understanding. Even Muslims now are only busy
with their daily life, forgetting and not looking into religious life.
As it has been going to its lowest point, now it will be going up so
quickly, not waiting in days, weeks, months or years. It is a part of
preparationsin the heart of people to receive knowledge, for those who
will be living in the time of Sayyidina Mahdi and Sayyidina 'Isa
'alayhimassalaam.

Sayyidina Mahdi alayhissalam has 7 Ministers:
a.. Syahaamatul Fardaani
b.. Yuusuf as-Shiddiiq
c.. 'Abdur-Rauf al-Yamaaniy
d.. Imaamu 'l-'Aarifiin Amaanu 'l-Haqq
e.. Lisaanu l'-Mutakallimiin 'Awnullaah as-Sakhaawii
f.. 'Aarifu 't-Thayyaar al-Ma'ruf bi Mulhaan
g.. Burhaanu l-Kuramaa' Sulthanul Awliya' Ghawth il-Anaam

These 7 Ministers are being given now, the authority to look at the
heart of every person who is going to be in the time of Mahdi
'alayhissalam. It is not their job to look at those who are going to
pass away, there are other ones responsible for that task. These 7
Ministers, they look to those who are going to stay [alive in the time
of Mahdi and/or 'Isa], to download (to their hearts) all these
informations &amp; knowledges of ma'rifatullah to the heart of people.
They will prepare it as much as possible so that they can accept the
Secrets of the Holy Quran [1], that are going to be revealed to the
Prophet Muhammad sallAllahu 'alayhi wasallam, then from him to
Sayyidina Mahdi 'alayhissalam, then from him to his 7 Ministers, then
from these Ministers to Awliya'ullah, then from Awliya'ullah to their
students.

These informations will be given according to the size of the
container of the heart. It's like runways in airports, for every
direction there is a runway. These 7 Ministers will be preparing the
Students' runways, for every directionn, there is a vehicle landing
and carrying knowledge for each person. Everyone will have different
knowledge, that each of this person will reflect to their surrounding
people, to the people they are meeting, or talking. And this knowledge
will be reflected even without talking.

These preparations for the receiving of Secrets of the Holy Quran will
prepare them for their Ma'arij, their ascension to their stations. It
is in this month, in the association of Awliya'ullah (Diwanu
l'Awliya'), in the presence of Prophet sallAllahu 'alayhi wasallam,
Sayyidina Mahdi is authorised to start this procedure.

Sayyidina Mahdi has 40 khalifah, and 59 deputies, in total 99 Names,
as manifestation of the 99 Beautiful Names

These 99 Names, deputies and khalifah, their names are extracted by
Grand-GrandShaykh Sharafuddin Daghestani [2], from Quran Surah Al-
An'aam. He pulled their names from that suurah for 3 months. It was
very heavy that he had a heart problem. After that, he gave the list
of these names to his successor, Grandshaykh 'Abdullah Faiz ad-
Daghestani, and then he gave to Mawlana Shaykh Nazim 'Adil Al-Haqqani.

[Note interrupted]

Mawlana Shaykh Nazim speaks in front of these Khalifahs and Deputies
about the secret of the Holy Quran. Mawlana Shaykh Nazim speaks about
the importance of cleansing egos and importance of ittiba' (to
follow).

In this meeting, all spiritual people, they appeared and sat in this
association, in order to be completed and ready to mingle with people
to prepare for the time of Mahdi alayhissalam.

This Ramadan, Mahdi 'alayhissalam, has been informed about his
appearance in this world, and about what is going to happen in the
short near future, to bring justice and peace to the whole world
without fighting. Allah SWT has prepared him with special hidden power
that is so huge, an energy that is beyond any energy forms that we
understand. This energy is coming not from worldly energy, but
Heavenly energy, from Jibril 'alayhissalam. And we already explained
it in detail before.

That energy is put under his tasarruf (control), so that every hand
measures on earth is to be under his control and command, physically.
He authorised Mawlana Shaykh Nazim to work on the heart of people.

As a result, there is a huge celebration and happiness in Heaven, that
all the suffering and bloodshed are going to vanish, while justice and
peace will appear. There is a parade of Happiness, this is opened to
Sayyidina Muhammad sallAllahu 'alayhi wasallam, and then opened from
him to Sayyidina Mahdi 'alayhissalam, and then to Awliya'ullah. They
went on this parade that people feel better. Because its happiness is
reflected on earth.

A lot of change will happen. Some old countries will be gone, and new
countries will come with peaceful people.

Allah revealed to Sayyidina Mahdi alayhissalam what he will be having
in his 7 years spending time on Earth, with 7 Ministers. Every year
from his 7 years rule, one of his ministers will pass away. Sayyidina
Mahdi already knows what is going to happen there, what will happen.

This is in short what has happened. There is a huge celebrations in
Heaven, angels are reciting tasabih:
a.. Subhana Dzil 'Izzati wal Jabaruut
b.. Subhana Dzil Qudrati wal Malakuut
c.. Subbuuhun Quddusun Rabbuna wa Rabbul Malaaikati war Ruuh
These tasabih are recited in Heavenly melodious music. In 7 Heavens
they are celebrating. Heavenly Chair is decorated, and the Throne has
been opened for Sayyidina Mahdi alayhissalam. If that Heavenly Music
were to be heard by people, they would be flying without wings from
Earth to Heavens; and all of these electromagnetic waves are coming
from the reflection of the Angels' tasabih. What scientists have
discovered of vibrations and waves, are coming from the tasabih of
angels. When Mahdi 'alayhissalam appear, all these Heavenly Music will
be heard by all these people who are going to be there; and people
will seee themselves sitting on horses that can fly and take them
anywhere; to bring happiness on earth.

This is the opening for the last 10 days of Ramadan.

Bihurmatil Habib Bihurmatil Faatihah!
