Just purchased this piece (see pix link below). I know nothing about
it but I figure someone out there may have seen one before. The only
marking is: &quot;Trademark B.O.T.&quot;. I'm considering restoring it, but
won't if it'll take away from its value (although it is kinda
unsightly as it is now). If anyone could venture a guess of it's
origin, age? Also, any insight into value, and whether I should strip
it down to bare wood? Thanks Kevin

It does not appear to be in that bad of shape.
First thing I would do is clean all the grime off of it. Dry clean first
wish a brush, then use a damp ( a little murphys soap thrown in), not
dripping wet cloth and wipe down. Examine the desk, does bare, unstained
wood show in a lot of places? If so you may want to take it strip it down to
bare wood. If only the surface coat of shellac is worn off you can remove
the shellac by wiping down with ammonia (do not breath the fumes) and
hopefully the stain is in pretty good shape. If the stain is worn you may be
able to blend in a new stain to match the old. Once you get it all nice and
clean and looking good, give a couple of coats of a satin poly. You do not
want it to shiny. Not sure who b.o.t is.

There are plenty of resources out there on finishing. Or a copy of
Flexner is a good start. But restore it with something that's vaguely
in keeping with the original period of it, not slapping a coat of
polyurinestain on top !

This style of piece often looks good in milk paint, dark green or
blue, then a coat of oil over the top and an occasional waxing. If
you're into distressing (which I'm not) then let the milk paint dry a
couple of days, and buff the exposed corners and edges with a piece of
old canvas or denim before oiling it.

Not original, but you're probably going for a more folksy look. In its
day this was probably a spirit varnish (looking at the state of the
alligator-hide) and then a few coffee-rings if it was lucky.

I'd take the old finish off with a glass scraper. Break an old
greenhouse window, and pick out bits with a slightly curved edge. Use
them like a cabinet scraper (google in rec.woodworking) and throw them
away as they wear down.

Inside the pigeon holes, a light shellac ( www.shellac.net  tells you
more than you want) applied with a good synthetic artist's flat
watercolour brush, is an easy seal for the wood and doesn't look too
contrived.

If you would read the faq on your shellac.net you would see that ammonia
will remove shellac. I know I have done this numerous times, being able to
preserve the stained or fumed wood underneath. Alligator hide, how did you
come up with that one? The shellac has crossed linked with time, causing it
to bubble and flake off. Shellac is a beautiful finish, but does darken and
deteriate with time. You do not see to many 100 year old pieces of furniture
that have a shellac finish, that are original in there color. A good clear
poly should not darken with time, and should last a few centuries. Shellac
can also be easily damaged by cleaning agents and plain water (turns white).

"/> Where ?!

First of all, ammonia is unpleasant to work with.

Secondly, ammonia is a lousy solvent for shellac.

Thirdly, ammonia is a _useless_ solvent for shellac that has been in
situ for long enough to be this damaged.

To be honest, a finish that has suffered age damage to this extent
just isn't going to shift with any solvent (maybe trike).

Hi Kevin,

As you have so rightly titled your post, plantation desk, this is indeed
a type of desk that was used far and wide by business offices, shops,
town governments and the like. This is a later version of what we refer
to in New England as a schoolmasters desk. I am not a refinishing expert
but I can tell you that whatever the top coat was( varnish or shellac )
was exposed to a variety of temperature ( heat ) and humidity conditions
which made the surface react and form an alligated surface ( much like
the skin of an alligator. If much of the original color is still intact
I would not attempt to restore this yourself unless you have experience
in such matters. That is if it is your intention to restore rather than
refinish. Value is subjective as some people will pay a premium price
for objects in their original state while others will pay a premium
price for the piece if looks all shiny and new. Having a trademark and
no dovetailing ( not that I could see in the pictures ) I would date the
piece circa 1870 -1890. Give or take 10 years or so.

No crap today my friend. This piece is in it's original state. Bought
and sold many pieces like this one. Alas you forget we are still a young
country. 133 years old is antique to us, while still being used

&gt; Probably because of the stupid, silly ridiculous prices you Yanks end up
&gt; asking for the crap.

&gt; Somehow I doubt, Gerald, even in your great State of Texas there would be
&gt; enough warehouses to hold all the shit which was shipped to the States (US)
&gt; during the 80s, never mind the 60s, 70s and 90s.

"/> A bunch of those container loads passed through a local auction house
here in the 70's and early 80's. I wonder what became of it all. I don't
see it in homes, but I may just not be hanging around with the wrong
people.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I didn't even know there was a Buffalo in Texas?

"/> Oh, there's pretty much everything here. I just pulled a city name out
the hat, but there is a Buffalo, Texas. Small place, east of Waco in
Leon County.

There are also Elysian Fields, Utopia and Paradise; Raisin, Oatmeal,
Rice and Noodle; Grice, Latexo, Lazbuddie, Wamba, and Fluvanna; Gun
Sight, Gun Barrel City, Point Blank and Cut and Shoot; Dime Box and Old
Dime Box; Little Hope and Uncertain; Sunrise, Sunset, and Tesnus
(Sunset, spelled backwards); Chocolate Bayou, Ding Dong, and Lolipop;
Paris and Nazareth.

Many of the odd names came about when the towns settled up and applied
for a post office. Some of them went through several proposed names
before the Post Office accepted one as being sufficiently different to
avoid confusion with a similarly named existing post office. Sunset is
one that got its name when, after a long day of arguing over what to
call the new town, one man stood up and suggested that, as it was nearly
dark, they call it Sunset.

The residents of Tesnus wanter to call it Sunset, but there was already
a Sunset. But they were set on Sunset and settled for the reverse
spelling. (Why they were so determined, I don't know. The railroad
called the stop there Lucy, and they were hapy with that, but the Post
Office thought it too common a name.)

Cut and Shoot got its name after the issue of the design of the new
church or who could preach there was settled after a lively debate
featuring guns and knives. Dime Box's name came from the local mail drop
where residents left their mail and a ten-cent piece for postage. (Old
Dime Box is the original town that was bypassed by the railroad.)
Uncertain started as Uncertain Landing, where docking a steamboat was an
iffy proposition. No one seems to know how Ding Dong got its name.

&gt;Ammonia is indeed *part* of the answer to damaged shellac. The secret

like old varnish when it dries out.

&gt;and then equalises the surface.

"/> I've never believed in this &quot;equalise the surface&quot; business. If
shellac is old and knackered enough to need it, it's too old to
survive it. If it was shellac though, why not just strip it and
re-apply fresh ? It comes off easily enough and new re-applies over
old with no trouble.

Most of all, this approach is _predictable_ - you know before you
start you how long it's going to take you. Fooling with trying to
kick old materials back into life is just too open-ended. You start
off with the best intentions, then realise you've put days into
something that just wasn't worth it.

Besides which, this piece isn't shellac. Just look at the height of
that alligatoring
http://community.webshots.com/photo/67687112/67687623aoOvGN

When shellac fails, it fails by going brittle and losing adhesion with
the substrate. Spirit varnishes though go soft and increase their
surface tension. They contract and pull together, into these
alligatored peaks.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Mind you, the piece has to be worth the effort, and frankly this desk
&gt;isn't. It just needs stripping, colour balancing, grain sealing and
&gt;then Briwaxing.

"/> I'd agree with that. Personally I'd skip the wax and use it as an
excuse to fool with recreating yet another 18th century varnish
recipe, but that's just for interest, not for production.

You've dealt in furniture long enough to know what something in original
condition is worth versus
something that has been reworked. Granted this piece is on the very low
end of the scale at this
point. But what about in another 100 or 200 years. Not everyone likes or
appreciates &quot;grunge&quot;
furniture. But I'd rather turn a quick profit and leave it alone. Just
to illustrate the point. Three years
ago I sold an ugly sack back American Windsor arm chair in grungy old
green paint with many worn
areas. $14,000.00 American plus 15% buyers premium. Similar chairs
refinished selling at the time
for $500 - $1,000. So you guys keep stripping all that old painted
furniture and I'll sit here watching
my investments increase in value ;-)

Oh, I don't examine patination with my arse. I sit on it and watch my

Back to the point of this stupid thread which is an ugly shop keepers desk.
I'd buy and sell it quick for a $20 profit as it does not have any points of
superior craftsmanship that would make it worth any serious money in the
near future. I like things in original servicable condition that haven't
been mucked up by some self proclaimed finish expert. That's my opinion and
taste which I am entitled to as you are yours. I don't see a right or wrong

"/> I have two concerns with the turps/ammonia mix.

- I don't think this works. It works for damage repair on shellac
that's reasonably recent, but old shellac just isn't that amenable to
being re-dissolved. Anything that's got to the point of crazing isn't
worth the risk.

- It's going to look dreadful, compared to french polish. Maybe it's
acceptable for something like shellac over oil, where it's a less
high-gloss polish in the first place.

The point about french polish is its depth and transparency. Now
mixtures of alcohol / shellac / resins are traditional enough early
varnishes, but they've nothing like the same clarity as french polish.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;You ask why not strip and re-apply fresh..........well, true French

&gt;shellac or French polishing in the first place,

"/> Sure, but this has turned into a discussion of ammonia and turps as a
means of re-working french polish. If something is french polished,
then it's more likely to be worth a little more effort than this desk.

Now I'd still incline towards stripping and re-applying for french
polish. Not if it's mechanical damage, but if the shellac itself is
starting to age. Light-damaged shellac in just one small spot ? Now
that's a harder question.

Thinking about the chemistry of the ammonia and turps mixture, I'm
wondering if it isn't a variant of &quot;spit and polish&quot;. The ammonia acts
as a co-solvent between turpentine and water, and with the evaporation
of the ammonia when the stuff is rubbed on, the water and turpentine
separate. The water repellent properties of the shellac then give it a
mirror surface, for little work (compared to the usual oil and
spiriting off).

As to this box, then I'd still go with milk paint. Quick and easy to
do, and it plays up that &quot;folksy&quot; thing. If anyone is going to buy
it, chances are that's just up their street.
(Now who knows the best way to take painted Grandma Moses flowers off
a Disston ? 8-) )

caskets (you wouldn't believe the margins on funeral stuff). I've

but they can't afford it. It's maybe £4K to buy, or at least £8K to
build it to the quality they want. I don't know if my veneering work
is up to something on that scale, and the timber alone priced up at
£2K5 to do it from solid Cuban mahogany. I've already got some
CITES-kosher stuff here, waiting to be made into tea caddies, but a
large case piece is more than I want to bite off at present.

Sometimes I do restoration work, but I don't deal in antiques. I've
got a huge amont to learn, and I'm the first to admit it. I know next
to nothing about recognising styles or individual makers at a glance.
And as for anything European and not wooden, I wouldn't have a clue.

If I buy anything for myself, it's likely to be Asian, small or sharp.
Woodblocks, netsuke, the odd tea bowl, and swords. Many swords. Now
some of those do come in as cheap eBay scroungings, find themselves
polished and re-mounted, then get sold on to fund the next project.

&gt;Andy, what style of tea caddie do you produce out of solid Cuban mahogany?

"/> No idea yet. I wanted to work the wood, while I had the chance, and
these seemed like an interesting enough piece with about the right

I can't veneer worth a damn either, so I'd like to do a few more in
something plain (African mahogany ?) and veneer them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And how much would you charge for such a tea caddies?

"/> Probably nothing. I imagine I'll keep one, and the others will be
either gifts or barter. I know the abundance of originals and their
relatively low price. I bought one recently with a Bramah lock on it,
for less than the current retail of a new Bramah. Finish is looking
a bit tired on it though - grubby and lots of minor scratching. Maybe
I'll give it a dose of the ammonia and turpentine 8-)

If I was making for sale, I'd do another run of cremation caskets
(local walnut, but not spectacular figure, cenotaph shape a la Lutyens
and a hand-carved scroll in each corner). They fetch a better price
than caddies and there's less work in them. My carving could use
practice too.

&gt;I'm rather sceptical of this whole idea of modern reproducing. I'm inclined to
&gt;think if a man (or woman) has genuine talent and skill why then fart about and

"/> Absolutely.

That's why I'm interested in 1900 Americana. Good market for it, good
prices, and the stuff is dead easy to batch produce for an affordable
capital outlay on a workshop. There's also a lot of it that's a
recognisable house style, but there's still scope for innovation for
the design of individual pieces. Stickley never made a computer desk
or a record rack.

A lot of Gustav Stickley is also plug-ugly. After Harvey Ellis died,
Gustav himself couldn't draw worth a damn. Strangely it's the rare
stuff (that never sold because it's nasty) that now fetches the big
money, because of its rarity.

Shaker stuff is a good money spinner too. Nice honest work that's a
lot of benchwork that clients can see (and pay for) rather than
internal fiddling they don't appreciate. Stick some decent timber in
there and most people just don't believe how good simple wood can
look, having never seen anything better than Antique Pine with the
smell of toluene still on it. Find a good client that wants a fitted
bedroom and you can build something with the storage volume of MFI and
the looks of Mt Lebanon, for the price of one half-decent chest from a
dealer.
