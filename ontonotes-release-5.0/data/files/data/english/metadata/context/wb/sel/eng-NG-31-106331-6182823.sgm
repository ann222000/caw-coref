Craig expressed disappointment that I -- an unapologetic romantic
Nietzschean atheist -- would align myself with someone like Professor
Richard Dawkins. Dawkins, he says, is closed-minded; even "religiously
zealous" in his views. He finds Dawkins' views "sick".

This is the new, or neo, Atheism of the twenty-first century; and it just
might warrant that capital letter considering the conviction with which
people follow it.

Superstition, supernaturalism, and mysticism are being attacked by people
now better equipped than they've ever been to mount an intellectual
challenge to them. I believe this is a natural reaction against the rise in
religious extremism we've seen since 9/11. Fundamentalist Islam has fueled
the growth in fundamentalist Christianity, whilst many non-believing
moderates have been attracted to the scientific rationalism of this new kind
of Atheism. Religion, many people believe, is just too dangerous not to
require a corresponding and rational opposite to bring balance.

The main proponents of this movement are people like Professor Richard
Dawkins, Professor Daniel Dennett, Professor Stephen Pinker, and the author
Sam Harris. These people are all very strongly opposed religion and the
problems they believe it causes, even in its more moderate guises. They
attack it as a delusion, a virus of the brain, a mimetic plague. They're on
the offensive too: taking religion on with that most dangerous of weapons...
conversation.

So, yes, I do align myself with Richard Dawkins on many things. On the
science side, his book 'The Selfish Gene' explained evolutionary biology to
me like nothing had before. It's just brilliant. More than that, I think his
social commentary on things like "faith" schools in Britain is very timely.

Ian,
Here is the problem I have with people like this.  I'm not arguing
that religion is perfect, far from it.  You could even call it a
crutch if you wish.  But people have crutches because they have an
injury.  If they didn't need a crutch to walk then they wouldn't use
one.  People like Richard Dawkins and Danielle Dennet wish to kick
everyone's crutches out from underneath them and then expect to see
them miraculously walk.

I've read studies done in communist countries where they have banned
religion.  The social consequences were a disaster.  One of my good
friends is from Bosnia.  Hearing some of his stories about communist
Bosnia are just horrible.  Instead of worshipping an abstract God they
worshiped their leader and their country.  Like Plato says, no man has
lived who has not believed in God.

If you do away with the Gods of religion, then people going to worship
something else.  At the moment the big religion in America is
science.  Nietszche saw that this would be so, and feared the day when
we finally question the foundations of science, like we've questioned
the fondations of religion (hence God is dead).  Science is one of the
easiest things to question the foundations of, and we will
eventually.  Then there will be no meaning left.  We will stare into
the abyss and the abyss will stare back into us.

Separating young children based on the religious differences of their parents.

Good or bad? Sectarian or helpful to the promotion of a multicultural Britain?

&gt; &gt; of Atheism. Religion, many people believe, is just too dangerous not to
&gt; &gt; require a corresponding and rational opposite to bring balance.

&gt; &gt; The main proponents of this movement are people like Professor Richard
&gt; &gt; Dawkins, Professor Daniel Dennett, Professor Stephen Pinker, and the
author
&gt; &gt; Sam Harris. These people are all very strongly opposed religion and the
&gt; &gt; problems they believe it causes, even in its more moderate guises. They
&gt; &gt; attack it as a delusion, a virus of the brain, a mimetic plague. They're
on
&gt; &gt; the offensive too: taking religion on with that most dangerous of
weapons...
&gt; &gt; conversation.

&gt; &gt; So, yes, I do align myself with Richard Dawkins on many things. On the
&gt; &gt; science side, his book 'The Selfish Gene' explained evolutionary biology
to
&gt; &gt; me like nothing had before. It's just brilliant. More than that, I think
his
&gt; &gt; social commentary on things like &quot;faith&quot; schools in Britain is very
timely.

&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;Craig expressed disappointment that I -- an unapologetic romantic
Nietzschean atheist -- would align myself with someone like Professor
Richard Dawkins. Dawkins, he says, is closed-minded; even &amp;quot;religiously
zealous&amp;quot; in his views. He finds Dawkins&amp;#39; views &amp;quot;sick&amp;quot;.
&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the new, or neo, Atheism of the twenty-first century;
and it just might warrant that capital letter considering the conviction
with which people follow it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Superstition, supernaturalism, and
mysticism are being attacked by people now better equipped than they&amp;#39;ve
ever been to mount an intellectual challenge to them. I believe this is a
natural reaction against the rise in religious extremism we&amp;#39;ve seen
since 9/11. Fundamentalist Islam has fueled the growth in fundamentalist
Christianity, whilst many non-believing moderates have been attracted to the
scientific rationalism of this new kind of Atheism. Religion, many people
believe, is just too dangerous not to require a corresponding and rational
opposite to bring balance.
&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main proponents of this movement are people like Professor

Ahhh I see what you doing here, but it's just not true.

My oldest goes to a faith school, and they have to take 20% of
children not of that faith into the school.  They have not tried to
drum Christianity down his neck, he goes to church with the school
once a term, and he has told me that he can handle that(he largely
daydreams)  So that is at least one faith school I know of that has
not even attempted to seperate kids based on faith, nor any other
thing.

What about clubs that exclude on a sex basis, then are they guilty of
'sepertating young children' due to sex?  You know Cubs, the Brownies
etc..., do they elicite the same kind of response from you, why?, why
not?

Where is the evidance for what you impley?  Heh or does this stance
stem from a more emotional response?

The mere fact that you include this; 'sepertating young children', in
your initial response to my question, tells me that undoubtedly your
issue here is not quite rational, umm Ian whatgwan?

Irrational? No, anything but irrational. Faith schools are doing real
and lasting damage to children's education and are stifling hard-won
efforts toward encouraging multiculturalism in Britain. Examples?

Fact 1: Faith schools are actively engaged in promoting the religious
differences between children. [Source: NUT]

Fact 2: Almost all the variation in social segregation between school
intakes in England and Wales is caused by two factors: the nature of
local housing and school diversity. Schools that use non-standard
admissions procedures and catchment areas (specialist schools and
faith-based) drive up segregation. [Source: Cardiff University School
of Social Sciences, TES]

Fact 3: Faith schools exist in Britain where English is not only the
second language, it is barely spoken at all. The Muslim and Jewish
community are both guilty of this, creating "pocket communities" that
are isolated and disintegrated from mainstream broader society.
[Source: Dispatches]

Fact 4: Under the government's academy scheme, a private interest can
put up two million pounds to build a school, and then the public must
then subsidise this to the tune of a further 20 million pounds. This
has led to the creation of esoteric and disintegrating "specialist"
schools outside of government control where, to be clear, the National
Curriculum is not on the menu. Of these new academies, fewer than 20%
have actual paid up the required two million pounds. [Source: TES]

Fact 5: Vardy Academies have, despite parental and government protest,
continued to try and teach Creationism and Intelligent Design in
science lessons. To say nothing of the circus of American Creationist
speakers they have wheeled in to "teach" the children. I can't find a
source for this right now, but it's been on the news plenty.

Fact 6: IPPR is opposed to faith school's selection criteria on
grounds of social segregation. T'was in the news last week.

Fact 7: "Children in Northern Ireland show signs of beginning to learn
to hate those on the other side of the province's religious divide
almost as soon as they can walk, according to a survey. By the ages of
5 and 6 large differences were also found amongst Protestant and
Catholic children over preferences for Christian names, colours and
football shirts...  Dr Paul Connolly, one of the authors blamed the
attitudes on the family, the local community and schools. (Too Young
to Notice? The cultural and Political Awareness of 3-6 Year-Olds in
Northern Ireland, commissioned by the Community Relations Council and
Channel 4, carried out by Ulster University researchers.)"  [Source:
Daily Telegraph]

Fact 8: An analysis of the admissions policies of nearly 400
secondaries by the London School of Economics shows that many are
disregarding a Government code of practice.  The criteria for some
religious schools are impossible for even the most devout family to
meet. Others are accused of contravening legislation by unfairly using
the performance of siblings for accepting or rejecting pupils, or of
having vague policies that allow the school to select the pupils it
wants. [Source: TES, LSoE]

Fact 9: Voluntary-aided (church) and foundation schools are much less
likely to have special educational needs in their lists of admissions
criteria than community schools. [Source: TES, LSoE]

Fact 10: Faith schools also more than six times more likely to select
by either ability or aptitude than community schools. [Source: TES,
LSoE]

Fact 11: In a recent survey on that most God-fearing of radio stations
(Radio 4), 95% of listeners believed faith schools were divisive.

All of this is to say nothing of the rampant teacher employment
discrimination that goes on in these schools that has been widely
reported. When offering someone a job or not, you can't discriminate
against someone on grounds of their religion -- unless you're a faith
school! The NUT have been all over this for years, it's utterly
scandalous.

Well done though, it sounds like your son attends a moderate faith
school -- or one that has outgrown it's CoE origins but may maintain
the link by tradition.

All too rare, I'm afraid.

Heh as we all know we have a massive problem with multiculturalism
here in the UK, I thing perhaps we may have one of the biggest
problems anywhere in the world.

Come on Ian, we have a great record when it comes to multiculturalism,
we are one of the most liberal and intergrated peoples around.  I'm
not too sure how old you are, but if like me you remember being at
school in the later 70's and early 80's then you can help but see how
very much better intergrated we are now.

Faith schools actualy out perform other schools on exam results, that
suggest to me that rather than hinder our childrens education, it
greatly helps.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Again I ask why this is a big deal, if two people are of difeant
faiths, then obviously there is a religous differtance between them?
If tow people are of differant colours then obviousl;y there is a
colour differance between them.  We are in fact all diffeant from each
other, the problem comes when these differanes are not tolerated,
religouse differance is not an issue in and of itself, it is how we
handle these differance that matter.

This though is to do with the current way in which all schools take in

Fair doo's It could be argued that private schools should generate

What?  That just don't make sense, all schools choose on a system of
banding, they are leagaly requierd to take a certian amount of

Lee,

I'm honestly in a state of shock that you don't see with the problems
with faith schools, especially as we're political allies for the most
part! Don't you just think there's something inherently wrong with
separating children based on religious differences? Leave the religion
to the privacy of your own home; education should be integrated and
egalitarian in order to provide a balanced upbringing for children
growing up in a world where religion is the #1 divisive issue we face.

Schools have a serious social responsibility to the communities of
which they are part, which they are demonstrably failing to provide
because they are not recognising that society has massively changed.
Britain is not the Christian country it always was, where quaint CofE
schools were the happy norm in our communities. Now we have a much
more diverse religious population and -- as you must surely recognise
-- a very serious problem with religious fundamentalism and extremism.

Regarding the quota system: Unless you've not been following the news
both the Catholic and CofE are firmly against these quotas. Not only
do they not want them increased (remember Alan Johnson's climb down on
25% quotas in October last year?); they're vitriolic in their demands
to have them totally removed.

That aside, the quota system is demonstrably not working. The NUT says
is an unenforceable farce, with no meaningful way to monitor it. The
Muslim community says its cannot be filled, even if they wanted to.
When you factor in parent's faking a conversion to Christian religions
just so their child can meet the entrance requirements of a school,
you can see it's really getting much worse.

This is hardly a fair and egalitarian way to provide education is it?

Hey Ian,

Heh shocked ya huh!

No I really don't see the problem, perhaps if you outline how
religious differance is a problem?

As I said we are all differant, it is how we deal with the differance
that is important, you seem to be saying the fact that we are
differant is what is problematic?

When you say 'seperating children based on religous differance' what
do you mean, I see no problem here.  As I pointed out all faith
schools have to take in 20% of non faith pupils(and in fact some take
upto 40%), that is not seperation.

Lets equate it with race, would you see a problem in Spanish imegrants
to this country attending a school where special emphasis was put on
the contiued learning of the Spanish language?

Faith schools are just schools, that happen to put special emphasis on
learning about a particular faith, no problem in my book.  I have not
yet seen a faith school that indulges in the type of 'seperation' that
you seem enamoured with.

Ian,
I don't see the egregious cost.  The better question is at what cost
do we want public schools?  I've had the experience of attending some
of the worst run schools in history, namely American Schools.  It's
the same problem you run into anytime you allow the government to run
something.  There is no financial incentive for them to do well since
there is no serious competition.  I think having churches and other
institutions run schools is a great idea.
