I have just finished watching report on RTE1 News on TV about the poor two
17 year old's killed in the car crash in Roscommon at 2am in the morning. I
have a couple of comments:

For a start I was appalled that they have a Garda talking to the news who
seemed inappropriate who sounded quite jolly and almost looked like he was
going to laugh or something rather than some Garda that would show
compassion.... and not look so happy. I am sure the Garda in question is a
very nice and friendly man but in this situation you have to have someone
that shows a bit of compassion I think.

another comment what were 17 year olds doing out driving on the roads at 2am
in the morning for anyway especially weekday? and 4 17 year olds in the car
and that time in the morning, I know I shouldn't tar them all with the same
brush but you know teenagers all in a car are like with egging the driver to
go faster.

However, the Priest that was interviewed afterwards would have you believe
that the road they were travelling on was 'substandard' and dangerous and
that there have been other crashes there - but even if some people get onto
a substandard road if you drive on that road too fast you are going to leave
it .

I don't want to speed ill of the dead and my thoughts are with the teenagers
family but these poor kids with their life just starting out when is someone
going to stand up and really do something about not just making the roads /
road conditions great in Ireland when is someone going to tackle the issue
of teenagers out late at night and speeding (quite possibly drinking as well
maybe) and leaving the roads like this-  its happening too often and too
many teenagers are losing their lives over it.

I think it's significant that the two in the front are &quot;only&quot; seriously
injured while the two in the rear are dead.....seatbelts? I wish they
would emphasise the lack of belts more in fatal crashes.

You are right there - I wonder if they would have survived though. That was
pretty smashed up good and proper that car. I hope the other two in the
front pull through OK.

Its hard, I think if kids are bought up to wear seatbelts in the back on
every ride it comes as second nature just to automatically put them on, on
every trip. I remember seeing once some teenagers actually hanging out the
rear windows of cars (on the way back from a local match I think it was) and
the cars were travelling at quite a speed. They were having a laugh and
enjoying themselves but I just wondered what would happen if the car left
the road, could have quite easily gone down a ditch and rolled over.

another time I saw a 11 year old jumping around in a people carrier and
leaning out a back window - I said to the wife look at him isn't that
dangerous to which she replied the one who was driving 'I am sure thats the
local woman Garda who is driving that!' she was off-duty but still. If you
see that going on and even the Gardai cant stick to the law what messages
does that give to others?

&gt; Andy, as I'm sure you are aware, this has been going on for years.  It
&gt; is not peculiar to Ireland.

&gt; You cannot fix this problem through legislation and to a certain
&gt; extent, I don't think you can fix the problem at all.

&gt; Teenagers will invariably get up to high-jinks and eventually do
&gt; something stupid, even if there's no alcohol involved.

&gt; Mostly, I suspect that they have little sense of their own mortality.

&gt; Something you can do is try to drum enough sense into your own kids so
&gt; that they don't come to too much harm while teaching themselves to
&gt; become adults.

&gt; HVB

Yes, I know its not confined to Ireland and I know its been going on
years. - Financing and resources aside, I am just thinking if there were
more Gardai out at night on the roads and if they were stopping cars full of
teenagers and asking why they are out late and where are they heading to and
breathylising them and catching them when they are doing that  'drifting or
is it diffing' thing they do on the roads with there cars might cut down the
problem (and save some lives) maybe?

I don't do shift work and I am glad I don't actually when I hear about
accidents like this that occur in the night/ early morning. Sometimes lately
now I see the tyre marks on the main N-Roads road in circles so I know it
goes on regularly but are they being stopped at all or are they just allowed
to get on with it.

Its tough bringing up kids I am at the stage now where I have a teenager in
Secondary and a 12 year old girl in Primary and I do try and steer them in
the right direction but I sometimes think that being too heavy handed makes
you come across as worrying too much and coming across as boring whereas
with their friends it most probably is more exciting to do what they do
instead

- I mean I am always talking to my son about these accidents and everything
and he is a great lad (in my eyes) and comes across as sensible and as he
gets older and maybe gets into a car with other teenagers that he will
remember all what he has been told about belting up and not acting the eejit
but if the others in the car are acting like eejits and dangerous he is
hardly going to tell them all to put seatbelts on and the driver to drive
slowly and responsibly and the others in the car to stop mucking about and
sit down is he thinking about it realistically. It all has to do with who
they mix with I suppose and you cannot watch over them all the time.

Silly idea, I know most accidents happen at the weekend but to not have a
system in place where there is Garda presence on the roads on weeknights as
well seems a bit of a hit and miss system that's not working - I appreciate
the Gardai cannot be everywhere but I think the system in place can be a lot
better than it is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There's some doughnut circles on the road near me too.  The Guards
&gt; can't be everywhere.  Again, that's not especially new either but
&gt; there's probably more teenagers with access to cars these days than
&gt; ever before, so perhaps we're just seeing more of it.

I like the bit where you say they have access to cars these days - more than
likely we are talking about when they steal them or 'borrow' them off their
parents or whoever (by asking or not asking whatever the case may be).

&gt; Aye, it does.  You can't give them your wisdom and you have to let

Again fingers crossed but sometimes I suppose its not all plain sailing and
there might/will be 'testing times ahead!' - you just don't know these days

&gt; Maybe not, but if he's a smart lad, he might not get into that car in
&gt; the first place.

I don't know, I know our kids do listen to us and hopefully know right from
wrong but there is that danger at the moment that some of the other kids
they call friends in school have been brought up different and get up to a
few things that raise your eyebrows but they say how 'cool' they are -
however you cant seem to always be dictating who they cant mix with as I
would rather them have friends rather than goody goody and have no friends
at all. Its pretty difficult.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's right and you have to let them mix with who they want to you cat
choose their friends.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It certainly does.  I'm sure you'll get a feel for the wrong-uns

Its 10 past 8 Friday evening and I have heard a least 3 cars in the last
hour (different I think) speeding / revving in the distance from my home and
one even slammed on its brakes I heard. I reckon I could safely say its boy
racers / teenagers in souped up cars out tonight just driving fast and
that's their recreation.

Its a regular thing most nights and I know it happens around the country as
well - but what or who is enforcing the law and attempting to take these
eejits off the roads and make driving safer for everyone (responsible
drivers) who have to share the roads with these ones. If they decide to act
like muppets and manage to not handle the power / vehicle if they come
unstuck its one thing if they wipe themselves out (which is a real shame
because they have a whole life ahead of them) they can also take along
innocent people with them who are just coming home from work or going out
tonight!

Did people see that car that was all mashed up on the news - how on earth is
17 years old driver got a car like this how do they get insured on such a
car and how can they afford a car like this in the first place and should
insurance places just be offering 17 years old with insurance just for cars
not exceeding 1100cc?

According to this site http://www.iol.ie/~discover/driving.htm 3.
Wearing of seat belts is compulsory in front and rear seats. as well as
4. Children under 12 years age not permitted in front seats. So there
you have it. But I agree with Andy, the insurance companies should limit
the size of cars younger drivers can drive. But on the other hand, there
was talk in the UK of having people retake thier test when they reached
retirement age. No doubt that wont happen as many would fail!

Enjoy your weekend all, and Drive Safe!

My elderly FIL could not hardly walk from one end of the room to another and
he had to renew his driving licence because of his age - he paid the local
doctor a sum of money, doctor signs form to say he is OK to drive, he gets
licence renewed and that's it! - he is still here with us (i.e. alive) but
he don't drive now (TBTG).

&gt; Jobs. Like most adults pay for things.

&gt; But the most likely scenario is that they are on their parents

I don't think its the right way maybe anymore to put kids on their parents
insurance especially if they have not passed a test - what's the worse that
could happen the kids would just have to carry on getting lifts or public
transport or getting lifts from their mammys!

Then when the time comes they can afford their own insurance then maybe they
might be a bit more responsible and careful.

Who knows for sure, but I think so. I know a 19-year old who is
otherwise pretty wreckless and rebellious, but always puts on his
seatbelt without thinking -- as it was drummed into him at an early age.

of course though I would hate to hear of a story that wearing an actual
seatbelt hindered the driver/passenger from escaping an accident and
thankfully you don't ever hear of that (or not much anyway)  but if you were
in a small accident and the seatbelt 'locked' you into your seat and you
couldn't escape but the car was going up in flames then obviously that's not
good but as I say thankfully that doesn't happen and its still safer to belt
up rather than not.

Isn't it silly that depending on what job you have you can be exempt from
wearing a seatbelt.
