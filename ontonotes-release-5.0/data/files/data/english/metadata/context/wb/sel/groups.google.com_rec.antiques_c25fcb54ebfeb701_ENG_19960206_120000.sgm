At least two paople have reviseted the question of a moderated group again
recently. I find that I am almost not looking at anu of the postings,
just blasting through because there is often very little there. The
same is true of r.a.m because of all the noise. I think that I would
be in favor of both a moderated r.a and a moderated r.a.m so we can
get rid of the junk and keep this on antiques.

r.a.m in its entire history can be counted on the fingers of my left
hand without using the thumb.

Chuck, if you continue to come out in favor of moderation, you'll
be branded a Nazi, a fascist, a power-hungry control freak and just
about every other epithet an unimaginative and underutilized brain
can come up with.

Don't say I didn't warn you.

"/> Yep, that was me that brought that up (after you posted that maybe we
should consider moderating rec.antiques.marketplace, too). After all, it
was during the RFD and I was addressing one of the factors that I felt
should be considered by people who were going to be voting. And, of
course, anyone who read my postings and thoughts could give as much (or as
little) weight to them when it came time to vote as they wished. But we
didn't get a chance to vote, did we? Instead of letting the voting
process continue, you withdrew the proposal from UVV (which was your
right, as the proponent) and left the rec.antiques newsgroup.

Whatever personal reasons or motivations led you to stop contributing to
r.a. are not my concern and do not really belong in a posting to this
group. But I can't understand why you decided to short-circuit the
newsgroup creation process. If the moderated newsgroup had been voted
into existence, it would not have required any future additional work on
your part as you were not one of the proposed moderators. But instead,
after much debate, everyone was left sitting around and waiting for a CFV
which never came...leaving honest differences of opinion unresolved.

And we *were* waiting for the CFV because you didn't even bother to let
the people here know about the cancellation. You did not even bother to
notify the proposed moderators about the cancellation!! In private e-mail
correspondence with two of them (more than a _week_ after the
cancellation) I found they were also waiting for the CFV to appear. I
feel that this shows a disregard and disdain for both the newsgroup and
the people who post here.

"/> Charleen, although there has certainly been an increase in inappropriate
ad postings lately, there has also been an almost complete absence of
sarcastic and argumentative postings since you disappeared from this
newsgroup. While many people (including myself) would welcome your
knowledge and participation in rec.antiques, I would hope that you will
keep your postings on a more professional level. There will always be
differences of opinion, but when people are sarcastic or abusive...well,
THAT'S inappropriate posting.

&gt;Yes, some genius actually suggested this during the last
&gt;moderation hoo-hah.

"/> It's too bad the discussion sank to this level the last time
around. I'm glad i missed it. But with a GREAT deal of respect
for your knowledge and very extensive contribution to this group
in the past, Charleen, I have to ask, don't you think that perhaps
this sort of sarcastic (and apparently angry) post merely serves to
engender still more sarcasm and still more angry posts?

I fully respect your right to say whatever you want, but
I think it just invites and incites the kind of obnoxious rebuttal that
you're complaining about.

During the &quot;what's it worth&quot; flame wars of '94, I often wondered
how many people who stopped in to learn/share something threw
it into reverse real fast, thinking they'd come to the wrong
place. Yes, probably more came to learn than to share. That's
life. So, as for the issue of answering questions and getting
no thanks (raised in a previous post on the subject of
having r.a. moderated)...don't answer them if it bothers you.

I have spent a lot of time thumbing through all my references,
answering the perennial question, &quot;What's the value of this
old book.&quot; In the process I've learned about that book,
exercised my mind, and kept the dust from accumulating
on my reference books. I still am amazed that people
expect you to take that kind of trouble without ever
acknowledging your effort, but again, that's life.

[Aside: Frankly, I think the reason I often don't get a thanks
is because people don't like my answer. It's 9 times
out of 10, &quot;Sorry, it's not worth more than about $10.&quot;
Disappointment over postponing one's retirement can be
a heavy burden to bear and seems to cause people to
forget social niceties like saying thanks. :)]

The fact is that there are zillions of jerks in this world, and
every day millions of them are buying computers and modems
and thinking they can just hop onto the Net and make a
killing. The key to living peacefully around here, IMO,
is to recognize that fact without thinking *everyone* is a
jerk and to simply ignore them when they come our way.

The other thing to bear in mind is that there are many WONDERFUL
people inhabiting rec.antiques. I still correspond occasionally
with a couple of them, and we've exchanged goodies and laughs
and information. Lots of people who pop in here might feel
unqualified to contribute or, because of past flame wars,
too intimidated to post. They should still be made to
feel welcome. Who knows, if it stays peaceful in here for
a long enough stretch, some might even get up the courage to
say something. :)

WTBs &amp; FSs. This is for antiques discussion and that constitutes
less than 10% of the postings. Clearly we need a Moderator screening and

I did not support the original movement for a moderated rec.antiques, but I
now strongly support it. There's never any discussion anymore, and there's
very little help given here, it seems. I've even tried to answer some
questions about things that arent in my specialities because I hate to see
people go unanswered, even if I can help only a little. I know that no one
has seen fit to attempt to help me any of the last 2-3 times I've posted
questions. I've stopped looking for assistance here for that reason.

I've been away from the group for a while due to time constraints.
The first thing I noticed on resubscribing is that this group
is *chock-full* of FS/WTB ads and the discussion posts seem few and
far between. Personally, I would support a moderated group
and really do not see what the problem would be in having one.
In order to ease the workload on moderating, the group could
have a small panel of moderators. Thus, it isn't always one
person doing all the work and making all the decisions.
I would like to be able to stay subscribed to the group, but
one of the main reasons I had to leave earlier was because of
the time it took me to weed out all the junk. I was hoping things
would be better by now, but it seems I see more ads in here
than ever! In any case, I'm going to give it another try but wanted
to add in my thoughts on the issue.

"/> Hi All.

I find I usually don't respond to posts publicly or initiate articles
on this newsgroup because I've seen quite a few folks being jumped upon
(with words, that is) for making attempts at advice.

It seems alot of us want discussion, but some see fit to admonish
in a public forum. That threat keeps me quiet.

Would a moderator change that? I don't think so.

As for all the &quot;forsale&quot;&quot;wtb&quot; posts. Yes, they're annoying. If they
were really bad I'd learn how to set up a killfile.

IMHO rather than people getting overly excited about postings that are
marketplace related, should merely click on and pass over the FS &amp; WTB
postings without reading them. Moderation will only add a form of
censorship that should be avoided. Although I am contributing to the
problem, it seems to me that this trivial discussion on what should and
should not be posted here has less to do with antiques than the
advertisments themselves. A simple polite email to the guilty party would
also reduce this unnecessary clutter. Besides does anyone really beleive
that merely changing the name of the group or adding new groups is
actually going to elliminate FS &amp; WTB postings?

"/> I don't know what questions you've asked, Connie, but it could be that
no one answered them because they weren't, well, interesting. (It
could also be that they're so esoteric that no one knows the answers.)

To give an example in the not-interesting category, someone posted today
wanting to know how much their old wooden jigsaw puzzles are worth.
These puzzles are kind of an interest of mine, and I probably could
have told them quite a bit about them. But all they wanted to know
was &quot;How much are they worth?&quot; Since I don't care how much old puzzles
are worth (monetary value is not why I like them), I won't post a
response.

Just one data point.

Someone else had a similar idea a couple days ago, and I think this

worth a try. Does anyone know how difficult it is to get a group's

"/>  I like your first suggestion best. These two sound a little too
academic for most of the discussions that take place here.
I think it would be worth a try, to just change the name rather
than saddling someone with the responsibility of moderating the group.

I also liked Jon's suggestion that we try to post more quality
info to help give people the idea that discussion is what this
group is for.

Just for the fun of it I did a ramdom count to see how many
out of 200 recent, sequential (at my site) posts were on the topic.
(Okay, so I have a weird idea of fun.) :)

Except for 45 (!) postings on the rec.toys.vintage CFV,
We fared better than I expected. It broke down like this:

On-topic Off-topic
-------- ---------
Where are flea mkts/shops? 5 | r.t.v CFV 45
Info for dealers 13 | WTB/FS 28
r.a. T-shirts 4 | Snide remarks 5
Antiques q &amp; a 62 | Collectibles q &amp; a 3
Pointers to web sites 7 | Test msgs 2
Discussions re: moderation | Replies better suited
and inapprop. posts 21 | for private e-mail 5
--- ---
112 88

Of course the proportions will vary on any given day, but I was surprised
that WTB/FS ads showed up only 28 times out of 200. (I didn't just
go by the headers, either, btw...i looked at the contents of the
postings.)

Maybe there's hope for us! :)

Hello
I belong to a moderated group that focuses on recipes. I have tried
to post twice. BOTH times my posts were &quot;reinterpreted&quot; by the
*moderators* who managed to misrepresent my request. I asked for recipes
specific to a traditional Chinese New Year's celebration, &quot;they&quot; listed
that as a request for &quot;Chinese Food&quot;. When I asked for a recipe for an
Asian course called &quot;Mongolian Hot Pot&quot;, the food overlords wrote that I
wanted to know how to use a Mongolian hot pot.
&quot;Bombay Fornicators&quot; aside how will you feel when you want to post
some question relating to moriage china, and see it twisted into &quot;wedding
dishes&quot;. It takes me about a second to delete the file marked &quot;Moderated
Group&quot;, with all of its contents, how long can it take those who are
obsessing over this WTB and FS stuff to do likewise with the objects of
their contempt?

&gt;title as a FS/WTB ads. Many, however, are not and the reader does not find
&gt;out they are a FS/WTB ad until they've opened up the post and read it. Many

&gt;submit for publication an article having to do with Victorian domed butter
&gt;dishes to a magazine about bicycles, the article would surely be rejected.
&gt;Censorship? No, of course not, my article is inappropriate for the forum
&gt;just as posts about items made after the 1950s, FS/WTB ads and a lot of
&gt;other topics are inappropriate for this forum.

"/> If the moderator were *only* to eliminate the FS/WTB ads and the
spam that's not even remotely related to rec.antiques, I could
agree to moderation. No accusations intended (in fact, I don't
have any idea who wants to take on the task of moderation), but
I could see where decisions could be rather subjective as to
what is or is not an antique and what aspects of discussing
it are appropriate for our discussion. I agree with Kal. I'd
like to avoid that and have the opportunity to decide for
myself what I do or don't want to read.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; A simple polite email to the guilty party would also reduce this

&gt;In the case of new readers who innocuously have posted this is often true,
&gt;however, there are many readers who continue to post their FS/WTB ads here
&gt;even though they know this is not where they belong. And then there are the
&gt;spams, tests, etc.

&gt;No.

"/> Nothing short of moderation will eliminate *all* FS/WTB postings,
but adding &quot;discussion&quot; to the name of the group certainly should
reduce them, since most people seem to be willing to post in
the right place once they've been informed. Because postings
arrive at different sites at different times, many people
who even take the trouble to look for the FAQ that's
posted occasionally might not be able to find it. Having a name
that clearly describes the purpose of this group might help in
that regard and result in fewer boo-boos.

Given the choice of having a perfectly uncluttered newsgroup
where nothing remotely off-topic ever shows up and having an open
forum where people from all backgrounds, with all levels of
expertise (or simply interest in learning) can feel free
to ask/answer questions and enter the conversation, I'm
strongly leaning toward the latter.

It's not *that* big a deal to hit &quot;n&quot; for &quot;next&quot; (on my newsreader,
at least) to whiz past something that doesn't belong here. It would
be a big deal if I missed out on learning about some area of
collecting because the moderator thought it wasn't appropriate.
I'm not implying any intentional censorship...I'm just saying
it's bound to be a subjective process.

Unless the prospective moderator(s) were willing to clearly
specify what they'll be deleting, I'd have to vote no if
we were deciding this today. If these people want to convince
me, I need to hear how they plan to carry out the responsibility
of moderation.

Again, no accusations or flames intended in any of this. I just
have honest reservations about making such a drastic change.

this is the first posting to r.a in a long time! What I'd like to find
would be someone who knows a lot about Royal Dux porcelains who would be
willing to e-mail me so I could ask some questions about a figurine I
bought several years ago. I don't want to know how much it's worth
because I'm NEVER going to sell it! But I WOULD like to KNOW more about

Wouldn't it by nice if all those for and against moderation would also
post information or discussion regarding antiques. That way at least
part of your posting might be of interest to those of us that want to
learn or discuss.

For my part I collect what ever catches my eye. After my purchase I
research as to what it is I have found. Sometimes I recognize things
before hand, but then so does everyone else and the price goes up
accordingly. Last summer at a Street Faire I found a porcelain figurine
of a lion holding a sheild. It is 6 1/2&quot; tall, completely white except
for the sheild which is blue and white diamonds. It is in perfect
condition. The mark is a sheild similar to the one the lion is holding
with a crown over it. Nymphenburg is under the sheild. It also has an
impressed sheild with 2010 under and 8 under that. This piece was made
around the turn of the century. Nymphenburg is in Germany. Any one else
have any Nymphenburg?

&gt;Yes! I agree with you JT, moderation should involve either accepting or
&gt;rejecting posts, it should not involve editing them.

"/> If you are really determined to pursue this moderation theme then it will
be necessary to clearly define and list exactly what postings will be
rejected.

Once a moderator(s) is appointed there is no readership control of that
moderator and there is no official way to remove a moderator once
appointed against that moderator's wishes - so the only safe way is to
specifically define in advance exactly what articles will be rejected.

Instead of a group of people writing up an RFD and launching it on the
readership, as happened last time this moderation issue arose, a pre-RFD
Straw Poll should be conducted to see what real support there is for
moderation and just what should be rejected by the moderator.

I do not personally favour moderation and most definitely do not want
&quot;rec.antiques.misc&quot; proposed for a _third_ time to create a *.misc
subgroup where all unwanted postings from the moderated group can
be dumped.

BTW these *.marketplace subgroups seem to be the &quot;in thing&quot; at the
moment and no one seems to realise that you cannot force readers
to confine their postings solely to the marketplace groups - the
result is that flamewars break out continuously as offenders continue
to offend and protesters continue to protest.

The question must be asked &quot; Are *.marketplace groups a good idea ? &quot;

Bye,

moderation

"/> You bet. I would want the moderator to consider him or herself as
a censor rather than as an editor. Either it fits the charter and gets
posted as is, or gets returned with a canned polite note suggesting
a more appropriate venue. Period. No rewriting. No Hays office
One foot on the floor editing. MAYBE an addition of a collective to
the title, if the person said &quot;!!!!!!!!!KOOL SHIT!!!!!!!!&quot; instead of
&quot;Civil War Artifacts&quot;-- but I'm not sure about that. I guess I'd rather
know I was about to read something from an idiot than to have it

hand painted plates. I have four signed, 3 Vienna by Kaufmann, Juno, and
Martino, and one German by Gragonaro. I f anyone has personal knowledge

"/> There is a good chance that the artists have little to do with Royal
Vienna or Germany as it was a common practice to import blanks (unpainted
china) into this country for home painters. Along with embroidery and
sketching, painting china was a pasttime for &quot;genteel&quot; women around the
turn of the century.

If you know the person from whom you acquired the plates, you might ask an
older member of that family (if possible) if they know of any friends
whose names were Kaufmann, Juno, etc.
