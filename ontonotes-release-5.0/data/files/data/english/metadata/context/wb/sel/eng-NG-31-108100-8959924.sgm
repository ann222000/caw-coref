They must have misread the script...we're fighting them over there so
we don't have to fight them here. We won't have another terrorist

Speaking of Tokyo Rose

Shades of the past.... Tokyo Rose..... (Anonymous author)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;During World War II we used to listen to this lady on
&gt;&gt;shipboard in the Pacific, and she was remarkably accurate
&gt;&gt;on which ship was going where and who was on board.
&gt;&gt;She had the UDT's even pinned to the C.O. Officers names
&gt;&gt;in many cases. Good music too.

&gt;&gt;The other night we watched a movie called, 'Flags of
&gt;&gt;our Fathers.' During the movie, I pointed out the radio
&gt;&gt;broadcast of 'Tokyo Rose.'
&gt;&gt;She had the best music on her station.

&gt;&gt;During World War II, the Japanese developed a way to
&gt;&gt;demoralize the American forces.

&gt;&gt;Psychological warfare experts developed a message they
&gt;&gt;felt would work. They gave the script to their famous
&gt;&gt;broadcaster, 'Tokyo Rose' and every day she would broadcast
&gt;&gt;this same message packaged in different ways.

&gt;&gt;The Japanese hoped it would have a negative impact on
&gt;&gt;American GI's morale. What was that demoralizing message?
&gt;&gt;It had three main points:

&gt;&gt;1. Your President is lying to you.
&gt;&gt;2. This war is illegal.
&gt;&gt;3. You cannot win the war.

&gt;&gt;Does this sound familiar today?

&gt;&gt;It does because we are being bombarded by Tokyo Hillary,
&gt;&gt;Tokyo Harry, Tokyo Teddy, Tokyo Nancy, etc., and they have
&gt;&gt;picked up the same message and are broadcasting it on
&gt;&gt;Tokyo CNN, Tokyo ABC, Tokyo CBS, Tokyo NBC, etc.

&gt;&gt;The only difference is that they claim to support our
&gt;&gt;troops before they demoralize them.

&gt;&gt;Hmmm -- Come to think of it, Tokyo Rose told the troops
&gt;&gt;she was on their side, too.  (She was later convicted of treason and
&gt;&gt;sentenced to prison).

&gt;&gt;What's the difference? You tell me!!!

Here in the highly flammable southwest, we've been wondering for
several years why some terrorist organization has not yet tried
starting many simultaneous fires. It would really strain our resources
and have a huge economic impact.

The Japanese tried that with thousands of balloons that dropped
incendiary bombs into the Pacific NW forests during WW2. Their only
mistake was doing it during the rainy season.

Did kill 6 people who happened on an unexploded bomb in the woods, who
dinked with it though.

Your &quot;Fwd&quot; about &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot; was interesting,  but had nothing to do
with the present situation in Iraq,  at all!
Tokyo Rose was an American citizen,  who lived out the war in Japan,
while doing her broadcasts.....
Secondly,  as the writer claims,  the GIs enjoyed her program,  but it
didn't affect how they felt about fighting Japan in the least......
Do you think any of the insurgents in Iraq care what American
politicians have to say about the situation?  I sure don't!
Those boyos in Iraq are only thinking about the fun they'll have up in
paradise,     when they get those 72 virgins in bed!

It's obvious you are extremely naive.  The terrorists definitely take heart
from the quotes of the libkook politicians since they agree with them.
Their chief hope is that the lib press and weasel politicians will force us
to bail out before the job is done.  You libs are their best allies.
