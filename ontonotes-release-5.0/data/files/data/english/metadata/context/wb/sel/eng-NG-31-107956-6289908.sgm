Photo from one of my favorite coves.

I posted this for all those stuck in the frigid NE, this is my effort to

Very - um - "green".  :&gt;)

This is one of those photos that begs for a dose of HDR processing.

The problem with images like this is that background detail is lost in
shadow which presents a blob of dark color.  You might have done
better to use a multiple exposure, then processed out the darks and
enhanced the image with HDR.

I think I'd have liked it more with more light, and no land mass in the
foreground, only a reflection from the water. I like the way the light is
playing off the water, and think that should have been emphasized. The land
mass in the foreground does little for me.

JohnH,
Thanks for the feedback.  This is really another experiment for me
playing with Photoshop and Lighroom.  To highlight the sun rays, which
to me is the interesting feature in the photo, I have to darken the
water and landmass.

I have two other versions of the scene, taken from a different
perspective.  Let me know what you think.

ps - it really is a nice cove.  I love to anchor in here, read a book
and get some sun.

Nope, I like the sun's rays in RAY, just not the land in the foreground.

The birds look like artifacts and should be cloned out.

With respect to Ray, I might try to warm the image up a little by
targeting the dark areas and lighten up the dark masses to gain a
little detail - doesn't need to be much.

With respect to the two identical images...

As an experiment, you might want to  use the HDR plug in in Photoshop
and see what the results are.  A good way to do it would be to take
one image and use Curves or Bright/Contrast increase the detail in the
dark area, then use HDR to combine the two to increase detail.

These types of shots are always difficult even with film cameras and
the real results are always in processing.

Next time I go to the lake, I will take the tripod up so I can do some
real HDR.

ps - those birds are really dust artifacts.  I have since cleaned my
sensor, and I really should clean up any photos I upload, but I screwed up.

photo.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; foreground, only a reflection from the water. I like the way the light is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; playing off the water, and think that should have been emphasized. The land
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mass in the foreground does little for me.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; JohnH,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for the feedback.  This is really another experiment for me
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; playing with Photoshop and Lighroom.  To highlight the sun rays, which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to me is the interesting feature in the photo, I have to darken the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; water and landmass.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have two other versions of the scene, taken from a different
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perspective.  Let me know what you think.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ps - it really is a nice cove.  I love to anchor in here, read a book
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and get some sun.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope, I like the sun's rays in RAY, just not the land in the foreground.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The picture I absolutely love is:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Great picture!
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for your input, I have a tendency to put things in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; foreground, and I need to always shot it a number of different ways so I
&gt;&gt;&gt; see how they look on the monitor.

&gt;&gt; You need to leave Atlanta for a bit, come to DC, and we'll go downtown
&gt;&gt; where you'll see some *real* homeless folks!

&gt;If we got together in DC, I think I rather take some different photos.
&gt;I was drinking coffee in downtown DC and saw a homeless person having an
&gt;argument with a trash can.  I think the trash can was talking smack with
&gt;  him.  The trash can lost.

We've got some badass trash cans around here!

Whenever you feel like a trip up, give me a shout.

&gt;&gt; Back in the day, I volunteered at a homeless shelter in Boston as a
&gt;&gt; medical tech - basically using my Paramedic skills.

&gt;&gt; One day an obvioiusly discombulated individual walked into a door
&gt;&gt; frame and spent the next half hour trying to fight the door frame.

&gt;&gt; As sad as that truly was, it was hysterically funny to watch.

&gt;Yeah, there's nothing quite as funny as the mentally ill.  :&lt;}

I know what you mean and you feel horrible about it but you just can't
help it - it truly is funny.

I remember one guy who held up three ends of a conversation all in
different voices all by himself.  One of those personalities had a
wicked sense of humor and would make fun of the other two.  It was
amazing to see that in one person.

&gt;Of course, that's one of the reasons I tune in to this channel.

Sometimes, I would agree with you.
