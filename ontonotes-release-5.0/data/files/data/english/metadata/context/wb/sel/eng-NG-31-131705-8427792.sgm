Does anyone know of a facsimile of Django' signature? I've googled and
looked in the biographies I have, but can't find anything.

I think Django was illiterate, wasn't he? Dregni's biogrpay suggests
it. I wouldn't be surprised if he just made some kind of mark.

Max:
I have several pictures in my Django books with Djano's signature on
them. If you have the Michael Dregni book &quot;Django - The Life and Music
of a Gypsy Legend&quot; (The best Django bio available) look on page 131.
That page includes Grappelli's account of him teaching Django to sign
his name. If you don't have that book, I highly recommend it. It also
contains a picture with Django's signature.

That's it! Tx - I've read the book [great book] but had forgotten what
pics there were. Before I posted I riffled through it, too quickly
obviously, and missed it. There's an embroidery place just opened up
down the walk, and seeing as how I have a dog named Django, I'll get
Mr Reinhardt's sig on a t-shirt.

Grapelli taught him to sign his name by shape, usually he signed &quot;D
Reinhardt.&quot;

My family dog, a Vizsla, is named Django!

When he has been bad my wife uses his full name and he retreats to his
crate.
Great dog!  Very energetic and smart...not very good with arpeggios...
but we are working at it...

I emailed you a Django signature, from a different book. It is the
more common &quot;D. Reinhardt&quot; version (because Grappelli said Django
couldn't manage his first name very well. I had a cockatiel named
Django, but we eventually found out it was a female. So far, my wife
hasn't let me name any of our dogs Django.

In my memorial book of the life of former Gibson and Epiphone
clinician, Andy Nelson (my uncle), who passed away in 1995, I published
a photo of Andy with Django and the McPartlands (Jimmy and Marian) in
Chicago in 1946 when Django came over to tour with Duke Ellington.
Several photos were taken including the one on page 18 of my book
(freely available at
http://www.grinnellfamily.org/images/andybook.pdf ). Andy got the
picture from Ben Carlton, who probably got a copy from Jimmy
McPartland.

The story, which has since been corrected, was that Django was out with
the McPartlands after the Ellington concert, and told Jimmy he wanted
to see alto player Eddie Wiggins, whom someone in New York recommended
he listen to if he had the opportunity. My uncle was the guitar player
with this small group playing somewhere in Chicago's Loop, and about
took a dump when Django walked into the room (Andy and his friend,
guitarist Ben Carlton had just attended the concert earlier that
evening)! While he never saw Django again after that evening, he and
McPartland began a lifelong friendship. Until McPartland's death, he
was often a visitor to Andy's home on Florida's west coast, where they
enjoyed fishing, a &quot;taste&quot; or two, and some &quot;tea&quot;.

If you can find the Jackson Browne songbook from the `70s (I think its
titled '21 songs for piano and guitar' or something similar to that)
There is a picture on the cover of Reinhardt on guitar and Jack Browne
(Jackson`s father) on piano, signed 'Pour Jack, En Souveniour, D.
Reinhardt' .
(I may be slightly off with the spelling)

On the other side of the cover, there is a pic of Jackson and David
Lindley in a similar pose.

Oolong? Orange Pekoe? English Breakfast?    Most refreshing, to be

Isn't it too hot for a dog to wear a t-shirt this time of year?

Obviously it was wrong. I tried to interpret the cryptic email addres
