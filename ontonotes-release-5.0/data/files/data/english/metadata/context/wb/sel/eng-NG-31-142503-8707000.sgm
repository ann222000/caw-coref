IN CUSTODY: Wayne Yearwood, 33. DEAD: Andrew Browne, 22.

by HEATHER-LYNN EVANSON

A SHATTERED HOMOSEXUAL RELATIONSHIP that leapt to public prominence
in
court last Monday ended yesterday morning with one man dead and his
former lover in police custody.

Dead is Andrew Browne, 22, of 7th Avenue, Belleville, St Michael,
while the man with whom he publicly broke up, Wayne Yearwood, 33, is
now in police custody.

According to reports, it was in the early hours of yesterday when a
man smashed the door to the apartment shared by Browne and Yearwood
and destroyed furniture and other household items.

The reports said Browne was not at home at the time.

They further indicated that Browne returned home around 6 a.m. and
was
attacked by the man who stabbed him repeatedly.

The 22-year-old former Teen Talent contestant's body was left lying
in
a foetal position in a pool of blood at a back door.

The incident in the normally quiet, former upper-class neighbourhood
which is fast becoming commercialised, drew scores of onlookers to
the
scene, with some openly crying at the news.

Police quickly arrived and later took Yearwood into custody for
questioning.

Last Monday, Yearwood went before the District &quot;A&quot; Magistrates' Court
and pleaded guilty to threatening Browne, on August 19, telling him:
&quot;You can't done so, if we finish I gine kill you.&quot;

&quot;He tell me we done and I say, 'We can't done so' but I ain't
threaten
him. I told him, 'We can't done so, Andrew, two of we got to dead
together,'&quot; he had said in court.

He had also pleaded guilty to having a knife on Pinfold Street, The
City, the same day.

It was before a packed court that the two publicly aired their
relationship with allegations of infidelity. Yearwood stressed then
that Browne and he &quot;tek vows&quot;.

The two then conceded the relationship was over, with Browne telling
the court: &quot;I just want to finish with him and don't come round me no
more.&quot;

Yearwood had been placed on a bond to keep the peace for the next 12
months. A breach would have earned him a six-month stay in jail
