Warm-mongers and cheeseburger imperialists
MARK STEYN
Syndicated columnist

Something rather odd happened the other day. If you go to NASA's Web
site and look at the &quot;U.S. surface air temperature&quot; rankings for the
lower 48 states, you might notice that something has changed.

Then again, you might not. They're not issuing any press releases
about it. But they have quietly revised their All-Time Hit Parade for
U.S. temperatures. The &quot;hottest year on record&quot; is no longer 1998, but
1934. Another alleged swelterer, the year 2001, has now dropped out of
the Top 10 altogether, and most of the rest of the 21st century –
2000, 2002, 2003, 2004 – plummeted even lower down the Hot 100. In
fact, every supposedly hot year from the Nineties and this decade has
had its temperature rating reduced. Four of America's Top 10 hottest
years turn out to be from the 1930s, that notorious decade when we all
drove around in huge SUVs with the air-conditioning on full-blast. If
climate change is, as Al Gore says, the most important issue anyone's
ever faced in the history of anything ever, then Franklin Roosevelt
didn't have a word to say about it.

And yet we survived.

So why is 1998 no longer America's record-breaker? Because a very
diligent fellow named Steve McIntyre of climateaudit.com labored long
and hard to prove there was a bug in NASA's handling of the raw data.
He then notified the scientists responsible and received an
acknowledgment that the mistake was an &quot;oversight&quot; that would be
corrected in the next &quot;data refresh.&quot; The reply was almost as cool as
the revised chart listings.

Who is this man who understands American climate data so much better
than NASA? Well, he's not even American: He's Canadian. Just another
immigrant doing the jobs Americans won't do, even when they're federal
public servants with unlimited budgets? No. Mr. McIntyre lives in
Toronto. But the data smelled wrong to him, he found the error, and
NASA has now corrected its findings – albeit without the fanfare that
accompanied the hottest-year-on-record hysteria of almost a decade
ago. Sunlight may be the best disinfectant, but, when it comes to
global warming, the experts prefer to stick the thermometer where the
sun don't shine.

One is tempted to explain the error with old the computer expert's
cry: That's not a bug, it's a feature. To maintain public hysteria,
it's necessary for the warm-mongers to be able to demonstrate that
something is happening now. Or as the Fort Worth Star-Telegram put it
at the end of 1998:

&quot;It's December, and you're still mowing the lawn. You can't put up the
Christmas lights because you're afraid the sweat pouring off your face
will short out the connections. Your honeysuckle vines are blooming.
Mosquitoes are hovering at your back door.

&quot;Hot enough for you?&quot;

It's not the same if you replace &quot;Hot enough for you?&quot; with &quot;Yes, it's
time to relive sepia-hued memories from grandpa's Dust Bowl
childhood.&quot;

Yet the fakery wouldn't be so effective if there weren't so many
takers for it. Why is that?

In my book, still available at all good bookstores (you can find it
propping up the wonky rear leg of the display table for Al Gore's &quot;An
Inconvenient Truth&quot;), I try to answer this question by way of some
celebrated remarks by the acclaimed British novelist Margaret Drabble,
speaking just after the liberation of Iraq. Ms Drabble said:

&quot;I detest Coca-Cola, I detest burgers, I detest sentimental and
violent Hollywood movies that tell lies about history. I detest
American imperialism, American infantilism, and American triumphalism
about victories it didn't even win.&quot;

That's an interesting list of grievances. If you lived in Poland in
the 1930s, you weren't worried about the Soviets' taste in soft drinks
or sentimental Third Reich pop culture. If Washington were a
conventional great power, the intellectual class would be arguing that
the United States is a threat to France or India or Chad or some such.
But because it's the world's first nonimperial superpower the world
has had to concoct a thesis that America is a threat not merely to
this or that nation state but to the entire planet, and not because of
conventional great-power designs but because – even scarier – of its
&quot;consumption,&quot; its very way of life. Those Cokes and cheeseburgers
detested by discriminating London novelists are devastating the planet
in ways that straightforward genocidal conquerors like Hitler and
Stalin could only have dreamed of. The construct of this fantasy is
very revealing about how unthreatening America is.

And, when the cheeseburger imperialists are roused to real if somewhat
fitful warmongering, that's no reason for the self-loathing to stop.
The New Republic recently published a &quot;Baghdad Diary&quot; by one &quot;Scott
Thomas,&quot; who turned out to be Pvt. Scott Thomas Beauchamp. It featured
three anecdotes of American soldiering: the deliberate killing of
domestic dogs by the driver of a Bradley Fighting Vehicle; a child's
skull worn by a U.S. serviceman as a fashion accessory; and the public
abuse of a woman to her face, a half-melted face disfigured by an IED.
In that last anecdote, the abusive soldier was the author himself,
citing it as evidence of how the Iraq war has degraded and dehumanized
everyone.

According to the Weekly Standard, army investigators say Pvt.
Beauchamp has now signed a statement recanting his lurid anecdotes.
And even the New Republic's editors concede the IED-victim mockery
took place in Kuwait, before Pvt. Beauchamp ever got to Iraq.

They don't seem to realize this destroys the entire premise of the
piece, which is meant to be about the dehumanization of soldiers in
combat. Pvt. Beauchamp came pre-dehumanized. Indeed, he was writing
Iraq atrocity fantasies on his blog back in Germany. It might be truer
to say he was &quot;dehumanized&quot; by American media coverage. In this, he
joins an ever lengthening list of peddlers of fake atrocities, such as
Jesse MacBeth, an Army Ranger who claimed to have slaughtered hundreds
of civilians in a mosque. He turned out to be neither an Army Ranger
nor a mass murderer.

There are many honorable reasons to oppose the Iraq war, but believing
that our troops are sick monsters is not one of them. The sickness is
the willingness of so many citizens of the most benign hegemon in
history to believe they must be.

As Pogo said, way back in the 1971 Earth Day edition of a then-famous
comic strip, &quot;We have met the enemy, and he is us.&quot; Even when we don't
do anything: In the post-imperial age, powerful nations no longer have
to invade and kill. Simply by driving a Chevy Suburban, we can make
the oceans rise and wipe the distant Maldive Islands off the face of
the Earth. This is a kind of malignant narcissism so ingrained it's
now taught in our grade schools. Which may be why, even when the New
Republic's diarist goes to Iraq and meets the real enemy, he still
assumes it's us.

Nothing whatsoever.  It's about par for the course for Steyn, another
case of using selective stats in an attempt to mislead.

1934 was an aberration.  Also, by that same data, the 5-year mean
peaked in 2000, and will likely hit another new high this year (by
that same data, 2007 is currently the 4th hottest year on record for
the lower 48).

And, of course, as pretty much any grade schooler should be able to
figure out, Steyn posted regarding of the &quot;lower 48 states,&quot; which,
last I checked, isn't global.  He could have used global, it's right
there on the web site.  But, of course, it wouldn't have supported his
thesis, so he disregarded it (typical level of honesty for him).

The NASA chart for global is here:
http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata/ZonAnn.Ts+dSST.txt
Notice that 1934 was hardly global in being warm; now notice the
pattern over the last few years.

If you really want some fun, watch the trend as a movie:
http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/animations/a5_1891_2002_6fps_800kbp...

ok, fun's not quite the word for it.  I'd say that &quot;freightening&quot; is
more like it.

Oh, it gets better.  The data that they're pointing to here as their
supposed evidence that the theory is all &quot;fakery&quot; (which I suppose it
is, if one is utterly illiterate or doesn't care) is provided by *the
very same person* they slam for having supported Kerry and having
accepted a prize from the Heinz Foundation.

They might also try reading some of the site.  For example:
http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/2005/
&quot;The highest global surface temperature in more than a century of
instrumental data was recorded in the 2005 calendar year in the GISS
annual analysis.&quot;
The rest of it (and, yes, Hansen is the author) isn't any more
optimistic.

You might also check out http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/2005/2005cal_fig1.gif
Sure looks like &quot;fakery&quot; to me!!
In the meantime, compare now to 50 or 60 or however many years ago.

lol!  Do you seriously think that America's temperatures are what counts
when speaking of &quot;global warming&quot;?  Do you know what &quot;global&quot; means?
The polar ice caps and greenland ice melting has nothing to do with
whether America has had warmer or colder years in the past.

Fuck it, Steve, DID YOU EVEN READ THE DATA???

It does NOT say what Steyn (and you, his tool) seem to think.
EVEN IN THE LOWER 48, we are in our hottest recorded period.  EVER.
10 consecutive years above normal, a record.  A deviation from normal
over that period more than 35% in excess of any other previously
recorded period.  EVER.
Jesus Fucking Christ, Steve, just because Steyn is functionally

Calm down Matt.  I take your word on the data.  I just find it kind of
funny that when a single year for the lower 48 states was recently
thought to have set a record, then that single year was used as
evidence of global warming.  But when it turns out that the single
year record was really in the 1930s and not the recent year, then that
recent single year no longer matters.  What matters now becomes the
recent 5 year means, and not the recent single year.  And that single
year from the 1930s is now dismissed as a meaningless aberration.  As
well, in the entire scheme of things, you can also have 5 or 10 year
aberrations as well, though of course the longer the period, the less
chance of it being an aberration.

Anyway, you don't have to convince me that we've been going through a
global warming trend as I'm fully convinced.  I'm still less than
*fully* convinced that it's caused by man, though I think it probably
is.  It would have been nice if there was a contrary global cooling
period happening on Mars while the warming trend is happening on
Earth.  But the fact that there is also a global warming trend
happening on Mars in concert with what is happening on Earth does,
imo, increase the likelihood just a small bit that the warming trend
happening on Earth is not being caused by man.

I know that there are theories presented for why Mars is different,
etc...   But these such explanations for why global warming is
happening on Mars seem just a tad too convenient, if you ask me.

You had no problem saying that Steyn was misrepresenting data and that
he rated a 0.3 in terms of honesty on a scale of 1 - 10, but you
seemed unwilling to give an honesty rating to Al Gore regarding the
claims being made in his movie.  You said you hadn't watched his movie
and didn't give a shit.  Now you're way too educated and informed to
not know about the claims being made in his movie.  And I think you're
way too educated and informed to not know that his movie engaged in
distortions and presented some things which were just not true.  So I
understand why you punted rather than apply the same standard to him
that you did to Steyn.

If it's actually sunspot activity and not man that is causing the
global warming trend on Earth, which is a contrarian theory that's
been presented -- then a corresponding warming trend on Mars is
consistent with that theory.  So the scientists who say that man is
causing global warming on Earth have to explain away why it's not
sunspot activity causing the parallel warming trend on Mars.  So they
attempt to do that by theorizing that it's not the sun causing the
global warming on Mars, but rather it's slight changes in Mar's tilt
and orbit which are responsible.  That's a nice convenient theory, and
perhaps it's true.  But is the evidence for that conclusive, or is it
just that they need to come up with something because absent an
explanation, then what's happening on Mars casts doubt that it's
really man causing global warming on Earth?

Mars Melt Hints at Solar, Not Human, Cause for Warming, Scientist Says
Kate Ravilious
for National Geographic News

February 28, 2007
Simultaneous warming on Earth and Mars suggests that our planet's
recent climate changes have a natural—and not a human-induced—cause,
according to one scientist's controversial theory.

Earth is currently experiencing rapid warming, which the vast majority
of climate scientists says is due to humans pumping huge amounts of
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. (Get an overview: &quot;Global
Warming Fast Facts&quot;.)

Mars, too, appears to be enjoying more mild and balmy temperatures.

In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions
revealed that the carbon dioxide &quot;ice caps&quot; near Mars's south pole had
been diminishing for three summers in a row.

Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's
Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is
evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by
changes in the sun.

&quot;The long-term increase in solar irradiance is heating both Earth and
Mars,&quot; he said.

Solar Cycles

Abdussamatov believes that changes in the sun's heat output can
account for almost all the climate changes we see on both planets.

Mars and Earth, for instance, have experienced periodic ice ages
throughout their histories.

&quot;Man-made greenhouse warming has made a small contribution to the
warming seen on Earth in recent years, but it cannot compete with the
increase in solar irradiance,&quot; Abdussamatov said.

By studying fluctuations in the warmth of the sun, Abdussamatov
believes he can see a pattern that fits with the ups and downs in
climate we see on Earth and Mars.

Abdussamatov's work, however, has not been well received by other
climate scientists.

&quot;His views are completely at odds with the mainstream scientific
opinion,&quot; said Colin Wilson, a planetary physicist at England's Oxford
University.

&quot;And they contradict the extensive evidence presented in the most
recent IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report.&quot;
(Related: &quot;Global Warming 'Very Likely' Caused by Humans, World
Climate Experts Say&quot; [February 2, 2007].)

Amato Evan, a climate scientist at the University of Wisconsin,
Madison, added that &quot;the idea just isn't supported by the theory or by
the observations.&quot;

Planets' Wobbles

The conventional theory is that climate changes on Mars can be
explained primarily by small alterations in the planet's orbit and
tilt, not by changes in the sun.

&quot;Wobbles in the orbit of Mars are the main cause of its climate change
in the current era,&quot; Oxford's Wilson explained. (Related: &quot;Don't Blame
Sun for Global Warming, Study Says&quot; [September 13, 2006].)

All planets experience a few wobbles as they make their journey around
the sun. Earth's wobbles are known as Milankovitch cycles and occur on
time scales of between 20,000 and 100,000 years.

These fluctuations change the tilt of Earth's axis and its distance
from the sun and are thought to be responsible for the waxing and
waning of ice ages on Earth.

Mars and Earth wobble in different ways, and most scientists think it
is pure coincidence that both planets are between ice ages right now.

&quot;Mars has no [large] moon, which makes its wobbles much larger, and
hence the swings in climate are greater too,&quot; Wilson said.

No Greenhouse

Perhaps the biggest stumbling block in Abdussamatov's theory is his
dismissal of the greenhouse effect, in which atmospheric gases such as
carbon dioxide help keep heat trapped near the planet's surface.

He claims that carbon dioxide has only a small influence on Earth's
climate and virtually no influence on Mars.

But &quot;without the greenhouse effect there would be very little, if any,
life on Earth, since our planet would pretty much be a big ball of
ice,&quot; said Evan, of the University of Wisconsin.

Most scientists now fear that the massive amount of carbon dioxide
humans are pumping into the air will lead to a catastrophic rise in
Earth's temperatures, dramatically raising sea levels as glaciers melt
and leading to extreme weather worldwide.

Abdussamatov remains contrarian, however, suggesting that the sun
holds something quite different in store.

&quot;The solar irradiance began to drop in the 1990s, and a minimum will
be reached by approximately 2040,&quot; Abdussamatov said. &quot;It will cause a
steep cooling of the climate on Earth in 15 to 20 years.&quot;

His was a contrarian viewpoint.  The article mentioned that the most
disagree and why.  That doesn't mean he was wrong.  There would have
to be far more conclusive evidence of what is going on on Mars, rather
than conventional belief about what is happening on Mars.  Sometimes
contrarian views end up being correct.  But if everything is put up

what happens with regard to the global warming issue.  That somehow,
just because a majority disagree, that this is somehow proof that the

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently said there was
a 90% certainty that humans were mostly responsible for global
warming.  Unless I'm reading that wrong, that means their view is that
there is still a 10% chance man is not mostly responsible.  I guess
what I don't understand is why is a 90% chance of something treated by
so many as if it's a 100% certainty.

If you were on a jury and a person was accused of armed robery, and
you thought there was a 90% chance such person was guilty, but a 10%
chance such person was innocent -- would that 10% qualify as enough
reasonable doubt for you to vote not guilty?  Or would you vote to
convict beyond a reasonable doubt?

When a large majority agree with one view over another, that can set
in motion an additional societal pressure which creates a herd
mentality among some who might have been more open to buying into a
contarian view.  If such a herd mentality takes hold, a 70% majority
can quickly become a 90% majority.  I suspect some of that, or perhaps
even a lot of that, goes on in the scientific community regarding the

There are various global warming computer models.  While they all show
man contributing to global warming, they often disagree with each
other as to the extent.  And there are also so many minor variables
that a computer model cannot take into account, minor variables that
could potentially yield substantial differences in outcome if such

So a computer model is no better than the assumptions programmed into

Ditto this one. &quot;Right out of How to Lie With Statistics.&quot;

If you don't believe the statistic you quoted top of page, don't

to make a *logical* argument that they inflated their figures

Also, remember now that EVERY time you quote
a percentage statistic that argues *in favor* of your
point, those who disagree with you are going
to be justified in arguing that, if you truly believe
what you just said, there's just as much likelihood
that a &quot;herd mentality&quot; has inflated *your* supportive
figures by 20%. It swings both ways, Steve.

You get a D+ on this one :-(

Mike

And remember now that EVERY time you post a statistic

&gt;There are various global warming computer models.  While they all show
&gt;man contributing to global warming, they often disagree with each
&gt;other as to the extent.  And there are also so many minor variables
&gt;that a computer model cannot take into account, minor variables that
&gt;could potentially yield substantial differences in outcome if such
&gt;mionor variables were fully understood.

&gt;So a computer model is no better than the assumptions programmed into
&gt;them.  So how do you know which computer model is the most accurate,
&gt;or if any of them are really accurate in the long run?

&gt;There's the saying in the computer field &quot;garbage in, garbage out&quot;.
&gt;On something as complex as global warming, how do you know for sure
&gt;that what you think is the best  computer model is really not &quot;garbage
&gt;in, garbage out&quot; at the end of the day?

What we DO know for sure is humans are putting huge amounts of
chemicals compounds in the atmosphere.

&gt;&gt;That's absurd. Even those who believe in sunspots as a possible source
&gt;&gt;of temperature rise don't say it accounts for all of the increased

&gt;&gt;account the differences in atmospheres or the chemicals being put in
&gt;&gt;the earth's atmosphere.

&gt;The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently said there was
&gt;a 90% certainty that humans were mostly responsible for global
&gt;warming.  Unless I'm reading that wrong, that means their view is that
&gt;there is still a 10% chance man is not mostly responsible.  I guess
&gt;what I don't understand is why is a 90% chance of something treated by
&gt;so many as if it's a 100% certainty.

That's severely misrepresenting what 'so many' are saying.

When did you morph in Longyard with the silly analogies?

&gt;When a large majority agree with one view over another, that can set

&gt;even a lot of that, goes on in the scientific community regarding the

That's absurd. Apparently it still doesn't register with you that what
ALL agree on is that humans are polluting the planet. There is
considerable disagreement over what that means or what the exact
consequences will be. There is far less disagreement over whether or
not that will produce negative consequences. There is only one planet
and you don't get a second chance. WHat people are concerned about is
reaching a point of 'no return'. Most people have simply come to the
conclusion that is not a chance we should take as a species. I'mnot
really sure why you feel it necessary to misrepresent that position as
you do or why you would consider that so controversial among
scientists. The chemicals are there, they can be measured. We know how
they react with other compounds, etc.

It's really a no brainer that the present situation can't continue
indefinitely.
