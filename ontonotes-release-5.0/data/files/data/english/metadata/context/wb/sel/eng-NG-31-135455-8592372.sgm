The USB ports are detected, and the lights go on and someone is home. Then the
lights go off as every USB port leaves.

tail /var/log/messages and unplug then plug them in, the lights go on for a
moment, then out and leaves these messages:-

Aug 24 16:29:36 taogypsy kernel: usb 5-1: USB disconnect, address 6
Aug 24 16:29:36 taogypsy kernel: usb 5-1.4: USB disconnect, address 7

Anyone with any ideas?

As i can see you are using a hub. My first opinion is theres not
enough power? Which would be right if the hub is bus powered and not
powered by an external ac adapter.
Did you try it on other boxes and does it work there?

Yes I did have the same problem in my home's router a while ago. I solved
this by changing the value in /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-2/bConfigurationValue
which was initially 0 to 1. the OP could Â possibly wrap this value nicely
in ifup so to speak.

$ echo -n 1 &gt; /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-2/bConfigurationValue;

IMO this happens everytime theres a power shortage.

Everything worked on this laptop computer Acer Aspire 3614WLCi using Debian
testing till the last couple of upgrades.

Hub Scanner etc, works on an older Acer 3650 laptop, with Debian Etch, and in
windows on that machine.

You might be correct suggesting not enough power..........

The scanner doesn't do anything with its carriage and there are no lights
working in it when plugged in.

I have changed from an external USB to Serial cable dial up modem. To an
Ethernet satellite self powered modem. The dialup modem plugged into the bus
powered hub ensured the USB system of the computer was constantly activated.
The light was on all the time, because the modem was connected and working.

Now the hub light goes on and stays on.... only........ when I have something
like one of my external self powered DVD drives plugged in. This must be
constantly demanding of the computers USB system through the bus powered hub.
So the hub is activated and lights on.

But when nothing that requires constant surveillance [turned off printer] is
connected to the hub. The light stays out.

My system sees, recognises and labels my scanner correctly. But the scanner
doesn't demand power just by being plugged in.

charlie@taogypsy:~$ lsusb
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 04a9:220e Canon, Inc. CanoScan N1240U/LiDE 30

So the computer USB system doesn't kick in. Even when Xsane is evoked. It says
it is getting a preview, but the preview pane is black, and the lights and
carriage in the scanner remain off and stationary, respectively.

If I plug in an external DVD drive, the hub is activated, the light goes on,
the DVD reads and writes, and if I leave the external DVD drive plugged in,
the hub lights still on and plug the scanner into the hub. The scanner works
as described above. No lights, no carriage animation.

If I leave the hub working by leaving the external DVD drive plugged in, and
use another USB port ***directly*** to the motherboard of the computer [in
the computers side] The scanner still doesn't have any lights working or
carriage animation.

I think it may be a power issue, but this was never the case previously?

It's an interesting situation which is new to me.

taogypsy:~# lsusb
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
Bus 005 Device 002: ID 05e3:0606 Genesys Logic, Inc.
Bus 005 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000

I'm not certain that the USB system should be activating the hub [lights on]
if there is nothing demanding it's power? I think I like it better the way it
is now, but then how do I get the scanner working?

Too many questions and more questing required.

Thank you for your interest and suggestion.
Charlie
