Lunar distance accuracy

Looking for some qualitative comments regarding the accuracy of lunar
distances. I have been looking through the archives and not found
quite what I am looking for.

I have not had the time patience and discipline to carefully log my
observations but, I have noticed that the sun moon lunars seem to be
more accurate than star moon lunars which are in turn better than the
planet moon lunars.

Standing on land in good conditions, no averaging, I have found that
obtaining sun moon lunars with an accuracy of &lt;0.5' can be obtained
routinely with many sights well within this. Using stars I would have
to estimate a slight increase in error putting it at &lt;0.7'. Using
planets I find that getting reliable results consistently &lt;1.0' is
getting to be a challenge.

Have others had the same experience? Again, not looking for a detailed
statistical analysis but more qualitative comments.

I posted very many messages on the archive on this subject
in the recent years. Both qualitative and raw observation
data, and statistics.

I agree with the first part. But not with the second.
The Sun lunars are most accurate, indeed.
I think this has simple explanation:
our eye has better resolution in daylight.
On the planets my experience is different:
the best night results I achieve with Venus and Jupiter.
(It's true this required a lot of practice, about two years
of frequent observations).
The point is that for Venus and Jupiter, you see discs
rather than points. And you can learn to make these discs
divided by the Moon edge in exactly equal halves.
As I said, this requires a lot of practice, and a decent
sextant with a good scope.

Yes, I confirm this. And I posted a lot of statistics
related to this. My sights are better than that
ON THE AVERAGE, but I can say that 0.3-0.5 accuracy I can
obtain with reasonable degree of confidence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I agree that this is a challenge.
But I can do bright planets (Jupiter and Venus)
to 0.2' MOST of the time, but SOMETIMES the
errors of up to 0.6' occur.
As I said it took me about two years of practice
from my balcony.

Two questions:
1. Have you tried star-to-star distances?
2. What sextant and what TELESCOPE do you use.
I find that 6x telescopes are VERY MUCH superior
to the standard sextant 3x-4x scopes when you do
the lunars. I always use a 6x inverting scope
for all my land observations.

There is a long running argument between Frank and
me about lunars accuracy. Frank essentially claims
that a NOVICE (a person who never tried before,
after 2-3 days of practice) can take lunars
with 0'2 accuracy RELIABLY (with averaging 3-5 observations).
I disagree with this. And I cite several XIX century
authorities who did some research on the subject.

But of course I can be wrong:
1. My eye sight is not perfect (I am 54 years old)
2. My sextant is probably not the best one
(I have no way of knowing this! I did not have many
opportunities to try other sextants).
Speaking of the &quot;authorities&quot;, despite my efforts I did not
find any thorough and convincing scientific research
on the subject
of Lunars accuracy.
I mean large series of observations from an exactly
known place, by many different obsevvers, with various
sextants under various conditions.

In fact my observation books contain more material
than anything I've seen published, combined.
But this is by ONE observer, with ONE sextant.

Jim,
Let me briefly summarize what I know about Lunars
accuracy.

1. Expert's opinions (Lecky, Kelvin, Frank)
None of these authorities cites any data of specific
observations.

2. My own statistics of Cook's expedition observations
from the known point (Point Venus in Thaiti).
This I posted in a series of messages on this list
last spring.

3. Few observations of some land surveyors of XIX century
posted on this list, but the exact position from which these
observations were made is not always known.

4. Research of a German navigator in 1890-s;
unfortunately his observations were made in a sea voyage,
so the precise position of his observations was not known.
I can post his papers if someone is interested, but they
are in German.

5. My own observations during the last 3 years from
one exactly known position, and some sea observations
controlled by GPS. Many of them are posted on the list
but I have much more.

These are all data I have. I will be very grateful if some
one points to any other hard data or research on the subject.

Alex.

My own experience is that I can get individual Sun-Moon lunars accurate with
a standard deviation of about 0.25 minutes of arc. By averaging four in a
row, the net accuracy is nearly doubled. Sun-star lunars are worse for the
bright stars (e.g. Regulus) by a factor of two and for the fainter stars
(e.g. alpha Arietis) by a factor of three. For the planets, I get excellent
results with Jupiter, Mars when its bright, as it is now, and Venus when it
does not have much phase. For all of these, especially Moon-Jupiter lunars,
the results are just as good as the very best Sun-Moon lunars. I would
recommend trying some more Jupiter lunars to see if you can improve your
results.

In the first month when I joined this group, nearly four years ago, I posted
about Moon-Jupiter lunars. The thread starts here:
http://www.fer3.com/arc/m2.aspx?i=012716&amp;y;=200312

Incidentally, when you look through old logbooks, you find that something
like 80% of lunar observations were Sun-Moon, at least for American
commercial vessels. Celestial navigation was largely a daytime activity in
the 19th century. They also shot the standard lunars stars now and then, but
I have not yet found a single attested Moon-planet lunar. I'm sure some
navigators tried them, but since the ephemerides of the planets were less
accurate back then, using them may have been seen as one more layer of
uncertainty (which would have been true 175 years ago, but not today).

You may have missed the article by E.J. White from 1889 that I described on

post back then:

&quot;White then details the lunar distance observations he has made in the past
three years: forty-two lunars in 1887, 1888, and 1889. He lists the time and
measured distance (only approximately, not enough detail to re-work them
today) and also lists the error of the resulting longitude in seconds of
time. We can convert this to an approximate error in the measured lunar by
dividing by 120. That is, an error of 12 seconds in the longitude is
approximately equivalent to an error of 0.1 minutes of arc in the measured
lunar distance. Calculating from his listed numbers, I find he has a
standard deviation in Greenwich time of about 30 seconds which is equivalent
to about 0.25 minutes of arc in the lunar distances. If we take his lunars
in sets of four and average them (which I consider the best approach with
lunars), the results are generally within 0.1 minutes of arc. I would note
that these results are very similar to my own experience.&quot;

Do you agree with my recently posted explanation of this?
(That this happens because of lower resulution

How about star index check?

Many writers say that it is as precise (some say more

Frank Reed refers to the paper from E J White, in the Proceedings of the
Royal Society of Victoria, Vol 1 June 1889, that we've seen a year ago.

It can be found at-
http://www.clockwk.com/lunars/ejwhite

And indeed, it's a well-informed article, describing some years of
painstaking observation, and raising several interesting questions.

White refers at one point to Dudley Observatory. Is that the local
observatory in Melbourne, from where he made his observations? Does it still
exist?

He records Sun lunars, well spaced in time, by days, weeks, or months, taken
from the same spot on land, to the highest precision he can achieve, looking
for consistency and conformance with his longitude from Greenwich, known
from telegraphic determinations.

White uses a Troughton &quot;pillar-sextant&quot; from the early 1800s. That term has
been used elsewhere in two different contexts.

Occasionally, it's been used for a handheld sextant in which, to save
weight, the frame was made from two thin brass sheets, spaced apart by short
brass pillars, which should more properly have been called a double-frame
sextant, and usually was.

Otherwise (and this is the meaning that seems to be relevant here) it's a
sextant firmly mounted on a pillar stand, for use on land, not at sea. It is
usually arranged so that the whole sextant can be easily rotated about a
polar axis, parallel with that of the Earth, just as a telescope can. In
this way the two views from the sextant can be aimed appropriately at the
two objects (such as Sun and Moon) and then the instrument can be slowly
rotated about the polar axis to keep them in view, for as long as desired.
That allows the observer to perfect the alignment of the two bodies taking
as much time as he wishes, and then time the result, without being
constrained by the lasting-power of his arm muscles. It aso allows the
sextant itself to be larger and therefore heavier that a handheld instrument
could be. It would have been intended for measuring precise longitudes from
on land (just as Evans was doing) in exploration, and perhaps also for
measuring star-to-star distances in sky surveys. One would expect the
ultimate in precision when using it. It would, of course, have been a
Vernier instrument, not micrometer, but will have been machine-divided, to
the highest standards, for which Troughton were renowned at that time. Arc
division of sextants did not get much better over the following century and
a half.

It's also interesting to note that he was taking lunar distances that
frequently exceeded 120 degrees, the greatest being just over 130. That has
some interesting implications. First, that his sextant could cope with that
excess angle, in its length of scale and in depth of view in its index
mirror (though that wasn't uncommon). Second, that as an observer he fould
it possible to get Sun and Moon aligned in the plane of his sextant when so
far apart. That's a matter that many observers find really difficult with
large angular distances, and perhaps his pillar-mounting would help,
allowing him to take his time over the job. And thirdly, that although the
early Nautical Almanac had restricted its Sun lunar distance predictions to
120 degrees, by White's date that limit had increased to over 130.

The telescope on his sextant was mounted on a &quot;rising-piece&quot;, to alter its
spacing from the frame, while keeping it parallel, and White explains how he
used this to equalise the brightness of the images of the two bodies, so
that he never needed to change shades.

White compares his longitudes as being only 4.8s out from those determined
by the electric telegraph. I wonder how recently the telegraph had arrived
in Melbourne, and how precisely time from Greenwich could then be determined
in that way? The responses of early telegraph receivers were slow, and no
doubt there were several relay stages along the way, with perhaps human
hands required to pass the signals on. No doubt a lot could be done by
timing round-trip loops to decide a figure for the delay. But if Greenwich
Time could be transferred to Melbourne to within decimal parts of a second,
that was pretty good going, in 1889. Not that I am questioning it, just
remarking on the achievement.

Another point that White refers to is the errors in Moon predictions in the
Nautical Almanac, which &quot;forty years ago&quot; he says (i.e. 1849) could amount
to 22 miles in longitude. That was a disgraceful state of affairs, little
better than Mayer's predictions of a century before. Improvements came first
in the American ephemeris, followed later by Greenwich.

===========================

What I would like to question, however, is Frank Reed's treatment of White's
scatter in longitudes, in writing- &quot;If we take his lunars in sets of four
and average them (which I consider the best approach with lunars), the
results are generally within 0.1 minutes of arc. I would note that these
results are very similar to my own experience.&quot;

Just take as an example the quoted longitude errors (in seconds of time) for
the first four of the 42 observations that White records, at four
widely-spaced dates in 1887. I have added a third column in which those
longitude errors are converted, roughly, to error in lunar distance.

Aug 27,   -55 sec , -0.46'
Sept 10,  +11 sec,  +0.09'
Oct 8,     +30 sec,  +0.25'
Nov 19,  -35 sec,  -0.29'

It seems to me that these are numbers that Alex would recognise as being
very similar in scatter to those that he reports from his own balcony. But
in grouping that set of four into one, and averaging, Frank has reduced them
to a mean error of 0.1', and in doing so he has discarded the baby with the
bathwater, and the relevant information on the real scatter has been quite
lost.

As evidence, those details support Alex's view of achievable precision. Here
is a professional astronomer, using gear with which he is thoroughly
familiar, the best of its kind that existed (from the early 19th century),
correcting carefully for his index error, and even the temperature. And yet
from one observation, to the next on another day, he records differences of
a large fraction of an arc-minute. In my view, it does not support Frank's
contention, which I paraphrase, perhaps unfairly, that he can pull in anyone
from the street, present them with a sextant to throw up, to achieve lunar
distances to a tenth of a minute.

====================

Of course, these matters are relevant only to the question of the precision
achievable in measuring a lunar distance from on land, in perfect conditions
with precise instrumentation and a firm footing from an already-known
position. That's a rather academic question, of interest to sextant
enthusiasts who wish to test their prowess. But it bears little relation to
the difficulties that would have been faced by a real mariner, in a rolling,
pitching, vessel, often doused with salt spray, with much of the sky
obscured by square sails, and when his corrections depended on measured
altitudes, not those deduced from a known position. We need to keep those
differences in mind.

My opinion of White's article
www.clockwk.com/lunars/ejwhite

1. George discusses at length the question,
what is &quot;pillar sextant&quot;.
I think it is reasonable to assume that this was
a &quot;pillar-frame&quot; sextant, typical for this manufacturer
(Troughton), rather than a column-mounted sextant.
White emphasises all the time that his experiments
are relevant for the sea use. It would be stupid or
dishonest to use a mounted sextant in such experiments:-)

2. Several things in White's article look very suspect
to me. First of all, what his &quot;observations&quot; really mean.
Are these individual shots or averages of series?
Notice: he records at most ONE &quot;observation&quot; per day.
(In fact, one per week, in the average).
While the normal practice at that time (and in our time!)
is to take series of several observations.
Then you can reduce/record each individual observation,
or the average, but you really DO several shots.
ALL manuals and authorities on the Lunars I know
recommend averaging 5-10 shots. All other observers I know
did this.
Taking a single lunar shot PER WEEK seems ridiculous to me
and contrary to the common practice.

Thus I think that his &quot;observations&quot; are in fact the averages
of series of shots. Though he never mentions this.

3. On page 90, White writes that the
&quot;greatest excentric error
of his sextant was 20 seconds.&quot; Of arc, of course.
Which is the maximum arc correction
from the certificate, I suppose.
And then on page 91, line 1 he says
&quot;The correction for excentricity have NOT BEEN APPLIED (!!!)&quot;
and then states a ridiculous reason for this.
Which means he NEGLECTED a known instrumental correction of
up to 20&quot;=0.3' for his sextant!
This correction is LARGER than the supposed typical accuracy
of his shots, see below:-)

4. Now about his results, as recorded. He obtains the
&quot;most probable error&quot; of his &quot;single observation&quot;
21 seconds of time which is roughly equivalent to 10.5&quot;
in distance or 0'.2 in distance.
I confirm this calculation from the data of his table.
But again as I wrote above, I have very strong doubts
that his &quot;single observation&quot; recorded in the table
is indeed a &quot;single shot&quot; rather than the average of
a series (which would be a normal practice).

5. How Frank comes with the &quot;mean error&quot; of 0'.1,
I don't know. But I cannot believe that Frank did what
George's letter suggests: averaged the errors
of observations taken in different weeks/months!
Remembering previous (sad) experience with this list, I don't
want to begin another discussion of statistics,
but let me shortly summarize what White and other
writers on the subject in XIX century do to derive
a single number characterizing the &quot;typical error&quot;
of a long array of observations.
(The procedure is explained in detail in Chauvenet).
They compute the &quot;most probable error&quot;.
The most probable error is defined (roughly speaking)
as such number that
1/2 of all observations have smaller error, and 1/2
have larger error.
That is White's results can be interpreted as follows:
of the 42 &quot;observations&quot; recorded, about 21
are likely to have the error at most 0'2 and the other
21 observations more than that.

Again, I write the word &quot;observations&quot; in quotation marks
because he never explains what one &quot;observation&quot; really
stands for, a single shot or an average of 10 shots.

6. The whole paper makes an impression on me that White's
approach is not &quot;scientific&quot;. (Unlike the approach
of the german author Bolte who wrote on the same
subject). By &quot;scientific approach&quot; I mean
&quot;searching the truth&quot; (whatever this truth can be).
On the other hand, White's purpose seems to be to
&quot;convince the seaman in the virtue of the Lunars method&quot;,
which is not exactly the same as unbiased search of
the truth. But this is only my personal impression from
reading his paper.

7. And finally I want to bring the following passage from
White to your attention:

&quot;As observations can be taken at sea with nearly
the same ease as on shore,...&quot;

Well, I am also mostly an armchair sailor,
but I would never say such thing:-)
My very limited sea experience completely contradicts
this opinion.
In a future message I will compare White's and other
observations from shore with observations made in the sea.

Alex.

This should be called an equatorially-mounted sextant.  With FRAS after

have used this term or something very similar.  This would lead me to
expect 'pillar sextant' to mean 'double-frame sextant'.

Alex, again, since I know you sometimes get very busy with work and don't
follow every message closely, I want to quote myself here on this issue of
&quot;novice experts&quot; as follows.

Just over a month ago (msg 3222), I wrote to Henry Halboth:
&quot;You say that the resulting longitude accuracy is &quot;astounding&quot;. I frequently
find the same thing, and I have seen interested beginners get amazing
results, too. Alex often gets annoyed when I say that beginners can get good
results, so it occurs to me that I should qualify this statement from now on
by noting that these are often people with excellent technical observing
skills in other fields. I don't grab people off the street and say, &quot;hey
kid, wanna find yer longitude?&quot; :-) They come to me with a natural interest
in arcane technical arts like navigation. They're often people with skill in
amateur astronomy or photography, for example. The sorts of people who can
align things through an eyepiece in any technical field can pick up a
sextant for the first time and get an excellent longitude right off the
bat.&quot;

This evening, I have other plans, so I can't reply at length to all these
interesting messages today, but I will definitely get back to you all
tomorrow.

George,
I will post a detailed reply tomorrow, but I have one question for you to
ponder. You mention that the phrase &quot;pillar sextant&quot; sometimes referred to a
sextant mounted on a stand. And I don't think that's true in the first
place. I haven't found a single case of this usage in the lit. Do you know
of one? As a corollary, is it possible that it's only you (and maybe a local
museum in Oxford which you mentioned once before) that refer to a sextant on
a stand as a &quot;pillar sextant&quot;? In the period, the term was used for the
well-known double-frame design, originally patented by Troughton. For
example, in Lecky's sextant buying suggestions, he writes, &quot;Give the
preference to a &quot;pillar&quot; sextant over one whose framework is cast all in one
piece&quot; (Lecky's Wrinkles in Practical Navigation, 1884, via Google Books).

An addendum:

White himself uses the term &quot;pillar sextant&quot;. But that doesn't necessarily
mean a sextant mounted on a pillar: He said it was a Troughton sextant of
the beginning of (his) century (i.e. the 19th). As Troughton is said to have
invented the &quot;pillar sextant&quot; (double frame sextant) in 1788 it is possible
that White was writing about such an instrument.

And there is a &quot;pillar sextant&quot; on a pillar in another local museum, the
Science museum in London, UK. Have a look at their web site:

I've split-off this threadname here, because this question is interesting
enough to deserve a topic on its own.

In the absence of a recognised International Naming Authority, names are
what people choose to call things by, and ambiguities and inconsistencies
abound. We have to interpret what people mean as best we can. That is why,
in doing my best to interpret White's mention of &quot;pillar-sextant&quot;, I
explained both possibilities. I then plumped for the &quot;sextant on a stand&quot;
option because of the context.

Frank Reed wrote-

These were rare-ish instruments, intended for use in special circumstances,
as I explained. I have seen only two examples. One was in the Museum of the
History of Science, in Oxford. [note in passing: this is what Frank referred
to as &quot;a local museum&quot;, and it is a museum, and it is local, but it happens
to house one of the World's great collections of scientific instruments,
with an international reputation]. It had been labelled there as a
pillar-sextant. That, of course, does not necessarily define its name. It
was what a museum curator chose to put on its label at the time it went on
display. He may have done considerable research beforehand, or none at all.
However, that name describes its construction rather nicely.

Jim Bennett wrote &quot;Dividing the Circle&quot;, before he became Director of the
MHS in Oxford, and in that he labelled a sextant with a doubled frame as a
&quot;pillar-sextant&quot;. I don't have that book at hand to consult it now. After
his appointment, I asked him, some years ago now, about the inconsistency in
that naming, compared with that of the museum instrument now in his charge.
He then replied that if he was writing it again, he would describe the
instrument in his book as a double-frame sextant. That name, also, would
describe its construction rather nicely; however, that doesn't make it an
official definition, either.

I have seen another example of the sextant-on-a-stand in the impressive
houseful of scientific instruments belonging to a wealthy and experienced
collector, who has since died. This was on a display shelf, beautifully
polished, but had remained for years in the folded-up state in which it had
been packed in its original transit box. Together, we unfolded it, and
turned the sextant the right way up (for the first time for many years, no
doubt), when its function became at once apparent. He didn't know what it
should be named, and until that moment, hadn't even recognised what it was
for.

I can't recall having seen such an instrument in a textbook, so if anyone
discovers such a reference, or a picture, I would be pleased to learn about
it. Perhaps they can be found in museum catalogues, if we can discover the
name they are listed under (which is the problem we're trying to solve). I
will consult a helpful expert at Greenwich. For our present purpose it would
be useful to consult a contemporary Troughton sales catalogue, if such a
thing exists. I will ask if it does.

So I return to Frank's comment &quot;I haven't found a single case of this usage
in the lit.&quot; . Does he know of ANY such reference in the literature to such
an adaptation of the sextant on a stand, under any other name, then? I would
like to discover more. There is no doubt such instruments existed, as I have
seen two of them. And we can deduce what they were probably intended for,
simply by looking hard at them. They could have been more common in that
nineteenth-century heyday of exploration.

As an example of the use of the word &quot;pillar-sextant&quot; to describe an
instrument with two thin frames, with spacers between, I have referred to
Jim Bennet's book, above, but can't quote, off-hand, any more, other than
Lecky, below. Most relevant would be references from before 1889, when White
wrote his paper. Can anyone help?

I was indeed aware of the use of the term &quot;pillar-sextant&quot;, in Lecky's
&quot;Wrinkles&quot;. Lecky was an advocate of the &quot;pillar-sextant&quot;, whatever he meant
by that term, but what he says could be read in two ways. Here are his
words, taken from my 19th edition of 1917.

&quot;... A 6 or 7-inch sextant is of course somewhat lighter to handle, but
sailors are not women; and a certain amount of weight gives steadiness,
especially in breezy weather. The writer's instrument is a 10-inch &quot;pillar&quot;,
by Troughton, divided on platinum.
The old recommendation was to give preference to a &quot;pillar&quot;sextant; in its
day it was without doubt THE correct thing, if only because the make was
confined to the very best instruments, and therefore a guarantee of good
workmanship.  But the world moves in, knowledge increases, good things are
superseded by better, so farewell to the &quot;pillar&quot;.

That left me undecided whether Lecky was boasting about his ability to
manage a the weight of a 10-inch sextant, which had been originally intended
for mounting on a pillar rather than held in the hand, or whether he was
saying that a 10-inch sextant built with two spaced thin frames was
therefore light enough to be hand-held. Both readings seemed plausible to
me.

Frank tells us-

|..        In the period, the term was used for the
| well-known double-frame design, originally patented by Troughton. For
| example, in Lecky's sextant buying suggestions, he writes, &quot;Give the

one
| piece&quot; (Lecky's Wrinkles in Practical Navigation, 1884, via Google Books).

Well from those words of Lecky's in that earlier edition, his meaning of the
term becomes quite clear. And if that design was patented by Troughton,
under the name &quot;pillar sextant&quot;, then White's meaning is also clear, and my
interpretation of his words was wrong.

===================

Thanks, Wolfgang, that's helpful. I now think it likely that White was
indeed referring to the handheld double-frame sextant.

Just a Minor niggle. The Whipple museum is in Cambridge, not Oxford, and in
view of the long-held enmity between those two institutions, it's important
to decide which is which. I am aware of the instrument at the Oxford museum;
is there one also in Cambridge?

Dear Frank,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Alex often gets annoyed when I say that beginners can get
">

The main disagreement we have on this matter
is not about &quot;novices&quot;. After all, my own very first Lunar
in my life (made shortly after I purchased my first sextant)
and posted on the list, was a PERFECT result.
There is no doubt that &quot;beginners CAN&quot;.
In the sense that &quot;some beginners sometimes can&quot;.

The main point as I understand it is that we evaluate
the same data very differently. We use different numbers
derived from the same series as indicators access &quot;accuracy&quot;.
If the &quot;average error&quot; of some long series of observations
(taken over the preiod of weeks or months, like in
the case of White) is say 0'2, then what does this tell you
about accuracy?
Very little, indeed.
In a real-life situation you don't want to risk a chance
of hitting some rocks with 5% probability, do you?

By the way, the measures like &quot;quadratic mean&quot; or
&quot;the most probable error&quot; are also poor measures of accuracy.
My recent analysis of White, Bolte and my own observations
shows that
a) distribution of errors is FAR from normal. Which means
that the usual measures of dispersion cannot be applied.
b) they are especially far from normal in their &quot;tails&quot;.
That is there are MORE LARGE ERRORS
than a normal distribution
would suggest.

Indeed, in the 42 observations of White, we have
one error of 0'.8 and 3 errors of about 0'.5
in the distance.

And I say that all available data contain a certain
substantial proportion of such outlayers.
You can call them blunders if you wish.

My 121 observations in spring 2007 are as good as White's.
They contain 13 individual shots with the error 0'.5,
2 shots with the error 0'.6 and one with the error 0'.8.

The error of the average is 0'.0.
The average error is 0'.2. If I believe
that this
0'.2 is a &quot;reliable indicator of accuracy&quot; and then
even multiply it by 2 &quot;for safety&quot;, I will
&quot;hit the rocks&quot; 18 times out of 120 !

My experience and all available data show that the errors
cwin the range 0.5 and more are UNAVOIDABLE,
and occur perhaps in 10%
of all observations.
This is the main point of our disagreement.

Alex.

P.S. Bolte, White and my own observations of last spring
are now posted on my web site under
http://www.math.purdue.edu/~eremenko/accuracy.html
I will soon add a digest of Bolte in English,
as well, as my own statistical analysis of
all these observations.

Ah yes - a double frame (pillar) sextant on a stand (pillar) - that
ought to clear things up!  :-)

I have a scientific antique dealer's catalogue here with a surveyor's
sextant described as a pillar sextant, so the term is clearly ambiguous.

Troughton's patent was issued in 1788.  If this is online or readily
accessible to someone in Britain at a patent records office, it would be
interesting to find out what name he used for it.

I always took the &quot;official&quot; name to be double-frame and pillar to be
the colloquial, but can't find anything in my books to support that notion.

A larger pupil exposes more of the cornea/lens to the light and allows
more opportunity for astigmatism to come into the image.  If you have
generally good vision but off-axis astigmatism, it is not noticeable
until the pupil is large.  Larger pupils can also reveal early cataracts
(they tend to start from the outside of the lens) that can mess up the
image.

These kinds of things start to show up in daylight for some folks who
start using various eye medications that cause pupil dilation (like some
glaucoma meds).

In the process of moving while trying to care for an aging mother hours
away, so please excuse my lack of specific detail. Frank pointed out an
excellent article in, if memory serves, Sky &amp; Telescope a while back that
dealt with corrective surgery, night eyeglass prescriptions, and the lack of
ability to resolve a point source as the eye night adapts. Please check the
archives and/or read the article.

Unless you are a submariner trying to distinguish a horizon in the dead of
night, I feel there is a strong case to be made for keeping the pupil small.
Some list members I have met personally find an IE check with a star very
difficult.  Ironically, night myopia appears to decrease with age. Some
texts (Bauer?) recommend popping out and and doing the observation so one
does not strain the eye. Unless absolutely necessary, I try to keep the
pupil as small as possible and get better results.

I would be hard pressed to make a case for depth of field being a factor for
a target that is, for all practical purposes, at infinity.

The Whipple Museum of the History of Science in Cambridge

(I most now be out of favour in that reputable institution having relocated
it to that other dreadful place)

possesses 2 sextants on pillar stands according to J.A. Bennett's &quot;Catalogue
3: Astronomy and navigation&quot;: Accession numbers 1295 (Troughton c. 1795,
pillar frame) and 821 (Ramsden c. 1795, double frame). That confirms my
suspicion that there are &quot;pillar sextants&quot; on pillars.
They also have reflecting circles on pillar stands (accession number 2123,
Troughton c. 1805 and accession number 1079, Troughton c. 1810).

I have already mentioned the instrument in the Science Museum.

Hill and Paget-Tomlinson, &quot;Instruments of Navigation&quot;, LOndon 1958,p. 39,
mention a sextant stand in the NMM (Shelf mark S. 65). The shelf mark must
have been changed in the meantime; Gloria Clifton should know.

There are two more sextants on pillars in the &quot;Museo Naval&quot; in Madrid (No.
inventario 1251 and 1322) according to López Calderon, Catálogo de la
sección de instrumentos náuticos y científicos del Museo Naval de Madrid,
Madrid 1996.

I suspect that there are some more in other European collections. I'll keep
you posted.

&quot;White refers at one point to Dudley Observatory. Is that the local
observatory in Melbourne, from where he made his observations? Does it still

I don't know, but he says he kept his sextant at his quarters and mostly
used it outside of work hours, so I assume that means he was actually making
his sextant observations from his home near the observatory.

And:
&quot;White uses a Troughton &quot;pillar-sextant&quot; from the early 1800s. That term has
been used elsewhere in two different contexts.&quot;

Just to reiterate, the term &quot;pillar sextant&quot; was ONLY used for the
double-frame instrument. Of course a sextant can also be mounted on a stand
and sometimes those stands were termed &quot;pillar stands&quot;. But a sextant on a
stand is NOT a &quot;pillar sextant&quot;. Obviously, this is confusing terminology
today, but it wasn't back then, and there is no evidence that White's
sextant was mounted on a stand.

And:
&quot;It's also interesting to note that he was taking lunar distances that
frequently exceeded 120 degrees, the greatest being just over 130.&quot;

You note that these are more difficult than shorter angles. That's true, but
they're only a little more difficult. They're certainly less fun, in my
personal opinion.

And:
&quot;The telescope on his sextant was mounted on a &quot;rising-piece&quot;, to alter its
spacing from the frame, while keeping it parallel, and White explains how he
used this to equalise the brightness of the images of the two bodies, so
that he never needed to change shades.&quot;

Yes, that struck me as excellent advice. Since most sextants today have the
same ability to slide the scope in and out from the frame, this is
definitely the way to go.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
And you wrote:
">

&quot;What I would like to question, however, is Frank Reed's treatment of
White's scatter in longitudes, in writing- &quot;If we take his lunars in sets of
four and average them (which I consider the best approach with lunars), the
results are generally within 0.1 minutes of arc. I would note that these
results are very similar to my own experience.&quot; &quot;
And followed by:
&quot;It seems to me that these are numbers that Alex would recognise as being
very similar in scatter to those that he reports from his own balcony. But
in grouping that set of four into one, and averaging, Frank has reduced them
to a mean error of 0.1', and in doing so he has discarded the baby with the
bathwater, and the relevant information on the real scatter has been quite
lost.&quot;

George, how is this 'throwing out the baby with the bathwater'? For a rather
long time, I have said that you can expect to get +/-0.25 minute of arc
accuracy (in a standard deviation sense) in lunars with a good sextant for
single observations, and that by averaging sets of four, you can expect
double that accuracy. This article confirms that, so what's the problem???

And:
&quot;As evidence, those details support Alex's view of achievable precision.&quot;

If Alex's view, which has been a moving target, matches what I have written
in the previous paragraph, then I guess we're all in agreement.

And, referring to E.J. White, you wrote:
&quot;Here is a professional astronomer&quot;

The fact that he is an astronomer is not particularly relevant except that
it means he is a very good judge of the sources of error in his
observations. The fact that he is a professional astronomer and enjoys
shooting lunars after work for relaxation does, however, tell us something
about his personality. :-)

Of his sextant, you wrote:
&quot;the best of its kind that existed (from the early 19th century)&quot;

Right. And this is a CRITICAL point. Accuracy in lunars depends far more on
the instrument than the observer. The sextant has to be high-quality and
properly adjusted. But for the hobbyist lunarians on this list, that would
seem to be the correct target. Also, in many ways, this is White's point. He
writes at length about the poor quality of many late 19th century sextants
(Lecky agrees with him). Of course, instruments only need to be sufficiently
accurate for the intended observations. Since almost no one at sea was
shooting lunars by this late date, the sextants only needed to be accurate
enough for standard time sights, meridian sights, etc. A couple of minutes
of arc error was no big deal for those observations.

And you added:
&quot;correcting carefully for his index error, and even the temperature.&quot;

It's always worth repeating that the index correction is the most important
observational limitation on accuracy in fine sights like lunars. You have to
get the I.C. correct first. As for temperature correction, well that's
hardly impressive. It was known and emphasized in all the manuals from the
earliest period that a navigator would get better results by correcting for
temperature, and it takes only a few extra steps to do so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
And you wrote:
">

&quot;And yet from one observation, to the next on another day, he records
differences of a large fraction of an arc-minute.&quot;

Large fraction? The standard deviation is 0.25 minutes of arc. Is that a
large fraction? This is an almost perfect match for my accounts of expected
lunar distance accuracy.

And:
&quot;In my view, it does not support Frank's contention, which I paraphrase,
perhaps unfairly, that he can pull in anyone from the street, present them
with a sextant to throw up, to achieve lunar distances to a tenth of a
minute.&quot;

Are you suggesting that I have stretched the truth? I know you wouldn't
question my intellectual integrity, so I would only say that I have indeed
done this, with the single caveat that I don't drag in random people and
force them to shoot lunars until I say they can leave. Naturally, only
people with an interest choose to participate, and these people often turns
out to be folks with interest and experience in other &quot;geeky&quot; optical
fields, like photography and backyard astronomy. And also just a reminder:
what I see is not &quot;tenth of a minute&quot; accuracy on individual sights, but
that level on sets of four averaged.

And:
&quot;Of course, these matters are relevant only to the question of the precision
achievable in measuring a lunar distance from on land, in perfect conditions
with precise instrumentation and a firm footing from an already-known
position. That's a rather academic question, of interest to sextant
enthusiasts who wish to test their prowess.&quot;

Very true.

And:
&quot;But it bears little relation to the difficulties that would have been faced
by a real mariner, in a rolling, pitching, vessel, often doused with salt
spray, with much of the sky obscured by square sails, and when his
corrections depended on measured altitudes, not those deduced from a known
position. We need to keep those differences in mind.&quot;

Yes, but we also need to be careful not over-emphasize those difficulties.
Historically, lunars were required perhaps once a week. That leaves plenty
of opportunity to wait for better weather. As for the sails obscuring the
sky, in fact, this is not a real issue. Spars and lines and other &quot;features&quot;
in the sky over your head (think branches and power lines on land) make it
easier to keep an eye on the Moon in daylight, which is when most lunars
were done. Once you've found the Moon, which can remarkably difficult even
when the Moon is bright, you note its position relative to the nearest spar
(or branch) and then you can get back to it easily whenever you want.
Finally, why do you think the observation of altitudes would consitute
another &quot;difficulty&quot;? Those navigators back then measured the altitudes for
lunar observations because it was EASY to do so and because measured
altitudes were generally LESS suspect than calculated altitudes.

&quot;1. George discusses at length the question, what is &quot;pillar sextant&quot;. I
think it is reasonable to assume that this was a &quot;pillar-frame&quot; sextant,
typical for this manufacturer (Troughton), rather than a column-mounted
sextant. White emphasises all the time that his experiments are relevant for
the sea use. It would be stupid or dishonest to use a mounted sextant in
such experiments:-)&quot;

Yep. And in addition, the expression &quot;pillar sextant&quot; did NOT refer to
sextants mounted on stands back then. The terminology is bound to be in flux
in the year 2007 since sextants like this have not been manufactured in
almost a hundred years, but certainly when White was writing, there would
have been no question.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Next, you wrote:
">

&quot;2. Several things in White's article look very suspect to me. First of all,
what his &quot;observations&quot; really mean. Are these individual shots or averages
of series? Notice: he records at most ONE &quot;observation&quot; per day.
(In fact, one per week, in the average). While the normal practice at that
time (and in our time!) is to take series of several observations.&quot;

I agree that there is no way to be certain on this point. However he says
nothing about averaging multiple sights (except at the end when he averages
the whole lot). Considering how carefully he has spelled out other details,
I think it's unlikely that he took multiple sights. Also notice his comment
about the possibility that he mis-read the clock on one of his observations.
Would that comment make sense if he had taken multiple observations? As for
&quot;normal practice at that time&quot;... there was no normal practice. Lunar
observations were long dead by 1887 when White was experimenting with them.
I see him as one of the earliest lunarian hobbyists. He would have loved the
Navigation List. :-)

And:
&quot;Taking a single lunar shot PER WEEK seems ridiculous to me
and contrary to the common practice.&quot;

See above. He was doing this for relaxation and his own amusement.

&quot;3. On page 90, White writes that the &quot;greatest excentric error of his
sextant was 20 seconds.&quot; Of arc, of course. Which is the maximum arc
correction from the certificate, I suppose. And then on page 91, line 1 he
says &quot;The correction for excentricity have NOT BEEN APPLIED (!!!)&quot; and then
states a ridiculous reason for this. Which means he NEGLECTED a known
instrumental correction of up to 20&quot;=0.3' for his sextant!&quot;

In a follow-up post, you decided that this wasn't so ridiculous after all,
and I agree with your logic there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
And you wrote:
">

&quot;This correction is LARGER than the supposed typical accuracy
of his shots...&quot;

Ah, but that correction is the maximum correction at only one point along
his sextant's arc. I propose that his arc error table would have read
something like this: 30d: 0&quot;, 60d: +10&quot;, 90d: 0&quot;, 120d: -20&quot;. It should
actually be possible to tease out the arc error from the sights that he has
listed. But assuming that the table has a form at least &quot;somewhat&quot; like the
one I've proposed, you can see that the error from ignoring arc error would
tend to cancel out if observations are taken over a wide range of angles, as
they are, and in many cases would be insignificant.

&quot;4. Now about his results, as recorded. He obtains the &quot;most probable error&quot;
of his &quot;single observation&quot; 21 seconds of time which is roughly equivalent
to 10.5&quot; in distance or 0'.2 in distance. I confirm this calculation from
the data of his table. But again as I wrote above, I have very strong doubts
that his &quot;single observation&quot; recorded in the table is indeed a &quot;single
shot&quot; rather than the average of a series (which would be a normal
practice).&quot;

The standard deviation is equivalent to about 0.25 minutes of arc in the
measured distance. As I said, I agree that there is at least the possibility
that these are averaged sights, but without evidence that this is ACTUALLY
the case, you're only speculating.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
And you wrote:
">

&quot;5. How Frank comes with the &quot;mean error&quot; of 0'.1, I don't know.&quot;

Take them in sets of four and average. Yes, this is a legitimate procedure
when each sight is individually cleared to yield a longitude.

I found your point &quot;6&quot; amusing. You seem to be saying that you don't trust
him because he writes plainly and without pseudo-academic pretense. Oddly
enough, I like him for that.

&quot;7. And finally I want to bring the following passage from White to your
attention:
&quot;As observations can be taken at sea with nearly
the same ease as on shore,...&quot;
Well, I am also mostly an armchair sailor, but I would never say such
thing:-) My very limited sea experience completely contradicts
this opinion.&quot; &quot;

You know, they do have calm days on the oceans, Alex. :-) I have no sea
experience at all. But to your point, we have only one list member who has
been both a professional navigator and a lunarian. That's Henry Halboth.
After getting a longitude accurate to within 6 miles from a lunar distance
observation, he recently wrote, &quot;I am not of the opinion that sea state has
a significant effect on the observer, unless a vibratory effect is present,
such as when a vessel be laboring or pounding, or when vibration is enduced
by operating machinery. It does seem usual for a vessel to have been eased
off or hove-to so as to provide more favorable conditions for observation.&quot;
...So that's ONE data point.

Finally, I would emphasize that lunars were widely used in the early
nineteenth century --so they MUST have been accurate &quot;enough&quot;, whatever
&quot;enough&quot; means. There is ample evidence for them in the logbooks. For those
of you who haven't looked at them, there are dozens of scanned logbooks from
the era available on the web site of Mystic Seaport:
http://www.mysticseaport.org/library/initiative/MsList.cfm
For fun, here is an example of a worked lunar from one of those logbooks:

Scroll down the page to see the scan. The calculation of the lunar
observation occupies the top third of the page. The rest of the page is an
unrelated tabulation of chronometer error.

&quot;White himself uses the term &quot;pillar sextant&quot;. But that doesn't necessarily
mean a sextant mounted on a pillar&quot;

In the period, the phrase &quot;pillar sextant&quot; was exclusively applied to those
double-frame instruments originally from Troughton's patented design. A
&quot;sextant on a pillar stand&quot; was called just that --not a pillar sextant.

&quot;a) distribution of errors is FAR from normal. Which means that the usual
measures of dispersion cannot be applied.
b) they are especially far from normal in their &quot;tails&quot;.
That is there are MORE LARGE ERRORS than a normal distribution would
suggest.
Indeed, in the 42 observations of White, we have one error of 0'.8 and 3
errors of about 0'.5 in the distance.&quot;

So you're saying these observations exhibit excess kurtosis (a leptokurtic
distribution is the fancy name for &quot;fat tails&quot;). I would in fact contend
that they show NO SUCH THING (not White's at least). Enter those values into
an Excel spreadsheet. Excel has nice built-in stat functions including
KURT(). Of course, you could use another stat package if you prefer. In
Excel, you'll have a column filled with the values from White's article:
-55, 11, 30, -35, ... -4, 37 (42 values in all). Then calculate the standard
deviation and kurtosis for that column (e.g. STDEV(A1:A42), KURT(A1:A42)).
You should find sd=30.6 and kurt=0.39. That is actually a rather low value
for kurtosis excess, and it's not statistically significant. In other words,
by the standard test, the data IS consistent with being drawn from a
standard normal distribution. No &quot;fat tails&quot;! If you change the largest
outlier in the dat from -96 to -88 (a very small change), then the kurtosis
excess is almost exactly zero --a near-perfect normal distribution.

But let's suppose you find that your observations of lunars DO show
significant kurtosis. Well, it's not the end of the world. There are
standard statistical procedures for dealing with these things. If you want
to do simulations, just to get a feel for the behvior, a very nice way to
model a distribution with significant kurtosis is to to create two normally
distributed random number generators with different standard deviations,
e.g. sd1=0.25, sd2=0.50. Then draw from the first distribution with
probability phi, e.g.=90%, and draw from the second with probability 1-phi.
And that will give you fat tails. Note that the real process does not have
to have this two-sided nature. It's just a good simulation technique.

It wouldn't. The idea is that the enlarged pupil uses a much bigger portion

And I see Michael Daly has already posted this much more detailed reply:
&quot;A larger pupil exposes more of the cornea/lens to the light and allows
more opportunity for astigmatism to come into the image.  If you have
generally good vision but off-axis astigmatism, it is not noticeable
until the pupil is large.  Larger pupils can also reveal early cataracts
(they tend to start from the outside of the lens) that can mess up the
image.

These kinds of things start to show up in daylight for some folks who
start using various eye medications that cause pupil dilation (like some
glaucoma meds).&quot;

Hi Alex + Frank,

In my previous postings I stated that I had taken a
number of Lunars at sea, in the South Atlantic, during
the late 1940s and early 1950s. Unfortunately, I have
been unable to find these observations amongst my
records, however, it is my recollection that results,
in terms of Longitude, were in the order of within
15-minutes of arc, as compared with my known positions
at the time of observation.

I used Borda's spherical method for clearing distances
but, as I previously pointed out, had and knew of no
then published tables of pre-calculated distances
against GMT - this necessitated that I calculate by
Great Circle methods the true distances to compare
with those cleared, all by hand calculation. This and
the simple fact that I had only 5-place logarithmic
tables left a greater window for error than I would
consider acceptable today.

There has recently been a considerable re-advancement,
as well as increased interest in the Lunar problem.
When I first became involved, most of my
contemporaries considered me a bit loony - no comments
please.

I appreciate that Alex's interest in Lunars seems to
be the accuracy of the angular measurement attainable
with the sextant, a matter of routine to me. I would
suggest to him that: 1) He equip his sextant with a
vertical handle, something which I long ago did to
ease the observation of horizontal angles in
coast-lining and position finding, and 2) For land
observations, consider mounting his sextant on a tilt
table or bracket atop a tripod, which allows
adjustment to a steady platform in the plane of the
observed distance.

Regards,

Henry

&gt; &gt; Finally, I would emphasize that lunars
&gt; &gt; were widely used in the early
&gt; &gt; nineteenth century --so they MUST
&gt; &gt; have been accurate &quot;enough&quot;, whatever
&gt; &gt; &quot;enough&quot; means.

&gt; For those British officials who made the longitude
&gt; prize &quot;enough&quot; was 1/2 degree in longitude if I
&gt; remember correctly.

&gt; &gt; There is ample evidence
&gt; &gt; for them in the logbooks.

&gt; Evidence of WHAT? That lunars were widely practiced?
&gt; Nobody seems to deny this.
&gt; Or that &quot;lunars can give you your position reliably
&gt; to 6 or to 15 miles&quot; ?

ans returned to this nomenclature question in several other postings,
pointing to a Google search for the term &quot;pillar sextant&quot;.

Frank bandies words such as &quot;certainly&quot;, and &quot;no question&quot;, but there can be
little certainty about whether an astronomer, taking measurements on land,
did or didn't use the term &quot;pillar sextant&quot; to abbreviate the phrase
&quot;sextant on a pillar stand&quot;. That would have been the natural instrument for
an astronomer to use for measuring lunar distances from on land, if it had
been available. It remains an open question, in my view. Unlike Frank, I
would claim no certainty, either way.

However, I am impressed with the power of Google to provide evidence on such
matters, and grateful to Frank for pointing out how to use it. It is, of
course, selective, being useful only for those works which have been
scanned, and in which the words have been transcribed by some form of OCR
software, but there seem to have been many such works now, rapidly
increasing. I now accept, from that evidence, that the general use of the
term &quot;pillar sextant &quot; was, indeed, to describe a double-frame instrument
rather than one mounted on a pillar. I'm quite happy to leave it at that.

=======================

I wrote the following, back in navlist 3547-

&quot;What I would like to question, however, is Frank Reed's treatment of
White's
scatter in longitudes, in writing- &quot;If we take his lunars in sets of four
and average them (which I consider the best approach with lunars), the
results are generally within 0.1 minutes of arc. I would note that these
results are very similar to my own experience.&quot;

Just take as an example the quoted longitude errors (in seconds of time) for
the first four of the 42 observations that White records, at four
widely-spaced dates in 1887. I have added a third column in which those
longitude errors are converted, roughly, to error in lunar distance.

Aug 27,   -55 sec , -0.46'
Sept 10,  +11 sec,  +0.09'
Oct 8,     +30 sec,  +0.25'
Nov 19,  -35 sec,  -0.29'

It seems to me that these are numbers that Alex would recognise as being
very similar in scatter to those that he reports from his own balcony. But
in grouping that set of four into one, and averaging, Frank has reduced them
to a mean error of 0.1', and in doing so he has discarded the baby with the
bathwater, and the relevant information on the real scatter has been quite
lost.

As evidence, those details support Alex's view of achievable precision. Here
is a professional astronomer, using gear with which he is thoroughly
familiar, the best of its kind that existed (from the early 19th century),
correcting carefully for his index error, and even the temperature. And yet
from one observation, to the next on another day, he records differences of
a large fraction of an arc-minute. In my view, it does not support Frank's
contention, which I paraphrase, perhaps unfairly, that he can pull in anyone
from the street, present them with a sextant to throw up, to achieve lunar
distances to a tenth of a minute.&quot;

To which Alex responded-

&quot;5. How Frank comes with the &quot;mean error&quot; of 0'.1,
I don't know. But I cannot believe that Frank did what
George's letter suggests: averaged the errors
of observations taken in different weeks/months!&quot;

But that is exactly what he did.
Frank has defended this practice, in 3653, in these terms-

&quot;George, how is this 'throwing out the baby with the bathwater'? For a
rather
long time, I have said that you can expect to get +/-0.25 minute of arc
accuracy (in a standard deviation sense) in lunars with a good sextant for
single observations, and that by averaging sets of four, you can expect
double that accuracy. This article confirms that, so what's the problem??? &quot;

and Alex comments, in 3665,

&quot;Averaging observations taken a week or more apart
has nothing to do with sea practice. Or even with
land travel. It only makes sense when you determine
longitude of a fixed observatory.&quot;

==================

And that's exactly the point. It depends on your purpose. Averaging groups
of observations, even those taken on different dates, makes good sense in
determiming the longitude of Melbourne observatory. In fact, the more
variety in the observations, in time-of-month, body-sighted, arc-region on
sextant, whatever, the more trustworthy the overall averaged result is
likely to be.

But if you are trying to demonstrate the observational SCATTER, it's absurd
to conflate readings taken on different dates, with different moon phases,
wildly differing arc readings. If there are scale errors in the sextant, if
there are prediction errors in the almanac, deficiencies in the clearing
process, that procedure will average them out, whereas to demonstrate
scatter, you need to show them up.

Nothing wrong with averaging lunars taken in groups of four or whatever, as
long as they have been taken together under similar conditions, and
constitute as a whole a single observation. These do not.

==================

In Frank's latest mailing, he defends his practice, saying-

| Take them in sets of four and average. Yes, this is a legitimate procedure
| when each sight is individually cleared to yield a longitude.

It's legitimate for yielding a longitude. It's illegitimate for
demonstrating scatter.

I had written-

That was completely missing the point. I was referring to SAILS, those big
white things that are dangled from the spars, blown by the wind to propel
the vessel along, and obscuring much of the sky, especially under square
rig. Not &quot;spars and lines and other &quot;features&quot;&quot;.

From on land, Frank may find that the local lamp-post may be a guide to
locating the Moon, but from a vessel at sea, especially in a sailing vessel,
those spars don't stay in the same place for long enough to fulfil that
purpose, except in a flat calm.

=========================

In the same posting he quibbled about my claim-

&quot;And yet from one observation, to the next on another day, he records
differences of a large fraction of an arc-minute.&quot;

replying

&quot;Large fraction? The standard deviation is 0.25 minutes of arc. Is that a
large fraction? This is an almost perfect match for my accounts of expected
lunar distance accuracy. &quot;

I had quoted the scatter in the first four observations, of White's 42, in
the third column, as-

Aug 27,   -55 sec , -0.46'
Sept 10,  +11 sec,  +0.09'
Oct 8,     +30 sec,  +0.25'
Nov 19,  -35 sec,  -0.29'

Differences of a large fraction of an arc minute. I rest my case.

&quot;Ridiculous&quot; seems like a rather strong word here. How many lunars do you
shoot per week, on average? In any case, the impression that I get from the
article is that White was simply entertaining himself by shooting lunars now
and then from his home (on a postman's holiday, he goes for a long walk...
on an astronomer's holiday, he shoots lunar distances?). White was like you
or me shooting backyard lunars. He did not set out to investigate the
accuracy of lunars, probably understanding very well that they were DECADES
obsolete for sea use. But at some point, when he pondered the accuracy that
he was able to achieve, White, like a number of other land-based lunarians
in the second half of the 19th century, decided to pen a &quot;letter to the
editor&quot; praising the virtues of lunars and bemoaning the fact that nobody
uses such onble observations at sea anymore.

And you replied:
&quot;Highly improbable. Especially on a good sextant.&quot;

Really? The arc error on a sextant could not have that pattern?? How &quot;highly
improbable&quot; would that be? Are you saying that if we looked through a few
dozen modern sextant certificates, we could never find one with a similar
pattern?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
And you wrote:

&quot;See Simms theoretical formula for the arc error.&quot;

The formula in Simms was one of the first attempts to deal with the issue of
arc error. But that particular theoretical formula (assuming we're talking
about the same one) applies to eccentricity only, literally out-of-centering
of the arc relative to the axis of the arm. But if the arc itself has error
in its milling, then that equation is not really relevant since two (or
more) sources of error are combined in a way that cannot be distinguished in
observational practice. In the end, you really have to just sit down and
measure the arc error at a number of well-spaced angles and make a little
table --just as we see with 20th century sextant certificates.

&quot;You misunderstood what I said. I did not say anything of the language. I

to find what the truth is. For example, to evaluate the lunar method
accuracy. And another approach: to convince people in something which you
already know or believe. To promote some agenda.&quot;

Thanks, I can see better what you meant now. But people always have agendas.
No one studies at random. And more specifically, no one studies the accuracy
of a practical art like celestial navigation UNLESS they have some practical
reason, some agenda. Incidentally, my German is too poor to read the details
in the paper by Bolte. Why was he conducting such a study at a point in time
when lunars were obsolete (at sea)? Was he tasked to do this by some higher
authority? Was it his own idea? What was his agenda?

I had written earlier
&quot;There is ample evidence for them [lunar observations] in the logbooks.&quot;

And you asked:
&quot;Evidence of WHAT? That lunars were widely practiced? Nobody seems to deny
this. Or that &quot;lunars can give you your position reliably to 6 or to 15

Evidence of actual practice --that's the key to it all: if you want to
understand the history of navigation, then go to primary source documents.
And maybe evidence of accuracy, too, if you can puzzle it out. Go to the
logbooks, the newspapers, the letters written at the time (though I am
writing this directly to you, I do not mean it as instruction to you, just
so we're clear, I am just speaking of general philosophy here). The
experiments that you or I do today have some relevance to lunar observations
practiced historically, but only &quot;some&quot;. There were so many variables in
play that the observational limit of a modern observer with a modern sextant
really only tells us about modern observers with modern sextants.

Of course, modern observers using modern sextants to shoot lunars are
relevant to other issues. Lunars are a good way to test our skills and test
our sextants and even have a bit of fun. And you might even use them in a
sailing race where celestial navigation gets you a little handicap on time.
Take lunars, and win the Bermuda Race! How's that for an agenda?? :-)

I wrote earlier:
&quot;So you're saying these observations exhibit excess kurtosis &quot;

And you replied:
&quot;Let us stick to simple language:-)&quot;

Well, you said that the distribution of the observations has more weight in
the tails than a common normal distribution. Apart from the very colloquial
&quot;fat tailed distribution&quot;, the only name for this is kurtosis. I certainly
agree with you that it is something that you should worry about when you're
dealing with distributions of real-world data. Almost all data which is said
to be approximately normally distributed does, in fact, show some kurtosis
if you study it long enough. This is responsible for all sorts of crazy
misunderstandings in divers fields. For example, if you were to study price
changes in currency exchange rates, you could easily calculate a standard
deviation, and based on that you might predict that the odds of a three
standard deviation move are something like 300-to-1 against. But if you then
look at the data again and COUNT the number of moves of that size
historically, you discover that the odds of a large move are considerably
larger. In other words, outliers are much more common than a normal
distribution would suggest. A currency trader who ignores this fact can get
into some mighty serious trouble (have a look at a brief article called
&quot;Kurtosis Risk&quot; on Wikipedia for another take on this). For the navigator,
the same issue can arise. If results tend to cluster near a mean, you still
should worry that there may be some aspect of your observations, or your
sextant's behavior, or the nature of the observation itself, that leads to a
greater than expected number of outlying points. BUT, and this is a BIG BUT,
it is fairly easy to imagine that there are more outliers than normal when
you worry about them too much. The only RELIABLE measure is a direct
calculation of the sample kurtosis, and fortunately, most modern
spreadsheets can do this easily. If it's not significantly above zero
('significantly' has to be defined), then you cannot claim that the
distribution has &quot;fat tails&quot;. White's observations do NOT show significant
kurtosis.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&quot;Enter those values into an Excel spreadsheet.&quot;

And you replied:
&quot;I did! And wrote about this to the list 4 (four) times. Are my messages get

www.math.purdue.edu/~eremenko/accuracy.html &quot;

No, Alex, your messages are not getting &quot;lost&quot;. Let's not go through that
again. You can easily check to see if your messages are distributing by
looking for them in the list archive at http://www.fer3.com/arc . And yes, I
did look at your bar graphs. Thanks for making them.

Also, please note that I spelled out detailed instructions because in any
conversation on this list, even if it seems that it is a conversation
between two people, there are often other people reading along, other people
who may want to participate, so in general, I try to give instructions &quot;as
if&quot; the other person is not 100% familiar with what we're discussing. So,
YES, I know you had already entered the data in a spreadsheet. But I also
note that your web page does not include any values for standard deviation
or kurtosis

And then you asked:
&quot;Look at these error distributions. If you do not want to look at other
results out of principle, look at White's results plotted. And then tell us:
on your opinion, does this plot confirm that &quot;one can measure a distance
with 0'2 accuracy, reliably&quot;.&quot;

White's observations show a standard deviation on individual observations
(which may be multiple actual sights or may be single sights) of 0.25
minutes of arc. And if ew average sets of four, the s.d. drops to about 0.1
minutes of arc. That means that about 68% will lie within one standard
deviation of zero error. Whether that fits your definition of the word
&quot;reliably&quot; is up to you. White's observations also show no significant
kurtosis. There are no &quot;extra&quot; outliers, no evidece of a non-normal sample.

Of course, at some point there almost have to be highly non-normal outliers
in sextant observations. So-called &quot;blunders&quot;, like writing down 20 degrees
for 30 degrees, count as errors but the odds against them would be
millions-to-one (or worse!) if we believed all recorded sextant observations
obeyed a true normal distribution. So as I said at the top, I agree with you
that we should be on the lookout for outliers. This applies to all celestial
navigation, whether it's Noon Sun latitudes or intercepts for LOPs or time
sights. There's nothing special about lunars on this score.

In another post, replying to Henry, you wrote:
&quot;This I consider a violation of the rules:-) If one chooses this way, then
why not to use

Well, because some people shoot lunars for other reasons, and I think this
is worth remembering. For a long time, I thought that you personally, Alex,
were shooting lunars because you wanted to determine the arc error of your
instrument. If that's the case --and it is for some people who play this
&quot;game&quot;-- then mounting the instrument on a stand (maybe an old telescope
mount with a clock drive) and attaching a more powerful telescope to the
sextant might very well count as &quot;playing by the rules&quot;.

nice, and sail us around the world for a year so we can get some good hard

Hmmmm. What are you talking about??? The point of averaging four in a row is
not to DEMONSTRATE observational scatter. It is to reduce it. IF you have a
known observing location or locations (a given here), with a late 19th
century or later almanac (which White obviously had), and an accurate
clearing process (there are plenty, but White used Chauvenet, which is
excellent), THEN, apart from arc error (which White reports was small),
there is no difference in averaging observations made ten minutes apart from
observations made ten days apart. Note that there IS a small difference when
the observations are just a minute or two apart since, in the latter case,
you can average the angles and then do the clearing. If the observations are
more than a few minutes apart, you have to do the clearing and then average
the results.

any non-speculative sources that worry about the sails getting in the way?
Was the navigator (frequently the captain, generally an officer) immobile
and forbidden from moving to a new spot where he could shoot lunars? Even

the dreaded sails obscuring the sky is a case where you are imagining

I never do just a single shot. If I go into the

problem from the accuracy of determination of longitude
of a fixed observatory. Do let us distinguish these
two problems, and call them Problem A and Problem B,
for simplicity.

I say that in Problem A, averaging observations taken
over long time period is meaningless.
In Problem B it is meaningful, as well as the use
of tripods and other mountings.

It is clear that given long enough time, the accuracy
achievable in Problem B will be much higher than that
in Problem A.

Not always. Politicians have agendas. Unfortunately,
many people who say that they do &quot;scientific research&quot;
also do. I don't want to discuss this much.
But real scientists (on my opinion) have QUESTIONS,
not agendas. They ask themselves a question.
And then try to find the true answer to it.

This is somewhat different from havin an agenda and
trying to push it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Incidentally, my German is too poor to read the details
&gt; in the paper by Bolte. Why was he conducting such a study
">

My German is also poor, but I tried to do my best,
and have some general impression
of what is going on in the paper. (Jan Kalivoda also
added some explanation, but I think I was able to understand
most of the paper myself, except perhaps some very small
details).

He does not say
whether he is a professional sailor, a navy oficer,
a scientist or just an amator. I have his other paper,
(a large one, almost a little book)
of more theoretical nature where he discusses at length
the known methods of chronometer correction at sea,
with long and comprehensive explanation of Lunars,
with tables etc. Chauvenet style. I can post this too.
He calls himself
&quot;Doctor F. Bolte of Hamburg&quot;, so probably he is not a
Navy oficer. I would guess he was a professor in some
Naval academy. The observations
were taken during his
voyages &quot;to Australia (1886-7) and Western South America
(1887-8). That's all he says.
He wanted to investigate the &quot;Accuracy of CelNav
observations at sea&quot;, this is how his paper is titled.
Lunars is only a small chapter (last chapter) in the paper.
He used dead reconing and chronometer observations.
As I understand, chronometer(s) were carefully tested before
and after the voyage, and the correction interpolated.
He investigates:
a) Latitude from Polar star
b) Latitude from Meridian observation of two stars, one
in the South and one in the North of the meridian.
c) Latitude from two altitudes and difference in hour angle.
d) Longitude from heights of two stars near East and West
verticals
e) Chronometer correction from Lunar distances.

In this particular discussion my goal is more modest.
To understand the accuracy of the method of Lunar distances.
I don't see how the primary cource documents you

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's the question: how to puzzle it out.
Besides I have no access to these documents, and no time
to get involved really seriously.
(Besides, the topic looks too exotic to me for a serious
research:
even in this list at most 2-3 people seem to be interested
in the accuracy of sextant measurements of distances).
That's why I am mostly looking
at secondary sources: research already done on this
question and my own experiments:-)
Unfortunately very little previous research seems to be
available: I have only White and Bolte.

Frank,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &quot;So you're saying these observations
&gt; exhibit excess kurtosis &quot;
">

Frank. I really don't want to discuss theoretical
questions of statistics on this list.
I think the plots of distributions of errors tell
EVERYTHING to anyone who cares to look at them.
While trying to characterize the error with a single
number (error of the average, average error, sigma,
most probable error, median error, whatever) is
somewhat misleading.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Alex, your messages are not getting &quot;lost&quot;.
">

Good. So you saw the plots of distributions.
These plots tell you everyhting I have to say
(and everything I know) about
Lunars accuracy. If you disagree with this, then tell
me what exactly is the point of disagreement.
a) You think these plots are somehow not typical and
DO NOT reflect the real accuracy of the lunar distance
observations (from sea and land, with a hand held sextant,
by an observer with experience)?
Or
b) you agree that these distributions are sort of typical,
and really show what can be practically achieved?
And in this last case (b), the only disagreement is how
to derive a SINGLE number from these distributions,
the number which characterizes the accuracy?

If we are in situation (a) please give me a reference
for better data.

If we are in situation (b), let me state two rough
conclusions from these plots:
1. Observations at sea a substantially less accurate
than those on land.
2. Even on land, under good conditions,
errors of up to 0'5 in a single distance
shot are unavoidable, and occur in about 1/10 of all
shots.

These are the conclusions I make from these graphs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; For a long time, I thought that you personally, Alex,
&gt; were shooting lunars because
&gt; you wanted to determine the arc error of your
&gt; instrument.
">

For this I was shooting star distances.
I have to say that I failed to determine any arc error
of the instrument. Freiberger and
Cassnes Plath independently issued certificates that say
that my instrument has no perceptible error.
So in my Lunars I assume this (as White did:-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &quot;game&quot;-- then mounting the instrument on a stand
">

Lunars is a poor method of determining arc error.
Because there are only few distances that you can
shoot on any given night. And for arc error, it is desirable
that all shots are made under the same conditions,
with index error unchanged etc.

Years ago, one list member (George perhaps?) challenged
us by asking whether anyone succeeded in determining
the arc error of his (modern) sextant himself, by distances
or any other observations.
No one responded to this challenge. I tried and failed.
But perhaps my sextant really does not have any
perceptible arc error.

There was a fellow with the U.S. Navy who explored accuracy of
standard sights in 1960 or so, testing various sextants and
telescopes.  Unfortunately, I don't recall much more detail.  His
paper was referenced here in 2005 or so, and Joel ____ commented on
his paper. Joel is the guy involved with Tamaya sextants, who I
believe had the Land and Sea online sextant store, who stopped
posting here about a year ago.

I had written-

| &quot;but there can be little certainty about whether an astronomer, taking
| measurements on land,  did or didn't use the term &quot;pillar sextant&quot; to
| abbreviate the phrase &quot;sextant on a pillar stand&quot;. That would have been
the
| natural instrument for an astronomer to use for measuring lunar distances
| from on land, if it had been available. It remains an open question, in my
| view. Unlike Frank, I would claim no certainty, either way.&quot;

about which Frank made some disparaging comments

and I continued-

| &quot;I now accept, from that evidence, that the general use of the term
&quot;pillar
| sextant &quot; was, indeed, to describe a double-frame instrument rather than
one
| mounted on a pillar. I'm quite happy to leave it at that.&quot;

To which Frank replied-

| OK, so why did you deny it in the previous paragraph?

I didn't, as he will discover if he reads it again.

==========================

I had argued against Frank's procedure, which was-

| &quot;If we take his lunars in sets of four and average them (which I consider
| the best approach with lunars), the results are generally within 0.1
minutes
| of arc. I would note that these results are very similar to my own
| experience.&quot;

And I replied-

| &quot;But if you are trying to demonstrate the observational SCATTER, it's
absurd
| to conflate readings taken on different dates, with different moon phases,
| wildly differing arc readings. If there are scale errors in the sextant,
if
| there are prediction errors in the almanac, deficiencies in the clearing
| process, that procedure will average them out, whereas to demonstrate
| scatter, you need to show them up.&quot;

Frank responded-

| Hmmmm. What are you talking about??? The point of averaging four in a row
is
| not to DEMONSTRATE observational scatter. It is to reduce it. IF you have
a
| known observing location or locations (a given here), with a late 19th
| century or later almanac (which White obviously had), and an accurate
| clearing process (there are plenty, but White used Chauvenet, which is
| excellent), THEN, apart from arc error (which White reports was small),
| there is no difference in averaging observations made ten minutes apart
from
| observations made ten days apart. Note that there IS a small difference
when
| the observations are just a minute or two apart since, in the latter case,
| you can average the angles and then do the clearing. If the observations
are
| more than a few minutes apart, you have to do the clearing and then
average
| the results.

Frank's averaging procedure works for determining longitude. But not for
demonstrating scatter, which is what we are all trying to examine. Frank's
arguments are valid only if there are no systematic or other differences
that cause lunar distance observations, taken under very different
conditions, to yield different answers. But that is the very question that
we are investigating, and seeking evidence for, isn't it? That certainly
seems to be Alex's aim, in a long and systematic series of observations,
closely parallel to White's, which are worth taking very seriously, and
perhaps publishing.

============================

I had pointed out that an observation taken on land &quot;bears little relation
to
the difficulties that would have been faced by a real mariner, in a rolling,
pitching, vessel, often doused with salt spray, with much of the sky
obscured by square sails&quot;

For some reason, Frank took exception to that, pointing out how useful in
locating the Moon in the sky &quot;spars and lines and other &quot;features&quot; could be;
a dubious claim at sea.

and I replied-

| &quot;That was completely missing the point. I was referring to SAILS, those
big
| white things that are dangled from the spars, blown by the wind to propel
| the vessel along, and obscuring much of the sky, especially under square
| rig. Not &quot;spars and lines and other &quot;features&quot;&quot;.&quot;
|
| Ahhh, SAILS! Yes, terrible nuisance. When we read the old logbooks and
| navigation manuals, they go on endlessly about the sails interfering with
| lunar distance sights. Hey... Wait a minute. Do they?? :-) Do you know of
| any non-speculative sources that worry about the sails getting in the way?
| Was the navigator (frequently the captain, generally an officer) immobile
| and forbidden from moving to a new spot where he could shoot lunars? Even
| that famous chef aboard Cleopatra's Barge in 1817 seemingly had no trouble
| with those darn sails getting in the way. George, this concern you have
over
| the dreaded sails obscuring the sky is a case where you are imagining
| difficulties.

Very scathing. I wonder, when Frank walks in the woods and treads in some
bearshit, whether he seeks documentary reference that that is what bears do,
before wiping it off his shoe. To Frank, it seems that if he can't find it
in Google, then it didn't happen. Nobody but Frank could ask for documentary
evidence that the sails got in the way of the sky. Of course nobody
mentioned that in their journals. It was a fact of life, that went with
trying to do celestial navigation on a square-rigged vessel.

Normally, navigation was done from the quarterdeck, where the motion and the
spray were least, where the ship's clock was within call, as was the cabin
lamp to read the sextant. But from there, the visibility was badly effected
by the sails, depending on whereabouts in the sky you needed to be looking.
It was worse on a ship-rigged vessel than on a bark. It was worse when the
sky-objects happened to be to leeward, or forward, rather than to windward,
or aft. It was worse when observing a lunar distance, requiring a clear view
of two objects at once (the entire space between those objects didn't need
to be clear), than when observing an altitude up from the horizon.

Yes, of course, the navigator had to find a spot wherever he could on deck,
where he could get a view, which might mean leaving the poop to go forward,
and accepting more motion and spray, sometimes water swilling around the
deck, animals and fowls in their pens, deckwork going on. And even then, to
take a lunar might require asking permission of the captain for a change of
ship's course, or the raising of a corner of the forecourse, or taking in a
foretopmast staysail, to give him the view that he needed. Depending on the
captain, and the conditions at the time, that's a permission he might ot
might not get.

Obscuring of sky by sails is just one of factors I listed, that make lunar
distances harder for mariners at sea, and relatively easy for observers on
land.

To my sorrow, I've never travelled on a square-rig vessel under sail; and I
wonder whether Frank Reed has.

:==========================

In Navlist 3547, I had referred to a professional astronomer
&quot;from one observation, to the next on another day, he records differences of
a large fraction of an arc-minute.&quot;

and listed the first four, out of the sequence of 42, which were-
-0.46' ... +0.09' ... +0.25' ... -0.29'

to which Frank quibbled-

| &quot;Large fraction? The standard deviation is 0.25 minutes of arc. Is that a
| large fraction? This is an almost perfect match for my accounts of
expected
| lunar distance accuracy.&quot;

And when I restated those numbers, with
&quot;Differences of a large fraction of an arc minute. I rest my case.&quot;

| So then what exactly WAS your case?? The observations show a standard
| deviation of 0.25 minutes of arc. You do understand, don't you, that this
| statement is consistent with the small subset of data you listed, right?
One
| can always &quot;cherry pick&quot; outliers from any sample.

I didn't mention, or question, any standard deviation. I said what I said,
and Frank objected to those words. He may put some other interpretation on
those numbers, but the rest of us can see that they clearly show differences
of a large fraction of an arc minute, exactly as I said. And they were not
&quot;cherry-picked outliers&quot;. They just happened to be the first numbers in
White's list, out of 42.

Arthur Pearson posted to this list in January or Febrary, 2003, the
results of some sea observations of lunars compared to GPS or
chronometer/radio time.  His conclusion was that they were accurate
to about 30' of longitude, if I recall correctly.  The observations
were made from a small yacht, which would be a more difficult
platform for observation than a ship.  The sails and rigging did get
in the way, if I recall correctly.

&quot;

The lunar was taken in the very rolly anchorage behind the reef. Not
open ocean, but definitely a lot of motion.  The moon happened to be
nearing its highest point, providing several challenges.  It was very
difficult to get the sun over to the moon, and the high altitude made
for a very awkward posture when I did. This sight was a prolonged
struggle; I tried several postures but found nothing comfortable.
...
All in all, I am pleased with how well it came out given
the difficulties.

With such good information as to author and date it took less than 30
seconds to find this at:
http://www.fer3.com/arc/

It took longer to read the message. Nothing about sails (well, Arthur was at
anchor at the time) and this seems to have been the conclusion:
&quot;

I felt I got a good look at a couple
of the contacts but struggled with the others.  The graph of the
observations is more consistent than I would have guessed although I ended
up pretty far off.  I would guess that had I worked the longitude as I did
with the first set, I'd be off by over 80 miles. Practice, practice,
practice... I suppose I'll just have to spend more time in the
Caribbean!
