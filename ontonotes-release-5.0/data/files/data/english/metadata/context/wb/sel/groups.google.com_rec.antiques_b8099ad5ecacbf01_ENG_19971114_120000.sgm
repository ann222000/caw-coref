Could any one help with the following.

I have two boxes both about 17&quot; X 11&quot; (H W ) made of wood. One has a
highly decorated front with inlayed flowers of a lighter wood on a
Mahogany backing. The other is plainer with cross banding around the
edges. Both have front opening doors and are set on small plibths. They
seem to resemble pictures that I have seen of Tabernacle boxes, both
have flat tops with a decorative edges. One box has a solid back and the
other has a vented back. They are too small to be used as potty
cupboards, and both have centre shelf.They are circa 1900. Could any one
offer an opinion as to what they might have been ussed for. Also if they
are not as I think Tabernacle boxes could anyone tell what a Tabernacle
box was used for.

I'm not sure that I have an answer for you,but, are your boxes on
'plibths' OR are they on 'plinths'? Or what ?

"/> Yes Kris you paged. Not being Jewish and coming from a country that
has an extremely small Jewish population, &quot;Judaica&quot; wouldn't be top of
my list.

I thought a Tabernacle was (originally of course in Bibical times) a
tented complex (of the ancient Temple of Jerusalem) comprising two
rooms &quot;the holy place&quot; and &quot;the most holy place&quot; (Holy of Holies) and
inside the inner room (Holy of Holies) rested the Ark of the Covenant,
which was an ornate, gold-plated wooden chest that in biblical times
housed the two tablets of the Law given to Moses by God.

In today's Jewish synagogues, an ornate cabinet (ark of the Law,
which is made in the image of Moses' ark of the Covenant) enshrines
the sacred Torah scrolls used for public worship. Because it
symbolizes the Holy of Holies of the ancient Temple of Jerusalem, it
is the holiest place in the synagogue and the focal point of prayer.
Having said all that, - most of this is drawn from something I read a
long time ago, but I would imagine these boxes, arks or cabinets
(especially 19th century or early 20th century) would be pretty ornate
and richly decorative articles. The boxes or cabinets Barry describes
in his post sound a bit ordinary and Anglo with the floral inlay and
crossbanding, doesn't sound too Jewish to me.

"/> Thanks, Ronnie (you did well)

Obviously, my exposure to a large Mormon population
(who do have tabernacles) had me befuddled. ;)

Thanks - Kris
