gelfoam effect - - clot is shrinking - lower third molar , pending dry socket ?
</HEADLINE>

Post extraction had distinct clot for 35 hours, follwed all
instructions religiously. at 45 hours, despite careful avoidance of
disturbance, clot has lost 30% of  surface diameter, shrunk. At 55
hours, what remains of the clot is a tiny center in a white setting.
No pain at this point.  There is really no cavity, as the gelfoam
fills it completely.

Q: Is the normal outcome that the gelfoam itself "becomes" the clot,
since it is filling the aveola completely ?

Q2: Even postoperatively, after the 30 min, gauze compression period,
the bloodclot was never very high, i.e. though broader, it was at most
2 mm above the gelfoam surface I see now.

Q3: Dry socket is described in the literature as "grey bone is
visible".  When I shine a strong LED light on the area, the aevolar
bone mesially surrounding the area seems white, same color as the
gelfoam? Bucally the stitches are visiable.

Q4: In normal outcome, how long does the clot persist? My remaining
clot is at most 1/8 the size of the socket, sitting in the center.

Q5: Will the gelfoam dissolve, and does the dry socket start then ?
I.e. goes gelfoam delay dry socket complaints
onset (normal is 3-5 days) ?

This was an uneventful extraction under use of gelfoam/tetracycline,
with pre-extraction cl.hexidine flush,
post extraction twice daily, soft syringe irrigation after meals. (2
soups w. inclined head, 2 swallowed soft scrambled eggs)  As my oral
tissue does either not absorb anesthetic well, or the vascul. removes
it too rapidly,  we did use additional shots, (mandible block and
prob. local) with 1 :100,000 epinephrine, which does put me in dry
socket risk category due to additional vasoconstriction.

Comments appreciated, am in the lifesciences myself, ..had upper ones
out, faintly remember a larger, longer
lasting clot. 51 year old male, non smoker, teetoaler, not under any
medication, no spitting, straw use.

When you pack gelfoam into a bleeding socket, it absorbs the blood and acts
as a framework for the clot to be established.  In my experience, once it
has soaked up the blood (which happens before you leave the office), you
can't actually see the gelfoam anymore (it becomes part of the clot), and
certainly not over 50 hours later.  All you see is the clot at this point.
What you are likely seeing now is granulation tissue (ie. gums and tissue
growing into the area) filling in the socket area at the clot diminishes in
size.

Keep in mind that granulation tissue in the mouth appears whitish/grey in
colour...not pink.  Without seeing you, I would be surprised if the white
you see mesially is actually bone.  More likely the white tissue mesially is
just granulation tissue.

Sounds like granulation tissue is filling in from the outer parts of the
socket and replacing the clot.  This is normal healing.  Length of time for
the clot does not matter...it could take a few days or a few weeks to
dissipate.

Gelfoam dissolves on its own....As I said, at this point, you can't tell the
gelfoam from the clot as its all mixed together.

It sounds like you are doing everything possible to prevent a dry socket.
However, it may still occur.  If you begin having significant pain 3-5 days
from the surgery that is poorly controlled with analgesics, you must see
your surgeon.

Of course, if you have any concerns...see or telephone your surgeon.

Thanks John, eerie situation re granulation tissue: On day two the
clot was a tiny red center, now,
day three, it has completely disappeared. In place of the molar sits
now what looks like a child''s tooth,
with just a few motile brownish, red fibers in the center. Because
this was an erupted tooth, with aveolar bone loss surrounding the
root, the actual socket was only 1/2 centimeter deep on radiograph.
There is no concave structure now, its convex, followed by white
material distally. Given that granulation has a lots of intermediate
stages, its hard for me to believe that is is vascularized tissue
already..hope you ar e right, though.

It is annoying that almost all oral surgery textbooks on web and pub
med studies I sampled disscuss dry socket as a "empty container" when
in clinical practice use of gelfoam is standard. So, if no real clot
ever forms or persists, one would still be looking at a piece of white
gelfoam, in line with margins of aveolum, right ?

IME, gelfoam soaks up blood rapidly and is blood red in a few moments.

Gelfoam does not adhere to the walls of the socket.  If the clot does
not form properly and adhere to the tissue, it is very likely that the
mal-formed clot and the gelfoam will be both lost from the socket and
there will be an empty hole.  Gelfoam also dissolves in just a few days.

In any case you will not see white gelfoam left behind.

So, if no real clot

No, and I don't believe John said that.  Gelatin is quite soluble, and
generally acts as a nexus for clot formation.  The gelfoam itself is
very friable and will generally not be visible by the next day or so.
Likewise the clot will largely be covered by fibrinous exudate, and so
will not look like blood, but a rather heterogeneous, irregularly
whitish/brownish mass.  Yes, this clot is invaded fairly quickly by
fibroblasts and other elements of granulation tissue, which is in turn
more gradually replaced by more mature connective tissue elements and
bone.  While this is happening, the epithelium of the oral mucosa will
advance and cover the socket.  You may or may not see evidence of the
actual alveolus.  I don't recommend you pick around in there.  If there
is a sharp edge of bone apparent a couple of weeks later, there's a good
chance it may sequester off and be lost.  After a couple of weeks if
there is pain and obvious bone showing above the edge of the extraction
socket I'd return to the dentist; it may be necessary to remove some
exposed bone (which sounds traumatic but is generally painless).

Thx to all, well, today and tomorrow (day 4-5) is the literature
consensus of
appearance of dry socket pain. Right now, there is a convex pure white
structure with
a 3mm concave spot in the center. - I'm not picking around in there,
thx, but during
the post-meal irrigation it can be observed well.

&gt; Nope.
&gt; What is seen at this point in healing is the fibrin clot.
&gt; Granulation tissue forms when the revascularization starts.
&gt; Generally 7-10 days or longer.

I agree with you that the blood clot is replaced by the fibrin plug prior to
vascularization.  However, granulation tissue, by definition is tissue
filled with immature capillaries and fibroblasts.  This is likely already
present at the very margins of the wound.

Why are you worried ,no pain no problem, problems occur ,ie dry socket 2-5
days post op most usually.

&gt; What you are seeing is a fibrin clot.
&gt; Just like a scab on skin, only the red blood cells wash out
&gt; in a moist environment.

&gt; Gelfoam only acts as a substrate (lattice) for the clot to form.
&gt; Don't fool with the area, the body knows how to heal itself.

Re : worried -
I'm candidate for dry socket as I had additional shots, left side of
face including upper temple were still numb
3 hours later. The vasoconstriction restricted inflow of blood to
area, result is likely weak plug.

Current status: day 5, the gelfoam socket, (it is gelfoam, not tissue)
has opened a 3 mm foramen in the center, one can see 2 mm deep. The
mesial/buccal sides are squeezed together by a self-disolving stitch.
The entire site has
sunk (gelfoam was debrided during swallowing and chewing), proximal
portion is now in shadow of 2nd molar where it previously was visible.
The onset of dry socket may be later here because by fasting the first
30 hours the site remained closed, food particles are only entering
now. The etiology does require some irritation of the bone by saliva
or particles. So far there is no smell or pain, but the air pressure
from a non-suppressed cough triggered the nerve,
would that happen on day four of a vascularized plug ?

Thanks for all the responses - Vylgol paste at the ready !
Cheers, Jim.

Grey is usually the clot breaking going through normal process of
fibrinogenesis.  If concerned, have your surgeon look at it.
