&quot;O Srimati Radhika! O Supreme Goddess! O Queen of Vraja!

O Queen of the Celestial Gardens of Delight!  O Sovereign Mistress of
Vrindavana!

You are the one who presides over all Sacrifices, Rites and Oblations.

You are the Chief Mistress of hosts of Demigods and Saintly persons.

You provide the force to the Vedic utterances and to all arguments of Law
and Logic.

You are the Supreme Goddess of Laksmi and Bhudevi.

I offer prostrated Obeisances unto You time and again.&quot;

(Spoken by Lord Shiva in Urdhvamnaya-tantra)

Srimati Radharani is the eternal consort of Lord Krishna. Five thousand
years ago, when Lord Krishna came to this planet to perform His pastimes,
Srimati Radharani also appeared. Shrimati Radharani's glorious birth
occurred on the eighth day of the bright moon in the month of Bhadra.
Although generally not full on that day, the moon appeared full to celebrate
Radharani's appearance in this world. Ideally one should total fast or fast
from grains etc. till noon on Radhashtami and then feast as Shri Radha
appeared at noon.* This year Radhashtami is falling on 19th and
20thSeptember. Both dates are quite valid for observing the festival.
At Sri
Vrindavan and Barsana, it is celebrated on 20th sep.*

On a half-moon night in the month of Bhadra, King Vrishabhanu came to the
Jamuna to bathe and found himself engulfed in a golden aura, the golden aura
of pure love. It was emanating from a lotus, which had a baby girl standing
on its whorl. When the king returned to the palace with the baby, Queen
Kirtida was delighted. She was also shocked that the girl was blind.

Lord Krishna's mother, Yashoda, heard that her best friend Kirtida had a
baby, so she came to visit along with her husband and her son. Krishna
crawled up to the cradle and pulled Himself up and looked in. At that
moment, Srimati Radharani's eyes fluttered and opened wide and blossomed
like lotuses. It seems that she did not want to see anything of this world,
only the form of Sri Krishna. Everyone was delighted.

Srimati Radharani is the mother of the universe, the spiritual mother of
all souls. And the concept of mother is the most sacred symbol—that of
purity, selflessness, caring, sharing, nurturing, and love. That is why our
sacred mantra is the holy names. It is the holy names in the vocative. Hare
Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare / Hare Rama, Hare Rama,
Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

'Hare' means 'Radhe.' It is a plaintive, desperate cry for the mother.
'Radhe! Please wake us up from this nightmare of mortal life! Remind us of
the father we have forgotten and take us home!' 'Hare' means crying out to
Radhe in the following mood of Shrila Raghunatha dasa Goswami,&quot; O Shri
Radharani, the queen of Vrndavana, with the medicine of the red lac from
Your lotus feet, please bring back to life this person now dead from the
bites of the black snake of not seeing You. I am certainly Yours alone! I am
Yours alone! I cannot live without You! O Shri Radhadevi, please understand
this and pull and bring me to Your lotus feet.&quot;

In Krishna consciousness, devotees carefully worship Srimati Radharani as
the bestower of devotional service to Krishna, by attentively chanting Her
name in the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra, by worshiping Her deity form, and by
following and preaching the Holy Names and the Instructions of the most
merciful Shri Gauranga Mahaprabhu, who is the combined form of Shri Radha
and Shri Krishna. (All above is spoken by His Holiness Varshana Swami)

&quot;Radha-krsna-pranaya-vikrtih&quot; - The loving affairs of Radha and Krsna are
not ordinary, material loving affairs, although they appear like that.
&quot;Avajananti mam mudha&quot; - rascals and fools misunderstand Krsna to be an
ordinary man. They do not know Krsna's transcendental nature. They try to
imitate Krsna's rasa-lila, His dancing with the gopis. There are many such
rascals. (Srila A.C Bhaktivedanta Swami)

Radharani can deliver Krsna. She is so great a devotee, the emblem of
maha-bhagavata. Even Krsna cannot understand the quality of Radharani's
devotion. Although Krsna says vedaham samatitani - &quot;I know everything&quot; - He
fails to understand Radharani. Radharani is so great. Krsna knows
everything, but to understand Radharani, Krsna accepted the position of
Radharani. (Srila A.C Bhaktivedanta Swami)

Lord Krishna states,&quot; The moment I hear the sound 'Ra' from anyone's lips, I
grant them My supreme prema-bhakti. But the next moment when I hear the
sound 'dha', I completely lose Myself and become intoxicated in Radha-nama.
Because of My great longing to hear the name of My Beloved, I run after the
devotees who chant Radha-nama . 'The holy name of Radha is fully
accomplished in perfection as follows: the syllable 'Ra' denotes dana,
bestowal of a gift, and the syllable 'dha' indicates nirvana, liberation.
Thus, She Who mercifully bestows liberation into the eternal kingdom of
painlessness is called 'Radha.'&quot; (Brahma Vaivarta Purana)

&quot;sa radheti sada hrdi sphuratu me vidya-para dvayaksara&quot; - Let the name of
Sri Radha, in which the two divine syllables are embodied and which
personifies para-vidya (the ultimate truth) eternally shine in my
heart.(Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati)

*Today we pray to Radharani because She is the pleasure potency of
Krsna. **Krsna
means &quot;all-attractive,&quot; but Radharani is so great that She attracts Krsna.
So what is the position of Srimati Radharani? We should try to understand
this today and offer our obeisances to Radharani. ** &quot;Radharani, You are so
dear to Krsna. So we offer our respectful obeisances unto You.** Through the
mercy of Radharani we can easily approach Krsna. If Radharani recommends,
&quot;This devotee is very nice,&quot; then Krsna immediately accepts me, however
great a fool I may be. Because I am recommended by Radharani, Krsna accepts
me.** ** Therefore in Vrndavana you'll find all the devotees chanting
Radharani's name more than Krsna's. Wherever you'll go, you'll find the
devotees greeting one another, &quot;Jaya Radhe!&quot; You'll find this still in
Vrndavana. The devotees are glorifying Radharani.** If you go by the
speculative process to understand Krsna, it will take many, many lives. But
if you take to devotional service and just try to please Radharani, Krsna
will be gotten very easily*. (Srila A.C Bhaktivedanta Swami)

Yours in service of Krishna,

*Vishvambhar*

O Srimati Radhika! O Goddess! In great distress I prostrate myself before
You, falling on the ground, praying piteously unto You with faltering voice.
O Gandharvike! After You bestowed Your mercy on this fool, count him (her)
amongst Your own people! (Srila Rupa Goswami)
