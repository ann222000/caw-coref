Gonzales Says 'Mistakes Were Made' in Firing of Prosecutors
By DAVID STOUT
Published: March 13, 2007
WASHINGTON, March 13 - Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales said this
afternoon that " I accept that mistakes were made" in the decision to
replace some United States attorneys, but he vowed to stay on the job and
fix the system.

Just like "We Were Forced to War by 9/11"

And "Stuff Happens"

And "The Debil Made Me Do It"

What an Administration!  Here's a *NEW* slogan for them:

"High Crimes and Misdemeanors Happen"

Yes, they were.

"I don’t want to pick on Al Gore,” Don J. Easterbrook, an emeritus professor of
geology at Western Washington University, told hundreds of experts at the annual
meeting of the Geological Society of America. “But there are a lot of
inaccuracies in the statements we are seeing, and we have to temper that with
real data.”

http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/02/070228-mars-warming.html

"Simultaneous warming on Earth and Mars suggests that our planet's recent
climate changes have a natural—and not a human-induced—cause, according to one
scientist's controversial theory."

Scooter, it's idiotic to make global warming a political issue, but I don't
expect that to deter you from trying.

How about Dumbya &amp; Co. silencing as many real scientists as they can?
Doesn't that strike you as venal and idiotic?

Broad is trying to make the case that the scientific "middle ground in
the climate debate" is criticising Gore for alarmism. Trouble is, most
of the critics he quotes are not from the middle at all, but are
skeptics who reject the scientific consensus. He has skeptics Benny
Peiser, Roy Spencer, Richard Lindzen, Bob Carter, Don Easterbrook, Bjorn
Lomberg and Paul Reiter. Broad identifies a couple of these as skeptics,
but misleads his readers by making it appear that the others are from
the middle.

It gets worse. Broad simply misrepresents the findings of the IPCC to
make it appear that they contradict Gore.

A single scientist's "controversial theory" trumps scientific consensus?

Sure it does -- at least if you believe science is half black magic and
half damned lies.

I'm sure, like a good right-wing 'thinker,' you'd agree the best place
to settle the global warming issue is in the marketplace. I'm with
you: as long as there's one single scientist who is willing to go on
record debating whther or not there is a human element, we should have
massive doubt about it.

I think, like the good conservatives that we are, we should let the
market decide if there's a human element to global warming.

"The leaders of several worldwide corporations - including General
Electric, Volvo and Air France-KLM - called Tuesday for prompt,
decisive action on climate change created by the emission of
greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide."

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17257868/

"Cohen [i.e. ExxonMobil spokeman] said that the world's largest
publicly traded oil company, long the leading corporate symbol of
skepticism about global warming, has never denied the existence of
climate change. He added that "the global ecosystem is showing signs
of warming, particularly in polar areas" and "the appropriate debate
isn't on whether the climate is changing but rather should be on what
we should be doing about it."

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/09/AR200...

It looks like the market is speaking, toopid. They understand what the
vast majority of those kooky liberal scientists are saying.

Education, the media, and now scientists. Is there a single group that
isn't jam-packed with kooky liberals?

Imbecile.

I'm sure you meant something by that.

Meanwhile, the EU wants Germany to impose a speed limit of 130 on the

Well, that is a surprise.  I wonder if the President had anything to do with
