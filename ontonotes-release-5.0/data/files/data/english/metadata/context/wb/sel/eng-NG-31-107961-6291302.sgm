Mounting an outrigger, single ama on a tandem SOT.  I have two options
for mounting... front or back.  Either option attaches the aka at an
extreme end.

Can anyone see and advantage to one over the other?  A friend who is
an experienced paddler said that a front mount might cause it to steer
poorly.  I'm sure that the outrigger will affect the steering;
however, I can't see why it would impact it more so mounted forward
than aft.

Shape and access ports lend themselves to front mounting.

Thoughts?

I am constructing an outrigger and the designer says that forward is best if
you have an unbalanced ama that is boyant.  It can help to prevent capsizing
while putting it aft just increasses drag on the steering and does little to
help a capsize to that side.

I'm more that a little curious why it would make any difference...
once you get under way, I mean.  I just purchased one of these:
http://www.kayrak.ca/ Haven't mounted it yet; however, he seems to
build a good product.

Well mine can be sailed so the biggest difference is when the ama is to
leeward and the wind pushes the boat to that side but if you are paddling in
waves, the force from the waves can easily flip you to the outrigger side and
forward.  I have seen a bunch of videos of Hawaiian outrigger surfers that
keep flipping that direction.  If the ama is to the back then it doesn't help
to hold you up.  It's hard enough to keep it from capsizing in waves and
rough water.  Kayaks sit a bit lower and can be easily righted but I don't
know how easily you could right your kayak with that attachment on it.

Well, think of the physics of it.

You steer from the rear; yer paddle is acting effectively as a rudder,
pushing the stern to one side or the other, more or less pivoting on
the bow.

Stands to reason that you want the most lateral drag to be near the
pivot point where there is the least lateral motion.

Maybe.

Maybe it could be swung out when you are sailing and be retracted or
pivoted against the boat when you aren't?

Boats always pivot around their center of gravity.  It can't be any other way.

Yeh, Mike; that makes sense.

Or... does it?  At first blush that looks like an absolutely reasonable
rebuttal of my speculation, but then... certainly a stationary boat
must pivot around its center of gravity, but d'you s'pose that is
necessarily so when a boat is carving into a turn, building up a pile
of water on the outside-of-the-turn side of the bow?  'Course, the OP
is talking about an outrigger, and they aren't s'posed to carve because
they aren't s'posed to heel.

Or is that is necessarily so when one end, due to a short outrigger,
offers more lateral resistance than the other end?  Mightnot the pivot
point then migrate toward the end with the outrigger?  It's too early
for me to follow these thought-experiments through!

Yeah, that last is certainly an issue.  I'm machining the ballast as a
stack of stainless steel washers on a vertical peg such that they'll
fall away if it goes over.  That'll help, but... since one of us is
handicapped, we try to avoid water in which that might happen.  As
soon as I get a quiet day, I'm going to take it in the marina, flip it
over, and find out how easy it is to do that.

I agree with you; however, assume symmetry... it ain't *quite* so, but
wouldn't either front or rear impact the side drag equally?  Center
mount is best, but that's not an option.

It's a pretty good sized ama... 5' long and about 7 kilos or so.  It's
on a Hobie Mirage.

I'm less that in love with that "Mirage drive" unit.  My wife likes
it; however, it raises the paddler's (peddler's) legs six or eight
inches and you most definitely notice that higer mass in rough water.
I usually leave mine in the truck.

Also, you gotta have 18" or so of water under you to use it.

Yes, well... that's moot for us because *we* aren't going to do that.
My partner is handicapped and the object is to be able to take water
we'd encounter behind the barrier islands and we're blessed with lots
of that where we live.

I was more thinking about point to point paddling and sailing in flat
water.  I agree that, in a high performance situation, it would make a
difference... and some of those guys get downright radical on the
outriggers.  'Course, they get 'em as close to center as they can for
surf.
