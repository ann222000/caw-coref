The best written account of Jesus is Josephus articles on history of
the 1st century.
And I believe the long sought for Quelle that is the source of all the
New Testament
for the books of Mathew, Mark, Luke and John is Josephus writings.

So if one can find a authentic original Josephus History of
Antiquities that was not
altered by Christian scribes, will have found a very valuable work of
information about
the truth of the time period of the 1st century. I am hopeful that an
original Josephus
still exists, tucked away in some ancient library or museum specimen.

I am confident that if such a Josephus original is found that the
lines given to
Jesus is about the same length of lines given to John the Baptist
(approx 2 pages).
And I am confident that Josephus tells us that Jesus of Nazareth was a
rebel
warrior fighter of both Romans and Jews. That he traded his life to
save his
son Barabbas. That Jesus was accused of wanting to become the King of
Israel and replace the current King and so the crown of thorns of
INRI.

All of that written in the original Josephus was removed and in place
was
given the interpolation that is now commonly bantered about.

That is why in our modern times the best that science can do
considering the
alteration of Josephus, is Occam's Razor applied to Jesus. And when we
apply Occam's Razor we end up as the best sketch that fits the
available
evidence on Jesus is the above sketch--- Jesus was a rebel fighter who
traded his life to save his rebel son, Barabbas.

So if we can find an original Josephus, I am confident the above will
be verified
as true.

But perhaps we will find the physical evidence that verifies the above
before we
find an original Josephus. And that is my next chapter on the physical
evidence.

There is a concordance of the Bible and of many of Marlowe-Shakespeare
plays. By concordance I mean a book
or computer set up wherein you type a word and out pops all the pages
that contain that word.

So today I was wondering if Josephus histories ever mentioned INRI. As
far as I can tell it does not. And this
suggests to me that the alteration of Josephus work where he truly
describes the history of the actual Jesus
was so altered and removed.

That the paragraph that follows the interpolation of Jesus, discussing
the Temple of Isis in Rome is perhaps
a huge filler for what had been cut out of Josephus.

I am confident that if a true genuine untampered Josephus ANTIQUITIES
were to be found that this
portion that reads like this:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; --- quoting http://www.tektonics.org/jesusexist/josephus.html
&gt; Antiquities 18.3.3 Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if
&gt; it
&gt; be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works, a
&gt; teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over
&gt; to
&gt; him both many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. He was the
&gt; Christ,
&gt; and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men among us, had
&gt; condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not
&gt; forsake him; for he appeared to them alive again the third day; as
&gt; the
&gt; divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful
&gt; things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians so named from him
&gt; are not extinct at this day.
&gt; --- end quoting
">

Would really read like this in modern day language:

What I believe a unaltered Josephus read: And there was a man named
Jesus
who had fought in the previous skirmish with Pilate's army fighting
over the
"water rights of building a water canal to Jerusalem" . And Jesus had
a
son named Barabbas who was the most
fierce of the Jesus band of rebels. And they killed some of the Roman
soldiers.
And Barabbas was captured but Jesus and his band of rebels got away.
And John the Baptist was amoung the band of rebels who fought that day
alongside Jesus and Barabbas and others. But Jesus was saddened that
his son was captured and sent a diplomat named Judas to secure the
release of Barabbas. Pilate agreed to set Barabbas free if Jesus gave
himself up in place of his son. Jesus consented and Judas took a
contigent of Pilate's army where Jesus was waiting and they arrested
him. Jesus was tried by a jury of high priests and by the Romans and
sentenced to die by crucifixion with the poster of INRI. For Jesus was
the
leader of this insurrection over "water rights".

Josephus is the most important written work of the history of the Jews
in the
1st century. More important than anything of the Bible since the Bible
is
never factual or objective but is always slanted towards a sales
pitch. To
sell the reader on religion, and for the reader to buy religion.
Josephus tries
to tell the truth of what happened, and tries to be objective and
factual.
The writers of the Bible have a very different motivation and aim, and
theirs
is to make a sales pitch for their religion which is a corruption and
fraud
of the truth and reality of what really happened.

That part of Josephus's Antiquities that gives only a brief 4 lines
talking
about Jesus and then about 100 lines talking about the Temple of Isis
in
Rome, is what I believe is the cut and paste by Christian scribes to
make
Jesus the rebel into Jesus the deity.

I am no expert on Josephus, but I sense that the long discussion on
the Temple
of Isis as well as the interpolation of Jesus (Antiquities 18.3.3)
were all cut and
pasted.

So, Josephus is the primary work for the history of the Jews in 1st
century and
the Bible should be seen as a alteration of Josephus. I believe what
happened is
that the New Testament was created after Josephus wrote his history
and his
chapter on Jesus. And that Matthew, Mark, Luke and John all read
Josephus
entry on Jesus and altered Josephus, cutting and pasting and then
turning
it into a deity myth. I believe Josephus is the Quelle, the source for
the
New Testament writings.

So what I am hoping for, is that there exists an untampered Josephus
somewhere
in the world. And that should this untampered Josephus be revealed,
that my
Occams Razor would be shown accurately true.

That is the written history on the Historical Jesus, but there exists
a physical trail of evidence
in the form of ossuary tombs with Jesus, Mary Magdalene, Joseph, Mary,
and Jesus son Judah
with DNA and with skeletons. And there exists the Shroud of Turin with
DNA testing giving
AB blood type and a photo-like-image of Jesus and there exists the
related textile of the
Sudarium.

So there exists alot of evidence, both written and physical, that I am
confident the mysteries
surrounding this famous man called Jesus will be very much settled in
the near future.

I, personally, am not against religion for religion has very much made
civilization better and
has very much helped to appeal for peace and nonviolence than if
civilization had no religion.
But there comes a time in human history were we have to dump and
trashcan a religion that
is based on a "fraud" and for which religion no longer serves
humanity. Science serves humanity
now, and science addresses our problems, not the ancient religion of
Christianity. We need
answers as to human overpopulation and global warming and nuclear
missile proliferation. Christianity
is part of the problem and not any of the solutions of our modern
times. Christianity even goes
counter to human overpopulation by asking for an increase.
Christianity counters global warming
and human cloning and nearly every biological innovation.

Iraq is a mess today and mostly because of religion. Israel Palestine
is a mess today and mostly
because of religion. If everyone in Iraq and Israel Palestine were
people with a science upbringing
instead of religion. That land of Iraq, Israel Palestine would be the
best and richest and most thriving
and desirous place to live.

--- quoting from http://www.essene.com/JesusLifeAndTeachings.htm ---
Jesus was crucified by the Romans on the orders of Pontius Pilate,
the
Roman Governor of Judea in Jerusalem. The Gospels state that he did
this at the behest of the Jewish religious leaders, but it may have
been
simply that Pilate considered Jesus' ability to incite public
disturbance
as a potential Messiah to be a threat to Roman order. Pilate was
known
as a harsh ruler who ordered many executions for lesser reasons
during
his reign (then again, he'd been in trouble twice with his Roman
superiors
for being too harsh in his rule). Furthermore, the plaque placed on
the
cross was used by the Romans to detail the crime of the crucified
individual. In the case of Jesus the plaque reads "Iesvs Nazarenvs
Rex
Ivdaeorvm" (INRI)-"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews", indicating
that Jesus was crucified for the crime of rebelling against the
authority
of Rome by being declared the "King of the Jews".

All the Gospel accounts agree that Joseph of Arimathea, variously a
secret disciple or sympathiser to Jesus, and possible member of the
Sanhedrin, arranged with Pilate for the body to be taken down and
entombed. According to most accounts Jesus' mother, Mary, and
other women, notably a female follower of Jesus, Mary Magdalene,
were present during this process.
--- end quoting from http://www.essene.com/JesusLifeAndTeachings.htm
---

The above shows us some very much of an oddity and strangeness about
Josephus compared to the New Testament. That the NT has ample
reference to INRI but whereas the general of the army of the Jews in
the 1st century who wrote detailed history of the Jews -- Josephus --
never mentions INRI and Jesus in connection with INRI. But Josephus
should have and probably did. Trouble is that the many Christian
scribes
cut and pasted out that Josephus entry.

It is my belief that Josphus wrote about 100 lines on Jesus describing
him as the leader of the band of rebels that included his son Barabbas
and John the Baptist, fighting Pilate over the water issue of building
a
canal to Jerusalem and where Barabbas was captured and Jesus
then traded his life to save Barabbas. And where Josephus details
the inscription INRI. That is what Occam's Razor would suggest as
the most plausible story.

But Occam's Razor would also raise issue over the New Testament
where it says that Joseph was the father of Jesus and that Joseph
was a carpenter. Because James was the brother of Jesus and
James became the high priest in Jerusalem, suggests that Joseph
could not have been a carpenter, but that Joseph was someone of
large social ranking in order that his son James becomes a
high priest. So therefore, I think that Occam's Razor would say that
Joseph of Arimethia was the father of Jesus and James.

Now why would the fact that Joseph of Arimethia as the true father of
Jesus and James be such an embarrassement to the writers of the
New Testament is unknown to me. Why they had to liar about Jesus's
father is unknown. But if a true genuine unaltered copy of Josephus
Antiquities were to be found, I am confident that it would name Joseph
of Arimethia as the father of Jesus.

The Dating of John According to Josephus
A puzzle for readers is that Josephus' description of John the
Baptist
occurs several paragraphs after his description of Jesus (18.5.2 116
compared to 18.3.3 63), implying that John came later in time; but it
is important in the gospels that John appeared before Jesus so as to
announce him. When, exactly, does Josephus state that John arose?
He is not at all clear, as is often the case for events that
occurred
before his time. Even when Josephus is precise about dates he can
frequently shown to be somewhat off (as when he gives the length of
the reigns of Roman emperors). So any conclusions about John from
this passage must be taken cum grano salis.
Having said that, it does appear that Josephus is giving John's
death as occurring in 36 CE, which is at least 6 years later than
what
is expected from the New Testament, and after the crucifixion of
Jesus.
This date is seen as follows. Herod's battle with Aretas appears to
have broken out soon after Herod's first wife, Aretas's daughter,
left
him. If so, then John did not have much time between the moment
people were aware Herod was remarrying and the start of the battle
with Aretas, for John was already dead before the battle. Josephus
gives several indications that the battle occurred in 36 CE:

*     He states that the quarrel with Aretas sprang up "about the
time"
(Ant. 18.5.1. 109) that Herod's brother Philip died in 34 CE (Ant.
18.4.6 106).
*      During this time Herod's brother Agrippa had gone to Rome
"a
year before the death of Tiberius" (Ant18.5.3 126), which places
Agrippas's
departure in 36 CE.
*     Soon after the battle, the Syrian commander Vitellius was
ordered
by Tiberius to attack Aretas, whereupon Vitellius marched through
Judea
with his army, pausing in Jerusalem to placate the Jews and to
sacrifice
at a festival (probably Passover). On the fourth day of his stay in
Jerusalem
he learned of the death of Tiberius, which had occurred on March 16 37
CE
(and it could have taken up to a month for Jerusalem to get the news).
This
puts the battle in the winter of 36/37 CE.
*     Vitellius' action against Aretas must have occurred between
his
action against the Parthians, under Tiberius' orders, and the death of
Tiberius.
The Parthian war occurred in 35 and 36 CE, as indicated both by
Josephus
and by the Roman historians Tacitus and Suetonius. (Herod the
Tetrarch
assisted Vitellius in negotiations between Tiberius and the Parthian
king.)

The only question, then, is whether Josephus is misleading when
he
implies that the battle with Aretas came immediately after Herod
separated
from  Aretas' daughter.
So when did Herod marry Herodias? The only hint Josephus gives
is
that the pair first met when Herod was on his way to Rome, but
unfortunately
the only such journey we know about was when Herod visited Augustus
to
receive his inheritance in 6 CE. This is not very helpful. So the
evidence of
Josephus is that John the Baptist was executed in 36 CE, well after
the time
indicated by the gospels - but, it should be noted, still within the
governorship
of Pontius Pilate.
--- end quoting http://members.aol.com/fljosephus/ntparallels.htm ---

The problems asserted in the above evaporate under the Occam's Razor
of logic applied to the Historical Jesus. Under Occam's Razor, Jesus
and
John the Baptist were rebel fighters. It maybe the case that Jesus was
even older in age than John the Baptist, for Jesus had a son named
Barabbas. And both Jesus and John the Baptist, like many people today,
simply used religion for their political means. They were warriors of
politics
and using religion as a "cover or hiding" and as a means of
recruitment.

I believe the above passages of Josephus were some patches that the
Christian scribes missed in their alteration of the original
untampered
Josephus. Whereever Josephus talked about Jesus in detail, you can
be sure those scribes were busy cutting and pasting. But they luckily
forgot to mangle and cut and paste where Josephus talks about
John the Baptist chronology. Those scribes probably altered some of
John the Baptist's entry by Josephus, especially where Josephus
describes
John the Baptist as part of the insurrection against Pilate over the
battle of building a water canal into Jerusalem. The reasont that
John the Baptist is captured and beheaded is not because of his
talk over Herod's marriage, but because John the Baptist, like his
fellow warrior Jesus partook in the insurrection over building a water
canal (water issue for Jerusalem). And unfortunately Barabbas was
captured in the battle which Jesus then was captured but John
the Baptist remained uncaptured and thus Jesus died before
John the Baptist.

The passage in Josephus is bogus, obviously inserted by a Christian.
Josephus wasn't a Christian, therefore the passage was not written by
him. Hence it is not evidence of anything.

The original text is unlikely to have mentioned Jesus because the
story was probably invented later.

Let me start off with a question. The names Matthew, Mark, Luke and
John of the New Testament
authors, are they Roman names? That is, are they names of a specific
country such as say Rome
or Greece? It is my speculation that the Quelle, the unkown source for
the New Testament is
Josephus's ANTIQUITIES. Now I will have to research the date-time of
Josephus writings and the
date time in which the New Testament was written but I believe they
conform in date time.

In this book I assert that the best and accurate history of Jesus was
Josephus account of him but
that later scribes such as Matthew, Mark, Luke and John cut and pasted
the original Josephus
and put their interpolations into the text.

That if the world were to have a original Josephus ANTIQUITIES book in
front of us, that the
passages about Jesus would be saying: " He was a warrior fighter,
rebel fighter of Romans
and Jews and his son Barabbas was captured in the skirmish over water-
canal-rights
and that Jesus bartered to trade his life to save his son Barabbas" I
conjecture that the original
Josephus would have had about 100 lines written about Jesus, since
there were about
100 lines written about John the Baptist.

Now, here I am going to have to talk some about how books like
ANTIQUITIES were written
in the time of Josephus. My image comes from a poor source of that of
the movie I CLAUDIUS
where there is a sort of *bookshop* that houses many scribes and
slaves who spend whole
days on transcribing and making "material to write on" and copying
books written. A shop where
authors deposit their book and the scribes spend the days in
"photocopying" by hand. And
the way these shops made a living was that they sold copied books to
customers and to
libraries and museums in the Roman Empire. So have I got that picture
about correct? In
I CLAUDIUS it shows him authoring a book on Etruscan history.

Now I know that Josephus was considered a traitor to most Jews of his
time. But I still think
that many of the copies of the *original ANTIQUITIES* should have
survived. That some Jewish
organization, although they reviled Josephus, nonetheless realized
that his historical accounting
was worth preserving.

So I wonder if in some remote old Jewish library or museum or
collection there is a
*original Josephus ANTIQUITIES*.

If not, I wonder if there is a palimpsest of ANTIQUITIES?

I wonder how many copies of the *original ANTIQUITIES* would have been
made? Would
Josephus have seen to it that 100 copies were made?

This is important because it is my intuition that an original Josephus
would contain the true
historical account of the man we know as Jesus.

---

Origen

The Christian author Origen wrote around the year 240. His
writings predate both the earliest known manuscripts of the
Testimonium and the earliest quotations of the Testimonium
by other writers. In his surviving works Origen fails to mention
the Testimonium Flavianum, even though he was clearly familiar
with the Antiquities of the Jews, since he mentions the less
significant reference by Josephus to Jesus as brother of James,
which occurs later in Antiquities of the Jews (xx.9), and also other
passages from Antiquities such as the passage about John the Baptist.
Furthermore, Origen states that Josephus was "not believing in Jesus
as the Christ" [1] "he did not accept Jesus as Christ" [2], but the
Testimonium declares Jesus to be Christ. Because of these arguments,
some scholars believe that the version of Antiquities available to
Origen
did not mention Jesus at this point at all.[citation needed]

On the other hand, while this argument shows that Josephus could not
have written the Testimonium in its current form, it also
demonstrates,
according to some scholars, [attribution needed] that Josephus must
have written something about Jesus, for otherwise Origen would have
no reason to make the claim that Josephus "did not accept Jesus as
Christ."
--- end quoting http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_on_Jesus ---

Using Occam's Razor on the story of Jesus, this is what I suspect
would be the
meaning of what Josephus really wrote about Jesus, and I believe it
would
have been about 200 lines and several pages:

Now there was about this time Jesus, who was called Jesus Iscariot for
his
band of warrior fighters were fierce and he was the leader of many men
including two of his own sons Barabbas Iscariot and Judas Iscariot
(Judah).
And because of Pilate's water-canal-rights into Jerusalem, Jesus
descended
on Jerusalem to fight a fierce battle and
who met Pilate's soldiers and amoung Jesus's band was his son called
Barabbas who fought fiercely and slayed many of Pilate's soldiers.
However
Barabbas was captured and Jesus and Judas and the rest of his warriors
and his band escaped. And a few days
later, Jesus sent a negotiation party headed by Judas to ask for some
sort
of a trade or bargaining for Barabbas. It
turned out
that Pilate wanted the trade to be that of Jesus for Barabbas, or
father
for son. But the Romans were deceptive in the bargaining and kept
Barabbas and also captured Jesus and his other son Judas in the
bargaining. So instead of Jesus being crucified and Barabbas set free,
all three were now in the custody of the Romans. And the trial was
quick and all three men sentenced to be crucified. The plaque INRI
for "King of the Jews" was placed on Jesus. At the crucifixion was
Jesus's mother Mary and wife Mary Magdalene and father Joseph
of Arimethia.

The above is Occam's Razor of historical Jesus for it explains all the
evidence in the most *SIMPLE* picture.

--- quoting http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot
In the second main etymology, "Iscariot" is considered to be a
transformation
by metathesis of the Latin sicarius, or "dagger-man". The Sicarii
were a cadre
of assassins among Jewish rebels intent on driving the Romans out of
Judea. It is
possible then, that this Latin name might have been transformed by
Aramaic into
a form more closely resembling "Iscariot". But many historians
maintain that the
sicarii only arose in the 40's or 50's of the 1st century, so Judas
could not have
been a member.[1] While Judas may or may not have actually been a
sicariote,
the term may have been used for him pejoratively. Therefore, if Judas
is largely
synonymous with Judean and if Iscariot means Sicarius, then Judas
Iscariot would
mean Judean Assassin.
--- end quoting http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot

The physical evidence as by the Shroud of Turin of Jesus's physical
body shows
a man very much bearded which would be supporting evidence that Jesus
was
not a preacher of religion but a warrior fighter. Now maybe the Shroud
also reveals
some sort of TATTOO that Essene warriors usually carved on their
bodies such as
a knife tattoo.

There is the physical evidence of the ossuaries found and documented
in the
upcoming Cameron film documentary which indicates the DNA blood of
Judah (Judas)
implies Jesus is the father. Now whether Judah shows signs of being
crucified is
unknown to me at this moment.

But I rather think that Jesus was not crucified with a thief and
robbers beside him but
that the two others beside Jesus were his two sons of Judas Iscariot
and Barabbas.

The timing here is beautiful for Nebraska PBS had a documentary
tonight on Peter and Paul. And describes
how Paul "collected" money and treasure in and around Greece and
hauled it back to Jerusalem to James
circa 56 AD. It describes how Jerusalem was full of Iscariots-- rebels
with daggers hidden in their clothes
and would slit the throats of Roman sympathizers and Roman soldiers.
Where Paul's money is not accounted
for in 56 AD by Luke who was writing about 100 to 150 AD.

Anyway, seems rather odd and strange that a new religion is collecting
so much money. Seems to me that the
money collecting went towards weapons and rebels to fight the Romans,
for Paul himself gets captured
and sent to Rome for trial.

So I think the early Christian movement was more about fighting and
rebellion against Rome and Roman
rule of Israel.

There was even a recent archaeology project showing scientifically
that the Rome fire was indeed set by
the Christians and Nero's anger may have been rightly directed at the
Christians, albeit too brutal and
inhuman.

Anyway, the story emerging is that Jesus and his followers were rebel
fighters using religion as a disguise
and cover. And that Jesus was caught and crucified and because he
tried to save his son Barabbas, left
a endearement of Jesus in the mind and heart of many Jews who wanted
to remember Jesus and while they
continued to fight the Roman occupation.

So the rememberance of Jesus as a father trying to save his son
Barabbas was flipped around to God so
loved humanity he sent his son to save humanity. So the more and more
that Peter and Paul turned Jesus
into a myth story as Jesus son of God, whereas in historical truth it
was Jesus the warrior so loved his
son Barabbas that he died on the cross to save Barabbas.

I am convinced that Josephus wrote a very long and detailed account of
the true historical Jesus and about
100 or 200 years after the death of Jesus do we begin to see Christian
writers such as Matthew, Mark, Luke
and John cutting out of Josephus ANTIQUITIES and pasting in place the
interpolation.

Now some of Josephus history was not cut and pasted such as James the
Just, the brother of Jesus. So was
James some judiciary person or was James some sort of priest. Anyway
that tells us that Jesus's alleged
father of Joseph a carpenter could not be true since James a man of
high social rank would not come from
a carpenter father.

So when we put the occupation or career of Jesus as a rebel warrior,
so many things of Jesus make alot more
sense and a lot more clearer.

So the Paul money collection of circa 56 AD with Jerusalem full of
Iscariot rebels indicates that Paul's mission
was to arm and supply the Iscariot rebels. And so we see that all
Jesus followers from his disciples to Peter and
Paul were more warriors using religion to give them cover.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicarii
Sicarii (Latin plural of Sicarius 'dagger-' or later contract- killer)
is a term applied, in the decades
immediately preceding the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE,
(probably) to an extremist splinter
group[1] to the Jewish Zealots, (or insurgents) who attempted to expel
the Romans and their
partisans from Judea:

"When Albinus reached the city of Jerusalem, he bent every effort and
made every provision to
ensure peace in the land by exterminating most of the Sicarii." -
Josephus, Jewish Antiquities (xx.208)

The sicarii even resorted to murder to obtain their objective. Under
their cloaks they concealed
sicae, or small daggers, from which they received their name. At
popular assemblies, particularly
during the pilgrimage to the Temple Mount, they stabbed their enemies
(Romans or Roman
sympathizers, Herodians, and wealthy Jews comfortable with Roman
rule), lamenting ostentatiously
after the deed to blend into the crowd to escape detection. Literally,
Sicarii meant "dagger-men".

The victims of the Sicarii included Jonathan the High Priest, though
it is possible that his murder
was orchestrated by the Roman governor Felix. Some of their murders
were met with severe
retaliation by the Romans on the entire Jewish population of the
country. On some occasions, they
could be bribed to spare their intended victims. If the narrative of
Barabbas is not an invention to
create a parable, even convicted Sicarii were occasionally released on
promising to spare their
opponents, though there is no evidence for this practice outside the
Gospels, which are largely in
accord on this point. Once, Josephus relates, after kidnapping the
secretary of Eleazar, governor
of the Temple precincts, they agreed to release him in exchange for
ten of their captured comrades.

At the beginning of the Jewish Revolt (66), the Sicarii, and
(possibly) Zealot helpers (Josephus
differentiated between the two but did not (in deapth) explain the
main differences), gained access
to Jerusalem and committed a series of atrocities, in order to force
the population to war. In one
account, given in the Talmud, they destroyed the city's food supply,
so that the people would be
forced to fight against the Roman siege instead of negotiating peace.
Their leaders, including
Menahem ben Jair, Eleazar ben Jair, and Bar Giora, were important
figures in the war, and Eleazar
ben Jair eventually succeeded in escaping the Roman onslaught.
Together with a small group of
followers, he made his way to the abandoned fortress of Masada, where
he continued his resistance
to the Romans until 73, when the Romans took the fortress and found
that most of its defenders had
committed suicide rather than surrender.

In Josephus' Jewish War (vii), after the fall of the Temple in 70 CE,
the sicarii became the dominant
revolutionary Jewish party, scattered abroad. Josephus particularly
associates them with the mass
suicide at Masada in 73 and to the subsequent refusal "to submit to
the taxation census when
Cyrenius was sent to Judea to make one" (Josephus) as part of their
religious and political scheme
as resistance fighters:

"Some of the faction of the Sicarion...not content with having saved
themselves, again embarked on
new revolutionary scheming, persuading those that received them there
to assert their freedom, to
esteem the Romans as no better than themselves and to look upon God as
their only Lord and
Master" (quoted by Eisenman, p 180).

In the name of Judas Iscariot, the apostle who betrayed Jesus, the
epithet "Iscariot" is read by the
majority of scholars as a Hellenized transformation of sicarius. The
suffix "-ote" denotes membership
or belonging to - in this case to the sicarii. This meaning is lost
when the Gospels are translated into
modern Hebrew: Judas is rendered as "Ish-Kerayot," making him a man
from the townships. Robert
Eisenman presents the general view of secular historians (Eisenman p
179) in identifying him instead
as "Judas the Sicarios". Most of the consonants and vowels tally-in
Josephus, Sicarioi/Sicarion; in the
New Testament Iscariot. (Eisenman 1997 pp 179 etc)

Chapters:
(1) What is Occam's Razor and Occam's Razor giving the story of
Historical Jesus
(2) Best written accounts of Jesus and how they support the Occam's
Razor of Jesus (Josephus Antiquities is the best source)
(3) Best physical data supporting Occam's Razor of Jesus (DNA
on Shroud of Turin and DNA on ossuary bones.)
(4) How modern society has to dump and move away from old time
religions since our problems of human overpopulation, global warming
require Science as our faith and not some muddleheaded dogma that
is religion to tackle our modern day problems.
(5) If we stick to religion dogma with the problems we face now and in
the future, we have a high risk of going extinct. To avoid
extinction,
humanity must put SCIENCE in the centerpiece of action, not religion.

Here is where the written evidence may merge and consolidate with the
written record.

Of course if a genuine untampered Josephus ANTIQUITIES emerges as a
palimpsest or
some hidden scrolls in some ancient urn, well, I suspect the Jesus
story to be fully given
by Josephus as a 1st century rebel or terrorist of Romans and Jews who
sympathized
with Romans. Here in modern day times we have what would be Jesus
modern day
myths in the making. For there are many terrorists in hiding today in
Afghanistan in
Pakistan in Iran who if they had a son or daughters and were captured
by Western
allies and were tortured so that the terrorist kingpins would
surrender them own selves
and thus sentenced to die, would have a myth story built around them
much like
what Jesus myth story. The Jews in the 1st century were desperate from
the
Roman occupation and in that environment, myths and superstition are
rife to turn
a rebel-terrorist band of men into a deity.

Keep in mind what function religion mostly serves. Religion is the
most easiest way
to gain both political power and to gain money wealth. Most every
politician, even today
uses religion to gain political power and to gain troves of wealth.

But let me get back to the topic of today of Sicarii. Judas was a
dagger man and a member
of Jesus's disciples. I would say that if any of us were transported
back in time to the life
of the historical Jesus and could spend a day with his group of people
we would find that
not only was Judas a Sicarii-- dagger terrorist but that all of his
disciples were the same.

Peter who was to found the church in Rome carries on this violent
activity and raises it
notches above by using arson. There is strong evidence that the Rome
fires under Nero
were truly started by the Christians and not just a blame game.

The historical facts that Paul collected huge sums of money from
Macedonia and Greece
and hauled it to Jerusalem circe 56 AD is highly suspicious as to why
a religion of supposed
love and samaritan and goodness needs to collect money as its main
activity. And the answer
looks to be mostly to supply daggers and war material and horses to
fight the Romans.

So again, the OCCAM's RAZOR on the Historical Jesus looks more and
more and more
like the true story was that Israel in the 1st century was a seething
cauldron of brutality and
violence and terror. Much like Iraq today, only instead of Roman
occupation we have the USA
occupation. Where Jesus was a top class rebel terrorist with a band of
Sicarii men. Jesus had
two sons in his band of warriors-- one called Barabbas and of course
the other was Judah which
perhaps is the very same Judas. And it was probably in the water-canal-
rights issue of Pilate
circa about 37 A.D.(before John the Baptist was beheaded) in a
skirmish with the Romans
that Barabbas the son of Jesus was captured. And where Jesus then
tries to negotiate a release
for his son Barabbas and winds up being captured himself along with
his other son Judah (or Judas).
And the story quickly ends with Jesus along with his son Barabbas on
the right and Judah
on the left, all three crucified together.

So if the Shroud of Turin which has a photolike image of Jesus can be
shown to be a Sicarii warrior
such as a wound or tattoo that was a tradition to Sicarii warriors. Or
that the bones found in the
ossuaries of Jesus and of Judan show some wound that indicates
Sicarii.

Or, of course, a untampered Josephus ANTIQUITIES is found that has
full description of Jesus as terrorist
rebel.

I am getting near the end of this book. I could spend years on this
book poking at every logical detail that
is inconsistent. But I feel that is petty and poor use of my time.
Besides, the details are not going to be the
proving machinery. The proving machinery is something like the
discovery of a unaltered ANTIQUITIES or
the matching of DNA found on Shroud of Turin with that found on
ossuary in Jerusalem.

In this post I want to talk some about when the New Testament was
written and the source of the New Testament.
Scholars call the source the Quelle. And I believe this Quelle is
Josephus's unaltered and original
ANTIQUITIES. I believe Josephus gave at least 200 lines in his
ANTIQUITIES to the historical Jesus
and the source for the New Testament of the INRI, the two that died
along with Jesus, the Last Supper description
which was really a war meeting to decide which of the rebels would
negotiate for the release of Barabbas
where Judas was actually Jesus's best friend.

So I believe those 200 lines in the original untampered ANTIQUITIES is
the Quelle for the writers of the
New Testament where they took Josephus's 200 lines and turned Jesus
from a rebel terrorist to that of
a deity myth. One must keep in mind that the New Testament was written
about 150 to 200 years after
Josephus wrote ANTIQUITIES and no-one gave any account of Jesus in a
full story of his history as did
Josephus.

During the 1st century there were many manuscripts and books written
of great verses and great lines
of past wisdom such as "I walk through the valley of death and feal no
evil....."  "The Lord is my
shepard, I shall not want.... cup runneth over". There are many spots
in the New Testament of this
poetry. And Jesus was never the author of any of this. What had
happened was that all of this past
poetry was circulating around during the life of Jesus and well into
the next centuries and when it came
time to write the Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, that poetry was
inserted all over the New Testament.

So the New Testament has as its backbone the Josephus ANTIQUITIES and
mixed into that are all those
past history poetry that has come down through the ages.

So basically in the 1st century all that is written about Jesus comes
from Josephus ANTIQUITIES (original)
and the various letters by Paul writing to the early Christians and to
James and Peter. Then sometime in
either the 2nd or 3rd centuries, do we have these Christian scribes
who cut and paste ANTIQUITIES
and turn Jesus into a deity.

Why did the Christian religion survive and prosper? The answer is
simple, as Paul found out, that as the
myth story of Jesus gets turned around into Jesus, son of God, dying
for humanity to save humanity from
sin, touches the heart of many people, especially women and the main
measure of religion is to gain political power
or economic wealth. And the Jesus story was very capable of gaining
economic wealth and later in
controlling the seat of political power itself.

Thousands of religions have been borne, have come and gone, and so too
will Christianity. But science,
and especially the Atomic Theory stays on and endures and goes to
infinity, even if humanity goes
extinct.

As I have said so often, God is Science, and Science is god. The
godhead is truth, and the only truth
that humanity experiences is the truth of the scientific method.

Christianity did a lot of good things for humanity and put some nice
things in life, so that life is not
so brutish, nasty and short and filled with violence and evil. But
Christianity was built on a fraud. Jesus
was a man like you or I. And Christianity in modern times is getting
into the way of our need to solve
problems such as global warming, human overpopulation, human cloning
and stem cell. Christianity
is now part of the problem and its dogma delays and interfers and
harrasses science and scientists
that needs to solve problems.

Alright, I have neared the end of this book. And with the discovery of
the Atom
Totality theory where the entire Universe is one big atom and that we
are a tiny
part of that atom signifies to us what God is and what God looks like
and what
God is working on. God is Science and Science is god.

That there never was a supernatural human named Jesus as son of god.
That
we are all sons and daughters of god because we are all a tiny part of
god.

That God does not spend time with sending some Jesus messenger and
playing games with humanity. That God does not wait around somewhere
hoping to hear you pray. That there is no old bearded man as God
depicted
in a DeVinci painting.

God is Science and to picture God look at what the 5f6 of Plutonium
atom
looks like. And because God is Science, God behaves in a scientific
manner.
God is not behaving to check out how many sins versus samaritian
actions.
God is concerned with making the next God of Atom Totality Element
Beyond
Plutonium. God is the laws of physics of forces of strong nuclear of
weak nuclear
of electromagnetism of Maxwell Equations of chemistry bonds of
biology
interactions.

And we are here in this world to help God make the new Atom Totality.
To
make the next Atom Totality, provided we do not extinct ourselves.

And this is where organized religion has outlived itself, outlived its
use.
We have very big problems ahead which we are intransigent and
lethargic
in dealing with. I speak of nuclear warhead proliferation, and global
warming
and human overpopulation, loss of biodiversity, loss of nonrenewable
energy in our solar system. These five could extinct our species.

And religion is part of these five growing problems. In other words
religion is
speeding up the likelihood of us going extinct rather than helping to
solve
or revert those problems.

One only has to look at human overpopulation and the Christian
religion still
preaching for no birth control, fill the planet chock full of people
so that there is
no room for any wildlife. And the churches stance on no human cloning
or stem
cell research is further evidence that organized religion is the enemy
of humanity
and not a partner for progress and a viable future.

Organized religion is mostly dogma. And the reason organized religion
is so
prevalent is not because it is good for people, but because people are
lazy to
know the real truth. They rather embrace Christianity with its sipid
story of
Jesus than to have to learn physics and biology and chemistry where
the real
truth lies. Given any person aged 12 years old and said-- you have a
choice
to learn Christianity or to learn the real truth -- study physics.
Well, obviously
most people are lazy and south-of-smart and so they take the
Christianity.

But the world does not sit still, and we have global warming, we have
too many
humans that are killing off world biodiversity, and we have energy
crisises and
we have to be on guard for a nuclear war detonations. All of these
problems are
science problems. Religion is no answer and part of these problems.
And, so, there you have it.

I leave this book with a short summary repeat of Occam's Razor on the
Historical
Jesus:

Jesus was a rebel terrorist warrior of the 1st century who like most
every Jew of that
century wanted to rid Israel of the Roman occupation. He married Mary
Magdalene
and had two sons named Barabbas and Judah (perhaps one and the same as
Judas Iscariot).
Around 36 AD, Pontius Pilate had a water-canal-right program for
Jerusalem which stirred
a war skirmish between these bands of rebels and the Romans. In that
skirmish, Barabbas
was captured. Jesus's band made a counsel (Last Supper) to figure out
how to release
Barabbas. The counsel decided to sent Judas as negotiator to the
Romans to see if they
could trade or barter for Barabbas. The deal was for Jesus life in
trade for Barabbas.
We know that when Jesus was crucified that there were 2 fellows
alongside Jesus. Those
two were probably Barabbas and Judah (Judas).

Summary of Proof of Occam's Razor:
In this book I have often said that a original untampered and
unaltered Josephus ANTIQUITIES exists.
And that this untampered book has about 200 lines detailing the true
history of Jesus and says pretty
much what the above Occam's Razor says.
The other proof is the physical proof that if the blood of type AB
found on Shroud of Turin matches the
ossuary blood found in the Cameron film documentary of the bones and
blood DNA of the ossuary.

Organized religion was needed and useful for humanity for the past
history, but our new and modern
day needs the true God which is SCIENCE. We need science to solve our
future problems because
they are scientific problems and need the method of science. Not the
dogma of religion.
