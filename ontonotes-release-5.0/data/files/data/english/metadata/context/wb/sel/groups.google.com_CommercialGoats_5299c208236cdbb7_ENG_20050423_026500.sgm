Your Kiko/myo crosses are a Myo buck to Kiko does. Right? I have about 30 Kiko/myo crosses born in the last 3 weeks.FB Kiko buck to purebred myo does most are really nice kids and have started growing well. Had 1 doe have a buck kid and about 24 hours later delivered a 8 lb doe kid which is huge for her considering the doe weighs about 70 lbs.

You must get dark real early in order to cook and eat this before bedtime?
Our dark starts at 10pm. We'll do our Seder tomorrow because of this.

I am thinking of having a whole kid. Have 20-30 pounders - lots of
Myotonic/Kiko crosses (them some meaty kids! whoo!) that would fit nicely in
my crock pot.

My dad is bringing curried local lamb and wild rice and I will make turkey
matzo ball soup/stew. I like mine a little (lot) thicker than most. I add
veggies and more matzo balls to make up for less juice. May make it in a
pressure cooker (biggest pot I have and makes it quicker).

Maybe I'll just make goat matzo ball soup....

&gt; Happy Passover to you all.

&gt; We are having smoked leg of goat which is currently sitting in a paste of
&gt; apricot, onion and garlic soaking up flavors prior to roasting for the
&gt; evening.

&gt; It will be preceded by matzo ball soup cooked in broth made from our own
&gt; geese. It will be accompanied by a wild rice casserole, asparagus, lots
&gt; of
&gt; harosset, peach compote, matzo and wine of course. We will finish with
&gt; Strawberries.

&gt; Peace and Freedom

yep! Myotonic Buck over does.

I have been leery of putting my Myo/kiko crosses with the Kiko bucks. I think that the one doeling I kept over winter was too small. 50# at a 10 mos. I did keep quite a few doelings over the winter (not as harsh as we have seen but definitely harsh - more due to temp swings) for later breeding and she was the bottom of the pile. If I had kept her I would have bred her in late May. As it was I had a customer call for two for slaughter and that's exactly what I had including her.

Do you happen to get pet sized throwbacks in your crosses occasionally?

This year I have some 50% doelings from my best Kiko does that I want to hold back for my Kiko bucks -- just to see what they will throw in the 75%Kiko/25%Myo range. One is a triplet so may not even be ready in Oct/Nov - might breed her Jan/Feb instead just so she can get some weight on her.

My God, Kavelina; I haven't had dinners like these since I left New York City, where my friends' Moms used to watch me like a hawk -- ever since I also ruined a set of Kosher dishes :&gt;)) Damned Goyim:&gt;))

ROTFLOL! Oh Bill! You can't be blamed if you didn't know!

I have to get out my Pesach (Passover) dishes I received as a wedding present. Has gold like gilt on it and are absolutely beautiful!! Haven't used them since 3 years ago. Thanks for reminding me I have them!! We usually just go to paper plates or kasher our plates (throw boiling water on them) for Pesach.

Dinners like these will make you extra chunky!! And love every minute of it! When it says to recline on Pesach we have to! Too much farm meats and succulent sauces! We recline and loosen our belts! ROTFLOL

In my lifetime we only had one pan ruined by a guest. We re-kashered (made kosher again) the pan and that was easy as it was cast iron. Just got it red hot for an amount of minutes (I think 10 but the number was arbitrary). 4 rabbis couldn't agree on an amount of time so said that at anytime when all food particles and smells were burned up to nothing. It happened way before 7 mins but Dad wanted to be thorough.

We were in one of our paper plate phases so no dishes were messed up. We did have to throw out a spatula.
