The power of youth

An event that purists tended to view as an unwelcome parody of a great game - the International Cricket Council's inaugural World Twenty20 tournament in
South Africa - has turned out to be a great success. It has demonstrated that intensity and cricketing skill and intelligence can be combined in exciting
proportion in the three-hour match format, perhaps better than it can be in the One Day International (ODI) game. India deservedly won a rousing, edge-o
f-seat thriller in Johannesburg by holding its nerve better than its opponent. It was the sort of final that would make even the most partisan of fans
- having watched Misbah-ul-Haq slump on his haunches after his heroic fightback ended six short of the target - feel that a tie would have been a fairer
result. By any yardstick, young India and young Pakistan were the best teams on show in South Africa. Pakistan, belying its reputation for unpredictability,
was consistency personified and seemed the more balanced side. India, which had to win back-to-back victories against the world's best to reach the final,
was a revelation. Its batting combined firepower with solidity and depth, with clean-hitting and elegant Yuvraj Singh emerging as the tournament's most
destructive match-winner; its underestimated bowling delivered under pressure, with R.P. Singh showing an uncanny ability to strike with perfectly directed
lethal swing; and its fielding seemed positively un-Indian. But the biggest revelation was India's youth power, energised and shaped into a self-confident
and happy team by an inspired, intelligent, unselfish, and fearless leader. Few Indian captains before Mahendra Singh Dhoni have led their team with this
kind of self-assurance and aplomb in their first major assignment.

Before they landed in South Africa to play a form of cricket that few among them were familiar with, Dhoni's men may have had few backers. Not only were
the three stalwarts - Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, and Sourav Ganguly - absent; the form displayed by India in the ODI series against England had been
patchy. What experts as well as lay fans had underestimated was the power and passion of youth. While the experienced players returning to the Indian side
after being discarded for poor form - Irfan Pathan and Harbhajan Singh - played with feistiness and determination, newcomers such as Rohit Sharma proved
that Dilip Vengsarkar's much-cited comment, made a few months ago, that there was not a lot of cricketing talent in India at the domestic level did not
carry a lot of truth. While success in Twenty20 need not be blown out of proportion, this much is clear: the future of Indian cricket belongs to cricketers
with young and willing legs and arms and an uncluttered mind. There are two clear messages from South Africa for the Board of Control for Cricket in India.
The first is that the time may be just right to consider easing out the old guard. The other is that the BCCI must not allow this Twenty20 triumph to lead
to a slow cannibalisation of Test cricket.

Reshuffling brass

The Pakistan army's top hierarchy evokes special interest even in ordinary times, given its role in running the country, whether upfront or from behind
the scenes. In the present circumstances, promotions and reassignments in the army assume even more significance. President Pervez Musharraf recently promised
the Supreme Court that he would step down as army chief if elected to the office for another term. The court is hearing several constitutional petitions
against his eligibility to contest the presidential election while still army chief, and is expected to give a ruling in the case soon. While the undertaking
seemed to carry an implicit threat of dire alternatives should the Supreme Court rule him ineligible to contest, General Musharraf's reshuffle of his top
brass suggested that he was securing the fort and preparing the ground for a chosen successor.

As the army vice-chief of staff and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee are due to retire in the second week of October, a reshuffle was
on the cards. If all goes according to plan and promise, the next vice-chief will take over as army chief. A civilian President Musharraf will have reason
to feel as insecure about his army chief as Pakistan's non-military presidents have felt in the past. It is in this sense that the likelihood of Lt. Gen.
Ashfaq Kiyani, who has been replaced as the head of Inter-Services Intelligence, being appointed to the number 2 position in the army is significant. Both
Lt. Gen. Kiyani and Lt. General Nadeem Taj, the new ISI chief, enjoy the Pakistan leader's trust and are known to be competent officers. Lt. Gen Taj used
to head Military Intelligence. He is also believed to have played a role in initiating the regime's contact with the Pakistan People's Party leader, Benazir
Bhutto. Last month, Lt. Gen Kiyani surfaced as a player in the team negotiating with the exiled leader. If President Musharraf hopes to have any kind of
political future, he will need to wield indirect influence over the army after moving to Civvy Street. But how realistic is it to expect senior generals
in uniform to defer to a retired boss under politically volatile circumstances, even if he manages to manipulate for himself another term as head of state?

Leadership calls, at Durban and Bhopal statecraft

Harish Khare

The victory in the ICC World Twenty20 can be deemed to be the metaphor of a new India. the challenge is to devise a leadership commensurate with the aspirations
of a changing society and a self-confident nation.

Even before the final of the World Twenty20 cricket championship in Johannesburg on Monday, the new India's itch for a new leadership idiom had manifested
itself at Durban in the semi-final against a very, very formidable Australia. Johannesburg not merely confirmed the new style and new confidence, the joyous
eruption of celebrations across the country also underlines the new mood of self-belief: not what the outsider can do to you and get away with but what
you can do to him if the leader believes in himself and his team. Beyond the media-generated hype, what got underlined at Durban and Johannesburg was that
the young and the younger generations are itching to break out of the paradigm of self-doubt and timidity that the old and the tired leaders have put in
place in the polity in the name of experience and seniority.

Indeed, a sharp contrast to the self-assurance at display at Durban was unwittingly provided, more or less at the same time, by the Bharatiya Janata Party
at its national executive meeting in Bhopal. The BJP show at Bhopal showcased the self-centredness of an ageing political elite, a cluster of less than
half-a-dozen leaders forever willing to waste their limited energies and even more limited capacities in outmanoeuvring one another for the top leadership
slot.

If the never-ending Atal Bihari Vajpayee-L.K. Advani sparring for the (non-existing) prime ministerial mantle was not bad enough, it was the harking back
to the presumed electoral appeal of the &quot;Ram Sethu&quot; controversy that betrayed an unimaginative and backward-looking mindset. At Bhopal, the exhausted leaders
tried to manufacture a new lexicon of demons and heroes, anchored in a very, very distant past, totally at variance with modern India's pains, aspirations,
and dreams. If Durban and Johannesburg came to symbolise the honesty of purpose and spirit of endeavour, Bhopal witnessed a relapse into calculation and
cynicism.

True, the game of cricket is not to be confused with the more exacting tasks before political leaders nor with an equally rewarding arena of public life;
yet it does seem that we have been given a glimpse of two different approaches to the challenges and opportunities that confront modern India - one at
Durban and the other at Bhopal, one willing to take its chances, venture out into unknown territory, and the other mired in the old clich√©s, familiar and
hackneyed arguments, and failed strategies. While the public life is conducted largely within and according to our self-devised and self-regulated (and
often self-suborned) rules and regulations, those who lead in international cricket have to match their leadership wits against the foreigner, who is under
no obligation to give us a break, in a contest conducted and supervised (mostly fairly) by global referees and umpires. For example, friends and acolytes
of Mr. Advani are entitled to believe that their man deserves to be Prime Minister and that this is the least the country owes him in exchange for all
the sacrifices he is presumed to have made; on the other hand, no one will ever want to give the slightest of the benefit of the doubt to a Mahendra Singh
Dhoni in the highly competitive world of international cricket. At Durban we witnessed the self-confidence, bordering on self-conceit, of talented young
Indians; at Bhopal we were treated to the selfish masquerading as dedicated public servants. Durban and Bhopal can be said to define two different national
moods in a changing India.

The contrast between Durban and Bhopal is essentially a contrast between two variations of national sentiments - a desire to move forward, take risk, venture
into unknown territory, rely on one's wits, skills and instincts, and not be afraid to fail; and, then, there is the old style, content to play for percentages,
a preoccupation with minimalist expectations, a reliance on cleverness (rather than wisdom), and a self-absorbed mofussil pragmatism, devoid of moral certitudes.
The younger generation may be oblivious to the &quot;legacy&quot; of the national movement, it may be regrettably unconcerned with the farmers committing suicides
in the Vidharbha region, it may choose to remain unimpressed with the bogus piety and spurious sentimentality regularly dished out by a cynical political
leadership; but, this generation is also unwilling to let the tired and

Destructive path

The Bharatiya Janata Party went to Bhopal with a spring in its step, its manner that of a combatant assured of victory. But as it often happens with the
principal opposition party, it found itself battling its own existential problems. The BJP intended the three-day national executive meet to focus on the
failings of the Manmohan Singh government. Instead party leaders spent much of the time scotching speculation over who would lead the party in a 'mid-term'
el ection they claimed to be wholly unavoidable - which, they insisted, would mark the triumphant return of Ram and Hindutva. Atal Bihari Vajpayee's missive,
delivered via party president Rajnath Singh, dominated the proceedings, what with the veteran virtually asking to be named the BJP's prime ministerial
candidate. The differences between the former Prime Minister and his once second-in-command resurfaced for all to see. All this naturally dampened the
high spirits observable during the run-up to the Bhopal meet. The party nevertheless pressed on - rallying and thundering over the Sethusamudram project,
passing the usual resolutions on terrorism, minority appeasement, and what not.

For the first time since the BJP made the painful shift from the ruling to the opposition benches, proximate circumstances seemed to be congenial. In the
party's perception its principal rival, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, was in a first-rate crisis that allowed no escape from a 2008 general
election. On the one hand, the UPA was engaged in a self-destructive war with the Left parties on the civil nuclear cooperation and deepening strategic
relations with the United States. On the other was the official misstep on the Sethusamudram project: the BJP exulted that the Government of India's affidavit
in the Supreme Court refuting &quot;the existence of the characters&quot; in the Ramayana was just what it needed to revive its fortunes. But the problem is that
by now it is widely known that the project was the brainchild of the Vajpayee regime, indeed that the clearance was given by Lal Krishna Advani as Home
Minister. For the BJP to go on the offensive over a decision that can be traced to its own government is a patent absurdity that voters will see through.
Worse, party leaders have allowed the most fanatical fringe elements such as the blood-thirsty, fatwa-issuing Ram Vilas Vedanti, a former BJP MP, to set
the terms and the pace of their 'Ram Sethu' campaign. The BJP has played the religious card far too often for its own political credibility. It does appear
that today's politically savvy voters, or at least most of them, know better than to walk into that trap once again.

Republicans close ranks

The expectation that a major change in the Iraq policy of the United States would occur in September 2007 has been belied. Several Democratic Senators had
drawn up plans for deep cuts in the strength of the occupation army that could have resulted in a substantial withdrawal by the middle of 2008. With Republicans
refusing to break ranks, the party that holds the majority in both Houses was unable to muster sufficient votes to offset filibusters or overcome a likely
presid ential veto. Moderate Republicans had indicated at one time or another that they could go along with the Democrats if the plans were slightly modified.
However, at the end of the extensive and intense congressional debates, the Grand Old Party rallied behind President George Bush. The Republicans sought
to give the impression that the arguments put forward during the hearings by the ground commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, had persuaded them to
stick with Mr. Bush's plan to maintain the troop strength at 160,000 for at least another six months. Claims of this sort are not entirely credible. General
Petraeus was never likely to take the position that the enhanced deployment - the 'surge' - carried out from the beginning of 2007 on the orders of the
commander-in-chief had not resulted in the stabilisation of Iraq. The Republicans would have also known that the statistical and other evidence provided
by the army commanders did not tell the whole story.

Over the last two months, there have been very few incidents of bomb attacks taking a heavy toll. This particular statistical detail does not prove that
the surge has worked. Deployment levels were increased in order to provide better security so that the various communities and sects in Iraq would have
the opportunity to reconcile their differences. This has simply not happened. In fact, at the political level, the estrangement between parties has worsened;
and at the mass level, ethnic cleansing has persisted. Hardly anyone who lives outside Mr. Bush's delusional bubble believes that the Iraqis will work
together to set up a stable, unified, and democratic state. Republican sceptics continue to support the President's plans for more mundane political considerations.
While a majority of the American people has turned against the war, the hard core of the GOP's base retains faith in Mr. Bush. Those among the Republicans
who will need to defend their seats in the 2008 election cycle seem to have calculated that this base is not going to crack any time soon.

The road home from Khalistan

Praveen Swami

Fifteen years after the end of the war for Khalistan, terror commanders are rebuilding their lives.

&quot;Honey,&quot; his friends call him, without a hint of irony in their voices.

&quot;It's a fantastic business,&quot; says the tall, muscled young beekeeper, his skin tanned as leather from hard work under the blazing Punjab summer sun, &quot;you
should think about investing in it.&quot;

Fifteen years ago, Navtej Singh was one of the Khalistan Commando Force's leading operatives. From 1981 to 1993, the war he fought in claimed the lives
of 21,043 people - 11,594 civilians, 8,003 terrorists, and 1,746 security force personnel. Now, dozens of men like Singh, fortunate enough to survive the
carnage, are attempting to put their forgotten war behind them, and rebuild their lives.

Singh joined the KCF as a teenager. His brother had joined the Khalistan movement soon after Operation Bluestar, in 1984; many of his closest friends were
members of terror groups. &quot;I used to be detained for questioning whenever anything happened,&quot; he recalls, &quot;and the police would often torture me. I finally
decided to fight.&quot;

Fearing for his life, Singh fled to Pakistan in 1992. &quot;We stayed in a safe-house in Lahore,&quot; he recalls, &quot;but Inter-Services Intelligence feared some of
us might be Research and Analysis Wing agents. The atmosphere was rife with suspicion, and on one occasion there was a shootout among various Khalistan
groups. The next day, it was reported in the newspapers as dacoity.&quot;

As the Khalistan movement began to disintegrate, Singh returned to India. He attempted, unsuccessfully, to secure asylum in the United States. In 1999,
Singh was arrested on charges of conspiring to kill the former Vice-President, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. He was eventually acquitted of the charge, but
sentenced to five years in prison for possessing illegal firearms. &quot;The weapon was planted,&quot; he insists, &quot;and the charges were ridiculous. But no one would
defend me, until a courageous local lawyer took up my case.&quot;

Since his release, Singh has spent his time fighting off the 17 criminal cases filed against him one by one - and rebuilding his life from the ruins of
the Khalistan years. &quot;I had to sell off a good part of my land to pay my legal fees,&quot; he recalls, &quot;and have sold samosas for a living. My wife and I ran
a roadside restaurant, and she worked as a teacher for Rs.1,700 a month. Hard work has got us where we are today.&quot;

&quot;I do not regret what I did,&quot; Singh says, &quot;for I fought for a principle. We were young and angry, and willing to die for a just cause.&quot; &quot;Today,&quot; he goes
on, talking of his political work for the small SAD faction led by Simranjit Singh Mann, &quot;I hope to achieve the same things - but by persuading people
through ideas, not guns.&quot;

&quot;Strange, isn't it,&quot; Singh concludes: &quot;the Khalistan movement, when I joined it, was just as it is now, a few men talking in a room.&quot;

A trucker's tale

On the day Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated, Manjinder Singh Issi was celebrating the sale of his family harvest with six friends - and five
bottles of liquor. He had no idea of the gathering storm that would, within months, transfigure his life.

Back in 1984, Issi was a student at the Government College in Malerkotla. His family, which owned a 10-hectare farm near the south Punjab town of Dhuri,
supported the centre-right Shiromani Akali Dal leaders ranged against Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale's neoconservative movement. On one occasion, Issi marched
to the Golden Temple in support of the former Chief Minister, Surjit Singh Barnala.

In college, though, he met the man who changed his life: 'Professor' Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar, a top Khalistan Liberation Front operative who has been
sentenced to death for his role in a 1993 bombing, intended to assassinate Congress leader Maninderjit Singh Bitta.

Issi's new politics earned him disapproval from his family - and reprisal from the police. He was first arrested in 1985 on charges of associating with
terrorists, and detained again soon after his release. &quot;My family suffered terribly,&quot; Issi recalls, &quot;for no fault of theirs. Our home was ransacked and
they were forcibly evicted by the police.&quot;

Soon after his second term in prison, Issi joined a terror cell led by one of Bhullar's friends, Jagroop Singh Kalakh. By 1990, his name figured regularly
on the Punjab Police's intelligence records, as a key confidante of KLF commander Gurjant Singh Buddhsinghwala. While Issi refuses to discuss the criminal
cases still pending against him, the Punjab Police claim he was involved in almost two dozen terror strikes, including the 1990 assassination of the State's
former Finance Minister, Balwant Singh, an attempt to assassinate

Tackling Myanmar's junta

With several people including Buddhist monks and a Japanese journalist killed, scores brutally set upon by security forces, and many others arrested in
overnight raids on monasteries, Myanmar is into an unprecedented time of troubles. The menace of soldiers and policemen milling in front of Buddhist shrines
and entering activist monasteries did not stop a sea of monks and nuns defying the Yangon curfew. Some of the country's most revered monks marched in protest
on W ednesday from the famous Shwedagon pagoda to the downtown Sule pagoda. The clerics have called for public support for their weeklong protest marches
across many major towns in Myanmar. The popular response has been heartening. What is plain is that this military dictatorship is hell-bent on perpetuating
its brutish, reactionary rule and suppressing all democratic opposition, whether it comes from political or religious quarters. But this time it may have
miscalculated badly. The monks, the people, and the organised political forces are coming together in a way that suggests the surge and scope of a freedom
movement. The immediate provocation for the mass protest by monks and nuns may be the doubling of the prices of petrol and other commodities but at the
heart of the saffron upsurge lies a yearning for democracy and human rights.

Such street protests and demonstrations were last seen in Myanmar in 1988, when the junta called for a general election, clearly failing to anticipate the
consequences. With the National League for Democracy (NLD) led by Aung San Suu Kyi sweeping the polls, the junta's unashamed response was to annul the
democratic exercise. Since then, Nobel laureate Suu Kyi - a great heroine of our times - has been in detention or under house arrest. Political activity
remains banned and predictably the junta failed to unveil Myanmar's promised new constitution, work on which began over 15 years ago. Pressure is mounting
on the international community to tighten sanctions, with the United Nations Security Council demanding that the junta show restraint. Unfortunately, there
is no unanimity among the major powers, with China and, to an extent, Russia opposing sanctions. The Association of South East Asian Nations, which attempted
in recent years to civilise - or at least moderate the ways of - the Myanmar generals through a policy of accommodation and incentives, has virtually thrown
up its hands. It has been unable to persuade its member state even to open a political dialogue with Ms. Suu Kyi and the leaders of other democratic groups.
The thinking within Asean seems to be that only Myanmar's big neighbours, China and India, can do something constructive now. What is clear is that only
the hard-pressed people of a desperately underdeveloped and isolated land with an overdeveloped military can win their liberation - and in this difficult
struggle they need every ounce of the world's support, moral as well as material.

Fallout of the global credit crisis

The turmoil in the global financial markets continues unabated. Starting with the sub-prime segment of U.S. housing market, the problem has transformed
into a broader credit market crisis which, as recent events in France and the United Kingdom indicate, has assumed global dimensions. Loss of investor
confidence and higher borrowing costs that it entailed for even top-rated companies have been the two principal consequences. In the developed markets,
fearing a shortage of liquidity, central banks have pumped in huge sums and encouraged banks and institutions to borrow at rates that were deliberately
brought down. A more decisive step was taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve on September 18 when it reduced its benchmark lending rate by 0.50 percentage
point, which was more than what the financial markets expected. Even though stock markets everywhere scaled new peaks immediately, there is nothing to
suggest that the credit crisis is nearing its end or has even moderated. The U.S. monetary authority's action, which is bound to be emulated widely, was
intended to limit the damage to the broader economy by making available cheaper credit to a variety of borrowers.

For India, the only direct consequence of the crisis has been the extraordinary volatility of the stock markets and this is attributable to the behaviour
of foreign institutional investors, hedge funds, and others with direct exposure to the problem loans abroad. If India remains somewhat insulated, it is
largely due to the Reserve Bank's pro-active steps to check reckless bank lending to the housing sector - these included higher provisioning and margin
requirements. Secondly, the volume of home loans, despite their growing popularity, is still small and the lending criteria and practices applied in India
are more prudent. Besides, securitising home loans and parcelling them out to investors with different degrees of risk appetite are yet to gain wide currency.
However, as in the U.S., it is the surfeit of liquidity that prompted home loan providers to take to aggressive marketing and in the process, as the RBI
has noted, cut corners in documentation and other crucial requirements. The global credit crisis holds a message to all lenders: stick to the basics of
prudent lending.

Where fusion cannot work - faith and history

Romila Thapar

If there is strong religious faith among millions of people, it does not require to be protected through massive political demonstrations and the killing
of innocent persons. Nor do archaeology and history have to be brought in to keep that faith intact. Faith finds its own place and function, as do archaeology
and history. And the place and function of each is separate.

Faith and history have been brought into conflict once again by being forced to jointly occupy the same public space in contemporary India. In effect, there
should be no conflict if it is recognised that the two are irreconcilable and that they cannot be fused together. They are independent of each other. Their
premises, their methods of enquiry, and their formulations are dissimilar. So instead of trying to conflate them, it might be better to concede the difference
and m aintain the distance.

When historians speak of the historicity of person, place, or event, they require evidence - singular or plural - that proves the existence of any of these
and this evidence is based on data relating to space and time. The two important spaces in the Valmiki Ramayana are Ayodhya and Lanka, on the location
of which scholarly opinion differs.

The location of Lanka, for example, has been disputed by Indian scholars for the past century and remains unidentified with any certainty. Some have located
it in the Vindhyas - in Amarkantak or in Chota Nagpur - and others in the Mahanadi delta. The identification with present day Sri Lanka is problematic.
The earliest name for Ceylon judging by Indian and Greek and Latin references of the Mauryan and post-Mauryan period was Tamraparni (Taprobane in Greek).
Ashoka in the third century BC, in one of his edicts, mentions Tamraparni as on the frontier. Later, the more commonly used name was Sinhala or Sinhala-dvipa,
(Silam or Sieledib in Greek). It would seem that the name Lanka was a later adoption of the centuries AD.

This becomes puzzling for the historian. If Valmiki was referring to Ceylon, then the name should have been the one by which the island was known, either
Tamraparni or else Sinhala, at the time of his composition. But since the name used is Lanka, which at this time appears not to have been the name for
Ceylon, then perhaps Lanka was located elsewhere. The location of the Ram Setu would have to be reconsidered. This has been suggested by scholars who have
argued that the setu was more likely located in a small expanse of water in central India and not in the Palk Straits. Nor is the setu referred to in every
version of the story. Alternatively, if Lanka in the text is a reference to Ceylon, then the composition of the Valmiki poem would have to be dated to
a later period when the island came to be called Lanka. All this uncertainty is quite apart from the question of the technical viability of building a
bridge across a wide stretch of sea in the centuries BC.

It is said that the Ram Setu is cultural heritage and therefore cannot be destroyed even if it is a natural geological formation and not man-made. Has the
idea become the heritage? To search for a non-existent man-made structure takes away from the imaginative leap of a fantasy and denies the fascinating
layering of folk-lore. It would be more appropriate to recognise the undersea formations in the Palk Straits as a natural heritage and protect the relevant
areas. We pay no attention to the fact that such marine parks are as important to our ecological future as those visible on the landscape.

That Rama is central to variant versions of the story is, in itself, not evidence of historicity. If the variants contradict each other as they do, this
may create problems for those who believe that only one of the variants is true. But multiple variants enrich the interest of historical and comparative
analyses in assessing the degree to which each approximates, if at all, to the historical past or what the divergence symbolises.

The two closest in time to the Valmiki are the Buddhist and Jaina variants. The Buddhist version in the Dasaratha Jataka differs entirely from the Valmiki.
Rama is the son of the raja of Varanasi; exile is to the Himalayas; and there is no kidnapping of Sita by Ravana.

The earliest of many Jaina versions, the Padmacharita of Vimalasuri, dating to the centuries AD, contradicts all earlier versions and states that it is
doing so in order to present the correct version of what happened. It differs substantially from the Valmiki narrative. Ravana is not a demonic villain
but a human counter-hero. It presents the story in the conceptual framework of Jainism.

More species in the red

The 2007 Red List of endangered plants, animals, birds, and sea life released by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) offers a gloomy forecast for many species
that make the earth unique. If unrelenting pressure from human activity continues, these evolutionary marvels, like others before them, will become extinct
sooner rather than later at least in the wild. Global populations of several species have declined so dramatically that the IUCN has added 188 species
to last yea r's tally of 16,118 that may be wiped out in the wild. The animals facing serious threat include the Western lowland gorilla in Africa, the
Sumatran and Bornean orangutans, and India's gharial, a reptile belonging to the crocodile order. The gharial population has come down as a result of net
fishing and irreversible loss of habitat. Their numbers have plunged by about 60 per cent in the last decade and their habitat has shrunk in the Ganges,
Brahmaputra, and Mahanadi rivers in India and Nepal. The gharial is now critically endangered - just a step away from extinction in the wild. The rescue
of the gharial now depends on whether the damagingly huge impact of human activity - the construction of dams, barrages, and irrigation canals - on habitats
is recognised. The absence of far-sighted action is resulting in species that evolved over millions of years vanishing owing to pressure from a single
species, our own. This tragedy has been described by naturalist E.O.Wilson as the silent haemorrhaging of the world's biodiversity.

Governments, international organisations, and scientists view the IUCN Red List - statured by well-defined criteria and now comprising a total of 41,415
species - as a vitally important index of the state of nature. The IUCN methodology also helps to estimate the health of species at national and regional
levels. But it is important to remember that many more species that may be similarly endangered do not make it to such lists on account of data deficiencies
and therefore get low priority in conservation measures. Researchers reported in Current Science in 2005 that some Western Ghats plants listed in various
Red Lists, including that of the IUCN, were abundant in forest sites in comparison with other endemic plants. Such findings do not detract from the tremendous
value of the IUCN list. On the contrary, they draw attention to the need for even more intensive research into the state of India's natural heritage. The
wider message from the IUCN Red List should be read as the need to have a land use plan for a fast-growing India and above all the political and social
will to enforce it.

The wheat puzzle

Food and Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar has ruled out fresh wheat imports, citing the availability of enough stocks to meet domestic demand. There are
however nagging questions over some aspects of the food policy with the shortfall in domestic production coinciding with the hardening of international
prices. Specifically, the government's earlier decision to import 790,000 tonnes came in for criticism on the ground that the contracted price - on average,
$3 90 a tonne - was too high. At roughly Rs.1,500 a quintal, the rate is 75 per cent higher than the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs.850 offered to domestic
farmers. For its part, the government has sought to justify its decision by pointing to the inadequacy of wheat stocks. Globally, wheat prices touched
record levels, what with a sharp decline in production in countries such as Argentina and Brazil. Contributing to the trend was the diversion of land for
biofuel production in the United States and Brazil and, possibly also India's entry into the market as an importer. The Government of India's move came
in the context of rising inflation - attributed partly to a surge in food prices - and as a part of its strategy to moderate inflationary expectations
from the supply side.

According to the Reserve Bank of India's annual report, the good news is that wheat production this year at 74.9 million tonnes is 5.5 million tonnes more
than last year. On the procurement front, however, the Food Corporation of India could not reach the target of 15 million tonnes, although the 11 million
tonnes it procured is nearly two million tonnes higher than last year's figure. Hence it is clear that wheat imports were resorted to for making up the
shortfall in procurement. There are several reasons why farmers shun the government and prefer private trade. In general, there has been a greater awareness
among them of the movements in agricultural prices across the country and even worldwide. There is a strong case for revamping the MSP system and dovetailing
it with a coherent food pricing policy. Ideally the MSP should be announced at the start of the sowing season and delinked from the procurement price,
which should be fixed at harvest time after taking into account cost escalation in key inputs. Although the MSP has been progressively raised over the
years, often by way of bonus over the base price, experience shows the rate remained well below that offered by private trade. As the National Commission
on Farmers headed by Dr. M. S. Swaminathan has suggested, special incentives should be given to farmers who sell their products to the public distribution
system.

Rights activists: persecution and resistance

Mukul Sharma

Harassment of human rights activists is so often part of their daily life that it goes unreported. Detention or abduction, disappearances and politically
motivated imprisonment are used to intimidate them.

A well-known activist of the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) and a medical doctor, Binayak Sen, was arrested in May 2007 in Chhattisgarh, under
the provisions of the controversial black laws, the Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act 2005 (CSPSA) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act,
1967, amended in 2004 and made more stringent after the collapse of POTA. In August 2007, Roma, a woman activist working among the women, tribals and Dalits
of Mirz apur, Uttar Pradesh, under the aegis of the Kaimur Kshetra Mahila Majdoor Kisan Sangharsh Samiti and the National Forum of Forest People and Forest
Workers, was arrested and charged under the National Security Act. A young Oriya poet and literary editor, Saroj Mohanty, who is also an activist of the
Prakrutik Suraksha Sampada Parishad, an organisation supporting the struggles of the people of Kashipur, who for the past 13 years have successfully opposed
the entry of large bauxite mining companies in the region, was picked up by the police in July 2007 at Rayagada, Orissa, on charges of dacoity, house trespass
and attempt to murder. Two activists - Shamim and Anurag - of the Shramik Adivasi Sanghathana and the Samajwadi Jan Parishad, working amongst the tribals
in the Betul, Harda and Khandwa districts of Madhya Pradesh, were served externment notices in June by the Harda District Magistrate under the State Security
Act.

Dr. Binayak, Roma, Saroj, Shamim, Anurag and many like them are crucial actors of our present times. They are individuals, groups of people or organisations
who promote and protect human rights in many different ways and in different capacities, through peaceful and non-violent means. They uncover violations,
subject them to public scrutiny and press for those responsible to be accountable. They empower individuals and communities to claim their basic entitlements
as human beings. They represent some of the most marginalised civil society groups - from the tribal people to the landless rural workers and women's groups.
However, because of their work they face a range of challenges. They are subjected to death threats and torture, persecuted through the use of the judicial
system and silenced through the introduction of security laws. Unfounded investigations and prosecutions, surveillance of offices and homes, and the theft
of important human rights information and documents are some of the tactics used to intimidate them and prevent them from continuing their work. Many even
disappear or are murdered. The pursuit of neo-liberal economic policies, with its emphasis on special economic zones, land acquisitions and appropriation
of natural resources, is intensifying the attacks on human rights defenders.

This situation reminds us of the times when cultural and trade union activists such as Safdar Hashmi and Shankar Guha Niyogi were killed. The bankruptcy
and increasing isolation of the ruling class provoke its local counterpart and they launch a new offensive against the rights activists. Yesterday, it
was Safdar Hashmi and Shankar Guha Niyogi, today it is Binayak Sen, and tomorrow it will be Medha Patkar or Sunilam.

In fact, in spite of Indian democracy and India's membership of the Human Rights Council for the second consecutive term, the situation in the country is
no different from global trends. In her 2007 report, the Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary General on the situation of human rights defenders,
noted that defenders working on land rights, natural resources or environmental issues seem to be particularly at risk of attacks and violations of their
rights: &quot;Defenders working [in the field of economic, social and cultural rights] face violations of their rights by the State and/or face violence and
threats from non-state actors because of their work. Violations of their rights seem to take all the forms that violations of the rights of defenders working
in the field of civil and political rights take. There are some differences though, perhaps the most important being that defenders working in the field
of ESCR often have a harder time having their work accepted as human rights work. This might have several effects, including difficulties attracting funding,
a lack of coverage from the media to violations of these defenders' rights, and a lack of attention paid to these violations and a hesitation in seeking
remedial

An unavoidable divorce

Marriages, at least modern ones, need the concurrence of both parties; but more often than not, divorces are forced by one of them. It was politically expedient
in January 2006 for the Kumaraswamy-led legislators of the Janata Dal (Secular) in Karnataka to strike a deal with the Bharatiya Janata Party to bring
down the Congress-led government of Dharam Singh. After serving his half term as Chief Minister, H.D. Kumaraswamy evidently sees no incentive to continue
this unhappy marriage. When he steps down as Chief Minister on October 3, the JD(S) is unlikely to back its coalition partner's nominee for chief ministership.
The relations between the two parties have been under severe strain for the past several months, with the principals and bit players on the two sides pulling
against each other and the Ananth Kumar faction of the BJP working actively against the Yediyurappa faction. The bizarre attempt-to-murder petition filed
by BJP Minister B. Sriramulu against the Chief Minister is only the latest of a series of irritants; the 'voluntary' resignation of the Minister, which
comes with a parting kick at the Chief Minister, is likely to be treated as too little, too late. The JD(S) led by former Prime Minister Deve Gowda makes
a fine distinction between taking the support of the BJP to form a government and supporting the BJP. It could point to the fact that the November 2005
transfer of chief ministership in Jammu and Kashmir took several weeks of hard negotiations. Although Mr. Gowda, who takes pride in his secular credentials,
reconciled himself to his son running away with the ball and partnering the BJP to become Chief Minister, he has clearly not been politically comfortable
with the arrangement. With a general election looking virtually certain in early- to mid-2008, the JD(S) will calculate that there is little to lose by
ending its Karnataka arrangement. It will feel encouraged by its better-than-expected performance in the local body elections.

With this turn of the political wheel, every possible combination within the Karnataka Assembly will have been exhausted: first, a Congress-JD(S) coalition,
then a JD(S)-BJP coalition. Theoretically, only a Congress-BJP arrangement will remain to be tried out and that of course will be unthinkable. In such
a situation, where the Congress and the JD(S) cannot come together again and the BJP and JD(S) appear to have broken up, a fresh Assembly election can
be the only way out. Karnataka remains the BJP's strongest base in south India. The single largest party in the State Assembly may feel cheated but it
must bow to the inevitable - if the JD(S) confirms its virtual decision to walk out of the arrangement. Going to the people for a fresh mandate is the
only way out in Karnataka and the next Assembly election can perhaps be held alongside the contest for Gujarat due towards the end of the year.

Judiciary lets Pakistan down

By washing its hands of the petitions challenging President Pervez Musharraf's eligibility to contest the October 6 presidential election while remaining
army chief, Pakistan's Supreme Court avoided a head-on collision with the military ruler but left the problem intact. The nine-judge bench ruled by a majority
of six to three that the petitions were based on a faulty constitutional premise and were therefore not maintainable in the highest court. Consequentially,
the verdict allows him to contest the election. The cop-out was not unexpected. It was foretold in the September 10 deportation of former Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif in the face of the Chief Justice's order that the government should ensure his return. The regime's message to the judges was that it would
act in its own interests come what may. General Musharraf's undertaking to the court early in the two-week hearing of these petitions that he would step
down as army chief if he was elected President for another term raised the prospect of confrontation if the bench did not permit him to contest the election.
The possibility that he might ignore an adverse ruling, opt for emergency or even martial law may have played on the minds of the judges.

As the decision of the bench did not deal with the merits of the petition, the key issues raised - the legality of his dual offices, of the legislation
that permitted him to hold two offices at the same time, and of his candidature under those laws for election to another term as President while retaining
the post of army chief - are still up in the air. The case showed up the judiciary's limitations in resolving political problems but in the present situation
there seems no escape for the Supreme Court. It will face these questions again when the opposition candidates in the election knock on its door challenging
General Musharraf's candidature. At least one of them, a retired judge of the Supreme Court, entered the race only for this purpose. General Musharraf
does look set to get another term as President. But with the opposition threatening to resign en masse from the electoral college, and the credibility
and legitimacy of the election in doubt and under litigation, Pakistan will continue to remain in ferment - even if he keeps his promise to quit as army
chief. Saturday's protests by the legal community and the violent crackdown by law-enforcers were a foretaste of things to come. Parliamentary elections,
which are next, will not solve the general's problems.

Contempt power and some questions

V.R. Krishna Iyer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Contempt power is a case of survival after death; a vague, vagarious and jejune branch of jurisprudence, which is of ancient British vintage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

The stature of the judicature is so high and its powers so wide that any action designed to debunk, defile or denigrate the great dignity and impartial
integrity of the institution is regarded as an invasion on the people's faith in the court's fearless, bias-free, favour-free functionalism and its solemn
credibility as a constitutional instrumentality of justice. But what happens if judges themselves commit, or the judiciary as an institution commits, what
is extravagantly excessive, arbitrary, authoritarian, mala fide or corrupt?

The fundamental right of free speech of a free people comes into operation at that stage, and informed public criticism of judicial misconduct and incompetence
or institutional turpitude or dysfunctionalism creates corrective public opinion through vigilant scrutiny and media publicity. Speech is duty and silence
cowardice, since information, accountability and transparency of the judiciary are inalienable attributes of any democratic institution. The judicature
is a democratic sentinel of people's rights, never an impregnable fortress of authoritarianism enjoying immunity from people's speech, with fair behaviour,
high integrity and great competency incorruptibly above suspicion.

Indeed, contempt law must doctrinally accept the proposition that truth of adverse allegation is a valid justification.

The great jurist Seervai observed thus:

&quot;This raises the question whether truth is a defence to an alleged contempt of court if a person, or the Press allege and publish proofs of the misbehaviour
of a judge. The judgments of the Supreme Court are not in a tidy state. But a careful analysis of our Supreme Court judgments, and judgments of English
and Australian Courts, shows that truth is, and must be a complete defence to allegations of bribery, corruption, bias and other misbehaviour of a Judge.
To hold otherwise would be to nullify the provisions of Articles 124(4) and (5) in a practical sense, for few people would expose themselves to being committed
for contempt in order to bring a corrupt judge to book. Secondly, so to hold is to put the judges above the Constitution which expressly provides for the
removal of a judge for proved misbehaviour.

&quot;Judge Jerome Frank of the U.S. Court of Appeals sensibly explained that he had little patience with, or respect for, that suggestion. I am unable to conceive
. that, in a democracy, it can ever be unwise to acquaint the public with the truth about the workings of any branch of government. It is wholly undemocratic
to treat the public as children who are unable to accept the inescapable shortcomings of man-made institutions . The best way to bring about the elimination
of those shortcomings of our judicial system which are capable of being eliminated is to have all our citizens informed as to how that system now functions.
It is a mistake, therefore, to try to establish and maintain, through ignorance, public esteem for our courts.

&quot;We need judges who are trained for the job, whose conduct can be freely criticised and is subject to investigation by a Judicial Performance Commission;
judges who abandon wigs, gowns, and unnecessary linguistic legalisms; judges who welcome rather than shun publicity for their activities.&quot;

&quot;Contempt of court is the Proteus of the legal world, assuming an almost infinite diversity of forms.&quot; Indeed, says Ronald L. Goldfarb: &quot;Neither Latin American
nor European civil law legal systems use any device of the nature or proportions of our contempt power. While critics of these systems may make preferential
comparisons, so long as these countries keep well within anarchy on the one hand and totalitarianism on the other, there is room to question whether indeed
this power is as necessary and essential as our decision-makers suggest.&quot;

In sum, contempt power is a case of survival after death; a vague, vagarious and jejune branch of jurisprudence, which is of ancient British vintage. It
has colonially incarnated as part of the corpus juris of the Indian Republic. My separate opinion in Mulgaokar's case (1978 SC 727) has been referred to
approvingly in Shiv Shanker's case (1988 SC

Salute to a great champion

It was a long wait for Viswanathan Anand and his millions of fans but one that was eminently worth it. The Indian Grandmaster's coronation as the undisputed
champion of the chess world in Mexico City is significant in more ways than one. He is the first non-Russian since the American genius Bobby Fischer in
1972 to hold the No.1 rank and the world title at the same time. He is also the only man to win the world crown undefeated in the knockout format (2000)
and in the round-robin event (2007). Runner-up in 1995 to Garry Kasparov and in 1998 to Anatoly Karpov, Anand has reasons to consider this world title
as the finest in his magnificent career. In 2000 some in the chess world did not consider him the true world champion since his title victory came in the
absence of Vladimir Kramnik, who had dethroned Kasparov. There is absolutely no such doubt now: the field, which included Kramnik, was stronger than what
Anand faced seven years ago. What separates the Indian genius from his peers is the consistency with which he has kept winning. Two world titles, two World
Cups, and several major titles in the classical as well as the rapid versions testify to his versatility as a performer. If world ranking is the barometer
of a sportsperson's form and consistency, Anand has the unique distinction of being in the top three of the game for more than ten years. Further, he has
not once finished outside the top three in a tournament since May 2002.

From the time Anand made his mark on the world stage, his quick, instinctive style of play has shone through. It is a style that has not lost its charm
notwithstanding the fact that in recent months he has been using up more time while contemplating moves. &quot;Perhaps, I see more on the board now,&quot; is an
insight offered by the man who used to be known as the 'lightning kid.' Over the last few years, Anand's victories with black pieces have been on the rise
while his defeats with white remain a rarity. His success, style, and persona have combined to give Indian chess an idol unmatched in any other individual
sport in the country. Since becoming the world junior champion and India's first Grandmaster, both in 1987, Anand has scripted a silent revolution in chess
in India. He is also responsible for transforming sports journalism in the country by obliging the news media to cover the most cerebral of sports competently.
Today India has 15 Grandmasters and several age-group champions in world and continental meets; and every schoolchild knows who provided the inspiration.
In an age of ephemeral celebrity-worship and incessant hype in the world of sport, Anand stands, solitary and tall, on a summit that no other Indian sportsperson
is going to reach in a long while.

A climate change agenda

There have been two recent meetings on climate change, one involving 150 countries at the United Nations and the other convened by the United States, but
little new ground was covered in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. is the single biggest contributor to historical emissions of greenhouse gases,
notably carbon dioxide, that will warm the planet for decades and lead to potentially damaging climate effects. There is some relief that President George
Bush, who ha s refused to ratify the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, chose to make a departure from his administration's well-known scepticism and acknowledge climate
change as a &quot;real threat.&quot; He expressed America's intention to launch a technology fund aided by governments around the world; support the United Nations
on climate change; and work on advanced technologies. His resolve might have impressed the invited audience representing 17 major economies in Washington
more had he followed the example of Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and offered to introduce mandatory emission cuts for the U.S.
California is praised for ordering emission cuts for power producers, introducing fuel efficiency standards for automobiles, and giving solar energy a
major fillip.

Stabilising climate change and managing its impact should be a priority not just for the wealthy countries with commitments under the Kyoto Protocol but
also for major developing economies such as China and India. Several technologies for clean development are available and progress depends on the ability
and political will to absorb them. Considering the inevitability of coal as a major fuel for a long time to come, the policy must focus on carbon capture
and storage. Power plants that adopt the integrated gasification combined cycle technology for coal hold promise because they have greater efficiency and
lower environmental impacts. Solar energy also shines bright as an option. In a trend that is growing stronger, there was a 45 per cent increase in solar-based
power generating capacity worldwide in a single year, 2005; Japan, Germany, and the U.S. added large capacities while Kenya is a leader in the developing
world in taking to solar power. India can do a lot more to promote its solar industry and make this green source of power mandatory for commercial consumers
to meet part of their growing needs. Urgent interventions are necessary in the campaign to reduce greenhouse gases. The alternative could be a dangerous
tipping point for global climate.

Learning from the chemical weapons convention

Ramesh Thakur

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

The CWC has outlawed a class of weapons, instituted a comprehensive verification regime, established its own organisation responsible for implementing all
provisions of the treaty, and placed its own restrictions on the export of dual-use technology.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

On January 4 this year, an eminent panel of former United States Secretaries of Defence and State - George Shultz, William Perry, Henry Kissinger - and
Senator Sam Nunn, former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, published an opinion article that electrified the arms control community by calling
for Washington to take the lead in the abolition of nuclear weapons. Adding to the effect was the newspaper in which it was published - the Wall Street
Journal, the very bastion of conservative America. They did not dispute that nuclear weapons confer many national security benefits. Rather, they argued
that these were subordinate to the threats posed to U.S. security by the uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons. And the efforts to impose non-proliferation
were doomed to futility so long as the U.S. demonstrated the utility of nuclear weapons by keeping them and developing new doctrines of use and deployment.

In the search for total nuclear abolition, a worthy precedent has already been set. Chemical weapons share with nuclear and biological weapons the capacity
to inflict mass casualties even in a single attack. Unlike nuclear weapons, biological and chemical weapons have been outlawed under universal international
conventions. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), signed in 1993 and in force since 1997, was the final crown in the trinity of global treaties regulating
the three classes of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). It deserves to be talked up far more in efforts to pursue nuclear disarmament.

Unlike the more familiar NPT, the CWC is universal and does not create a world of chemical apartheid in which a small group of countries holds legitimate
possession of weapons that are banned for everyone else. The principles of universality, equality and non-discrimination have secured near-total adherence
to the CWC, embracing 98 per cent of the world's population and chemical industry.

Unlike the Biological Weapons Convention, the CWC contains rigorous, state-of-the-art provisions on monitoring and verification. For example, its monitoring
procedures routinely reach into the private sector to a depth and breadth neither contemplated before nor emulated since.

The BWC established a norm against BW possession and is the symbol of the world's abhorrence of these weapons. But because of weaknesses in its verification
system that reflect the scientific state of the world in 1972, the BWC has not prevented the proliferation of biological weapons.

The use of chemicals as tools of war is almost as old as human history, for example poisoned arrows, arsenic smoke and noxious fumes. The means, range,
accuracy and lethality of chemical weapons and their delivery systems increased exponentially over the course of the last century. Their efficient harnessing
for large scale deployment and use owes much to modern industrial processes and organisation.

Alongside the use of chemicals as weapons of war has been a long-standing interest in limiting such use. The CWC was the product of 20 years of negotiations
for a treaty-based ban on the production, possession, proliferation, transfer and use of chemical weapons, and their total elimination. It is unique as
the first multilateral treaty to ban an entire category of WMD, provide for international verification of the destruction of these weapons and the conversion
of their production facilities to peaceful purposes, and actively involve the global chemicals industry and its ongoing cooperation with the industrial
verification regime. The CWC also promotes cooperation among countries in the peaceful uses of chemicals and provides for assistance and protection to
signatories under chemical weapon threat or attack.

The CWC required destruction of all declared chemical weapons arsenals and production facilities within ten years, by 2007. Unlike the NPT and BWC, the
CWC establishes an implementing secretariat, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The OPCW is required to oversee and verify the total
destruction of all declared chemical weapons; inactivate and destroy or convert to peaceful purposes all chemical weapons production facilities;

Constitutionally off-track

Judges sometimes talk too much, on all manner of subjects, in the course of court hearings. Unsurprisingly, their sharpest and most colourful observations
are grist to the news mill; and there is nothing that rules out publication of such content. At times, the news media project these oral observations -
which, not being even obiter dicta, are not part of the court record, have zero weight in law, and cannot be cited in any meaningful way - in a manner
that fails to distinguish between what is relevant and binding in court proceedings and what is not. Oral observations may reveal the mind of the court
- or may just be letting off steam. But while having no standing in law, they may colour the public mind and have an impact in the political sphere. Senior
Supreme Court Judge B.N. Agrawal's outburst in open court on what might need to be done, constitutionally and politically, in Tamil Nadu during the course
of hearing the AIADMK's version of what was happening in the State on October 1 cannot be justified in terms of either sound judicial procedure or any
standard of justice under the Constitution of India.

According to news reports, when the allegation was made by the AIADMK's counsel that the Supreme Court's restraint order on a bandh on the Sethusamudram
issue in Tamil Nadu was not being obeyed &quot;in letter and spirit,&quot; Justice Agrawal responded: &quot;If what you say is true, then there is [a] complete breakdown
of the constitutional machinery in the State. We will recommend to the President to dismiss the DMK government in Tamil Nadu.&quot; He also breezily observed
that &quot;if this is the attitude of the DMK government.a strong ally of the UPA government at the Centre,&quot; the latter &quot;should not feel shy to dismiss the
State government.&quot; No seeking the facts on the ground, no patience in hearing the other side - a pre-emptive leap to an extreme provisional conclusion,
even if this was qualified by a couple of 'ifs.'

There is serious concern today over judicial over-reach and even high-handedness. This concern has been reflected in the strong media and public protest
over the shocking illiberalism and intolerance shown by the Delhi High Court in sentencing four Mid Day journalists to imprisonment for contempt of court
on totally untenable grounds. It is true that a 1998 Supreme Court judgment [in CPI(M) versus Bharat Kumar &amp; Ors], which upheld a Kerala High Court ruling
of 1997, held all 'bandhs' - as distinct from 'general strikes' and 'hartals' - to be unconstitutional on the grounds that they &quot;trampled upon the rights
of the citizens of the country protected by the Constitution&quot; and were &quot;not in the interests of the nation,&quot; tending to &quot;retard the progress of the nation
by leading to national loss of production.&quot; Since then, numerous general strikes, hartals, and bandhs have taken place across the length and breadth of
India, involving a plethora of political players and issues, with nobody in a position to make the fine academic distinctions that the Kerala High Court
and the Supreme Court formulated in their judgments.

For example, in recent years the Bharatiya Janata Party and the saffron brigade have called for, conducted, and got away with several attempted bandhs.
A case in point is the August 27, 2007 Hyderabad bandh protesting against the terror strike at Lumbini Park and Gokul Chat. And what about other forms
of protest actions? Will the Supreme Court rule on what kind of constitutional animal is a 'rail roko,' of the kind the BJP State unit staged in Hyderabad
in September 2007 against the Sethusamudram project? Does it fall under the definition of a general strike or a hartal or a bandh? Is it constitutional?
As political leaders have observed, the logical consequence of the Supreme Court's unevenly implemented ban on bandhs will be a ban on all protest actions
and the right to strike. If that happens, the highest court in the land will itself be responsible for the trampling on fundamental rights that its 1998
judgment warns against.

Even more disturbing is the implication of Justice Agrawal's remarks about dismissing a duly elected State government and imposing President's Rule, especially
in the light of what the Supreme Court has ruled in the Bommai case. In that historic March 1994 judgment, a nine-judge bench, reviewing the scandalous
misuse of the knife of Article 356 of the Constitution, largely by Congress-run Central governments, over four decades, laid down new guidelines and standards
for the constitutional exercise of that power. Thanks to that sagacious judicial intervention, Article 356 fraud has become much more difficult to commit,
although still not impossible (as is evidenced by the cases of Bihar and Jharkhand in recent years).

Bommai full-throatedly asserted the power of judicial review over Article 356(1) proclamations, which can be struck down by the higher judiciary if they
are found to be mala fide or based on wholly irrelevant or extraneous grounds. Nowhere does the Constitution or the Bommai judgment envisage any role for
the Supreme Court in triggering the invocation of Article 356. Justice Agrawal's oral observation, that the Supreme Court might &quot;recommend&quot; to the President
dismissal of the DMK government, is shockingly unjust to Bommai. It is also constitutionally off-track, considering that there would be a flagrant conflict
of interest between such pre-emptive, anti-democratic recommendation and the power of judicial review. The Central government has done well to make it
instantly clear that nothing can be further from its mind than an unconstitutional course such as the dismissal of the DMK government.

A tangled web of questions and tensions

Vaiju Naravane

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Even the most fervent partisans of a united Belgium feel that if the latest crisis born out of the June 10 legislative polls drags on for much longer, it
could lead to a split in the country.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Since June 10, 2007, when legislative elections were held, Belgium has been in the hands of a caretaker administration and the spectre of the country splitting
into two has been looming larger with each passing day.

Will the wealthy, right-leaning, Dutch-speaking Flemings in the north who make up 60 per cent of Belgium's population of 10.5 million people succeed in
splitting the country along linguistic and economic lines? And if they do, what will happen to the monarchy, the French-speaking Walloons in the south,
the German-speakers in the east and the cosmopolitan, mainly French-speaking capital Brussels, also the seat of the European Union and NATO, which finds
itself inside Flemish territory?

Belgium today is a tangled web of questions and tensions with no answers or solutions in sight. The possible separation of Dutch-speaking Flanders from
French-speaking Wallonia and the uncertain future of Brussels are no longer taboo subjects. Even the most fervent partisans of a united Belgium feel that
if the latest crisis born out of the June 10 legislative polls drags on for much longer, it could lead to a split in the country.

The immediate cause of the present impasse was the victory of Yves Leterme and his Flemish Christian Democratic Party. They want more autonomy for the wealthy
Flemish northern region. But they have been unable to find coalition partners willing to agree to their terms. The Flemish Liberal Party of the outgoing
(now caretaker) Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt was soundly beaten in the polls. The other parties from the south, the Liberals and the Walloon Christian
Democrats, are deeply suspicious of Mr. Leterme who would in fact like nothing better than having his own, rich, Dutch-speaking fief. King Albert II has
once again called upon Mr. Leterme to start negotiations to form a government. But they could be an extremely protracted process.

Separation and strife have been a constant leitmotif in Belgium's 170-year-old history. The north and the south have been divided along social, philosophical
and political lines. But the language question has forever been moot. And the Flemings even today continue to decry the &quot;arrogance&quot; of the Francophones
when calling for greater autonomy, if not outright separation.

The origin of this opposition goes back to 1815, some 15 years before the formal creation of Belgium when the victor nations who defeated Napoleon Bonaparte
decided to re-fashion Europe in order to create a buffer zone between France and its enemies further north. They put together the principality of Liege,
the United Provinces of the Netherlands and the Austrian Low Countries to create The United Kingdom of Netherlands. The new kingdom was placed under the
reign of William I of Orange. But although economically coherent, the project was flawed because of severe linguistic and religious differences. And William
I turned out to be a short-sighted leader, imposing Dutch as the official language and coming down hard on the French-speaking Catholic south.

The revolution of July 1830 in France when the Bourbon monarch Charles X was overthrown to be replaced by his cousin Louis-Philippe, the Duke of Orleans,
inspired Catholic and liberal revolutionaries in Belgium. Riots broke out in Brussels and quickly spread elsewhere. The King tried to crush the revolt
but was unable to re-take Brussels and a provisional Belgian government was set up in the city on September 26, 1830, with a declaration of independence
on October 4. But it was not until 1939 under the Treaty of London signed by the major European powers (including The Netherlands), that Belgium was recognised
as an independent and neutral country. The new nation comprised the provinces of East and West Flanders, Brabant, Antwerp, Hainaut, Liege, Namur as well
as that of Luxemburg and Limburg.

Forecasting the monsoon

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) is once again in the uncomfortable position of finding its prediction for the south-west monsoon going awry. Using
a new statistical forecasting methodology, developed in consultation with Indian statisticians and published in an internationally reputed peer-reviewed
journal, the department issued its long-range forecast for the monsoon in April, indicating that there could be a five per cent shortfall in countrywide
rainfall, with an error bar of five percentage points. The updated forecast it issued at the end of June hiked the predicted deficit in rainfall to seven
per cent with an error bar of four percentage points. Happily, the monsoon seems set to end with a surplus, if only a small one of about five per cent
more than the long-term average. But that is no reason to abandon the new model and cast about frantically for a fresh way to foretell the monsoon's outcome.
A statistical model must be evaluated over a reasonable period of time and not on the basis of its performance in just one year. Since 2000, the IMD has
thrice tweaked and changed the operational model it uses for long-range forecasting of the monsoon, and the new model deserves a fair trial.

In all of this, the primary purpose behind long-range forecasting of the south-west monsoon must be borne in mind. India's Met Department began such forecasts
more than a century ago. The government wanted advance warning of a drought as such a catastrophe could potentially set off a famine in those days. Although
the spectre of famine has long been banished, a major drought, as happened in 2002, can still sharply reduce foodgrain production and curb the country's
economic growth. However, the monsoon has ended in a drought only 16 per cent of the time over the last 130-odd years while it has been 'normal,' with
countrywide rainfall within 10 per cent of the long-term average, in seven years out of 10. The ability to predict a drought well in advance remains a
challenge. The IMD's new model, which might not have fared well this year, is expected to have a good chance of successfully doing so. But if the objective
is to distinguish drought years from times when the monsoon is normal or on the excess side, then the long-range forecasts issued to the public need not
try to quantify the amount of rain that will occur. Instead, the IMD ought to look at combining the output from its own models with information from other
groups so as to provide the best assessment it can of the chances that the monsoon might be normal, bring excess rain, or end in a drought. This year,
for instance, if the IMD had indicated that the odds favoured a normal monsoon, its prediction would have been correct.

The heights of fame

In an age where the world is supposed to be getting flat, it stands to reason that the highest point on earth is not getting any loftier. But what is astonishing
is how much Mount Everest - which mountaineer George Mallory described in 1924 as &quot;the lord of all, vast in unchallenged and isolated supremacy&quot; - has
diminished in the eyes of those who climb it. Some months ago a Nepali climber reached the summit, shed all his clothes, and declared himself world record
holder for the highest display of nudity. Does it count as a display if no one is watching? Angry Nepali mountaineering authorities are hardly concerned
about such semantic niceties. They have called for a ban on setting obscene records atop Everest; what they haven't explained is how such a ban can be
enforced on a summit some 29,000 feet above mean sea level and with sub-zero temperatures. When Mallory, who died during his third attempt, was asked why
he wanted to scale Everest, he famously replied: &quot;Because, it's there.&quot; Ask many of today's climbers the same question and you might well hear: &quot;Because,
it's there to be broken.&quot; With established routes, vastly better climbing equipment, and an improved understanding of acclimatisation, the game is about
setting records - the weirder, the better.

It is a long way to trudge, to paraphrase Andy Warhol, for 15 minutes of fame, but nobody's complaining. Last year Rod Baber made the world's loftiest phone
call when he called his wife and kids from the summit's northern ridge. Ever gracious and clearly over the moon, he sent the mobile company that sponsored
the climb an SMS message: &quot;One small text for man, one giant leap for mobilekind - thanks Motorola.&quot; Earlier this year Dutchman Wim Hof attempted, but
failed, to climb Everest with nothing but his shorts; undeterred, the &quot;Iceman&quot; has vowed to try again in 2008. Other record-holding worthies include a
sherpa who has been up 17 times; another who, possibly winded after the climb, decided to have a sleepover to become the overnighter on the summit; and
a couple of Europeans who were the first to make their descents on snowboards and skis. One fallout of the record mania is that it is getting crowded up
there. Well over 500 people have already scaled the peak this year, more than in any other year since it was first conquered by Hilary and Tenzing in 1953.
This is not such a bad thing for a revenue-hungry Nepal that levies a fee of $ 25,000 per climber. But it is clearly not such a good thing for the ecological
future of the world's most famous mountain. The craze for setting records has made the magnificent mountain the world's highest garbage site.

A launch and a bombshell effect in 1957

Vladimir Radyuhin

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

The launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union 50 years ago recast the strategic equations. For the first time, the U.S. felt defenceless to an enemy attack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

It is hard to believe today but when the Soviet Union launched the world's first Sputnik 50 years ago, the event failed to grab the headlines in Soviet
newspapers. The Communist Party's mouthpiece, Pravda, carried only a brief TASS report inconspicuously placed in a side column of the front page.

&quot;Neither we nor our media first grasped the historical significance of our feat,&quot; Sputnik rocket scientist Boris Chertok recalled. &quot;We believed this would
mainly interest us scientists and our students.&quot;

For Russian scientists, the Sputnik, a beach-size metal ball with a radio transmitter and four antennas, was a &quot;no-brain&quot; spin-off of the country's missile
programme, a whim of chief missile designer Sergei Korolev, who is acclaimed today as the founder of the Soviet space programme.

It took the Soviet scientists and Communist Party leaders some time to realise that the event ushered in the space age. However in the West, the Sputnik's
famous &quot;beep. beep. beep.&quot; signals picked up by radio fans produced a bombshell effect. &quot;There was a sort of collective national shock in the United States
- some called it the technological Pearl Harbour,&quot; space historian Asif Siddiqi said.

The shock deepened when, a month later, the Soviet Union launched a much bigger satellite. Sputnik-2 weighed more than 500 kilograms, was cone-shaped and
carried a dog named Laika, the first animal to travel in space.

Shortly afterwards, the U.S. tried to launch its own satellite but the rocket rose a few feet off the launch pad and exploded. The attempt was dubbed Kaputnik.
It was not until January 1958 that the U.S. succeeded in orbiting a tiny 8-kg satellite. When America finally caught up with the Soviets, it was thanks
to German space pioneer Wernher von Braun, the most valuable U.S. World War II trophy.

In October 1957, Americans were shocked to realise that communist Russia had stolen a march over them in cutting-edge technologies. It was an even greater
shock for them to find out that the country of ferocious bears and backward farmers had superior education and science; that Soviet schools churned out
1.5 million graduates with solid knowledge of mathematics every year compared to 100,000 such students in the U.S.; that Russia had 2.5 times more diploma-holding
engineers than the U.S.

Arther S. Trace's 1961 eye-opening bestseller What Ivan Knows That Johnny Doesn't explained to Americans why the Soviets beat them to space. By the 4th
grade, he wrote, Russian children's reading vocabulary was nearly 10,000 words, while their peers in American schools had a command over fewer than 1,800
words. American schools were also &quot;woefully behind&quot; Soviet schools in the teaching of mathematics and the sciences.

Beyond the shock of discovering that the Soviet Union was a nation of better educated and more technologically trained people, Americans were awestruck
by the knowledge that the 183-tonne R-7 missile, which lobbed the Sputnik into space, could also drop atomic bombs into their heartland.

For the first time in its history, the U.S. had the chilling feeling of becoming defenceless to an enemy attack overnight. Senate Majority Leader Lyndon
Johnson whipped up fears with his warning that the Soviets &quot;will be dropping bombs on us from space like kids dropping rocks on to cars from freeway overpasses.&quot;

The launch of Sputnik recast the strategic equations. While the Soviet Union had atomic bombs even earlier, it lacked the means to deliver them across the
ocean. For its part, the U.S. had hundreds of nuclear-capable, long-range bombers that flew daily missions towards and across Soviet borders from bases
not only on the American soil but also all around the Soviet Union as the Cold War gained momentum.

&quot;Throughout the campaign, to demonstrate overwhelming American air superiority, the United States violated Soviet airspace more than 10,000 times,&quot; writes
Matthew Brzezinski, author of Red Moon Rising: Sputnik and the Hidden Rivalries that Ignited the Space Age. &quot;Our thermonuclear stockpile increased tenfold,
while [the Strategic Air Commander, Gen. Curtis] LeMay publicly speculated about the 60 million Soviet citizens targeted

Victory for diplomacy

The conclusion of a six-nation agreement under which the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea is to disclose all details of its nuclear programme and dismantle
three major facilities in Yongbyon by the end of the year comes as a welcome demonstration of the efficacy of sustained, creative diplomacy. While the
Bush administration appears intent on grabbing much of the credit for this achievement, the truth is that the deal would not have come through had the
other parties involved not stood on principle. China, South Korea, and Russia insisted all along that the path of negotiation should not be abandoned.
With these countries holding firm, Washington was unable to pursue its preferred approach of confronting Pyongyang with sanctions and threats of a regime
change. The negotiation process began yielding results after an accord was reached in February 2007 and the latest agreement signals the start of the second
phase. Within five months of the February deal, North Korea honoured the commitment made in the first phase to close down the Yongbyon reactor and other
facilities. As now envisaged, the third phase will end with Pyongyang surrendering all fissile material, including the ten nuclear warheads it is believed
to possess. The de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula might not happen in a hurry, but the results achieved in the six-nation talks were hardly imaginable
a year ago after the Kim Il Jong regime carried out a nuclear test in October 2006.

However, the process of negotiations could unravel if contentious issues are not tackled early and sincerely. North Korea received 100,000 tonnes of fuel
oil during the first phase and has been promised a further 900,000 tonnes, as it fulfils its commitments in the second phase. However, Pyongyang has not
given up the demand that the United States deliver the two light-water reactors it offered as part of the 1994 Agreed Framework. The two sides might not
be able to resolve this issue unless they overcome disagreement over another matter. Washington alleges that Pyongyang has a clandestine uranium-enrichment
programme and insists on full disclosure. The Kim Il Jong administration continues to deny the existence of any such programme. The non-nuclear components
of the October deal could also throw up problems. Washington's promise to work towards removing North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism
is contingent on Pyongyang's fulfilment of its second-phase commitments. With hardliners in the U.S. already criticising the October deal, there is no
guarantee that the sanctions in place will be lifted. If North Korea, which needs large inflows of foreign capital, is to deliver on its side of the bargain,
the financial squeeze must be ended.

The natural gas pricing conundrum

After considerable delay, the empowered group of ministers, headed by External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee has approved, with slight modifications,
the pricing formula proposed by Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) for the supply of natural gas from its offshore fields in the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin.
The decision will have far reaching implications. The pricing formula might well become the benchmark for supply of natural gas prospected for and supplied
by private producers from the deep water basins. Whether the approved price will be a sufficient incentive for prospective bidders in the forthcoming rounds
of the new exploration licensing policy (NELP) remains to be seen, but it is obvious that RIL has more or less secured what it had asked for. As against
a $4.33 per million metric British thermal units (mmbtu) proposed by it, the eGOM has fixed $4.2 per mmbtu as the floor price. The composition of the formula
is revealing. There is a &quot;fixed&quot; component of $2.5 per mmbtu. Secondly, there is a method for linking the natural gas price to the ruling Brent prices
of crude. The third leg of the formula is a positive integer to be quoted by the bidder for natural gas. The approved price of $4.2 covers only the first
two components. The eGOM has provided for an additional cushion by lowering the ceiling on Brent crude prices from $65 to $60 a barrel. Given that the
current global oil prices are considerably higher and are not expected to come down in the foreseeable future, RIL stands to benefit.

Critics of the government's decision say that the methodology used to arrive at the price needs greater transparency. Even the Prime Minister's Economic
Advisory Council, which generally approved it, found the methodology opaque in some critical aspects. A stronger criticism has come from the users of natural
gas - the power and the fertiliser industries. For them, any shift away from the price control regime will mean a sharp rise in the cost of natural gas,
a key input. As has been the case with many other sectors, the opening up of the natural gas industry has brought new challenges to the producers, principal
users, and the regulators. There is a strong case for strengthening the existing regulatory framework for the upstream petroleum and natural gas industries.
The regulator, whose major task is to reconcile the often conflicting claims of producers and users of natural gas, needs to lay down clear and transparent
guidelines that are broadly acceptable to different segments.

Why India should opt for nuclear power

M.R. Srinivasan

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

France, which has 80 per cent nuclear electricity, has the lowest cost of electricity in Europe and the lowest per capita carbon emission; Korea and Japan
prefer imported nuclear energy to other forms of energy; and China is investing heavily in nuclear energy in spite of its being the largest producer of
coal in the world.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

As part of the debate on the benefits of the India-United States nuclear agreement - on the nuclear energy option in India's context - many opinions have
been expressed on the economic viability of nuclear power. It is therefore useful to look at this question dispassionately. I do this from my position
as Chairman of an Expert Committee set up by the Department of Atomic Energy for fixing nuclear power tariff.

We shall go back in history and take a look at the tariff for the first nuclear power station at Tarapur which is 95 paise per kwh. Only some of our older
hydroelectric or thermal stations sell power at a lower cost. When this project was taken up, there were many critics, both Indian and foreign, who doubted
the economic wisdom of Homi Bhabha. A distinguished American economist, Rosenstein-Rodin, sarcastically remarked that when a man is hungry, he will buy
a loaf of bread and not a bakery. For more than 35 years, Tarapur has produced the lowest cost non-hydro power. The investment was amortised in 25 years;
it has now completed 38 years of operation. The power station may continue to operate for 40 or even 50 years. The fuelling cost component is only about
25 paise.

The first three twin reactor pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWR) at Kalpakkam, Narora and Kakrapara, built with India's own technology and equipment,
have power tariffs in the range of 180-200 paise per kwh. The fuelling cost component is about 65 paise, and costs associated with heavy water, including
a lease charge for the inventory and make-up for operating losses, account for about 47 paise.

The more recent PHWR units of Indian technology completed in the late 1990s and early years of this decade at Kaiga, Rajasthan 3 &amp; 4 and Tarapur 3 &amp; 4 have
tariffs in the range of 270-285 paise per kwh. The higher construction cost of newer stations is the reason for the higher tariff for the second lot of
power stations than the first lot. In all these cases, the operating life of the PHWRs has been taken as 25 years.

The present thinking in the nuclear industry is that Light Water Reactors (Pressurised Water Reactors, Boiling Water Reactors and VVERs of Russian design)
using low enriched uranium as fuel can have a safe operating life of 40-50 years (some hold the view it could be even 60 years). The PHWRs we have built
and may build in future should also have a life not less than 40 years. Some of the early PHWRs Canada and India built used for the coolant channel inside
the reactor an alloy of zirconium that did not have adequate life under irradiation. In the Indian PHWRs of earlier design, it is being replaced with coolant
channels made of an improved material which has a higher operating life. So our present and future PHWRs are expected to operate safely for at least 40
years.

The heavy water charges are recovered by levy of a lease charge, calculated in a manner that the full cost of heavy water would have been paid by the Nuclear
Power Corporation of India, by the end of the operating life of the reactor.

A new factor is that there is an economic opportunity for the use of this heavy water in what are called Advanced Heavy Water Reactors. Such reactors are
considered an appropriate choice for Uranium-233-Thorium systems. A 300-MW AHWR has been designed and construction work may start in 2008.

The tariff for power from present generation PHWRs should come down to 250 paise per kwh or less when we allow for a longer operating life and also adjust
the heavy water charges downward, in view of its continuing use in a future generation of reactors. The fuelling cost of Indian PHWRs is higher than what
it should be because the cost of natural uranium produced in India has been four or five times that of the international market price. This is due to the
low grade ore available in India.

In the last year or so, the international price of uranium has flared up, in sympathy with the price of petroleum and hence the ratio of Indian price to
global price is 2:1. However, this steep increase is expected to ease in the near future. If India accesses
