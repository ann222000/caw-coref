Foxman Says'Never Again' -
But It's The Same Old Story
By Curt Maynard
7-9-6

Abraham Foxman is the director of the Anti-Defamation League [ADL], an
organization that claims to protect various groups from defamation, which is
loosely defined as insult, slander, libel, denigration or vilification. The
ADL was founded more than eighty years ago and has engaged in an ongoing and
concerted campaign to commit exactly the type of behavior it alleges to
protect people from ever since. The primary focus of the ADL's ire has
traditionally been European Americans, but recently it has changed its focus
to include Arabs and Muslims, a result of the &quot;War on Terrorism,&quot; and
Israel's need to convince Americans and Europeans that Islam is their mortal
enemy.

In reality, the ADL is nothing more than a political arm of organized world
Jewry, Zionism, for the faint of heart. It is essentially an organization
that is designed to smear the reputation of those that dare question the
motives of Jewry and often, individual Jews acting out of sheer selfishness
or on behalf of their co-ethnics. The ADL has the ear of government, the
judiciary and law enforcement, it has managed to insert itself in these
venues by claiming to represent the underdog, which is generally understood
to mean minorities in our present day and age.

The ADL engages in defamation, in fact it has mastered the art of
defamation - it can and does defame anyone that attempts to bring attention
to issues that organized Jewry wants kept under wraps. Interestingly, Foxman
and the ADL aren't in the least bit hesitant to engage in this type of
disingenuous behavior, in fact they do so in the open, relying on the media,
which is disproportionately owned, operated and managed by ethnic Jews to
convey to the world the ADL's goal while at the same time suppressing the
League's defamatory techniques.

This blatantly biased approach enables the ADL to publicly question the
veracity of the Russia President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government
when it indicts and imprisons the thieving Oligarch's who stole tens of
billions of dollars from the Russian people in the 1990s, without revealing
to Americans the overwhelming evidence that said Oligarch's did so
criminally and with extreme malice of forethought.

The Oligarch's were able to borrow incredible sums of money from their
American co-ethnics in order to carry out this crime, something else that
the ADL has successfully hidden from the American public. The undeniable
fact is, every Oligarch under indictment or in prison today in Russia is
guilty of treason, they acted against the best interests of their own
countrymen; they did this with the assistance of what amounts to a Jewish
international finance network, and they did so to further their own selfish
interests and the interests of organized Jewry.

For this reason the ADL has worked openly and behind the scenes to pressure
the Russian President to release these Jews and more importantly to allow
them to keep their ill gotten gains. What's important to understand is that
the establishment media and the ADL worked hand in hand, once again the
media pushes the ADL's agenda without divulging uncomfortable facts
associated with what the ADL's actual agenda is.

Fortunately, Foxman has been overly aggressive of late and has exposed the
ADL to a tremendous amount of public scrutiny, which has exposed him and the
ADL for what they really are, agents of organized Jewry. As mentioned
previously, the ADL has been around for some time, it has exposed itself in
the past, when it was found guilty of defamation in a case involving a
couple that allegedly cast some anti-Semitic aspersions on a Jew that had
nothing to do with the organization, the ADL flexed its muscle and went
after the couple, smearing them and attacking their reputations.

A court found the ADL guilty of this and fined them, but most Americans have
never heard of the case, the Jewish media neglected to cover it at any
length.

The ADL too has been implicated in espionage, it used its law enforcement
contacts to dig up incriminating information on its enemies, which are
legion, and then used that information to smear or defame them, for this
reason and many others, some people have suggested that the ADL change its
moniker to the Defamation League. This case too received almost no attention
in the mainstream media, further evidence that the media acts in the best
interests of Jews at the ADL and the ADL acts in the best interests of the
Jewish media.

One example of this, is the absolute fact that Foxman and the ADL literally
jump all over anyone the moment they suggest that Jews have a
disproportionate influence in the media and/or Hollywood, which is in
reality just another media outlet.

The Reverend Ted Pike recently noted that one of the primary goals of the
new Office of Anti-Semitism [Yes, such a entity actually exists] at the
Department of State is to link any suggestion that the media is dominated by
Jews, with virulent anti-Semitism, a hate crime if Foxman and the ADL have
anything to do with it. Foxman too emphasizes this connection in his book
Never Again, a tome devoted to elaborating on the many alleged thought
crimes directed against Jewry, he notes in a classic admission and denial
manner:

&quot;It's even true that, proportionately, there has always been a relatively
prominent Jewish presence in the movie, TV, and record industries, for a
variety of social and cultural reasons.&quot;[1]

The fact is, and Foxman knows this better than anyone else, ethnic Jews have
a virtual stranglehold on the media, in its many facets, which includes all
of entertainment television and most importantly, the televised news media.

Foxman's use of the words &quot;prominent Jewish presence,&quot; is an understatement,
ethnic Jews are so over-represented in the media, that they constitute
nothing less than a majority, which is indeed strange and disproportionate
for a demographic that constitute less than 3% of the entire American
population. Consider the following:

Writing of the initial merger of Time, Inc. with Warner, Jewish writer
Michael Wolff

said in New York magazine in 2001 &quot;since Time Inc.'s merger with Warner ten
years ago, one of the interesting transitions is that it has become a Jewish
company.&quot; [&quot;From AOL to W,&quot; New York magazine, January 29, 2001]

Disney, the world's second largest media conglomerate was managed by Jewish
CEO Michael Eisner for decades, Eisner made it his mission to corrupt
anything and everything the founder of Disney, Walt Disney ever stood for.
Disney was founded as a family entertainment program, but by the time Eisner
left the company, Disney had produced programs of such filth and degeneracy
that Disney can in no way be considered a network devoted to family
entertainment. Eisner resigned a year ago and was replaced by another Jew,
who has carried on Eisner's depraved legacy.

The third largest media conglomerate is Viacom, and its headed by Sumner
Redstone, a Jew born Murray Rothstein.

Edgar Bronfman Jr., another Jew, acquired NBC in a merger several years ago;
he additionally monopolizes the recording industry, and owns Interscope
records too, which is probably the largest producer of &quot;Gangsta Rap,&quot; in the
world.

Fox Entertainment is headed by Rupert Murdoch, who is allegedly a Gentile,
but I can tell you for certain, his background is obscured, this author
spent a rather substantial sum of money three years ago in an attempt to
trace Murdoch's pedigree, and what I found was that his mother's ancestry
could not be verified one way or another. I was unable to prove Elisabeth
Joy Greene was a Jew, but nor was I able to confirm that she wasn't.
According to Jewish Law, the child born of a Jewish womb is a Jew. In any
case, Murdoch relies on a Jew named Peter Chernin to actually conduct the
day-to-day business at Fox, so in essence, Jews have a

prominent position at Fox too.

So there you have it, there are the facts. The three largest television
media conglomerates are for all intents and purposes in the hands of ethnic
Jews. Another well-known Jewish television entertainment personality named
Ben Stein had this to say about the prevalence of Jews in the media
industry:

At mighty Paramount, the controlling stockholder is Sumner Redstone. Head of
the studio is Jon Dolgen. Head of production is Sherry Lansing--all members
of the tribe. At titanic Disney, the CEO is Michael Eisner, the world's most
assimilated Jew, who might as well be a Presbyterian. Deputy head is Michael
Ovitz, karate champ but also a Jew. Head of the studio is Joe Roth. At newly
energized ICM, the top dogs are Jeff Berg and Jim Wiatt. At still
overwhelming CAA, Jack Rapke and other members of my faith predominate. At
William Morris, Jon Burnham and other Jews are, by and large, in the power
positions. This has always been true in Hollywood. The ex-furriers who
created Hollywood were Eastern European Jewish immigrants, and all of the
great edifice of fantasy-making in Hollywood is their handiwork. Names like
Zukor and Lasky and Goldwyn and Cohn are the foundation of mass culture in
America and the world.[2] Stein took it a step further by citing the fact
that Hollywood, which as we now know is predominantly controlled by Jews,
after all a Jew admitted it, has in fact had what is probably the greatest
impact on western culture than any other factor in the last century. Foxman
would deny it, but nonetheless it's true, our perception of the world is
largely the result of Hollywood's impact on our culture, therefore,
deductive logic demands that we recognize the fact that Jewry has had a
considerable effect on how we view the world around us.

At this point it's worth considering what Abraham Foxman has to say about
anti-Semitism, he refers to it as a &quot;virus,&quot; a &quot;disease,&quot; a &quot;plague,&quot; a
&quot;hate crime,&quot; but not

Erm, that's what we have Civil Courts for. The fact is that they can't win
in any court because they don't have a case and can't prove the elements of
defamation etc. So what they do is employ illegal goon tactics to shut up
people they don't like.

These so called Oligarchs were in fact criminals who saw a big opportunity
when the Soviet Union collapsed and they were in the process of
privatization. The &quot;Russian Mafia&quot; is in reality the traditional criminal
class in Russia-the jews. Sure, there are common non jew criminals in Russia
but it was the jews who committed the big crimes like Bolshevism and getting
their hands on former National property for next to nothing. All of these
criminals absconded from the country with their money. Only  a few of the
dumber or greedier like Khodokovshy who wasn't satisfied just with the money
but wanted political control as well, were arrested and tried for their
crimes. Every one of these crooks, whether in England or israel, should be
extradited back to their home country to stand trial. We don't give
sanctuary to criminals.

Almost all of them have kept their illegal money and absconded from their
country. Of course, the jews don't really have a country and have only one
allegiance.

Of course. But Foxman is just engaging in traditional jew conduct to divert
attention away from the jews by attacking everyone else. It's just another
jew con game and apparently they are getting desperate now. With other forms
of communication and information, jews no longer have a monopoly on shaping
public opinion. TV and newspapers are going downhill and so far no one's
been able to control the Net.
