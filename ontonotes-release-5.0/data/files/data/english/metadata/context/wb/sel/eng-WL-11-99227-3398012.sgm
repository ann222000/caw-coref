There, Roger , I did it. His effort today, "The Swift Boating of Cindy Sheehan," is a masterpiece of misdirection, falsehood, scurrility, and bombast. "Swift Boating" in lefty parlance is meant to correspond to the term "borking." There is, however, one trifling distinction between the two terms: the essence of "borking" is to employ a range of propagandistic techniques ( misrepresentation, half-truths, guilt by specious association, wild extrapolation, etc.) to demonize an opponent; "Swift Boating," on the other hand, always involves the airing of truths that prove to be inconvenient, embarrasing and damaging. Some examples of the two genres: Bob Bork criticized the legal reasoning undergirding the Supreme Court's " "penumbras formed by emanations" " privacy jurisprudence and was therefore in favor of forcing women into back-alley abortions . George Bush didn't like a piece of "hate-crime" legislation when he was governor of Texas and so he was virtually a party to a lynching of a black man in Jasper, Texas. Fresh in everybody's mind is the NARAL's attempted borking of John Roberts, an attept that was so transparent and clumsy that even Pat Leahy was embarassed by it. The paradigmatic instance of Swift Boating, one gathers from Rich, is what the eponymous Swift Boat Veterans for Truth did to John Kerry last year. The Veterans, it will be recalled, had the temerity to shine a klieg light on Kerry's Vietnam War confabulations and demonstrate to the satisfaction of any sentient being that Kerry was nothing more than a fraud wrapped up in a phony inside a poseur. They exposed the truth, in other words, and Kerry never recovered.
This brings us to Mother Sheehan . Rich is upset that people are scrutinizing Sheehan's "wacky" (his word) rhetoric and "the opportunistic left-wing groups that have attached themselves to her like barnacles." To Rich, this scrutiny is character assassination, orchestrated at the highest levels by the Karl Rove/Fox News disinformation axis .B ut Frank, it isn't character assasination if it is true and relevant . If Mother Sheehan is a hero to the left, not because she is a grieving mother but because she has become a kind of foreign policy guru, isn't it important to listen to what she actually has to say ? Let's review some of her pearls of geopolitical wisdom from a single speech she gave on Aug. 5:

And I'm glad to hear everybody else's words, because somebody's gotta stop those lying bastards. Somebody has to stop them.

So anyway that filth-spewer and warmonger, George Bush was speaking after the tragedy of the marines in Ohio, he said a couple things that outraged me.

You tell me the truth. You tell me that my son died for oil. You tell me that my son died to make your friends rich. You tell me my son died to spread the cancer of Pax Americana, imperialism in the Middle East. You tell me that, you don't tell me my son died for freedom and democracy.'

You get America out of Iraq, you get Israel out of Palestine

What can we do to get him out of power? And I'm gonna say the I' word. Impeach. And we have to have everybody impeached that lied to the American public, and that's the executive branch, and any people in congress, and we gotta go all the way down and we might have to go all the way down to the person who picks up the dogshit in Washington.

When I was growing up, it was Communists'. Now it's Terrorists'. So you always have to have somebody to fight and be afraid of, so the war machine can build more bombs, guns, and bullets and everything.

Now let's take a look at some of Mother Sheehan's friends and colleagues: CODEPINK , United for Peace &amp; Justice , and Veterans For Peace . What Sheehan and these organizations have in common is their strident and virulent hatred of this country. All of these groups are endorsers of and are represented on The World Tribunal On Iraq , a self-appointed alliance of America loathers and anti-semites that has been holding "hearings" around the world to examine American and British "war crimes against the Iraqi people." The Tribunal's issued its "findings" last June, one of which was:

There is widespread opposition to the occupation. Political, social, and civil resistance through peaceful means is subjected to repression by the occupying forces. It is the occupation and its brutality that has provoked a strong armed resistance and certain acts of desperation. By the principles embodied in the UN Charter and in international law, the popular national resistance to the occupation is legitimate and justified. It deserves the support of people everywhere who care for justice and freedom.

Think about that one for a minute. Mother Sheehan and her pals have thrown in with the savages who murdered Casey Sheehan. Talk about your Stockholm syndrome.
But wait, isn't this guilt by association? Well, yes, it is. Guilt by association is propaganda when the association is fortuitous, ephemeral, passive, attenuated, remote. But when the association is real, active, knowing and deliberate an inference that a person shares her associates' goals and outlook is hardly irrational. Noscitur a sociis hasn't been a useful legal maxim since the Roman era for nothing.
