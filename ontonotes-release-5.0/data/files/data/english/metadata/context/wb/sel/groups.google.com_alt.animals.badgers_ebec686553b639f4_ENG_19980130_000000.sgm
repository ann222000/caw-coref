&gt; It brings me great pleasure and pride to announce the GRAND RE-OPENING OF

&gt; Thats right folks! I have purchased all rights and ownerships of the HFW
&gt; name and mark and after restructuring the HFW command heirarchy, I am
&gt; reopening the doors for public use.

I hereby declare myself Vice President in charge of Cluelessness.

&gt; We realize that there were a number of reasons leading up to the shutting
&gt; down of HFW back in November-- mismanagement, bestiality, illegal
&gt; activities, Bilbert being allowed to publicize it, Zoos repeatedly being
&gt; found masturbating into socks in the executive offices, etc.. It was
&gt; truly ludicrous. But we Meowers, in the spirit of our continuing drive
&gt; to better serve the citizens of Usenet, have focused our considerable
&gt; resources in BRINGING BACK HFW and making it the industry leader it was
&gt; meant to be.
&gt; Stay tuned for more news, folks!!!

By God, if American ingenuity and massive outside intervention could
bring back Chrysler, it can even bring HFW back from the dead. GOD BLESS
AMERICA! No more losing ground to Njorweenie imports!
