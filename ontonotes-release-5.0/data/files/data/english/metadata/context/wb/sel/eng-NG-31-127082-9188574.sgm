Hello Dames and Gents,

Yeap, its that friendly neighborhood superhero, Hardpan, once again
here to &quot;bug&quot; the hell out of you shybees :-)

(did ya' get the pun above? If so, you might have some hope, yet.)

Serious question: What is your intelligence quota?

My current working hypothesis is that most &quot;shybees&quot; tend towards
higher IQ levels, myself included, of course. &lt;bg&gt;

Anyone care to post some real numbers or are you &quot;too shy&quot; or &quot;it
doesn't matter&quot; to you responses.

&quot;Bring em' on !&quot; (another &quot;blast from the past&quot; pun.)

Above average, but nothing special. No Mensa club membership

IQ in itself doesn't mean much.

I doubt that you classify as a moron, Dan.

I agree with you, the &quot;quotient&quot; part of IQ really does feel like a

Maybe you do.  Or maybe since you feel inferior, you have to think of
something else that makes you feel that you are better than people who
don't suffer from shyness.
That seems to be the case with me.  I got this Goddamn inferiority/
superiority complex in my head that constantly wages war with myself.
Shit I'd love to have a high IQ no doubt, but Id much rather have

long time no see Hardpan!
I took an intelligence test many years ago, maybe 8 yrs ago, and
barely scored in the genius range. I think it was 143.
I do think IQ does represent something, and can give some insight into
a persons intelligence and knowledge. But I think it only measures
somewhere from 15-30% of total intelligence.(which really cant be
quantified anyways) Theres alot of smart, successful people who would
scored below average on an IQ test.

Doesn't really matter much anyway. My IQ is above average, like 125 or
130 and I graduated Summa.
To me, just as much, if not more important, is Emotional-Psychological
IQ.

what?

Mine would be high, because I'm really good at simple logic puzzles. As
worthless as IQ is (very), those online tests are even more worthless,
and I score extremely high on them. I think I got 170 on the last one I
took a couple of years ago, but I'm sure I wouldn't score that high on a
more &quot;official&quot; version. It's supposed to be distributed with a mean of
100 and a standard deviation of 15 and it's going to be extremely
difficult to measure something more than 1-2 standard deviations away
from the mean (even to the extent that the test and idea are completely
arbitrary and meaningless to begin with.)

On the other hand, I'm quite happy with being in the top 93rd percentile
in timed algorithm programming competitions at topcoder.com, and rising
quickly, since it's based among nerds who feel like it's something fun to
do to compete in algorithm programming problems to begin with.

So... you were never tested in high school or University?  You never
took the more &quot;official&quot; version?

Imo online tests are crap.  You can't gauge anything with twenty
questions and the ability to instantly and secretly check online
encyclopedias, dictionaries, etc., not to mention the opportunity to
take the thing as many times as you want.

The test I took twice in high school, my sophomore year and again my
senior year, and once again my 2nd year in Uni took the whole school day
(about 6-7 hours) excluding time for lunch.  All three were timed and
the teachers/professors wandered the test area the whole time making
sure no one spoke or cheated.  They didn't just cover simple logic but
several different areas - math, logic, language, reading speed and
comprehension, etc.  We were allowed to go in with two number two
pencils, nothing else, and were given one blank sheet of paper to write
on which was taken back before we left the testing room.

That's the type of test I think of when I hear the phrase 'IQ test'.

On the tests I took the highest I scored was 138 my sophomore year,
which put me in the 99th percentile in the nation compared to other
people my age who took the test that year.  It was explained to my
parents and I that this meant there were 1% of people in America who had
taken this test and showed better problem-solving ability/scored better
than I did.  One later testing I earned a lower score of 134.

They say you can have an average IQ (the American average this year was
something like 97 - correct me if I'm wrong, while the German average is
107), have a good work ethic and still be very successful in life, so as
far as a measurement of potential on that level I think those tests are
bunk.  As a measure of problem-solving potential I think they're more
accurate.

I have no clue what your IQ would be measured at using the test I took
but I'd guess it somewhere above 140.  I wouldn't put it above 150
because people with that kind of potential are rare, and I doubt they'd
be found hanging around on a Usenet newsgroup.

grades higher.  What the measurement means for adults is less clear; what

What in the world is problem solving potential?

IQ as far as I know is averaged at 100 by definition, and apparently in

higher scores, because people have been doing better and better. Does
this mean that people are getting more intelligent?

Robert Maas probably would have scored well over 150 on such a test. It's
really hard to overstate how impressive being in the top five in the
Putnam competition is. This puts him probably in the top 0.1% among
scientists and mathematicians who go on to post graduate studies. Is he
one of the smartest people you know of? Pepke claimed to have scored many
standard deviations above the mean on some kind of admissions test for a
special school as a kid, too. I think he's cool and special, but even I
don't think he's as cool and special as how he thinks of himself, heh.

IQ doesn't have a thing to do with potential. It's how well you score on
a certain kind of test.

I think any claim that it measures some kind of innate generalized
intelligence very well is absurd. I also claim that someone, over time,
could learn to do better on them. It might correlate to some things, as
SAT scores clearly do, but then you can look at almost anything and it
will correlate to things, for example how many books someone has read or
even what their hobbies are.

I'v read an interesting article in Wired about that :

=========================================================================== ========

Dome Improvement
Pop quiz: Why are IQ test scores rising around the globe? (Hint: Stop
reading the great authors and start playing Grand Theft Auto.)
By Steven Johnson

Twenty-three years ago, an American philosophy professor named James
Flynn discovered a remarkable trend: Average IQ scores in every
industrialized country on the planet had been increasing steadily for
decades. Despite concerns about the dumbing-down of society - the
failing schools, the garbage on TV, the decline of reading - the
overall population was getting smarter. And the climb has continued,
with more recent studies showing that the rate of IQ increase is
accelerating. Next to global warming and Moore's law, the so-called
Flynn effect may be the most revealing line on the increasingly
crowded chart of modern life - and it's an especially hopeful one. We
still have plenty of problems to solve, but at least there's one
consolation: Our brains are getting better at problem-solving.

Unless you happen to think the very notion of IQ is bunk. Anyone who
has read Stephen Jay Gould's The Mismeasure of Man or Howard Gardner's
work on multiple intelligences or any critique of The Bell Curve is
liable to dismiss IQ as merely phrenology updated, a pseudoscience
fronting for a host of racist and elitist ideologies that dare not
speak their names.

These critics attack IQ itself - or, more precisely, what intelligence
scholar Arthur Jensen called g, a measure of underlying &quot;general&quot;
intelligence. Psychometricians measure g by performing a factor
analysis of multiple intelligence tests and extracting a pattern of
correlation between the measurements. (IQ is just one yardstick.)
Someone with greater general intelligence than average should perform
better on a range of different tests.

Unlike some skeptics, James Flynn didn't just dismiss g as statistical
tap dancing. He accepted that something real was being measured, but
he came to believe that it should be viewed along another axis: time.
You can't just take a snapshot of g at one moment and make sense of
it, Flynn says. You have to track its evolution. He did just that.
Suddenly, g became much more than a measure of mental ability. It
revealed the rising trend line in intelligence test scores. And that,
in turn, suggested that something in the environment - some social or
cultural force - was driving the trend.

Significant intellectual breakthroughs - to paraphrase the John Lennon
song - are what happen when you're busy making other plans. So it was
with Flynn and his effect. He left the US in the early 1960s to teach
moral philosophy at the University of Otaga in New Zealand. In the
late '70s, he began exploring the intellectual underpinnings of racist
ideologies. &quot;And I thought: Oh, I can do a bit about the IQ
controversies,&quot; he says. &quot;And then I saw that Arthur Jensen, a scholar
of high repute, actually thought that blacks on average were
genetically inferior - which was quite a shock. I should say that
Jensen was beyond reproach - he's certainly not a racist. And so I
thought I'd better look into this.&quot;

This inquiry led to a 1980 book, Race, IQ, and Jensen, that posited an
environmental - not genetic - explanation for the black-white IQ gap.
After finishing the book, Flynn decided that he would look for
evidence that blacks were gaining on whites as their access to
education increased, and so he began studying US military records,
since every incoming member of the armed forces takes an IQ test.

Sure enough, he found that blacks were making modest gains on whites
in intelligence tests, confirming his environmental explanation. But
something else in the data caught his eye. Every decade or so, the
testing companies would generate new tests and re-normalize them so
that the average score was 100. To make sure that the new exams were
in sync with previous ones, they'd have a batch of students take both
tests. They were simply trying to confirm that someone who tested
above average on the new version would perform above average on the
old, and in fact the results confirmed that correlation. But the data
also brought to light another pattern, one that the testing companies
ignored. &quot;Every time kids took the new and the old tests, they did
better on the old ones,&quot; Flynn says. &quot;I thought: That's weird.&quot;

The testing companies had published the comparative data almost as an
afterthought. &quot;It didn't seem to strike them as interesting that the
kids were always doing better on the earlier test,&quot; he says. &quot;But I
was new to the area.&quot; He sent his data to the Harvard Educational
Review, which dismissed the paper for its small sample size. And so
Flynn dug up every study that had ever been done in the US where the
same subjects took a new and an old version of an IQ test. &quot;And lo and
behold, when you examined that huge collection of data, it revealed a
14-point gain between 1932 and 1978.&quot; According to Flynn's numbers, if
someone testing in the top 18 percent the year FDR was elected were to
time-travel to the middle of the Carter administration, he would score
at the 50th percentile.

When Flynn finally published his work in 1984, Jensen objected that
Flynn's numbers were drawing on tests that reflected educational
background. He predicted that the Flynn effect would disappear if one
were to look at tests - like the Raven Progressive Matrices - that
give a closer approximation of g, by measuring abstract reasoning and
pattern recognition and eliminating language altogether. And so Flynn
dutifully collected IQ data from all over the world. All of it showed
dramatic increases. &quot;The biggest of all were on Ravens,&quot; Flynn reports
with a hint of glee still in his voice.

The trend Flynn discovered in the mid-'80s has been investigated
extensively, and there's little doubt he's right. In fact, the Flynn
effect is accelerating. US test takers gained 17 IQ points between
1947 and 2001. The annual gain from 1947 through 1972 was 0.31 IQ
point, but by the '90s it had crept up to 0.36.

Though the Flynn effect is now widely accepted, its existence has in
turn raised new questions. The most fundamental: Why are measures of
intelligence going up? The phenomenon would seem to make no sense in
light of the evidence that g is largely an inherited trait. We're
certainly not evolving that quickly.

The classic heritability research paradigm is the twin adoption study:
Look at IQ scores for thousands of individuals with various forms of
shared genes and environments, and hunt for correlations. This is the
sort of chart you get, with 100 being a perfect match and 0 pure
randomness:

The same person tested twice: 87
Identical twins raised together: 86
Identical twins raised apart: 76
Fraternal twins raised together: 55
Biological siblings: 47
Parents and children living together: 40
Parents and children living apart: 31
Adopted children living together: 0
Unrelated people living apart: 0

After analyzing these shifting ratios of shared genes and the
environment for several decades, the consensus grew, in the '90s, that
heritability for IQ was around 0.6 - or about 60 percent. The two most
powerful indications of this are at the top and bottom of the chart:
Identical twins raised in different environments have IQs almost as
similar to each other as the same person tested twice, while adopted
children living together - shared environment, but no shared genes -
show no correlation. When you look at a chart like that, the evidence
for significant heritability looks undeniable.

Four years ago, Flynn and William Dickens, a Brookings Institution
economist, proposed another explanation, one made apparent to them by
the Flynn effect. Imagine &quot;somebody who starts out with a tiny little
physiological advantage: He's just a bit taller than his friends,&quot;
Dickens says. &quot;That person is going to be just a bit better at
basketball.&quot; Thanks to this minor height advantage, he tends to enjoy
pickup basketball games. He goes on to play in high school, where he
gets excellent coaching and accumulates more experience and skill.
&quot;And that sets up a cycle that could, say, take him all the way to the
NBA,&quot; Dickens says.

Now imagine this person has an identical twin raised separately. He,
too, will share the height advantage, and so be more likely to find
his way into the same cycle. And when some imagined basketball
geneticist surveys the data at the end of that cycle, he'll report
that two identical twins raised apart share an off-the-charts ability
at basketball. &quot;If you did a genetic analysis, you'd say: Well, this
guy had a gene that made him a better basketball player,&quot; Dickens
says. &quot;But the fact is, that gene is making him 1 percent better, and
the other 99 percent is that because he's slightly taller, he got all
this environmental support.&quot; And what goes for basketball goes for
intelligence: Small genetic differences get picked up and magnified in
the environment, resulting in dramatically enhanced skills. &quot;The
heritability studies weren't wrong,&quot; Flynn says. &quot;We just
misinterpreted them.&quot;

Dickens and Flynn showed that the environment could affect heritable
traits like IQ, but one mystery remained: What part of our allegedly
dumbed-down environment is making us smarter? It's not schools, since
the tests that measure education-driven skills haven't shown the same
steady gains. It's not nutrition - general improvement in diet leveled
off in most industrialized countries shortly after World War II,

If it's one based on a normal curve, 185 is supposed to be between 5 and 6
standard deviations of the mean. This is associated with probabilities

really good day guessing on multiple choice questions, for instance.

If it means in the opinion of some dumb person, someone in preschool is
doing profound mental things normally associated with grade 3, well I guess
I can buy it.

Because real life success is the most important - not the score you

Some of the most successful people in life (in terms of good health,

If someone from the early part of the century took an adult IQ test
today, they'd score about 80. This is supported fact, see that post by
busyloner. IQ is just not a good indicator of a genetic predisposition to
intelligence, and can be affected profoundly by environment. If someone
isn't good at looking at three squiggly diagrams and choosing the next
one in sequence, is doesn't mean their brains aren't good at something
else.

Anyway, if what you say is true, you'd expect scores on IQ tests not to
be rising in every industrialized country in the world consistently
throught the 20th century, whereas they have been, and a lot.

&gt; &gt; I got myself tested in my early 20s and received a score of 134. I
&gt; &gt; admit to doing two or three practice tests beforehand. I believe the
&gt; &gt; exam is one valid tile in the mosaic of human intelligence.

They did not weigh me when they determined I was 5'8&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sweet.  Someone else in this thread--Lisa, maybe--claimed a 134.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe we need to start our own club?  The 134 Club.  We can have our
&gt;&gt;&gt; own talk show, and Lisa can do a 3000 pound leg press or something.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It'll be fun!  :D

&gt;&gt; I claim a 138 twice and a 134 once which makes my average
&gt;&gt; 136.6.

&gt; I'm going to go ahead and subtract 14.3 for you bothering to do that
&gt; weighted average. That puts you at 122.3, still pretty good.

I'm going to subtract 8.4 from you for bothering to bother me with this
reply.  Then I'm going to subtract 2.7 because you failed to realize I
wasn't serious.

You just lost another 7.1 points for failing to see my point. This puts you
at 115.2. You just lost the potential ability to do trigonometry.
