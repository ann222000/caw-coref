Airline travel can be a nightmare for the large person. Small seats and
aisles, the long walk from the check-in area to the gate, and the frequent
insensitivity of passengers and crew can all contribute to an unpleasant
flying experience. But with careful planning, your flight can be safe and
enjoyable. Follow the guidelines listed below in order to maximize your
comfort while flying.

BOOK CAREFULLY - Book your flight carefully, avoiding &quot;rush-hour&quot; air time.
Take advantage of &quot;red-eye special&quot; deals, where the plane is less likely
to be full . The chance of the seat next to yours remaining empty is 0% if
you are flying out of LAX at 0 600 on a Monday morning.
EMPTY SEAT - Tell the airline that you are large and ask that the seat next
to yours remain empty if at all possible. The worst the airline can do is
say &quot;No&quot;, but most airlines will at least attempt to accommodate.
BELT EXTENSIONS - Request a seat-belt extension when you book your flight,
and/or ask for one when you board the plane. Do not wait for the flight
attendant's animated safety speech to discuss this need.
SEAT SIZE - When you book your flight ask specifically for the seat
measurements of the plane you will be on. Explain your need and ask for the
largest seat in your section of the plane. Even one inch can make a big
difference.
AISLE OR WINDOW - Request a seat assignment for the aisle or window, where
you will I have a little more room, and make sure that you don't have a
bulkhead seat. While you have more leg-room in bulkhead, the armrests in
the bulkhead do not raise, and the tray tables come out of the armrest
across your lap. Supersize flyers might wish to request an aisle seat in a
row where the outside armrests are movable, making it easier to slide into
the row.
PRE-BOARD - Even mid-size people have trouble squeezing down the
micro-sized center aisle of most planes, and this task is even more
difficult the plane is already plump with passengers. For this reason, you
should preboard the plane with the rest of the passengers who need extra
time in boarding. The gate agent probably won't hassle you, but if she
asks, just say that you're a large person and need a little extra time.
ARMREST UP - When you get to your seat during pre-boarding, raise the
armrest between seats. This may give you the inch or two of extra space you
need. The chances are that the passenger who will be seated next to you
won't say anything; if he does, smile pleasantly and say that you'll both
be more comfortable if the armrest is up.
RESTROOMS - Use the airport restroom before boarding your plane. Ask when
booking your trip if handicapped facilities are available on your
particular flight. If not, you may want to change your plans and fly on a
plane equipped with an accessible restroom.
TRAY-TABLE - If you cannot bring down the tray-table, have the flight
attendant ask the passenger in front of you to put their seat to the full
upright position for mealtime. If this doesn't help, set a pillow on your
lap, and your meal tray on the pillow.
DO THE BUMP - Consider being bumped voluntarily. Not only can this be
extremely profitable for fat frequent flyers (see related article), but
your chances of being re-assigned to a partially full plane are greatly
enhanced. You won't mind the inconvenience of an odd departure/arrival time
if your next trip by air is at a greatly reduced price.
SECOND SEAT - If you have purchased a second seat for comfort, be sure to
let the flight attendant know as you board the plane. This will avoid
embarrassment, as an ignorant flight attendant may try to fill your second
seat.
EXIT ROW SEAT - The exit-row seats over the wings of most planes have
considerably more leg room than the rest of the seats in economy class.
While FM regulations state that exit-row seating may be denied to fat
passengers, requesting an exit-row seat may be a viable option for fat
people who are tall and those with reasonably good health and mobility.
GATE TRANSPORTATION - It's usually a long walk between curbside check-in
and the gate, or between gates when you have connecting flights. When
making your reservations, make sure to tell the agent if you will need
special services, such as the airport tra m or an armless wheelchair and
attendant.
The most important thing to remember is that you have the right to fly
anywhere you want to go. Your needs deserve to be met, but it may be up to
you to remind them of this simple fact. If you experience problems despite
your precautions, write a letter of complaint to the airline. Remember, you
have a right to accessible transportation.

It's probably true that ANYONE can lose weight, but there can be many
factors (required medications, physical disability, etc.) that make it
exceedingly difficult for some. (And losing large amounts of weight -
100 pounds or more - probably takes more dedication and determination
than the average human being is capable of sustaining for the length of
time required.) Few of us attain the &quot;anorexic&quot; look that seems to be
de riguer for comfort on some airplanes nowadays, but most of us are not
SERIOUSLY overweight, and losing a few pounds before a vacation is
generally desireable, anyway (especially if one enjoys food, and looks
forward to sampling the cuisine of one's European destination). But
please remember that not every really &quot;fat&quot; person is so from choice,
his/her reason to travel may not be for pleasure (and is most certainly
not just to inconvenience YOU), and realistic advice about making their
trip less miserable for them is not something to be scoffed at.

Should we shrink people down also.
The average height of a person has really went up.
Look at older pictures and look at families. Most of the youth is
the biggest in his/her family.
We live longer too but I dont think we should wack anyone.
The world will always have to make changes to accomodate
new findings and advances. Fat people do in some ways have a
choice but I think airlines, restuarants, manufactures, and service
providers
should offer adequate means to enjoy their services. If not they will lose
business.
I havent seen any bullying anywhere but 1000 fat people demonstrating looks
like 400-500 skinny people demonstrating. We could raise the temp a degree
or two if we had a million fat person march.

&gt;&gt;trip less miserable for them is not something to be scoffed at.

&gt; I am no longer young but I remember that as a young person I didn't
&gt; have a real weight problem nor did many of my contemporaries.

&gt; This was probably a combination of good home cooking and the fact that
&gt; I played sports and walked just about everywhere (we didn't have a
&gt; family car let alone one car for every member of the family).

&gt; Over the years I have seen my weight rise but I repeatedly take steps
&gt; to manage this when it goes over my (personally set) limit.

&gt; I am very well aware, as most of us are, of the challenges of losing
&gt; weight. Motivation is the key and this can be very hard to find in
&gt; today's pressured and fast paced lifestyle.

&gt; As long as manufacturers, service providers, restaurants, airlines,
&gt; whoever, are going to be bullied and legislated into catering for
&gt; very fat people, there will be even less motivation for them to lose
&gt; weight.

&gt; I have empathy with anyone who is unhappy about their weight and I
&gt; recognise the difficulties of finding the motivation to change. I
&gt; have sympathy, too, for those who are caught in the addiction of food
&gt; or the spiralling depression of weight gain. (but I also have
&gt; thoughts for those squashed in the seats beside them ).

&gt; IMO those who campaign and legislate or even just &quot;promote&quot; obesity
&gt; as a normal or desirable state of being are influencing other people's
&gt; lives in a detrimental way. I do not share this viewpoint.

&gt; I would wish instead that they would encourage and support very fat
&gt; people to lose weight in order that they might enjoy a safer and more
&gt; enjoyable life.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As age and obesity overtake you, may you live to eat those
uncharitable
&gt;&gt;&gt; words! (Few really heavy people &quot;choose&quot; to be so - only the truly
&gt;&gt;&gt; ignorant assume that it is ALWAYS gluttony that makes them so!) And
no,
&gt;&gt;&gt; FYI, I am NOT among the seriously obese - I just have a little more
&gt;&gt;&gt; education about nutrition that you do, obviously.

&gt;&gt; I'm already 42, and I can say with almost absolute certainty that
obesity
&gt;&gt; will never overtake me.

&gt; Forty-two, eh? Give it another ten years, and see if you can make the
&gt; same claim! (It might happen sooner, if you suffer some sort of
&gt; accident or develop an illness that prevents your engaging in physical
&gt; activity at your present level.) Why do the young always assume
&gt; they're immortal, and imune to the ills of the flesh?

&gt;&gt; I also seriously doubt that you know very much about
&gt;&gt; nutrition.

&gt; Since YOU obviously know nothing, I undoubtedly know more about it than
&gt; you do. There's no point in wasting any more bandwidth - ignorance can
&gt; be cured, but stupidity like yours is congenital! (P-L-O-N-K)

"/> Oh great, a hit and run.

Just in case you're still reading this, some people will never be obese like
you because they have self control. Deal with the reality. Or kill yourself
for the good of society.

When *I* find a chef that has skills better then me I enjoy and savor what I
eat. However, the sad truth is that many restaurants charge outrageous
prices for foods that I can cook better.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I have observed grossly fat people eating on many occasions. Most of
&gt; them shovel the food into their maw with little pause for chewing or
&gt; tasting. Were I the chef, and took some pride in my cooking skills,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Your other analogies of tall or ageing people do not adequately equate

You want the armrest up so that you can spill over into my seat space
that I paid for??

I know EXACTLY what I would tell you if you tried something like that
while seated next to me....

and I would even smile pleasantly while telling you.

&gt; Where's your .JPEGs, Darth Choadley Chaney?
&gt; Where's proof you're some svelte badass?
&gt; Where's proof you sued a telemarketer?
&gt; Where's proof you hired a private investigator to track down a

&gt; Where's proof you're married?
&gt; Where's proof you've sired another of your genetically deficit
&gt; bloodline?
&gt; Prove even *one* of your self-aggrandizing prevarications?
&gt; Steve Chaney, YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ok fucknut. You're such a badass with all the computer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;skills, track me down

&gt; Somewhere in Arizona? Phoenix Metro area? Either that or you're
&gt; spending long-distance money to hit an AT&amp;T dial-up server
&gt; thereabouts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and come visit.

&gt; Steve's far too much of a chickenshit to visit anyone he badmouths;
&gt; he just lies about people a lot and then claims he lies about people
&gt; and forges their posts on the basis of his &quot;moral superiority&quot;.
&gt; He's sorta comedic, in a very petty and sad sorta way.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Let's do lunch.

&gt; Now there you *might* have a plan; &quot;Lunch&quot; is Steve's middle name.
&gt; Leave a trail of Steve's favorite fruit, the ever-popular BurgerKing
&gt; Whoppers, in a path to your door. Then it's just a matter of whether
&gt; Steve's gluttony can outweigh his cowardice (&quot;fat chance&quot; would be an
&gt; apropos expression at this juncture).
&gt; I once offered Steve free beer and Twinkies if he'd come visit;
&gt; 'twas some few years ago and still he's a no-show. Several people
&gt; have offered to visit Steve so he doesn't have squeeze his lumpy ass
&gt; out the door of his mom's basement but Steve has been somewhat less
&gt; than forthcoming about his own address despite his propensity to post
&gt; other people's personal details - no doubt due to Steve's alleged
&gt;&quot;moral superiority&quot; again.
&gt; You may have a better shot at a visit from Steve than I but only
&gt; 'cuz Phoenix is a lot closer to Sacramento than Philadelphia is.
&gt; I recommend spacing those Whoopers out pretty closely.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Why on earth would he WANT to? You seem to be singularly
&gt;&gt;&gt;lacking in charm (or any other quality that might prompt
&gt;&gt;&gt;anyone to seek your acquaintance)!
&gt;&gt;I figure maybe he just wants to hang out and talk shit.

&gt; That's all he does is talk the talk - but he can only waddle the
&gt; walk.

&gt;&gt;And maybe call people punks to their face.

&gt; Not much hope on that front. Gasoline prices make shipping that
&gt; much flatbed freight an expensive ordeal.

&gt;&gt;It might be a fun thing.

&gt; Only if you invite William SHATner too.

Come into the house, Steve!&quot; she doesn't get one.
All twenty-three Steves of hers come on the run!
This makes things quite difficult at the McKeeves'
As you can imagine, with so many Steves.

And often she wishes that, when they were hatching,
She had named one of them Fatfuck Crack Scratching.
And one of them LAXboy. And one of them Loser.
And one of them Phoney. And one Retard Schmoozer.
And one of them Monkey. And one Skin Donation.
And one of them Sockboy. And one Breast Inflation.
Another one Fat Butt. Another one Mullet.

And one of them Pigboy. And one Mastahplan.
One Gaping Maw. And one Calloused Right Hand.
And one of them Sleazy. And one Know It All.
And one William B. Williams. And one Where's My Balls?
And one of them I Make 6 Figures Per Year.
And one of them I Will Buy Dutton A Beer.
And one of them Brad Pitt Sux Give Me A Date...

I know you and your friends respond to everything I say EXCEPT this, so
bear it in silence and agony.

You really ought to stop bragging on usenet about your chivalrous martial
arts hero yojimbo bullshit and find out why it is that people stand around
watching you crawl to the emergency room and don't life a finger to help.

It's because people hate you so much in the real world that they were
hoping and praying out loud that you dropped dead on the way to the
hospital.

Your life sucks, Mike. It sucks so bad that you have to rip off photos off
of porno sites and call them shots of your make-believe girlfriend. It
sucks so bad that no one wants to get you medical help when you piss people
off and get shot. Twice, as you claimed.

Then again everything you said about being shot, and about crawling 11
blocks to the emergency room, could be a fabrication just like your stories
about your sex life.

Sit down and shut up, or I'll remind everyone about your pathetic life
again and make you look like the lying rejected unwanted phoneyfuck that
you are.

&gt; Hardly a fitting &quot;call&quot; from one of Usenet's biggest liars and

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most of you punks talking that crap are nowhere near that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;image of relative perfection in real life.

&gt; Where's your .JPEGs, Darth Choadley Chaney?
&gt; Where's proof you're some svelte badass?
&gt; Where's proof you sued a telemarketer?
&gt; Where's proof you hired a private investigator to track down a
&gt;girlfriend after some 6-8 years after it was way over?
&gt; Where's proof you're married?
&gt; Where's proof you've sired another of your genetically deficit
&gt;bloodline?
&gt; Prove even *one* of your self-aggrandizing prevarications?
&gt; Steve Chaney, YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ok fucknut. You're such a badass with all the computer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;skills, track me down

&gt; Somewhere in Arizona? Phoenix Metro area? Either that or you're
&gt;spending long-distance money to hit an AT&amp;T dial-up server
&gt;thereabouts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and come visit.

&gt; Steve's far too much of a chickenshit to visit anyone he badmouths;
&gt;he just lies about people a lot and then claims he lies about people
&gt;and forges their posts on the basis of his &quot;moral superiority&quot;.
&gt; He's sorta comedic, in a very petty and sad sorta way.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Let's do lunch.

&gt; Now there you *might* have a plan; &quot;Lunch&quot; is Steve's middle name.
&gt;Leave a trail of Steve's favorite fruit, the ever-popular BurgerKing
&gt;Whoppers, in a path to your door. Then it's just a matter of whether
&gt;Steve's gluttony can outweigh his cowardice (&quot;fat chance&quot; would be an
&gt;apropos expression at this juncture).
&gt; I once offered Steve free beer and Twinkies if he'd come visit;
&gt;'twas some few years ago and still he's a no-show. Several people
&gt;have offered to visit Steve so he doesn't have squeeze his lumpy ass
&gt;out the door of his mom's basement but Steve has been somewhat less
&gt;than forthcoming about his own address despite his propensity to post
&gt;other people's personal details - no doubt due to Steve's alleged
&gt;&quot;moral superiority&quot; again.
&gt; You may have a better shot at a visit from Steve than I but only
&gt;'cuz Phoenix is a lot closer to Sacramento than Philadelphia is.
&gt; I recommend spacing those Whoopers out pretty closely.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Why on earth would he WANT to? You seem to be singularly
&gt;&gt;&gt;lacking in charm (or any other quality that might prompt
&gt;&gt;&gt;anyone to seek your acquaintance)!
&gt;&gt;I figure maybe he just wants to hang out and talk shit.

&gt; That's all he does is talk the talk - but he can only waddle the
&gt;walk.

&gt;&gt;And maybe call people punks to their face.

&gt; Not much hope on that front. Gasoline prices make shipping that
&gt;much flatbed freight an expensive ordeal.

&gt;&gt;It might be a fun thing.

&gt; Only if you invite William SHATner too.

"/> The airline is a private company which hires people to make
those decisions. If the airline hires you, you can make a different
decision.

Perhaps the airline would rather not have victimized passengers
complaining about &quot;large&quot; passengers encroaching on them during
the flight, because this might create a disturbance and embarrass
the people involved.

Many people have been conditioned by society to avoid directly
confronting everybody who gets in their way. It's perfectly
appropriate to address a problem later as Janet El's sister
did. The sister was crammed right next to the &quot;large&quot; passenger---
if the flight was crowded and the flight attendants were busy,
how could the sister have voiced her complaint without making
the &quot;large&quot; passenger aware of her disgust? If the sister did not
want to subject the &quot;large&quot; passenger to embarrassment, I'd say
that was a courteous gesture.

The airline absorbs the cost of the free ticket as part of the
economic tradeoff it accepted by choosing the seat size. The
airline could reduce encroaching incidents by enlarging the
seats, but larger seats mean fewer seats and less ticket revenue.
So basically there is some bean counter deciding how often you
have a &quot;large&quot; passenger spilling into your seat.

The frequency of passenger space conflicts is a function of
the size distribution of passengers, the size of the seats, and
the load factor (percentage of occupied seats) on flights. Airlines
do a lot of analysis to determine the economically optimal seat size.
They know in advance they will create a certain rate of encroaching
incidents, and they budget for these.

The real question is why the flight attendants did not pro-actively
look around at the passengers and see who might be uncomfortably
crammed next to an encroaching &quot;large&quot; passenger. The airline
assigns passengers to seats. The airline has the passenger manifest
and knows when two people in adjacent seats are not traveling
together. The flight attendants should find all the passengers who
are crammed next to an encroaching large stranger and discreetly
ask them if they would like to move. It's not the passenger's job
to have to plead for the whole seat she paid for, during the flight.

Airlines already offer discounts to passengers who agree to get
bumped from crowded flights. Why not offer similar discounts to
small passengers who don't mind wedging in next to &quot;large&quot; passengers
who spill over the seatrest? Not everybody finds such encroachment
equally annoying. Some people might even like to have a giant
soft gently heaving pillow to lean against during the flight.

As the obesity epidemic continues to balloon, and airline seats
remain fixed in size, airlines must find a formula to negotiate
more of these passenger space conflicts.

Of course the fat person would have to pay more for their seat. The airline
cannot be expected to be penalised by a loss of revenue by having fat people
take up more space that normally sized people. Flying fat people take more
fuel etc so it makes sense.

There is another more important issue which suggests fat people should not
be allowed to fly in certain aircraft for safety reasons. I always try and
have either an aisle seat or an emergency exit window seat. I am horrified
at times to see a very fat person struggling to get into their seat and
imagine how many people would fail to evacuate the plane in an emergency. In
this context fat people pose a real rise to others.

&gt; It's always possible. One might infer from the posting of the sister that

"/> Very few people articulate every sensation of disgust they feel

Bobbi Sanchez, would you really want to live in a world where
everyone told you exactly how you are making them feel?

If humans could easily read each other's thoughts, I'm not
sure if civilization could survive. Most marriages, for example,
would instantly get shakier. Most people need to maintain
their comforting illusions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; There is nothing wrong with asking to be moved if she
&gt;&gt; is uncomfortable, or asking someone to lower the armrest.

"/> It's not a question of &quot;wrong,&quot; it's a question of risk.

There is no way to predict how a complete stranger will react
in a confrontation. That is why most people have the good sense
to approach strangers with some caution. People who know each
other well may trade insults casually, or tell each other what
to do, but strangers meeting each other for the first time
rarely do that unless they are looking for a fight.

When you see someone who blatantly rejects at least one
rule of common courtesy, you have to wonder what other rules
of behavior that person will reject.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The decent
&gt;&gt; person will say: they can't because it is uncomfortable and then the
&gt;&gt; sister can move with not feelings hurt.

&gt; Exactly. That way, all people can be accommodated.

"/> It's interesting that you put all the responsibility on the victim.
Who, we should recall, was physically MUCH SMALLER than the aggressor.
If someone three times your size begins squashing you, without
asking for permission first, you already know you are dealing
with a person who rejects common courtesy. Who knows what other
aggressive tendencies that person might have?

Why shouldn't the aggressor take responsibility? If someone is
too large for the seat he or she paid for, and must intrude into
another customer's seat, it would be common courtesy for the
intruder to ask the person intruded upon if the intrusion is OK.

Suppose a woman boards a crowded subway car and a man she does
not know begins groping her. If the woman is too shocked or
terrified to speak, does that make his groping OK?

Or do we usually assume that before you violate another person's
space, you need to ask for and get permission?

The general rule is you ASK before taking something that belongs
to someone else.

That's the general rule well-socialized adults follow. We
aren't like preschoolers who just grab anything we see that we
want.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> Overly simplistic, IMO. I'm partially sighted, and have to use public
transport, driving simply isn't an option for me. What I'm looking for
in a train service is efficiency first and comfort second. So far, the
carrier I use the most (Virgin rail, which I use every month to visit an
elderly relative) can manage neither efficiency nor comfort, even when
I'm in a seat with nobody next to me. The trains are late and dirty -
in 11 of the last twelve journeys I've taken either the train out or
back was late, and during the summer some didn't run at all. The
toilets are always disgusting. Next to that, sitting next to a fat
person becomes what it is - a minor irritation.

"/> This is really the crucial question, isn't it? Everything else is just a
discussion of what people would do to avoid this situation.

There are a few possibilities. Let's further assume there are no free seats
available in the same service class.

1) The airline could get involved.

a) The airline could tell the smaller person to shut up.
b) The airline could tell the larger person to buy another seat or get
off.
c) The airline could upgrade the smaller person.
d) The airline could upgrade the larger person.
e) The airline could compensate the smaller person after the fact.

2) The airline could stay out of it.

a) The smaller person could claim a tort and attempt to sue the larger
person.
b) The smaller person could claim a tort and attempt to sue the airline.
c) The smaller person could spend the whole flight pushing back
physically.
d) The smaller person could take verbal action (insults, appeals to
shame, whatever) that compels the larger person to leave the plane.
e) The smaller person could take physical action (assault) that compels
the larger person to leave the plane.
f) Third parties could rearrange themselves to accommodate (perhaps
parents who have paid for a seat for their child could have that child
sit next to the larger person)

Which of these is optimal for the greatest number of people? Which is
optimal when levels of responsibility for the situation (large person not
exercising, airline making tiny seats, small person being hypersensitive,
etc.) are taken into account along some sort of value scale?

&gt; It's not a question of &quot;wrong,&quot; it's a question of risk.

&gt; There is no way to predict how a complete stranger will react
&gt; in a confrontation. That is why most people have the good sense
&gt; to approach strangers with some caution. People who know each
&gt; other well may trade insults casually, or tell each other what
&gt; to do, but strangers meeting each other for the first time
&gt; rarely do that unless they are looking for a fight.

&gt; When you see someone who blatantly rejects at least one
&gt; rule of common courtesy, you have to wonder what other rules
&gt; of behavior that person will reject.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The decent
&gt;&gt;&gt; person will say: they can't because it is uncomfortable and then the
&gt;&gt;&gt; sister can move with not feelings hurt.

&gt;&gt; Exactly. That way, all people can be accommodated.

&gt; It's interesting that you put all the responsibility on the victim.
&gt; Who, we should recall, was physically MUCH SMALLER than the aggressor.
&gt; If someone three times your size begins squashing you, without
&gt; asking for permission first, you already know you are dealing
&gt; with a person who rejects common courtesy. Who knows what other
&gt; aggressive tendencies that person might have?

&gt; Why shouldn't the aggressor take responsibility? If someone is
&gt; too large for the seat he or she paid for, and must intrude into
&gt; another customer's seat, it would be common courtesy for the
&gt; intruder to ask the person intruded upon if the intrusion is OK.

&gt; Suppose a woman boards a crowded subway car and a man she does
&gt; not know begins groping her. If the woman is too shocked or
&gt; terrified to speak, does that make his groping OK?

&gt; Or do we usually assume that before you violate another person's
&gt; space, you need to ask for and get permission?

&gt; The general rule is you ASK before taking something that belongs
&gt; to someone else.

&gt; That's the general rule well-socialized adults follow. We
&gt; aren't like preschoolers who just grab anything we see that we
&gt; want.

&gt;&gt; But to wait until after the flight to complain.... ::shakes head::

&gt; Are you also shaking your head about the large intruder waiting forever
&gt; to ask whether his or her intrusion was causing a problem?

&gt; Actually, many have shown that the increase in height correlates with the

The difference is that once people are old enough to really think about it,
it's quite hard to eat oneself into being taller or shorter.

&gt;&gt; If someone is
&gt;&gt; too large for the seat he or she paid for,

&gt; Curious you should put it like that. I had always understood that in
&gt; many travelling situations (not sure about planes where a seat is
&gt; required, but am reasonably sure that in my country it's true of trains
&gt; and possibly of buses) you haven't paid for a seat unless you have
&gt; specifically requested (and sometimes also paid for) a seat reservation.
&gt; What you have paid for is to be carried from point A to point B as
&gt; specified on the ticket. That's all.

&gt; Your discomfort, the fact that you have had to stand for four or five
&gt; hours from (say) London to Glasgow, or were sat next to a someone who
&gt; stinks and/or is drunk, or sat next to a fat person, or someone who
&gt; insisted on talking, or &lt;insert uncomfortable situation here&gt; is not the
&gt; problem of the carrier.

"/> Sitting next to, sure.

However, I do believe it is reasonable to expect that my seat does not get
invaded by the spill over from the seat beside mine. Likewise, I expect
the armrest to be shared in a polite manner. Expect *from the airline*
that is.

(I have no business relationship with the passenger next to me. My deal
is with the airline.)

&gt; And if the person says &quot;no, the intrusion is not ok&quot; what should the larger
&gt; person do? Offer to cut off one of their legs?

"/> In general, economic justice is maximized when people pay for what
they consume. A large person who consumes some of a small person's
seat should pay for a proportional fraction of the small person's
ticket. This transaction should be voluntary: no small person
should be compelled to sell part of his or her seat if he or she
does not want to. Airlines might set up an exchange system where
large passengers bid in advance to be seated next to those small
passengers willing to be squeezed either for nothing or in
proportion to the amount of their seat they are giving up.

If insufficiently many small persons are willing to be squeezed,
the large passengers who get outbid by other large passengers for the
available willing squeezees would have to upgrade to first class.

So basically we are talking about how many large persons on a
given flight might be able to save some of the cost of buying
first-class tickets.

Consider what the large person is doing. Larger seats are available
in first class; by choosing not to purchase a first-class ticket, the
large person is saving the price difference between first class and
the ticket he or she bought. However, to obtain this savings, the
large person imposes what the economists call an &quot;external cost&quot; onto
the adjacent passenger who has to give up a portion of the seat
he or she paid for, to accommodate the large person's spillover.

External costs are a common problem for any free-market economic
system, because free markets are generally only capable of allocating
direct costs. A familiar example is industrial pollution. A manufacturing
concern has to pay for labor, materials, energy, real estate, licensing,
and so on, but nobody owns the air it spews smoke into. Therefore
in an unregulated economy, manufacturing concerns will tend to spew lots
of smoke. To keep the air clean, governments must intervene by
mandating emission control.

The same principle applies to individual litterbugs. You have to
pay McDonalds for a Big Mac and supersized fries and drink, but
you don't have to pay for permission to throw the wrappers on the
roadside. Therefore roadsides tend to festooned with trash, unless
a government vigorously polices litterbugs.

In the airline seating example, the large person &quot;feels&quot; the direct
cost of the seat: a large seat costs the large person more than
a small seat. The large person does not &quot;feel&quot; the cost he or she
might impose on an adjacent passenger by spilling into his or her
seat.

To restore proper economic justice, an outside authority must
intervene in the market to insure the large person &quot;feels&quot;
the full costs of his or her decision. One way to do that would be
to require the large person to pay some money to the spilled-upon
passenger, and to bid for the services of a small passenger
willing to be spilled-upon. It may be possible for large and
small passengers to negotiate deals they find mutually beneficial:
a large passenger could save part of the cost of upgrading to
first class, and a small passenger could avoid having to pay for
extra seat space he or she does not really need.

The beauty of free markets is that they tend to find the optimal
assignment of buyers to sellers, so the minimum number of people
get forced into deals they especially dislike. A free market's
ability to do this depends on the capacity of buyers and sellers
to exchange accurate information about what the buyers want to
buy, how much they want it, what the sellers have for sale, and
how much they want to sell it for.

All the small people on the airplane are individuals, with slightly
different preferences. Some may not mind wedging next to a large
passenger in exchange for a small discount on their seat, whereas
others might value their seat space much more.

Airlines already do something similar with &quot;bumping.&quot; Because there
are always some last-minute ticket cancellations, airlines have an
incentive to overbook flights to insure high load factors and thus
higher ticket revenue. However, if a flight is overbooked by X
passengers and fewer than X passengers cancel, some people won't be
able to board. Airlines handle this problem by offering passengers
discounts on their tickets if they agree to be bumped first in the
event of an overbooking. Passengers who can afford to risk a flight
delay may find the discount attractive.

Airlines could set up a similar system to negotiate seating
conflicts with large passengers. Allow the coach passengers to
indicate their willingness to sit next to a large passenger who
doesn't want to pay for a first class ticket. Offer the squeezed
passengers a small incentive, perhaps a discount equal to a fraction
of the large passenger's savings. Make the large passenger pay for
it.

One problem with such a system would be the requirement of
determining passenger sizes accurately. A large person would
obviously have an economic incentive to understate his or her size
to avoid having to pay extra for it. So it might be difficult,
with currently available technology, to collect all the information
necessary to set up an efficient market.

It may be cheaper for airlines to hand out free tickets to the
relatively small number of squeezed passengers who complain
after their flights.

&gt;&gt; This is really the crucial question, isn't it? Everything else is just a
&gt;&gt; discussion of what people would do to avoid this situation.

&gt;&gt; There are a few possibilities. Let's further assume there are no free seats
&gt;&gt; available in the same service class.

&gt;&gt; 1) The airline could get involved.

&gt;&gt; a) The airline could tell the smaller person to shut up.
&gt;&gt; b) The airline could tell the larger person to buy another seat or get
&gt;&gt; off.
&gt;&gt; c) The airline could upgrade the smaller person.
&gt;&gt; d) The airline could upgrade the larger person.
&gt;&gt; e) The airline could compensate the smaller person after the fact.

&gt; f) The airline could move the larger person next to a child.
&gt; g) The airline could move the smaller person into a different seat.

&gt; Both of which make more sense than a, b, c, d, or e.

"/> Separating and inconveniencing others based on someone who won't fit
makes zero sense to anyone, especially the airline.

The problem is the overweight passenger, not the people who sit next to
them.

I did see recently a man who was *extremely* obese on a NW flight, they
placed him in a bulkhead row, raised the armrest and he took up two full
seats. He was moved from somewhere else on the plane, so it was
obviously an afterthought.

Wow...I've read this whole thread and it's just amazing to me how much
ignorance and hate exist in this sorry world.

I just want to make some quick points:

1. It's been proven that fat people, as a group, eat no more or less
than thin people, as a group. The idea that fat people overeat is an
antiquated idea and a myth.

2. Generalizing about why fat people are fat is just asinine. People
come in all sizes, shapes, and colors. Some fat people are indeed fat
because of lifestyle and many others are fat because they are
biologically meant to be and still others are fat because of a medical
condition.

So...now that we have that out of the way...

No, it isn't fair to make fat people pay more for a first class seat
or pay for two seats. I know thin people who've complained about how
small airplane seats are. The airline industry wants to make as much
money as they can so they make the seats incredibly tiny and don't
allow much leg room. Nobody is comfortable, but the CEO's are happy
as clams.

As far as not wanting to sit next to a fat person...you have the right
to feel that way.

I, myself...don't like to sit next to smokers (because of the smell),
small, crying children, or people who talk too much.

But you know who I REALLY don't want to sit next to? Adulterers,
bigots, fundamentalists, or just plain mean people. But I don't have
that choice, do I?

So...life sucks. Grin and bear it.

I don't support or condone all this fat-bashing. But I don't think you're
helping anyone by claiming that obesity is in most cases some magic curse
out of the control of its victims or their parents. The fact that Americans
(and lately they are seeing competition from Australia and a few others) are
far more likely to be obese than people of other countries with similar
plentiful availability of food makes it pretty clear that either they're a
different species, or behavior and culture figure in somehow. Take control.
Don't be a helpless victim of the condition.

It's never been proven that fat people eat the same as thin people. What has
been proven is that when fat people are put in a metabolic chamber and their
diet is controlled, they lose weight just as would be expected with the rest
of the population. This shows that fat people have no realistic idea of how
much food they are shoving down their throats.

&gt;&gt;Why should the airline have to pay because your sister didn't bother

&gt; Perhaps the sister is one of those who would rather hide and call fat

&gt;1. It's been proven that fat people, as a group, eat no more or less
&gt;than thin people, as a group. The idea that fat people overeat is an
&gt;antiquated idea and a myth.

"/> Do you have a reputable study to cite here?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;2. Generalizing about why fat people are fat is just asinine. People
&gt;come in all sizes, shapes, and colors. Some fat people are indeed fat
&gt;because of lifestyle and many others are fat because they are
&gt;biologically meant to be and still others are fat because of a medical
&gt;condition.

"/> Did you just generalize about why fat people are fat?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;So...now that we have that out of the way...
&gt;No, it isn't fair to make fat people pay more for a first class seat
&gt;or pay for two seats. I know thin people who've complained about how
&gt;small airplane seats are. The airline industry wants to make as much
&gt;money as they can so they make the seats incredibly tiny and don't
&gt;allow much leg room. Nobody is comfortable, but the CEO's are happy
&gt;as clams.

"/> The airline industry is not wildly profitable right now, and
hasn't been for awhile.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;As far as not wanting to sit next to a fat person...you have the right
&gt;to feel that way.
&gt;I, myself...don't like to sit next to smokers (because of the smell),
&gt;small, crying children, or people who talk too much.
&gt;But you know who I REALLY don't want to sit next to? Adulterers,
&gt;bigots, fundamentalists, or just plain mean people. But I don't have
&gt;that choice, do I?
&gt;So...life sucks. Grin and bear it.

"/> Life doesn't suck. It's great. Anybody who claims it sucks
is unappreciative of its great gift.

But I digress. The complaint about sitting next to fat
people on airplanes is that the fat person spills over into
your seat. That is not true with your adulterers or bigots,
unless they are fat adulterers or fat bigots. You're
comparing apples and oranges.

There are no studies to prove that a car with an empty gas tank will

obvious way from basic laws of physics. The same is true of weight gain
and loss, which depend on exactly the same physical principles.

has to come into your own bizarre world where you make ludicrous statements

&gt;&gt;&gt; As age and obesity overtake you, may you live to eat
&gt;&gt;&gt; those uncharitable words!

&gt;&gt; Obesity is not a consequence of age. It's a consequence of overeating.

&gt; Bullshit, it's a consequence of how your body acts internally to the food it
&gt; receives. We all know of some kids and adults that
&gt; eat nothing but junk all day and are as skinny as a rail, and some kids or
&gt; adults bloat and get fat. It's genetics, nothing more.

"/> Well, in fairness, you can probably argue that fat people eat more than
their bodies demand, but demands differ (as witness the comparatively
recent discoveries about insulin activity). One of the most sedentary
people I ever knew could eat anyone else &quot;under the table&quot;. (It was not
at all unusual for him to eat three and four full plates full of food
from the buffet at a party - notwithstanding the fact he was an
excellent cook, and ate well at home, too.) He was not very tall, but
remained thin all his life (in fact he would have liked very much to
gain a little weight). I once worked with a petite Phillipino girl who
used to joke that she ate one meal a day - it began when she woke up and
continued until she went to bed. When she was a child in Catholic
grammar school, she was excused from &quot;fasting&quot; during Lent, because if
she tried, she'd have fainting spells.

You notice that the people most insistent that &quot;it's all a matter of
calories vs exercise&quot; are those who have never had a weight problem -
neither over- nor under-. There are a great many people, even in the
U.S., who would like very much to GAIN weight. Since the anorexic look
is fashionable at the moment, they may not be as obvious, but they DO
exist.

as they want and never gain an ounce? And that these same people
don't exercise either. They are biologically meant to be thin. You

&gt; Why is it that obesity correlates so strongly with country of residence?

"/> Yes, we do have a lot of fatness in this country. There are many
reasons for this. Our diets are a big part of that. I'm not debating
that. But it's not just fat people who are eating MacDonalds food.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I don't support or condone all this fat-bashing. But I don't think you're
&gt; helping anyone by claiming that obesity is in most cases some magic curse
&gt; out of the control of its victims or their parents. The fact that Americans
&gt; (and lately they are seeing competition from Australia and a few others) are
&gt; far more likely to be obese than people of other countries with similar
&gt; plentiful availability of food makes it pretty clear that either they're a
&gt; different species, or behavior and culture figure in somehow. Take control.
&gt; Don't be a helpless victim of the condition.

"/> I don't believe that being fat is some horrible thing that makes
someone into a victim or martyr. It's just another body type. And as
I already said, yes, there are many people who are fat because of
lifestyle choices. But how are you going to distinguish them from the
other fat people who are fat for different reasons? Generalizations
suck and they aren't helpful either.

And as far as taking control...who are you to decide that someone is
out of control just because they're fat? Not everyone can or wants to
conform to the current fashion of the thin ideal.

&gt; as they want and never gain an ounce?

"/> They are burning the food up with exercise, or they are excreting it. If
they're not exercising that much, it means their bodies aren't very
efficient and they are wasting a lot of what they eat.

Food (and hence body mass) only comes in through the mouth. It leaves
through simple metabolic processes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Why is it that obesity correlates so strongly with country of residence?

&gt; Yes, we do have a lot of fatness in this country. There are many reasons
&gt; for this. Our diets are a big part of that. I'm not debating that. But
&gt; it's not just fat people who are eating MacDonalds food.

"/> Sure, but the existence of thin people who eat a lot of fatty foods is
pretty irrelevant to the existence of fat people who do.

Some people who drive cars with bad brakes don't get into accidents. That
doesn't mean that driving with bad brakes is safe. It just means that for
one or another reason they got lucky.

Likewise, some people who eat too much food don't store that much of it in
body fat. That doesn't mean that eating too much food isn't the basic cause
of excess body weight. It just means that for one or another reason they got
lucky.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I don't support or condone all this fat-bashing. But I don't think you're
&gt;&gt; helping anyone by claiming that obesity is in most cases some magic curse
&gt;&gt; out of the control of its victims or their parents. The fact that
&gt;&gt; Americans (and lately they are seeing competition from Australia and a
&gt;&gt; few others) are far more likely to be obese than people of other
&gt;&gt; countries with similar plentiful availability of food makes it pretty
&gt;&gt; clear that either they're a different species, or behavior and culture
&gt;&gt; figure in somehow. Take control. Don't be a helpless victim of the
&gt;&gt; condition.

&gt; I don't believe that being fat is some horrible thing that makes
&gt; someone into a victim or martyr. It's just another body type.

"/> There's a fairly high degree of correlation between obesity and serious
medical problems. It brings social stigma. And of course, as per the topic
of this thread, it can make it tricky to fit into tiny little airplane
seats.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And as I already said, yes, there are many people who are fat because of
&gt; lifestyle choices. But how are you going to distinguish them from the
&gt; other fat people who are fat for different reasons? Generalizations suck
&gt; and they aren't helpful either.

"/> What are those different reason? Whatever they are, they affect a small
minority of obese people; that is clear just by walking around other wealthy
countries that have far fewer of them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And as far as taking control...who are you to decide that someone is out
&gt; of control just because they're fat? Not everyone can or wants to conform
&gt; to the current fashion of the thin ideal.

"/> Fair enough. Some people, for instance, have a very difficult time getting
enough exercise due to other physical problems. I'm just talking about the
people who invent things to blame for their condition. Clearly for them it
goes beyond not wanting to conform to social pressure.

"/>  There are then at least four reasons why some people can eat the same
food and some stay thin and others gain weight. They are:

1. Sedentary people make a low-density cholesterol (fat) that the body
likes to store instead of burn.

2. People who maintain a regular exercise routine make a high-density
cholesterol (fat) that the body readily burns and easily takes out of
storage.

3. Some individuals are born with a metabolism that burns fat more
quickly that those with a average metabolism. These people naturally burn
fat faster than people with a normal metabolism. This is usually a
hereditary characteristic.

4. The more muscle a person has the more s/he is able to burn more fat.

Exercise more, develop more muscle, burn more fat. The equation persists.

Now I've seem some recent research revealing that fat people have a tendency

daily and several times.
They also exaggerate their exercise way too much. Have a look at fat people
how they have a tendency to walk slow and take every opportunity to sit
down.
As we are talking about air transport, try to see how fat people sit down in
the departure areas while slim people are walking around in the waiting time
looking in the shops or just moving around for curiosity.
A good example was a work mate, he had for many years been competing in
biking and ski running but after a bike accident he wasn't so mobile. As
he continued his usual food intake it resulted in obvious obesity, he have
now started training again and we can see the reduction in volume...

Hi, Doug -

I sincerely hope that my seatmate on our last trip from Narita will not be
yours !

Handsome, young man...but must have had a garlic sandwich prior to boarding.
It hung like a cloud over the entire section (business class) on the trip to
SF.

Not fun but at least he was sober....I've had a few that were not and that's
a big problem too....listening to someone &quot;snore it off&quot; or drool is not
especially pleasant either. There is so little space that almost anything
can become a pain in the neck. Alcohol, after shave, parfume, body odor,
etc. can do you in on those long trips.(G)

I wish you quiet, normal sized, sober and pleasant companions on your trip.

Best,
Patricia

Hi..

I remembered about &quot;body type&quot; from a high school health class and thought
that mentioning it might be helpful in remembering that we are not all
constructed the same way.

Advertising, pop culture, etc. would have us believe that being wafer thin
is the only way to be. I never bought into that but instead believe that a
&quot;personal best&quot; is the thing to work toward.

I found the following on the net and thought it might be worth reading...

I hope this may help a little in understanding the problem... but the fact
remains I still don't want to be stuck in the middle with a seat mate who
takes up 1/3 of my seat ...it's uncomfortable and unfair.

Patricia

==============================================================

Ectomorphs: For the years of the 1990's, I guess you could say if you were
an ectomorph, you were &quot;trendy.&quot; Ectomorphs are those skinny girls and guys
who appear to eat as much as they like and still stay &quot;rake thin.&quot;
Ectomorphs are those whom appear lean, long and lanky, and have a small bone
structure with narrow hips and a small waist. Their legs tend to be longer
than their bodies. These are the women you will often find strutting the
catwalk. Yes this is the model type body. A lot of you may be green with
envy at these women, however some of these women actually find it difficult
to put on weight. Therefore being an ectomorph for some can be a health
issue, as they are too skinny. And they do exist (I've actually met one!). I
must add, the true ectomorph is not suffering from anorexia nervosa.

Mesomorphs: They tend to be athletic looking with broad shoulders, narrow
waists, and broad hips. Mesomorphs appear to be more muscular and the
distribution of their weight may be more evenly presented. They sound
perfect, don't they? However, they do tend to gather weight around their
hips and thighs. Many women get upset about carrying weight on these areas,
but what they don't know is that it is much healthier to carry fat on the
hips and thighs, unlike the endomorph; who is more likely to carry fat
around their abdomen. Fat around the hips and thighs are located on the
outer layers of the body, unlike abdominal (stomach) fat; which lies much
deeper in the body's tissue.

Endomorphs: Unfortunately if you are in this category, you are going to have
a much more difficult time in maintaining a healthy weight. Endomorphs are
predisposed to gaining weight, and tend to be on the overweight side. They
are typically more heavily boned, and carry more fat than muscle. Generally
their legs are shorter than their bodies. Fat stores will accumulate around
their stomachs, and their breasts may be larger than &quot;the norm&quot;. As
mentioned before, fat around the abdomen is much deeper than fat on the hips
or thighs, this directly affects the amount of fat stored around the body's
organs such as the heart, which can increase the incidence of heart disease
and high blood pressure. That's not all, there's more bad news.
Unfortunately if you lean toward this body type, you are going to find it
harder to lose weight than the ectomorph and even the mesomorph. Being an
endomorph does not mean it's the end of the world, maintaining a healthy
weight is what you need to aim for, this helps to reduce the amount of fat
around your heart and other important organs.

So what does this all mean?

For most of us we have two body types, e.g. mesomorph and endomorph (which
is possibly the most common). But for some, their bodies are distinctly one
type, although these people are not the majority. Pure ectomorphs,
mesomorphs, and endomorphs are the minority in body types. Most people may
lean towards one of these body types but are still a mixture of two.
Identifying the kind of body type(s) you are, can help you understand why
even with diet and exercise you cannot change what you were born with - just
as you can't grow any taller once you are an adult. What the emphasis should
be place on is not what shape you are but are you physically healthy?

So how does this help with weight problems anyway?

It doesn't. But it should help you understand that weight issues are not
about the perfect body, but health and fitness. Unfortunately the 1990's set
an unhealthy standard for body types - the ectomorph. Some women who appear
to be an ectomorph have only achieved this through starvation and
over-exercise. This is not healthy!!! You must remember, only a small
percentage of the population are pure ectomorphs.

Things are changing slowly. Mesomorphs are becoming more popular, but again
pure mesomorphs are only a small percentage of the population. A positive
outcome of this new millennium is that modelling agencies are using larger
women, those leaning towards the endomorphs, promoting the larger, more
&quot;normal&quot; women (say a size 12-14). This is what the clothing industry and
the media need to focus on - what is normal and realistic.

We need to promote the fact that we are all different shapes and sizes, and
focus on &quot;healthy,&quot; not &quot;skinny&quot; (remember skinny does not mean healthy
either). You can be an endomorph and be gorgeous and healthy, and this
requires healthy eating and exercise. Basically, although we are born with a
specific body type, we must remember we are all different and beautiful,
there are no right and wrongs in body shape. The important thing is that
your body is in optimal condition, and most of the time a healthy diet,
along with regular exercise will help you get to that level.

And remember there is no such thing as the perfect figure!

&gt;Can you please explain to me why so many thin people can eat as much
&gt;as they want and never gain an ounce?

"/> I used to be like that, skinny and eating all the time, couldn't
put on an ounce. I was lucky, I had a faster metabolism than
most, you will also observe as I have, that as you get older it
slows and to stay thin you have to eat less and less.

Fat people (apart from one or two with some medical problem) eat
more than they can metabolise, its as simple as that.

*My advice*
If you start to get fat, eat less, (especially sugar and fat) and
exercise more, until you establish equilibrium.
This is the only diet advice (re obesity) most people need.

But we drink barrels of beer, stuff in fast food, eat sweets and
snack between meals, have pie for dinner and drive everywhere,
and hey presto, we're fat!

For some staying slim is easy, for some its hard, lifes like that

&gt; For once, I am in the same boat as Mxsmanic! The comparison between

"/> Then you don't know your metabolic science.

Excess insulin caused by insulin resistance is the primary cause of obesity,
adult onset diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure.
Most adult onset (Type 2) diabetics have obesity first, then, if they don't
control their sugars, the diabetes kicks in.

As far as the comparison to Type I diabetics, no one controls how much
insulin they release. Type I's put out none, Type II's put out way to much,
and then none after the pancreas fails due to so much excessive output.

It's all about the &quot;insulin&quot;. There is a very direct connection. Just

&gt; Well, in fairness, you can probably argue that fat people eat more than

their body can handle. As you mentioned the insulin connection, it's
actually the whether it's the glucogen or insulin that dominates. Whichever
dominates determines your degree of body fat.

The problem is that the traditional view is that high carb/low fat is the
way to go. That works only only for those without an insulin resistance
problem. Those that have insulin resistance must control carbs.

The word is finally getting out, and soon mainstream science will realise
this. Then, when the food manufacturers start flooding the market with low

&gt;shit&quot;. It was then that I realized that I was finally free of him. I
&gt;didn't leave him, he left me. (snip)
&gt;Monday morning when I went back online, I found out that Steve had
&gt;started spreading that I cheated on him. I tell you this. I did not
&gt;cheat on him. It was not until the 10th of March, the day AFTER Steve
&gt;left me, that I finally agreed to go out with John. AFTER he had left
&gt;me.
&gt;
&gt;Then, he swore to me that if I did not leave John then he would come
&gt;after me with a shotgun. Now that seems a little farfetched as he won't
&gt;come to New Mexico, where I have always lived and he also swore that if
&gt;I came to California, then he would have a shotgun ready for me and/or
&gt;have me arrested.
&gt;
&gt;But for what? I never once said that I would go see him, and I don't
&gt;think that he owns all of California. He has threatened to do too many
&gt;things to me, anything from Netdeath to reality death. And this hasn't
&gt;been just because I left him, but because I wasn't lett him control me
&gt;any longer.
&gt;
&gt;When he came here in January of '94, it was a happy time. Until I saw
&gt;that he lived for control. I went on IRC one night just to check my
&gt;mail and to say Hi to anyone I knew, I was kicked off by a dork who had
&gt;taken over #talk. But because I didn't go into catatonics, Steve went
&gt;crazy.
&gt;
&gt;He stomped around my room with fists clenched and there was a wild look
&gt;in his eyes. Now I'm 6' and weigh approximately 200 (give or take 5
&gt;lbs) lbs and I know how to defend myself. However, I was afraid of what
&gt;Steve was going to do as he slammed his fist against the wall (which
&gt;caused it to boom out loudly) and I knew that if he were to strike me, I
&gt;wouldn't be in a good position to do anything against him considering
&gt;he's 6'0 and weighs nearly 300lbs. Basically, I was not safe with him,
&gt;or so I felt.
&gt;
&gt;Probably by now, all of you are bored stiff. I admit that this is not
&gt;what you designed this talk-list for. But please, realize this. I did
&gt;NOT cheat on Steve. He dumped me and there was someone here who was
&gt;willing to go out with me. John is here, with me, in the same area as I
&gt;am. He's not pushing marriage on me. Steve was going to make me either
&gt;have his children or raise them, whereas I didn't want either. Also,
&gt;John shares my love for animals, whereas Steve would rather seem them as
&gt;roadkill. (snip)
&gt;I leave the judgement up to God's hands, as we humans are too flawed to
&gt;judge ourselves. Only the Purest may decide.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Obesity
&gt;Obesity, defined as excessive body fat relative to lean body
&gt;mass, is a prevalent complex health problem in Canada.
&gt;Treatment based approaches have been largely unsuccessful.
&gt;Obesity affects between 26 and 39% of adults over the age of
&gt;20 years, and 5 to 25% of children (Canadian Dietetic
&gt;Association, 1988).
&gt;Obesity and Overeating
&gt;A common misconception is that obese individuals overeat or
&gt;have the eating disorder called binge eating disorder.
&gt;According to Reed &amp; Price (1998), dieting, exercise or
&gt;disordered eating does not account for extremes of body
&gt;weight. On the contrary, research has demonstrated that
&gt;obese individuals may even consume less than their thinner
&gt;counterparts.

"/> Reed and Price don't say anything that supports the
assertion of the &quot;common misconception&quot; of the topic
sentence of this paragraph. Rather, the abstract of that
research states:

_________________________________________

Dieting, exercise, or disordered eating does not account for
extremes of body weight within families.

Reed DR, Price RA.

Center for Neurobiology and Behavior, Department of
Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104,
USA.

OBJECTIVE: Families having both members with obesity and
thin members should contain substantial information for
genetics studies, provided measured phenotype is an accurate
indicator of genetic predisposition. We assessed the impact
of potentially complicating behavioral factors on obesity
phenotypes of family members selected for a long-term
project to identify genes for human obesity. RESEARCH
METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Ninety-nine Caucasian families were
selected for study because they contained both extremely
obese and average-weight family members. Family members
(n=492) were queried about their diet and exercise habits,
their psychiatric histories as they pertained to eating
disorders, and for a subset of subjects (n=329), a lifetime
dieting history and a lifetime maximum weight were recorded.
RESULTS: Subjects with average body weights in these
families did not appear to be maintaining their weight by
dieting and &lt;4% of the average-weight subjects had ever been
obese in the past. DISCUSSION: Although dieting and other
weight loss practices potentially could either mask or
complicate the genotype-phenotype relationship, we found
little evidence for this possibility in the families
studied.

__________________________________

I haven't been able to find the entire article online. But
from the abstract the most that can be said is that if some
family members are genetically predisposed to obesity, it
does not mean that all members of the same family will be
genetically predisposed to obesity.

It certainly does not refute the assertion that obese
individuals overeat or have an eating disorder called binge
eating disorder.

And the claim that this is a &quot;common misconception&quot; is
almost ridiculous beyond belief, and almost every single
person reading this knows that if he or she sits down and
consumes 10,000 calories in a meal, he or she is going to
gain weight. There may be a few outliers who have bizarre
metabolic or digestive circumstances who won't gain weight.
But that's it. &quot;Common misconception&quot;? Bullshit.

Let me tell you what I think the real unarticulated premise
and flaw is in this article, and in the belief systems of
those who wish for it to be true.

Obese individuals who continue to cling to this bad science
and bad logic are really obscuring their belief that because
some thin persons are able to engage in sloth and gluttony
without gaining weight, and fill their stomachs to the point
of torpor, then the obese person should be able to as well.

That's like saying that because some people have 20-20
vision, nobody should have to wear glasses.

Our bodies are all different, and we need to take account of
our own idiosyncrasies and needs. If you put on weight
easily, then you need to increase your level of activity and
reduce your caloric consumption. If you are insulin
resistant, then you need to reduce your carbohydrate
consumption. But you don't have some natural right to
consume as much as the most metabolically gifted thin person
in the world can, just like you don't have a natural right
to drive a car without glasses just because I can.

If you choose not to do any of these things to control your
weight, fine, live your life the way you wish. But don't
deceive yourself, or try to deceive anybody else, from the
plain and simple fact that this is your choice, and you are
not a victim of biology simply because your body won't
tolerate your overeating without putting on excess weight.

None of this is meant to deny that there are some biological
conditions -- such as ovarian cysts -- that make it
difficult for some women to lose weight and easy to gain
weight. But instead of assuming you are victim to one of
these exotic conditions and throwing your hands up in the
air, find out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Experiment after experiment has shown that overeating does
&gt;not always result in overweight; nor is overweight always
&gt;the result of overeating ... the fact is that time and again
&gt;the tests lead to the same surprising conclusion: Many
&gt;people who overeat do not get fat and many people who are
&gt;overweight do not overeat. (1991, p.18)

phrases like &quot;not always&quot; and terms like &quot;many.&quot; Let's see

more than a calorie burning mechanism. For example, I have a colleague
who went down from 125lbs to just under 90lbs while eating more calories
per day than I do, or ever have. This is possible because she has a
condition which hinders the absorption of food from her intestine - the
outcome of her illness is somewhat akin to the results of a gastric

&gt;&gt; Well, in fairness, you can probably argue that fat people eat more than
&gt;&gt; their bodies demand, but demands differ (as witness the comparatively
&gt;&gt; recent discoveries about insulin activity).

&gt; I think it would be fair to say &quot;fat people eat more 'carbohydrates' than
&gt; their body can handle. As you mentioned the insulin connection, it's
&gt; actually the whether it's the glucogen or insulin that dominates. Whichever
&gt; dominates determines your degree of body fat.

&gt; The problem is that the traditional view is that high carb/low fat is the
&gt; way to go. That works only only for those without an insulin resistance
&gt; problem. Those that have insulin resistance must control carbs.

&gt; The word is finally getting out, and soon mainstream science will realise
&gt; this. Then, when the food manufacturers start flooding the market with low
&gt; carb products, the tide will change!

"/> Well, they've already gotten as far as low-carb candy bars, low-carb ice
cream, low-carb bread and low-carb pasta! (The candy bars and ice-cream
are at least three times as expensive as their traditional counterparts,
and one must read labels - &quot;sugar-free&quot; is NOT the same as &quot;low-carb&quot; -
but that day is coming.)

"/> The answer to your question is that your conclusion is based on a false

A good debator would not blindly ignore the two premises that you made.

It appears that your contention is that &quot; Americans must have a common [fat]
gene of some kind&quot; and you offer as evidence:

&quot;because they are all fat, and most of the rest of the world is thin&quot;

and

&quot;Given the genetic variety of Americans in other respects&quot;

Your assertions that all Americans are fat, and that &quot;most of the rest of

making the contention/arguement, Until you provide some evidence that your
premises are true, you can expect no explaination as to the cause of your
conclusion.

&gt; Yes, then we can seat people who are either Spanish or have Spanish

"/> I'm new to this thread, and have no problem sitting next to someone who is
overweight or broad-shouldered. I would object to someone who smelled
badly, regardless of nationality. I would also have a problem with someone
else occupying my seat (or a significant portion of it). In each case, I'd
address my objection to the FA, and expect the airline to resolve it.

&gt; As to first class and business class, I consider them &quot;sucker seats.&quot; They
&gt; pay, in some cases, over 10 times what I pay for my poor economy class
seat
&gt; and guess what? I get there the same time as they do!

"/> Quite so. And in considerably more comfort. For those with the
discretionary money to do so, B and F make flying, which the airlines have
made an increasingly uncomfortable and unpleasant experience considerably
more bearable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; When I go overseas, I
&gt; just take what I can put into my carry on so often, I pass these people by
&gt; on my way out while they wait for their baggage.

"/> Not everyone goes overseas for so short a time as to be able to live out of
their carryon. When I fly domestically in the US, I also avoid checking
bags like plague. Since I almost always fly in F (by virtue of using an
airline which does an automatic upgrade to F when purchasing a full-fare
coach ticket, or by virtue of an elite-status upgrade), I guess I do get
there before you, though that certainly isn't the motivation for preferring
F to coach.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now, who really gets there
&gt; first? Airlines sell these seats on the basis of snob appeal first, then
&gt; comfort.

"/>&quot;Snob appeal&quot;? I don't know anyone who flies in F because it appeals to
their ego. What F does provide is this:

1. A wider seat. This, alone, makes it attractive. I'm not overweight
(well, not anymore), but even now I find coach seats to narrow and
restrictive, and I don't like having to share an arm rest.

2. Better seat pitch. This is another major comfort factor. I can stretch
my legs (a bit), and not get overly intimate with my seat mate if I need to
get up to use the lav (particularly true on international flights). I'm not
particularly tall; I would think that, for someone over 6 feet, the extra
seat pitch would, alone, be a magnet.

3. Priority boarding. Boarding early is, of course, less stressful, as you
don't have to wait in a long, backed up queue as the people ahead try to
find their seats and stow their bags. However, it is of considerable
importance for those of us, like you, who depend on carry-ons and don't
check bags, as it ensures that there will be bin space available for
stowage.

4. Priority screening. Most airports have a special line for frequent
flyers and F-ticketed passengers. Shorter wait times means it is less
likely you'll miss your flight if a meeting runs late.

5. Free drinks. Not very important in the grand scheme of things.
However, yesterday I was able to buy an upgrade to F for $50. Since I might
have as many as 2 or 3 glasses of wine during the flight (depending on
flight length and, mostly, weather conditions), the effective cost of the
upgrade was $38, quite a bargain considering points 1 through 3, above.

6. Meal service. Yes, airline food is dismal, including in F. However,
considering that there are many days when I leave my house at the crack of
dawn, travel all day, and don't arrive at my destination until well into
evening, it's nice to have something more than a bag of nuts to sustain me.
Airport fast food is unpalatable, and requires more time to comfortably
order and consume than most of my connections allow.

7. Club room access. Some airlines, e.g. AmericaWest, will grant club room
access to F passengers. This, to me, is an enormous benefit -- a
comfortable lounge, work-station access, snacks, free drinks. These make a
huge difference when, for example, my business ends early and I have to wait
around 2 or 3 hours for a flight.

8. Society. Though F isn't immune, it is far less likely to find screaming
babies, rampaging toddlers, overly boisterous teens, novice flyers who try
to stow 38 shopping bags and a giant stuffed panda, etc.

[...]
&gt; So how does this help with weight problems anyway?

&gt; It doesn't. But it should help you understand that weight issues are not
&gt; about the perfect body, but health and fitness. Unfortunately the 1990's set
&gt; an unhealthy standard for body types - the ectomorph. Some women who appear
&gt; to be an ectomorph have only achieved this through starvation and
&gt; over-exercise.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Things are changing slowly. Mesomorphs are becoming more popular, but again
&gt; pure mesomorphs are only a small percentage of the population. A positive
&gt; outcome of this new millennium is that modelling agencies are using larger
&gt; women, those leaning towards the endomorphs, promoting the larger, more
&gt;&quot;normal&quot; women (say a size 12-14).

"/> What is &quot;positive&quot; about this?

Industries can &quot;promote&quot; whatever they want, but my concept of
what is attractive will remain the same.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This is what the clothing industry and the media need to
&gt; focus on - what is normal and realistic.

"/> What sort of men do women's romance novels focus on?

When a male actor earns a starring role in a romantic comedy
geared toward women, is he anything like normal and realistic?

The media absolutely needs to focus on people who are far more
interesting than the average person. Otherwise who would watch
the media? We already have the average person running around
for us to watch for free. Media do not &quot;need&quot; to promote mediocrity.
They need to promote something worth watching. Or else they will
go broke.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and focus on &quot;healthy,&quot; not &quot;skinny&quot; (remember skinny does not mean healthy
&gt; either).

"/> Actually research has found chronic underfeeding (provided no
nutrient deficiencies result) to significantly extend the lifespan
of every animal species scientists have tested, from invertebrates
up to monkeys.

Because humans are very long-lived it will take a while to test
whether chronic underfeeding can extend the human lifespan, but
a few people are trying. According to an article in
Scientific American, less than 1 in 1000 people have the
self-discipline necessary to remain voluntarily on the low-calorie
diet in these tests.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Exercise becomes more important for delaying the deterioration

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> Nonsense. Only a tiny percentage of people are beautiful.

&gt; It is suggested that one contributing factor is that nearly three

&gt; eat more Hershey bars? Then take more exercise&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; For all of us, the body is in a continual state of hunger ...

&gt;&gt;Speak for yourself. I can remember at least one occasion when I
&gt;&gt;_forgot_ to eat for two days.

&gt; The body is continually consuming fuel . It will satisfy its demands
&gt; from our fat store and muscles even when we don't eat. This is
&gt; what is meant by the body is in a continual state of hunger.

&gt; The state of hunger is not the same as feeling hungry.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is entirely possible that the perpetually dieting
&gt;&gt;&gt; fat person may still be still putting on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; weight whilst eating comparatively little.

&gt;&gt;No, that is not possible. They put on weight because they continue to
&gt;&gt;eat too much.

&gt; I'm sorry but you are wrong. It is possible and you give the reason
&gt; yourself. &quot;Comparatively little&quot; may still be more than they
&gt; require. This is one of the dilemmas for fat people. They think they
&gt; are controlling weight by reducing their food intake and get
&gt; discouraged when it doesn't happen. What they need to do is
&gt; increase the intake and take more exercise to raise their metabolism
&gt; so that they expend more.

&gt;&gt; I found the following on the net and thought it might be worth reading...
&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt; So how does this help with weight problems anyway?

&gt;&gt; It doesn't. But it should help you understand that weight issues are not
&gt;&gt; about the perfect body, but health and fitness. Unfortunately the 1990's set
&gt;&gt; an unhealthy standard for body types - the ectomorph. Some women who appear
&gt;&gt; to be an ectomorph have only achieved this through starvation and
&gt;&gt; over-exercise.

&gt; I don't think many of those women, wherever they may be, are
&gt; currently posting to soc.singles.

"/> THAT'S why this thread goes on and on - we're all ignoring the
innumerable cross-posts. (Although I fail to see the relevance of your

do you?)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; This is not healthy!!!

&gt; What's the life expectancy for fashion models? Few of them are
&gt; going to work as fashion models for very long. They'll have plenty
&gt; of years of retirement to get fat.

&gt;&gt; Things are changing slowly. Mesomorphs are becoming more popular, but again
&gt;&gt; pure mesomorphs are only a small percentage of the population. A positive
&gt;&gt; outcome of this new millennium is that modelling agencies are using larger
&gt;&gt; women, those leaning towards the endomorphs, promoting the larger, more
&gt;&gt;&quot;normal&quot; women (say a size 12-14).

&gt; What is &quot;positive&quot; about this?

&gt; Industries can &quot;promote&quot; whatever they want, but my concept of
&gt; what is attractive will remain the same.

&gt;&gt; This is what the clothing industry and the media need to
&gt;&gt; focus on - what is normal and realistic.

&gt; What sort of men do women's romance novels focus on?

&gt; When a male actor earns a starring role in a romantic comedy
&gt; geared toward women, is he anything like normal and realistic?

&gt; The media absolutely needs to focus on people who are far more
&gt; interesting than the average person. Otherwise who would watch
&gt; the media? We already have the average person running around
&gt; for us to watch for free. Media do not &quot;need&quot; to promote mediocrity.
&gt; They need to promote something worth watching. Or else they will
&gt; go broke.

&gt;&gt; We need to promote the fact that we are all different shapes and sizes,

&gt; Why do we &quot;need&quot; to promote a fact which is not only undeniable,
&gt; but impossible to ignore whenever people gather? Would it ever
&gt; be possible to forget, for one second, that people are physically
&gt; diverse?

&gt;&gt; and focus on &quot;healthy,&quot; not &quot;skinny&quot; (remember skinny does not mean healthy
&gt;&gt; either).

&gt; Actually research has found chronic underfeeding (provided no
&gt; nutrient deficiencies result) to significantly extend the lifespan
&gt; of every animal species scientists have tested, from invertebrates
&gt; up to monkeys.

&gt; Because humans are very long-lived it will take a while to test
&gt; whether chronic underfeeding can extend the human lifespan, but
&gt; a few people are trying. According to an article in
&gt; Scientific American, less than 1 in 1000 people have the
&gt; self-discipline necessary to remain voluntarily on the low-calorie
&gt; diet in these tests.

&gt;&gt; You can be an endomorph and be gorgeous and healthy, and this
&gt;&gt; requires healthy eating and exercise.

&gt; To be &quot;gorgeous&quot; means impressing the relevant audience
&gt; with one's physical appearance.

&gt; Being gorgeous requires good genetics, youth, and
&gt; good luck at avoiding disfiguring accidents and diseases.

&gt; Exercise becomes more important for delaying the deterioration
&gt; in one's physical appearance that is normal during aging.

&gt;&gt; Basically, although we are born with a
&gt;&gt; specific body type, we must remember we are all different and beautiful,

&gt; Nonsense. Only a tiny percentage of people are beautiful.
&gt; People are all different but most are just nondescript.
&gt; Nobody gets too excited about how the average person looks.
&gt; The average person's face does not sell many magazines or
&gt; movie tickets.

&gt;&gt; there are no right and wrongs in body shape.

&gt; That depends on what sorts of emotional reactions you want to
&gt; trigger in what sorts of people.

&gt;&gt; The important thing is that
&gt;&gt; your body is in optimal condition,

&gt; It's important to understand &quot;optimal&quot; does not necessarily
&gt; mean &quot;good.&quot;

&gt;&gt; and most of the time a healthy diet,
&gt;&gt; along with regular exercise will help you get to that level.

&gt; Maybe reading enough fluff articles will help average
&gt; people think they are better than average.

&gt;&gt; And remember there is no such thing as the perfect figure!

&gt; Perhaps, but if I had the job of figuring out how to improve
&gt; (Playboy model) Shannon Stewart's figure, I'd have to think
&gt; about that for a while. From what I've seen, she looks to have
&gt; just about all her molecules arranged perfectly.

&gt; So what about the earlier claim that everyone is &quot;beautiful&quot;?
&gt; Does the author now want us to believe everybody is beautiful
&gt; with an imperfect figure?

Personally, I think the real problem is garlic eaters. They should
install garlic odor detectors at the checkin desk. If you exude garlic
fumes, you don't get on the plane, period. I can't breath near a garlic
eater. The flights from Europe to Australia that stop in Bnkok and
Singapore are the worst. I guess Souteast Asians eat a lot of garlic.

"/> A quick skate through the low carb research lowcarblosers.com shows
this:
Fifty-three healthy, obese female volunteers (mean body mass index,
33.6 ± 0.3 kg/m2) were randomized; 42 (79%) completed the trial. Women
on both diets reduced calorie consumption by comparable amounts at 3
and 6 months. The very low carbohydrate diet group lost more weight
(8.5 ± 1.0 vs. 3.9 ± 1.0 kg; P &lt; 0.001) and more body fat (4.8 ± 0.67
vs. 2.0 ± 0.75 kg; P &lt; 0.01) than the low fat diet group.

This comes from here:
http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/88/4/1617

Just from that tiny sample, something has to be going on there which
is nothing to do with calories, because &quot;Women on both diets reduced
calorie consumption by comparable amounts&quot;. I believe one of the
Dougs who post to alt.diet.support.low-carb posted a similar piece of
research which showed that on a 1500 calorie a day diet, the low carb
group lost more weight (and retained more muscle) than the low calorie
or the low fat groups *on the same calorie intake*. Again, something
has to be going on which has nothing to do with calories in vs.
calories used.

&gt; And there is no
&gt; equivalent disorder that can cause people to gain weight even when they
&gt; are consuming fewer calories than they burn.

"/> Except that some people - a very, very few - do gain weight on what
appear to be ridiculously low calorie diets - 800 calories a day has
been mentioned. The principle of metabolic reistance seems to be
pretty much accepted among obesity researchers, and it seems to get
worse with the number of diets people go on.

Don't get me wrong, I don't argue with the concept that most obesity
stems from people eating too much. I think a lot of obesity in the
States, the UK and probably Australia stems from the massive and
growing portions people seem to consume - I was shocked at this when I
visited the States. Much of it could be helped, cured or at least cut
back if the public in all those countries could be persuaded to accept
smaller portions on their plates when they go to a restaurant or when
doing dinner at home. A lot of people in most countries don't know
what a 'portion' of anything is, and if you told them that a 'portion'
of fruit is half an apple, and a portion of cola about a third of the
can, they wouldn't believe you. Really, is that kind of acceptance
going to happen any time soon?

While I don't believe that the obese individual can avoid taking
responsibility for their physical condition, I also believe that big
business - and the food industry is a very big business - has to take
at least part of the blame for the rise and rise of obesity. And some
of the solution lies with them. Though, with growing obesity and no
corresponding fall in the average age at death, whether obesity is
quite the danger to health it's made out to be is another question
entirely and nothing to do with the original topic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; It appears that your contention is that &quot; Americans must have a common

&gt; No, my contention is just the opposite: The fact that Americans are fat

&quot;Then Americans must have a common gene of some kind, because they are
all fat, and most of the rest of the world is thin. Given the genetic
variety of Americans in other respects, how do you explain this?&quot;

Make up your mind. Either your contention is that Americans have common
gene of some kind which makes them fat, or obesity is not a genetically
determined problem, in which case American could not have a common fat gene.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Your assertions that all Americans are fat, and that &quot;most of the rest

most Americans are fat, and now you're making the presumption that when you

based purely on anecdotal evidence, and since you haven't established
yourself as an authority on judging obesity nor being able to determine
nationality based upon appearance, your evidence carries no weight.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Until you provide some evidence that your premises are

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; BTW, your &quot;Perhaps so&quot; fragment damages your claim that you are a good

&gt; Why?

"/> Because you're admitting that even when you attempt to make a proof by
assertion, that you can't or won't support your assertion.

So basically, you've flip-flopped on your original contention, are
supporting your contention with weak evidence, and are admitting that even
your proof by assertion won't stand up to cross-examination.

If I were judging this debate I'd say you've lost.

New Hampshire.

The book is an anthology of short stories. He has a few about the

few blocks if they can use the car..

"/> Some of them will go down that black hole called the toilet. As Martin
has already pointed out, fibre is one carbohydrate which the body cannot
burn or store and must excrete - another possible contender for this
would be the way that some people's metabolism reacts to polyols, also
known as sugar alcohols. Don't believe me? Just try eating a whole bar
of diabetic chocolate, but make sure you've plenty of reading matter in
your lavatory, because you'll be spending quite a while in there. And
as I've pointed out, I do have a colleague whose metabolism is so out of
whack she can't store most of what she eats. Yes, that is a very, very
rare condition, but the fact that it does happen at all undermines
Mxmanic's argument.

By the way, it's written now. Some of the metro stations (Union Station and

It doesn;t help.

My real pet peeve on the metro is when it is really full and people who want
to stand in the door insist on doing so when people are leaving and getting on.
Therefore only one line of people can get out, and sometimes, the door chimes
will go off before everyone is OFF, never mind getting ON. Sometimes the
crowds at the door will crowd the door so close as to let only one group of
folks off, too.

you're skirting round without answering is *why* many fat people eat too
much - could it be because they are hungry? And they are hungry because
the modern diet is full of sugar, refined flour, potatoes and the like,
and these things are making them hungry? Hunger like that is not
imaginary, I can assure you of that.

My experience is that as someone who is trying to lose weight - well,
size, actually - I am eating less calories than previously but the
calories I now eat comprise 70% fat, 25% protein and about 5%
carbohydrate, rather than the other way around. On the other hand, for
the first time in my life, I'm not constantly hungry. Having said that,
dieting is not always easy, and it's a decision people have to make for
themselves and for their own reasons. One cannot 'moral' people into
losing weight, because despite the loaded language people use, it is not
a moral issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt; will be stored. Are you now backing away from that clear position?

&gt; Some of them will go down that black hole called the toilet. As Martin
&gt; has already pointed out, fibre is one carbohydrate which the body cannot
&gt; burn or store and must excrete - another possible contender for this
&gt; would be the way that some people's metabolism reacts to polyols, also
&gt; known as sugar alcohols. Don't believe me? Just try eating a whole bar
&gt; of diabetic chocolate, but make sure you've plenty of reading matter in
&gt; your lavatory, because you'll be spending quite a while in there. And
&gt; as I've pointed out, I do have a colleague whose metabolism is so out of
&gt; whack she can't store most of what she eats. Yes, that is a very, very
&gt; rare condition, but the fact that it does happen at all undermines
&gt; Mxmanic's argument.

"/> I don't think very rare conditions are really relevant to the discussion at
all. Of course there are going to be a few people who present any number of
strange exceptions to general rules. However, what we have in the US,
anyway, is huge numbers of people claiming to be victim to mysterious
&quot;glandular&quot; afflictions that affect minute numbers of people elsewhere.

Mixed quantum mechanical states are as bizzare as linear versus

Furthermore, the notion of whether a state is &quot;mixed&quot; or not
depends on what physical variables you happent to be interested
in measuring; you may be in a state which is diagonal (pure) in one
basis but not in another.

Nevertheless there is one actual state.

Thus orthodox quantum mechanics very much has a specific
notion of 'reality'.

The concept of &quot;physical state&quot; defining the present reality of the

&gt; I don't presume that obese tourists are American, I just consider it
&gt; highly probable. Usually they are. Sometimes British and German
&gt; tourists get pretty fat, but most of the real fatties are American.

&gt;&gt; In other words, your evidence is based purely on anecdotal
&gt;&gt; evidence ...

&gt; I see thousands of tourists. While they all have a few things in common
&gt; (the means to come here, and the will), they are in many respects a
&gt; random cross section of the nationalities they represent. Unless one of
&gt; their common traits is correlated with obesity (I am willing to consider
&gt; evidence along these lines), their obesity or lack thereof is
&gt; representative of the general trend in the populations from which they
&gt; are drawn.

"/> where do you live?

By the way, the fatness of Americans is very striking. Note also that
it is significantly correlated with wealth---the more educated and
richer (and more likely to be international tourists) are less fat
than the average.

I find it is very easy to pick out even tourists from other U.S. states
when they come to California. (pale, poorly dressed and fat).

Another observation. At my university, there is a summer program to
teach English language to foreign students. They eat in one cafeteria
that I happen to use sometimes too. This year, most of the students
are Japanese and Italian. While I was eating lunch I would probably
see 150-200 come through. Of those, maybe no more than 2 or 3 even
had the slightest hint of a &quot;weight problem&quot;---actual obesity was nil,
of course.

The immense difference between this and the regular school year is
obvious---not to mention 10 milliseconds at the mall.

By the way, Italian coeds are hot.

Obese individuals underestimate their food intake--which food groups are
under-reported?

Heitmann BL, Lissner L

Center for Epidemiologisk Grundforskning ved Institut for
Sygdomsforebyggelse, Amtssygehuset i Glostrup.

The purpose of the study was to examine the distribution of macronutrient
density patterns in relation to obesity. This was done in a sample of 323
Danish men and women aged 35-65 years, selected randomly from a larger
population sample of adult Danes. Dietary reporting bias of energy and
protein intake, in relation to body fat percentage, was assessed by
comparing intake data from a diet history interview with data estimated
from PABA-validated 24-hour nitrogen excretion and estimated 24-hour energy
expenditure. The results of the study showed that degree of obesity was
positively associated with protein underreporting of total energy and
protein, whereas compared with total energy reported, protein was
overreported by the obese subjects. These associations were evident despite
control for gender, age and smoking (p = 0.0003). In conclusion, errors in
dietary reporting of protein seem to occur disproportionately with respect
to total energy, suggesting a differential reporting pattern of different
foodstuffs. Although, on average, all subjects over-reported energy percent
from protein, over-reporting was most common in obese. It may therefore be
speculated that snack type foods are preferentially forgotten when dietary
omission occurs in obese individuals. The results of the present study seem
in agreement with the general assumption that obese subjects tend to
specifically under-report fat and sugar-rich foods, rather than generally
under-report their total intake. These results may have wide implications
for the interpretation of studies of diet and comorbidities to obesity.

&gt; 4. Many people do light exercise in gyms for rehabilitation after

where I live - a mid-sized city with thorough public transit and gyms
seemingly on every street corner, within easy walking distance of most of
the gym-using population.

"/> Appetite 1992 Dec;19(3):273-83

Underreporting of food intake in obese &quot;small eaters&quot;.

Fricker J, Baelde D, Igoin-Apfelbaum L, Huet JM, Apfelbaum M
Inserm U 286-Human Nutrition, Medical School Xavier Bichat, Paris, France.

Thirty sedentary and stable weight obese women were classified as small,
normal or large eaters depending on their report of 24 h energy intake (EI)
through a dietary history questionnaire. For each subject, resting
metabolic rate (RMR) was assessed through indirect calorimetry, physical
activity through a self-administered questionnaire and psychological
evaluation through psychometric tests. Neither RMR nor indices of physical
activity were different between the three groups; however for small eaters,
RMR was higher than reported EI (p &lt; 0.001). Thus, the low EI reported by
obese small eaters reflected an underreporting of food intake. Psychometric
evaluation was not different between normal and large eaters. Small eaters
exhibited a better perception of food size than normal or large eaters, and
no difference in tests assessing memory or attention; their score (2.8 +/-
1.3) in a nutritional dissimulation test was higher (p = 0.015) than that
of normal (1.0 +/- 0.7) or large eaters (1.5 +/- 0.09). This suggests that
underreporting in obese small eaters might be due to specific nutritional
concealment; because small eaters reported a low intake particularly in
foods which are often perceived as unhealthy (fats, sugars, extra-prandial
consumption), they probably reported what, in their opinion, they should
have eaten, instead of what they did eat.

Discrepancy between self-reported and actual caloric intake and exercise in
obese subjects.

Lichtman SW, Pisarska K, Berman ER, Pestone M, Dowling H, Offenbacher E,
Weisel H, Heshka S, Matthews DE, Heymsfield SB.

Department of Medicine, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, Columbia
University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Some obese subjects repeatedly fail to lose weight
even though they report restricting their caloric intake to less than 1200
kcal per day. We studied two explanations for this apparent resistance to
diet--low total energy expenditure and underreporting of caloric intake--in
224 consecutive obese subjects presenting for treatment. Group 1 consisted
of nine women and one man with a history of diet resistance in whom we
evaluated total energy expenditure and its main thermogenic components and
actual energy intake for 14 days by indirect calorimetry and analysis of
body composition. Group 2, subgroups of which served as controls in the
various evaluations, consisted of 67 women and 13 men with no history of
diet resistance. RESULTS. Total energy expenditure and resting metabolic
rate in the subjects with diet resistance (group 1) were within 5 percent
of the predicted values for body composition, and there was no significant
difference between groups 1 and 2 in the thermic effects of food and
exercise. Low energy expenditure was thus excluded as a mechanism of
self-reported diet resistance. In contrast, the subjects in group
1underreported their actual food intake by an average (+/- SD) of 47 +/- 16
percent and overreported their physical activity by 51 +/- 75 percent.
Although the subjects in group 1 had no distinct psychopathologic
characteristics, they perceived a genetic cause for their obesity, used
thyroid medication at a high frequency, and described their eating behavior
as relatively normal (all P &lt; 0.05 as compared with group 2). CONCLUSIONS.
The failure of some obese subjects to lose weight while eating a diet they
report as low in calories is due to an energy intake substantially higher
than reported and an overestimation of physical activity, not to an
abnormality in thermogenesis.

Obesity as a major determinant of underreporting in a self-administered
food frequency questionnaire: results from the EPIC-Potsdam Study.

Voss S, Kroke A, Klipstein-Grobusch K, Boeing H
German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbrucke, Unit of Medical
Epidemiology, Bergholz-Rehbrucke.

The phenomenon of underreporting of dietary intake has been observed
previously in many epidemiologic studies. In this study it was investigated
whether dependencies exist between energy intake obtained by a
semi-quantitative, self-administered food frequency questionnaire and
lifestyle or anthropometric factors, particularly obesity. The study
population consisted of 2,531 subjects, men aged 40 to 64 years and women
aged 35 to 64 years from the general population of Potsdam and the
surrounding areas. First, subjects were allocated into quintiles of the
ratio 'reported energy intake (EI)' to 'calculated basal metabolic rate
(BMR)' as a measure of age and weight adjusted energy intake. No apparent
dependencies between socio-economic variables and the ratio EI/BMR were
observed. Among anthropometric variables, BMI and related measures of
obesity were inversely related to the ratio EI/BMR in men and women. While
dietary intake was directly related to the ratio EI/BMR in absolute
quantities, energy adjusted intake of fat, protein, carbohydrate, and
alcohol was found to be independent of this ratio. Energy adjusted food
group consumption was also found to be independent of the ratio EI/BMR,
showing only slightly increasing trends across quintiles of EI/BMR for
cereals and fats, and a slightly decreasing trend for sweet foods in women.
When subjects were classified into three categories of BMI, reported energy
intake decreased across categories. Estimated energy expenditure based on
BMR was increasing with BMI categories. A close direct relationship was
observed between BMI categories and the difference between reported energy
intake and estimated energy expenditure. It is concluded that obesity is a
major determinant of under-reporting. Energy adjusted dietary variables
were found to be largely independent of such methodological influences.

I know lots of fat people like this. They need &quot;a bite to eat&quot; at noon

turns out to be a huge meal.

I ate meals with clients of mine for two weeks this past month. I don't
normally eat two full meals a day. And they walked less than I do;
instead of walking 10-15 km a day, I was walking 2-5 km per day. I had
a surplus of around 1500 kcal a day because of this, and I gained at
least two kilograms in two weeks (yes, really!). All because of a
change in eating and exercise habits.

And yes, some of them were a bit plump, albeit not obese (two of them
were normal weight, though).

Since it goes against the grain of your logic you assume the people must be
lying? Bull. Sorry but I can't accept that, especially as I know it's not
true of myself. I struggled to lose on the low fat 1500 calorie a day diet
that my doctor put me on. And I MEASURED all my portions and entered them
into a computer data base to keep track of my calories. I didn't hit 1500 on
the nose every day, but I had days as low as 1100 and days as high as 1800.
I did lose, but it was a miserable struggle, I was weak and nauseous and
sick all the time, and it took forever. Plus I was constantly starving all
the time. I stood if for nine months, but after nine months of being
starving every day I finally went off the diet.

I also lost weight on low carb, I lost at about the same rate as when I was
on low fat , and again I measured all portion and keyed them into a computer
database. I averaged about 2500 calories daily, with days as low as 1600 and
as high as 3200. But I lost weight easily, and I was NEVER hungry, and I
felt healthy and good all the time. I was not confined in a hospital since I
have to work for a living and have a family to support, but I certainly know
that I'm NOT lying about my experience.

I have 2 dogs who both have about the same skeletal size. One dog weighs 22
lbs and is skinny as a rail. The other is 49 lbs and round as a watermelon.
I feed them both the same amount of food. It is the amount recommended by
the vet for a dog of about 25 lbs. The vet wants the little dog to gain a
few lbs as he is a bit on the skinny side. 25 lbs would be nice for him, but
this amount of food is the most he will eat, and he just maintains at 22 lbs
or so, sometimes he bounces up to 24/25 but then comes back down again.

The other dog should weight 30 lbs max probably, but she keeps gaining and
gaining and gaining. Eating the same amount of food as the 22-lb dog she
went from 35 lbs to 46 lbs. At that point my vet had we switch her to a
&quot;lite&quot; dog food, again feeding her the portion for a 25 lbs dog. On the Lite
food she went from 46 lbs to 50 lbs. I finally put her back on the regular
food, and she has dropped to 49, but seem stable there, and the next step
would be cutting her to the portion size for a chihuahua or soemthing like
that! Is my dog lying??? It ain't just people.

posterior cruciate ligament on one, have torn cartiledge in the other. I'm
happy to walk on level ground, but walking up a flight of stairs kills me -

&gt;&gt;&gt; Please prove this.

&gt;&gt; Human bodies, like everything in the universe, must respect the physical
&gt;&gt; principle of conservation of energy. Getting fat without overeating
&gt;&gt; would violate this principle, therefore it is a physical impossibility.
&gt;&gt; All evidence and research to date supports this, without exception.

&gt; Wow....without exception. I guess all of the research I've done the
&gt; last 12 years means nothing to your one declaration.

&gt; You believe that all fat people overeat. You're wrong. But, sadly,
&gt; you somehow need to believe that, so I say, go on with your bad self.

"/> If your 12 years of research have convinced you that eating has
nothing to do with weight gain, here's an article from the Mayo
Clinic that you must have overlooked. The Mayo Clinic doesn't say
that *all* fat people overeat, but it does seem to say that more than
98% of them do.

http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/library/DS/00314.html

Here's some quotes:
&quot;Weight is largely determined by how you balance your intake of calories
from food with the energy you use in everyday activities. If you consume
more calories than you use, you gain weight. Your body stores calories
that you don't need for energy as fat.&quot;

&quot;A low metabolic rate is rarely a cause of obesity. &quot;
&quot;One way to lose weight is to consume fewer calories.&quot;
&quot;Another way to lose weight is to increase physical activity.&quot;
&quot;To lose weight and keep it off, you must make changes in your lifestyle.&quot;

&quot;Less than 2 percent of all cases of obesity can be traced to a medical
cause, such as low thyroid function, excess production of hormones by
the adrenal glands (Cushing's syndrome) or other hormonal imbalances.&quot;

Here's another (not from Mayo) study to consider:
http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/diet.fitness/08/29/unhealthy.sprawl.ap... .
html

&quot;People who live in sprawled-out suburbs where they must drive to
school, work or the store are likely to weigh 6 more pounds than their
counterparts in old-fashioned, walkable cities.&quot;

&quot;All other factors being equal, each extra degree of sprawl meant extra
weight, less walking and a little more high blood pressure, he concluded.
Someone living in the most sprawling county -- Geauga County outside
Cleveland -- would weigh 6.3 pounds more than if that same person
lived in the most compact area, Manhattan. &quot;

oz. can of tuna added (and just as much salad dressing as before), and
sometimes a slice of low-carb bread, as well. I almost never ate
between meals, now I have a mid-morning snack of cheese or a hard-boiled
egg, and a mid-afternoon one of celery sticks and hummus or nut butter,
or a handful of salted nuts. For dinner, instead of my former Lean
Cuisine or Healthy Choice frozen dinner (and no dessert) I start with a
good-sized wedge of meat pate, follow it with a small salad, a good
sized serving (at least 6 oz) of meat, poultry or fish (by preference
salmon), and two 3/4 cup to full cup servings of various lower carb
veggies (broccoli, caulifower, zucchini, green beans, &quot;patty pan&quot;
squash....). For dessert I'll have a wedge of camembert or brie with
fruit, a serving of low-carb ice cream, or a concoction called &quot;Ricotta
Creme&quot; (from the &quot;South Beach Diet&quot;) which consists of ricotta cheese
sweetened with sucarose flavored with various &quot;extracts&quot;, and garnished
with toasted almond slivers or a sprinkle of (unsweetened) cocoa

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes. The consensus is that the only way to produce weight loss is with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a hypocaloric diet. All successful diets are hypocaloric. All
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;unsuccessful diets are not hypocaloric.

&gt;&gt;&gt; diets are all unsuccessful. &quot;Lifestyle change&quot; is successful.

&gt;&gt;You have to eat. However you eat, it's a diet.

&gt; It depends what you mean by &quot;diet&quot;. Most people here (UK) say
&gt;&quot;diet&quot; to mean what one eats, &quot;a diet&quot; or &quot;diets&quot; to mean faddy
&gt; ideas that you do for a fixed period. I'm unclear which we are
&gt; talking about.

"/> Well, keeping the weight off with Atkins also involves a &quot;lifestyle
change&quot;, but it's much easier than with other reducing diets - you
simply limit, permanently, your intake of refined carbohydrates (which
is not difficult, once you've rid your body of the craving for them -
sort of like quitting smoking). You don't have to deny yourself those
cakes and pastries forever, but once you no longer crave them, you are
satisfied with the occasional &quot;treat&quot;, without getting &quot;hooked&quot; again!

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, they need to _reduce_ their intake of food and/or _increase_ their
&gt;&gt;&gt; exercise until they are consuming fewer calories than they burn. At
&gt;&gt;&gt; that point, they will lose weight.

&gt;&gt;I think you really don't know. You are basing your argument on
&gt;&gt;thermodynamics and the erroneous assumption that the human body is 100%
&gt;&gt;efficient.

&gt; the body isn't 100% efficient so the statement is only 95%
&gt; correct. As you cant measure your calorie intake 100%
&gt; efficiently, or the calories you burn does it matter? Just eat
&gt; less until you start losing weight, then stick to that lifestyle.
&gt; Its tough, but lifes like that.

"/> But the point Mr. Smith is making is that many on some of the
weight-loss groups being cross-posted to ARE losing weight eating MORE
calories than before, by severely restricting &quot;refined&quot; carbohydrates!
(I can certainly vouch that it's a HELL of a lot easier to stick to than
the &quot;stay hungry all the time&quot; method.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The standard seat size should be based on the standard
&gt;person size, which is an average that must include fat

"/>  If they did that, fewer people would be able to fit on the plane and
ticket prices would go up accordingly - for everyone, not just people
with extra freight built in. Of the roughly 110 people on the
aforementioned flight to Chicago absolutely NO ONE had any trouble
fitting into a seat. 0%. The average passenger fit well into their
seat.
I weigh 170# at 5'10&quot;. If someone else weighs 340# at 5'10&quot; it would
be grossly unfair for me to have to foot the bill for *their* &quot;extra
passenger&quot;, which is precisely what you're suggesting.
And your &quot;fair&quot; idea to set an average won't help fat people either -
if you average the two aforementioned weights you'll come up with it'll
come out to 255#, which makes for a nice, big comfy (if overpriced) seat
for me but still isn't big enough for for someone twice my weight.

But let's invert this for a bit. Let's say that 340# is a &quot;normal&quot;
weight for a 5'10&quot; human. As a person that weighs half that, would it
be fair for me to demand that the airlines accomodate me by providing a
half-size seat at half the price?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Currently, the standard seat size does not take fat people
&gt;into account. That is discrimination.

"/>  A ludicrous assertion. The airline is not denying service to anyone -
they're merely insisting that fat people pay their fair share of the
freight bill.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Since you can't solve the problem fairly

"/>  Here's a fair idea: Weigh-ins. Just like most anything else that
requires shipment, you pay by the pound to cover costs of space on-board
and fuel just as if you were bringing extra luggage along. If you can
provide an authorized medical waiver that states your weight is the
result of something other than overeating (the most common cause of
obesity) then you get an appropriate handicap discount.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&quot;epidemic&quot;. Just like it's illegal for a barkeep to continue to sell
anything but soft drinks to a drunk person, make it illegal to sell
anything but lettuce and low-fat salad dressing to a fat person that
isn't overweight as a result of a medical condition.

&gt;&gt;the modern diet is full of sugar, refined flour, potatoes and the like,
&gt;&gt;and these things are making them hungry? Hunger like that is not
&gt;&gt;imaginary, I can assure you of that.
The Reid wrote:
&gt; Dont forget many people eat as a displacement activity.

"/> True, or because they are thirsty (some people misrecognise thirst as
hunger) or bored, or because they are under pressure to accept food
from friends or family members, or for any one of hundreds of reasons,
some of which may be to do with hunger and others to do with societal
pressures.

Food in our societies is more than just fuel for the body, in many
ways it's seen as symbolic or is sold to us as being symbolic of a
wider lifestyle. Don't believe me? Just watch those food adverts and
cooking programmes. Obesity is a complicated matter with very many
causes, *not* all of which are to do with greed - hence my comments on
portion size and the complicity of the food industry. And they are
not the only ones.

For example, one thing our friend from Paris hasn't yet covered - or
even approached - is societal and family attitudes towards food, and
their effects on obesity. There are many families in which exchange
of food is symbolic of exchange of affection, and where refusal of
prepared dishes is seen as akin to refusal either of the preparer's
affection or the preparer themselves.

Having said that, I think that obesity, definitely, is at least partly
to do with the blood sugar spikes and crashes which Martin describes.
Without those, the blandishments of the advertisers, family members,
friends and colleagues is much easier to resist.

I would also say that those who are family members, friends and
colleagues of those who are trying to lose weight, in fact everyone -
you and me all - have a responsibility not to make things more
difficult both for the obese and the dieters than they need be. There
are lots of things people can do to help, from not offering candies
around in the workplace and at home (you know the 'one won't hurt,
will it?' theory of emotional blackmail), by not pressing an extra
portion of anything on someone who doesn't want it (again, the claim
of 'it won't hurt just this once?' causes a lot of harm) and generally
leaving off with the weight/food comments. It doesn't help, and may
make things worse.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then you should say *adequate* fat as well.

&gt;&gt; Why? My protien intake hasn't changed at all, and it was never 'high'-
20%
&gt;&gt; at most. What's changed is the ratio of fat and carbs, and the type of
&gt;&gt; carbs.

&gt; Great. That's what changed for you. The fact that your fat percentage
&gt; increased doesn't mean your diet is high in fat. Your fat percentage
&gt; will go up, when you lower your carb percentage, even if you don't
&gt; increase your fat intake at all.

"/> Well yeah, but the high/low crapola is specfically tied to the AMA's idea of
what is reasonable. Since the poster asked about high fat/protien without
qualifiers, I assumed he used that common definition. That was the point of
using the word
'adequate', in the first place. One word to convey a correction about a
misconception *and* giving the hint of an idea that some thought had gone
into just how much was 'adequate' without swamping him in details, using the
same referent.

"/> No, I don't mean the increased price should be a business class or first

"/> Yes, once again they have ignored the fat people demographic, as if
there aren't a lot of fat people in the US.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Then you are arguing for allowing the airlines to determine
&gt;&gt;what the standard seat size is. Why?

&gt; Umm, because they're also responsible for setting the price on that
&gt; seat? In a free-enterprise system the airlines can do as they see fit
&gt; and everybody else can take the train (or boat) as necessary.

"/> Then they could make the seats even smaller, and pack them even closer
together. You wouldn't like that, but if they all got together and
decided to do it, you would have no choice. That's why the government
intervenes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;The standard seat size should be based on the standard
&gt;&gt;person size, which is an average that must include fat
&gt;&gt;people.

&gt; If they did that, fewer people would be able to fit on the plane and
&gt; ticket prices would go up accordingly - for everyone, not just people
&gt; with extra freight built in. Of the roughly 110 people on the
&gt; aforementioned flight to Chicago absolutely NO ONE had any trouble
&gt; fitting into a seat. 0%. The average passenger fit well into their
&gt; seat.

"/> Yes, and that would be the case most of the time, so very few large size
seats would be needed, and ticket prioces wouldn't have to be changed

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I weigh 170# at 5'10&quot;. If someone else weighs 340# at 5'10&quot; it would

&gt; passenger&quot;, which is precisely what you're suggesting.
&gt; And your &quot;fair&quot; idea to set an average won't help fat people either -
&gt; if you average the two aforementioned weights you'll come up with it'll
&gt; come out to 255#, which makes for a nice, big comfy (if overpriced) seat
&gt; for me but still isn't big enough for for someone twice my weight.

"/> I was actually think of an adjustable seat.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But let's invert this for a bit. Let's say that 340# is a &quot;normal&quot;

&gt; half-size seat at half the price?

"/> I don't understand your example.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Currently, the standard seat size does not take fat people

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Since you can't solve the problem fairly

&gt; and fuel just as if you were bringing extra luggage along. If you can
&gt; provide an authorized medical waiver that states your weight is the
&gt; result of something other than overeating (the most common cause of
&gt; obesity) then you get an appropriate handicap discount.

"/> Fair enough.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;(you have just demonstrated that), the government ought to

&gt; anything but lettuce and low-fat salad dressing to a fat person that
&gt; isn't overweight as a result of a medical condition.

state. Diets are religions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The escalator is an egregious example because (A) it's overwhelmingly used

Interesting (if interminable) debate.

My own observations:

1. When I go out to lunch with fat people, or watch them at buffet
restaurants, I'm always astonished by the gargantuan portions they
choose, repeatedly; how fast they shovel it down; and how they seem to
make all the wrong food choices (platefuls of deep-fried everything). I
don't know *why* they eat that way, but it certainly doesn't seem to be
any mystery why they're obese.

2. My wife and I are both 74. She decided last year to peel off some
pounds, went regularly to Weight Watchers for eight or nine months,
followed their point system religiously (which is just another version
of calorie counting), and managed to lose a total of 45 pounds. She's
now down to 140, and has remained there for several months. I'm about 5'
10&quot; and weigh under 150 so I don't have much to lose, but I find I can
vary my weight up and down by five pounds or more just by being extra
careful about what I eat. We try to walk briskly for 40 minutes every day.

Nutrition Action magazine, an ad-free journal published by the Centre
for Science in the Public Interest, says it's necessary to cut out 500
calories a day (3,500 calories a week) to lose a pound a week. It's not
easy -- particularly when something like a McDonald's triple thick shake
can account for 1,170 calories all by itself!

Good luck to those who are losing successfully.

&gt; I never based anything on such a premise. I invalidated it.

&gt;&gt; That is a flip-flop from your original arguement. Your exact words
&gt;&gt; were:

&gt;&gt;&quot;Then Americans must have a common gene of some kind, because they are
&gt;&gt; all fat, and most of the rest of the world is thin. Given the genetic
&gt;&gt; variety of Americans in other respects, how do you explain this?&quot;

&gt; I wasn't making up an argument of my own, I was illustrating a logical
&gt; conclusion drawn from the (incorrect) premises assumed by someone else.
&gt; In so doing, I made it obvious that the premises were wrong.

&gt;&gt; Make up your mind. Either your contention is that Americans have
&gt;&gt; common gene of some kind which makes them fat, or obesity is not a
&gt;&gt; genetically determined problem, in which case American could not have
&gt;&gt; a common fat gene.

&gt; Read my posts more carefully.

"/> I read it as carefully as necessary. Your arguement was poorly worded.

When you write...&quot;Then Americans must have a common gene of some kind,
because they are all fat, and most of the rest of the world is thin.&quot; the
implied conclusion is that &quot;American must have a common gene of some kind&quot;.
Introducing an arguement with a statement which you're attempting to prove
is not true, without actually saying the evidence you are presenting
discredits the statement, is a poor way to present an arguement.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Your original claim was &quot;all Americans are fat&quot;, then you backpedeled
&gt;&gt; to most Americans are fat, and now you're making the presumption that
&gt;&gt; when you see an obese person that they are American.

&gt; I don't presume that obese tourists are American, I just consider it
&gt; highly probable. Usually they are. Sometimes British and German
&gt; tourists get pretty fat, but most of the real fatties are American.

&gt;&gt; In other words, your evidence is based purely on anecdotal evidence
&gt;&gt; ...

&gt; I see thousands of tourists. While they all have a few things in
&gt; common (the means to come here, and the will), they are in many
&gt; respects a random cross section of the nationalities they represent.
&gt; Unless one of their common traits is correlated with obesity (I am
&gt; willing to consider evidence along these lines), their obesity or lack
&gt; thereof is representative of the general trend in the populations from
&gt; which they are drawn.

"/> I work on a campus with almost 20,000 students (many of them international)
and almost 10,000 employees. I have seen no correlation between obesity and
those that &quot;appear&quot; to be non-American.

There. My anecdotal evidence disagrees with your anecdotal evidence. If
you you have something more substantial to submit as evidence to support
your assertion that &quot;all americans are fat&quot; (or most) and &quot;most of the rest
of the world is thin&quot;, now would be a good time to present it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I didn't say that you were. Presumably, you're engaging in debate and
&gt;&gt; claiming that you're good at it.

&gt; I think my posts speak for themselves, so I'll leave the final
&gt; determination as an exercise for the reader.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I never eat cakes, biscuits (cookies) pastries or anything sweet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or pastry. Presumably I would have to give up bread and pasta?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What about potatoes?

&gt;&gt;&gt;You don't have to give up anything if you don't have a food allergy, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;insulin issues. Just eat smaller portions (usually much smaller) of carb
&gt;&gt;&gt;laden foods. Focus on getting plenty of good lowcarb veggies and quality
&gt;&gt;&gt;fats, like olive oil.

&gt;&gt; So with potatoes in mayonnaise its seen to be the potatoes not
&gt;&gt; the mayo that is the problem!

&gt; Yes, believe it or not. I love potatos and potatos love me so much back
&gt; that I gained 50 pounds eating them (and nearly drove everyone near me away
&gt; with my blood sugar swings strongly affecting my mental state). I've
&gt; switched to different veggies and mayo and other fats for my calories and
&gt; I've dropped thirty of those pounds, and I'm a lot saner now too. :)

&gt; It doesn't seem reasonable, but it works and works well.

&gt; revek one potato a day covered in cheese and sour cream (and nothing else)
&gt; for 18 months = a 50 pound gain on me. The secret? Got very very depressed
&gt; and literally slept 16 hours a day for those 18 months. So yes, I did too
&gt; gain weight on 800 calories a day (roughly speaking). Calories alone is
&gt; not the whole story.

&gt;No, I don't mean the increased price should be a business

somewhereabouts 40-50+ different commercial flights and once via private

one passenger large enough for special seating. Recollecting time spent
in airports, I can say I don't recall seeing too much of anyone that
wouldn't fit (or at least squeeze) into a coach-class seat.
Ergo contenplorum, most overweight folk (or at least those prone to
airline travel) are not quite *that* overweight.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;They already do that. Didn't you know?
&gt;&gt;Not all airlines make that accomodation. When I flew out to
&gt;&gt;Chicago last summer it was on a budget flight with no &quot;first
&gt;&gt;class&quot; section on the plane at all.
&gt;Yes, once again they have ignored the fat people demographic,
&gt;as if there aren't a lot of fat people in the US.

"/>  See above; your alleged demographic doesn't exist, or at least it
doesn't have much significance, or at least not enough to consider
refitting an entire fleet of planes with larger and less-profitable
seating. It'd be cheaper to settle potential out-of-court and continue
to discriminate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Then you are arguing for allowing the airlines to determine
&gt;&gt;&gt;what the standard seat size is. Why?
&gt;&gt;Umm, because they're also responsible for setting the price
&gt;&gt;on that seat? In a free-enterprise system the airlines can
&gt;&gt;do as they see fit and everybody else can take the train (or
&gt;&gt;boat) as necessary.
&gt;Then they could make the seats even smaller, and pack them even
&gt;closer together.

"/>  Don't be silly; besides, you're the one that brought demographics into
play here. Airline coach-class seats are tested by a variety of people,
no doubt some of whom will be wider and/or taller than average; such
things are also tested for smaller passengers (ie. children). A team of
designers then sends the appropriate design spec to Boeing or whomever.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;You wouldn't like that, but if they all got together and
&gt;decided to do it, you would have no choice.

"/>  Actually I think the seat spacing is already too small; I can tell ya
about a few semi-nightmare flights as a result thereof. Flying anywhere
nowadays is a major peeve unto itself for lots of other reasons though.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;That's why the government intervenes.

"/>  No. The government only intervenes when public welfare would be
threatened. Requiring a passenger to purchase a separate seat for
freight purposes is at the sole discretion of the indivdual airlines.
If the demographic starts to threaten profit margin is the only point at
which an airline might decide to re-engineer its aircraft for larger
passengers.

[..anecdotal example..]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;The average passenger fit well into their seat.
&gt;Yes, and that would be the case most of the time, so very few
&gt;large size seats would be needed, and ticket prioces wouldn't
&gt;have to be changed much, if at all.

"/>  See above. Airlines aren't going to refit seating unless a
demographically significant number of oversize passengers make a fuss;
anecdotal monkey business about one passenger on one flight isn't going
to make a host of airline companies change their policy nor will it
likely warrant any goverment action. Which is as it should be.

[...]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;And your &quot;fair&quot; idea to set an average won't help fat people
&gt;&gt;either - if you average the two aforementioned weights you'll
&gt;&gt;come up with it'll come out to 255#, which makes for a nice,
&gt;&gt;big comfy (if overpriced) seat for me but still isn't big
&gt;&gt;enough for for someone twice my weight.
&gt;I was actually think of an adjustable seat.

"/>  Specious reasoning; you still have to leave room for the seat to fully
expand, therefore it's space you can't use for anything else. Some
aircraft I've flown in are already equipped with very limited wheelchair
seating - but that's really only for truly handicapped folk, who should
not be put out by an overweight customer.
Unless of course you're proposing that extremely overweight people be
governmentally afforded handicapped status, which is a whole 'nother
argument altogether.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;But let's invert this for a bit. Let's say that 340# is a &quot;normal&quot;
&gt;&gt;weight for a 5'10&quot; human. As a person that weighs half that, would it
&gt;&gt;be fair for me to demand that the airlines accomodate me by providing a
&gt;&gt;half-size seat at half the price?
&gt;I don't understand your example.

"/>  It was simple enough; hypothesize that *all* airline seats would be
created for folks that would normally occupy two of the current-sized
seats. Would it be fair to charge me for a full-price ticket if I will
only occupy half of the seat? Shouldn't I be given a substantial
discount for my svelte frame?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently, the standard seat size does not take fat people
&gt;&gt;&gt;into account. That is discrimination.
&gt;&gt;A ludicrous assertion. The airline is not denying service to
&gt;&gt;anyone - they're merely insisting that fat people pay their
&gt;&gt;fair share of the freight bill.
&gt;A ludicrous assertion.

"/>  Polly wanna cracker?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The airline discriminates on the basis of size by requiring
&gt;fat people to buy two seats.

"/>  That's *not* discrimination. It would be discrimination if they
refused to allow the person on the plane at all, but that's not the
case. Labeling such a policy as &quot;discriminatory&quot; borders on libel.

If you think there's some foul plot at work by the airline companies
to make fat people feel bad, I suggest you read:

http://www.southwest.com/about_swa/press/additional_seat.html

..and you'll understand a bit more about the reality of things rather
than making petty whines about &quot;discrimination&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Since you can't solve the problem fairly
&gt;&gt;Here's a fair idea: Weigh-ins. Just like most anything else
&gt;&gt;that requires shipment, you pay by the pound to cover costs
&gt;&gt;of space on-board and fuel just as if you were bringing extra
&gt;&gt;luggage along. If you can provide an authorized medical waiver
&gt;&gt;that states your weight is the result of something other than
&gt;&gt;overeating (the most common cause of obesity) then you get an
&gt;&gt;appropriate handicap discount.
&gt;Fair enough.

"/>  It would be except that available anecdotal evidence suggests that
oversize people consider the policy of even reserving (much less
actually purchasing) an extra seat to accomodate their bulk to be a
discriminatory practice. Which is, of course, completely assinine in my
book; wheelchair-bound folk have been doing it for years without almost
no complaints or congressional hearings at all. And the NAAFA's
solution of:

&quot;ARMREST UP - When you get to your seat during pre-boarding, raise the
armrest between seats. This may give you the inch or two of extra space
you need. The chances are that the passenger who will be seated next to
you won't say anything; if he does, smile pleasantly and say that you'll
both be more comfortable if the armrest is up. &quot;

My response to that particular line of bullshit would be, &quot;No, we'd
have both been more comfortable if you'd have had the courtesy to
purchase an extra seat for your freight&quot;,
But even the same NAAFA document that I nabbed the above snippet from
at least acknowleges that (considerate) oversize folks are wont to
purchase a second seat, which serves two purposes - it makes the
oversize patron more comfortable and prevents a potentially disastrous
encounter with a fellow passenger whose seat might otherwise be intruded
upon. Which is why I said earlier that airline companies should
consider *some* discount in accomodating oversize passengers, but they
shouldn't have to take it completely on the chin.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;The government should step in to help mollify the current
&gt;&gt;obesity &quot;epidemic&quot;. Just like it's illegal for a barkeep
&gt;&gt;to continue to sell anything but soft drinks to a drunk person,
&gt;&gt;make it illegal to sell anything but lettuce and low-fat salad
&gt;&gt;dressing to a fat person that isn't overweight as a result of
&gt;&gt;a medical condition.
&gt;Not fair, because it violates the principle of separation of
&gt;church and state. Diets are religions.

"/>  Say what you will, but IMHO selling Twinkies to already-overweight
people is more of a crime than an airline charging extra for freight.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Did you think the airline seat size was passed down from God?
&gt;&gt;No more than the recipie for Hostess Twinkies is.
&gt;So you do think the seat size was passed down from God?

"/>  What part of the first word of the sentence I wrote when I replied to
that stupid query the first time did you not understand?

I do, however, get the feeling that you think oversized people should
be afforded all the courtesy and discount that handicapped folk get.
Feel free to refute that thought if the observation isn't accurate.

"/> I've been flying for as many years as I've been alive. I've flown
more recently, due to living further away from relatives but, I'd say
I've logged about 1.5 times your travel on everything from a Piper
Cherokee to a 747.

In recent years, maybe because I do now reside in the land of
butterfat, I have seen at least one passenger per flight that
has requested the seatbelt extensions. My horror story begins
in Detroit. Our connection from Indianapolis was late and the
only two seats near each other were two aisle seats in the back
of the plane. I'm a smallish woman -- about 20.5% body fat, 5'5&quot;
BMI of 22 -- compared to my 6' 172# husband, so I got the seat
next to the large couple. She had raised the armrest up to allow
herself to spill over into my seat. They both had extensions and
had to ask for a *second* one for her spouse. I lowered the arm so that
I could have more of the room of my seat. She gave me a dirty look.
We had been up since 0330 - to make the hour+ drive to the airport,
negotiate self-park and the bus, check-in, security, etc; I was tired
and fell asleep. I awoke to an elbow jabbing me in my ribs. While
I slept she raised the arm and because I took up slightly more
than half my seat width my ribs were where her elbow would have been
if she put her hands at her side. We were making our intial descent,
so I didn't feel compelled to do anything but lower the armrest, again.
I got another dirty look.

THis is not the first time I have had to accomodate someone else
who failed to fit in their seat and needed some of mine; although,
it was the first time I got bruises. I think we got a bargain
fare of $200 during the peak of summer to a summer destination.
If the people with the 3 extensions had paid for one extra seat,
it still would have been a good fare at $300/pp and they wouldn't
have been so inconvenienced by my size 6 ass.

relevance or whose relevance is limited to perpetuating
undesirable social policy.

Telling a fat person she can't be hired because she's fat
for a job that has no relevant physical requirements is one
thing.

Telling a fat person she must pay for the space she occupies
on an airplane is another.

The point mikey's trying to get through your head can be
restated another way.

Airlines have finite interior space. The number of seats
they can sell is dependent on the size of the space and the
size of the seats. They have to generate as much revenue
per seat as they can to be profitable. If they reduce the
number of seats by 40% to accomodate fat people, you should
expect the costs of the seats to go up 40%. Correct?

Why should a person who can fit into one of the current
seats subsidize a larger seat for someone who needs it?

Why is that fair to the smaller person?

"/> One problem would be, if certain larger seats are made available, a large number
of passengers will want them - not just the obese or even overweight. How does
one deal with that? Query those who reserve by phone or online? Measure them
when they appear for the flight? What do you do with the large-but-can-fit pax
who sign up for these seats? And that minority of folks who always seem to
define for themselves soooome reason they haaaaave to have the better situations
in general? Say you're a ticket agent - you wanna deal with all that??

I also get back to the point that Mike also makes (I think) - there aren't
thaaaaaat many pax who really can't fit in the seats. I got my (at the time)
210 lb 6 foot tall person's pregnant broad beam in an economy class airline seat
- I've observed most large folks can - beer-bellied, overweight, whatever.
There's not much shifting around or slouching room to be sure, but by and large
(pun) the passengers fit in their seats - yes, with the armrest down. So we're
really talking about people several sigmas away from the mean who are really too
large to fit - the truly obese.

I'd be for offering 50% off a second seat - it may still get to the problems of
definition and perception as to need I described above, but I think to a much
lesser extent.

9.1 Does PCOS cause obesity, or does obesity cause PCOS?

In some ways, this question is akin to asking, &quot;Which came first, the
chicken or the egg?&quot; since it isn't completely understood, but it appears
more likely that PCOS comes first. Symptoms of PCOS may be lessened by
weight loss, or increased by weight gain, but the syndrome is not caused by
weight or body mass. There are lean women with PCOS. The insulin resistance
that is common to PCOS may play a role in weight gain and the difficulty in
losing any extra weight.

In addition, 40% of women with PCOS develop diabetes.

Those two dogs of the apocalypse run together far too often to not be

&gt;&gt;Which is as it should be.
&gt;One problem would be, if certain larger seats are made available,

reinforcement to insure additional freight stays put in the event of
an emergency.

&gt;There's not much shifting around or slouching room to be
&gt;sure, but by and large (pun) the passengers fit in their
&gt;seats - yes, with the armrest down. So we're really talking
&gt;about people several sigmas away from the mean who are really

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/>  The link to the SWAirlines link I posted explains that they're doing
almost that - if you don't pay for a second seat when you buy the
first and the second is required you'll have to pay for the seat
provided one is available in which case you otherwise take a bump.
But if the plane isn't full they'll actually refund the full ticket
price, thus providing a completely FREE second-seat.
If that's the policy the NAAFA got hackles up about they need to get
much more of a fingerhold on reality, shut the fuck up, and elect some
officers that are at least a *bit* more emotionally stable.

to be lower cholesterol (nutritionists for years have been arguing that
&quot;dietary&quot; cholesterol has no relationship to blood choloesterol -
apparently they were right) and more nearly optimum results for blood
screenings straight across the board, lower blood pressure (even before
any significant weight loss might account for it), more physical energy,
a more positive attitude toward life, and overall better general health.
(It was not he who recommended the diet, BTW, but that's what he told me
when I asked about trying it - he'd seen very good overall health
results in patients of his who WERE using Atkins or South Beach or any

&gt;&gt;You don't have to give up anything if you don't have a food allergy, or
&gt;&gt;insulin issues. Just eat smaller portions (usually much smaller) of carb
&gt;&gt;laden foods. Focus on getting plenty of good lowcarb veggies and quality
&gt;&gt;fats, like olive oil.

&gt; So with potatoes in mayonnaise its seen to be the potatoes not

&gt;&gt;A ludicrous assertion. The airline discriminates on the basis of size by

&gt; undesirable social policy.

"/> As long as the airline charges a reasonable fee for the extra space,
rather than two full fares, then it is fair. But remember that the only
reason there is a problem in the first place is because the seat size
was set by designers who decided that fat people don't deserve a proper
seat on an airplane. They could have designed bench seats. Why didn't
they use bench seats? Safety cannot possibly be the reason, soince if
the airplane crashes, you're dead anyway. Bench seats would have solved
the whole problem.

extra for using the toilet. Charge extra for meals.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The point mikey's trying to get through your head can be
&gt; restated another way.

&gt; Airlines have finite interior space. The number of seats
&gt; they can sell is dependent on the size of the space and the
&gt; size of the seats. They have to generate as much revenue
&gt; per seat as they can to be profitable. If they reduce the
&gt; number of seats by 40% to accomodate fat people, you should
&gt; expect the costs of the seats to go up 40%. Correct?

"/> No. I didn't say they should reduce the number of seats by 40%, and it
wouldn't cause a 40% rise anyway. There would be a lot less weight, so
the fuel cost would drop significantly. There would be 40% fewer meals,
so the cost of that service would drop significantly. And fewer cabin
staff would be needed, so the personnel cost would drop significantly.
The cost of a ticket might not have to be raised much at all, and we
would all be more comfortable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why should a person who can fit into one of the current

everyone is better off when it works.

&gt;&gt;&gt;No. They can charge extra fro wider seats.

&gt;&gt; But you've already lamented is that obese folk can't afford to buy
&gt;&gt; them so that argument is pretty much shot in the ass.

&gt; No, I don't mean the increased price should be a business class or first

&gt; percent premium, or something like that, for the extra space, is

this as does Virgin, I believe, though this &quot;premium&quot; economy reflects
leg room not width. If this were a viable business model, then
someone ought to try it. But here's the rub - can you mandate that a
larger than average person purchase in this class or are you
constrained to only offer it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;They already do that. Didn't you know?

&gt;&gt; Not all airlines make that accomodation. When I flew out to Chicago
&gt;&gt; last summer it was on a budget flight with no &quot;first class&quot; section on
&gt;&gt; the plane at all.
&gt; Yes, once again they have ignored the fat people demographic, as if
&gt; there aren't a lot of fat people in the US.

"/> That was that airlines overt choice. There business model is NOT to
provide a premium product. Southwest has the same philosophy as do
others, Ryannair, etc in Europe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Then you are arguing for allowing the airlines to determine
&gt;&gt;&gt;what the standard seat size is. Why?

&gt;&gt; Umm, because they're also responsible for setting the price on that
&gt;&gt; seat? In a free-enterprise system the airlines can do as they see fit
&gt;&gt; and everybody else can take the train (or boat) as necessary.

&gt; Then they could make the seats even smaller, and pack them even closer
&gt; together.

"/> There are airlines that have done this. The only linitation is with
respect to safety. Comfort is in the eyes of the beholder.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You wouldn't like that, but if they all got together and
&gt; decided to do it, you would have no choice.

"/> In the US it is illegal for companies that compete to collude on price
or product offering. If this were to happen, then the government
would be obligated to file suit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That's why the government
&gt; intervenes.

"/> In the case of collusion, certainly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;The standard seat size should be based on the standard
&gt;&gt;&gt;person size, which is an average that must include fat
&gt;&gt;&gt;people.

&gt;&gt; If they did that, fewer people would be able to fit on the plane and
&gt;&gt; ticket prices would go up accordingly - for everyone, not just people
&gt;&gt; with extra freight built in. Of the roughly 110 people on the
&gt;&gt; aforementioned flight to Chicago absolutely NO ONE had any trouble
&gt;&gt; fitting into a seat. 0%. The average passenger fit well into their
&gt;&gt; seat.

&gt; Yes, and that would be the case most of the time, so very few large size
&gt; seats would be needed, and ticket prioces wouldn't have to be changed
&gt; much, if at all.

"/> Once again - are you suggesting that airlines provide a section
(however large or small) of oversized seats sold at a nominal premium
and:

a) REQUIRE that any oversized passenger sit ONLY in those seats
b) OFFER those seats to oversized passengers as a conveninece but not
require that they purchase this more expensive ticket
c) OFFER those seats to anyone willing to pay extra for it under the
assumption that larger people would be more likely to do so?

&gt;&gt; I weigh 170# at 5'10&quot;. If someone else weighs 340# at 5'10&quot; it would

&gt;&gt; passenger&quot;, which is precisely what you're suggesting.
&gt;&gt; And your &quot;fair&quot; idea to set an average won't help fat people either -
&gt;&gt; if you average the two aforementioned weights you'll come up with it'll
&gt;&gt; come out to 255#, which makes for a nice, big comfy (if overpriced) seat
&gt;&gt; for me but still isn't big enough for for someone twice my weight.

&gt; I was actually think of an adjustable seat.

flexible in the case of undersold flights. It is not discriminatory
at all - airlines charge less for children, charge more for non-stops,
and have all sorts of policies that result in significant different
costs for travelers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Since you can't solve the problem fairly

&gt;&gt; Here's a fair idea: Weigh-ins. Just like most anything else that
&gt;&gt; requires shipment, you pay by the pound to cover costs of space on-board
&gt;&gt; and fuel just as if you were bringing extra luggage along. If you can
&gt;&gt; provide an authorized medical waiver that states your weight is the
&gt;&gt; result of something other than overeating (the most common cause of
&gt;&gt; obesity) then you get an appropriate handicap discount.

&gt; Fair enough.

"/> I always thought that would be the fairest option. I'm far from being
oversized and generally travel with just a small carryon bag - whereas
some of my fellow travelers are fairly large and travel with the

&gt;&gt; I never eat cakes, biscuits (cookies) pastries or anything sweet
&gt;&gt; or pastry. Presumably I would have to give up bread and pasta?
&gt;&gt; What about potatoes?

&gt;Not &quot;give up&quot; but be very cautious with - bread and pasta made with
&gt;white flour (especially that chemically bleached stuff they use in the
&gt;U.S.) is very high in &quot;bad&quot; carbs - as are white potatoes, which came as
&gt;a surprise to me - I had always thought they were very nutricious, and
&gt;high in fiber, but not really. That's not to say you can't EVER have
&gt;them, but you should limit your indulgence to only one thing of that
&gt;sort at a meal, and not at EVERY meal. (Also, if you find yourself
&gt;craving them, it's back to the strict diet until the craving goes away.)

"/> I only ever have one of these carbs at a meal. My idea of balance
in a meal is some protein, fish or meat, some carb, rice or
potato or couscous or pasta depending on which &quot;culture&quot; I am
cooking. Some veg. Usually cooked in olive oil unless that really
clashes with the norm, say a stir fry. (I'm talking the main meal
here). Breakfast is usually fruit when I have it plus some
fangled yoghurt that my wife thinks lowers cholesterol (Benecol)
or a piece of toast when all the fruit is out of season. Lunch is
usually a sandwich although I might have something potato based
if I have dug up some &quot;accidentals&quot;.

On cravings, I dont usually crave anything except alcohol, sex
and fast cars.

White potatoes? What are white potatoes, all my potatoes are
white. Some have red skins and there are black varieties, but the
latter are not grown much.

The refined issue. I glean from other posts that the refined
issue is about energy rushes and sugar swings etc, things I dont
get, so is refined an issue for me? (Fibre aside).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Once again - are you suggesting that airlines provide a section
&gt; (however large or small) of oversized seats sold at a nominal premium
&gt; and:

&gt; a) REQUIRE that any oversized passenger sit ONLY in those seats
&gt; b) OFFER those seats to oversized passengers as a conveninece but not
&gt; require that they purchase this more expensive ticket
&gt; c) OFFER those seats to anyone willing to pay extra for it under the
&gt; assumption that larger people would be more likely to do so?

But actually, I think bench seats with open seating would be the optimal
solution.

"/> Blood glucose drops rapidly, over the course of half an hour or so.
Glycogen--starchy stuff stored mostly in the liver--is burned to produce
more glucose, which is a simple process. There is enough glycogen in a
fully fed person to provide about 2000 kcal. When this is exhausted,
the body must resort to other means of providing glucose, including
temporary sacrifice of muscle, and glucose levels drop while this
adaptation is carried out. This can cause a feeling of fatigue. Under
normal conditions, this takes almost all day to happen, and most people
will eat before it occurs. In marathon runners, it may occur after only
an hour or so (when they hit the &quot;wall,&quot; if I'm not mistaken). After a
few days of fasting, the body manages to get the brain used to ketones,
and the fatigue goes away.

Immediate fatigue and weakness after a heavy meal is due to the
&quot;postprandial dip,&quot; a drop in blood glucose caused by the automatic
release of insulin to control a rise in glucose after the eating of a
heavy meal. The effect is usually mild; it is this effect that
encourages many people to take a brief nap after a big lunch. It is
physiologically normal. In people with impaired glucose metabolism,
though, it can be much more dramatic.

Hypoglycemia (that is, low levels of blood glucose) in general produces
fatigue, headache, weakness, nausea, etc., depending on how severe it
is. Mild hypoglycemia, such as that seen in the postprandial dip, is
often asymptomatic.

&gt;&gt;&gt;a fuss; anecdotal monkey business about one passenger on one

&gt;&gt;&gt;their policy nor will it likely warrant any goverment action.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Which is as it should be.
&gt;&gt;One problem would be, if certain larger seats are made available,
&gt;&gt;a large number of passengers will want them - not just the obese
&gt;&gt;or even overweight. How does one deal with that?

&gt;&quot;Expanded Coach Seating available&quot; - around 1.5x of a regular ticket
&gt;price, possibly with discount going to those that can produce some
&gt;sort of medical affidavit. Not all the amenities of a &quot;First Class&quot;
&gt;seat, obviously, just a bigger chair, possibly with some additional
&gt;reinforcement to insure additional freight stays put in the event of
&gt;an emergency.

&gt;&gt;Query those who reserve by phone or online? Measure them when
&gt;&gt;they appear for the flight? What do you do with the
&gt;&gt;large-but-can-fit pax who sign up for these seats?

&gt; Just work it into the usual service counter routine.
&gt;&quot;May I interest you in or do you require an available Expanded Coach
&gt;seat?&quot; If the ticket is being purchased in person, so much the easier
&gt;to determine whether such an offer should be made.

&gt;&gt;And that minority of folks who always seem to define for
&gt;&gt;themselves soooome reason they haaaaave to have the better
&gt;&gt;situations in general?

&gt; And why should just oversize folk benefit anyway? Moms/Dads with
&gt;carry-on crotchfruit, people with pulled hamstrings for whom being
&gt;jostled is moderately painful, the inevitable dipshit who thinks a
&gt;tent is carry-on luggage, and commuting professional wrestlers can all
&gt;enjoy a slight cut above for a slight jack in price. Shewt,
&gt;considering all the numbnuts I've gotten stuck next to on flights, if

&gt;&gt;I got my (at the time) 210 lb 6 foot tall person's pregnant
&gt;&gt;broad beam in an economy class airline seat - I've observed
&gt;&gt;most large folks can - beer-bellied, overweight, whatever.
&gt;&gt;There's not much shifting around or slouching room to be
&gt;&gt;sure, but by and large (pun) the passengers fit in their
&gt;&gt;seats - yes, with the armrest down. So we're really talking
&gt;&gt;about people several sigmas away from the mean who are really
&gt;&gt;too large to fit - the truly obese.

&gt; Yup; I've been trying to keep a distinction between the actual
&gt;oversized passenger versus ones that're merely overweight.

&gt;&gt;I'd be for offering 50% off a second seat - it may still get
&gt;&gt;to the problems of definition and perception as to need I
&gt;&gt;described above, but I think to a much lesser extent.

&gt; The link to the SWAirlines link I posted explains that they're doing
&gt;almost that - if you don't pay for a second seat when you buy the
&gt;first and the second is required you'll have to pay for the seat
&gt;provided one is available in which case you otherwise take a bump.
&gt;But if the plane isn't full they'll actually refund the full ticket
&gt;price, thus providing a completely FREE second-seat.
&gt; If that's the policy the NAAFA got hackles up about they need to get
&gt;much more of a fingerhold on reality, shut the fuck up, and elect some
&gt;officers that are at least a *bit* more emotionally stable.

"/> Well, the whole *premise* of NAAFA being that all society should accept and
embrace a reversible, extremely unhealthy condition, how much wisdom would be
expected from those who would lead that...

I do understand their points that FF miles should be given based on seats
actually bought, and that two fat flyers (I guess these types often hook up)
should be able to arrange to buy a single extra seat between them.

But if a fat passenger ever tries that line &quot;we'll both be more comfortable with
the armrest up&quot;, he or she won't be pleased with my response. It would be
something on the order of &quot;&gt;ahem&lt; - no, just *you* would be more comfortable -
my comfort needs are that the armrest stays down&quot;

Banty (&quot;Hi, neighbor - we'll both be comfortable if my dogs can shit in your
yard too..&quot;)

&gt;I think you can mandate that a larger than average person either

&gt;&gt; That was that airlines overt choice. There business model is NOT to

&gt;They should switch to bench seats.

&gt;&gt; Once again - are you suggesting that airlines provide a section
&gt;&gt; (however large or small) of oversized seats sold at a nominal premium
&gt;&gt; and:

&gt;&gt; a) REQUIRE that any oversized passenger sit ONLY in those seats
&gt;&gt; b) OFFER those seats to oversized passengers as a conveninece but not
&gt;&gt; require that they purchase this more expensive ticket
&gt;&gt; c) OFFER those seats to anyone willing to pay extra for it under the

&gt;lobster, you pay more. I don't think your second example clears up your
&gt;first one at all.

"/> Don't be obtuse. You can fairly read into the query

Now answer the question.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently, the standard seat size does not take fat people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;into account. That is discrimination.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A ludicrous assertion. The airline is not denying service to anyone -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they're merely insisting that fat people pay their fair share of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; freight bill.
&gt;&gt;&gt;A ludicrous assertion. The airline discriminates on the basis of size by
&gt;&gt;&gt;requiring fat people to buy two seats.
&gt;&gt; Not all discrimination is bad. The word itself refers to a
&gt;&gt; neutral differentiation process. Discrimination becomes bad
&gt;&gt; when it is based on factors that do not have practical
&gt;&gt; relevance or whose relevance is limited to perpetuating
&gt;&gt; undesirable social policy.
&gt;As long as the airline charges a reasonable fee for the extra space,
&gt;rather than two full fares, then it is fair. But remember that the only
&gt;reason there is a problem in the first place is because the seat size
&gt;was set by designers who decided that fat people don't deserve a proper
&gt;seat on an airplane. They could have designed bench seats. Why didn't
&gt;they use bench seats? Safety cannot possibly be the reason, soince if
&gt;the airplane crashes, you're dead anyway. Bench seats would have solved
&gt;the whole problem.

"/> They are bench seats, mainly. They just have armrests in
places you don't agree with.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Telling a fat person she can't be hired because she's fat
&gt;&gt; for a job that has no relevant physical requirements is one
&gt;&gt; thing.
&gt;&gt; Telling a fat person she must pay for the space she occupies
&gt;&gt; on an airplane is another.
&gt;Fine, then charge extra for people with coughs and runny noses. Charge
&gt;extra for people who ate garlic the night before. Charge extra for
&gt;people who take the shoes off or didn't use deoderant. Charge extra for
&gt;people who play their walkman so everyone else can hear it. Charge extra
&gt;for crying children. Charge extra for every ounce of luggage. Charge
&gt;extra for using the toilet. Charge extra for meals.

"/> These people aren't taking up extra space, are they?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The point mikey's trying to get through your head can be
&gt;&gt; restated another way.
&gt;&gt; Airlines have finite interior space. The number of seats
&gt;&gt; they can sell is dependent on the size of the space and the
&gt;&gt; size of the seats. They have to generate as much revenue
&gt;&gt; per seat as they can to be profitable. If they reduce the
&gt;&gt; number of seats by 40% to accomodate fat people, you should
&gt;&gt; expect the costs of the seats to go up 40%. Correct?
&gt;No. I didn't say they should reduce the number of seats by 40%, and it
&gt;wouldn't cause a 40% rise anyway. There would be a lot less weight, so
&gt;the fuel cost would drop significantly. There would be 40% fewer meals,
&gt;so the cost of that service would drop significantly. And fewer cabin
&gt;staff would be needed, so the personnel cost would drop significantly.
&gt;The cost of a ticket might not have to be raised much at all, and we
&gt;would all be more comfortable.

"/> Have you sold any of the major carriers on your fascinating
economic proposal?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Why should a person who can fit into one of the current
&gt;&gt; seats subsidize a larger seat for someone who needs it?
&gt;For the same reason collectivism is used everywhere else. Because
&gt;everyone is better off when it works.

"/> No. Everyone is better off when they pay their own freight,
if they can.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Why is that fair to the smaller person?
&gt;Because he doesn't have to complain about fat people anymore.

"/> That has nothing to do with economic fairness.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Every inch used for larger seats takes away from the number of normal

&gt;&gt;&gt; Your argument is to get rid of first class and business class altogether

&gt;&gt; They charge a premium for business and first class that far exceeds the

&gt; Yes, I said that. The incomes of the people who pay for those seats far
&gt; exceeds the income of almost everybody.

"/> But the point is that the airline recoups the loss, which is what justifies
the existence of those seats to the beancounters. This is why my argument in

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I mean a completely different seating arrangement. I think bunk beds
&gt;&gt;&gt; would be the best.

&gt;&gt; Now we're talking. I've been wanting that for a long time. I wonder what's
&gt;&gt; stopping them.

&gt; Greed.

"/> Seems like some clever monkey out there must be able to find a way to get
the same passenger density with bunkbeds as seats. There's all that extra
vertical space to use, after all.

&gt; No - so no one will be squeezed by very obese person [sic] - unless the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; you *can't* be as active.

&gt;Sure you can, unless you were at your absolute limit of physical
&gt;capacity back then.
&gt;Most people never get anywhere near that limit in
&gt;their youth, or at any other time.

"/> Runners are not most people, runners are at or near the limits of
thier ability already. When they age they draw on the extra
muscle and bone strength they have built up to sustain them for a
while, then they slow, there is no reserve margin that can
suddenly be brought into play that they had overlooked before.
The idea is laughable.

People who have not trained hard when young will find any &quot;unused
margin&quot; impossible to utilise starting late in life, (even good
athletes find it almost impossible to get back after a break late
in life). They too will decline with age, however hard they try
later in life.

When I was younger I could maintain 6 minute miles for about 10
miles and 8 minute miles for the 26 miles. Now 10 minute miles
seem fast. Its a fact of life i'm afraid.

The same applies to mountaineering or whatever other demanding
physical activity you do.

&gt;&gt;I'm far from convinced about &quot;the wall&quot;, I have never experienced

&gt;&gt;occur when you are not sufficiently trained and your muscles can
&gt;&gt;no longer cope with things like lactic acid build up, rather than
&gt;&gt;being about lack of fuel?

&gt;I've experienced it. Do you eat a lot of glucose gel when
&gt;you run? If so, you may be avoiding it. I think it's
&gt;related to severely low blood glucose levels and the
&gt;resulting brain chemistry deficiencies.

3. You claim things to be fact that nobody else agrees are fact.

4. The more people who participate in the discussion, the greater the

5. The larger the group of people disagreeing with you, therefore, the

&gt;although, it was the first time I got bruises.

"/>  Okay. Set the way-back machine to August, 1995.
Yours truly has spent a few months exchanging hot-n-horny emails
with one of many &quot;email supporters&quot; who wishes in-person speaks. One
has also recently attended his very firstest soc.singles powwow in
Denver graciously hosted by the local FAQKeeper and as a result of
that and much business travel has accumulated enough FFMiles to choke
a size38^H^H^H^H^H^H major hippopotamus. One fateful evening a
long-distance phone call from said (inebriated) supporter and (even
more inebriated) friend making invites for a very long distance visit
is received.
ObSteadfastPersonalRule: When two drunken girlies with lovely
furrin accents phone up with invites to stay over for a few weeks, one
cashes in the FFMiles without hesitation.
So I find myself en route to Heathrow via BA from PHL and thinking
&quot;okay - have a nap to cover the jet lag and I'll be all sortsa party
perky when I arrive&quot; after abouts 7 hours of flying time.
Or so I thought.
I'm in the middle of the three-seat row, portside 747. Simply
adorable sweetie East-End cutie to my left at the window - and the
Eeevil Skinny Smarmy BritMale to my right in the aisle.
ObLongStoryShort: Guy falls asleep. I'm relieved, and so is the
girlie next to me who graciously suffered being chatted-up across my
lap for 20 minutes. I wink at girlie and let eyes slip shut for naps.
But *NOOOO*.
Guy on right falls asleep first and is apparently having some
dreamworld fantasy about flying using his legs as wings and begins
flapping his shanks, repeatedly smacking his left knee into my right
thigh. This of course summons me to wakedness and also amuses the
portside female who's (understandably) unable to resist giggling but
manages a polite and sympathetic squeeze to me left bicep. I call
stewardess for spare pillow to make buffer. As soon as she arrives
w/pillow and positions it, starboard side annoyance actually starts
snoring - really *loud*. This makes portside girlie guffaw and bury
he forehead into my shoulder. Stewardess is somewhat chagrined, so I
solve her problem for her and do my best to politely shake local
annoyance to mild wakefulness.
But the problem not only failed to wake, but promptly snorted and
launched a large and subconscious booger onto his own lap.
Stewardess is appalled. Portside girlie is practically having
orgams of laughter. I'm realizing that my chances of doing an evening
pub-crawl on my first non-business trip to London are rapidly
dwindling away unless I wake this idiot, but the thought of having to
deal with conversation with said prat makes the matter of
&quot;accidentally&quot; spilling an ice-filled drink into his lap something of
a mixed-blessing idea.
Y'all woulda been proud of me. I practiced a level of restraint
that likely remains unheard of in the annals of American touristry.
But I was a disappointedly sleepy sumbitch at primetime 8pm GMT and
didna make much of a showing and ended up snoozing away on an early
departure via comfy Vauxhall passenger seat on long drive &quot;home&quot; to
Ipswitch.
Some &quot;party guy&quot; I turned up to be, huh?. I did make up for it by
ponying-up for booze and dinner for my hostess and some several
uk.singles regs later on that first week, but the first nite set a
pace that I just didna seem to recover from.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be fair for me to demand that the airlines accomodate me by providing a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; half-size seat at half the price?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't understand your example.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, try this one. You and I go to a fine restaurant. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; order one plate of food. You order two. Should I be
&gt;&gt;&gt; required to pay as much money as you?

&gt;&gt;It depends on what we ordered. If I order franks and beans and you order
&gt;&gt;lobster, you pay more. I don't think your second example clears up your
&gt;&gt;first one at all.

&gt; Don't be obtuse. You can fairly read into the query
&gt; identical foods, just twice the amount.

&gt; Now answer the question.

"/> The obvious answer is no, but this has nothing to do with the problem,
since I never claimed the person who required extra space couldn't or
shouldn't be charged for it. If a person is so big that he actually
requires two seats, then he should pay for two seets. Most fat people
don't require two seats. They should pay for the space they use, not
some multiple of the quanta the airlines have established as standard.

And, if you choose a window or middle seat, you have to pay me to get by
me. I always take an aisle seat. If you want me to get up so you can get
out, you owe me a dollar. If you want to step over me, you owe me two
dollars. If the flight attendent blocks my airspace with the drinks
cart, the airline owes me 10 dollars per minute. If you turn on your
reading light while I'm trying to sleep, you owe me one dollar per
minute. I will not be disturbed when I have paid for my space.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently, the standard seat size does not take fat people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;into account. That is discrimination.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A ludicrous assertion. The airline is not denying service to anyone -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they're merely insisting that fat people pay their fair share of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; freight bill.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A ludicrous assertion. The airline discriminates on the basis of size by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;requiring fat people to buy two seats.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Not all discrimination is bad. The word itself refers to a
&gt;&gt;&gt; neutral differentiation process. Discrimination becomes bad
&gt;&gt;&gt; when it is based on factors that do not have practical
&gt;&gt;&gt; relevance or whose relevance is limited to perpetuating
&gt;&gt;&gt; undesirable social policy.

&gt;&gt;As long as the airline charges a reasonable fee for the extra space,
&gt;&gt;rather than two full fares, then it is fair. But remember that the only
&gt;&gt;reason there is a problem in the first place is because the seat size
&gt;&gt;was set by designers who decided that fat people don't deserve a proper
&gt;&gt;seat on an airplane. They could have designed bench seats. Why didn't
&gt;&gt;they use bench seats? Safety cannot possibly be the reason, soince if
&gt;&gt;the airplane crashes, you're dead anyway. Bench seats would have solved
&gt;&gt;the whole problem.

&gt; They are bench seats, mainly. They just have armrests in
&gt; places you don't agree with.

"/> They aren't bench seeats. A bench seat is a bench, one piece to sit on,
one back rest. No armrests are needed. If you want to pay extra for an
armrest, that's your prerogative. The flight attendant can rent an
armrest to you. If it intrudes into my space, you owe me 10 dollars.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Telling a fat person she can't be hired because she's fat
&gt;&gt;&gt; for a job that has no relevant physical requirements is one
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Telling a fat person she must pay for the space she occupies
&gt;&gt;&gt; on an airplane is another.

&gt;&gt;Fine, then charge extra for people with coughs and runny noses. Charge
&gt;&gt;extra for people who ate garlic the night before. Charge extra for
&gt;&gt;people who take the shoes off or didn't use deoderant. Charge extra for
&gt;&gt;people who play their walkman so everyone else can hear it. Charge extra
&gt;&gt;for crying children. Charge extra for every ounce of luggage. Charge
&gt;&gt;extra for using the toilet. Charge extra for meals.

&gt; These people aren't taking up extra space, are they?

"/> No, but they are consuming other resources that are just as important to
me as space. More important, actually, as I can cope with sitting next
to a fat person. I cannot cope with your smelly feet, stale garlic, and
rap &quot;music&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; The point mikey's trying to get through your head can be
&gt;&gt;&gt; restated another way.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Airlines have finite interior space. The number of seats
&gt;&gt;&gt; they can sell is dependent on the size of the space and the
&gt;&gt;&gt; size of the seats. They have to generate as much revenue
&gt;&gt;&gt; per seat as they can to be profitable. If they reduce the
&gt;&gt;&gt; number of seats by 40% to accomodate fat people, you should
&gt;&gt;&gt; expect the costs of the seats to go up 40%. Correct?

&gt;&gt;No. I didn't say they should reduce the number of seats by 40%, and it
&gt;&gt;wouldn't cause a 40% rise anyway. There would be a lot less weight, so
&gt;&gt;the fuel cost would drop significantly. There would be 40% fewer meals,
&gt;&gt;so the cost of that service would drop significantly. And fewer cabin
&gt;&gt;staff would be needed, so the personnel cost would drop significantly.
&gt;&gt;The cost of a ticket might not have to be raised much at all, and we
&gt;&gt;would all be more comfortable.

&gt; Have you sold any of the major carriers on your fascinating
&gt; economic proposal?

"/> Most of them seem to be moving toward smaller airplanes and/or one
class, so I'm winning.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Why should a person who can fit into one of the current
&gt;&gt;&gt; seats subsidize a larger seat for someone who needs it?

&gt;&gt;For the same reason collectivism is used everywhere else. Because
&gt;&gt;everyone is better off when it works.

&gt; No. Everyone is better off when they pay their own freight,
&gt; if they can.

"/> The key phrase being &quot;if they can.&quot; That's why collectivism is often a
better way to organize systems. Level of service is sometimes more
important than profit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is that fair to the smaller person?

&gt;&gt;Because he doesn't have to complain about fat people anymore.

&gt; That has nothing to do with economic fairness.

"/> Who made economic fairness the standard? It isn't the standard.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But actually, I think bench seats with open seating would be the optimal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solution.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What - so that more people are squeezed by very obese person?

&gt;&gt;&gt; No - so no one will be squeezed by very obese person [sic] - unless the
&gt;&gt;&gt; flight was fully booked, in which case there would be no difference from
&gt;&gt;&gt; the current situation.

&gt;&gt; I would categorically not go on any flight longer than about an hour on an
&gt;&gt; airline with bench seating. That would definitely be the end of it for me.
&gt;&gt; There are few things I like less than having a stranger squeezed up against
&gt;&gt; me for long periods of time. I doubt I am alone in that. The armrest is my
&gt;&gt; salvation.

&gt;The armrest is your salvation? But with bench seating, you would be able
&gt;to rent armrests from the flight attendant. Why should we mature humans
&gt;have to subsidize your childish fear of strangers and pay for your silly
&gt;armrests?

"/> The armrest rests arms, contains utilities, and, yes, does grant some separation
between pax and defines their spaces, including under-seat stowage space.

I don't care not to have them either. I don't care to be smooshed directly
against anyone for long hours, I dont' care to have my under-seat stowage
scooted down 5 feet from me. I don't care have my child smooshed into an even
smaller space between larger people just because they can. These things would
greatly decrease my comfort and would impact my and others' ability to fly.
Even subway cars and busses have some separate seating, at least by molded
indentation.

The *only* advantage of the bench seat idea is to accomodate the obese
passengers who dont' want to take responsibility for their own situations by
buying the seat space they need. At great disadvantage to others and to safety
in general.

The airline seat issue is but one of myriad problems an obese person encounters
due to their particular condition. Their practical choices are to either set up
their lives according to their situation, or to address their situation directly
by reversing their condition.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be fair for me to demand that the airlines accomodate me by providing a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; half-size seat at half the price?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't understand your example.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, try this one. You and I go to a fine restaurant. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; order one plate of food. You order two. Should I be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; required to pay as much money as you?
&gt;&gt;&gt;It depends on what we ordered. If I order franks and beans and you order
&gt;&gt;&gt;lobster, you pay more. I don't think your second example clears up your
&gt;&gt;&gt;first one at all.
&gt;&gt; Don't be obtuse. You can fairly read into the query
&gt;&gt; identical foods, just twice the amount.
&gt;&gt; Now answer the question.
&gt;The obvious answer is no, but this has nothing to do with the problem,
&gt;since I never claimed the person who required extra space couldn't or
&gt;shouldn't be charged for it. If a person is so big that he actually
&gt;requires two seats, then he should pay for two seets. Most fat people
&gt;don't require two seats. They should pay for the space they use, not
&gt;some multiple of the quanta the airlines have established as standard.

"/> If you go to a restaurant that sells you food by weight, you
get to pay for what you actually consume. If you go to a
restaurant that sells foods by plates or portions, you buy
the plate or portion. An airline sells seats by portions.
If you don't like the portion size, choose another airline
or a different class.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And, if you choose a window or middle seat, you have to pay me to get by
&gt;me. I always take an aisle seat. If you want me to get up so you can get
&gt;out, you owe me a dollar. If you want to step over me, you owe me two
&gt;dollars. If the flight attendent blocks my airspace with the drinks
&gt;cart, the airline owes me 10 dollars per minute. If you turn on your
&gt;reading light while I'm trying to sleep, you owe me one dollar per
&gt;minute. I will not be disturbed when I have paid for my space.

"/> Can you acknowledge that there is a difference between an
occasional disturbance and having your space violated the
whole flight by a person whose body is pressing against
yours?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently, the standard seat size does not take fat people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;into account. That is discrimination.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A ludicrous assertion. The airline is not denying service to anyone -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they're merely insisting that fat people pay their fair share of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; freight bill.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A ludicrous assertion. The airline discriminates on the basis of size by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;requiring fat people to buy two seats.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not all discrimination is bad. The word itself refers to a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; neutral differentiation process. Discrimination becomes bad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when it is based on factors that do not have practical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; relevance or whose relevance is limited to perpetuating
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; undesirable social policy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;As long as the airline charges a reasonable fee for the extra space,
&gt;&gt;&gt;rather than two full fares, then it is fair. But remember that the only
&gt;&gt;&gt;reason there is a problem in the first place is because the seat size
&gt;&gt;&gt;was set by designers who decided that fat people don't deserve a proper
&gt;&gt;&gt;seat on an airplane. They could have designed bench seats. Why didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;they use bench seats? Safety cannot possibly be the reason, soince if
&gt;&gt;&gt;the airplane crashes, you're dead anyway. Bench seats would have solved
&gt;&gt;&gt;the whole problem.

"/> The airline cannot, consistent with safety requirements
(ncluding the fixing of seat belts) sell its space on bench
seats. It must have individual seats. There are several
instances of seat belts on airlines saving lives -- not in a
crash from flight altitude, but in takeoff and landing
incidents.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; They are bench seats, mainly. They just have armrests in
&gt;&gt; places you don't agree with.
&gt;They aren't bench seeats. A bench seat is a bench, one piece to sit on,
&gt;one back rest. No armrests are needed. If you want to pay extra for an
&gt;armrest, that's your prerogative. The flight attendant can rent an
&gt;armrest to you. If it intrudes into my space, you owe me 10 dollars.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Telling a fat person she can't be hired because she's fat

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Telling a fat person she must pay for the space she occupies
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on an airplane is another.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Fine, then charge extra for people with coughs and runny noses. Charge

&gt;&gt;&gt;people who take the shoes off or didn't use deoderant. Charge extra for

&gt;&gt;&gt;for crying children. Charge extra for every ounce of luggage. Charge
&gt;&gt;&gt;extra for using the toilet. Charge extra for meals.
&gt;&gt; These people aren't taking up extra space, are they?
&gt;No, but they are consuming other resources that are just as important to
&gt;me as space. More important, actually, as I can cope with sitting next
&gt;to a fat person. I cannot cope with your smelly feet, stale garlic, and
&gt;rap &quot;music&quot;.

"/> Whether those resources are important to you is irrelevant.
You don't get to market or price the airline's resources.
The airline does.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The point mikey's trying to get through your head can be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; restated another way.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Airlines have finite interior space. The number of seats
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they can sell is dependent on the size of the space and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; size of the seats. They have to generate as much revenue
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; per seat as they can to be profitable. If they reduce the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; number of seats by 40% to accomodate fat people, you should
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expect the costs of the seats to go up 40%. Correct?
&gt;&gt;&gt;No. I didn't say they should reduce the number of seats by 40%, and it
&gt;&gt;&gt;wouldn't cause a 40% rise anyway. There would be a lot less weight, so
&gt;&gt;&gt;the fuel cost would drop significantly. There would be 40% fewer meals,
&gt;&gt;&gt;so the cost of that service would drop significantly. And fewer cabin
&gt;&gt;&gt;staff would be needed, so the personnel cost would drop significantly.
&gt;&gt;&gt;The cost of a ticket might not have to be raised much at all, and we
&gt;&gt;&gt;would all be more comfortable.
&gt;&gt; Have you sold any of the major carriers on your fascinating
&gt;&gt; economic proposal?
&gt;Most of them seem to be moving toward smaller airplanes and/or one
&gt;class, so I'm winning.

"/> Sure you are.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why should a person who can fit into one of the current
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seats subsidize a larger seat for someone who needs it?
&gt;&gt;&gt;For the same reason collectivism is used everywhere else. Because
&gt;&gt;&gt;everyone is better off when it works.
&gt;&gt; No. Everyone is better off when they pay their own freight,
&gt;&gt; if they can.
&gt;The key phrase being &quot;if they can.&quot; That's why collectivism is often a
&gt;better way to organize systems. Level of service is sometimes more
&gt;important than profit.

"/> Level of service is probably enhanced when carriers are
competing for travel dollars.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is that fair to the smaller person?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Because he doesn't have to complain about fat people anymore.
&gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with economic fairness.
&gt;Who made economic fairness the standard? It isn't the standard.

"/> It is from where I'm sitting. In my own seat, with the
armrests down.

chance in this personal-space-aware society that armrest-less planes would
ever fly.

The armrest makes the difference between having to fight for my personal
space versus having it defined for me. Having no armrests is like going to a
buffet restaurant where they put out enough food for about 3/4 of the people

scooter' out, and they can't always *use* the 'damn scooter'.

I'd warn against passing judgement against every person you see using a handicap
spot - yeah, there's a lot of real abuse, but that can't be easily separated
from someone you might see with a circulatory or respiratory problem. On the
other hand, you can't say the poor old blue-hair isn't just fine with walking a
bit, and didn't do a 2 mile walking trek that morning as in every morning.

&gt; 9.1 Does PCOS cause obesity, or does obesity cause PCOS?

&gt;In some ways, this question is akin to asking, &quot;Which came first, the
&gt;chicken or the egg?&quot; since it isn't completely understood, but it appears
&gt;more likely that PCOS comes first. Symptoms of PCOS may be lessened by
&gt;weight loss, or increased by weight gain, but the syndrome is not caused by
&gt;weight or body mass. There are lean women with PCOS. The insulin resistance
&gt;that is common to PCOS may play a role in weight gain and the difficulty in
&gt;losing any extra weight.

"/> - From the link you have provided:

9.2 Is it possible to be lean and have PCOS?

About half of women with PCOS are overweight, which means that the other
half is not.
**
Given that the latest and greatest government figures show that 65% of the
population is overweight or better, it would appear that women who have
PCOS are leaner, on average, than the general population.

Try again, monkeyboy.

&gt;&gt; The point mikey's trying to get through your head can be

&gt;&gt; Airlines have finite interior space. The number of seats
&gt;&gt; they can sell is dependent on the size of the space and the
&gt;&gt; size of the seats. They have to generate as much revenue
&gt;&gt; per seat as they can to be profitable. If they reduce the
&gt;&gt; number of seats by 40% to accomodate fat people, you should
&gt;&gt; expect the costs of the seats to go up 40%. Correct?

&gt; No. I didn't say they should reduce the number of seats by 40%, and it
&gt; wouldn't cause a 40% rise anyway. There would be a lot less weight, so
&gt; the fuel cost would drop significantly. There would be 40% fewer meals,
&gt; so the cost of that service would drop significantly. And fewer cabin
&gt; staff would be needed, so the personnel cost would drop significantly.
&gt; The cost of a ticket might not have to be raised much at all, and we
&gt; would all be more comfortable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But let's invert this for a bit. Let's say that 340# is a &quot;normal&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weight for a 5'10&quot; human. As a person that weighs half that, would it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be fair for me to demand that the airlines accomodate me by providing a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; half-size seat at half the price?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't understand your example.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, try this one. You and I go to a fine restaurant. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; order one plate of food. You order two. Should I be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; required to pay as much money as you?

&gt;&gt;&gt;It depends on what we ordered. If I order franks and beans and you order
&gt;&gt;&gt;lobster, you pay more. I don't think your second example clears up your
&gt;&gt;&gt;first one at all.

&gt;&gt; Don't be obtuse. You can fairly read into the query
&gt;&gt; identical foods, just twice the amount.

&gt;&gt; Now answer the question.

&gt; The obvious answer is no, but this has nothing to do with the problem,
&gt; since I never claimed the person who required extra space couldn't or
&gt; shouldn't be charged for it. If a person is so big that he actually
&gt; requires two seats, then he should pay for two seets. Most fat people
&gt; don't require two seats. They should pay for the space they use, not
&gt; some multiple of the quanta the airlines have established as standard.

&gt; And, if you choose a window or middle seat, you have to pay me to get by
&gt; me. I always take an aisle seat. If you want me to get up so you can get
&gt; out, you owe me a dollar. If you want to step over me, you owe me two
&gt; dollars. If the flight attendent blocks my airspace with the drinks
&gt; cart, the airline owes me 10 dollars per minute. If you turn on your
&gt; reading light while I'm trying to sleep, you owe me one dollar per
&gt; minute. I will not be disturbed when I have paid for my space.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently, the standard seat size does not take fat people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;into account. That is discrimination.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A ludicrous assertion. The airline is not denying service to anyone -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they're merely insisting that fat people pay their fair share of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; freight bill.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A ludicrous assertion. The airline discriminates on the basis of size by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;requiring fat people to buy two seats.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not all discrimination is bad. The word itself refers to a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; neutral differentiation process. Discrimination becomes bad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when it is based on factors that do not have practical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; relevance or whose relevance is limited to perpetuating
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; undesirable social policy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;As long as the airline charges a reasonable fee for the extra space,
&gt;&gt;&gt;rather than two full fares, then it is fair. But remember that the only
&gt;&gt;&gt;reason there is a problem in the first place is because the seat size
&gt;&gt;&gt;was set by designers who decided that fat people don't deserve a proper
&gt;&gt;&gt;seat on an airplane. They could have designed bench seats. Why didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;they use bench seats? Safety cannot possibly be the reason, soince if
&gt;&gt;&gt;the airplane crashes, you're dead anyway. Bench seats would have solved
&gt;&gt;&gt;the whole problem.

&gt;&gt; They are bench seats, mainly. They just have armrests in
&gt;&gt; places you don't agree with.

&gt; They aren't bench seeats. A bench seat is a bench, one piece to sit on,
&gt; one back rest. No armrests are needed. If you want to pay extra for an
&gt; armrest, that's your prerogative. The flight attendant can rent an
&gt; armrest to you. If it intrudes into my space, you owe me 10 dollars.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Telling a fat person she can't be hired because she's fat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for a job that has no relevant physical requirements is one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Telling a fat person she must pay for the space she occupies
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on an airplane is another.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Fine, then charge extra for people with coughs and runny noses. Charge
&gt;&gt;&gt;extra for people who ate garlic the night before. Charge extra for
&gt;&gt;&gt;people who take the shoes off or didn't use deoderant. Charge extra for
&gt;&gt;&gt;people who play their walkman so everyone else can hear it. Charge extra
&gt;&gt;&gt;for crying children. Charge extra for every ounce of luggage. Charge
&gt;&gt;&gt;extra for using the toilet. Charge extra for meals.

&gt;&gt; These people aren't taking up extra space, are they?

&gt; No, but they are consuming other resources that are just as important to
&gt; me as space. More important, actually, as I can cope with sitting next
&gt; to a fat person. I cannot cope with your smelly feet, stale garlic, and
&gt; rap &quot;music&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The point mikey's trying to get through your head can be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; restated another way.

&gt;&gt; Have you sold any of the major carriers on your fascinating

&gt; Most of them seem to be moving toward smaller airplanes and/or one
&gt; class, so I'm winning.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why should a person who can fit into one of the current
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seats subsidize a larger seat for someone who needs it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;For the same reason collectivism is used everywhere else. Because
&gt;&gt;&gt;everyone is better off when it works.

&gt;&gt; No. Everyone is better off when they pay their own freight,
&gt;&gt; if they can.

&gt; The key phrase being &quot;if they can.&quot; That's why collectivism is often a
&gt; better way to organize systems. Level of service is sometimes more
&gt; important than profit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is that fair to the smaller person?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Because he doesn't have to complain about fat people anymore.

&gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with economic fairness.

&gt; Who made economic fairness the standard? It isn't the standard.

"/> Hey retard...

Economics RULES any business endeavor.

&gt; for the extra space he/she uses, and he/she won't violate your space.

"/> With some experience in &quot;bench seats&quot; of a sort, the metaframed canvas ones
mounted along the outer skin of an a/c which used the floor in the middle
upon which to stack the sinews and detritus of war, I'm comfortable that
you know not of what you speak (and would not like to expereience that
which you advocate).

Having test-marketed such seating on a Transatlantic flight, the long way
around as it were via touristic Newfoundland, Sunny Eesland, Bonny
Prestwick and on to RheinMain, I am willing to testify before any board,
committee, or court of inquiry that the poor human ass is not designed to
be so mistreatedm even for a modest span of time.

Besides, like the spitting and whittling benches which used to adorn the
local courthouse's facade, a good bench, like a cask for fine wine or a keg
to house drinkable whisky, must be made of oak, White or Limousin, a
material so heavy that it would cut passenger loads in half and cause
skinny folks' ticket prices to double.

As for fat people, all we need are aone of those frames like those used to
measure carry on luggage. They either fit or don't fit (or become stuck in
transit). To big to fit the seats, they go in the aft baggage hold (a la
SAAB 340), secured with cargo nets and sturdy tiedowns. Obviously,
bulkheads will need to be strengthened to prevent potential entry to the
main cabin during rapid deceleration, and ground crews will have to be
equipped with heavy duty adjustable tail props adaptable to all a/c in
service, but these alternatives far outweigh destruction of much of the
world's remaining oak forest and the removal of many ornamental trees from
suburban US neighborhoods, cutting the remaining Limousins in the
Limousin, damaging future harvests of Limousines, thus putting dozens of
funeral homes and car hire companies out of business.

Before you know it, Freddy Laker will have introduced shoddy plywood bench
seats, Ryanair and Easyjet will have altogether dispensed with seats in
&quot;More Fun on the Floor/Diddle on the Deck&quot; service to selected Continental
cities, and Fedex will become the industry leader selling tickets by the
pound (with a premium for travel in freight containers with relief tubes
and big funnels for fat fannies).

&gt;&gt; Other than improving EFFICIENCY through better methods or capital
&gt;&gt; investment, please explain how, in general a company can increase it's
&gt;&gt; level of service
&gt;&gt; without ALSO increasing it's operating expenses.

&gt; Normally we say improve not increase. In this case, we improve the level
&gt; of service by using bench seats with seatbelts mounted on tracks. Then
&gt; people can be seated according to size, two, three, or even four to a
&gt; row, without causing any discomfort, and then passengers can be charged
&gt; fairly for the space they occupy, and if you want an armrest, you can
&gt; request one, or two, and pay for them, of course.

&gt;&gt; Please note that subsidies from governments, grants from charitable

&gt; No, they don't. If your company is supposed to make a profit, then you
&gt; have to earn more than you spend while still improving levels of
&gt; service. Public systems are not required to make a profit. They are
&gt; required to provide very high levels of service, while always trying to

It doesn't matter if the money comes from passenger fares, or subsidies.

&gt; This recently happened to my sister. The large person proceeded to

been

&gt; was given a free ticket by the airline.

"/> My wife flies aleast once a month for business. She is a very large
woman and her company always purchases two seats for her. She carries
her own seatbelt extender and preboards whenever possible. But why is
it that the ass in front of her always insists on reclining his or her
seat. So that the seat is on my wifes chest. Nobody wants some
asshole's greasy bald head or some womans hairspray choked quaff in
their face. Most of the time when she politely asks these inconsiderate
clowns to raise their seat, they usually give her a dirty look or
outright refuse. One miserable turd actually had the nerve to say &quot;If

don't you think that these assholes should be forced to reimburse my
wife, or her company for their intrusion on her space? Or to your way

So exactly where does this end? Purchasing an airline ticket buys you
transportation from point A to point B and to cover the cost of fuel,
insurance and maintenance. It does not entitile you to armrests, food
or personal safe zones. These are merely courtesies extended to you by
the airlines. Seating assignments are there to facilitate boarding
only. Because without them most of you sheep would rush the jetway and
trample each other as you try to board. The only reason airlines are
trying to force people of size to purchase two tickets is to cutoff any
litigation brought against them by whiny passengers. Most airlines
already had regulations regarding larger passengers and never had to
inforce them. But because of a rash of lawsuits brought against them by
self-centered people who feel their personal space is more important
than the persons next to them they are now forced to implement them. We
have all heard these ridiculous stories about these idiots claiming
injuries from someones fat arm rest on them. Please people airfares are
high enough without us having to also pay for your nonsense.

So in conclusion people when you think the large person next to you is
intruding on you, well maybe you are intruding on them. So suck it up
and find something meaningful in life to complain about. Because
believe me if the airlines could get away with making the seats smaller
they would and then we would all be fucked.

&gt; or personal safe zones. These are merely courtesies extended to you by
&gt; the airlines. Seating assignments are there to facilitate boarding
&gt; only. Because without them most of you sheep would rush the jetway and
&gt; trample each other as you try to board. The only reason airlines are
&gt; trying to force people of size to purchase two tickets is to cutoff any
&gt; litigation brought against them by whiny passengers. Most airlines
&gt; already had regulations regarding larger passengers and never had to
&gt; inforce them. But because of a rash of lawsuits brought against them by
&gt; self-centered people who feel their personal space is more important
&gt; than the persons next to them they are now forced to implement them.

be reclined, they would be fixed in the upright position.

get domestic complimentary upgrades and I can use miles to upgrade

Am I allowed to use Knee Defenders™ on commercial aircraft?

The FAA has indicated that Knee Defenders™ may be used on commercial
aircraft. As reported in the Washington Post, &quot;FAA spokesman Paul
Takemoto said the clips were not against federal aviation rules as long
as they weren't used during taxiing, takeoffs or landings.&quot; Of course,
Knee Defenders are designed to be used with your tray table lowered, and
your tray table must be up and locked &quot;during taxiing, takeoffs or
landings.&quot;

Also according to press reports, Northwest Airlines objected to an
earlier design of Knee Defender™ - when Knee Defender™ was offered as a
single unit, while it is now sold and used in pairs.

Additionally, an article in the Observer of London (UK) quoted a British
Airways spokeswoman as saying that, while BA does not recommend the
product, &quot;It's up to the passenger.&quot;

While some have said that seats are &quot;meant to recline&quot;, it cannot be
reasonably expected that reclining can be done under any circumstances –
even when a person or property will be damaged as a result.

After all, if the choice is between a reclining seatback banging into
your knees, breaking your computer screen, or smacking your infant in
the head as you hold her on your lap, on the one hand, or hitting some
plastic in the form of Knee Defenders, on the other hand, both you and
the airlines should prefer that the seatback hit the Knee Defenders™.
Seen this way, Knee Defenders™ actually enhance the operation of airline
seats by offering improved protection against their causing harm when
used inappropriately.

You've missed what Mike's FA was actually saying. He was saying &quot;All
I have to do is tell someone to remoove them and they have to do it
because *I* say so.&quot; It's not a question of what's allowed under the
rules anymore. Since September 11th little to no pretext is necessary
anymore for a FA or any other member of the crew to do what they want
to. Mike's FA was flaunting his power to get people in trouble with
the feds if they don't obey his every command. Hopefully most FAs are
more ethical in their everyday dealings.

Take care,
Carmen

charge ticket prices based on the weight of each passenger. Two

greater than 2,000 miles would pay a little more per pound.

When are these self-centered whiners going to be willing to take
responsibility for themselves instead of boo-hooing about the truth?

The person in front of her paid full price for his seat, which includes a
reclining seat back for his comfort. It is your overweight sister who is
causing the inconvenience to the regular passenger, not visa versa. While I
empathize with her (I've been fat myself), I don't sympathize with her.
It's up to her to take control of her own life and make travel arrangements
that will accomodate her life choices rather than expect others to alter
their personal space to suit her.

If anyone is that concerned about their baby being whacked on the head or

are designed to recline -- let them buy an extra seat fo their kid or their
computer. Or take the freaking train. Rude, ignorant people who fail to

of

seat

"/> Most airlines have these seats - they cost a little more but anyone can
pay the little extra and get the increased comfort they afford.

As far as the recline is concerned - you can recline your seat just as
easily as the person in front of you with few exceptions. Given this
capability, it is appropriate to assume that the space into which a
seat reclines is space belonging to that seat and the person who is
sitting in it, not the the seat and person behind. This is consistent
with the underseat storage - the space under the seat is blocked to the
forward making the space under the seat a space belonging to the person
seated behind. If the airline had a different idea in mind they would
not have allowed seats to recline or put bars to the forward of the
foot space.

What should I do if a flight attendant tells me not to use Knee Defenders?

While Knee Defenders™ have been designed to help you protect your safety, if a
flight attendant instructs you to stop using Knee Defenders™ – even if you
believe that these instructions are unreasonable – you must always follow the
flight attendant's instructions. Hopefully, airlines will devise and deploy
their own systems to protect you from reclining seats.

*********ENDQUOTE

On most of the cross country flights that I have been
on the reclining position only adds four or five inches
to the recliner's space and subtracts a similar amount
from the person behind them. This whole argument is a
tempest in a teapot. If the four or five inches make
that much of a difference then the person should be
springing for the more expensive first class seats.

It is not fair to expect the person in front of you not
to recline the seat when the person in front of them is
reclining their seat.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Am I allowed to use Knee Defenders™ on commercial aircraft?

&gt;The FAA has indicated that Knee Defenders™ may be used on commercial
&gt;aircraft.

"/> With the consent of the flight crew which may
not be forthcoming...

Crash Street Kidd

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As reported in the Washington Post, &quot;FAA spokesman Paul
&gt;Takemoto said the clips were not against federal aviation rules as long
&gt;as they weren't used during taxiing, takeoffs or landings.&quot; Of course,
&gt;Knee Defenders are designed to be used with your tray table lowered, and
&gt;your tray table must be up and locked &quot;during taxiing, takeoffs or
&gt;landings.&quot;

&gt;Also according to press reports, Northwest Airlines objected to an
&gt;earlier design of Knee Defender™ - when Knee Defender™ was offered as a
&gt;single unit, while it is now sold and used in pairs.

&gt;Additionally, an article in the Observer of London (UK) quoted a British
&gt;Airways spokeswoman as saying that, while BA does not recommend the
&gt;product, &quot;It's up to the passenger.&quot;

&gt;While some have said that seats are &quot;meant to recline&quot;, it cannot be
&gt;reasonably expected that reclining can be done under any circumstances –
&gt;even when a person or property will be damaged as a result.

&gt;After all, if the choice is between a reclining seatback banging into
&gt;your knees, breaking your computer screen, or smacking your infant in
&gt;the head as you hold her on your lap, on the one hand, or hitting some
&gt;plastic in the form of Knee Defenders, on the other hand, both you and
&gt;the airlines should prefer that the seatback hit the Knee Defenders™.
&gt;Seen this way, Knee Defenders™ actually enhance the operation of airline
&gt;seats by offering improved protection against their causing harm when
&gt;used inappropriately.

&gt; What should I do if a flight attendant tells me not to use Knee Defenders?

&gt; While Knee Defenders™ have been designed to help you protect your safety,
&gt; if a
&gt; flight attendant instructs you to stop using Knee Defenders™ – even if you
&gt; believe that these instructions are unreasonable – you must always follow
&gt; the
&gt; flight attendant's instructions. Hopefully, airlines will devise and
&gt; deploy
&gt; their own systems to protect you from reclining seats.

&gt; *********ENDQUOTE

&gt; On most of the cross country flights that I have been
&gt; on the reclining position only adds four or five inches
&gt; to the recliner's space and subtracts a similar amount
&gt; from the person behind them. This whole argument is a
&gt; tempest in a teapot. If the four or five inches make
&gt; that much of a difference then the person should be
&gt; springing for the more expensive first class seats.

&gt; It is not fair to expect the person in front of you not
&gt; to recline the seat when the person in front of them is
&gt; reclining their seat.

&gt; Crash Street Kidd

&gt;&gt;http://www.kneedefender.com/html2/faqs/faq_using.htm
&gt;&gt;Am I allowed to use Knee Defenders™ on commercial aircraft?

&gt;&gt;The FAA has indicated that Knee Defenders™ may be used on commercial
&gt;&gt;aircraft.

&gt; With the consent of the flight crew which may
&gt; not be forthcoming...

&gt; Crash Street Kidd

&gt;&gt; As reported in the Washington Post, &quot;FAA spokesman Paul
&gt;&gt;Takemoto said the clips were not against federal aviation rules as long
&gt;&gt;as they weren't used during taxiing, takeoffs or landings.&quot; Of course,
&gt;&gt;Knee Defenders are designed to be used with your tray table lowered, and
&gt;&gt;your tray table must be up and locked &quot;during taxiing, takeoffs or
&gt;&gt;landings.&quot;

&gt;&gt;Also according to press reports, Northwest Airlines objected to an
&gt;&gt;earlier design of Knee Defender™ - when Knee Defender™ was offered as a
&gt;&gt;single unit, while it is now sold and used in pairs.

&gt;&gt;Additionally, an article in the Observer of London (UK) quoted a British
&gt;&gt;Airways spokeswoman as saying that, while BA does not recommend the
&gt;&gt;product, &quot;It's up to the passenger.&quot;

&gt;&gt;While some have said that seats are &quot;meant to recline&quot;, it cannot be
&gt;&gt;reasonably expected that reclining can be done under any circumstances –
&gt;&gt;even when a person or property will be damaged as a result.

&gt;&gt;After all, if the choice is between a reclining seatback banging into
&gt;&gt;your knees, breaking your computer screen, or smacking your infant in
&gt;&gt;the head as you hold her on your lap, on the one hand, or hitting some
&gt;&gt;plastic in the form of Knee Defenders, on the other hand, both you and
&gt;&gt;the airlines should prefer that the seatback hit the Knee Defenders™.
&gt;&gt;Seen this way, Knee Defenders™ actually enhance the operation of airline
&gt;&gt;seats by offering improved protection against their causing harm when
&gt;&gt;used inappropriately.

"/> What is in front of you there? A wall dividing the

more forward-space than the area at eye-level?

I have also experienced the issue of the person in
front of me leaning the seat back all the way,
practically into my face. But I wasn't sure if the
front seats facing a wall might restrict floor-level
space to stretch my feet.

Any problems with sitting there and ending up
unpleasantly close to the toilets?

On a consumer-issues level, perhaps very frequent
fliers might want to suggest that the airlines restrict
the seat-reclining angle. Like adjusting the recline
angle brackets/hardware so that it stops before some
passenger practically lays down in the lap of the
person behind them.

http://www.cswd.org/airseats.html
Few people are comfortable in airplane seats. They are smaller than the
seats in buses, trains, and all other forms of transportation. Only
children and probably the smallest quarter of the population actually
fit comfortably in airplane seating. Until recently, seat designers have
relied on a 1950 Harvard study of train passengers that said that the
average adult requires eighteen inches per seat. A study by the Society
of Automotive Engineers is underway to update that information.

Businesses such as movie theaters and sports arena builders have
acknowledged the fact that the population is getting larger. They know
their customers, and they are providing the service that will keep those
customers happy and make them want to come back. Why aren't the airlines
following the same basic principle of business and competing for the
consumer dollar?

People are different from packages

In recent Southwest statements, the airline has said that they must
charge more for the usage of more space, just as they do with freight.
The difference between people and packages is that people book passage,
whereas packages pay by weight or volume. Southwest Airlines is treating
people like packages.

People come in many sizes

There are substantial differences in human sizes, shapes, and weights.
Airline policy today does not permit children and smaller adults to pay
less. Taller individuals do not pay more. Football players are not asked
to purchase two seats. Pregnant women and mothers with infants do not
pay for two seats. People who are heavier than average are being singled
out by Southwest, and other airlines, to bear the extra costs, even
though other groups also require more than one seat. The reason for this
discrepancy is that heavy people do not fit into socially approved
categories. Airlines feel they can get away with discriminating against
such people, since there is already a lot of animosity against them.

Americans are getting heavier. Some people may not like that fact, but
it is a fact. More than 60% of the population is classified as
overweight, according to the National Institutes of Health. If the
airlines want to serve the majority of passengers, they should be making
their seats more comfortable.

Airlines are public accommodation

Air travel is a public accommodation, licensed to provide services for
the public good. As businesses, airlines have an obligation to turn a
profit. But as public services, airlines must serve their public by
making their seats fit most of the people. If they are not willing to do
that, then they must accommodate those who need extra room by providing
them with an extra seat or portion of a seat without charge. They
already do this for mothers with infants, football players, and people
with disabilities. Most airlines now deal with passengers with special
needs without charging them double. Few flights are 100% booked, so
ticket agents merely block off the seat next to a person who needs more
room for whatever reason.

Middle size people will be affected too

We are concerned not only for very large passengers, but for middle size
people who may now be forced to buy an extra ticket that they never
needed before. Right after Southwest's policy was announced there was a
story in the news about a man in California who had been flying
Southwest for years with no problem, fitting into one seat. After
Southwest's announcement, a ticket agent told him he must buy two seats.
This scenario will probably be repeated at Southwest ticket counters all
over the country.

This is false advertising

Southwest's policy is false advertising. When an airline sells a
passenger a ticket, they don't say $200 buys you 18 inches of seating to
Orlando. They don't say the fare is for a certain number of inches of
space, but for passage from one point to another. They advertise that a
coach fare costs so much. Now they are imposing a new limit on the fare
and saying that the fare doesn't apply to some passengers. That is false
advertising. The airlines must inform passengers beforehand of their
conditions for buying passage on their flights. Only then can a customer
decide whether or not they want to fly on that particular airline. It is
not fair to tell people of this requirement only after they have bought
the tickets and are standing at the gate.

Who will decide?

Southwest's policy is overly vague, and open to interpretation and
abuse. How will they decide who has to buy two seats? Will they have
scales or tape measures at the ticket counter? Will they have a model of
an airplane seat there and people will have to prove they fit into it?
Or will it be left to the ticket agent to estimate a person's weight?
What if the ticket agent is having a bad day and starts double-charging
people who would fit perfectly well into a single seat?

Two seats even on an empty flight

Southwest's new policy is overly strict. If they determine that you need
two seats, you have to buy two tickets no matter how empty the flight
is. You have to pay double even if you are the only passenger on that
flight. They say that you can apply for a refund afterwards if the
flight was not full, but they don't say what kind of hoops you will have
to jump through to get that refund. They are probably counting on people
being embarrassed and not even asking for the refund.

Frequent flyer miles not awarded for extra seats

We have had reports from passengers who bought two seats and then found
out that the airlines did not give them the frequent flyer miles for the
extra seat they paid for. Frequent flyer miles are supposed to be a
bonus and a discount for those who buy many tickets. It should apply to
extra seats.

Bad publicity and lawsuits

Southwest's new policy will backfire on them. It will create nothing but
ill will and bad publicity for the airline, and there will probably be
lawsuits. People who are larger than average, and their families, and
those who think this is unfair, will be taking their business elsewhere.
The Council is prepared to join in and help with any lawsuits arising
from this policy.

What the airlines should do

There are several things the airlines could do to remedy the situation.
If they took out one seat per row, and took out one row of seats, they
could add the extra inches to all the other seats for more width and
more legroom. This would help both wider and taller passengers. Yes,
it's true, they would have to increase the price of each ticket
slightly, but flying would be a much more pleasant experience, and
customers would accept the increase. As it is now, the seats are
designed for the smallest people, and so the larger passengers are being
asked to subsidize the smaller ones.

Airlines could also remedy this situation by installing a minimum number
of rows of larger or adaptable seating that could be used by those who
are larger than average, people with disabilities, or those with other
special needs. Since all passengers, including smaller people, would
probably prefer to sit in these wider seats, there would have to be
restrictions on who could buy those seats.

What consumers can do

We encourage people to write to the airlines, especially Southwest, and
complain about the size of airplane seats and of their new unfair and
unworkable policy.

"/> Incidently, responding to your off-topic article, I agree with it only to
the extent that Southwest is inconsistent in applying its policy. There is
no question in my mind, however, that if you take up two seats, you buy two
seats. It doesn't matter to me whether you are heavy, carrying a lapchild,
or have a medical condition that requires you to sit cross-legged. If you
can't fit in your seat, you have absolutely no entitlement to mine.

And, no, I don't blame the airlines for this.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Lose some weight or get over it.

&gt;&gt; It had nothing to do with weight - I was in a plane that had 0 extra room
&gt; so
&gt;&gt; when anyone sat in the seat (even someone 5'2&quot; and 90 lbs - their knees
&gt;&gt; would be right up to the seat in front of them and if anyone reclined -
&gt;&gt; their knees would get smacked too.

&gt; What airline was this? Perhaps some charters have seat pitch this tight,
&gt; but no commercial airline in the US does.

"/> Yes, it was a commercial airline in the US. Flown on 3 different airlines
since new years so can't correctly say which one it was. It was a puddle
jumper and it may have had something to do with the fact that I was one row
in front of the emergency exit. My seat did not recline and I believe my
row had a couple inches less room - not to mention it was already a smaller
aircraft.
