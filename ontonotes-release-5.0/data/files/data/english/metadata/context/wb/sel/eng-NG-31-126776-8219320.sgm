I'm determined to get this $10 internet for my wife at home. I read
about it on TechDirt several weeks ago, and thought &quot;Hey, wouldn't it
be nice?&quot; Of course, there's rarely a free lunch, and after surfing the
internet forums, I wondered if I actually signed up for it, if I'd be
the first - most people had problems getting to the right page and
getting the right page to pop up even when they got the right
URL.Always one to be a pioneer, and always willing to put the screws to
AT&amp;T, I've taken it upon myself to go through the arduous task of
making this possible. Hopefully I'll be able to pave the way for others
to do this for themselves in the future, as well as make my wife happy
with some cheap internet service at the house.All Timestamps are
PM.4:00: went to the link from the TechDirt article on DSL Reports,
went through the sign-up form. System informs me that I'm not qualified
for AT&amp;T DSL service in my location.4:14: Called customer service. On
hold for 20 minutes, and then hung up on when transferred.4:40: Called
different customer service line (800-869-1598), and was told that,
after 15 minutes on hold, that I could get DSL where I was, but they
would have to transfer me to the the right regional customer service.
As soon as I started speaking with the customer service guy about the
$10 deal, I mysteriously get transferred, and hung up on.5:20: Went
through the website again, and this time clicked on the live chat
thing. Spent about 20 minutes discussing things with her. Started out
by telling the CSR about my request for the $10 DSL (probably a
mistake), and mysteriously I'm told that it's not available again. She
offers me Satellite Internet at an exhorbitant rate. I graciously
decline. She refers me to a phone number to tell me exactly why DSL
isn't available for me (1-800-709-5465).6:00: Dicker around on the
internet, considering getting wireless internet through a mobile phone
provider.6:03: Look at the pricing plans, and decide this is a stupid
idea. Especially since I don't have a laptop.6:15: Dig up the number
chat lady gave me, and call it.6:19: They give me this number to call:
(877-722-3755). I call it. Talk to the lady about setting up standalone
DSL, and get a go-ahead. I then mention that I want the special $10
deal. She tells me it's a web-only offer. I mention my dilemma, and she
transfers me to the web-help people.7:02: Talked to Billy, presumably a
web help guy. Tell him the problem, but don't mention that it's the $10
deal specifically. He's bringing a specialist on the line, allegedly.
It sounds like he punted me to a different department. Probably DSL
sales again. I don't recognize the hold music as being from the same
department, so it may be someone else entirely.7:06: Realize how sad it
is that I'm learning to recognize their hold music. The maintenance men
just turned out the lights in the hallways. I realize how late it's
getting.7:10: This hold music sounds like it is playing off magnetic
tape, and it's been playing continuously since the 70s, when these
tunes were written. It speeds up and slows down randomly.7:12: I hear a
brief ring, and then back to hold music. Same songs.7:15: Talking to
Nick in the Retention Office. He tells me that the $10 deal is not a
standalone DSL deal. I must order phone service, even if it's the
ultra-cheap $10 phone service, to be able to get the $10 DSL. So now, I
begin my quest to find the most dirt cheap telephone service AT&amp;T
offers.7:32: I'm sitting at the pay screen, looking at the button to
pay for $7 a month local phone service. I'm pondering whether to trust
Nick at his word and go for it, or to just give it up. No! I've come to
far to give up! Plus, I'm going to use a credit card, so I can always
reverse the charges.7:42: The phone number it assigned me is the same
as what one of my buddies from middle school's phone number was. Odd
coincidence.7:45: Total cost so far: $50.00 (pre-paid). Actual charges:
$7.00 + $38.50, but they require a $50.00 prepayment, apparently.
Hooray for credit checks!7:47: Went back to the order DSL special page
from DSL Reports. Entered my new phone number, and got this error
message:Due to technical problems, we are unable to process your order
online at this time. Please contact us at 1-877-722-3755 Mon-Fri,
7am-9pm; Sat 8am-5pm.7:48: Calling (877-722-3755). I've called this
line before. This is the one with the 70s hold music on the bad
cassette tape.7:54: First recognizable song played on hold: &quot;Every Step
You Take, I'll Be Watching You.&quot;8:05: Still on hold. I hope I'm home
before tomorrow. Not looking hopeful for that impossible dream.8:12:
Talked to George Thomas in Sales. He says I have to wait until the 9th
to activate my special $10 DSL internet deal. He is the first person
besides Billy that actually was aware of the $10 DSL deal, and was able
to confirm the pricing and account requirements. He also mentioned that
all the taxes and special tariff addons that come bundled as
a 'feature' of most broadband internet was less than $1.00 - so I can
expect my monthly bill to be around $11.00 for the DSL, and $7.00 for
the local line (which will be sitting dormant and unused).8:16: Decide
that there's nothing more I can do, and go home for the day.Bottom
Line: This is a To Be Continued thing... I'll do another live blog on
this on the 9th when I go about setting up my DSL service, but it looks
like everything will come to $18.00 a month, and will work as (not)
advertised. I'll withhold final judgement till everything is installed,
but I'm looking forward with cautious optimism./rizznWant to be part of
