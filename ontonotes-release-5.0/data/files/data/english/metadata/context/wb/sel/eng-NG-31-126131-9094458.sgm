I have put together a poll for fans of Julia and SA-CD recordings so
they can vote on Julia's move to Decca and how they fell about it. You
can only vote once. Please pass this link around the internet so we
can get a wide survey of opinion.

So you think Julia Fischer is about SACD technology first?

Maybe you've gotten a few things ass backwards.

About a year ago now, I got a new CD player, that also plays SACDs.  I had
already acquired a couple of hybrid discs, and have gotten a few more since
then.

My equipment is probably pretty low-end compared to most of you--I've
probably got about $1,000 for CD player, speakers, turntable, receiver, and
(comparatively good) headphones.   And perhaps my ears are &quot;low-end&quot; as
well.

But I haven't noticed any difference between SACDs and the best-recorded of
regular CDs.  I have decided that there's no need to seek out SACDs just for
their sound quality.  (Though there's no reason to avoid them either when I
want the recording, except for certain labels--like Chandos!--that are
putting in place ridiculous mark-ups for the new formats.)

Thoughts?

You're equipment looks to be too low end to make it possible to say something
'reliable' about differences between CD and SACD, or to notice some difference.

I have really good ears and I can perceive the improvement of SACD over
CD. However, it seems that the SACD discs themselves are a mixed bag.
Some are great while others aren't any better than a regular CD. I still
buy SACDs but I don't go out of my way to do so.
My player is a Pioneer DV-578A. Probably not the best for SACD.
Does anyone have any experience with the Oppo players. The 970 in
particular?

Believe me, on a high-end system, there's a huge difference, and even more
so through good headphones. Played through my Mark Levinson/B&amp;W system,
SACDs are smoother, have more ambience and depth, and a more palpable

Doesn't that depend on your CD player and SACD player?
The opposite can be 'proven' too if the CD player is top of the art and the SACD
player just average.
Even if you have a all-in-one player for both CD and SACD, there might be a lot
of difference in quality hardware wise.

Sure but if one posits a difference between the media, then it is
either demonstrated by using the best equipment for each or it is not.
One can also find awful SACDs which are inferior to CDs.  So what?

IMHO, the best justification for SACD is the use of hi-res
multichannel which enhances the reproduction, even for solo
performances.

It's a sad thing if an artist is most applauded for the electronic
medium she's recorded in.

Are you even aware this woman can be heard in the concert hall, too?

Of are you apprehensive she wouldn't sound as good as on SACD?

That was not my message--I feel an artist of her stature deserves the
finest possible sound, which only SACD offers. It seems that fewer labels
are using the technology, and I hate to see a fine artist such as Ms.
Fischer deprived of it. It's not that Decca is incapable of good sound, but
generally not as good as afforded by Pentatone.

Well, for the time being there will be some efforts in the direction
of the lossless CODECs on HD video discs (LPCM, Dolby TrueHD and
DTS-HD MA) which are quite excellent.  For opera and ballet, it will
work OK but I do not think that it will be viable long term for
classical music (without video) since the production and licensing
costs are high.

In the long run, these lossless mch formats will be available as
downloads.  The physical media will, I believe, wither away
eventually.  I am now playing with a system that has about 2400 full
resolution CDs on it and it can handle higher resolutions. Access is
nearly instantaneous by means of menus on a touch screen.  But it is
only an example of what is coming and scarily expensive.

As an old fart, I probably will miss those friendly walls of black and
silver discs but not enough to resist.
