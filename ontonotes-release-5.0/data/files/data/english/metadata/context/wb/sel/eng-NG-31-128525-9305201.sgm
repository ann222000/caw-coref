Messages in this topic (4) 2.1. Prayer Requests Posted by: &quot;RevRick73010@aol.com&quot; RevRick73010@aol.com casarecovery Sat Oct 27, 2007 10:13 am (PST) Hi,

You are all in my thoughts and prayers. I'm sorry that I currently don't
have time to answer my e-mails.
I am thinking of you and praying for all of you and your families, and for
the prayer petitions of our on-line prayer groups, even though I can't read
them. I get up early every morning before work to pray. I also pray throughout
the day.

Once again, I am asking for prayers for my work and school situation. Please
continue to pray for a good relationship between me and my new manager. I
have been very honest with him, yet at times he agrees with the false
perspective of some of the admininistrative assistants who misinterpret me. This
has been very stressful for me. He has also been very kind and considerate to
me in other ways. He has made quite a few changes, and I have been doing my
best to adjust to them.

I am also very tired now, from working and going to school evenings, and
trying to understand and grasp the content of the course I am taking. I am
really very stressed and feel overwhelmed and over sensitive. I cannot take
tranquilizers. They put me to sleep and dull my ability to learn. (I tried them
years ago)

Per my new manager's request, I went back to school to study EXCEL. This
intermediate Excel course is far more advanced than the intermediate Excel
course that I took years ago. It is also on Window's Vista, which is quite
different. There are so many complicated formulas. I am following through with
my homework assignments, but, because I am dosing off during my homework times
and in class, and because the formulas are each so unique, and have so many
different uses, I don't completely understand what I am doing and don't feel
that I can apply what I am learning in the workplace. I am very anxious and
overwhelmed about this. There are so many complex and complicated formulas,
and different reasons to use each one of them. My mind doesn't seem to grasp
all of this yet. So, I have to read on weekends and try to study and
understand it, along with all the regular at home responisibilities. So, It could
be very possible that I can get an A or a B for completing my assignments
according to the directions of the text book, and still not be able to
understand how to apply these formulas in real life!

This Intermediate Excel 2007 Course runs for 5 weeks. The Advanced Excel
2007 Course will run for the next 5 weeks. I am enrolled to take both courses.
The company I work for reimburses employees based on the course grade.
Sometimes I wish that I just took this privately without the company even
knowing about it!

I filled out an application for a free tutor at the community college.
I was told that they don't know if any of the tutors have a good background
in the new intermediate and advanced EXCEL.
I have been very worried about this, and worried about my status on the job,
and whether or not I will be able to keep this job based on the outcome of
what I can learn in this class and apply it at work. I don't have a
photographic memory to remember when to add or nest formulas into other formulas etc.
If you put a comma in the wrong place, the whole formula will be wrong! I
really don't grasp which formulas I shoud use and when, even though I am
reading it over and over.
I have been feeling very overwhelmed and frustrated, because I like to be on
top of things, and because many of the younger workers use these formulas
all the time without any difficulty.

It takes me hours to get through an assignment at home, or at the school
computer lab, because I am tired from working hard all day.

I had to take a leave of absence from the choir for the rest of the year, so
that I can study and learn this Excel course material. I am just too tired
to be able to &quot;Do it all&quot;

Please pray for me for a miracle so that all conscious and subconcious
mental blocks or anything in my thinking that prevents me from understanding
this EXCEL course material will be lifted so that I can learn this and be
successful at work.

As you know, I am single, age 54, and self supporting. At this time, I am
still living with very affordable rent because my parents own and rent the
tenement that I live in. They are 83 years old, and will some day be gone, and I
will have to find other living arrangements, hopefully something affordable
with some privacy. I am used to living alone.

Please continue pray for the conversion of my parents to Jesus and the
church.
Please continue to pray for my aunt Eleanor, who is going blind and deaf,
still has her leg infection. She has been in the nursing home for a few years
now.

I am praying for all of you and for your families.

I want to thank you all from my heart for your wonderful friendships,
prayers, and support during the last few years.
I'm sorry that I won't be able read and answer your e-mails for the rest of
this year, like I used to.

Love and prayers for all of you in Jesus our Savior,

Don't Give Up
by Dr. Larry Ollison

Let me ask you a question. When you have a problem in your life, and you’ve done everything spiritually you know to do, what do you do then? When you have prayed and when you have confessed the confession of faith and it seems like nothing has changed, what do you do?
This seems to be a question often asked to those of us in the ministry. As a pastor of a growing church, this is a question that continually arises. So, what’s the answer? What do we do when it seems like we’ve done all we can do and there is no manifestation of our deliverance?
This answer may seem simple, but here it is. Don’t give up. When you know that you know that what you are believing for is God's will for you and promised in His Word, then do not quit doing what God has told you to do. Continue to believe God's Word and continue to confess His promise in the face of what you see and what you feel.
Second Corinthians 5:7 says, &quot;For we walk by faith, not by sight.&quot; As believers it is disastrous to react on what we see, hear, or feel. Instead of reacting to the senses produced by the world, we must act according to the Word spoken by God. His Word brings deliverance and the words of the world bring destruction. When you feel like giving up, quit going by what you feel. Stand in faith and remember that Jesus said, &quot;If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.&quot; (Mark 9:23).
Remember, you can do all things through Christ because He strengthens you to do the impossible.

BLESSINGS FROM THE HEART
Pastor Cecil A. Thompson
October 26, 2007

&quot;I'VE BEEN THERE TOO!&quot;
Matthew 7:9-12
&quot;Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him! So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.&quot;

I just received an e-mail from a life-long friend. He indicated that he seldom forwards messages, but I am glad that he forwarded this one. I have seen it before, but it bears re-reading from time to time:
WET PANTS

&quot;Come with me to a third grade classroom..... There is a nine-year-old kid sitting at his desk and all of a sudden, there is a puddle between his feet and the front of his pants are wet. He thinks his heart is going to stop because he cannot possibly imagine how this has happened. It's never happened before, and he knows that when the boys find out he will never hear the end of it. When the girls find out, they'll never speak to him again as long as he lives.

The boy believes his heart is going to stop; he puts his head down and prays this prayer, &quot;Dear God, this is an emergency! I need help now! Five minutes from now I'm dead meat.&quot;

He looks up from his prayer and here comes the teacher with a look in her eyes that says he has been discovered.

As the teacher is walking toward him, a classmate named Susie is carrying a goldfish bowl that is filled with water. Susie trips in front of the teacher and inexplicably dumps the bowl of water in the boy's lap.

The boy pretends to be angry, but all the while is saying to himself, &quot;Thank you, Lord! Thank you, Lord!&quot;

Now all of a sudden, instead of being the object of ridicule, the boy is the object of sympathy. The teacher rushes him downstairs and gives him gym shorts to put on while his pants dry out. All the other children are on their hands and knees cleaning up around his desk. The sympathy is wonderful. But as life would have it, the ridicule that should have been his has been transferred to someone else - Susie.

She tries to help, but they tell her to get out. You've done enough, you klutz!&quot;

Finally, at the end of the day, as they are waiting for the bus, the boy walks over to Susie and whispers, &quot;You did that on purpose, didn't you?&quot; Susie whispers back, &quot;I wet my pants once too.&quot;

May God help us see the opportunities that are always around us to do good. Remember.....Just going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in your garage makes you a car.&quot;

Today's Scripture contains a portion which has been titled, &quot;The Golden Rule.&quot; &quot;Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.&quot; My prayer is that we will become more like Susie to those around us---willing to sacrifice ourselves for others. Those around us may not see and know what we have done, but God will know!
Blessings dear hearts. Walk with God today, trust Him completely and be a blessing.

Messages in this topic (46) 6a. ENOUGH AND TO SPARE from the book Daily Overcoming Posted by: &quot;Nathaniel &amp; Margaret Williams&quot; nat@hal-pc.org natcmf Sat Oct 27, 2007 12:22 pm (PST) BlankOCTOBER 27

ENOUGH AND TO SPARE

“And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father…”

– Luke 15:17-18

Having spent all that he had, wasting his substance in riotous living, the prodigal finally “came to himself,” faced up to his desperate need, knew that self could offer no more, and a return to father’s house was imperative. In his father’s house even the hired servants had abundant, over and above every need, enough and to spare.

Father’s provision is always “ENOUGH AND TO SPARE,” though we struggle along in selfhood’s rebellion, striving to go our own way and do our own thing. But if we ever “come to our self,” face up to what self is doing to us, and where self has brought us, then we’ll abandon the pursuits of self, and seek Father’s house again, to live in the abundance of His provisions.

“For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.” (2 Cor. 1:5). For this word aboundeth, Williams trans. Gives, “runs over the cup.” Overflowing and super abounding until it runs over the cup, that is “enough and to spare.”

It is true, present life is often filled with the sufferings of Christ until they seem to run over our cup and splash out everywhere. But this is not the end of the situation, nor should we always be “suffering conscious,” because the consolations of Christ also run over the cup. There can be an overflowing life in the midst of present travail and suffering. There is something missing in the concept of how it will be “only glory by and by.” True, with all things reconciled and restored the sorrows of the night will have passed away, all tears been wiped away. But the glory of the ultimate does not take away from the FACT that there is consolation NOW which is “enough and to spare”, much more than any of the negativism. “Moreover, God is powerful to make every grace super abound to you in order that having always an all-sufficiency in all things, you may super abound to every good work.” – 2 Cor. 9:8, Wuest translation

Prayer Request

Hey guys, Please bombard Heaven'sThrone room on behalf of Shannon Wilson. She just got out of the er again today. Extreme pain in her back and abdomen. She started throwing up and passed out. After another cat scan, they said she had passed a kidney stone from her kidney to the urethea but it was causing urine to back up and putting pressure on everything else. He also said her uterus was very enlarged and had tumors. This is causing the pressure from 2 things happening at once to cause her more swelling and discomfort. Please pray the stone will pass quickly and that the tumors will be benign. love ya Lynn

For those that have asked about John's pacer...........

this is the first recalled one to be removed. no they keep the pacer in but put in a new lead(wire) which is risky to take out. as scar tissue grow around these and if they cannot get out with out damage to heart or bleeding will cap it off and put another one in another vein. so makes me very nervous.....so keep the prayers a coming and hope nothing happens before the 27th
God Bless

So, I am asking for prayers that I can find an apartment even with this credit rating.

Update on Roger from Lennie

Please pray for Roger, my brother-in-law, as he is at a critical time in his treatment. He is very weak and sleepy but his body is strong for a leukemia patient. The doctor's have given him a medication called mylotarg that is mixed with the chemo treatments, thus he has no white blood cells because they've all been distroyed as well as no cancer blasts have been found in his body...praise God!! The lack of white blood cells, however, makes him unable to fight any infection; of which he is suddenly having a problem with. So he is now on nuprogen which is an antibiotic that makes him very sick. They cannot give him anything to help him not feel sick.

God has provided 8 donor matches for his stem cell. So, as soon as his white count goes up they will do a stem cell transplant through his bone marrow. He needs to stay free of cancer blasts for 14 days....he's now on day 11. That means that early next week he should be having the bone marrow transplant! My sister is holding up well. I thank God for that!

Keep praying...God is faithful,
Lennie

Rev. Charles Sutton

I know that you are praying for me, and I sure do appreciate it. I have
three more weeks to go. However we will only have PT for one hour twice a
week. Then on November 12 we will have four hours of physical assessment to
see how much progress we have made. We have tons of material to study and
learn. We have a test after each block of material we study. We have had
four tests so far and I have made 72, 90, 90, and 80. I am so thankful that
I still have a job, and I enjoy working for this Sheriff, but I do not want
to work in the jail. I am praying that if I cannot continue to be a Deputy
Sheriff here that I will get a job as Deputy Sheriff in Georgia. I am
certified there and will not have to go through all this hassle they are
requiring here.
Continue to pray for me. GOD BLESS YOU!!

PLEASE PRAY FOR LYNNE

Hi Donna Mae,
I am suffering with pain and praying for relief. I go on Wednesday to S.S. for the first hearing on my disability claim. I have no money to go to the Dr. or pay for meds if I could find one who would see me, I am sure if I, or I should say when I go to an ortho Dr. they will want to go back in and cut more, I don't want to do that again. Recovery time is so long and slow, can't bear to think of it.
Sorry I don't mean to dump my problems on you, I know you are having some also. I pray for you and your hubby and your ministry daily, you are wonderful people.
Blessings To You

Jim's home from the hospital

HI

It's been a very long week! But, PRAISE GOD, Jim is home and doing pretty good. He's still quite shaky trying to get from the bedroom to the living room, but can manage with the walker. There is OBVIOUS problems with the left side, but he still won't admit it! Such a stubborn MAN! LOL His biggest problem right now seems to be hiccups! non-stop pretty much since Saturday....Personally I think it may be one of the medicines that he is on...I'll talk to the dr when we go see him in a few days. Right now he is on about 12 medicines and 2 types of insulin, twice a day...Oh boy, I get to poke him!! But all being considered, I'm happy he's still here. God is AWESOME.
Thank you all so much for your faithful prayers and wonderful e-mails. They mean so much to me

God Bless
Christine &amp; family

PRAYER REQUESTS

Mary5281@aol.com

I am having a procedure done Tues. morning on my lower back.
They are putting an injection in it that will hopefully stop the pain
in my back, and maybe my leg, too.
Please remember me in your prayers. Also remember one of my
neighbors, Honor. She fell and broke her hip yesterday morning. (She
is Hannah and Marissa's grandma.) My husband, Harry, fell last night
in the bedroom. He hit his head and left shoulder. I don't think
he broke anything, just real sore. Remember him in your prayers,
too. He has lost about 90 pounds in the last two years. You
wouldn't recognize him, Jane. He weighs only 166 pounds now. The
doctor doesn't know what is causing the weight loss. He sleeps a lot,
too. He has Alzheimer's and Parkison's. Thanks for all your
prayers.
Love in
Christ, Mary

Urban Legends Reference Pages:
Update #331

Hello again from snopes.com, where we shed light on the wild tales you've heard! This e-mail gives information about new articles recently added to the Urban Legends Reference Pages and provides pointers to older pieces about rumors and hoaxes still wandering into everyone's inboxes. Our last update mailing was September 29, 2007.

If after this update you are left wondering about something newly arrived in your inbox, our search engine stands ready to assist you. Bookmark that URL — it's a keeper!

An RSS feed for our What's New page is available at the following URL:
http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.xml

And now to the legends, the mayhem, and the misinformation!

----------------------------------------------------------

New Articles

a.. Jamba Juice freebie!

b.. E-mail purports to describe an attempted abduction rape in Vacaville, California.

c.. Open letter to the Atlanta NAACP protests the chapter president's support of Michael Vick.

d.. Update: Another Internet-circulated appeal about abandoned puppies needing adoption, these ones Labrador mix.

e.. More monetary mayhem: E-mail warns that a proposed redesign of the Lincoln Cent will omit the motto &quot;In God We Trust.&quot;

f.. Photographs show a bear rescued from the ledge of a bridge.

g.. Yohana Ravelo: missing child or Internet hoax?

h.. E-mail decries the Red Cross for providing supplies to marchers in Jena, Louisiana.
Worth a Second Look

a.. A lawyer demonstrating the safety of windows in a skyscraper crashed through a pane and plunged to his death.
Still Haunting the Inbox
a.. 15-year-old Evan Trembley of Wichita Falls, Texas, isn't missing - it's a hoax.

b.. Dialing #77 or *677 is not a surefire way of reaching the local highway patrol — the service is in place in some regions, but not in others. If in need of assistance, dial 911 instead for the sure thing.

c.. We look at two eraser sponge rumors, that they contain formaldehyde or have caused chemical burns when rubbed on skin.

d.. While it's true a consortium of wireless providers is planning to create a 411 (directory assistance) service for cell phone numbers, you need not register your cell phone with the national &quot;Do Not Call&quot; directory to prevent your number from being provided to telemarketers.

e.. The missing child alert about 13-year-old Ashley Flores of Philadelphia is a hoax.

f.. Petition advocates buying/not buying gasoline from Citgo. And no, Citgo did not change its name to Petro Express.

g.. No, the new dollar coin doesn't omit &quot;In God We Trust&quot; - that phrase has been stamped into its edge.

h.. The entreaty to aid 7-year-old Amy Bruce who is dying of lung cancer and a brain tumor by forwarding an email and a sappy poem titled &quot;Slow Dance&quot; is a hoax.

i.. E-mail compares George W. Bush's eco-friendly ranch with Al Gore's energy-expending mansion.

j.. E-mailed petition advocates denying social services to immigrants.

k.. Will pressing #-9-0 on your telephone allow scammers to make long-distance calls and charge them to your phone bill?

l.. No, Johns Hopkins Hospital has not issued a &quot;cancer update&quot; detailing how cancer spreads and recommending methods for treating the disease.

m.. Is Illinois Senator Barack Obama &quot;ideologically Muslim&quot;?

n.. 809 area code scam: Unsuspecting phone customers have been gulled by con artists into placing calls to area codes in the Caribbean that result in hefty charges.

o.. While the FDA health advisory regarding drugs containing PPA (phenylpropanolamine) is the real thing, it's outdated.

p.. While actor Lee Marvin did fight in the Pacific theater during World War II, earned a Purple Heart, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, he and Bob Keeshan (TV's &quot;Captain Kangaroo,&quot;) did not fight together in the battle for Iwo Jima.

q.. There was no letter to Starbucks from coffee-seeking G.I.s serving in Iraq, so no response from the coffee retailer saying it didn't support the war and anyone in it. As for Oscar Mayer refusing troops free hot dogs, the 2004 Starbucks e-mail was altered in 2007 to aim it at the blameless hot dog maker.

r.. No, Jay Leno did not write the &quot;Hits the Nail on the Head&quot; essay — it was Craig R. Smith.

s.. There's no abductor prowling the Target parking lot in Wheaton, Illinois, who is using an old lady who appears to be in distress to lure victims.

t.. E-mail claims Jane Fonda betrayed U.S. POWs during the Vietnam War.

u.. During the 1987 Iran-Contra hearings, Oliver North did decry that a certain terrorist was &quot;the most evil person alive&quot; and that &quot;an assassin team [should] be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth,&quot; but he wasn't talking about Osama bin Laden.

v.. Images do show the USS New York, which is being built with steel from the Twin Towers.

w.. No, robbers are not luring female victims into sniffing ether-laced perfume in parking lots.

x.. While it is true that in 2004 a man in India was electrocuted when trying to use his cell phone as it recharged, it is safe to use your cell phone while it is charging.

y.. Hillary Clinton is the subject of many e-mailed items, and our &quot;Clintons&quot; section contains write-ups about a number of them.

z.. No, Bill Gates is not sharing his fortune with everyone who forwards a specific e-mail on his behalf. This tired leg-pull continues to romp through everyone's inbox, the most widespread incarnation swearing &quot;This took two pages of the Tuesday USA Today!&quot;

aa.. Virus announcement and virus hoax e-mails are afoot! We try to keep current on them and do our best to point readers to authoritative links confirming or debunking them.
Fraud Afoot
a.. Seems like everyone has become the recipient of mysterious e-mails promising untold wealth if only one helps a wealthy foreigner quietly move millions of dollars out of his country. The venerable Nigerian Scam has discovered the goldmine that is the Internet. Beware — there's still no such thing as &quot;something for nothing,&quot; and the contents of your bank account will end up with these wily foreigners if you fall in with this.

b.. Likewise, look out for mailings announcing you've won a foreign lottery you don't recall entering.

c.. Or that because you share the surname of a wealthy person who died without leaving a will you're in line for a windfall inheritance.

d.. And be especially wary if, while trying to sell or rent anything online (car, boat, horse, motorcycle, painting, apartment, you name it) you're approached by a prospective buyer/renter who wants to pay with a cashier check made out for an amount in excess of the agreed-upon price and who asks the balance be sent to a third party.

e.. Aspiring work-at-homers promised big bucks for acting as intermediaries for international transactions wherein they cash checks for other parties or reship goods to them have been defrauded by con artists. Don't you be next.

f.. If someone telephones to announce you can have a $200 Wal-Mart shopping spree or $200 in gasoline coupons in return for a $3.49 processing charge to be debited directly from your bank account, hang up. You're being set up via the promise of &quot;something for almost nothing&quot; into authorizing a swindler to help himself to the contents of your bank account.

g.. If someone calls to announce you've failed to appear for jury duty and will be arrested, do not give the caller your personal and financial information in an effort to prove he's sending the gendarmes after the wrong guy. You're being tricked into giving up this information to an identity thief.

This was true but very outdated. The recall was on Nov. 6, 2000 (just about 7 years ago). See the URL below from Snopes. The reason it is still going around after all these years is to gather addresses to which spam will be sent. Someone should advise Donna, whose name is at the bottom. They won't get addresses from us because we are sending this to our groups by Bcc (blind copy).

Subject: Do Not take this Drug

Hi Everyone

I am passing this email forwarded to me this morning. It's about a medication that is familiar to many of us. Note also the FDA 's comments at the end of the message.

I received this information from a friend.

Here are the details and I suggest you pass it on to your loved ones and others.

Subject: Phenylpropanolamine (PPA)

I would like to thank those of you who expressed condolences on the recent passing of my mother. She suffered a hemorrhagic stroke while she was driving home from my house on 7/30 and passed away on 8/3. My mother's stroke and passing was an enormous shock to my family because she did not have any symptoms or risk factors for a stroke. Just the week before she had gone to her doctor for a check up and received a clean bill of health. She did, however, develop a cold while she was visiting me and had taken Alka Seltzer Cold Plus for 3 days.
Since her passing, we have learned that Alka Seltzer is one of the many cold medicines that contains Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) which can cause hemorrhagic stokes or cerebral bleeding even with the first use. I am forwarding a list of other medications that currently use PPA. These medicines are supposedly being recalled but my mother just purchased this medication less than two weeks ago. Pharmaceutical companies have known about this danger for years, we unfortunately, did not.
I urge you to review the list of medicines with PPA and avoid these medications. All drugs containing PHENYLPROPANOLAMINE are dangerous. You may want to try calling the 800 number listed on most drug boxes and inquire about a REFUND. Please read this CAREFULLY. Also, please pass this on to everyone you know. STOP TAKING anything containing this ingredient. It has been linked to increased hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding in brain) among women ages 18-49 in the three days after starting use of medication. Problems were not found in men, but the FDA recommended that everyone (even children) seek alternative medicine.

The following medications contain Phenylpropanolamine :
Acutrim Diet Gum Appetite Suppressant
Acutrim Plus Dietary Supplements
Acutrim Maximum Strength Appetite Control
Alka-Seltzer Plus Children's Cold Medicine
Effervescent
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold medicine (cherry or or ange)
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold Medicine Original
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold &amp; Cough Medicine Effervescent
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold &amp; Flu Medicine
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold &amp; Sinus Effervescent
Alka Seltzer Plus Night-Time Cold Medicine
BC Allergy Sinus Cold Powder
BC Sinus Cold Powder
Comtrex Flu Therapy &amp; Fever Relief
Day &amp; Night Contac 12-Hour Cold Capsules
Contac 12 Hour Caplets
Coricidin D Cold, Flu &amp; Sinus
Dexatrim Caffeine Free
Dexatrim Extended Duration
Dexatrim Gelcaps
Dexatrim Vitamin C/Caffeine Free
Dimetapp Cold &amp; Allergy Chewable Tablets
Dimetapp Cold &amp; Cough Liqui-Gels
Dimetapp DM Cold &amp; Cough Elixir
Dimetapp Elixir
Dimetapp 4 Hour Liquid Gels
Dimetapp 4 Hour Tablets
Dimetapp 12 Hour Extentabs Tablets
Naldecon DX Pediatric Drops
Permathene Mega-16
Robitussin CF
Tavist-D 12 Hour Relief of Sinus &amp; Nasal Congestion
Triaminic DM Cough Rel! Ief
Triaminic Expectorant Chest &amp; Head
Triaminic Syrup ! ! Cold &amp; amp;am p; Allergy
Triaminic Triaminicol Cold &amp; Cough

I just found out and called the 800# on the container for Triaminic and they informed me that they are voluntarily recalling the following medicines because of a certain ingredient that is causing strokes and seizures in children:

Orange 3D Cold &amp; Allergy Cherry (Pink)
3D Cold &amp; Cough Berry
3D Cough Relief Yellow 3D Expectorant
They are asking you to call them at 800-548-3708 with the lot number on the box so they can send you postage for you to send it back to them, and they will also issue you a refund. If you know of anyone else with small children,

PLEASE PASS THIS ON. THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF!

DO PASS ALONG TO ALL ON YOUR MAILING LIST so people are
Informed. They can then pass it along to their families.
To confirm these findings please take time to check the following:

Messages in this topic (1) 12. OH, LORD, COME &amp; OPEN MY EYES THAT I MIGHT SEE Posted by: &quot;Mary Ann&quot; HeartforGod7@shaw.ca serenity72000 Sat Oct 27, 2007 2:54 pm (PST)

Visit Our Website | View Our Archives

Oh, Lord, Come &amp; Open My Eyes That I Might See

&quot;The desire to see spiritually is essential to clear perception of truth.&quot; - The People's New Testament

&quot;It is far better to have the eyes opened than to be placed in the midst of the noblest prospects and remain blind to their beauty.&quot;
- Charles Spurgeon

&quot;Ignorance is represented by the eyes being closed, and the instrument of the gospel by the opening of the eyes.&quot;
- Barnes' Notes

&quot;Moral blindness is the worst kind of blindness.&quot;
&quot;Man by nature is spiritually blind.&quot;
- both of the above quotes are from the Biblical Illustrator - Old Testament

The Psalmist in Psalm 119:18 cried out to God - &quot;Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law.&quot; Certainly, he was not talking about his physical eyesight here. His physical eyes were opened, yet he realized that he was not seeing everything there was to be seen in God's law. Something was impairing his spiritual vision. He was only gleaning the surface knowledge of what he was reading and had a great desire to dig deeper.

His prayer was basically asking God to give him an understanding...enlighten his mind by the light of the Holy Spirit...dispel all ignorance and error...take away from his eyes whatever was preventing clear vision...take off the veil of darkness and ignorance from his heart...and allow the scales to drop from his eyes so that he could discern divine and spiritual things.

He realized that the more God opened his eyes, the more wonders he would be able to see in the Word.

&quot;Open Thou mine eyes&quot; - This was a very familiar Eastern figure of speech that was based on the fact that the eye is dependent on the mind and the will. It was a figure of speech used to represent the quickening of spiritual discernment.

Why did the Psalmist pray such a prayer? Wasn't he able to discern the &quot;deep things&quot; of God as he read through His Word? Weren't spiritual truths supposed to simply open up before him as he continued in his study?

Apparently not! The things that are seen and temporal that surround us have the power to dim and darken the vision of things unseen and temporal. We simply cannot see into the spiritual realm without the help of Almighty God. The worldly things that we have looked upon all day long have a tendency to lay scales and veils over our eyes and hearts. Hence, it is imperative that every time that we open God's Holy Bible, we pray this prayer - &quot;Open Thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law.&quot;

This is the reason why so many open the Bible and read and yet get nothing out of their time of reading. The Bible is as a closed book to them. They don't quite understand what God is trying to say. They get the basic gist of the story but don't realize what is beyond the surface.

This is also the reason why some folk will read the Bible for years and years and never be changed by its power. They are the same way they were when they got saved twenty...ten...five...or one year ago. They never break through to God nor allow Him to break through to them. It is as though they are reading this &quot;open&quot; book with a veil or scales over their eyes. And they wonder why - after so many years - they still show forth a total ignorance of spiritual things. They have never had their eyes opened to see all that God has hidden for them to see.

In Isaiah 29:18, we read - &quot;And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.&quot; It is God's will to bring His people out of gross ignorance into a clear and saving knowledge of the truth.

Isaiah 32:3 says - &quot;And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim...&quot; God desires that all of His people have a clear view of divine truth. No more does He want them to see spiritual things obscurely but to have a sharp discerning of Gospel truths.

In Isaiah 35:5, we read - &quot;Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened...&quot; God's grace alone has the power to open the eyes of our understanding.

Notice that the Scriptures state that God alone is the One Who can opens our eyes to see Biblical truths as He wrote them. This is implied in Deuteronomy 29:4 which says - &quot;Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.&quot; It is the workmanship of God to give &quot;eyes to see&quot; - the ability to understand and learn His wonderful truths.

It is boldly proclaimed in Psalm 146:8 which says - &quot;The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind...&quot; Yes, He opens the eyes of the physically blind. But let's not forget that He also gives the knowledge of divine things to those who are spiritually blind as well.

It is possible to see and yet not see.

In Matthew 13:13, the Lord Jesus referred to a people who - &quot;...seeing see not...&quot;
In Jeremiah 5:21, the Prophet Jeremiah described them in this way - &quot; Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not...&quot;
And, in Ezekiel 12:2, the Prophet described them yet another way - &quot;Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not...&quot;

These are the people who don't understand spiritual signification. They don't see the true Light on account of their spiritual ignorance and depravity. They have closed their eyes against the Light. They have rejected divine teaching. They are unwilling to understand the things of God. They don't have more knowledge because they don't use what they have already. Their understanding is darkened. Hence, they are willfully blind. They have the capacity to understand, yet they do not understand. Their hearts are hardened . They have become preoccupied with mere temporalities.

What about you, O Christian?

Whenever you open God's Word, do you pray that He would open your eyes to see &quot;wondrous things&quot; out of His law? Or do you simply read to fulfill a religious obligation?

Are you aware of the fact that you can have eyes to see and yet not see what God is trying to say to you at the time?

You may wonder why nothing is happening in your life - why nothing seems to change for the better. Days run into weeks...weeks run into months...months run into years - and you are not changed. You are still the same as you have always been - spiritually speaking.

You are not seeing into God's Word for several reasons. You may be living in sin which will definitely cause spiritual blindness. You may have shut your heart to some divine teaching or truth in His Word because it didn't fit into your denominational mold. Resultantly, your heart is hardened to receive any other truths. Or you may be so preoccupied with all that is happening around you that your heart and mind are totally distracted from the things of God.

Go before the Lord and cry out to Him to examine the state of your heart right now. Allow Him to remove the scales from your eyes that keep you from seeing all that He has for you in His Word.

Your answer is found in the Holy Scriptures. You may not see it, but it is there.

It isn't that God is hiding it from you. You are not seeing it because your eyes have become dim or blinded through sin, compromise, or worldliness.

From the depths of your heart, why not cry out to Jesus and say - &quot;Open Thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law&quot; ?

Be sure to pray this prayer every time that you open the Holy Scriptures. Watch and see how God will reveal mighty life-changing truths to you.

Your life will never be the same again as a result.

May God Bless His Word.
