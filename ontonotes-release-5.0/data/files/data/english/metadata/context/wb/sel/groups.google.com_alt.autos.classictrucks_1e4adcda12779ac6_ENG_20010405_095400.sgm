Hey Folks,

I am hoping someone out there can help me. I am looking for any and
all reference material on this beast. I am a scale model builder, and am
looking to do a Squad 51 from the early 70's TV show Emergency!. It was
a 1972 Dodge D-300, the commercial version of the D-100/200 Adventurer.
Looking for the standard chassis length version, not the short box side
step.
If you have photos, tech manual, or actually have one, I would like
to talk to you. My understanding is that the same body (mostly) and most
of the mechanicals are the same from 69' to '78.
Any help would be greatly appreciated. BTW, as a side note, my
company, Millennia Models International, (MMI) offers a build up service
for model kits. We build a replica of your vehicle (or any vehicle or
model for that fact) to your specs). Now you can have a copy of your
favorite ride sitting on the mantel. Just thought I would throw that in.
A bit od shameless self promotion. Sorry. :-)

Later...

Sorry no help on the truck, but can you give some more info on costs of your
models? How much for a 1:24 scale model?

Hey Tommy, Ed,

"/>  Well, the price varies. It could be as little $50.00, as much as, well, there
is no real upper limit. Depends on things like what scale (in this case 1/24(25)),
and the complexity of the kit, if there is even a kit available. If you wanted a
1/24 scale '57 Chevy stock, that would be cheap, as compared to a 1/24 Kenworth
with Trailer, (even stock). The shear size difference alone.
If there is a kit, on average (don't quote me on this) it would run about
$150.00 CDN ($107.00 US). That would include things like painting the right colour
(even a spray bomb for custom colour matching), and a license plate to match
yours. If the kit comes with an engine, that would be built, but not highly
detailed (only what comes in the kit), as in no distributor wiring, and stuff like
that. If the car has the wrong rims/tires, costs extra to swap them out.
Basically, the more it deviates from what's in the box, the more it costs. Now,
there are short cuts, and cheats, and so on.
This $150.00 CDN ($107.00 US), is for what we call OOB (Out Of Box). Means
not much modification. Colour and things like that are easy to change, maybe using
some after market tires and wheels.
From there you can get into things like getting the right engine, wiring it,
right down to the carb linkage. Making sure that is has your rims, tires, muffler,
and garbage on the back seat. Dents, dings, rust, missing bits, added bits, and so
on. There is no limit, as long as the cheque clears. :-)

Now, if there is no kit of the subject. That gets into a completely different
story. Then we have to built the subject from scratch. Again, we can take short
cuts, cheats, and what not. I'm working on this '72 Dodge D-300. Well, I'm
starting with a '78 D-100 short box. Gives me a start, but still some ways to go
(new chassis, drive shaft, dually rear end, utility box, light bar, modify the
hood, dash, bucket to bench seat and so on). Some times it's as easy as swapping
out a grille. Then others you star flaring the fenders a little more (or less),
steal a hood from that kit, ad the trunk and roof from that one, those seats are
wrong for that Chevy kit, but are almost perfect for this Ford. I have a HUGE
spare parts box.

Best bet is to tell me what you have (year, make model, any special trim
package ). And then what level of detail you would like. Also, if you could
include things like if that body style was used for more than that year. For
example, the Dodge trucks used the same basic cab from 69' to '78.

Most builds will take anywhere from 2 to 4 months. Sometimes faster, sometimes
longer. Again, depending on the complexity, and so on. The faster you want it, the
more it will cost.

Well, how many of you have fallen asleep?? :-) Please, if you have any
questions or comments (or info on the '72 Dodge D-300), contact me at your
convenience.
