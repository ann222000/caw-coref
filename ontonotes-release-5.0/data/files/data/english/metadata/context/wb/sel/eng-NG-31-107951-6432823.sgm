For the fourth year in a row, I'm running a game of picking winners
of professional cycling races.  The goal of the contest is for it to
be very simple to play: just send me your top 3 picks for each race,
and I handle keeping score.  The first race is Milan San Remo, this
Saturday.

For communication on the game, I have set up a mailing list:
http://groups.google.com/group/mp3cycling

I also have a web site, which will eventually be updated for this year's
contest (not yet):
http://mp3.djconnel.com/

To enter for Milan-San Remo, send your top 3 picks as follows, in the body
of an email:

MSR 1 Thomas Voeckler
MSR 2 Laurens Ten Dam
MSR 3 Enrico Gasparotto

send the email to: mp3_at_djconnel_dot_com   &lt;--- SEND EMAIL HERE (don't reply to this message)

where the names are pasted from CyclingNews.com (in this case,
http://www.cyclingnews.com/road/2007/mar07/msr07/?id=startlist ).

It's important the entry be formatted in this way -- the race code
tells my parser that it is reading an entry line.  Otherwise it just
assumes a line is part of the virtually endless stream of junk most
emails contain in headers, attachments, etc....

If you're interested, please subscribe to the mailing list:
http://groups.google.com/group/mp3cycling

thanks,
Dan

No -- just the names pasted from the start list.  The reason I like the names pasted is that it avoids spelling errors, and also avoids issues of multiple
spellings of an individual's name (how many ways can one spell "Gontchar"?)

Really, all I need is the last name, unless this is ambiguous, then it generally picks the rider higher ranked by the UCI in 2004...

But, as a backup, I have a little perl routine which tries to correct spelling errors on established riders.

See, this is what Ricodjour was warning us about. Next he'll ask for
your bank account number so you can receive your 'prize'.

Doesn't even reference a college or university. And how legitimate
could it be with Voekler listed as a number one?

So, with everyone else falling down and getting banged up, I'm betting
MSR 1 Tom Boonen will be the most common entry. MSR 2 Alessandro
Petacchi has to be up there. I'm going to throw in MSR 3 Oscar Freire
for the hell of it.

It can start by having Alessandro spell his last name right. What's
with the one T and two Cs anyway? Just doesn't look American.

Unfortunately the prize money is currently tied up in a bank account in Nigeria.  But I'm working on that problem now.

Exactly.  And how does he handle Tyler Hamilton and Tyler Hamilton
Chimera Prime?  Which one is ranked higher?  This sounds like the
roulette wheel.  "In 1842, fellow Frenchmen François and Louis Blanc
added the "0" to the roulette wheel in order to achieve a house
advantage." - FLIUFYSB

Don't go dissing Voeckler.  He has intestinal fortitude.  That's
something that no amount of training will give you.  Dollars to donuts
the French are working in secret labs to clone him, and that's
probably why their labs are understaffed to the point that the same
guys have to test both the A and B samples.

P.S. I'd be amazed if #3 comes through.... Assuming you mean Fast Freddy.  He just lacked the punch at TOC.

Speaking of TOC, Haedo is a decent favorite.  But he didn't show he can hang on the hills in CA.  I don't see
him in the game at the end.

It was 5 years ago....

And he was 5 years younger, then.

P.S. My picks were:

MSR 1 Tom Boonen
MSR 2 Filippo Pozzato
MSR 3 Danilo Napolitano

I avoided picking teammates.  Napolitano showed a string of very impressive results
late last year, and finished strongly in last year's MSR.
