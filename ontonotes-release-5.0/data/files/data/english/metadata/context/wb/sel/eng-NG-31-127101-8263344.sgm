MERV GRIFFIN IN HOSPITAL
Friday, July 20. 2007

TV game show impresario Merv Griffin is in a Los Angeles hospital being
treated for a recurrence of prostate cancer, his company The Griffin Group
said yesterday.

Griffin, 82, a singer and talk show host who also created and produced the
popular game shows &quot;Jeopardy&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune,&quot; is being treated at
the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Marcia Newberger, spokeswoman for The
Griffin Group, said in a statement.

Griffin said in a statement: &quot;I'd rather play 'Jeopardy!' than live it. I
was ready for a vacation; however, this wasn't the destination I had in
mind.&quot;

in mind.&quot;

=====&gt; at least, he's still got a sense of humor.

&quot;Many more men die with prostate cancer than of it. Growing old is
invariably fatal. Prostate cancer is only sometimes so.&quot;

On top of that, he joins a group of other well known folks and US, I wish
him the best. Years ago I had a colleague who claimed to live near Â Griffin
in Clinton, NJ and claimed that the name on the mailbox was &quot;R. Katkiller&quot; ,
if true, that would deter or decieve the people who would intrude on his
private life, and that's good.
