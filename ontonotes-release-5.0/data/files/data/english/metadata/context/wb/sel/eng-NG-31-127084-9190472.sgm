&quot;Hyperferritinemia was detected in 23% of SLE patients, 15% of DM
patients, 8% of MS patients, and 4% of RA patients.&quot;

WHEN 'they' actually SEE / recognise this iron / ferritin it is
rather .. high / hyperferritinemia .
Seeing that they HAVE seen it now at such a HIGH rate makes one wonder
how many DO have .. high ferritin / hyperferritinemia / high iron.
Everyone has ALSO low levels of vitamin D which is ..
coincidentally .. destroyed / depleted by iron.
They say this high ferritin / hyperferritinemia / high iron may be
used as an &quot;acute-phase reactant marker&quot; but fail to say it also
PREVENTS someone from being diagnosed with iron overload.

In Stills' disease it has ALWAYS been used to disregard the
POSSIBILITY of iron and recently has been found to be USELESS in
Stills' and when the second marker is used .. ?
They have iron overload.

Are they killing .. you .. too .. ?

Abstract:

The development of autoimmune diseases may be influenced by hormonal,
immunomodulatory, and metabolic pathways. Prolactin (PRL), ferritin,
vitamin D, and the tumor marker tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA) were
measured in autoimmune diseases: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),
systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polymyositis
(PM), dermatomyositis (DM), multiple sclerosis (MS), autoimmune
thyroid diseases, and antiphospholipid syndrome. Hyperprolactinemia
(HPRL) was detected in 24% of PM patients, in 21% of SLE patients, in
6.7% of MS patients, 6% of RA patients, and in 3% of SSc patients.
Hyperferritinemia was detected in 23% of SLE patients, 15% of DM
patients, 8% of MS patients, and 4% of RA patients. The patients had
relatively low levels of 25 OH Vitamin D: the average results (mean ±
SD) were between 9.3 ± 4.4 to 13.7 ± 7.1 ng/mL in the different
diseases, while the 25 OH Vitamin D concentrations less than 20 ng/mL
are regarded as deficient. TPA levels were in the same range of the
controls, elevated only in SLE. HPRL, hyperferritinemia,
hypovitaminosis D, and TPA levels did not correlate with SLE activity
elevated levels of rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies in RA.
HPRL, hyperferritinemia, and hypovitaminosis D have different
immunological implications in the pathogenesis of the autoimmune
diseases. Preventive treatment with vitamin D or therapy for HPRL with
dopamine agonists, may be considered in certain cases.
Hyperferritinemia may be used as an acute-phase reactant marker in
autoimmune diseases mainly SLE. TPA may be used to indicate the
tendency for malignancies.

OBJECTIVES:
Serum ferritin increases in various disorders and clinical
conditions. However, causal associations between the serum ferritin
level and clinical factors that influence serum ferritin level are
not well characterized. We report a model that quantitatively
analyzes
the causal relations between the serum ferritin level and clinical
factors.
DESIGN AND METHODS:
We analyzed the ferritin level and other
laboratory data in the sera of 274 patients. Structural equation
modeling was used to verify causal relations and the adequacy of
latent factors.
RESULTS:
Three factors representing clinical status
were identified: cell damage, hepatic function, and inflammation.
Serum iron (SI) had the strongest effect on serum ferritin elevation.
The effect of the cell damage factor on serum ferritin indicated cell
destruction, and that of the hepatic function factor represented
decreased serum ferritin clearance. The cell damage factor also
indirectly increased the ferritin level via SI or the hepatic
function factor.
The total effect of the inflammatory status factor on
ferritin level was very weak.
CONCLUSIONS:
These causal relations may explain
the mechanism of serum ferritin level elevation in various clinical
conditions.

Comparative study of intravenous ascorbic acid versus low-dose
desferroxamine
in patients on hemodialysis with hyperferritinemia.

Concha, Zamora, Spain. jde ... @saludalia.com

BACKGROUND:
In patients on hemodialysis (HD), parenteral iron improves the
response to recombinant human erythropoietin (rhuEPO) therapy, but in
some subjects it produces an iron overload, increasing their morbidity
and
mortality rates. In these cases, iron administration must be
discontinued.
This study aimed to investigate the efficiency of treatment with
ascorbic
acid (AA) or desferroxamine (DFO) to mobilize and reduce iron stores,
and to
determine the effect of these compounds on erythropoiesis.
METHODS:
We performed a prospective and randomized trial over 6 months, which
included 27 patients with serum ferritin levels &gt;800 ng/mL, TSAT &gt;30%
and stabilized hemoglobin (Hb) and rhuEPO doses.
All patients had previously received parenteral iron (Ferlecit).
Nine patients received 200 mg of intravenous (i.v.) AA 3 times/week
and
nine patients received 1 mg/Kg/week of DFO; the remaining nine
patients
were the control group.
RESULTS:
There were no significant differences in iron
loss or mobilization due to dialysis. When Ferlecit was discontinued,
functional iron did not vary and the epoetin resistance index
(rhuEPO dose/Hb) was reduced by 21% in the i.v. AA group.
In the DFO and control groups, functional iron levels fell.
In the DFO group the epoetin resistance index increased by 20%,
with no modifications in the control group.
There was a positive correlation between transaminases and serum
ferritin.
CONCLUSIONS:
In HD patients with an iron overload, neither i.v. AA administration
or low-dose
DFO increased iron mobilization or iron loss due to dialysis. I.v. AA
administration
allows elimination of iron from stores without any drop in the
functional iron
produced by discontinuing parenteral maintenance iron; it also
improves
the response to rhuEPO. DFO did not elicit any positive effects on
erythropoiesis.

Effect of iron reduction by phlebotomy in Japanese patients with
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: A pilot study.
Sumida Y, Kanemasa K, Fukumoto K, Yoshida N, Sakai K, Nakashima T,

Hepatol Res. 2006 Sep 11;

Increased hepatic iron deposition may play a role in the pathogenesis
of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This study aimed to test
whether iron removal by phlebotomy improves serum transaminase
activities in patients with NASH. Eleven patients (six males and five
females) with biopsy-proven NASH underwent phlebotomy biweekly until
they reached near-iron deficiency (NID) (serum ferritin concentration
lower than or equal to 30ng/ml). Nine patients completed this study.
Serum ferritin levels in these patients fell from 563+/-322 to
18+/-9ng/ml (p=0.001). The treatment reduced mean serum alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) activity from 126+/-47 to 56+/-17IU/l
(p=0.002).

Their weight did not change significantly throughout the study
period.
Although two patients withdrew from the study, none was affected by
any
side effects of repeated phlebotomy that required discontinuing the
treatment. In

This excess Iron is the root cause of Inflammatory and Autoimmune
disorders.
This excess Iron gets deposited in brain and other organs such as
liver, kidneys etc. causing variety of diseases ranging from
recurring
infections to cancer

I believe that Autistic individuals have an inborn error in Iron
metabolism. Human body does not have any mechanism to excrete Iron.
Iron is lost mostly through growth of hair, skin, sweat and bleeding.
