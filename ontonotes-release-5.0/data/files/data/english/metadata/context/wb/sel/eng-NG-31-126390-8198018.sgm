The first thing that stands out is smaller function keys, media keys
sharing space with F8 thru F11. Guess they had to do this when the
number of media keys exceeded four.

I don't buy it. I don't buy it because the low profile keys will
gratuitously turn off a lot of people. I don't buy it because there are
a number of subtle and fairly pointless deviations from the keyboard
designs Apple has been using for 20+ years. I don't believe it because
frankly, it's ugly (although some of that might be attributable to it
being a prototype).

Some odd &quot;changes&quot; noted for point 2:

1. The icon on the forward delete key deviates from what it's been since
that key debuted on the Mac.
2. Not sure what that is to the left of the 'home' key. It doesn't say
'help'. It _looks_ like it might safe 'fn' but a key to activate
function key behavior of the function keys is frankly stupid.
3. The Command key has a text label (which is not inherently a problem)
but
3a. The Option key doesn't have an icon. I'd think if after almost 24 if
they decide to label the cloverleaf and get rid of the apple that they'd
also put the funky 'option' glyph that shows up in menus on that key.
4. Label placement is inconsistent. Both compared to existing/prior
designs and within itself.
5. Moving the media control keys to share space with function keys that
have a default behavior in a stock OS X install while introducing
higher-numbered function keys that no extant program expects to find and
which don't have overloaded features is brain-dead.

No, Apple has announced no such thing.

It could possibly be real, but right now it's no more credible than

Sure looks an awful lot like the keyboard on a MacBook Pro (slightly
extended) to me.

&lt;seguing slightly&gt;

The one area into which Jobs' vision and RDF has never successfully
penetrated is that relating to keyboards. The original Mac/MacPlus
keyboards were bad, the keyboard on the original iMac was bad, and even
the keyboard on the NeXT Cube was bad. Each computer and its
accompanying software was groundbreaking, but the keyboards should have
been buried deep underground.

For my particular taste, the current Mac keyboard (the one with 16
function keys, etc. that ships with the iMac and MacPro) is one of the
better keyboards I've ever used -- almost as good as the &quot;Saratoga&quot; or
my second favorite, the one on the old IBM Selectric typewriter.

&quot;Hoax&quot; implies deception. I haven't heard anyone stating that this is,
in fact, an Apple keyboard.
Nope, I think it's a simply a mock-up.

I agree with that. One thing I like, compared to many other keyboards
around, is their elegant simplicity. I despise keyboards festooned with
all kinds of &quot;media keys&quot; or &quot;internet keys&quot; or simillar useless
baggage.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; One issue that irks me about recent keyboards is how Apple got away from
&gt; including a power button on the keyboard. It was nice to always know
&gt; where the power button was as I switched from Mac to Mac. Now that some
&gt; of their computers such as the eMacs and recent iMacs have idiotically
&gt; hidden power buttons, I miss those keyboard power buttons even more.
">

While I agree that some of the power buttons are &quot;idiotically hidden&quot;
(I've had to coach several people through finding them - sometimes more
than once for the same person if they use the power switch only rarely),
I sure did not like the power button being on the keyboard. I suppose my
dislike is partially a holdover from experiences with early Macs, when I
had machines unexpectedly power up on me when I was in the process of
moving them (a short enough distance that I didn't feel the need to
unplug them).

My understanding is that there are &quot;issues&quot; with having the power switch
be over a standard USB connection, so going to USB for keyboards
probably necessitated fixing that annoyance/convenience/whichever. I
suspect there are even bigger and fairly obvious issues with the power
switch being on a wireless keyboard.

I don't have the MacBook, but a friend of mine does, and I've had a
chance to use it occasionally. I do have the MacBook Pro.  My friend
says he likes the MB keyboard because it is virtually silent. I like
the MBP keyboard better, because I like the tactile feel of it and find
it a bit more responsive, albeit noisier.  And there's my two cents.  :

Not too familiar with the MBP, but it deviates quite a bit (per point 2

Since you responded to this message, I won't assume that you saw the
continuation I included (and Bob snipped) for the second point.

1. The icon on the forward delete key deviates from what it's been since
that key debuted on the Mac.

I plan on buying one of the upcoming iMacs, but when I do, the keyboard and
mouse will remain in the shipping carton and I'll use 3rd-party gear instead
that designed for function and not style.

BTW, there were a few previous postings claiming this isn't the upcoming

What's wrong with them? I find nothing wrong with the keyboard, and
although the Mighty Mouse could be shaped better, the notion of a small
trackball instead of a wheel is excellent.

So what's yer problem?

Give me a break.  Your question, the one he responded to, was &quot;So you

You asked what he _thinks_, and that's how he answered.  If you had
asked something like &quot;So you know that this is a hoax?&quot; I'm sure he
would have worded his response differently.

Only someone working for Apple could have stated fact, and anyone in a
position to do that would have been under a non-disclosure agreement
that would have prevented him from doing so.  Because of that, all you
can possibly get when you ask questions based on rumor sites is
opinions.

Is this a key that changes from insert to overstrike mode? I would
superglue any such key to prevent its use.

Yes, this looks weird. I though IBM made that error 25 years ago.

Nothing wrong with the wireless keyboard that shipped with this Pro 6

Actually it's YOU that hasn't figured them out. There's this thing call
evolution - read up on it. Apple understands this so watch and learn.

Ah, back to just the command symbol, just like the &quot;good old days.&quot; :)))

About the only Mac application I'm aware of that recognizes the Insert
key on a 3rd party keyboard is Word. Personally, if they're going to
have so many keys doing double-duty that a Fn key is needed, I'm
somewahat pleased that they placed it where the Help key used to be --
I hit that key far too often when striking either delete key,
occasioning a delay while Help launched.

Not quite the same as the chiclet keyboard of the IBM PC Jr -- that has
short, wide keys (kind of like the ones you'd see on HP calculators of
that era). These look and feel just like the ones on my MacBook.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Not true, Apple figured keyboards out a long time ago -- the ADB
extended keyboard commonly called the &quot;Saratoga&quot; was arguably the
finest keyboard on any personal computer. Steve Jobs, on the other hand
and with all due respect for his uncanny knack of getting so many
design decisions so right, has had a history of &quot;blind spots&quot; when it
comes to keyboards (e.g. the original Mac keyboard, the NeXT Cube's
keyboard, and the keyboard that accompanied the hockey puck mouse).

The one I tried ate batteries like an alcoholic consumes booze, but was
okay otherwise.

I'd like to have seen backlighting as a feature (or option?) on the USB
keyboard.
