Hello,

My name is Athena Tellis, and I am currently a rising junior in high
school. I am doing a summer research project to be submitted to an
epidemiology competition. I am requesting that all parents of ASD
children participate in my survey (ALL information that you give me is
kept confidential! And I promise you, this is not a hard survey)
because
I really, truly need responses, and there has been a definitely lack
in
those. If you would take 5-10 minutes, and answer the following
questions, I would appreciate it very, very much! Also, if you know of
any other people who would be willing to answer the questions, if you
could forward the survey to them, that would be fantastic! The survey
is
listed below and all responses should be emailed to
atyesproj ... @yahoo.com. Please answer these questions as thoroughly
and
accurately as you can. When answering about ages, please try to be
specific, such as &quot;five and three months&quot; instead of
&quot;five.&quot; This helps with the data collection and calculations
that I will eventually make. You do not have to write in complete
sentences (bullets, numbered lists are fine). All identifying
information will be removed when I write my report. Thank you very
much
for choosing to participate in my study. Take your time while
answering,
though I would like answers to be emailed back to me as soon as
possible!

Thanks again!

--Athena Tellis

The survey:

1) What has your child been diagnosed with, if he/she has been
diagnosed at all?

2) Before vaccinations, did your child exhibit signs of
neurotypical children (e.g. played with other children, talked
coherently, etc.)?

a. If yes, what were the observations you made (e.g. what did your
child do that was neurotypical)?

3) Have you given your child any vaccines?

a. If yes, what vaccines has your child been given (if known, did
these vaccines have thimerosal in them)? Try to list all vaccines.

b. If yes, when were they given (give child's age)?

4) When did you start realizing that your child was not
neurotypical (give child's age) or did someone else tell you
(teacher, friend, spouse, etc,) with his or her suspicions?

5) What symptoms did you see that made you sense that your child
was not neurotypical?

6) Is there any information (about anything, autism, your child)
that you might want me to include in my study?

7) May I quote you on any of the above answers that you have made?
All identifying information will be removed.

again why kids only

look i get sick and tired of people not taking our views ie adults on the
spectrum

surely if looking at poss mercury links etc one needs to look at all ages of
people and what sort of vaccines they had in those times

but no everyone looks at kids only

please can we have someone doing an all age all sex,all culture all diets
survey then perhgaps we may get the real truth

This was probably a rhetorical question, but I have a  few guesses:

These students don't know that autistics are able to communicate.

These students don't know anything about autism when they start out.
They pick a topic, then start learning about it.

They know that it scares them to think they might have an autistic
child, so they write about it from the NT point of view.

I think this is a misunderstanding caused by ambiguous word use. The
young person conducting the survey did not specify the age of the
children. The adult children of a parent are still children of that parent.

Because the researcher stressed a desire for responses from ALL parents
who have ASD children, I simply assumed she meant the parents of adult
autistics as well.

It makes sense for the researcher to request responses from parents,
because the questions generally relate to infant immunization. Because I
did not want to involve my parents, I simply filled out the survey as
best as I could. Where appropriate, I also offered information regarding
my grandparents who exhibited autistic behaviours both of whom reached
adulthood before thimerosal was ever introduced to vaccines.

If your parents are available to give the detailed information most
desired, I suggest you simply get that information from your parents and
fill out the survey. Otherwise, offer the best information you can offer.

If you have any NT siblings, I suggest submitting surveys for them as
well. The researcher will need control subjects, but right now it
appears she is having difficulty getting any information at all.

Count yourself in. I did. It was easy.

I cannot participate in the survey, since I am not the mother but am the
grandmother of my dear 6 year old child n the spectrum.

However, this young person is in high school.  She is not attempting to set
up a true statistical sample, etc.  She is doing research that will inform
others, and we (I think) benefit from informing the public--young or
old---about autism.

If you qualify and agree that her study might be of benefit in informing
others, please take a few minutes to help her out.  She probably needs as
many responses as possible.

I have forwarded her survey to my son &amp; DIL, and my DIL has some friends
that would qualify to do the survey also.

She no doubt needs responses as soon as possible, as summer terms are coming
to a close shortly.

As an ex-school administrator and teacher, I guess I am sympathetic to a
young person just trying to complete a school project and enter a high
school level competition about current epidemics.

And I really like the fact that she is asking parents these questions rather
getting her material from government or university researchers.

Warmest Regards,

Donna

There is probably a degree of frustration amongst a fair proportion of
autistics about the vaccination &quot;red herring&quot; - Older autistics (like
myself) never *had* the vaccinations which are being blamed. Nor do
large scale studies or those based on countries with different
vaccination regimes, give any support to the idea.

It distracts attention, and consumes time and resources which could be
used developing supports &amp; interventions which are better than those
presently available (and more closely matched to the expressed needs
of autistics, rather than what non-autistics think we &quot;ought&quot; to need
most).

And taken to any length (as some vaccine protesters do), it results in
the *parents* spending time and energy on this pursuit rather than on
their children.

Unfortunately this sort of informal survey is exactly the sort of
thing which is likely to attract &quot;true believers&quot; - and thus lead to
misleading conclusions.

This particular topic is one better suited to large scale university
studies, with a properly representative sample population.

In general, if you want to learn about autism, then ask autistics.
That seems like common sense to me.
