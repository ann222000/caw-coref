Inquiry Stymied on Company With Air Force Ties
By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

If you're a military officer, you can't miss First Command Financial
Planning of Fort Worth.

It sells life insurance and investments to young officers serving around the
world. Many of its executives and most of its agents were officers once
themselves, and they let you know it. A parade of retired generals and
admirals serve on its advisory boards. With more than 300,000 customers,
virtually all of them current or former officers, the company depends on the
military for its very existence.

And in a smaller way the military relies on First Command. The company,
like others in this market, has long sponsored popular events like the
Marine Corps Marathon and the Air Force talent show, Tops in Blue.

So First Command was not happy a year ago when it discovered that a legal
office at Air Force headquarters had put out a notice asking military
lawyers in the field for feedback on &quot;reports of possible unethical or
overly aggressive&quot; sales practices by the company's agents. The notice also
raised questions about the suitability of the company's core product, an
archaic and expensive type of mutual fund with sales fees that eat up half
of an investor's first-year contributions.

First Command fought back: it complained to the second- most-powerful
general in the Air Force. And it was heard.

The New York Times has found that within three weeks of the legal office's
posting, the Air Force issued a retraction, which it had allowed the company
to edit. It gave the company a letter of exoneration, signed by the Air
Force's top legal officer, after letting the company edit that, too. The Air
Force legal staff stopped cooperating with a securities industry
investigation into the company's practices and products. And the Air Force
effectively abandoned a broad inquiry of its own, letting local base
authorities handle complaints.

One complaint was about a First Command agent who had made veiled threats
against a young officer in Charleston, S.C., suggesting he could be
court-martialed or sued for criticizing the company in an e-mail message.

First Command's success in its face-off with Air Force lawyers was a stark
illustration of how a company with strong military connections can influence
the very people who are supposed to monitor its sales activities on bases.

One of those who felt that influence was Thomas L. Farmer, who, from his
Pentagon office, worked on the First Command inquiry for the Judge Advocate
General's Corps, which oversees the administration of justice and ethics for
the Air Force. Mr. Farmer, who was a major at the time but has since left
the service, said that neither the Air Force nor the company has
acknowledged the chilling impact that the episode, especially the
company-edited retraction, has had in the ranks.

&quot;Most JAG officers would take it as an endorsement of First Command,&quot; Mr.
Farmer said of the retraction. &quot;Our being rebuked sends a message out to the
field that 'well, they're not going to be able to help us' when it comes to
this company.&quot; He added, &quot;When we tried to tackle it, First Command could
contact a four-star general and stop us, to the point where First Command is
helping to write official Air Force material.&quot;

Mercer Bullard, president of Fund Democracy, an advocacy group for mutual
fund shareholders' interests, said the episode underscored the danger of
relying on the military to police the sale of financial products on bases.

&quot;The JAG Corps is the most independent, most likely agency in the military
to stand up to these companies,&quot; said Professor Bullard, who teaches law at
the University of Mississippi. &quot;If the JAG Corps can't do it, no one else in
the military will be able to.&quot;

First Command maintains that in appealing to the top ranks of the Air Force,
it was seeking fair treatment, not special treatment.

&quot;What was put in that posting was inaccurate and unfair and harmed our
company,&quot; said Lanny J. Davis, a Washington lawyer and former special
counsel to the Clinton administration who represents the company. &quot;Because
we were concerned with getting a correction quickly, we couldn't afford the
luxury of going up the chain of command to get a remedy. So we went as high
as we could, to get it immediately.&quot;

The company went as high as Gen. T. Michael Moseley, the Air Force vice
chief of staff. An Air Force spokesman, Col. Gary Halbert, said the
general's role was &quot;fairly routine,&quot; intended only to ensure that the
company got a prompt and appropriate response. General Moseley, the colonel
said, did not intend to discourage the Judge Advocate General's Corps from
enforcing the rules that govern the sale of insurance and investments on
military bases.

General Moseley himself said in a written statement: &quot;Fighting and winning
the global war on terrorism and providing support for our airmen are my top
priorities. We have made and will continue to make every effort to protect
our airmen from unscrupulous salespeople and fraudulent products.&quot;

Straight to the Generals

Three events prompted Mr. Farmer's office, the legal assistance and
preventive law division, to send out the notice inquiring about First
Command. The first was an e-mail message in early July 2003 from Vandenberg
Air Force Base in California complaining that some First Command agents were
using a senior officer's name without permission to get clerks to give them
the telephone numbers of officer trainees.

A few weeks later, a brigadier general in the Air National Guard sent Mr.
Farmer's unit a copy of an article from Kiplinger's Personal Finance
magazine that criticized the expensive kind of mutual fund sold by First
Command. Then the office received a request for information from NASD, the
securities industry regulatory group, which had opened an inquiry into First
Command.

The newsletter item, which also told field offices how to forward
complaints to NASD, ran on Aug. 20, 2003, in the Judge Advocate General's
Corps internal electronic newsletter, The On-Line News. And it caught the
attention of the Air Force unit in San Antonio that oversees Tops in Blue,
the touring Air Force talent show. Two days later, the program office asked
First Command about the item. This was apparently the first the company had
heard of it.

A spokesman for the judge advocate general, Lt. Col. Doug Murdock, said the
item should never have gone beyond the JAG Corps. &quot;Unfortunately,&quot; he said,
&quot;the article was interpreted as an indictment of First Command's business
practices.&quot;

Lamar C. Smith, First Command's chairman and chief executive, was quick to
respond. In an electronic memorandum titled &quot;Thoughts,&quot; he acknowledged that
the agent's threatening call to the young officer in Charleston &quot;was an
error and I will apologize for it.&quot; But he also expressed his anger, adding,
&quot;we have a real grievance&quot; against the officer.

&quot;Shall we pursue our own remedies?&quot; Mr. Smith wrote. &quot;If we do it will get
harsh and expensive for the officer in a hurry.&quot;

The memo was sent to the Air Force by a senior vice president, Kurt B.
Anderson, a retired Air Force general. A copy was obtained by The Times, as
were copies of other documents for this article, including e-mail messages
and handwritten notes of telephone conversations. Both the Air Force and
First Command verified the authenticity of the documents.

Mr. Davis, the company's lawyer, said Mr. Smith's &quot;Thoughts&quot; had been
written in the heat of the moment. But he acknowledged that Mr. Smith had
been &quot;upset and frustrated&quot; with the Air Force and conveyed those feelings
to senior officers.

One of them, the company said, was an old friend of Mr. Smith, Gen. Richard
Brown 3rd, now retired, who was the acting assistant vice chief of staff.
Mr. Smith then sent a letter of outrage to General Moseley, who had just
become vice chief of staff. The letter, dated Aug. 28, cited the company's
long support for Tops in Blue, condemned the Kiplinger's article and
complained that the JAG item's author was &quot;inviting others to join his war
on First Command by filing complaints with regulators.&quot;

What the JAG staff should have done, Mr. Smith said, was report the
Vandenberg complaint and any others to First Command.

The company would then have taken &quot;instant and withering&quot; action to
discipline any agent involved, Mr. Smith wrote. He demanded that the JAG
office run a &quot;crystal clear retraction&quot; and advise officers in the field
that the item &quot;should be disregarded.&quot;

The Order Is Retracted

A week later, the company said, another senior First Command executive, Rich
Giles, a former Air Force captain, telephoned General Moseley, whom he had
known for 30 years. And on Sept. 5, Mr. Smith followed up with a second
letter to General Moseley warning that the company faced &quot;the early stages
of a 'wild fire.' ''

Mr. Smith's complaint moved down the chain of command from General Moseley
to the judge advocate general, Thomas J. Fiscus. Two days later, General
Fiscus called a staff member at home and loudly upbraided him for his
staff's handling of the First Command inquiry, notes in the JAG files show.
He cited the letters and calls to General Moseley and warned of possible
litigation.

Colonel Murdock, the JAG spokesman, said the general was &quot;reacting to his
discovery that there were very limited complaints&quot; behind the office's
original inquiry.

The staff was now directed to draft a retraction for the newsletter. But
its language did not satisfy General Anderson, the First Command executive,
who was allowed to edit the item. His version, published almost verbatim on
Sept. 10, 2003, said that &quot;virtually no negative information about First
Command has been received&quot; as a result of the original item.

First Command was allowed to edit the retraction because the Air Force
believed that was appropriate &quot;to resolve the unfair impact&quot; of the item,
Colonel Murdock said.

On Sept. 18, First Command got the letter of exoneration it had demanded.
The letter, too, was edited by the company, Colonel Murdock said. One
change, though small, was significant. The Air Force's draft said the
original item had been prompted by &quot;complaints.&quot; First Command proposed
changing that to &quot;a single complaint.&quot; Lt. Col. Timothy Guiden, Mr. Farmer's
boss, opposed the change, noting that four problems had been reported. He
was overruled, the documents show.

The letter &quot;tried to correct the record for their customers, undo any harm
that had been done and level the playing field,&quot; Colonel Murdock said. But
military documents confirm that complaints continued to arrive, both in
writing and made orally to General Fiscus. (He temporarily stepped down last
week pending the outcome of an unrelated Air Force investigation.) In each
complaint, agents appeared to be trying to use &quot;command influence,&quot; the
power of senior leaders to sway junior officers, on First Command's behalf.

Only the incidents at Vandenberg and Charleston were ever reported to First
Command, the company said. Its only disciplinary response was to counsel the
agent in Charleston, said Mr. Davis, the company's lawyer. The Air Force
said that none of the other complaints had revealed any systemic problem and
that all had been resolved at the local base level. None were passed along
to NASD, either.

&quot;After we got slapped down in such a public manner, continued cooperation
with the NASD was off the table,&quot; Mr. Farmer said.

NASD has nevertheless pursued its inquiry, which has been joined by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and should be concluded soon,
Congressional aides say.

Since The Times first examined First Command's practices in a two-part
series in July, the company has come under scrutiny in Congress. Lawmakers
are considering legislation to abolish the type of mutual funds the company
sells and require the military to coordinate more closely with civilian
regulators.

There was one small coda. In January, First Command notified the Air Force
that it would no longer provide $150,000 a year to sponsor Tops in Blue. The
company said the decision was based on &quot;marketing considerations.&quot; But one
Air Force executive attributed the loss directly to the JAG office's initial
newsletter query about First Command. In an e-mail message to General Fiscus
last Jan. 30, the executive wrote: &quot;This is 'water under the bridge' but
wanted you to know the consequences of the article.&quot;
