I bought an 18 gauge 3 prong grounded electrical cable from Radio
Shack. It's a replacement cable for electrical devices. This is the
North American standard cable. Anyway I want to confirm the color
coded wires before I go ahead and hook the cable up. I'm used to black
being ground and red being hot. But this cable has black (again I
assume this is ground), white, and green. Can someone confirm what
these color codes refer to?

black-hot
white- neutral (often called ground)
green -safety ground -to connect exposed metallic parts such as cases to
ground by an independent lead. Such parts are not part of the normal circuit
and would have no connection to the white or the black-particularly the
latter.  Your computer would have the black and white going to the power
supply while the green would connect to the case.

&gt; Nearly ALL (there are always exceptions) IEC power cords follow the euro
&gt; standard where:

&gt;  Brown (a warm color) is &quot;hot&quot;, and Blue (a cooler color than brown) is
&gt; neutral.  And a green wire with a helical yellow stripe is the fault
&gt; return.

-----------
This is, as specified in the original post, not euro standard unless the US
and Canada have somehow drifted a few miles to the east and nobody told us.

This is funny., Don gave the only response needed.,

Black is Hot = From the Voltage Source goes to red or black equipment
wire.

White is Common = to the other wire.,light colored or white equipment
wire.

Green is Neutral or Earth = to the bare wire or other green wire where
available.
