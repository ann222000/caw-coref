One advantage of using gel is that it is easy to file (reduce the thickness). I do have some clients who prefer ac and I use Entity, which reduces much easier than any other ac I have ever used. I'm not saying there aren't other acs out there that require less work (than most ac) to reduce, but I haven't found one. Hand filing either gel or Entity is a snap! I also do not backfill the white......I use Brisa's white gel polish (super easy to file completely off) to create the tip and it adheres perfectly to the Entity. I encourage you to try both. I use a medium arbor band on my Kupa e-file to prep the product for a fill. Good luck!

Subject: NailTech:: Back fills with hand filing

How long does it take for you to do a back fill using hand filing
technique? I have been so scared of this for years, not getting much
experience, but it seems if I want to keep some clients and continue
to build my clientel, I am going to have to bite the bullet and do
some.
I know it will take me 2 hours to file all that white down thin and
reaply along with doing a fill. I can soak off a set and put a new set
on in that amount of time or less.
Any tricks to help me speed up the process.
I do  have a nail sculptor e-file. It is loud, bulky, and I'm not sure
which bit to use to reduce the white, and i am so scared of hurting
someone with it.
I mostly use it to reduce calluses and clean under nails. I have
several acrylic bits, though. So maybe I'll attempt it, if I knew
which one to use.
Thanks,
Joyce

Thanks Marsha, I was thinking about using the white brush on gel. I
have the Brisa gel line. I bought it over 2 years ago. The brush on
white, was so thick the other day. I used a french smile line sticker
over the nail, to help guide my smile line, then I put her under the
light, When I removed her nail from the light, I removed the sticker,
and the line was not pretty, the white had actually kind of smeared. I
don't know how else to explain it other than the white smile line was
not perfect. I filed it off, and just told her to wait two more weeks,
and I would just do a new set on her. She wants the darker pink powder
on the  nail bed anyway. I so want to be able to re do the whites, so
I'm not soaking sets off every 4 - 6 weeks. Do you think my Brisa
white brush on gel is too old. It was real thick. But I thought it had
always been thick. I have not had good luck with Brisa gel. It peels
off, and cracks real easy. I don't know if it is because I live in
such a humid state. So I no longer offer gel nails. No one can keep
them on for more than three days, nor can I. And I have done them
exactly the way it is taught. I've never taken the class, but I have
the video.
I was looking at some other brands of the paint on white gel, like the
one Vicky Peters has. Do you think I would like that one better?

Joyce...

I recently moved to a new salon and the Brisa they had was doing the same thing because it was way over its shelf life.  I called CND because I couldn't remeber what the numbers on the bottom of the jars stood for, and the rep let me know I should have a jar beginning with the number 6 or ideally 7.  I had jars with 4's on them, so even though the owner bought it at beauty supply only six months ago, it was &quot;expired&quot; at time of purchase.  CND is the only company I know of that has these dates on their gel...am I wrong ladies?

But do not give up on gels!  Take a CND class, get rid of the stickers...you can make a beautiful line with gel easily!  I use both CND and En Vogue gel ( I love their colored gel) and have pretty much stopped doing acrylic.  If you need help, please email me.  Between all the people here on the list and myself, you have a lot of experience to take advantage of.

Good Luck!

Joyce.....I feel your pain ( :&gt;) concerning the gel! Gel is so different, but not impossible to master! Keep at it.....humidity or cold doesn't harm gel.....I live in a cold, wintery State and my Brisa does just fine.....it hasn't always, but with practice and persistance, I navigated that leaning curve......and so will you! Brisa is a fine product, as most are. Don't blame the product. And don't beat yourself up over your failures. Give yourself time to learn and do as many full sets and fills as you can. BTW the Brisa white gel polish is thick, I fought that for quite awhile, till I learned to control it.

I do my own nails and the reason I do is because then I have to live with my work! I can see where I need to improve my application. I have been doing gel polish applications on short nails recently and I'm happy with the results. It is interesting to note that all gel polishes don't require two coats. My Nailite gel polish goes on better than most and usually requires just one coat.

I attended the Sacramento NailPro Show yesterday and attended two gel classes. Luxe, which by the way has a nice pink, I think it's call Princess Pink, which seems to have a little more pink pigment than most, giving a pinker translucent color. I also went to the Gelousy Class. It seems to have a thinner viscosity than Brisa, which I may prefer for doing gel polish applications. I'll order the kit to give it a try.

I also went to Vicki Peters class yesterday. If you ever get the chance to take a class with her....DO SO! She talked alot about gels and there were a number of people in the class with stories like yours. Gels are here to stay......and Vicki advised us to not limit ourselves by refusing to do gels.....or acrylic.......or tips........or sculpting! After the class, I watched her do gel application and her product looks good. I will be trying it this week.

So good luck, Joyce, and get back on the gel bandwagon.
