The Better Complete Works -- Arden, Riverside, or Pelican?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

I was inside Borders and saw the Riverside ($70), Arden ($60), and
Pelican ($30) editions of the Complete Works. Arden and Pelican were
both wrapped, and I couldn't distinguish much of a difference between
my 1974 Riverside and the 1997 edition, other than pictures and notes
on the productions and movies made since 1975.

Which edition is better annotated?
Which edition offers better insight, criticism?
Which edition better preserves, interprets, edits text?
Has Riverside done any 180s since the first printing?
Or does cheapest book win?

Thanks, I'll take your comments off the air (oops, wrong medium).

I'll take majority poll results.

I suggest you get the First Folio of 1623. Other versions, the
Riverside, Arden, etc., have been edited. The 'Folio' is the original.

You mean uncut, unBowdlerized, Authorized? But surely the FF was
edited by at least one, possibly more. Then the 1623 edition was
improved and, I think, the 1640 edition added a couple plays, didn't
it? Hope we don't have to fight textual battles on that old turf.

I like my 1974 Riverside because of Levin's introductions, extensive
appendices, unobtrusive notes, the plates are good, to which I have
added labels, paper quality and print format okay, and because I got a
clean, hardback copy at a thrift shop for $3.50. bookburn

Any editing done in the First Folio of 1623 was done by, or under the
direction of Henry Condell and Jiohn Heminge, who were with
Shakespeare as Shareholding members of the King's Men and the Globe
and Blackfriars Theatre. They knew the author, can the editors of the
other versions say the same? No!

Any number of chessplayers know me. However, I'd sooner drink Drano than let
any of them edit my articles. Shakespeare probably had little to do with
editorial choices made in the first folio, although I believe John Berryman
was correct in speculating that The Tempest is the first play in the Folio
because Shakespeare wanted it first.

Your arguments in favor of &quot;Historically Informed Performance&quot; in
Shakespeare run into the same problems that HIP performances in music run
into. We are not the audience of either Shakespeare's or Bach's time, and
attempted recreations of period performance run into all sorts of problems
and compromises. For instance, do you have boys playing female roles in your
acting company?

we have women playing women, women playing men, and have been known to
use men in womens roles.
I don't know about you, but I prefer to have my text as original as
possible, and do my own editing, rather than rely on someone else.
one inexcusable example is what editors do to Mercutio's 'Queene Mab'
speech. Compare the Folio version with any of the edited versions. All
the ones I've seen take a speech that is mostly in prose, and change
it to complete verse. Of course this requires substitution of words,
and drastic changes of punctuation. They all take out from &quot;the lash
of Philome&quot;, making it in several versions, &quot;the lash of film&quot;. Look
up Philome sometime, and you might be very surprised.

Here are two versions of the Queene Mab speech, the first is from the
Oxford website version of Romeo and Juliet. the second is the same
speech from the First Folio of 1623.

Mer. O! then, I see, Queen Mab hath been with you.
Ben. Queen Mab! What&amp;#8217;s she?
Mer. She is the fairies&amp;#8217; midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men&amp;#8217;s noses as they lie asleep:
Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners&amp;#8217; legs;
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
The traces, of the smallest spider&amp;#8217;s web;
The collars, of the moonshine&amp;#8217;s watery beams;
Her whip, of cricket&amp;#8217;s bone; the lash, of film;
Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
Not half so big as a round little worm
Prick&amp;#8217;d from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o&amp;#8217; mind the fairies&amp;#8217; coach-makers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers&amp;#8217; brains, and then they dream of love;
O&amp;#8217;er courtiers&amp;#8217; knees, that dream on curtsies straight;
O&amp;#8217;er lawyers&amp;#8217; fingers, who straight dream on fees;
O&amp;#8217;er ladies&amp;#8217; lips, who straight on kisses dream;
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
Sometimes she gallops o&amp;#8217;er a courtier&amp;#8217;s nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometimes comes she with a tithe-pig&amp;#8217;s tail,
Tickling a parson&amp;#8217;s nose as a&amp;#8217; lies asleep,
Then dreams he of another benefice;
Sometime she driveth o&amp;#8217;er a soldier&amp;#8217;s neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night;
And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes;
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
That presses them and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she&amp;#8212;

Mer. O then I see Queene Mab hath beene with you:
She is the Fairies Midwife, &amp; she comes in shape no bigger
then Agat-stone, on the fore-finger of an Alderman,
drawne with a teeme of little Atomies, ouer mens noses as
they lie asleepe: her Waggon Spokes made of long Spinners
legs: the Couer of the wings of Grashoppers, her
Traces of the smallest Spiders web, her coullers of the
Moonshines watry Beames, her Whip of Crickets bone,
the Lash of Philome, her Waggoner, a small gray-coated
Gnat, not halfe so bigge as a round little Worme, prickt
from the Lazie-finger of a man. Her Chariot is an emptie
Haselnut, made by the Ioyner Squirrel or old Grub, time
out a mind, the Faries Coach-makers: &amp; in this state she
gallops night by night, through Louers braines: and then
they dreame of Loue. On Courtiers knees, that dreame on
Cursies strait: ore Lawyers fingers, who strait dreampt on
Fees, ore Ladies lips, who strait on kisses dreame, which
oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, because their
breath with Sweet meats tainted are. Sometime she gallops
ore a Courtiers nose, &amp; then dreames he of smelling
out a sute: &amp; somtime comes she with Tith pigs tale, tickling
a Parsons nose as a lies asleepe, then he dreames of
another Benefice. Sometime she driueth ore a Souldiers
necke, &amp; then dreames he of cutting Forraine throats, of
Breaches, Ambuscados, Spanish Blades: Of Healths fiue
Fadome deepe, and then anon drums in his eares, at which
he startes and wakes; and being thus frighted, sweares a
prayer or two &amp; sleepes againe: this is that very Mab that
plats the manes of Horses in the night: &amp; bakes the Elklocks
in foule sluttish haires, which once vntangled, much
misfortune bodes,
This is the hag, when Maides lie on their backs,
That presses them, and learnes them first to beare,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she

Notice that the first version is all in verse, the second mostly in
prose. Also as I stated, the first version has &quot;the lash, of film&quot;.
The second version has &quot;the lash of Philome&quot;. Need I say more?

John is perfectly correct about your tin ear. The passage is in verse: to
print it as prose is therefore a mistake, one rather common in Elizabethan
printing houses.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I prefer to have my text as original as

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one inexcusable example is what editors do to Mercutio's 'Queene
Mab'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; speech. Compare the Folio version with any of the edited versions.
All
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the ones I've seen take a speech that is mostly in prose, and change
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it to complete verse. Of course this requires substitution of words,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and drastic changes of punctuation. They all take out from &quot;the lash
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Philome&quot;, making it in several versions, &quot;the lash of film&quot;. Look
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up Philome sometime, and you might be very surprised.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Try learning the basics of your subject before pontificating on it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In the spirit of that criticism, I will leave it as an exercise for
you
&gt;&gt;&gt; to discover just why the above proves that you have not yet earned the
&gt;&gt;&gt; right to have an opinion; the necessary information is available on
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; web. (Your tin ear, I'm afraid, cannot be helped.)

&gt;&gt; Here are two versions of the Queene Mab speech, the first is from the
&gt;&gt; Oxford website version of Romeo and Juliet. the second is the same
&gt;&gt; speech from the First Folio of 1623.

&gt;&gt; Mer. O! then, I see, Queen Mab hath been with you.
&gt;&gt; Ben. Queen Mab! What&amp;#8217;s she?
&gt;&gt; Mer. She is the fairies&amp;#8217; midwife, and she comes
&gt;&gt; In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
&gt;&gt; On the fore-finger of an alderman,

&gt;&gt; Athwart men&amp;#8217;s noses as they lie asleep:

Peter, I agree too. This is so obviously verse. Apart from the fact it has
rhythm and meter, the language itself is poetic, has poetic reversals (such
as &quot;and then dreams he&quot;) and looks as though it were written in a particular
way to fit the pentameter. It also makes no sense that part but not all of
it would be prose, as in the second version. It's one of my favourite
Shakespearean speeches, and I remember being enchanted by it when I was
twelve, partly because it *lilts.*

Best wishes,

Nice try. Now do some _real_ research.
