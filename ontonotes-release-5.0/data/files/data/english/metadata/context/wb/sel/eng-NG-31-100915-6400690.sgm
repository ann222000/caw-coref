The Amber Feeling

The white lines sped by faster and faster. Looking ahead Jeff could see the well
lit highway stretching for miles. The jeep wagoneer plowed through the thin,
cold air, it's body trembling as it steadily progressed closer to its
destination. It was around 1AM when his headlights first reflected off the
College Park sign, and Jeff relaxed knowing that soon he would be with Peter. He
had been thinking about Peter all day. Sitting in class had been torture. He
ached with longing to wrap himself around Peter. He desperately desired him.
Peter had occupied his thoughts completely leaving no room for responsibilities
that Jeff knew he had. Only one thing was important, to satisfy himself and to
make Peter love him.

Leaving New York City about four hours earlier, Jeff stopped at Ray's Pizza on
11th Street and 6th Avenue. Keeping an eye on his car, he rushed into the
crowded pizza parlor and ordered 2 pies. His body trembled and he couldn't sit
still. Jeff was thinking about how irresponsible he was being, blowing off his
work for the weekend and driving down to Philadelphia. Sure he had two papers to
write and a lot of reading to do. Jeff wanted to see Peter, however, and the
desire to get high and make love overpowered his sense of responsibility. The
pies came. Securing the boxes on the front seat, the intense smell of pizza
quickly filled the car and fogged the windows. Luckily Jeff had bought a slice
on the side, and as Jeff began to drive away, Jeff attempted to eat it while
driving with one hand. Jeff held a can of coke between his thighs, with a straw
protruding through the top. The constant thoughts of Peter had long since worked
their effects into Jeff's groin. His never ending hard on ached with such
intensity that it was all he could do to stay on the road. The cold from the can
of coke pressing against his inner thighs helped to reduce his aching membrane
to something tolerable, but all he could think about was releasing the pressure
in the innards of Peter's body.

The miles continued to speed by. Every so often the blip from his radar detector
would cause him to involuntarily ease off the accelerator, only to floor it
again within a few minutes. The miles passed into the void of blackness that
enveloped the road.

The exit quickly approached. As Jeff slowed to take the curve, he recognized the
gas station across the road. Jeff had stopped there with Peter once to fill up
his car. His heart began to beat faster as he drove the last few miles to
campus. Everything was familiar now. Jeff had been there only about 3 times
before, but he only felt really good about himself when he was with Peter, and
so he had memorized everything about Peter's environment. There was dip in the
road just after the McDonalds, and his trucks' springs squeaked, telling him to
slow down. The pressure in his groin had built up to a high again, and Jeff only
responded by speeding up.

In a matter of seconds Jeff came to a curve and a red light. "Fuck it," Jeff
thought as he sped through it. It was 1:30AM, the area was deserted, and no
one was going to stop Jeff now. Jeff was on a roll. Within moments he rolled
up to Denton Hall, where Peter lived, and parked directly in front. Denton was
a red brick building, about 9 stories tall, situated next to a large open
parking lot with many tall lamp posts at even intervals. It was a cold and
damp night. There was a moist fog in the air, and the bright flood lights from
the parking lot cast eerie shadows and streaks of light through the wet air.
The moist air mingled with Jeff's cold sweat and formed a sweet acrid smell,
which excited Jeff.

Inside the large lobby Jeff felt comfortable. The pizza's he had bought in New
York City were still warm, and he rushed to the elevators, quickly pressing the
fourth floor button. On the fourth floor, Jeff turned left, passed through a set
of doors and going around the corner he came quickly to Peter's door. Standing
in front of the door, Jeff knocked loudly and opened the door, announcing "Pizza
Delivery!", as he entered.

Peter looked up from his couch. "Holy Shit," he exclaimed leaping up in
surprise. "What the fuck are you doing here?"

Jeff told him to forget about school for the weekend, and that he was here to
enjoy and help relieve some tension.

"I can't believe you're here," he told Jeff. "I've missed you so much!" Jeff
couldn't help glancing down at Peter's cock. He could see that it was beginning
to get hard, and he wanted so desperately to chuck the pizza's on the floor,
grab Peter, strip him naked, and make passionate love to him all night long.

Glancing around the room, Jeff saw that it was rectangular, about 12 feet by 18
feet. There were two beds balanced on dressers that were about 5 feet high. The
beds were at 90 degree angles to each other and fit snugly into the far corner
of the room.

By now Peter had also seen the bulge in Jeff's pants.
