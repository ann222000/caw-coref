&gt; &gt; Marbury calls dogfighting a sport

&gt; &gt; New York Knicks guard Stephon Marbury defended Michael Vick, calling
&gt; &gt; dogfighting a sport and comparing it to hunting. Marbury spoke Monday
&gt; &gt; about the federal dogfighting conspiracy charges against Vick while
&gt; &gt; promoting his basketball shoe in Albany, N.Y.

&gt; &gt; &quot;I think it's tough,&quot; Marbury said, according to Albany TV station
&gt; &gt; Capital News 9. &quot;I think, you know, we don't say anything about people
&gt; &gt; who shoot deer or shoot other animals. You know, from what I hear,
&gt; &gt; dogfighting is a sport. It's just behind closed doors.&quot;

&gt; I'm not much for pumping lead into Bambi, myself, but let's compare:
&gt; Point of hunting: pursuit with clean kills; using what you kill;
&gt; legal.
&gt; Point of dogfighting: pain, cruelty and mutilation purely for the
&gt; spectacle of it; illegal.
">

I think there's no difference between recreational hunting and
dogfighting.
I think the only difference and the reason why people are forming
lynch
mobs about Vick and others is because what type of person happens to
be a typical hunter compared to what type of person happens to attend
the average dogfight.

&gt; &gt; situation.&quot;

I hate that these conversations disintegrate to a discussion of race.
Race is a VERY convenient card to play...unfortunately it doesn't apply
here because there is absolutely no similarity in the two examples.

There is no race aspect.  Hunting is legal.  Dog fighting is illegal.
Period.

Heh heh, good ol' racism argument.

So I guess you also don't see a difference with killing a cow to make
steak and dog fighting, and no difference with killing a chicken to
eat chicken wings and dog fighting.

Nevermind that Vick admitted to throw dogs at walls to &quot;finish it
off&quot;, electricute the ones that lost, steal dogs from neighbors (how
cheap can this millionaire be?) for breeding purpose, drown them for
laughs, starve them 3-4 days so they are &quot;hunger when in the ring&quot;,
and mutilate the dogs for personal amusement.

but nope, it must be racism.

Wrong smacdo, it worked before and it will work again.  Double murder

stupidity which I snipped.....

The differences are:

Hunting is legal, dog fighting is illegal

Wild Game are sources of food in this country, dogs are not.

Dogs have been domesticated and trust man.  Deer, elk, pheasant, dove,
ducks etc do not trust man.

You can get a license to hunt game.  You cannot get a license to
sponsor or participate in dog fighting.

And the biggest point to all this is the sadistic manner in which
animals were executed.  They were not hunted or shot in the head, but
drowned, electrocuted, smashed repeatedly in the ground etc.  All of
this behavior is typical of a pyscopathic killer according to any
criminal psycologist.  Hunting, is not.

If you can't understand all of this, you shouldn't be allowed to voice
an opinion because you are either pathologically dishonest, or
pathetically too stupid to do so.  You can choose.

Yes, but if you randomly got shot in the head while walking down the
street.. i doubt there are more thugs down on the corner placing huge bets
on how much you bleed before you die.

Lets not forget that this isn't just a cruelty to animals issue.  Although,
that part of the story is sick enough.  This was also a huge illegal
gambling operation.

&gt;&gt; I think the only difference and the reason why people are forming

&gt;&gt; be a typical hunter compared to what type of person happens to attend
&gt;&gt; the average dogfight.

&gt; I hate that these conversations disintegrate to a discussion of race. Race
&gt; is a VERY convenient card to play...unfortunately it doesn't apply here
&gt; because there is absolutely no similarity in the two examples.

&gt; There is no race aspect.  Hunting is legal.  Dog fighting is illegal.
&gt; Period.

Who brought up race?

Why is it when a white guy gets arrested for a heiness crime, nobody ever
complains that the authorities are picking on the white community?  When a
black man gets arrested for a similar crime, its profiling.  Breaking the
law isn't a white or black issue.  The laws are the same for all races in
the US.  The color of Michael Vick's skin makes no difference in this case.
He knew he was breaking the law, the problems only started after he got
caught!

I'm eating it) and I REALLY dont see the big deal about this Vick

every day and they dont get a percentile of the attention the Vick
story is getting... There are so many bigger, more important problems

animals for ANY reason... Period...

If you eat meat, poultry or fish and make that argument then it is
illogical.  If you don't, then you are true to your word.  I just
disagree with it because dogs that are electrocuted and drowned
because they won't fight to the death effectively is not the same as
shooting a deer for food.  Shooting an animal and eating it is the
same as shopping for a steak at Vons.

The Vick story is getting the attention because he is the 2nd highest

It's funny, I tried to make the distinction last week or so between
something being morally wrong vs. wrong because it's illegal.

But apparently, it seems a lot of people think along the lines of the
illegality of something is what MAKES it morally wrong.

As if it would hurt the dogs less somehow if it were legal.

&gt; every day and they dont get a percentile of the attention the Vick
&gt; story is getting... There are so many bigger, more important problems

&gt; Now where's my steak!!!

i disagree with that.  i don't think every instance of killing animals
is necessarily the same.  not ever case of killing people is the same
either.  some things are definitely more justifiable than others.

i think that in the vick case, the dogfighting part doesn't bother me
nearly as much as the torture part.

somebody somewhere else in the thread also said people shouldn't forget
that he's guilty of running an illegal gambling ring, but fuck that, i
like gambling.

in fairness, the humans can definitley lose in bullfighting, so i do see

and i'm not saying that's the right way to think about it, that's just

First of all the bad dancing/vertical leap shit would be stereotyping, not

&gt;&gt;&gt; But it's okay to shoot and kill a defenseless deer in the head with
&gt;&gt;&gt; a shotgun???

&gt;&gt; To eat, yes.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah that's not cruel...

&gt;&gt; You should pay a visit to the slaughter house on cows, pigs, and
&gt;&gt; chickens.

&gt;&gt; So are you a vegetarian?

&gt; Oh god no... Like Tony Soprano, I eat beef and sausage by the pound
&gt; every day... I dont give a damn about any animals (if they taste good,
&gt; I'm eating it) and I REALLY dont see the big deal about this Vick
&gt; story... Yeah it's fucked up but fucked up things happen to PEOPLE
&gt; every day and they dont get a percentile of the attention the Vick
&gt; story is getting... There are so many bigger, more important problems
&gt; in the world that need to be dealt with than fuckin dogfighting...

&gt; And if you dont condone dogfighting BECAUSE the people involved are
&gt; cruel to animals then you shouldn't condone hunting, or killing any
&gt; animals for ANY reason... Period...
">

That you do not see a difference between killing a meat animal quickly and
cruelty for its own sake does not mean there is not one.  It is not just
that they are dogs, if the greyhound racers can not find homes for a slow
dog and have it killed by a vet that is different from getting your jollies
torturing an animal.  And having dogs try to kill each other by ripping
themselves apart over sometimes several hours as amusement is a different
kettle of fish to hunting your own meat too.

According to the Humane society cockfighting is illegal in all 50
states, felony in 35, and misdemeanor in 15.  Where did you get your

&gt; &gt; So based on that reasoning why is cockfighting legal in many states?

&gt; &gt; Because chickens are dumb and dogs are too cool for school?

&gt; probably.  i also don't know that i'd completely disagree with that line
&gt; of reasoning, even if that's not how i'd word it.  i think people
&gt; generally get queasier about killing things as those things get closer
&gt; to their level of brain power.- Hide quoted text -

Brain power is part of it. Still, outside of a few circles you
wouldn't get as many people outraged about... say... eating monkeys as
dogfighting. I would argue that dogs have more legal standing because
their close companionship with humans is unique amongst the animals in
western culture. There is a line of thinking that is fairly strong in
western civilization that reasons cruelty towards animals is a step
removed towards cruelty towards people. While many believe that
cruelty towards animals in itself is a wrong many more believe the
former. This animal that is in such close proximity to people gets
more widespread concern.

With wild animals the laws have been drawn up in a totally different
manner. These laws are drawn up more in terms of managing populations
and protecting at risk species. Whaling, for example, is illegal in
most of the international community mostly because of the rarity of
whales (and their migration patterns make them a global species). Even
with deer... whose populations are out of control in most of the
country you cannot hunt them out of season and even in season you must
have a lisence to do so.

Fair or not, thems the laws and them has been the laws for a long time
and they certainly weren't drawn up in some sort of clever plot to
bring down Michael Vick.

In the case of Vick there's a fellow in another group I post in who is
convinced that someone from the feds has been infiltrating Vick's
group for some time now... and I don't think that's too far off. I.e.
they had waaaay more on either Vick or the guys that he is running
with in terms of the gambling but what he is actually getting punished
for is the dogfighting. In the public eye he has been destroyed but
methinks he would have been up against much more time, hence the
plea...

&gt;&gt; &gt; Marbury calls dogfighting a sport

&gt;&gt; &gt; New York Knicks guard Stephon Marbury defended Michael Vick, calling
&gt;&gt; &gt; dogfighting a sport and comparing it to hunting. Marbury spoke Monday
&gt;&gt; &gt; about the federal dogfighting conspiracy charges against Vick while
&gt;&gt; &gt; promoting his basketball shoe in Albany, N.Y.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I think it's tough,&quot; Marbury said, according to Albany TV station
&gt;&gt; &gt; Capital News 9. &quot;I think, you know, we don't say anything about people
&gt;&gt; &gt; who shoot deer or shoot other animals. You know, from what I hear,
&gt;&gt; &gt; dogfighting is a sport. It's just behind closed doors.&quot;

&gt;&gt; I'm not much for pumping lead into Bambi, myself, but let's compare:
&gt;&gt; Point of hunting: pursuit with clean kills; using what you kill;
&gt;&gt; legal.
&gt;&gt; Point of dogfighting: pain, cruelty and mutilation purely for the
&gt;&gt; spectacle of it; illegal.

&gt; I think there's no difference between recreational hunting and
&gt; dogfighting.
&gt; I think the only difference and the reason why people are forming
&gt; lynch
&gt; mobs about Vick and others is because what type of person happens to
&gt; be a typical hunter compared to what type of person happens to attend
&gt; the average dogfight.
">

And you, of course, are wrong. Hunting is an activity as old as
mankind---and eating what one kills is not cruel. Cruel is eating a
hamburger made from a cow which lived its life on a factory farm, pumped
full of antibiotics, living in it's own waste, only to meet its end by being
clumsily killed by a minimum wage earning slaughterhous worker.

Bullfighting is illegal in the US. Canned hunts are illegal most places,
too. Try again.

p.s.---sometimes the bull kills the matador.
