Back in February 2002, I posted this experience. I post it again
today in honor of the man that it is about.
The Ranger
=====
It all started out at Castle Ranger. I had loaded...

...the daughter-units into the Blue Bullet without any minor (or
major) protests usually associated with a late-afternoon trip to
any store, let alone the grocery store. We were going to hit one
of my regular haunts since Ol' Man Hubbard forgot to stock his
cupboard and there was no food to be had.

This particular supermarket is enjoyable to shop in for some very
selfish reasons: 1) During the late-afternoon hours, and before
dinner, they tend to be rather lacking in foot traffic. 2) This
net result allows the staff to be energetic and helpful if
questions arise and 3) the quality of this supermarket's produce
is excellent while the prices are no more expensive than either
major chain that shall remain nameless. These make for some very
pleasant reasons to keep returning.

During the trip down the expressway, all three daughter-units
didn't fight, scream, or cry. There were no "looking-looks" and no
"touching-touches."

Each girl-unit played quietly with their dolls. I pulled into the
store's lot and parked -- right in front of the entrance! The Good
Omens(sm) were just piling on top of each other.

We spilled out of the Blue Bullet and onto the walkway where the
carts are stored. Spawn, as is expected of her, protested her
placement in the cart's seat. Her displeasure was duly noted (as
noted in "Raising Children With Attitudinal Positions," chapter 7,
page 175, section XIV, paragraph nine, sentences 1-9 clearly
state) and documented. I then tabled the issue for future
discussion in a session of congress. Pack order and placement
established we proceeded on into the produce area.

As I said, the produce in this store is amazing. The selections
are varied and there are items sold that I normally don't see at
other stores. One selection we passed Daughter-unit Alpha noticed;
purple potatoes. She picked one up and asked me a series of
questions. I had answers to none of them. I was in the process of
having her put the lone spud back when the dept. manager walked
over. Dm is always in this area, always talking to people, and
always well informed on every little item. Purple potatoes were no
exception. Alpha and I listened as he talked, and answered each
question she fired at him. We could have walked out with diplomas
in Potato-ology. I had asked about another item, and Dm was
telling me about preferred methods of cooking them when we both
heard, "Wow... Are you three sisters?"

Alpha, always chatty, answered, "Yes.
That'smysister.Andthat'smysister.Andthat'smydaddy."

"Oh, man. Mr. Mom and triple trouble."

Every hackle on my neck feathered upwards. I didn't have time for
this today. I needed to get in and out of the store quickly and
tackling Cro-Magnons was not part of the plan.

I touched Alpha, "Time to go," and I looked up at the meathead,
"Say good-bye." Alpha smiled and said good-bye and came back to
the cart.

"I'm glad it's not me with three girls."

I whipped around and had multiple answers ready but heard,
"Amazing."

I stopped and the two of us looked over at Dm. He had returned to
his produce cart and was trimming tops off and setting up a new
display. He was holding up and examining a turnip. "Amazing."

Cro-Magnon carped for a second, thought of something, carped some
more, and then left. Dm put the turnip into the display. "Simply
amazing..." He turned around and was watching me watch where
jug-head was headed. I was envisioning ways to reacquaint
ourselves should Opportunity present itself... "Not worth it. Let
it go."

Agitated still, I scowled then quickly smiled, "That obvious?"

"Yeah. Did you have any other questions?"

The girl-units helped me fill the cart with something from every
display (or so it seemed.) We were going to feast for the next
week! I headed off to the butcher counter. Alpha and Beta were
asking questions about the different items in our basket, Spawn
was sitting quietly, head on the handle bar, as I reached for and
took a number to be waited on. Since the girls were being very
well behaved, I walked back to where the Pudding and Jell-O(tm)
display was. "You can each pick /one/ flavor." Spawn immediately
chose her favorite, while Alpha and Beta negotiated who would pick
chocolate, chocolate fudge, and a chocolate and chocolate fudge
swirl. I left them to get down to brass tacks and started to
mentally tick off what meats we needed for the coming week.

"Twins?"

"Huh? Whuh? Uh... Yes. They are." I mentally shifted gears slowly
and came around sluggishly.

"Lucky you!"

I stared at the new face. The eyes -- a contrast of pale and
bright blue -- that I fixed on showed openness, sincerity, which
in turn created a relaxing calm. I looked beyond the eyes at the
face. Wrinkles were etched deeply, care lines and crow's feet
stretched into dimples. Bushy brows reached into the close-cropped
wreath of cotton-white hair that circled his head like Zeus' olive
branch. He was only slightly taller than me but much thinner. He
was wearing a Hawaiian print (Magnumesque) and Birkenstocks. He
was smiling, finding humor in my silence. The previous feelings
that my last encounter had brought forth disappeared. I mentally
guessed him to be 60 to 65.

"Yes. Yes, you're right. I am very lucky," I started.

"All girls, too. Three times blessed," and he touched Spawn and
gently patted her head. She didn't move away but smiled. I didn't
reach out to block the move. I stood there, mesmerized. He
continued, "I have five daughters."

"Dad. Mom sent us out for milk and yogurt." The young woman's
voice cut his reverie short.

He sighed heavily. "My youngest," he offered. "She's getting
married tomorrow."

"Dad... Come on." I looked over at her; she had turned a bright
purple-red, from her neck to the tips of her hair.

He ignored her pleading and continued. "Yep. The last of five."
There was an unspoken joke that caused her to smile and reach for
his arm. "We can spend a couple minutes..."

"Two. Then we have to go."

The Grey Fox smiled toothily. "Two it is," he smacked his palms
together. I was openly enjoying the give-and-take between the two.
"Yep. Her mother gets antsy when I start yappin' at total
strangers. Name's Bud. No sense bein' strangers any longer." His
hand snapped out and I found the grip firmer than many a younger
man. His daughter rolled her eyes. Alpha and Beta had come back
over with their choice of puddings (both had picked the same type)
and started talking to the daughter. Instead of shock and dismay,
I found myself smiling like some country bumpkin, bobbing my head
in agreement to my own magical music. His daughter and my
daughter-units hit it off immediately; the four sat down on the
floor and started chatting back and forth, the younger girl-units
skipping through sentence and grammar structures without meaning
while the older was able to glean simple information without
hesitation or effort.

The Grey Fox beamed and continued, "Yeah. I noticed you were going
after that meathead back there. It never ceases to amaze me... I
raised five girls in a different time and received almost the
exact same banal static. I'd've hoped we'd advanced by now but
obviously there are still some throwbacks..."

The cadence, the sing-song back and forth of his words, invited
like conversation. I found myself thinking I'd known this man for
20 years instead of the actual 20 seconds. He talked and talked,
sharing stories of raising five daughters, seeing them all through
college, moved out and married. He talked about some of the biases
he'd encountered and how he'd handled them. He talked, and we
shared similarities, for TWO hours -- 125 minutes! My watch's beep
brought me back to Real Life®.

"Oh..." I groaned. "SHE's is gonna kill me."

"What time is it?" his daughter queried me. I showed her. "Mom's
gonna kill US! You know she's not going to be happy when we get
back... We were only to get 'milk and yogurt.' A thirty minute
round-trip, Dad."

"She knows," Grey Fox smiled. "You got a special group here,
[The], you know that?"

"Yes, sir. I do."

"Enjoy 'em while you can. They'll be married and moved out before
you really know what you've got. I know. I had my time and it
wasn't nearly long enough."

I didn't say anything. I knew, for some reason, that it didn't
require anything more.

"Dad. Let's go..." His daughter steered him back into the current
and they were quickly gone.

"Who were they? Do we know them?" Alpha asked.

"We didn't but we know 'em now, don't we?"

Great story thanks for posting it.  In 1981 the ex and I went to Lima, Peru
to adopt a 6 year old boy.  I cannot tell you how many times upon my return
I ran into the "meathead", both male &amp; female, when I would be out shopping
with the kid.  Just because I had gray hair, blue eyes &amp; was caucasian,
didn't mean that my kid was not my kid, even though he was dark brown, had
black eyes &amp; black hair!

My Sainted Mother(tm) was never one to let another's learning
opportunity go by. She often countered doltish thoughtlessness
with, "I heard the words but I can't imagine you meant them the
way they came out. Do try and think about the next so you don't
look anymore foolish than you currently are."

Her 5'0", 95 lb frame was more intimidating than many larger men.

Don't worry about it. Every twenty years there is a paradigm shift in
