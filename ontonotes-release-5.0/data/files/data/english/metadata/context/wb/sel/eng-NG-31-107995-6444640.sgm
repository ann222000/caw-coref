Hi, all

I'm going to be buying one of the HF 'mini-mills' in the near future and I'm
considering casting a concrete base for it (as opposed to building a wood
bench).
I'm thinking of something like a flat-topped obelisk with a hollow core,
reinforced with rebar and mesh. Anyone ever done this?

I thought about welding up a bench, but getting it in the basement would be
a nightmare.

First off let me suggest that this is shooting from the hip and not from a
personal experience or an engineering analysis, but I would not waste the
effort on a HF cheapie.  These machines have problems that bolting to a
concrete are not going to fix.  I would bolt it to the table and learn it's
limitations and then machine within them.

Roger-

I'm not picking on you personaly, but this is the reason I don't bother with
RCM very often.

You admit upfront that you have zero experience with these machines, and yet
you freely criticize them.

FWIW,  the bulk of the work I'll be doing will be such that a Sherline is
too small and a Bridgeport is overkill. Even is someone gave me a
Bridgeport, it would cost a ton to get it into my basement and make it
operational. My friend has a full size mill if I need one. Despite what you
hear one this NG, there are a lot of folks out there who do nice work with
the HF mill.

Sounds like getting it *out* of your basement might be really hard if you
ever had to move the mill. How much do you figure it would weigh?

That seems like a lot of work to me, but then again maybe you're more
comfortable than I am working with that stuff. I'd just weld up a heavy
table, as strong as it needs to be. I used to build Navy ships and every
machine on the whole ship is mounted onto a welded steel base.

Well, you know, there's a considerable body of shared experience with HF
equipment on this group. You don't have to have bought every piece of the
stuff they sell to have a pretty good idea of what to expect.

Don't get your thong all knotted up. You came here to ask a question. You
got one answer. Bank it up against other opinions you hear here, bounce it
off the experience of all the other experienced machinists that you happen
to know personally, and make up your own mind. But don't go all finger up

And of course I mean that in the nicest possible way.

I like the idea of a concrete base- it would be stiffer than wood and
quieter than steel. I've seen it done for telescope mounts.

I'd love to weld up a bench, but unless I did it in place (not gonna

a job and a half.

I've never had a thing to do with H.F. machines but as a general rule
setting machine tools involves mounting them on some surface that is
completely stationary. Once the machine is mounted it is "leveled",
i.e. adjusted by shimming, or otherwise moving the mounting feet,
until the ways are parallel over their entire length. This is usually
checked by use of a precision level, thus the term "leveled".

Ensuring that the ways, the surfaces that the various parts of the
machine move on, are parallel and/or at right angles ensures that the
machine will be as accurate as possible, always considering the in
built accuracy of the machine itself.

I was not trying to suggest that you can't do accepable work on the small
mill, I was suggesting that the machine bolted to concrete is not going to
be much better than the machine bolted to a sturdy woden bench.

While I have not used HF made in China machines, I have used small scale
machine tools and you need a different technique with the less rigid
machines than with the solid machines.  The lighter machines you need to
make lighter cuts and sneak up on critical measurments as the machine flexes
mor under a heavy cut than it does with a light cut

Yup... done it.  My 6" Atlas is on a "honeycomb" concrete table top on a
roll-around wooden cart.  It's not _always_ dead-level (although I trim it
up for close work), but it's always "true" front-to-back and end-to-end.

It's not exactly convenient; the table-top weighs about 120lb -- more than
the lathe.  But it really has served me well over the thirty years it's been
set up like that -- not a sign of any warp, and probably none will ever
occur.

Bill,
HF is a seller of bottom price-point tools. While they provide
(usually) decent value for the buck, they are what they are.

Spend the $40 or whatever HF wants for the steel stand and be done
with it, it'll work just fine, and you won't be here later asking how to
fit a 38 inch concrete plinth out through a 36 inch door.

You new to usenet? You seen a little quick to get wound up. Best not
to, as the thrashing attracts the sharks...:-)

The advise was good, as far as I am concerned.

Great idea.  It addresses one other aspect of mounting machine tools -
combined weight of tool and mount also contributes to rigidity.  If there is
any possible way to get a mill-drill down to his basement, Carl should
consider pouring the round column full of concrete.

Weighting down the bench is a time honored tradition for light machines. Many
wood lathe users just drape sand bags over the cross pieces of the lathe
stands.

I have a Shoptask 3-in-1 and have made the bench as heavy as practical by
adding shelves to store accessories. It helps cut down vibrations in my
opinion.

I think a concrete bench would cut out a lot of the 'buzzing' that can plauge a
light machine.

At what point did you think I got wound up????  I respounded to a post
with a point of my own and now I'm accused of being a newbie and told to
shut up.  My point is valid reguardless you like it or not. A person
asked a specific question relating to a workbench and he gets a poster
telling him "harbor freight stuff is lousy and oh by the way I've never
even used their products."  I know what HF sells and the quality of the
stuff, I even have the mill he is talking about but back to the original
point he did not ask about the merits of the mill but about a bench to
put it on. Some people in this group start frothing at the mouth if you
even mention HF.  I'm surprised that we haven't seen the posts about old
iron being the best and just wait and look and you'll find the perfect
used machine.

If you want weight and ease of portability in and out of the house,
try a concrete top of managable size and weight and make the rest of
the stand so one can fill it with dry sand. That way you get the
weight and damping that the stand offers and if you need to move it
elsewhere just pull some plugs and let the sand run out.

Another suggestion....every machine stand that I have is required to
be mobile (wheels and leveling feet) and have storage within for
tooling. It may take longer to construct but I have never regreted the
effort.

I bought a Central Machinery mini-mill at auction recently. It weighs
around 500 pounds. It came with a base and an oil tray.

While the mill weighs plenty, the base couldn't be more than 75
pounds. Yet it is sturdy enough to handle the mill just fine.

I think the base is the one in the HF catalog sold as an accessory to
the mill for $200.I can't imagine it being "a nightmare" to get into a
basement.

Well, Bill, the old iron IS the best, and once you work on it, you wonder
what all the chinalloy machines are really good for.  The new stuff has all
the 'toys', but the old behemoths just run, and run, and run, and.....

But on the other hand, you probably couldn't drag a Cincy #2 into your
basement without jacking the house up off the foundations!!

(hey!  YOU brought it up &lt;G&gt;)

Seriously, a concrete top could be made substantially lighter than I did
mine.  When I cast it, I had no practical information on how strong the
concrete would be, so I distinctly over-did it.  Thinner webs and a thinner
top surface would have saved - probably - fifty of those 120lb.

The only concession I made to making the top more usable was to saturate the
top and sides with a heavily-thinned urethane paint.  It sealed the surface
against oil and swarf without adding any significant film thickness to the
surface that might squirm under the shims when the lathe was bolted down.
'More like a stain than a paint, the way I did it.

I agree with you my point was there are people in this group that poo poo a
small mill, especially one from HF.  I built a wooden bench with a 8 inch
thick top because I had access to a bunch of 2 by 8s and wanted as heavy a
bench as possible.  It helped alot with vibration.  The only other thing I
thought of doing to dampen the mill some more is filling the empty column
with lead shot, just haven't gotten a roundtoit yet. :)

That was the idea- lots of dead weight in the right place. While my first
thought was a flat-top obelisk, a length of sonotube with a table on top
would work as well.

I really like Lloyds' comment about painting the concrete as chip and oil
barrier.

I see some of the Rong Fus used in some of the smaller shops..and what a

Actually HF sell all sorts of price point tools.  For example they
sell Sawsall's.  I agree the low priced tools are usually decent value

I have not done this, but have thought about it.  If I ever get around

the machine mounts to.  Heavy being 1/4 or 3/8 inch with some studs or
something welded to  the bottom to act as rebar and mounting.  And
weld up a sheet metal form to cast the concrete into.  I would also
use some rebar in the concrete.  The sheet metal form ought to be

Smaller granite surface plates are pretty cheap these days.

http://www.use-enco.com/CGI/INLMK3?PMK0NO=801529

That would put the mass directly in contact with the machine where it will
do the most good.  Can't bring yourself to do that to a surface plate (it's
just a flat rock after all); check the local gravestone supplier.  Maybe one
could be mounted on one of the cheap HF universal tool stands that often are
on sale.  Just a couple of additional ideas.

All of the larger machine tools at work are on custom poured concrete
foundations. Some, such as the low speed balancing machine (600rpm with a 50
ton rotor) have raised bases that were made in the way that you suggest...
only more so!

I would suggest that if you think you will be moving it in the next decade or
so, to paint a good coat of gloss paint on most of the floor where it is going
to go. The concrete won't bond to the painted bit and should allow it to break
away when you apply the sledge hammer to it.

Make a jig (or use the base of the mill) to hold threaded tubes for the mill's
mounting bolts, they can then be cast directly into the obelisk without having
to drill holes later.

The only think I can see wrong with the idea is that you loose out on
potential cupboard space in the stand. You could always cast a couple of steel
boxes into the stand to act as cupboards, and lessen the amount of concrete
though!

&gt; Bill

Lots of guys here singing the praises to harbour freight tools, and
about every other flavor of cheap import tooling. But they all know or
learn that the stuff has it's limits.

The point was, I beleive, that going to the trouble of planting it on
a concrete stand is rather excessive. It will not benefit from the
attention, therefore it seems a effort for naught. I don't think that
the OP really needs the permission of the group at large to build a
concrete bench for it if that's what he wants, but when it gets out on a
public forum, theres gonna be a pile of opinions, whether they are
welcome or not.

The general tone of your replies is defensive and reads like someone
that is wound up at least a little. Maybe I'm misreading it, maybe not.

Matters not, as free advice is guarunteed at least double your money back!

Yes they do. But the image conveyed by "Harbour Freight machine" is
not  the one that assosciated with the name brands like the Milwaukee,
Makita, and that ilk. And we were discussing a milling machine, no? What
do they stock in machine tools that fit the same strata as the name
brand power tools?

As for the statement that they are what they are, I do not say that
they were without value, rather that one must assess each on it's own
merits. Many of the cheap POS machines are a great value, for the dollar
spent.

I just bought an import bench mill. the best I could find for $1600.
It weighs almost 900lbs. and has a dovetail column. I welded a bench
together for it but after mounting the vise I fing it to be too short.
So tommorow I make another. My point is this, I was taught that next
to safety. the most important thing about machine work is to have a
rigid, solid set-up. If you want it in the basement, find a way. If
you want to use concrete, ask around and be sure because it's
obviously much more of a commitment that wood or metal. As far as the
machine's quality goes, see point number one.

Best up-front gains on a minimill would be from improving the rigidity
of the base to column attachment. Several good solutions online.

But it still needs a good solid base. I would lean toward a roll-around

Damping and rigidity can be traded off, as their product is what counts:
the higher the product, the better.

Some machine tools are made with a welded hollow metal (aluminum works)
base filled with a special softish polymer concrete.  One form is
granite chips in epoxy.

I agree...I would include storage in the cabinet.

You can pour the stand in parts so it would be easier to move if
needed.

You know, I was eyeballing the Burke mill I'm rebuilding.
The base and the "tray" that the mill mounts on would be an almost
perfect base for a minimill. The base is a tapered thing about 30"
square at the bottom, up to about 14" at the top, with storage inside a
door. The tray is about 24X18 and bolts to the top. Both pieces are
heavy cast iron.  Plenty of room in the bottom to add concrete, if you
just have to have it. It probably weighs over 100 lbs as-is.
A Seig minimill would bolt onto this perfectly.

I have seen these bases free for the taking recently on one of these
forums. Some people prefer to make it into a benchtop.  At any rate
there's probably some out there for cheap or free. I bought this whole
machine for $75, more or less working.

Just a thought.   And the more I think about it, I may have to look for
one for my minimill, if it doesn't wind up being part of the Burke

One positive aspect I see right off is the reduction in vibration that
comes with a greater mass.  Since smaller machines tend to transmit
vibrations to the workpiece more readily than larger ones, this alone
would seem to be a benefit.  I once visited a university lab that had
an optical bench, a massive vibrationally isolated and dampened steel
and concrete table to which optical components such as lasers and
special microscopes were attached.  The device was isolated on a
series of hydraulic cylinders, but the assembly was located in the
basement of a large building, mounted on what looked an awful lot like
a giant concrete sarcophagus coming out of the floor.  The principal
investigator of the research project told me that the entire assembly
had been located in the basement prior to the completion of the
building, lowered in by crane.  I can't even imagine what it weighed
(probably on the order of 10 tons or so).

On the usefullness of a rigid base:
A rigid base is going to benifit any conventional machine tool more
than a flimsy base. If there's a lathe or mill (etc.) that performs
better on rickety supports, has anyone heard of it?
On getting a welded bench into the basement:
What I did (my third incarnation for my mill drill's base, second in a
basement) was to make the table out of 2 by 2 by 1/4 thick angle iron,
with the legs removable so it could go down the stairs. It's more
rigid than it sounds, but can't be as rigid as a concrete monolith...
period.
I wouldn't go with a concrete base, because I require my mill/drill to
be semi-mobile. It needs to move around the basement every few years
as other equipment is acquired or ... well heck, I only acquire
equipment, or if I need to change basements, or maybe someday, a
garage. My mill/drill and 9" lathe also have retractable wheels so
they can be moved on a concrete floor (with effort) by one somewhat
obese operator. Levelers are a must that are often ignored by
neophytes   (shims etc. are a sorry substitute)
On concrete options:
I like the suggestion of casting it in parts to be assembled in the
basement. Is there any option that anyone could think of that may
extend the "painted floor" option (for readily removing the monlithic
mass from the floor by preventing bonding) by adding "painted joints"
to the several components that would make up a concrete stand that was
cast in parts?
That is to say, maybe,
paint the floor
lay-up (form) and pour the left and right sides, (don't even scree the
tops of the sides, leave as rough and jagged as possible),let cure,
paint all over including the jagged edges.
lay up and pour the front and back, same treatment as sides.
lay up and pour the top.
Also, include any L-bolts, etc., as desired to clamp everything
together in the pours.
The painted surfaces would simplify removal, while the jagged joints
would promote "keying" of the surfaces, to provide stability and rigid
joints. I doubt this assembly could be successfully re-assembled after
moving, but a concrete structure should probably be considered a one-
time-only structure in most cases regardless.
The "chunks" to be demolished would definitely be easier to handle
than a true monolith, and probably more rigid than the  optional stand
from HF,enco,grizzly etc.
What about building the base largely from concrete blocks, with a
concrete top? Is mortar up to the task? At about a dollar a block this
may be plausible.

A compromise might be (this may have already been suggested) to pour a
THICK say, 6" to 10" slab on top of a shortened (by 6 to 10") steel
base.
I've seen the 700 pound asian mill/drills do really nice work, and
I've seen crappy work come off of 9 by 49 bridgeports. They are cats
and dogs though, and comparison may be futile.
