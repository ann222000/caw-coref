In the reign of the one-nutted king

---Janked rats cried for blood as the prosthetic hand of love waved goodbye
to reason

By Joe Bageant

Not long ago protesting Danish construction workers won a historic victory
against workplace tyranny---they retained their company sponsored
on-the-job-beer breaks. Heartless employers being what they are, had asked
workers to pay half the cost of the beer. Oppression is ever boundless.

About that same time last fall a couple hundred American protesters gathered
in a Washington D.C. parking lot. Chronic liberal malcontents, they had the
gall to ask why our government was slaughtering hundreds of thousands of
abysmally ordinary folks in Iraq, people moreover like themselves who, even
under Saddam Hussein, whose reign was so infamously marked by his penchant
for black velvet paintings and the most sordid kinds of torture,
nevertheless managed to do what most common folks do in the world---send the
kids off to school every morning, cursed the Baghdad traffic, and perhaps a
little fudged on their taxes. So why are they being wiped out at great
public expense, and for no apparent reason?

This being a free republic, the American protesters stood in the parking
lot, packed butthole to belly button inside one of our fatherland's
designated Free Speech Zones (a bad case of branding if ever there was one),
and though they are no longer called that, the function is still the same.
Jabbing their signs upward, the protesters tried to wedge their message into
the wavering thicket of signage above their heads. Between rather strangely
meterless chants, such as "One, two, three, four, end the war!" the evil
librul protestors were left to contemplate just what those the Plexiglas
faced squadrons of police ninjas might do, should one of the dissidents make
a cautious move toward the Porto Johns, which were placed slightly over the
yellow painted line that assumedly marked the outer boundary free speech in
America. Was it better to ease over into the Porto John, or to hold it until
the "designated hour of disassemblage"? However ineffective state supervised
dissidence may be here, protesting is hard going in America. No Dane's beer
wrecked bladder could survive it.

Pity the poor American left, (who would be considered right wing moderates
in most of the world, but in America being against any war makes you a
leftist.) Any time American leftists start pointing at the root causes of
our national disease, they are neatly handed a fresh bloody war to oppose.
Each new generation of the left gets its energies sapped, gets locked into
the position of continually opposing one war, then another and another. Ever
since World War I (when they came up with the novel idea of world peace, a
notion now considered completely goofball in America today) they've been
standing on the street corners or in the parks---or more recently, inside
the Free Speech Zones way the hell out at the edge of town. At any rate,
they can never come close to naming the dark and profitable tumor at the
heart of America, the economic system under which we all live. To survive
and grow, the American system needs war, making war inevitable. To keep up
the pretense of freedom it needs harmless dissent.

America has a long record of stifling dissent exactly when dissent is most
needed. Democracy American style means we get free speech for trivial
matters but not for life-and-death issues. When an election is stolen, the
very party from whom it was stolen refuses to protest the theft because
well, "Nobody likes sour grapes, do they?" thereby assuring future electoral
thefts. When America supplies Israel with cluster bombs to kill Palestinian
children and grandmothers, you don't see rallies against Israel or American
arms cartels. You see yet another exercise of free speech on behalf those
things the politicians and corporations could care less about, and thus
grant us permission to "dissent" upon. Issues such as gender and identity,
or just about anything related to sexual freedom: "Go ahead, parade and rant
about your own penises and vulvas. Just don't challenge the banks, the war
machine or the fraudulent democratic process by which we manage the people.
Remember, fucking with these things is called terrorism. So stick to your
own narrow "issues" like sexual freedom and nobody will get hurt. Got it
punk?"

Good ole sexual freedom, one of the American left's dearest golden oldies.
It's not as if sexual freedom has not been a fact of life in this country
ever since the puritans lost that fight in the Sixties and Seventies. Sure
there is a small but very damned loud contingency of bitter enders making a
last stand at imposing restrictions that the public has already rejected.
But we did win the sexual revolution, my friends. Look around at the movies,
gay and lesbian focused TV shows, pre-marital and extra-marital sex as the
main fare in magazines, popular novels and TV shows. Hell, we've even
created a couple of new sexes I still haven't figured out, all those
"crosses" and "trans" whatevers. We may not have become the Amsterdam of the
New World (which as near as I can tell, is Rio de Janero) but we
nevertheless won.

Better yet, people stand behind what they have won too. Bill Clinton is
living proof. The fact that Clinton, despite cigars, blowjobs, impeachment,
and $40 million spent by the Republicans to rub his face in a cum stained
dress on television for years on end, remains massively popular. Every year
we find him waving to the world from near the top of the list of the world's
most admired men. As a martyr symbol for sexual freedom---though we wish the
hell he could have kept it in his pants in the first place---all his
supposed sins, not to mention his genuine crimes against humanity, were
washed away. Much is attributed to his charm, his Oxford encyclopedic mind
and fried chicken grin. But he is no more charming than Ronald Reagan was,
even if Clinton could spot that senile old saint of the GOP a hundred IQ
points and still whip him on Jeopardy. Yet charm and smarts will get you but
so far, not to mention into a lot of trouble if you happen to have Clinton's
libido. Clinton's charm was only by comparison to the mostly second string
power hungry puds who preceded and succeeded him in that bugged Oval Office
chair.

The truth is that Clinton, like Reagan, fucked over tens of millions of the
American poor, sentenced uncounted children to death by embargo, and shipped
millions of American jobs wholesale to the slums of Mysore and Mexico City.
He was as close to being a Republican as you can be without getting the
mandatory GOP lobotomy and a wet kiss from Ted Hagarty. Still though,
millions of Americans (including me) refuse to repudiate him because his
right to sexual privacy represented their own, and still represents their
own. And all the Bible haired gasbags on the Christian Broadcasting Network
and all the sexually frustrated Holy Rollers in the country are not going to
turn things around. We won that one.

But we have never won against a war until it is too damned late and the
Pentagon and the Halliburtons of this country have wrung every blood stained
buck from it and moved on toward setting up the next one. Yet the left,
perhaps sensing the futility of protesting the latest war from inside their
free speech cages---which seem only to be reserved for war
dissenters---dissipates its energies further by charging at the sly
Republican matador's array of fluttering capes, one of which is labeled
sexual privacy. No cage required. You can usually parade that one right down
the street, further proof the fatherland is a free land, and that the powers
that be could care less about that issue.

Janking the rats

While we are sniping at liberal sacred cows here, I may as well plink
briefly at another one---gun control. It's all bullshit. The left plays into
the parched red claws of the worst conservative elements when it makes a
fool of itself over what it does not understand, when it succumbs to the
righteous wailing of the anti-gun intelligentsia in the brownstones of
Chelsea. Twice as many people own guns as vote in this country, and half of
American households have at least one gun. Get over it. The guns are here to
stay. Gun control and sexual privacy are just two of the dozens of political
wedges liberals to drive on behalf of the same elite political and owning
class the sends yet another generation off to die in the name of the
country.

A rancid clammy smell permeates the room, the taste of vomit in the throat,
then.

SCREAMING MAN HERE! DIE FOR THEIR COUNTRY? BAGEANT YOU LOATHESOME DOUBLE
DEALING GODDAMNED LIZARD! NOT A SINGLE CALLOW CORN FED KANSAS STRIPPLING OR
LOS ANGELES MEXICAN SCARFING THEIR MICROWAVED BURRITOS IN IRAQ HAS DIED FOR,
OR HAD HIS ARMS BLOWN OFF FOR, HIS COUNTRY. THEY DIED (OR ARE TRYING TO
MASTER THE ARTS OF LOVE WITH THAT SEXY NEW PROSTHETIC CLAW) IN SERVICE OF
THE SYNDICATE. THEY DIED AT THE ORDERS OF ITS CEO, PRESIDENT SPARKY AND HIS
GANG OF ADDLED COLD WAR DROOLERS. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT! THEY WILL
SOON GO OFF TO IRAN WHISTLING THE THEME FROM ROCKY AND SLEEP THE SLEEP OF
ZOMBIES IN THE 100 DEGREE DESERT NIGHTS BECAUSE, AHA! THE SYNDICATE'S MIND
SCRUBBING MACHINERY IS FAULTLESS! FROM THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGINACE IN GRADE
SCHOOL, TO THAT LAST SURPRISED LOOK ON THEIR FACES WHEN THE I.E.D. SAYS
"HELLO DARLING" IN FARSI, THEY WILL BE DREAMING OF EAGLES, AND FLAGS AND
PARIS HILTON'S CROTCH. BIRTH TO DEATH, THE MIND SCURBBER'S PROGRAMMING IS
FAULTLESS, I TELL YOU. FAULTLESS!

Hmmm..

Anyway, the reason liberals are sucker bait for every wedge the Republican
think tanks can hand them is because liberals, like every other American,
are conditioned to compete against each other---even fellow liberals. In a
monetized rat race society (best called The Company) that continually pits
its citizens/workers against one another in a toxic winner take all rat race

I bet you're one of those people who thinks that if congress
allows this crap, or if a municipality does, that your "rights have
been stolen". You were born with your rights, and no judge or supreme
court justice or president who's a chimp lookalike can "take away your
rights". They may be able to convince you that your rights exist as
determined by them, but that's all they can do, and if you fall for it
YOU'RE the schmuck.

That's a piss poor cop out, if that's what it's intended to
be. And "the left" could have already done a lot for the environment
if social management wasn't more important to them.

And what a favor that was... Let us know when that institution
