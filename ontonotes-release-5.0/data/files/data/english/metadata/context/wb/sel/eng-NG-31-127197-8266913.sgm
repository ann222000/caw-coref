As Big Brother 8 has progressed, questions have come up about America's
Player, Eric, and what he can or can't do. Indeed, many people have
speculated and debated these points. But I decided to go to the source, CBS,
to find out.

One thing I think would be nice is to have a running tally of how Eric is
doing on his tasks. We haven't seen one, but CBS told me, &quot;As of Thursday's
show (8/2), Eric has completed 7 of 9 America's Player tasks.&quot; This means he's
earned $10,000 so far, and is three tasks away from another ten grand, as he
gets that much for every five tasks completed.

It would appear one task he failed is sleepwalking into Joe's bed until Joe
woke up (we saw him get a &quot;buzz&quot; for that one). As for the other, I'm not
entirely sure. He failed in his attempt to get Kail evicted this past week
and the week before. That would seem like at least three failures. However,
the wording is sometimes different on his tasks - in some cases he has to
attempt things, in others he has to succeed. So perhaps that's the situation
here. Like I said, it would be nice to see a running tally of how he's
doing.

But what does Eric actually have to do when given an America's Player
assignment? Can he ignore it if he wants, such as if he thinks it will hurt
his standing in the house?

In short, no. CBS said, &quot;Once Eric is given his America's player task, he
must make a meaningful [effort] to complete the task.&quot; However, he is not
told how to do it. As CBS told me, &quot;His methods of campaigning or completing
the task are his own.&quot; So, for example, when he was told to vandalize
somebody's belongings, he was presumably not told to use mustard on a
shirt - that was his own idea.

A key point that I have been concerned about - at least privately if not
specifically mentioned in any of my articles to date - is that Eric has
never actually cast an eviction vote. Julie Chen would bring him in and they
would chat, but his vote was always assumed to be that cast by America.

Since I thought these were suggestions given by America, with a cash prize
for everything he accomplished, I figured Eric could choose to vote
differently from America if it was to his advantage. For example, we have
seen how his two votes that were different from the majority have been
causing Eric problems this week. I figured he would have been smart to vote
with the house, forsaking one of his tasks for a better shot at the big
prize at the end.

But CBS dispelled that notion for me, simply saying, &quot;Eric's eviction vote
is always America's vote.&quot; So in other words, he does not have a choice. We
are not advising Eric on what he should do, we are telling him what he must
do in terms of voting. He can tell America how he wants us to vote, but once
we give him his orders, he's stuck with 'em.

And frankly, that's where things get difficult. We tell him who we want him
to target on Tuesday nights. But a lot can happen between Tuesday and
Thursday in the Big Brother house. So America is operating at a
disadvantage, and putting Eric at a disadvantage as well.

Of course, America can also vote based on anything they want, including
whether they want a particular player in the house for reasons other than
Eric's strategy! Many people are sick of seeing Jen, so she becomes a
target. Same with Kail. Meanwhile, the house strategy shifts and Eric is
left out in the cold.

But it also becomes a test of Eric's abilities. Can he lie well enough to
convince people he was not the one who cast the dissenting vote? As we have
seen, the most recent answer is &quot;no&quot; - though he was additionally hurt by a
banner plane and by Dick and Daniele's illogical logic that accidentally
reached the correct conclusion.

One RNO staffer wondered if Eric could reveal his status as America's Player
to the other houseguests, perhaps as a strategy to avoid getting evicted.
For example, I just mentioned how Dick and Daniele came to a conclusion
about how Eric was supposedly trying to set up Nick and then Daniele,
ascribing all sorts of evil conspiracy theories to him (like that he's been
in an alliance with Kail and Jen all along). If Eric felt he was in a
situation where he might be evicted because of these stories, could he admit
to being America's Player and say, &quot;Hey, I was just doing what I was told&quot;?
Maybe that would get them to ease up a bit.

Alas, no. CBS told me clearly, &quot;Eric cannot tell the other houseguests that
he is America's Player.&quot; So that ends that possibility.

Where does that leave Eric? In an interesting position. He has already won
some money and might win more. But he also has been restricted from playing
the game he wanted to play. Given that he was described as such a Big
Brother enthusiast, I can certainly see why some of his family members
expressed concerns when it was revealed that Eric is America's Player. We
don't know exactly how Eric would have played differently without orders
from America, but we can pretty well guarantee that he would not have cast
those lone votes that drew so much attention. And without those votes,
everything that has taken place since then would have likely been very
different indeed.

Eric is certainly in a difficult position. Until this week, he was handling
it admirably. With last night's episode, it seems like the producers really
have it in for him - he's in a tough spot and they want him to flatter
somebody incessantly. That can only make things worse, no matter who it is.

Hopefully, though, he can pull things back together and overcome the
situation he's found himself in while still following America's dictates. We'll
see if he can do it.

THIS is the most BS line of logic in the entire AP debate.  Nobody with a
brain in their head would so blatantly deviate from the consensus like that
because there is no way you can lie to that group of morons and psychopaths
about it.  If you were to take a composite of some of the most
successful-yet-deceptive players in realty TV history (The product of some
demented three-way between BB3 Danielle, Dr. Will, and Richard Hatch) even
THAT person wouldn't attempt to do what Eric is compelled to do because
there is simply no way it can successfully be done.  There isn't.

Fortunately, the article as a whole seems to be sympathetic toward Eric's
screwedness and lays out why the most ridiculous eviction in BB history is
about to go down tonight.  Congratulations BB.  Another &quot;twist&quot; proves to be
an abject failure.
