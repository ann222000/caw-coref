I have posted the following article before because I'm very
concerned about the country and want to help people see
what's going on before it's too late.
I'm not trying to insult Americans but am just pointing out how
we have been conditioned by the media to help along the plan
for world government.
This country has to be brought down before they can meld it
into the rest of the world. They are trying to destroy this country.

Why Americans Act Like Sheep,

Americans act like sheep because they have been brainwashed over a
long period of time by the media.
The &quot;Insiders&quot;, as some call them, in other words the people pulling
the
proverbial strings, have a good deal of control over the media (mainly
tv.).
They are controlling the government also. The end goal is one world
government (&quot;The New World Order&quot;), the ultimate tyranny.
The news casts are biased, the programming and even the commercials
have been affected.
What they have done and are still doing is causing certain beliefs,
morals
and traditions to look stupid, old-fashioned, and uncool or unpopular.

Things such as religion, gun ownership and morality. Morality, guns
and religion almost sound like dirty words, don't they? That's because

we've been programmed that way.Without morals to hold families
together people are more alone and therefore easier to control.
Without freedom to own guns for their own protection they are
also easier to control. Without a religion to get strength from or to
believe in people are easier to control and then are more apt to look
to &quot;Big Brother&quot; (the government) as their savior and protector.
The more power the people give the government to protect them
&quot;for their own good&quot; the less freedom the people have and where
is the line drawn? When does the government step back and let
adult people decide for themselves what is best for them? Instead
of stepping back the government has grown bigger and bigger, taking
more and more into it's own hands. The people are being taxed more
and have less say as to what their money is being spent on, and
this problem is getting worse.
Another strategy of the government is to control by fear. They use
hype about things like &quot;global warming&quot;, the ozone layer being
destroyed, fear of people owning guns, etc., to set more limits and
create more laws intended to control the people.
They have made it unfashionable for people to think for themselves.
It isn't &quot;politically correct&quot; to say certain things or you will be
frowned
upon. People have been taught not to talk about things such as
politics or religion. Maybe if they did they just might start
thinking!
We can't have that!
Morality has been a key target of attack by the media in the last
30 or more years and they have succeeded in tearing it down to
a large extent. People are not staying married, kids are growing up
without their parents around because the single parent has to work,
therefore kids are not being taught any guidelines. They learn from
tv,
the media. Kids are also having unwanted babies. Who then steps in
with the answer to the increased crime and poverty as a result of
single
parent families? The government of course. When the government gives
you money they have control over you.
I have given a brief view of the conspiracy as I have seen it unfold.
It should be obvious to anyone as this is what has been happening
before their eyes.
Now we are being taught to doubt and laugh at people who believe
there is a conspiracy. The phrase &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is being made
a common phrase. It's not a &quot;theory&quot;, it's a fact.
