Subject: KOREA FALLS
Title: The New World Order Files
Author: David Allen Rivera

From 1910, until 1945, Korea was part of the Japanese empire. The
victorious World War II allies agreed that Korea should be made an
independent country, but until negotiations could take place, the U.S.
took charge of the area south of the 38th parallel, while the Soviets
occupied the northern half. Plans to establish a unified Korean
government failed, and in 1948,/ /rival governments were established:
the Communist government of Kim Il Sung in the North, and the
pro-Western government under Syngman Rhee in the South.

An officers training school, and a small arms plant was set up by the
United States. They gave the country $100,000,000 worth of military
hardware to arm the 96,000 soldiers of the South Korean armed forces. On
July 17, 1949, Owen Lattimore said: &quot;The thing to do is let South Korea
fall, but not to let it look as if we pushed it.&quot; In a memo to the State

quickly as possible from its entanglements in South Korea.&quot; In 1949/,
/the American troops were withdrawn from South Korea, and in a January
12, 1950 speech, U.S. Secretary of State, Dean G. Acheson publicly
stated that South Korea was &quot;outside of (the U.S.) defense perimeter.&quot;

The North Koreans, heavily equipped by the Russians, considered
Acheson's statement an invitation to attack, in order to unify the
country under communism. Gen. Douglas MacArthur had received military
intelligence reports from Gen. Charles A. Willoughby, that North Korea
was preparing for an invasion, and John Foster Dulles of the State
Department went to 'investigate,' and covered up the activity he viewed
at the 38th parallel.

On June 24, 1950, the North Koreans swarmed across the 38th parallel,
and proceeded to overrun the country. Rhee appealed to the United
States, and the United Nations for help, as the communists closed in on
the South Korean capital of Seoul.

Truman called for an immediate meeting of the United Nations Security
Council, who convened the next day, and called the attack a &quot;breach of
the peace,&quot; ordering the North Koreans to withdraw to the border. Two
days later, the Security Council called upon the UN members to furnish
assistance. Immediately the U.S. sent in ground troops and began air
strikes. On July 7, the Security Council urged 15 of the countries to
put their troops at the disposal of the United States, under the UN
command of Gen. Douglas MacArthur.

After MacArthur's amphibious assault on September 15, at Inchon Bay, UN
forces were able to recapture Seoul, and began to push the North Koreans
back across the border. In October, they captured the North Korean
capital of Pyongyang, and many communists retreated into Manchuria and
Russia. The Chinese, thinking that the security of their country was
being threatened, stormed across the border on November 26, 1950, and
stopped the UN army at the Yalu River.

With the UN being involved in the war, all U.S. battle plans had to be
submitted for approval, in advance, to the Under Secretary for Political
and Security Council Affairs. Due to a secret agreement made by
Secretary of State Edward Stettinius in 1945, this position was to
always be filled by a Communist from an eastern European country. During
the war, it was filled by Russia's Constantine Zinchenko. It was later
revealed, that Russian military advisors were actually directing the
North Korean war effort, and one of those advisors, Lt. Gen. Alexandre
Vasiliev, actually gave the order to attack. Vasiliev was the Chairman
of the UN Military Staff Committee, who along with the Under Secretary
for Political and Security Council Affairs, was responsible for all UN
military action. Vasliliev had to take a leave of absence from his
position, to command the communist troops. So, what it boiled down to,
was that the Communists were controlling both sides of the war, and
Russia was able to receive vital information concerning all troop
movements within the UN forces in Korea, which was passed on to the
North Koreans and Chinese.

The Taiwan government was planning to move against China, and Truman
warned Chiang Kai-shek not to make an attempt to recapture his homeland.
Truman ordered the American Seventh Fleet into the Strait of Formosa to
prevent any type of invasion. This freed the Red China army to enter the
Korean War. Chiang then offered to send an advance force of 33,000
troops into North Korea, but the State Department refused. They were a
member of the UN, yet the United States would not let them fight.

The Korean War, Korean Conflict, or Police Action, as it is sometimes
called, developed into a stalemate of broken cease-fire agreements, and
MacArthur made plans for a massive retaliation against China. He wanted
to bomb the ammunition and fuel dumps, the supply bases, and
communication lines to China(bridges across the Yalu River), and to post
a blockade around the Chinese coast. However, on December 5, 1950,
Truman and other Administration officials decided that this sort of
action would bring Russia into the conflict, and possibly initiate World
War III. MacArthur was ordered not to proceed with any of his plans. The
Joint Chiefs of Staff said: &quot;We felt the action urged by Gen. MacArthur
would hazard this safety (of the U.S.) without promising any certain
proportionate gain.&quot; A letter written to a Congressman, by MacArthur,
was read on the floor of the House, giving them the full story of how
much the Red Chinese were involved. Still, nothing was done. Gen. Lin
Piao, the Red Chinese commander, said later: &quot;I would never have made
the attack and risked my men and military reputation if I had not been
assured that Washington would restrain General MacArthur from taking
adequate retaliatory measures against my lines of supply and
communication.&quot;

With MacArthur insisting that there was no substitute for victory, and
that the war against Communism would be either won or lost in Korea, he
was relieved of his command, on April 11, 1951, by Gen. Matthew B.
Ridgeway, a member of the CFR.

Air Force Commander, Gen. George Stratemeyer said: &quot;We had sufficient
air bombardment, fighters, reconnaissance so that I could have taken out
all those supplies, those airdromes on the other side of the Yalu; I
could have bombed the devils between there and Mukden, stopped the
railroad operating and the people of China that were fighting could not
have been supplied...But we weren't permitted to do it. As a result, a
lot of American blood was spilled over there in Korea.&quot;

Gen. Stratemeyer testified before the Congress: &quot;You get in war to win
it. You do not get in war to stand still and lose it and we were
required to lose it. We were not permitted to win.&quot; Gen. Matt Clark told
them: &quot;I was not allowed to bomb the numerous bridges across the Yalu
River over which the enemy constantly poured his trucks, and his
munitions, and his killers.&quot;

MacArthur would later write: &quot;I was...worried by a series of directives
from Washington which were greatly decreasing the potential of my air
force. First I was forbidden &quot;hot&quot; pursuit of enemy planes that attacked
our own. Manchuria and Siberia were sanctuaries of inviolate protection
for all enemy forces and for all enemy purposes, no matter what
depredations or assaults might come from there. Then I was denied the
right to bomb the hydroelectric plants along the Yalu River. The order
was broadened to include every plant in North Korea which was capable of
furnishing electric power to Manchuria and Siberia...Most
incomprehensible of all was the refusal to let me bomb the important
supply center at Racin, which was not in Manchuria or Siberia, but many
miles from the border, in forwarded supplies from Vladivostok for the
North Korean Army. I felt that step-by-step my weapons were being taken
away from me...&quot;

&quot;That there was some leak in intelligence was evident to everyone.
(Brig. Gen. Walton) Walker continually complained to me that operations
were known to the enemy in advance through sources in Washington...
information must have been relayed to them assuring that the Yalu River
bridges would continue to enjoy sanctuary and that their bases would be
left intact. They knew they could swarm down across the Yalu River
without having to worry about bombers hitting their Manchurian supply
lines...I realized for the first time that I had actually been denied
the use of my full military power to safeguard the lives of my soldiers
and the safety of my army.&quot;

Over 33,000 American lives were lost in a war that they were not
allowed to win. Instead, a truce was signed on July 27, 1953.

However, the Communists weren't giving up on Korea. With North Korea
being supported by China, Russia and the Eastern Europe communist bloc
countries, they built up their military strength, and made enormous
economic gains. During the late 1960's, they began a dialogue for the
reunification of Korea, and bilateral talks were held in 1972, which
further improved their relations, as the Communists attempted to take
over with diplomacy.

As information about communist agents occupying high cabinet posts
surfaced, the American people took out their frustrations at the polls.
Eisenhower's slogan was: &quot;Let's clean up the mess in Washington.&quot; He had
promised &quot;peace with honor&quot; in Korea, however, the truce allowed 400
soldiers to remain in communist prisons. Even though the 1952 Republican
Platform called the Truman Plan &quot;ignominious bartering with our
enemies,&quot; in reality, Eisenhower's plan made even more concessions.

Eisenhower's tough rhetoric on communism ushered in a renewed
patriotism in America. People behind the Iron Curtain were inspired, and
in the fall of 1956, Hungarian freedom fighters forced the Russians to
leave their homeland, ending Soviet occupation. What did the United
States do? According to the _Congressional

With respect to the last paraggraph,  Robert Welch did not claim
merely that &quot;the Eisenhower Administration was a tool of the
Communists&quot;.   He claimed that President Eisenhower was a traitor, and
a conscious deliberate agent of the Communists.

&gt;&gt; required to lose it. We were not permitted to win.&quot; Gen. Matt Clark told
&gt;&gt; them: &quot;I was not allowed to bomb the numerous bridges across the Yalu
&gt;&gt; River over which the enemy constantly poured his trucks, and his
&gt;&gt; munitions, and his killers.&quot;

&gt;&gt; MacArthur would later write: &quot;I was...worried by a series of directives

&gt;&gt; force. First I was forbidden &quot;hot&quot; pursuit of enemy planes that attacked
&gt;&gt; our own. Manchuria and Siberia were sanctuaries of inviolate protection
&gt;&gt; for all enemy forces and for all enemy purposes, no matter what
&gt;&gt; depredations or assaults might come from there. Then I was denied the
&gt;&gt; right to bomb the hydroelectric plants along the Yalu River. The order

&gt; &gt;&gt; Title: The New World Order Files
&gt; &gt;&gt; Author: David Allen Rivera

&gt; &gt;&gt; From 1910, until 1945, Korea was part of the Japanese empire. The
&gt; &gt;&gt; victorious World War II allies agreed that Korea should be made an
&gt; &gt;&gt; independent country, but until negotiations could take place, the U.S.
&gt; &gt;&gt; took charge of the area south of the 38th parallel, while the Soviets
&gt; &gt;&gt; occupied the northern half. Plans to establish a unified Korean
&gt; &gt;&gt; government failed, and in 1948,/ /rival governments were established:
&gt; &gt;&gt; the Communist government of Kim Il Sung in the North, and the
&gt; &gt;&gt; pro-Western government under Syngman Rhee in the South.

&gt; &gt;&gt; An officers training school, and a small arms plant was set up by the
&gt; &gt;&gt; United States. They gave the country $100,000,000 worth of military
&gt; &gt;&gt; hardware to arm the 96,000 soldiers of the South Korean armed forces. On
&gt; &gt;&gt; July 17, 1949, Owen Lattimore said: &quot;The thing to do is let South Korea
&gt; &gt;&gt; fall, but not to let it look as if we pushed it.&quot; In a memo to the
&gt; &gt; StateDepartment, he wrote: &quot;The United States should disembarrass itself as

&gt; &gt;&gt; quickly as possible from its entanglements in South Korea.&quot; In 1949/,
&gt; &gt;&gt; /the American troops were withdrawn from South Korea, and in a January
&gt; &gt;&gt; 12, 1950 speech, U.S. Secretary of State, Dean G. Acheson publicly
&gt; &gt;&gt; stated that South Korea was &quot;outside of (the U.S.) defense perimeter.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; The North Koreans, heavily equipped by the Russians, considered
&gt; &gt;&gt; Acheson's statement an invitation to attack, in order to unify the
&gt; &gt;&gt; country under communism. Gen. Douglas MacArthur had received military
&gt; &gt;&gt; intelligence reports from Gen. Charles A. Willoughby, that North Korea
&gt; &gt;&gt; was preparing for an invasion, and John Foster Dulles of the State
&gt; &gt;&gt; Department went to 'investigate,' and covered up the activity he viewed
&gt; &gt;&gt; at the 38th parallel.

&gt; &gt;&gt; On June 24, 1950, the North Koreans swarmed across the 38th parallel,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and proceeded to overrun the country. Rhee appealed to the United
&gt; &gt;&gt; States, and the United Nations for help, as the communists closed in on
&gt; &gt;&gt; the South Korean capital of Seoul.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Truman called for an immediate meeting of the United Nations Security
&gt; &gt;&gt; Council, who convened the next day, and called the attack a &quot;breach of
&gt; &gt;&gt; the peace,&quot; ordering the North Koreans to withdraw to the border. Two
&gt; &gt;&gt; days later, the Security Council called upon the UN members to furnish
&gt; &gt;&gt; assistance. Immediately the U.S. sent in ground troops and began air
&gt; &gt;&gt; strikes. On July 7, the Security Council urged 15 of the countries to
&gt; &gt;&gt; put their troops at the disposal of the United States, under the UN
&gt; &gt;&gt; command of Gen. Douglas MacArthur.

&gt; &gt;&gt; After MacArthur's amphibious assault on September 15, at Inchon Bay, UN
&gt; &gt;&gt; forces were able to recapture Seoul, and began to push the North Koreans
&gt; &gt;&gt; back across the border. In October, they captured the North Korean
&gt; &gt;&gt; capital of Pyongyang, and many communists retreated into Manchuria and
&gt; &gt;&gt; Russia. The Chinese, thinking that the security of their country was
&gt; &gt;&gt; being threatened, stormed across the border on November 26, 1950, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; stopped the UN army at the Yalu River.

&gt; &gt;&gt; With the UN being involved in the war, all U.S. battle plans had to be
&gt; &gt;&gt; submitted for approval, in advance, to the Under Secretary for Political
&gt; &gt;&gt; and Security Council Affairs. Due to a secret agreement made by
&gt; &gt;&gt; Secretary of State Edward Stettinius in 1945, this position was to
&gt; &gt;&gt; always be filled by a Communist from an eastern European country. During
&gt; &gt;&gt; the war, it was filled by Russia's Constantine Zinchenko. It was later
&gt; &gt;&gt; revealed, that Russian military advisors were actually directing the
&gt; &gt;&gt; North Korean war effort, and one of those advisors, Lt. Gen. Alexandre
&gt; &gt;&gt; Vasiliev, actually gave the order to attack. Vasiliev was the Chairman
&gt; &gt;&gt; of the UN Military Staff Committee, who along with the Under Secretary
&gt; &gt;&gt; for Political and Security Council Affairs, was responsible for all UN
&gt; &gt;&gt; military action. Vasliliev had to take a leave of absence from his
&gt; &gt;&gt; position, to command the communist troops. So, what it boiled down to,
&gt; &gt;&gt; was that the Communists were controlling both sides of the war, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; Russia was able to receive vital information concerning all troop
&gt; &gt;&gt; movements within the UN forces in Korea, which was passed on to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; North Koreans and Chinese.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The Taiwan government was planning to move against China, and Truman
&gt; &gt;&gt; warned Chiang Kai-shek not to make an attempt to recapture his homeland.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Truman ordered the American Seventh Fleet into the Strait of Formosa to
&gt; &gt;&gt; prevent any type of invasion. This freed the Red China army to enter the
&gt; &gt;&gt; Korean War. Chiang then offered to send an advance force of 33,000
&gt; &gt;&gt; troops into North Korea, but the State Department refused. They were a
&gt; &gt;&gt; member of the UN, yet the United States would not let them fight.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The Korean War, Korean Conflict, or Police Action, as it is sometimes
&gt; &gt;&gt; called, developed into a stalemate of broken cease-fire agreements, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; MacArthur made plans for a massive retaliation against China. He wanted
&gt; &gt;&gt; to bomb the ammunition and fuel dumps, the supply bases, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; communication lines to China(bridges across the Yalu River), and to post
&gt; &gt;&gt; a blockade around the Chinese coast. However, on December 5, 1950,
&gt; &gt;&gt; Truman and other Administration officials decided that this sort of
&gt; &gt;&gt; action would bring Russia into the conflict, and possibly initiate World
&gt; &gt;&gt; War III. MacArthur was ordered not to proceed with any of his plans. The
&gt; &gt;&gt; Joint Chiefs of Staff said: &quot;We felt the action urged by Gen. MacArthur
&gt; &gt;&gt; would hazard this safety (of the U.S.) without promising any certain
&gt; &gt;&gt; proportionate gain.&quot; A letter written to a Congressman, by MacArthur,
&gt; &gt;&gt; was read on the floor of the House, giving them the full story of how
&gt; &gt;&gt; much the Red Chinese were involved. Still, nothing was done. Gen. Lin
&gt; &gt;&gt; Piao, the Red Chinese commander, said later: &quot;I would never have made
&gt; &gt;&gt; the attack and risked my men and military reputation if I had not been
&gt; &gt;&gt; assured that Washington would restrain General MacArthur from taking
&gt; &gt;&gt; adequate retaliatory measures against my lines of supply and
&gt; &gt;&gt; communication.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; With MacArthur insisting that there was no substitute for victory, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; that the war against Communism would be either won or lost in Korea, he
&gt; &gt;&gt; was relieved of his command, on April 11, 1951, by Gen. Matthew B.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Ridgeway, a member of the CFR.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Air Force Commander, Gen. George Stratemeyer said: &quot;We had sufficient
&gt; &gt;&gt; air bombardment, fighters, reconnaissance so that I could have taken out
&gt; &gt;&gt; all those supplies, those airdromes on the other side of the Yalu; I
&gt; &gt;&gt; could have bombed the devils between there and Mukden, stopped the
&gt; &gt;&gt; railroad operating and the people of China that were fighting could not
&gt; &gt;&gt; have been supplied...But we weren't permitted to do it. As a result, a
&gt; &gt;&gt; lot of American blood was spilled over there in Korea.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; Gen. Stratemeyer testified before the Congress: &quot;You get in war to win
&gt; &gt;&gt; it. You do not get in war to stand still and lose it and we were
&gt; &gt;&gt; required to lose it. We were not permitted to win.&quot; Gen. Matt Clark told

Almond, in answer to your question here is the pertinent information
from Robert Welch's original 1950's unpublished book-length manuscript
entitled &quot;The Politician&quot; -- which later was published in 1963 with
slight editing.

In the 1963 published edition, Welch is somewhat more guarded and
theoretical in his wording, but he still manages to defame Eisenhower
and plainly insinuate that Ike was a traitor. The chapter title in
which even the toned-down comments are made is: The Word Is Treason

Page 266, unpublished version: &quot;For the sake of honesty, however, I
want to confess here my own conviction that Eisenhower's motivation is
more ideological than opportunistic. Or, to put it bluntly, I
personally think that he has been sympathetic to ultimate Communist
aims, realistically willing to use Communist means to help them
achieve their goals, knowingly accepting and abiding by Communist
orders, and consciously serving the Communist conspiracy, for all of
his adult life.&quot;

Page 267, unpublished version: &quot;And it seems to me that the
explanation of sheer political opportunism, to account for
Eisenhower's Communist-aiding career, stems merely from a deep-rooted
aversion of any American to recognizing the horrible truth. Most of
the doubters, who go all the way with me except to the final logical
conclusion, appear to have no trouble whatever in suspecting that
Milton Eisenhower is an outright Communist. Yet they draw back from
attaching the same suspicion to his brother, for no other real reason
than that one is a professor and the other a president. While I too
think that Milton Eisenhower is a Communist, and has been for thirty
years, this opinion is based largely on general circumstances of his
conduct. But my firm belief that Dwight Eisenhower is a dedicated,
conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy is based on an
accumulation of detailed evidence so extensive and so palpable that it
seems to me to put this conviction beyond any reasonable doubt.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; railroad operating and the people of China that were fighting could not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have been supplied...But we weren't permitted to do it. As a result, a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lot of American blood was spilled over there in Korea.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Gen. Stratemeyer testified before the Congress: &quot;You get in war to win
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it. You do not get in war to stand still and lose it and we were
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; required to lose it. We were not permitted to win.&quot; Gen. Matt Clark told
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; them: &quot;I was not allowed to bomb the numerous bridges across the Yalu
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; River over which the enemy constantly poured his trucks, and his
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; munitions, and his killers.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; MacArthur would later write: &quot;I was...worried by a series of directives
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; from Washington which were greatly decreasing the potential of my air
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; force. First I was forbidden &quot;hot&quot; pursuit of enemy planes that attacked
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; our own. Manchuria and Siberia were sanctuaries of inviolate protection
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for all enemy forces and for all enemy purposes, no matter what
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; depredations or assaults might come from there. Then I was denied the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; right to bomb the hydroelectric plants along the Yalu River. The order
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; was broadened to include every plant in North Korea which was capable of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; furnishing electric power to Manchuria and Siberia...Most
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; incomprehensible of all was the refusal to let me bomb the important
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; supply center at Racin, which was not in Manchuria or Siberia, but many
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; miles from the border, in forwarded supplies from Vladivostok for the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; North Korean Army. I felt that step-by-step my weapons were being taken
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; away from me...&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;That there was some leak in intelligence was evident to everyone.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (Brig. Gen. Walton) Walker continually complained to me that operations
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; were known to the enemy in advance through sources in Washington...
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; information must have been relayed to them assuring that the Yalu River
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bridges would continue to enjoy sanctuary and that their bases would be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; left intact. They knew they could swarm down across the Yalu River
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; without having to worry about bombers hitting their Manchurian supply
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lines...I realized for the first time that I had actually been denied

Almond, in answer to your question here is the pertinent information
from Robert Welch's original 1950's unpublished book-length manuscript
entitled &quot;The Politician&quot; -- which later was published in 1963 with
slight editing.

In the 1963 published edition, Welch is somewhat more guarded and
theoretical in his wording, but he still manages to defame Eisenhower
and plainly insinuate that Ike was a traitor. The chapter title in
which even the toned-down comments are made is: The Word Is Treason

Page 266, unpublished version: &quot;For the sake of honesty, however, I
want to confess here my own conviction that Eisenhower's motivation is
more ideological than opportunistic. Or, to put it bluntly, I
personally think that he has been sympathetic to ultimate Communist
aims, realistically willing to use Communist means to help them
achieve their goals, knowingly accepting and abiding by Communist
orders, and consciously serving the Communist conspiracy, for all of
his adult life.&quot;

Page 267, unpublished version: &quot;And it seems to me that the
explanation of sheer political opportunism, to account for
Eisenhower's Communist-aiding career, stems merely from a deep-rooted
aversion of any American to recognizing the horrible truth. Most of
the doubters, who go all the way with me except to the final logical
conclusion, appear to have no trouble whatever in suspecting that
Milton Eisenhower is an outright Communist. Yet they draw back from
attaching the same suspicion to his brother, for no other real reason
than that one is a professor and the other a president. While I too
think that Milton Eisenhower is a Communist, and has been for thirty
years, this opinion is based largely on general circumstances of his
conduct. But my firm belief that Dwight Eisenhower is a dedicated,
conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy is based on an
accumulation of detailed evidence so extensive and so palpable that it
seems to me to put this conviction beyond any reasonable doubt.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: KOREA FALLS
&gt; &gt;&gt; Title: The New World Order Files
&gt; &gt;&gt; Author: David Allen Rivera

&gt; &gt;&gt; From 1910, until 1945, Korea was part of the Japanese empire. The
&gt; &gt;&gt; victorious World War II allies agreed that Korea should be made an
&gt; &gt;&gt; independent country, but until negotiations could take place, the U.S.
&gt; &gt;&gt; took charge of the area south of the 38th parallel, while the Soviets
&gt; &gt;&gt; occupied the northern half. Plans to establish a unified Korean
&gt; &gt;&gt; government failed, and in 1948,/ /rival governments were established:
&gt; &gt;&gt; the Communist government of Kim Il Sung in the North, and the
&gt; &gt;&gt; pro-Western government under Syngman Rhee in the South.

&gt; &gt;&gt; An officers training school, and a small arms plant was set up by the
&gt; &gt;&gt; United States. They gave the country $100,000,000 worth of military
&gt; &gt;&gt; hardware to arm the 96,000 soldiers of the South Korean armed forces. On
&gt; &gt;&gt; July 17, 1949, Owen Lattimore said: &quot;The thing to do is let South Korea
&gt; &gt;&gt; fall, but not to let it look as if we pushed it.&quot; In a memo to the
&gt; &gt; StateDepartment, he wrote: &quot;The United States should disembarrass itself as

&gt; &gt;&gt; quickly as possible from its entanglements in South Korea.&quot; In 1949/,
&gt; &gt;&gt; /the American troops were withdrawn from South Korea, and in a January
&gt; &gt;&gt; 12, 1950 speech, U.S. Secretary of State, Dean G. Acheson publicly
&gt; &gt;&gt; stated that South Korea was &quot;outside of (the U.S.) defense perimeter.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; The North Koreans, heavily equipped by the Russians, considered
&gt; &gt;&gt; Acheson's statement an invitation to attack, in order to unify the
&gt; &gt;&gt; country under communism. Gen. Douglas MacArthur had received military
&gt; &gt;&gt; intelligence reports from Gen. Charles A. Willoughby, that North Korea
&gt; &gt;&gt; was preparing for an invasion, and John Foster Dulles of the State
&gt; &gt;&gt; Department went to 'investigate,' and covered up the activity he viewed
&gt; &gt;&gt; at the 38th parallel.

&gt; &gt;&gt; On June 24, 1950, the North Koreans swarmed across the 38th parallel,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and proceeded to overrun the country. Rhee appealed to the United
&gt; &gt;&gt; States, and the United Nations for help, as the communists closed in on
&gt; &gt;&gt; the South Korean capital of Seoul.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Truman called for an immediate meeting of the United Nations Security
&gt; &gt;&gt; Council, who convened the next day, and called the attack a &quot;breach of
&gt; &gt;&gt; the peace,&quot; ordering the North Koreans to withdraw to the border. Two
&gt; &gt;&gt; days later, the Security Council called upon the UN members to furnish
&gt; &gt;&gt; assistance. Immediately the U.S. sent in ground troops and began air
&gt; &gt;&gt; strikes. On July 7, the Security Council urged 15 of the countries to
&gt; &gt;&gt; put their troops at the disposal of the United States, under the UN
&gt; &gt;&gt; command of Gen. Douglas MacArthur.

&gt; &gt;&gt; After MacArthur's amphibious assault on September 15, at Inchon Bay, UN
&gt; &gt;&gt; forces were able to recapture Seoul, and began to push the North Koreans
&gt; &gt;&gt; back across the border. In October, they captured the North Korean
&gt; &gt;&gt; capital of Pyongyang, and many communists retreated into Manchuria and
&gt; &gt;&gt; Russia. The Chinese, thinking that the security of their country was
&gt; &gt;&gt; being threatened, stormed across the border on November 26, 1950, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; stopped the UN army at the Yalu River.

&gt; &gt;&gt; With the UN being involved in the war, all U.S. battle plans had to be
&gt; &gt;&gt; submitted for approval, in advance, to the Under Secretary for Political
&gt; &gt;&gt; and Security Council Affairs. Due to a secret agreement made by
&gt; &gt;&gt; Secretary of State Edward Stettinius in 1945, this position was to
&gt; &gt;&gt; always be filled by a Communist from an eastern European country. During
&gt; &gt;&gt; the war, it was filled by Russia's Constantine Zinchenko. It was later
&gt; &gt;&gt; revealed, that Russian military advisors were actually directing the
&gt; &gt;&gt; North Korean war effort, and one of those advisors, Lt. Gen. Alexandre
&gt; &gt;&gt; Vasiliev, actually gave the order to attack. Vasiliev was the Chairman
&gt; &gt;&gt; of the UN Military Staff Committee, who along with the Under Secretary
&gt; &gt;&gt; for Political and Security Council Affairs, was responsible for all UN
&gt; &gt;&gt; military action. Vasliliev had to take a leave of absence from his
&gt; &gt;&gt; position, to command the communist troops. So, what it boiled down to,
&gt; &gt;&gt; was that the Communists were controlling both sides of the war, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; Russia was able to receive vital information concerning all troop
&gt; &gt;&gt; movements within the UN forces in Korea, which was passed on to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; North Koreans and Chinese.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The Taiwan government was planning to move against China, and Truman
&gt; &gt;&gt; warned Chiang Kai-shek not to make an attempt to recapture his homeland.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Truman ordered the American Seventh Fleet into the Strait of Formosa to
&gt; &gt;&gt; prevent any type of invasion. This freed the Red China army to enter the
&gt; &gt;&gt; Korean War. Chiang then offered to send an advance force of 33,000
&gt; &gt;&gt; troops into North Korea, but the State Department refused. They were a
&gt; &gt;&gt; member of the UN, yet the United States would not let them fight.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The Korean War, Korean Conflict, or Police Action, as it is sometimes
&gt; &gt;&gt; called, developed into a stalemate of broken cease-fire agreements, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; MacArthur made plans for a massive retaliation against China. He wanted
&gt; &gt;&gt; to bomb the ammunition and fuel dumps, the supply bases, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; communication lines to China(bridges across the Yalu River), and to post
&gt; &gt;&gt; a blockade around the Chinese coast. However, on December 5, 1950,
&gt; &gt;&gt; Truman and other Administration officials decided that this sort of
&gt; &gt;&gt; action would bring Russia into the conflict, and possibly initiate World
&gt; &gt;&gt; War III. MacArthur was ordered not to proceed with any of his plans. The
&gt; &gt;&gt; Joint Chiefs of Staff said: &quot;We felt the action urged by Gen. MacArthur
&gt; &gt;&gt; would hazard this safety (of the U.S.) without promising any certain
&gt; &gt;&gt; proportionate gain.&quot; A letter written to a Congressman, by MacArthur,
&gt; &gt;&gt; was read on the floor of the House, giving them the full story of how
&gt; &gt;&gt; much the Red Chinese were involved. Still, nothing was done. Gen. Lin
&gt; &gt;&gt; Piao, the Red Chinese commander, said later: &quot;I would never have made
&gt; &gt;&gt; the attack and risked my men and military reputation if I had not been
&gt; &gt;&gt; assured that Washington would restrain General MacArthur from taking
&gt; &gt;&gt; adequate retaliatory measures against my lines of supply and
&gt; &gt;&gt; communication.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; With MacArthur insisting that there was no substitute for victory, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; that the war against Communism would be either won or lost in Korea, he
&gt; &gt;&gt; was relieved of his command, on April 11, 1951, by Gen. Matthew B.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Ridgeway, a member of the CFR.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Air Force Commander, Gen. George Stratemeyer said: &quot;We had sufficient
&gt; &gt;&gt; air bombardment, fighters, reconnaissance so that I could have taken out
&gt; &gt;&gt; all those supplies, those airdromes on the other side of the Yalu; I
&gt; &gt;&gt; could have bombed the devils between there and Mukden, stopped the
&gt; &gt;&gt; railroad operating and the people of China that were fighting could not
&gt; &gt;&gt; have been supplied...But we weren't permitted to do it. As a result, a
&gt; &gt;&gt; lot of American blood was spilled over there in Korea.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; Gen. Stratemeyer testified before the Congress: &quot;You get in war to win
&gt; &gt;&gt; it. You do not get in war to stand still and lose it and we were
&gt; &gt;&gt; required to lose it. We were not permitted to win.&quot; Gen. Matt Clark told
