Spoiler space for recent Green Lantern stories....

I know that the Zamarons and their Star Sapphires have been featured
in recent issues of Green Lantern and/or the Green Lantern Corps, and
presumably they will be playing a major roll in the Sinestro Wars.

I also know that the way they've been presented seems to represent a
major retcon of what we've known about them before, very close to an
&quot;everything you've known is WRONG!&quot; situation.

But I haven't been able to track what is now known or implied about
their history and motives. So, on the basis of what we've been shown
to date, can anyone fill me in on:

- The histories of the Zamarons and the Star Sapphires
- What they've been trying to accomplish, and what they're trying to
accomplish now
- What major and/or significant past stories concerning them will
have to be discarded or heavily retconned

Speculations and extrapolations welcome! Let me (us) know what you
THINK is going on....

Thank you one and all.

Why do they keep changing this stuff?  Is it now too politically incorrect
to even imagine a group of alien &quot;guardians&quot; who don't also include females
somehow?

I haven't been this sad since the day they decided to invent a black
vulcan out of nowhere, despite the fact that Gene Roddenberry was on the
record saying &quot;There are no black vulcans.&quot;

I can't speak to any recent retcons, but here's what I know that was
current as of, say the Millennium series.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - The histories of the Zamarons and the Star Sapphires
">

The Zamarons have been the female Guardians for a long time.  Dunno if
they were always that, or if it was a retcon early on, but they've been the
distaff branch of the family for decades real-world-time.  The Star Sapphire
was originally given to their queen, who by tradition had to be a
non-Zamaron.  Yep, they outsourced their rulership.  Of course, being
functionally immortal, I suppose it would make sense to give the job to a
mortal to avoid stagnation and complacency.  Carol Ferris was the latest
choice for the job, which came with its own personality graft.
Carol also ended up the host for another entity, the Predator, a male
hunter sort.  In one of the weirder events of the 1990s, the Predator got
Star Sapphire pregnant and they had a kid.  I forget what happened to the
kid, and I expect everyone at DC has as well.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - What they've been trying to accomplish, and what they're trying to
&gt;accomplish now
">

For the most part, they just didn't like the Guardians and looked for
opportunities to mess with the Green Lanterns.  Not on the &quot;destroy them
all!&quot; level (usually), more like an unfriendly rivalry.  Where the Guardians
were fuddy duddy patriarch types, the Zamarons were space-Amazons, with the
attendant &quot;see each other as deluded fools&quot; outlooks.
Eventually, the Guardians and Zamarons reached approachment during
Millennium and went off to engage in cosmic nookie or something.  Then
Parallax happened, but let's not go into that too deeply.  At some point
later on, Ion/Kyle Rayner brought back the Guardians as children, but it
included females, implying that he brought back pre-split Zamarons as Oans.
One Oan girl ended up rapidly aging to adulthood and taking on a rather
Zamaron outlook, but kept her blue skin (Zamarons are caucasoid).  Around
then I drifted away from GL again.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - What major and/or significant past stories concerning them will
&gt;have to be discarded or heavily retconned
">

Can't say, but if there's supposed to be multiple Star Sapphires and
always have been, your answer is probably &quot;all of them need to be retconned
or discarded.&quot;  The Star Sapphire was their queen, singular and serially
unique.
However, if it's revealed that the SS Corps is a new invention, then it
might not be necesary to retcon very much, if anything.  They'd just have
decided that the SS power set is useful enough to merit handing out to people
other than their queen, or they just figured out how to make more than one.
After all, Sinestro used to be a singleton too, until they figured out how to
make more yellow rings.

Dave Van Domelen, thinks Carol Ferris and Betty Banner should form a
support group.

Actually, it was Kyle Rayner...he absorbed the Parallax power to
become Ion the first time (which included the individual essences of
the dead guardians) and he used the power to restore the central power
battery and the guardians, who were reborn as children to be watched
over by Ganthet...I think Kyle said something about giving them the
forms that &quot;felt right&quot; or something...I don't remember exactly.

I don't see the harm in female guardians or black vulcans...it really
makes no difference to past stories and we aren't talking about
suddenly altering specific characters...it's not like Ganthet is
suddenly a girl or Spock has been retconned as black.

T'was Kyle, as I recall.  Ganthet asked him why, and he responds that
having lady Guardians may give the group a better perspective, as the
old boys club clearly didn't have a stellar track record.

Or something like that.  It's in the arc where Kyle restored the
central power battery and pulled the Guardians from the ether.

Wow. That made you very sad? How upset were you the first time you saw
an Asian Vulcan?

Tuvok surprised me a bit, and then I thought:

Humans have five fingers on each hand. Vulcans have five fingers on
each hand. No one sees this as strange.

Humans have two genders (give or take some unusual cases). Vulcans
have two genders. No one complains.

Humans speak using vocal chords in their throats. Vulcans speak using
vocal chords in their throats. There is no outcry.

Humans come in a variety of complexions, including darker and lighter
versions. Vulcans come in a variety of complexions, including darker
and lighter versions.

OH NO! That's so &quot;P.C.&quot;! It's ridiculous! Just too much of a
coincidence to make any sense at all! They're ruining my show and
abandoning science fiction so they can shove their left-wing politics
down my throats!

And so on... (some of it a good deal worse).

If ANYONE can explain to me how to chalk up the objection to a black
Vulcan (when nobody ever objected to a 10-fingered Vulcan) as anything
other than rampant racism, please let me know.

OhioGuy, I did a Google search to try to find Gene Roddenberry on
record as saying there were no black Vulcans. I was unable to locate
such a quote. Please provide a citation.

I was, however, able to find this:

&quot;There have been a few minor appearances of
black Vulcanoids in the background:  the Vulcan midwife in the
memory of Spock's birth in _Star Trek V: The Final Frontier_ was
black, and there have been black Romulans in TNG 'The Pegasus' and
DS9 'The Die is Cast'.  However, Tuvok is the first instance of
a black Vulcan in a starring role.&quot;

I was also able to find a large number of outrageously racist
comments, many of which used the phrase &quot;n----r Vulcan.&quot; Or do you
find it too P.C. of me that I don't want to write out the whole N-word
in a public comic-book forum?

Especially since this throws out one of the main points of MILLENNIUM back
in the day -- namely that the Guardians are, in fact, the male half of a
specie (to which the Zamorans are the other half).

Of all the horrible, stupid, pointless, series-wrecking things about that
&quot;event&quot; DC could have chosen to retcon away (gimme back my damned pre-
Pocket-Universe Laurel Kent), this is what they choose?

It may also be that the personality implant is something that's

been any before, but there were now, because Kyle thought it

You mean like Leonard Nimoy was a white human actor portraying a
Vulcan on the show? I don't remember them explaining that. I think
this is a made-up problem.

Guinan was the first El-Aurian on Star Trek, and she was black. When
Torian Solan came along, I don't remember a lot of people up in arms
because no one &quot;explained&quot; that he was just a white human actor
(Malcolm McDowell) PLAYING an El-Aurian.

Are you sure you are not misremembering? Because Star Trek happens to
be one of the most heavily documented subjects on the web, the
arguments over Tuvok were long and ugly, and it's hard for me to
believe that such a definitive statement from Gene Roddenberry
wouldn't be available on some web site somewhere.

Star Trek was not exactly a perfect model of consistency even during
his day, and his quote - if it ever existed - sounds like a throwaway
line. There was nothing IN THE SHOWS requiring no black Vulcans, so I
can hardly see it as an inconsistency. And since it doesn't add
anything important to the Vulcan backstory, I have no reason to
believe that Roddenberry - a liberal who was against racial
discrimination - would stick to it when somebody pointed out that it
was preventing them from hiring black actors who could do a good job.

(In fact, from what I know about Roddenberry, it's hard for me to
imagine a context under which he said it at all. Yours is the only
reference I have EVER heard to it.)

Oh, yes, the &quot;feminists&quot; who have so much power over the content of
comic books. As far as I can see, they're crowding the poor,
unprotected male writers, artists, and editors right out of the
office! Now that they've done away with all the T&amp;A artwork, put a
stop to the victimized-woman-motivates-male-hero storylines (the ones
that are always about the male reactions to crimes against women,
rather than treating the women as primary characters in their own
right), and gotten the &quot;Wonder Woman family&quot; as many monthly books as
the &quot;Batman family,&quot; who KNOWS what nefarious changes they will force
on us next?

&quot;Feminists,&quot; as such, have little or no direct impact on comics. Did
it ever even occur to you that the writer, Judd Winnick, thought it
might be an INTERESTING CHANGE to introduce female Guardians into the
mix, one that he imagined could lead to different story hooks and
characterization than the same-old-same-old? That is, that it was an
authorial decision made without &quot;outraged feminists&quot; breathing down
his neck?

If you could find me a single quote by a &quot;feminist&quot; fan who was
&quot;outraged&quot; that &quot;such a powerful group had no female members,&quot; I would
be very, very impressed indeed. Just one, from before the Winnick
story. If not, then I think you're engaging in what is called &quot;making
up a strawman&quot; (sorry, strawperson) - that is, inventing the
statements and attitudes of some imaginary &quot;feminists&quot; so that you can
blame them for something you don't like.

But I'm sure you can find me that quote.

P.S. All sarcasm aside, it's worth noting that the reason that all the
Guardians were originally male is simply this: sexism was entrenched
and largely unquestioned in the 1950's/1960's, when they were
introduced. Plain and simple.

The Guardians were scientifically advanced, serious authority figures
undertaking a great task. Of COURSE they were all men. What would a
female Guardian do - take notes? Bring coffee?

Okay, that's a little sarcastic, but I'm not kidding. Remember that
when Wonder Woman joined the JSA - as their only female member - she
was their &quot;secretary.&quot;

A female Guardian (much less many female Guardians) would just have
looked out of place to the people of the time. Take a look at any shot
of the Krypton Science Council from the same era: all men.

Well, that was then. But the problem is, in a serial medium like
superhero comics, the unquestioned sexism of that era can be
perpetuated, not just by people who are actively sexist themselves,
but by anybody who just doesn't think about the question. You just
keep drawing the Guardians the way they used to be joined, and the
assumption that they are all male - with all its implications and
messages about the place of women - gets copied over into today's
comics.

Does that mean that you should suddenly make half the Guardians
female? Not necessarily. (Although it's worth noting that the author
who did that made it part of a storyline, based on a character's
decision. It wasn't just a proclamation or a retcon.)

But it does mean that people should question the inherited judgements
and assumptions of past eras, and make sure that they're not
recreating sexism or other prejudices where it's not necessary to do
so. Have a little sensitivity. Most of our grandparents were sexists,
simply because of the times they lived in; we don't have to blame them
for it, but we don't have to continue it either.

I don't really care whether half the Guardians were recreated female
or not. (And I think that the decision to bring them back as BABIES
was wrong, wrong, wrong!) But I do think that, in the recent
retconning of the Zamorans and the Star Sapphires, DC screwed up a
very big opportunity to replace the sexism of the past with something
a little more nuanced.

I mean, look at the new Star Sapphires: they entice Green Lanterns
into mating with them, kill them, and smother their planets into
stasis. It's hard to imagine a more concentrated dose of misogynistic
stereotypes: the black widow, vagina dentata, the &quot;smothering&quot; female
who takes away all freedom. (Why, it's Dave Sims' dream date!) Is
there no way they could have put some intelligence and decency into
these &quot;female Green Lanterns&quot; and &quot;female Guardians&quot;? Admittedly, even
the Oan Guardians are no great prize these days - but over the years
we've seen them as good, well-intentioned, and doing important things
to save the universe, as WELL as kind of dumb (just for Idiot Plot
purposes) and passive. The Zamarons have never even had a chance.

You're not wrong, but it wasn't inevitable.  Doc Smith's prototype for the
Oans, the Arisians, were often thought of as male by humans who interacted
with them, but in fact they were never seen, and the occasional woman who
got to Arisia sometimes perceived them as female.  Their successors, the
Children of the Lens, were in fact mostly female.

James Schmitz, another writer of the period, wrote mostly stories with
powerful and dynamic female protagonists, notably Telzey Amberdon, Trigger
Argee, and the witches of Karres.

My point being that the all-male nature of the Guardians really was
optional.

Let's not forget that in GL in that bygone era we had a very capable
woman running an aircraft manufacturing company.  Lois Lane was being
written as a scheming bitch who was always trying to prove that Clark
was Superman.  But in earlier times she was a hard hitting reporter
who just wasn't up to beating the super bad guys without a bit of help
from Superman.

Lots of women were being written as tough girls both in fiction and in
movies in the forties.  Look at Pat Savage.   In real life there were
lots of women doing men's jobs in WWII and being portrayed as tough.
Somehow the guys coming home from war must have submerged those
depictions during the fifties.

So the perception was apparently always gender based.  Somehow,
though, the writing of the Arisian side of a conversation always came
across as male to me.  I don't recall the interaction between the
Children of the Lens and the Arisians, but Clarissa MacDougal's
account of her meeting with Mentor was second hand and brief.  We
never got to see if Mentor's demeanor matched his/her appearance.

In general I'd say that the Arisians were genderless, being pure
mentality.  I'd say it would be hard to assign a gender to something
that didn't have a physicality.

A civilization that lacks females would not be a group of men.  Such a
society would not fit either sex.  They would either be hermaphrodites
or engage in asexual reproduction.  In neither case would they be males.
I also read a book once where there was an alien species that had three
sexes (none of which were male or female), and it required all three
together to reproduce.  *That* is imagination.

It took absolutely no imagination, in the 1960's, to make the
Guardians - who were, after all, basically a &quot;science council&quot; - all
male. It would have been a REAL act of imagination to make them all
female.

Ugh.  The really sad thing is DC by 1977 had created viable minority

Instead of Super Chief or even Owlwoman we got Apache Chief aka

&gt; I also know that the way they've been presented seems to represent a

&gt;  - The histories of the Zamarons and the Star Sapphires

&gt; Speculations and extrapolations welcome! Let me (us) know what you
&gt; THINK is going on....

&gt; Thank you one and all.
">

Well, without reading what others have said so far...

The result, I think, is more of an &quot;everything we've told you is a LIE!&quot;
situation. It *finally* resolves the deal with the non-Carol Secret
Society of Super-Villains Star Sapphire in a fairly tidy fashion, with
the relationship at the end of Millennium being the only casualty I can
think of ... and you *might* be able to shoehorn that in somehow, though
I'm not altogether keen on doing so (especially the &quot;incompatible
symbiotes&quot; bit).

With that in mind, here's what I see as being the &quot;true&quot; history of the
Zamarons. They were a group of Oans who disagreed with the Guardians,
and presumably their brethren the Controllers, about how to deal with
the whole Krona thing (although the &quot;origin of Parallax&quot; at the end of
Countdown #35 this week implies that they may have been at the game for
more reasons than that). Presumably the Controllers wanted to take an
active, almost dictatorial, role in things. The Guardians chose logic.
The Zamarons chose emotions, presumably in spite of the Parallax entity.
They left, looking for inspiration and a focus for their power, and
found it in mysterious purple crystals that had consumed what they
presumed were two lovers joined forever in death. The purple crystals
had the ability to focus some form of emotional energy, much like the
Guardians' rings, though with some form of possession involved. The
&quot;Sapphires&quot; became their power ring equivalents, although their sole
purpose was to spread &quot;eternal love&quot; through them; the Sapphires would
possess a female that was attracted to a planet's Green Lantern, bond
with him, and thereby consume him; the crystal would then spread
throughout the planet, entombing them in love.

When they went after Earth's GL (Hal Jordan), they had to play down some
of the aspects of all this, as perhaps they did everywhere they went.
They created the fiction of wanting a queen, and Carol Ferris just
happened to resemble their last queen. Their purpose was to entomb &quot;in
love&quot; Earth, striking back at their own spurned lovers, the Guardians,
in the process.

Like I said earlier, the Millennium storyline is probably the most
vulnerable to the new status quo. Even then, though, it could work.
Perhaps the whole &quot;incompatible symbiote&quot; thing was yet another fiction,
or perhaps there was some truth there that both groups chose to ignore
initially. Perhaps the Zamarons that went with the original Guardians
were actually the female Guardians themselves, or perhaps the Guardians
that returned, except perhaps for Ganthet, were actually the offspring
of those ... heck, maybe these new Zamarons were, too. Or maybe it's
just not worth trying to shoehorn in Millennium after all, since it
eventually became a non-event except for Gloss, Jet, and Ram (although
their presence, and death in the latter case, really isn't worth keeping
all the baggage around anyhow).

&gt; &gt;You're not wrong, but it wasn't inevitable.  Doc Smith's prototype for the

&gt; &gt;with them, but in fact they were never seen, and the occasional woman who
&gt; &gt;got to Arisia sometimes perceived them as female.  Their successors, the
&gt; &gt;Children of the Lens, were in fact mostly female.

&gt; &gt;James Schmitz, another writer of the period, wrote mostly stories with
&gt; &gt;powerful and dynamic female protagonists, notably Telzey Amberdon, Trigger
&gt; &gt;Argee, and the witches of Karres.

&gt; &gt;My point being that the all-male nature of the Guardians really was
&gt; &gt;optional.

&gt; &gt;P.S. All sarcasm aside, it's worth noting that the reason that all the

&gt; &gt;Okay, that's a little sarcastic, but I'm not kidding. Remember that
&gt; &gt;when Wonder Woman joined the JSA - as their only female member - she
&gt; &gt;was their &quot;secretary.&quot;

&gt; &gt;A female Guardian (much less many female Guardians) would just have
&gt; &gt;looked out of place to the people of the time. Take a look at any shot
&gt; &gt;of the Krypton Science Council from the same era: all men.

&gt; &gt;Well, that was then. But the problem is, in a serial medium like
&gt; &gt;superhero comics, the unquestioned sexism of that era can be
&gt; &gt;perpetuated, not just by people who are actively sexist themselves,
&gt; &gt;but by anybody who just doesn't think about the question. You just
&gt; &gt;keep drawing the Guardians the way they used to be joined, and the
&gt; &gt;assumption that they are all male - with all its implications and
&gt; &gt;messages about the place of women - gets copied over into today's
&gt; &gt;comics.

&gt; &gt;Does that mean that you should suddenly make half the Guardians
&gt; &gt;female? Not necessarily. (Although it's worth noting that the author
&gt; &gt;who did that made it part of a storyline, based on a character's
&gt; &gt;decision. It wasn't just a proclamation or a retcon.)

&gt; &gt;But it does mean that people should question the inherited judgements
&gt; &gt;and assumptions of past eras, and make sure that they're not
&gt; &gt;recreating sexism or other prejudices where it's not necessary to do
&gt; &gt;so. Have a little sensitivity. Most of our grandparents were sexists,
&gt; &gt;simply because of the times they lived in; we don't have to blame them
&gt; &gt;for it, but we don't have to continue it either.

&gt; &gt;I don't really care whether half the Guardians were recreated female
&gt; &gt;or not. (And I think that the decision to bring them back as BABIES
&gt; &gt;was wrong, wrong, wrong!) But I do think that, in the recent
&gt; &gt;retconning of the Zamorans and the Star Sapphires, DC screwed up a
&gt; &gt;very big opportunity to replace the sexism of the past with something
&gt; &gt;a little more nuanced.

&gt; &gt;I mean, look at the new Star Sapphires: they entice Green Lanterns
&gt; &gt;into mating with them, kill them, and smother their planets into
&gt; &gt;stasis. It's hard to imagine a more concentrated dose of misogynistic
&gt; &gt;stereotypes: the black widow, vagina dentata, the &quot;smothering&quot; female
&gt; &gt;who takes away all freedom. (Why, it's Dave Sims' dream date!) Is
&gt; &gt;there no way they could have put some intelligence and decency into
&gt; &gt;these &quot;female Green Lanterns&quot; and &quot;female Guardians&quot;? Admittedly, even
&gt; &gt;the Oan Guardians are no great prize these days - but over the years
&gt; &gt;we've seen them as good, well-intentioned, and doing important things
&gt; &gt;to save the universe, as WELL as kind of dumb (just for Idiot Plot
&gt; &gt;purposes) and passive. The Zamarons have never even had a chance.

&gt; Let's not forget that in GL in that bygone era we had a very capable
&gt; woman running an aircraft manufacturing company.  Lois Lane was being
&gt; written as a scheming bitch who was always trying to prove that Clark
&gt; was Superman.  But in earlier times she was a hard hitting reporter
&gt; who just wasn't up to beating the super bad guys without a bit of help
&gt; from Superman.

&gt; Lots of women were being written as tough girls both in fiction and in
&gt; movies in the forties.  Look at Pat Savage.   In real life there were
&gt; lots of women doing men's jobs in WWII and being portrayed as tough.
&gt; Somehow the guys coming home from war must have submerged those
&gt; depictions during the fifties.

&gt; --
&gt; Lilith
">

Very perceptive Lilith. The return of soldiers after WWII created the
&quot;picture perfect&quot; 50s where everyone knew their place and everything was
just dandy and neato. It was a society's reaction to the horror of the war
years. men could be the head of the household and play footbal with their
sons, and women could be wives and monthers without the responsibility of
keeping industry going. (Of course, this was a particularly American
phenomenon - reflected in other English-speaking countries. Not everyone
lived that illusion in the rest of the world)

Logically. It could be viewed that the Guardians mistakes and arrogance that
Hal bucked against in the early 70s was precisely because of the lack of
balance in their perspective. Balance has always been important in rational
thinking in comics.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; P.S. All sarcasm aside, it's worth noting that the reason that all the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Guardians were originally male is simply this: sexism was entrenched
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and largely unquestioned in the 1950's/1960's, when they were
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; introduced. Plain and simple.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The Guardians were scientifically advanced, serious authority figures
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; undertaking a great task. Of COURSE they were all men. What would a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; female Guardian do - take notes? Bring coffee?

&gt;&gt; &gt;You're not wrong, but it wasn't inevitable.  Doc Smith's prototype for the
&gt;&gt; &gt;Oans, the Arisians, were often thought of as male by humans who interacted
&gt;&gt; &gt;with them, but in fact they were never seen, and the occasional woman who
&gt;&gt; &gt;got to Arisia sometimes perceived them as female.  Their successors, the
&gt;&gt; &gt;Children of the Lens, were in fact mostly female.

&gt;&gt; &gt;James Schmitz, another writer of the period, wrote mostly stories with
&gt;&gt; &gt;powerful and dynamic female protagonists, notably Telzey Amberdon, Trigger
&gt;&gt; &gt;Argee, and the witches of Karres.

&gt;&gt; &gt;My point being that the all-male nature of the Guardians really was
&gt;&gt; &gt;optional.

&gt; &gt; &gt; in recent issues of Green Lantern and/or the Green Lantern Corps, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; presumably they will be playing a major roll in the Sinestro Wars.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I also know that the way they've been presented seems to represent a
&gt; &gt; &gt; major retcon of what we've known about them before, very close to an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;everything you've known is WRONG!&quot; situation.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But I haven't been able to track what is now known or implied about
&gt; &gt; &gt; their history and motives. So, on the basis of what we've been shown
&gt; &gt; &gt; to date, can anyone fill me in on:

&gt; &gt; &gt;  - The histories of the Zamarons and the Star Sapphires
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - What they've been trying to accomplish, and what they're trying to
&gt; &gt; &gt; accomplish now
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - What major and/or significant past stories concerning them will
&gt; &gt; &gt; have to be discarded or heavily retconned

&gt; &gt; &gt; Speculations and extrapolations welcome! Let me (us) know what you
&gt; &gt; &gt; THINK is going on....

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you one and all.

&gt; &gt; Well, without reading what others have said so far...

&gt; &gt; The result, I think, is more of an &quot;everything we've told you is a LIE!&quot;
&gt; &gt; situation. It *finally* resolves the deal with the non-Carol Secret
&gt; &gt; Society of Super-Villains Star Sapphire in a fairly tidy fashion, with
&gt; &gt; the relationship at the end of Millennium being the only casualty I can
&gt; &gt; think of ... and you *might* be able to shoehorn that in somehow, though
&gt; &gt; I'm not altogether keen on doing so (especially the &quot;incompatible
&gt; &gt; symbiotes&quot; bit).

&gt; &gt; With that in mind, here's what I see as being the &quot;true&quot; history of the
&gt; &gt; Zamarons. They were a group of Oans who disagreed with the Guardians,
&gt; &gt; and presumably their brethren the Controllers, about how to deal with
&gt; &gt; the whole Krona thing (although the &quot;origin of Parallax&quot; at the end of
&gt; &gt; Countdown #35 this week implies that they may have been at the game for
&gt; &gt; more reasons than that). Presumably the Controllers wanted to take an
&gt; &gt; active, almost dictatorial, role in things. The Guardians chose logic.
&gt; &gt; The Zamarons chose emotions, presumably in spite of the Parallax entity.
&gt; &gt; They left, looking for inspiration and a focus for their power, and
&gt; &gt; found it in mysterious purple crystals that had consumed what they
&gt; &gt; presumed were two lovers joined forever in death. The purple crystals
&gt; &gt; had the ability to focus some form of emotional energy, much like the
&gt; &gt; Guardians' rings, though with some form of possession involved. The
&gt; &gt; &quot;Sapphires&quot; became their power ring equivalents, although their sole
&gt; &gt; purpose was to spread &quot;eternal love&quot; through them; the Sapphires would
&gt; &gt; possess a female that was attracted to a planet's Green Lantern, bond
&gt; &gt; with him, and thereby consume him; the crystal would then spread
&gt; &gt; throughout the planet, entombing them in love.

&gt; &gt; When they went after Earth's GL (Hal Jordan), they had to play down some
&gt; &gt; of the aspects of all this, as perhaps they did everywhere they went.
&gt; &gt; They created the fiction of wanting a queen, and Carol Ferris just
&gt; &gt; happened to resemble their last queen. Their purpose was to entomb &quot;in
&gt; &gt; love&quot; Earth, striking back at their own spurned lovers, the Guardians,
&gt; &gt; in the process.

&gt; &gt; Like I said earlier, the Millennium storyline is probably the most
&gt; &gt; vulnerable to the new status quo. Even then, though, it could work.

It *is* an obtrusive coincidence to me if an alien species has exactly

in Star Trek, too).

I seem to recall seeing, perhaps in TV Guide or something, that Tuvok
wasn't supposed to be a &quot;black Vulcan&quot;, but a &quot;green Vulcan&quot; played by
a black actor.  Which makes perfect sense to me.  Same as how Worf was
played by a black actor, and K'Ehleyr was played by a white actress,
but they weren't supposed to be &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; Klingons, just
Klingons.

Unless they are introduced as all male, like the Guardians were. (By
the way, since all multicellular life on earth is related by
evolution, the fact that most have two sexes may just be the way
evolution went on earth. To extrapolate from that single data point to
other worlds is a convenience.)

But don't you see that this is EXACTLY the same issue as Vulcans
having five fingers and voice boxes? If you are going to have human
actors play Vulcans, you either have to (a) exclude all non-white
actors from the casting process, or (b) wind up with Vulcans that
appear to have the same spread of &quot;races&quot; as human beings. And why
would anyone in their right mind WANT to do (a)?

It's exactly the same artisitic license that produces human-looking
aliens in general.

I mean, look at this: Vulcan women wear their hair longer than Vulcan
men!  Isn't that an even worse &quot;obtrusive coincidence,&quot; in which the
styles common to modern-day U.S. culture not only extended to Star
Trek-future human culture, but to Star Trek-future Vulcan culture as
well! (And you could &quot;fix&quot; it without limiting your casting - just
have the actors cut their hair differently.)

Were you outraged the first time you saw a Vulcan female, and saw that
she had long hair? Didn't it seem far to coincidental to make sense?
If not, why not?

(Maybe you thought &quot;Since most cultures on Earth have two sexes, with
the women wearing their hair longer than the men, I think it's
reasonable to assume that's the most evolutionarily stable state, so
most aliens have two sexes, with the women wearing their hair longer
than the men.&quot;)

Most of the &quot;alien cultures&quot; portrayed in Star Trek have traits that
make them look very much like contemporary American culture. When they
depict family lives, you almost always see one-husband/one-wife
families, with the couple raising their own biological children, and
so on, and so on. (There are rare exceptions.) Considering that there
have been many real-world Earth-human cultures for which this isn't
true, this represents a very strong &quot;obtrusive coincidence&quot; that the
writers made use of for convenience's sake. When you found out that
Vulcan men take a single wife (rather than, say, practice polygamy),
were you anoyed because this was so unnecessarily close to &quot;human&quot;?

Then how in the world can you get upset when they decide to let a
black actor play a Vulcan? Do you really want to claim that that's
&quot;too much like humans&quot; to be acceptable to you?

It was ALREADY an &quot;obtrusive coincidence&quot; that the &quot;racial&quot; traits of
Vulcans played by white actors matched human Caucasians so closely.
Letting a black actor play a Vulcan doesn't really make this worse.
Human actor, plays alien character, carries with him some visually
human characteristics that might not be present in a cartoon or a
novel. That's been true of Star Trek (and many other shows besides)
from Day 1.

WITHIN THE SHOW, they never made a big deal out of Tuvok being black.
I don't think they ever even called him a &quot;black Vulcan.&quot; There was no
indication that Vulcan had racial politics that resembled modern-day
real-life Earth. If you wanted to think of the actor as &quot;a black actor
playing a green Vulcan&quot; - or for that matter if you wanted to think of
Leonard Nimoy as a &quot;Jewish actor playing a green Vulcan&quot; - you were
perfectly free to. I simply do not understand why - with all the
physical and cultural similarities between humans and Vulcans, may of
which were simply &quot;artisitic license,&quot; and not required by the science-
fiction framework of the show (or even, in some cases, going against
that framework) - the introduction of one more (a black actor playing
a Vulcan, suggesting that Vulcans have races much like humans, just as
Vulcans have gender-specific hair customs much like humans) would
bother you, or anyone, in the least. Much less &quot;outrage&quot; you.

Actually, it has very little to do with dark-skinned humans and more to do
with the spread of skin colour in AMERICA and its sociopolitical mix - very
difficult to see clearly from inside the US BTW. It cannot be denied that
Americans exert a lot of pressure on their media to see a representative mix
of what they see on the streets. There is absolutely no in-story reason for
a spectrum of skin colours in Vulcans, and probably quite a few for not,
given what we know about Vulcan. For most of us, it was just annoying, when
some much pain has been taken to establish &quot;facts&quot; about various alien
races.

And outrage is not too great a word to describe the reaction to a
meaningless retcon of a beloved fantasy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tuvok surprised me a bit, and then I thought:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Humans have five fingers on each hand. Vulcans have five fingers on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each hand. No one sees this as strange.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  [...]
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Humans speak using vocal chords in their throats. Vulcans speak using
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vocal chords in their throats. There is no outcry.

&gt; &gt; &gt; That's just necessary artistic license if the characters are going to
&gt; &gt; &gt; be played by human actors.  You can have an occasional Vorlon or
&gt; &gt; &gt; Horta, but I don't think a show could keep its audience if those are
&gt; &gt; &gt; the *main* characters.  Same reason every spaceship has perfectly
&gt; &gt; &gt; functioning artificial gravity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Humans have two genders (give or take some unusual cases). Vulcans
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have two genders. No one complains.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Since most multicellular species on Earth have two sexes, I think it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; reasonable to assume that's the most evolutionarily stable state, so
&gt; &gt; &gt; most aliens have two sexes.

&gt; &gt; Unless they are introduced as all male, like the Guardians were. (By
&gt; &gt; the way, since all multicellular life on earth is related by
&gt; &gt; evolution, the fact that most have two sexes may just be the way
&gt; &gt; evolution went on earth. To extrapolate from that single data point to
&gt; &gt; other worlds is a convenience.)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Humans come in a variety of complexions, including darker and lighter
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; versions. Vulcans come in a variety of complexions, including darker
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and lighter versions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OH NO! That's so &quot;P.C.&quot;! It's ridiculous! Just too much of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coincidence to make any sense at all! They're ruining my show and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; abandoning science fiction so they can shove their left-wing politics
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down my throats!

&gt; &gt; &gt; It *is* an obtrusive coincidence to me if an alien species has exactly
&gt; &gt; &gt; the same racial groups as humans.  If aliens have races, there are
&gt; &gt; &gt; zillions of ways they could differ that don't exactly mimic human
&gt; &gt; &gt; races, e.g. some could have spots and some don't (they did this
&gt; &gt; &gt; in Star Trek, too).

&gt; &gt; But don't you see that this is EXACTLY the same issue as Vulcans
&gt; &gt; having five fingers and voice boxes? If you are going to have human
&gt; &gt; actors play Vulcans, you either have to (a) exclude all non-white
&gt; &gt; actors from the casting process, or (b) wind up with Vulcans that
&gt; &gt; appear to have the same spread of &quot;races&quot; as human beings. And why
&gt; &gt; would anyone in their right mind WANT to do (a)?

&gt; &gt; It's exactly the same artisitic license that produces human-looking
&gt; &gt; aliens in general.

&gt; &gt; I mean, look at this: Vulcan women wear their hair longer than Vulcan
&gt; &gt; men!  Isn't that an even worse &quot;obtrusive coincidence,&quot; in which the
&gt; &gt; styles common to modern-day U.S. culture not only extended to Star
&gt; &gt; Trek-future human culture, but to Star Trek-future Vulcan culture as
&gt; &gt; well! (And you could &quot;fix&quot; it without limiting your casting - just
&gt; &gt; have the actors cut their hair differently.)

&gt; &gt; Were you outraged the first time you saw a Vulcan female, and saw that
&gt; &gt; she had long hair? Didn't it seem far to coincidental to make sense?
&gt; &gt; If not, why not?

&gt; &gt; (Maybe you thought &quot;Since most cultures on Earth have two sexes, with
&gt; &gt; the women wearing their hair longer than the men, I think it's
&gt; &gt; reasonable to assume that's the most evolutionarily stable state, so
&gt; &gt; most aliens have two sexes, with the women wearing their hair longer
&gt; &gt; than the men.&quot;)

&gt; &gt; Most of the &quot;alien cultures&quot; portrayed in Star Trek have traits that
&gt; &gt; make them look very much like contemporary American culture. When they
&gt; &gt; depict family lives, you almost always see one-husband/one-wife
&gt; &gt; families, with the couple raising their own biological children, and
&gt; &gt; so on, and so on. (There are rare exceptions.) Considering that there
&gt; &gt; have been many real-world Earth-human cultures for which this isn't
&gt; &gt; true, this represents a very strong &quot;obtrusive coincidence&quot; that the
&gt; &gt; writers made use of for convenience's sake. When you found out that
&gt; &gt; Vulcan men take a single wife (rather than, say, practice polygamy),
&gt; &gt; were you anoyed because this was so unnecessarily close to &quot;human&quot;?

&gt; &gt; Then how in the world can you get upset when they decide to let a
&gt; &gt; black actor play a Vulcan? Do you really want to claim that that's
&gt; &gt; &quot;too much like humans&quot; to be acceptable to you?

&gt; &gt; It was ALREADY an &quot;obtrusive coincidence&quot; that the &quot;racial&quot; traits of
&gt; &gt; Vulcans played by white actors matched human Caucasians so closely.
&gt; &gt; Letting a black actor play a Vulcan doesn't really make this worse.
&gt; &gt; Human actor, plays alien character, carries with him some visually
&gt; &gt; human characteristics that might not be present in a cartoon or a
&gt; &gt; novel. That's been true of Star Trek (and many other shows besides)
&gt; &gt; from Day 1.

&gt; &gt; WITHIN THE SHOW, they never made a big deal out of Tuvok being black.
&gt; &gt; I don't think they ever even called him a &quot;black Vulcan.&quot; There was no
&gt; &gt; indication that Vulcan had racial politics that resembled modern-day
&gt; &gt; real-life Earth. If you wanted to think of the actor as &quot;a black actor
&gt; &gt; playing a green Vulcan&quot; - or for that matter if you wanted to think of
&gt; &gt; Leonard Nimoy as a &quot;Jewish actor playing a green Vulcan&quot; - you were
&gt; &gt; perfectly free to. I simply do not understand why - with all the
&gt; &gt; physical and cultural similarities between humans and Vulcans, may of
&gt; &gt; which were simply &quot;artisitic license,&quot; and not required by the science-
&gt; &gt; fiction framework of the show (or even, in some cases, going against
&gt; &gt; that framework) - the introduction of one more (a black actor playing
&gt; &gt; a Vulcan, suggesting that Vulcans have races much like humans, just as
&gt; &gt; Vulcans have gender-specific hair customs much like humans) would
&gt; &gt; bother you, or anyone, in the least. Much less &quot;outrage&quot; you.

&gt; Actually, it has very little to do with dark-skinned humans and more to do
&gt; with the spread of skin colour in AMERICA and its sociopolitical mix - very
&gt; difficult to see clearly from inside the US BTW. It cannot be denied that
&gt; Americans exert a lot of pressure on their media to see a representative mix
&gt; of what they see on the streets. There is absolutely no in-story reason for
&gt; a spectrum of skin colours in Vulcans, and probably quite a few for not,
&gt; given what we know about Vulcan.
">

There is absolutely no in-story reason why Vulcans should use the same
gender-related signifiers for hair length (short for men, long for
women) that current-day U.S. uses. It's just a consequence of
&quot;pressure&quot; (more precisely, &quot;expectations&quot;) from the audience. It is
an intrusive coincidence. Where is your outrage?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; For most of us, it was just annoying, when
&gt; some much pain has been taken to establish &quot;facts&quot; about various alien
&gt; races.
">

Exactly what pains did they go to, and what facts did they establish,
that would prevent the existence of dark-complexioned Vulcans? The
first Vulcans we saw were white. Then we saw a few Asians. Then some
blacks. None of this contradicted ANYTHING that was presented &quot;in-
story.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And outrage is not too great a word to describe the reaction to a
&gt; meaningless retcon of a beloved fantasy.
">

And how upset were you that the first El-Aurian we saw was black, and
the second one was white?

After all these years I am still astonished by the convoluted lengths
people will go to to explain why a black Vulcan was &quot;unacceptable&quot; and
&quot;outrageous,&quot; while easily accepting the many other &quot;obtrusive
coincidences&quot; that can be found throughout Star Trek.

The female Guardians first showed up when Kyle Rayner used up the last
of his Ion powers to resurrect Oa. (GL #150, by Ron Marz)

So back then, it was probably a novel idea to have male and female
Guardians, since the Zamarons will probably MIA and not on the plate
to be referred to anymore or something; and there was no race of Star
Sapphires like there is now. Plus Kyle probably wasn't aware it used
to be an all-male thing and thus just brought them back as both.

No, he was aware. I think he decided they might be more &quot;balanced&quot; his
way.

The Zamarons weren't actually &quot;not on the plate,&quot; and in fact were
soon brought in the help Ganthet raise the L'il Oans. However, either
Kyle or the author (or both) did not seem to be thinking about them
when Kyle brought back the Oans, because they certainly deserved a
mention in the decision-making process, even if Kyle had ultimately
come to the same decision.
