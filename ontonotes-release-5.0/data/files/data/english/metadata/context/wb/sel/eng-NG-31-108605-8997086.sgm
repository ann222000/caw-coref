What kind of firepower can a civilian ship legally carry?

For this arguments purpose assume it is transporting a valuable cargo such
as gold and that it's mission is squeaky clean.

Certainly small arms.

Many merchant skippers carry a pistol in the cabin safe and I can remember
the days when there'd be a locked rack of old Lee Enfields on just about
every merchant ship's bridge.

Anything bigger and you'd need 'hard points' built into the fabric of the
ship.

Some merchant shipping already has them,  paid for by the country in which
the ship is supposed to be registered.  Most British registered merchant
ships used to have them,  not sure about these days.

Fitting weapons to such hard points is usually a matter for national
governments.

It's not about what they can legally carry,  it's about what they can
legally acquire.
I don't think anyone can legally acquire anything much more powerful than a
machine gun without an 'end user certificate' these days so a government
needs to be involved at some point.

Just the noise from this sucker ought to create a defense. Weld up a
few mounts to cover the sides of the ship, any raider will be much
lower in the water.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M242

The M242 Bushmaster is a 25 mm chain gun. It is used extensively by
the US Armed Forces and other NATO forces in ground vehicles and
watercraft.

It is an externally powered, chain driven, single-barrel weapon which
may be fired in semi-automatic or automatic modes. It is fed by a
metallic link belt and has dual-feed capability. The term &quot;chain gun&quot;
derives from the use of a roller chain that drives the bolt back and
forth.

The gun can destroy lightly armored vehicles and aerial targets (such
as helicopters and slow-flying aircraft). It can also suppress enemy
positions such as exposed troops, dug-in positions, and occupied built-
up areas. The standard rate of fire is 200 rounds per minute. The
weapon has a range of 2,000 meters, depending on the type of
ammunition used.

Onl two armed merchant ships I can think of are the three which were built
to carry nuclear waste from Japan for reprocessing in the UK: _Pacific
Swan_, _Pacific Pintail_ and _Pacific Teal_, from memory. All have 3
single 30mm mounts (BMARC, IIRC) and an armed security detachment.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/389545.stm

Not sure whether they're still in use, given the problems with the
reprocessing contract with Japan.

It may not be a question of what the ship can legally carry but rather what
it actually does. AFAIK there is no legal prohibition to a merchant marine
vessel being armed with cannons and machine guns, at least in time of war
when the vessel is called into naval service. The US government, to the best
of my knowledge, continues to fund the US Merchant Marine Academy, and
looking at their website it sure looks to me like they get weapons training,
at least at small arms level.

I'd assume that any civilian ship with a half-trained crew packs some
firepower in the form of pistols, rifles and shotguns. You have pirates to
worry about, deranged or violent or intoxicated passengers etc etc. After
all, on the high seas you do not have a police force aboard - the ship's
crew is the police force. My guess would be that for a very valuable and/or
sensitive cargo, however, a navy ship would be detailed as an escort.

It's an interesting question, certainly. I think the WW2 days of merchant
marine ships being armed to the teeth are over. Navy UNREP ships are still
fairly impressively armed - Jack mentioned the 25mm Bushmaster, and it
doesn't hurt to have Sea Sparrow and CIWS too.

I don't know what goes on today but I can tell you what I was exposed to
back in the late 70's. I was a Navy courier guard aboard the USNS Furman. A
T-AK modified to carry Polaris Missiles and warheads. We had 6 enlisted and
1 officer and the rest of the crew was civilian MSC types. We had control of
the #3 hold when loaded and we were off the ship when the weapons were not
aboard.

The ship had (4) 50.cal, (2) M60's, and a few M14's. These weapons were in
the control of the crew but were always locked up in the gun lockers until
they used them. We carried shotguns and 45cal pistols. You might think
that's not enough to guard nuclear weapons but we also had a emergency
destruct capability and enough explosives to blow that ship and a few others
right to the bottom.

Whether or not is was legal I don't think the powers in place gave a shit. I
always questioned the non-combatants using firearms but got no where. It
took the crew over an ½hour just to set the guns in place. Plenty of time
for a dedicated force to board the ship. So in reality they were useless.
What was effective was what we did if we had to.

They should be useful, within some limitations.
You would have to beware damage from the backblast. Same exact problem
with rocket launchers. Indoors, shooting out an open window, is right

One either side of the bridge and one in the sharp (or blunt) end. So

6 guns at  1.3 million quid apiece.  I assume from the picture they
are the Laurence Scott LS-30B stabilised mounting which weighs in
at around 1.2 tons apiece.  Provision of strengthened deck areas,
ready use ammunition lockers, magazines etc. and installation and

Aren't ports still considered international points until you cross the

Anyway I doubt customs and excise will search a ship loaded with
plutonium all that thoroughly. And who's going to use an X-ray scanner

It's not right out - you just prepare the firing area. Keep the doors open,
and knock holes in walls - the latter also being useful to move from room to
room as you fight in close combat. Bear in mind the practice of
mouseholing - blowing holes in walls with PIATs, bazookas, Panzerfausts and
Panzershrecks, and working your way through a building complex that way.

In really serious combat nobody worries that much about hearing loss or
having their internal organs shook up. When the Soviets undertook their
artillery barrages at the Oder and Neisse, many of the Russian gunners
literally had to keep their mouths open and yell to relieve the effect of
that much gunnery. There probably aren't too many veterans from that event
that have 100% hearing.

Backblast is no big deal - provided that you are not directly behind the RR
when it goes off. You just put up with having no hearing for a while. 155mm
arty with muzzle brakes are no joke either - I once went through a 20 round
FFE as the layer (No 3) and had to keep my ear protection off to hear the
section chief...unfortunately, at the end of it, not one of us - layers,
section chief, loaders - could really hear each other any more. Charge 7
makes noise. I went through my outprocessing and the acoustics guys said
that my ears were pretty screwed, but not enough to get compensation - they
are screwed enough though that I can endure loud music from the neighbours.

No compensation? Tut, tut. Egged on by a friend who had received a
late, small pension, my then 70-year-old dad claimed &quot;partial deafness&quot;
- even his friendly doctor wouldn't put it at more than 15%, the old
man had ridiculously good hearing for his age -- as a result of a jolly
big bang when he'd been torpedoed more than half a century before.

To his utter amazement and delight, he received a letter from our
notoriously mean Ministry of Defence refusing any pension but
enclosing, one-off and ex gratia, a cheque for 2000 GBP. Much partying.

So don't give up, Arved. Just wait until you're old and *really*
grumpy, and go for the bastards. (Oh, and hold on to all the bits of
paper.)

Welcome to the era of &quot;one-camera&quot; television. Cable TV operates on
the principle that there is only one thing the viewers are able to
handle at any one time. If that is a fire in a warehouse in Schnectady
then they show it, tap into the local station's visual and audio
transmission and everyone goes to lunch. If you have a big event, like
someone dying ten years ago, that can be one-camera-ed all day long.

More or less what Dear Old Dad said on receipt of cheque. Indeed, I

different. The cheque, in fact, was for something like 2008.14. You
know what these clowns are like. I cannot swear before a Court of Law
as to the exact sum, but it was absurdly unrounded. I suggested he
apply for another ex gratia payment on grounds of arriving in NYC with
ten GBP (supplied by Eagle Oil and Shipping Line to officers for
bringing in badly winged tanker) and the serious risk of venereal
disease he endured on HMG service as a good-looking young chap who wore
his cap at the proverbial rakish angle and had 40 dollars in his
pocket. He refused, on the grounds that that might be pushing things.
Besides, it had all healed up, and there was no need for Mother to

&gt;&gt;The ship had (4) 50.cal, (2) M60's, and a few M14's. These weapons were in

&gt;&gt;that's not enough to guard nuclear weapons but we also had a emergency

And what you'd actually have is a pocket knife, since unless the rules

firearm will get you arrested.

I remember that Lusitania had mounts for 6&quot; guns and could have been

Other folks have addressed the legality, which was the question of

It's so easy to search under &quot;armed contractors in Iraq&quot; and see for
yourself what type of weapons these civilian contractors carry. You'd see
that Blackwater is the largest company with a 1000 guards and armed &quot;Little
Bird&quot; helicopters with door gunners. I would think with the internet so easy
to use that any intelligent person would at least get off his dead ass and
look before spouting facts that are simply not true. I wonder just how

Since the news reports on armed contractors providing escorts to

Fred, for me a civilian is a civilian. If you're not military or police you
are a civilian. The shitload of armed security guards in Iraq are civilians.
Being under contract to the US govt, however tenuously, still keeps you a
