Hello,

I just recently picked up a Philco Predicta Debutante and I'm in the
process of restoring it inside and out.  Unfortunately, its missing
the two UHF knobs.  I've been searching for either original or
replacement ones and have had zero luck finding any.  Anyone have any
leads?

Best,

Dave

You could try posting a note in the Television Swap Board forum at
AudioKarma.

Maybe someone has a junker chassis or a box of old knobs.

I thought Philco Predictas predated the UHF channels?  All the ones
I've seen (in person or in pictures) only have one channel selector.

Unless the UHF channel selector was made in a way I don't recognize?

There were repros available years ago from Vintage Radio and TV but they've
been out of biz in Cleveland for over 10 years.

These guys have been around for a while, and I'm glad to see
they're still in business.  I think they did a great job with
their interpretations of the Predicta line.  The Meteor set
would be just the thing for a Lost In Space decor!

Some had UHF tuners. Commercial UHF broadcasting began in 1952, but wasn't
widespread until the FCC mandated VHF/UHF tuners in 1964.

If you look fast on the Tampa craiglist, you can see a barberpole with a UHF
tuner. Note the side tuning knob, which mine lacks.

I care. I hate when they do that. I call them on it every time.

Wonder if they have started using ATSC circuitry in their TVs or are
they still NTSC only.

Thanks for all the tips!  I've sent some e-mails, and now I'm keeping
my fingers crossed.

Best to all,

I don't see why they won't wouldn't.  Their models are just
re-packaged sets.  I think I read years back where they stated they
were using RCA Colortrak chassis, but I have no idea what they might
be using now, or if they indeed do any mods beyond the box.

Regardless, the magic is in the cabinet.  The real trick will be
to adopt the form to 16x9 without looking funny.  They seem skillful
enough they might be able to pull it off.  I have no idea if they
intend to support widescreen, however.

I wonder if that channel selector knob actually works or is just a
dummy glued to the box itself. :-/

Dunno.  Since you've got more channels than you'll want to
fit on a knob, what would make sense is for the knob to select
channel memories.  Wouldn't be hard to do.  Use an absolute
encoder, a microcontroller, and splice into the IR sensor.
