The Current Crisis
If the Hsu Fits

WASHINGTON -- It has happened again. This past Monday at 6:40 PM, just as
the network news programs were getting under way, the Clinton presidential
campaign released some disturbing news. It will return $850,000 of donations
raised for it by recent fugitive and convicted felon Norman Hsu. For the
last three years Hsu had been a major Clinton donor. On August 29, the
Clintons employed the same maneuver. Then, just as the network news programs
were reporting the day's news, the Clinton campaign announced that it would
donate to charity $23,000 of campaign donations linked to the suddenly
exposed Hsu. Well, at the time I suggested that Hsu was responsible for a
lot more than $23,000 of Clinton donations, and again I heard the Bronx
cheers from the Clintonistas. So now they admit the figure approaches a cool
million.

I would not expect the Clintonistas to wisen up and recognize the Clintons
for the ethically insouciant couple that they are. Yet when will the press
recognize this, and when will the press get tired of being manipulated? Now
that the Clintons are admitting to a much larger campaign fraud than two
weeks ago, will they release the names of those who donated the $850,000?
Will the press demand it? Earlier reports in the Wall Street Journal made it
pretty clear that some of Hsu's orchestrated donors could not possibly
afford the donations they have made. So who are the others? Equally
important, how did Hsu and his friends come up with all that money? When he
returned to California to address the 1991 felony conviction that he had
skipped out on, he put up a $2 million bond. Where did that money come?

Late last winter when the Clinton presidential campaign was getting under
way, a New York Times writer interviewed me about Senator Clinton's
prospects with those who have been critical of her in years past. His thesis
was that they had tired of criticizing her and would be relatively inert. My
answer to him was that Senator Clinton would continue to rouse critics
because the Clintons inveterately do things that run the gamut from being
shady to being illegal. They act as though they are above the law. That
rouses critics.

Since then reports have accumulated naming some of the ethically-challenged
patrons in their camp. There is the spectacular Hsu, and such picturesque
figures as William Paw and his son, Winkle Paw, middle class Americans of
murky Asian ancestry who suddenly had hundreds of thousands to contribute.
There is Vinod Gupta, CEO of InfoUSA who after donating millions to various
Clinton campaigns was unceremoniously removed from the Clinton campaign
after it was reported that his company was being investigated for
questionable dealings with the elderly. There is the founder of the Bombay
Palaces restaurant chain, Sant S. Chatwal. He has raised millions of dollars
for Senator Clinton's campaigns while facing bank fraud charges in India and
contending with bankruptcy and tax liens amounting to millions of dollars on
two continents.

In its late-afternoon announcement this week, the Clinton campaign promised
to run criminal background checks on those who raise large amounts for it.
Well, I suggest also scrutinizing those Bill raises money from too. Three
years ago at the Tavern on the Green, Bill served as pitchman for a little
known Internet search engine founded by Marc Armand Rousso. Rousso is a
former promoter of penny stocks who in the late 1990s pleaded guilty to
stock fraud in the United States and was convicted of similar fraud in
France.

No family in public life has so long a record of misbehavior as the
Clintons. Often they get caught red-handed. Their record began in Arkansas
and has continued on the national scene. The Clintons, according to
anonymous Democratic sources, were warned about Hsu but took the money
anyway. Back in Arkansas, every gubernatorial campaign Bill Clinton ran was
surrounded by either questionable donations or questionable bank loans or
both. His two presidential campaigns featured illegal campaign donations,
often from shadowy Asian fellows just like Hsu. Doubtless this behavior will
continue.

Along with campaign finance violations there are the Clintons' other scrapes
with the law -- all go back to Arkansas and will continue as long as they
are in public life. The Democrats could save themselves a lot of
disappointments by finding a cleaner presidential nominee than Hillary. The
press cannot be manipulated forever, can it?

Yes, it has.  American Spectator, the creator of the Paula Jones lawsuit
against Bill Clinton, is now attempting to bring down the other half of the
team.  The right wing is salivating over something that simply has no legs.
