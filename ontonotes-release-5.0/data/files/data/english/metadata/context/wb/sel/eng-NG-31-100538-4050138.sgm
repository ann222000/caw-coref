307 rear door problems
</HEADLINE>

I have problems with the rear door (hatch) on my 5drs P307. Most of the
time it won't open using the handle (then I have to open it using that
small hole in the interior), but sometimes it opens ok. I can't really
pinpoint what it depends on, but I have a feeling that it's some kind of
electronical problem. I had the handle replaced while under warranty,
but it still malfunctions, so i guess it's not a mechanical issue. It's
very unpredictable and frustrating.
Did anyone have similar problems? Possible solutions?

Thanks in advance,
A

Probably pointless saying this because you're bound to know, but just in
case... nothing to do with the door locking itself is it? Opening the
driver's door unlocks it. You must know this though.

:-) unfortunately it's completely unpredictable, doesn't react to locking/unlocking at all. i've tried all possible combinations of opened/closed doors, locking/unlocking, remote/handle, screaming/praying hehehe nothing works. it has a mind of it's own it seems. thanks for the comment though

ps. actually after a few months of this and similar problems, i gave up
and bought a honda accord and gave the 307 to my father :-) but i still
want to help him not to go insane if possible with this car

A friend of mine's 307 did *exactly* the same. Dealer sorted it under
warranty.

Are the door-catches electronic then ?

He wouldn't know - he's an elderely relative. He'll have just dropped it
off, said "Fix this" and collected it later :)

I have the same problem on my 2003 307 (3dr)

I think its more mechanical though, as I can hear the solenoid click when I
try and open it as normal.

The door is VERY difficult to open (you have to push inwards before
operating the release)  Also there is no adjustment on the striker plate (I
looked)
So this will be into the garage to fix, once they get the CD changer which
Ive been waiting for for nearly 6 weeks!!

Gents I have had a similar problem with the rear locks on my 406 with dead
locks. The problem is with the locks they are almost totally made of plastic
and contain 2 motors and one set of contacts. You cannot take them apart as
the are stuck together. The motors drive the locks on and off and the
contacts are used to signal that the doors are shut properly. The problem is
due to wear in the plastic parts of the locks. I have had one lock replaced
at a cost of £70 to pass an MOT. I have however found a solution to the
intermittent operation. Don't use the deadlock function on the keyfob and
use a good quality steering lock on the wheel. I have not had any problem
with this approach in the last two years.

That small hole is on the tailgate lock only. To get the rear side
doors open, pull off the outer window scraper seal and let it hang out
of the way (it's attached to the vertical runner seal). Then look down
the gap and operate the outer handle and you'll be able to see the
part of the lock that needs moving. (You may need a penlight to see
clearly.)
This should work!! BUT I have had to break the lock with a long
screwdriver and a hammer either through the gap or by removing the
inner door trim which you can just about do with the door closed!

Good luck!

I have had to replace 2 rear door locks on a 406. The easiest way to get at
it was to remove the trim from inside the door after taking out the two torx
screws that hold the arm rest. Be careful of the electric window wires if
located in the arm rest. The only way to remove the lock is to smash it
with a screwdriver. You can then open the door and remove the two lock
fixing screws located in the door jamb. Be prepared for a sharp intake of
breath when told the price of a new door lock.
Good luck
Mike
