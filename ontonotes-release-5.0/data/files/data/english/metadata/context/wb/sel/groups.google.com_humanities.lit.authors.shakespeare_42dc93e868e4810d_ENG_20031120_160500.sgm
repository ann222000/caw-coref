The thesis of this author is that Spenser and Sidney began a process of
cohesion and regeneration in English writing. Here, at the end of a chapter,
are some remarks on Jonson, Donne then to Shakespeare.

I have some remarks of my own:

1) Who here feels an affinity with Donne as creative agent? This is no minor
question to begin, especially if you have a primarily historical interest in
Elizabethan writers. Possibly your motives are opposite - the historian
wants to substantiate facts and chronologies, sources et. al. in order to
placate and settle the unknown. Creative writers however desire to upset the
apple-cart; to disestablish any status quo, or received ideas, and re-open
settled ideas, no-matter who it discomfits. A powerful psychological factor
when making comments may be a reader's appreciation of his own orientation
to such writers.

2) I notice that the writer below says that we no longer (are able to)
appreciate the Elizabethan period in our current cultural expression, and
are more like Donne who seems to have stepped over it, and who is more a
proto-modern than Sidney, Shakespeare and Spenser.

3) Recently there has been discussion of the nature of the Author of
'Shakespeare's' Work without much definition of his character. Here is a
strong contra-punctual voice, deliberately avoiding Elizabethan and Jacobean
means of expression. Does the nature of this author come over clearer than
toutes les autres? Does this comparison help clarify what is, for example,
'Shakespearean' and what not?

4) I should like to follow this appreciation of Donne, with one of the early
character from Stratford, intending an element of comparison between them
from an historical perspective.

5) It is my primary interest however to review the Author from quite another
perspective, which I previously called 'implicate' [pretentious-sounding,
no?] and which is of greater complexity, even perplexity. However, a
comparison with Donne seems to me to be a way of looking at various
historical canards, possibly providing some insights into the texts
themselves.

Cordially, Phil Innes

~~~~~~~~~~

[...beginning with Jonson]

songs. He also popularised the 'epigram'-a flexible form, which might be
long or short, but is again dominantly intellectual, reflecting on person or
subject. With all this, it is the less surprising that Jonson wrote his
poems the way that Camden had taught him at Westminster, first in prose,
then
turning them into verse. It is hardly the way to gain inspiration, never-
theless Jonson often achieved a classic perfection in his songs and shorter
pieces. He cared everything for 'art'. We are on the way to the
meta-physical school, the cult of cleverness, intellectualism, the
far-fetched conceit: the poets of the next generation were happy to inscribe
themselves of 'the tribe of Ben'.

A Catholic, a member of a persecuted minority, with martyrs in his
family, John Donne did not appreciate the Elizabethan Age-though
he went on one of its grand exploits, the capture of Cadiz-nor did he
think much of its literature. He is a singular, isolated phenomenon, with
no obvious affiliations; of extraordinary originality, emotional intensity,
intellectual vitality, he is already on his way to the next age, a fore-
runner, a precursor. How different a spirit from Sidney, Spenser, Shake-
speare! We could already tell from his images, even if we did not know,
that his was a Catholic background. In one poem we hear of those
whose state

Is poor, disarmed like Papists, not worth hate.

The winds 'in our ruined abbeys roar', and he knows about

Simony and sodomy in churchmen's lives;

about the ways of monks and friars, with their beads and pater-nosters;
fasts are not Puritan, but Carthusian; wasting candle-droppings are kept
like relics.

For, an exceedingly erotic spirit, there is a thin line between religion
and sex in Donne: even his devotion is erotic. And he was obsessed with
sex. Take, again, one poem only:

'On his Mistress Going to Bed.'

Come, madam, come, all rest my powers defy:
Until I labour, I in labour lie.
The foe oft-times, having the foe in sight,
Is tired with standing though he never fight . . .
Full nakedness! All joys are due to thee,
As souls unbodied, bodies must unclothed be
To taste whole joys . . .
To teach thee, I am naked first: why then,
What needst thou have more covering than a man?

The next poem is more specific in its imagery from war:

Other men war that they their rest may gain,
But we will rest that we may fight again . . .
Near thrusts, pikes, stabs, yea bullets, hurt not here.

How different from those chaste Protestants, Spenser and Sidney!

And again we see how different from the age in that, in his most
ambitious poem, The Progress of the Soul, in the end the soul of heresy,
after a sojourn with Calvin, was to come to rest in the body of Queen
Elizabeth! The poem was, appropriately, abortive and was never finished;
but to it Donne added a coda that expresses a cynical distrust about ever
finding the truth intellectually. This is a Catholic inflexion, not a
Protestant one.

Who'ere thou beest that readst this sullen writ,
Which just so much courts thee as thou dost it,
Let me arrest thy thoughts. Wonder with me
Why ploughing, building, ruling and the rest,
Or most of those arts whence our lives are blest,
By cursed Cain's race invented be
And blest Seth vexed us with astronomy.

And the conclusion?-

There's nothing simply good or ill alone: Of every quality comparison, The
only measure is, and judge, opinion. Scepticism, cynicism, relativism: with
that he was finding his way out of Catholicism.

It is an unattractive mixture; but what wins respect is his tormented
search to find truth somehow, somewhere. It took him a long time.
Meanwhile his poetry made a sensation among the young and intelligent. His
method was that of paradox, in verse as in prose; of conceits as
unexpected as might be in order to shock, of analogies so far-fetched as
sometimes to be ridiculous; to twist the accentuation of words and the
rhythms of lines to get away from smoothness, often achieving surprisingly
fine effects; to phrase with telescoped conciseness, and then produce
a catalogue of words, nouns or verbs, one after another. Everything was
done to make verse as different as possible from Elizabethan facility and
ease and regularity. But there is no doubt that this was genuine and
corresponded with Donne's genius: the irregularity of his life is reflected
in the irregularity of his poetry, along with the intellectual restlessness,
torment of mind and spirit-in a word, the Angst-that gives him a
living appeal to us moderns.

Brilliantly gifted, fascinating to women and men-friends alike, he was not a
nice man. Donne's deformation of conventional metrics-for which Ben Jonson
said he should have been hanged-was deliberate and conscious. But
there takes place a comparable breakdown of the famous blank verse line
in the drama, so regular and formal at the beginning. Verse-forms undergo
a certain evolution according to an inner logic, but also in response to
the demands upon them of thought, of content-thus indirectly even
reflecting the conditions of society. Blank verse becomes more flexible,
less end-stopped; with so much pressure of imagination, images, thought, as,

Shakespeare grew older his blank verse became verse-paragraphs. With
others too. A contemporary noticed that blank verse was really too facile
-- for poor poets. In the Caroline drama the deliquescence goes so far,
it often ceases to be recognisable as verse. In Shakespeare difference of
function between verse and prose still exists, in accordance with aesthetic
decorum. Later on, it might often as well be written, as with later Auden,
in the form of prose.

~~~~~
We may conclude that where, before the Elizabethans, there was no
continuous English literature, after them it flourished, rich, mature and
full. They started it. Sidney and Spenser achieved their aim, perhaps
beyond their dreams.

I don't think we're like Donne, as a generality, any more than like
the Elizabethans. Donne displays a ~devotion~ which is not
characteristic of our times, as I view them. Despite occasional
forays into high-sounding rhetoric, we're too pragmatic nowadays to
admit such a comparison.

Hi Will,

In one of the Book Cook articles, the writer makes the same point, speaking
of the difficulty negotiating whatever constituted 'being Elizabethan'. I
think Victorians who could baulk at sexual implications of the Bard, would
not know where to look confronted with a Donne.

By modern, perhaps the writer meant such authors as Lawrence? Or better,
Rimbaud. This modern sense of wrestling with devils and angels, as if even
intellectual life though granted some reprieve from bitter and barbaric
wars, is nevertheless fully engaged in another battle of the spirit?

I think this was Henry Miller's sense of the creative spark of our times.
And arguably, Miller was the last writer of the novel in the C20th
[according to Orwell], and not just America's best, thereby, but of the
world.

The /intensity/ of engagement and struggle in life of
Miller/Lawrence/Rimbaud is perhaps the same as with Donne. What the Author
of the Works engaged seems to me to be some counterpoint of this approach,
and since we have fewer [or none] precedents in Literature or in Life with
the Author, his world is largely beyond the appreciation of our modern
cultural sympathy.

It's becoming increasingly difficult even to find culture, by the
standard definitions, in the modern world. Look at Dell Computer
farming out their U.S. customer service to India, for example. Pick
up the phone, dial the number, and you don't know whether the person
who answers is in Dallas or Calcutta. It rather blurs the cultural
divide. As cultural divisions fade, where, then, is &quot;culture&quot; at all?
To identify something, it must be different from something else.
Culture increasingly becomes what people do on weekends, like a hobby.
Will it be long until, when junior asks dad, &quot;Dad, what's a &quot;social
culture?&quot;&quot; dad will reply, &quot;Well, Junior, it's like people having
different hobbies.&quot;

Different way of life, you say? Never heard of it. Sounds
impossible. We all live the same.

So when you write, &quot;modern cultural sympathy&quot; you'll have to remember
that I'm a modern westerner, and tell me what you mean. Do they sell
that at Walmart?

:)

I'd say nearly everything before the mass marketing of the automobile
is now beyond our cultural sympathy, or true appreciation,
historically speaking. We live our daily lives so immersed in
technology, it's all we really know. We're immersed in tech the way
earlier peoples were, perhaps, immersed in their religion. But saying
that, doesn't convey any true understanding.

Consider the humble Flea. To Donne, it's an angel. In Donne's poem
he uses the flea to symbolize union with his beloved, marriage, child,
the precious mingling of human life.

Shake-speare mentions fleas a few times, including HenryV.

BOY. Do you not remember, a' saw a flea stick upon
Bardolph's nose, and a' said it was a black soul
burning in hell-fire?

The symbolism there is the reverse of Donne.

But both Donne and S use the flea for symbolism, in an Angel/Devil
way.

Our modern view of fleas? Grab the bug spray! :) A flea nowadays is
a technical problem, to be solved through the mass marketing of
chemical technology.

Donne and S were much closer to each other than we are to either, I
believe.

As someone who has spent at least thirty hours on the phone to India to try
to get my wireless laptop fixed, I disagree. I think it strengthens the

counterparts are making, and I'm also concerned that when they keep saying
&quot;no problem&quot; to every problem I have, and I argue, they are thinking: &quot;Who

privileged she is? Why is she causing us such trouble?&quot; And at some level I
can commiserate with their (projected) point of view.

I'd just like to also put my two cents in regarding Donne.
I always thought he was a fabulous poet. I still do. But then I found out he
was an anti-semite of the worse stripe (his writings on the subject sicken
me) and I don't know which pocket to put that in. So I can't say that my
sensibility approaches his at all, or that his is modern.

Hi Lynne, if it is of any worth to your consideration, a greater antisemite
may be Dostoyevski. Nevertheless he expended much, even most, of his
correspondance writing with Jews, whom he evidentally preferred as writers
and cultural commentators.

Susan Sontag in her introduction to Summer in Baded-Baden by Leonid Tsypkin,
amplifies Tsypkin's own comments on his struggle in coming to grips with
this aspect of Dostoyevski - something going on in that relation which
placed this anti-semitism in a lesser category?

Donne was not on anti-semitic. As a 'profound' Catholic he was also
anti-Protestant, and spectacularly anti-Catholic! The wrestling match with
his own soul seems to be of the modern type indicated by the writer of the
piece I cited - quite different from any normal Elizabethan sensibility
which was decidedly more intellectual.

Though I spoke of Lawrence et al, the nearest compound, or reunion, of Donne
and anything normally Elizabethan emerged in mid C19th with Geogre Eliot,
who resurrected this Falstaffian sense of not 'playing along' with this
group or that, coupled with Donne's more fiery sense of personal liberation.

As a writer I suggest that unless there is some high degree of struggle; an
evident amount of unresolved and self-contradicting factors warring in the
text, then the writing is either not honest or not deep. It would certainly
be uncompelling.

Cordially, Phil Innes

&gt;&gt;&gt; divide.

&gt;&gt; As someone who has spent at least thirty hours on the phone to India to try
&gt;&gt; to get my wireless laptop fixed, I disagree. I think it strengthens the
&gt;&gt; cultural divide. These guys are making maybe a fifth of what their American
&gt;&gt; counterparts are making, and I'm also concerned that when they keep saying
&gt;&gt;&quot;no problem&quot; to every problem I have, and I argue, they are thinking: &quot;Who
&gt;&gt; is this rich bloody woman who lives in Canada? Doesn't she understand how
&gt;&gt; privileged she is? Why is she causing us such trouble?&quot; And at some level I
&gt;&gt; can commiserate with their (projected) point of view.

&gt;&gt; I'd just like to also put my two cents in regarding Donne.
&gt;&gt; I always thought he was a fabulous poet. I still do. But then I found out he
&gt;&gt; was an anti-semite of the worse stripe (his writings on the subject sicken
&gt;&gt; me) and I don't know which pocket to put that in. So I can't say that my
&gt;&gt; sensibility approaches his at all, or that his is modern.

&gt; I'm familiar with the &quot;Spit in my face you Jews&quot;
&gt; poem. Can't say that I've seen anything else
&gt; by Donne that might be considered anti-Semitic.
&gt; Are you talking about his sermons. (I can't
&gt; say that I've read any of them.)

Spit in my face, you Jews, and pierce my side,
Buffet, and scoff, scourge, and crucify me,
For I have sinned, and sinned, and only he,
Who could do no iniquity, hath died.
But by my death can not be satisfied
My sins, which pass the Jews' impiety.
They killed once an inglorious man, but I
Crucify him daily, being now glorified.
Oh let me then, his strange love still admire;
Kings pardon, but he bore our punishment.
And Jacob came clothed in vile harsh attire
But to supplant, and with gainful intent:
God clothed himself in vile man's flesh, that so
He might be weak enough to suffer woe.
Donne, Holy Sonnets XI

The New Testament is &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;, if you want to take it
that way:

&quot;Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how
they might entangle them in his talk....
Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to
give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said,
Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?&quot; Matthew 22.15-18

Are the Jews going to apologize for their &quot;anti-Philistinism&quot;?

&quot;And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying,
What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine,
and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is
this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the
armies of the living God?&quot; 1 Samuel 26

Pretty silly, if you ask me.

It's not an ignorant question at all, and I hope you don't mind my answering
it.

In one of his sermons, &quot;A Sermon Preached at St. Dunstan's upon
New-Years-Day, 1624,&quot; John Donne, hinting at ritual murder, talks of &quot;the
barbarous and inhumane custom of the Jews&quot; who &quot;always keep in readiness the
blood of some Christian, with which they anoint the body of any that dies
amongst them, with these words, 'If Jesus Christ were the Messiah, then may
the blood of this Christian avail thee to salvation.'&quot;

I came across this several years ago while reading _Shakespeare and the
Jews_, by James Shapiro. I have to say my own blood ran cold when I saw it.

Best wishes,
Lynne

Sure the reference is correct? I don't see it in that sermon. In that
sermon Donne relates the physical circumcision of the Jews to
a spiritual circumcision of Christians. (New Year's Day was
the Feast of the Circumcision then).

that's the source he gives for it. The complete source is _The Sermons of

I wonder whether he's given the wrong sermon as source or whether the

perhaps they'd look and see. I've found Shapiro to be pretty reliable in the

"/>

Shapiro has the volume and page number correct. He has the name of the
sermon wrong. It's actually &quot;Preached Upon Christmas Day at St. Paul's, 1625&quot;.

I'm not convinced that Donne believed that Jews practiced ritual murder, that
is Shapiro's take on it. Donne's sermon uses Galations 4.4-5 as its theme,
that the messiah would come at &quot; the fulness of time&quot;. He goes on to say
that even the Jews considered the time of Christ's birth as &quot;the fulness of
time&quot;:

&quot;First we consider it to have been so to the Jews; for this was that fulnesse,
in which all the prophecies concerning the Messias, were exactly fulfilled;
That
he must come whilst the Monarchy of Rome flourished; And before the Temple
of Jerusalem was destroyed; That he must be born in Bethlem; That he must
be born of a Virgin; His person, his actions, his passion so distinctly
prophecyed, so exactly accomplished, as no word being left unfulfilled, this
must necessarily be a fulnesse of time. So fully was the time of the Messias
comming, come, that though some of the Jews say now, that there is no
certain time revealed in the Scriptures when the Messias shall come, and
others of them say, that there was a time determined, and revealed, and
that this time was the time, but by reason of their great sins he did not
come at his time, yet when they examine their own supputations, they are
so convinced with that evidence, that this was the fulnesse of time, that
now they expresse a kind of conditionall acknowledgment of it, by this
barbarous and inhumane custom of theirs, that they always keep in
readinesse the blood of some Christian, with which they anoint the body
of any that dyes amongst them, with these words, if Jesus Christ were
the Messias, then may the blood of this Christian availe thee to salvation:
So that by their doubt, and their implyed consent, in this action, this was
the fulnesse of time, when Christ did come, that the Messias should come.&quot;

So Donne is using this story to make a point about the Jews belief
that Christ was the Messiah. I don't see why he has to believe this
literally any more than he has to believe many of the stories in the Bible
literally, because he uses stories like that to illustrate some point. In
any case, in a day when blood-letting was rampant, I doubt that if any
one wanted blood he would have had to resort to murder.

Donne continues:

&quot;And the Devill himself was so full of it, as that in his Oracles he gave
that answer, That an Hebrew childe should be God over all gods, and
brought the Emperor to erect an Altar, to this Messiah Christ Jesus,
though he knew not what he did. This was the fulnesse that filled Jew
and Gentile, Kings and Philosophers, strangers and inhabitants, counterfaits
and devils to the expectation of a Messiah; and when he comes this
fulnesse of time to us, that we feele this Messiah born in ourselves?&quot;

Nothing in what Donne says in this sermon strikes me as &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;.
He's doing what preachers do, telling stories to make a point. Donne's
beliefs concerning the Jews were no doubt just like his Christian
contemporaries, when to be a Christian meant in part opposing oneself
to the Jews, while in other ways accepting their heritage. In fact, other
sermons by Donne, for example the New Years Day sermon, make
a point of relating the old Jewish customs to the newer (Improved! More
Sparkling!) Christian religion.

I dunno, Jim. He calls it a &quot;barbarous and inhumane custom...&quot; To me
that means he believes that the Jews literally participate in it. And
if they participate in it, where do they get the blood from? Blood
letting might have been rampant, but I can't see a Christian sitting
still while a Jew took his blood, can you? And it would have had to be
fresh blood. If one reads Shapiro and other authors who speak about
blood libel etc. with regard to this period, it seems clear that many
Christians of the time believed Jews capable of all sorts of crimes,
including murder.

Except Jews did live in England at the time, though many writers chose not
to countenance the fact.
Jewish influence was the strong fuel for much Neo-Platonism.

One more point - I notice that a fear of Jewish blood-letting [baby-eating,
and so on] may have been prevalent in the country, but this is a sort of
fear-of-foreigners by simple country folk issue, no? Who, with any
education, wrote about actual beastliness, rather than reported on the fear
of it?

Maybe one more - Donne was certainly anti-Jewish, he was also anti-Catholic
and anti-Protestant. He didn't like neo-Platonists either. His dynamic was
like a more fiery-Falstaff, he sought personal release from compulsory
association with each of these ideologies.

Jews could not live openly as Jews. They had to convert and at least
appear to be Christians. There were of course many Jews or &quot;New
Christians,&quot; Lopez, the Queen's physician, to name one who came to a
bad end. Florio, Southampton's tutor, was another. Nunes, a doctor to
Burghley's household and a spy, was a third. Emilia Bassano's family,
brought over from Venice by Henry VIII, was also Jewish. But the only
Jew that I know of in Elizabethan times who chose not to hide his
Jewishness, a mining expert, disappeared. The problem persisted under
the Stuarts. Jews were not allowed in the country from the time they
were expelled in 1290, until they were officially allowed back under
the Jew Bill of the mid 1700s. Many Englishmen(to their knowledge) had
never seen a Jew, and so they were easy to target.

No, Phil, I don't think so. If you read the literature of and
pertaining to the period, you'll see that Jews were feared and hated
in country and city alike. Who wrote negatively of Jews? Well, Donne,
of course. Marlowe. Chaucer had earlier. And many many others wrote
very negatively about them, often in theological terms. Il Pecerone
was also circulating in translation and was a source for MOV.
Christians believed the Jews used their blood to make matzos, for
example, and thought Jews stole and murdered Christian children. There
is still a town in Europe which commemorates such a story every year,
despite the fact that the Vatican has asked them to stop. Hugh of
Lincoln, much earlier, was another such &quot;blood libel&quot; story that
persisted almost into modern times.

Shakespeare was quite unusual. He gave Shylock a voice that at times
we can empathise with. It's hard to decide where the bard stood with
regard to Jews. And interestingly, he chose to change early versions
of the story MOV is based on, so that the pound of flesh was closest
to the heart, and was not the genitals of the victim. I imagine the
earlier versions were rooted in a fear of circumcision.

The more you say about him, the less I like him and the less modern I
think his sensibilities were. And there's a great difference between
seeking personal release from ideologies or religions and denigrating
their proponents.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, but I think it was quite usual to talk reasonably of Jewish
&gt;&gt;&gt; customs or even to learn Hebrew, whilst vilifying the Jews themselves,
&gt;&gt;&gt; who by the way were not even allowed to live in England at the time.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is hard for me to see his sermon as anything other than
&gt;&gt;&gt; anti-semitic.

&gt;&gt; Except Jews did live in England at the time, though many writers chose
not
&gt;&gt; to countenance the fact.
&gt;&gt; Jewish influence was the strong fuel for much Neo-Platonism.

&gt; Jews could not live openly as Jews. They had to convert and at least
&gt; appear to be Christians. There were of course many Jews or &quot;New
&gt; Christians,&quot; Lopez, the Queen's physician, to name one who came to a
&gt; bad end. Florio, Southampton's tutor, was another. Nunes, a doctor to
&gt; Burghley's household and a spy, was a third. Emilia Bassano's family,
&gt; brought over from Venice by Henry VIII, was also Jewish. But the only
&gt; Jew that I know of in Elizabethan times who chose not to hide his
&gt; Jewishness, a mining expert, disappeared. The problem persisted under
&gt; the Stuarts. Jews were not allowed in the country from the time they
&gt; were expelled in 1290, until they were officially allowed back under
&gt; the Jew Bill of the mid 1700s. Many Englishmen(to their knowledge) had
&gt; never seen a Jew, and so they were easy to target.

"/>

As you have said. And if there were other Jews of influence they were not
written of, though may have left other signs of their population.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; One more point - I notice that a fear of Jewish blood-letting
[baby-eating,
&gt;&gt; and so on] may have been prevalent in the country, but this is a sort of
&gt;&gt; fear-of-foreigners by simple country folk issue, no? Who, with any
&gt;&gt; education, wrote about actual beastliness, rather than reported on the
fear
&gt;&gt; of it?

&gt; No, Phil, I don't think so. If you read the literature of and
&gt; pertaining to the period, you'll see that Jews were feared and hated
&gt; in country and city alike.

"/>

This is a very interesting area of speculation where little direct evidence
supports any view, as much as I know. From the Work we have a certain
villainy, and also the most passionate expressions of humanness from the
mouth of a Jew.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Who wrote negatively of Jews? Well, Donne,
&gt; of course.

"/>

And negatively of everyone. I draw your attention to the relative fact that
Donne was no more down on Jews than Proddys.

Yet Marlow actively employed Jewish mysticism, sub voce.

Classical scapegoats, which psychologically I also ask you to consider, is a
factor of /public/ group reactionism, rather than individual sensibility.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Il Pecerone
&gt; was also circulating in translation and was a source for MOV.
&gt; Christians believed the Jews used their blood to make matzos, for
&gt; example, and thought Jews stole and murdered Christian children. There
&gt; is still a town in Europe which commemorates such a story every year,
&gt; despite the fact that the Vatican has asked them to stop. Hugh of
&gt; Lincoln, much earlier, was another such &quot;blood libel&quot; story that
&gt; persisted almost into modern times.

"/>

It is my opinion than the Jews understood something of menstruation, and the
force of women, that was entirely antithetical to Vatican's views,
[masculine dominant, then and now] but of which the Vatican owned the press.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Shakespeare was quite unusual. He gave Shylock a voice that at times

yes, quite a likely reaction. and another source of blood, no? jacobeans

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Maybe one more - Donne was certainly anti-Jewish, he was also
anti-Catholic
&gt;&gt; and anti-Protestant. He didn't like neo-Platonists either. His dynamic
was
&gt;&gt; like a more fiery-Falstaff, he sought personal release from compulsory
&gt;&gt; association with each of these ideologies.

&gt; The more you say about him, the less I like him and the less modern I

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's not an ignorant question at all, and I hope you don't mind my
&gt;&gt; answering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In one of his sermons, &quot;A Sermon Preached at St. Dunstan's upon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;New-Years-Day, 1624,&quot; John Donne, hinting at ritual murder, talks of
&gt;&quot;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;barbarous and inhumane custom of the Jews&quot; who &quot;always keep in
&gt;readiness
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;blood of some Christian, with which they anoint the body of any that
&gt;dies
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;amongst them, with these words, 'If Jesus Christ were the Messiah, then
&gt;&gt; may
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the blood of this Christian avail thee to salvation.'&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I came across this several years ago while reading _Shakespeare and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Jews_, by James Shapiro. I have to say my own blood ran cold when I saw
&gt;&gt; it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure the reference is correct? I don't see it in that sermon. In that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sermon Donne relates the physical circumcision of the Jews to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a spiritual circumcision of Christians. (New Year's Day was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Feast of the Circumcision then).

&gt;&gt;&gt;Interesting, Jim. I can't say that it's correct, only that it's correct as
&gt;&gt;&gt;taken from Shapiro. I double checked. He mentions it in several places,
&gt;and
&gt;&gt;&gt;that's the source he gives for it. The complete source is _The Sermons of
&gt;&gt;&gt;John Donne_, ed. George R. Potter and Evelyn M. Simpson, 10 Vols.
&gt;(Berkeley:
&gt;&gt;&gt;University of California Press, 1953-62), Vol. 6, pp. 333-334

&gt;&gt;&gt;I wonder whether he's given the wrong sermon as source or whether the
&gt;&gt;&gt;passage has been expurgated from other editions. If anyone has this
&gt;edition,
&gt;&gt;&gt;perhaps they'd look and see. I've found Shapiro to be pretty reliable in
&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;past.

&gt;&gt; Shapiro has the volume and page number correct. He has the name of the
&gt;&gt; sermon wrong. It's actually &quot;Preached Upon Christmas Day at St. Paul's,
&gt;1625&quot;.

&gt;Thanks for that correction. Rather an egregious error on his part.

"/>

Not really. Errors in the notes are common in scholarly books.
Roger Stritmatter might think that it invalidates everything he says,
but it doesn't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I'm not convinced that Donne believed that Jews practiced ritual murder,
&gt;that
&gt;&gt; is Shapiro's take on it. Donne's sermon uses Galations 4.4-5 as its theme,
&gt;&gt; that the messiah would come at &quot; the fulness of time&quot;. He goes on to say
&gt;&gt; that even the Jews considered the time of Christ's birth as &quot;the fulness of
&gt;&gt; time&quot;:

&gt;&gt;&quot;First we consider it to have been so to the Jews; for this was that
&gt;fulnesse,
&gt;&gt; in which all the prophecies concerning the Messias, were exactly fulfilled;
&gt;&gt; That
&gt;&gt; he must come whilst the Monarchy of Rome flourished; And before the Temple
&gt;&gt; of Jerusalem was destroyed; That he must be born in Bethlem; That he must
&gt;&gt; be born of a Virgin; His person, his actions, his passion so distinctly
&gt;&gt; prophecyed, so exactly accomplished, as no word being left unfulfilled,
&gt;this
&gt;&gt; must necessarily be a fulnesse of time. So fully was the time of the
&gt;Messias
&gt;&gt; comming, come, that though some of the Jews say now, that there is no
&gt;&gt; certain time revealed in the Scriptures when the Messias shall come, and
&gt;&gt; others of them say, that there was a time determined, and revealed, and
&gt;&gt; that this time was the time, but by reason of their great sins he did not
&gt;&gt; come at his time, yet when they examine their own supputations, they are
&gt;&gt; so convinced with that evidence, that this was the fulnesse of time, that
&gt;&gt; now they expresse a kind of conditionall acknowledgment of it, by this
&gt;&gt; barbarous and inhumane custom of theirs, that they always keep in
&gt;&gt; readinesse the blood of some Christian, with which they anoint the body
&gt;&gt; of any that dyes amongst them, with these words, if Jesus Christ were
&gt;&gt; the Messias, then may the blood of this Christian availe thee to salvation:
&gt;&gt; So that by their doubt, and their implyed consent, in this action, this was
&gt;&gt; the fulnesse of time, when Christ did come, that the Messias should come.&quot;

&gt;&gt; So Donne is using this story to make a point about the Jews belief
&gt;&gt; that Christ was the Messiah. I don't see why he has to believe this
&gt;&gt; literally any more than he has to believe many of the stories in the Bible
&gt;&gt; literally, because he uses stories like that to illustrate some point. In
&gt;&gt; any case, in a day when blood-letting was rampant, I doubt that if any
&gt;&gt; one wanted blood he would have had to resort to murder.

&gt;I dunno, Jim. He calls it a &quot;barbarous and inhumane custom...&quot; To me
&gt;that means he believes that the Jews literally participate in it.

"/>

A figure of speech, and &quot;barbarous&quot; and &quot;inhuman&quot; or &quot;inhumane&quot; could
have different meanings then compared with how we use them today,
for example &quot;rustic&quot; or &quot;impolite&quot;, as in &quot;Fit for the mountains and the
barbarous caves/ Where manners ne'er were preached!&quot; Twelfth Night
4.1.48-49.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And
&gt;if they participate in it, where do they get the blood from?

"/>

As far as the origin of the bloodI don't know what Donne was thinking
when he wrote that passage, but today, you can make a buck or two
selling blood. I can't imagine that things were any different then. If someone
needed blood, I'm sure there would be someone else willing to sell it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Blood
&gt;letting might have been rampant, but I can't see a Christian sitting

Sure, a poor Christian in need of some cash.

Why? The passage in Donne doesn't mention anything about the
freshness of the blood.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I don't doubt it, but surely these same Christians also believed
that pretty much any person was capable of murder.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Donne continues:

&gt;&gt;&quot;And the Devill himself was so full of it, as that in his Oracles he gave
&gt;&gt; that answer, That an Hebrew childe should be God over all gods, and
&gt;&gt; brought the Emperor to erect an Altar, to this Messiah Christ Jesus,
&gt;&gt; though he knew not what he did. This was the fulnesse that filled Jew
&gt;&gt; and Gentile, Kings and Philosophers, strangers and inhabitants,
&gt;counterfaits
&gt;&gt; and devils to the expectation of a Messiah; and when he comes this
&gt;&gt; fulnesse of time to us, that we feele this Messiah born in ourselves?&quot;

&gt;&gt; Nothing in what Donne says in this sermon strikes me as &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;.
&gt;&gt; He's doing what preachers do, telling stories to make a point. Donne's
&gt;&gt; beliefs concerning the Jews were no doubt just like his Christian
&gt;&gt; contemporaries, when to be a Christian meant in part opposing oneself
&gt;&gt; to the Jews, while in other ways accepting their heritage. In fact, other
&gt;&gt; sermons by Donne, for example the New Years Day sermon, make
&gt;&gt; a point of relating the old Jewish customs to the newer (Improved! More
&gt;&gt; Sparkling!) Christian religion.

&gt;Yes, but I think it was quite usual to talk reasonably of Jewish
&gt;customs or even to learn Hebrew, whilst vilifying the Jews themselves,
&gt;who by the way were not even allowed to live in England at the time.
&gt;It is hard for me to see his sermon as anything other than
&gt;anti-semitic

"/>

Well, you are going to have to define &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; a little better.
Christianity is, after all, fundamentally &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;. Shakespeare's
portrayal of Shylock could be taken to be &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;. But was
Donne's &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; some profound hatred that he personally
had for the Jews, or was it just part of the world view of Christians
of his time? It seems to me to be a little naive to condemn him with
&quot;anti-Semitism&quot; (used in the way that this expression has come to
mean today). You'll be hard pressed to find a Christian of those times
who did not exhibit some of what you call &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; (from Dryden,
Absolom and Achitophel):

&quot;The Jews, a headstrong, moody, murmuring race,
As ever tried th'extent and stretch of grace;
God's pampered people whom, debauched with ease,
No king could govern, nor no God could please;
(Gods they had tried of every shape and size,
That god-smiths could produce, or priests devise:)
These Adam-wits, too fortunately free,
Began to dream they wanted liberty:
And when no rule, no precedent, was found
Of men, by laws less circumscribed and bound,
They led their wild desires to woods and caves,
And thought that all but savages were slaves.&quot;

Try harder. Absent any means of typing, preserving, and transfusing

But no one needed to buy blood in sixteenth-century England. Donne was

Christians were willingly selling their blood to Jews for use in
blasphemous rituals.

Sure, why not risk eternal damnation for some ready cash? The relevant
question isn't whether you can see it, but whether Donne could have seen
it, and since Jews were not, in fact, practicing blasphemous rituals
with Christians' blood, it is highly unlikely that Donne would have
believed they were but also believed they were obtaining the blood via
relatively humane cash transactions rather than murder.

As Donne was presumably aware, blood didn't keep very well in the
sixteenth century. If the Jews kept a supply on hand at all times for
anointing the dead, it would have had to be fresh.

The story, as told, doesn't exactly seem &quot;blasphemous&quot; from a

History of England 1485-1850- by David Katz, or _Shylock: A Legend and
its Legacy_ by John Gross. Together they paint a rather vivid picture
of what Christians thought about Jews and how these thoughts differed
from what they believed about themselves.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Donne continues:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;And the Devill himself was so full of it, as that in his Oracles he gave
&gt;&gt;&gt; that answer, That an Hebrew childe should be God over all gods, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; brought the Emperor to erect an Altar, to this Messiah Christ Jesus,
&gt;&gt;&gt; though he knew not what he did. This was the fulnesse that filled Jew
&gt;&gt;&gt; and Gentile, Kings and Philosophers, strangers and inhabitants,
&gt; counterfaits
&gt;&gt;&gt; and devils to the expectation of a Messiah; and when he comes this
&gt;&gt;&gt; fulnesse of time to us, that we feele this Messiah born in ourselves?&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing in what Donne says in this sermon strikes me as &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt; He's doing what preachers do, telling stories to make a point. Donne's
&gt;&gt;&gt; beliefs concerning the Jews were no doubt just like his Christian
&gt;&gt;&gt; contemporaries, when to be a Christian meant in part opposing oneself
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the Jews, while in other ways accepting their heritage. In fact, other
&gt;&gt;&gt; sermons by Donne, for example the New Years Day sermon, make
&gt;&gt;&gt; a point of relating the old Jewish customs to the newer (Improved! More
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sparkling!) Christian religion.

&gt;&gt;Yes, but I think it was quite usual to talk reasonably of Jewish
&gt;&gt;customs or even to learn Hebrew, whilst vilifying the Jews themselves,
&gt;&gt;who by the way were not even allowed to live in England at the time.
&gt;&gt;It is hard for me to see his sermon as anything other than
&gt;&gt;anti-semitic

&gt; Well, you are going to have to define &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; a little better.
&gt; Christianity is, after all, fundamentally &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;. Shakespeare's
&gt; portrayal of Shylock could be taken to be &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;. But was
&gt; Donne's &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; some profound hatred that he personally
&gt; had for the Jews, or was it just part of the world view of Christians
&gt; of his time?

"/>

You make a good point; however, what you call the &quot;world view&quot; of most
Christians of his time may make it more understandable, but it still
doesn't mean that he wasn't anti-semitic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;It seems to me to be a little naive to condemn him with
&gt;&quot;anti-Semitism&quot; (used in the way that this expression has come to
&gt; mean today).

"/>

I don't find it naive at all. Someone who hates Jews is anti-semitic,
no matter what the reasons for it or when he said it. This definition
applies unless you happen to be Joe Sobran, who says an anti-semite is
someone Jews hate.

It certainly would have seemed blasphemous to Donne and his audience,
who were familiar with the sacrament of extreme unction, which Donne's
particular blood-libel clearly evokes. If it had occurred to Donne that
his mythical Jews didn't think their actions were blasphemous, I think
he would have ascribed that to their barbarism.

Donne argues that the Jews not only anoint their dead with the blood of
Christians, but that they do so because they secretly believe that Jesus
actually was the Messiah. He will not even allow the possibility that
they are honestly mistaken in their beliefs; they are so corrupt that
they know the truth and still reject it. How is this not anti-Semitic?

The thing I find puzzling is why Jim, and now you, are so keen on
pretending that Donne's sermon was not blatantly anti-Semitic. That he
could hold such beliefs certainly complicates my picture of him, but I
can deal with it. Is it really be so traumatic for either of you to
acknowledge that a seventeenth-century Anglican clergyman held views
that many now consider repugnant? He did.

Right. I'm sure Donne and his audience thought the mythical Christian-
blood-smearing Jews might actually have some chance of achieving
salvation via their gruesome parody of extreme unction.

It's rather disconcerting that you're the third person so far who's
treated Donne's morbid fantasy about the Jews as though it might have
some basis in fact.

Interesting that the pound of flesh was located in a place that would

to humanizing and empathizing with an old Jew, Abraham, as Abraham
struggles to understand God's command to become circumsized. That
alone should excuse Donne from any charges of &quot;anti-Semitism&quot;, and
rather charge his mention of the blood ritual to ignorance.

You don't need to have poor Christians hanging around waiting to
sell their blood, as Kositsky ridiculously imagines things. I'm quite

for any Jew who looked.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Why? If he believed that some Jews were sympathetic toward Christianity,
then why wouldn't these same Jews have contacts with Christians who

&gt;The relevant

Steese, crawl out of your hermetically sealed, black and white world
for a second, and think about what anti-Semitism means today, and
how Kositsky is using the term to dismiss Donne while excusing
Shakespeare. Supposedly what Donne said about the blood ritual
means to her that he hated Jews. I can't see how a brief mention
of a ritual which he may or may not have really believed existed,
which was brought up to illustrate another point entirely, means
that Donne hated Jews. Today, the term &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; has come
to mean a personal hatred of the Jews, to the point that you want
them exterminated. You could, if you want to call Donne &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;
in the general sense of just not wanting to practice or promote
Judaism, call him &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;, but only if you recognize that
*every* Christian, including Shakespeare, including Christianity itself,
was &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; in that sense, and that Donne was hardly
extraordinary. In fact, if you read Donne's sermons, for example,
the sermon preached on New Year's Day in 1624/5 at St. Dunstan's,
you will see that he goes to great lengths to humanize the Jews.
In that sermon, he spends four or five pages bringing Abraham to life,
making his listeners understand the struggle that Abraham had undergone in
the course of obeying God's order to become circumcised. If Donne
hated Jews, I hardly think he would have gone to the trouble.

Absolutely. Although they didn't need them so much because many of
their ideas about Christians were true. The Christians killed Jews (in
great numbers during the Crusades, to use but one example), they
exiled them, and before their exile Jews were made to live around
cathedrals (ever been to Lincoln Cathedral?) so they could be trotted
out and hassled on Christian holidays, etc. In other words, the
Christians held the power as the Jews were a minority, and they saw
the Jews, as a people, responsible for the crucifixion of Christ. The
fact that Jesus was Jewish also was too often forgotten, or he was
understood to be in a different category.

&gt;&gt;&gt; had for the Jews, or was it just part of the world view of Christians
&gt;&gt;&gt; of his time?

&gt;&gt;You make a good point; however, what you call the &quot;world view&quot; of most
&gt;&gt;Christians of his time may make it more understandable, but it still
&gt;&gt;doesn't mean that he wasn't anti-semitic.

&gt; If you want me to believe that he was anti-Semitic, in the modern
&gt; sense of a personal hatred of Jews, you are going to have to show
&gt; me something other than a brief passage mentioning a ritual
&gt; he had heard about, used to make another point.

"/>

It is a &quot;blood libel,&quot; Jim. I've suggested books to you so you can see
how widespread that kind of statement was, and how it showed intense
hatred of the Jews. If you want me to reproduce everything scholars
say about the period and the people (including Donne) who lived then,
it would take several days. I don't have the time to do it and I'm
sure you don't have the inclination to read all I write. What
fascinates me most, though, is your disinclination to believe that
Donne was talking about ritual murder and that he was an anti-semite.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;It seems to me to be a little naive to condemn him with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;anti-Semitism&quot; (used in the way that this expression has come to
&gt;&gt;&gt; mean today).

&gt;&gt;I don't find it naive at all. Someone who hates Jews is anti-semitic,
&gt;&gt;no matter what the reasons for it or when he said it. This definition
&gt;&gt;applies unless you happen to be Joe Sobran, who says an anti-semite is
&gt;&gt;someone Jews hate.

&gt; I don't see how that passage shows that Donne hated Jews. If you
&gt; read his other sermons, it's obvious that he sees the Jews as
&gt; human beings. Donne was no more or less anti-Semitic than Shakespeare.

"/>

I'm not sure how true that is. All we have of Shakespeare is his
portrait of Shylock, which I see has been brought up elsewhere,
together with other writings by Donne. If I can get to those remarks,
I'll respond to them.

Well, Shylock *is* IMO an ambiguous character. He is nasty, grasping,
and cruel (although if you look carefully you'll see the reason for
his cruelty towards Antonio is Antonio's cruelty towards him earlier)
but he is also victimized by other characters (none of whom are very
virtuous, by the way), and he has the marvellous &quot;Hath not a Jew...&quot;
speech in which Shakespeare appears to be telling us that like
everyone else, Shylock is a human being and worthy of our concern.
I'll reproduce it for you here:

Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs,

dimensions, senses, affections, passions; fed with

the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject

to the same diseases, heal'd by the same means,

warm'd and cool'd by the same winter and summer,

as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?

If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you

poison us, shall we not die?&quot; (III, i, 58-66)

The fact that I've seen Jewish men play the part lately suggests to me
that others can see the ambiguity in his character. This ambiguity, by
the way, is very unusual for its time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;And interestingly, he chose to change early versions
&gt;&gt;of the story MOV is based on, so that the pound of flesh was closest
&gt;&gt;to the heart, and was not the genitals of the victim. I imagine the
&gt;&gt;earlier versions were rooted in a fear of circumcision.

&gt; Interesting that the pound of flesh was located in a place that would
&gt; kill a man, don't you think?

"/>

I'm not saying in the least that what Shylock wanted was &quot;a good
thing,&quot; Jim. There's no question it would be murder. I'm just saying
that within the context of the play we can see Shylock both as evil
and at the same time as an intensely human character, out to get
Antonio because Antonio had heaped abuse on him for years.

If you read Donne's sermon on New Year's

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Day 1624/5 at St. Dunstan's, you'll see him devote several pages
&gt; to humanizing and empathizing with an old Jew, Abraham, as Abraham
&gt; struggles to understand God's command to become circumsized. That
&gt; alone should excuse Donne from any charges of &quot;anti-Semitism&quot;, and
&gt; rather charge his mention of the blood ritual to ignorance.

"/>

First, I would say that Abraham is a Biblical Jew, and the feelings of
Donne and others towards Jews in the Bible, classical Jews if you
will, were intensely different from their feelings towards real Jews
who lived in the world at that time. Many Christians seemed to be able
to separate the two in their minds. In fact they had to, because Jesus
was a real tripping place if they didn't. Second, I would look at
Dickens, much more modern. What more anti-semitic portrait is there
than that of Fagin in _Oliver Twist_? And yet Dickens has a
wonderfully sympathetic Jew, a minor character, in _Our Mutual
Friend_. Does that lessen the greasiness or egregious wickedness of
Fagin, and does it excuse Dickens for painting him so? I'm not sure,
but somehow I don't think so.

"/>

Jim, this is not the case at all. This is what I actually said: &quot;I'd
just like to also put my two cents in regarding Donne. I always
thought he was a fabulous poet. I still do. But then I found out he
was an anti-semite of the worse stripe (his writings on the subject
sicken me) and I don't know which pocket to put that in. So I can't
say that my sensibility approaches his at all, or that his is modern.&quot;

I'd still say that Donne's &quot;blood libel&quot; writings sicken me, that he
is anti-semitic, and that is a problem for me, a Jew, when I approach
his poetry, even though he is a product of a different age and so I
can see your position to a degree (but not emotionally). This
denigration of the Jews still lingers in some religious settings, by
the way. It is part of a very old tradition. My husband was playing
organ in church around Easter when the minister said: &quot;Judas was an
EVIL MAN. Judas was a JEW.&quot; He emphasised the words as I have done
here, seemingly forgetting that Jesus and all the other disciples were
also Jews. He was also so carried away by his own rhetoric that he
forgot his own organist was Jewish. ;)

I'm not keen on Shylock either (you'll notice I said nothing about him
or Shakespeare in my first statement), and I'm not excusing
Shakespeare at all; however, I do think that he was ahead of his time
in painting Shylock as an ambiguous character (taking into account the
confines of the tradition of the period). And if Donne was a rational
and intelligent man, and we are taught to believe he was, surely he
could have been ahead of his time also?

It has taken me a long time, and much reading, to reach these
conclusions.

Best wishes,
Lynne

Yes, that's true. Absolutely. But if you look at the narratives of relatives
of slave owners in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, as I
did when writing four children's books about slavery, you will see that
there were some whites who were not racists and did not agree with the
terrible treatment of the slaves. In fact much of what we know about
inhumane treatment of slaves comes from hearings in which relatives of slave
owners and others spoke out in the slaves' defence. One assumes that in
almost every age there are some forward thinkers who break away from the
conventional. Of course, all this brings us to the question of whether
ethics are absolute or relative, which is a very big question indeed.

And there I have to rest my case because I have so much to do for Chanukah
and Christmas.

Best wishes to all (for the second time) I hope you all have loving and
peaceful holidays and that the New Year brings you health and happiness.

&gt; of slave owners in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, as
I
&gt; did when writing four children's books about slavery, you will see that
&gt; there were some whites who were not racists and did not agree with the
&gt; terrible treatment of the slaves.

"/>

The two do not necessarily go together. Just because a person disagreed with
treating slaves badly does not make that person a non-racist. Abraham
Lincoln was certainly a racist by our standards.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In fact much of what we know about
&gt; inhumane treatment of slaves comes from hearings in which relatives of

Which has nothing to do with the fact that the American South in the 19th
century was racist (the American north, as far as that goes, and a goodly
part of the world). Being racist does not automatically mean a person
advocates the mistreatment of slaves, or even the institution itself.

Hey, all thee, I must protest!

As the Author of this thread, purposely developed as anti-thesis to standard
Elizabethan fare, where do you go but to authorship issues in the Work? And
yet as politicians!

On listerning to the new CD series /BBC Audio Books America/ the impact of
Othello is clear - this introduction by worm-tongued Iago to soft-spoke and
absent-ethiced Rodrigo, thence to the panic of the good father, and thence
to the prosecution of this Alien!

Such satire! How can you prose otherwise? In this case it is a Jew who is
the alien, and an imperfect Jew, much as anyman, who professes his love
unashamed.

Such talk of blood degradations is Iago-tongued, no? The coward, the biggest
coward in all literature, nevermind his froward advocacy.

Such satire!

And as the Author thus addresses the human condition, he notices this state
of cowardice in oursleves, and what force it has!

What you may make of Donne, be it more direct, as befits the passion of this
writer; so couple not thy valiance, Casio.

How should she be black and witty?

&gt;Jim, this is not the case at all. This is what I actually said: &quot;I'd

The problem is, there are no Donne &quot;writings&quot; on the subject of
&quot;anti-Semitism&quot;. There is a passing reference in one
sermon to the Jews anointing the dead with Christian blood. Why
your &quot;blood runs cold&quot; when you see this, but doesn't when you
read Shylock's comments makes no sense to me.

As far as Donne's &quot;sensibility&quot; goes, I assume that anyone using
that word means his artistic sensibility, and he certainly was
&quot;modern&quot; in his rejection of the old forms and the freedom of
his verse. You can't reject Donne's art on the basis of one sentence
in a sermon, unless you want to reject Shakespeare's art too for
4 acts in the play MOV.

Well, your not being consistent. Shakespeare as far as I can
tell expressed no pro-Jewish statements in his writing, and many
anti-Jew, while Donne has far more pro-Jew statements in his
sermons than anti.

"/>

Donne didn't suggest ANYTHING as far as how the blood was obtained.
It was Shapiro's and your suggestion. All Donne was saying was that
even the Jews thought Jesus might have been the Messiah. I find
it difficult to believe that Donne would simultaneously believe that
Jews would commit the sin of murder, and then use that murder as
an instrument in their salvation.

&gt;It is a &quot;blood libel,&quot; Jim. I've suggested books to you so you can see
&gt;how widespread that kind of statement was, and how it showed intense
&gt;hatred of the Jews.

"/>

Your thinking on this is very muddled. You don't seem to be able
to distinguish a personal hatred of the Jews from simply using
a legend or story about them to illustrate another point. The issue
is not how widespread these apocryphal stories were, but whether
or not Donne was actively &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; in the sense that he
had a personal hatred of the Jews. If there were hardly any Jews
in England, it is no big surprise to me that stories about their
supposed behavior were widely known, because that's the kind
of thing that ignorance breeds. Much the same stories
must have been promulgated about the Muslims. Just because
someone tells a &quot;dumb Polack&quot; joke doesn't mean that they have
a personal hatred of the Poles.

&gt;fascinates me most, though, is your disinclination to believe that
&gt;Donne was talking about ritual murder and that he was an anti-semite.

"/>

You've just finished saying that statements concerning blood libel
were common in England. So how does that single out Donne
for an anti-Semitism that was any different from what was practiced
by every Christian in that time and place, including Shakespeare?
If Donne had said in the sermon &quot;Jews murder Christians for their
blood, and we should all hate them&quot;, you might have a point, but
nowhere there or anywhere else does he say that.

&gt;Well, Shylock *is* IMO an ambiguous character.

Don't confuse &quot;ambiguity&quot; with &quot;human-like complexity&quot;. Shakespeare
unambiguously presents Shylock as the bad guy, just as Iago is made
to be complex. The blood-libel in MOV is far more overt than what Donne
wrote in his sermon. Shylock refers to Antonio as &quot;carrion flesh&quot; (&quot;You'll

Three thousand ducats.&quot;) Not to mention Shylock's grasping materialism,
an obvious caricature of the &quot;rich Jew&quot;:

&quot;A diamond gone, cost me two thousand ducats in Franford!

Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;He is nasty, grasping,

&gt;virtuous, by the way), and he has the marvellous &quot;Hath not a Jew...&quot;
&gt;speech in which Shakespeare appears to be telling us that like
&gt;everyone else, Shylock is a human being and worthy of our concern.
&gt;I'll reproduce it for you here:

&gt;Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs,

&gt;dimensions, senses, affections, passions; fed with

&gt;the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject

&gt;to the same diseases, heal'd by the same means,

&gt;warm'd and cool'd by the same winter and summer,

&gt;as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?

&gt;If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you

&gt;poison us, shall we not die?&quot; (III, i, 58-66)

&gt;The fact that I've seen Jewish men play the part lately suggests to me
&gt;that others can see the ambiguity in his character. This ambiguity, by
&gt;the way, is very unusual for its time.

"/>

Sure about that? In Marlowe's &quot;Jew of Malta&quot;, Barabas says things
like:

&quot;I have no charge, nor many children,
But one sole daughter, whom I hold as dear
As Agamemnon did his Iphigen&quot;.

In any case, if you read Donne's sermons, you will see that he has
a much broader view of Jews than what you seem to see in his
one comment about anointing the dead with Christian blood.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;And interestingly, he chose to change early versions
&gt;&gt;&gt;of the story MOV is based on, so that the pound of flesh was closest
&gt;&gt;&gt;to the heart, and was not the genitals of the victim. I imagine the
&gt;&gt;&gt;earlier versions were rooted in a fear of circumcision.

&gt;&gt; Interesting that the pound of flesh was located in a place that would
&gt;&gt; kill a man, don't you think?

&gt;I'm not saying in the least that what Shylock wanted was &quot;a good
&gt;thing,&quot; Jim. There's no question it would be murder. I'm just saying
&gt;that within the context of the play we can see Shylock both as evil
&gt;and at the same time as an intensely human character, out to get
&gt;Antonio because Antonio had heaped abuse on him for years.

"/>

And I say, for the purposes of determining the anti-Semitism of
Shakespeare, that's as useful as reading what Donne says about
the Jews elsewhere.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;If you read Donne's sermon on New Year's
&gt;&gt; Day 1624/5 at St. Dunstan's, you'll see him devote several pages
&gt;&gt; to humanizing and empathizing with an old Jew, Abraham, as Abraham
&gt;&gt; struggles to understand God's command to become circumsized. That
&gt;&gt; alone should excuse Donne from any charges of &quot;anti-Semitism&quot;, and
&gt;&gt; rather charge his mention of the blood ritual to ignorance.

&gt;First, I would say that Abraham is a Biblical Jew, and the feelings of
&gt;Donne and others towards Jews in the Bible, classical Jews if you
&gt;will, were intensely different from their feelings towards real Jews
&gt;who lived in the world at that time.

"/>

How could the English have any real feelings toward Jews of their
own time if they never met any? How do you know what Donne's feelings
were toward &quot;real Jews&quot;? In the passage from the sermon, he seems
to have sympathy for them, because even they recognize the
possibility that Jesus was the Messiah.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Many Christians seemed to be able
&gt;to separate the two in their minds. In fact they had to, because Jesus
&gt;was a real tripping place if they didn't. Second, I would look at
&gt;Dickens, much more modern. What more anti-semitic portrait is there
&gt;than that of Fagin in _Oliver Twist_? And yet Dickens has a
&gt;wonderfully sympathetic Jew, a minor character, in _Our Mutual
&gt;Friend_. Does that lessen the greasiness or egregious wickedness of
&gt;Fagin, and does it excuse Dickens for painting him so? I'm not sure,
&gt;but somehow I don't think so.

"/>

You've dismissed Donne entirely because of what you perceive is
&quot;anti-Semitism&quot;, but if you were consistent you would dismiss Shakespeare
as well.

I've always thought that Shylock's best defence is his exposure of the

neighbour while trading in human flesh (it's interesting that Shakespeare
doesn't have Portia hear this point, because it's hard to see how she could
have countered it):

DUKE How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?

SHYLOCK What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?

You have among you many a purchased slave,

Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,

You use in abject and in slavish parts,

Because you bought them: shall I say to you,

Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?

Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds

Be made as soft as yours and let their palates

Be season'd with such viands? You will answer

'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you.

verb &quot;jew&quot; means &quot;to cheat or swindle,&quot; and the combined form &quot;to jew down&quot;
means &quot;to bargain to reduce a price.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as the origin of the blood I don't know what Donne was

&gt;&gt;&gt; then.

&gt;&gt;Try harder. Absent any means of typing, preserving, and transfusing
&gt;&gt;human blood, or otherwise making it medically useful, it has no
&gt;&gt;commercial value. You can't sell something no one wants to buy.

&gt; But supposedly Jews needed it, and it would certainly make more
&gt; sense to buy it rather than kill for it. Are you certain that there
&gt; was no method to preserve blood in its liquid form? Couldn't you
&gt; sprinkle dried blood and accomplish the same thing?

As no Jews were actually obtaining Christian blood, it's a moot point. If
Donne had given the story as much thought as you have, he would have

&gt;&gt;that Christians were willingly selling their blood to Jews for use in
&gt;&gt;blasphemous rituals.

&gt; Why? If he believed that some Jews were sympathetic toward

If you can imagine that Donne's claims that the Jews &quot;now..expresse a kind

to justify commenting on it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; then why wouldn't these same Jews have contacts with Christians who were
&gt; sympathetic with them? Do you really believe that the average Christian
&gt; was educated enough in those days that they would fully understand what
&gt; was blasphemous and what was not?

"/>

I believe that the average Christian in England was well aware that Jews
were associated with blasphemy. When Shakespeare included &quot;Liver of
blaspheming Jew&quot; in the ingredients for a witches' brew, I think he
expected his audience to understand the reference.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; These same people believed that dead pidgeons would suck the bad

And they believed that Jews used Christian blood in blasphemous rituals.
Look up the history of the blood-libel if you don't believe me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Blood letting might have been rampant, but I can't see a Christian
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sitting still while a Jew took his blood, can you?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, a poor Christian in need of some cash.

&gt;&gt;Sure, why not risk eternal damnation for some ready cash?

&gt; Ah, I see. So there was never any murder or adultery then either.
&gt; Come on Steese.

"/>

I'll concede that some poor Christians might have resorted to committing
murder to obtain cash, but I don't see how adultery would have enriched
them. Neither am I sure that murder or adultery would have been seen as
grave an offense in a Christian as aiding and abetting the blasphemous
rituals of the barbarous Jews, but since those rituals were completely
mythical, it's not worth worrying about.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;The relevant question isn't whether you can see it, but whether Donne
&gt;&gt;could have seen it, and since Jews were not, in fact, practicing
&gt;&gt;blasphemous rituals with Christians' blood, it is highly unlikely that
&gt;&gt;Donne would have believed they were but also believed they were
&gt;&gt;obtaining the blood via relatively humane cash transactions rather
&gt;&gt;than murder.

&gt; I have no idea what Donne thought about the source of the blood. He
&gt; doesn't say anything about it. All he says is that they &quot;keep in
&gt; readiness the blood of some Christian&quot;.

"/>

As I have already noted, you'd have a better context for Donne's remarks if
you were familiar with the history of the blood-libel against the Jews.
The historical context is crucial here. One good starting point is this
page at the Internet Medieval Source Book:

Wikipedia.com also has a good introduction to the subject:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And it would have had to be fresh blood.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why? The passage in Donne doesn't mention anything about the
&gt;&gt;&gt; freshness of the blood.

&gt;&gt;As Donne was presumably aware, blood didn't keep very well in the
&gt;&gt;sixteenth century. If the Jews kept a supply on hand at all times for
&gt;&gt;anointing the dead, it would have had to be fresh.

&gt; Still don't see why dried blood or blood treated in some way to
&gt; remain liquid wasn't possible. Did you check all those alchemical
&gt; recipes?

"/>

The question is not whether it was possible but whether Donne would have
thought that Jews would obtain the blood of Christians without killing
them. It is highly unlikely that he would have thought so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If one reads Shapiro and other authors who speak about blood libel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;etc. with regard to this period, it seems clear that many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Christians of the time believed Jews capable of all sorts of crimes,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;including murder.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't doubt it, but surely these same Christians also believed
&gt;&gt;&gt; that pretty much any person was capable of murder.

&gt;&gt;Yes, and they believed that anybody who kept a supply of Christian
&gt;&gt;blood handy at all times had committed murder to obtain it.

&gt; You don't know that. You are assuming that Donne thought that.

"/>

It's a reasonable assumption to anyone familiar with the history of anti-
Jewish persecution.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;[snip]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, you are going to have to define &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; a little
&gt;&gt;&gt; better. Christianity is, after all, fundamentally &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;.

&gt;&gt;It seems to me that if believing that Jews keep a supply of Christian
&gt;&gt;blood handy for blasphemous rituals is not anti-Semitic, then the term
&gt;&gt;has no meaning.

&gt; Steese, crawl out of your hermetically sealed, black and white world
&gt; for a second, and think about what anti-Semitism means today,

"/>

As the term has only existed since 1882, it means today pretty much the
same thing it's always meant: &quot;hostility toward or discrimination against
Jews as a religious, ethnic, or racial group&quot; ( ).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and how Kositsky is using the term to dismiss Donne while excusing
&gt; Shakespeare.

"/>

As Lynne has already pointed out, she did not use the term to dismiss
Donne, and she did not excuse Shakespeare.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Supposedly what Donne said about the blood ritual means to her that he
&gt; hated Jews. I can't see how a brief mention of a ritual which he may
&gt; or may not have really believed existed, which was brought up to
&gt; illustrate another point entirely, means that Donne hated Jews.

"/>

If you can't see it, the only explanation I can think of is that you're
wholly unfamiliar with the history of libel and persecution that has
pursued the Jews since the earliest days of Christendom.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Today, the term &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; has come to mean a personal hatred of
&gt; the Jews, to the point that you want them exterminated.

"/>

To whom? Joseph Sobran is widely condemned as anti-Semitic, but so far as
I know no one has argued that he has a personal hatred of the Jews or wants
them exterminated. He is undeniably hostile towards them as a religious,
ethnic, or racial group, though.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You could, if you want to call Donne &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; in the general sense
&gt; of just not wanting to practice or promote Judaism, call him &quot;anti
&gt; -Semitic&quot;, but only if you recognize that *every* Christian, including
&gt; Shakespeare, including Christianity itself, was &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; in that
&gt; sense, and that Donne was hardly extraordinary.

"/>

Christianity required (and requires) its adherents to believe that Judaism
is heretical in its refusal to acknowledge that Jesus was the Messiah, but
it never required its adherents to believe in the blood-libel. That Donne
would have promoted such a story indicates that he had more than a merely
doctrinal problem with Jews. I would prefer to think that he was naive
enough to believe it: I find it difficult to imagine that he promoted such
a monstrous lie knowing it was a lie.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In fact, if you read Donne's sermons, for example, the sermon preached on
&gt; New Year's Day in 1624/5 at St. Dunstan's, you will see that he goes to
&gt; great lengths to humanize the Jews. In that sermon, he spends four or
&gt; five pages bringing Abraham to life, making his listeners understand the
&gt; struggle that Abraham had undergone in the course of obeying God's order
&gt; to become circumcised. If Donne hated Jews, I hardly think he would have
&gt; gone to the trouble.

"/>

Abraham lived before the Advent of Christ, and so he could be comfortably
nestled within Christian theology, in the same way that Jesus is
comfortably nestled within Islamic theology (as, indeed, is Abraham). It
is perfectly possible for a Muslim to revere Abraham and Jesus while
despising modern Jews and Christians; it was just as possible for Donne to
revere Abraham while despising modern Jews.

I agree. I've been reading this thread with interest because I would
like to tackle this aspect of Nashe's work on my website, and have
never felt competent to do so. It isn't fair to judge individuals in
a broadly racist/sexist culture by the standards of a different age,
but at the same time you can hardly allow racism to pass without
comment.

So - if you think MoV is anti-Semitic, you should try reading passages
from Nashe's 'The Unfortunate Traveller'. For those who haven't seen
it, it's the picaresque adventures of an English page attending his
master through Italy. All foreigners in it are stereotypes - as so
to some extent are the English, but positive stereotypes of course -
but the treatment of Jews is particularly nasty. It always surprises
me that discussions of anti-semitism in Shakespeare usually mention
Marlowe but seldom seem to bring Nashe in for comparison.

Lynne mentioned Peter Shapiro's book, which I read while trying to
research this. In it he identified the main anti-Semitic stereotypes
circulating in early modern England. Well, the Jews Nashe invents for
'The Unfortunate Traveller' would satisfy almost every bullet point.
They are sadistic; miserly; motivated by a hatred of all Christians;
personally disgusting in their habits, and even (under guise of a
Jewish doctor subjecting Jack to vivisection) guilty of attempting to
drain the blood of nice Christian boys. Admittedly they don't poison
any wells, but one has a game try at poisoning the Pope's mistress.
It's almost as if Nashe was working with a copy of Shapiro's book open
in front of him, sedulously constructing his stereotype to meet its
profile. For example when a rich Jew loses his temper - because his
goods have just been confiscated, which every Elizabethan Christian
seems firmly to have believed was the one thing guaranteed to enrage a
Jew - he explodes into a series of threats that read like an attempt
to meet some anti-semitic checklist. Brace yourselves, I'm about to
quote it:

'If I must be banisht' (Jews as aliens), 'if those heathen dogs (Jews
as Christian-haters) 'will needs rob me of my goods' (Jewish
materialism), 'I will poyson their springs and conduit heades, whence
they receiue al their water round about the citie;'(well-poisoning)
'Ile tice all the young children into my house that I can get, and
cutting their throates' (blood libel) 'barrell them vp in poudring
beefe tubbes, and so send them to victuall the Popes gallies' (Jews
profiteer from supplying dodgy meat to the armed forces?). 'Ere the
officers come to extend, Ile bestow an hundred pound on a doale of
breade' (hypocritical Jewish charity), 'which Ile cause to be kneaded
with scorpions oyle that will kill more than the plague.' (suggestive
link to Jews as furtherers of plague) 'Ile hire them that make their
wafers or sacramentary gods, to minge them after the same sort'
(desecration of the Host), 'so in the zeale of their superstitious
religion shall they languish and droup like carrion...'

Has Nashe left anything out? I don't think so. Even Hitler might
have boggled at compressing so much anti-Semitism into a single
speech. This rant - which literally out-Herods Herod - perhaps calls
into question how seriously Nashe could have meant his portrayal of
life among the Jews to be taken by his readers (and unlike Marlowe or
Shakespeare of course, his work had to be read, it was not accessible
to illiterate groundlings); but it reads very badly to a modern mind.

Another point about Nashe that often seems to escape commentators on
Elizabethan anti-Semitism is that he was actually present at the
arraignment of Lopez. This gives him a personal interest in the case
that both Marlowe and Shakespeare lack.

Sorry to have hijacked a Donne thread, and apologies to all who had to
read the above quote on an empty stomach. I have worried for a long
time about how to tackle this aspect of Nashe's work. In a previous
age it would be his erotic poem that was the Unmentionable, now it's
this.

But how is this anti-Semitic? It's just a series of curses emitted by someone
subjected to injustice. I'm sure it was meant to cast a very bad light on the
Jews, and it does give the Jew the anti-semite's idea of what he'd say, but it
doesn't seem very anti-semitic to me.

Rita, that was a most interesting and pungent post.

I am interested in this antisemitic aspect of exclusion from formal society,
and, while Jews were typical subjects for various projections and
exclusions, are they, in this period, say 1590-1612, merely the scape-goats
du jour?

After this time we encounter other handy victims, Catholics, for example.

To contrast Donne with the Author, and where Donne is said to be an atypical
Elizabethan writer, here is a general statement by the Author on this idea
of exclusions:-

Would you be pleased
To find a nation of such barbarous temper
That, breaking out in hideous violence,
Would not afford you an abode on earth,
Whet their detested knives against your throats,
Spurn you like dogs....?
What would you think
To be thus used? This is the stranger's case
And this your mountainish inhumanity.

A psychological point, &amp; from Othello:-

'Tis in ourselves that we are thus and thus.

&amp; this line;

Which might accite thee to embrace--

// a very rare word 'accite', which affords a link to TitusA:

He by the senate is accited home.

And so to the anti-immigration law 1593.

But it is in Othello that we have a Lover and a Jew combined, and my
question is; do we witness one man persecuted for both crimes? The Author,
never more biographical than in Hamlet, is regretting sex:-

Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamèd bed,
Stewed in corruption, honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty! --

which continues with that admontion to his Mother

Refrain tonight,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To the next abstinence; the next more easy ;
For use can almost change the stamp of nature.

to which his uncle then comments about the madness of great ones.

Has Othello become Romeo and Juliet continued? Is the Author soured? As sour
as was Donne, and do they admit their own melancholy, projecting it to
various degrees on others? Donne was very generous with distaste, lavishing
it on one and all, and we are cheated of seeing his muturer view. However,
the Author continues to kill all his lovers (!) and Hamlet/Author's crime is
notably to kill his mother's lover, while his natural father seems to have
no faults at all!

That's a ramble, not a thesis. But is this submerged but very potent and
organic element of sex in the works by writers at this time an unappreciated
element til, perhaps 350 years later when we can encounter more forthright
characters in George Eliot, and then Lawrence's? Do we overlook it and
substitute projections of dissatisfactions in other races, races we have not
integrated to ourselves, so to speak?

Especially projecting onto sensuous southern races.

Cordially, Phil Innes

&gt; a) someone who in ignorant good faith trusts the negative image of
&gt; Jews universal in his culture,
&gt; and
&gt; b) someone who wilfully chooses to defy both modern ideals of racial
&gt; tolerance and normal rational processes in order to believe Jews are
&gt; innately evil.

"/>

If you don't like the term, you're free to invent another. I see that
James Shapiro critizes applying the term to three-hundred-year-old
beliefs, and he has a point.

Please note, though, that I did not say that Donne was an anti-Semite.
People may hold anti-Semitic beliefs without being defined by them.
Shapiro notes that Martin Luther wrote diatribes calling &quot;for the
burning of synagogues, prayer books, and Jewish homes,&quot; which goes well
beyond any hostility expressed by Donne, but there was more to Luther's
work than expressions of anti-Semitic beliefs.

In my opinion neither Donne nor Luther should be condemned because they
expressed such beliefs; but the expressions should not be glossed over,
either. I believe you go too far in suggesting that Nashe, Shakespeare
and Donne acted only in &quot;ignorant good faith&quot; in trusting a &quot;universal&quot;
negative image. They were creators of culture in addition to being
recipients of it. If they are to receive credit for the ways in which
their work rose above the prevalent cultural stereotypes, they should
also be faulted for the ways in which it did not. We are all influenced
by the culture that surrounds us, but we are not enslaved by it.

Where do you see inconsistency? A recurrent theme in blood-libel

It's the same notion. Donne is simply being more allusive than other

by Jews was not his principal subject.

I *am* judging him on his own terms, the terms of a 17th-Century
Anglican clergyman who would have considered the ritual he described to
be a blasphemous parody of the sacrament of Extreme Unction. Donne was
repeating a folktale to make the point that Christ was so obviously the
Savior that even the degenerate Jews secretly acknowledged it. The only
inconsistency comes from attempting to apply modern logic to a folktale.

Yes. I can't argue with that. Perhaps in the end one has to make
subjective judgements on each individual case. Personally, I can
overlook Nashe's anti-Semitic writing as I can his sexism: I accept he
failed to rise above prevailing cultural attitudes in those areas, but
forgive him because so few of us, in any age, really challenge the
cultural status quo. In his bloodyminded readiness to shake off
English social cringe and have his say, however, I think Nashe
sometimes did.

But it's not. There is all the difference in the world between a blood

I can put this no more plainly than, if I were an Elizabethan, having

version, and respecting his learning as far superior to mine; my
reaction would be along the lines of: &quot;Oh. _That's_ how the story

some hope for reconciliation, after all, even though they've gone

No golden age since 600 years, sure - there was the interuption of all that
legal and ecclesiastic Latin plus Norman French.which in the mid middle ages
made England a tri-languaged nation.

But hey! You happen to be agreeing with the greatest Elizabethan historian
of the C20th (whose words I employed) who was so conservative that he
observed the same, but greater conservancy tending in others (academically)
and said that some Shakespearean ideas, much worked over, were hardly worth
additional comment, and new ideas on the subject &quot;often took a generation or
two to surface academicaaly&quot; - but this most conservative of writers was
less so than what I observe of some current Strats here!

He posited, for example, a substantial possibility that Bacon was the major
&lt;emphasis&gt; influence on LLL. (This is why I wrote to your note one month ago
&quot;Wherefore the love of women&quot; since it is a hardly disguised neo-platonic
text, and all too brotherly and intellectual &lt;grin&gt;)

This same author has supposed collaborations on subsequent plays, although
this influence, in his opinion, diminishes towards the later Works.

An artist's job is to create something beautiful, it's not his job to rise
above
cultural stereotypes or be a schoolmarm. In this case it's especially
silly to expect Donne, who was a Christian minister, to rise
above the stereotypes that his own religion helped to foster, something
that Shakespeare couldn't do either, given his portrayal of Shylock
and his other comments involving Jews. Donne's Christianity is so
ingrained in Donne that by accusing him of anything more than pro-Christianity
you indict all Christians of that time of the same crime. How on
earth is someone who thinks of nearly everything in Christian terms
going to avoid some anti-Judaism? Here is part of a letter to R.W.,
part of which was about some news concerning the British fleet
and Guiana:

Havens are heavens, and ships winged angels be,
The which both Gospel, and stern threatenings bring;
Guiana's harvest is nipped in the spring,
I fear; and with us (me thinks) fate deals so
As with the Jews guide God did; he did show
Him the rich land, but barred his entry in,
Oh, slowness is our punishment and sin.

Should we throw Catullus in the waste bin because he talks
so casually about (gasp!) slavery?

Poem 10

My friend Varus had taken me from the forum
(I had nothing going on) to visit his latest love —
a little tart, so she struck me at first sight,
not at all without charm and wit.
When we got there we fell into conversation
on a variety of topics, among which was the question of
what Bithynia was like these days, how things were going there,
and whether it had proved at all beneficial to my purse.
I told them the truth — that there was nothing there, either for the locals
or for the praetors or for the praetor's cohort
that would cause anyone to carry a sleeker head —
especially for those who had an irrumator for a praetor,
one who didn't give a straw for his cohort.
&quot;But at the very least,&quot; they said, &quot;you must certainly
have acquired what they say is the native custom,
some slaves to bear your litter?&quot; I (thinking I would increase
my standing in the girl's eyes)
replied, &quot;Things weren't so bad for me that,
just because I'd landed a lousy province,
I wasn't able to acquire eight good strong men.&quot;
(Yet in fact I had no one, neither here nor there,
who might carry on his neck the
fractured foot of my ancient little cot.)
At this point she said — as you'd expect from a little tramp —
&quot;Please, my dear Catullus: lend them to me,
just for a short while. I want to be carried to Serapis' temple
in style.&quot;&quot;Hold on!&quot; I said to her.
&quot;That which I said I had a moment ago —
What was I thinking? My friend,
Gaius Cinna, he acquired them.
But, really, whether they're his or mine, what's that to me?
I have the use of them, just as if I bought them.
But you, with your wicked wit, are a downright plague,
who allow no one the slightest latitude of speech.&quot;

The point of my posts has not been that Donne did not have
any anti-Jewish attitudes. How could he not? One point I was
trying to make, and which has been reiterated by others, is
that you can't just utterly dismiss Donne because of some
brief passage describing an unpleasant myth about the Jews,
while simultaneously giving Shakespeare (or any other writer
of the time) a free pass. Another point I tried to make, also
reiterated by others, is that it is a far cry from simply
expressing the prejudice of your social group to expressing
a *personal* hatred of a certain ethnic or religious groups.
The latter is what the phrase &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; implies today,
conjuring up images of neo-Nazi's and the KKK, and those
things have nothing to do with Donne.

*No one* here has utterly dismissed Donne. Not Lynne, not me, not
anyone. As Lynne has already reminded you, this is what she originally

out he was an anti-semite of the worse stripe (his writings on the

If that looks like an 'utter dismissal' of Donne to you, you're seeing

Donne expressed anti-Semitic views. This may shock you, but I believe

No. That's what it implies *to you*. No one else is required to live

It's no one else's fault if you choose to overload the term anti-
Semitism so that it only applies to extremist groups. My own use of the
term coincides precisely with the definition quoted above. Shapiro has
a point about the problematic nature of the term's assumption that
Jewishness is a racial characteristic (&quot;Semitism&quot;), and I would be happy
to use a different word - anti-Judaism? - but I see no point at all in
arguing that only people who express their anti-Jewish sentiments
through group violence deserve to be criticized.
