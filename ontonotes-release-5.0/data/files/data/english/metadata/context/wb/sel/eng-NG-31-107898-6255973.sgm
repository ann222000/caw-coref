First, we need to set the parameters properly:

"Essentially, the Army is turning the war over to its dissidents [i.e.
'future RIPers to you, toopid...], who have criticized the way the
service has operated there the past three years, and is letting them
try to wage the war their way."

Now let me intersperse what I told you *last July,* you moron:

"Their role is crucial if we are to reverse the effects of four years
of conventional mind-set fighting an unconventional war," said a
Special Forces colonel who knows some of the officers."

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16979340/

Me:
"To break the insurgency we need to stop them from getting as much
support as possible. To stop them from getting support we cannot do
their recruiting for them (i.e. killing wives and kids and blowing up
some guy's building, who may not be supporting the insurgents). We
must
also provide a safe and secure environment for civilians (i.e. not
randomly blowing up kids and uncles and aunts and parents and so on,
them not getting kidnapped, etc.). We must outwit the insurgent's
*strategy* and attack their *center of gravity*, not necessarily
attack
*the insurgents.* "

(This may be too subtle for you, toopid. Let me translate into
toopidspeak for you: "Killing insurgents not always good or the goal.
That conventional warfare. This not conventional warfare.")

""Petraeus's 'brain trust' is an impressive bunch, but I think it's
too late to salvage success in Iraq," said a professor at a military
war college, who said he thinks that the general will still not have
sufficient troops to implement a genuine counterinsurgency strategy
and that the United States really has no solution for the sectarian
violence tearing apart Iraq."

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16979340/

Me:
"The bottom line: we don't have enough troops there to do COIN ops as
they should be done. GEN Shinseki understood this well and was
severely
undercut by rummy and wolfowitz. Since we don't have enough troops
there to do it properly, we are therefore not doing it properly, or
we
are therefore doing it properly in some areas and not in others
(sometimes referred to as a 'half-assed' job)."

"We have not committed the resources to winning. And that is not a
'Liberal problem.' (Wasn't it you [i.e. you, toopid] that was gloating
the Hillary wants
to increase troop size and become the next LBJ?)  Do you [i.e. you,
toopid] suppose that
might be one reason that the 'national will' is being sapped? But by
all means 'stay the course.' rummy and bushie know best. They have
such
a stellar track record."

"Some anti-war people like me might just be people who understand
that
we are feeding the insurgency and shooting ourselves in the foot in
so
many ways that 'victory' is either pushed out much further with an
unnecessary cost in lives and dollars, or that it indeed becomes
impossible."

"Having a fortress mentality simply isolates the counterinsurgent from
the fight," he wrote."

Do not for one instant dare think that I don't 'get' what is going on,
you moron. That strategy might've worked as much as several months
after our initial occupation. I do not believe it will now.

I, along with many, many others, feel that it's too little, too late.

BTW, toopid, you misrepresented what was going on... again. This
thread was not about Murtha. It was specifically about COIN strategy
and tactics. Your confused claim that you never argued with me about
that is an outright lie, or else you are mentally pretty messed up. I
suppose it could be a combination of the two as well.

The first post of this thread was, in fact, "OT: Is this how to fight
an insurgency?"

1153471155.757433.15 ... @75g2000cwc.googlegroups.com

The thread I pulled these quotes from *was* a thread about strategy
and tactics in COIN ops, you moron. Go back and read it. You can still
learn something. Oh, and quit lying. It makes your claims of superior
morality look like it's coming from former Rep. Cunningham.

Of course, you've set yourself up for a huge dilemma now, toopid:
either the proposed strategy shift for Iraq is a faulty one, or you
are forced to admit that I know a lot more than you do about these
matters and that I was correct (posted CV or no, toopid), even if I am
'RIP.'

LOL! No middle ground there, toopid. Game over.

Here's another quote out of one of the messages I quoted earlier
showing you (*not* LOL!) arguing tactics with me:

[i.e. Here's your 'conventional war' mindset, moron.]

[i.e. Here's your "force protection at all costs, even mission
failure" mentality, toopid]

Me:
No moral sacrifice, toopid. It's how you win a COIN operation.

It makes a difference that we started the war to the people that we
are
trying to win over in Iraq. They are, BTW, the same people that the
insurgents are either trying to win over or to maintain their support
with.

And since it's our war, it *is* incumbant on us to be the ones on
moral
high ground (which we've already done our best to give up in so many
ways). We are uninvited guests in somebody else's home. We should
break
as little china as possible.

*****************************************************

And as I said (before you go into another misguided "YOU DON'T SUPPORT
THE TROOPS" or some other jingoistic rant) I really do hope that it's
not too late. We 'dissidents' in the Army have been laughed at (by
people like you, rummy, and bushie, toopid) for nearly four years. If
this effort fails, it is not the fault of the soldiers trying to
implement the strategy which should have been implemented from the get-
go.

So as you see, toopid, you are lying yet again. You flounder and
thrash about, all the while having not one single small clue. Not even
one small whiff of a shadow of an outline of a trace of a small clue.

The hilarious part is how absolutely sure you are that you are
correct. And you base this certitude on... exactly what, again?

Prediction: now that toopid is backed into a corner... again, he will
pout that the post is "too long and boring" or he will disappear into
a hole in the woodwork like the small rat-like rodent he is.

LOL!

Moron.

&gt; &gt; LOL!

&gt; &gt; &gt; I never argued against your tactics etc.  I simply said withdrawal
&gt; &gt; &gt; was not an option I support.   You selectively thrashed the entire campaign
&gt; &gt; &gt; and claimed it just proved your points.

&gt; &gt; What it shows, toopid, is that I understand how to fight COIN ops.

&gt; &gt; That you missed the point is not surprising, now or then.

&gt; &gt; &gt;  But where was your discussion
&gt; &gt; &gt; and praise of McMasters success?  Not a peep from you.

&gt; &gt; Actually, I wasn't aware that COL (it's polite to use their rank,
&gt; &gt; toopid. You call privates by their last name. I *know* someone with
&gt; &gt; your vast breadth of military experience would know something as basic
&gt; &gt; as that...) McMaster was in Iraq. I note that you did not bring it up,
&gt; &gt; either.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing buy naysay and negativity.

&gt; &gt; I forgot: we give candy to kids.

&gt;   Rest my case.
">

toopid, we, and the Iraqi government, have failed miserably for four
years to provide the most basic element necessary to succeed there: a
safe and secure environment.

You can talk all you want about power generation, water supplies, and
anything else that you want to. You can quote prewar and postwar
statistics if that gives you a woody.

They do not really matter all that much without that safe and secure
environment. You prove, once again, that COIN ops are well over your
head.

And "victory is right around the corner." LOL!

Have you ever considered a career in producing jingoistic posters?

You are willing to flail around and throw mud at walls to see if any
of it sticks. Meanwhile, you gamble with what I consider some pretty
valuable national assets: our wealth and the lives of our soldiers.
You care about neither.

Instead of saying, as you do, "It will be really, really bad if things
don't go out way in Iraq!" I hope we're looking at a "Well, that
didn't go as we expected. Now what?" scenario. Sometimes things don't
go as we might hope, toopid. I'm sure that your parents were hoping
for a good-looking and smart child, for example.

Your guys blundered us into a war they wanted so badly they could
taste it. "March to war" and all of that.

In 18 months or so, it is likely that we may have to say, "It looks
like we made a very bad move." I would advocate some pretty intense
contingency planning. You would advocate pissing away more national
wealth and throwing some more mud at the wall. So there we are.

I just love it when you criticize my military career choices,
especially since you were too fat, dumb and lazy to ever serve...

No, I retired and opened my own business. I get a military pension,
toopid. Health care. Space A travel. Tax-free shopping. Cheap hotels
all over the world. I get saluted every time I go onto a military
base. And I can still wear my uniform if I want to! All of this for
the rest of my life. And all paid for by you! I hardly call that
'nothing.' Had I quit at 18 years, that would have been for nothing.

As I've told you time and again, I chose to retire rather than leading
my soldiers into battle with a strategy that I did not support and
leading in areas that I was not expert in (go look at what the
artillery is doing in Iraq, toopid). At my level, I felt that I should
have a pretty good grasp of the TTP in whatever area I was leading.

You choose to call me names for that decision. I call that integrity.
I would, after all, be the one writing those "Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith:
I regret to inform you that...." letters. I would probably have to
look them in the eye at some point. But not you, toopid! You sit on
your fat, lazy ass and criticize decisions that you or your family
will never have to make.

You are a sad, defective POS, toopid. A really substandard being.

I fully support this COA, toopid. I have all along.

I just think it's too late. So do many, many others with far more
knowledge and experience than you have (which is not too hard to see).
And that would be due 100% to the decisions your guys made. But I'm
sure we all hope, hope, hope that we're wrong.

I hope, hope, hope this COA can still work. My fingers are crossed.
The only other COA (other than leaving) I can see is to flood about
500k soldiers into Iraq and totally reoccupy it. The military cannot
do this without breaking. As I said to you several months ago, BTW.

And if you look at what the Army has said (Go Big, Go Long, Go Home)
it would appear that the Army's senior leadership agrees with me.

You know what sucks, toopid? Trying a last-ditch military strategy
change on a national level and 'hoping' that it works. bushie may be
the only person on Earth dumber than you are.

Then you're right: we should pull out now. We blew it in Iraq. More
accurately, bushie, rummy, et al, blew it.

I'd be willing to give 18 months to see if there's any shift first,
but if you want to quit, be my guest.

If after 18 months, there's no sign of any shift, we cut our losses
and bail. No 12-year-plan (as that is no plan) based on one successful
COIN op.

toopid is true to form. The 'logic' he uses is thus:

"Something makes me look stupid, so I ignore it. I will instead wrap
my mandible around one minor point, try everything in my power to veer
off-topic, and I will then claim 'boredom' with thqt topic, or that
the points brought up in that topic are 'insignificant.' For my next
act, I will spout off with OT subjects that demonstrate, once again,
my inablility to think through a problem, and my racial, social, and
cultural intolerance. If all else fails, I will disappear for a few
days (until I believe that everybody has forgotten how stupid I am)
and then return with one of the above tactics."

So we're in your Phase Two now, toopid. No surprise.

Except Alfred E. Neuman is much smarter than toopid.

toopid's latest foray into bizarre 'logic' is one example. He cannot
understand how somebody could support a course of action while not
being convinced it will work.

In toopid's 'world' if the US decides on a COA, it must work. Or,
apparently, if you do not believe it will work, you cannot support it.
Or some other 'logical' conclusion. AFAICT, the only place toopid's
'logic' makes any sense is in his own 'mind.'

What toopid fails to see is that the Iraqis have a say in this, too.
In any relationship, there is a window to establish an impression.
Typically, that window is not four years long. Now that we are
apparently getting serious about trying to win over the Iraqis, in
toopid's 'mind' the previous four years do not count and should be
forgotten.

Perhaps when toopid was wooing his wife he was abusive, disrespectful
and violent. Then he had an epiphany. After four years of beating her,
kicking her, throwing her to the wolves in really bad neighborhoods
and crashing in her door in at 0400, he began to treat her kindly, he
began protecting her, and he bought her flowers for the first time. We
can only imagine that toopid's wife isn't too bright (since she chose
toopid as a mate), so she immediately forgot about the previous four
years of maltreatment. They married almost immediately.

It would seem that toopid thinks that everybody reacts this way. Maybe
that guy who used to beat the snot out of toopid on his way to school
every day was the best man at toopid's wedding. Maybe toopid named
their first child after him.

Meanwhile, some people may think that it is too late, and they may
doubt that we can still successfully woo the Iraqis. But we can hope
that it isn't too late, and we can fully support the attempt. As they
say, better late than never.

In toopid's little 'mind' that is a fatal hypocritical dilemma that
cannot be solved. This is yet one more example of why he is the
biggest moron on the Usenet.
