50 / 60i Flourescent light flicker?

I shot some material in Europe with a 60i HDV camera.  I'm aware that
European and North American flourescent lights pulse at different
frequencies, which makes it difficult to shoot normal-looking video
unless you've got the right kind of cam.

So I've got a few night shots that have this ugly flicker on them, a
bit like what you get when you point your camera at a television set.

I'm not expecting any miracles here, but is there any way to clean
this up in post?  Some frame rate change, or maybe a plug-in?

I'm using Vegas, also have After Effects, and can get access to other
programs.

Unfortunately it is a bit late now. If there is a way to mitigate it in post
I don't know about it. This can be eliminated during shooting by using a
shutter speed of 1/100 second.

There is an anti-flicker plugin for Virtualdub, which might do the trick
for you

You could try layering two copies of the video with a 1 frame offset
and varying the opacity of the top layer until it looks right (it may
not, I don't have any source material to try it on, this is just a
stab in the light).  This may yield an exposure that seems to be
constant, reducing the flicker.

I will try this.

Do you mean having the top layer start just 1 frame before the lower
layer does on the timeline?

I've gotten very good results with the MSI and Donald Graft deflicker
plug-ins for VirtualDub.  It depends on how pervasive the flicker is, but
I've been able to eliminate quite a bit with a little judicious fiddling
with the plug-in.
