Baba Ramdev claims breathing exercise can cure cancer
BHUBANESWAR: Yoga guru Baba Ramdev said on Saturday that he was trying to
establish that breathing exercises could treat diseases like cancer and
thyroid-related disorders.
"Breathing exercises have the power to cure cancer and thyroid problems and
clean up clogged arteries," Ramdev, who has been teaching such exercises to
a large number of people in different places and whose claims have triggered
controversies, said after receiving the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at
the KIIT Deemed University.
The saffron-clad bearded guru received the degree from the university's
chancellor, Achyut Samanta, wearing a green robe in the presence of 1991
Nobel prize winner in Chemistry Dr Richard R Ernst and secretary in the
Union government's Department of Science and Technology, T Ramasami.
Ramdev said he was hopeful of India emerging as a world economic and
political power in another 10 to 15 years.
"The future belongs to India," he asserted.
He, however, had a dig at the present education system, saying the school
education being imparted to children now could not make a person a great
man. "I studied in the traditional system," he said.
Pointing out that this was the first doctorate he had received, Ramdev
joked, "This university has turned a baba into a doctor."
"Henceforth, call me doctor Ramdev," he quipped at the cameramen as he
received the degree.
Ernst said that people from all backgrounds should get equal opportunity in
a democracy.
"There should be no advantages by birth as democracy implies equal
opportunity for all, for both sexes," the scientist, who won the Nobel for
his path-breaking work on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and subsequent
contribution to two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, said.
Reflecting on his views on education, Ernst said children did not need any
teachers but motivators.
Ernst had earlier laid the foundation of the university's school of
biotechnology.
Ramasamy said that the greatest Indian challenge today was preparation of
the youth for innovation. It was the responsibility of the educational
system to nurture a mindset which was conducive to innovation.
