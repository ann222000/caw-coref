I've just been watching the Jesus' Tomb story on Discovery. Here is an
idea.

A partnership of Jews for Jesus types and American Evangelicals decide
to create a clone from DNA claimed to be the one an only, the famous
as can be Jesus Chirst.

Apparently, there is a real social possiblity that some sizable
segment of the Israeli Jewish population might convert to
Chiristianity. And some American Evangelicals are interested in
becoming Hebrew Christians, serving in the Israeli military, and it
all.

Ok. Now Jesus Christ the clone enters the scene. This clone is raised
to be a military leader...

Most Jews accept that the historical Jesus existed.So if it could be
shown, Jesus existed and his clone was there, why would they convert?

A clone of a 2000 year old man, does not prove he is *THE Messiah* or
that he is the son of God.

It would certainly raise considerable interest among American
Evangelicals.

To be given any military responsibility in a modern army, he would

The book The Last Day by Glenn Kleier talks about the second coming as a by
product of scientific experimentation, but not specifically by cloning.
Many of the issues are the still the same however - in the book 4
artificially born humans are concieved by the Isreali government in order to
create a super-soldier.  They did not aim to create a new Jesus but still
the book is an interesting story about how the world (including the Catholic
Church, the Middle East and the global media) would react to suggestions
that the new "son" of God is alive and among us.

Thing is, at least in my own eroding memories of Catholic theology,
the doctrine is that Christ rose in the body and ascended in that body
into heaven.

For sects of Christianity holding that belief and agreeing with Paul:
"If Christ has not risen, vain then is our preaching, vain too is your
faith" (I Cor 15,14), a clone from the bones in that (or any) ossuary
will be some guy from Roman Judaea named Jesus (Joshua), not Jesus
Christ, the Messiah, the only- begotten Son of God.

We may also see a return of one of the beliefs of some of the Gnostics
- that Jesus the Man was a vehicle for Jesus the God, and that the
physical clone, absent the action of the Logos in it, is not relevant
to Christian faith even if it is the same DNA as the Christ's body.
Like rebuilding Christ's Chevvy would not be theologically relevant.

You also pose a conundrum - the scriptural Jesus was not raised to be
a preacher or rabbi - he was a carpenter's kid from Nazareth. His
exercise of wisdom and miraculous powers was inherent, not inculcated.
If the Jesus clone is raised to be a military leader, and his inherent
nature does not prevail over the precepts of his guardians, it would
be another argument that they have a guy name Josh from the Roman
period.

Could he be programmed, as such, to be a good little parrot,
amplifying that he beings not peace but the sword, and riffing on
Revelations? Surely, if he has the right training and inherent talents
(presuming his greatest innate ability is not prolonged belching).
This might do for a PR campaign.

But you are going to have a significant number of Christians arguing
that if something is left to clone, it is prima facie evidence that it
ain't their guy,

Raising the Jesus clone to be a military leader would be a waste of
PR. Whether his leanings became militant or religious, Jesus clone
would have to be a political leader above all else. People under him
could dish out tactics and doctrine.

The interesting part would be to see if Jesus' DNA is different than
the DNA of other humans of the Jewish community in Israel of the first
century B.C. Even more fascinating is the possibility of a paternity
test. But even with a 99.9% surety that the DNA did belong to Jesus
Christ, believers would deny its authenticity unless the science
affirmed their faith.

Well, if there is a clone, why *would* jews convert?

The fact that there *is* a clone would prove that Jesus was *NOT* the
Messiah and most certainly *not* the son of God.

After all, if he was either, he ascended into heaven and left no
earthly remains behind as a result if he *was* the soG.

Ergo, clone = false messiah.

As a Unitarian Universalist, I can tell you that I don't have much
"touch" with these religious issues, but I'm getting more interested.
Here is the social sit-rep for the ATL which is based on a rough idea
of the real current OTL. Apparently, American Evangelicals are
becoming interested in dual citizenship. They are becoming interested
in fighting for Israel. These inspired men and women are in fact
hardcore pro-Israeli. These American Evangelicals can be a strong
source of soldiers, hardcore soldiers, for Israel. For now these
American Evangelicals are American Evangelicals, but their sons and
daugthers will speak Hebrew and may transition to a Hebrew
Christainity. These hardcore Christian Isaelis have routine contact
with the general Israeli population and influence them to be hardcore
too. The Jewish hardcore element in particular is impressed too.
Hebrew Christians over time increase as a percentage of the
population.
As to why they would except him?  People excepted and rejected him
before.
Why did a religion develop in the first place?

Why would Jews convert if there is a clone that is presented as Jesus
Christ? Well, that isn't how my ATL would be.  Before hand (and I
didn't make it clear, I can see) American Evangelicals have been
moving to Israel, seeking dual citizenship, and signing up to fight
for Israel, and prove themselves to generally be hardcore crackerjack.
This population grows and over time transform themselves into
Hebrewized Christians. This population influence like minded, like
sprited Jews to move towards Christainity.  Israel become more
important than convention religious forms. In short there is religious
ferment upon the Middle East.
Morale is down in Israel for now. Phil, Jesus in fact was an ordinary
man who gave rise to the world religion. He did die and leave earth
remains and a world religion did grow up.

The entire religion is false as are all religions when view from a
childish viewpoint. These people are not different than Mormons,
really. Mormonism is a real religion too and so can this new religion
that will develop.

John,

While at this point in the NG's existence, when there is a decline in
SHWI activity, it does pain me to cite the charter in order to shoot
down anyone's post, I do have to say that the TL you posit about
American fundie Christians moving to Israel with the result of
Israel being Christianized is future history and thus OT for SHWI.

However, if you want to set the POD sometime further in the past
so Enough Time Has Passed, or if you want to do a TL in
which "Israel" is an Arab Christian state rather than a "Jewish"
state, you are welcome to do so. I can't recall the latter ever
being done on SHWI - there have been WIs about Portugal or
Italy getting Palestine after WW1 and moving their excess population
of
impoverished peasants from poor southern regions and islands
to Palestine, and there have also been WIs in which the Arabs
win the Israeli War of Independence, but I can't recall a WI in
which there is an Arab Christian state in Palestine. Admittedly,
I have no idea about what the POD would be, and I have my
doubts about this being feasible. If anyone can supply a
credible POD for a Christian Palestinian state in the 20th
century (other than surviving Crusader states which I consider
ASB) they're welcome to pick up on this idea.

Yes. Well, this group is withering. Competition from AOL, Yahoo, and

I'm interested in American Evangelical support for Israel expanding in
the future as a chat topic, and this chat sits in history, and this
possible future is a product of history. And it is speculative. Maybe
posters here just have trouble coming up with interesting posts?

&gt; A partnership of Jews for Jesus types and American Evangelicals decide
&gt; to create a clone from DNA claimed to be the one an only, the famous
&gt; as can be Jesus Chirst.
&gt; Apparently, there is a real social possiblity that some sizable
&gt; segment of the Israeli Jewish population might convert to
&gt; Chiristianity. And some American Evangelicals are interested in
&gt; becoming Hebrew Christians, serving in the Israeli military, and it
&gt; all.
&gt; Ok. Now Jesus Christ the clone enters the scene. This clone is raised
&gt; to be a military leader...
">

Whatever gives you the idea that genes would dominate over life experience in
expressing the personality? How do you get someone who rails against the
theocracy without a theocracy?

Of if you like the military leader he was at most a subversive and that is it
bit hard to get expressed unless raised in some country like Ghana. And then
survival is quite the crap shoot.

ANY expected, desired or implied expression of personality is impossible given
the notoriety of the DNA. When the monks choose a child to be the new Lama or
whatever they are looking for an incarnation of the previous one.

And then all of the above is the myth versus the man -- if you think there
really was a Jesus used as the basis for the religion. First off recognize
Christianity is based upon the mythos of a Redeemer, a Christ, not upon the
teachings of Jesus. So right off the bat you don't have what you expect.

Then there is the man himself versus the public image. Pick any image, there
are several in the gospels alone, and what is the man behind the image? I sort
of like the image of the real Jesus giving the same few sermons standing on a
box when in fact he is short and fat and wisecracks his way through Galilee.
Think Zero Mostel.

Besides, how are you going going to convince him to wear a beard and long hair
but no dreadlocks so people recognize him?

Again, magic using technical terms. Even taking the bible version of a warrior
king you don't get there with a super-soldier even if not the X-Files variety.
No one is going to turn less than five million people from a country most
analogous to Prohibition era Chicago into a world ruler. The myth comes from
imagining themselves analogous to Macedonia and the Messiah as Alexander. This
coincides with the first appearance of the Messiah myth in the Septuagint. Top
of my head the genealogy of Alexander might have been the template for creating
the "bibleland" kings from the Egyptian king lists.

In any event today's soldier, even if super, buys it from an artillery shell,
not the warrior king who survived hand to hand combat. Therefore magic using
technical terms. Saying cloning in a laboratory sounds so much more credible
than a wizard waving a magic wand to create the story premise.

Except that it is a US myth that the Japanese ever considered the Emperor. That

There's no connection at all with a super-soldier motive - the location
(Holy Land), the circumstances (Virgin birth, military officals in search of
the "infant child, exectution at the hands of the government) and the myth
(speaking in tongues, healing the sick, apparent disappearing tricks)
mirrored the original story.  In fact in the book those dismissive of the
idea that this was the messiah used exactly that argument - the "messiah"
was just an experiment full of microchips, artificial implants, and
dangerous military motives - sorry to ruin the book ending but one of the
twists proves the opposite.  It's a good read whether you believe in Jesus
or not.

He would look like a Syrian man. I guess that. But who knows. I bet
the DNA in that box will be used ot make a clone at some point if it

&gt;    and fat and wisecracks his way through Galilee. Think Zero Mostel.
&gt;      Besides, how are you going going to convince him to wear a beard
&gt;    and long hair but no dreadlocks so people recognize him?

He would look like a Syrian man. I guess that. But who knows. I bet
the DNA in that box will be used ot make a clone at some point if it
is technically possible. And this person will be rasied and prsented
to the world at some point. And I do imagine that in the future Israel
will be home to more Christians who become Hebrew-Christians and
Syrian Christians too.

As I imagine this ATL concept, Jesus Chirst the clone is--raised--by
some Hebrew-Christian group. The group is aware of the sort of
response we see here, the know that Jesus doesn't ahve any spectacular
power to raise the dead, and that he will be similar to any other
religious leader. For them he might be similar to the Japanese emperor
was in history and nothing more.
