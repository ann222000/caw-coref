The corporation's website ( www.bshpcltd.com ) says&gt; that the project will be completed in five years.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sealed tenders are invited from registered, enlisted and reputed&gt; consultancy organizations, experienced in all aspects of hydroelectric&gt; development from concept to completion and fulfilling the stipulated&gt; eligibility criteria laid down in the bid document, for detailed survey and&gt; investigation and for preparation of bankable DPR for the 126 MW Dagmara&gt; Hydroelectric Project in Supaul district of Bihar in the Koshi River Basin,&quot;&gt; the BSHPC tender notice says.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Government officials here have not even been informed of India's decision to&gt; build the project.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We have received no information about this from the Indian side,&quot; said Anup&gt; Kumar Upadhyay, joint-secretary at the Ministry of Water Resources. &quot;They&gt; should have informed us. A country cannot build infrastructure that has the&gt; potential of adversely affecting its neighbor,&quot; he added.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An official at the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu, however, said the project&gt; will be built &quot;too far&quot; from the Nepal border, and there is no possibility&gt; of it submerging land in Nepal.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, the government's survey maps suggest otherwise.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The BSHPC notice says that project, which will have a barrage type diversion&gt; structure, will be located 22.5 kilometers from Koshi barrage. Topographical&gt; map of the Department of Survey shows that Saptari's Kunauli village, which&gt; is the southernmost part of Nepal's territory in the area, is located&gt; 14.5kilometers south of Koshi barrage. This means the Dagmara project&gt; will be&gt; located just eight kilometers south of Kunauli.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Umesh Nath Parajuli, Nepali team leader of Koshi High Dam Committee, said,&gt; &quot;Building a barrage just eight kilometers south of the border will surely&gt; affect Nepal. The effect can be more serious when such barrages are built on&gt; flatland, which is the case in Saptari and across the border.&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even the Department of Water Induced Disaster Prevention is unaware of India's&gt; decision to build the project. Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, director general of&gt; the Department, said, &quot;We will inquire into this.&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile, locals in Saptari, who have been facing the fury of the Koshi&gt; River for decades every monsoon, fear that the barrage that will be built&gt; for the Dagmara project could affect tens of thousands of families living in&gt; areas including Kunauli, Hanumannagar, and other border areas of Saptari&gt; district.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *&quot;An estimated fifty thousand families might be affected by rising level of&gt; water in the Koshi River**, due to the new barrage,&quot; said Deo Narayan Yadav,&gt; talking to the Post from Saptari. Yadav, who is an executive member of Koshi&gt; Victims' Society, resides in Rajbiraj, but owns ancestral land near the&gt; Indian border.*&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Interim Parliamentarian Ananda Pokharel of CPN-UML said that the&gt; issue would be raised in the next meeting of the interim parliament's&gt; Natural Resources and Means Committee.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; India has constructed or gone ahead with the construction of several bunds&gt; and barrages along or near the Nepal-India border in the past without prior&gt; information to the northern riparian state.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rasiyawal-Khurdalautal bund in Rupandehi, Laxmanpur barrage in Banke and the&gt; Barganiya bund in Rautahat are some of the prominent examples.&gt; &gt; *Source: The **Kathmandu** Post, **2 July 2007** www.ekantipur.com* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -- &gt; -------------------------------------------------------&gt; Campaign Co-ordinator&gt; Water &amp; Energy Users' Federation-Nepal (WAFED)&gt; GPO Box 2125&gt; 60 New Plaza Marga, Putalisadak, Kathmandu, Nepal&gt; Tel+977-1-4429741 Fax+977-1-4419610&gt; Mob+977-9841485815&gt; Email: rata ... @gmail.com; wa ... @ntc.net.np&gt; Website: wafed-nepal.org&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =========================================================================== ===&gt; TOPIC: Fwd: Vacancy Announcements&gt; http://groups.google.com.pk/group/drinking-water-pakistan/browse_thread/thr ead/e9a868643d32f61f?hl=en&gt; =========================================================================== ===&gt; &gt; == 1 of 1 ==&gt; Date: Mon, Jul 2 2007 12:08 pm &gt; From: &quot;M Jahangir&quot; &gt; &gt; &gt; For information to the group&gt; &gt; Rgds&gt; Moderator&gt; &gt; ---------- Forwarded message ----------&gt; From: WES-Net India Desk &lt;d ... @wesnetindia.org&gt;&gt; Date: Jul 2, 2007 11:58 AM&gt; Subject: Vacancy Announcements&gt; To: mjahangir ... @gmail.com&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Members,&gt; &gt; *Greetings from WES-Net India Secretariat.*&gt; **&gt; *Please note the following vacancy announcements:*&gt; &gt; *Position: Senior Consultant for SACOSAN III*&gt; &gt; *Organization: *UNICEF&gt; &gt; *Location:* New Delhi&gt; &gt; *Source:* Kumar Alok (ka ... @unicef.org)&gt; &gt; *Web URL: *http://tinyurl.com/24z8bv&gt; &gt; * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *&gt; &gt; *Position:* *Office Assistant for SACOSAN III*&gt; &gt; *Organization: *UNICEF&gt; &gt; *Location:* New Delhi&gt; &gt; *Source:* Kumar Alok, UNICEF&gt; &gt; *Web URL:* http://tinyurl.com/yv8brs&gt; &gt; * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *&gt; *To view more vacancies;*&gt; *visit * http://www.wesnetindia.org/index.php?id=15&gt; &gt; Regards,&gt; *Vinita Aggarwal*&gt; Web Administrator&gt; WES-Net India&gt; C/o Plan International (INDIA)&gt; E-12, Kailash Colony,&gt; New Delhi-110048&gt; INDIA&gt; *Phone:* +91-11-46558490 (Direct),&gt; +91-11-46558484 Extn: 490&gt; *Mobile: *+91-9810737609&gt; *Fax:* +91-11-46558443&gt; *Email:* vinita.aggar ... @wesnetindia.org,&gt; vinita.aggar ... @plan-international.org,&gt; vinita.aggar ... @gmail.com&gt; *Website:* www.wesnetindia.org,&gt; www.plan-international.org&gt; &gt; *WES-Net India is a network of agencies and professionals that aims to&gt; promote sustainable and equitable development of water and environmental&gt; sanitation initiatives through partnerships and knowledge sharing. *&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -- &gt; Know about yourself&gt; http://www.otherscore.com/&gt; &gt; for updates drinking water in Pakistan. http://waterpakistan.com/&gt; http://drinkingwater.wordpress.com/&gt; http://groups.google.com/group/drinking-water-pakistan&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =========================================================================== ===&gt; TOPIC: Comments on Public Private Partnership on Water&gt; http://groups.google.com.pk/group/drinking-water-pakistan/browse_thread/thr ead/b0919f2fbc109477?hl=en&gt; =========================================================================== ===&gt; &gt; == 1 of 2 ==&gt; Date: Mon, Jul 2 2007 1:34 pm &gt; From: &quot;Asim nawaz Khan&quot; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear All&gt; Government of Pakistan invited comments on PPP contract Draft.see www.ipdf.gov.pk&gt; Please contact me if you like to work on this issue.&gt; &gt; Regards&gt; Asim nawaz Khan&gt; chairman&gt; umeedenao&gt; asimp ... @hotmail.com &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; == 2 of 2 ==&gt; Date: Mon, Jul 2 2007 12:08 pm &gt; From: volunteer &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Mr Asim Nawaz Khan Sahib&gt; &gt; You are requested to that the project is explained further , so that&gt; members may see the area of their interest.&gt; Your sharing the information is appreciated&gt; Some how the link
