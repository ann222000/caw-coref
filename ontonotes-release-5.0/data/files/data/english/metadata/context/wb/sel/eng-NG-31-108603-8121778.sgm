there's the link folks.  I just took a look and couldn't believe it.
Now its confirmed-- Otis is so into himself that he has posted an old
old photo of his favorite person-- himself-- right on the home page.
do you think the guy is a little egotistical or what?  when was that
photo taken Otis, 1970?

you've got to have quite an ego to put your own picture up on a home
page to a forum thats supposed to be related to a medical issue.

i guess its like they say.  a picture is worth a thousand words.

I can't wait to delve deeper into the knowledge that is stored in that
website-- just as soon as I go into the bathroom and vomit.

Just an observation:  A shadow covers both his eyes.  Actually, you
can't tell whether he has real eyes or just two black holes.  I wonder
why.

and he says in the lastest posts, which are about me BTW, that I was
given the link to his website site.  true, but not be him-- by
Revival.  he is not man enough to speak directly to me or let me know
where he is posting his crap even though its derogatory name calling
stuff.  he's like a junior high school kid who passes notes to other
kids in class.  or like the guy who writes stuff on the bathroom walls
about people.

I'll make a deal with you Otis.
You leave SMV, and then I won't come to your Yahoo forum and start
posting the scientific proof that you are full of $hit.  How about it?
As much of a jerk as you are, I'll leave you be if you will just quit
posting in this newsgroup.  You can tell the innocents whatever you
want over there and I won't object and provide the scientific data
that disproves you IF you stay away from here.  I'll assume you agree
and accept but if you don't then be prepared to be made a monkey of in
your own little egocentric Yahoo forum.  Deal?

Yes.  Kind of a glassy &quot;where am I&quot; look to them.  I suspect the onset

Hello Neal.  long time!

I suggest Otis take Dr. P. Clarkii up on his suggestion.  It would be
easy to infiltrate his forum and contact everyone there vis-a-vis
Otis' psychotic tendencies and the ignored studies that totally squash
his claims.  Otis would end up looking like some of Dr. Young's
tortured moneys with the lens sutured on their eyes.  Or else the
forum could be turned over to the spammer's who took over Otis' forum
from a few years ago.

I wonder why everything Otis touches ends up in the shit can.
