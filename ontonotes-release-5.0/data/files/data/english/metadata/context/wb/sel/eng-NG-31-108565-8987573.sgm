NASA: ANTARCTICA SNOWMELT MOVING INLAND

BALTIMORE, Sept. 24 (UPI) -- NASA scientists studying 20 years of data
from space-based sensors found Antarctic snow is increasingly melting
farther inland and at higher altitudes.

The discovery is significant, scientists said, since Antarctica
contains 90 percent of Earth's fresh water, making it the largest
potential source of sea level rise. It is also a place where snow
melting is limited because, even in summer, most areas typically
record temperatures well below zero.

National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientists using data
collected from 1987 to 2006 found snow is now melting as far inland as
500 miles from the Antarctic coast and as high as 1.2 miles above sea
level in the Transantarctic Mountains.

The data also confirm melting has increased on the Ross Ice Shelf,
both in geographic area and in duration.

&quot;Snow melting is very connected to surface temperature change, so it's
likely warmer temperatures are at the root of what we've observed in
Antarctica,&quot; said lead author Marco Tedesco, a research scientist at
the Joint Center for Earth Systems Technology cooperatively managed by
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland.

The study appears in the current issue of Geophysical Research
Letters.

This news falls into the category of &quot;Holy shit, Batman!&quot;

Doesn't it?  If Antarctica actually is melting more quickly, rather
than adding snow and ice as the GW Denialists like to claim?

Or is it doing both?

Here's an excerpt from another account of the same study, which the
page you cited links to:

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070920122154.htm

EXCERPT:

In a new NASA study, researchers using 20 years of data from space-
based sensors have confirmed that Antarctic snow is melting farther
inland from the coast over time, melting at higher altitudes than ever
and increasingly melting on Antarctica's largest ice shelf.

With a surface size about 1.5 times the size of the United States,
Antarctica contains 90 percent of Earth's fresh water, making it the
largest potential source of sea level rise. It is also a place where
snow melting is quite limited because even in summer, most areas
typically record temperatures well below zero.

Nevertheless, NASA researchers using data collected from 1987 to 2006
found snow melting in unlikely places in 2005: as far inland as 500
miles away from the Antarctic coast and as high as 1.2 miles above sea
level in the Transantarctic Mountains.

The 20-year data record was three times longer than previous studies
and reaffirmed the extreme melting irregularity observed in 2005.
During the same period, they also found that melting had increased on
the Ross Ice Shelf, both in terms of the geographic area affected and
the duration of increased melting across affected areas.

&quot;Snow melting is very connected to surface temperature change, so it's
likely warmer temperatures are at the root of what we've observed in
Antarctica,&quot; said lead author Marco Tedesco, a research scientist at
the Joint Center for Earth Systems Technology cooperatively managed by
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., and the University
of Maryland at Baltimore County, Baltimore.

The study will be published on Sept. 22 in the American Geophysical
Union's Geophysical Research Letters.

The ice melt
[Quote]
&quot;is equivalent to 0.4 millimeters of global sea rise annually, with a
margin of error of 0.2 millimeters, according to the study. There are
about 25 millimeters in an inch.&quot;
[Unquote]

That means at 0.5 millimeters per year, in 100 years,
sea level could rise by as much as......   2  INCHES!!
.......... because of ice melting in Antarctica.

The articles at that site might carry a notice that says
they are &quot;adapted from a news release&quot;.......

There seems to be a typo in the article the quote above is
from, so I had to make an assumption what they meant.

Problem for you and everyone who tries to maintain the Climate-discussion IS
that this has happened over and over during this World's 'life' and last
time wasn't 1000 years ago. The 'facts' you tries to maintain are political
factors without correlation to and contact with the real situation in the
past. Of course it's melting that we have known since 1930's that it should
do. Problem for you is that it's not melting as fast as it then was
presumed. Not even the 'normal'-estimation made in late 1970's has been
reached. Far from it. If it had many towns on Northern Hemisphere, such as
my own Gothenburg, would have had 7-8 meter higher waterlevels by 1995 and
the situation in the Southern Hemisphere hadn't been much better.....

Would have been better had some of you learnt that the problem isn't the
climate but the water-poisoned due to too many chemical products been
produced and used in ways that really are a big problem for all life on
Earth and within a short period of time.

A friend of mine once told me that where he had lived on the coast of
these United States he himself had witnessed the loss of coastline to the
sea during the time he lived there. But, while he lived in Colombia his
father-in-law told him about all the coastline Colombia had gained where he
lived just in his own lifetime. One plate edge going under, losing land to
the sea, while another plate edge is rising up over, gaining land from the
sea.

All the central plain of Australia used to be a shallow inland sea
somewhat on the order of the Mediterranean Sea. Wherever you walk in that
'outback' you will find fossils of the many sea creatures that used to live
in great abundance in that now non-existent sea.

Antarctica has its abundance of flora and fauna fossils as well,
bespeaking a time in which Antarctica had much warmer summers than now when
its flora and fauna would flourish for monthes in continuous sunlight and
warmth before the monthes long night and cold would reset in. I wonder if
they've tracked just how long that night is now compared to even just a
hundred years ago? Whether the pole to pole 'wobble' of the Earth has
changed somewhat in the last couple of hundred years?

I've read that the Moon is farthest out in orbital distance from the Earth
it has been since scientists have tracked such things. Whether anyone
remembers it or not, a change in the Moon's distance from the Earth will
always change the shape of the Earth somewhat, including changing the shape
and direction of Earth's tidal forces somewhat, particularly the seas'.

Then there is Sol and its seasonal eras of greater or lesser activity. And
there is the solar system and where it has drifted to above the surface line
of the disk of the Milky Way galaxy. It is not fixed in the disk of the
galaxy. It drifts perpendicularly up and down somewhat through and away
from -- or toward -- the surface line of the disk, periodically leaving or
arriving into the greater protection of the disk. Yes, the &quot;greater
protection&quot; of the disk.

Lastly, enviromentalists had better get set for Apocalypse and Armageddon
in any case whatsoever, except for one case and one case alone. If life can
break out into the universe, environmentalists can have their vastly
increased tyranny regarding mankind on Earth. If the fascist / communistic
&quot;iron curtain&quot; remains up between mankind and that breakout into the
universe, environmentalists' worst case scenario of mass extinctions becomes
a self-fulfilling prophecy no matter what. Talk about a &quot;weapon of mass
destruction,&quot; a humanity imprisoned to Concentration Camp Earth, in Paradise
Ghettoes, to serve the Big Brother (or Big Sister) STATE of &quot;all mankind&quot;
automatically becomes the doomsday weapon of all doomsday weapons waiting
only the most feather touch trigger -- the smallest, least seemingly
significant, spark of them all -- for detonation. The last most feathery,
least weighted, least straw of all straws added to the [completely
unrealized] pile on the camel's back shattering its spine ALL TO HELL AND
GONE.

A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Antarctica has fossils
because it hasn't been at the Sth Pole that long. At one time, some
160- to 180-million years ago it was part of Gondwanaland and lay in
the tropics..

Of course, you may think the world is only about 8,000 years old, in
which case scientific terms have no place in your vocabulary.

&gt;   All the central plain of Australia used to be a shallow inland sea
&gt; somewhat on the order of the Mediterranean Sea. Wherever you walk in that
&gt; 'outback' you will find fossils of the many sea creatures that used to live
&gt; in great abundance in that now non-existent sea.

&gt;   Antarctica has its abundance of flora and fauna fossils as well,
&gt; bespeaking a time in which Antarctica had much warmer summers than now when
&gt; its flora and fauna would flourish for monthes in continuous sunlight and
&gt; warmth before the monthes long night and cold would reset in. I wonder if
&gt; they've tracked just how long that night is now compared to even just a
&gt; hundred years ago? Whether the pole to pole 'wobble' of the Earth has
&gt; changed somewhat in the last couple of hundred years?

&gt;   I've read that the Moon is farthest out in orbital distance from the Earth
&gt; it has been since scientists have tracked such things. Whether anyone
&gt; remembers it or not, a change in the Moon's distance from the Earth will
&gt; always change the shape of the Earth somewhat, including changing the shape
&gt; and direction of Earth's tidal forces somewhat, particularly the seas'.

&gt;   Then there is Sol and its seasonal eras of greater or lesser activity. And
&gt; there is the solar system and where it has drifted to above the surface line
&gt; of the disk of the Milky Way galaxy. It is not fixed in the disk of the
&gt; galaxy. It drifts perpendicularly up and down somewhat through and away
&gt; from -- or toward -- the surface line of the disk, periodically leaving or
&gt; arriving into the greater protection of the disk. Yes, the &quot;greater
&gt; protection&quot; of the disk.

&gt;   Lastly, enviromentalists had better get set for Apocalypse and Armageddon
&gt; in any case whatsoever, except for one case and one case alone. If life can
&gt; break out into the universe, environmentalists can have their vastly
&gt; increased tyranny regarding mankind on Earth. If the fascist / communistic
&gt; &quot;iron curtain&quot; remains up between mankind and that breakout into the
&gt; universe, environmentalists' worst case scenario of mass extinctions becomes
&gt; a self-fulfilling prophecy no matter what. Talk about a &quot;weapon of mass
&gt; destruction,&quot; a humanity imprisoned to Concentration Camp Earth, in Paradise
&gt; Ghettoes, to serve the Big Brother (or Big Sister) STATE of &quot;all mankind&quot;
&gt; automatically becomes the doomsday weapon of all doomsday weapons waiting
&gt; only the most feather touch trigger -- the smallest, least seemingly
&gt; significant, spark of them all -- for detonation. The last most feathery,
&gt; least weighted, least straw of all straws added to the [completely
&gt; unrealized] pile on the camel's back shattering its spine ALL TO HELL AND
&gt; GONE.

GLB - what in the hell are you talking about?

You're saying that if the governments of the world, and most of the
private corporations and the people, decide we need to replace carbon
fuels with some other energy source to keep from cooking ourselves,
that means &quot;Concentration Camp Earth&quot;?

Why, dude?

When the English started to use coal in the place of charcoal in the
smelting of iron, it didn't automatically mean &quot;concentration camp
earth&quot; - it did mean more Co2 emissions fostering global warming, and
a hell of a lot of air pollution, but the switch from one energy
source to another was not a recipe for mass tyranny.

Similarly when petroleum started to replace coal as a fuel in naval
vessels, and when first kerosene and then electricity replaced whale
oil as a fuel for lighting purposes.

New corporations and new industries were formed; some people gained
from this economically while others lost, but getting rid of one
source of lighting fuel and adopting others did not produce global
tyranny.

So you're saying if the world has to get rid of fossil fuels now and
move to (a) alternative sources like wind, solar power, biofuels, and
maybe nuclear, and (b) to less ridiculously energy-wasting
technologies (for example - no more SUVS) - this is going to produce
&quot;Concentration Camp Earth&quot;?

You're smoking the wrong kind of weed, guy.  You're tying the future
of human liberty to the perpetual use of dead dinosaur bones as an
energy source.   This is not logical thinking.

Within the last two million years Man has increased its numbers more than
a million fold on Earth. That's piddling. Shrinking the world, relatively
speaking, isn't based upon that. It's based on the fact that humans have
increased their energies, powers, complexity, and reach, two-million fold --
average per every man, woman and child living -- over the same past
two-million years. Of that two-million fold increase over the past two
million years, an increase of one million fold occurring over just the last
seventy years. Without a space frontier to expand into to grow into out from
the Earth (iron curtained off by a radically stupid ideology of Utopia on
Earth being possible now, first before expansion into outer spatial
frontiers) that means the physic of implosiveness -- implosive
de-cohesion -- now being the growing complication on Earth.

When such is turned inwardly to the existing world and upon the world
things automatically get ugly. Ugly to the extreme of ever increasing
numbers and virulence of uglinesses. Not increasing stability but increasing
numbers and virulence of instabilities. Not previous voids now being filled
but increasing numbers of [ever enlarging] voids now coming into being that
can't possibly be filled in a world now isolated from the frontier universe
(where it wasn't isolated from FRONTIER at any time before). An alternative
title for them would be &quot;singularities&quot; coming into being. In a boxed world
each individual thing is as implacably boxed as the world as a whole. And

Well, this is a nice optimistic view of the future - and I thought
that I was gloomy.

Where I think you're going with this, however, is toward &quot;the new
frontier&quot; -- space travel -- as the magic solution for the ills of
Earth.  And - well, it might be a solution for some tiny percentage of
the human species that manages to escape to Mars or whevever  --
Assuming that the place in question can be &quot;terraformed&quot; to support
human life in some kind of comfort

It MIGHT be a solution for those few, the pioneers who go off to
invade &amp; conquer Mars, pretty much the way that the Spanish
Conquistadoes in the 1500s conquered the Americas.

But for the vast majority of stay at home - we're still stuck in
&quot;PRISON EARTH&quot; or whatever you call it - no?

So it seems to me - we better find a way to make &quot;PRISON EARTH&quot; into
not such a prison, into &quot;DECENT SOCIETY, EARTH&quot;  -- or we're screwed.
Maybe you and some tiny hyper-scientific elite will fly off into
heaven -- excuse me, outer space -- to be pioneer astronauts, and
you'll have a fine time up there unless you encounter Space Natives -
entities who already live there, and fight you for control of the
place.

But for us, the 95% to 99% of us who are &quot;Left Behind&quot; on Terra, it's
still going to be a hell hole unless we get busy right now to make it
into something else.  So - I'm sorry, but your posts to me seem to be
pretty pointless so far, if we're talking about creating a good future
for our descendants on the Home Planet.

Am I just misunderstanding you, and you're not simply doing PR
promotions for the Great Space Flight Lobby -- the ultimate escapist
vacation paradise?

It 's now a headlong flight towards keeping the wheel rolling i.e. the
high return on investments, the quick buck on Stock Exchanges betting

Who mentioned Mars? I've said many times that the surface of Mars is far
too small, and far too late in time for that matter, to do our future any
good. Space colonization, which is colonization of mass rather than the so
little of existing surfaces, or creation of surface and environments in
in-space colony bases, stations, other general and special functional and
industrial facilities, ships, boats, work pods, space suits, materials and
goods, you name it, is now the only way we can go in dealing in much greater
masses of life over much less time.

But the big picture in-space colonization can and will deal in is
continuing expansion and growth of energy, powers, complexity and reach. As
with detached and decentralized micro-computers, and local and wide area
networking of them, taking precedence over bemoth monolithic mainframe
systems, going to micro-worlds and getting far more quanta dynamic in the
universe in order to go bigger, faster, into the universe is the only way to
go. And the spread into a more spatially spread out system is infinitely
better for life's general &quot;survival&quot; than life crowding within just a few
naturally tyrannical monolithic worlds. In in-space colonization -- an
in-space complexes and local and wide area networks -- life begins to deal
in potential hyper-dimensionality, including titanic numbers and varieties
of ships plying huge numbers of space lanes, and a growing need to shrink
times between the then orbiting colonies over Venus (who will probably own
Mercury as well) and the increasing outside reach of in-space based life
toward the Kuiper and Oort Clouds.

But of course that span is not the fastest way to interstellar space. The
fastest way to interstellar space is simply to turn perpendicular in space
to the interplanetary. To turn and go vertical to the horizontal. And that
alone may turn out to be the simplest most natural way to get hyper-spatial
to some degree.

In-space structure for the life inside it will have shielding and
exo-skeletal being like nothing on Earth has ever had before. It will be
naturally so hi-tech, and so naturally mobile, throughout a model
micro-galactic infrastructure (micro modeling a macro-galactic
infrastructure) it will make us, here and now on Earth, look pure Stone Age,
besides virtually immobile.

It won't be paradise, it will be life. There will still be the sheep, the
cattle, and the wolves. There will still be ignorance, stupidity,
complications, confusions, error, and &quot;useful idiots.&quot; There will still be
tyrannies and tyrants galore, and thus pestilences, wars, famines, and
untimely deaths galore (in many more than just one sense of all of these).
There will be the Wild...and the weeds of the Wild. It will be life being
life IN FULL, but mitigated by spreading out and being spread out. Diluting,
with so many intervening horizons of more space and more time,
confrontations of differing states (diluting overall -- watering down
overall -- &quot;pestilences, wars, famines, and untimely deaths&quot;).

Change will have a vast frontier's utterly split personality, so damn
fast, and yet so damn slow. The revered 'old' will have room for it. And the
brand spanking 'new' will have just as much room for it.

----------------

Toward one future, Earth alone, I'm the most pessimistic man alive. Toward
another future, Space Frontier and thus a renewal of Earth as also a brand
new frontier within that larger frontier context, I'm the most optimistic
man alive. Nothing unites like a vast frontier. Nothing divides like a
shrinking world, boxed in. Nothing enlarges the mind, particularly the mass
mind (&quot;national genius&quot;), like the presence [in hand] of a vast frontier.
Nothing shrinks the mind, particularly the mass mind, like a shrinking
world, boxed in. The former is the far less unstable and volatile. The
latter is the far more unstable and volatile.

I'm sure they take this into account, but how do they narrow the
margin
of error to that level of accuracy?

If there is a severe weather pattern occuring (say a hurrican,
monsoon,
tsunami, tidel waves, etc), then the altitude may not be easy to
determine
as the very second an image was taken, it may be in the peak of a
wave or a valley of the wave?

Have these types of factors been included in these types of
calculations?

Have the accuracy of the satellites also been factored in?  The
resolution of older satellites may not be as good as newer one.

I'm trying to remember where I saw it, but I recall there being a
report regarding
sea temperatures over time, with data points based on sea temperature
(or maybe depth) measurements pulled from Sea Captain's records over
several
hundred years.  I believe it involved the records from English Navy,
but not 100% sure.

Does anyone know about this and a pointer to this data?

However, there is probably a lesser degree of accuracy given each
captain had
different expierence and tools for making these measures, and over
time.

&gt;   Who mentioned Mars? I've said many times that the surface of Mars is far
&gt; too small, and far too late in time for that matter, to do our future any
&gt; good. Space colonization, which is colonization of mass rather than the so
&gt; little of existing surfaces, or creation of surface and environments in
&gt; in-space colony bases, stations, other general and special functional and
&gt; industrial facilities, ships, boats, work pods, space suits, materials and
&gt; goods, you name it, is now the only way we can go in dealing in much greater
&gt; masses of life over much less time.

&gt;   But the big picture in-space colonization can and will deal in is
&gt; continuing expansion and growth of energy, powers, complexity and reach. As
&gt; with detached and decentralized micro-computers, and local and wide area
&gt; networking of them, taking precedence over bemoth monolithic mainframe
&gt; systems, going to micro-worlds and getting far more quanta dynamic in the
&gt; universe in order to go bigger, faster, into the universe is the only way to
&gt; go. And the spread into a more spatially spread out system is infinitely
&gt; better for life's general &quot;survival&quot; than life crowding within just a few
&gt; naturally tyrannical monolithic worlds. In in-space colonization -- an
&gt; in-space complexes and local and wide area networks -- life begins to deal
&gt; in potential hyper-dimensionality, including titanic numbers and varieties
&gt; of ships plying huge numbers of space lanes, and a growing need to shrink
&gt; times between the then orbiting colonies over Venus (who will probably own
&gt; Mercury as well) and the increasing outside reach of in-space based life
&gt; toward the Kuiper and Oort Clouds.

&gt;   But of course that span is not the fastest way to interstellar space. The
&gt; fastest way to interstellar space is simply to turn perpendicular in space
&gt; to the interplanetary. To turn and go vertical to the horizontal. And that
&gt; alone may turn out to be the simplest most natural way to get hyper-spatial
&gt; to some degree.

&gt;   In-space structure for the life inside it will have shielding and
&gt; exo-skeletal being like nothing on Earth has ever had before. It will be
&gt; naturally so hi-tech, and so naturally mobile, throughout a model
&gt; micro-galactic infrastructure (micro modeling a macro-galactic
&gt; infrastructure) it will make us, here and now on Earth, look pure Stone Age,
&gt; besides virtually immobile.

&gt;   It won't be paradise, it will be life. There will still be the sheep, the
&gt; cattle, and the wolves. There will still be ignorance, stupidity,
&gt; complications, confusions, error, and &quot;useful idiots.&quot; There will still be
&gt; tyrannies and tyrants galore, and thus pestilences, wars, famines, and
&gt; untimely deaths galore (in many more than just one sense of all of these).
&gt; There will be the Wild...and the weeds of the Wild. It will be life being
&gt; life IN FULL, but mitigated by spreading out and being spread out. Diluting,
&gt; with so many intervening horizons of more space and more time,
&gt; confrontations of differing states (diluting overall -- watering down
&gt; overall -- &quot;pestilences, wars, famines, and untimely deaths&quot;).

&gt;   Change will have a vast frontier's utterly split personality, so damn
&gt; fast, and yet so damn slow. The revered 'old' will have room for it. And the
&gt; brand spanking 'new' will have just as much room for it.

&gt; ----------------

&gt;   Toward one future, Earth alone, I'm the most pessimistic man alive. Toward
&gt; another future, Space Frontier and thus a renewal of Earth as also a brand
&gt; new frontier within that larger frontier context, I'm the most optimistic
&gt; man alive. Nothing unites like a vast frontier. Nothing divides like a
&gt; shrinking world, boxed in. Nothing enlarges the mind, particularly the mass
&gt; mind (&quot;national genius&quot;), like the presence [in hand] of a vast frontier.
&gt; Nothing shrinks the mind, particularly the mass mind, like a shrinking
&gt; world, boxed in. The former is the far less unstable and volatile. The
&gt; latter is the far more unstable and volatile.

Climate change disaster is upon us, warns UN
· Emergency relief chief calls for swift action
· 12 out of 13 'flash' appeals in 2007 related to weather
· In pictures: floods, droughts and storms across the world
· World in crisis map, 2007

Julian Borger, diplomatic editor
The Guardian
Friday October 5 2007

A record number of floods, droughts and storms around the world this
year amount to a climate change &quot;mega disaster&quot;, the United Nation's
emergency relief coordinator, Sir John Holmes, has warned.

Sir John, a British diplomat who is also known as the UN's under-
secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said dire predictions
about the impact of global warming on humanity were already coming
true.

&quot;We are seeing the effects of climate change. Any year can be a freak
but the pattern looks pretty clear to be honest. That's why we're
trying ... to say, of course you've got to deal with mitigation of
emissions, but this is here and now, this is with us already,&quot; he
said.

As a measure of the worsening situation, Ocha, the UN Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs - part of the UN secretariat that
employs Sir John - has issued 13 emergency &quot;flash&quot; appeals so far this
year. The number is three more than in 2005, which held the previous
record.

Two years ago only half the international disasters dealt with by Ocha
had anything to do with the climate; this year all but one of the 13
emergency appeals is climate-related.

&quot;And 2007 is not finished. We will certainly have more by the end of
the year, I fear,&quot; added Sir John, who is in charge of channelling
international relief efforts to disaster areas.

More appeals were likely in the coming weeks, as floods hit west
Africa. &quot;All these events on their own didn't have massive death
tolls, but if you add all these little disasters together you get a
mega disaster,&quot; he said.

The only one of this year's emergency appeals not connected to the
climate was an earthquake in Peru, in August.

The others arose after an unprecedented string of catastrophic floods
across much of Africa, south Asia and North Korea, and followed severe
drought in southern Africa, Nicaragua's category-five hurricane, and
extreme climate conditions in Bolivia, which brought both drought and
floods.

SNIP

Ocha believes that 66 million people were made homeless or were
otherwise affected across south Asia. The lives of several million
more people were turned upside down across Africa. Sudan, Mozambique,
Madagascar, Zambia and Uganda experienced disastrous floods, and
Swaziland and Lesotho declared emergencies because of severe drought
that reduced harvests by half.

SNIP

&quot;The flooding in Africa just now is the worst anyone can remember,&quot;
Sir John said, expressing frustration at how little media attention in
the west was being devoted to what he terms creeping climatic
catastrophe.

Flooding is likely to be common for a warming planet, and climate
change has a double effect - causing an increase in the frequency of
storms, while higher atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide curb the
ability of plants to draw groundwater.

A climate-change summit is to be held in Bali in December, with the
aim of agreeing the principles of a new
international treaty to replace Kyoto, the accord that expires in
2012. But the talks face determined US opposition to mandatory
emissions targets, and most climate negotiators doubt a real
breakthrough can be achieved before the Bush government leaves office
in 2009.

Sir John argues that whatever is done on greenhouse gas emissions,
money has to be spent now on mitigating the impact that climate change
is already having. &quot;You can't actually stop disasters happening but
you can do a lot to reduce their impact and reduce people's
vulnerability to them by making sure people don't live on the coast or
river plains, and that roads are raised and dams are in reasonable
shape.&quot;

&gt; NASA: ANTARCTICA SNOWMELT MOVING INLAND

&gt; BALTIMORE, Sept. 24 (UPI) -- NASA scientists studying 20 years of data
&gt; from space-based sensors found Antarctic snow is increasingly melting
&gt; farther inland and at higher altitudes.

&gt; The discovery is significant, scientists said, since Antarctica
&gt; contains 90 percent of Earth's fresh water, making it the largest
&gt; potential source of sea level rise. It is also a place where snow
&gt; melting is limited because, even in summer, most areas typically
&gt; record temperatures well below zero.

&gt; National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientists using data
&gt; collected from 1987 to 2006 found snow is now melting as far inland as
&gt; 500 miles from the Antarctic coast and as high as 1.2 miles above sea
&gt; level in the Transantarctic Mountains.

&gt; The data also confirm melting has increased on the Ross Ice Shelf,
&gt; both in geographic area and in duration.

&gt; &quot;Snow melting is very connected to surface temperature change, so it's
&gt; likely warmer temperatures are at the root of what we've observed in
&gt; Antarctica,&quot; said lead author Marco Tedesco, a research scientist at
&gt; the Joint Center for Earth Systems Technology cooperatively managed by
&gt; NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland.

&gt; The study appears in the current issue of Geophysical Research
&gt; Letters.

Rich nations seeking to cut climate change have this in common: they
lie. You won't find this statement in the draft of the new report by
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was leaked to the
Guardian last week. But as soon as you understand the numbers, the
