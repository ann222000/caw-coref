I have been thinking about selling on ebay . A friend who has been doing
this for years has recommended that I get a second ebay &quot;identity&quot; in case I
need to act as a shill for myself. Her theory is high reserves turn off
bidders. With a second identity she can raise bids on her stuff yet her
items can be described as without minimum bid or reserve.
I think there is something unethical about this and maybe even illegal.
Your thoughts?

"/> IMHO, it is unethical and against eBay's policy. If it is discovered you (and
she) are doing this you will be banned from eBay and your name/eBay ID could be
bandied about the newsgroups and chat rooms.

Conducting business like that is one of the reasons doing Internet auction
business gets a bad name.

I think too much of my Internet identity and reputation to risk doing something
like that for a few bucks -- whether we are talking dollars or hundreds of
dollars.

Tracy? If this is indeed a real question, I'm sure Mom &amp; Dad have already
given you the answer. If not, permit me to point you to two useful
definitions:

ethics n 1: motivation based on ideas of right and wrong [syn: ethical
motive, morals, morality] 2: the philosophical study of moral values and
rules [syn: moral philosophy]
----------
Ethics \Eth&quot;ics\, n. [Cf. F. ['e]thique. See Ethic.] The science of human
duty; the body of rules of duty drawn from this science; a particular system
of principles and rules concerting duty, whether true or false; rules of
practice in respect to a single class of human actions; as, political or
social ethics; medical ethics.

The completeness and consistency of its morality is the peculiar praise of
the ethics which the Bible has taught. --I. Taylor.

&gt; Tracy? If this is indeed a real question, I'm sure Mom &amp; Dad have already
&gt; given you the answer.

"/> Egads! No not me, but what a coincidence!

Actually my question was regarding feedback on a completed sale. The
buyer bought a big ticket item and had to postpone immediate payment. He
did pay when promised, only slightly late and well within a reasonable
period of time, and bent over backward to stay in touch. Well, a couple
other sellers weren't as &quot;understanding&quot; and got him suspended. He asked
if I would write to eBay on his behalf. Frankly, I was shaking in my
boots because he had a couple negative feedbacks before he won my
auction and I thought I was being taken for a ride. I wasn't. He was
honestly in a pinch and he lived up to his word.

I did the right thing.

Now, regarding Raoul's moral dilemma:

Raoul, be careful who you call a friend. What this person has suggested
is at least unethical and I believe is against eBay's policy. It
infuriates me that someone may be doing this to &quot;get more money out of
me&quot; on items I need for my collection or my research. People like your
friend give all auctions, online or otherwise, a bad name. And s/he's
wrong that high reserves turn off bidders - high minimums do. If your
item is listed properly, well described and in the proper category, you
are almost guaranteed to get a decent price for it. But if you get
greedy you'll get nothing - usually.

"/> Your friend is someone I certainly would not want to have dealings with,
she is morally wrong and this is strictly against ebay policy. Ebay used
to advise sellers that they could place one bid on their own auction.
The purpose of this was if the item was obviously not going to sell for
what you expected, you could bid a high price and win the auction
yourself. Ebay asked that that policy not be abused, but it was, many
times by sellers doing just what your friend suggests. I think that they
have change the rules and the system now prevents you from bidding on
your own auction. I know that was discussed at one time and that is the
way it should be.

"/> Don't do it. People conduct business on the eBay the same way that they
would if they had a storefront. Some are ethical, some don't give a rip.
What kind of business reputation do you want to have?

A good name is worth much, and will bring you more than the few dollars you
might lose by pricing something too low. Not only that, but it isn't that
hard for regular bidders to find out if you are using a shill...if there's
any suspicion they will watch you and nail you. Then you'll be out of
business altogether.

You were right to feel uneasy about your friend's advice.

"/> Phew! Please don't ever scare us like that again, Mike!

Speaking of bids off the wall, I attended a 'live' auction this week. I bid
$5 on a jewelry lot and the auctioneer immediately jumped it to $17.50 and
came back to me for $20, which I, of course, declined.
I later told the buyer that she should only pay $7.50. She had thought it
was odd, but had people talking behind her so wasn't sure that she hadn't
missed something.

Shortly after that, I was bidding on something else. My bid was $15 and the
auctioneer was looking for $17.50. He didn't get it and said, &quot;Sold,
$17.50&quot;. I didn't let him get away with that one. I don't think it was
intentional, as this is an auction I attend regularly, and generally,
believe them to be an honest company, based on other experiences there.

It does go to show, though, that you've gotta pay attention, even when it's
only nickels and dimes.

"/> At some of our local auctions you can leave a bid with the auctioneer
and call back later to see if your bid got it, to some attending the
auction this can look like the auctioneer is taking bids from the great
beyond. The real problem is you never know for sure. Man, I love this
business!

"/> Hi Jan! I guess you mean &quot;live&quot; auction as opposed to &quot;dead&quot; one. I've
been to a few of those. :-) But seriously, awhile back I went to a
po-dunk, rinky-dink, get outta town auction. It was so amateur I felt like
I was in a time warp. Well, anyhow, the auctioneer was doing his thing and
periodically taking a swig from a water bottle (you know, those fancy ones
Marshall makes fun of). After awhile his speech started to slur and he
started telling dirty jokes. One of his helpers took the water bottle, took a
whiff of it and said....&quot;this is vodka!&quot; Et Wot!
So after a little while a little shaving mirror came up. I bid against
another gentleman and did win the bid. But when it came time to record my bid
number he named the number of the other fellow! The other guy looked surprised
but didn't say anything. This annoyed me, but rather than make a public scene
I went almost immediately to the recording secretary (trust me....it was that
rinky-dink) and I said...there has been a mistake...I was the high bidder.
So she tries to get the attention of the auctioneer but he is so sloshed he
cannot focus. And the other bidder pretends like he really was the high bidder
(that is what they said, after all.) Anyway.....I left that auction in a
major huff and NEVER went back.
Don't ya love this business?

"/> Any time you pose a &quot;moral&quot; or &quot;ethical&quot; question to a group of people,
the reaction is predictable: shock, gasping, vigorous headshaking, NO-
SIR-I'd-never-do-that-no-way-no-HOW! The problem with a bristling
display of moral outrage is that critical thinking sometimes falls by
the wayside. And so it is that the best reason not to use a shill is
simply this: it doesn't work.

Now, understand that I am talking about online auctions, not the live
variety.

Consider the shilling process. Let's say you've set up an alter ego and
your no-reserve low-starting-bid auction is being a bit sluggish. You'd
sure *like* to get $100 for that reticulated widget but your high bidder
is resting comfortably at $5.00. What to do, what to do. You *don't
know* your high bidder's maximum bid. You *don't know* if anyone else
will ever bid on this mint-except-for-a-few-chips beauty. So, what bid
does the shill make? $6, $10, $20, $90? Kee-rist, you think, I paid
$50 for it. A too-low bid does you no good and with a too-high bid you
run a tremendous risk of still having this item (your wife calls it an
eyesore) after the auction ends. You pay both the listing fee and the
commission, plus you get to sit on the item for *months* until you can
list it again. EBay buyers have long memories.

Sure, there are some probabilities you can play. Most people bid in
even dollar amounts (despite abundant evidence to the contrary that this
is a bad idea...but that's another topic). Many people bid in the last
two minutes of an auction. Good to know, but not enough to make you a
successful shiller.

I'm not denying that shilling happens on online auctions like eBay, but
it is generally being done by really stupid people. Buyers can protect
themselves from these RSP by:

1) bidding a low maximum bid, then raising it by small increments.
2) bidding in odd amounts (this drives them nuts!)
3) keeping an eye on the seller's auction list and noting any bidders
who seem to win a lot of that seller's auctions. (Yes, there are people
who are dumb enough to use only one shill...they're the dregs of the
barrel...the bottom 5%.)

&quot;Hope this helps.&quot;

I watched last minute fight earlier today for a Vintage Breitling. Shame
that it got to $1500 and *still* didn't get past the reserve. The seller
has the watch listed on his website for $1700, so maybe he was looking
for at least that...but it was interesting that it got that far...jumped
$300 in the last 5 minutes.

If you notice a suspicious pattern and do nothing you are like
the people in my neighborhood who hear gunshots and don't call
the cops. Not directly responsible, but certainly not helping
clean up the neighborhood.

Lets look at this for face value.....

Your pal wants you to lie to the public about items that you want to sell on
the internet. You are willing to lie?

Why would you want to do that? Do you lie to people you come in contact
face-to-face? Do you feel comfortable with that?

I thought not. Be the best person you can be and a role model for those that
come after you. If you have to lie to get your &quot;perceived value&quot; for something
then maybe your &quot;perceived value&quot; is way off mark.. The market will bear what
it will bear.....

Someone just told me that this isn't a dress rehearsal....

I'd better get busy!!!!!!
