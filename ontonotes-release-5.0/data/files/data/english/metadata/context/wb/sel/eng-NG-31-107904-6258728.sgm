What can we do?  At the very least we need to ban the production of any
non -commercial vehicle that weighs over 3000  pounds. Most SUVs weigh
5000+.

World faces hottest year ever, as El Niño combines with global
warming
By Cahal Milmo
Published: 01 January 2007

A combination of global warming and the El Niño weather system is set
to make 2007 the warmest year on record with far-reaching consequences
for the planet, one of Britain's leading climate experts has warned.

As the new year was ushered in with stormy conditions across the UK,
the forecast for the next 12 months is of extreme global weather
patterns which could bring drought to Indonesia and leave California
under a deluge.

The warning, from Professor Phil Jones, director of the Climatic
Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, was one of four
sobering predictions from senior scientists and forecasters that 2007
will be a crucial year for determining the response to global warming
and its effect on humanity.

Professor Jones said the long-term trend of global warming - already
blamed for bringing drought to the Horn of Africa and melting the
Arctic ice shelf - is set to be exacerbated by the arrival of El Niño,
the phenomenon caused by above-average sea temperatures in the Pacific.

Combined, they are set to bring extreme conditions across the globe and
make 2007 warmer than 1998, the hottest year on record. It is likely
temperatures will also exceed 2006, which was declared in December the
hottest in Britain since 1659 and the sixth warmest in global records.

Professor Jones said: "El Niño makes the world warmer and we already
have a warming trend that is increasing global temperatures by one to
two tenths of a degrees celsius per decade. Together, they should make
2007 warmer than last year and it may even make the next 12 months the
warmest year on record."

The warning of the escalating impact of global warming was echoed by
Jim Hansen, the American scientist who, in 1988, was one of the first
to warn of climate change.

In an interview with The Independent, Dr Hansen predicted that global
warming would run out of control and change the planet for ever unless
rapid action is taken to reverse the rise in carbon emissions.

Dr Hansen said: "We just cannot burn all the fossil fuels in the
ground. If we do, we will end up with a different planet.

I am a Republican who believes in man influenced global warming... but I
would rather civilization die off then too have some knee jerk reaction to
socialist rule. So if you want to fix the problem then start yourself by
living by example and teaching others how to do so. If there is a GOD then
he will bless your works. If not then better to die off anyway.

It is very probably to slow down the effects of global warming. The earth
will naturally heal itself just like the body as long as the contributing
factor is shut off. A mini-ice age would not kill off most of civilization.
It's happened before.

So it is very probable to cut off the cause, but it's also very
inconvenient. All the Rich are going to do is escalate the cause until a
majority of the population says "we have no choice but to go towards
communism and socialism." The rich are there own worst enemy right now. They
are standing in the gator pond and the gators are starting to move in.

You missed the killer hurricane season.  The number and intensity of
typhoons in the Pacific were historic in 2006.  Remember, we're talking
about GLOBAL warming, fool -- just because disaster doesn't strike the US
doesn't mean there was no disaster.

Why ban an SUV? What does that solve? Controlism. What is Socialism? It's
controlism for "the better of the people." Why not work on creating energy
efficent SUV's? The technology is there. An SUV to you is nothing more than
a symbol of Republicans. It is infact a truth that SUV's use thousand times
less energy per year than your own house. Did you know running your computer
and monitor uses more fuel than running your SUV? if you are on it more than
you are driving that is?

Let's take an SUV @ 18 mpg x 12,000 miles. That's 667 gallons or 2423 litres.

1 litre of gasoline contains ~ 31.6 MJ/l so that gives 87,244 MJ or 24,234 kWh.

Even a power hungry 500W PC operating 24/7 would only use 4,380 kWh far, far
less than the SUV.

Do you have any more bright ideas ?

Btw - if the SUV uses 1/1000 the energy your house does then your monthly
electricity bills of ~ $200,000 must be giving you a problem !

What can we do. Well, ultimately we will have to give up the consumer
economy, and go to one that can run off of more limited, but clean

&gt;  World faces hottest year ever, as El Niño combines with global
&gt; warming
&gt; By Cahal Milmo
&gt; Published: 01 January 2007

&gt; A combination of global warming and the El Niño weather system is set
&gt; to make 2007 the warmest year on record with far-reaching consequences
&gt; for the planet, one of Britain's leading climate experts has warned.

&gt; As the new year was ushered in with stormy conditions across the UK,
&gt; the forecast for the next 12 months is of extreme global weather
&gt; patterns which could bring drought to Indonesia and leave California
&gt; under a deluge.

&gt; The warning, from Professor Phil Jones, director of the Climatic
&gt; Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, was one of four
&gt; sobering predictions from senior scientists and forecasters that 2007
&gt; will be a crucial year for determining the response to global warming
&gt; and its effect on humanity.

&gt; Professor Jones said the long-term trend of global warming - already
&gt; blamed for bringing drought to the Horn of Africa and melting the
&gt; Arctic ice shelf - is set to be exacerbated by the arrival of El Niño,
&gt; the phenomenon caused by above-average sea temperatures in the Pacific.

&gt; Combined, they are set to bring extreme conditions across the globe and
&gt; make 2007 warmer than 1998, the hottest year on record. It is likely
&gt; temperatures will also exceed 2006, which was declared in December the
&gt; hottest in Britain since 1659 and the sixth warmest in global records.

&gt; Professor Jones said: &quot;El Niño makes the world warmer and we already
&gt; have a warming trend that is increasing global temperatures by one to
&gt; two tenths of a degrees celsius per decade. Together, they should make
&gt; 2007 warmer than last year and it may even make the next 12 months the
&gt; warmest year on record.&quot;

&gt; The warning of the escalating impact of global warming was echoed by
&gt; Jim Hansen, the American scientist who, in 1988, was one of the first
&gt; to warn of climate change.

&gt; In an interview with The Independent, Dr Hansen predicted that global
&gt; warming would run out of control and change the planet for ever unless
&gt; rapid action is taken to reverse the rise in carbon emissions.

&gt; Dr Hansen said: &quot;We just cannot burn all the fossil fuels in the
&gt; ground. If we do, we will end up with a different planet.

One that will suck for human inhabitation, that's for sure. People
do not realize just how important this planet is to _themselves_.

That's it, I've had enough of these extreme positions.

We do not need to get rid of private property to use renewable
energy. I believe humans have a right to private property, and
I do not see the need for stripping them of this.

--- Begin Big Fat Discourse On Extremes ---

Truth is not in extremes -- the NEW structure of civilization that
must be implemented to solve all sorts of world problems, the
NEW civilization that must come soon (within the century) will
not look like any extreme position, rather it must be built off of
a combination of the best things of each form of society,
economy, and government -- the best things that democracy,
capitalism, socialism, anarchy (yes anarchy), theocracy
(yes even theocracy), authoritarianism, and every other
-ocracy and -ism and whatever else have and more. We
have to break free from our dogmas and open our minds. If
we can do that, and I believe strongly it is possible, then
we can build the future civilization. A world of labels and
things being forced into a handful of sides is NOT going to
solve the problem. The amount of possible ways to do
things is not like a few discrete lumps, rather it is a smooth
continuum. Limiting ourselves to a few options is not a
good way to do stuff. Stop thinking black and white and
start thinking color, people! For example, my viewpoint
on two issues: death penalty &amp; abortion. I support the
first, yet oppose the latter. This may seem like a weird
position to take, as you'd think if I support the death
penalty I have no problem with death and would not
mind abortion, or that if I oppose abortion I respect
life so much that I should not allow any death. However,
this is limited.

I believe abortion is wrong since it
terminates a human life unjustly simply for an
irresponsible sex act. Even then I am not extreme in
this position; for example in the case of a rape,
abortion could be an option since the sex act leading
to pregnancy was not intentional. It would be at the
discretion of the woman and perhaps her relatives,
including any parents if they are alive, and their moral
sense. Medical emergencies are another exception.
But abortions due to "pleasure sex" outside marriage
pregnancies are wrong, and I think this view would
make people more responsible with their sexuality.
Human life is more valuable than stupid pleasure sex.
Unfettered sex already has a lot of negative
consequences anyway.

The death penalty, for only a couple of crimes,
namely murder, and the rape of a child, I believe, is
acceptable. One might ask how, if I respect human
life as seen above. Well, OK. I have a right to live,
so do you. But this right is not inalienable. It can be
relinquished. If one commits a murder, one is
denying the victim their right to live, shouldst not
they forfeit theirs as well? Justice would suggest
so. For the rape of a child, well, a child is very,
very delicate, especially a baby. If you look at a
child, look into their eyes, you see a beautiful,
and totally innocent little human being. To damage
them in such a way as with rape is to devastate
them and make them suffer miserably for their
entire life, maybe even wishing they were not alive,
perhaps even driving them to suicide. However,
I do not believe the death penalty may apply to all
cases. Murder may still be punishable by life
imprisonment, as could child-rape. I'm not sure of
the specifics of either, but I know that if a parent
rapes their child at a young age, I believe death
penalties for the father would be more just, since
parents are supposed to care for their children --
look at how a child runs to his/her mommy or
daddy for comfort, support, food, etc. not to
devastate them in this way. Imagine a child
begging for food then suddenly the dad pounces
and rapes. That is atrocious. I would say
he deserves a death sentence for that.

This is the advantage of thinking in color and not
in black and white.

Nobody has the slightest clue whether GW is fixable by people doing anything
conservation-wise.  That is, there is no guarantee that if all humanity died
off tomorrow, that the temperature of the world would not go up sufficiently to
melt all the ice on the planet, release the trapped methane and other
hydrocarbon deposits around the world, and force the temp even higher.

What I'm saying is that _nobody knows_.  Its all just a guess.

Meanwhile, the provable fact is that the sun is getting warmer.  The ice
covering the poles of Mars has been seen to be receding.  Jupiter's great red
spot can now be seen to be accompanied by another permanent storm similar to
it, although it isn't red.

The only thing that _will_ work for sure is to launch a solar shield into orbit
that will cast a shadow on the surface of this planet.  That absolutely will
work, and we can absolutely shield the planet from getting warmer, and can
create a temperature drop of most any magnitude we wish.

But another truth of this problem is that it is a political movement.  As Steve
Forbes said on a TV talk program the Sunday before last, "Global warming is
just socialism done green instead of red."  That pretty much sums it up - an
excuse to promote all the left's darling causes - conservation, smaller cars,
etc.  It is also why the left really doesn't want to hear anything about a
space shield, because it short-circuits their efforts to use this scarecrow
toward their own ends.  The thought that there might be a solution that doesn't
allow them to gain control of people's lives, force them into rollerskate cars
and limit driving and the like just frustrates them no end.

Launch a technological approach to the problem that is sure to work.  Right
now, the _only_ thing that would be sure to work would be a space-based solar
shield that keeps some of the sunlight that would otherwise strike the planet's
surface from doing so.  There is no valid argument possible that such a thing
would not work.  It absoultely would.  What it wouldn't do is allow the left to
instutute world-wide socialism, so they don't want to hear it.

Warmer water can certainly turn tropical storms INTO hurricanes, and
make other hurricane stronger.  But the "experts" were dead wrong about
the 2006 Atlantic Hurricane season.

NOAA predicted 17 named storms in 2006, there were NINE.   They then
started to revise their "predictions" in August when it was obvious
they were WAY off.  If I was this bad at my job, I would be fired in
about 2 seconds.

Rockets, of course, although there are proposals for electromagnetic lauchers
as well.

One proposal is for lots of orbiting spacecraft, arranged around the equator in
the fashion of the rings of Saturn.

Another proposal substitute small plastic disks in place of the orbiting
spacecraft.

Other proposals involve putting disks at the L1 Lagrange point between the sun
and the earth.

&gt; You missed the killer hurricane season.  The number and intensity of
&gt; typhoons in the Pacific were historic in 2006.  Remember, we're talking
&gt; about GLOBAL warming, fool -- just because disaster doesn't strike the US
&gt; doesn't mean there was no disaster.

Irrelevant, as I'm speaking of the "expert" opinions that predicted a
killer hurricane season.  I chose my words carefully, and did NOT say
killer typhoon season.  As I'm sure you know, hurricanes are in the
Atlantic.

Now, back to our main story.  The "experts" were dead wrong.    They
predicted 17 named storms in the Atlantic, there were NINE.  Nearly
half.    They're wrong all the time, or at least, no better than
flipping a coin.  Their claims were based on "Warmer ocean water
combined with lower wind shear, weaker easterly trade winds, and a more
favorable wind pattern in the mid-levels of the atmosphere are the
factors that collectively will favor the development of storms in
greater numbers and to greater intensity."

So now our the "experts" are making the same predicition for '07, based
on the same science and same conclusion.

So it stands to reason, what kind of moron continually bases their
beliefs on "experts" that are wrong?
