Cooperatives eyeing Pendeli

http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_19618091_20/08...

As a prosecutor charged on Saturday a 57-year-old man with starting
last week's destructive forest fire on Mount Pendeli, it emerged that
several cooperatives have been vying to build on the slopes of the
charred mountain, north of Athens.

The unidentified man who has been linked to the Mount Pendeli blaze
has denied charges of arson and endangering lives, claiming to have
been in a cafe on Thursday morning when four blazes broke out in
different locations on the mountain.

The suspect's son, a firefighter, was killed earlier this year while
trying to extinguish a factory blaze, according to police. The
57-year-old is due to appear before an investigating magistrate in the
next few days.

Meanwhile, Kathimerini has discovered that at least 28 labor and
social cooperatives, and even church groups, have been seeking to
build on the slopes of Mount Pendeli, where construction has
mushroomed since a massive fire in 1995. The area of Pendeli is home
to some 20,000 hectares of land regarded as prime real estate worth
millions of euros to would-be developers.

The 28 cooperatives, named in yesterday's Kathimerini, are allegedly
seeking to build on some 2,500 hectares of land destroyed in the 1995
blaze.

The cooperatives in question include groups of workers such as the
Bank of Greece Workers' Association and the Association of Workers and
Insured Citizens of the Social Security Foundation (IKA). A
cooperative of journalists is also said to be eyeing the area. And
Pendeli's local monastery is claiming some 8,000 hectares of land on
the mountain.

The 28 cooperatives also include several of some 128 construction
cooperatives that appear to be active in Attica alone.

&quot;The whole of Pendeli would not be enough to fulfill the demands of
those seeking to build here,&quot; Pendeli forest ranger Alexandros Rigas
had told Kathimerini about a month ago in the wake of the blazes on
mounts Parnitha and Hymettus.

According to experts, the problem is that burnt forestland is not
immediately scheduled for reforestation after fires, allowing
developers to move in.
