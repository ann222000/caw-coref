Wife: Saddam's Double, Not Saddam, Was 'Captured'

by MAXIM POGODIN http://www.conspiracyplanet.com/channel.cfm?channelid=134&amp;contentid=2220

Last week, American authorities arranged a meeting of the former Iraqi dictator with his wife.

She was the first of Hussein's relatives to meet with the ex-leader of Iraq at a new place, at the American military base in Qatar. Accompanied by Sheikh Hamad Al-Tani, Sajida Heiralla Tuffah has arrived from Syria on his private jet in the end of March.

The outcome of their meeting turned out to be quite scandalous. Sajina claims that the person she encountered was not her husband, but his double.

If someone were to say for sure that it was not insinuation, it would have been easy to believe the wife with a 25-year experience. It is also possible to assume that Saddam has simply changed since the day of his sons' deaths, June 24 2003. This however is highly unlikely.

In case we believe Hussein's wife, all DNA testing of the ex-Iraqi leader should be considered a mere fake. Overall, today there remain more questions then there are answers.

On the other hand however, those statements of Hussein's wife can in fact be quite understandable.

After all, this is the easiest way to demoralize an enemy.

Hussein's younger daughter Hala has also arrived at the base in Qatar along with Saddam Hussein's two grandsons and two sisters, total of eight people. They were all invited by Shekh-s wife Muza to stay in one of the palaces.

Eldest daughters Ragad and Rada along with five Hussein's grandchildren have recently arrived to Doha from Jordan.

Elaf| newspaper writes that, most likely, the entire Hussein's family will stay in Qatar permanently.

Saddam Hussein was captured by the American forces in December 2003 and held in one of the palaces in Baghdad in a region controlled by the coalition forces. Afterward, due to security reasons, he was transferred to the American military base in Qatar, where he is expected to remain until the trial.
