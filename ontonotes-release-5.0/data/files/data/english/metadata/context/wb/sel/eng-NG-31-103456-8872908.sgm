[Van Nistelrooy strike edges out Bremen] Tue 18 Sep 07
&lt; http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/fixturesresults/round=15105/matc... &gt;
Real Madrid CF 2-1 Werder Bremen
Ruud van Nistelrooy scored his 50th goal in the UEFA Champions League
to lead Real Madrid CF to victory.

Van Nistelrooy strike edges out Bremen
Real Madrid CF ended a sequence of opening-night defeats in the UEFA
Champions League by overcoming Werder Bremen 2-1 in Group C in what
was their 300th European Champion Clubs' Cup game. Raúl González
delighted the home fans inside the Santiago Bernabéu with the first
goal on 16 minutes. Bremen levelled through Boubacar Sanogo, before
Madrid retook the lead - and all three points - when Ruud van
Nistelrooy scored his 50th goal in the competition 16 minutes from
time.

Risks taken
Madrid coach Bernd Schuster had said before the match that risks would
be taken in search of victory, and his selection included some
surprises. Marcelo was brought in at left-back for his UEFA Champions
League debut, Gonzalo Higuaín replaced Robinho, while Javier Saviola
was omitted despite scoring his first Madrid goal at the weekend. For
the first quarter of an hour, both teams played the ball around calmly
with the hosts doing most of the probing, albeit into well-organised
Bremen territory.

Goals
The breakthrough came for the nine-time European champions in the 16th
minute, Raúl heading past Tim Wiese at his near post following a Van
Nistelrooy cross. The visitors' response took one minute. Serbian
international Duško Tošić picked up possession on the right before
lifting a pass towards Sanogo. The Ivory Coast forward got ahead of
marker Christoph Metzelder and flicked a shot through Iker Casillas's
despairing dive.

End to end
Markus Rosenberg then gave the locals a fright when his shot cannoned
back off Casillas's legs after fine work down the left by Diego. Van
Nistelrooy also went close with a powerful attempt before seeing the
ball taken off his toes by Naldo just when it seemed he was about to
score. Daniel Jensen set his sights on goal four minutes before the
break, but his blast from the corner of the penalty area was parried
to safety by the Madrid keeper.

Similar start
The second half began with similar pace and style, with neither side
going all out to attack. Diego and Sanogo both had efforts blocked in
the same move early on, while Higuaín should have done better than
shoot harmlessly over after making inroads into the Bremen box. Diego,
through whom all of Bremen's creative play was running, enjoyed an
unchecked run through the centre before eventually passing to Jurica
Vranješ who sliced tamely wide.

Back to life
A change was imminent for Madrid, but not before Raúl sought his
second goal of the night with an attempted chip over Wiese who calmly
plucked the ball out of the air. After 68 minutes Schuster sent on
Robinho in a bid to inject freshness into a team that was starting to
look stale. The switch appeared to work as Madrid soon came to life.
Van Nistelrooy collected possession inside the area from a cute Raúl
through ball, which he turned in first time, side-footing the
wrong-footed Wiese to bring up his half-century in the competition.

goalkeeper into the net.

*Payback time for Stuttgart's Meira
&lt; http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/news/kind=1/newsid=590156.html &gt;
Wednesday 19 September 2007 by Alex O'Henley from Glasgow

Fernando Meira is looking to erase his previous memories of Glasgow
when he leads VfB Stuttgart out tonight against Rangers FC at Ibrox.
The 29-year-old captain is one of a few survivors from the Stuttgart
side that lost 2-1 to Rangers on Matchday 1 in 2003/04 having also
tasted defeat the previous season against Celtic FC in the UEFA Cup.
'Amazing crowds'
The Portuguese international defender hopes it is a case of third time
lucky tonight, but if the German champions are going to win he admits
Armin Veh's young side will have to quell a vociferous home support.
&quot;It's very tough to play against teams in Glasgow because the crowds
are so amazing,&quot; Meira told uefa.com. &quot;I've told the younger players
already it's going to be difficult to communicate on the pitch. But it
can also be a motivation and we are used to stadiums full of
supporters in Germany, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem. The
team is ready to show what we are capable of.&quot;
'Getting better'
Stuttgart have endured an indifferent start to the defence of their
Bundesliga title having won only two of their first five matches, but
last weekend's 3-0 victory over FC Energie Cottbus has boosted morale
and Meira insists they will be playing for all three points in
Glasgow. &quot;We are Stuttgart and we always play to win,&quot; Meira added.
&quot;We are a young team and so far we have found it difficult to play at
the same level as last year. We also have a few injuries to key
players and other teams are more motivated against us because we are
the champions. But we're getting better and I hope we can go back to
the top of the Bundesliga in the next few weeks.&quot;
Lofty ambitions
Despite losing to Rangers four years ago Stuttgart progressed to the
knockout stages before losing to Chelsea FC. Meira aims to go one
better this season by reaching the quarter-finals. &quot;We have already
achieved one target in reaching the group stage and now we want to go
higher and aim for the last eight,&quot; he said. &quot;Every teams needs a
dream and that is our dream. We know it won't be easy in this group
because we also have to play [FC] Barcelona and [Olympique] Lyonnais
but we are confident and a win against Rangers would get us off to a
good start.&quot;

== Bayern hungry for consolation prize ==
&lt; http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/news/kind=1/newsid=588300.html &gt;
Wednesday 19 September 2007 by Steffen Potter from Frankfurt

Troubled season
The 2006/07 season was a disappointing one for the club, with Ottmar
Hitzfeld's returning midway through the campaign to replace Felix
Magath, but failing to earn the top-three finish necessary to earn his
side a place in Europe's top club competition. With €67m worth of new
signings since the summer, they will now look to take out their
frustrations on the UEFA Cup.
Long absence
Bayern last appeared in the competition in the 1996/97, having won the
trophy in the previous campaign, and go into the home leg of their tie
against Portugal's CF Os Belenenses already being tipped to win the
crown. They also started the season as favourites to win the German
title, but as recent results have shown, they are not yet invincible
as they initially seemed.
Invincibility myth
Successive 1-1 Bundesliga draws against Hamburger SV and FC Schalke 04
have calmed the atmosphere around Hitzfeld's side, who had scored ten
goals without reply in winning their opening three games. &quot;I have said
from the beginning that we are not on course to run away with title,&quot;
said the veteran coach. &quot;The league is too strong for that.&quot;
Pressure off
With the Schalke draw coming on the eve of the UEFA Cup opener,
goalkeeper Oliver Kahn felt relieved that the big bubble of
expectation surrounding his side had been deflated a little. He said:
&quot;I think it is not too bad that we didn't win against Schalke - this
will stop the euphoria. We can now focus on the next game and start
winning again.&quot;
Star signings
New signings Franck Ribéry, Miroslav Klose and Luca Toni have made
Bayern look fearsome this season, with the Frenchman capturing the
imagination of the German public while Klose is back on song after
struggling at the end of last season with Werder Bremen. Hitzfeld said
of him: &quot;He has matured a lot lately. He is now a player who speaks up
during half-time or before the match.&quot;
Absent players
Midfielder José Ernesto Sosa and defender Philipp Lahm will both miss
Bayern's opener through injury, but Mark van Bommel, Lucio and
Christian Lell are expected to recover in time. Belenenses, meanwhile,
are looking forward to their early chance to test the competition's
giants, with president Cabral Ferreira asking: &quot;What better challenge
could we have?&quot;

&gt; winning again.&quot;
&gt; Star signings
&gt; New signings Franck Ribéry, Miroslav Klose and Luca Toni have made
&gt; Bayern look fearsome this season, with the Frenchman capturing the
&gt; imagination of the German public while Klose is back on song after
&gt; struggling at the end of last season with Werder Bremen. Hitzfeld said
&gt; of him: &quot;He has matured a lot lately. He is now a player who speaks up
&gt; during half-time or before the match.&quot;
&gt; Absent players
&gt; Midfielder José Ernesto Sosa and defender Philipp Lahm will both miss
&gt; Bayern's opener through injury, but Mark van Bommel, Lucio and
&gt; Christian Lell are expected to recover in time. Belenenses, meanwhile,
&gt; are looking forward to their early chance to test the competition's
&gt; giants, with president Cabral Ferreira asking: &quot;What better challenge
&gt; could we have?&quot;

&gt; &gt; *Payback time for Stuttgart's Meira
&gt; &gt; &lt; http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/news/kind=1/newsid=590156.html &gt;
&gt; &gt; Wednesday 19 September 2007 by Alex O'Henley from Glasgow

&gt; &gt; Fernando Meira is looking to erase his previous memories of Glasgow
&gt; &gt; when he leads VfB Stuttgart out tonight against Rangers FC at Ibrox.
&gt; &gt; The 29-year-old captain is one of a few survivors from the Stuttgart
&gt; &gt; side that lost 2-1 to Rangers on Matchday 1 in 2003/04 having also
&gt; &gt; tasted defeat the previous season against Celtic FC in the UEFA Cup.
&gt; &gt; 'Amazing crowds'
&gt; &gt; The Portuguese international defender hopes it is a case of third time
&gt; &gt; lucky tonight, but if the German champions are going to win he admits
&gt; &gt; Armin Veh's young side will have to quell a vociferous home support.
&gt; &gt; &quot;It's very tough to play against teams in Glasgow because the crowds
&gt; &gt; are so amazing,&quot; Meira told uefa.com. &quot;I've told the younger players
&gt; &gt; already it's going to be difficult to communicate on the pitch. But it
&gt; &gt; can also be a motivation and we are used to stadiums full of
&gt; &gt; supporters in Germany, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem. The
&gt; &gt; team is ready to show what we are capable of.&quot;
&gt; &gt; 'Getting better'
&gt; &gt; Stuttgart have endured an indifferent start to the defence of their
&gt; &gt; Bundesliga title having won only two of their first five matches, but
&gt; &gt; last weekend's 3-0 victory over FC Energie Cottbus has boosted morale
&gt; &gt; and Meira insists they will be playing for all three points in
&gt; &gt; Glasgow. &quot;We are Stuttgart and we always play to win,&quot; Meira added.
&gt; &gt; &quot;We are a young team and so far we have found it difficult to play at
&gt; &gt; the same level as last year. We also have a few injuries to key
&gt; &gt; players and other teams are more motivated against us because we are
&gt; &gt; the champions. But we're getting better and I hope we can go back to
&gt; &gt; the top of the Bundesliga in the next few weeks.&quot;
&gt; &gt; Lofty ambitions
&gt; &gt; Despite losing to Rangers four years ago Stuttgart progressed to the
&gt; &gt; knockout stages before losing to Chelsea FC. Meira aims to go one
&gt; &gt; better this season by reaching the quarter-finals. &quot;We have already
&gt; &gt; achieved one target in reaching the group stage and now we want to go
&gt; &gt; higher and aim for the last eight,&quot; he said. &quot;Every teams needs a
&gt; &gt; dream and that is our dream. We know it won't be easy in this group
&gt; &gt; because we also have to play [FC] Barcelona and [Olympique] Lyonnais
&gt; &gt; but we are confident and a win against Rangers would get us off to a
&gt; &gt; good start.&quot;

&gt; &gt; --- * --- * --- * --- * --- * ---
&gt; &gt; about Kapitän Meira :)
&gt; &gt; it's sorta hard.... however perhaps there's nobody will b harm.
&gt; &gt; they'll more unify mind of them.

Hi, EVERY1 HOW R U??

i read in Rui Costa's comment that his personality comes out in his words....
perhaps though it's not knowable about his details 2 speak of, fact
is, i felt my spirit was in high state.

i guess that feelings r some difficult 4 me 2 say, he's a guy rich in
suchlike mood.
so 2 say, i gussed there r more than a few sentimental tone 4 him.
it have a lure 4 me,.... but, it's just a little bit.

and 1 more, i dislike things of too much sorrows... ;P
bcoz that is... no, well, somehow i feel there's no need dig into a
matter, 4 now.

--- UEFA CUP ---

Bayern 1 - 0 Belenenses

Bayern grateful for Toni return
http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/fixturesresults/round=15118/...
Thursday 20 September 2007Match report by Steffen Potter

A first-half strike by Luca Toni proved enough to earn FC Bayern
München a narrow UEFA Cup first-round lead against CF Os Belenenses of
Portugal.

Toni goal
The Italy international had been doubtful to start due to ongoing
thigh problems but with striker Miroslav Klose suspended for the first
leg coach Ottmar Hitzfeld decided to play Toni. And he justified
selection when he met Mark van Bommel's cross on 34 minutes for the
only goal of the game.

Bayern domination
Toni could have given his side the lead after just five minutes when
he was put through on goal by Marcell Jansen's threaded pass but the
30-year-old striker shot over the bar from nine metres. Jansen himself
came close on 26 minutes when he headed wide but Toni soon broke the
deadlock with his close-range strike. The hosts dominated possession
throughout but did not make the most of their chances, Van Bommel's
final pass for Franck Ribéry just lacking the requisite accuracy to
put the Frenchman clear on goal.

Toothless
The second half followed in much the same vein as the first, though
their were fewer openings following the substitution of Toni on the
hour. Germany forward Lukas Podolski tried, in vain, to make the most
of two half-chances, while summer signing Jan Schlaudraff, who was
introduced for the final few minutes, had an uneventful debut, leaving
the Bundesliga side facing the prospect of an uncomfortable trip to
Portugal for the return leg on 4 October.

the level of japanese player was contrary 2 his expectations.
as i told U, they(*japanese Footballer) r very poor in Football.

&gt; --- UEFA CUP ---

&gt; Bayern 1 - 0 Belenenses

&gt; Bayern grateful for Toni return
&gt; http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/fixturesresults/round=15118/...
&gt; Thursday 20 September 2007Match report by Steffen Potter

&gt; A first-half strike by Luca Toni proved enough to earn FC Bayern
&gt; München a narrow UEFA Cup first-round lead against CF Os Belenenses of
&gt; Portugal.

&gt; Toni goal
&gt; The Italy international had been doubtful to start due to ongoing
&gt; thigh problems but with striker Miroslav Klose suspended for the first
&gt; leg coach Ottmar Hitzfeld decided to play Toni. And he justified
&gt; selection when he met Mark van Bommel's cross on 34 minutes for the
&gt; only goal of the game.

&gt; Bayern domination
&gt; Toni could have given his side the lead after just five minutes when
&gt; he was put through on goal by Marcell Jansen's threaded pass but the
&gt; 30-year-old striker shot over the bar from nine metres. Jansen himself
&gt; came close on 26 minutes when he headed wide but Toni soon broke the
&gt; deadlock with his close-range strike. The hosts dominated possession
&gt; throughout but did not make the most of their chances, Van Bommel's
&gt; final pass for Franck Ribéry just lacking the requisite accuracy to
&gt; put the Frenchman clear on goal.

&gt; Toothless
&gt; The second half followed in much the same vein as the first, though
&gt; their were fewer openings following the substitution of Toni on the
&gt; hour. Germany forward Lukas Podolski tried, in vain, to make the most
&gt; of two half-chances, while summer signing Jan Schlaudraff, who was
&gt; introduced for the final few minutes, had an uneventful debut, leaving
&gt; the Bundesliga side facing the prospect of an uncomfortable trip to
&gt; Portugal for the return leg on 4 October.

*Atlético put four past Erciyesspor (21 Sep 2007)
&lt; http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/fixturesresults/round=15118/... &gt;

Club Atlético de Madrid continued their fine European season as they
took a four-goal lead from the first leg of their UEFA Cup first round
tie with Kayseri Erciyesspor.

Atlético on course
Mista and Diego Forlán both struck early before Luis García scored two
late goals to give the UEFA Intertoto Cup winners a useful result
against a Turkish side on their maiden European campaign. Atlético are
on their first UEFA Cup run for seven years and look on course for the
group stage.

Home goals
Javier Aguirre's side began positively and 12 minutes in José Manuel
Juarado's powerful shot was only partially cleared by goalkeeper Yusuf
Soysal and Mista was on hand to turn the ball in. Forlán forced a save
from Yusuf soon after but the Uruguayan striker was soon on the
scoresheet after the custodian parried García's effort. Simão was
brought on midway through the first half when Juarado suffered an
ankle injury but Atlético continued to attack with Forlán putting the
best chance wide.

García clinchers
Two minutes after the break Erciyesspor had their best opportunity.
However, set through on goal, Kamil Sener missed the target. And they
were made to pay late on as Maniche twice combined with García to put
Atlético comfortably in control ahead of their trip to Turkey in a
fortnight, when Erciyesspor will need to improve on their only
previous home game in Europe, a 3-1 defeat of Maccabi Tel-Aviv FC in
the second qualifying round.

*Bayern reflect on muted triumph (21 Sep 2007)
by Alois Urban
&lt; http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/news/kind=1/newsid=592139.html &gt;

Ottmar Hitzfeld conceded that last night's 1-0 home win against CF Os
Belenenses in the UEFA Cup was &quot;not a wonderful result&quot; for his
ambitious FC Bayern München side.

Forgettable performance
Playing in the competition for the first time in eleven years, the
Bundesliga giants were not expected to struggle against the side from
Lisbon, but despite a 64,000 crowd at the Fußball Arena München,
Bayern did not impress. Lukas Podolski, standing in for the injured
Miroslav Klose, had a forgettable game and it was left to Luca Toni to
score the only goal after 34 minutes.

'I'm disappointed'
Italian FIFA World Cup winner Toni almost missed the match with a
nagging thigh injury but ended up being the star of the show as Bayern
struggled to find the spark that lit up their early Bundesliga games.
&quot;Naturally I'm disappointed about the result,&quot; conceded a disappointed
Hitzfeld. &quot;One-nil is not a wonderful result - we expected a lot
more.&quot;

'More respect'
Belenenses coach Jorge Jesus saw things differently, as he looked
forward to bringing Bayern back to the O Restelo Stadium on 4 October.
&quot;We were the unknown side tonight but I think we will be accorded a
lot more respect in the return leg,&quot; he said. Bayern defender
Christian Lell, however, did not anticipate too many problems for his
side in Lisbon. &quot;We kept a clean sheet and scored a goal so now we can
travel to Portugal in a relaxed mood,&quot; he said. &quot;We will have to be
wary in Lisbon but if we put in a solid performance we'll have no
problems.&quot;

*Donis pleased with Rovers return (21 Sep 2007)
by Vassiliki Papantonopoulou
&lt; http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/news/kind=1/newsid=592025.html &gt;

After upsetting Blackburn Rovers with a fine win in Volos, Larissa FC
coach Georgios Donis was only disappointed that his side did not win
more emphatically. &quot;We should have scored more,&quot; he said.

Perfect night
On a perfect night for Greek football all five Super League
participants registered UEFA Cup first round victories. AEK Athens FC
won 3-0 against Austrian champions FC Salzburg, Aris Thessaloniki FC
defeated Real Zaragoza 1-0, while both Panionios NFC and Panathinaikos
FC prevailed 2-0 and 2-1 in their respective trips to FC
Sochaux-Montbéliard and FC Artmedia Petržalka. Larissa FC, meanwhile,
marked their return from 19 years in the European wilderness with a
stylish 2-0 win against Blackburn Rovers FC.

'Very happy'
Although not their own home ground, the Panthessaliko Stadium in Volos
was the scene of Larissa's Greek Cup triumph against Panathinaikos in
May and it again proved a lucky venue as Georgios Donis's side ran out
comfortable winners. Donis, who played for Blackburn from 1996 to
1998, was pleased at putting one over on his former employers but
regretted not having put the tie out of sight. &quot;I'm very happy with
the result but not with the scoreline,&quot; he said. &quot;We had a lot of
chances and should have scored more.

'Hard game'
&quot;The score gives us a 50 per cent chance of qualification,&quot; he
continued. &quot;We are expecting a very hard game at Blackburn. Ewood Park
is a small pitch and we'll be under a lot of pressure. However, we
should enjoy this result. We wanted to make our fans happy and that's
what we've done. We had the time to prepare for this encounter, since
there has been no league action in recent weeks.&quot;

'Disappointed'
For Blackburn, this was their first defeat since the FA Cup semi-final
loss against Chelsea FC in April, and manager Mark Hughes acknowledged
that his side were lucky not to have suffered a heavier defeat. &quot;We
are all disappointed with the levels we've achieved tonight,&quot; he said.
&quot;I didn't expect this result. From our point of view, the one positive
to come out is that we are still in the tie. Luckily we didn't concede
any more goals and 2-0 is a result that we can claw back.&quot;

&gt; in my opinion, it certain that he haven't changed, why, what's the

Mourinho says love affair with Chelsea is never ending

By Martyn Herman

LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Jose Mourinho has spoken of a &quot;never
ending love story&quot; with Chelsea fans in his first public comments
since parting company with the club in the early hours of Thursday
morning.

In a heartfelt letter on the team's Web site ( www.chelseafc.com ), the
Portuguese coach said he was proud of his achievements since taking
over in 2004.

Mourinho's reign, which brought two Premier League titles, two League
Cups and an FA Cup, ended because, in the club's words, their
relationship had &quot;broken down&quot;.

&quot;I am very proud of my work with Chelsea and I think my decision to
come to England was an excellent one,&quot; said Mourinho, who never lost a
home league game at Stamford Bridge.

&quot;It was a beautiful and rich period of my career. I want to thank all
Chelsea supporters for what I believe is a never ending love story.

&quot;I wish great success to the club, a club that will be forever
connected to me for some historic moments. I wish the players
happiness in their football and in their family lives.&quot;

In a separate statement, Chelsea said they had reached agreement on
all contractual arrangements for Mourinho's departure although no
details were disclosed.

&gt; &gt; Mourinho says love affair with Chelsea is never ending
&gt; &gt; 22:15 BST, Thu 20 Sep 2007
&gt; &gt; http://football.uk.reuters.com/uk/news/L20020619.php

&gt; &gt; By Martyn Herman

&gt; &gt; LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Jose Mourinho has spoken of a &quot;never
&gt; &gt; ending love story&quot; with Chelsea fans in his first public comments
&gt; &gt; since parting company with the club in the early hours of Thursday
&gt; &gt; morning.

&gt; &gt; In a heartfelt letter on the team's Web site ( www.chelseafc.com ), the
&gt; &gt; Portuguese coach said he was proud of his achievements since taking
&gt; &gt; over in 2004.

&gt; &gt; Mourinho's reign, which brought two Premier League titles, two League
&gt; &gt; Cups and an FA Cup, ended because, in the club's words, their
&gt; &gt; relationship had &quot;broken down&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &quot;I am very proud of my work with Chelsea and I think my decision to
&gt; &gt; come to England was an excellent one,&quot; said Mourinho, who never lost a
&gt; &gt; home league game at Stamford Bridge.

&gt; &gt; &quot;It was a beautiful and rich period of my career. I want to thank all
&gt; &gt; Chelsea supporters for what I believe is a never ending love story.

&gt; &gt; &quot;I wish great success to the club, a club that will be forever
&gt; &gt; connected to me for some historic moments. I wish the players
&gt; &gt; happiness in their football and in their family lives.&quot;

&gt; &gt; In a separate statement, Chelsea said they had reached agreement on
&gt; &gt; all contractual arrangements for Mourinho's departure although no
&gt; &gt; details were disclosed.
