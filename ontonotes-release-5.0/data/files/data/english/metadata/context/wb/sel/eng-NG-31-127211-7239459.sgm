I'm guessing it better be Capers because what quality guy will want to
come in and fill the spot under a HC who's got one year hanging over
him? If it isn't Capers willing to bail his old buddy out, then I
suspect it'll be an upstart looking to establish himself.

I'm hoping it's Capers.  Only because I know we'll be getting a guy
who's pretty solid.

If they're hiring a DC with the assumption he'll be given an opportunity to
compete with Gilbride for the head coaching job when Coughlin moves on, then
I don't like Capers or Phillips for the role, they both were mediocre head
coaches.
As it appears Ron Rivera and Rob Ryan will be HC's this year, I'm guessing
the guys that might come to the Giants for the HC op might be:
Mike Smith - Jacksonville  - probably won't get a shot there with Del Rio in
place
Rex Ryan - Baltimore - ditto Billick
Dean Pees -  NE - ditto Belichick
If the guy is coming with no aspirations and will ride off with Coughlin,
then I like Capers over Phillips,. he might be able to do for Osi what he
did for Taylor this year. Plus he has a great eye for cornerback talent.

I'm betting Capers is the guy.

Someone who knows that a promotion would be quite possible in the very near
future?

Good point. The situation appeals to the DC with HC aspirations.

The knock on giving a HC a one year extension is you rule out a lot of
DCs interested in a secure job as a DC for a few years. For example,
Bill "I don't know if I want to coach here next year" Parcells just
lost his DC to Atlanta where the new HC inked a five year deal.

Interestingly, Capers had already turned down that same Atlanta DC job.

Touchy situation for Coughlin? Maybe so.

Of course, with Coughlin and Capers being notoriously good friends, we
can hold out hope that they put the egos on the shelf and concentrate
on football. But people will be people.

That's a possibility as well, but if the ship sinks, I still think the
Giants will go after Belichick when his contract's up unless of course
Kraft starts to spend some money...

We went after Pioli and he didn't even want to listen.  Going after someone
and landing them are two different concepts.
