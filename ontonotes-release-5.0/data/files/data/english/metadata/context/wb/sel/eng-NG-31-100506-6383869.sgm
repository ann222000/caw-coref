jacking up a 95 Cavalier

Last Summer I needed to jack up the Cavalier to change the brake
pads.  The jack was moving but the car wasn't.  Bent down to see what
was going on and saw that the jack was starting to sink in the frame
rail.  Tried in a couple of other places.  Same thing.  Eventually was
able to get it.  12 years old, Wisconsin -- I figured that it had
gotten rusty enough down there to weaken the structure.

Tonight I had to jack up the car again to change the spark plug wires
-- the car is hesitating/bucking when I'm driving at a constant speed,
and thought I'd start with plugs, wires, and fuel filter -- and the
same thing happened again.  This time it was the other side.

Is this common for unibody cars?  Is this telling me that the car's
days are numbered?  With those lift notches not an option any more,
what's the best way for me to get this car up if I have to crawl under
there again?

First off I recommend  blocking up the car when jacking before working
on it.  You could get a frame jack, assuming there's a bit of frame to
lift it.
I've only seen a jack go into a body once; it was my brother in laws 3
yr old (about '61) VW Van used for work in a very road salty area.

Unitbody cars are built only strong enough to do the job.  Most of
them have specific jacking points that are reinforced.  Usually I jack
my cars up by part of the engine cradle, its heavy and thick.  Check
owners manual.  You might have enough rust to cause a problem, but I
think you'd see it from the outside by now.

I live on the east coast of Canada, the rustiest place in the world. I've
worked on many old unibody cars and never had a problem like that.

You should take a picture to show where you are jacking.

I had an 84 Honda accord that was so rusty it could no longer take a jack.
The jack would tear right through the "reinforced" metal.  I had to use a
floor jack under the struts somewhere.   I eventually junked the car because
it was no longer safe.

I generally go for engine cradle or suspension points myself, since you
actually have something there to jack against.  I've seen many body channels
crushed where people have put jacks underneath and pumped away.  Those jacks
with small cradles will easily crush body channels, whereas a decent jack
with a larger cradle will spread out the weight better.  Still - sheet metal
is sheet metal, and I don't like jacking against it.

I had an older car and was concerned about the jack going through, although
it never did.
I used a 12" piece of 2x4 to distribute the floor jack's lift.

That is the ticket Colin. Distributing the load is the answer, I've
had to do it often myself on certain vehicles.

Yea, that's what's going on.  I am in fact using a floor jack with a
much smaller craddle than the jack that same with the car.  I'll try
the 2X4 approach next time around.

Thanks everyone for taking the time to reply.
