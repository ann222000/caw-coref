The Patriots have placed cornerback Chad Scott on injured reserve,
ending his season. Scott was carted off the field in Friday's evening
practice, and was holding his left knee.

The Patriots were already a bit thin without Asante Samuel, and this
further hits at the team's depth.

Right. I have never originated a Pats post here. I come here to talk, God

The only time I waste in the Pats NG is to pour salt on open wounds such as

Pats &quot;news&quot;?
Kinny are you really that dense?.

http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/Images/Millen-Sullivan.jpg

I only post pats news when its negative or bad,...get it?

http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/Images/Millen-Sullivan.jpg

I come here to post and read up on the Oakland Raiders AND to post any
negative press on the patriots I can find.

Why do you come here?

http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/Images/Millen-Sullivan.jpg

I don't post in the pats group because Im not a fan. Me posting there
would be ridiculous, much like your presence here.

I don't know what your having trouble understanding, Kinny ocant, but
This is a Radiers NG and  Ill continue to post the absolute worst pats
press I can find because it brings me joy. Like watching you (pats fans)
cry everytime I post a shity story about the pats. Don't you get it
Kinny, Your tears bring me happiness, like little drops of sunshine, And
since you seem to have little to no knowledge of the pats the Raiders,
or the NFL for that matter, you are unable to defend them or yourself.

You know what the worst part is? You've missed most of the funniest stuff
from Pats history. The original message you posted about how bad things were
up here in NE only scratched the surface. Too bad. Some of it is really
funny. Like the time they paged a guy out of the stands to play the second
half of a game. Bob Gladieux. Yes, really. And he played pretty well, too.

Yes, and there's lots more funny shit you missed. Shame.

Ah. I get it. This is a Raiders NG, and you insist on posting Pats news
here. NP. Obviously, the Pats dominate your head space, and you need to get
it out. Damned shame. Rather than try and find something positive about your
team (good luck) you feel the need to attempt to post negs about the team
that you perceive to be evil. I think you should spend less time at the
keyboard and more time on an analysts couch.

One more thing, the pic of Millen is pretty funny shit, but there are two
problems here:

1. Millen didn't make full contact. If he had, Sullivan the younger would
have crumbled.

2. When Millen touched Sullivan, he absorbed all kinds of football
stupidity. Look at the job he's done in Detroit! Truly, a &quot;Sullivan-esque&quot;
performance, dontcha think?

3. You also missed the single event that caused the Sullivans to sell the
team, which was one of the most hilarious episodes in the franchises
history. Had this not happened, we'd still be suffereng with the Sullivans,
possible the worst team owners in NFL history.

Start your guessing now...

So if you didn't come here to read it, how would you know it exists?  Why

The only commonality I can see is that you are still feeling guilty about
the Tuck Game that jumpstarted the whole run.

I think we beat you in the only other game since then... so what else
could it be?  Just admit you got lucky and GO AWAY.  In case you haven't
noticed, nobody likes you here.  Not even a single person.

Or is this the only place you get attention in life?

&gt; the Tuck Game that jumpstarted the whole run.

&gt; I think we beat you in the only other game since then... so what else
&gt; could it be?  Just admit you got lucky and GO AWAY.  In case you haven't
&gt; noticed, nobody likes you here.  Not even a single person.

I admit nothing of the sort. The Pats were the beneficiaries of a
horrible/great call, and took complete advantage, just the Raiders would
have had the situation been reversed. But that, like 1976, is history and
unworthy of discussion. We have more relevant topics to fight about.

And not everyone here hates me. That's not true at all. I have a huge fan
base here. They reply to most of my posts.

And, for my entertainment, they start threads about the Pats to make me feel
at home. I love it!

Ahhh so you are a Usenet nutter, and this is the only way you get
attention in life huh?  I thought they all kind of went away once all the
blogs and other internet forums got popular.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Question: do you waste your time posting Raiders news on the Pats NG? I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doubt it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The only time I waste in the Pats NG is to pour salt on open wounds such
&gt;&gt;&gt; as last season's BIGGEST PLAYOFF CHOKE JOB IN THE HISTORY OF THE NFL.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's great sport to sit back and watch the very predictable reactions we
&gt;&gt;&gt; get.

&gt;&gt; As long as you're watching the Pats, that's OK with me. BTW, didn't they
&gt;&gt; win as many games in the playoffs last year as the Raiders won all year?
&gt;&gt; Hard to keep track.

&gt; oh man.... this is too easy.

Couldn't agree more. Hell, this is the only NG where the regs troll
themselves...

Yes, sometimes we have to... because we go through spells where the real
trolls are utterly uncreative and boring... you are the poster child for
that situation.   Which reminds me... you are way overdue for deposit in the
killfile.   Your unimaginative attempts to entertain us have failed
miserably so there's no reason to waste any more time reading your tripe.
