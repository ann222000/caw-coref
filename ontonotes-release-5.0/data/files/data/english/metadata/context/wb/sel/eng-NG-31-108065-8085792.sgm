Of course they like to all mature at the same time.  So what should I
do with all of them?  I like the crunch but I can't eat too many at
once because they don't agree with me.

Drying or freezing will naturally lose the crunchiness.

Any good recipes that use a lot of them?

Make a bell peeper sauce( oil , onions, tomatoes sauce, minced peppers) then
preserve for winter. Or preserve them roasted and then under oil.
They are not crunchy but good.

I don't grow them, so I don't usually have much in the way of
excess bell peppers, but if I do, I dice them and freeze them.
They come in handy for lots of things, soups or crab cakes, etc.
Omelettes.  I actually buy diced green peppers on occasion when
vegetables are on sale.  Ditto onion.

&gt; I guess my question would be how many do you have?  I like to dice
&gt; them and put them in a hot wok with seasoned oil and do a stir fry
&gt; with them. Of course I add meat and other things to the stir fry.
&gt; For some reason I really like them with a course grind of black
&gt; pepper.
">

I agree with Michael; it would be good to know how many you have.  Another
question to ask would be, do they bother you more if they are raw or cooked?

To use them cooked, I'll make sausage, onions and peppers (that's excellent
as a sandwich, too!), fajitas, I'll toss them on a pizza, I'll grill them
(they're excellent grilled and wrapped in bacon, too), I'll use them in
kabobs....

To use them raw, I'll slice them into wedges and use in place of bread for
tuna salad, I'll use in green salads, I'll slice them and coat them with
cream cheese, or I'll just slice them and dip them in ranch dressing.

Anyway, I hope this helps!

I blanch them (after cleaning) and then stuff them with a rice/steamed
ground beef/diced tomatoes/herbs &amp; seasoning  mix, and top with lots
of shredded cheese.  I then freeze them in singles, and if they're big
peppers and stuffed well, one pepper will make two entrees for me.

I made the following recipe last weekend and froze the leftovers.  I
had 6 green bells but it called for reds.   I used way more veggies
than the recipe called for but only had one can of diced tomatoes.  so
I used a few tiny cans of tomato sauce.  After I applied loads of
pepper and a bit of salt I put the pork slices in a big bowl of flour
and tossed it before flash frying.  I also buttered the noodles and
served the noodles, veggies, and meat slightly overlapping each other.

It was a wonderfully simple meal.  I froze most of it as there was
only two of us eating.  When I re-serve I'll do fresh pork but I have
not doubt it will be just as good second time around.

Jagerschnitzel
SOURCE: Cooking Light YEAR: June 2000 PAGE: 212

INGREDIENTS FOR 4 SERVINGS:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
3 cups thinly sliced mushrooms
3 cups coarsely chopped red bell pepper
2 cups coarsely chopped onion
1 cup thinly sliced carrot
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon paprika
2 tablespoons water
1 pound pork tenderloin
1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
Cooking spray
3 cups hot cooked yolk-free noodles (about 6 ounces uncooked pasta)
Chopped fresh parsley (optional)

INSTRUCTIONS:
Pork tenderloin slices are pounded into thin cutlets (or Schnitzel)
and served with a vegetable stew in this homage to Alpine hunters.

1. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add
mushrooms, bell pepper, onion, carrot, and garlic; saute 10 minutes.
Add tomatoes; cover, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes or until
vegetables are tender. Combine flour, paprika, and water in a small
bowl. Stir into tomato mixture; cook 3 minutes or until slightly
thick. Keep warm.

2. Trim fat from pork; cut pork crosswise into 16 pieces. Place each
piece between 2 sheets of heavy-duty plastic wrap, and flatten each
piece to 1/4-inch thickness using a meat mallet or rolling pin.
Sprinkle both sides of pork with black pepper and salt. Place a large
nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat until
hot. Add pork; cook 4 minutes on each side or until done.

3. Serve vegetable mixture over noodles; top with pork slices. Garnish
with parsley, if desired. Yield: 4 servings (serving size: 1-1/4 cups
sauce, 3/4 cup noodles, and 4 pork slices).

Any excess peppers get diced up, sauteed until cooked way down and
almost falling apart and then made into red pepper bread. Just
add them to any white bread recipe toward the end of mixing.
Add sauteed onions, too.

Will they turn red if you let them hang? If not skip this post but if so
just let 'em hang. Eat what you want at your own pace. When pepper turns
red, blacked the skin with a flame and peel it off. Slice in half and
remove seeds. Slather with olive oil and place on hot grill until you
get grill marks. Turn over and repeat. Serve with a squeeze of lime
juice as an accompaniment to most any dish.

You can prepare and freeze the finished dish.

Pepper steak freezes well, as do stuffed peppers.

I usually saute a whole mess of peppers, some with onions... freeze in
one and two cup portions, then add to stews and soups during winter...
also good to top omelets, burgers, and bake into corn muffins.  I also
like to add bell peppers to some of my home made tomato sauce.

Even though I grow a lot I don't usually end up with a lot of extra
bell peppers, they're one of the things I rarely give any away.
Somehow they seem to get eaten in salads, very good diced into cottage
cheese, tuna salad, slaw, etc... and I like fried peppers in so many
things, goes great with scrambbled eggs, a western omelet, lox n'
eggs, salami n' eggs.  Sometimes when I feel ambitious I'll make up a
big batch of fried rice and top it with sweet n' sour chicken w/
peppers and pineapple, with snow peas and green onion, etc.  Peppers
are very good in stir frys.

Bell peppers are easy to use up.

http://www.recipeamerica.com/recipes/pepper.htm

Of course you can use up a lot of bell peppers as pizza topping, or
diced into sloppy joe.

Here, this looks mighty tasty, and can be frozen:

Some how I ended up with 25 plants including extras from other

purple, and green peppers.  Guess I'll leave some to turn red.

Both cooked and raw gives me problems if I eat them too late in the

Peppers no longer continue to ripen once picked.

But if you pull the entire plant up by its roots and hang the plant
upside down in a paper bag the peppers already formed on the plant
will ripen somewhat more.  Those perfect looking Holland peppers are
produced in a controlled environment as well.  Most sold in the US are
produced in CA and FL.

Most of those vibrantly colored peppers are hot house grown in a
scientifically controlled environment.  It's near impossible to grow
such specimens in the home garden.

We freeze them after removing the seeds/core and use them in cooking.  Last

I like them stir fried in peanut oil with garlic and a little bit of

I also add some crushed chilies, and right at the end, some soy sauce.

Here are two recipes much prized by people who like bell peppers (I am
not one of them).  The first one is a peperonata recipe from _Cucina
Italiana_ compiled by Accademia Italiana della Cucina.
(Notice: a 'glass' measure, as defined in the book, is 150-200 ml)
Green and red peppers can be used instead of or in addition to yellow
ones.
The second recipe is from _Trattoria_ by Patricia Wells, complete with
her comments.

Peperonata
Vegetable stew with peppers

700 g (1.5 pounds) yellow bell peppers
350 g (0.8 pounds) ripe tomatoes
350 g (0.8 pounds) onions
1/2 glass (75-100 ml/2.5-3.4 US oz) vinegar
1/2 glass (75-100 ml/2.5-3.4 US oz) oil
salt

Wash the peppers, remove the seeds and membranes, and cut in thin
strips.  Peel and core the tomatoes.  Peel and mince the onions.  Put
the vegetables in a large casserole with a well-fitted cover.  Salt
and add the oil.  Cover and slowly cook over moderate heat for about 1
hour.
The peppers must be just ready by now.  Pour in the vinegar and cook
everything through for a few minutes longer.  As soon as the sauce
thickens, transfer the dish to a platter and let cool.  The dish can be
served cold, warm, or hot.

Oven-Roasted Peppers
Peperoni al Forno

Whenever I have a batch of these delicious red and green roasted peppers
at hand, I feel secure, as though my larder were somehow complete.
These peppers can wear many hats: as a quick lunch with a slice of
grilled bread; as a sauce tossed with warm pasta, as a member of a
lovely antipasto table.  I've sampled these at trattorias all over
Italy.  Sometimes they are roasted and served as is with just a touch of
oil and salt and sometimes they have a nice vinegary tang.  Take your
choice.  Be sure to watch the peppers as they bake: the goal here is
peppers that a re soft and fully cooked, with most of the skin still
attached.  If they scorch, or bake at too high a temperature, the skins
fall away and the peppers become unpleasantly dry or rubbery and
sometimes bitter.  Should you also find yellow or orange peppers in the
market, try all four varieties for a festival of colour.  Or, if you are
partial to red peppers, stick with a single hue.  Even those who profess
a dislike for peppers will be surprised by the sweetness of this dish.

4 red peppers (about 1 1/2 lb, 750 g)
4 green peppers (about 1 1/2 lb, 750 g)
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Fine sea salt to taste
1 tablespoon best-quality red wine vinegar (optional)

1.  Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C, gas mark 4)

2.  Wash the peppers, quarter them and remove the seeds and membranes.
Place in a covered baking dish large enough to hold them comfortably.
Toss with the oil and season lightly with salt.

3.  Cover and place in the centre of the oven.  Bake for 1 to 1 1/2
hours, turning the peppers from time to time so they do not scorch.
Remove from the oven and, if desired, toss with the vinegar.  Taste for
seasoning.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

Yield: 8 to 10 servings as an appetizer

Even hot peppers don't ripen once picked.  With some varieties if
picked when almost fully ripe they may ripen further some almost
imperceptible amount, but they will definitely rot before they ripen
noticably.  Peppers are a fruit and ripening fruit means an increase
in sugar content, not a change in color... color change is an
indicator of ripeness ONLY while still on the plant.  Peppers may turn
color while dehydrating but that is not ripening, that's oxidation...
if peppers are kept moist they will rot (rotting peppers change color
too).  Some fruits continue to ripen after picking but peppers are not
one of those.

The color change sqwertz notices on his store bought is a combination
of rot and oxidation.. he has no idea how long ago those store bought
were picked.  Once picked peppers should be consumed as soon as
possible, or otherwise preserved (pickled/dehydrated).

I grow bell pepeprs and hot peppers, especially lots of jalopenos...
no way a store bought is gonna taste anywhere as good as my freshly
picked home grown.... and I pick em at all different stages, from
nubile green crispy critters to saggy wrinkled old bag reds.

&gt; rec.food.cooking

&gt; &gt; Of course they like to all mature at the same time.  So what should I
&gt; &gt; do with all of them?  I like the crunch but I can't eat too many at
&gt; &gt; once because they don't agree with me.

&gt; &gt; Drying or freezing will naturally lose the crunchiness.

&gt; &gt; Any good recipes that use a lot of them?

&gt; I guess my question would be how many do you have?  I like to dice them
&gt; and put them in a hot wok with seasoned oil and do a stir fry with them.
&gt; Of course I add meat and other things to the stir fry.  For some reason I
&gt; really like them with a course grind of black pepper.

&gt; Here is a recipe I found a awhile back.  This is not a stir fry but you
&gt; could certainly use a wok. It sounds tempting with a few of my own
&gt; variations.  I have yet to try it but think I'll give it a go as a side
&gt; dish this weekend. I think I'll serve it with some grilled peppered
&gt; steak.

&gt; Bell pepper rings are fried and seasoned.

&gt; INGREDIENTS:
&gt; 2 pounds green peppers (about 6 medium), cut into 1/4-inch rings
&gt; 3 tablespoons salad oil
&gt; 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
&gt; 1/2 teaspoon salt

&gt; PREPARATION:
&gt; Remove ribs from pepper rings.
&gt; Heat oil in large skillet. Add pepper rings; cook, over high heat and
&gt; stirring frequently, until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with
&gt; garlic salt and salt. Serve at once.
&gt; Makes 6 to 8 servings of pepper rings.
">

That's pretty much what I do, but I'd specify a decent oil (peanut),
and the salt would all come from soy sauce added about a minute or two
before plating.  I also use a tiny bit of msg if I'm not adding any
meat, and either add crushed red chiles just before the soy sauce, or
cayenne sprinkled on afterward.

Yep, I notice that with jalapenos...I like to keep them out for a
little whiles in my big white fruit/vegetable bowl on the kitchen
table.  If it's hot and steamy (like our current weather) I don't dare
leave them out more than a day, just like I don't leave out bell
peppers - they'll rot.  In the winter when the humidity and temp are
low I can leave them out for a few days, eventually some will turn
orange - ish, and if I leave them for a long time they will just
eventually shrivel up...

I dislike bell pepper.

So I use my excess by leaving them at the grocery store.

Or, if eating out, by decorating the edge of the plate with them.

Peperonata!
Sautee some garlic in EVO oil and add bell peppers roughly chopped, some
finely chopped onion and a little water to keep it wet for the first 10
minutes of cooking, over medium gas. Add very few tomato sauce, reduce fire
to low, cover, salt and let go for about half an hour or so.
It makes a nice side dish with almost anything, and someone also uses it to
dress cooked plain rice or pasta. You can obviously add some hot peppers to
give it more strength.
A friend of mine used to make his &quot;pizza ai peperoni&quot; by simply baking a
disc of pizza dough and then topping it with peperonata and shredded
mozzarella.
It can also be served cold but lukewarm is better, and hot smoking is the
best.

It is very potent stuff.  You only need a tiny bit.  1/8t maximum in a
stir fry (one extra large plate full).  I only use it if I'm not
adding meat.  It makes a difference.

The way you see the stuff, sold in huge containers, can only suggest
that many folks use FAR more.

Not for me.  I like salt.  MSG causes other odd problems.

Now they use fake foods, like autolyzed yeast extract, and possibly
modified food starch, as glutamic acid sources, without having to label
it as containing msg.
