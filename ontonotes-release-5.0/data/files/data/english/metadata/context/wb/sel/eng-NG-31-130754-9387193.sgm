*********************** ARTICLE START ***********************
Developing a business online provides the potential for a dynamic that is available only minimally in traditional brick and mortar counterparts. The potential I’m talking about is networking.

In a more traditional business environment you may be tied more closely to the day-to-day operations of the facility and face-to-face encounters with customers. Networking might happen in an after hours setting or by phone, but is hard to manage in the same terms as is possible in an online environment.

Because of the immediacy available online a business owner can conduct business utilizing autoresponders for order confirmation and automated software for label printing. The business owner does not necessarily need to be physically present for transactions to take place. This frees up time for marketing endeavors.

In an online environment there may actually be more marketing skills available than traditional brick and mortar stores.

One of those skills is the development of a network. A few clicks can help you locate peripheral businesses that may be inclined to assist you in a mutually agreeable link exchange or simply as a courtesy. Friendships can be developed and expanded networks enacted.

Remember an online business is a globally available business so reaching out to someone in another business could mean a business down the road or in another country.

The back links that are derived from the simple act of business networking can provide an enormous boost in search engine rankings.

Some of these networking opportunities can be derived from participation in industry specific forums. Friendships naturally develop from the type of correspondence associated with forums and you can also anticipate those who may not make a good fit in networking. The result is an outgrowth of something we all want anyway – friendship.

There has been a saying in marketing for a very long time, “Always sell to your friends first.” In the case of Internet marketing the premise may be to sell an idea to those you establish a networking relationship with.

The idea of a link exchange can be mutual, but you should not be afraid to ask the individual if they would consider placing your link on their site once a friendship has been established.

Another key reason network marketing holds such great promise is that when it comes to an online environment you can lock into a niche community where similar enthusiasm exists and an appreciation for what you may be doing in business may be accepted in a way that is unfamiliar to you if you have ever operated a traditional storefront retail outlet.

The best way to describe networking is to use the Internet itself. The Internet uses connections between computers and servers to link those who use the Internet together to create an environment of mutual sharing of ideas and knowledge. On a personal basis networking brings individuals together using the Internet-working to bring about the potential for improved visibility to other online customers. The idea is to provide mutual benefit and improved overall performance.

Hopefully this article helps you understand some of the reasons why networking is important. Without networking the Internet would not exist. The same may be true of your online business.
