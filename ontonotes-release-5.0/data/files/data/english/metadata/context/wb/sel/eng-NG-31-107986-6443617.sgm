Hello All

I've been through New Brewing Lager Beer a couple times now, and I've
learned a lot. I'm comfortable with a single decoction mash and intend
to try it out twice in the next brew session.

At the end of ch-14, he provides several simple recipes for lager
styles. Now, in these recipes (e.g. the Munich dark) he states:

Doughing-in: 8 quarts
Mashing-in: 5 quarts
Strike Temp: 155F

What are the water quantities for? Are they quantities of boiling water
to be used for a step/infusion mash?

This is probably a silly question, but I just want to be clear on
it. Since he leaves infusion mashes for the appendices, I'm confused
by the appearance of these numbers in the recipes.

Thanks,

JB

Personally, I wouldn't bother with a decoction.  It's a lot of extra
work and there's really not much benefit.  Note also that I believe
Noonan has come out and said (after the book was written) that he probably
wouldn't recommend it anymore either because of the quality of grains we
have available today.

I think those are just the volume of the initial strike water.  IE, both
are added before the real mash begins.  It looks kind of strange to
list them seperately like that, but I think that's what he meant.

I don't think "Doughing-in" and "Mashing-in" are seperate infusion steps.
It think he's just breaking the initial water into two categories.

John, it's been a while since I read the Noonan book, but I do remember
reading in some places that there is a "dough-in" where your goal is
mainly to wet the grain and avoid doughballs and there is a "mash-in"
where you aim to reach your sac. rest temp.

That said, I'm not close to my Noonan book so I can't really comment
about what he meant.

For certain grain types the dough-in and mash-in have been collapsed
into one step. Noonan gives the protein test/calculation one can run
from the malt assay.

John: I know a decoction isn't strictly required, but I want to try it
anyway. IMO a single decoction is not much more work than a step mash,
maybe even less. I'm just curious. It's my intention to do (in the
future) a specific beer formulation twice in one session - one with a
simple infusion, and one with a single decoction, and compare.

I'm not in the least bit interested in doing a double or triple
decoction, though :-)

Greg states in the book that decoction is not always necessary and in
fact sometimes can be harmful with fully modified malts. He goes on to
provide some SNR calculations to determine whether or not a decoction
is merited.

It's worth a try. I'm really just curious about the process. As I
said, I plan to do a comparison brew soon.

Thanks - JB

Yeah, that's actually how I do it too.  I "dough in" with around 115F water,
roll my sleeves up and knead the grains by hand to make sure it all gets
wetted and there aren't any dough balls.  Then I add another shot of boiling
strike water (aka "mash in") to raise it up to my mash temp.

That's probably what Noonan is talking about.  IE, they're not really
seperate rests as part of a multi-step infusion, but rather just a
way of adding your initial strike water.

Keep in mind that protein rests are usually not necessary with most
fully modified malts we have today.  You used to be able to get
undermodified malt which required it, but it's really difficult to
even find that stuff these days.  I don't dough in for protein reasons,
I just do it because I find it easier than trying to stir the mash in
order to get rid of clumps and/or dough balls, etc.

No problem.  It's always good to try things out and see for yourself.
If you do find that it makes a noticable difference, let us know.

Just about all of the malt you can find today is fully modified, it's
actually really difficult to find under modified malt.  That may have
been different when the book was written.

IMO, definitely worth a try if you're interested in it.  Let us know
what the results were if you think about it.

Yep. Strictly from the "science geek" standpoint I feel compelled to
try it out. I believe there are still some folks lurking here in r.c.b
who decoct to this day, so it's worth a shot.

Gotta talk it over with my better half - not sure if she'll want to do
the comparison brew (decoct vs. infusion) this lager session or in 2.5
months at the next one. We may just do a Vienna and a Munich Dark this
session and save the comparison for next time. Sadly, our lagering
throughpout is bandlimited by the size of my lagering fridge ;-)
