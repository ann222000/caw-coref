&gt;  9/11/01 the infamouse day

&gt; Two Boeing 767 aircraft plow into the two tallest towers of the World
&gt; Trade Center with each structure eventually collapsing in free-fall to
&gt; complete destruction resulting in the deaths of thousands. A third
&gt; aircraft, reputedly another 767, slams into the side of the Pentagon
&gt; which happened to be under construction-resulting in the deaths of
&gt; dozens more.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; To this day, a great deal remains to be explained about how this could
&gt; have been possible in what is supposedly the most fortified, well
&gt; defended and patrolled airspace on Earth. There was clearly plenty of
&gt; warning from foreign intelligence services of an impending attack of
&gt; this scale and nature-nothing appearently was done to prepare for,
&gt; much less prevent this attrocity-Why?

&gt; Other questions-
&gt; Why did three large structures collapse at WTC? The third was not
&gt; struck by any aircraft of any size. Only some debris from the
&gt; adjoining collapse struck WTC #7 with comparitively minor damage and
&gt; fires. Yet it collapsed completely in free-fall just hours after the
&gt; other two structures did.

&gt; How was burning jet fuel and office furnishings able to heat huge
&gt; structural steel beams to their melting points(allegedly causing the
&gt; collapse of the two tallest structures)? The chemical energy contained
&gt; within jet fuel and the materials used in construction and furnishings
&gt; was simply not enough to create the very high temperatures needed to
&gt; weaken and melt structural steel-yet a significant pool of molten
&gt; metal was witnessed by emergency personnel beneath the rubble.

&gt; Why was the rubble so quickly hauled away before a complete
&gt; investigation was conducted?

&gt; Why have contents of the &quot;black boxes&quot; of the impacting aircraft not
&gt; been released for public review?

&gt; Concerning the Pentagon impact-

&gt; If a large (767 sized) aircraft did indeed slam into the Pentagon, why
&gt; was the damage so minimal for such a large impact and explosion? It is
&gt; claimed(in the &quot;official government version&quot;) that the plane grazed
&gt; the ground just in front of the Pentagon before impact. But
&gt; photographs from just hours afterward show no damage to the lawn where
&gt; the speeding aircraft should have made contact with the ground. And
&gt; several obstacles in the aircraft's path(including several large
&gt; construction spools and an SUV) were not struck as they were
&gt; completely intact. Most of the bulidings facade, including many un-
&gt; broken windows remained intact for some time before finally collapsing-
&gt; only the first floor appeared severely damaged. Also, how did such a
&gt; large aircraft manage only to bore a small hole a few feet in diametre
&gt; through the inner rings of the Pentagon structure? Where were the
&gt; debris from the fuselage, wings and tail-none is to be seen in the
&gt; photos following the impact.

&gt; Numerous serveillance videos around the Pentagon and from nearby
&gt; businesses were immediately confiscated and witheld from viewing by
&gt; the government. The one video that has been released is extremely
&gt; vague about just what the fuzzy object was that was shown impacting
&gt; and exploding on the side of the Pentagon-why not release all of them?

&gt; As with the aircraft that impacted at the WTC-where is the &quot;black box&quot;
&gt; from the impacting aircraft(if indeed it was an aircraft) at the
&gt; Pentagon?

&gt; These questions are only the beginning-there is far, far more about
&gt; this event that, after half a decade continues to elude answers.

&gt; Nonetheless, investigations do and should continue about 9/11 until
&gt; ALL questions are fully and decisively answered with good hard
&gt; evidence, most of which for five years has been intentionally withheld
&gt; by the U.S. government.

Conclusion. mooslimes are criminal pieces of shit. Your pappy was
involved too, wasn't he?

&gt; Reality is that Bush had his orders from God(Gran'da'dy the Lord of
&gt; lords)... Read why the Towers of Babel where brought down... And you
&gt; will understand that 911 was done with direct knowledge from
&gt; heaven...

&gt; THE TOWER OF BABEL  AFFAIR... the 911 of the bible and destruction of
&gt; Babylon...

&gt; AND

&gt; THE CONFUSION that followed... The Original 9/11

&gt; Here we have a great city like New York. But it is great, not as Bled
&gt; es Salem is great (as God's city, and land of Salvation), but great in
&gt; its defiance of God. This is man's city, the secular city. It is of
&gt; man, by man, and for man's glory.

&gt; The later Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar(Bush) is the clearest biblical
&gt; illustration of these elements. It is about Nebuchadnezzar, who
&gt; embodies the secular city, and God, who operates through Daniel and
&gt; his friends(Usenet). The key to the Book of Daniel is in the opening
&gt; verses which say that after Nebuchadnezzar had besieged and conquered
&gt; Jerusalem (though it was &quot;the Lord [who] gave Jehoaikim. king of Judah
&gt; into his hand&quot;), he took some of the sacred vessels of the temple
&gt; treasury, brought them to Babylon and there &quot;put the vessels [in the
&gt; treasury] house of his god&quot; (Dan. 1:2). This was Nebuchadnezzar's way
&gt; of saying that his gods were stronger than Jehovah. And so it seemed!
&gt; God had certainly permitted Nebuchadnezzar to triumph over his own
&gt; people in punishment for their sins.(See it like what happenend to
&gt; Saddam and his people)

&gt; God had said, &quot;Your kingdom will be succeeded by other kingdoms,
&gt; kingdoms of silver, brass and iron.&quot; Nebuchadnezzar replied, &quot;No, my
&gt; kingdom will endure; it will always be glorious--I will create a
&gt; statue of which not only the head will be of gold, but the shoulders,
&gt; thighs and legs also. It will all be of gold, for it will represent me
&gt; and my descendants forever.&quot; This personal involvement with the statue
&gt; explains the king's violent reaction when the three cheriff's refused
&gt; to bow down to it.

&gt; It is the rebellion of man against God, period. God is He to whom we
&gt; are responsible. But fallen men and women do not want to be
&gt; responsible to anyone. They want to rule themselves. They want to
&gt; exclude God from His own universe. at the secular city is also by man
&gt; for man comes out in the remainder of Nebuchadnezzar's story. One day,
&gt; a or more after the earlier incident, Nebuchadnezzar was walking on
&gt; the roof of his palace in Babylon and he looked out over the city. He
&gt; was impressed with its magnificence. Judging himself to be responsible
&gt; for this, he took to himself the glory that should have been given to
&gt; God, saying, &quot;Is not the great Babylon I have built as the royal
&gt; residence, by my mighty power for the glory of my majesty?&quot; (Dan.
&gt; 4:30). It was a claim that the earthly city been constructed by man
&gt; and for man's glory.(Just like NEW YORK)

&gt; Nebuchadnezzar had constructed the city, and his conquests had brought
&gt; it to great architectural splendor. Again, he had undoubtedly
&gt; constructed it for his glory, Nimrod had constructed the first Babylon
&gt; for his glory. What both had forgotten is that ultimately it is God
&gt; who in the affairs of men and that the achievements of a secular ruler
&gt; are made possible only through the common gifts of God to humanity.

&gt; Nebuchadnezzar had judged himself superior to those around him because
&gt; of his political achievements, so superior that he had no need of God.
&gt; God speaks to show how mistaken Nebuchadnezzar was. God says, &quot;This is
&gt; what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar: Your royal authority has
&gt; been taken from you. You will be driven away from people and will live
&gt; the wild animals; you will eat grass like cattle. Seven times will
&gt; pass by for until you acknowledge that the Most is sovereign over the
&gt; kingdoms of and gives them to anyone he pleases&quot; (Dan. 4:31, 32). The
&gt; judgment is to effect immediately. Nebuchadnezzar's mind goes from
&gt; him, and he is driven from the city. The text says, &quot;He was driven
&gt; away from people and ate grass like cattle. His body was drenched with
&gt; the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle
&gt; and his nails like the claws of a bird&quot; (v. 33). Eventually Babylon
&gt; itself fell, never to rise again.

&gt; BABEL, TOWER OF

&gt; This expression does not occur in the Old Testament, but is used
&gt; popularly for the tower mighdol built by the inhabitants of the world
&gt; who, traveling in the East, built a city on the Plain of Shinar, with
&gt; a tower &quot;whose top may reach unto heaven&quot;--an expression which is
&gt; regarded as meaning &quot;a very high tower.&quot;

&gt; Genesis 10:11
