Seeing as the january sales have presented  me with the bargins i don't need
and that i've choosen to take the more you spend the more you save attitude
i'm looking in to a new bottom bracket and crankset.

Raceface turbine cranks, both square taper and ISIS are down to 50 quid
( http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/Models.aspx?ModelID=52 ) .

I've only ever used standard shimano square taper in the past so my
practical knowledge of any splined system is nil, however i've read that
ISIS bottom brackets , due to there oversized spindle taking up more room,
use smaller ball bearings which are prone to loosening, collapse and being
completely ground to dust. How much of a concern do you folks find this, any
experience?
The crank brother sale spiel boasts 2 rows of driveside ball bearings for
there splined bottom brackets; is this standard to all ISIS bottom bracket
and if not does it realistically make these a better choice than one without
(FSA perhaps)?
Lastly, is the ISIS system that much stiffer than all tapered BB's? This one
for example:

Thanks for your views.

I've heard nothing but bitching from my mates about ISIS. They come
loose, bearings are utter shite, and the longevity is extremely short
compared to a square taper cartridge.

I'd stick with square, or if stiffness is an issue, go for Octalink.

No problem, just wanted to "upgrade". Reasonable enough mind as i'm 200+ lb
rider, and i'm sure this upgrade would give better transfer than my current,
but excellent value for money, deore setup.  What would you suggest now?

i'm a ~205# and i love octalink - it's definitely stiffer.  i noticed it
immediately i climbed my first hill on my first octalink crank set, and
i noticed it again recently when i built a cross frame with a square
taper.  the cranks were awful.  went back to octalink again - much stiffer.

Aha! I figured as much.

A quick google shows that there are some nice ISIS BBs with roller
bearings, being a Swede, I'd have to go with a sexy SKF model:

"awful"?

Unless the crankarms were identical , this observation is useless.

no one was more surprised than me.  on my first experience, all other

not useless, but since you have to have octalink arms to run an octalink
spindle, the two events are inextricably tied.

out of curiosity, do you weigh as much as me?  could this affect your
own experience with octalink?

Hmmm....I wonder if "having chains slip on worn teeth" caused you to
hold back a bit on your old setup? Perhaps the freedom from slip led
to an increased effort which led to an impression of greater stiffness
in the spindle. I think coming off worn, slip prone chinrings to a
totally new crankset muddies the comparison quite a bit.

Sure, but does that translate into anything that can reliably be
discerned by actual human beings riding bicycles? It's just possible
that all the measurements do is to fuel expectation effects and help
sell the "new technology".

On a related note, I find it fascinating that some people are ga-ga
about the supposed "stiffness" of external bearing BBs while at the
same time they bury their heads in the sand regarding the very real
added drag of those designs. Go figure.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with dependable install-and-forget square tapers.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; www.yellowjersey.org
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Open every day since 1 April, 1971
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No problem, just wanted to &quot;upgrade&quot;. Reasonable enough mind as i'm 200+ lb
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rider, and i'm sure this upgrade would give better transfer than my current,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but excellent value for money, deore setup.  What would you suggest now?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; i'm a ~205# and i love octalink - it's definitely stiffer.  i noticed it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; immediately i climbed my first hill on my first octalink crank set,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am surprised that someone with a technical/engineering background
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would make a statement like this when, it seems, no attempt was made
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to eliminate all the variables, including expectation effects. :-0
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no one was more surprised than me.  on my first experience, all other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; componentry on the bike was identical.  going octalink was merely $20
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more expensive than buying new chain rings, so i thought i'd give it a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; go.  i had no expectations other than not having chains slip on worn
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; teeth.  especially as i thought frame flex was much more of a factor.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hmmm....I wonder if &quot;having chains slip on worn teeth&quot; caused you to
&gt;&gt;&gt; hold back a bit on your old setup? Perhaps the freedom from slip led
&gt;&gt;&gt; to an increased effort which led to an impression of greater stiffness
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the spindle. I think coming off worn, slip prone chinrings to a
&gt;&gt;&gt; totally new crankset muddies the comparison quite a bit.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; i noticed it again recently when i built a cross frame with a square
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taper.  the cranks were awful.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Was it the cranks (i.e., the crankarms) or the spindle that was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;awful&quot;?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probably both.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Or perhaps it was just the crankarms. That's the point: lacking any
&gt;&gt;&gt; kind of control of the variables, you'll never know.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  went back to octalink again - much stiffer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unless the crankarms were identical , this observation is useless.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not useless, but since you have to have octalink arms to run an octalink
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spindle, the two events are inextricably tied.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, but if this impression of additional stiffness is verifiable
&gt;&gt;&gt; under controlled conditions, it would be good to know if the benefit
&gt;&gt;&gt; came wholly (or, at least, mostly) from the crankarms or if Octalink
&gt;&gt;&gt; really has something to offer (other than marketing) that makes it
&gt;&gt;&gt; worthwhile to scrap the well established square taper standard.
&gt;&gt; there was a report published in one of the euro mags that was posted
&gt;&gt; here on r.b.t and debated some while back.  the big hollow stuff was
&gt;&gt; measurably stiffer.

&gt; Sure, but does that translate into anything that can reliably be
&gt; discerned by actual human beings riding bicycles? It's just possible
&gt; that all the measurements do is to fuel expectation effects and help
&gt; sell the &quot;new technology&quot;.
">

maybe, maybe not.  does it matter?  rec riders want the bling.  for a
pro, what's the percentage difference between the times of 1st &amp; second
places in the tdf?  at the pro level, differences often scoffed at on
r.b.t are very important.  rolling resistance differences between tires
are minimal, yet my "wet" tires are consistently 5 minutes per hour
slower than my "dry" tires, regardless of bike.  average over thousands
of miles.  they "feel" different too.  is it significant?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; On a related note, I find it fascinating that some people are ga-ga
&gt; about the supposed &quot;stiffness&quot; of external bearing BBs while at the
&gt; same time they bury their heads in the sand regarding the very real

">

i don't think a stiffer crank makes me faster, but it definitely feels
better to use.  just like a fast car is nicer to drive, even though it's
no quicker on a speed restricted freeway.  as i said before, i
originally had no expectations so i doubt i was "feeling" what i wanted
to.  and having recently re-tested, again, i'd forgotten what a
difference it made and so had no expectations.  whatever it was feeling
so different, i really doubt it was placebo.

regarding "drag", there's definitely negative expectation there.  people
complain because, at low speeds, i.e. by hand, cartridge bearings have
direct rubber on steel contact which feels stiff.  but does that drag
exist at higher speeds?  i "expect" that there's some hydrodynamic stuff
going on but can't say for sure.  what i have done however is coasting
tests on "draggy" mavic cosmos wheel bearings vs "non-draggy" shimano,
and i see no difference in real world.  for bb's, it's not a function of
the spindle - a square taper cartridge bb is no less "draggy" than a
shimano octalink cartridge bb - i've just opened a couple of new-in-box
bb's and checked them out.

HUH? Trying to rack my brains, but can't think of a single Shimano part
with a roller bearing. Ball bearings yes, and needlebearings too (even
in the DA octalink which you've certainly never seen if you mention
indestructible ;))
I'd say pick one up at your LBS (they are sure to have a pile of rusted
out cartridges) and take one apart. You'll be able to see how Shimano
achieves Superior Stiffness with a stock sized 7/16" axle!

Even tho this was to Andy, gotta mention, that ISIS or Octalink or
even the new 'standard' outboard will NOT significantly
change your power 'transfer'. These answer no question, solve no
problem with regards to square taper. yes, yes, 'studies' have shown
them to be 'stiffer', but that implies square taper was heavy, flexy,
proe to failure, all of which is not true.

Do they "want" it, or are they sold it? IMO, it's the latter; the
mags, etc., are filled with the various stuff about "new!",
"stiffer!", "better!" and other BS that implies that one's extant
square taper BB is woefully inadequate. Now, without question, Shimano
is in the process of walking away from the Octalink "standard". I
wonder how those with perfectly usable Octalink cranks will feel when
they can no longer buy one of those wonderfully stiff Octalink BBs

&gt;&gt;&gt; the axel/spindle seems as

then we have a difference in terminology - a "needle bearing" in this

that's why i said "cartridge" - the 7700 is not cartridge.  it's
slightly less reliable because the seals aren't so hot and it's
susceptible to any misalignment in the bb shell.  but i said that before.

i have several - that's why i said look inside to see the machining.
regarding stiffness, do the math on the large diameter vs smaller

Not an apt analogy. An apt analogy would be if square taper were

deficient in design and abandoned by the company that designed,

Dear Dan,

Where do you feel this difference?

If you're applying the same power in both cases, the "feel" at your
foot should be the same, since it's pushing just as hard in both
cases.

If more of the same power reaches the contact patch because of more
efficient power transmission, you'll go slightly faster. Are you
noticing a measurable speed difference and a distinctly higher cadence
in the same gear?

Cheers,

Carl Fogel

No -- I just spin the pedals backwards, freewheeling the cassette, and
it spins substantially further with my Ultegra BB than with the external
bottom brackets (alhough I haven't tried Campy, just Shimano, FSA, and

Of course, you would be correct if you suggested this may also be due to
the freehub body.

I'm not so without doubt.  The square taper is a high stress interface

bore.

I think I explained that a few times.  Octalink fails for "goofy
footed riders", those who stand with right foot forward while
coasting.  This causes reverse torque on the spindle and because the
Octalink is not a press fit, it rotates... back and forth with each
standing on the pedals (over rough ground, for instance).

The Octalink spines sheared off and the Shimano engineers did not
recognize that it was not for long enough spline teeth that it failed
but because it unscrewed and disengaged the spline to a point where it
WAS too weak and sheared off.  Octalink II got longer spline
engagement that took a little longer to unscrew and shear off.

Now you are testing chain and freewheel lubrication and derailleur

cranks.  Of course this isn't valid either because a new , unridden BB

&gt; Raceface turbine cranks, both square taper and ISIS are down to 50 quid

&gt; I've only ever used standard shimano square taper in the past so my

&gt; The crank brother sale spiel boasts 2 rows of driveside ball bearings for
&gt; there splined bottom brackets; is this standard to all ISIS bottom bracket
&gt; and if not does it realistically make these a better choice than one without

&gt; Lastly, is the ISIS system that much stiffer than all tapered BB's? This one
&gt; for example:

&gt; Thanks for your views.

No comment on which bottom bracket is best.  But the Race Face Turbine
LP does come in the CD bolt circle diameter.  Which is 94mm outer and
middle and 58mm inner.  Standard bolt circle diameter would be 110mm
outer and middle and 74mm inner.  With the 94/58 setup and square
taper bottom bracket you have the ability to make a micro compact
double crankset.  Road bikes mainly of course.  Run 46 or 48 or 50
outer ring and as low as a 30 tooth middle ring.  Don't put on the
third inner ring.  Unlike the 110mm compact setup which limits you to
33 or 34 on the middle ring.  Square taper bottom bracket allows you
to find a short 103mm that will move the two arms into the right
chainline.  Can't do that with Octalink or ISIS bottom brackets
because they don't make them shorter than about 108mm.  I have a bike
with the Race Face Turbine LP crankset with 48 outer and 40 or 36 or
30 middle ring.  No inner ring.  Works great in the mountains with
48-30.  Works great around town with 48-40.  Will work great with
48-36 for hillier non local rides.  Lots of options.

For me, it's more like "install and forget what happened in the few
hours before and after the faceplant I took when my square taper
snapped off".

Square taper spindles, carbon stems and handlebars, Ti pedal spindles,
1" aluminum steer tubes, 28 spoke wheels.  They all have their place,
but my place ain't it.

A big diameter spindle really is better, inasmuch as a bearing failure
is better than a crankarm suddenly parting ways with the bike.
Dramatically improved stiffness is a welcome side benefit.

I machined an outboard BB in 1998 so that I could put a strong
American BB and a strong 22mm spindle in a British-threaded bike frame
that didn't have room for them.  I'm glad to see that the industry has
finally followed my lead, but I think it would be easier if they just
used the damn American shell that represents a much better solution to
the problem anyway.

To be fair, the really floppy square taper spindles didn't appear
until Sh*mano introduced cartridge BBs.

I'll never forget the first cartridge BB bike I ever assembled as a
young bike mechanic in 1992.  I took the bike out for its test ride
and as soon as I stood up on it to pedal hard, I thought it was
broken.  The pedals were diving for cover directly underneath the BB
shell with every pedal stroke.  I babied the thing back to the shop,
and I have never considered owning a cartridge BB since then (and this
was years before I sacrificed my front teeth to a conventional square
taper spindle).

All square taper spindles are floppy compared to tubular spindles, but
square taper cartridge BBs are /really/ floppy.

FWIW, I have one mountain bike and two road bikes, all with lots (thousands)
of Octalink miles.  I coast exclusively "goofy footed", as left foot forward
just feels unnatural to me.  (I'm left handed; right footed.)  Never had a
properly tightened crank loosen, even a little.

BTW, at the risk of sounding thick(er than usual), right foot forward and
left rearward puts pressure on the cranks in the "tightening directions".  I
suppose I can see how that /could/ work to loosen the bolts, but it seems to
me that they'd have to be too loose (on la Trek) in the first place for any
real-world problem; and non-goofy footed coasters would also have issues
(different phenomenon; same result).

Dear Dan,

A quick and easy method of demonstrating the tiny amount of drag in a
typical bottom bracket is to pull the chain off the front sprocket,
level the pedals, and see how many dimes you can stack on a pedal
before it drops:

http://groups.google.com/group/rec.bicycles.tech/msg/ffb74cfbe0ef2f1f

An elderly Shimano cartridge will drop when a third dime is laid on a
pedal, suggesting that there's not likely to be a dime's worth of
difference between it and the finest bottom bracket available.

Cheers,

&gt; dog!

I'm not sure that Shimano is so smart.  Have you seen the changes to the
crank/spindle attachment in the new XTR crank?  I haven't seen it in person,
but from the drawings on the Shimano site, it looks like they dropped the
pinch bolt and went back to the Octalink design for the left side arm.

The exploded view:

The service instructions:

They seem to acknowledging that the fixing bolt unscrews with their note
under step 5 of the installation instructions:
"Note:  The crank arm fixing bolt should be periodically retightened."

It looks like they might be abandoning the pinch bolts in order to add a
bottom bracket bearing pre-load adjustment nut.  I wonder how well the pinch
bolts actually worked?  I remember reading about cranks falling off when the
design first came out, but I assumed that they were cases where people were
forgetting to tighten the pinch bolts.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Dan,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Where do you feel this difference?

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you're applying the same power in both cases, the &quot;feel&quot; at your
&gt;&gt;&gt; foot should be the same, since it's pushing just as hard in both
&gt;&gt;&gt; cases.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If more of the same power reaches the contact patch because of more
&gt;&gt;&gt; efficient power transmission, you'll go slightly faster. Are you
&gt;&gt;&gt; noticing a measurable speed difference and a distinctly higher
&gt;&gt;&gt; cadence in the same gear?

&gt;&gt; No -- I just spin the pedals backwards, freewheeling the cassette,
&gt;&gt; and it spins substantially further with my Ultegra BB than with the
&gt;&gt; external bottom brackets (alhough I haven't tried Campy, just
&gt;&gt; Shimano, FSA, and SRAM).

&gt;&gt; Of course, you would be correct if you suggested this may also be
&gt;&gt; due to the freehub body.

&gt;&gt; Dan

&gt; Dear Dan,

&gt; A quick and easy method of demonstrating the tiny amount of drag in a
&gt; typical bottom bracket is to pull the chain off the front sprocket,
&gt; level the pedals, and see how many dimes you can stack on a pedal
&gt; before it drops:

&gt; http://groups.google.com/group/rec.bicycles.tech/msg/ffb74cfbe0ef2f1f

&gt; An elderly Shimano cartridge will drop when a third dime is laid on a
&gt; pedal, suggesting that there's not likely to be a dime's worth of
&gt; difference between it and the finest bottom bracket available.

&gt; Cheers,

&gt; Carl Fogel

&gt;Cutting sounds like hard work. Pull the seals and the plastic bearing

The cartridge bodies are formed in a way that keeps the balls in each
end captive in their respective orbits around the spindle, so simply
removing the seals won't be enough to free them. The way they get all
this stuff inside the cartridge shell is a design that would impress
even builders of ships in bottles.
