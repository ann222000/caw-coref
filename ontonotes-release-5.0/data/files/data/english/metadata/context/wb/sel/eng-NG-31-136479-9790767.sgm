Thanks for the lighting the path. I still am really interested in your
Yoga Dance class and would like to know more.

Yikes... I hope I have removed my triple post... strange things are
happening  on the Board this AM... I considered Spinning as a student
but am giving myself a morning rest... may report to the gym later for
ride on one of the 2 Spin Bikes in the exercise machine area with
headphones for music...

Deborah: Prayers for you and your friend's family... regretfully I
know what it is like to lose a young son-in-law who was a great Dad in
the prime of his life when he had so much to give the world... and was
selflessly giving... I do recommend that your friends locate
Compassionate Friends -- a wonderful organization that specializes in
helping those in grief...

I am glad to see so much interest in Yoga Dance... this is going to be
a fun project and I think our &quot;Y&quot; members are going to love it --
well, we all know I am prejudiced about loving dance so I will love it
and hopefully my enthusiasm will be contagious... I am as excited
about this project as I was about the team performances that Roseann
and I used to choreograph and do as Spotlight Dances at Jazz
conventions... actually Ash was my first Dance Partner &amp; fellow
choreographer but we lived too far apart to be able to keep the Team
active... maybe Jazz will bring me back for Yoga Dance at a
Convention...

Details: Yoga ancient tradition teaches that Shiva was a great
Dancer... so the concept of YD is not new... in fact you will find
references on G**gle and Shiva Re@ teaches a great form of YD and has
a good video out [Tr@nce D@nce]... my take on YD combines the SR
approach with movement in flowing Yoga postures that begins with
strict choreography starting on the mat to warm up... stationary
postures start slowly and then pick up tempo first with cat/cow then
continues with head low on all 4's &amp; hips circle right and left slowly
at first and then faster...  and then adds standing movement such as
pliès angling forward and then back to complete warm up... then
progresses to swaying side to side... as rhythms pick up begin
drumming on imaginary drums with hands high.. low and to each side...
then with arms extended and/or overhead  striking the drums with
elbows &amp; hips [singles &amp; doubles] and striking the drums with knees
[singles and doubles]... moving to a more freestyle form lifting each
foot separately twice in rhythm pointing the sole of the foot to the
inner side of the lower leg and adding turns and sways and circling...
eventually slowing down and cooling down by slowing movements...
coming back to traditional flowing postures on the mat and ending with
stretching and meditation first in Child's position extended and then
prone on the tummy with hands extended  above the head... palms
together as at the start... there is more but the above is most of
what the first class will have... the Music is sitar and drums and
flutes and chants designed for dance sequence... and dance rhythms...
This gives you the flavor -- sorry I have far exceeded my Page
Limit... Blessings...

Let's all go on a road trip to take Jimmy's YD class!!  That sounds
like a lot of fun Jimmy, good luck with it.

Deborah, I'm so sorry for your friends' losses..what a hard time for
them/you, you will all be in my prayers.

Off to clean, then maybe hit the beach for a few.

Have a good weekend everyone.

The morning began well.  I had time to eat blueberry pancakes, check
email and MT, and get our water bottles filled for our 112 mile ride
through the Napa and Pope Valleys.  We noticed the difference in
attitude between doing a fully supported century and a ride like ours,
where there's no monetary commitment and no friends to keep us focused
on the fun ahead.  A self-supported ride requires even more focus,
since you have to have plenty of food &amp; drink as well as money, and
you have to know where the bathrooms are along the way.

So we got off a little before 8, the breeze was light, the morning
cool and crisp.  The sun didn't take away the bit of chill so we
pedaled faster to warm up more. First time since April that I wore my
long tights and jacket.

We were riding through an older neighborhood, about 2 mi. from home,
when the Flat Fairy paid us a visit.  A goat head stabbed the tire.
And we rode on it, flat, just enough to gouge the sidewalls. So while
Chris was pumping up the new tube I had a look at the back tire...and
there was a gash in it.   We played cautious and rode back home to
take the tires off the wheels.  Got new, more durable tires, put them
on, and decided to visit the other bike shop to see if we could get a
couple small issues squared away.  An hour later we came back home,
tandemless, as the small issues were secondary to a couple larger
issues.  Boo. So there's no joy in Tandemville today.

That light breeze is now a steady 10 mph wind with gusts to 20.  We
may go out on our 1/2 bikes later, although I prefer the wind to die
down first.

Hope everyone else is having a fun Saturday!

Deborah: sorry to hear of tire problems and other repair issues... but
then you guys are high mileage riders... the &quot;self-supported ride&quot; is
a bear... need organization and thought for it and in these parts it's
hard to find safe roads for a Century Ride without it being a big
event with traffic controls...

Had my 'Phants meeting at noon today -- had the ladies with us since I
gave my report on France... I took in my 3 X 5 French Flag as one of
my props -- it was an eye catcher... whoops just remembered I need to
take in the Union Jack and US Fort McHenry Flag [15 stripes &amp; 15
stars] that have been flying today... everyone enjoyed the Report on
France... a couple of them had been there... lots of people have
passed on since I was last there... everyone was in Good Spirits...
Over &amp; Out...

We leave early enough that we miss the boat traffic on the way to or
from the lake...Napa has a couple of intersections that can be dicey
but we're okay with that.  We're nothing if not cautious.

We got the repair issues worked out and the bike mechanic (commonly
called a wrench) didn't charge us a dime.  I bought a sleeveless
jersey (closeout), a pair of arm warmers and socks, so I think we're
even.  Then we had a monster climb and a fast ride -- we salvaged some
kind of ride out of the day.

Sounds like you had a nice afternoon with the 'Phants, Jimmy.  That's
so neat that you still visit them.  What a bright spot in their day
you must be.

Busy day here, today. Started with me teaching a class. Haven't taught
a regular class in two weeks. I felt strange to say the least. I hope
it was ok for the students.

Came home and freshened up. My new boss stopped over with laptop and
sign bag and gave me a quick lesson on installing and finding memory
sticks on the laptop and how to bolt the laptop to a secure fixture in
the room, how to hook up the wireless mouse/laser pointer, etc.

Then onto our 5 hour meeting. Jazzercise meeting. It was really very
good-I like some of the new concepts. Afterwards, I went and made
reservations for a group of 4 to eat, but it was too busy for me to
stay so they went down to group of 3 peeps. I had to get to the
nursing home. Arrived in time for visit with one of my favorite
brothers (all my brothers are spectacular so it could have been anyone
of them) and my Mom was in excellent spirits. She is just back to
being her old self. I really can't believe it. Now, we need to press
on and get her moved onto the floor she should have been on in the
first place. Mind you, the nurses on this floor love her, since she is
one of the few that they can converse with, but she has no other
residents on this floor that can carry on a conversation, so she
really needs to be moved down.
