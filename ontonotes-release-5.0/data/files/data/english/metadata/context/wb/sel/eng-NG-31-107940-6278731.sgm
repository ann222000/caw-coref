Regarding MX, the wannabe pain in the lower back.

He's actually, by my measure at least, a sad case. There's obvously
some intelligence there but by his own admission he earns a bit over
$100 a week.

He has endured a one hour gate hold at Logan -- while simulating a
flight!

He carefully programs the flight plan into his computer, probably does
a simulated taxi out, then lets the computer simulator's autopilot fly
most of the flight. That may mean he sits in front of his computer,
feet on simulated rudder controls, with a play stick or a yoke, I'm not
sure which, and watches the simulator fly itself.

I think most of us who are pilots are successful in other aspects of
our lives too. I would guess many of us are managers, and of those, a
number had told smart people who wear their Mensa memberships like a
badge of honor that their services are no longer required because, in
reality, they were too difficult to work with. He is, I think, in that
class.

I do hope he finds a measure of happiness in his chair (does he wear a
shoulder harness?) playing his simulated games, but it's not a life I
would choose for anyone I cared about.

So let him have some fun. One need not make replies made to his posts
except perhaps when his 'logical' assertions are in conflict with safe
flying. He has, we can assume, never touched the toe brakes to stop the
wheels rotating before retracting them, never saw a runway appear 20
degrees off the nose at MDA, or ice growing on the wing, or requested
ATC permission to fly at 7200 feet with minor deviations in the course
so he could play in the canyons in the clouds.

Do you remember what it's like to tell a non-flyer what general
avaition is all about, and some of the experiences you had? Think of
that when you read his posts, and feel sadness rather than anger. He
probably can't help himself.

And, really, take this attitude. "Mx, your comments are no longer
needed here," and respond only if you think he's making unsafe
suggestions. The response is NOT directed at him, but at newer pilots
who might be reading the thread. After all, MX is sometimes 'logical'
even when he's wrong, and we don't want newbies. or ourselves, to be
misled.

Gee, that's almost a rant, isn't it?

1. I empathize. This has been an issue almost from the beginning of USENET.

2. Your posting (and my response) only adds to the "spam" you're complaining
about.

3. "Any thread with any posting from XXX" could eliminate a lot of good
information. :)  It's best to simply ignore posters you find offensive.

4. I recommend using a traditional newsreader and subscribing to a USENET
provider (some are even free). This option will allow you to filter out
posts based on sender, subject, content, etc. and could lead to a higher
quality USENET experience. Google has done a good thing by archiving almost
all USENET articles, but they are doing all of us a disservice by not
allowing a quality newsreader experience (even a browser-based one).

Does anyone know of an addin for Outlook Express 6 that will let me select
message text as the bassi of a rule?

Right now, anything *from* mxsmanic is blocked, and I can block anything
with mxmanic in the subject. I'd like to block all of the responses (message
contains 'mxsmanic'), and be free of this loser once and for all.

I realize that I should use a better newsreader, however this is what I'm

Save yourself the trouble. I use Outlook Express 6.0 myself and have
absolutely no problem whatsoever with avoiding people I don't want to deal
with. I just scroll right on past them and go on to something else. This
works instantly for all situations as the unwanted poster's heading stands
out like a sore thumb and is extremely easy to avoid.
Saves the trouble of setting up kill files. filters, whatnot.
Works like a charm too :-)))))))))

I would be one of them. I find the postings pleading for people to ignore Mx
even more annoying than he is. I particularly object to people who advocate
mistreating him.

If you don't like his posts, don't read them. I don't read them because he is
too argumentative, a characteristic he shares with many of his detractors.

and spend a quiet evening. The wives can compare notes about living with old

Outlook Express does not appear to support a text search withing messages as
part of a message rule.

If you really feel compelled, you can type most of the header into a message
rule as a way to delete any further entries to a thread--since OE won't let
you just copy and past the headers.  But that will also discard the good,
bad, and ugly together.

About the most that you can do, that is productive, is to do as Dudley
suggested--and if an entire thread has become insufferable, you can
right-click any header and "mark the conversation as read".

Really the biggest thing you can do is simply to think for most of a minute
about whether any further response is *really* needed--because it does not
take long to glance at a post, or even read it, but composing a reasonable
response is a real time consumer.  I did not think much about it until
someone posted a list of the top ten contributors for most of December, and
I saw my name on it.  I then did my own research, and I am sure he was
wrong; but it was clear that I was spending *way* too much time--so I have
cut back and will cut back much further--and I will especially refrain from
challenges that demand a rebuttal, since they are guaranteed to double the
time spent.

All of that is a really long winded way of saying that it takes a lot of
time to compose a message, even without finding and correcting all of the
typos, and that if just a few people budget the time they spend, the group
will probably become much more readable.

He is obviously lonely and a social outcast. He posts so frequently he
probably rarely enjoys any face to face interactions with people. He spends
so much time on the computer  he probably doesn't have much of a life other
than cyberworld.

Yet, his confrontational and argumentative responses get him the attention
he seeks in his own personal life, all of which is pretty sad.

Unfortunately, most of the people who participate in this NG enjoy flying as
an avocation. It is supposed to be fun and enjoyable, and much of this is
taken away when someone argues simply for the sake of getting attention for
themselves. A brief look at his website makes it obvious that he only refers
to himself, and that all of his focus is inward. He's so self absorbed it's
no wonder he alienates people and doesn't understand why. He simply isn't
capable of looking at himself as the root cause of his own problems.

&gt; Yet, his confrontational and argumentative responses get him the attention
&gt; he seeks in his own personal life, all of which is pretty sad.

&gt; Unfortunately, most of the people who participate in this NG enjoy flying

&gt; simply isn't capable of looking at himself as the root cause of his own

Little is resolved in his threads.  I read those on trimming (w&amp;b) and
leaning, unfortunately.  Mind-bending from a bent mind.  Futile
non-resolutions ad infinitum.  And if he is then so must be his
critics, sadly.

Your use of the word 'undesirable' wrt Mxsmanic (or just his posts),
and putting it between the opposing views forces me to believe you
didn't really mean it.  Or undesirable is what you like.  Or its what
you and a few others demand us to accept.  What is your ulterior
motive?  Frustrated aviators?  Anarchy?  Always a few of those around.
That is not acceptable.  Acceptibility must not be universal.

Seemingly, (and if so then cowardly), you defend him from angry words
from those who likley would do him no harm.  You defend one who serves
no useful purpose to this world.  You defend one who has, and quite
stubbornly (with a certain amount of talent), managed to drag a number
of professionals into his own dark world they are not trained to deal
with.

Some just like to argue, so they have Mxsmanic.  Some like to watch
others argue, so they have him &amp; this news group.  The rest of us get
little use out of that parasitic relationship, which only serves to
realize the simulator to Mxsmanic, when what he really needs is to get
out and deal with the real world, or be put away by it.  It is queer,
psychotic.  It isn't difficult to see that the mismated thing should
be avoided, or more.

His plea is complaint, and with others it is an irritant.  Irritants
are not necessarily without value, or 'delusional'.  And your
overstated reply iis also intended an irritant, though in the opposite
direction; against those most would say are quite sane, as of this
moment.

Yours worries me.

Realistic?  Psychosis are real.  Pleading with them is likely
pathetic.  But removing them is a reasonable goal.  It is the one
having most realistic chances of success -- unless 'the law' makes it
'unrealistic'.

He is pleading for 'the law', (whatever that might be), to remove the
disturbance.  You consider that delusional and pathetic.  So, what?
You defend the disturbance in apparent hate of 'the law'.  That is

His threads exercise the mind, forcing it to run in circles,
eventually wearing paths too easily found again.  I prefer my paths
more disciplined.  The concepts gained are more appreciated, a method
of learning becomes a sought-after discipline.  It affects my view of
the world, and my neighbors.

Msxmanic's preoccupation with a 'default' trim setting found nothing.
Nothing was expected.  After study, my conclusion is that he actually
knew that all along, but enjoyed the game with those he knows have
almost no choice but to attempt to teach.  If he didn't know it, then
the demon that posseses him does.  The value added by instruction,
(the 'food' as one poster called it), becomes bait into a trap.

Generally, the group's attempt is to overwhelm the thread with a valid
perspective.  But Msxmanic is very persistent, refusing to let go of
the 'spolight'.

I guess I'm not being clear.  I am not saying the request in the OP is,
or is not worthy.  In fact, I'm explicitly avoiding that.

Let me put it this way.  Suppose you were with a group of people all
doing something you wanted to do, and then some one you don't even know
walks up and says, "hey stop doing that".  Are you going to stop doing
something you want to just because someone you don't even know asks you
to.  I know most people wouldn't.

In other words no one in this or any other news group is going to stop
doing something just because some asks them to.  If there are posts you
don't like, them simply don't read them.  There is nothing you can do to
stop them.  If you think you can . . .

The issue -- I was going to say 'problem' but if it is, it's of our own
making --- with MX is it's like watching a car crash. You know what's
going to happen, you're just not sure when or where, but somewhere in
many of his threads will be a well written but really misinformed
remark or statement.

There are enough readers to at least offer information that's more
correct, and  that may help the ignorant bystander.

But man, watching him twitch at the end of the of the rope he tied
around his own neck is almost a compelling sight.

Think of it, really. He often posts in the middle of his night, maybe
strapped and harnessed into his simulator chair, bored because his
simulated airplane is flying in the enroute structure on a simulated
auto pilot, and he's composing messages to the various news groups.

Watching what happens,and occasionly pulling on his rip cord is part of
the fun -- don't take it seriously. We have real lives, do real things,
fly real airplanes. We know, both in our minds and our hearts, what he
has never experienced. Even more telling, he often dismisses our
experience as unimportant.

He's never been there, never done that, and doesn't have the tee shirt,
either.

Gotta admit, MX has generated more newsgroup traffic of anyone other
than Sam Spade.

The signal to noise ratio is rather high for responses to his posts.

Let the finest social-misfit of these groups throw the first stone.

But to suggest we put a muzzle on some poster? That's just utter BS and
contrary to purpose of a public forum.
