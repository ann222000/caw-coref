It has been evident from day one, that this 911 operation was a Zionist
plot, because of the obvious Â setting the stage to make it look like an Arab
operation. Most especially obvious was the finding of Mohammed Atta's
passport, laying on a NY street complete with the credit card slips stil in
it. There is no way that this could have got there, unless it was placed
there by someone.

&gt;&gt; His Troops Stole Arab Identites While Mossad Agents In Hollywood,
&gt;&gt; Florida Assassinated Mohammed Atta And Framed Him For The Crime

&gt;&gt; [Editor's note: This is part of one of the most intriguing pamphlets
&gt;&gt; on 9-11 I have ever seen published. I have been unable to find any
&gt;&gt; other copies of it available on the internet. It hasn't gotten
&gt;&gt; circulation because its publisher (author is unknown) was arrested on
&gt;&gt; trumped up charges soon after it hit the press, and that publisher has
&gt;&gt; been held in solitary confinement while these pamphlets have been
&gt;&gt; languishing without a distributor. Here is the first lengthy excerpt ...
&gt;&gt; I hope to excerpt more. This starts with the dancing Zionists, which
&gt;&gt; is well known, and then goes deeper than any other investigation I
&gt;&gt; have seen into this topic. -- Amir Ali]

&gt;&gt; THE DANCING ISRAELIS

&gt;&gt; Like most Americans, I was gripped by senses of profound shock,
&gt;&gt; horror, revulsion, sadness and rage as I watched the horror of
&gt;&gt; September 11, 2001, unfolding live on my television screen. Watching
&gt;&gt; the mass murder of thousands of innocent people live on television was
&gt;&gt; the most upsetting experience of my life. ...

&gt;&gt; But not all of the eye-witnesses to the 9-11 slaughter were so
&gt;&gt; saddened. On September 11, five Israeli army veterans were arrested by
&gt;&gt; the FBI after several witnesses saw them &quot;dancing&quot;, &quot;high-fiving&quot; and
&gt;&gt; &quot;celebrating&quot; as they took pictures of the World Trade Center disaster
&gt;&gt; from across the river in New Jersey. ...

&gt;&gt; When the photos [taken by the dancing Israelis] were developed, they
&gt;&gt; revealed that the dancing Israelis were smiling in the foreground of
&gt;&gt; the New York massacre. According to ABC's 20/20 attempted whitewash of
&gt;&gt; the incident, in addition to their outrageous and highly suspicious
&gt;&gt; behavior, the five also has in their possession the following items:
&gt;&gt; box-cutters, European passports, and $4700 in cash hidden in a sock.
&gt;&gt; Why were these Israeli agents so happy about the horrible massacre
&gt;&gt; unfolding before their very eyes? ... Could it be that these happy
&gt;&gt; Israeli army veterans were in some way linked to this monstrous
&gt;&gt; attack? That's what officials close to the investigation told the
&gt;&gt; Bergen Record newspaper of New Jersey. ...

&gt;&gt; THE SEPTEMBER 11 DANCE PARTY
&gt;&gt; ... Having established [that Israelis and Jews have committed acts of
&gt;&gt; terror against Americans in the past], we can now easily deduce the
&gt;&gt; reason why those five dancing Israeli agents who celebrated the 9-11
&gt;&gt; attacks were so happy is because they knew that Americans would now
&gt;&gt; become unconditional supporters of their &quot;Israeli ally&quot; and fanatical
&gt;&gt; haters of Muslims and Arabs. On the day of the attacks, former Israeli
&gt;&gt; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu was asked what the attack would mean
&gt;&gt; for US-Israeli relations. His quick reply was &quot;It's very good ... Well,
&gt;&gt; it's not good, but it will generate immediate sympathy (for Israel)&quot;

&gt;&gt; The five Israelis made such a spectacle that everyone who saw them
&gt;&gt; felt compelled to call the police. According to ABC's 20/20, when the
&gt;&gt; van belonging to the cheering Israelis was stopped by the police, the
&gt;&gt; first word out of the driver's (Sivan Kurzberg's) lying mouth were:
&gt;&gt; &quot;We are Israelis. We are not your problem. Your problems are our
&gt;&gt; problems. The Palestinians are your problem.&quot; The police and FBI field
&gt;&gt; agents became really suspicious when they found box cutters (the same
&gt;&gt; items the hijacker supposedly used), $4700 cash stuffed in a sock, and
&gt;&gt; foreign passports. Police also told the Bergen Record that bomb
&gt;&gt; sniffing dogs were brought to the van and that they reacted as if they
&gt;&gt; had smelled explosives.

&gt;&gt; From there, the story gets even more suspicious. The Israelis worked
&gt;&gt; for a Weehawken moving company known as Urban Moving Systems. An
&gt;&gt; American employee of Urban Moving Systems told the Bergen Record that
&gt;&gt; a majority of his co- workers were Israelis and they were all joking
&gt;&gt; about the attacks. The employee, who declined to give his name, said
&gt;&gt; &quot;I was in tears. These guys were joking and that bothered me.&quot;

&gt;&gt; A few days after the attacks, Urban Moving System's Israeli owner,
&gt;&gt; Dominick Suter, dropped his business and fled the country. He was in
&gt;&gt; such a hurry to flee America that some of Urban Moving System's
&gt;&gt; customers were left with their furniture stuck in storage facilities.
&gt;&gt; The five Israeli army veterans (Mossad) were held in custody for
&gt;&gt; several months before being quietly released. Some of the movers had
&gt;&gt; been kept in solitary confinement for 40 days.

&gt;&gt; Immediately following the attacks, the Zionist controlled media was
&gt;&gt; filled with stories linking the attacks to Bin Laden. TV talking-heads
&gt;&gt; and scribblers of every stripe spoon-fed a gullible American public a
&gt;&gt; steady diet of the most outrageous propaganda imaginable. We were told
&gt;&gt; that the reason bin Laden attacked the USA was because he hates our
&gt;&gt; &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot;. The Muslims were &quot;medieval&quot; and they wanted
&gt;&gt; to destroy us because of our wealth. But Bin Laden strongly denied any
&gt;&gt; role in the attacks and suggested that Zionists orchestrated the 9-11
&gt;&gt; attacks:

&gt;&gt; &quot;I was not involved in the September 11 attacks in the United States
&gt;&gt; nor did I have knowledge of the attacks. There exists a government
&gt;&gt; within a government within the United States. The United States should
&gt;&gt; try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself; to the
&gt;&gt; people who want to make the present century a century of conflict
&gt;&gt; between Islam and Christianity. That secret government must be asked
&gt;&gt; as to who carried out the attacks ... The American system is totally in
&gt;&gt; control of the Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United
&gt;&gt; States.&quot;

&gt;&gt; To date, the only shred of &quot;evidence&quot; to be uncovered against Bin
&gt;&gt; Laden was a highly suspicious, barely audible amateur video, that the
&gt;&gt; Zionist dominated Pentagon just happened to find &quot;lying around&quot; in
&gt;&gt; Afghanistan. Though there is no evidence, be it hard or
&gt;&gt; circumstantial, to link the Al Qaeda &quot;terrorist network&quot; to these acts
&gt;&gt; of terror; there is in fact a mountain of evidence, both hard and
&gt;&gt; circumstantial, which suggests that the Zionists have been very busy
&gt;&gt; framing Arabs for terror plots against America.

&gt;&gt; WHO WAS REALLY FLYING THOSE PLANES ON 9-11?
&gt;&gt; Hours after the 9-11 attacks, authorities began to find clues
&gt;&gt; conveniently left for them to stumble upon. The Boston Globe reported
&gt;&gt; that a copy of the Koran, instructions on how to fly a commercial
&gt;&gt; airplane, and a fuel consumption calculator were found in a pair of
&gt;&gt; bags meant for one of the hijacked flights that left from Logan.

&gt;&gt; Authorities also received a &quot;tip&quot; about a suspicious white car left
&gt;&gt; behind at Boston's Logan Airport. An Arabic-language flight training
&gt;&gt; manual was found inside the car.

&gt;&gt; How fortunate for investigators that the hijackers &quot;forgot&quot; to take
&gt;&gt; their Koran and Arab flight manuals with them! Within a few days, all
&gt;&gt; &quot;19 hijackers&quot; were &quot;identified&quot; and their faces were plastered all
&gt;&gt; over our television screens.

&gt;&gt; Then, like a script from a corny &quot;B&quot; spy movie, the officials story
&gt;&gt; gets even more ridiculous. The passport of the supposed &quot;ringleader&quot;
&gt;&gt; Mohammed Atta, somehow managed to survive the explosion, inferno, and
&gt;&gt; smoldering collapse to be oh-so-conveniently &quot;found&quot; just a few blocks
&gt;&gt; away from the World Trade Center.

&gt;&gt; It is obvious that this &quot;evidence&quot; was planted by individuals wishing
&gt;&gt; to direct the blame towards Osama bin Laden. How is it possible that
&gt;&gt; Arab students who has never flown an airplane could take a simulator
&gt;&gt; course and then fly jumbo jets with the skill and precision of
&gt;&gt; &quot;top-gun&quot; pilots? It is not possible and the fact is, the true
&gt;&gt; identities of the 9-11 hijackers remain a mystery. In the fays
&gt;&gt; following the disclosure of the &quot;hijackers&quot; names and faces, no less
&gt;&gt; than 7 of the Arab individuals named came forward to protest their
&gt;&gt; obvious innocence.

&gt;&gt; That's right! Seven of the nineteen &quot;hijackers&quot; are alive and well.
&gt;&gt; They were victims of identity theft, some of whom had their passports
&gt;&gt; stolen. They were interviewed by several different news organizations,
&gt;&gt; including the Telegraph of England. Here's an excerpt from David
&gt;&gt; Harrison's Telegraph story entitled:

&gt;&gt; &quot;Revealed: The Men With Stolen Identities

&gt;&gt; &quot;Their names were flashed around the world as suicide hijackers who
&gt;&gt; carried out the attacks on America. But yesterday four innocent men
&gt;&gt; told how their identities had been stolen.

&gt;&gt; &quot;The men, all from Saudi Arabia - spoke of their shock at being
&gt;&gt; mistakenly named by the FBI as suicide terrorists. None of the four
&gt;&gt; was in the United States on September 11 and all are alive in their
&gt;&gt; home country.

&gt;&gt; &quot;The Telegraph obtained the first interviews with the men since they
&gt;&gt; learnt that they were on the FBI's list of hijackers who died in the
&gt;&gt; crashes in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.

&gt;&gt; &quot;All four said they were outraged to be identified as terrorists. One
&gt;&gt; has never been to America and another is a Saudi Airlines pilot who
&gt;&gt; was on a training course in Tunisia at the time of the attacks. Saudi
&gt;&gt; Airlines said it was considering legal action against the FBI for
&gt;&gt; serious damaging its reputation and that of its pilots.&quot;

&gt;&gt; The story of these identity thefts was also briefly reported by ABC
&gt;&gt; and BBC (England). The FBI does not deny this. Nobody denies the fact
&gt;&gt; because it is easily verifiable. Instead, the US media and government
&gt;&gt; just ignore this inconvenient little fact and keep right on repeating
&gt;&gt; the monstrous lie that the hijacker identities are known and that 15
&gt;&gt; of them were Saudis.

&gt;&gt; CNN revealed that FBI director Robert Mueller openly admitted that
&gt;&gt; some of the identities of the 9-11 hijackers are in question due to
&gt;&gt; identity theft. Here's what CNN reported on September 21:

&gt;&gt; FBI Director Robert Mueller has acknowledged that some of those behind
&gt;&gt; last week's terror attacks may have stolen the identification of other
&gt;&gt; people, and, according to at least one security expert, it may have
&gt;&gt; been &quot;relatively easy&quot; based on their level of sophistication.

&gt;&gt; This opens up a whole Pandora's box of unanswered questions. First and
&gt;&gt; foremost of which is this: why would Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi
&gt;&gt; Arabian &quot;cave man&quot;, attempting to cover his tracks, steal the
&gt;&gt; identities of ... fellow Saudi Arabians??? What would be the point? Why
&gt;&gt; go through the trouble of stealing identities that would point back to
&gt;&gt; you. Why not steal Greek identities, or Brazilian identities, or
&gt;&gt; Turkish ones? A much more logical conclusion is that non-Arabs stole
&gt;&gt; these identities as part of a &quot;false flag&quot; operation designed to point
&gt;&gt; the blame at Arabs, and Saudi Arabia in particular.

&gt;&gt; What kind of a character is FBI boss Mueller? He initially admitted
&gt;&gt; that false identities were involved with 9-11, but then he allows the
&gt;&gt; media to keep naming these innocent, and alive, Arabs as the
&gt;&gt; hijackers? Why doesn't he correct them? ...

&gt;&gt; Now I'm really going to rock your faith in the false religion of 9-11.
&gt;&gt; In February of 2000, Indian intelligence officials detained 11 members
&gt;&gt; of what they thought was an Al Qaeda hijacking conspiracy. It was then
&gt;&gt; discovered that these 11 &quot;Muslim preachers&quot; were all Israeli
&gt;&gt; nationals! India's leading weekly magazine, The Week, reported:

&gt;&gt; &quot;On January 12, Indian intelligence officials in Calcutta detained 11
&gt;&gt; foreign nationals for interrogation before they were to board a
&gt;&gt; Dhaka-bound Bangladesh Biman flight. They were detained on suspicion
&gt;&gt; of being hijackers. 'But we realized they were tabliqis, so we let
&gt;&gt; them go' said an intelligence official.

&gt;&gt; &quot;The eleven has Israeli passports but were believed to be Afghan
&gt;&gt; nationals who had spent a while in Iran. Indian intelligence
&gt;&gt; officials, too, were surprised by the nationality profile of the
&gt;&gt; eleven. 'They say they have been on tabligh in Indian for two months.
&gt;&gt; But they are Israeli nationals from the West Bank,' said a Central
&gt;&gt; Intelligence official. He claimed that Tel Aviv 'exerted considerable
&gt;&gt; pressure' on Delhi to secure their release. 'It appeared that they
&gt;&gt; could be working for a sensitive organization in Israel and were on a
&gt;&gt; mission to Bangladesh,' the official said.

&gt;&gt; What were these 11 Israeli nationals doing trying to impersonate Al
&gt;&gt; Qaeda men? Infiltrating? Perhaps. Framing? More likely. But the
&gt;&gt; important precedent to understand is this: Israeli agents were once
&gt;&gt; caught red handed impersonating Muslim hijackers!

&gt;&gt; This event becomes even more mind boggling when we learn that it was
&gt;&gt; Indian Intelligence that helped the US to so quickly identify the &quot;19
&gt;&gt; hijackers&quot;! On April 3, 2002, Express India, quoting the Press Trust
&gt;&gt; of India, revealed:

&gt;&gt; &quot;Washington, April 3: Indian intelligence agencies helped the US to
&gt;&gt; identify the hijackers who carried out the deadly September 11
&gt;&gt; terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, a media report said here
&gt;&gt; Wednesday.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Did you catch that? The Indian intelligence officials who were duped
&gt;&gt; into mistaking Israeli agents for Al Qaeda back in 2000, were the very
&gt;&gt; same clowns telling the FBI who it was that hijacked the 9-11 planes!
&gt;&gt; Keep in mind that Indian intelligence has an extremely close working
&gt;&gt; relationship with Israel's Mossad because both governments hate the
&gt;&gt; Muslim nation of Pakistan.

&gt;&gt; Now about Mohamed Atta ... the so-called &quot;ring leader&quot;. There are a
&gt;&gt; number of inconsistencies with that story as well. Like some of the 7
&gt;&gt; hijackers known to be still alive, Atta also had his passport stolen
&gt;&gt; in 1999, (perhaps the same passport that miraculously survived the WTC
&gt;&gt; explosion and collapse?), making him an easy mark for identity theft.
&gt;&gt; Atta was known to all as a shy, timid and sheltered young man who was
&gt;&gt; uncomfortable with women. The 5 foot 7 inch, 150 pound architecture
&gt;&gt; student was such a &quot;goody two shoes&quot; that some of his university
&gt;&gt; acquaintances in Germany refrained from drinking or cursing in front
&gt;&gt; of him. How this gentle, non-political momma's boy from a good
&gt;&gt; Egyptian family suddenly transformed himself into the vodka drinking,
&gt;&gt; go-go girl groping terrorist animal described by the media, has to
&gt;&gt; rank as the greatest personality change since another classic work of
&gt;&gt; fiction, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.

&gt;&gt; Atta, or someone using Atta's identity, had enrolled in a Florida
&gt;&gt; flight school in 2001 and then broke off training, making it a point
&gt;&gt; to tell his instructor he was leaving for Boston, In an October 2001
&gt;&gt; interview with an ABC affiliate in Florida, flight school president
&gt;&gt; Rudi Dekkers said that his course does not qualify pilots to fly jumbo
&gt;&gt; jets. He also described Atta as &quot;an asshole&quot; Part of the reason for
&gt;&gt; Dekker's dislike for Atta stems from a highly unusual incident that
&gt;&gt; occurred at the beginning of the course. Here's the exchange between
&gt;&gt; ABC producer Quentin McDermott and Dekkers:

&gt;&gt; MCDERMOTT: &quot;Why do you say Atta was an asshole?&quot;

&gt;&gt; DEKKERS: &quot;Well, when Atta was here and I saw his face on several
&gt;&gt; occasions in the building, then I know that they're regular students
&gt;&gt; and then I try to talk to them, it's a kind of PR - where are you
&gt;&gt; from? I tried to communicate with him. I found out from my people that
&gt;&gt; he lived in Hamburg and he spoke German so one of the days that I saw
&gt;&gt; him, I speak German myself, I'm a Dutch citizen, and I started in the
&gt;&gt; morning telling him in German, &quot;Good morning. How are you? How do you
&gt;&gt; like the coffee? Are you happy here?&quot;, and he looked at me with cold
&gt;&gt; eyes, didn't react at all and walked away. That was one of my first
&gt;&gt; meetings I had.&quot;

&gt;&gt; That is easily similar to the way in which Zacharias Moussaoui (the
&gt;&gt; so- called &quot;20th hijacker&quot;) became &quot;belligerent&quot; when his Minnesota
&gt;&gt; flight instructor tried to speak to him in French (his first language)
&gt;&gt; at the beginning of that course. The Minnesota Star Tribune reported
&gt;&gt; on December 21, 2001:

&gt;&gt; &quot;Moussaoui first raised eyebrows when, during a simple introductory
&gt;&gt; exchange, he said he was from France, but then didn't seem to
&gt;&gt; understand when the instructor spoke French to him. Moussaoui then
&gt;&gt; became belligerent and evasive about his background, Congressman
&gt;&gt; Oberstar and other sources said. In addition, he seemed inept at basic
&gt;&gt; flying procedures, while seeking expensive training on an advanced
&gt;&gt; commercial jet simulator.&quot;

&gt;&gt; It truly is an amazing twist of fate that both Atta and Moussaoui had
&gt;&gt; American flight instructors who spoke German and French respectively.
&gt;&gt; Even the great Mossad could not have foreseen such a coincidence! The
&gt;&gt; real Atta would have been able to respond to his instructor's German
&gt;&gt; small talk and the real Moussaoui would have been able to respond to
&gt;&gt; his instructor's French small talk. Atta just walked away and
&gt;&gt; Moussaoui threw a fit! Neither responded because neither could. They
&gt;&gt; were impostors, whose faces were probably disguised by a make up
&gt;&gt; artist. Their mission was to frame the two innocent Arabs who were
&gt;&gt; probably targeted by the Mossad at random.

&gt;&gt; The imposter was able to create a new Atta by using Atta's stolen
&gt;&gt; passport from 1999 - the same passport that floated safely to the
&gt;&gt; ground with a few burnt edges on 9-11. These strange inconsistencies
&gt;&gt; tend to give support to Mohammed Atta's father's claim that he spoke
&gt;&gt; over the phone with his son on September 12th, the day after the
&gt;&gt; attacks. Could a group of professionals have abducted and killed the
&gt;&gt; real Atta in the days following the 9-11 attacks? Mossad agents,
&gt;&gt; posing as &quot;art students&quot; were arrested after conducting some kind of
&gt;&gt; operation in Hollywood, Florida, the same town that Atta stayed in! So
&gt;&gt; what happened to the real Mohammed Atta? To quote his grief stricken
&gt;&gt; father: &quot;Ask Mossad!&quot;

&gt;&gt; So who, if not the &quot;19 Arabs&quot; was on those planes? That's the million
&gt;&gt; dollar question! There are a number of alternative scenarios. Could
&gt;&gt; some Israelis have been fanatical enough to have volunteered for such
&gt;&gt; a suicide mission? Odd as that may sound at first, it is not out of
&gt;&gt; the realm of possibility. The fact is, hard-core Zionist extremists
&gt;&gt; have proven themselves to every bit as fanatical (and more so) than
&gt;&gt; Arab extremists.

&gt;&gt; A nation which can produce thousands of bloodthirsty Zionist
&gt;&gt; extremists, Irgun war criminals, Mossad terrorists who blow up
&gt;&gt; occupied buildings, assassins who kill Israeli Prime Ministers in full
&gt;&gt; view of policemen, and crazed killers who have conducted sickening
&gt;&gt; massacres of Arab women and children, would surely be capable of
&gt;&gt; recruiting a few fanatics willing to sacrifice for &quot;the cause.&quot; The
&gt;&gt; theory becomes even more plausible when we consider that only the
&gt;&gt; pilots would have needed to know that the planes were on a suicide
&gt;&gt; mission. ...

&gt;&gt; One has to wonder if some of [Baruch] Goldstein's admirers were flying
&gt;&gt; those planes on 9-11. There is one interesting side note here which
&gt;&gt; may or may not be of any significance. One of the two Israelis who
&gt;&gt; died aboard the hijacked planes was Daniel Lewin - who was aboard the
&gt;&gt; first plane to crash into the Twin Towers. The Ha'aretz News Service
&gt;&gt; of Israel revealed that Lewin was a one time officer in the Israeli
&gt;&gt; Defense Forces Sayaret Matkal commando unit. Oddly enough, Lewin's
&gt;&gt; name is missing from CNN's comprehensive September 11 Memorial
&gt;&gt; website. ...
