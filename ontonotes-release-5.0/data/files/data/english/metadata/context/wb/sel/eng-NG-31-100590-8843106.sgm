Today I was across the street at the local bookstore and found that
Aerie is finally on the shelves...

Price is $7.99US or $10.99 Canadian... but the Canadian dollar is now
worth $1.024+ US so the price for the book should be LESS than $7.99
if the prices were to be equal.

The bookstore has a sign up by the cash register explaining that the
prices are set by the book publishers weeks in advance of the book
actually arriving on the shelves so there will be some disparity, but
the difference in value of the currencies was only about 6% 4 months
ago, or a third of a year ago, and how much lead time do they really
need? The percentage difference in price is 37.55% if the currencies
are at par, and is NOW 40.85% since the Canadian dollar is worth more.
Any wonder why Canadians are refusing to buy in Canada?

Incidentally, someone tried to pay the U.S. price that is marked on
the book using U.S. dollars and a store here in Ontario refused to
take the U.S. currency... since they have to pay the distributor in
Canadian dollars.

We are tired of companies with hands in our pockets trying to extract
more from us than they can get from purchasers in the U.S. so we
simply are NOT buying here in Canada... I need to buy a new camera and
the price differences range from 22-49% on every camera I have looked
at, between the best price from a reputable U.S. store and the best
price from a reputable Canadian store. So where do you think I am
going to go to buy the camera?

FWIW, I am ANGRY...

That's just... weird.  Shipping costs can't be *that* much
higher, can they?  Pay the truck driver a little more to sit at a
border for a while...  nope, not that much difference.

Dang.  I've heard of gouging &quot;rich USAans&quot;, but this is the first
case I've heard of companies trying to gouge the non-USAans and
let the USAans off cheap!

Buy on-line, from a US supplier?

There's the same problem in New Zealand with books. A new mass
market paperback generally costs between NZ$20 and NZ$25. That's
somewhere in the vicinity of US$15 - US$19.

Shipping costs when buying from Amazon are often close to the cost of
the book - shipping to Australia or NZ.

Versus $16 - $20 NZ for buying a book from Amazon
(depending on now many items there are in the order
to spread the shipment cost over)

and Israel. In my recent order from amazon (which should arrive any day now),
2 Trilogies &amp; 1 graphic novel cost about $43 and the shipping cost about $20 :(

To add insult to injury, the customs authority here calculates the order total, not just
the cost of the books, when determining the import tax one has to pay.
One cal apeal, but the apeal process automatically adds 2 months to how long
you wait for the books.

The taxes where I do business changed a while back, so I have to
charge/pay sales tax on shipping as well as item cost. They're getting
a nice, big, extra hunk of cash out of it.

All this reminds me of a chapter in _The Lark and the Wren_, where Rune
and her mentor discuss the whys, wherefores, and abuses of government
and taxation.

Pity none of the PTB read that chapter.

We're luckier in New Zealand.  While shipment costs are included
in the taxable total, they don't charge tax unless that total
translates to over $400 NZ.

Reduces paperwork for everyone.

I figure one or the other countries (or both) taxes the items to protect
local book growers. Similar to USA taxing foreign sugar so Murakin sugar
farmers don't face as much competition.

Either that or They must be trying (very trying?) to offset the cost of
prescription meds!

Cute, but no... since the same thing occurs on all books by Harlequin,
which is owned by Torstar, the Toronto corporation that owns ALL of
the various brands they produce world-wide. They print the Harlequins
and Silouette books in both the U.S. and Canada and all of them have
this sort of price discrepancy.

Switching to cameras, which come out of Asia, the same applies. My son
just purchased a FujiFilm S8000fd camera for me from Beach Camera in
New Jersey on Monday. It's already on its way via FedEx to Utah. Cost
was US$329.00 all in. The lowest price I could find in Canada was
$437.75 plus 14% GST and PST plus $15 shipping plus 6% GST and that is
well over $500 for the same camera. I just purchased a U.S. money
order and paid $.9985 for the U.S. dollar, so the actual Canadian
dollar cost was UNDER that US$329 [by 49 cents] and the effective
price difference is over 50%... FujiFilm Canada will recognise the
FujiFilm U.S. warranty as long as the invoice and card are produced,
which will not be a problem. When I get the camera in November, and
return to Canada in December, I will have been out of Canada for more
than 7 days, so will have a $400 exemption from taxes...

Anyway, clearly here is another example where the prices are not quite
equal. The press release for this camera was issued in late July on
both sides of the border, when the U.S. dollar was about 6% higher
than the Canadian dollar, and even then the price was set at U.S.
$399.99 and Canadian $469.99 or a 17.5% difference.

BTW, I'll buy the book in the U.S. in late Novemeber, when I am down
there anyway :-)
