I'm wondering if anyone else has a cat the loves to ride in the car?
My kitten loves to go for drives and sits on myshoulders (don't
worry...I'm a passenger when this happens) But my other cat isn't so
hot about it...he hates carriers and seems better out of one,, but
still is anxious...Any good advice?

Meow!!!Purrrrrr....

Milla loves cars. The only bad thing is when she is in one, she is usually
going to the vet. She curls up in her carrier and goes right to sleep
(which is rare for her). Maybe I should drive her around town when it is
time for bed. :)

Baby doesn't hate car rides, but hates to be in the carrier!!!

He'll shout non-stop for me and push the carrier lid open unless i take him
out myself!!

Normally he doesn't walk around when the car is moving....but usually falls
right to sleep cradled in my arms..
When he wants to be awake, he'll sometimes get suport from my arm to perch
himself on the window side,so he can see what's going on outside, windows
closed of course.

When the car is parked, and we're waiting ...he likes to walk all over the
dash board, and the back of the car, amongst the stuff toys and tissue boxes
there.

Driving with him and two persons is OK.
Driving with him and one driver is HELL!
He will even runt ot the dashboard when the car's moving, to block the
driver'sview if not controlled!!!

:o)

thankfully....we knowhis tricks.....
