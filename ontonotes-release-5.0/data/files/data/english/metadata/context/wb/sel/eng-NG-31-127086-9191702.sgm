This article would be more properly titled, &quot;How Hillary sold out to the
Health Care Industry.
---------------------------------------------

She was persona non grata in the early 1990s, when the then-first lady's
dramatic health-care reform package went down. These days Hillary
Clinton is winning raves among health-care-industry groups-and
attracting their campaign dollars.

WEB EXCLUSIVE

Updated: 9:27 a.m. MT Sept 17, 2007

Sept. 17, 2007 - They were an army of two: Harry and Louise, those
middle-aged, middle-class icons, frustrated that the government was
limiting their health-care coverage. There they sat at their kitchen
table, bills strewn before them, an adding machine at hand, despair in
their souls. Bureaucrats were taking away their freedom-especially one
named Hillary Clinton.

Cooked up in 1993 by the health-care-insurance lobby, Harry and Louise
starred in a series of ads critical of the then-first lady's dramatic
plan to overhaul the U.S. health-care system. Her proposal for universal
coverage actually kept private insurers in place, but she favored strict
regulation-including price caps on insurance premiums. And she wasn't
going to compromise, not with the insurance companies, not with
Congress, not with doctors. So Harry and Louise fired back, spooking
Americans with their veiled references to socialized medicine. The
fictional pair triumphed in 1994, helping to sink the 1,342-page bill-a
centerpiece of her husband Bill Clinton's first term.

Fast-forward 13 years. Hillary has announced a new plan for universal
health-care coverage-a plan she hopes will help propel her to the
Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. Surprisingly, her past
health-care flop has become a significant political asset. Sixty-five
percent of all voters-and 91 percent of Democrats-are confident that she
would do the right thing for the health-care system, according to a
Gallup poll released in July. And the captains of the health-care
industry who once viewed her as the root of all evil are now filling the
coffers of her campaign. (Her proposal calls for mandatory
participation, which the industry tends to favor. But insurance
companies will also be required not to turn anyone away for pre-existing
conditions under Clinton's new plan.) As of the first quarter of 2007
she was the recipient of more health-care-industry donations than any
presidential candidate-Democrat or Republican-according to a recent
study by the Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy. Even
Charles Kahn, who, as executive vice president of the Health Insurance
Association of America, orchestrated the Harry and Louise ad campaign,
is hopeful that a President Hillary Clinton would tackle health-care
reform again. &quot;She knows a lot about health care, she's interested, she
can speak the language. It's a natural constituency,&quot; says Kahn, who is
now president of the Federation of American Hospitals and says he met
with her just a few months ago to talk about the issue.

How did the woman once demonized by the industry-whose plan was derided
as &quot;Hillary-care&quot;-become so popular in these parts?

For starters, it's a matter of realpolitik. As the leading Democratic
contender running at a time of sagging GOP popularity, she's a good bet
to win the White House. Health-care companies naturally want a seat at
the winner's table, regardless of who it is. &quot;These kinds of
contributions in general follow power and influence, and these groups
recognize that Sen. Clinton is a serious candidate to be the next
president,&quot; says Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a
campaign-finance watchdog group. &quot;They are interested in gaining access
to people in power of all ideologies in both parties.&quot;

But Clinton has worked to change her unyielding ways. Her effort in the
early 1990s was doomed in part by her rigid, aggressive approach; she
now says she's learned from that experience. She frequently talks about
how she now understands that change must be incremental and that
cooperation is the only way to get anything done. People in the industry
have noticed the difference. &quot;In 1993 we had meetings with [Hillary's
health-care task force leader] Ira Magaziner, but he turned his hearing
aid off. There was no negotiation, no give and take,&quot; says Kahn. But she
has a more open approach now. She's doing all the right things. She's
talking to people, listening to people. She says, 'I've learned a lot.'
All one can do is take her at her word.&quot;

She has also worked hard to win her former critics over-soliciting their
views and taking their advice. In July she invited several prominent
health-care-industry officials to meet with her and members of her
campaign and legislative staff, says Dr. Bruce Bagley of the American
Academy of Family Physicians, who was one of the attendees. Bagley noted
how different things seemed. &quot;Back in '93 it was a fairly closed
process. It seemed like this big black box that finally came up with a
plan,&quot; he says. This time she asked the group what her health-care
quality message should be-and spent two hours listening to their ideas,
key elements of which ended up in a health-care speech she subsequently
delivered in New Hampshire. &quot;For the most part, it was consistent with
what we were trying to promote,&quot; he says of the speech. After the
meeting Bagley got a personally signed thank-you note from the senator.
And after the speech he got a hand-written note on her own stationery
thanking him for having vetted her remarks beforehand. &quot;As you know,
improving the quality of health care that patients receive is
fundamental to a reformed healthcare system, and I am committed to
ensuring it as part of my agenda for covering all Americans,&quot; Clinton
wrote. Bagley says hasn't heard from any of the other presidential
candidates.

The American Medical Association also reports a warming trend. The group
was frustrated by how she handled the process in '93 but now finds her
staff regularly reaching out to consult. In a speech she gave to the AMA
in early 2006, the group was pleasantly surprised to hear her give voice
to many of its top priorities. &quot;Physicians should have a payment .&quot; she
said, before being interrupted by thundering applause. &quot;Physicians
should have a payment structure that doesn't result in year after year
of significant and unsustainable cuts when we all know health-care costs
are increasing.&quot; Fighting cuts in Medicare payments was a priority for
the AMA in 2006 and remains so today.

But Clinton isn't just talking the talk. Health-care groups say they
have been encouraged by her work in the Senate-where she's taken a more
restrained and incremental approach. In the '90s she thought she could
elbow past members of Congress. But since becoming one herself, she has
made a point of joining forces with Republicans on health-care issues.
Together they've worked to expand coverage for veterans and children, as
well as to modernize the system with electronic, rather than paper,
medical records. Her former foes in the industry have taken note. &quot;Since
becoming a senator, she's been focused on quality improvement, safety
improvement, comparative effective analysis. We support all of that,&quot;
says Karen Ignagni, CEO of American Health Insurance Plans, the
health-insurance industry trade group. This year AHIP, whose lobbyists
are in constant contact with Clinton's staff, put forward its own plan
for universal coverage, which Ignagni says got a positive response from
the senator's office.

She's made nice with the pharmaceutical industry, too. Big Pharma's
lobbyists are constantly engaged with her staff, as they are with other
members of Congress. &quot;Hillary recognizes the important role of
employer-provided health insurance and the important role of private
markets in insuring the people in the country,&quot; says Billy Tauzin, the
president of PhRMA (the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, a trade group for the industry), who voted against her first
plan when he was a member of Congress. &quot;I take comfort in that.&quot;

Clinton has also benefited from a growing public appetite for reform.
There are now 47 million people without health insurance in America,
compared to 40 million in 1993. Those who are covered have seen their
insurance premiums double. Voters are now much more anxious-and better
informed-about health care, making it a potent issue in the coming
election. &quot;In the 1990s, when Hillary first came out with the plan, the
average Joe thought, 'I'll always get health care.' Right now there's
scarcity,&quot; says Mary Kate Scott, of Scott &amp; Co., which does health-care
consulting. &quot;We actually feel the pain.&quot;

The industry does too. In the last decade and a half, its own costs have
ballooned, and the legions of uninsured people are an ever-increasing
burden on the system. Health-care groups say they're now looking for
solutions, and ready to talk. &quot;The sun and moon have aligned,&quot; says
Kahn. Adds Mike Bromberg, a lobbyist who helped kill the Clinton plan in
the early 1990s: &quot;There's a shift in the health community. There are
more people in health care who don't seem as concerned about government
program expansion anymore. When they're facing bad debts and all the
uninsured patients, they'd rather have something than nothing.&quot;

But there's a downside to her careful courtship of the industry. Her
chief rivals for the Democratic nomination, Barack Obama and John
Edwards, have repeatedly blasted her for accepting contributions from
federal lobbyists. (On the GOP side, Rudy Giuliani and Fred Thompson
have tried a different tack, sounding the &quot;socialized medicine&quot; bell, in
a not-so-veiled attempt to scare voters about Hillary's intentions.)
She's
raised more money directly from lobbyists-including those representing
health-care interests-and their families than any other presidential
candidate, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. While she's
been challenged by Edwards not to accept lobbyist cash, she's attended

We rank 37th in healthcare amongst industrialized nations yet pay more
for it than in any other country. I am COMPLETELY opposed to any
mandatory &quot;for profit&quot; healthcare plan. It is time to rank higher and
pay less!

&gt; are in constant contact with Clinton's staff, put forward its own plan
&gt; for universal coverage, which Ignagni says got a positive response from
&gt; the senator's office.

&gt; She's made nice with the pharmaceutical industry, too. Big Pharma's
&gt; lobbyists are constantly engaged with her staff, as they are with other
&gt; members of Congress. &quot;Hillary recognizes the important role of
&gt; employer-provided health insurance and the important role of private
&gt; markets in insuring the people in the country,&quot; says Billy Tauzin, the
&gt; president of PhRMA (the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
&gt; America, a trade group for the industry), who voted against her first
&gt; plan when he was a member of Congress. &quot;I take comfort in that.&quot;

&gt; Clinton has also benefited from a growing public appetite for reform.
&gt; There are now 47 million people without health insurance in America,
&gt; compared to 40 million in 1993. Those who are covered have seen their
&gt; insurance premiums double. Voters are now much more anxious-and better
&gt; informed-about health care, making it a potent issue in the coming
&gt; election. &quot;In the 1990s, when Hillary first came out with the plan, the
&gt; average Joe thought, 'I'll always get health care.' Right now there's
&gt; scarcity,&quot; says Mary Kate Scott, of Scott &amp; Co., which does health-care
&gt; consulting. &quot;We actually feel the pain.&quot;

&gt; The industry does too. In the last decade and a half, its own costs have
&gt; ballooned, and the legions of uninsured people are an ever-increasing
&gt; burden on the system. Health-care groups say they're now looking for
&gt; solutions, and ready to talk. &quot;The sun and moon have aligned,&quot; says
&gt; Kahn. Adds Mike Bromberg, a lobbyist who helped kill the Clinton plan in
&gt; the early 1990s: &quot;There's a shift in the health community. There are
&gt; more people in health care who don't seem as concerned about government
&gt; program expansion anymore. When they're facing bad debts and all the
&gt; uninsured patients, they'd rather have something than nothing.&quot;

&gt; But there's a downside to her careful courtship of the industry. Her
&gt; chief rivals for the Democratic nomination, Barack Obama and John
&gt; Edwards, have repeatedly blasted her for accepting contributions from
&gt; federal lobbyists. (On the GOP side, Rudy Giuliani and Fred Thompson

&gt;&gt; This article would be more properly titled, &quot;How Hillary sold out to the
&gt;&gt; Health Care Industry.
&gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------

&gt;&gt; She was persona non grata in the early 1990s, when the then-first lady's
&gt;&gt; dramatic health-care reform package went down. These days Hillary
&gt;&gt; Clinton is winning raves among health-care-industry groups-and
&gt;&gt; attracting their campaign dollars.

&gt;&gt; WEB EXCLUSIVE
&gt;&gt; By Susannah Meadows
&gt;&gt; Newsweek
&gt;&gt; Updated: 9:27 a.m. MT Sept 17, 2007

&gt;&gt; Sept. 17, 2007 - They were an army of two: Harry and Louise, those
&gt;&gt; middle-aged, middle-class icons, frustrated that the government was
&gt;&gt; limiting their health-care coverage. There they sat at their kitchen
&gt;&gt; table, bills strewn before them, an adding machine at hand, despair in
&gt;&gt; their souls. Bureaucrats were taking away their freedom-especially one
&gt;&gt; named Hillary Clinton.

&gt;&gt; Cooked up in 1993 by the health-care-insurance lobby, Harry and Louise
&gt;&gt; starred in a series of ads critical of the then-first lady's dramatic
&gt;&gt; plan to overhaul the U.S. health-care system. Her proposal for universal
&gt;&gt; coverage actually kept private insurers in place, but she favored strict
&gt;&gt; regulation-including price caps on insurance premiums. And she wasn't
&gt;&gt; going to compromise, not with the insurance companies, not with
&gt;&gt; Congress, not with doctors. So Harry and Louise fired back, spooking
&gt;&gt; Americans with their veiled references to socialized medicine. The
&gt;&gt; fictional pair triumphed in 1994, helping to sink the 1,342-page bill-a
&gt;&gt; centerpiece of her husband Bill Clinton's first term.

&gt;&gt; Fast-forward 13 years. Hillary has announced a new plan for universal
&gt;&gt; health-care coverage-a plan she hopes will help propel her to the
&gt;&gt; Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. Surprisingly, her past
&gt;&gt; health-care flop has become a significant political asset. Sixty-five
&gt;&gt; percent of all voters-and 91 percent of Democrats-are confident that she
&gt;&gt; would do the right thing for the health-care system, according to a
&gt;&gt; Gallup poll released in July. And the captains of the health-care
&gt;&gt; industry who once viewed her as the root of all evil are now filling the
&gt;&gt; coffers of her campaign. (Her proposal calls for mandatory
&gt;&gt; participation, which the industry tends to favor. But insurance
&gt;&gt; companies will also be required not to turn anyone away for pre-existing
&gt;&gt; conditions under Clinton's new plan.) As of the first quarter of 2007
&gt;&gt; she was the recipient of more health-care-industry donations than any
&gt;&gt; presidential candidate-Democrat or Republican-according to a recent
&gt;&gt; study by the Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy. Even
&gt;&gt; Charles Kahn, who, as executive vice president of the Health Insurance
&gt;&gt; Association of America, orchestrated the Harry and Louise ad campaign,
&gt;&gt; is hopeful that a President Hillary Clinton would tackle health-care
&gt;&gt; reform again. &quot;She knows a lot about health care, she's interested, she
&gt;&gt; can speak the language. It's a natural constituency,&quot; says Kahn, who is
&gt;&gt; now president of the Federation of American Hospitals and says he met
&gt;&gt; with her just a few months ago to talk about the issue.

&gt;&gt; How did the woman once demonized by the industry-whose plan was derided
&gt;&gt; as &quot;Hillary-care&quot;-become so popular in these parts?

&gt;&gt; For starters, it's a matter of realpolitik. As the leading Democratic
&gt;&gt; contender running at a time of sagging GOP popularity, she's a good bet
&gt;&gt; to win the White House. Health-care companies naturally want a seat at
&gt;&gt; the winner's table, regardless of who it is. &quot;These kinds of
&gt;&gt; contributions in general follow power and influence, and these groups
&gt;&gt; recognize that Sen. Clinton is a serious candidate to be the next
&gt;&gt; president,&quot; says Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a
&gt;&gt; campaign-finance watchdog group. &quot;They are interested in gaining access
&gt;&gt; to people in power of all ideologies in both parties.&quot;

&gt;&gt; But Clinton has worked to change her unyielding ways. Her effort in the
&gt;&gt; early 1990s was doomed in part by her rigid, aggressive approach; she
&gt;&gt; now says she's learned from that experience. She frequently talks about
&gt;&gt; how she now understands that change must be incremental and that
&gt;&gt; cooperation is the only way to get anything done. People in the industry
&gt;&gt; have noticed the difference. &quot;In 1993 we had meetings with [Hillary's
&gt;&gt; health-care task force leader] Ira Magaziner, but he turned his hearing
&gt;&gt; aid off. There was no negotiation, no give and take,&quot; says Kahn. But she
&gt;&gt; has a more open approach now. She's doing all the right things. She's
&gt;&gt; talking to people, listening to people. She says, 'I've learned a lot.'
&gt;&gt; All one can do is take her at her word.&quot;

&gt;&gt; She has also worked hard to win her former critics over-soliciting their
&gt;&gt; views and taking their advice. In July she invited several prominent
&gt;&gt; health-care-industry officials to meet with her and members of her
&gt;&gt; campaign and legislative staff, says Dr. Bruce Bagley of the American
&gt;&gt; Academy of Family Physicians, who was one of the attendees. Bagley noted
&gt;&gt; how different things seemed. &quot;Back in '93 it was a fairly closed
&gt;&gt; process. It seemed like this big black box that finally came up with a
&gt;&gt; plan,&quot; he says. This time she asked the group what her health-care
&gt;&gt; quality message should be-and spent two hours listening to their ideas,
&gt;&gt; key elements of which ended up in a health-care speech she subsequently
&gt;&gt; delivered in New Hampshire. &quot;For the most part, it was consistent with
&gt;&gt; what we were trying to promote,&quot; he says of the speech. After the
&gt;&gt; meeting Bagley got a personally signed thank-you note from the senator.
&gt;&gt; And after the speech he got a hand-written note on her own stationery
&gt;&gt; thanking him for having vetted her remarks beforehand. &quot;As you know,
&gt;&gt; improving the quality of health care that patients receive is
&gt;&gt; fundamental to a reformed healthcare system, and I am committed to
&gt;&gt; ensuring it as part of my agenda for covering all Americans,&quot; Clinton
&gt;&gt; wrote. Bagley says hasn't heard from any of the other presidential
&gt;&gt; candidates.

&gt;&gt; The American Medical Association also reports a warming trend. The group
&gt;&gt; was frustrated by how she handled the process in '93 but now finds her
&gt;&gt; staff regularly reaching out to consult. In a speech she gave to the AMA
&gt;&gt; in early 2006, the group was pleasantly surprised to hear her give voice
&gt;&gt; to many of its top priorities. &quot;Physicians should have a payment .&quot; she
&gt;&gt; said, before being interrupted by thundering applause. &quot;Physicians
&gt;&gt; should have a payment structure that doesn't result in year after year
&gt;&gt; of significant and unsustainable cuts when we all know health-care costs
&gt;&gt; are increasing.&quot; Fighting cuts in Medicare payments was a priority for
&gt;&gt; the AMA in 2006 and remains so today.

&gt;&gt; But Clinton isn't just talking the talk. Health-care groups say they
&gt;&gt; have been encouraged by her work in the Senate-where she's taken a more
&gt;&gt; restrained and incremental approach. In the '90s she thought she could
&gt;&gt; elbow past members of Congress. But since becoming one herself, she has
&gt;&gt; made a point of joining forces with Republicans on health-care issues.
&gt;&gt; Together they've worked to expand coverage for veterans and children, as
&gt;&gt; well as to modernize the system with electronic, rather than paper,
&gt;&gt; medical records. Her former foes in the industry have taken note. &quot;Since
&gt;&gt; becoming a senator, she's been focused on quality improvement, safety
&gt;&gt; improvement, comparative effective analysis. We support all of that,&quot;
&gt;&gt; says Karen Ignagni, CEO of American Health Insurance Plans, the
&gt;&gt; health-insurance industry trade group. This year AHIP, whose lobbyists
&gt;&gt; are in constant contact with Clinton's staff, put forward its own plan
&gt;&gt; for universal coverage, which Ignagni says got a positive response from
&gt;&gt; the senator's office.

&gt;&gt; She's made nice with the pharmaceutical industry, too. Big Pharma's
&gt;&gt; lobbyists are constantly engaged with her staff, as they are with other
&gt;&gt; members of Congress. &quot;Hillary recognizes the important role of

&gt;&gt; president of PhRMA (the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
&gt;&gt; America, a trade group for the industry), who voted against her first
&gt;&gt; plan when he was a member of Congress. &quot;I take comfort in that.&quot;

All true, but the information we get from the vested interests isn't
unbiased either.

Moore, like all documentary filmmakers has a point of view and is
selective in what he chooses to depict in order to make his point. He is
just a lot more obvious about it than most. Despite the flaws and the
grandstanding, Moore's film raised awareness and got an important dialog
going. A dialog that seems to have some legs now.

So, Sicko will remain the gold standard until someone with a lot more
skill and finesse takes on the subject, and gets the kind of media
coverage that Moore got. Will that ever happen? I won't be holding my
breath waiting for it.

Now, this is really specious logic. We're trying to improve our own system
of healthcare so we can match or beat that of some of these other countries

If we were not so selfish, we wouldn't demand such high returns on our
pharmaceutical stocks, etc. and we would invest in methods of improving
health care for the whole of our people. That's what Hillary is attempting
to do. If you can't do better, get the hell out of the way. People's lives
depend on it.

&gt;&gt; Cooked up in 1993 by the health-care-insurance lobby, Harry and Louise
&gt;&gt; starred in a series of ads critical of the then-first lady's dramatic
&gt;&gt; plan to overhaul the U.S. health-care system. Her proposal for universal
&gt;&gt; coverage actually kept private insurers in place, but she favored strict
&gt;&gt; regulation-including price caps on insurance premiums. And she wasn't
&gt;&gt; going to compromise, not with the insurance companies, not with
&gt;&gt; Congress, not with doctors. So Harry and Louise fired back, spooking
&gt;&gt; Americans with their veiled references to socialized medicine. The
&gt;&gt; fictional pair triumphed in 1994, helping to sink the 1,342-page bill-a
&gt;&gt; centerpiece of her husband Bill Clinton's first term.

&gt;&gt; Fast-forward 13 years. Hillary has announced a new plan for universal
&gt;&gt; health-care coverage-a plan she hopes will help propel her to the
&gt;&gt; Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. Surprisingly, her past
&gt;&gt; health-care flop has become a significant political asset. Sixty-five
&gt;&gt; percent of all voters-and 91 percent of Democrats-are confident that she
&gt;&gt; would do the right thing for the health-care system, according to a
&gt;&gt; Gallup poll released in July. And the captains of the health-care
&gt;&gt; industry who once viewed her as the root of all evil are now filling the
&gt;&gt; coffers of her campaign. (Her proposal calls for mandatory
&gt;&gt; participation, which the industry tends to favor. But insurance
&gt;&gt; companies will also be required not to turn anyone away for pre-existing
&gt;&gt; conditions under Clinton's new plan.) As of the first quarter of 2007
&gt;&gt; she was the recipient of more health-care-industry donations than any
&gt;&gt; presidential candidate-Democrat or Republican-according to a recent
&gt;&gt; study by the Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy. Even
&gt;&gt; Charles Kahn, who, as executive vice president of the Health Insurance
&gt;&gt; Association of America, orchestrated the Harry and Louise ad campaign,
&gt;&gt; is hopeful that a President Hillary Clinton would tackle health-care
&gt;&gt; reform again. &quot;She knows a lot about health care, she's interested, she
&gt;&gt; can speak the language. It's a natural constituency,&quot; says Kahn, who is
&gt;&gt; now president of the Federation of American Hospitals and says he met
&gt;&gt; with her just a few months ago to talk about the issue.

&gt;&gt; How did the woman once demonized by the industry-whose plan was derided
&gt;&gt; as &quot;Hillary-care&quot;-become so popular in these parts?

&gt;&gt; For starters, it's a matter of realpolitik. As the leading Democratic
&gt;&gt; contender running at a time of sagging GOP popularity, she's a good bet
&gt;&gt; to win the White House. Health-care companies naturally want a seat at
&gt;&gt; the winner's table, regardless of who it is. &quot;These kinds of
&gt;&gt; contributions in general follow power and influence, and these groups
&gt;&gt; recognize that Sen. Clinton is a serious candidate to be the next
&gt;&gt; president,&quot; says Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a
&gt;&gt; campaign-finance watchdog group. &quot;They are interested in gaining access
&gt;&gt; to people in power of all ideologies in both parties.&quot;

&gt;&gt; But Clinton has worked to change her unyielding ways. Her effort in the
&gt;&gt; early 1990s was doomed in part by her rigid, aggressive approach; she
&gt;&gt; now says she's learned from that experience. She frequently talks about
&gt;&gt; how she now understands that change must be incremental and that
&gt;&gt; cooperation is the only way to get anything done. People in the industry
&gt;&gt; have noticed the difference. &quot;In 1993 we had meetings with [Hillary's
&gt;&gt; health-care task force leader] Ira Magaziner, but he turned his hearing
&gt;&gt; aid off. There was no negotiation, no give and take,&quot; says Kahn. But she
&gt;&gt; has a more open approach now. She's doing all the right things. She's
&gt;&gt; talking to people, listening to people. She says, 'I've learned a lot.'
&gt;&gt; All one can do is take her at her word.&quot;

&gt;&gt; She has also worked hard to win her former critics over-soliciting their
&gt;&gt; views and taking their advice. In July she invited several prominent
&gt;&gt; health-care-industry officials to meet with her and members of her
&gt;&gt; campaign and legislative staff, says Dr. Bruce Bagley of the American
&gt;&gt; Academy of Family Physicians, who was one of the attendees. Bagley noted
&gt;&gt; how different things seemed. &quot;Back in '93 it was a fairly closed
&gt;&gt; process. It seemed like this big black box that finally came up with a
&gt;&gt; plan,&quot; he says. This time she asked the group what her health-care
&gt;&gt; quality message should be-and spent two hours listening to their ideas,
&gt;&gt; key elements of which ended up in a health-care speech she subsequently
&gt;&gt; delivered in New Hampshire. &quot;For the most part, it was consistent with
&gt;&gt; what we were trying to promote,&quot; he says of the speech. After the
&gt;&gt; meeting Bagley got a personally signed thank-you note from the senator.
&gt;&gt; And after the speech he got a hand-written note on her own stationery
&gt;&gt; thanking him for having vetted her remarks beforehand. &quot;As you know,
&gt;&gt; improving the quality of health care that patients receive is
&gt;&gt; fundamental to a reformed healthcare system, and I am committed to
&gt;&gt; ensuring it as part of my agenda for covering all Americans,&quot; Clinton
&gt;&gt; wrote. Bagley says hasn't heard from any of the other presidential
&gt;&gt; candidates.

&gt;&gt; The American Medical Association also reports a warming trend. The group
&gt;&gt; was frustrated by how she handled the process in '93 but now finds her
&gt;&gt; staff regularly reaching out to consult. In a speech she gave to the AMA
&gt;&gt; in early 2006, the group was pleasantly surprised to hear her give voice
&gt;&gt; to many of its top priorities. &quot;Physicians should have a payment .&quot; she
&gt;&gt; said, before being interrupted by thundering applause. &quot;Physicians
&gt;&gt; should have a payment structure that doesn't result in year after year
&gt;&gt; of significant and unsustainable cuts when we all know health-care costs
&gt;&gt; are increasing.&quot; Fighting cuts in Medicare payments was a priority for
&gt;&gt; the AMA in 2006 and remains so today.

&gt;&gt; But Clinton isn't just talking the talk. Health-care groups say they
&gt;&gt; have been encouraged by her work in the Senate-where she's taken a more
&gt;&gt; restrained and incremental approach. In the '90s she thought she could
&gt;&gt; elbow past members of Congress. But since becoming one herself, she has
&gt;&gt; made a point of joining forces with Republicans on health-care issues.
&gt;&gt; Together they've worked to expand coverage for veterans and children, as
&gt;&gt; well as to modernize the system with electronic, rather than paper,
&gt;&gt; medical records. Her former foes in the industry have taken note. &quot;Since
&gt;&gt; becoming a senator, she's been focused on quality improvement, safety
&gt;&gt; improvement, comparative effective analysis. We support all of that,&quot;
&gt;&gt; says Karen Ignagni, CEO of American Health Insurance Plans, the
&gt;&gt; health-insurance industry trade group. This year AHIP, whose lobbyists
&gt;&gt; are in constant contact with Clinton's staff, put forward its own plan
&gt;&gt; for universal coverage, which Ignagni says got a positive response from
&gt;&gt; the senator's office.

&gt;&gt; She's made nice with the pharmaceutical industry, too. Big Pharma's
&gt;&gt; lobbyists are constantly engaged with her staff, as they are with other
&gt;&gt; members of Congress. &quot;Hillary recognizes the important role of
&gt;&gt; employer-provided health insurance and the important role of private
&gt;&gt; markets in insuring the people in the country,&quot; says Billy Tauzin, the
&gt;&gt; president of PhRMA (the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
&gt;&gt; America, a trade group for the industry), who voted against her first
&gt;&gt; plan when he was a member of Congress. &quot;I take comfort in that.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Clinton has also benefited from a growing public appetite for reform.
&gt;&gt; There are now 47 million people without health insurance in America,
&gt;&gt; compared to 40 million in 1993. Those who are covered have seen their
&gt;&gt; insurance premiums double. Voters are now much more anxious-and better
&gt;&gt; informed-about health care, making it a potent issue in the coming
&gt;&gt; election. &quot;In the 1990s, when Hillary first came out with the plan, the
&gt;&gt; average Joe thought, 'I'll always get health care.' Right now there's
&gt;&gt; scarcity,&quot; says Mary Kate Scott, of Scott &amp; Co., which does health-care
&gt;&gt; consulting. &quot;We actually feel the pain.&quot;

&gt;&gt; The industry does too. In the last decade and a half, its own costs have
&gt;&gt; ballooned, and the legions of uninsured people are an ever-increasing
&gt;&gt; burden on the system. Health-care groups say they're now looking for
&gt;&gt; solutions, and ready to talk. &quot;The sun and moon have aligned,&quot; says
&gt;&gt; Kahn. Adds Mike Bromberg, a lobbyist who helped kill the Clinton plan in
&gt;&gt; the early 1990s: &quot;There's a shift in the health community. There are
&gt;&gt; more people in health care who don't seem as concerned about government
&gt;&gt; program expansion anymore. When they're facing bad debts and all the
&gt;&gt; uninsured patients, they'd rather have something than nothing.&quot;

&gt;&gt; But there's a downside to her careful courtship of the industry. Her

&gt; Forty Seven MILLION and the number is CLIMBING.

&gt; It's very difficult to picture yourself as uninsured when you or your

&gt; are many life events which can yank the rug out from under you along

&gt;&gt; &gt;Now, this is really specious logic. We're trying to improve our own

&gt;&gt; &gt;If we were not so selfish, we wouldn't demand such high returns on our

&gt;&gt; It's very difficult to picture yourself as uninsured when you or your

&gt;&gt; are many life events which can yank the rug out from under you along

The one thing we know is that it's far too many people not covered by
medical insurance. That's a simple fact. We don't have to settle for Cuba,
France etc. in our way of solving this issue. That was an example of how, at
the very LEAST we could improve a system that is not working for enough
people to justify settling for what we now have. To imagine that we should
be happy with having ONLY tens of millions of our own not covered so that
greedy pharmaceutical companies do not have to give up their &quot;right&quot; to
absurdly high profits doesn't make much sense to me. I support a socialist
approach to healthcare in this county because private industry has failed so
badly at keeping the majority of of the public informed, healthy and safe
from devastating loss due to the costs of treating serious illness. It's
time for the lobbyists to be escorted out of our leaders offices so we can
start getting real work done on serious issues instead of pushing Viagra
over stem cell research. Lead, follow, or get out of the way. We don't need
any more hair growth products taking up time and money when real health
threats go unchallenged due to the big buck drugs these companies have been
working towards.

&gt; This article would be more properly titled, &quot;How Hillary sold out to the
&gt; Health Care Industry.
&gt; ---------------------------------------------

&gt; She was persona non grata in the early 1990s, when the then-first lady's
&gt; dramatic health-care reform package went down. These days Hillary
&gt; Clinton is winning raves among health-care-industry groups-and
&gt; attracting their campaign dollars.

&gt; WEB EXCLUSIVE
&gt; By Susannah Meadows
&gt; Newsweek
&gt; Updated: 9:27 a.m. MT Sept 17, 2007

&gt; Sept. 17, 2007 - They were an army of two: Harry and Louise, those
&gt; middle-aged, middle-class icons, frustrated that the government was
&gt; limiting their health-care coverage. There they sat at their kitchen
&gt; table, bills strewn before them, an adding machine at hand, despair in
&gt; their souls. Bureaucrats were taking away their freedom-especially one
&gt; named Hillary Clinton.

&gt; Cooked up in 1993 by the health-care-insurance lobby, Harry and Louise
&gt; starred in a series of ads critical of the then-first lady's dramatic
&gt; plan to overhaul the U.S. health-care system. Her proposal for universal
&gt; coverage actually kept private insurers in place, but she favored strict
&gt; regulation-including price caps on insurance premiums. And she wasn't
&gt; going to compromise, not with the insurance companies, not with
&gt; Congress, not with doctors. So Harry and Louise fired back, spooking
&gt; Americans with their veiled references to socialized medicine. The
&gt; fictional pair triumphed in 1994, helping to sink the 1,342-page bill-a
&gt; centerpiece of her husband Bill Clinton's first term.

&gt; Fast-forward 13 years. Hillary has announced a new plan for universal
&gt; health-care coverage-a plan she hopes will help propel her to the
&gt; Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. Surprisingly, her past
&gt; health-care flop has become a significant political asset. Sixty-five
&gt; percent of all voters-and 91 percent of Democrats-are confident that she
&gt; would do the right thing for the health-care system, according to a
&gt; Gallup poll released in July. And the captains of the health-care
&gt; industry who once viewed her as the root of all evil are now filling the
&gt; coffers of her campaign. (Her proposal calls for mandatory
&gt; participation, which the industry tends to favor. But insurance
&gt; companies will also be required not to turn anyone away for pre-existing
&gt; conditions under Clinton's new plan.) As of the first quarter of 2007
&gt; she was the recipient of more health-care-industry donations than any
&gt; presidential candidate-Democrat or Republican-according to a recent
&gt; study by the Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy. Even
&gt; Charles Kahn, who, as executive vice president of the Health Insurance
&gt; Association of America, orchestrated the Harry and Louise ad campaign,
&gt; is hopeful that a President Hillary Clinton would tackle health-care
&gt; reform again. &quot;She knows a lot about health care, she's interested, she
&gt; can speak the language. It's a natural constituency,&quot; says Kahn, who is
&gt; now president of the Federation of American Hospitals and says he met
&gt; with her just a few months ago to talk about the issue.

&gt; How did the woman once demonized by the industry-whose plan was derided
&gt; as &quot;Hillary-care&quot;-become so popular in these parts?

&gt; For starters, it's a matter of realpolitik. As the leading Democratic
&gt; contender running at a time of sagging GOP popularity, she's a good bet
&gt; to win the White House. Health-care companies naturally want a seat at
&gt; the winner's table, regardless of who it is. &quot;These kinds of
&gt; contributions in general follow power and influence, and these groups
&gt; recognize that Sen. Clinton is a serious candidate to be the next
&gt; president,&quot; says Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a
&gt; campaign-finance watchdog group. &quot;They are interested in gaining access
&gt; to people in power of all ideologies in both parties.&quot;

&gt; But Clinton has worked to change her unyielding ways. Her effort in the
&gt; early 1990s was doomed in part by her rigid, aggressive approach; she
&gt; now says she's learned from that experience. She frequently talks about
&gt; how she now understands that change must be incremental and that
&gt; cooperation is the only way to get anything done. People in the industry
&gt; have noticed the difference. &quot;In 1993 we had meetings with [Hillary's
&gt; health-care task force leader] Ira Magaziner, but he turned his hearing
&gt; aid off. There was no negotiation, no give and take,&quot; says Kahn. But she
&gt; has a more open approach now. She's doing all the right things. She's
&gt; talking to people, listening to people. She says, 'I've learned a lot.'
&gt; All one can do is take her at her word.&quot;

&gt; She has also worked hard to win her former critics over-soliciting their
&gt; views and taking their advice. In July she invited several prominent
&gt; health-care-industry officials to meet with her and members of her
&gt; campaign and legislative staff, says Dr. Bruce Bagley of the American
&gt; Academy of Family Physicians, who was one of the attendees. Bagley noted
&gt; how different things seemed. &quot;Back in '93 it was a fairly closed
&gt; process. It seemed like this big black box that finally came up with a
&gt; plan,&quot; he says. This time she asked the group what her health-care
&gt; quality message should be-and spent two hours listening to their ideas,
&gt; key elements of which ended up in a health-care speech she subsequently
&gt; delivered in New Hampshire. &quot;For the most part, it was consistent with
&gt; what we were trying to promote,&quot; he says of the speech. After the
&gt; meeting Bagley got a personally signed thank-you note from the senator.
&gt; And after the speech he got a hand-written note on her own stationery
&gt; thanking him for having vetted her remarks beforehand. &quot;As you know,
&gt; improving the quality of health care that patients receive is
&gt; fundamental to a reformed healthcare system, and I am committed to
&gt; ensuring it as part of my agenda for covering all Americans,&quot; Clinton
&gt; wrote. Bagley says hasn't heard from any of the other presidential
&gt; candidates.

&gt; The American Medical Association also reports a warming trend. The group
&gt; was frustrated by how she handled the process in '93 but now finds her
&gt; staff regularly reaching out to consult. In a speech she gave to the AMA
&gt; in early 2006, the group was pleasantly surprised to hear her give voice
&gt; to many of its top priorities. &quot;Physicians should have a payment .&quot; she
&gt; said, before being interrupted by thundering applause. &quot;Physicians
&gt; should have a payment structure that doesn't result in year after year
&gt; of significant and unsustainable cuts when we all know health-care costs
&gt; are increasing.&quot; Fighting cuts in Medicare payments was a priority for
&gt; the AMA in 2006 and remains so today.

&gt; But Clinton isn't just talking the talk. Health-care groups say they
&gt; have been encouraged by her work in the Senate-where she's taken a more
&gt; restrained and incremental approach. In the '90s she thought she could
&gt; elbow past members of Congress. But since becoming one herself, she has
&gt; made a point of joining forces with Republicans on health-care issues.
&gt; Together they've worked to expand coverage for veterans and children, as
&gt; well as to modernize the system with electronic, rather than paper,
&gt; medical records. Her former foes in the industry have taken note. &quot;Since
&gt; becoming a senator, she's been focused on quality improvement, safety
&gt; improvement, comparative effective analysis. We support all of that,&quot;
&gt; says Karen Ignagni, CEO of American Health Insurance Plans, the
&gt; health-insurance industry trade group. This year AHIP, whose lobbyists
&gt; are in constant contact with Clinton's staff, put forward its own plan
&gt; for universal coverage, which Ignagni says got a positive response from
&gt; the senator's office.

&gt; She's made nice with the pharmaceutical industry, too. Big Pharma's
&gt; lobbyists are constantly engaged with her staff, as they are with other
&gt; members of Congress. &quot;Hillary recognizes the important role of
&gt; employer-provided health insurance and the important role of private
&gt; markets in insuring the people in the country,&quot; says Billy Tauzin, the
&gt; president of PhRMA (the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
&gt; America, a trade group for the industry), who voted against her first
&gt; plan when he was a member of Congress. &quot;I take comfort in that.&quot;

&gt; Clinton has also benefited from a growing public appetite for reform.
&gt; There are now 47 million people without health insurance in America,
&gt; compared to 40 million in 1993. Those who are covered have seen their
&gt; insurance premiums double. Voters are now much more anxious-and better
&gt; informed-about health care, making it a potent issue in the coming
&gt; election. &quot;In the 1990s, when Hillary first came out with the plan, the
&gt; average Joe thought, 'I'll always get health care.' Right now there's
&gt; scarcity,&quot; says Mary Kate Scott, of Scott &amp; Co., which does health-care
&gt; consulting. &quot;We actually feel the pain.&quot;

&gt; The industry does too. In the last decade and a half, its own costs have
&gt; ballooned, and the legions of uninsured people are an ever-increasing
&gt; burden on the system. Health-care groups say they're now looking for
&gt; solutions, and ready to talk. &quot;The sun and moon have aligned,&quot; says
&gt; Kahn. Adds Mike Bromberg, a lobbyist who helped kill the Clinton plan in
&gt; the early 1990s: &quot;There's a shift in the health community. There are
&gt; more people in health care who don't seem as concerned about government
&gt; program expansion anymore. When they're facing bad debts and all the
&gt; uninsured patients, they'd rather have something than nothing.&quot;

&gt; But there's a downside to her careful courtship of the industry. Her
&gt; chief rivals for the Democratic nomination, Barack Obama and John
&gt; Edwards, have repeatedly blasted her for accepting contributions from
&gt; federal lobbyists. (On the GOP side, Rudy Giuliani and Fred Thompson
&gt; have tried a different tack, sounding the &quot;socialized medicine&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, Sicko will remain the gold standard until someone with a lot
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; skill and finesse takes on the subject, and gets the kind of media
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; coverage that Moore got. Will that ever happen? I won't be holding
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; breath waiting for it.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; But the gold standard of what?  Wanton pandering to a numerically
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; high, but statistically small group of people.  Throwing around
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; numbers in the tens of millions sound like there is a shitload of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; people, but when the population is in the 100's of millions the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; percentage barely breaks into the teens.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The movie was about issues that affect nearly everyone; not just the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; uninsured. And speaking of pandering; arguing over the percentage of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; uninsured is a good way for the right wing to pander to its base and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; divert their attention away from the real issues.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Do other people do any number of certain things better then we do,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sure.  But, do you want to live in Cuba or France.  There are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; downsides to both of those places as well.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So, if we want universal health care, we have to choose between being
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cuba
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; or France?    :-)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Now, this is really specious logic. We're trying to improve our own
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;system
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;of healthcare so we can match or beat that of some of these other
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;countries
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;with better health care then our own. Why imagine that we need go to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;these
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;other countries? Where does that come from? YellowCake?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; One of these days (I hope)  somebody is going to convince our
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; population to once again look at the country as a whole as opposed to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a hole.  No wonder they killed Kennedy

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You have hope that people will eventually stop being selfish

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Juba
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If we were not so selfish, we wouldn't demand such high returns on our
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;pharmaceutical stocks, etc. and we would invest in methods of improving
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;health care for the whole of our people. That's what Hillary is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;attempting
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;to do. If you can't do better, get the hell out of the way. People's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;lives
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;depend on it.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Forty Seven MILLION and the number is CLIMBING.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It's very difficult to picture yourself as uninsured when you or your
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; spouse is working and in a good plan., but I assure you doubters there
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are many life events which can yank the rug out from under you along
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with your health insurance, and you don't have to be a reprobate or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; slacker for it to happen. It would also be a boon to small businessses
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and their employees.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; . Sound advice Cabbi!

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It's 30 million, then is 50 million, then it's 25 million, then it's

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; how many are already covered by Medicare and/or SCHIP or some other
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; program?

&gt; &gt;&gt; The one thing we know is that it's far too many people not covered by
&gt; &gt;&gt; medical insurance. That's a simple fact. We don't have to settle for Cuba,
&gt; &gt;&gt; France etc. in our way of solving this issue. That was an example of how, at
&gt; &gt;&gt; the very LEAST we could improve a system that is not working for enough
&gt; &gt;&gt; people to justify settling for what we now have. To imagine that we should
&gt; &gt;&gt; be happy with having ONLY tens of millions of our own not covered so that
&gt; &gt;&gt; greedy pharmaceutical companies do not have to give up their &quot;right&quot; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; absurdly high profits doesn't make much sense to me. I support a socialist
&gt; &gt;&gt; approach to healthcare in this county because private industry has failed so
&gt; &gt;&gt; badly at keeping the majority of of the public informed, healthy and safe
&gt; &gt;&gt; from devastating loss due to the costs of treating serious illness. It's
&gt; &gt;&gt; time for the lobbyists to be escorted out of our leaders offices so we can
&gt; &gt;&gt; start getting real work done on serious issues instead of pushing Viagra
&gt; &gt;&gt; over stem cell research. Lead, follow, or get out of the way. We don't need
&gt; &gt;&gt; any more hair growth products taking up time and money when real health
&gt; &gt;&gt; threats go unchallenged due to the big buck drugs these companies have been
&gt; &gt;&gt; working towards.

&gt; &gt; For the most part I agree, but don't hang this on the pharmaceutical

&gt; &gt; How about Tort reform?

&gt; &gt; Also, we don't need any more Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, and all of
&gt; &gt; the other plethoria of companies trying to make a fast buck because we
&gt; &gt; Americans are fat, lazy and stupid.

&gt; Why start the blame game, sit down start work on a solution. It's easy to

A better question to ask is how many of the over 300 million Americans
have crummy insurance; high deductables; high co-pays; low ceiling on
benefits; insurance auditors whose job it is to deny, deny deny? And how
many Americans (through no fault of their own) are one health crisis
away from losing everything they own?

My healthcare has never been so good as under this administration. I
don't want to FIX it. Seniors have never had it so good! It isn't
broken. What would help is to stop the lobbyists who drive the cost of
drugs up and keep them out of reach for many Americans. Nobody pays
what we pay for drugs in America. It is an outrage! And it sounds like
Hillary is in bed with them!

&gt; This article would be more properly titled, &quot;How Hillary sold out to the
&gt; Health Care Industry.
&gt; ---------------------------------------------

&gt; She was persona non grata in the early 1990s, when the then-first lady's
&gt; dramatic health-care reform package went down. These days Hillary
&gt; Clinton is winning raves among health-care-industry groups-and
&gt; attracting their campaign dollars.

&gt; WEB EXCLUSIVE
&gt; By Susannah Meadows
&gt; Newsweek
&gt; Updated: 9:27 a.m. MT Sept 17, 2007

&gt; Sept. 17, 2007 - They were an army of two: Harry and Louise, those
&gt; middle-aged, middle-class icons, frustrated that the government was
&gt; limiting their health-care coverage. There they sat at their kitchen
&gt; table, bills strewn before them, an adding machine at hand, despair in
&gt; their souls. Bureaucrats were taking away their freedom-especially one
&gt; named Hillary Clinton.

&gt; Cooked up in 1993 by the health-care-insurance lobby, Harry and Louise
&gt; starred in a series of ads critical of the then-first lady's dramatic
&gt; plan to overhaul the U.S. health-care system. Her proposal for universal
&gt; coverage actually kept private insurers in place, but she favored strict
&gt; regulation-including price caps on insurance premiums. And she wasn't
&gt; going to compromise, not with the insurance companies, not with
&gt; Congress, not with doctors. So Harry and Louise fired back, spooking
&gt; Americans with their veiled references to socialized medicine. The
&gt; fictional pair triumphed in 1994, helping to sink the 1,342-page bill-a
&gt; centerpiece of her husband Bill Clinton's first term.

&gt; Fast-forward 13 years. Hillary has announced a new plan for universal
&gt; health-care coverage-a plan she hopes will help propel her to the
&gt; Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. Surprisingly, her past
&gt; health-care flop has become a significant political asset. Sixty-five
&gt; percent of all voters-and 91 percent of Democrats-are confident that she
&gt; would do the right thing for the health-care system, according to a
&gt; Gallup poll released in July. And the captains of the health-care
&gt; industry who once viewed her as the root of all evil are now filling the
&gt; coffers of her campaign. (Her proposal calls for mandatory
&gt; participation, which the industry tends to favor. But insurance
&gt; companies will also be required not to turn anyone away for pre-existing
&gt; conditions under Clinton's new plan.) As of the first quarter of 2007
&gt; she was the recipient of more health-care-industry donations than any
&gt; presidential candidate-Democrat or Republican-according to a recent
&gt; study by the Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy. Even
&gt; Charles Kahn, who, as executive vice president of the Health Insurance
&gt; Association of America, orchestrated the Harry and Louise ad campaign,
&gt; is hopeful that a President Hillary Clinton would tackle health-care
&gt; reform again. &quot;She knows a lot about health care, she's interested, she
&gt; can speak the language. It's a natural constituency,&quot; says Kahn, who is
&gt; now president of the Federation of American Hospitals and says he met
&gt; with her just a few months ago to talk about the issue.

&gt; the early 1990s: &quot;There's a shift in the health community. There are
&gt; more people in health care who don't seem as concerned about government

Just because seniors have it good right now doesn't mean that the system

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; But the gold standard of what?  Wanton pandering to a numerically
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; high, but statistically small group of people.  Throwing around
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; numbers in the tens of millions sound like there is a shitload of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; people, but when the population is in the 100's of millions the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; percentage barely breaks into the teens.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The movie was about issues that affect nearly everyone; not just
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; uninsured. And speaking of pandering; arguing over the percentage
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; uninsured is a good way for the right wing to pander to its base
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; divert their attention away from the real issues.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Do other people do any number of certain things better then we do,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sure.  But, do you want to live in Cuba or France.  There are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; downsides to both of those places as well.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So, if we want universal health care, we have to choose between
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; being
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cuba
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; or France?    :-)
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Now, this is really specious logic. We're trying to improve our own
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;system
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;of healthcare so we can match or beat that of some of these other
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;countries
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;with better health care then our own. Why imagine that we need go to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;these

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;improving
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;health care for the whole of our people. That's what Hillary is

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It's very difficult to picture yourself as uninsured when you or your
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; spouse is working and in a good plan., but I assure you doubters there
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are many life events which can yank the rug out from under you along
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with your health insurance, and you don't have to be a reprobate or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; slacker for it to happen. It would also be a boon to small businessses

&gt;&gt; &gt; It's 30 million, then is 50 million, then it's 25 million, then it's
&gt;&gt; &gt; 40 million, then it's 47 million.   Which is it?  Of those 47 million,
&gt;&gt; &gt; how many are already covered by Medicare and/or SCHIP or some other
&gt;&gt; &gt; program?

&gt;&gt; The one thing we know is that it's far too many people not covered by
&gt;&gt; medical insurance. That's a simple fact. We don't have to settle for
&gt;&gt; Cuba,
&gt;&gt; France etc. in our way of solving this issue. That was an example of how,
&gt;&gt; at
&gt;&gt; the very LEAST we could improve a system that is not working for enough
&gt;&gt; people to justify settling for what we now have. To imagine that we
&gt;&gt; should
&gt;&gt; be happy with having ONLY tens of millions of our own not covered so that
&gt;&gt; greedy pharmaceutical companies do not have to give up their &quot;right&quot; to
&gt;&gt; absurdly high profits doesn't make much sense to me. I support a
&gt;&gt; socialist
&gt;&gt; approach to healthcare in this county because private industry has failed
&gt;&gt; so
&gt;&gt; badly at keeping the majority of of the public informed, healthy and safe
&gt;&gt; from devastating loss due to the costs of treating serious illness. It's
&gt;&gt; time for the lobbyists to be escorted out of our leaders offices so we
&gt;&gt; can
&gt;&gt; start getting real work done on serious issues instead of pushing Viagra
&gt;&gt; over stem cell research. Lead, follow, or get out of the way. We don't
&gt;&gt; need
&gt;&gt; any more hair growth products taking up time and money when real health
&gt;&gt; threats go unchallenged due to the big buck drugs these companies have
&gt;&gt; been
&gt;&gt; working towards.

&gt; For the most part I agree, but don't hang this on the pharmaceutical
&gt; industry.  For example, name 3 viruses that have ever been cured in
&gt; the history of mankind?  Name two?  Name one?

&gt; How about Tort reform?

&gt; Also, we don't need any more Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, and all of
&gt; the other plethoria of companies trying to make a fast buck because we
&gt; Americans are fat, lazy and stupid.

I don't see where a bait and switch approach helps clarify this discussion.
The bottom line is that some of us won't settle for &quot;shit happens&quot; as
reasoning for today's failed healthcare disaster. We want more and we're
willing to do the math and the foot work to get it.

YES! Just throw it into the grocery basket of that which was not addressed during the last two elections and remember what to expect if you allow another GOP member to take the reins of this nation. It will be all &quot;free trade&quot; at the cost of American workers, manufacturers and laborers jobs, but not one dime for American citizens. No social program will stand if another Gop neo-con candidate is allowed to further suffocate this once great nation. Irving Friedman should have been hung in real life. For God's sake, don't let his ideas of &quot;disaster capitalism&quot; come anymore into fruition than they already are. Naomi Klein's book, The Shock Doctrine spells it all out very clearly and it'll make you soil your shorts if you haven't already seen her interviewed, but it will wake you up and make you damned mad. Don't miss it.

&gt; This article would be more properly titled, &quot;How Hillary sold out to the
&gt; Health Care Industry.
&gt; ---------------------------------------------

&gt; She was persona non grata in the early 1990s, when the then-first lady's
&gt; dramatic health-care reform package went down. These days Hillary
&gt; Clinton is winning raves among health-care-industry groups-and
&gt; attracting their campaign dollars.

&gt; WEB EXCLUSIVE
&gt; By Susannah Meadows
&gt; Newsweek
&gt; Updated: 9:27 a.m. MT Sept 17, 2007

&gt; Sept. 17, 2007 - They were an army of two: Harry and Louise, those
&gt; middle-aged, middle-class icons, frustrated that the government was
&gt; limiting their health-care coverage. There they sat at their kitchen
&gt; table, bills strewn before them, an adding machine at hand, despair in
&gt; their souls. Bureaucrats were taking away their freedom-especially one
&gt; named Hillary Clinton.

&gt; Cooked up in 1993 by the health-care-insurance lobby, Harry and Louise
&gt; starred in a series of ads critical of the then-first lady's dramatic
&gt; plan to overhaul the U.S. health-care system. Her proposal for universal
&gt; coverage actually kept private insurers in place, but she favored strict
&gt; regulation-including price caps on insurance premiums. And she wasn't
&gt; going to compromise, not with the insurance companies, not with
&gt; Congress, not with doctors. So Harry and Louise fired back, spooking
&gt; Americans with their veiled references to socialized medicine. The
&gt; fictional pair triumphed in 1994, helping to sink the 1,342-page bill-a
&gt; centerpiece of her husband Bill Clinton's first term.

&gt; Fast-forward 13 years. Hillary has announced a new plan for universal
&gt; health-care coverage-a plan she hopes will help propel her to the
&gt; Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. Surprisingly, her past
&gt; health-care flop has become a significant political asset. Sixty-five
&gt; percent of all voters-and 91 percent of Democrats-are confident that she
&gt; would do the right thing for the health-care system, according to a
&gt; Gallup poll released in July. And the captains of the health-care
&gt; industry who once viewed her as the root of all evil are now filling the
&gt; coffers of her campaign. (Her proposal calls for mandatory
&gt; participation, which the industry tends to favor. But insurance
&gt; companies will also be required not to turn anyone away for pre-existing
&gt; conditions under Clinton's new plan.) As of the first quarter of 2007
&gt; she was the recipient of more health-care-industry donations than any
&gt; presidential candidate-Democrat or Republican-according to a recent
&gt; study by the Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy. Even
&gt; Charles Kahn, who, as executive vice president of the Health Insurance
&gt; Association of America, orchestrated the Harry and Louise ad campaign,
&gt; is hopeful that a President Hillary Clinton would tackle health-care
&gt; reform again. &quot;She knows a lot about health care, she's interested, she
&gt; can speak the language. It's a natural constituency,&quot; says Kahn, who is
&gt; now president of the Federation of American Hospitals and says he met
&gt; with her just a few months ago to talk about the issue.

&gt; How did the woman once demonized by the industry-whose plan was derided
&gt; as &quot;Hillary-care&quot;-become so popular in these parts?

&gt; For starters, it's a matter of realpolitik. As the leading Democratic
&gt; contender running at a time of sagging GOP popularity, she's a good bet
&gt; to win the White House. Health-care companies naturally want a seat at
&gt; the winner's table, regardless of who it is. &quot;These kinds of
&gt; contributions in general follow power and influence, and these groups
&gt; recognize that Sen. Clinton is a serious candidate to be the next
&gt; president,&quot; says Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a
&gt; campaign-finance watchdog group. &quot;They are interested in gaining access
&gt; to people in power of all ideologies in both parties.&quot;

&gt; But Clinton has worked to change her unyielding ways. Her effort in the
&gt; early 1990s was doomed in part by her rigid, aggressive approach; she
&gt; now says she's learned from that experience. She frequently talks about
&gt; how she now understands that change must be incremental and that
&gt; cooperation is the only way to get anything done. People in the industry
&gt; have noticed the difference. &quot;In 1993 we had meetings with [Hillary's
&gt; health-care task force leader] Ira Magaziner, but he turned his hearing
&gt; aid off. There was no negotiation, no give and take,&quot; says Kahn. But she
&gt; has a more open approach now. She's doing all the right things. She's
&gt; talking to people, listening to people. She says, 'I've learned a lot.'
&gt; All one can do is take her at her word.&quot;

&gt; She has also worked hard to win her former critics over-soliciting their
&gt; views and taking their advice. In July she invited several prominent
&gt; health-care-industry officials to meet with her and members of her
&gt; campaign and legislative staff, says Dr. Bruce Bagley of the American
&gt; Academy of Family Physicians, who was one of the attendees. Bagley noted
&gt; how different things seemed. &quot;Back in '93 it was a fairly closed
&gt; process. It seemed like this big black box that finally came up with a
&gt; plan,&quot; he says. This time she asked the group what her health-care
&gt; quality message should be-and spent two hours listening to their ideas,
&gt; key elements of which ended up in a health-care speech she subsequently
&gt; delivered in New Hampshire. &quot;For the most part, it was consistent with
&gt; what we were trying to promote,&quot; he says of the speech. After the
&gt; meeting Bagley got a personally signed thank-you note from the senator.
&gt; And after the speech he got a hand-written note on her own stationery
&gt; thanking him for having vetted her remarks beforehand. &quot;As you know,
&gt; improving the quality of health care that patients receive is
&gt; fundamental to a reformed healthcare system, and I am committed to
&gt; ensuring it as part of my agenda for covering all Americans,&quot; Clinton
&gt; wrote. Bagley says hasn't heard from any of the other presidential
&gt; candidates.

&gt; The American Medical Association also reports a warming trend. The group
&gt; was frustrated by how she handled the process in '93 but now finds her
&gt; staff regularly reaching out to consult. In a speech she gave to the AMA
&gt; in early 2006, the group was pleasantly surprised to hear her give voice
&gt; to many of its top priorities. &quot;Physicians should have a payment .&quot; she
&gt; said, before being interrupted by thundering applause. &quot;Physicians
&gt; should have a payment structure that doesn't result in year after year
&gt; of significant and unsustainable cuts when we all know health-care costs
&gt; are increasing.&quot; Fighting cuts in Medicare payments was a priority for
&gt; the AMA in 2006 and remains so today.

&gt; But Clinton isn't just talking the talk. Health-care groups say they
&gt; have been encouraged by her work in the Senate-where she's taken a more
&gt; restrained and incremental approach. In the '90s she thought she could
&gt; elbow past members of Congress. But since becoming one herself, she has
&gt; made a point of joining forces with Republicans on health-care issues.
&gt; Together they've worked to expand coverage for veterans and children, as
&gt; well as to modernize the system with electronic, rather than paper,
&gt; medical records. Her former foes in the industry have taken note. &quot;Since
&gt; becoming a senator, she's been focused on quality improvement, safety
&gt; improvement, comparative effective analysis. We support all of that,&quot;
&gt; says Karen Ignagni, CEO of American Health Insurance Plans, the
&gt; health-insurance industry trade group. This year AHIP, whose lobbyists
&gt; are in constant contact with Clinton's staff, put forward its own plan
&gt; for universal coverage, which Ignagni says got a positive response from
&gt; the senator's office.

&gt; She's made nice with the pharmaceutical industry, too. Big Pharma's
&gt; lobbyists are constantly engaged with her staff, as they are with other
&gt; members of Congress. &quot;Hillary recognizes the important role of
&gt; employer-provided health insurance and the important role of private
&gt; markets in insuring the people in the country,&quot; says Billy Tauzin, the
&gt; president of PhRMA (the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
&gt; America, a trade group for the industry), who voted against her first
&gt; plan when he was a member of Congress. &quot;I take comfort in that.&quot;

&gt; Clinton has also benefited from a growing public appetite for reform.
&gt; There are now 47 million people without health insurance in America,
&gt; compared to 40 million in 1993. Those who are covered have seen their
&gt; insurance premiums double. Voters are now much more anxious-and better
&gt; informed-about health care, making it a potent issue in the coming
&gt; election. &quot;In the 1990s, when Hillary first came out with the plan, the
&gt; average Joe thought, 'I'll always get health care.' Right now there's
&gt; scarcity,&quot; says Mary Kate Scott, of Scott &amp; Co., which does health-care
&gt; consulting. &quot;We actually feel the pain.&quot;

&gt; The industry does too. In the last decade and a half, its own costs have
&gt; ballooned, and the legions of uninsured people are an ever-increasing
&gt; burden on the system. Health-care groups say they're now looking for
&gt; solutions, and ready to talk. &quot;The sun and moon have aligned,&quot; says
&gt; Kahn. Adds Mike Bromberg, a lobbyist who helped kill the Clinton plan in
&gt; the early 1990s: &quot;There's a shift in the health community. There are
&gt; more people in health care who don't seem as concerned about government
&gt; program expansion anymore. When they're facing bad debts and all the
&gt; uninsured patients, they'd rather have something than nothing.&quot;

&gt; But there's a downside to her careful courtship of the industry. Her
&gt; chief rivals for the Democratic nomination, Barack Obama and John
&gt; Edwards, have repeatedly blasted her for accepting contributions from
&gt; federal lobbyists. (On

My healthcare has never been so good as under this administration. I
don't want to FIX it. Seniors have never had it so good! It isn't
broken. What would help is to stop the lobbyists who drive the cost of
drugs up and keep them out of reach for many Americans. Nobody pays
what we pay for drugs in America. It is an outrage! And it sounds like
Hillary is in bed with them!

&gt; dramatic health-care reform package went down. These days Hillary
&gt; Clinton is winning raves among health-care-industry groups-and
&gt; attracting their campaign dollars.

&gt; WEB EXCLUSIVE
&gt; By Susannah Meadows
&gt; Newsweek
&gt; Updated: 9:27 a.m. MT Sept 17, 2007

&gt; Sept. 17, 2007 - They were an army of two: Harry and Louise, those
&gt; middle-aged, middle-class icons, frustrated that the government was
&gt; limiting their health-care coverage. There they sat at their kitchen
&gt; table, bills strewn before them, an adding machine at hand, despair in
&gt; their souls. Bureaucrats were taking away their freedom-especially one
&gt; named Hillary Clinton.

&gt; Cooked up in 1993 by the health-care-insurance lobby, Harry and Louise
&gt; starred in a series of ads critical of the then-first lady's dramatic
&gt; plan to overhaul the U.S. health-care system. Her proposal for universal
&gt; coverage actually kept private insurers in place, but she favored strict
&gt; regulation-including price caps on insurance premiums. And she wasn't
&gt; going to compromise, not with the insurance companies, not with
&gt; Congress, not with doctors. So Harry and Louise fired back, spooking
&gt; Americans with their veiled references to socialized medicine. The
&gt; fictional pair triumphed in 1994, helping to sink the 1,342-page bill-a
&gt; centerpiece of her husband Bill Clinton's first term.

&gt; Fast-forward 13 years. Hillary has announced a new plan for universal
&gt; health-care coverage-a plan she hopes will help propel her to the
&gt; Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. Surprisingly, her past
&gt; health-care flop has become a significant political asset. Sixty-five
&gt; percent of all voters-and 91 percent of Democrats-are confident that she
&gt; would do the right thing for the health-care system, according to a
&gt; Gallup poll released in July. And the captains of the health-care
&gt; industry who once viewed her as the root of all evil are now filling the
&gt; coffers of her campaign. (Her proposal calls for mandatory
&gt; participation, which the industry tends to favor. But insurance
&gt; companies will also be required not to turn anyone away for pre-existing
&gt; conditions under Clinton's new plan.) As of the first quarter of 2007
&gt; she was the recipient of more health-care-industry donations than any
&gt; presidential candidate-Democrat or Republican-according to a recent
&gt; study by the Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy. Even
&gt; Charles Kahn, who, as executive vice president of the Health Insurance
&gt; Association of America, orchestrated the Harry and Louise ad campaign,
&gt; is hopeful that a President Hillary Clinton would tackle health-care
&gt; reform again. &quot;She knows a lot about health care, she's interested, she
&gt; can speak the language. It's a natural constituency,&quot; says Kahn, who is
&gt; now president of the Federation of American Hospitals and says he met
&gt; with her just a few months ago to talk about the issue.

&gt; How did the woman once demonized by the industry-whose plan was derided
&gt; as &quot;Hillary-care&quot;-become so popular in these parts?

&gt; For starters, it's a matter of realpolitik. As the leading Democratic
&gt; contender running at a time of sagging GOP popularity, she's a good bet
&gt; to win the White House. Health-care companies naturally want a seat at
&gt; the winner's table, regardless of who it is. &quot;These kinds of
&gt; contributions in general follow power and influence, and these groups
&gt; recognize that Sen. Clinton is a serious candidate to be the next
&gt; president,&quot; says Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a
&gt; campaign-finance watchdog group. &quot;They are interested in gaining access
&gt; to people in power of all ideologies in both parties.&quot;

&gt; But Clinton has worked to change her unyielding ways. Her effort in the
&gt; early 1990s was doomed in part by her rigid, aggressive approach; she
&gt; now says she's learned from that experience. She frequently talks about
&gt; how she now understands that change must be incremental and that
&gt; cooperation is the only way to get anything done. People in the industry
&gt; have noticed the difference. &quot;In 1993 we had meetings with [Hillary's
&gt; health-care task force leader] Ira Magaziner, but he turned his hearing
&gt; aid off. There was no negotiation, no give and take,&quot; says Kahn. But she
&gt; has a more open approach now. She's doing all the right things. She's
&gt; talking to people, listening to people. She says, 'I've learned a lot.'
&gt; All one can do is take her at her word.&quot;

&gt; She has also worked hard to win her former critics over-soliciting their
&gt; views and taking their advice. In July she invited several prominent
&gt; health-care-industry officials to meet with her and members of her
&gt; campaign and legislative staff, says Dr. Bruce Bagley of the American
&gt; Academy of Family Physicians, who was one of the attendees. Bagley noted
&gt; how different things seemed. &quot;Back in '93 it was a fairly closed
&gt; process. It seemed like this big black box that finally came up with a
&gt; plan,&quot; he says. This time she asked the group what her health-care
&gt; quality message should be-and spent two hours listening to their ideas,
&gt; key elements of which ended up in a health-care speech she subsequently
&gt; delivered in New Hampshire. &quot;For the most part, it was consistent with
&gt; what we were trying to promote,&quot; he says of the speech. After the
&gt; meeting Bagley got a personally signed thank-you note from the senator.
&gt; And after the speech he got a hand-written note on her own stationery
&gt; thanking him for having vetted her remarks beforehand. &quot;As you know,
&gt; improving the quality of health care that patients receive is
&gt; fundamental to a reformed healthcare system, and I am committed to
&gt; ensuring it as part of my agenda for covering all Americans,&quot; Clinton
&gt; wrote. Bagley says hasn't heard from any of the other presidential
&gt; candidates.

&gt; The American Medical Association also reports a warming trend. The group
&gt; was frustrated by how she handled the process in '93 but now finds her
&gt; staff regularly reaching out to consult. In a speech she gave to the AMA
&gt; in early 2006, the group was pleasantly surprised to hear her give voice
&gt; to many of its top priorities. &quot;Physicians should have a payment .&quot; she
&gt; said, before being interrupted by thundering applause. &quot;Physicians
&gt; should have a payment structure that doesn't result in year after year
&gt; of significant and unsustainable cuts when we all know health-care costs
&gt; are increasing.&quot; Fighting cuts in Medicare payments was a priority for
&gt; the AMA in 2006 and remains so today.

&gt; But Clinton isn't just talking the talk. Health-care groups say they
&gt; have been encouraged by her work in the Senate-where she's taken a more
&gt; restrained and incremental approach. In the '90s she thought she could
&gt; elbow past members of Congress. But since becoming one herself, she has
&gt; made a point of joining forces with Republicans on health-care issues.
&gt; Together they've worked to expand coverage for veterans and children, as
&gt; well as to modernize the system with electronic, rather than paper,
&gt; medical records. Her former foes in the industry have taken note. &quot;Since
&gt; becoming a senator, she's been focused on quality improvement, safety
&gt; improvement, comparative effective analysis. We support all of that,&quot;
&gt; says Karen Ignagni, CEO of American Health Insurance Plans, the
&gt; health-insurance industry trade group. This year AHIP, whose lobbyists
&gt; are in constant contact with Clinton's staff, put forward its own plan
&gt; for universal coverage, which Ignagni says got a positive response from
&gt; the senator's office.

&gt; She's made nice with the pharmaceutical industry, too. Big Pharma's
&gt; lobbyists are constantly engaged with her staff, as they are with other
&gt; members of Congress. &quot;Hillary recognizes the important role of
&gt; employer-provided health insurance and the important role of private
&gt; markets in insuring the people in the country,&quot; says Billy Tauzin, the
&gt; president of PhRMA (the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
&gt; America, a trade group for the industry), who voted against her first
&gt; plan when he was a member of Congress. &quot;I take comfort in that.&quot;

&gt; Clinton has also benefited from a growing public appetite for reform.
&gt; There are now 47 million people without health insurance in America,
&gt; compared to 40 million in 1993. Those who are covered have seen their
&gt; insurance premiums double. Voters are now much more anxious-and better
&gt; informed-about health care, making it a potent issue in the coming
&gt; election. &quot;In the 1990s, when Hillary first came out with the plan, the
&gt; average Joe thought, 'I'll always get health care.' Right now there's
&gt; scarcity,&quot; says Mary Kate Scott, of Scott &amp; Co., which does health-care
&gt; consulting. &quot;We actually feel the pain.&quot;

&gt; The industry does too. In the last decade and a half, its own costs have
&gt; ballooned, and the legions of uninsured people are an ever-increasing
&gt; burden on the system. Health-care groups say they're now looking for
&gt; solutions, and ready to talk. &quot;The sun and moon have aligned,&quot; says
&gt; Kahn. Adds Mike Bromberg, a lobbyist who helped kill the Clinton plan in
&gt; the early 1990s: &quot;There's a shift in the health community. There are
&gt; more people in health care who don't seem as concerned

&gt; YES! Just throw it into the grocery basket of that which was not
&gt; addressed during the last two elections and remember what to expect
&gt; if you allow another GOP member to take the reins of this nation. It
&gt; will be all &quot;free trade&quot; at the cost of American workers,
&gt; manufacturers and laborers jobs, but not one dime for American
&gt; citizens. No social program will stand if another Gop neo-con
&gt; candidate is allowed to further suffocate this once great nation.
&gt; Irving Friedman should have been hung in real life. For God's sake,
&gt; don't let his ideas of &quot;disaster capitalism&quot; come anymore into
&gt; fruition than they already are. Naomi Klein's book, The Shock
&gt; Doctrine spells it all out very clearly and it'll make you soil your
&gt; shorts if you haven't already seen her interviewed, but it will wake
&gt; you up and make you damned mad. Don't miss it.

I agree, but I also say don't look to Hillary for much help on any of
this. She is already bought and paid for and she will do their bidding.

Dear Paul,
I just can't make up my mind. Here's Bush with his genius ideas of
dynamic change for health care, Hillary who is an obvious socialist, and all
the others who don't want to get sucked in to any answer before being
elected. Is four enough? Is six too many? What's a mother to do?
