"/> They were made around the turn of the century, and cost a BUNDLE
to have shipped. Check the local salvage yards and plumbing
suppliers and work your way outward from your home town.

"/> Back before Christmas I saw one of these tubs at an antique mall. I
won't be able to go until Tuesday, but I could go see how much they want
for it (if it's still there, of course).

I'll give you my two pieces of advise from a few years of dealing in
vintage clawfoot tubs. Don't buy one without feet assuming you will be
able to easily find feet. There were a large number of makers, and few
of the feet will interchange. Of course, to get a wooden rim tub, you
might have to take one without and use the modern substitute which is a
metal rectangle that a new foot attaches to and supports the tub.
Second, there is one product for dealing with the usual stains and scale
in many of the old tubs. It's called DElete GERM, labeled just like
that. I don't know what's in it, but it beats CRL, muriatic acid, and
everything else by a mile. Ace Hardware keeps it around here.

"/> this is especially important to note since lots of folks think they can just buy
the footless tub the farmer has been using as a watering trought for his horses
or cattle...important if one plans to use the tub for intended purpose...

I sold an extra tub I had to a guy to planned to use it as the basis for his
water garden....In that situation, the feet weren't of any importance...

Why is it that you folks only come around when I'm not here? My breath?
Body odor? Something I said? I'm starting to take this personally.
