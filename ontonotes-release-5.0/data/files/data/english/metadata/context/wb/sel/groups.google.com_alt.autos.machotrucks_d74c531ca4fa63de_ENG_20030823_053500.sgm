What is the single most thing you can add to a truck to give it peak
performance other than nitrous?
I'm guessing a supercharger, but is there a cheaper way to get good budget
horse that makes a noticeable difference??

Well the Best Biggest Improvement you can make is a Supercharger. The
Cheap way to go is Nitrous. Since you ruled both of those out. Nothing
you add on is going to give so such a big Performance boost as those. You
can do things like adding a Performance Exhaust and Intake setup for better
flow for more horsepower. Possibly a power programmer for a little more.
To do those 3 things you'd be looking at around a grand. Possibly add some
headers for a little more HP.

what is the truck in question? are we talking a v6 Dakota? or a 3500 Ram
with a Cummins? OR by the looks of the cross posting, It can be anything. We
need more details here. What truck, what engine, what do you want to do with
it?

dollar for dollar, a supercharger is hard to beat for daily use. Im sure
bottle feeding your ride will give it a nice kick... when you have it
activated. the super is always there. And don't forget Turbo! I think there
MIGHT be one company that makes a Turbo kit for the Ram.
Also try looking at Cams. If you get some nice headers, Ported intake. or
even an M-1 (if you have a 5.2 or 5.9 Dodge). then get the computer remapped
to take full advantage.

OR if you have $10k sitting around, just get a 528 HEMI. 650HP out of the
crate.

but if you get some higher gears, AND a super, AND nitrous AND stroke it.
then you will be golden. ;-)

"/> Nope.
Headers will help, but not in a way that you can feel in your seat.
A supercharger will trim about 1 second off of the 1/4-mile time on
the V8 Tundra. Nitrous... obviously the difference is in how high you
dare push it.
Anything else will provide very little improvement.

Well, the cheapest performance add on is Nitrous. The downside to doing
this is a few fold. Besides the obvious of installing all the hardware,
always filling the bottle and it should only be used at wide open throttle.
So, if you where to use it for passing another car or drag racing will
really give you some huge numbers. Remember where horsepower and torque are
applied you need to beef up the entire motor. You maybe can get around this
if you have a newer motor and you keep the power in the bottle at 100-300 Hp
shot. I will say if you go this direction, please use a separate arming
switches that the deploy button. The best trigger button is having it under
the gas peddle so you cannot accidentally trigger it at idle for an example.
I would also suggest one more safety item, please leave the bottle blue. If
you are ever in an accident (heaven forbid), every response team will know
exactly what is on board.

The other dollar for dollar is indeed a supercharger. Most are
expensive, but it will give you good HP and TQ. On average you should be
able to get a 100 hp with just bolting on. Not knowing what motor I cannot
give you more HP@Rpm. Most places give out numbers of 30-40 percent increase
over what you make stock. When looking for more power there is a double edge
sword. The hardest thing to do is figure how much money you want to put
into your motor as a supercharger can bolt onto any motor in a weekend, but
remember a motor is nothing more than a air pump, so the more air/fuel that
will be pushed into your motor the better. When you are getting the air/fuel
stuffed into each cylinder the more power is made. One last thing going back
to the motor, what needs to be considered. You really should keep your
compression ratio to 8:1-8.8:1 or your motor if you any detonation there is
a really good chance of putting a hole in a piston. Just on a reminder on
what should be area's of concern:

1)low compression
2)a camshaft with very low overlap, like a stock or RV cam
3)Use very high quality gaskets such as Felpro

Off the top of my head this should cover the major parts. The motor in
my Chevy was built for a blower, but after getting some bad gas I decided
not to put it on. If you do decide to use a supercharger, I am very impress
with the centrifugal blowers like Paxton for a very slick look and it does
not heat up there air coming in.

When all is said and done, my approach would be cubic inches. So, you
might find a big block will give you all the power you want. If this is
going on or in a newer truck and you are still in warranty, you might just
have to wait or they may except certain blowers that legal in all the
States. I do believe most of the centrifugal are.

&gt;&gt; How about a GMPP crate motor? For the cost of a blower, you can get a ZZ4. See  www.sallee-chevrolet.com  for specs and prices.

planning on installing the ATI Pro-Charger with a claimed 55% increase
