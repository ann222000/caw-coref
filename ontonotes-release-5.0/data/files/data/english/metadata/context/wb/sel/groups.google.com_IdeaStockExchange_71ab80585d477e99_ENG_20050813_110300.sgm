This website will become an online debate forum that uses principles learned from the stock market (the survival of the fittest principle), and thousands of years of failure of conflict resolution. This website gives an explanation of what this would look like and an example of how it would work.

I am looking for feedback on my website. It is kind of a business idea of mine. I way of making money by advertising, online dating, and other stuff later on. It is kind of a debate forum. I would like it to be like Google, but instead of ranking pages, we will rank ideas. I would need some help with people who know web design and programming better than I do.

Once you get to an idea, you should immediately see a difference between this and other discussion boards.

I would like to create a better framework in which each idea can be analyzed.

When I was young, my parents taught me that when I wanted to make a decision, I should make a list of reasons to agree or disagree with an idea. I would like to organize all of these list than anyone has ever made, on any subject, onto one website.

I have submitted reasons to agree or disagree with some of the positions.

As soon as I think I have gone as far as I can go, I will try and get my family and friends to submit their ideas, and reasons to agree or disagree with them. After that I will try and open it up to the general public.

Best: criteria for measuring

Popularity

Universal appeal

Uniqueness

Does it say something new or does it Say it in a new way

Artistic quality

Play analysis
