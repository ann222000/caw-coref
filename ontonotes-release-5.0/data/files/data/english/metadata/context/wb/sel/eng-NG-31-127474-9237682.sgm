Sola Gratia and Mary's Immaculate Conception

By Edward T. Oakes, S.J.
Monday, November 26, 2007, 7:24 AM

The project known as Evangelicals and Catholics Together is now in its
thirteenth year--following its initial statement, &quot;The Christian
Mission in the Third Millennium,&quot; with much-discussed statements on
salvation, Scripture, and the Communion of Saints.

The group is currently engaged in studying what can be said together
about the Blessed Virgin Mary, and a number of participants were asked
to prepare preliminary papers. With the permission of the authors, we
will be posting five of these papers over the next five days--papers by
Edward T. Oakes, J.I. Packer, T.M. Moore, Matthew Levering, and
Cornelius Plantinga.--eds.

Protestants and Catholics differ across a range of issues, but never
more obviously than over the Catholic doctrine that the mother of
Jesus was immaculately conceived, meaning that from her conception on
she was free from sin, very much including from the &quot;stain&quot; of
original sin (&quot;immaculate&quot; = without stain). But even those who
disagree with the doctrine can admit its meaning: the grace given to
Mary is above all the premier example of the grace of meritless
predestination.

This absence of merit on Mary's part is obviously no mere concession
to the Protestant stress on sola gratia but is required by the very
meaning of the words immaculate and conception. Since this grace
became operative at the very inception of her existence, it had to
come to her prior to any deeds she might later perform. Furthermore,
the doctrine explicitly states that the grace of the Immaculate
Conception was given to Mary in view of the later merits of Christ. As
Pope Pius IX says in his encyclical solemnly defining the doctrine for
Catholics, Ineffabilis Deus, &quot;To the glory of the holy and undivided
Trinity, to the honor and renown of the Virgin, . . . the most Blessed
Virgin Mary was, from the first moment of her conception, by a
singular grace and privilege of almighty God and in view of the merits
of Christ Jesus the Savior of the human race, preserved immune from
all stain of original sin.&quot;

But Pius IX also makes clear that, although singular, this grace was
not given to Mary purely for her own glorification but to effect a
turning point in salvation history:

&quot;I will put enmity between you and the woman.&quot; In these words the
Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary was announced to our
first parents. It was to be the reversal of the friendship with the
serpent contracted by Eve, when she listened to his voice and fell
under his power. The second Eve was never to be under the power of the
devil; the enmity between them was to admit of no possible exception.
This involved the grace of being conceived immaculate. Mary's
Immaculate Conception was the foundation of all her graces. The
absence of any stain or spot of sin distinguished her from all the
rest of mankind. It distinguished her from the holiest of the Saints,
since they, one and all, were sinners. Her perfect sinlessness was the
source of all her glory and all her majesty; it was this which opened
the door to the unlimited graces that she received from God; it was
this that qualified her for her divine maternity and raised her to the
throne as Queen of heaven. (emphases in the original)

In other words, Mary is the perfect example of sola gratia at work:
Everything she later did and was given came from this first grace of
predestination, won for her purely and entirely by the merits of
Christ, not her own; and even those &quot;merits&quot; she &quot;earned&quot; came from
the graces given her aboriginally, in view of her predestined status
as the chosen Mother of the Savior. As Pius IX clearly asserts, by a
venerable exegetical tradition dating from patristic times, she was
predestined to be sinless when God spoke thus to the Serpent in the
Garden of Eden after our first parents' first sin: &quot;I will put enmity
between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He shall
bruise your dead, and you shall bruise his heel&quot; (Genesis 3:15).

By placing the promise of Mary's sinlessness in the Garden, Pius
definitively altered the usual perspective on what predestination
means. Unlike both Protestant and Catholic views of predestination in
the Augustinian tradition (which tends to see predestination in terms
of the fate of the individual soul at the end of time), recent
Catholic mariological thought picks up on Pius IX's salvation-
historical perspective by interpreting Mary's predestined status to be
the mother of the Lord as part of God's wider intentions for the
world. For example, in his essay &quot;The Sign of the Woman,&quot; located in
his book Mary: The Church at the Source (coauthored with Hans Urs von
Balthasar), Cardinal Ratzinger speaks this way:

The Fathers saw God's words of punishment to the serpent after the
Fall as a first promise of the Redeemer--an allusion to the Descendent
[Seed, Offspring] that bruises the serpent's head. There has never
been a moment in history without a gospel. At the very moment of the
Fall, the promise also begins. The Fathers also attached importance to
the fact that Christology and Mariology are inseparably interwoven
already from this primordial beginning. The first promise of Christ,
which stands in a chiaroscuro and which only the light to come finally
deciphers, is a promise to and through the woman. (emphases added)

In other words, Mary is wholly enclosed within the biblical narrative
of God's dispensation to his people, an insight deftly caught by Dante
when he places on the lips of St. Bernard of Clairvaux this address to
Mary: &quot;Virgin Mother, daughter of your Son&quot; (Paradiso), a coinage that
forms a nice chiasmus to another of her titles, &quot;Mother of God.&quot;

The juxtaposition of these two titles points to an important feature
of all authentic Mariology, one already touched on by Pius IX in
Ineffabilis Deus: the circularity of cause and effect in the
dispensation of salvation. By that I mean, Mary could not be kept free
from sin except by the merits of Christ won on the cross; but of
course Christ could not have entered history to save us by dying on
the cross except by the free consent of Mary, whose free assent to the
angel was a truly graced assent vouchsafed by the future death of her
Son. The implications of this circularity can be dizzying, but they
are helpfully elucidated by Hans Urs von Balthasar in this passage in
the third volume of Theo-Drama:

In the course of unfolding these implications, two difficulties
were encountered that have occupied theology right up to medieval and
modern times. The first arose from the realizing that God's action in
reconciling the world to himself in the Cross of Christ is exclusively
his initiative; there is no original &quot;collaboration&quot; between God and
the creature. But as we have already said, the creature's &quot;femininity&quot;
possesses an original, God-given, active fruitfulness; it was
essential, therefore, if God's Word willed to become incarnate in the
womb of a woman, to elicit the latter's agreement and obedient
consent. . . . God could not violate his creature's freedom. But where
did the grace that made this consent possible come from--a consent that
is adequate and therefore genuinely unlimited--if not from the work of
reconciliation itself, that is, from the Cross? (And the Cross is
rendered possible only through Mary's consent.) Here we have a circle--
in which the effect [Dante's &quot;daughter of her Son&quot;] is the cause of
the cause [Mother of God]--that has taken centuries to appreciate and
formulate, resulting in the dogma of the Immaculate Conception and the
exact reasoning behind it.

It is my thesis that ecumenical discussion of the dogma of the
Immaculate Conception must begin with a recognition of this important
circularity of cause/effect surrounding the Incarnation. The need for
constant meditation on this circularity, requiring centuries for its
full implications to become clear, is probably the reason that Thomas
Aquinas erred when he denied that Mary was immaculately conceived--
because the development of doctrine had not reached the point where
this circularity was fully appreciated. On the one hand, Thomas
rightly says in De Veritate: &quot;It was not right that so great a benefit
[the Incarnation] be granted without consent.&quot;

Yet he did not think through fully the implications of what kind of
consent Mary could give if it had been, however slightly, affected/
infected by original sin. But if, as part of its logic, the cross
itself is made possible only through Mary's consent at the
Annunciation (which Luke clearly holds), then the implications of the
denial of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception should become clear.
For such a denial would then make our very salvation dependent on
Mary's free will operating independent of grace. Her Yes to God would
have had to have been made, even if ever so slightly, under her own
power, which would have the intolerable implication of making the
entire drama of salvation hinge on a human work--the very apogee of
Pelagianism.

The dogma of the Immaculate Conception also has implications for
ecumenical dialogue regarding the nature of the Church (ecclesiology).
For once the full dimensions of this dogma are understood as the
premier instance of sola gratia, then we can begin to understand how
the Church, too, has been predestined to be &quot;without stain or wrinkle
or any other blemish, but holy and blameless&quot; (Eph. 5:27). John the
Divine speaks of the Church as the bride ready for marriage: &quot;She has
been able to dress herself in dazzling white linen, because her linen
is made of the good deeds of the saints&quot; (Rev. 19:8). Protestants
rightly interpret these passages about the immaculate nature of the
Church as being the result entirely of Christ's work

For what it's worth, I don't care what Pope Pius IX has to say about
Mary.  I do care what the Bible has to say about her.  And that is
very little other than she was the young mother chosen to be Jesus
mother.  Sinless?  No!  For all have sinned and fallen short of the
glory of God.

Utter arrant cock! why don't you take this superstitious rubbish
and peddle it to somone who is as stupid and delusional as you
obviously are. This is not worth serious discussion since it is
taken from the false teachings of catholicism.
Anyone who really believes this rubbish needs to visit the
Funny Farm where they will be happy to sedate you till you get
over it. GROW UP! and get a worth-while life and stop deluding
yourself and more importantly stop tring to flog it here.
I for one do not wish to have this carbage rammed down my
proverbial throat. This sit is not for preaching. it is for SERIOUS
discussion of factual content, this crap has not the beginnings
of integrity in it anywhere, so go and stuff it elsewhere.

&gt; reconciliation itself, that is, from the Cross? (And the Cross is
&gt; rendered possible only through Mary's consent.) Here we have a circle--
&gt; in which the effect [Dante's &quot;daughter of her Son&quot;] is the cause of
&gt; the cause [Mother of God]--that has taken centuries to appreciate and
&gt; formulate, resulting in the dogma of the Immaculate Conception and the
&gt; exact reasoning behind it.

&gt; It is my thesis that ecumenical discussion of the dogma of the
&gt; Immaculate Conception must begin with a recognition of this important
&gt; circularity of cause/effect surrounding the Incarnation. The need for
&gt; constant meditation on this circularity, requiring centuries for its
&gt; full implications to become clear, is probably the reason that Thomas
&gt; Aquinas erred when he denied that Mary was immaculately conceived--
&gt; because the development of doctrine had not reached the point where
&gt; this circularity was fully appreciated. On the one hand, Thomas
&gt; rightly says in De Veritate: &quot;It was not right that so great a benefit
&gt; [the Incarnation] be granted without consent.&quot;

&gt; Yet he did not think through fully the implications of what kind of
&gt; consent Mary could give if it had been, however slightly, affected/
&gt; infected by original sin. But if, as part of its logic, the cross
&gt; itself is made possible only through Mary's consent at the
&gt; Annunciation (which Luke clearly holds), then the implications of the
&gt; denial of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception should become clear.

&gt; &gt; Sola Gratia and Mary's Immaculate Conception

&gt; &gt; By Edward T. Oakes, S.J.
&gt; &gt; Monday, November 26, 2007, 7:24 AM

&gt; &gt; The project known as Evangelicals and Catholics Together is now in its
&gt; &gt; thirteenth year--following its initial statement, &quot;The Christian
&gt; &gt; Mission in the Third Millennium,&quot; with much-discussed statements on
&gt; &gt; salvation, Scripture, and the Communion of Saints.

&gt; &gt; The group is currently engaged in studying what can be said together
&gt; &gt; about the Blessed Virgin Mary, and a number of participants were asked
&gt; &gt; to prepare preliminary papers. With the permission of the authors, we
&gt; &gt; will be posting five of these papers over the next five days--papers by
&gt; &gt; Edward T. Oakes, J.I. Packer, T.M. Moore, Matthew Levering, and
&gt; &gt; Cornelius Plantinga.--eds.

&gt; &gt; Protestants and Catholics differ across a range of issues, but never
&gt; &gt; more obviously than over the Catholic doctrine that the mother of
&gt; &gt; Jesus was immaculately conceived, meaning that from her conception on
&gt; &gt; she was free from sin, very much including from the &quot;stain&quot; of
&gt; &gt; original sin (&quot;immaculate&quot; = without stain). But even those who
&gt; &gt; disagree with the doctrine can admit its meaning: the grace given to
&gt; &gt; Mary is above all the premier example of the grace of meritless
&gt; &gt; predestination.

&gt; &gt; This absence of merit on Mary's part is obviously no mere concession
&gt; &gt; to the Protestant stress on sola gratia but is required by the very
&gt; &gt; meaning of the words immaculate and conception. Since this grace
&gt; &gt; became operative at the very inception of her existence, it had to
&gt; &gt; come to her prior to any deeds she might later perform. Furthermore,
&gt; &gt; the doctrine explicitly states that the grace of the Immaculate
&gt; &gt; Conception was given to Mary in view of the later merits of Christ. As
&gt; &gt; Pope Pius IX says in his encyclical solemnly defining the doctrine for
&gt; &gt; Catholics, Ineffabilis Deus, &quot;To the glory of the holy and undivided
&gt; &gt; Trinity, to the honor and renown of the Virgin, . . . the most Blessed
&gt; &gt; Virgin Mary was, from the first moment of her conception, by a
&gt; &gt; singular grace and privilege of almighty God and in view of the merits
&gt; &gt; of Christ Jesus the Savior of the human race, preserved immune from
&gt; &gt; all stain of original sin.&quot;

&gt; &gt; But Pius IX also makes clear that, although singular, this grace was
&gt; &gt; not given to Mary purely for her own glorification but to effect a
&gt; &gt; turning point in salvation history:

&gt; &gt;     &quot;I will put enmity between you and the woman.&quot; In these words the
&gt; &gt; Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary was announced to our
&gt; &gt; first parents. It was to be the reversal of the friendship with the
&gt; &gt; serpent contracted by Eve, when she listened to his voice and fell
&gt; &gt; under his power. The second Eve was never to be under the power of the
&gt; &gt; devil; the enmity between them was to admit of no possible exception.
&gt; &gt; This involved the grace of being conceived immaculate. Mary's
&gt; &gt; Immaculate Conception was the foundation of all her graces. The
&gt; &gt; absence of any stain or spot of sin distinguished her from all the
&gt; &gt; rest of mankind. It distinguished her from the holiest of the Saints,
&gt; &gt; since they, one and all, were sinners. Her perfect sinlessness was the
&gt; &gt; source of all her glory and all her majesty; it was this which opened
&gt; &gt; the door to the unlimited graces that she received from God; it was
&gt; &gt; this that qualified her for her divine maternity and raised her to the
&gt; &gt; throne as Queen of heaven. (emphases in the original)

&gt; &gt; In other words, Mary is the perfect example of sola gratia at work:
&gt; &gt; Everything she later did and was given came from this first grace of
&gt; &gt; predestination, won for her purely and entirely by the merits of
&gt; &gt; Christ, not her own; and even those &quot;merits&quot; she &quot;earned&quot; came from
&gt; &gt; the graces given her aboriginally, in view of her predestined status
&gt; &gt; as the chosen Mother of the Savior. As Pius IX clearly asserts, by a
&gt; &gt; venerable exegetical tradition dating from patristic times, she was
&gt; &gt; predestined to be sinless when God spoke thus to the Serpent in the
&gt; &gt; Garden of Eden after our first parents' first sin: &quot;I will put enmity
&gt; &gt; between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He shall
&gt; &gt; bruise your dead, and you shall bruise his heel&quot; (Genesis 3:15).

&gt; &gt; By placing the promise of Mary's sinlessness in the Garden, Pius
&gt; &gt; definitively altered the usual perspective on what predestination
&gt; &gt; means. Unlike both Protestant and Catholic views of predestination in
&gt; &gt; the Augustinian tradition (which tends to see predestination in terms
&gt; &gt; of the fate of the individual soul at the end of time), recent
&gt; &gt; Catholic mariological thought picks up on Pius IX's salvation-
&gt; &gt; historical perspective by interpreting Mary's predestined status to be
&gt; &gt; the mother of the Lord as part of God's wider intentions for the
&gt; &gt; world. For example, in his essay &quot;The Sign of the Woman,&quot; located in
&gt; &gt; his book Mary: The Church at the Source (coauthored with Hans Urs von
&gt; &gt; Balthasar), Cardinal Ratzinger speaks this way:

&gt; &gt;     The Fathers saw God's words of punishment to the serpent after the
&gt; &gt; Fall as a first promise of the Redeemer--an allusion to the Descendent
&gt; &gt; [Seed, Offspring] that bruises the serpent's head. There has never
&gt; &gt; been a moment in history without a gospel. At the very moment of the
&gt; &gt; Fall, the promise also begins. The Fathers also attached importance to
&gt; &gt; the fact that Christology and Mariology are inseparably interwoven
&gt; &gt; already from this primordial beginning. The first promise of Christ,
&gt; &gt; which stands in a chiaroscuro and which only the light to come finally
&gt; &gt; deciphers, is a promise to and through the woman. (emphases added)

&gt; &gt; In other words, Mary is wholly enclosed within the biblical narrative
&gt; &gt; of God's dispensation to his people, an insight deftly caught by Dante
&gt; &gt; when he places on the lips of St. Bernard of Clairvaux this address to
&gt; &gt; Mary: &quot;Virgin Mother, daughter of your Son&quot; (Paradiso), a coinage that
&gt; &gt; forms a nice chiasmus to another of her titles, &quot;Mother of God.&quot;

&gt; &gt; The juxtaposition of these two titles points to an important feature
&gt; &gt; of all authentic Mariology, one already touched on by Pius IX in
&gt; &gt; Ineffabilis Deus: the circularity of cause and effect in the
&gt; &gt; dispensation of salvation. By that I mean, Mary could not be kept free
&gt; &gt; from sin except by the merits of Christ won on the cross; but of
&gt; &gt; course Christ could not have entered history to save us by dying on
&gt; &gt; the cross except by the free consent of Mary, whose free assent to the
&gt; &gt; angel was a truly graced assent vouchsafed by the future death of her
&gt; &gt; Son. The implications of this circularity can be dizzying, but they
&gt; &gt; are helpfully elucidated by Hans Urs von Balthasar in this passage in
&gt; &gt; the third volume of Theo-Drama:

&gt; &gt;     In the course of unfolding these implications, two difficulties
&gt; &gt; were encountered that have occupied theology right up to medieval and
&gt; &gt; modern times. The first arose from the realizing that God's action in
&gt; &gt; reconciling the world to himself in the Cross of Christ is exclusively
&gt; &gt; his initiative; there is no original &quot;collaboration&quot; between God and
&gt; &gt; the creature. But as we have already said, the creature's &quot;femininity&quot;
&gt; &gt; possesses an original, God-given, active fruitfulness; it was
&gt; &gt; essential, therefore, if God's Word willed to become incarnate in the
&gt; &gt; womb of a woman, to elicit the latter's agreement and obedient
&gt; &gt; consent. . . . God could not violate his creature's freedom. But where
&gt; &gt; did the grace that made this consent possible come from--a consent that
&gt; &gt; is adequate and therefore genuinely unlimited--if not from the work of
&gt; &gt; reconciliation itself, that is, from the Cross? (And the Cross is
&gt; &gt; rendered possible only through Mary's consent.) Here we have a circle--
&gt; &gt; in which the effect [Dante's &quot;daughter of her Son&quot;] is the cause of
&gt; &gt; the cause [Mother of God]--that has taken centuries to appreciate and
&gt; &gt; formulate, resulting in the dogma of the Immaculate Conception and the
&gt; &gt; exact reasoning behind it.

&gt; &gt; It is my thesis that ecumenical discussion of the dogma of the
&gt; &gt; Immaculate Conception must begin with a recognition of this important
&gt; &gt; circularity of cause/effect surrounding the Incarnation. The need for
&gt; &gt; constant meditation on this circularity, requiring centuries for its
&gt; &gt; full implications to become clear, is probably the reason that Thomas
&gt; &gt; Aquinas erred when he denied that Mary was immaculately conceived--
&gt; &gt; because the development of doctrine had not reached the point where
&gt; &gt; this circularity was fully appreciated. On the one hand,

Pelagianism is the doctrine that man can either initiate or complete

Yes, just so.  Now, what about Mary?  Did God require her free consent
for the Incarnation, or do we take the angel's greeting to mean, &quot;this
is going to happen to you whether you want it or not?&quot;  When she spoke
the words, &quot;let it be unto me as you have said,&quot; was that free
rational consent?  Or not?  Would God force one of His creatures,
against her will, to bear His Son?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Pelagianism is the doctrine that man can either initiate or complete

&gt; &gt; &gt; Pelagianism, if only to complete, it is called Semi-Pelagiansim.-

&gt; &gt; God's grace is essential to our salvation.  It is by grace that we are

&gt; Yes, just so.  Now, what about Mary?  Did God require her free consent

I do not doubt that she gave her consent.  But that is a long way from
making the claim that she was born sinless.

&lt;jumps in from the peanut gallery&gt;

Neither her consent nor her sinful (or sin-containing perhaps, to be
more precise) birth are mentioned in the Bible, the supposed
revelation of God. (Unless there is something besides Matt 1:18-22 and
Luke 1:29-38 where it does not appear as if her consent was sought so
much as information of what will happen was given)

Yet you do not doubt that her consent was given, but have reservations
about her sin-containing birth.

Isn't the correct answer in cases of Things That Are Not Revealed
usually: &quot;I do not know&quot;?  If so, what leads you to believe one and
not the other.  This is not even about what you believe and what
someone else believes differently.

I believe the Catholic Faith.  I assume Old Man believes the
Scriptures, as do I.  I equally assume that he knows some things not
written in the Scriptures, for example, Jesus had not only a mother
but a grandmother and a grandfather as well.  Common sense things like
that are usually accepted by those who accept the Scriptures.

Jesus would have come in human form, if not via Mary, then someone
else.  But, since God 'knew' us prior to creation, I do not doubt that
he knew Mary's response ahead of time as well.  Still has nothing to
do with Mary's being sinless.

&gt; I believe the Catholic Faith.  I assume Old Man believes the
&gt; Scriptures, as do I.

But is it not true that as a Catholic, you put the Pope's word on
equal footing with the scriptures?  And if that is true, then we have
different beliefs in the scripture.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  I equally assume that he knows some things not
&gt; written in the Scriptures, for example, Jesus had not only a mother

&gt; that are usually accepted by those who accept the Scriptures.

Would it not be common sense that if Mary could have been sinless,
that everyone else could as well, eliminating the need for a redeemer?

I argued this briefly in my last post, pointing out the verses, but
you did not address it.

God: &quot;will you bear my child?&quot;
Mary: &quot;yes, I will&quot;

would be consent

God's sidekick: &quot;You will bear God's child&quot;
Mary: &quot;How?&quot;
God's sidekick: &quot;It's technical. Suffice it to say, it'll be magical
and holy&quot;
Mary: &quot;I shall comply, for I am his servant&quot;

That's not consent, it is acceptance of one's servitude.

If you disagree, it is OK, I just thought I should point that out.

Yes, which is why I jumped back to the peanut gallery.  Although I'll
probably never understand how such standards are so malleable.  If it
is not quite reasonable to believe that an elected Pope can receive
such revelations, how can we expect that it is still reasonable that
an assembly of men choose what constitutes the canon, or that God
communicates with individuals directing their faith and lives via
private revelation?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I argued this briefly in my last post, pointing out the verses, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; you did not address it.

&gt; &gt; Sorry

&gt; &gt; &gt; God: &quot;will you bear my child?&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mary: &quot;yes, I will&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; would be consent

&gt; &gt; &gt; God's sidekick: &quot;You will bear God's child&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mary: &quot;How?&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; God's sidekick: &quot;It's technical. Suffice it to say, it'll be magical
&gt; &gt; &gt; and holy&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mary: &quot;I shall comply, for I am his servant&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; That's not consent, it is acceptance of one's servitude.

&gt; &gt; &quot;I am the Lord's servant,&quot; Mary answered. &quot;May it be to me as you have
&gt; &gt; said.&quot;

&gt; Yeah, that one.

&gt; &gt; Sounds to me more like &quot;Let's go for it.&quot;

&gt; I'd imagine it has to.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you disagree, it is OK, I just thought I should point that out.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  nor her sinful (or sin-containing perhaps, to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more precise) birth are mentioned in the Bible, the supposed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; revelation of God. (Unless there is something besides Matt 1:18-22 and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Luke 1:29-38 where it does not appear as if her consent was sought so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much as information of what will happen was given)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet you do not doubt that her consent was given, but have reservations
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about her sin-containing birth.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Isn't the correct answer in cases of Things That Are Not Revealed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usually: &quot;I do not know&quot;?  If so, what leads you to believe one and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not the other.  This is not even about what you believe and what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone else believes differently.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is the rub.  Roman Catholics believe in an ongoing revelation via
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Pope that has equal authority as the Bible.  And that is really at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the heart of this discussion.  Because I do not accept that.  Mary's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Immaculate Conception is from the Pope rather than the Bible.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, which is why I jumped back to the peanut gallery.  Although I'll
&gt; &gt; &gt; probably never understand how such standards are so malleable.  If it
&gt; &gt; &gt; is not quite reasonable to believe that an elected Pope can receive
&gt; &gt; &gt; such revelations, how can we expect that it is still reasonable that
&gt; &gt; &gt; an assembly of men choose what constitutes the canon,

&gt; &gt; They really did not.  It was really decided based on comon usage.

&gt; Democratically, or unanimously?

Very little desent.  James, Jude, 2 Peter, 2&amp;3 John and Revelation are
the only ones ever left off of a list that I can find.

Any reason why canonization is important relevant.  That too by people
of centuries past?  I mean if people were capable of discovering for
themselves then, any reason why churches today feel that their flock
will not be able to do the same?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pelagianism, if only to complete, it is called Semi-Pelagiansim.-

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; God's grace is essential to our salvation.  It is by grace that we are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saved.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, just so.  Now, what about Mary?  Did God require her free consent
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the Incarnation, or do we take the angel's greeting to mean, &quot;this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is going to happen to you whether you want it or not?&quot;  When she spoke
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the words, &quot;let it be unto me as you have said,&quot; was that free
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rational consent?  Or not?  Would God force one of His creatures,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; against her will, to bear His Son?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do not doubt that she gave her consent.  But that is a long way from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; making the claim that she was born sinless.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would God have forced her to accept the Incarnation had she not given
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her consent?

&gt; &gt; &gt; In case you missed it in the previous response to this question, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have pasted it here again.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I do not doubt that she gave her consent.  But that is a long way
&gt; &gt; &gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; making the claim that she was born sinless.&quot;

&gt; &gt; I asked you, had she not given her consent, would the Incarnation
&gt; &gt; still have taken place?  I am not saying you doubt she gave her
&gt; &gt; consent.  I am asking you whether there was anything riding on the
&gt; &gt; outcome, like, our whole salvation?

&gt; Jesus would have come in human form, if not via Mary, then someone
&gt; else.  But, since God 'knew' us prior to creation, I do not doubt that
&gt; he knew Mary's response ahead of time as well.  Still has nothing to
&gt; do with Mary's being sinless.
">

Why do you think that if Jesus had not come by Mary He would have come
in any case?  Did God choose Mary from the foundation of the world, or
not?

In Genesis, we read,

Genesis 3:15. I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy
seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in
wait for her heel.

Would an enmity deliberately created by God be relative or absolute?
If, as it seems to me, it would be absolute, then how could Mary be in
any way under Satan's dominion?  That is Pius IX's argument.

(quote)

&quot;I will put enmity between you and the woman.&quot; In these words the
Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary was announced to our
first parents. It was to be the reversal of the friendship with the
serpent contracted by Eve, when she listened to his voice and fell
under his power. The second Eve was never to be under the power of the
devil; the enmity between them was to admit of no possible exception.
This involved the grace of being conceived immaculate.

(end quote)

That is the first part of the argument --- from Scripture.

The second part of the argument involves the heresy of Pelgianism.  If
the archangel Gabriel was sent to a woman to obtain her consent to
bear the Messiah in her womb, then our salvation hinged on that
decision of hers.  Not her own salvation only, but the salvation of
all the world.  She could have refused, and then the Messiah would
never have come.  Unless you want to imagine God going from house to
house, looking for just anyone to be His Mother.  No, we both agree
that it was predestined to be Mary.  God chose her, which is why the
angel said to her &quot;blessed are you among women.&quot;  The angel also
called her &quot;full of grace,&quot; which, in order for God's Salvation to be
entirely His Work, she must have been.  Full in this context literally
means full.

Father Oakes writes,

&quot; . . . If, as part of its logic, the cross
itself is made possible only through Mary's consent at the
Annunciation (which Luke clearly holds), then the implications of the
denial of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception should become clear.
For such a denial would then make our very salvation dependent on
Mary's free will operating independent of grace. Her Yes to God would
have had to have been made, even if ever so slightly, under her own
power, which would have the intolerable implication of making the
entire drama of salvation hinge on a human work--the very apogee of
Pelagianism. &quot;

So, we have the absolute enmity between the woman and the serpent.
Since the serpent's domain is sin, and since the entire purpose of the
Incarnation was to reverse the Fall, then it follows that she who is
the woman in question --- the new Eve --- should be entirely free from
Satan's dominion from the start.  Otherwise, her consent to God would
have been tainted with self-will, and thus would have been, at least
partially, a human work, leading to the intolerable conclusion that
the salvation of the world was at least partially accomplished by
human initiative --- Pelagianism.

There is no question of Mary's having merited such a thing --- before
she was conceived she did not exist to merit anything.  Mary is
entirely the work of Christ.  The merit of her Immaculate Conception
comes entirely from His Cross. Thus does she say, &quot;My soul doth
magnify the Lord.&quot;

Luke 1:46. And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the Lord.
1:47. And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
1:48. Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid: for
behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
1:49. Because he that is mighty hath done great things to me: and holy
is his name.
1:50. And his mercy is from generation unto generations, to them that
fear him.
1:51. He hath showed might in his arm: he hath scattered the proud in
the conceit of their heart.
1:52. He hath put down the mighty from their seat and hath exalted the
humble.
1:53. He hath filled the hungry with good things: and the rich he hath
sent empty away.
1:54. He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful of his mercy.
1:55. As he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham and to his seed for ever.

&gt; equal footing with the scriptures?

No.  Show me that in Catholic Doctrine, and then I will believe it.  I
do not think it is part of the Faith.  Faith in the Scriptures,
however, points to the primacy of Peter.  But you read the Scriptures
your own way.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

What do you believe about the Church of the Scriptures?  Is it one of

though their doctrines conflict?  Was there in fact any question in

Mary could not have been sinless without a Redeemer.  Much less anyone

Try the nativity narrative in Luke.  I know, not Jesus saying it, but
He was kinda little then.  Anyway, Luke identifies the Son of Mary as
the one whom they named Jesus.  So it is pretty clear she was His
Mother.

I don't accept it either.

Thank you Old Man.  That is precisely the case with the Dogma of the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I argued this briefly in my last post, pointing out the verses, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you did not address it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; God: &quot;will you bear my child?&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mary: &quot;yes, I will&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be consent

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; God's sidekick: &quot;You will bear God's child&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mary: &quot;How?&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; God's sidekick: &quot;It's technical. Suffice it to say, it'll be magical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and holy&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mary: &quot;I shall comply, for I am his servant&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's not consent, it is acceptance of one's servitude.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I am the Lord's servant,&quot; Mary answered. &quot;May it be to me as you have
&gt; &gt; &gt; said.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Yeah, that one.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds to me more like &quot;Let's go for it.&quot;

&gt; &gt; I'd imagine it has to.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you disagree, it is OK, I just thought I should point that out.

&gt; Almost unanimously.  There was no question about most of them.  Only
&gt; James, Jude, 2 Peter, 2&amp;3 John and Revelation seemed to have any
&gt; question.  The rest are on every list I have been able to find.

Actually, there was a great big question about the Wisdom Books, which
your boy Luther threw out.  So those are missing from the Protestant

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A little.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you agree that it is heresy?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, just so.  Now, what about Mary?  Did God require her free consent
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the Incarnation, or do we take the angel's greeting to mean, &quot;this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is going to happen to you whether you want it or not?&quot;  When she spoke

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rational consent?  Or not?  Would God force one of His creatures,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; against her will, to bear His Son?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do not doubt that she gave her consent.  But that is a long way from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; making the claim that she was born sinless.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would God have forced her to accept the Incarnation had she not given
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her consent?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In case you missed it in the previous response to this question, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have pasted it here again.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I do not doubt that she gave her consent.  But that is a long way
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; making the claim that she was born sinless.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; I asked you, had she not given her consent, would the Incarnation
&gt; &gt; &gt; still have taken place?  I am not saying you doubt she gave her
&gt; &gt; &gt; consent.  I am asking you whether there was anything riding on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; outcome, like, our whole salvation?

&gt; &gt; Jesus would have come in human form, if not via Mary, then someone
&gt; &gt; else.  But, since God 'knew' us prior to creation, I do not doubt that
&gt; &gt; he knew Mary's response ahead of time as well.  Still has nothing to
&gt; &gt; do with Mary's being sinless.

&gt; Why do you think that if Jesus had not come by Mary He would have come
&gt; in any case?  Did God choose Mary from the foundation of the world, or
&gt; not?

&gt; In Genesis, we read,

&gt; Genesis 3:15. I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy
&gt; seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in
&gt; wait for her heel.

&gt; Would an enmity deliberately created by God be relative or absolute?
&gt; If, as it seems to me, it would be absolute, then how could Mary be in
&gt; any way under Satan's dominion?  That is Pius IX's argument.

&gt;   &quot;I will put enmity between you and the woman.&quot; In these words the
&gt; Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary was announced to our
&gt; first parents. It was to be the reversal of the friendship with the
&gt; serpent contracted by Eve, when she listened to his voice and fell
&gt; under his power. The second Eve was never to be under the power of the
&gt; devil; the enmity between them was to admit of no possible exception.
&gt; This involved the grace of being conceived immaculate.

&gt; (end quote)

&gt; That is the first part of the argument --- from Scripture.

&gt; The second part of the argument involves the heresy of Pelgianism.  If
&gt; the archangel Gabriel was sent to a woman to obtain her consent to
&gt; bear the Messiah in her womb, then our salvation hinged on that
&gt; decision of hers.  Not her own salvation only, but the salvation of
&gt; all the world.  She could have refused, and then the Messiah would

&gt; Unless you want to imagine God going from house to
&gt; house, looking for just anyone to be His Mother.  No, we both agree
&gt; that it was predestined to be Mary.  God chose her, which is why the
&gt; angel said to her &quot;blessed are you among women.&quot;  The angel also
&gt; called her &quot;full of grace,&quot; which, in order for God's Salvation to be
&gt; entirely His Work, she must have been.  Full in this context literally
&gt; means full.

&gt; Father Oakes writes,

&gt; &quot; . . . If, as part of its logic, the cross
&gt; itself is made possible only through Mary's consent at the
&gt; Annunciation (which Luke clearly holds), then the implications of the
&gt; denial of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception should become clear.
&gt; For such a denial would then make our very salvation dependent on
&gt; Mary's free will operating independent of grace. Her Yes to God would
&gt; have had to have been made, even if ever so slightly, under her own
&gt; power, which would have the intolerable implication of making the
&gt; entire drama of salvation hinge on a human work--the very apogee of
&gt; Pelagianism. &quot;

&gt; So, we have the absolute enmity between the woman and the serpent.
&gt; Since the serpent's domain is sin, and since the entire purpose of the
&gt; Incarnation was to reverse the Fall, then it follows that she who is
&gt; the woman in question --- the new Eve --- should be entirely free from
&gt; Satan's dominion from the start.  Otherwise, her consent to God would
&gt; have been tainted with self-will, and thus would have been, at least
&gt; partially, a human work, leading to the intolerable conclusion that
&gt; the salvation of the world was at least partially accomplished by
&gt; human initiative --- Pelagianism.

&gt; There is no question of Mary's having merited such a thing --- before
&gt; she was conceived she did not exist to merit anything.  Mary is
&gt; entirely the work of Christ.  The merit of her Immaculate Conception
&gt; comes entirely from His Cross. Thus does she say, &quot;My soul doth
&gt; magnify the Lord.&quot;

&gt; Luke 1:46. And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the Lord.
&gt; 1:47. And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
&gt; 1:48. Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid: for
&gt; behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
&gt; 1:49. Because he that is mighty hath done great things to me: and holy
&gt; is his name.
&gt; 1:50. And his mercy is from generation unto generations, to them that
&gt; fear him.
&gt; 1:51. He hath showed might in his arm: he hath scattered the proud in
&gt; the conceit of their heart.
&gt; 1:52. He hath put down the mighty from their seat and hath exalted the
&gt; humble.
&gt; 1:53. He hath filled the hungry with good things: and the rich he hath
&gt; sent empty away.
&gt; 1:54. He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful of his mercy.
&gt; 1:55. As he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham and to his seed for ever.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aw.  Too bad you couldn't be bothered to read the article.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I read through your whole post.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; O.K.  Are you familiar with the heresy of Pelagianism?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A little.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you agree that it is heresy?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pelagianism is the doctrine that man can either initiate or complete
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his salvation without the help of grace.  If to initiate, it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pelagianism, if only to complete, it is called Semi-Pelagiansim.-

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; God's grace is essential to our salvation.  It is by grace that we are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saved.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, just so.  Now, what about Mary?  Did God require her free consent
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the Incarnation, or do we take the angel's greeting to mean, &quot;this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is going to happen to you whether you want it or not?&quot;  When she spoke
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the words, &quot;let it be unto me as you have said,&quot; was that free
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rational consent?  Or not?  Would God force one of His creatures,

Joe,

Nothing but nothing written in the buy-bull can ever be
taken as read, and certainly should not be believed.

Can we take religion out of the equasion for a moment
and consider logically; the situation of the woman in this
case Mary, a virgin mark you, about to give birth in a
stable without any surgical assistance, there was not a
fall back on saesarian section in those days, we are led
to believe she was virgo intacta an untouched virgin with
the hymen still in place, this even today would present
concern and hospitalization would be essential; bearing in
mind no births have ever been known without virginal
penetration and the natural rupturing of the hymen and
as we know the hymen completely blocks the virginal
passage. No attendant was with them to assist no
midwife is mentioned, just Joseph and Mary on their
tod Jones. No other virgin births have been recorded up
to that time and there could have been no experience
on how to tackle this one-off difficulty. Even a normal
birth was frought with danger in those days, and you
are asking us to believe that this woman on her own
gave birth to a child with her hymen still intacked.
A skilled surgeon would need to operate to have any
hope for the survival of both mother and child.
This is just not credible, indeed it is incredible, I'd
go further and say impossible. Yet of course if you
can accept gods, you can accept anything! Even
complete and utter bilge!

Joe,

I neither want or require your response. Of what profit to knowledge
can you possibly contribute? when you have neither whit nor will
to acknowledge truth; instead espousing lies and false teaching
from a book of innane platitudinal nonsense, which is proven to be
unsubstantiated without a shred of integrity. A more apt title for
this rubbish, is indeed BUY-BULL there can be nothing sacred in
something so wickedly designed to deceive. One connot
blaspheme something that proves to be nothing at all. After all
there are no such things as gods are there? or would you care
to prove me wrong?
