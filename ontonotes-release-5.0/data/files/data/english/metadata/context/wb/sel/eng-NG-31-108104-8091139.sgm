The neighbors that live across the cul-de-sac from us have two teen
age kids.  The parents are going through a divorce, so 'mom' lets each
kid bring home a kitten.  Kiko is about 6 months old, and really
starting to show his manhood.  Jinx is a gorgeous little black sh who
is about 3 or 4 months old.  I went calling this morning to say hi and
pet the cats.  I mentioned (again) that they really need to look into
spaying and neutering the pooties a.s.a.p.  The reply I got was &quot;Well,
we really can't afford that&quot;.

I swear to God......some people really make me pro-nuclear.

Sorry for ranting.

That these neighbors who 'can't afford' to spay and neuter these two
beautiful little cats have a brand new pick-up truck sitting in their
driveway.

GAK.

And what do they reply to your innocent and wide-eyed question about
what they're going to do about all the kittens that will be on the way?
If I understood you correctly one kitty's a boy and the other a girl, right?

Let the kids experience the &quot;Miracle of birth&quot; because every child
should, then dump all the cats &amp; kittens at the high-kill shelter
where they levae them under the illusion that they'll &quot;get loving
homes&quot; because they &quot;just can't cope with those damn cats&quot; any more

That's correct.  I'm thinking the answer is to just cat nap the
babies, take them down the street to our vet and have them
spayed/neutered ourselves.  Of course, I'll have to do it on the
sly.....it wouldn't be the first time I footed the bill to have
neighbor cats altered.  Of course there is always the pesky

disappeared to.  But hey.....we're in love, and I have my ways of

I got a similar reply from a friend down the street,they had just gotten a
Boxer pup last month,I was told they can't afford to &quot;fix&quot; him,well,that
night I saw them at the store buying their 9 y.o couch potato,chubby spoiled
ROTTEN (emphasis on rotten,he's rude) son one of those Wii things. Also
,this is about the 5th different dog they've had in a year,they get rid of
them because they say they bite the boy,or scratch his face ( they've done
the same thing with kitties !!!!!!!!! ) , well I found out why ! when he's
at my house playing with my son,he gets in our little dog's face &amp; starts
wiggling her head &amp; blowing on her face,talking to her.  So far she has'nt
done anything,she's VERY good natured.

Thanks Helen.  Yep, I figure when I cat nap them and take them in for
their spay/neutering, I might as well get them all of their shots too.
I seriously doubt they've had them yet.

Yes, there is a low-cost program here, but only certain times of the
month, and at certain locations.  Naturally, the 'clinic's on wheels'
always seem to happen way over on the other side of Houston and by the
time the neighbor sees fit to go the distance to get these guys taken
care of, I'll already of secretly had them into our vet down the

Legally you can't do that.  Those cats aren't strays.  You could find
yourself in a world of hurt if you cat-nap them and have an unauthorized

Again, you can't do that.  They could sue the crap out of you.  They could
claim they were planning to breed them.  How would they NOT notice the
shaved patch and stitches from having the female spayed?  I don't know about
the neutering process but I'm pretty sure there's some obvious sign of that,
too.

It would be extremely hard to press that, though. If the cats are

What you're forgetting though, is that an attorney's services cost
about $150 an hour. Even representing
yourself in a small claims without an attorney is expensive, and a lot
of hassle. Nobody's going to to
that over the sterilization of a cat. No judge is going to award any
kind of judgment to the owner of a mixed-breed
cat, either. Just being practical.

This is true Jill, and a very good point.  However, these people are
completely oblivious where cat care is concerned.  They're always
consulting me on how to care for their pooties.  I'm thinking that
next week after the DH gets paid, I'll simply approach the subject
with them and tell them it's a gift from us.  The teenage kids are
really nice and well behaved children and they really love those
kittens.  They always invite me to go trick-or-treating with them at
halloween.  Naturally, I always dress up as a cat.  Go figure.

They would have to have proof that they owned the cats, and here in Houston

We had a case in the UK where someone had got fed up of a
neighbourhood tom cat spraying and basically took him to the vet to
have him neutered. The owner tried to get the police &amp; RSPCA involved
claiming it was animal abuse and *theft* of his manhood. I think the
party line taken by the police (when they stopped laughing) was that
she had to prove it. When she went to the papers she tried to get the
RSPCA to comment, and their line was well, &quot;We can't comment on
individual cases, but all companion animals should be spayed and
neutered so the person who did this was acting in the best interests
of the animal&quot;.

It was actually one of the funniest things I've ever read. The owner
tried to claim that the cat was psychologically scared because he no
longer had his manhood. The papers had a field day about the
owner.....oh, and promoted spay and neuter too. ;o)

&gt; Thank you Sherry.  The neighbors have no problem with their cats being
&gt; altered. They just simply don't want to put forth the money to have it
&gt; done.

If these people can't be bothered to take their kittens to the vet, I

Just take
the kitties to a vet that's at least an hour's drive away.
Would that work?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, there is a low-cost program here, but only certain times of the

Hate to say this, but I saw just such a case on one of those daytime judge

their dog neutered without express permission.  The plaintiff won.  So it

That's often the way.  I turned down some potential owners for a puppy
because the husband balked at the (reasonable) price, saying it would mean
he would not be able to have a new car.  I looked outside at their car
parked there, it was only a few years old, 3 or so.
It was the wife that seemed to want the puppy but I was very unhappy with
his response.  So they didn't get her because they didn't deserve her.  I
just said that &quot;after assessing your situation, I don't think I have a puppy
that would suit you, I'm sorry.&quot;
She went on to get a fantastic home.  The new slaves sent me a yearly letter
on how wonderful she was and when she passed away sadly early at 12 from
cancer, the letter I got to tell me the news nearly broke my heart at their
distress.  I cried.  I still have it along with the photo they sent me of
her final resting place.  I keep it to remind me not to be cynical about
occasionally breeding a litter.  How else would such wonderful people have
been able to get the dog they wanted and cherished all her life?

I have no dogs now and I do miss that.  Kitty FC would accept one for sure,
but Boyfriend *definitely* wouldn't.  He's nervous of his own shadow and
every visitor.  He will disappear immediately into the garden if the door
bell rings and will return around 2 minutes after the visitor has left.
I would love to have a dog or two again, but I know it would freak him out
big time, so it's out of the question for 15 years.  I would not even try to
attempt it.  I know that I would see him disappearing over the horizon never
to be seen again.  I would be devastated if I lost this lovely, beautiful,
kind, gentle, shy cat for a selfish wish to have dogs again.  I love him.  I
suspect he loves me, too, in his quiet way.

Personally, I'd find out when the next low-cost speutering session is,
and tell the cats owners that you'll take the felines there on the
appropriate day to have it done. It's not like they want the little
