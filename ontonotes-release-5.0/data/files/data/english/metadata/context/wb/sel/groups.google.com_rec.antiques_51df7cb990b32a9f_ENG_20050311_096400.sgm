Since the subject of getting rid of a mothball smell was presented in
another thread I have another question on the subject.

This is on a larger scale. The lake house built in 1901 by my
great-grandfather in-law reeks of mothballs. Seven of the buildings are
permiated with the scent, that includes the boat house. From 1954 to
1999 my grandmother in-law scattered the whole place with mothballs to
keep mice away before closing it up for the winter. Six years, a few
professional cleanings, hundreds of dollars in dry-cleaning bills, and
more in rug cleaning bills later it still has the lingering odor.

Most of the walls are narrow tongue in groove slats, some painted some
not. Ceilings are wide tongue in groove slats and floors are hardwood
with rugs. Thinking the wood is where the problem lies.

By September after opening it up in April the smell is faint, but
returns with a vengence in the spring. Short of a tomcat or ozone any
ideas as to what might rid the place of the smell? Ozone one room at a
time with all antiques removed might help but bringing the antiques back
in I fear the aroma might return.

"/> My grandmother loved those things, and even put them
in the attic...where the smell would permeate the house.
Have you checked all the secret places, to see if there's
still some there? My grammy even put them (crushed into
little crumbs) *under* the wall-to-wall carpeting, before
it was laid. I hate the idea of mothballs, although a
neighbor (who I love) thinks they're the smell of a clean
home.

I'd call a &quot;disaster clean-up&quot; company and ask them. They
have all kinds of odor removers.

"/> If you've done any research, you've found things to do about naphthalene
odor in clothing and small piece, like chests, but no simple, workable
and fast cure for a house. If there's insulation, all that's accessible
might need to be replaced. One source recommends washing surfaces with
half lemon juice or while vinegar and half alcohol.

It's unlikely that any mothballs remain. They evaporate in the short
term. I agree that the problem is likely in the wood, or a combination
of wood, insulation and furniture. Naphthalene vapor is heavier than
air. That it comes back strong as the spring progresses, suggests that
the change in temperature and humidity triggers the release.

I think I would deal with insulation, if present, and think about forced
air ventilation during the spring period where the odor it at its
height, figuring that, if conditions are right for materials to release
the odor, forced ventilation might speed the release and might stop any
cycle of absorbant materials reodorizing other things. Might be worth an
experiment with one building, removing furniture to narrow the source
down to the structure. Carpet might have to go.

Activated charcoal filtering of the air may help. Virgin activated
charcoal has a very high capacity for naphthalene vapor

One source recommends washing surfaces with half lemon juice or white
vinegar and half alcohol.

(*&lt;~ I omitted the vinegar and mixed half lemon juice with half
alcohol (Cuervo Gold) and washed all my surfaces (including behind my
ears).... then, I drank the mixture.

I didn't smell 'anything' after THAT,

"/> Those are some good ideas Gerald, thank you. There is no insulation in
the place, we'd wondered if there was but removing recessed lighting in
the kitchen, and replacing countless outlets throughout showed not a
smidge of insulation.

I think I'll start stocking up on white vinegar and alcohol and give
that one a try. I *think* the rugs are okay, after they were cleaned
they sat in my entry way from November to April and I never noticed an
odor and I was checking for it. We do leave windows open a lot, but
some other sort of ventilation might be worth a shot too. That'd
probably be easiest to do in one of the smaller bedrooms that doesn't
get used very often. Activated charcoal might just be the experiment
for my bedroom.
