Hey guys.  If you don't mind, I need to vent or I might lose it.

So husband has been working extra hard the last few weeks.  Has that
big push I mentioned coming up.
I am trying my best to pick up the slack on our unofficial agreement
of duties around the house and with the kids.  My patience is wearing
thin.

I hate when my life goes into these topsy-turvy conditions and I have
to roll with it.  Grit my teeth and bear it.  Slap that smile in place
until my mouth hurts.

The more pressure on him, the more *hits* I take.  It just grates, you
know?  And it seems to be coming to a head now.

Anyway, I hope I can hang on through this without exploding.  I know
that would be no help to either of us.  I guess I can focus on when
the frenzy is over and hope he doesn't expect me to keep on with this
maddened pace when the project is over.  Sure he will want some down-
time when he finishes, but I will need it too.  The last thing I want
to do is have to prod and poke and hint and discuss him getting back
to our normal roles around here.  I don't look forward to that at
all.  I think it's unavoidable. That really sucks.  Feeling like you
are going to be taken advantage of by the person you love.  Stopping
those thoughts now.

All right, I am done.  Just a hard weekend....

Vent away. I am going through some similar stuff right now. My wife is
going to school (MBA). She finishes next May. It is not easy taking up
so much slack.

Keep honest and respectful. Good luck.

Guess that explains where you've been, and here I was hoping you were
off having fun.  :-/

I hope that he notices and appreciates it when you pick up the
slack -- maybe not when he's in the midst of it and has his mind on
his own worries, but afterwards.  I think you should talk to him about
it.  Not accusingly or in a griping, complaining manner, but just let
him know that you miss him, and that all this extra work has made you
really appreciate how much he does, and that you can't wait until the
project is over and everything can get back to normal!

Rather than exploding, you might &quot;ride this one out,&quot; and then use the
opportunity after it's over to discuss a better strategy to deal with
work crunches in the future. There's no sense in &quot;hoping he doesn't
expect me to keep on with this maddened pace&quot; when it'd be much more
advisable to simply tell him you don't plan on keeping on in the same vein.

This doesn't make complete sense to me, though perhaps there's some
history here that I'm not in on. Why would it be so difficult to tell
him things are going back to normal when the push is over, and why would
you even have to prod and poke and hint?

Either he does care about you and your well-being, in which case he
should be open to hearing this, or else he's a selfish ass and this is
just the tip of a much bigger iceberg.

And, why do you think you are going to be taken advantage of? Again,
either there's no real basis for this, or there is, and the problem
isn't really about the housework at all, but his commitment to treat you
with care and consideration.

I'd ask you to consider whether this fear you have of asking to be
treated fairly and voicing your needs, concerns, and tribulations is
really about your husband (not caring, taking advantage of you), or
really about you and your insecurities and feeling like you don't
deserve whatever it is that you want. Now, maybe I'm reading too much of
my own psyche into there, as &quot;I don't deserve...&quot; is a coping mechanism
that I developed during certain stretches of my life and that still
occupies way too much space in my head even today.

On the practical side, once you do feel like this is a completely
reasonable topic to broach when things settle down: there's probably
some changes the two of you can make so it won't be so hard on you next
time around.

Presumably, the downside of his extra time commitment at work has an
upside in the form of being a valuable, well-compensated employee, and
part of the &quot;cost of doing business&quot; to be in that position may be
hiring out some things that would normally be doable between the two of
you when he's working normalish hours and able to carry his share of the
load.

Or perhaps there are ways you can simplify your lives either temporarily
or permanently. Every time you feel that &quot;I have to...&quot; pressure coming
on, look that have-to good and straight in the eye and ask yourself, do
I really need to do this? Some of that stuff you will still choose to
do, but it's important to recognize that those things are choices that
you make, and not obligations that your preoccupied husband or the
Unkind Hand of Fate have dumped on you.

You could loose it over caring for your children and home?  Why would
any of the demands be so overwhelming you feel that way?

Every couple has struggles - regardless of how much $$$$ come into the
home.  My wife has a FT demanding profession; as I do.  I help with our
son's needs; yet she does more feeling as though she should; saying I
need to stay focused because I provide considerably more for the family;
I agree.  I provide gardeners and inside cleaning staff.  There after,
most of the physical demands around our home fall upon her shoulders and
she takes them in stride.

I did most of the cooking this wkend, she cleaned up afterwards.  I
played golf on Sat and we all watched the PPV movie &quot;Wildhogs&quot; later
that evening.  She walked 18 holes with me on Sunday, and I made a great
dinner afterwords, even helped my son with his bike problems; and later
fell asleep in my chair.  My wife, while in her chair, wrote reports for
her work.  I woke up realizing I fell asleep and said &quot;I am beat&quot;,
didn't realize I was sleeping - she laughed, and said &quot;you're older.&quot;

If your marriage is on the rocks - that's one thing.  But, if it's not -
then &quot;why&quot; would your patience be wearing thin????  Correct me if I am
wrong; but, wasn't this traditional lifestyle by choice?  Are you not a
stay at home mom caring for the children and house while he goes to work
and brings in the money allowing you the best &quot;choice&quot; to stay home?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Feeling like you are going to be taken advantage of by the person you love.

You're part of a team; there's NO &quot;me&quot; in the word team; you've got the
home duties, he's got work duties for someone else.  You step up without
complaining --- just like he's stepping up to what ever the demands are
at work, otherwise he gets fired.   If you don't step up, who's there to
fire you.  Who listens to him vent???  Taking advantage???? how so???

That last part is the key.  While you've got to maintain respect for
what you do, it might not be the time to address all of this stuff
until things settle down.

The other disadvantage that a SAHM has, and I'm not sure there's any
way of resolving it, is that he's a position to evaluate your job
performance as a SAHM however, you're probably not in a position to
evaluate his performance at his job.  Therefore, while he's in a
position to be critical of the job you're doing, you are probably not
in a position to be critical of his.  So if he's critical of your
ability to maintain control of the kids, maybe you're in the
unenviable position of having to address that criticism with him.

But there's a way to be critical, and a way not to be so, and maybe,
in a quieter moment, there might be an opportunity to make the point
to him that while you're willing to address a certain amount of
criticism about how you do your job, not only does that have its
limits, but how he delivers such criticism is important to you.

And then there's always the chance that your perception isn't as bad
as you'd think it would be if you weren't the one in that situation,
or if maybe there are things you're doing to elicit such an attitude
from him even if your perception is accurate, but that's a different
story.

In my opinion, this is not stuff you should tolerate, regardless of
your husband's situation at work.

It is one thing if you have to _do_ more work because he is entering
crunch time at his job.

But there is simply no sufficient excuse for criticizing you and
making cutting remarks, instead of appreciating what you are doing.

If this was happening to me I would be wanting to deal with it
immediately instead of waiting until the work crunch is over.

&gt;&gt; &gt; So husband has been working extra hard the last few weeks.  Has that
&gt;&gt; &gt; big push I mentioned coming up.
&gt;&gt; &gt; I am trying my best to pick up the slack on our unofficial agreement
&gt;&gt; &gt; of duties around the house and with the kids.  My patience is wearing
&gt;&gt; &gt; thin.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I hate when my life goes into these topsy-turvy conditions and I have
&gt;&gt; &gt; to roll with it.  Grit my teeth and bear it.  Slap that smile in place
&gt;&gt; &gt; until my mouth hurts.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The more pressure on him, the more *hits* I take.  It just grates, you
&gt;&gt; &gt; know?  And it seems to be coming to a head now.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Anyway, I hope I can hang on through this without exploding.  I know
&gt;&gt; &gt; that would be no help to either of us.  I guess I can focus on when
&gt;&gt; &gt; the frenzy is over and hope he doesn't expect me to keep on with this
&gt;&gt; &gt; maddened pace when the project is over.  Sure he will want some down-
&gt;&gt; &gt; time when he finishes, but I will need it too.  The last thing I want
&gt;&gt; &gt; to do is have to prod and poke and hint and discuss him getting back
&gt;&gt; &gt; to our normal roles around here.  I don't look forward to that at
&gt;&gt; &gt; all.  I think it's unavoidable. That really sucks.  Feeling like you
&gt;&gt; &gt; are going to be taken advantage of by the person you love.  Stopping
&gt;&gt; &gt; those thoughts now.

&gt;&gt; &gt; All right, I am done.  Just a hard weekend....

&gt;&gt; &gt; Vickie

&gt;&gt; I feel your pain! That happens around here sometimes too. Hope it ends
&gt;&gt; soon.-

&gt; Me too!  And hope it is not time for your go around.

My husband is working long hours too these days. But he is being super sweet
when he IS home. So I don't mind so much. He pretty much took care of the
kids for the whole weekend. And he does not care if the house is temporarily
trashed or we eat simple food. I just remind myself of what my *real*
priorities are. Reading to the kids. Piano lessons. Reading to the kids (it
is raining here today). Playing Zingo with my youngest. Playing chess with
the elder. Reading to the kids.

:)

&gt; That last part is the key.  While you've got to maintain respect for what
&gt; you do, it might not be the time to address all of this stuff until things
&gt; settle down.

&gt; The other disadvantage that a SAHM has, and I'm not sure there's any way
&gt; of resolving it, is that he's a position to evaluate your job performance
&gt; as a SAHM however,

I disagree wholeheartedly with this statement. He is NOT and should not be
in a position to judge her job as a mother. He has the right to voice
disagreement as a parenting partner. That is all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; you're probably not in a position to evaluate his performance at his job.
&gt; Therefore, while he's in a position to be critical of the job you're
&gt; doing, you are probably not in a position to be critical of his.  So if
&gt; he's critical of your ability to maintain control of the kids, maybe
&gt; you're in the unenviable position of having to address that criticism with
&gt; him.

&gt; But there's a way to be critical, and a way not to be so, and maybe, in a
&gt; quieter moment, there might be an opportunity to make the point to him
&gt; that while you're willing to address a certain amount of criticism about
&gt; how you do your job, not only does that have its limits, but how he
&gt; delivers such criticism is important to you.

&gt; And then there's always the chance that your perception isn't as bad as
&gt; you'd think it would be if you weren't the one in that situation, or if
&gt; maybe there are things you're doing to elicit such an attitude from him
&gt; even if your perception is accurate, but that's a different story.

That's a joke? I don't mean to push you towards a confrontational mode
while you are dealing with so much stress, but *I* wouldn't let that
kind of comment pass without a serious and immediate talk (no matter
how busy and stressed my husband was). IMO, these kinds of comments,
if taken lightly and jokingly, set the tone of the relationship in a
way that's difficult to change later.

Sorry you are having a hard time, hope it passes soon.

&gt; In my opinion, this is not stuff you should tolerate, regardless of
&gt; your husband's situation at work.

&gt; It is one thing if you have to _do_ more work because he is entering
&gt; crunch time at his job.

&gt; But there is simply no sufficient excuse for criticizing you and
&gt; making cutting remarks, instead of appreciating what you are doing.

&gt; If this was happening to me I would be wanting to deal with it
&gt; immediately instead of waiting until the work crunch is over.

&gt; &gt; The remarks about how I am not good at my job really stings.  I
&gt; &gt; congratulate my husband in his work accomplishments always and support
&gt; &gt; him in the tough decisions he has to make.  I wish he would lay off
&gt; &gt; with that type of remark.

No, this is NOT part and parcel of the marriage job.

Vicki, have you made any headway in the Fear and Other Uninvited
Guests book? It seems to me that your DH also has trouble handling his
own anxiety. When he's under work stress, he unloads and dumps his
anxiety on you, in the form of abusive put-downs and insults. This can
only increase your own level of anxiety. It's no wonder your child is
also showing the effects. Anxiety is ping-ponging around in your
family and it will only escalate. The solution is to have every member
of your family learn how to keep their anxiety to themselves (not
absorbing it - which is unhealthy - but dealing with it until it
dissipates), instead of dumping it on others.

You two need to get this under control sooner rather than later,
because the type of comments your DH is making are major marriage
killers. Do some googling on &quot;Gottman&quot; and &quot;Four Horsemen&quot;... you have
two of the four signs of a troubled marriage, criticism and contempt.
You and he need to put a stop to this before your marriage goes into a
downward spiral.

I agree with Doug, I would not wait until his work crisis is over to
address this. His work crisis is no excuse. There will always be
crisises. This isn't about work - it's about how he handles his
anxiety and stress.

Is it possible for you to be more self-critical of how your handling
your duties as a stay at home mom and wife?  Are you not doing a job
that has long-term consequences when it comes to the children?

Since we're all human with predispositons  - might you be overly
insecure as a result of knowing deep inside you're slacking off in
certain areas?

This is exactly the kind of thing I hate how some people approach
problems in their marital lives, and it's especially true when it
involves Usenet.  Be patient with me, but here's a little dissertation
which has nothing to do with Vickie, per se.  I'll just use the name
Jane to be sure no one gets confused about that.

Jane posts a story in Usenet.  The possibility are these:

1)  It's a totally accurate story, and all of the relevant details are
included, and all of the perceptions of what's occurred are what we'd
all generally agree are accurate if we would've witnessed that story
first hand.

2) Jane suffers from the human frailty of being biased, and so while
she's genuinely interested in meeting the standard described in (1),
she doesn't, and the story she posts leaves out some facts that might
tend to leave an impression that she subconsciously wants to create
which is a little different that what might be accurate.

3)  Jane suffers from the human frailty of having her own issues, and
her perceptions of what transpired are not consistent with what most
objective people (including her if she wasn't at the center of the
issue) might agree is what actually transpired.

4)  Jane has character flaws which, while not a good thing, are not so
bad as to make her a bad person, but nonetheless, lead her to seek
validation for her own behavior toward her SO, and so she knowingly
and purposefully shades the story so as to illicit certain responses
of sympathy and empathy.

5)  She's just a lying bitch.

Now, if (1) is what's going on, then there's nothing wrong with the
response you gave, and if (5) is true, then no harm there either.  But
if it's (2), (3), or even maybe a little bit of (4), then she's being
told things about her SO which might very well *not* be true, and if
that's the prevailing type of response here, she might very well be
emboldened to respond to her SO in a way which could be very
destructive to the marriage.

The bottom line is that we simply cannot know if we know all there is
to know in order to make any judgments about anyone who is the subject
of any story posted here, and so it's simply dangerous to make such
judgments.

Vickie, he may very well not be a nice man, however, you told me
recently that your marriage was sound, and if that's true, then your
partner is probably someone that *you* would consider a nice man,
although he may not be behaving nicely now, or maybe, he's not
behaving all that badly, but there are other things going on
(including the possibility that you might be wanting to see him as
behaving badly right now) that make you perceive that he is.

That's not to blame you for anything either, but if anything, these
times of stress are the very times when we must go slowly and
carefully, which is what you very much seem to want to do by venting
here, and so I suggest that your gut instinct to do so is a good
instinct, and that you should therefore ignore the advice that he's
not a nice man, or the blanket assertions that you &quot;shouldn't tolerate
such behavior&quot;.  Of course you should not tolerate certain behaviors,
but that very well might not be the issue facing you.

Of course, maybe it'd be more supportive of me to say &quot;you're
completely in the right, and your DH is an a-hole who's completely in
the wrong&quot; because it makes you feel better in the short run, but I
frankly think saying &quot;maybe it's a combination of his behavior and
your mistakes&quot; that could be more supportive in the long run.

Good luck, Vickie.

Oh you know, it's the same battle over and over.  He says something
and I tell him I don't like it and then I get the, &quot;Don't be so
sensitive.&quot;.
Counseling is out.  He doesn't feel the need.  And I myself had not
such a good experience last year.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Not the bad kind, just verbal stuff, like, &quot;Your not a very good
&gt; &gt;&gt; housewife.&quot; or constant demands, &quot;Do this, do that.&quot;  And the jokes, I
&gt; &gt;&gt; really hate the snide jokes, a pet peeve of mine, &quot;Could you at least
&gt; &gt;&gt; think about disciplining the kids, you are a f-ing push-over?!&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; The remarks about how I am not good at my job really stings.  I
&gt; &gt;&gt; congratulate my husband in his work accomplishments always and support
&gt; &gt;&gt; him in the tough decisions he has to make.  I wish he would lay off
&gt; &gt;&gt; with that type of remark.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I will get through it though.  Part and parcel of the marriage job.

&gt; &gt; That last part is the key.  While you've got to maintain respect for what
&gt; &gt; you do, it might not be the time to address all of this stuff until things
&gt; &gt; settle down.

&gt; &gt; The other disadvantage that a SAHM has, and I'm not sure there's any way
&gt; &gt; of resolving it, is that he's a position to evaluate your job performance
&gt; &gt; as a SAHM however,

&gt; I disagree wholeheartedly with this statement. He is NOT and should not be
&gt; in a position to judge her job as a mother. He has the right to voice
&gt; disagreement as a parenting partner. That is all.
">

Right. I don't see this as an issue of who has the &quot;advantage.&quot; Even if
she were in a position to judge his work performance, so what.

From what Vickie writes, it sounds like he is being a bit disrespectful.
The sarcasm and criticism about the kids is out of line. His demands
should be more like requests.

He does have a say in how the house is run, including kids, but it
sounds like he needs to step up his game a little.

Regarding the folks who say V should address this now. I agree that she
needs to head off the disrespect as it occurs. If there are more
&quot;structural&quot; issues about his style of communication, those will
probably have to wait until he has more time.

Shameless plug follows:

In the meantime, you may want him to take a look at
http://www.emotionsforengineers.com

There are some sections on communication that could be worthwhile.

&gt; kind of comment pass without a serious and immediate talk (no matter

Each parent has a vested interest in how the kids are parented
overall, therefore, each parent has the right, and the responsibility
to evaluate, and criticize, if necessary, the job the other is doing
as parent.  The only other option is for parents to be willing to
abdicate their responsibilities as parents to someone else, and I
would never do that concerning my kids, not would I expect my DW to do
so either.

So it's your position that you can parent your kids any way you want,
and your DH has no say in it just because he goes off to work and you
stay home?

Ever hear of the theory of relativity?  Basically, it says that no
observer has any proiority over who is in motion (or at what speed),
or who is at rest.  It's like two ships passing in the night where
it's impossible to see any land, or any stars, or even sense how fast
the water is moving.  Is there really a way for either of them to know
how much of the net difference is speed is due to one ship instead of
the other?

Your instincts to get through this now seem perfect to me.

It is more a matter of the nature of the say. I agree with you that both
parents have an interest and a responsibility in the upbringing of the
children. However, one does not have the right to be &quot;boss&quot; to the other.
One has the responsibility to raise one's issues in a partnership manner
rather than a critical manner. The best and most useful way to bring up
changes is to discuss concerns and brainstorm solutions together. The worst
and least helpful is to say things like &quot;Have you ever considered
disciplinging your children rather than being a pushover.&quot;

So to say that he is in a position to &quot;evaluate her job performance&quot; is not
so much wrong as has a flavor that it is not appropriate and condusive to
marital strife.

Maybe.  I don't know.  I had to prioritize the last few weeks, you

working so hard, but like now, I have taken some time to myself when
other things need to get done.

As far as the kids.  Yeah, I probably do look at solving things short
term, pacifying, instead of long term.  I don't like myself very much
for doing that.  And I know the kids will be the ones to lose in the
end.  I have been doing better, but right now, not so well.

Saying mean things as &quot;just a joke&quot; or passing off spousal feelings with
&quot;you're too sensitive&quot; is just nasty to me. My DH makes jokes that I would
call put downs. And he really does mean them as jokes. And I call him down
on it *every time.* It is such a habit that he has a hard time breaking ti
though. But as far as humor goes, it is just Not Funny.

&gt; Right. I don't see this as an issue of who has the &quot;advantage.&quot; Even
&gt; if

I have no idea what you're saying here.  There is no issue of &quot;should&quot;
except that each parent should be able to evaluate the performance of
each other parent as a parent, and to the extent that the financial
aspects of their partnership in largely in his hands, she &quot;should&quot; be
able to evaluate his job performance as the income earner, but only to
the extent that she has enough data to do so.  If the lack of data
limits her ability to perform such an evaluation, then it does.

&gt;&gt;&gt; the right to voice disagreement as a parenting partner. That is

&gt;&gt; Each parent has a vested interest in how the kids are parented
&gt;&gt; overall, therefore, each parent has the right, and the
&gt;&gt; responsibility to evaluate, and criticize, if necessary, the job
&gt;&gt; the other is doing as parent.  The only other option is for parents
&gt;&gt; to be willing to abdicate their responsibilities as parents to
&gt;&gt; someone else, and I would never do that concerning my kids, not
&gt;&gt; would I expect my DW to do so either.

&gt;&gt; So it's your position that you can parent your kids any way you
&gt;&gt; want, and your DH has no say in it just because he goes off to work
&gt;&gt; and you stay home?

&gt; It is more a matter of the nature of the say. I agree with you that
&gt; both parents have an interest and a responsibility in the upbringing
&gt; of the children. However, one does not have the right to be &quot;boss&quot;
&gt; to the other.
">

Did I say that?  I don't think I said that.  In fact, I just went back
and re-read what I said, and I know I didn't say that.  The fact that
he's in a position to evaluate her performance as a mother doesn't
mean that she's not in a position to evaluate his job as a father,
does it?  Moreover, I said evaluate, not dictate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; One has the responsibility to raise one's issues in a partnership
&gt; manner rather than a critical manner. The best and most useful way
&gt; to bring up changes is to discuss concerns and brainstorm solutions
&gt; together. The worst and least helpful is to say things like &quot;Have
&gt; you ever considered disciplinging your children rather than being a
&gt; pushover.&quot;

&gt; So to say that he is in a position to &quot;evaluate her job performance&quot;
&gt; is not so much wrong as has a flavor that it is not appropriate and
&gt; condusive to marital strife.
">

I don't see how it's it's a problem to the marriage for each parent to
evaluate how the other parent is parenting.  I'm not suggesting that
they sit down once a month and go through a formal check list or
anything, but the kind of feedback obtained by the parents of a child
feeding off each other is most helpful in rasing that child.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you're probably not in a position to evaluate his performance at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his job. Therefore, while he's in a position to be critical of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the job you're doing, you are probably not in a position to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; critical of his. So if he's critical of your ability to maintain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; control of the kids, maybe you're in the unenviable position of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; having to address that criticism with him.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But there's a way to be critical, and a way not to be so, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; maybe, in a quieter moment, there might be an opportunity to make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the point to him that while you're willing to address a certain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; amount of criticism about how you do your job, not only does that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have its limits, but how he delivers such criticism is important
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And then there's always the chance that your perception isn't as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bad as you'd think it would be if you weren't the one in that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; situation, or if maybe there are things you're doing to elicit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such an attitude from him even if your perception is accurate,

&gt; &gt; He says these things to you? Honestly he does not sound like a very nice
&gt; &gt; man.

&gt; He is really just so extreme.  Either he is a wonder husband, who I
&gt; adore and love with all my heart, or this crictical jerk.  Mostly he
&gt; is my man.  I just need to get through this.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The remarks about how I am not good at my job really stings.  I

&gt; &gt; &gt; Vickie

&gt; &gt; Does he know it hurts you? Does he care? I would think it might not be a bad
&gt; &gt; idea to get counseling, togher ideally or alone if he wont go. It may be
&gt; &gt; time to focus on learning some limit setting skills. He has no right to
&gt; &gt; treat you badly. And may need to be shown the way.

&gt; Oh you know, it's the same battle over and over.  He says something
&gt; and I tell him I don't like it and then I get the, &quot;Don't be so
&gt; sensitive.&quot;.
">

To me this is problematic.  His behavior (when he's behaving like
this) is inexcusable.  It's bad for you, and, frankly, it is also bad
for _him_ to be able to get away with treating people like this.

I want to say the behavior is intolerable, but right now you are
tolerating it.  What can you do that would really communicate the
degree to which it is intolerable (and that wouldn't punish you more
than him)?

When he says &quot;don't be sensitive&quot; respond with something like &quot;I _am_
sensitive, and you've hurt my feelings.  Please apologize.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Counseling is out.  He doesn't feel the need.

Counseling is about if _one_ person feels the need.

What about counseling for _you_ so that you can learn how to handle
his behavior?  Tell him you are going, invite him to come, and go
regardless.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And I myself had not
&gt; such a good experience last year.
">

A good counselor is hard to find.  Or a hard counselor is good to
find.  Or something!

You have to shop around until you find someone who makes sense to you,
and with whom you feel some degree of sympatico.  In our areas, many
counselors will either talk to you on the phone or grant you some kind
of preliminary &quot;feeling out&quot; appointment.  I found this very valuable
when I was looking - I could explain the sorts of problems we were
having, what I was looking for, and ask what sorts of things they
might try to work with us.

The specifics of the answers don't matter so much - what matters is
more like &quot;do I trust this person?&quot;  &quot;does he or she seem intelligent
and sympathetic?&quot; etc.  (You might have a different list of what you
are looking for, of course.)

&gt; son's needs; yet she does more feeling as though she should; saying I
&gt; need to stay focused because I provide considerably more for the family;
&gt; I agree.  I provide gardeners and inside cleaning staff.  There after,
&gt; most of the physical demands around our home fall upon her shoulders and
&gt; she takes them in stride.

&gt; I did most of the cooking this wkend, she cleaned up afterwards.  I
&gt; played golf on Sat and we all watched the PPV movie &quot;Wildhogs&quot; later
&gt; that evening.  She walked 18 holes with me on Sunday, and I made a great
&gt; dinner afterwords, even helped my son with his bike problems; and later
&gt; fell asleep in my chair.  My wife, while in her chair, wrote reports for
&gt; her work.  I woke up realizing I fell asleep and said &quot;I am beat&quot;,
&gt; didn't realize I was sleeping - she laughed, and said &quot;you're older.&quot;

&gt; If your marriage is on the rocks - that's one thing.  But, if it's not -
&gt; then &quot;why&quot; would your patience be wearing thin????  Correct me if I am
&gt; wrong; but, wasn't this traditional lifestyle by choice?  Are you not a
&gt; stay at home mom caring for the children and house while he goes to work
&gt; and brings in the money allowing you the best &quot;choice&quot; to stay home?

Hmmm.  No there was no agreement to traditional lifestyle.  We just

&gt; fire you.  Who listens to him vent???  Taking advantage???? how so???

I would like to fire myself sometimes.
I listen to him vent.
Guess the taking advantage of is just another chip to add to my
shoulder.  I am putting forth an effort to get through this hard time,
but when it comes to an end, I would really like things to go back to
the old routine, without having to mention it, because then, well it
is just so damn uncomfortable.  Like, &quot;Ok honey, it has been a few
weeks since the push and you have had some down-time, could we
possibly go back to our agreement about chores, etc?&quot;
Maybe I am worrying for nothing or what is that called, ummm, I
forget, like doing things that are going to bring about the battle I
don't want to have, is that tempting fate?

At any rate, I am complaining here so I won't do it to him.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; off
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with that type of remark.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I will get through it though.  Part and parcel of the marriage
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; job.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That last part is the key.  While you've got to maintain respect
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for what
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you do, it might not be the time to address all of this stuff
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; until things
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; settle down.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The other disadvantage that a SAHM has, and I'm not sure there's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; any way
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of resolving it, is that he's a position to evaluate your job
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; performance
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as a SAHM however,

&gt; &gt;&gt; I disagree wholeheartedly with this statement. He is NOT and should
&gt; &gt;&gt; not be
&gt; &gt;&gt; in a position to judge her job as a mother. He has the right to
&gt; &gt;&gt; voice
&gt; &gt;&gt; disagreement as a parenting partner. That is all.

&gt; &gt; Right. I don't see this as an issue of who has the &quot;advantage.&quot; Even
&gt; &gt; if
&gt; &gt; she were in a position to judge his work performance, so what.

&gt; I have no idea what you're saying here.  There is no issue of &quot;should&quot;
&gt; except that each parent should be able to evaluate the performance of
&gt; each other parent as a parent, and to the extent that the financial
&gt; aspects of their partnership in largely in his hands, she &quot;should&quot; be
&gt; able to evaluate his job performance as the income earner, but only to
&gt; the extent that she has enough data to do so.  If the lack of data
&gt; limits her ability to perform such an evaluation, then it does.

In one of your comments you brought up the issue of advantage and
disadvantage regarding who can judge what. My point was that advantage
and disadvantage are not relevant to the issue. The piece of your post
following &quot;as a SAHM however,&quot; which contained more of the relevant
verbiage, is snipped in your reply.

&gt;&gt; Is it possible for you to be more self-critical of how your handling
&gt;&gt; your duties as a stay at home mom and wife?  Are you not doing a job
&gt;&gt; that has long-term consequences when it comes to the children?

&gt;&gt; Since we're all human with predispositons  - might you be overly
&gt;&gt; insecure as a result of knowing deep inside you're slacking off in
&gt;&gt; certain areas?
&gt;&gt; --

&gt; Maybe.  I don't know.  I had to prioritize the last few weeks, you
&gt; know, let some not so important things go to the way side since he is
&gt; working so hard, but like now, I have taken some time to myself when
&gt; other things need to get done.

&gt; As far as the kids.  Yeah, I probably do look at solving things short
&gt; term, pacifying, instead of long term.  I don't like myself very much
&gt; for doing that.  And I know the kids will be the ones to lose in the
&gt; end.  I have been doing better, but right now, not so well.

&gt; Vickie
">

How are you with savings accounts? I used to pacify in the moment, get
through right now. Until I learned the term &quot;investment discipline&quot; and the
term &quot;spending discipline.&quot; When I realized that making today easier was
making tomorrow 2x as hard, I decided to hunker down and do investment
discipline. It really can make tomorrow so much easier.

I am going to make a statement that I hope does not hurt or offend you. Have
you considered that you may suffer from depression? I don't know a huge
amount about it. But you seem to have a defeated outlook on your ability to
cope and solve problems. Like they are just too *hard.* From what I
understand, that is a  very common symptom of depression, the unability to
get up the energy to tackle the problems and solve them.

Best of luck.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; know?  And it seems to be coming to a head now.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What kind of hits?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Goodness, sorry bout that.  I meant to put hits in quotes.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Not the bad kind, just verbal stuff, like, &quot;Your not a very good

&gt; &gt;&gt; He says these things to you? Honestly he does not sound like a very nice
&gt; &gt;&gt; man.

&gt; &gt; He is really just so extreme.  Either he is a wonder husband, who I
&gt; &gt; adore and love with all my heart, or this crictical jerk.  Mostly he
&gt; &gt; is my man.  I just need to get through this.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The remarks about how I am not good at my job really stings.  I

&gt; &gt;&gt; Does he know it hurts you? Does he care? I would think it might not be a
&gt; &gt;&gt; bad
&gt; &gt;&gt; idea to get counseling, togher ideally or alone if he wont go. It may be
&gt; &gt;&gt; time to focus on learning some limit setting skills. He has no right to
&gt; &gt;&gt; treat you badly. And may need to be shown the way.

&gt; &gt; Oh you know, it's the same battle over and over.  He says something
&gt; &gt; and I tell him I don't like it and then I get the, &quot;Don't be so
&gt; &gt; sensitive.&quot;.
&gt; &gt; Counseling is out.  He doesn't feel the need.  And I myself had not
&gt; &gt; such a good experience last year.

&gt; I guess you have decided to live with this recurring battle. It is a shame.
&gt; It seems like a crappy way to live, in my opinion.
">

You are not alone in your opinion.  My mom says the same- as she and
the short time she was with my father never considered putting each
other down.
It can be hard, but I have to tell myself, this is *not* the typical
him.

&gt; &gt; and I tell him I don't like it and then I get the, &quot;Don't be so

&gt; To me this is problematic.  His behavior (when he's behaving like
&gt; this) is inexcusable.  It's bad for you, and, frankly, it is also bad
&gt; for _him_ to be able to get away with treating people like this.

&gt; I want to say the behavior is intolerable, but right now you are
&gt; tolerating it.  What can you do that would really communicate the
&gt; degree to which it is intolerable (and that wouldn't punish you more
&gt; than him)?

&gt; When he says &quot;don't be sensitive&quot; respond with something like &quot;I _am_
&gt; sensitive, and you've hurt my feelings.  Please apologize.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Counseling is out.  He doesn't feel the need.

&gt; Counseling is about if _one_ person feels the need.

&gt; What about counseling for _you_ so that you can learn how to handle
&gt; his behavior?  Tell him you are going, invite him to come, and go
&gt; regardless.

&gt; &gt; And I myself had not
&gt; &gt; such a good experience last year.

&gt; A good counselor is hard to find.  Or a hard counselor is good to
&gt; find.  Or something!

&gt; You have to shop around until you find someone who makes sense to you,
&gt; and with whom you feel some degree of sympatico.  In our areas, many
&gt; counselors will either talk to you on the phone or grant you some kind
&gt; of preliminary &quot;feeling out&quot; appointment.  I found this very valuable
&gt; when I was looking - I could explain the sorts of problems we were
&gt; having, what I was looking for, and ask what sorts of things they
&gt; might try to work with us.

&gt; The specifics of the answers don't matter so much - what matters is
&gt; more like &quot;do I trust this person?&quot;  &quot;does he or she seem intelligent
&gt; and sympathetic?&quot; etc.  (You might have a different list of what you
&gt; are looking for, of course.)- Hide quoted text -
">

The more I went the more I would come home angrier than when I
started.  I don't know if that is normal or not.  I didn't like it at
all.
It is hard to find someone to trust.

If anything in what I said earlier was not included in my subsequent
reply, I didn't snip it.  As to the point to which you allude, I fail
to see it.  My point was that he has the advantage of being able to
evaluate all of her work, whereas she might have the disadvantage in
not being able to fully evaluate all of his work, even though she's
affected by it.  If you don't see those as either an advantage or
disadvantage, so be it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; idea to get counseling, togher ideally or alone if he wont go. It may be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time to focus on learning some limit setting skills. He has no right to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; treat you badly. And may need to be shown the way.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh you know, it's the same battle over and over.  He says something
&gt; &gt; &gt; and I tell him I don't like it and then I get the, &quot;Don't be so
&gt; &gt; &gt; sensitive.&quot;.

&gt; &gt; To me this is problematic.  His behavior (when he's behaving like
&gt; &gt; this) is inexcusable.  It's bad for you, and, frankly, it is also bad
&gt; &gt; for _him_ to be able to get away with treating people like this.

&gt; &gt; I want to say the behavior is intolerable, but right now you are
&gt; &gt; tolerating it.  What can you do that would really communicate the
&gt; &gt; degree to which it is intolerable (and that wouldn't punish you more
&gt; &gt; than him)?

&gt; &gt; When he says &quot;don't be sensitive&quot; respond with something like &quot;I _am_
&gt; &gt; sensitive, and you've hurt my feelings.  Please apologize.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Counseling is out.  He doesn't feel the need.

&gt; &gt; Counseling is about if _one_ person feels the need.

&gt; &gt; What about counseling for _you_ so that you can learn how to handle
&gt; &gt; his behavior?  Tell him you are going, invite him to come, and go
&gt; &gt; regardless.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And I myself had not
&gt; &gt; &gt; such a good experience last year.

&gt; &gt; A good counselor is hard to find.  Or a hard counselor is good to
&gt; &gt; find.  Or something!

&gt; &gt; You have to shop around until you find someone who makes sense to you,
&gt; &gt; and with whom you feel some degree of sympatico.  In our areas, many
&gt; &gt; counselors will either talk to you on the phone or grant you some kind
&gt; &gt; of preliminary &quot;feeling out&quot; appointment.  I found this very valuable
&gt; &gt; when I was looking - I could explain the sorts of problems we were
&gt; &gt; having, what I was looking for, and ask what sorts of things they
&gt; &gt; might try to work with us.

&gt; &gt; The specifics of the answers don't matter so much - what matters is
&gt; &gt; more like &quot;do I trust this person?&quot;  &quot;does he or she seem intelligent
&gt; &gt; and sympathetic?&quot; etc.  (You might have a different list of what you
&gt; &gt; are looking for, of course.)- Hide quoted text -

&gt; The more I went the more I would come home angrier than when I
&gt; started.  I don't know if that is normal or not.  I didn't like it at
&gt; all.
">

I think it is normal for counselling to make one feel worse in the
short term.

One of the things we do is bury our problems to some extent to make
life easier.  If we actually want to _solve_ them instead of burying
them, then we first have to dig them up.

But having things nicely buried is cheerier than having them dug up,
when you haven't yet started to make things better.

In other words, to solve your problems, you have to really admit them
to yourself and think about them.  And that process is potentially
miserable.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know?  And it seems to be coming to a head now.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What kind of hits?

&gt; &gt; Goodness, sorry bout that.  I meant to put hits in quotes.
&gt; &gt; Not the bad kind, just verbal stuff, like, &quot;Your not a very good
&gt; &gt; housewife.&quot; or constant demands, &quot;Do this, do that.&quot;  And the jokes, I
&gt; &gt; really hate the snide jokes, a pet peeve of mine, &quot;Could you at least
&gt; &gt; think about disciplining the kids, you are a f-ing push-over?!&quot;
&gt; &gt; The remarks about how I am not good at my job really stings.  I
&gt; &gt; congratulate my husband in his work accomplishments always and support
&gt; &gt; him in the tough decisions he has to make.  I wish he would lay off
&gt; &gt; with that type of remark.

&gt; &gt; I will get through it though.  Part and parcel of the marriage job.

&gt; &gt; Vickie

&gt; No, this is NOT part and parcel of the marriage job.

&gt; Vicki, have you made any headway in the Fear and Other Uninvited
&gt; Guests book? It seems to me that your DH also has trouble handling his
&gt; own anxiety. When he's under work stress, he unloads and dumps his
&gt; anxiety on you, in the form of abusive put-downs and insults. This can
&gt; only increase your own level of anxiety. It's no wonder your child is
&gt; also showing the effects. Anxiety is ping-ponging around in your
&gt; family and it will only escalate. The solution is to have every member
&gt; of your family learn how to keep their anxiety to themselves (not
&gt; absorbing it - which is unhealthy - but dealing with it until it
&gt; dissipates), instead of dumping it on others.

&gt; You two need to get this under control sooner rather than later,
&gt; because the type of comments your DH is making are major marriage
&gt; killers. Do some googling on &quot;Gottman&quot; and &quot;Four Horsemen&quot;... you have
&gt; two of the four signs of a troubled marriage, criticism and contempt.
&gt; You and he need to put a stop to this before your marriage goes into a
&gt; downward spiral.

&gt; I agree with Doug, I would not wait until his work crisis is over to
&gt; address this. His work crisis is no excuse. There will always be
&gt; crisises. This isn't about work - it's about how he handles his
&gt; anxiety and stress.
">

I think you know some of my demons, jen.  Luckily I have been able to
keep panic to a minimum.
This isn't the norm for him, but at one time it was (our long bad
patch).  I think I am scared it will go back to being the norm.  That
is my biggest worry.

&gt; You are not alone in your opinion.  My mom says the same- as she and

&gt; It can be hard, but I have to tell myself, this is *not* the typical

&gt;&gt; You could loose it over caring for your children and home?  Why would
&gt;&gt; any of the demands be so overwhelming you feel that way?

&gt; Because we have such a good system and now it has all gone to pot for
&gt; the time being.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I am trying my best to pick up the slack on our unofficial agreement
&gt;&gt; &gt; of duties around the house and with the kids.  My patience is wearing
&gt;&gt; &gt; thin.

&gt;&gt; Every couple has struggles - regardless of how much $$$$ come into the
&gt;&gt; home.  My wife has a FT demanding profession; as I do.  I help with our
&gt;&gt; son's needs; yet she does more feeling as though she should; saying I
&gt;&gt; need to stay focused because I provide considerably more for the family;
&gt;&gt; I agree.  I provide gardeners and inside cleaning staff.  There after,
&gt;&gt; most of the physical demands around our home fall upon her shoulders and
&gt;&gt; she takes them in stride.

&gt;&gt; I did most of the cooking this wkend, she cleaned up afterwards.  I
&gt;&gt; played golf on Sat and we all watched the PPV movie &quot;Wildhogs&quot; later
&gt;&gt; that evening.  She walked 18 holes with me on Sunday, and I made a great
&gt;&gt; dinner afterwords, even helped my son with his bike problems; and later
&gt;&gt; fell asleep in my chair.  My wife, while in her chair, wrote reports for
&gt;&gt; her work.  I woke up realizing I fell asleep and said &quot;I am beat&quot;,
&gt;&gt; didn't realize I was sleeping - she laughed, and said &quot;you're older.&quot;

&gt;&gt; If your marriage is on the rocks - that's one thing.  But, if it's not -
&gt;&gt; then &quot;why&quot; would your patience be wearing thin????  Correct me if I am
&gt;&gt; wrong; but, wasn't this traditional lifestyle by choice?  Are you not a
&gt;&gt; stay at home mom caring for the children and house while he goes to work
&gt;&gt; and brings in the money allowing you the best &quot;choice&quot; to stay home?

&gt; Hmmm.  No there was no agreement to traditional lifestyle.  We just
&gt; kind of feel into the positions.  I wonder if he resents the fact that
&gt; I don't work.  Not sure.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Feeling like you are going to be taken advantage of by the person you
&gt;&gt; &gt;love.

&gt;&gt; You're part of a team; there's NO &quot;me&quot; in the word team; you've got the
&gt;&gt; home duties, he's got work duties for someone else.  You step up without
&gt;&gt; complaining --- just like he's stepping up to what ever the demands are
&gt;&gt; at work, otherwise he gets fired.   If you don't step up, who's there to
&gt;&gt; fire you.  Who listens to him vent???  Taking advantage???? how so???

&gt; I would like to fire myself sometimes.
&gt; I listen to him vent.
&gt; Guess the taking advantage of is just another chip to add to my
&gt; shoulder.  I am putting forth an effort to get through this hard time,
&gt; but when it comes to an end, I would really like things to go back to
&gt; the old routine, without having to mention it, because then, well it

That question might hold water.  What's interesting is the two of you
have been winging it.. humm - a good reason for troubles and poor
communication.

Although we didn't need the $$ in our home; before we married many
serious value, moral, lifestyle and child care discussions happened.
One is where I told my wife my view and duties as a father - step-father
aside since it's my home; and I preferred her to work for a few reasons.

As a result of her working I saw it easier to build a nice home office
so I could operate my business from home vs driving 60miles to the
office.  Main reason was so someone would be there at all times for our
son.

This move had good and bad consequences for me that were NOT
anticipated... my office became just another part of the home;
accessible by anyone, including the cleaning lady, gardeners, and what
not with questions, affecting my productivity.  I've tried to put my
foot down with limitations, seeing only short term success...  So, I've
learned to live with the consequences for the greater good of &quot;our son.&quot;

Here's how I would handle it: next time he insults you, say &quot;Excuse
ME?&quot; Pause for effect, so you know you have his attention. Then say
(firmly), &quot;I know you are under a lot of stress at work, but if you
value our marriage, you will find another way of dealing with it that
doesn't include insulting me or putting me down.&quot;

Then follow up by touching him - a gentle hand on his arm - and
suggesting that maybe he needs some time to himself to de-stress while
you watch the kids for awhile.

Yes, it means you don't get a break...  but I imagine if he wasn't
insulting and verbally hitting you, you wouldn't mind picking up his
slack quite as much.
