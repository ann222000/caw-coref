I have two PCs: one with Windows XP and one with Windows Vista.  I am
working on programming for the C128 under cc65 and may eventually want
to write C1571 disk images.  I have CBMConvert 2.1.2.  Its
documentation says such support is untested.  Can I get a later
version somewhere?  Or is CBMConvert reliable?  Also, under cc65, how
do I load an emd file on a C64 or C128 from the floppy?

To copy files to a .d71 image.  Or, for that matter, a .d81 image.
Its documentation says that .d71 support is untested, and I don't want
to trust untested code.  .d81 support is both untested and incomplete
and, therefore, not very useful.

Is 64copy DOS?  I want to use it on both WinXP and Win Vista, and I
want long filenames.  Where can I get it?

I would recommend DirMaster. Grab a copy from http://www.style64.org .
It currently supports d64, d71, d81. V2 out in a month or two will
support several more formats.
This is a Win32 program and can support long file names. There is also
limited drag/drop support in V1.

Hi,

Star Commander has had support for .d71/.d81 images for many
years and now has a command line interface for automated tasks,
as well. Yes, it's a DOS software but it runs under (32-bit) XP and
Vista and supports long file names, too.
