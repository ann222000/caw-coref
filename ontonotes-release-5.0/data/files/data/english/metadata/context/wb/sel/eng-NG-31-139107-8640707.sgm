For many years I have been &quot;one of those people&quot; who wake up in the middle
of the night and pig out with little or no restraint. When I was low-cal'ing
I had to keep 800 to 1000 calories on-hold for these nightly binges. When I
started low-carbing, I was sure to keep four or five carbs for the
late-night raid, or just make sure there was some meat in the fridge.

What a site, I'm sure, a big fat guy standing at the fridge in his skivvies
gnawing on a t-bone steak!

Anyhow, for the past week or more I don't think I've woken up once in the
middle of the night to eat. Not by intention, not through discipline, it
just happened by itself.

Another thing is this: I've been an all-day eater for years. Back-and-forth
to the fridge all day long. Now I seem to be eating about four meals a day
and not really being hungry or wanting to snack.

On top of all that, I seem to be getting full on reasonably sized
proportions.

I don't know what it is. Maybe I should get some blook work done! I hope
this stuff sticks! Is this a direct result of low-carbing?

This is the appetite suppression that ketosis (low carb) brings about. I

In short, almost certainly.  Your food binges were probably a result
of large swings in blood sugar, and you don't have those now.

When you eat large amounts of carbs -- as I assume you were on a
low-calorie diet -- you produce large amounts of insulin to deal with
it.  Unless your body has excellent insulin response, producing just
enough and shutting it down at exactly the right time, you'll have
extra insulin floating around in your blood.  Instead of just bringing
your blood sugar back to normal levels, it ends up taking it too low,
and you become hypoglycemic and crave more carbs.

At the same time, the surge of &quot;contentment&quot; chemicals in your brain
like dopamine that was produced when you ate the carbs is subsiding,
so you're feeling out of sorts, and go looking to fix that.  So
there's a chemical/emotional component that works along with the
physical one.

I've known several people who claimed to be hypoglycemic, who -- on
recommendations from their doctors -- would eat some sugar whenever
they felt like their blood sugar was low.  That'd be fine, except they
wouldn't measure their blood sugar and eat exactly the amount they
needed to get it back into the safe range, like an experienced
diabetic might do.  They just threw themselves into a bag of Skittles
until they felt good again.  No attention was ever paid to *why* they
had these episodes, or any attempt made to stop them; they just
&quot;treated&quot; the symptoms with sugar.

Yes.

One of the &quot;criticisms&quot; of low-carb diets is it's the reduction in
appetite that cause the weight loss.  I'm not sure why this is
considered a BAD thing given the plethora of appetite suppressants
available - low-carb modulates hunger naturally.

Some research seems to indicate that fat is the most-satiating of the
macronutrients.  So the typical low-carb diet, tending to be high in
fat, fulfills the appetite in a way that carbs just don't.

Most importantly, low-carb normalizes blood glucose for those who are
pre-diabetic or mildly diabetic.

IMO, there is NOTHING like the hunger of uncontrolled high bg - the
glucose is not getting into your cells, so they are starving.  This
type of hunger is downright PAINFUL to me, very difficult to apply
&quot;willpower&quot; to it.  And yes, it's painful enough to wake me from a
dead sleep.  You can't focus on anything except the overpowering
hunger.

After the withdrawal cravings I suffer during an induction, during
which I can eat INSANE amounts of food, I experience &quot;normal&quot; hunger.
This is something so mild that if I am engrossed in something, I can
literally forget to eat.

IMO, if low-carb works dramatically for you, whether you're diagnosed
with diabetes or not, you have a screwed-up metabolism with regards to
dealing with carbohydrate.

And in that case, low-carbing for life isn't a matter of maintaining
your weight, but of maintaining your eyesight, your ability to have
erections, your extremities, your kidney function, your heart, your
very life.

Intense. Thank you very much! I do have diabetes, T2, although I've been
able to keep it under control for quite a while. Your description of the
blood sugar thing &amp; the major hunger really hits home. I wish I had thought
about poking my finger in the middle of the night on the way to the fridge.
Something like that might have really shined some light on the situation.

Low-carb definitely works for me. It just seems to be a natural way to eat.
I was never a real fruit &amp; vegetable eater. Foods like bread, cake, pasta,
would just drive me over the top. I do accept that low-carbing has to be a
way of life for me, and its not something particularly difficult to accept.

Well, it seems as if the research cited so far isn't claiming that
carbohydrates are satiating foods.

I wonder if there are some anti-fat politics influencing some of these
satiation studies. Of course, &quot;how would one prove that?&quot; is a difficult
question.  There is so much anti-fat mentality that it might inhibit
findings on &quot;good fats&quot;.

Of course, it is now almost compulsory for new diets to acknowledge &quot;bad

Fat raises bg less, more slowly and over a longer-time period than
protein does. Most fat consumed doesn't even get involved in the
biochemical cycles that result in glucose production, but while it's a
minor change, it's not a zero change.

In a diet with a &quot;normal&quot; level of carbs, most of the bg rise is due
to carbs, so the change due to protein is so minor it gets lost in the
noise.  Similarly, in a low-carb diet, the bg change due to protein is
so large, the change due to fat is almost invisible in comparison.
You really only see the bg change due to fat in studies where they
actually have meals that are entirely fat.

In normal non-diabetic people, it *ought* to work that carb causes the
most immediate rise in bg, protein an intermediate rise, and fat the
longest-term rise.  So mixed meals ought to be the most satiety
producing for the longest time-period, assuming a normal metabolism
(which I assume most people here don't have else low-carb wouldn't be
so successful for them).

As I recall, there's studies that show where protein wins the satiety-
contest and others where fat does.  I suspect the variation is related
to the timing of how the study is set up.  Probably if you test
appetite 2-3 hours after the test meal, protein wins and if you test
appetite 4-5 hours after the test meal, fat wins.  That'd be my guess
based on when each of the macronutrients raises bg.

There are people on both sides of this argument as to whether it's
protein or fat that's more satiety-producing.  Given that most foods
that contain one or the other contain both, it's a tricky question.
Probably most of us don't eat nonfat protein-powder shakes or drink
oils very often, so most of the time we're getting protein and fat
together.

Myself, I think a protein-powder shake keeps me satisfied for 3-4
hours with very few calories.  But a cheese omelet lasts a good bit
longer, though it &quot;costs&quot; more calories and still contains protein, so
it's not a direct comparison.

It also seems to me that many people who do diets that are both low-
carb *and* low-fat wind up prone to major binging.  Though one could
argue that is because of a shortage of calories; they're just
generally starving.

When I was at 300: My sugar spiked to 240 regularly, usually between 130 to
150 with the finger poking. Lot of variation in readings. Fat deposits in my
liver &amp; poor liver enzymes. Blood pressure way up there, like 170/140 or
something. Super-high cholesterol. My &quot;total&quot; was way up in the 300's and my
&quot;good&quot; was like 7. This was about three-four years ago, and I was tracking
all this stuff like a hawk.

I don't want to make an excuse of it, but I was in an abusive marriage and
my life really fell apart for a while. Nervous breakdown, more or less.
Severely, clinically depressed. I've been separated/divorcing for about two
years now. It wasn't until the beginning of this year until that I really
started getting my shit back together. I didn't start counting calories
until the middle of June, and didn't buy a scale until the beginning of
July. I had blood work done, I don't know, three or four months ago or
something, and the doctor said everything, including bg, was pretty much
normal.

I did some yo-yo-ing over the past couple years. About a year ago I was once
again pushing 300. On June 12 of this year I was 267.5 at the doctors
office. On July 7 I was 260, just a few pounds down but headed in the right
direction. As of today, Aug 10, I weighed in at 244.5 -- a new low! I'm
feeling pretty good about that and do feel back on-track.

I had blood work done a few months ago. I don't remember the results. They
were all pretty much normal, except for the cholesterol. My sugar was around
100. I'm going to wait a couple months before I do another workup, in order
to let my body adjust to low-carb. This next time around I'll ask for a copy
of the results and look at it very closely like you are doing.

Anyway, sorry, kinda went off there. I'm not on any meds at this time, have
never been on meds for diabetes, don't know what my current blood levels
are, and because I just started low-carbing, I probably won't go in for
blood tests for another couple months.

Practically speaking, that is true enough.

Diabetics on a high-carb diet only calculate their insulin boluses
based on carb counting.  Because for them, the amount of increase due
to protein is so minimal.

Similarly, on a low-carb diet, I only calculate my insulin based on
carb and protein (with the larger proportion of insulin due to
protein), because the increase due to fat is too small to be noticed
in comparison.

However, if I ate meals that were 100% fat, I'd have to calculate
based on fat, as all my bg increase would be from fat.

Fat *does* raise bg... just the amount is as tiny in comparison to
protein, just as the amount protein raises it is tiny in comparison to
carb.

So the Eades aren't really wrong in saying fat doesn't raise bg...
they are recommending a diet that is low-carb and adequate-protein,
and the rise due to fat wouldn't be measurable with those other
macronutrients in the meal.

The studies I'm recalling are VERY old... we're talking 20 years or
so, back when I was in grad school.  They showed the increases due to
each macronutrient by actually feeding meals only consisting of that
macronutrient.

I didn't come to the conclusions Dr. B did looking at the same things,
but then I didn't have a meter to test my conclusions, I just
guessed.  I *did* notice what he did, that veterinary recommendations
differed wildly from human recommendations and that the stuff the ADA
said was crazy and made no sense in light of what carbs did to bg in
Type 2s according to the research I saw.

My first &quot;diabetic diet&quot; was... I came to the conclusion that every
meal I ate should consist of a small amount of carb, a medium amount
of protein and a large amount of fat, and that I should eat every 6
hours round the clock to most normalize my bg.  I recall setting an
alarm for 2 AM to eat a ham &amp; mayo sandwich on a corn muffin on my
nightstand.

And now we've gone full circle on this thread when we start talking
about PURPOSELY getting up in the middle of the night to eat.  ;)

When you think about it, this makes sense.  Sure your body can and
does use alternative pathways to produce energy when it is
metabolising fat, it doesn't just use glucose for energy. But think
about what fat is FOR.  Fat is for keeping you alive when you're
starving.   You need SOME glucose - if when you were starving, your bg
dropped top 0, you'd die.  If you're literally starving, you need SOME
source of bg - fat would not be a very useful storage product if it
couldn't produce some.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; You really only see the bg change due to fat in studies where they
&gt; &gt; actually have meals that are entirely fat.

&gt; Isn't that the only time the fat has any impact?  It's such an
&gt; inefficient process to convert to glucose and I thought the body takes
&gt; the easy route first?

I don't know that none of the fat *is* converted when you eat a mixed
meal.  But I don't think the amount converted would be measurable in
comparison to protein and carbs; the signal gets lost in the noise.

&gt; Not so much comes down on fat for satiety.  Roger challenged me on a
&gt; similar statement about it last year or so, and there was little
&gt; substantiating fat leading to satiety.  It's almost all protein related
&gt; in the research.  Of course, pure fat nutrition isn't studied much.  :-)

I thought I remembered seeing studies both ways; perhaps I am
misremembering.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think protein with fat is likely the highest satiety rate as well;

I don't think fat slows down the conversion of protein though.  It
slows down the rise due to carbs directly.

BTW, I saw a very interesting recent study on bg levels in normal
nondiabetic people.  You might find the Powerpoint presentation
interesting: http://www.diabetes-symposium.org/index.php?menu=view&amp;chart;=1&amp;id;=322

It seems to show nondiabetics spike around 45 minutes after meals.
The most interesting bit to me was that they all look to have Dawn
Phenomenon, with significantly larger spikes at breakfast than other
meals!

It sounds like you've improved your health a great deal.

">

As far as I can tell, both.

I'm reading &quot;Pumping Insulin&quot; right now, which is considered the bible
for pumps, which are used much more often by T1s than for T2s.
However, the book addresses both.

The author has calculations for the ideal diabetic diet.  He thinks I
should be eating well above 200g carb/day, in order to &quot;minimize the
cardiac risk due to high fat&quot; and &quot;minimize the kidney risk due to
excess protein&quot;.  On that diet, carb-counting is necessary, but not
protein-counting.

His rules for calculating insulin just don't work for me.  I had run
across his rules before getting the book (the 500 rule, the 1800 rule,
etc.).  His method gives dosages that are wildly off for many of my
meals.

If I sit down to a big salad and a bunless cheeseburger, almost all
the actual bg rise I experience is due to protein as there's almost no
carb in that meal.  So the carb-counting method doesn't work, I have
to bolus based on the protein.

On the other hand, if I sit down to a meal of cottage cheese and
blueberries (which has almost as much carb as protein), the carb is
primary and the protein can be ignored.  Which means Bernstein's way
of calculating where most of the insulin dose is due to protein
doesn't work for that meal.

I'm finding this all a bit confusing right now because I do have a lot
of variation in my meals.  My overall diet is low-carb, but some of my
individual meals are more Zone-like.

I see this a lot more trying to figure out how to use insulin than I
did just trying to keep carbs low overall prior to insulin.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Right, I was referring only to dietary fat and its effect on satiety, as

You're probably right as I haven't done a literature review on this.
My memory of studies going either way may be off.

Well, pretty much ALL the biochemical pathways happen all the time to

I bow to your more recent search!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; BTW, I saw a very interesting recent study on bg levels in normal
&gt; &gt; nondiabetic people.  You might find the Powerpoint presentation
&gt; &gt; interesting: http://www.diabetes-symposium.org/index.php?menu=view&amp;chart;=1&amp;id;=322

&gt; &gt; It seems to show nondiabetics spike around 45 minutes after meals.
&gt; &gt; The most interesting bit to me was that they all look to have Dawn
&gt; &gt; Phenomenon, with significantly larger spikes at breakfast than other
&gt; &gt; meals!

&gt; That's because so many folks who've got IGT or even DM are being called
&gt; non DM due to inappropriately high &quot;normal&quot; ranges!!  Just look at the
&gt; literature on neuropathy and other DM complications in &quot;non DM&quot; folks
&gt; who are &quot;IGT.&quot;
">

They had a group they called nondiabetic based on A1c.  I don't recall
the actual range reported, but it was somewhere in the 4.5 to 5.5 area
or so.  And yes, it occurred to me that those on the high end of that
are likely prediabetic, but it wasn't nuts like thinking everyone
under 7% is normal.

However, they didn't just report averages in that presentation, they
had graphs of ALL the folks bg profiles.  And ALL of them spiked 45
minutes after meals and pretty much all of them had worse spikes after
breakfast!  The absolute worst spike was 160 - and yeah, that person
is probably going to be diabetic someday, but even the BEST profiles
had spikes too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My peak is also between 45-50 minutes; most folks are, anecdotally.
">

Mine was before insulin.  On Humalog, it moved to 2 hours.  Now on
Regular, it seems to have moved back.

Humalog is sort of a high-carb insulin, it works fast like carbs (and
in fact, the pumping book recommends it for this, and other,
reasons).  Regular is more of a low-carbing type of insulin - better
coverage for a slower rise as per a more protein-oriented diet.

I haven't worked out the differences in using Regular vs. Humalog just
yet.  Had a spike to over 200 just last night... with the cottage
cheese and blueberry meal, as a matter of fact.  I've only been on
Regular a couple days - I haven't gotten it optimized.

And yet... I am fine according to Bernstein, who has you measure
preprandial, to test that your got back down to normal bg before the
next meal.   IMO, his testing method isn't sufficient unless you are
actually on his diet to minimize spikes.  I don't find 6-12-12
sustainable myself, and I *am* going to eat a cup of blueberries now
and then, so I'm having to figure a lot out myself.

This has morphed into a post more appropriate for ASD than here...

&gt; Have you ever considered the pit/adrenal angle, given your poor response
&gt; to metformin?  Researchers found that at least 10% of type 2 DMs have
&gt; occult Cushing's syndrome.  I'm one, and I became Addisonian during a
&gt; year on metformin, gradually and insidiously.  The tests have a very
&gt; high false negative rate, so I'm guessing that's actually a MUCH higher %.
">

My sister has Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH).  In fact, she was
one of the first kids born with the severe salt-wasting form that
survived, as they'd just figured out that cortisol and aldosterone
replacement therapy was the answer.  The medical literature is full of
references to her, not by name of course, but the case and the timing
and all - it's obviously her.

I was on my way to becoming an expert on adrenals when I was diagnosed
with diabetes and changed my motivation for hanging out in the library
(although, avoiding drugery in the lab was ALWAYS the primary
reason!).  Possibly carrying the gene for one disease wasn't as
interesting as actually having another.  ;)

I know what both Cushing's and Addison's look like... my sister nearly
always had one or the other as they rarely had her dosages just right
as she was growing up.  There's pictures in my photo albums that
absolutely look like Cushings, with the round face and fat neck, and
others that look like Addison's... pale and thin and frail-looking.
Amazing how a year would make such a huge difference depending on her
cortisol dose - she'd go from moon-face to anorexic-looking.

It's been probably nearly a decade since I had my adrenals tested.  I
had about eight month's worth of a flu-like GI problem that left my
doctors baffled as to it's cause (they never found a cause, it
eventually just resolved itself).  I asked to be tested for late-onset
CAH and was referred to an endo who ran some huge number of tests
since I am considered pretty high-risk for late-onselt CAH (though I
can't say which ones anymore, I don't remember).  Anyway, the endo
thought I had nice healthy adrenals, though I'm hearing you say
there's a false positive rate.

Now that you mention it though... my problems with metformin do
resemble Addison's.  I don't have the GI problems most people get.
Rather, I get weaker and more tired, and if I stay on it long enough,
I wind up too exhausted to get out of bed.  It's very annoying because
I *like* metformin and approve of it highly, I think it's the best
diabetes drug we have - but it doesn't like me.  I've been bugging my
daughter to get on it as I think she has PCOS.

Why would metformin affect cortisol like that though?  A quick google
showed up this article: http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/86/9/4187
- which says in part &quot;There was no detectable effect of metformin on
epinephrine, norepinephrine, ACTH, cortisol, glucagon, or autonomic
symptomatic response to hypoglycemia (P &gt; 0.05 for all comparisons),
except that metformin slightly increased the response of GH to
hypoglycemia (P = 0.039).&quot;

Anyway, since I have DP, it seems my cortisol must be sufficient - it
darned sure must be rising every morning anyways!  Also... if it were
CAH, I'd have an excess of testosterone occuring, and I don't have the
symptoms of that, if anything, I have the symptoms of lwoered
testosterone.

And on the other hand, I don't look like someone with Cushings, so if
I overproduce cortisol, it must be to a minor degree.

What do you take for Cushings?

&gt; complications are already developing.

Sure, but for a diabetic to have an A1c under 5.5, they have to KNOW
they have diabetes and be working damned hard at controlling it.

These were all young people, mostly in their 20s, and not known
diabetics.  So while there were probably some folks who will be
diabetic someday in the pool, it looked to me to be mostly
nondiabeteics.

Yeah, I know.  It seems to me that having my peak closer to normal
must be better, but I've never seen anything indicative of the timing
of peaks, just about their size.

I don't have the &quot;hang&quot; of Regular just yet either.  Also, I probably
shouldn't have started splitting my Lantus dose at the same time that
I switched to Regular as I'm not sure which effects are due to which
change.

Regular is kinda scary.  With Humlaog, I took the shot as I sat down
to eat.  With Regular, you have to remember to eat so you don't go
hypo.  The thing is, I am so easily distracted.  I keep worrying I'm
going to forget and then wind up hypo.

Like I said, this book is supposed to be the bible for pumping, and it

I don't know much about PCOS, just the typical symptoms, which makes it
sound like my daughter has it.

She's diabetic also, but maybe not diagnosable yet.  Her doctor sent her
for a GTT and told her that if she didn't go over *200* - she passed.  I
told her that her doctor is a moron and sent her the AACE guidelines to
educate him with.

I also told her she can ask for metformin whether he thinks she's
diabetic or not, it's common to prescribe it for prediabetes too, and
I'm SURE she qualifies as prediabetic on a GTT, just based on the few
meter readings I've done on her.

Can't convince her to low-carb though - she's addicted to starch.  I
guess I hoped she'd get a diagnosis and start learning on her own since
what Mom says isn't good enough.  ;)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  From all my digging, insulin lowers cortisol binding globulin.  In the

&gt; used to running on higher levels.

OK, that makes sense.  Sounds analogous to people who go hypo at normal
bg because they're used to running high.  I wonder if you can gradually
accustom yourself to it like you can to normal bg.  Because I'm thinking
about asking to try metformin again.

Probably not for a while though.  I'm currently on Lantus and Regular
insulins, Lisinopril, aspirin, Metoprolol, Pravastatin, a Fentanyl
patch, Percocet and I just started Chantix.  I hope to get off the patch
next week and off the statin next month, and of course the Chantix is
just for a few weeks.  So... I want to get off a bunch of this crap
before trying metformin again.

I'm thinking to try it at very low doses and titrate upwards VERY
slowly, like after a month or so.

&gt; I look nothing like someone with Cushing's.  Size 6-10, depending on the

&gt; Nothing, you test for a year or two to get a dx.  You get pituitary
&gt; surgery and/or adrenal surgery.  Cushing's tends to be cyclical, with a
&gt; lot of AI episodes.  In those with steady state extreme high cortisol,
&gt; they treat short term with ketoconazole to inhibit cortisol biosynthesis
&gt; in the adrenals.  Most of us would go into AI from it.
">

It sounds like you have more cyclical problems than specifically an
insufficiency or an oversupply of cortisol.  Which would make sense
since you don't have the Cushing-like symptoms that would be expected
from just high cortisol.

What are you doing about it?  You will be having surgery?

I found a site last night (don't have the URL handy) that compared
symptoms of adrenal and thyroid problems.  According to it, I am more
likely to have thyroid issues than adrenal ones.  I had already planned
to ask the cardio for a thyroid workup just in case, as from what I've
read, thyroid problems are the highest risk factor for CVD, worse than
diabetes and smoking even.  And when we were measuring my temperature
each morning, the first few weeks out of the hospital, it was rarely as
high as 97.

I just have to focus on one thing at a time as I have too damned many
health issues right now.  The cardiac stuff is primary of course, but
then everything else effects that too, so it's not like I can just
postpone the other stuff.  It's kinda overwhelming to have this much
stuff wrong.

I think I view it differently.  I know even a slight increase in A1c

the ADA, but not as strict as you!

&gt; You're on a LOT of adrenal suppressive meds!  Statins inhibit adrenal

&gt; and IR! Percocet suppressed adrenals/ACTH.  Then the insulins and
&gt; possibly the others.  You may find that all you need for bp, BTW, is K
&gt; dur twice per day. Primary hyperaldosteronism is the most common cause
&gt; of refractory ht in DM.

When you arrive in the ER screaming in pain, you don't argue with them
about the meds they give you.  The first thing they gave me was IV
morphine, and I was not capable of thinking properly again until several
weeks after the hospitalization.  Normally, I don't take meds without
reviewing them first, but I was on most of this crap before I was
capable of thinking.

My first priority is getting off the Fentanyl patch, which has the
scariest prescribing information of anything I've ever even considered.
The Percocet will remain until I don't need them, and I expect usage
may get a bit heavier once I'm off the patch before it trails off.  My
next priority is going to be getting off the statin; I plan to just tell
the cardiologist at my appointment next month that I refuse to refill
that.  And I should be off the Chantix in a few weeks.

The insulins have been massively decreased - I began at 45u Lantus and
have dropped to 25u; began at 12u Humalog and dropped to 3-6u.  So
there's improvement on that end.  But my bg was running in the 300s
without insulin, so I gots to do what I gots to do.

The beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor - well, I figure as my diabetes
improves, my bloodwork and bp will improve, giving me ammo to argue
against continuing these.  If I can't get enough improvement via bg
control, I'll look at supplements.  Have to see how it goes.

&gt; Good for you for quitting smoking!
">

Haven't got there yet, I'm only on my second day of Chantix.

But yeah, I realized that the energy I'm focusing on bg control was
getting a bit silly with the smoking continuing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The insulins have been massively decreased - I began at 45u Lantus and
&gt;&gt; have dropped to 25u; began at 12u Humalog and dropped to 3-6u.  So
&gt;&gt; there's improvement on that end.  But my bg was running in the 300s
&gt;&gt; without insulin, so I gots to do what I gots to do.

&gt; YOIKS.  Yes, but all the while investigating the causes, too.
">

Probably the pancreasitis attack I had about a year and a half ago as I
lost bg control subsequent to that.

Even prior to that, I could have benefitted from a basal insulin as my
fbg ran over 100 consistently, more often close to 140.  I never peaked
bad, my postprandials running 140-160 or so, so apparently I had a good
solid phase 2 response, just bad background.

But it ALL got fucked up once the pancreasitis happened.  No amount of
low-carbing got me under 300.  I even did 3-4 days of fasting and
couldn't get it down.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor - well, I figure as my diabetes
&gt;&gt; improves, my bloodwork and bp will improve, giving me ammo to argue
&gt;&gt; against continuing these.  If I can't get enough improvement via bg
&gt;&gt; control, I'll look at supplements.  Have to see how it goes.

&gt; Okay, but here's the thing.  They may be making your control worse, the
&gt; way metformin did in my case.  If they're kicking your pituitary into
&gt; ACTH overdrive, cortisol could be what's pushing up your bg, especially
&gt; whe stressed by pain, as well.
">

I'm *sure* I'm overproducing cortisol regardless of the meds.  Pain and
stress are part of it, sure, but there's also lotsa personal stuff going
on.  Recurrent depression too.  It never rains, but it pours.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Right now, being tired and exhausted, I assume it's because of
&gt;&gt; recovering from the surgeries rather than endocrine effects.

&gt; Probably so.  But stress hormones kick into overdrive at times like
&gt; this.  If they're compromised, the exhaustion can be much worse and
&gt; prolonged.
">

The surgeon told me I'd be back to normal in three months.  Well, it's
been eleven weeks and I'm not NEAR back to normal yet.  I'm supposed to
be able to drive now, but I don't think I could even handle steering,
let alone shifting.

I have figured a year for recovery.  That is my primary &quot;job&quot; this year,
recovering and building my health.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Yes, I do remember... still, metformin seems the *best* diabetes drug
&gt;&gt; there is other than the insulins.  It's also the most tested one,
&gt;&gt; short of some of the older OHAs.

&gt; I completely agree with you about the drug; FOR OTHER PEOPLE.  I tried
&gt; it so many times, to my own detriment, because of my similar beliefs.
">

I'll have to consider it.  Cause yeah, my experience is similar to yours.

Given that 3 of my meds do lotsa stuff to the liver, I'd have to come
off of a lot of that before giving metformin another try anyways.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I've seen zero increase in my bg since getting off metformin.  My A1c is
&gt; identical.  The diff is that may fasting and premeal numbers are higher
&gt; and my post meal numbers, on extreme low carb, are lower than ever now
&gt; that I'm not suppressed.  It helps a lot not to eat any starches or sugars.
">

It sounds like you might benefit from a basal insulin yourself.  That is
pretty much what my pattern was prior to the pancreasitis, high fbg, but
teeny, tiny postprandial spikes.  Starting from a baseline of 100-140,
140-160 is almost NO spike.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The K Dur completely keeps muscle spasms at bay.  There's not much else
&gt; to do other than avoid things that unnecessarily stim or suppress my
&gt; adrenals.  I have big ups and downs, and am trying to catch the ups on
&gt; more tests so I can get my surgery referral.
">

Wouldn't it be simpler just to use Lite Salt?

Do you have aldosterone issues as well as cortisol issues?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If thyroid was low, were you ever treated for that directly?

&gt; The only time it went that low was after Atkins induction and I had a
&gt; paralyzing depression for the only time in my life. Cytomel quickly
&gt; pulled me out of it, and once I took high dose chromium, for some
&gt; reason, I no longer needed the Cytomel.  Cortisol suppresses both T3 and
&gt; TSH, and mine have typically been very low normal.
">

I'm sitting here trying to think about how chromium would effect thyroid.

The problem with the endocrine system is it's too damned complicated and
everything effects everything else.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I also think the &quot;normal&quot; Western diet is not what we evolved for.  So
&gt;&gt; someone might run a HbgA1c of 5.1 indefinetly just because they have a
&gt;&gt; crappy diet, but not having the genes for T2, they never go beyond that.

&gt; I don't think genes determine; I think that's why we have an epidemic of
&gt; pediatric type 2; the crappy diet.
">

I agree the diet causes it, but don't think that lessens the genetic
component.  If it were just diet, everyone would get it.  I think as our
diet has gotten worse, those people that would've become diabetic in
their 40s or 50s or even later are getting it earlier now.

In my own family, my dad was diagnosed in his late 30s, I was in my
early 30's, and my daughter likely will be in her 20s (she's 23 now).
If the typical &quot;normal&quot; diet keeps disintegrating as it has in the past
few decades, any grandchildren I have will be diagnosed before adulthood
and my great-grandchildren before puberty.

But still, there are people like my maternal grandmother, who has
literally been a sugar addict her whole life.  She HIDES candy in her
closet to binge on and has been doing it for decades.  She's like an
alcoholic but with sugar instead of alcohol.  And she's 105 years old
with no sign of diabetes yet.  I should've gotten my genes from that
side of the family instead of the paternal side!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; How have you determined you're not IR?

&gt; My fasting insulin (handled properly by the lab) is 5.7 now.  Years ago
&gt; it was 8.5
">

That your numbers didn't worsen when you went off metformin is a big
clue also.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I've been thin and I've been overweight.  I lost 34 lbs last year while
&gt; Addisonian (nausea, anorexia).  Now, all the fat I do have is right
&gt; above the waist of my pants.  I've had a hump many years ago, don't have
&gt; it now.  Had red face, not now.  Cyclical.  I've never been larger than
&gt; a size 12 in my life, though.  I also, after decades of steroids, have
&gt; extraordinarily high bone density; family genetic mutation.
">

I don't think I can even TELL what kind of symptoms I have because I'm
on too damned many drugs with too many side effects.

I have low-level nausea nearly every day, a few days it upgraded itself
and I couldn't keep anything down all day.  And then there's the pain,
and the depression... both of which come-and-go to some degree.

&gt; Yeah, wow.  Depression and anxiety are also caused by elevated cortisol,
&gt; not a cause of it.  In fact, new drugs targeting CRH are in development.
&gt; In my family with the glucocorticoid resistance, there's a lot of

My family has mostly addictions/mental issues on my mom's side and
diabetes on the my dad's side.  Of my 3 siblings, all 3 have had
alcohol/drug problems, 2 are diabetic and 1 has CAH.  So I have a crappy
genetic inheritance.

And I am here to tell you, BYPASS is a cause of depression.  Just by
itself.  Says so in the literature they gave me, which made me laugh, as
what the hell could be depressing about that?  ;)

Many years ago, I had a doctor explain to me how I wouldn't feel the
biopsy because &quot;there's no nerve endings in the cervix.&quot;  I'm sure she
learned otherwise as she was very pregnant when she did my biopsy.

&gt;&gt; Do you have aldosterone issues as well as cortisol issues?

&gt; Looks that way; folks usually do.  It appears to be extremely common in
&gt; type 2 DM ht.

Usually do?  Hmmm... mebbe if the adenals are generically
understimulated or overstimulated.  CAH is different in that most people
with it don't have the salt-watsing form of the disease.  It depends on
which enzyme they can't make.

That simply points to how the environment effects gene expression.  It
doesn't point to it being *only* environmental though, else all 5 year
olds on the same diet would be diabetic, which is not the case.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I also am eating lower carb and more consistently than I ever have in my

Constistency is my biggest challenge now - not working and periodic

weeks of constistency would do more for my bg than anything else I could

&gt; That could possibly all be adrenal insufficiency related.  Seriously,

&gt; vision, bowel stuff, vertigo or lightheadedness, etc.

&gt; I hope this all improves a lot very soon.

Fentanyl and Percocet both cause constipation, so I'm on a stool
softener.  I don't have headache, I just have... confusion, losing track
of stuff, exhausiton, oversleeping, etc.  But... this is cause I'm
STONED.  I can't expect an improvement in those symptoms until I'm off
the narcotics.  And then I'll notice the symptoms caused by the less
powerful drugs.

Ah, then we agree!

Cause yes, I think the diet changes are crazy and are certainly fucking
things up.  We didn't have glow-in-the-dark food when I was a kid.  Soda
was something that happened 4 or 5 times a year.  Groceries stores
mostly carried real food, there were only a handful of brands of
sugar-coated cereal (and most moms wouldn't buy it, mine wouldn't).

Grocery shopping is when I really rant about this, the stores are HUGE
and therefore much less convenient to shop in.  And  in spite of the
space to make room for all this CRAP, there's more and more real food
items you have to make an extra stop for cause most stores just don't
sell it anymore.

&gt; Once you get into the rhythm it's easy.  I don't even think about it any

That's what I need to do, rather than wonder if I should really take my
morning meds with the meal at 2 PM...  ;)

I can't remember which one, but one of the low-carb books I've read
suggests that 25% or less of the population have no tendency toward
insulin resistance at all, while the other 75% or more are in a range
from very likely to less likely.  A high-carb diet fattens up some
people while they're still kids; some others don't have trouble until
they're 40 and then are fighting with heart problems by their 50s; and
some stay thin and seem very healthy all their lives but are
eventually put on diabetic meds (along with other drugs) in their 90s.

I suspect that almost all humans would develop diabetes, if they ate a
high-carb diet for life and managed to not die early of anything else.
Especially today's high-carb, low-fat, corn syrup diet, which is very
different from the potatoes and gravy diet of just 30 years ago.

I don't think I can go off insulin and keep my bg reasonable.  Fasting
would let me cut out the 15-25 u I bolus with meals, but I'm also on 25
u basal.

I have been decreasing and tweaking the insulin doses, but seem to have
reached a limit now.  So next is lifestyle changes, which may allow me
to lower insulin further.
