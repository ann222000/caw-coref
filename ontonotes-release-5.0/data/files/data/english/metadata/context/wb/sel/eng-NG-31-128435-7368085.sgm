You may have received an email from me that I received from
AnswerCoalition about the March 17 Demonstration.  It seems that our
Attorney General of Virginia is trying to extort a large amount of
cash from Answer in order to allow the Pentagon march to take place.
We are talking about a 100 yard stretch along Route 27.  Please write
the Attorney General today.  We should not, as Americans and tax-
paying Virginians, be denyed the right to walk down this road.  You
can for good measure, write the Governor of VA.

Dear Nancy,

We spoke on the phone on Saturday. I wanted to make sure you saw the
alert that came out today which includes an easy-to-use online
mechanism to send letters to the attorney general of Virginia.
Anything you can do to spread the word about this alert would be
great.

Using the "Email This Page" button ensures that the email retains the
original formatting. If you want a text-only version, just let me know
and I can send it.

Free speech battle for the March on the Pentagon:
How you can help

We want to thank all of the supporters of the March on the Pentagon
for their support in the recent days. The government's effort to
obstruct the demonstration and put a huge price tag on Free Speech
rights is making people more determined to come to Washington D.C. on
March 17.

The State of Virginia Department of Transportation finally met with us
last Thursday afternoon, February 22. At that meeting they demanded
that we obtain one million dollars in insurance, hire an engineering
firm to determine their traffic and road closure plan, and agree to
pay a user fee of thousands and possibly tens of thousands of dollars
for before we will be given a permit to march on Route 27 on the way
to the Pentagon. We are talking about a stretch of highway under
Virginia's jurisdiction that is about 100 yards long.

This is not the first time that the ANSWER Coalition has had to wage a
struggle to defend the First Amendment. We have prevailed before and
we will again. We will succeed with the help of thousands of people
committed both to ending the war and defending the Bill of Rights.

We need everyone's help in two areas:

One thing you can do is to provide political support for the public
Free Speech campaign. We are mounting a large scale legal and
political effort to secure our rights. We have the best constitutional
rights attorneys assisting us and we hope everyone will read the
letter below from the Partnership for Civil Justice to Virginia's
Attorney General.

Please take a moment to send your own letter to the Attorney General
of Virginia, telling him that the ongoing obstruction of this
demonstration must end, that a permit must be issued for this First
Amendment protected activity, without cost and without further delay.
By clicking this link you can see a sample letter which you can
customize and send via email through an easy to use mechanism we have
set up on the MarchOnPentagon.org site.

The second vital area in which you can help is by making an urgently
needed donation to help us pay the staggering costs for the March on
the Pentagon. We need to raise $100,000 in the coming days. The
contracts for stage, sound and other logistical needs for a mass
protest must be paid. The State of Virginia has driven up our costs by
delaying in the issuing of permits. They hope that we will consider
the task too daunting. But we are determined and the people are coming
in large numbers to March on the Pentagon. Please make a donation
today. We want to thank the many people who have contributed in the
recent week to support the March on the Pentagon. We urge everyone to
do their part. If you've never donated, please consider doing so now.
If you've made a donation already and you can give again, please act
today. You can make an online donation today by clicking on this
link.
The momentum for the mobilization is hard to keep up with. Every day
we learn of several new cities that are providing buses. There are now
200 cities at least that are organizing buses and caravans to come to
Washington DC.

Many thousands of veterans of the Iraq war, veterans of past and
present wars and soldiers' families will be in the front ranks of the
demonstration.

A Student and Youth Contingent will be a big part of the march. There
are buses coming from college campuses and high schools all over the
country.

Thank you again for your commitment and support in the Free Speech
fight. Please be sure to read our lawyer's letter to the Attorney
General of Virginia. If you can help with a donation there is no
better time. Click this link to donate now.
