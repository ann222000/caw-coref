since you mentioned before you are from Croatia I just got around to looking
up your country. I could not find it on my home map (1980's map I guess I
knew it being Yugoslavia) I googled it. a very beautiful place!!! but a
tough past.
I recently read a book  &quot;Bonewoman&quot;( I think) and she talked about your
country and others and aftermath of the war where her and her people put
names on bodies in mass graves or at least tried to and brought &quot;faces&quot; to
the attention of the UN courts.
Sounds like it was a rough time to go through, esp alone and not have the
world helping to stop it before it came to such a disaster.
Thank you for perking my interest

Croatia was independent since the 7th century AD, and was pretty much
always involved in some war. Especially since the Ottoman Turks broke
into the Balkans in the 14th century. They also seeded the seed of
trouble for many generations to come. And so on, I suggest you check
out the Wiki for some introductory facts:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Croatia

Regarding the recent war, the saddest thing is that most of the world
saw it as a civil war in Yugoslavia. That could not be further from
the truth. Yugoslavia was a centralistic federation much like the
USSR, just much smaller. What the Russians were in the USSR, the Serbs
were in Yugoslavia. The war broke out when after decades of communist
terror, the tide that started with the fall of the Berlin Wall,
arrived to many communist countries, and it was just a matter of time
when our striving for independence would cause the centralistic Serb
government to spill terror en masse.
Atrocities. Every war has them, there were atrocities on every side
involved, as it was in every single war ever fought. The sad thing is,
and this applies to Bosnia, that no one won the war; many thousands of
people died for absolutely nothing. Today's teens in Bosnia have the
least amount of national and religious tolerance than many generations
before them. The conflict is not solved. It is lingering on. And God
forbid, but it will rise it's ugly head again, mark my words.
Because the world could not care less. And is not able to solve
anything. Example? Srebrenica is a Bosnian town with a majority
Bosniak/Muslim population before the war and up until 1995, near the
end of the war. The Serbs came in, slaughtered thousands and thousands
of civilians. Not because of some rage or retaliation or anything, but
because the knew what they wanted. And they got it. The world and the
powers to be declared Srebrenica part of The Serb Republic inside of
Bosnia. They awarded the beast for it's horrific deed. And that is
just one example. Look:

&quot;The United Nations had previously declared Srebrenica a UN protected
&quot;safe area&quot;, but they did not prevent the massacre, even though 400
armed Dutch peacekeepers were present at the time.[11] The massacre
included several instances where preteen children, women, and elderly
civilians were also killed.[12] The list of people missing or killed
in Srebrenica compiled by the Federal Commission of Missing Persons so
far includes 8,373 names.[13]&quot;

But that's enough, this is not a political newsgroup. If you have any
further questions I will be happy to answer your emails :-)

See what you started!  Croatia did belong to Austria from 1867 to 1918
so you see YOU ARE MINE, ALL MINE

Also, it may interest you to know, that I was married in Dubrovnic,
well actually above in a small Railroad town, called Scoplje and they
roasted two whole pigs and ONE chicken for the wedding party.

Ich hoffe alles ist gut (dobra) mit Dir und Deiner familie.

Mit liebe
Lizzy

Two whole pigs? Cool.

Tiho, we here at CNN remember Srebrenica well, and try to remind
people of it every chance we get. I do believe it's one of those
things people should not be allowed to forget.

The Austrian rule was one the nicer periods for Croatia in recent
history. Many things were built, railroads, schools. Even Bosnia
prospered for the short while it was Anschlussed.
Many older people still speak of the Franz Joseph times with respect!

Ashley. I think every nation has it's own share of tragedies. The
world can not be asked to remember every tragedy all over the world.
We would soon be thinking about nothing else....

But I think it is important that those nations that were involved
never forget. History has a bad habit of repeating itself.
My grandfather's brother was killed by Tito's communists in cold blood
*after* the war in 1945, along with at least 50.000 other soldiers and
civilians. *Not* counting the communist executions from 1946-1990. We
do not know where his bones lay, to this day. No one was ever
prosecuted for that massacre. Not even a finger was pointed, even
after our independency in 1991. During Yugoslavia those who asked got
silenced, one way or the other.

Have a look:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleiburg_massacre

But do forget soon. We humans produce so much misery that no sane
person can deal with it all.
Learn from all of them but, for your own sake, remember only those
that are close to you.

Not right yet but things slow down I might have a few. Thank you Tiho for
really taking the time to talk about your country. I was never really good
at school and it seems like I missed huge huge gaps and just now getting an
idea what is going on outside of my little world.
