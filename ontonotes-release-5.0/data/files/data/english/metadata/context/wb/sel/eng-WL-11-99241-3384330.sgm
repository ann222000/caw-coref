Oil-Thirsty China Faces Challenge in Nigeria

As reported yesterday, the giant Chinese state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) has reached a deal to buy a 45 percent stake in a Nigerian oil field for more than $2 billion. If approved by both governments, the deal would be China's first major venture into oil-rich Nigeria; and it would also be an impressive comeback of sorts following CNOOC's failed bid last year to buy the major American oil company Unocal.

Or would it?

On the one hand, the Nigerian deal is part of China's global quest for foreign energy sources to quench a mounting thirst for oil caused by its rapidly expanding economy. On the other hand, analysts say, the Nigerian bid will not be easy for CNOOC, which has no experience in dealing with Nigeria--a country rated as a difficult place to do business, to put it mildly. The international anti-corruption group Transparency International ranks Nigeria as the sixth most corrupt nation in the world.

James Brock, an independent energy consultant based in Beijing, points out that western oil corporations with much more experience than CNOOC have faced serious challenges in Nigeria--and he expects CNOOC's experience to be no different.

"The western companies such as Shell and Chevron did not bid on this block and that would imply they didn't believe the values were there," Brock says. "So this is certainly a hurdle which CNOOC will have to overcome."

Brock notes that India last month blocked a bid for the same Nigerian stake by its state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, saying it was not commercially viable.

Despite the pitfalls, the consensus among energy analysts worldwide is that China essentially has no choice but to take substantial risks as its energy needs continue to mount. Alternative fuels may have significant longterm potential for Rising China; but Beijing's immediate need is to lock in preferred access to overseas oil and gas fields.

China's need for new oil sources is also driving the country to strengthen ties with the left-leaning, populist president-elect of Bolivia, Evo Morales, whose country has vast gas reserves. Morales, who has pledged to nationalize the Bolivian gas industry, visited Beijing this week and received Chinese assurances of aid and trade deals.
