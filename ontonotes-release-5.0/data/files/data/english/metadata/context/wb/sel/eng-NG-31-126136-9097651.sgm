Please join in this FLY THE FLAG campaign and PLEASE forward this
immediately to everyone in your address book asking them to also
forward it. We have a little less than one week and counting to get
the word out all across the US.

If you forward this via email to least 11 people and each of those
people do the same --you do the math.

THE PROGRAM:
On Tuesday, September 11th, 2007, an American flag should be displayed
outside every home, apartment, office, and store in the United States.
Every individual should make it their duty to display an American flag
on this anniversary of our country's worst tragedy.
We do this to honor:
· Those who lost their lives on 9/11 -- and their families, friends
and loved ones
who continue to endure the pain of their loss.
·  Our Armed Forces who at this very moment are fighting at home and
abroad to
preserve our cherished freedoms.

In the days, weeks and months following 9/11 the country was awash in
American flags as citizens mourned the incredible losses and stood
shoulder-to-shoulder against terrorism.  Patriotism pulled us through
some tough times -- it shouldn't take another attack to galvanize us
in solidarity. The American flag is the fabric of our country;
together we can prevail over terrorism both foreign and domestic

Action Plan:
· Forward this via email to everyone you know (at least 11 people).
Do not be the one to break this chain - take a moment to think back
to how you
felt on 9/11 and let those sentiments guide you.
· Fly an American flag of any size on 9/11. Note:  Flag should be
flown @ half-mast.  If not able to (due to flag design), a black
ribbon or streamer should be attached at the top of the flag (same
size as a stripe).

Many Americans fly the flag year-round. But if you don't, at least
make it your priority to do so on Tuesday 9/11.

Thank you for your participation.  God Bless America .

..and GO GATORS !!

Get off it motherfu--er. I dont need some SOB like you telling me when and
how to feel patriotic. Instead of waving a flag why dont you try to figure
out how to stop the shit thats gonna come down when the next president comes
into office?  The only thing good about Bush is the SOB's are scared of him.
They arent gonna be scared of Hillary Clinton who cant even handle her own
husband. Or any of the other limp dicks running for that matter

The most respectful and lawful way to display the flag of the former United
States om 9-11 is upside down indicating distress. This method has been used
by military and naval forces for centuries. Those not flying the colors
upside down will be considered traitors supporting those who are now in
control of the jewnited states and their jew world order.

Be advised. We ARE watching.

If it's any help to you Zorro, my flag is out every single day, has
been for...15 years or more now.  Quiet little street, typical
American Ranch, nice big yard, great neighborhood.  Of course, all of
the Americans driving the cars going by in the 25mph school kid filled
street would never notice the flag since most morons in this country
can't drive ANY friggin where less than 60 miles an hour while jawing
about absolutely NOTHING on the celly.  I live for the day one of 'em
takes out their own kid or three.  I'll be out front, standing under
The Flag, chuckling.

Flying the US flag is fine, but it's subject to all sorts of interpretation
because some, as you say, fly their flags all the time.  After 9/11 I was
hoping to see people flying something a bit more specific and direct.

The Gadsden flag comes to mind, which is what we will be flying on September
11.

Plus, any flag made famous by a bunch of drunken Marines marching off to war
is automatically cool.  Semper Fi.

What kills me is so many Americans Flew old Glory for 911 and for a short
period there after. The Flag was seen on cars trucks and  houses. Now you
only fly them on holidays or National remembrances. I can honestly say I've
had the American Flag on my house since 1991 (not the same one of course).

Ask yourselves this: Why do you Fly our Nations Colors only a few days out
of the year?  (Its a rhetorical question so no need to reply)

If you've ever been through Boy Scouts you know
what a pain-in-the-ass it is to fly it... special folding,
ceremonies, etc (I'll bet *you* don't take your flag
down at night, right?).  Better to have no flag than to
have a disrespected or dirty flag (see all the filthy flag
stickers on cars?).  The Flag should not be displayed
after being worn or defaced unless you have no better,
and should not be thrown in the trash when retired
(you have to burn them!).

Make it one of those white flags with the blue jew star.
Fly Old Glory upside down or don't fly it at all. There ARE people watching

&gt; If you've ever been through Boy Scouts you know
&gt; what a pain-in-the-ass it is to fly it... special folding,
&gt; ceremonies, etc (I'll bet *you* don't take your flag
&gt; down at night, right?).  Better to have no flag than to
&gt; have a disrespected or dirty flag (see all the filthy flag
&gt; stickers on cars?).  The Flag should not be displayed
&gt; after being worn or defaced unless you have no better,
&gt; and should not be thrown in the trash when retired
&gt; (you have to burn them!).

I was in the boy scott as well as the Army and yes I know all about the
Folding of the flag .   And no I don't lower my flag,  at night, I have it
Lite up from sun down to sun up as it should be when flying colors at night.
So please dont presume to know me, because you don't. If you bothered to
read all of my posting , you will see  &quot;I've had the American Flag on my
house since 1991 (not the same one of  course)&quot;.  Meaning I replace them as
they become unfit for display. The local VFW in my community disposes of
torn or tattered / defaced American Flags.

In 1990 a guy burned a flag in downtown Portland and I told him that was
pussy stuff. Anybody could do that.  Then I took him from it and
extinguished it with my hands, which made the evening news.   Wasn't happy
about that, really, but as my friend and I were leaving some skinhead type
kicked me in the back and a few of his buddies surrounded me while all these
so-called pacifists cheered them on.
He had a safety pin through his cheek and threatened to &quot;tear my heart out.&quot;
Whenever I tried to walk away he'd kick me in the back, so finally I turned
around and told him &quot;Okay, do it.&quot;

Now he's blind in at least one eye. That's my first flag-burning story.

In 2003 I saw a young couple about to torch one on the Burnside Bridge and I
said &quot;I'm not going to stop you, but I'm going to ask you why.&quot;   He went on
about how we Americans had been committing genocide since 1492...    I asked
him if he realized that Columbus was a Spaniard, not an American, and he
looked as if that had not yet occurred to him.   That's my second
flag-burner story.

I was raised by my grandfather, who was shot down and tortured by the
Gestapo in World War II.   They thought he was going to die because he'd
been shot in the head, so they left him at KZ Mauthausen.  If -HE- or
somebody like him had ever been so distressed and disenfranchised that
burning an American flag is the only way he could get his point across, that
would be one thing.  But when some pampered little suburban shitstain who
has everything he needs except a life feels like he has to torch the flag to
express his anger at whatever is he doesn't know anything about, it doesn't
really bother me anymore. A flag is just a thing. If you burn it to get
attention for yourself, so what?  Nobody but your equally-ignorant buddies
will ever respect you for it and it's counterproductive to whatever message
you have, because if you do it the people who actually Get Things Done just
think you're an idiot and stop listening to you.

So let 'em burn their flags.  They'll be mowing your yard or begging for
cash in a few years when daddy stops giving them money anyway.

Well, we certainly have done our little bit for genocide, but my
understanding is that once anthropologists started looking for
genocide... they found an awful lot of it.

I dunno about you, but there is a scene in &quot;Little Big Man&quot; in
which the &quot;Battle&quot; of the Washita is played out, and it is a pretty
emotional moment, I don't care who you are.

It did happen. It was just not widely reported. Lotta WWII guys
had lots of problems, but most had been thru the Depression,
so the Army didn't look so bad. Couple of 'em wrote
books. Unless you'd known people who'd done one
or the other, it would be hard to explain...

A friend of mine's Dad was in the Bataan death march. He was...
affected by it. Drop the football? Beatin'. Strike out?
Beatin'.

The friend was a competitive guy after that, lemme tell you. I'm
amazed his Dad could talk, after reading about it.

Its pissed off Americans. Presidents come and go.
I guess they didnt pay attention to what happened to the Japanese?   We
never even got mad at the Germans until we found out what they did to the
Jewish People. Put em down all you'd like but I'd rather have  them as an

Ya know that day may be comming - A division of my  company (SunPower)
makes solar panels you could install on the roof of your house to
create enough electricity to power an electric car ( like a Tesla for
example) and whala ! Plug in at night for a recharge.  Prices are
still high for the cars,batteries, and panels - but the capability is
not science fiction - you could have one now.. So if instead of a 0-60
in 4 second sports car , you had cheap grocery runners in high volume
production - prices would drop significantly...
Then ask the Oil people - soooo what did you do with the
gazillion dollars you were given from mother nature ??  Factories ?
Infastructure, a creative society ??? Hmmmm sad story there.. Ed S.

&gt;the word out all across the US.

&gt;If you forward this via email to least 11 people and each of those
&gt;people do the same --you do the math.

&gt;THE PROGRAM:
&gt;On Tuesday, September 11th, 2007, an American flag should be displayed
&gt;outside every home, apartment, office, and store in the United States.
&gt;Every individual should make it their duty to display an American flag
&gt;on this anniversary of our country's worst tragedy.
&gt;We do this to honor:
&gt;· Those who lost their lives on 9/11 -- and their families, friends
&gt;and loved ones
&gt;   who continue to endure the pain of their loss.
&gt;·  Our Armed Forces who at this very moment are fighting at home and
&gt;abroad to
&gt;   preserve our cherished freedoms.

&gt;In the days, weeks and months following 9/11 the country was awash in
&gt;American flags as citizens mourned the incredible losses and stood
&gt;shoulder-to-shoulder against terrorism.  Patriotism pulled us through
&gt;some tough times -- it shouldn't take another attack to galvanize us
&gt;in solidarity. The American flag is the fabric of our country;
&gt;together we can prevail over terrorism both foreign and domestic

&gt;Action Plan:
&gt;· Forward this via email to everyone you know (at least 11 people).
&gt;  Do not be the one to break this chain - take a moment to think back
&gt;to how you
&gt;  felt on 9/11 and let those sentiments guide you.
&gt;· Fly an American flag of any size on 9/11. Note:  Flag should be
&gt;flown @ half-mast.  If not able to (due to flag design), a black
&gt;ribbon or streamer should be attached at the top of the flag (same
&gt;size as a stripe).

&gt;  Many Americans fly the flag year-round. But if you don't, at least
&gt;make it your priority to do so on Tuesday 9/11.

&gt;Thank you for your participation.  God Bless America .

&gt;..and GO GATORS !!

No.  Somebody with a pin through his face attacked a friend of mine and I
because he was trying to show off to his skinhead buddies, and he's blind
for it.  It's not something I'm proud of, but he threatened me.  (I'm happy

&gt; Well, we certainly have done our little bit for genocide, but my
&gt; understanding is that once anthropologists started looking for genocide...
&gt; they found an awful lot of it.

I've always doubted this a little, because I've studied quite a bit of 19th
century history, and during the civil war, for example, the idea of
immunology, etc were still primitive.   For example, tens or hundreds of
thousands of soldiers didn't drink warm water because they thought it was
bad for them.  (So they died of sunstroke.)   If they water in their
canteens became warm, often times they poured it out so they wouldn't have
ot carry it.    Those guys spread germs amongst themselves like Reno hookers
with very little idea how it was happening, so it would have been difficult
to develop sophisticated concepts of germ warfare.

Here in Portland there is Sauvie Island, which is where the Wapato indians
live until a sailor from the Hudson's Bay Trading Company jumped ship and
went to live with them.  He was carrying smallpox and something like 99% of
them died faster than they could bury the bodies, and it wasn't deliberate.
The sailor had no idea.  It could easily, however, be lumped into
&quot;genocide.&quot;

&gt;&gt; If -HE- or  somebody like him had ever been so distressed and
&gt;&gt; disenfranchised that burning an American flag is the only way he could
&gt;&gt; get his point across, that would be one thing.

&gt; It did happen. It was just not widely reported.
">

People burned flags (and black people) in New York during the civil war as
well.  If I saw some creaky old veteran burning a flag I would be concerned,
and I would ask him why.  Having put his ass on the line for it, it must
mean something.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A friend of mine's Dad was in the Bataan death march. He was... affected
&gt; by it. Drop the football? Beatin'. Strike out?
&gt; Beatin'.

That's horrible but of course not surprising.  The father probably hated
every bit of himself for it but it probably wasn't something he could
usually control.  The worst part is that if he was like most former POWs, he
tried to hide or bury his experiences during that time and so his family
barely understood.  I think the violence and anger that ensues is spillover
when somebody's desperately trying to cope with an issue that they can't
express to their family, and unfortunately the family suffers whenever the
experience controls him. Ironically, talking through it years later is what
gets those people over it.

I think the average suburban brat who goes out and burns a flag to express
his rage at...whatever...has no idea what it means to people who saw their
friends buried under them.  I own the flag that my grandmother's first
husband was buried under in 1945. That kid was about 22 years old when he
burned up over Germany.

What we have in abundance is wind.  Every morning I see them bringing the
turbines out toward southern Washington/northern Oregon.  A single windmill
blade requires a Long Load pilot car an extended trailer. It's awesome.

I was flying a Piper Arrow back from Idaho in late June one night and up
ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering...  no, wait...   Anyway, off the
left wing there was no light at all clear to the horizon...all farmland or
open prairie, but suddenly I saw this red pulsing glow.  As I got closer I
realized it was the giant wind farm and the pulse was all the red lights on
the windmills.  What was so fascinating is that it covered probably a few
square miles, but all of the lights were slowly pulsing in unison as if they
were all on the same circuit.  Weird.

LOL!  That does seem a bit nonsensical.

Probably what happens is that the panels charge batteries during the day.
The batteries either transfer the charge to whatever you plug them into
(less efficient than..) or you plug those batteries directly into the
appliance or vehicle.

I've seen solar-powered vehicles at places like Burning Man.  They're
spectacular, but the only do about 5-10mph:

I was in the Boy Scouts as well as the Army and I know the how to lower The

illuminated from Dusk to dawn as they should be when flying them at night.

also replaced when need be. I know how to fly the American Colors..And I fly

&gt; · Fly an American flag of any size on 9/11. Note:  Flag should be
&gt; flown @ half-mast.  If not able to (due to flag design), a black
&gt; ribbon or streamer should be attached at the top of the flag (same
&gt; size as a stripe).
