GlacierRedenomination: What does it mean?

‘It’s 9 o’ clock; do you know where your children are?’ This used to be Frank Olise’s by-line every Sunday while presenting the Newsline. As it then turned out, it wasn’t just a by-line; it became the week opener coming just at the closing of the weekend, Sunday night.

As a nation, if we are to rate Newsline, it will certainly emerge as one of the most popular TV programmes, at least in the 1990s. Nigerians who had access to TV hardly missed Newsline. Frank Olise was certainly conscious of that popularity and could as well be prompting parents to send their children to bed before the programme. The popularity of the programme had nothing to do with the by-line but more with the content.

The programme presents real life situations - the tragedies, difficulties of survival facing ordinary Nigerians and those issues that never get reported by conventional media reports or would at the minimum, require sponsorship. They would have been lost if they are to wait for sponsorship because the people affected don’t have the means.

In so many respects, the programme was also very educative. This is best illustrated by a particular report of a child in Onitsha who was asked to give the answer to 2 + 2 and he responded “I no know”. But when asked N2 + N2 he sharply replied “dat one na N4”. This was around 1996/7.

Long after Frank Olise stops anchoring the programme, every time I travelled to Ghana, I remember this particular episode and wonder how much damage the exchange rate in Ghana (of above 8,000 cedi to $1.00) had done to the value system of that country, especially the development of the child. It was quite perplexing how arithmetic was taught in such a society and whether it commences with the basic introductions of tens and units. This was a big question given a price system where the cheapest item, may be sweet, costs around 200 cedi and almost every price unit is upward of 1,000 cedi. Typically therefore every counting starts from 1,000 and almost everyone with equivalent of about $125 or N15,000 is a millionaire. Given such a situation what sense does a cedi make to the Ghanaian child?

Perhaps it does make some sense. One thing is however certain; arithmetic will be a difficult subject to teach a primary pupil, no matter how good the instructor is. It has never been an easy subject anyway. In any event it was only convenient for a Nigerian to raise this issue with respect to the Ghanaian exchange rate. The Nigerian case might not be any better. If anyone thought it was, the introduction of the N1 coin underscores the futility of such a claim. This was best represented by the views of a woman who responded to an NTA reporter with the suggestion that the Central Bank should also produce what Nigerians can buy with the coin, clearly making the point that it doesn’t have any economic value.

The new CBN policy of Naira redenomination certainly goes beyond this particular point. That the Ghanaians have gone similar route by dropping 3 0s or what Prof. Soludo would describe as moving three decimal points to the left, may not be the model to copy. Looking at numeric values and engaging the discourse and the policy would be very subjective and in scientific terms normative.

In terms of the politics, one would argue that the CBN and in particular Prof. Charles Soludo owes the nation an apology. This is because the whole policy amount to an acknowledgement that the introduction of N1,000 note was a waste. In other words, the CBN misdirected the nation into expending colossal amount in the production of the N1,000 note and within less than two years of introduction, it has to be phased out.

This might not be an issue if the policy were to be announced by a different management other than the one that sold it to the nation. Again, it wouldn’t have been an issue if Prof. Soludo had, while announcing the new policy, gone a step further to make open national confession and possibly expressed regret. Watching Prof. Soludo on Monday, August 13 announcing the so-called redenomination policy didn’t suggest any guilt. If anything, it suggested a triumphant Soludo, a revolutionary and visionary economist. This would irk the public and is enough to agitate Nigerians to resent the new policy.

As for the economics, this is where the politics have to be broadened to cover both historical as well as structural issues relating to the management of the nation’s economic policy management. Historical issues bordering on developments that resulted in the significant devaluation of the Naira, which started with the introduction of the Second Tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM) definitely bring to the fore some of the sad memories of how national consensus, superior logic and even responsible governance were to be thrown overboard.

To a considerable extent, the issues addressed by the 1985 IMF Debate have stuck with the nation for all these years. Macroeconomic stability has eluded us and theories provided by government either through the Ministry of Finance or CBN have continued to fail the nation. As a nation, one can argue that, we have lived and are still living painfully with policy frameworks that derived legitimacy only from endorsement of World Bank and IMF and not based on any empirical or scientific logic. These were the policies that were rejected in 1985 in the first place.

It is one thing to state that these policies have failed and it is a different thing to cite the facts of history. The two don’t necessarily have to have a relationship. What is however very disturbing was that the debate so far appears to be static. Contextual issues of how the policy is supposed to be integral part of wider socio-economic programme, if it is at all, are hardly a focus. Most of the analyses never go beyond the decimal note and the impact it will make. In many of the cases, the analysis never transcends speculations.

Even those who have the mandate of constituencies failed to broadened the extrapolation with potential impact on the living conditions of members. Rather than engage in social enquiry, some renowned economists have reduced the debate to that of choice of nomenclature. The intellectual vibrancy of the Nigerian society appears to be buried through years of structural adjustment with its attendant experiential theories.

Elementary economic theory argues that exchange rate compares the relative prices of different countries’ products. To that extent therefore, it is a derivative of the production level of the country. In other words, as economists would say, things being equal, the price of products of nations, relative to a particular currency should be the same. The constancy factor is to be determined by consumer behaviour and preferences which might alter the laws of demand i. e. the higher the price the lower the demand.

A major argument that was advanced by the IMF and World Bank in the 1980s for the devaluation of the currencies of developing nations, including Nigeria was that higher exchange rate conferred higher nominal value and distorts principles of relativities and therefore undermined principles of comparative advantage. More than 20 years after the colossal devaluation of developing nations’ currencies, either with reference to relativity or comparative advantage, the only thing that was gained in most of the nations’ that adopted devaluation was higher exchange rate, lower industrial production, lower incomes, etc.

In other words, devaluation was a component of a policy package that accelerated the attainment of national economic misery. In 1985, the nation was told by people like Kalu Idika Kalu and Olu Falae that ‘there is no alternative’. Prof. Sam Aluku made the scholarly and popular submission that even death has alternative. The ‘redenomination’ policy of the CBN suggests a tacit recognition of the failure of the IMF/World Bank reform programme. The challenge is to ensure that beyond just moving two decimal points to the left, what are the policy components that would ensure that the exchange rate truly reflect measures of relativity between our national currency such that, things being equal, a loaf of bread will cost the same price in Nigeria as in Ghana or a Peugeot 406 saloon will cost almost the same in Nigeria, Ghana and France.

Static analysis will only look at current income levels and will add no value to the debate. Speculative analysis will address largely political conveniences and may give some insight into potential consequences but may miss the integral factors. Depending on one’s political standpoint, it will be very easy to take side in the debate.

It is possible that the policy may be what is desirable. Though, one thing that will be very certain in the Nigerian context was that whether under fixed exchange rate administration during the pre-1985 period or the post-1985 deregulated regime, the structure of the Nigerian economy has remained mono-cultural and largely import dependent.

Theories of diversification of the economy and local sourcing as propounded by the proponents of devaluation have at best been mysterious. Direct links between Prof. Soludo’s redenomination policy and these issues is hardly discernable. Perhaps it is somewhere buried in the thesis of distributing allocation from the federation account in dollars. Well, it can only be assumed.

I am opposed to outright condemnation of the policy as much as I have difficulty providing any justification beyond the arithmetic and the historical factors. I am convinced that change is desirable. Given the fact that the banking sector reform introduced by the CBN in 2005 wasn’t popular, the CBN will be basking in the euphoria of its successes and to that extent may be less accommodating with regards to the current public outcry. At another level, it is also worrisome that the policy might suffer the fate of the report of the National Reform Conference on accounts of undoing the Obasanjo reform programme.

There is certainly need for some moderation in our appreciation of the policy. It would appear that retaining the current deregulatory policy is hardly an option. There is the need to take a holistic approach. For instance, what is the policy corollary with respect to agriculture, industrial development, etc. These are the issues that the intervention of the Federal Executive Council should translate. If, on the contrary, the intervention results in reversing the CBN, it might as well be just postponing the evil day. I may be wrong, but it is beyond simple speculation, it is about properly planning our national economic development.
