Hello, everyone.  Looks like I have found an exclusive club here of
special people.  I thought I might join and share by experince, as it
goes along.  The more we know of others experince the better it is for
us when wrestling with this disease, I figure.

I'm 60 years old, in moderate weight range, pretty healthy, the normal
high BP middle aged male, married for 38 years, retired and cruising
along enjoying life.  I have had a few episodes with prostate
infections 8 to 10 years ago.  My PSA level has floated around from
3.8 to 4.2 for probably 10 years now.  I have monitored it, along with
my other blood tests each six months.

In April, my family doctor tested again and it came back 7.6.  He
immedialtely referred me on to a Urologist/Surgeon who specializes in
this disease and has a high surgical experience rate.  Young guy, but
they all are nowdays...lol.  He puts me onto a 3 week high dose Cipro
(?) antibiotic and anti-inflammatory course, followed by 3 weeks of
rest to allow the drugs to leave my system, then another PSA test.
This recheck came back 6.7.  During the initial exam with the DRE he
commented that my Prostate was grossly enlarged and this 'might' be
the cause of the elevated PSA, hence the antibiotics try first.
Nothing was felt digitally during the DRE.

With the recheck of 6.7, he did a biopsy in July.  He got 16 samples,
(the last 6 were painful, Novacaine or not, let me tell you).  The
ultrasound mapping revealed a 76 cc. Prostate.  Pathology reported 3
cancerous top to bottom, center of left lobe, Gleason 3/3:6.  He setup
an appointment for Reporting and Consultation 3 weeks later, July
30th.

During this consult, he reviewed the results of the biopsy, including
how it was interperted ( a team of 4 Pathologists, 2 from the same
office, 2 from another group) individually looked and scaled it GS
3/3:6. He said it probably had been developing for a year or 2, so it
was caught early.   He said that it indicated that it was still
enclosed, and the 5 years cancer free formula was 80 to 100% chance
for this type situation.  He gave a through review and instruction of
the various options of treatment, really detailing the good and the
bad of each.  I had spent countless hours on the computer reading and
gathering others experiences  and information, so I was able to follow
along well, plus he had given me plenty of booklets and such at the
biopsy, in case.  At the end of it all, he asked me to consider it
all, not to rush into a decision and to let him know how I wanted to
proceed.  I took a week and made a decision for conventional Radical
Prostatectomy. This will include seminal vessels and abdominal lymph
node removal.  He wanted me to wait 3 months to do it, for biopsy
healing and such, but I managed to get him down to 7 weeks.  I have
plans for life this winter, and didn't want to wait that long.  It'd
been fine with me to have done it the next day, as far as I was
concerned.  I am scheduled for the surgery Sept. 24th.  In the
meantime, I am learning patience, on a diet to lose a few pounds, have
begun a more rigorious exercise program, with weights and abs workouts
added.  He said these things would speed recovery and even make the
surgery easier for both of us.  Also, while he has me there, he will
repair a moderate hernia that is just 1 1/2 inch from the proposed
incision line.  So, I get a 2fer....lol

I have read lots of peoples stories in the weeks since I first started
with this, and must say that I am surprised by my reaction, as opposed
to some peoples strong reaction to their disease.  I may be denying a
lot, but I am approaching this as a serious health situation, but one
that can be fixed reasonably easy, as long as it remains inside the
Prostate and it is all removed with the surgery.  I won't know with
any certainity until it is over and the post-surgery pathology is done
on what is removed.  If it hasn't remained encapsulated, then that
opens a whole new arena for me that I will have to begin dealing with.

My wife is supportive, and is taking it all good so far.   She tries
not to worry, but I overhear her at times talking to family and
friends, and detect some worry and stress, but she seems to be
adjusting to the new world we live in ok.  She says her worst time
will be waiting during the surgery, and she will relax more when it is
complete and I am on the way to recovery.  We have discussed the life
style changes that may be in the future for us as a couple, and we
will face them with whatever we need, as we come to them.  We have a
healthy active sex life now and hope/expect to have the same
afterwards.  If it must be in some altered form, then so be it.

I hope this is of interest to someone, I know my reading others
experiences has helped me a great deal in adjusting to this new
reality for me.  I will add to the story as it unfolds.

April 07: PSA 7.6
April 07: Urologist first visit
June 07: PSA retest 6.7
July 07: Biopsy 16 cores/3 cancer GS 3/3:6
July 07: Consult- Tc1 (?), schedule surgery
Sept. 07: CRP scheduled

Harold,

As several have said here, welcome to the club no one wants to be a
member. Your story is well written and very relatable. I am 60 yrs old
at the moment although I'm 3-1/2 years into this crazy battle. It
sounds like you're doing all the right things - there is so much
information to absorb and our first instinct is to take action. Good
luck and keep us informed.

The healthy prostate gland produces prostate-specific antigen. Questions
arise when the amount detected by test exceeds that &quot;normal&quot; amount.

A 76cc prostate will express 5.016 ng/mL of normal or benign PSA. The
formula is gland volume x 0.066 = benign PSA. See Strum &amp; Pogliano _A
Primer on Prostate Cancer_ and/or the Prostate Cancer Research Institute
(PCRI) at
http://www.prostate-cancer.org/education/riskases/Strum_StrategyOfSuc...

In this case it appears that Harold's excess PSA was roughly 1.7 ng/mL.

Unless the &quot;team&quot; had at least one expert prostate pathologist on board,
I would recommend that the Gleason score be validated by such an expert.
It is a &quot;second opinion&quot; and is doubtless covered by insurance and
Medicare. In any case, the cost is only about $350, which is a good
price IMO for the assurance that the Gleason score is reliable as
confirmed by an expert. Why is this important? Because everything that
is done from this point forward is absolutely dependent upon the
accuracy and reliability of that score.

Here is a list of such labs:
Bostwick Laboratories [800] 214-6628
Dianon Laboratories [800] 328-2666 (select 5 for client services)
Jon Epstein (Hopkins) [410] 955-5043 or [410] 955-2162
David Grignon (Michigan) [313] 745-2520
Jon Oppenheimer (Tennessee)  [888] 868-7522
UroCor, Inc. [800] 411-1839

They will require that the local samples (which in civilized
jurisdictions are the property of the *patient*) including the paraffin
block be sent to them. This can be arranged.

Anecdote (take it for what it's worth): My second opinion on my second
biopsy was done by Bostwick. Verrrry interesting result, which the local
hospital lab failed to address.

If the cancer is &quot;encapsulated&quot; I have to wonder why the excision of
lymph nodes. That sounds as if the uro suspects that they are involved.
Did he explain the side effects, such as  possible lymphedema?

Caution: We must not rely upon the experiences of others as any forecast
of our own results. We are all different, especially with regard to our
disease. What helps Harold might harm Steve. And vice versa. Personal

Exactly where I was three years ago ... stuff happens, you deal with it,
more stuff happens, you deal with that, more stuff ... No point getting
too far ahead of ourselves; hypotheticals could drive ya nuts. And, yes,
it's great to find docs who understand that we have lives to live and
schedules to live 'em on even if we *are* old retired farts.

No, but we can learn from other experiences and have 'some' idea of
what is ahead for us as we come to grips with this disease.  I was
really concerned about incontience, until I read of some of the
experiences here.  They helped me to realize just what is involved and
I won't now be as upset if I follow the curve of most I read about. I
will be a little more prepared for more adverse results.

Hello, Harold:

Thanks for the the story.  Everything you wrote sounds pretty much
within the usual bounds.  And you've got a great attitude about it
all.  One of my colleagues here was diagnosed a month or so after my
LRP, and has had his surgery  in turn back in May.  He was in much
better shape physically than I was, and his recovery has been much
more rapid, with fewer side effects.  Makes me wish I had done more
before the surgery.

My wife has kept a stiff upper lip throughout, but I know it's gotten
to her at times, even though she tries not to show it.  It's just a
measure of how much they love us.  And now that I'm through it and the
results are encouraging, she's a lot less stressed.  So, it's
temporary.

Good luck, and please keep us posted on how it all goes.

Harold,

I think Steve's numbers are general averages developed over a period
of many years.

Your own odds may be substantially better than that for several
reasons.  First, you caught it very early.  Second, your Gleason
score of 3+3 (assuming it's accurate - as Steve said, there is some
tendency to undergrade biopsy slides) puts you in a group that
has much lower risk of recurrence.  And third (I'm not sure of this)
it may be that surgical techniques have improved some since
the averages were computed.

Some men with your disease characteristics might even try
watchful waiting.  But since you're only 60 years old and might
well live another 25 years or more, it seems to me very wise
to get this treated.  The odds that the cancer will turn dangerous
sometime during the next 25 years are very high.

One good thing to come out of this is that, with your prostate
removed, you should no longer suffer from prostatitis.  I had
radiation instead of surgery and, although I'm generally quite
happy with my decision, I still do get bouts of prostatitis from
time to time.

Best of luck to you.

Alan

Harold,

A couple of suggestions your may want to consider (if you aren't already):

You didn't mention if your surgery was via standard incision or robotic.  If
it's available, you should go with the robotic since the incisions are minor
and recovery is much faster and virtually pain-free (at least mine was).
And being less intrusive, there is less chance of severe bleeding.  I assume
when you allude to lymph-node removal, your doc is talking about sampling
the nodes for in-surgery biopsy (as opposed to removing the nodes in their
entirety).

As you are getting toned up for this, you should be sure to include an
increasingly rigourous Kegel exercise routine (unless your hernia situation
precludes those exercises).  Post-surgical Kegel exercises can be critical
to your post-surgical incontinence recovery, and getting the muscles toned
up in advance helps even more.

Continence and sexual functions vary widely by individual, both in terms of
extent of recover and length of time involved.  Your approach of
take-it-as-it-comes is very reasonable and wise,  Best of luck.

&gt;&gt; I understand the percentages,  and am concentrating on it being still
&gt;&gt; encapsulated.  If not, I will deal with that when it occurs.  I feel I
&gt;&gt; am being realistic, considering the higher percentage of patients who
&gt;&gt; do not suffer a recurrance.

&gt;Harold,

&gt;I think Steve's numbers are general averages developed over a period
&gt;of many years.

&gt;Your own odds may be substantially better than that for several
&gt;reasons.  First, you caught it very early.  Second, your Gleason
&gt;score of 3+3 (assuming it's accurate - as Steve said, there is some
&gt;tendency to undergrade biopsy slides) puts you in a group that
&gt;has much lower risk of recurrence.  And third (I'm not sure of this)
&gt;it may be that surgical techniques have improved some since
&gt;the averages were computed.

&gt;Some men with your disease characteristics might even try
&gt;watchful waiting.  But since you're only 60 years old and might
&gt;well live another 25 years or more, it seems to me very wise
&gt;to get this treated.  The odds that the cancer will turn dangerous
&gt;sometime during the next 25 years are very high.

&gt;One good thing to come out of this is that, with your prostate
&gt;removed, you should no longer suffer from prostatitis.  I had
&gt;radiation instead of surgery and, although I'm generally quite
&gt;happy with my decision, I still do get bouts of prostatitis from
&gt;time to time.

&gt;Best of luck to you.

Thanks for the info.  I hadn't had the prostatitis in 8 years, but
will admit that I have secretly contemplated maybe not having my sleep
interrupted for the hourly trip to pee that I have done for several
years now.  lol

&gt;Hello, Harold:

&gt;Thanks for the the story.  Everything you wrote sounds pretty much

&gt;better shape physically than I was, and his recovery has been much

&gt;My wife has kept a stiff upper lip throughout, but I know it's gotten

&gt;temporary.

&gt;Good luck, and please keep us posted on how it all goes.

&gt;A couple of suggestions your may want to consider (if you aren't already):

&gt;You didn't mention if your surgery was via standard incision or robotic.  If
&gt;it's available, you should go with the robotic since the incisions are minor
&gt;and recovery is much faster and virtually pain-free (at least mine was).
&gt;And being less intrusive, there is less chance of severe bleeding.  I assume
&gt;when you allude to lymph-node removal, your doc is talking about sampling
&gt;the nodes for in-surgery biopsy (as opposed to removing the nodes in their
&gt;entirety).

&gt;As you are getting toned up for this, you should be sure to include an
&gt;increasingly rigourous Kegel exercise routine (unless your hernia situation
&gt;precludes those exercises).  Post-surgical Kegel exercises can be critical
&gt;to your post-surgical incontinence recovery, and getting the muscles toned
&gt;up in advance helps even more.

&gt;Continence and sexual functions vary widely by individual, both in terms of
&gt;extent of recover and length of time involved.  Your approach of
&gt;take-it-as-it-comes is very reasonable and wise,  Best of luck.

Thanks.  The surgery will be conventional retropubic.  The robotic is
not available locally, it's 300 miles away at Vanderbilt.  It isn't
really realistic for me to go there, for several reasons I won't go
into here.  I have confidence that my surgeon can/will do as good a
job, and am willing to trade off the recovery time to stay local.

I've been in the Kegels for a month now, those things can be difficult
to keep up after a while.  I didn't know I could get so sore from it.
Probably most of it comes from the biospy still being relatively
fresh.

It's not clear to me that robotic has a significant advantage over
open RP, in fact it may be the other way around.  While reduced blood
loss, shorter hospital stay, smaller incision sound appealing, the
point of the procedure is to remove the cancer and so, at least for
me, efficacy in removing the cancer was the basis for my decision.
Robotic RP is still relatively new, so, to my knowledge, there are no
published studies directly comparing the curative efficacies of the
two procedures.  So it is not clear whether the open procedure is
better, equivalent or worse than the robotic procedure in terms of
biochemical freedom from disease.  Keep in mind that the surgical
procedures and the tools and methods used to cut the surgical margin
differ substantially between the two procedures.  A number of papers
have appeared suggesting that positive margin rates may be higher with
the robotic procedure, particulalrly in cases where the tumor is
apically located or when disease is more advanced.

As to factors such as blood loss, pain, recovery time, etc., etc.,
most studies find little difference between the two procedures for men
with normal levels of health and fitness.  The total length of the
robotic incisions more or less equals the length of the incision in
the open procedure...ron

A couple of points from recent articles:

Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy: Do Minimally Invasive
Approaches Offer Significant Advantages?
Joseph A. Smith Jr and S. Duke Herrell
Journal of Clinical Oncology(JCO),Nov. 10, 2005
&quot;Separating hype from reality is sometimes difficult with many medical
procedures and this is particularly applicable to RALP. Patients who
appropriately research treatment options so that they can participate
in their own medical decisions may have difficulty interpreting
marketing efforts by hospitals and physicians. The lack of randomized
trials or even balanced prospective studies limits the ability to
analyze comparative results of RALP versus open surgical approaches.&quot;
------------------------
http://www.medscape.com/viewprogram/6653?src=mp
&quot;While some of the increased popularity of the robotic approach is
justifiably due to the minimally invasive nature of the surgery, there
is clearly also an element of marketing involved. Although robotic
prostatectomy clearly holds promise in the treatment of localized
prostate cancer and likely offers some advantages when compared with
open surgery, the claims frequently made on its behalf -- better
urinary and sexual outcomes, less pain, better cancer control and an
overall superior healthcare experience -- are unsubstantiated.&quot;
--------------------------
http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/507264?src=mp
The positive surgical margin rate continues to be higher with
laparoscopic and robotic prostatectomy compared with the open approach.
[54,69,70] It is unclear how this will translate into disease-free and
overall survival, since the laparoscopic and robotic experience is
still immature. Nonetheless, it is cause for concern.

http://www.drcatalona.com/quest/quest_fall06_10.asp
Question:  I have been hearing a lot of good things about DaVinci
Robotics for removing the prostate.  I know that you do not practice
the procedure, but what would you say about its benefits for
preserving potency and continence?  And which patients should consider
it as a treatment alternative?

Answer:    In my opinion, the robotic prostatectomy (often called the
DaVinci prostatectomy) is not as effective as the traditional open
prostatectomy for simultaneously accomplishing complete removal of
cancer and preserving potency.

One of the reasons is that the robot lacks the &quot;human touch&quot; and it is
not possible to appreciate how the prostate gland feels and how
readily it separates from the nerves and other surrounding tissues.
The robot does not handle the prostate gland as gently as the human
hand, and not infrequently the robot punctures the capsule of the
prostate, leading to positive surgical margins.

Another limitation is that with the robotic prostatectomy, the
prostate is removed by burning it out with electrocautery or a so-
called harmonic scalpel that cuts by heat, and if the heat is too near
the nerves, it irreversibly damages them. Also, if the burning is too
close to the prostate gland, it risks cutting into the prostate,
resulting in positive surgical margins and possibly leaving cancer
behind.

Advocates of robotic surgery say that there is less bleeding and
greater magnification with robotic surgery. However, excellent
magnification and visualization can be provided with open surgery, and
with an experienced surgeon, few patients require blood transfusions
from another person.

With robotic surgery, it is more difficult to suture and apply
hemostatic clips and it is more difficult to perform a lymph node
dissection.

Enthusiasts of the robotic procedure claim it is &quot;less invasive&quot; and
has a quicker recovery time. But actually it is more invasive because
the surgeon has to go through the peritoneal cavity to get to the
prostate (a more invasive approach associated for
greater risk for injury to the bowel, major blood vessels, and the
ureters and a greater risk for later intestinal obstruction from
adhesions).  Usually 6 one-inch incisions are made for robotic
surgery, while for open surgery, one 4 to 5 inch incision is made
that does not enter into the peritoneal cavity. With the smaller
incision now frequently used for open surgery, there is no material
difference in the recovery time and return to normal activity. .  .

The complications with robotic prostatectomy are more serious than
with open prostatectomy and they lead to more postoperative emergency
room visits, more
re-hospitalizations, and more re-operations.

I believe that with the robotic or laparoscopic prostatectomy, the
patient and the surgeon have to make more of a stark choice between
removing all of the cancer or preserving the nerves to maintain
potency.  I believe that there is a greater likelihood
of accomplishing both objects with the increased access provided by
the open approach.

Most importantly, however, the robotic prostatectomy  has no track
record in terms of long-term cancer  control.  If small amounts of
cancer are left behind,  it may not become apparent for years.

Patients sometimes tell me that they know someone who underwent a
robotic prostatectomy a few months ago and seems to be doing fine.
However, the final outcome of the operation may not become apparent
for up to 10 years. Thus, long-term cancer cure rates are needed
before one can truly evaluate the effectiveness of the
operation.

In sum, I do not believe the robotic prostatectomy is as safe a cancer
operation as open radical prostatectomy, and I do not believe that
nerve sparing can be as readily or safely accomplished.  For patients,
the most important outcomes of radical prostatectomy are: Is he cured
of his cancer?  Is he continent?  Can he have erections sufficient for
intercourse?

These questions have  been well documented for open prostatectomy.
The jury is still out with laparoscopic/robotic prostatectomy.

The most important factor is the surgeon and not the technique.

Considering how many times I've been back for consultations before and
after my surgery and the week I spent in the recover ward (dual
surgery), being close mattered a lot to me, too, given the good
reputation of my surgeon and hospital. Our 220-mile, mostly
traffic-free, 3-hours-on-cruise-control is a piece of cake compared to
some major trip a few times a year.

OTOH, what if Walsh or Scardino or Whoever had left me dry? I'll never
know, but my surgeon says I'm one of his first continence failures and
can't explain it besides the fact that I'm not Kegeling like a machine
and am very active physically.

But I still fail to see what good Schwartzeneggerian pelvic floor
muscles can do when the &quot;Kegel!&quot; command isn't issued because the leak

&gt; special people.  I thought I might join and share by experince, as it
&gt; goes along.  The more we know of others experince the better it is for
&gt; us when wrestling with this disease, I figure.

&gt; I'm 60 years old, in moderate weight range, pretty healthy, the normal
&gt; high BP middle aged male, married for 38 years, retired and cruising
&gt; along enjoying life.  I have had a few episodes with prostate
&gt; infections 8 to 10 years ago.  My PSA level has floated around from
&gt; 3.8 to 4.2 for probably 10 years now.  I have monitored it, along with
&gt; my other blood tests each six months.

&gt; In April, my family doctor tested again and it came back 7.6.  He
&gt; immedialtely referred me on to a Urologist/Surgeon who specializes in
&gt; this disease and has a high surgical experience rate.  Young guy, but
&gt; they all are nowdays...lol.  He puts me onto a 3 week high dose Cipro
&gt; (?) antibiotic and anti-inflammatory course, followed by 3 weeks of
&gt; rest to allow the drugs to leave my system, then another PSA test.
&gt; This recheck came back 6.7.  During the initial exam with the DRE he
&gt; commented that my Prostate was grossly enlarged and this 'might' be
&gt; the cause of the elevated PSA, hence the antibiotics try first.
&gt; Nothing was felt digitally during the DRE.

&gt; With the recheck of 6.7, he did a biopsy in July.  He got 16 samples,
&gt; (the last 6 were painful, Novacaine or not, let me tell you).  The
&gt; ultrasound mapping revealed a 76 cc. Prostate.  Pathology reported 3
&gt; cancerous top to bottom, center of left lobe, Gleason 3/3:6.  He setup
&gt; an appointment for Reporting and Consultation 3 weeks later, July
&gt; 30th.

&gt; During this consult, he reviewed the results of the biopsy, including
&gt; how it was interperted ( a team of 4 Pathologists, 2 from the same
&gt; office, 2 from another group) individually looked and scaled it GS
&gt; 3/3:6. He said it probably had been developing for a year or 2, so it
&gt; was caught early.   He said that it indicated that it was still
&gt; enclosed, and the 5 years cancer free formula was 80 to 100% chance
&gt; for this type situation.  He gave a through review and instruction of
&gt; the various options of treatment, really detailing the good and the
&gt; bad of each.  I had spent countless hours on the computer reading and
&gt; gathering others experiences  and information, so I was able to follow
&gt; along well, plus he had given me plenty of booklets and such at the
&gt; biopsy, in case.  At the end of it all, he asked me to consider it
&gt; all, not to rush into a decision and to let him know how I wanted to
&gt; proceed.  I took a week and made a decision for conventional Radical
&gt; Prostatectomy. This will include seminal vessels and abdominal lymph
&gt; node removal.  He wanted me to wait 3 months to do it, for biopsy
&gt; healing and such, but I managed to get him down to 7 weeks.  I have
&gt; plans for life this winter, and didn't want to wait that long.  It'd
&gt; been fine with me to have done it the next day, as far as I was
&gt; concerned.  I am scheduled for the surgery Sept. 24th.  In the
&gt; meantime, I am learning patience, on a diet to lose a few pounds, have
&gt; begun a more rigorious exercise program, with weights and abs workouts
&gt; added.  He said these things would speed recovery and even make the
&gt; surgery easier for both of us.  Also, while he has me there, he will
&gt; repair a moderate hernia that is just 1 1/2 inch from the proposed
&gt; incision line.  So, I get a 2fer....lol

&gt; I have read lots of peoples stories in the weeks since I first started
&gt; with this, and must say that I am surprised by my reaction, as opposed
&gt; to some peoples strong reaction to their disease.  I may be denying a
&gt; lot, but I am approaching this as a serious health situation, but one
&gt; that can be fixed reasonably easy, as long as it remains inside the
&gt; Prostate and it is all removed with the surgery.  I won't know with
&gt; any certainity until it is over and the post-surgery pathology is done
&gt; on what is removed.  If it hasn't remained encapsulated, then that
&gt; opens a whole new arena for me that I will have to begin dealing with.

&gt; My wife is supportive, and is taking it all good so far.   She tries
&gt; not to worry, but I overhear her at times talking to family and
&gt; friends, and detect some worry and stress, but she seems to be
&gt; adjusting to the new world we live in ok.  She says her worst time
&gt; will be waiting during the surgery, and she will relax more when it is
&gt; complete and I am on the way to recovery.  We have discussed the life
&gt; style changes that may be in the future for us as a couple, and we
&gt; will face them with whatever we need, as we come to them.  We have a
&gt; healthy active sex life now and hope/expect to have the same
&gt; afterwards.  If it must be in some altered form, then so be it.

&gt; I hope this is of interest to someone, I know my reading others
&gt; experiences has helped me a great deal in adjusting to this new
&gt; reality for me.  I will add to the story as it unfolds.

Hi Harold,
You and I have VERY similar statistics. Gleason 6 pre-op, 60 years old
-  I'm 12 weeks out from my RRP w/ PSA now undetectable. I also had
some prostatitis in my 40s &amp; 50s &amp; had a 72cc whopper that was
starting to give me all the classic BPH problems. My uro with 2000
prostatectomies in his resume strongly suggested radical rather than
DaVinci, because with our size of a gland he could do a better job
bringing it out through a larger opening rather than the smaller
robotic incision. I'm very glad I went with a radical because he did
see &amp;/or feel cancer at my margin, so he took extra tissue in that
area. My recovery has been very good &amp; I lucked out being dry the day
of catheter removal. My wife was with me every minute for a week after
I came out of the recovery room, so I'm eternally grateful for her
love and help through it all. The great cosmic irony is that this
cures your BPH! You MUST read through the following famous
Post-Prostatectomy-Paraphernalia list that our fellow club member Joe
Price has compiled for the newsgroup - I include it because it, more
than any other single thing, helped me through this ordeal. Of course,
the Scardino &amp; Walsh books too, but this list was invaluable!
Good luck my comrade. We're here for you.

........................................................................... .

Post Prostatectomy Paraphernalia by Joe Price:
I compiled this shopping list of paraphernalia that would be good to
have
on hand when you get back from surgery. I started the list in
September
2001 before my own operation based on responses I got to a request
here for
suggestions.
Thanks to all those who helped put this list together way back then.

Since then I have re-posted periodically it to make it available to
the
newly diagnosed. Occasionally, additional items are suggested and I
try to
remember to add them next time I post this message.

One thing I would like to make clear up front - the list is exhaustive
because I have included almost everything everyone has ever suggested.
This
does NOT mean you should run out and buy everything on this list. Some
of
these items are in the &quot;luxury - nice to have&quot; category and others are
specific remedies some individuals found they needed for complaints
that may
have been specific to them.

Read through the list and at least think about what is here and what
its
purpose is. Get creative in thinking how you might adapt something you
already have around the house to function in the place of some of
these
items.

Certain activities, not strictly hardware items, were recommended
frequently. I've included those activities as well.

I am not a doctor and this is NOT medical advice!  (However, I AM a
geologist so maybe this qualifies as a form of geological advice...)

Hardware:
- A pair of oversized basketball type warm-up pants with snaps or
zipper up
the leg (to allow discreet access to the catheter and bag). Get a pair
that
is large enough to accommodate the large (night) bags and smaller
(walking)
bags - that will be provided by the hospital. A dark colour will be
less
likely to show wetness from any accidental leakage compared with a
light
colour. Fast drying material (&quot;parachute material&quot;) is recommended if
possible. This is not essential.
-  I have found convertible hiking pants (pants whose lower leg can be
zippered off to create a pair of shorts) to work wonderfully well
while
wearing a catheter. This type of pant also has a side zipper on the
lower
leg, which makes leg bag access a breeze. You can open the upper
zipper (the
one that runs around the leg) part-way to switch bags and let out the
hose
to the large drain bag.
- A five-gallon plastic bucket is very useful at night as a receptacle
for
the large night bag. The bucket may become your constant companion
around
the house. Get a square one if you don't already have something else.
- &quot;Invalid&quot; cushion (looks like an inner tube)
- Antibiotic ointment/lubricant (Polysporin, for example) for where
catheter
exits (some had this supplied by their hospital). Some recommend a
water-based lubricant such as KY Jelly but that tends to dry out
quickly.
Get gauze 4X4 pads to apply ointment.
There has been some debate about the best fluid to use. You want
something
slick, long lasting and certain not to damage the tube. It would be
nice if
it were also antibacterial. I used Polysporin and Erythromycin with no
problem. Polyfax ointment is a name to look for if you live outside
North
America.
- Alcohol swabs to clean the catheter at the tip of the penis (single
use
wipes designed for cleaning the skin before an injection).
- A pair of slippers or sandals or loafers.
- Over-the-counter stool softener
- Get a haircut and trim your toenails before surgery
- Several people recommended buying, borrowing or otherwise acquiring
the
use of a reclining chair.
- Place a chair by the bed with the back facing the bed. Use the chair
as a
bedrail to help you get up. Use the seat as a bedside table to hold
some of
the things you want to keep handy. I would STRONGLY suggest you test
this
out BEFORE you go to hospital to be certain it can take your weight as
a
handrail before you rely on it post-surgery!
- A pillow to hug early on to ease pain in laughing etc.
- A pillow to put between your knees while sleeping on your side.
- Grab bars in the area of the commode (don't use towel racks for grab
bars!)
- Use a plastic coat hanger stuck between the mattress and box spring
to
hang the bag from or just place it in the bucket on the floor.
- Nice baggy, soft sweat pants or warm-ups - oversize with drawstring
if the
weather is warm inside the house or out of doors
- A soft bathrobe belt to make a shoulder strap to suspended the big
bag if
you prefer it to the &quot;walking&quot; bag.
-. Silk/nylon/rayon boxer shorts for the period you have the catheter
- A plastic sheet to go under the bed sheets and protect the mattress
once
the catheter comes out. A large plastic garbage bag might work in a
pinch.
- Have enough easy to prepare food on hand for 2-3 weeks
- Book(s) you've been intending to read
- Fresh batteries for your TV remote
- A cordless phone and up-to-date phone list
- Some big baggy mesh shorts (in summer)
- Suspenders may be helpful, in place of a belt
- Two dozen inexpensive white washcloths (in a big bundle)
- Some of the little plastic, stick-on hooks to put in the shower
etc., for
a place to hang the bag or simply the pail, placed outside the tub.
- To help stave off possible urinary tract infection, either Ural
(seems to
be an Australia/New Zealand over-the-counter drug) or a supply of
cranberry
juice. They work in different ways to achieve the same thing.
- A watch or interval timer to remind you not to stay sitting too
long. The
small kitchen timers would work for this and to prompt you to get up
periodically at night if you need to do so.
. An electronic thermometer (about $10) for keeping track of your
temperature for a couple weeks postoperatively.
- A walking stick may prove to be helpful.
- A safety bench (maybe a plastic lawn chair?) for the shower
(sometimes
you're a little light-headed when you first come home and it's nice to
have
something to sit on)
- A raised seat to put over the toilet (as an alternative, or in
addition
to, grab bars)
- A grabber for picking things up if you drop them so you wouldn't
have to
bend down.
- If you have the hardware, fill up a MP3 player with your favourite
tunes &amp;
use headphones to help &quot;drown-out&quot; the hospital noise.
- A &quot;toilet seat lifter&quot;. I would be inclined to bend a coat hanger
into a
hook that I could work under the lip and lift, but there are probably
commercial step-on type mechanical devices akin to garbage can lid
lifters
out there. Just use a stick or bend at the knees, keeping the back
straight.
Heck, just leave the lid up for a few days.
- One person indicated his hospital made him wear a pair of
anti-embolism
stockings the whole time he was there. He bought another pair when he
went
home and suggests considering doing the same.
- Drinking straws - you will want some for the first week.
- Plastic cups - they're lighter than glass
- Extra pillows - for sitting up in bed and as arm rests at night and
for
the couch.
- Velcro Foley straps - the walking bag can slip down your leg and
pull on
the tube.
- A current phone list - one of contact people who must know, one of
friends
to come visit you, walk, and meals, shop for you. Spread the burden.
- A few woman's (not a few women's- get them from one woman) menstrual
pads - don't be shy, the big ones, they're smaller, cheaper than
incontinence pads and can be added to the diaper and
changed more often.
-Travel bag - like a baby changing bag for when you go out or the keep
women's pads in your pocket.
- Viva paper towels - to help when wet - they're soft.
- Toilet wipes - the first few times they're nice, along with baby
wipes for
everything.
- To deal with the rash and itch consider getting tubes of Desitin
and/or
Butt Paste, both containing zinc oxide.
- Diet plan - coffee is bad for bladder, eat more fruit, less meat, no
cheese &amp; bananas while on stool softeners. Diet and supplements are
part of
permanent recovery plan.
- Look into a cancer society group such as &quot;Man to Man&quot; that meets
monthly
and go to a meeting before surgery.

Repeated Advice:
- Learn to roll sideways out of bed (rather than sit on the edge
trying to
stand upright). Practice before going to the hospital.
- Walking is the best way to get your body ready and to recover.
- Wait to see how bad your incontinence is BEFORE purchasing a lot of
pads
etc. but do buy a package of men's guards to bring to the appointment
when
the catheter is removed. Have a look around at what is available

Thanks, Debbie.  She is aware of it and reads sometimes, when I point
things out to her.  I have fixed her a good reading list of sites that
has info for wives and SO's of us guys.  She has learned a lot and it
is easing some of her/my fears.. lol

Hi Harold,

Key for a treatment of any kind is the amount of experience with the
treatment and success rate that your surgeon has had.

I had the Da Vinci robotic laparoscopic surgery and am extremely
pleased with the overall experience.  My current urologist is one of
four in my area very experienced with the procedure and has done many
over the last five years.

My prior urologist preferred other surgery approaches and if I was
still with him, I'd go with what he had the best experience with.

As you know, you are in the driver seat.  Ask all the question you can
to make you feel more comfortable going in.  The treatment you pick
for you will be the right one.  The people here will offer a lot of
good help and support.

I belong to two other prostate cancer support groups as well at
&quot;healingwell.com&quot; and &quot;healthboards.com.&quot;  I find that there are
caring people all over who want to help you from their current and
prior experience.

You might find one or two of the web sites I'll list below to be
helpful as well.

All the best to you, Harold!

That's my situation now.  I am very comfortable with my current

and results amongst my friends and associates.

I forgot to mention in my first post, besides reasons I didn't want to
go into for not going 300 miles away for robotic, is my surgeon, and
other places I have read that does robotic, say that robotic is harder
to complete for a grossly enlarged prostate, mine being 75cc.  That
helped make my decision easier to have the regular surgery.

As it is, I don't second guess myself, and am just impatiently waiting
for the time to get it over with, and see what I end up with
afterwards.  The uncertainity of the results is far outweighing any
worries I have with the surgery itself....if that makes sense.

Thanks for the info and encouragement, I appreciate it.

&gt; Thanks for the info and encouragement, I appreciate it.

You're welcome, Harold and sounds like you're doing all the right
stuff!

Don't beat yourself up for being mortal and having fears, either.
Hearing the &quot;C&quot; word applied to yourself is pretty daunting.

There are so many out here &quot;fighting the good fight&quot; that you are in
good company.    The three docs I visited for second opinions gave me
a lot of hope as well.

None of us came into the world with a guaranteed expiration date, so
we're still running the show individually with our choices as much as
we're able to do so.

Much success!

Idaho Guy

&gt; Hello, everyone.  Looks like I have found an exclusive club here of
&gt; special people.  I thought I might join and share by experince, as it
&gt; goes along.  The more we know of others experince the better it is for
&gt; us when wrestling with this disease, I figure.

&gt; I'm 60 years old, in moderate weight range, pretty healthy, the normal
&gt; high BP middle aged male, married for 38 years, retired and cruising
&gt; along enjoying life.  I have had a few episodes with prostate
&gt; infections 8 to 10 years ago.  My PSA level has floated around from
&gt; 3.8 to 4.2 for probably 10 years now.  I have monitored it, along with
&gt; my other blood tests each six months.

&gt;  In April, my family doctor tested again and it came back 7.6.  He
&gt; immedialtely referred me on to a Urologist/Surgeon who specializes in
&gt; this disease and has a high surgical experience rate.  Young guy, but
&gt; they all are nowdays...lol.  He puts me onto a 3 week high dose Cipro
&gt; (?) antibiotic and anti-inflammatory course, followed by 3 weeks of
&gt; rest to allow the drugs to leave my system, then another PSA test.
&gt; This recheck came back 6.7.  During the initial exam with the DRE he
&gt; commented that my Prostate was grossly enlarged and this 'might' be
&gt; the cause of the elevated PSA, hence the antibiotics try first.
&gt; Nothing was felt digitally during the DRE.

&gt; With the recheck of 6.7, he did a biopsy in July.  He got 16 samples,
&gt; (the last 6 were painful, Novacaine or not, let me tell you).  The
&gt; ultrasound mapping revealed a 76 cc. Prostate.  Pathology reported 3
&gt; cancerous top to bottom, center of left lobe, Gleason 3/3:6.  He setup
&gt; an appointment for Reporting and Consultation 3 weeks later, July
&gt; 30th.

&gt; During this consult, he reviewed the results of the biopsy, including
&gt; how it was interperted ( a team of 4 Pathologists, 2 from the same
&gt; office, 2 from another group) individually looked and scaled it GS
&gt; 3/3:6. He said it probably had been developing for a year or 2, so it
&gt; was caught early.   He said that it indicated that it was still
&gt; enclosed, and the 5 years cancer free formula was 80 to 100% chance
&gt; for this type situation.  He gave a through review and instruction of
&gt; the various options of treatment, really detailing the good and the
&gt; bad of each.  I had spent countless hours on the computer reading and
&gt; gathering others experiences  and information, so I was able to follow
&gt; along well, plus he had given me plenty of booklets and such at the
&gt; biopsy, in case.  At the end of it all, he asked me to consider it
&gt; all, not to rush into a decision and to let him know how I wanted to
&gt; proceed.  I took a week and made a decision for conventional Radical
&gt; Prostatectomy. This will include seminal vessels and abdominal lymph
&gt; node removal.  He wanted me to wait 3 months to do it, for biopsy
&gt; healing and such, but I managed to get him down to 7 weeks.  I have
&gt; plans for life this winter, and didn't want to wait that long.  It'd
&gt; been fine with me to have done it the next day, as far as I was
&gt; concerned.  I am scheduled for the surgery Sept. 24th.  In the
&gt; meantime, I am learning patience, on a diet to lose a few pounds, have
&gt; begun a more rigorious exercise program, with weights and abs workouts
&gt; added.  He said these things would speed recovery and even make the
&gt; surgery easier for both of us.  Also, while he has me there, he will
&gt; repair a moderate hernia that is just 1 1/2 inch from the proposed
&gt; incision line.  So, I get a 2fer....lol

&gt; I have read lots of peoples stories in the weeks since I first started
&gt; with this, and must say that I am surprised by my reaction, as opposed
&gt; to some peoples strong reaction to their disease.  I may be denying a
&gt; lot, but I am approaching this as a serious health situation, but one
&gt; that can be fixed reasonably easy, as long as it remains inside the
&gt; Prostate and it is all removed with the surgery.  I won't know with
&gt; any certainity until it is over and the post-surgery pathology is done
&gt; on what is removed.  If it hasn't remained encapsulated, then that
&gt; opens a whole new arena for me that I will have to begin dealing with.

&gt; My wife is supportive, and is taking it all good so far.   She tries
&gt; not to worry, but I overhear her at times talking to family and
&gt; friends, and detect some worry and stress, but she seems to be
&gt; adjusting to the new world we live in ok.  She says her worst time
&gt; will be waiting during the surgery, and she will relax more when it is
&gt; complete and I am on the way to recovery.  We have discussed the life
&gt; style changes that may be in the future for us as a couple, and we
&gt; will face them with whatever we need, as we come to them.  We have a
&gt; healthy active sex life now and hope/expect to have the same
&gt; afterwards.  If it must be in some altered form, then so be it.

&gt; I hope this is of interest to someone, I know my reading others
&gt; experiences has helped me a great deal in adjusting to this new
&gt; reality for me.  I will add to the story as it unfolds.

&gt; April 07: PSA 7.6
&gt; April 07: Urologist first visit
&gt; June 07: PSA retest 6.7
&gt; July 07: Biopsy 16 cores/3 cancer GS 3/3:6
&gt; July 07: Consult- Tc1 (?), schedule surgery
&gt; Sept. 07: CRP scheduled

I had this operation on my 60th birthday, Dec 2, 02, (birthday present
my doc said)  All turned out much better than I had hoped for.  I still
jog at almost age 65, LOL, I'm a foolish old fart.  Good luck
