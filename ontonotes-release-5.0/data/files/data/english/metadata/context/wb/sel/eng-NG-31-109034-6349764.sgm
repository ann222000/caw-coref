If Atilla had suceeded against Rome, would he have changed the

Only if he'd come 500 or more years earlier.

OTL, the Huns failed in Europe because *everyone* teamed up to fight
them.  The Roman Empire was practically in ruins already, but all the
local barbarians joined in on Rome's side, and the Christian Church
blessed them all.

I'll take this question as:  What if a barbarian mega-migration had come
into Europe, at a time when the Roman Republic still had rivals in the
Mediterranean basin?  Say, during the 1st century BC, at about the time
of Sertorius, Spartacus, Mithridates of Pontus, and the pirate fleets?
Somehow I think not everyone fights against the barbarians in this one.

And it came quite close to happening OTL.

The Cimbri and their allies attacked Italy c100BC, a single genration before
Spartacus et al.

WI they come  ag eneration later (or Spartacus happens a generation earlier)
and cross the Alps while the Servile War is in full swing. Could get quite
lively.

Since the Roman Republic had ceased to exist in fact, if not in name,
around 370 years or so before (with Augustus' "restoration" which was,
of course, its final death knell), and had, even in name, ceased to
exist around 120 years before (Diocletian and the Dominate) Attila was
even a gleam in his daddy's eye this would make him a time traveller.

And would, of course, involve Alien Space Bats.

Especially if Mithridates had made alliance with the barbarians from
north of his holdings in the Crimea, like he dreamed of doing after the
first three times he attacked Rome.

POD:  Mithridates holds off his third invasion for a few years, and
negotiates with nearby barbarians for a much bigger invasion.  Which
means, the Third Mithridatic War starts roughly when the rebellion of
Spartacus does.

I'm not sure this means Rome loses, though.  After Hannibal was disposed
of, nothing OTL defeated the Roman Republic, even when they were having
a civil war.

You probably meant the Roman Empire. By Atilla's time only a lawyer could
see the republican constitutional structure underneath the imperial
political structure.

In OTL, Atilla has alienated most of the other "barbarians". His inability
to establish a stable political structure in the areas he conquered
suggests he would have likewise failed in "taking over" Rome.

What is needed is a POD, probably related to Atilla's time as a noble
hostage in Rome, leading to him establishing a coalition of non-Romans
(what the Romans called "Barbarians") who would "take over" the
Empire. This isn't ASB territory as most of the "Barbarians" really wanted
to become Romanized and have the rights and privileges of Romans, and
during this period there were many steps towards assimilating them into
what had always been a multiethnic and culturally diverse empire. In this
timeline, St. Atilla not only led his Huns to Christianity, but formed a
great coalition that revives the empire and leads to a substantial
expansion into eastern Europe and central Asia.

If Rome is out of the picture, do we see a continuation of the
Hellenistic age? Or do the Parthians overrun Egypt and the Levant in
the next century?
