I have a 1997 Chevy Silveradoo with a 5.7 litre engine. Recently it has
started to miss badly when in idle. I had it scoped of which the
computer stated that at first cylinders 5 and 7 were missing....less
than a minute later 5 and 7 were firing again but cylinder 4 was now
missing...then it was neither 5,7, or 4, but only 3 missing. I have
recently changed all spark plugs and wires less than 60 000km with
orignal OEM parts (AC Delco). Also, it is becoming harder to start with
the first turn of the key. I suspect the fuel pump, but was wondering
if anyone else has had similar symptoms before. Thanks for your input
into the matter.

It's good to hear that you used OE tuneup parts.  I'm going to suggest
two more: AC Delco cap and rotor.  Your engine has a funky distributor
cap that I can only assume was designed using the 'style over
substance' method.  You will notice that the plug wires exit the cap
neatly to the left and right sides, unlike on conventional caps where
each wire is equally spaced around the diameter of the cap.  Cool, huh?
The problem is that to make the cap look like that, most of the cap's
spark plug wire terminals aren't anywhere near where the rotor "fires"
their respective cylinders.  If you inspect the top of the cap you will
see the molded-in routing that dictates which terminal is fed by which
clock position on the distributor.

The real damning evidence here is that cylinder 5's plug wire enters
right where the cylinder 7 terminal is inside the cap.  It's the same
for the cylinder 4 wire and cylinder 3 terminal.  Now you can see why
an ignition crossfire is so likely, and it is also likely that
something like this would be intermittant, setting the misfire codes in
no particular order.  The 4/3 combination is *really* close on the cap,
as is the 7/2.  There are many problem areas where ignition crossfire
is facilitated on this cap, so you could conceivably see more misfire
codes in the future.

Try the cap and rotor for ~$50US and see if  that takes care of it.

Thanks, but there is no Cap....it is individual coil packs for each
cylinder. I'm quite certain now it is the fuel pump.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; into the matter.

&gt;&gt; &gt; It's good to hear that you used OE tuneup parts.  I'm going to suggest
&gt;&gt; &gt; two more: AC Delco cap and rotor.  Your engine has a funky distributor
&gt;&gt; &gt; cap that I can only assume was designed using the 'style over
&gt;&gt; &gt; substance' method.  You will notice that the plug wires exit the cap
&gt;&gt; &gt; neatly to the left and right sides, unlike on conventional caps where
&gt;&gt; &gt; each wire is equally spaced around the diameter of the cap.  Cool, huh?
&gt;&gt; &gt;  The problem is that to make the cap look like that, most of the cap's
&gt;&gt; &gt; spark plug wire terminals aren't anywhere near where the rotor &quot;fires&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; their respective cylinders.  If you inspect the top of the cap you will
&gt;&gt; &gt; see the molded-in routing that dictates which terminal is fed by which
&gt;&gt; &gt; clock position on the distributor.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The real damning evidence here is that cylinder 5's plug wire enters
&gt;&gt; &gt; right where the cylinder 7 terminal is inside the cap.  It's the same
&gt;&gt; &gt; for the cylinder 4 wire and cylinder 3 terminal.  Now you can see why
&gt;&gt; &gt; an ignition crossfire is so likely, and it is also likely that
&gt;&gt; &gt; something like this would be intermittant, setting the misfire codes in
&gt;&gt; &gt; no particular order.  The 4/3 combination is *really* close on the cap,
&gt;&gt; &gt; as is the 7/2.  There are many problem areas where ignition crossfire
&gt;&gt; &gt; is facilitated on this cap, so you could conceivably see more misfire
&gt;&gt; &gt; codes in the future.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Try the cap and rotor for ~$50US and see if  that takes care of it.

&gt;&gt; Thanks, but there is no Cap....it is individual coil packs for each
&gt;&gt; cylinder. I'm quite certain now it is the fuel pump.

&gt; Then it is not a 1997 Silverado with a 5.7.

Very kind of you to reply in this manner, Sdlomi2.  I appreciate your
contribution to this group as well.

I actually meant that the OP wasted my time by posting incorrect
vehicle info, or not enough info to give a "correct" answer.  If he
really had a 1997 Chevy Silverado with 5.7, and I don't care what trim
level, Suburban or truck, short bed, long bed, whatever, then he would
have the Vortec with a distributor -- no coilpacks.  His description of
which pairs of cylinders were misfiring was a classic case of cap
crossfiring based on the design of that tried and untrue cap design.
Of course I had to find a picture of one online to verify which
cylinder pairs were most suspect...  Neil even replied that the OP must
have a distributor if it is a 97 5.7.  He lives up north and knows a
thing or two about Canadian spec vehicles, so I figure his to be a well
considered reply given the OP is somewhere in Canada (apparently).  Now
if the OP had a different engine or some aftermarket ignition system
(not likely) it still should have been mentioned.

Enough soapboxing, I just heard the bell ring....
The decision... TKO!
I'll take it... :)

97 /5.7 L/coil over plug?......not here in the land of plenty. now up there
in the frozen tundra they may have built some bastardized 97 but down here
it wasnt until late 99 when they switched to the 5.3 design......since you
do have coil over plug ign. you should know...*coils fail intermittently*.
yep. all the time.......i see it more in ford than gm but ive replaced many
of single fire coils in the new trucks also. if you truley suspect the fuel
pump a simple guage will tell you if pressure is not adequate when symptoms
appear. if you decide to replace pump make sure you get one made in USA.
those french pumps only work part of the time and surrender under pressure!

Well....first and foremost

the 1997 5.7 has a cap and rotor. Why the heck did I mention coil
packs...I don't know. My response of "don't waste my time yank...was
uncalled for...but my only excuse is that I have been stressed out over
this and have a number of idiots up here in Thundra land telling me the
bloddy thing runs on coil packs....IT DOESN'T ....it runs on cap and
rotor as mention by yourself and AARCUDA in both replies. Your
statement of going to fuck myself over this simple problem...well your
right on 50%...I am fucking myself...but it is not a simple problem. At
least not to this stupid Canadian -  the stupid Canadain being myself
and not the idiots that swore to me it is a coil pack.

I did change the cap and rotor... to no avail. Missing still bad while
in idle. next I will change the plugs once again....but I dont beleive
it is the problem either. I should have it scanned again after I change
the plugs.....I have no idea anymore...engine has 300 000 km....thats
about 200 000 plus miles. I'm hoping that it might be an emmisson
sensor problem.....but at this point ....it is really becoming a boat
anchor.

Once again...my apoligies as I continue to fuck myself over this
problem...you were right about it runnig on a cap and rotor.....but

Stuck CPI injector poppets (nozzles) are a common problem after a hot
soak on the Vortec.  Some people try injector cleaner, but it's
unlikely to work if the poppets are currently stuck closed.  Some have
had success with (regulated) compressed nitrogen in the fuel rail, then
operating the 8 fuel solenoids with a Tech2.  I have not done this but
it sounds like the easiest, best method given that you have the
equipment.

I should also mention that you should check fuel pressure.  Typical
fuel pressure is between 54 and 60 psi on that engine.  Anything less
than low 50's will not open the poppets reliably, and cause a no start
or poor run condition.

Is it possible that you run by me the routine for compressed stuck
injectors? I should also mention that it has been an extremly cold week
here....temperature dropped below -40C which is the same as -40F. Truck
was left outside plugged in (oil/block heater) on overnight. It seemed
that after the first night of this unbearable cold...it started it's
miss in idle. I'm thinking that perhaps this extrem cold weather might
have froze the injectors shut. I dont have nitrogen avaiable...but
compressed air might do the trick.

Sincerly...fucked and stuck on the missing problem.

I use my OTC injector balance tool:

Gonna see if the AE can command injectors on next time a Vortec
comes in...
This is all done with the engine off, if you block the throttle
plate open, you can actually hear when the poppet un-sticks by
the sound.

&gt;&gt; &gt;     Please continue offering your expertise, C-Fish, as many of us
&gt;&gt; &gt;     benefit
&gt;&gt; &gt; from and appreciate your ideas.  s

&gt;&gt; I agree, SD.  Comboverfish is a professional and a highly
&gt;&gt; knowledgeable contributor to this site,
&gt;&gt; as are several others, and I would hate to see them get fed up with
&gt;&gt; this sort of response.

&gt; Thanks, H.  Now I'm blushing...

Please ignore the vomitous expellations of the anti-American
Kommunist Kanadians.

Anti-Americanism is Canada's national sport. You'd have to live up here to
understand the insanity. If you didn't see and hear it first-hand (every
day), you wouldn't (couldn't) believe its pervasiveness, fury, idiocy, and
banality.

Canada is America Lite: Tastes great, but not nearly the same thing.
And don't the Canadians know this.
And don't they resent the disconnect, with a passion!

I'm kind of surprised that you got one of these, but with all of the
various drivability issues you tackle it has no doubt paid for itself
in convenience.

I can't imagine Jay would leave that function out.

Unless your engine runs on air, then by all means, let it run :)

Indeed.  I've had it since the late 80s and it sure has come in
handy.

Did you buy AE yet?

I mainly mentioned that for the benefit of the OP.

Nope.  Tempted, but the lure of a Mastertech (in the works) and a trade
up for a Solus for adequate CAN generic coverage has put AE on the back
burner.  I really don't want to use a laptop at work and I don't want
to plop down additional $$ on a Palm at this point.  The Solus deal
actually works out to less than AE if you figure in my Snapon MDT
credits through Toyota and the fact that I need to unload my POS
MTG2500 anyway.  I've heard that AE's coverage of Toyota is one of it's
weaker points.  I'll take Snappy's marginal but reliable coverage in a
shop-friendly design over spotty coverage on a Palm.  I think Jay is
focusing on stuff the Snapy doesn't do at all like Prius or hybrid in
general, and coverage of many of the non-engine modules.  Like I said
it's just to spotty to rely on now.  So a Mastertech for Toyota only
and a Solus for all others seems to be in the future.

How would you rate Toyota coverage so far?  Any glaring glitches like
freezing up during active tests or ??

I think he would figure it out right quick :)

BTW, check your email... I wrote all I done know about the question you
posed.
