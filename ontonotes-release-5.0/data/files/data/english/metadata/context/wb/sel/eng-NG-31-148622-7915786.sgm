Based upon these numbers, I would say +15 wins in a 5 round tournament
easy.  That being said, I know I can't come close to shooting 5 rounds
at 14 over par.  That would be crazy good shooting.

I'm still in Gatlinburg.  Phone is a typical work issue.  They were
supposed to &quot;take over&quot; paying the bill 5-6 months ago.  It got shut off
2 months ago, I paid and got it back on, they promised to take it over
for real.  Looks like they haven't.  I will now have to pay out of my
pocket and get reimbursed for it.  Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

year the handicaps are solely USGA calculated with NGA factoring.

Based upon these numbers, I would say +15 wins in a 5 round tournament
easy.  That being said, I know I can't come close to shooting 5 rounds
at 14 over par.  That would be crazy good shooting.

I'm still in Gatlinburg.  Phone is a typical work issue.  They were
supposed to &quot;take over&quot; paying the bill 5-6 months ago.  It got shut off
2 months ago, I paid and got it back on, they promised to take it over
for real.  Looks like they haven't.  I will now have to pay out of my
pocket and get reimbursed for it.  Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

YEAR OF THE MAJOR: Someone such as Rod Pampling or Frank Lickliter might
not be a bad pick to win the U.S. Open next year, not because of their
games or the course, but the year on their birth certificate.

Indeed, 1969 is proving to be a pretty good year for U.S. Open
champions.

Angel Cabrera became the third U.S. Open champion in the last four years
who was born in 1969, the others being Michael Campbell and Retief
Goosen. Throw in Shaun Micheel ('03 PGA Championship) and Ernie Els ('02
British Open), and 1969 has produced six of the last 26 major champions.

The TPC could follow suit!

Nagy, tie Kurncz, and lose to Goetzke by one.

Indeed, 1969 is proving to be a pretty good year for U.S. Open
champions.

Angel Cabrera became the third U.S. Open champion in the last four years
who was born in 1969, the others being Michael Campbell and Retief
Goosen. Throw in Shaun Micheel ('03 PGA Championship) and Ernie Els ('02
British Open), and 1969 has produced six of the last 26 major champions.

The TPC could follow suit!

You neglected to mention to the committee how GOD AWFUL you are playing
this year...I do like my chances against you giving only 4 per 18...I am
very confident I will NOT finish dead last this year!!!  You and Coree

You neglected to mention to the committee how GOD AWFUL you are playing
this year...I do like my chances against you giving only 4 per 18...I am
very confident I will NOT finish dead last this year!!!  You and Coree
can battle it out for that honor!!!

We may not know where we are going, but we do know the handicaps.  This
year the handicaps are solely USGA calculated with NGA factoring.

88-14 equals 74.  3-4 more rounds like that and you will run away with
the 2007 TPC.

That is because the USGA has not seen any posted score this year. Only 1
18 hole round so far this year which was an 88 at Glenhurst.

We may not know where we are going, but we do know the handicaps.  This
year the handicaps are solely USGA calculated with NGA factoring.

That is because the USGA has not seen any posted score this year. Only 1
18 hole round so far this year which was an 88 at Glenhurst.

You neglected to mention to the committee how GOD AWFUL you are playing

88-14 equals 74.  3-4 more rounds like that and you will run away with
the 2007 TPC.

You neglected to mention to the committee how GOD AWFUL you are playing
this year.I do like my chances against you giving only 4 per 18.I am
very confident I will NOT finish dead last this year!!!  You and Coree
can battle it out for that honor!!!

That is because the USGA has not seen any posted score this year. Only 1
18 hole round so far this year which was an 88 at Glenhurst.

I think the black tee's get it close to that. I think everyone except

88-14 equals 74.  3-4 more rounds like that and you will run away with

That is because the USGA has not seen any posted score this year. Only 1
18 hole round so far this year which was an 88 at Glenhurst.

Ron has explained a couple courses from that side of the state and
compared them to some courses over here, I will have to ask him for the
conversion factor for Glenhurst again.

I think the black tee's get it close to that. I think everyone except
Coree has played there and knows how easy it is.

88-14 equals 74.  3-4 more rounds like that and you will run away with
the 2007 TPC.
