To David Armstrong (DA), I took a quick look at your blog. I did not
have time to read through the whole thing, but I wanted to offer a few
responses.You start by responding to Dave's comment &quot;None of this
proves or disproves Christianity...&quot; with the statement &quot;If such
stories give no reason whatsoever to reject Christianity then (not to
be insulting), I humbly submit: what good are they at all?&quot;You
erroneously equate lack of &quot;proof&quot; with &quot;no reason whatsoever to reject
Christianity&quot;. That is a gross misinterpretation. Dave is acknowledging
what is manifestly true--that neither side can be PROVEN absolutely.
However, proofs are not what we employ when deciding upon empirical
matters; we marshal *evidence*. I submit to you (not to be insulting)
that the difference is enormous, and that the weight of evidence is not
on the side of Christianity.In response to Dave's story about asking
difficult questions as a child, DA responded &quot;I would ask the child
back: 'why do you presume to question God's purposes for doing
anything, or act as if we would or could or should understand
everything that God does, in the first place?'&quot;What a terrible answer.
You are, in effect, saying that the child must simply accept the story
as given, without testing it against their own experience or their own
notion of justice and compassion. While the latter ought not be the
ultimate yard stick, it should certainly sound an alarm if a religious
teaching proclaims compassion yet appears to lack it in its most basic
teaching. I should think it far better to explain why we should accept
that god's actions appear less charitable than the child's own would
have been, and why the child should continue to seriously question
actions that appear unkind or downright devious.DA: &quot;...many atheists
collapse Christianity into know-nothing fundamentalism, so that it can
be dismissed as 'anti-intellectual' and 'anti-science'...&quot;I don't know
who the &quot;many&quot; are that you speak of. At exchristian.net there are
hundreds of Christian visitors who zealously place themselves into this
category by refusing to examine any of their beliefs and by attempting
to discredit science in the large with childishly simplistic and
fallacious arguments. We, as a rule, do not use such visitors as an
excuse to dismiss anything (which is what you are apparently
suggesting). However, they do get dismissed because they contribute
nothing.DA: &quot;...what makes him [Dave] think that he knows better than
scholars who have studied these things for years? This is a common
motif in atheist deconversions. They know better than everyone
else.&quot;Tell me, which scholar should we all listen to? You know as well
as I that 1) what some scholars have to say is not worthy of the
name &quot;scholarship&quot;, and 2) there are legitimate scholars on both sides
of practically any issue. In the end, each of us must decide which line
of reasoning is most coherent and has the greater force of evidence
(thanks, in part, to the efforts of legitimate scholars). Having
studied the arguments of a great many apologists who purport to
dismantle the &quot;so-called contradictions&quot;, I can say with little
hesitation that I find their arguments to be artificial and filled with
special pleading and often circular reasoning. (See below for an
example.) Do I know better than everyone else? No, I don't believe so,
and I don't claim to. But I have a well-thought-out position--one that
is coherent, and has benefited from exposure to nimble minds on both
sides (Plantinga, who you mention, is among them).Bottom line: don't
dismiss all atheists as simply thinking they are smarter than anybody
else. Instead, I encourage you to address their arguments with the same
dedication that they put into forming them.Regarding how Judas met his
demise, DA said &quot;... And so, did Judas hang himself...or did he 'fall
headlong'? Both are obviously true.&quot;Obviously?! Why is that obvious?
Certainly not by a plain reading of the text. Do you think it improper
for someone to point to the two different accounts and suggest that
they contradict?DA: &quot;He hung himself. When did he fall headlong? Did
the rope break? Or did his 'entrails gush out' when others came along
to cut him down from the tree (assuming he actually hung himself from a
tree limb)...and he split open when he hit the ground? There is a lot
of data the Bible doesn't tell us.&quot;Right, lots of details will be
missing from any story. However, this does not give you license to ADD
whatever detail you wish. In this case you are assuming that the
missing details will harmonize the two accounts. Why do you assume
that? It is also possible that the missing details would make it even
more difficult to harmonize the accounts. Missing details are MISSING.
We do not know what they are. If you claim that there is no
contradiction because facts can be inserted to harmonize them, then you
are begging the question--i.e. you claim there is no contradiction
because fact X can be inserted to harmonize the accounts. But your
reason for assuming X is that it harmonizes the accounts. That is
circular.That's all I have time for at the moment.

A minor correction to my post above, to DA. The last sentence should
read &quot;But if your reason for assuming X is that it harmonizes the
accounts, that is circular.&quot; The point being that there may be other
legitimate reasons for adding some missing detail--I don't discount
that. But I don't see any indication of such an argument in what you've
written.

Hi Jim,Thanks for your thoughtful reply.You start by responding to
Dave's comment &quot;None of this proves or disproves Christianity...&quot; with
the statement &quot;If such stories give no reason whatsoever to reject
Christianity then (not to be insulting), I humbly submit: what good are
they at all?&quot;You erroneously equate lack of &quot;proof&quot; with &quot;no reason
whatsoever to reject Christianity&quot;. That is a gross misinterpretation.
Dave is acknowledging what is manifestly true--that neither side can be
PROVEN absolutely. However, proofs are not what we employ when deciding
upon empirical matters; we marshal *evidence*. I submit to you (not to
be insulting) that the difference is enormous, and that the weight of
evidence is not on the side of Christianity.That's a good point, and it
did cross my mind. However, in light of Dave's later comments, I think
I was justified in reading it the way I did, and not in the more
technical epistemological sense you suggested. E.g., Dave claims in the
combox:&quot;My mind was opened to reality, and is continuing to be opened
to reality, as the myths and gods of my youth are abandoned to be
replaced by reason.&quot;Also: he describes Christianity as &quot;primitive
imaginings&quot; and a &quot;phony cult&quot; that &quot;enslave[s] the mind.&quot; It is
supposedly anti-science and (most ridiculous of all) allegedly &quot;caused
the Dark Ages.&quot; To me this implies that somewhere along the line he
assumes Christianity has been rationally disproven, or at least so
discredited that he has justification to speak in such insulting and
derogatory terms.And that gets back to my point: either he thinks his
deconversion story offers some of the reasons why he thinks
Christianity is false or it doesn't. If it does, where are they? I saw
none as I examined it. If it doesn't (as I interpreted), then what good
is it? Frankly, who cares about horror stories of the ignorant,
anti-intellectual fundamentalists he mostly associated with? It may
tickle the fancy of former Christians who love to hear these things,
but it doesn't advance the discussion at all. It is merely anecdotes
about fools.And I would add that if he couldn't extricate himself from
such know-nothingism for 30 years, what does that say about his
intellectual discernment? Does he mean to imply that he couldn't find a
single Christian congregation anywhere for 30 years, that respected the
mind and science and philosophy, and had a thought-out view of culture,
politics, the arts, etc.? I find that astounding. Catholicism (my
group) certainly offers all that. And many Protestant groups and
congregations do. I've been in them myself (as a former Protestant
evangelical). But it doesn't reflect well on his own judgment as a
Christian.In response to Dave's story about asking difficult questions
as a child, DA responded &quot;I would ask the child back: 'why do you
presume to question God's purposes for doing anything, or act as if we
would or could or should understand everything that God does, in the
first place?'&quot;What a terrible answer. You are, in effect, saying that
the child must simply accept the story as given, without testing it
against their own experience or their own notion of justice and
compassion. While the latter ought not be the ultimate yard stick, it
should certainly sound an alarm if a religious teaching proclaims
compassion yet appears to lack it in its most basic teaching. I should
think it far better to explain why we should accept that god's actions
appear less charitable than the child's own would have been, and why
the child should continue to seriously question actions that appear
unkind or downright devious.I didn't say all that. You read that into
what I said. My point was simply to note that we shouldn't expect to
know all about God's deepest purposes, by the very nature of the case
(or Being). Later I made analogies to the many deep mysteries of
science (origins of life, DNA, why gravity acts as it does, etc.). I'm
contending that if we can acknowledge mystery in science, why not also
in theology? In that context I was presupposing belief in God. If you
grant that, then given the traditional theistic / Jewish / Christian
concept of a transcendent, monotheistic, omniscient, omnipotent God, it
is foolish to think that we can figure all that out, since clearly such
a Being is many magnitudes greater in thinking ability.THAT was my
point: not that one should render blind faith, or be a fideist. I have
always opposed that. I would never urge that on anyone. Now, if people
in your past or Dave's taught that they were wrong, and I fully agree
with your general critique of their mentality. More tomorrow. Gotta go
catch the movie about John Lennon on VH-1.

Steve Parker said: I'm very happy to be both.[both Atheist and an
ex-christian]Hi Steve. Yeah, me too. Actually, I'm an Agnostic Atheist
who's a former christian. In any event, the point of the distinction I
made was to point out that Exchristian.net is not exclusively comprised
of &quot;Atheists&quot;, as our Christian guest erroneously implied on his
blog..e.g..&quot;a flourishing Atheist website.&quot; And boy, if he can't even
get the simple stuff accurate, I surely wouldn't count on him being
accurate when it comes to the larger, more complex issues----for
instance, like claims of knowing the creator of the Universe.Take care.

desire to believe in the supernatural, you are willing to overlook your
own supposition. Isn't that what the total fallacy of religions is
anyway?Your longing for a belief in the after life that you are willing
to deny the obvious? The obvious truth being, that it's all a lie.

That's the reason you need a catalyst called 'faith' in order to make
something appear in the mind of the believer to be true.Anytime you
need faith in order to believe something, you are expected to go beyond
your own intellectual honesty and accentually lie to yourself knowing
full well deep down inside it could not possibly be true.Kill the old
self and lie to the new self, step beyond reality into mental delusions
of psuedo grandeur.This is what Dave Va did, he analized that what he
was trying to force himself to believe by 'faith' all those years to
believe, he finally decided it was time to quit fooling himself into
believing such incredable imbecilic nonsense, which I believe most
atheists have come to the same conclusion.

Hi Dave A!I stopped by your site and read your article about me. I will
have to say, you are prolific.You are undoubtedly correct that my
thinking and my reasoning in places is faulty. I've never claimed to be
the brightest candle in the box, and I am painfully aware of my
limitations in that department as well as many other areas. I am, at
best, an average guy. Regardless, I wrote my little testimonial in 2001
more as a cathartic exercise and to &quot;come out&quot; to my family and
friends. I never intended it as a full-scale refutation of
Christianity, anymore than a Christian testimonial is intended to be an
detailed apologetic explaining how Christianity is the truth. My
testimonial, such as it is, became the first published page of this
website. With literally no one to talk to about de-converting from
Christianity, I was reaching out to anyone. Somehow, people stumbled on
to the testimonial, responded to it, and this website took on a life of
its own. Again, that article is a testimonial, and only meant to give a
snapshot into my life, how I became a Christian, and some of what I
went through before my agonizing decision to give up the holy ghost.
Leaving Christianity made a major disruption in my life and the life of
my children, even though it was a slow, gradual process. My comments
and articles in the years since 2001 merely reflect my opinions as
they've continued to develop. Hopefully I'm a better thinker and a
better writer, but I'm still just an average guy. I have a long way to
go before I would dare consider myself an authority on much of
anything. Just FYI: I never read a single book or article that refuted
Christianity prior to my de-conversion. I didn't know much about
critical thinking, logic, or philosophy. I was a fully committed
believer, though, and in my 30s wanted to really know the &quot;real truth.&quot;
It was by studying the Bible itself, the formation of the Bible, the
history and development of the Church, ever changing theology, etc.,
all as explained by respected theologians from across the spectrum of
Christianity that helped me come to the conclusion that Christianity is
bunk. It wasn't one or two contradictions in the Bible that gave me
doubts. It wasn't that respected scholars from different eras have been
and today are in complete disagreement with each other over many
thousands of doctrinal and theological points. It wasn't that the
history of the church is filled with horrific bloodshed, cruelty, and
ignorance. It wasn't that real live Christians seemed more interested
in feeling the Spirit and less interested in actually learning
anything. It wasn't any of those things. It was all of those things. My
de-conversion was a holistic experience. To be simplistic, the pieces
of the puzzle went together and I saw a picture I hadn't expected.
Anyway, you seem to be accusing of having no valid reasons to leave
Christianity. Well, if someone could offer me some valid reasons to
re-join Christianity, then I'd have to reconsider my position. Can you
show me any evidence outside your book of myths for the existence of a
mysterious, maniacal, meglomanic, Jewish deity living somewhere in the
sky that has promised everlasting retributive horror to be reigned down
on all those who have the wrong thoughts in their heads about his
existence? Of course, there is more to Christianity than threats of
damnation for doubting HE even exists, but that certainly is a big part
of it. I mean, what in the world have any of us &quot;average Joe's&quot; ever
done in our lives that justice would demand our everlasting torture?
I'm no saint, as the expression goes, but I've never been to jail for
anything. My life is mundane. Most people would find me dull and
boring, and more than a few, perhaps, even ugly (Hence the sunglasses).
What I'm trying to say is that just because I've masturbated, or had an
impure thought, or been angry, or said &quot;F*** you!&quot; or been unkind on
occasion... Do those accumulated &quot;sins&quot; really warrant everlasting
torture? Are you serious? Really?I had a car accident a couple of years
ago and totaled the vehicle. I took out a telephone pole, which smashed
down on the roof of the car. It was a mess. It was 5 a.m. in winter and
I simply lost control of the car. However, I was cited for the
accident, because there was property damage. Now, if when I appeared
before the judge to pay my debt to society, a friend stood with me, and
paid the debt for me, was the debt still paid, or should I still seek
forgiveness from the judge? Say the friend paid the debt and then the
judge said, &quot;I forgive you your debt!&quot; How could the judge forgive me
my debt, since my friend had already paid the bill? Forgiving a debt
means there is no longer a need for payment or forgiveness of the debt,
right? That was probably a terrible analogy, but the point is this:
Christianity claims that God sent the propitiation for our sins in the
form of Jesus Christ. The debt for sin was paid. If the debt is paid,
why are we still encouraged to seek forgiveness? Forgiveness for what?
How can we be forgiven for a debt that is paid? If I am forgiven a
debt, that means someone is out some money. A forgiven debt is a debt
that is NEVER paid. If someone pays the debt, then the scales are
equal. No debt means no need of forgiveness for the debt. Christianity
is loaded with logical inconsistencies, and because of my long
indoctrination in the cult, I wake up to more and more on a regular
basis.

take in the mystery of it all, but instead, I would commend him/her on
the great question and simply say that we don't know yet, but that
maybe when he grows up, he can find evidence and answer that question.I
agree that, yes, considering the unfathomability of God's omniscience -
His raw thinking ability infinitely greater than ours - it's really
haughty of us to think that we really know what is in His mind...well,
other than the fact that He hates fags, which is a given.

Mr Arvo, hi. The postings here have become lengthy and detailed, and
not a little confusing, but something &quot;DA&quot; said made me giggle. This
was about the child who asked difficult questions. DA's response was
that god was unknowable and that we cannot presume to question him. Do
I have that right? Well shit, how much sense does it make to postulate
a god who is unknowable, and then turn around and say god is
unknowable? How much sense does it make to dream up a god who is
all-knowing and all-powerful, and then turn around and say we can't
question him? About this business of supplying missing details, like
for the Judas story. My favorite is the one about the stars. Some
christians still think that the earth is 6000 years old, but we can see
stars that are a lot farther away than 6000 light years. Explaination:
when god made the stars, he also made the light between the stars and
the earth. Clever, huh?

Continuing my reply to Jim Arvo:DA: &quot;...many atheists collapse
Christianity into know-nothing fundamentalism, so that it can be
dismissed as 'anti-intellectual' and 'anti-science'...&quot;I don't know who
the &quot;many&quot; are that you speak of.Isn't it obvious even in this combox?
E.g.:rd:&quot;the total fallacy of religions is anyway? Your longing for a

lie to the new self, step beyond reality into mental delusions of
psuedo [sic]grandeur.&quot;. . . incredable [sic] imbecilic
nonsense . . .&quot;It was clear in Dave's deconversion as well. Such
rhetoric is very common among atheists / agnostics /
skeptics / &quot;freethinkers&quot;. Look at Dawkins and Hitchens, for heaven's
sake. There are exceptions (you seem to be one of them and I know
others personally from the Internet and in &quot;real life&quot;) but I stand by
my generalization, based on many years of experience of debates and
discussions. I used the word &quot;many&quot;; not &quot;most&quot; or &quot;almost all.&quot;At
exchristian.net there are hundreds of Christian visitors who zealously
place themselves into this category by refusing to examine any of their
beliefs and by attempting to discredit science in the large with
childishly simplistic and fallacious arguments. We, as a rule, do not
use such visitors as an excuse to dismiss anything (which is what you
are apparently suggesting).Why deal with them at all? If thinking
Christians and ex-Christians agree that they shouldn't be dealt with
seriously, then why the obsession with them? It's because (IMHO) that
is the easiest way for an ex-Christian to live with his or her decision
to leave Christianity. It's in their interest to caricature
Christianity into the silly anti-intellectual wing of it, so it can be
rejected (because even a Christian like myself would readily reject the
same things insofar as they are stupid and mindless). You take the very
worst, fringe aspects of something in order to reject it.In fact, some
sites, like Debunking Christianity, state right out that they are
interested mainly if not solely, in dealing with fundamentalist
Christianity. 95% or so of the remaining sectors of Christianity are
ignored (Catholicism, Orthodoxy, Lutheranism, more sophisticated brands
of Presbyterianism and Calvinism in general: folks like Alvin
Plantinga, Anglo-Catholicism, Methodism, etc.).Serious analysis of a
competing view will deal with the most respectable form of it, not the
dumbest and least respectable.However, they do get dismissed because
they contribute nothing.And then a serious Christian who comes along
gets to deal with all their baggage and the latent hostile attitudes,
as if they represented the sum of Christianity . . . DA: &quot;...what makes
him [Dave] think that he knows better than scholars who have studied
these things for years? This is a common motif in atheist
deconversions. They know better than everyone else.&quot;Tell me, which
scholar should we all listen to?I wasn't talking about any particular
one, but all of them as a class. Again, if one is to rationally dismiss
a point of view, shouldn't he at least seek out some of the better
representatives of it? That was my point. I kept wondering if Dave had
even tried to do that, or if he would ask a question of some pastor who
wouldn't have a clue, and then just give up, as if no Christian on the
face of the earth could offer the slightest reply to his probing
questions.You know as well as I that 1) what some scholars have to say
is not worthy of the name &quot;scholarship&quot;, and 2) there are legitimate
scholars on both sides of practically any issue.Sure, but that was
irrelevant to my point, clarified above.In the end, each of us must
decide which line of reasoning is most coherent and has the greater
force of evidence (thanks, in part, to the efforts of legitimate
scholars).Indeed. That's what I'm saying: read the best of both sides,
in any given debate, not the best of one and worst of the other, or
only one side. Having studied the arguments of a great many apologists
who purport to dismantle the &quot;so-called contradictions&quot;, I can say with
little hesitation that I find their arguments to be artificial and
filled with special pleading and often circular reasoning. (See below
for an example.)As I have found the hackneyed, facile skeptical
arguments, that are often so silly that they don't even understand that
a clear formal contradiction is not present at all, but simply wished
upon the texts, as a result of the usual predispositional bias of the
textual critic. I have several examples on my site.I don't deny that
there are difficult textual questions. Of course there are (and there
are silly Christian arguments to be found), and Christian scholars
devote entire careers to them in some cases. But many &quot;difficulties&quot;
are in fact, none at all.Do I know better than everyone else? No, I
don't believe so, and I don't claim to. But I have a well-thought-out
position--one that is coherent, and has benefited from exposure to
nimble minds on both sides (Plantinga, who you mention, is among
them).Good for you. I would say exactly the same about my own view.
Looks like you and I, then, may be able to engage in some excellent,
fruitful dialogue. It's the love of truth and reason and dialogue that
allows that to take place. Bottom line: don't dismiss all atheists as
simply thinking they are smarter than anybody else.Many clearly do
think so. Again, I appeal to the rhetoric commonly seen here and in
similar places, about how &quot;imbecilic&quot; and &quot;obviously false&quot;
Christianity is. That is the language of condescension and
a &quot;know-it-all&quot; mentality. You are an exception, apparently, but
exceptions don't disprove the rule, as they say.Instead, I encourage
you to address their arguments with the same dedication that they put
into forming them.I did my best with Dave's anti-testimony, and am
doing so presently.Regarding how Judas met his demise, DA said &quot;... And
so, did Judas hang himself...or did he 'fall headlong'? Both are
obviously true.&quot;Obviously?! Why is that obvious? What is obvious is
that it is not a formal contradiction. It just isn't. As a professor,
surely you can see and acknowledge that. The two passages can easily be
synthesized in several different ways. A true contradiction would be
something along the lines of:1) Judas went and hanged himself and died
in five minutes, and his dead body had only a mark on his neck.2) Judas
did not hang himself from a tree, but rather, fell headlong onto sharp
rocks and his bowels gushed out and he died.THAT is clearly a
contradiction, and no one would deny it. But the biblical texts under
consideration are not.Certainly not by a plain reading of the text. Do
you think it improper for someone to point to the two different
accounts and suggest that they contradict?They could possibly, but not
necessarily. When one approaches texts with such hostility and
animosity coming in, itching to find a contradiction, then they
will &quot;see&quot; them where there are none. It seems to me that Christian,
though biased in favor of harmonization of biblical texts, at least
comes to it with a positive goal of understanding it in a coherent way.
But the critic assumes that it is a bundle of contradictions, written
by gullible nomadic idiots and shepherds, and so find what they want to
find.DA: &quot;He hung himself. When did he fall headlong? Did the rope
break? Or did his 'entrails gush out' when others came along to cut him
down from the tree (assuming he actually hung himself from a tree
limb)...and he split open when he hit the ground? There is a lot of
data the Bible doesn't tell us.&quot;Right, lots of details will be missing
from any story. However, this does not give you license to ADD whatever
detail you wish. In this case you are assuming that the missing details
will harmonize the two accounts. Why do you assume that?Because I am
giving the texts the benefit of the doubt, that both parties were
telling the truth according to the information available to them, and
that the two can be synthesized and harmonized, just as we would do
with two witnesses in a trial, of good character and reputation. We
don't assume that their eyewitness accounts clash or that someone is
lying because there are some details that don't harmonize at first
glance.It is also possible that the missing details would make it even
more difficult to harmonize the accounts.Of course. But the Christian
who harmonizes is basically expanding upon what we know in the texts.
Nothing wrong with that, just as historical fiction is considered valid
as far as it goes: as speculation building upon what we know. Missing
details are MISSING. We do not know what they are. If you claim that
there is no contradiction because facts can be inserted to harmonize
them, then you are begging the question--i.e. you claim there is no
contradiction because fact X can be inserted to harmonize the accounts.
But if your reason for assuming X is that it harmonizes the accounts,
that is circular. Not quite. :-) I am saying that there was no
contradiction in the first place. A formal contradiction has not been
established; as in most atheist arguments of this sort, it is assumed
with insufficient warrant. You have to first prove that a formal
contradiction is present IN THE TEXT. When the Christian speculates on
unknown details, it is an argument from plausibility or possibility,
not strict logic. That is permissible, but claiming contradictions when
they cannot be proven is what is out of line, and lousy thinking.I
grant that the aspect of the texts having to do with purchase of the
land is more likely to be a contradiction, and the

Ricky said (in response to Dave A):&quot;To a child asking a difficult
question about scientific processes (i.e. anything), I wouldn't tell a
kid to just be quiet and take in the mystery of it all, but instead, I
would commend him/her on the great question and simply say that we
don't know yet, but that maybe when he grows up, he can find evidence
and answer that question&quot;I agree. The mysteries in science are
discernable and testable and, ultimately knowable. There is nothing in
religion, contrary to the claims, that is. Dave A states: &quot;we can
acknowledge mystery in science, why not also in theology?&quot;, as though
the two were comparable. Given the fact that the theories of science
can be proven with observation and testing and the theories of religion
cannot be, the two are not the same, that is, they are not comparable.
Dave A started this with the statement: “why do you presume to question
God's purposes for doing anything, or act as if we would or could or
should understand everything that God does, in the first place?&quot; and
then when Jim Arvo calls him on it, claims that he meant something else
all together. This is a tactic that I have seen xtians use
frequently.(By the way Jim, I read his refutation of the WM testimony
as well and read your responses to the same points that I saw. Well
posted!)Dave A said:“…supposedly anti-science…” and &quot;…allegedly 'caused
the Dark Ages.'&quot;Dave, you use the words ‘supposedly’ and ‘allegedly’ as
though there is some question about the statements they are attached to
and in examining your website, you do a lot of that. There is no
‘supposedly’ and 'allegedly' about their application in this instance
and using language to suggest otherwise is simply a form of dishonesty.
The Catholic Church has a long and well documented history of
suppressing science, with the tools brought to bear being censure,
torture and murder. (Ask the Aztecs! The church destroyed their ENTIRE
collection of written works as well as tortured and murdered them,
which the pope recently called “a merging of cultures?!”. I can’t begin
to express the depth of my contempt for that!) This is continuing today
with the drive by religious factions of different denominations, to
discredit evolution and require the teaching of ‘god’s truth’ that of
creation, dishonestly labeled as ‘intelligent design’. The more extreme
of the pious want to achieve this end and others, with ‘biblical
justice’, the subjugation and death of all who oppose them. The dark
ages were brought about by the Catholic Church's control of knowledge.
This extended to the confiscation of scientific and engineering texts
and their subsequent destruction. It also included, and still does to
this day, the censoring of knowledge that their laity may possess. The
advancement of enlightenment, both scientifically and socially, was
achieved in spite of, not because of the Catholic Church. In addition,
the church has a history of leveraging political systems to their own
end and still do so to this day, with their summoning of our Catholic
senators and representatives to demand explanations as to why they are
not voting the church line.When knowledge is suppressed to the
magnitude that was achieved and is trying to be achieved, then “Dark
Ages” ensue.

Hi Dave Armstrong,It's very difficult to come to the conclusion that
Christianity doesn't make sense, or any religion for that matter. The
hard part is really separating your self from it. Most people identify
with their beliefs on a very personal level and are offended if someone
questions them. Belief equals identity. Threatening someone’s identity
usually puts people in a fight mode. If there is no way to prove that
your prayers are answered, that a god exists or that the claims in
religious writings are true, then why defend them. Just leave
ex-Christians alone and get on with serving your god. I surmise that
the very existence of people claiming to have been where you are today
is disconcerting to you and you feel compelled to prove that they are
wrong. Or it may be your desire to prove your love for god, or to
defeat the forces of darkness and win back the lost or disillusioned,
or prove to yourself that you know better and the ex-Christian doesn’t,
etc.Whatever the belief, motivation and emotion behind your actions,
you can be sure they are personal and not driven by god or pure
rational thought. They are emotional driven. Hopefully you will look
beyond whatever belief and emotion you possess about this subject and
try and step back and think outside the Christian box. If not, there
isn’t any point in these conversations. I have been where you are. I
have a college and seminary degree, served as a minister, teacher,
pastoral counselor and church leader. I have stepped out of the box and
taken a long look at Christianity and recognize the inconsistencies and
illogic of it’s beliefs. I can see the disunity in theology, doctrine,
and denominations. I can see the dis-connect between science and faith.
Maybe one day you will too. Good luckBill J.

DA, the quotes you list do not make it any more reasonable to treat a
statement about lack of &quot;proof&quot; as equivalent to having &quot;no reason
whatsoever to reject Christianity&quot;. Those are radically different
assertions, so you attack a straw man. Moreover, asserting that a
belief is bunk is not equivalent to claiming that it is proven false. I
think ESP and stories of alien abductions are bunk--meaning that they
can be safely dismissed as unwarranted beliefs--without any &quot;proof&quot;
that they are false. Do you think this an unreasonable position? I'll
assume not. My position toward Christianity (as well as that of many
others here) is not much different.Here's a short recap of the
discussion concerning a response to a child:DA: &quot;I would ask the child
back: 'why do you presume to question God's purposes for doing
anything, or act as if we would or could or should understand
everything that God does, in the first place?'&quot;JA: &quot;You are, in effect,
saying that the child must simply accept the story as given, without
testing it against their own experience or their own notion of justice
and compassion....&quot;DA: &quot;I didn't say all that. You read that into what
I said. My point was simply to note that we shouldn't expect to know
all about God's deepest purposes...&quot;What does the phrase &quot;presume to
question&quot; convey, if not a rebuke? Why would the child even think to
ask why god had set up such a scenario in the Garden of Eden if not for
the seeming unfairness of it? (That was the context of this question,
after all.) Why would it seem unfair except through the child's own
experience and sense of &quot;justice&quot;? So, no, you didn't &quot;say&quot; all that,
but I didn't assume anything that wasn't clearly implied. I might add
that the child's question did not suggest that they expected to
know &quot;all about God's deepest purposes&quot;, but rather that there was
something incongruous that needed explaining. I say again: Yours was a
terrible answer--the kind that thwarts healthy questioning.DA: &quot;...if
one is to rationally dismiss a point of view, shouldn't he at least
seek out some of the better representatives of it?&quot;Yes, of course. Do
you imply that people here have not done that? Many made a desperate
effort to rescue their waning beliefs by pursuing a wide spectrum of
apologetics, looking for something well-founded. The Webmaster himself
went though this. It sounds as though you chastise them for not having
settled upon your particular brand of Christianity. Each sect could
take the same stand (and to a degree, that's what they do). Not
everybody thinks Catholicism is the most rational branch of
Christianity--I'm sure you are aware of that. (To the regulars here:
Please pardon my understatement.)DA: &quot;...I have found the hackneyed,
facile skeptical arguments, that are often so silly that they don't
even understand that a clear formal contradiction is not present at
all, but simply wished upon the texts, as a result of the usual
predispositional [presuppositional?] bias of the textual critic.&quot;That's
quite a nasty indictment of &quot;skeptical arguments&quot;. May I suggest you
stop evading them under cover of that word &quot;formal&quot;? If you cannot
bring yourself to admit that the clear surface meaning of the two Judas
accounts are problematic, then it seems to me that you cannot even
enter into the debate in a meaningful way IMHO.

A Question for Dave Armstrong or any Catholic here:We've had some
recent discussions here about Mother Teresa.A recent Time Magazine
article on her, spoke about letters she wrote, where she stated
that 'god went dark' on her, and he evidently did so before she started
her ministry in those awful cities etc..As I recall, her reasoning
for &quot;god going dark&quot;, was that it was just too awful (or painful) for
god to go with her into those cities and so forth. Such flawless
reasoning, I must say.Obvsioulsy her god going dark didn't stop her
mission (notice I didn't say 'blessed' mission here), nor did she seem
to turn her back on her catholic faith.So that leads to my
question.....Assuming (which us ex-xtians do) that there is NO xtian
god to answer prayers or guide us in life, what do you suppose the
current Pope is thinking about his god going dark on him?What do I
mean, you ask.One who is chosen to be the grand pupa to such a
mainstream god-sanctioned church, and receives the top honor of being
the POPE, would surely expect to be in daily direct contact with this
god entity, yes?Now because the folks here know that any Pope can't be
in communication with this god entity, there can be only three
possibilities/choices for the current pope.1. If he's hearing answers
or receiving guidance from 'above', then it has to be some little voice
in his head generating those answers. What a scary thought it is to
think someone with such a little voice talking to them would be making
policy for such a huge organization.2. He has no little voices in his
head going on and is still waiting patiently for this god to make
contact with him. If this is the case, he has to be wondering why god
has shunned him so far, as he did to Mother Teresa. Perhaps he's
thinking he wasn't worthy of the post he was elected to, but in time,
maybe this god will deem him worth if he just tries harder etc..3. He's
already decided god will never communicate with him during his reign as
pope.What a position to be put in. How can he bow out when he's still
healthy and a god sanctioned election committee has chosen him to be in
that position.Thus, he's stuck between a rock and a hard place and
surely by now has totally lost his faith in this god being. So now he
has to fake it and make hard decisions/policy without any guidance from
his god, all the while pretending to his mass of followers that it's
all coming direct from god almighty. Can you imagine being promoted
into such a high holy position, only to discover it's all MAKE-BELIEVE
after all?ATF

Dave Armstrong: I grant that the aspect of the texts having to do with
purchase of the land is more likely to be a contradiction, and the
explanations we offer less plausible and strong. (emphasis added)And
therefore, under the standard you claim to subscribe to, that makes
this a contradiction.Dave Armstrong: My ACTUAL position is to examine
proposed contradictions and see if there is a PLAUSIBLE (NOT &quot;any&quot;)
explanation that can account for it and defeat the suggestion of
contradiction. And not just plausible, but more plausible and
believable than the opposing view. Found Here. If the explanation (as
you claim) is not “more plausible and believable” than the
contradiction; this must be a contradiction. If you abide by your own
standard.So…where again was Dave VanAllen incorrect in agreeing with
your own conclusion the accounts of Judas’ death are contradictory?

reported the events as they saw them or understood them.I shot back and
said &quot;I want the facts. Does your bible have the facts? Yes or no? How
many angels, and where were they?&quot;The silence was deafening. After

Maybe it was a mistranslation in the original text. Maybe Judas &quot;fell
necklong&quot;...The problem with many/most of the Xtian and biblical
stories generally is that there are too many moving parts. In some of
the reading I've done about/by Nisargadatta (an example
of &quot;nondualism&quot;, a sort of thought-yoga) the practioners of nondualism
consider that the big mistake is in not knowing who and what we really
are. Most of us spend most of our lives thinking that we are a mind
being carried around in a body moving around in the world, when the
true state of things is not that we are in the world but that the world
is in us. Hence, what we really are will not pass away at the time when
the &quot;food-body&quot; drops away at what we think of as our death. This is
not that far from the story and message of the Jesus character in the
bible, except that in the latter there's a slavish reliance on the
putative historicity of said Jesus of Nazareth, who likely never
existed.Same with Zen Buddhism; many of the ultra-compressed Zen koans,
the little apparently anti-intellectual riddles the devotees have to
sort out &quot;on their way&quot; to self-realisation, can be fluffed up to
full-length stories about biblical characters (who also probably never
existed). e.g. Maybe the Zen question &quot;Is the flag moving in the wind,
or is the wind moving in the flag?&quot; can be matched up with Jesus
turning the water into wine, or some other story (don't know, or care,
which one) that also never happened.Whatever. The 3 big Abrahamic
religions are all cumbersome, inadequate rickety vehicles for bearing
any sort of spiritual payload around to the world's people, and the
best that can be said of them is that they might work on the back
burner of the minds of people who like a good fable without ever quite
perceiving what it was about the fable that they liked. All I know is
wherever they go, violence follows. Violence to thought (e.g. the
Galileo scenario, or Kent Hovind blocking his videos as quotable
sources from YouTube, and other forms of book-burning), and,
inevitably, violence to ordinary people.

material, and related comments, I've reconsidered. Instead, I'd simply
like to share some observations.Your chief complaint with Dave Van
Allen's anti-testimony seems to be that it failed to measure up to a
certain epistemic standard. Ok, fine. But so what? That was not his
goal, and he stated as much in the text. Indeed, I note that, in your
conversion story (evangelical to Catholic), you too failed to provide
an epistemological survey of the alleged evidence uncovered during your
studies. To be sure, you hint at your studies and imply they helped
lead you to your conclusions, but you did not discuss specifics. Should
we therefore dismiss it too as worthless because it has no probative
value as written?Essentially, your critique reads like an extended ad
hominem in which you've set yourself up as judge over his experiences.
Dave didn't read the right books, didn't ask the right questions,
didn't reach the right conclusions. Dave and those around him were
ignorant, lazy, or just too, well, PROTESTANT!This brings me to another
point.In your opening, you imply that Dave's personal testimony
contains &quot;the reasons that atheists give for being an atheist,&quot; and set
the stage for your subsequent ridicule by alluding to the impression
some believers have that atheists are intellectual elitists. In
addition to these things, which Jim rightly called &quot;crass
generalizations,&quot; you mock his intellectual integrity, clearing the way
for you to claim that Dave is, in fact, &quot;irrational,&quot; &quot;brainwashed,&quot;
and &quot;anti-intellectual.&quot;In short, you set up and wrestled a straw man.
Congratulations. You win.Others, most notably Jim, have already engaged
you on Judas and your suggested answer to a questioning child, so I'll
leave it to their good offices to continue if they wish. I've got other
fish to fry.

I've been reviewing Dave A's responses and rebuttals on this topic. He
has been posting them on his own site instead of here. It's a different
way of carrying on a conversation, but when in Rome…In case you read
this, Dave A, I apologize for misjudging you in regards to breaking
your word in my one comment above. I misread your exchange on that one
particular blog to imply you would be continuing a conversation right
there, in that thread -- on that website. It never occurred to me that
you would respond to a conversation on a website by posting a response
on a completely different website -- your own!. But now that I've
observed your method, I realize my error. I would have appreciated it
if you had pointed this out to me in person and given me the
opportunity to respond, but regardless, I made an assumption which was
erroneous, so I stand corrected. My real intention with putting out
those links wasn't to personally attack you, but to apprise others
reading and posting here of your online background and thus save a lot
of needless questions. You stated this: &quot;I make sure that all atheists
and agnostics are treated cordially and respectfully on my (Catholic)
blog.&quot;Your heartwarming courtesy to me and others, as well as your
graceful presentation on behalf of your religion, has certainly added
immeasurably toward supporting the premise of the original topic of
this page. For that, you have my sincere thanks.Peace.

Dave Armstrong said:&quot;I make sure that all atheists and agnostics are
treated cordially and respectfully on my (Catholic) blog.&quot;From his
blog:&quot;Angry, Irrational Atheists and Other Ex-Christians On the Prowl
Again&quot;&quot;I have no hostility towards atheists...&quot; yet &quot;...quite
irrational, rude, absurd, and foolish...&quot; and &quot;...condescending,
hostile, patronizing...&quot;&quot;...a dozen or so of his cronies on his (this)
blog...&quot; So we are all cronies?&quot;Twelve or so insulting atheists against
one Christian attempting to participate in rational discourse: that
sounds fair and right, doesn't it?&quot; Did he honestly belive that we he
presented his beliefs here that only ONE of us would
respond?&quot;remarkable and pathetic parade of irrational anger and
folly&quot;These are just some of his statements, granted taken out of
context, on his cordial and respectful blob. He goes on to say: &quot;Hardly
any of them dare to come to my blog, where they would be treated with
politeness and courtesy, but I am expected to stay there and engage
in &quot;discourse.&quot; Not a chnace.&quot; And this is one of the responses to that
particular blog: &quot;Also, in watching you never shrink from debate with
credentialed Phds and the like...&quot; Well he did. This guy contradicts
himself constantly and his &quot;cronies&quot; help him do it.

Thanks to the webmaster for the apology. I will edit my post
accordingly. You still have out on the table, however, the accusation
that my stay at Debunking Christianity was an example of &quot;trolling.&quot;
The fact of the matter is that I stayed for 3 1/2 months and engaged in
19 major dialogues with several people. As I wrote, if that
is &quot;trolling&quot; then I am most proud to be a troll and hope to continue
to be one.To Huey and to others who claim that my strong words somehow
represent a blatant contradiction of my claim to treat atheists
courteously on my blog:First of all, my words were warranted in light
of the crap I have been receiving here in this very thread.Secondly, a
person's ideas are not identical to himself. I was referring to an
atheist who showed up on my blog. They are treated politely and
courteously, not just by myself, but pretty much everyone. We don't
indulge in insult-fests such as went on in this thread. That doesn't
mean I use kid-gloves and walk on pins and needles. I speak my mind,
and quite directly, as you can all see. Doesn't mean I am rude and
impolite.John Loftus showed up recently, and he was treated politely.
He asked if I would reply to some of his papers, and I did (spending
several hours on it). But he insulted me on my blog before he ever saw
that I had responded.Huey has now shown up and he is being treated
politely: http://www.haloscan.com/comments/davearmstrong/7789982106164661449/?a...
He asked how I felt I was insulted here, so I documented that. One of
the things was, of course, what DVA retracted (which I
appreciate): http://www.haloscan.com/comments/davearmstrong/7789982106164661449/?a...
Some may object to my post on angry atheists. Yet Christopher Hitchens
is a public person who acted despicably in public to a well-known
priest (one who was a hero of 9-11, in fact), calling him a child
molester and the like, two inches from his face. If he wants to act
like that in public, we have every right to use the example as a
counter to the self-promoting atheist image as peaceful, polite, always
rational, respectful folks. It's not always true. Any group of people
is varied, but atheists are no better or worse than anyone else, and
there are many irrationally angry atheists, as I know well from
firsthand experience.I also gave many examples from this blog of the
rhetoric of &quot;hate&quot; against Christians and Christianity; the highlight
being one person's graphic descriptions of clawing away at the faces of
Billy Graham and Jesus and screaming how much he hates them. Yet we
Christians are constantly characterized on this blog as haters. I saw
many dozens of such statements while I was doing that search.What's
good for the goose is good for the gander. If you want to act as if you
are so intellectually superior to Christians and treat one who shows up
as if he was an infantile moron, then don't object if said person
documents some of the manifestly objectionable behavior of some of your
own (in fact, the very person who was the subject of the post under
which is this combox).None of that has anything to do with personal
politeness and being willing to dialogue with anyone who can sustain a
rational, amiable discussion. I'm all for that. But it clearly wasn't
happening here, so I left.I'm only here now out of my desire to
publicly acknowledge a gracious apology and to respond to Huey's
feeling that nothing objectionable happened here in this thread. If any
of you are truly interested in a constructive dialogue with a thinking
Christian (not the fundamentalist know-nothings you constantly harp
about); one who doesn't say you are automatically immoral or will go to
hell for sure, or were never a Christian, I'm your man. But it has to
be a real dialogue, not the insulting rhetoric that we saw in this
thread.

&quot;Also, in watching you never shrink from debate with credentialed Phds
and the like...&quot; Well he did.Nope. I was going along with Jim Arvo and
then he made these comments:&quot;If you actually have something of
substance to offer, then please direct me to it, or recap it here. I
honestly don't have the time to sift through all you've written looking
for something that may make sense to me.&quot;. . . If you cannot bring
yourself to admit that the clear surface meaning of the two Judas
accounts are problematic, then it seems to me that you cannot even
enter into the debate in a meaningful way IMHO.&quot;That is not me fleeing
for the hills in abject terror. It was his decision to become insulting
so that it was perfectly reasonable and sensible (given the time
limitations that we all have) for me to conclude that good dialogue had
come to an end. If you are having a good conversation, you don't tell
the other person &quot;If you actually have something of substance to offer,
then please direct me to it&quot; and make a snide remark like &quot;looking for
something [in your writing] that may make sense to me&quot;. That, of
course, implies that much of your opponent's reply lacks substance,
which in turn sabotages mutually-respectful dialogue. The second thing
that killed intelligent dialogue is the arrogant claim that if I didn't
admit up front that the two accounts of Judas' death were &quot;problematic&quot;
then I &quot;cannot even enter into the debate in a meaningful way.&quot; That
forces me to presuppose the very position that we are arguing about, in
which case, no discussion would be possible or necessary, since I would
agree with Jim's position by default, before I dare to criticize
it.That is clearly unacceptable. And so the discussion was over. I was
actually enjoying it quite a bit until this non sequitur nonsense came
in. I think it is a shame whenever a good discussion gets sidetracked
by inanities, like this one did.Jim had gotten mad because I said I
thought he was obfuscating because he was picking around the edges of
my point of view but not engaging it directly. Perhaps I was too blunt
or insulting myself, yet the gist of my observation was undeniably
true. he was not interacting with the actual scenarios that I set forth
for my position, but talking only in generalities.

From his blog:&quot;Angry, Irrational Atheists and Other Ex-Christians On
the Prowl Again&quot;Yes, this looks terrible, doesn't it?, if that is all
anyone knows. Yet what I documented was highly objectionable. I started
out positively:----------------Let me start out with a strong
disclaimer: I personally know many atheists who do not (repeat: do NOT)
fit into this characterization. I've often defended atheists against
individual irrational Christians. One must judge every person
individually. Atheists may possibly be saved. Some who state that they
are former Christians may very well indeed have been Christians at one
time (a non-Calvinist Christian need not deny this, as it is a quite
biblical notion). Atheists are not inevitably immoral or amoral or
ethically relativistic, or politically liberal, etc. I've stated all
this many times. I have nothing against atheists as people. I have no
hostility towards atheists as a class, or prejudice whatsoever. I
approach anyone and everyone with an unassuming attitude and without
cynicism. In fact, I cause myself no end of misery for this
reason.---------------I also ended positively, citing atheist Jim
Lazarus vociferously condemning other atheists whom he thought were
most unfair to theists because they called theism a mind disease and so
forth.It's not about attacking all atheists; only one questionable and
common manifestation of atheism, just as you bash various Christian
beliefs and Christian behaviors while admitting that not all fall into
the category. Same difference.Or are atheists immune to all criticism
whatsoever from Christians?

DA: If any of you are truly interested in a constructive dialogue with
a thinking Christian (not the fundamentalist know-nothings you
constantly harp about)Heavens no, not the
fundamentalist &quot;know-nothings&quot;, but the polar opposite---the
fundamentalist know-everything,'s. Now, am I wrong and overly
aggressive in my assessment? Let's see.Question 1: Is not the Catholic
interpretation of the Holy Bible the final Word on everything regarding
the Universe, and all of Existence?Question 2: If your worldview was
admittedly wrong as an Evangelical/Protestant, could you be possibly
wrong as a Catholic?Question 3: If &quot;yes&quot; to question 2, what would
falsify your beliefs, thus, disproving it as Universal Truth?

DA, I refer to people who go to other peoples' websites itching for a
fight, trolls. Regardless of your narrowly selected Wikipedian
snippets, jumping around the Internet looking for arguments such as you
have been doing the past few years can rightly be defined as trolling.
The root idea behind the Internet trolling is from fishing. It has
nothing to do with children's fables. * &quot;Trolling for fish&quot; is a form
of angling where lines with hook-rigged lures are dragged behind a boat
to entice fish to bite. Compare the term &quot;Trawling for fish,&quot; which
involves dragging a net behind a boat to catch large numbers of fish. *
Internet trolling involves a user making comments intended to provoke
an angry response. -- Wikipedia

You may not approve, appreciate, or comprehend this Dave, but the
purpose of this site is not to provide a pulpit for agressive,
self-appointed, arrogant, pseudo-evangelists. There are literally
thousands of websites out there that cater to that crowd. This site is
a sanctuary of sorts for former Christians to rant, rave, and try to
heal from the mind crippling lunacy of the cult of Christianity,
regardless of which flavor one once preferred. Those of us who wasted
decades faithfully following that insanity sometimes lack patience when
an angry fundamentalist fanatic shows up to loudly bang his or her
drum. Dave, you may be telling yourself that you've left the
fundamentalist mindset far behind, but your methods of communication
seem to indicate otherwise. Dave, this wasn't a personal attack. This
was meant as explanation and constructive criticism. Peace.

Jim Arvo has left a new comment on your post &quot;The Subtle, Lethal Poison
of Religion&quot;:

David, I humbly apologize for implying that I found no substance in the
few arguments of yours that I've read thus far.Recapping, clarifying,
and somewhat expanding what I said earlier...One cannot add elements to
accounts whose plain surface meaning conflict and thereby conclude that
there is no conflict; not without independent justification for the
elements added. Without the latter, the argument is circular.In you
discussion of the Judas accounts, whose plain surface meaning imply an
improbable scenario (the same person dying in two different ways), you
suggest possible elements that would harmonize the accounts (e.g. the
rope broke and he fell headlong...). There are also possible elements
that make the conflict more indelible (e.g. he died by disembowelment,
and he died by strangulation). I asked how you would justify adding one
rather than another.You began to address this when you said that you
assumed the accounts were honest reports of what had been told to the
writer. I asked 1) Why do you assume they are &quot;honest reports&quot; (as
opposed to story telling, midrash, exaggeration, etc.), and 2) why do
you assume that the information was accurate? There are a great many
reasons that a story may be inaccurate, only one of which is deliberate
deception (lying) on the part of the writer.It appears that you are
assuming both that the writer is honest and that the he is not
mistaken, for otherwise it would have no bearing on harmonizing the
accounts. That is, if the writer was simply relaying what he was told,
but the information was incorrect, then there is no reason to assume
that the differing accounts *can* be harmonized. (Put another way,
focusing on the writer's honesty would simply add a level of
indirection to the argument without addressing the core issue--which is
the reliability of the account, and whether we have any reason to
assume that the conflicts can be harmonized.)However, asserting that
the writer was honest and not mistaken raises a related but slightly
more subtle fallacy (again, begging the question). In making this
assertion (honest + not mistaken), you are in effect asserting that the
event actually did happen. So, the argument that you used to justify
the assumption of harmonization falls victim to essentially the same
circularity; it assumes the event DID happen as reported, which is
actually the larger point in question. I agree that if the event did
occur, then it would be reasonable to expect that all honest and
accurate reports of it would be harmonizable. However, that assumes far
too much at the outset.On &quot;formal&quot; contradictions: It's not practical
to limit use of the word &quot;contradiction&quot; to only those that
are &quot;formal&quot; in this context. The only formal contradiction is one from
which both a proposition and its negation can be deduced (not even
inductively inferred). A claim that relied upon an exception to the
Pauli exclusion principle, for example, would not be a formal
contradiction, yet it would be highly suspect given what we know about
the world. Moreover, when analyzing prose, it is almost always
necessary to interpret what is being said subjectively and through a
cultural lens. This confounds the use of formal logic to a large extent
(but not completely, of course), making it necessary to deal in
likelihoods, plausibility, corroboration, and even analogies.In reading
a small portion of your blog (and quickly scanning though more), I did
not see where you addressed any of these issues. Unless I've
misunderstood you, it appears that you feel justified in harmonizing
the Judas accounts by adding details. For reasons I've articulated
above, I do not consider that to be a valid approach without further
justification. If you have addressed these objections directly at some
point, feel free to direct me to what you have previously written, or
recap it here. Direct replies would be appreciated.
