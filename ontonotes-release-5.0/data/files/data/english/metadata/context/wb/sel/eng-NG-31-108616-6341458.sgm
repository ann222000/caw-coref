I have recently completed reading "Deep Down Things" by Bruce Schumm.
It it Bruce gives an excellent description of how quanta behave
relative how particles of like charge repel each other. However, there
is no description of how particles of opposite charge attract each
other.

Is the a similar explanation of how particles of opposite charge
attrack each other through such quanta?

It doesn't work. Exchange particles are ''virtual particles''
- as the name says, purely fictitious objects -, introduced solely
to let the complicated multidimensional integrals arising in quantum
field theory (and abbreviated by Feynamn diagrams) look somewhat
tangible. See the entry ''How real are 'virtual particles'?''
in my theoretical physics FAQ at
http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~neum/physics-faq.txt

Thus any 'explanations' of what virtual particles do is meaningless.
You could as well ask how the person (virtual image) in the mirror
you are looking manages to move its hand when you lift your hand.

Yes. The same description works equally well although it is a little
less obvious.

There are many points of view and yours maybe one of them, Feynman's may
be another, and mine a third. All of these points of view may be equally
valid and allowed to disagree when discussing physics informally.

However, the same can no longer be said when we leave the informal realm
in favor of the quantitative and scientific one. Then, a physicist, that
considers the question "What is a virtual particle?" in earnest, will
not be able to find a definition that satisfies what is usually mean by
both "virtual" and "particle".

The only definition that I know of that most can agree on is: a "virtual
particle" is an internal line on in a Feynman diagram. Since Feynman
diagrams only lives on paper, then so do virtual particles. A
quantitative treatment of these wiggly lines on papar as "particles" is
truly impossible.

As Arnold Neumaier already pointed out, it is misleading to think of a
"virtual particle" as some kind of tangible particle that is absorbed
and emitted during interactions. There is however a way of picturing a
kind of intermediary force carrier in the kinds of interactions you have
in mind.

The following picture is purely classical. Consider for example the
electromagnetic field interacting with charged particles. The
electromagnetic field is defined throughout space. Think of a taught
sheet or the surface of water as a lower dimensional example. On the
other hand, particles are localized points in space. As these particles
move, they stretch and produce ripples in the electromagnetic field.
Again, think of objects moving on the sheet or on the surface of a pond.
In either case, they produce ripples or other kinds of waves emanating
from the moving objects. These waves move away from the point particles
at a certain characteristic speed (which happens to be the speed of
light in the EM case). If there are two particles present, then each one
will change its motion when it encounters ripples produced by the other.
In effect, you see the two particles interacting, the motion of one
affects the motion of the other. But what's really happening is that
each particle changes its motion only in response to the changes in the
field around it. However, this field carries information (in the form of
traveling ripples and waves) about the motion of other distant
particles. In this sense, the field is seen as a carrier for the
interaction between these particles.

If you know anything about quantum mechanics and especially quantum
mechanics applied to simple systems such as the harmonic oscillator, you
should know that the energy levels of on oscillator are quantiezed. The
EM field behaves very much like a whole bunch of separate oscillators,
one for each frequency. So the quantum states of the EM field (or rather
of each separate frequency) are also quantized. These quanta are called
photons. Just as the motion of classical particles excites various wave
forms of the EM field, the motion of quantum particles excites various
quantum states of the EM fields. These states contain superpositions of
states with different numbers of photons. Each of these states
contributes to the interaction of charged particles with the field, just
as happens with wave forms in the classical case. Again, this induces an
effective interaction between charged particles mediated by the EM
field.

In a certain (well defined, quantitative) way, the interactions between
charged particles can be represented by drawing Feynman diagrams on a
piece of paper. These diagrams may have different numbers of internal
wavy lines (photon lines). The number of lines corresponds to the number
of photons in a quantum state of the EM field contributing to the
interaction. All such states contribute. It's just the ones with the
fewest number of photons contribute the most. Those are the diagrams
you'd see most often. So, the discrete number of internal photon lines
tells us that we are dealing with a quantized EM field. On the other
hand, the effect of the EM field as a force carrier can be pictures
precisely as in the classical case. A certain wave form produced by one
particle influences the motion of another one.

Hope this helps.

It is the only correct point of view. There is no way to observe
virtual particles, and the name was chosen to reflect this.

Observed particles are always onshell, hence massless for photons,
whereas it is an easy exercise that the virtual photon mediating
electromagnetic interaction of two electrons in the tree approximation
is never onshell.

Indeed. Ultimately a particular view may be shown to be correct, but

adopting a particular view as though it is established fact.

Finding answers to such questions is what I would regard as the object
of scientific research. One should not be too restrictive in this kind
of research. It may well be that what is usually meant by the word
"particle" does not correspond to anything in nature. For example, I
think that many people envisage a particle as a classical object which
has a position in space. But we do also discuss particles as quantum
objects. The usual definition of particle must be revised, but it does
not follow from that that no definition is possible.

There I must disagree with you. One should not prejudge the results of
research. If correct definitions are found for terms like "particle" and
the ultraviolet divergence is avoided through the proper use of Wick's
theorem (see Scharf Finite QED), if in addition the Landau Pole is
avoided by a suitable small scale modification to QED (there is more
than one possible, but I use a particularly simple one), and if
critically and most importantly one pays proper heed to Von Neumann,
that quantum superposition is a property of a many valued logic, i.e. it
is a part of a language which one should learn to understand, just as
one needs to learn any language in order to understand what is said in
that language, then it is indeed possible to interpret the wiggly line
as an ontological entity, which one may call a particle, and there is no
need to distinguish this by use of the word virtual. Moreover, Feynman
rules, do give a quantitative treatment. The paper in a Feynman diagram
is another matter. That really does have no physical meaning.

At best this is semantically tautologous and of little worth. At one
time there was no way to observe the far side of the moon. Is it any
more "real" now, simply because we can send a spacecraft to view it? At
worst, it is simply wrong. We can observe the effect of "virtual"
particles, so to suggest they are not real seems a little unreasonable.

Again, that is a matter of semantics and definitional truism. Energy is
an empirical quantity and as such is strictly only meaningful in
measurement. Since it is conserved in measurement, it is possible to
define another quantity with the same value at all times. If you use
that quantity for your definition of mass, then of course you find
particles off mass shell. It is equally possible to define mass so that
particles are always on mass shell, in which case you either sacrifice
conservation of energy in interactions, or you sacrifice vector
properties between measurements. By your own argument, since it is
obviously not possible to observe between measurements, your definition
of energy between measurement is "virtual" and not open to empirical
test.

I don't think this analogon is quite appropriate: the crucial
difference is that the person in the mirror is never going to hit you
i.e. he doesn't have any physical impact whatsoever on the world. The
virtual particle in contrast is supposed to be associated with a very
real and measurable physical force. So in this sense, it appears
somewhat inconsistent to deny the reality of virtual particles.

Anyway, whether real or virtual, there is in my view a conceptual
problem with the idea of field quanta transmitting fundamental forces:
with this model, a fundamental force is effectively reduced to a
macroscopic force due to the interaction of the intermediating field
quanta with the particles, rather than an interaction between the
particles themselves. Not only this, but the concept doesn't actually
achieve what it is supposed to achieve (namely to eliminate the
concept of an action-at-a-distance) because now there is instead to
explain by means of which (very real) force the field quanta transmit
their momentum to the particle. In this respect, the whole concept
seems to be somewhat circular and thus inconsistent.

The very real and measurable physical force can be quite satisfactorily

&gt; Anyway, whether real or virtual, there is in my view a conceptual
&gt; problem with the idea of field quanta transmitting fundamental forces:
&gt; with this model, a fundamental force is effectively reduced to a
&gt; macroscopic force due to the interaction of the intermediating field
&gt; quanta with the particles, rather than an interaction between the
&gt; particles themselves. Not only this, but the concept doesn't actually

&gt; explain by means of which (very real) force the field quanta transmit

&gt; seems to be somewhat circular and thus inconsistent.
">

There's a simple solution to your conceptual problem: do not take the
idea of virtual particles as force carriers too seriously. What you
should take seriously is the fact that particles do not interact
directly (which you call action-at-a-distance), but rather only ineract
locally with a field. In turn (Newton's third law), the field interacts
with the particles, thus carrying information about their motion
(information which travels no faster than light). That's how particles
sense each other. This picture holds both classically and quantum
mechanically, as I explained in a parallel post in this thread.

The partition of momentum between the field and the particles and total
momentum's conservation is a simple consequence of translational
invariance of the theory (Noether's theorem). Since interactions happen
locally, the momentum transfer also happens locally. Again, no
action-at-a-distance necessary and no inconsistency.

Actually, a particle is understood as an excitation of a field.  Each time
there is a field, a real excitation can exist, which is the case of the

virtual in the sense that the excitation doesn't obey the free field

Indeed, since it is a mere word.  By the same token, that we consider real

(physically) differentiates a real (free) particle from a virtual (mediating

that one particle is resting, then the field of the latter would be
stationary but that of the other would be moving, so the force exerted
by the resting on the moving particle would have to be calculated
unretarded (i.e. according to the momentary distance d), but the force
exerted by the moving on the resting particle would correspond to the
'retarded' distance d*(1-v/c) (assuming the particles are moving
apart) (see my web page http://www.physicsmyths.org.uk/retard.htm for
a derivation of this), i.e. Newton's third law would not apply
anymore. This is obviously not acceptable as it would mean that the
total momentum of a closed system would not be constant (which means
for instance a perpetuum mobile would be possible). And of course the
fact that the force would depend on the inertial frame would be
conceptually inconsistent with the notion of 'force' in the first
place.

So far, you've only supported your claim of inconsistency by pointing
out that some metaphors used to explain QFT to a general audience are
not terribly clear or precise. That's not terribly surprising, either,
since it is very hard to present a simple explanation while keeping all
the details that are necessary for consistency. If you look at QFT in
technical detail, then "the whole concept" is quite consistent.

If you have looked at QFT at a technical level, but are still confused
by parts of it, now is your opportunity to ask questions to clear up the
confusion.

The "derivation" on your website is wrong. It assumes that particles
interact with each other directly through some sort of
action-at-a-distance potential. As you point out, "momentary distance"
is frame dependent, which means that it has no place in a relativistic
theory. And, it doesn't. Each particle only interacts with the field it
sees around itself. The field then interacts, again only locally, with
the particles. The dynamical equations for the field ensure that
information about the motion of each particle is propagated to all other
ones. A more in depth discussion of the role of a field in carrying
information about the motion of a particle interacting with it can be
found in the recent thread:

news:1167672276.632364.284210@a3g2000cwd.googlegroups.com
http://groups.google.ca/group/sci.physics.research/browse_frm/thread/...

The thread contains a link to a Java applet visually demonstrating how
the field carries this information.

There is only one field (with dynamical equations of its own), not a
field associated with each particle. The only time when we can consider
the total field composed of a superposition of potentials associated to
individual particles is when the field's equations of motion are linear
(e.g. electromagnetism). This is already not the case for any nonlinear
field theory (phi^4, Yang-Mills, gravity, etc.). Even in the linear
case, the superposition picture is not complete since it does not
account for all possible forms of radation (say, radiation that comes in
from infinity, as opposed to radiation that's produced by accelerated
charges).

Finally, Newton's third law does hold and remarkably well at that.
However, it doesn't hold between particles directly. Rather it holds
for the field-particle pair. In particle mechanics, Newton's third law
states that if system A exerts a force on system B, then system B exerts
an equal and opposite force on system A.

Assuming that the dynamical equations that govern systems A and B come
from a variational principle (a Lagrangiam formulation), this law is a
simple consequence. Namely, from the equations of motion of system A, we
can find its Lagrangian, which contains a term describing its
interaction with system B, call this the A-B term. The same can be done
if the roles of A and B are interchanged, and the B-A term is obtained.
However, since the equations of motion of A and B come jointly from the
same Lagrangian, then the A-B and B-A terms are one and the same. In
this form, Newton's third law can be generalized as follows: if we know
how system A acts on system B, then we know how system B acts on A. Here
A or B are no longer restricted to particle systems, they could also
represent fields.

Consider a particle that feels a force proportional to the gradient of a
field. Then the above exercise tells us that the same particle will act
as a point source for the field, with the previous constant of
proportionality now representing its charge.

Incidentally, Newton's second law is instrumental in showing
conservation of total linear momentum. The above discussion demonstrates
that in a field-particle system, momentum is only transfered locally
from field to particle and vice versa.

No. The force is the expectation of a force operator, and has nothing to
do with virtual particles, except very indirectly. About as much as the

fundamental entities may be described as particles, and in which space-
time is not fundamental, there is no such fundamental realist

Let's take the example of the electromagnetic interaction.  The field is, to

in the Heisenberg representation.  The first quantization is simpler for the

would be m x field if the mass were not 0.  For a field mediating an
interaction, it is a function of the currents of the interacting particles,
and is not 0 as if the mass weren't 0.  The concept of photon is different
from the one of the free case, yet the electromagnetic field is the same
with the same law of motion.

In second quantization, and using a perturbative method, all that is
represented by different processes with different numbers of photons, which
superpose coherently.  It's a mere scripture, where the idea of path dear to
Feynman appears manifestly, but the basic theory is still quantized fields
with interaction terms.

I'm a bit confused as what you mean by the definition of a particle.  If it

by measurement, is it a track in a Wilson chamber, a click in a Geiger

not through a theory?

A particle is never observed directly, just like a virtual particle, that is
only observed through its effect on the interacting particles.  Every
concepts we handle are part of a theory, and without a theory, all what we
observe is only a collection of meaningless events.

I'm confused by your example. Let F denote the Faraday tensor. When
there are no charges present, it obey's Maxwell's equations:

div F = 0,
div *F = 0  (here *F is the Hodge dual tensor).

In the presence of charges it obeys a different equation:

div F = j  (where j is the charge current),
div *F = 0.

These equations work for both in the case when F is a classical field
and when it (as well as j) is a Heisenberg operator in a quantized
theory.

It is true that in the presence of matter j != 0, so the two sets of
equations are not equivalent. But I fail to see where you would insert
the word "virtual" here. That was my question: what mathematical object
in quantum theory do you pin the word "virtual" on?

In fact, almost everything in physics needs a lot of theory to be

A real photon is a free photon.  A virtual photon is a photon mediating an
interaction.  From that it is straightforward that a real particle is one in
a space without particles, that is with second term = 0.  While a virtual
particle is one in space were there is at least two particle, and is emitted
by them, that is with second term != 0.

It seems startling they are so similar, being both a plain electromagnetic
field.  But that is a consequence of decades of use of Feynman's view and
of insisting on their difference.  Feynman's diagrams are but calculational
trick enabling to tackle QFT, nothing more, nothing less.

Let's imagine an accelerator that sends electrons one at a time, and a
coaxial coil around the beam.  The electron in the beam interact with the
ones in the coil by photon exchange (the discussion is the same in principle
if there is only one electron in the coil.)  But an alternative description
is that the moving electron creates a varying (electro)magnetic field that
yields a force on the coil electrons.  That field is quite real, but is made
of virtual photons.

The effect can be measured with a voltmeter at the terminals of the coil,
but the field can also be measured by a Hall probe inside the coil.  Of
course, both methods amount to the same, but the modified motion of the
electrons in the probe creates a field that is subtracted from the initial
field, and the reading of the voltmeter decreases.  What happened is that
the probe intercepted some photons.  Therefore they exist and are
observable, safe that they no longer mediate interaction between the beam
and the coil electrons since they have been absorbed.  Yet, if the photons
were real, they would have the same fate.

On the other hand, if the wave functions of the interacting electrons don't
overlap, there is a region where the current is zero, and the photons are
free.  Are they real or virtual there?  Granted, it's a little confusing,
but we only have to conclude that it isn't that clean cut.

"Virtual" takes all its sense in the case of W or Z exchange, since the
bosons are very short lived.  But that's quite another story.

I don't think so.  My point of view is that a particle isn't defined
(physically) without a theory, and that it is also true for a virtual
particle, hence no conceptual difference.  Of course, what is understood
(theoretically) by particle is necessarily tied to measurements (that's the
essence of physics), but through hypothesis that may or may not lead to
complete agreement with experimental data, that is, textbook physics.

The confusion between reality and theory is widespread.  It is not because a
theory describes correctly reality that the concepts in the theory are real,
they rather are mind tools that proved very fruitful.  Now, some phenomena
exhibit a discrete nature, for instance clicks of a Geiger counter.  That
leads to the idea of particle, in analogy to a macroscopic particle, but not
directly to the necessity of using the particle concept.  In few words, not
to the reality of the particle.

No, because two different formulations are used, one classical and one
quantic.  They both describe the same phenomenon, that's why the loose term
"is made of" is used.

Mathematically, the situation is analogous to a particle in a harmonic
potential well, but at every point in space-time.  The classical formulation
merely says that the particle has an oscillatory motion, which is analogous
to the oscillating field strength. The quantic formulation says that the
state of the particle is expressed as a linear combination of states of well
defined, equidistant (discrete) energy.  For a fields, those states are
multi-photons states, and they span the Fock space.  Like the position of
the particle, the field strength is no longer determined, but there is a
probability law for its value.  The field operator is analogous to the
position operator, the proper values being the possible values of the field
strength.

In the case of the interaction between two free electrons, the field is in
fact described by a superposition of photon states of different energies.

Virtual or real doesn't change the basic theory, be it classical or quantic,
apart from quantic corrections.  It is only linked to the particular

I don't see any conflict here, especially since we are not discussing
classical fields. Everything in QED is mathematically describable in
terms of Fock states and field operators. If you believe that some
objects in QED deserve the name "virtual", then you should spell out

Take a single Feynman diagram in momentum space. Each external leg is

the excitation it is associated with, then that particular leg is said
to be "on shell". If this equality does not hold, this leg is said tobe
"off shell" OR is said to represent a "virtual particle".
Also, if there is an internal line in the diagram, it is
labelled by a 4-momentum, which generically is not on shell. This
internal line is said to represent "virtual particle exchange".

These are the only places where one encounters the term "virtual
particle" in a non-poetic context. Now you know what I mean by this
term. I, however, am still puzzled by how you use it.

On the other hand. I can take a Fock state, take it to be an eigenstate
of the number operator for some kind of excitation, with eigenvalue,
say, n. Then I can point to this state, say |psi&gt; and call this a "state
with n particles". Then I can ask and answer various questions about
these particles.

Q: What's their total momentum?
A: &lt;psi|P|psi&gt;, where P is the total momentum operator.

Q: What is their total angular momentum?
A: &lt;psi|L|psi&gt;, where L is the angular momentum operator.

Q: What is their charge density distribution?
A: &lt;psi|rho|psi&gt;, where rho is the charge density operator.

Q: What is the probability that these particles will decay into
another set of m particles?
A: |&lt;phi|psi&gt;|^2, where |phi&gt; is the state representing the other
set of m particles.

And so on and so forth. Since there is no state associated with the
objects that get the attribute "virtual", I can't answer any of these
questions for them. Simply put, the "virtual" ones are not particles.

It's a mere definition, in a diagram that is but a representation of a
mathematical term, which in turn represents a configuration of fields.
I explained what happen as QED describes it.  There is no fundamental
difference, both can be represented by a quantum field, the difference
is the "state" of that field, in relation to its equation of motion.
Various basis can be used to write it, none of them has a priviledged
status.  The Fock states and the Feynman diagrams are but one of them.

I really don't see why.  If the square of the energy minus square of the
linear momentum isn't zero, the photon is off-shell, then by definition
virtual:
&lt;psi|E|psi&gt;^2 - &lt;psi|P|psi&gt;^2 != 0 &lt;=&gt; the photon is off-shell or
virtual. The Feynman diagrams represent the electrons wave function and
the electromagnetic field as well, therefore their is a state for both.

That description is the classical one.  With quantum fields, a particles
is still an excitation of a field, whatever the value of the observables
of the field.  Mathematically:

&lt;A&gt;(x,t) = &lt;Psi(x,t)|A|Psi(x,t)&gt;
n(x,t) = &lt;Psi(x,t)|a^+(x,t) a(x,t)|Psi(x,t)&gt;

As the Feynman diagrams are for plane waves, the corresponding electron
wave functions fill all the space, and there is a current everywhere so
that the photons are everywhere off-shell.  But in real situation, we
have to take a superposition of them.  Then, contrary to the diagrams,
there may be a region of space where the current is zero.  The
electromagnetic field isn't zero though, and the photons are on-shell
there.  All that means that an on-shell photon can be written as a
coherent superposition of off-shell photons!  That's the case of a
photon from the sun to earth.  So, that idea of "virtual" particle is
unnecessary /enculage de mouche/.

Getting a good insight is a more worthwhile task than nitpicking and
copying out books.  Fed up of that discussion.  I did my homework, do
yours.

insight into whether you actually use the term "virtual" in a way that

They both are basis, but not of the same thing.  The Fock states are a basis
of the quantized fields.  The Feynman diagrams are the basis of the
transition matrix.  Those basis aren't the only ones, QED can be written in
many different mathematical formulations.

It is your psi, and you didn't make it explicit.

Yes, as you psi is an unknown animal, according to the case one or the other
should be taken.  The Fock states are usually written with occupation
numbers, not as a wave function of space-time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

A leg labelled p represent the wave function u.e{ip.x - (m^2-p^2)t} and so
on.  The diagram itself represent a transition coefficient for given
incoming and outcoming plane waves and a given photon occupation number, and
consequently correspond to a given electromagnetic field.  But that's
textbook physics, why do you ask?

No

"Heisenberg states" has no meaning.  You probably mean Heisenberg matrices.
