I make it a point to purchase a copy of MJ Musen-to-Jikken from a
Japanese place in the US every six months or so. The pictures and
schematics are very interesting even to those of us who are not going
to invest an enormous effort (and that's what it would be) to learn
kanji and katakana.

Looking at the practices there the following is all the more
chilling:

(See the last line: &quot;Being, as I have said, a highly intelligent man,
he realized that he had glimpsed for a moment the soul of a great
race. &quot;)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&quot;The most acute of our observers return with one fundamental datum: &quot;The Japanese are so polite that you can never even guess what they are thinking.&quot; They are so polite they speak English to relieve the Americans of the need to acquire even a smattering of colloquial Japanese, although some may learn enough to add a few words to current slang. {note 14} One of the vulgar euphemisms in current use is 'fox,' which designates a young and especially libidinous female, being applied in college circles to the 22% of &quot;co-eds&quot; who, according to a recent survey, are eager to copulate on sight with any presentable male. In Western tradition, the fox is a type of craftiness, not lust, so I conjecture that this use of 'fox' (not, notice, 'vixen') had its source in Japan, where a particularly liberated and lascivious &quot;sporting woman&quot; (asobime) is said to be a werefox or to have been created from the bones of a horse and animated by the fox-goblin; hence many allusions in satirical verse. {end note 14} Some men return with a Japanese religion {note 15} The religion is most commonly the Rinzai sect of Zen, one of the sixty or more varieties of Buddhism that the Japanese have fashioned in their own image out of the Chinese Ch'an, which was a radical Chinese revision of the religion that was fashioned in India out of a travesty of the philosophy of Gautama, the Buddha. The Japanese doctrine is described by Alan W. Watts in The Way of Zen (New York, 1957) as well as any unverifiable belief can be described by a believer.

">

What Westerners see and learn in Japan is strictly limited by the
innate character of the Japanese, who instinctively combine courtesy
with an inner reserve that is foreign to our nature. They keep their
thoughts private, secret, with a mental discipline of which our race
is incapable. I shall give you a good illustration of that basic fact.

When the United States was preparing to start shooting in Korea, a
ranking officer of our Military Intelligence was sent to Japan to
supervise from his headquarters there certain intelligence operations
in Korea. He provided himself with a Japanese mistress from a very
good middle-class family. His cover was some position in the
Quartermaster's Corps, and, of course, he was careful not to let his
concubine know that he had any other military function. She was, in
every way, a perfect mate, who seemed to anticipate his every wish and
desire by some kind of instinct, sometimes when he was scarcely aware
himself of precisely what he wanted.

The young woman's two or three brothers had been officers in the
Japanese army and had been killed in action. Her uncle and aunt had
perished during our fire-bombing of Tokyo, when we destroyed sixteen
square miles of the city and made a million persons homeless after a
hundred thousand had been burned alive, boiled in the canals, or
suffocated by the fire-storm. She and her mother had barely escaped
alive from their burning home. The American tried to discover what his
perfect concubine was really thinking, so, after many months of
conjugal intimacy, he asked her about that American raid on Tokyo. Oh,
yes, she remembered it vividly: she had seen the American planes come
in like celestial butterflies, &quot;silver wings in the moonlight, very
pretty, very pretty!&quot; It was only then that the American, being a
highly intelligent man, realized how she hated him -- hated him with
an implacable -- and noble hatred.

Whether she was watching him for a Japanese intelligence service
(their maid, who did not live in, but came every day, would have made
a perfect messenger), the American never knew, but that did not
matter. Being, as I have said, a highly intelligent man, he realized
that he had glimpsed for a moment the soul of a great race. &quot;&lt;&lt;

I forecast that in the android's paranoid-delusional world view the
Chinks will be next to clog his gunsight.
I was wrong. He centred on another kind of slant eyes.
No &quot;Protocols of the Wise of the Shogunate&quot; as yet. But he read un
updated conspiracy scenario by his culture-icon, one Oliver (his all-
round guru and race expert) about a beautiful mistress who in reality
is a spy for the Nippon conspiracy. &quot;...the American, being a

There you are. This is no Madama Butterfly. :You can't trust those
Japanese mistresses. Yellow peril alert by Oliver and Ludwig.
This tripe absorbs the android's synapsesa so much that he feels
compelled to republish it in an audio forum..
All this would be laughable except that in certain circumstances the
paranoia becomes epidemic and the paranoiacs get into power.
Fortunately for the besieged civilisation paranoia carries with it a
self-destruct gene. Just think; if the  Jewish physicists, such as
Lise Meitner and Fermi remained in thei beloved Germany and Italy the
chief android would get atomic bomb first and the feldwebels in black
and brown shirts would be ruling the world.

Get off the fuckin' cross, bury the dead and move on. Or build a time

Brett,
You are taken in by literary brilliance. Any good whore can convince a
john she loves him. Many of them, particularly in Vegas, have blonde hair
and blue eyes. They are a joy to the eye as I watch them in the McCarran
terminals, and their eyes meet mine with soft adoration. Neither is it true
that a whore cannot love, but as they eye me back, they are all business,
and their hearts are stone.

The way the Japanese behave is the way they behave toward each other.
They understand each other. They aren't required to be demonstrative in the
Western fashion just for you.

Please leave the subject of race out of r.a.o.

It's gone way too far. But consider the single ended triode amp.
Surely we can consider it, with its big glass envelope standing proud
and surrounded by its two nutty friends, (usually octal  drivers, but
at least one constructor built an amp with a 212 and two globe
envelope triodes for drivers) only in a context that is both sexual
and, let's say, nationalistic?

What &quot;literary brilliance&quot; are you talking about? To me this excerpt
from the collected works of Oliver that our local android felt
compelled to republish, (in an audio forum!!!) sounds worthy of &quot;True
Romance&quot;. kind of pulp mag. True, in this case the pulp is enriched
by the racist twist.. That advances it from pulp to  kitsch- it nearly
reaches the literary level of the lamented Julius Streicher &quot;Der
Stuermer:&quot;-porn mixed with pollution by foreign genes.. His admiration
for such &quot;brilliance&quot; should be a red warning light appended to his
audio opinions.

True to type of those educated beyond their intelligence level he
gets  obscene when thwarted.. As a group they are mad, bad and
potentially dangerous..
