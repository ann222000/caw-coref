Whose Freedom…? Whose Country…? -Some thoughts on India at 60

Posted in Memory, India, personal, the other half lives by Anivar

Yesterday Indian Republic marked its 60th anniversary (an average
Indian’s life time) of its independence. yet another Independence Day
for the people of India to openly talk of secession.

About the secession of the Indian state from the citizens it is supposed
to serve.

The secession of Indian politicians from the people they are supposed to
represent.

The secession of the Indian rich from the fate of their fellow Indians.

The secession of India’s educated from the basic values of their own
education (with values replaced by the price of their souls)

The secession of the idea of development from the real needs of the
Indian people leaving only a trail of destruction and displacement.

As Independent India approaches the age of sixty- that magical sum of
five cycles of 12 years each - it is time to tell the truth about our
country.

The truth that six decades after the British departed India is still
ruled like a colonial state that violates the rights of its ’subjects’
with complete contempt whenever it wants.

The truth that so far successive Indian governments have primarily
represented the business and landed elites and never the common citizens
of this country.

The truth that indigenous communities, fisherfolk and Adivasis – the
original people of India- have been victims of a systematic apartheid
practiced by the Indian establishment.

The truth that the Dalits of this country still scavenge the waste of
the upper castes who consume but are not ready to deal with the
consequences of their consumption.

The truth that all Indian regimes since Independence have coveted the
resources of the North East but treated its people as aliens in their
own land.

The truth that Kashmir has become a property dispute between the
establishments of India and Pakistan, neither of whom give a damn for
the lives and rights of the Kashmiris themselves.

The truth that the spirit and essence of India’s democracy – that great
political victory we won as part of the freedom struggle- has been
reduced today to a bland consumerist choice between one brand of
toothpaste and the other.

There was enough official celebrations on this year too, the media
chattered about of India turning a Super Power and our politicians
salivate at the idea of becoming a junior partner of US Imperialism. And
yet behind this pomp, show and false grandeur lie the glaring
contradictions of our country.

The contradiction of a poor, developing nation that wants to send a Man
to the Moon when it can’t even send its children to decent schools.

The contradiction of a budding nuclear power that can make atom bombs
but can’t generate enough electricity to light up its villages.

The contradiction of ‘patriots’ shedding crocodile tears for Mother
India while girl children are killed even before they are born and women
in this country are routinely murdered and raped.

The contradiction of a country that has the largest number of
billionaires in the world outside the US while its impoverished farmers
commit suicide and farm workers starve to death.

The contradiction of a government that allows Coca Cola, sitting in far
away Atlanta, to poison the drinking water of this country while
millions of its citizens are dying of thirst.

The contradiction of the Indian media which is growing in numbers but
shrinking in stature, reduced to peddling trivia, titillation and
shining trinkets sold by global corporations.

I believe the time has come for the people of India to openly talk of
RESISTANCE.

RESISTANCE against the colonial Indian state to restore it as an
instrument at the service of the people of India and make our public
servants behave like servants of the public.

RESISTANCE against the attempt by the Indian government to sell off
public resources to the highest bidders and privatize everything
including the dreams of the Indian people.

RESISTANCE against the takeover of this country by progenies of the East
India Company, the corporate ‘monarchs’ carving their princely kingdoms
from the flesh and blood of the Indian nation.

RESISTANCE against the Brown Sahibs who rule us and are now busy
negotiating the sale of our national sovereignty to foreign powers
paving the way for a recolonisation of India.

A VICTORY for the people of India who refuse to be cheated, exploited
and fooled in perpetuity by their rulers.

As usual Independence day is an occasion of Dreams &amp; expectations too….
But I believe The Independence cannot be achieved without justice, human
dignity, sovereignty, ecological sustenance and genuine democracy.
