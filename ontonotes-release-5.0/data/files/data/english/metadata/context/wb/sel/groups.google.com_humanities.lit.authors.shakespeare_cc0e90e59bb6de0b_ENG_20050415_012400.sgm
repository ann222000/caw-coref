I posted a version of this before, but I thought it might
be helpful to give this updated and improved version a
thread of its own.

See   for the
basic essay, and a far more detailed illustration of the
whole inscription is given as a rather large file at

****

It is my claim that, in the Stratford monument, we have
far more concrete evidence that Christopher Marlowe played
a major part in writing the works of Shakespeare than even
the most ardent 'Marlovians' realise. Furthermore, and
paradoxically, the fact that what is said is 'hidden' even
makes me *more* inclined to accept its veracity than the
truth of some apparently cast-iron direct evidence - the
report of Marlowe's inquest, thought by most recent
biographers to be a pack of lies, being a good example.

It seems to me that there are several stages one should go
through in determining whether or not the hidden meaning I
stumbled upon really was deliberately included in the monu-
ment's inscription. At each stage, the likelihood of it
being a genuine hidden message increases, finishing up by
being as near to certainty as makes no difference at all.

1) By treating one part of the poem, marked out by two
colons, as a rebus it is possible to discover Christ-
opher Marlowe's complete name, and as he himself spelt
it. This is already further than most suggested hidden
messages ever get.

2) Furthermore, by interpreting a few of the other words in
a different - but equally acceptable - way, it is also
possible to get a totally different meaning (no part of
which is redundant) for the epigraph as a whole. This is
hardly ever the case with other alleged hidden messages.

3) Not only does this meaning make at least as much sense
as the original, it is no less grammatical, is coherent,
indicates that it *is* cryptic, and provides a message
which actually says something very relevant in terms of
the authorship controversy. Equally, every part of the
inscription contributes to that meaning. No proposed
authorship 'secret writing' has ever achieved this before.

4) The inscriptions on this and the grave have a surprising
number of strange or unusual features, most - if not all -
of which contribute to the riddle's overall solution (or
its survival!). The following certainly do.

a) Suggesting that someone who is already reading the
epigraph might not be *able* to read it.

b) Splitting the word 'within' into two words, which by
the time the monument was erected was very unusual. In
a large sample of contemporary writing I was able to
find only 3 such cases out of 531 uses of the word.

c) Saying that Shakespeare had been placed 'within' the
*monument* - something that has been found puzzling
by quite a few commentators.

d) The word 'Sieh', an alleged mis-spelling of the sub-
ordinating conjunction 'sith'.

e) The lack of any punctuation before 'Shakspeare', and
the colons (rather than commas) after 'dide' and before
'Sieh'; also the helpful commas either side of 'Far
more' and after 'all'
.
f) The ambiguous, even cryptic, nature of the last line.

g) The selection of Nestor, Socrates and Virgil as meta-
phors, none of whom seems really appropriate for Shake-
speare, but who would fit the situation suggested by
the new meaning very well.

h) Shakespeare's gravestone not having his name upon it.

i) The grave's 'curse', which has apparently succeeded in
keeping it unchanged for nearly 400 years.

5) The fact that each of seven words needing re-interpretation
in solving the riddle is 'flagged' by being given a wrong-
sized initial capital letter; and the chance of this
happening by accident being less than one in a thousand
million! That is the big one.

Taken all together, however, it is these reasons which
convince me that the poem on the monument was intentionally
cryptic and actually means, if not precisely the following,
something very similar to it:

&quot;Pause, traveller. Why go by so quickly? Work out, if you can,
whom envious Death has placed in this monument WITH Shake-
speare (with whom quick - i.e. not thought 'dead' - Nature
died): Christopher Marlowe. He is returned, everybody! That
HE did the writing leaves Art still alive, without a page
to dish up his wit.&quot;

EPITAPH FOR RICHARD TARLTON, PRINCE OF CLOWNS
dling/1eng.html#1

&quot;You wish to learn, TRAVELLER, whose is this uninscribed tomb? Stop,
stay your step a little while, you'll learn his unknown name. In this
grave lies Tarlton, the prince of clowns produced by England's soil.
With him dead, the spurned Muses of comedy and tragedy are silent
in confusion. Mutely they long for their glory of the stage, and
sardonic Laughter is gone. Here is buried the British Roscius,
than whom none was better known.
Depart, TRAVELLER. If his name still eludes you, any boy can tell you.&quot;

but I opened my doors to the TRAVELLER.

Book I : CHAP. II. _Joseph Andrews_ by Henry Fielding

MR. Joseph Andrews, the Hero of our ensuing History, was esteemed
to be the only Son of Gaffar and Gammer Andrews, and Brother to the
illustrious Pamela, whose Virtue is at present so famous. As to his
Ancestors, we have searched with great Diligence, but little Success:
being unable to trace them farther than his Great Grandfather, who, as
an elderly Person in the Parish remembers to have heard his Father say,
was an excellent Cudgel-player. Whether he had any Ancestors
before this, we must leave to the Opinion of our curious Reader,
finding nothing of sufficient Certainty to relie on.
However, we cannot omit inserting an Epitaph
which an ingenious Friend of ours hath communicated.

Stay TRAVELLER, for underneath this Pew
Lies fast asleep that merry Man Andrew;
When the last Day's great Sun shall gild the Skies,
Then he shall from his Tomb get up and rise.
Be merry while thou can'st: for surely thou
Shall shortly be as sad as he is now.

&lt;&lt;The Blount dedication shows Thorpe's efforts to be witty and
entertaining, at least by Elizabethan standards, and actually it is
quite funny. &quot;Blount, I purpose to be blunt with you,&quot; and so on, while
the dedication to Pembroke (below) is full of sophisticated word-play
of the most excruciating kind, witty and tedious, totally different from
the Dedication to the Sonnets. &quot;Most-conceited&quot; is contrasted with
&quot;almost-concealed&quot;; Viraginia with Virginia--very skilful word play;
Utopia versus Eutopia-- there's a subtle difference which
I had to look up. Both these dedications are so different

I have a question or two about the monument, and I apologize if these
have already been asked years ago.

Is it normal for monuments of that time to have some letters
capitalized and some not? For example, the one given on Tarlton also
has some letters capitalized for apparently no reason. I'm looking at
various title pages of Shakespeare plays, and they occasionally seem to
have words capitalized for no reason that I know of.

Would it be expected that the first letter of each line would be
capitalized? You imply that, but is it true on other monuments?

To uncapitalize first letters of lines and then capitalize other first
letters seems a bit eccentric to me--if I were devising a puzzle, that
wouldn't be the first thing that would come to mind. It seems far out.
Are there other instances of such puzzles?

Your explanation of &quot;He&quot; seems stretched. You say that the last person
mentioned is Christofer Marley, so the word &quot;He&quot; must be referring to
him, but you're the one who said that the last person mentioned is
Marley, so it seems that you're using your previous guess to support
this one; however, the previous guess might be incorrect.

&quot;And the odds against such a match occurring by chance are over a
thousand million to one.&quot; Do you have a mathematical derivation of
that? You ought to publish that as well; otherwise it just sounds like
you're throwing probabilities around. Just because some of us might not
understand it doesn't mean that others won't.

Your solution is quite ingenious, but perhaps it is too ingenious(?)

(Tom Reedy to Peter Farey, March 10, 2005)
Bob simply

told us that you can prove nothing withstatistics, leaving
unconsidered the matter of whether probability theory has
any place at all in decision-making.

Bob is wrong. You can prove everything with statistics if you know how
to use them. But probabilities -- especially of the type that you and
Art use to lend credence to your theories -- aren't statistics.
-----------------------------

(Peter Farey to Tom Reedy, March 11, 2005)
Please allow me to explain why I said that your
statement to Bob that it was &quot;about as impressive
as figuring the odds against your name being Bob
Grumman instead of the millions of other names that
are in use&quot; showed that you didn't understand my
argument. I'll use a typical textbook-type example.

We put 70 balls marked from 1 to 70 into a bag,
from which I ask you to pick 7 at random, without
looking. You happen to pick numbers 21, 30, 37,
45, 50, 53 and 68. What are the odds against you
picking that particular combination? 1,198,774,720
to 1. Is it in any way surprising that you picked
those numbers though? No, of course not, because
the same odds would have applied whichever of the
1,198,774,720 possible combinations you'd chosen.

Now, however, we put those balls back, mix them up
thoroughly, and you again pick 7. You get exactly
the same 7 balls as you did the first time. What
are the odds against you picking that particualar
combination? Still 1,198,774,720 to 1. Is it in
any way surprising that you picked exactly the
same combination a second time? Too right it is!
This time there was only *one* of the 1,198,774,720
possible combinations you could have chosen which
matched the first lot.

The odds I quote in support of the validity of the
riddle is, I claim, analogous to the second of these
situations, whereas the argument you gave against it
was analogous to the first.

I need to spell this out a little.

Assumptions (that I can think of):
1) Only 7 of the words have clues, and they are valid clues.
2) The 7 clues relate to Marlowe and not to anyone or anything else.
3) The 7 words with the weird caps don't have weird caps for other
reasons.
4) The caps were really meant to be weird.
5) The words are equally weighted.

So, given that 7 words with clues have been found, and 7 words with
weird caps have been found, what is the probability that the words with
the clues are the same as the words with the weird caps in a 70-word
text? (Only about ~50 words on the monument--is it ok to use the other
words?)

The reasoning was to take 2 samples from the text(urn) of 70 words.
First take out 7 words, put them back in the urn, then take out 7 more.

The probability we are looking for is the (# of combos where the 7
words match) divided by the total # of combos. My book says that for
this kind of probability, you can use either unordered or ordered
samples, and it looks like unordered was used.

So we have 1/(70 choose 7) = 1/ 1,198,774,720

Even if that is correct, I still think the assumptions are too big.

1/(50 choose 7) = 1/ 99,884,400, if I did it right.

No problem. I'd like people to understand my case,

The Stratford monument is all in capitals, of course, so
I will assume you are referring to the larger ones as
'capitals'. My detailed reasons for claiming that some
of existing capitals (or lack of them) on the monument
are 'unusual' are given in my essay's appendix at
On the other
hand, none of the clues should look *too* unusual,
should they?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/>

Not necessarily. The poem on the grave itself has two
lines which start with smaller caps, for example. There
is some pattern to these, however, where there is no
pattern to the ones on the monument. The point is, though.
that (with the exception of Dugdale, who retained the
lower cap for 'within') every single transcript that I
have seen which has shown different sizes at all has
given 'read', 'with' and 'quick' larger initial capitals.

My assumption is that such a clue would be based upon
what people would take to be the norm for written verse
of any kind, not just as it might appear on monuments.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Using the first thing that came to mind would, in my view,
make it a rather unsatisfactory puzzle.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Not that I know of, although some 'eteostics', as referred
to by Ben Jonson, were based upon letters being of a diff-
erent size to the rest. This is all rather irrelevant,
though. It is usually better for the key or clue to any
cryptic writing *not* to have been used before.

Certainly. If it had said &quot;Edward de Vere&quot;, that is who the
&quot;He&quot; would have referred to. It's not a question of who it
*does* refer to, therefore, but to whom it *doesn't* -
i.e. Shakespeare.

It was not a &quot;guess&quot;, of course. It was the only solution
that I could find.which satisfied all three parts of the clue.

A fair point. It's 1 in n!/(x!*(n-x)!), where n is the
total population of words (70) and x is the number of
selected items (7)

Not quite. There are seven words which have the clue's

any others, and there are seven words which, given a new

Large probabilities as to the 'chance' of something happening don't
really mean any thing at all- statistically improbable things happen all
the time for instance:

&quot;The argument from probability that life could not form by natural
processes but must have been created is sometimes acknowledged by
evolutionists as a strong argument. The probability of the chance
formation of a hypothetical functional ‘simple’ cell, given all the
ingredients, is acknowledged to be worse than 1 in 10 to the pwr 57800.
This is a chance of 1 in a number with 57,800 zeros. It would take 11
full pages of magazine type to print this number. To try to put this in
perspective, there are about 1080 (a number with 80 zeros) electrons in
the universe. Even if every electron in our universe were another
universe the same size as ours that would ‘only’ amount to 10160
electrons.&quot; ( )

When statistics can be used to prove something usefully (beyond
reasonable doubt say- although there may be some contention between
realism and instrumentalism) is under strict scientific methodology
where a hypothesis can be tested, variables controlled, conclusions
drawn and the experiment repeated by independent persons.

To say a result is statistically significant is just to say that the
result is *unlikely* to have been a random occureance. An unlikely event
is one that has a probability of occurence less than .05 (or .01).

For instance: A drug said to alleviate blood pressure is adminsitered to
two groups of patients. One group (A) gets the real drug. The other
group (B) gets a placebo (control).

If the drop in blood pressure in the patients administered the actual
drug is statistically significant (less than .05) and the group
administred the placebo records no significant change in blood pressure
(&gt;.05) then it is considered that the drop in blood pressure is more
likely to have been caused by the drug and not due just to some random
event.

This experiment cna be repeated with a different group of patients and
the same result should be achieved.

I'm not sure what you mean here by hard evidence or what you mean by proof.

I think that *all evidence* is probablistic, that we can never know

evidence but that is as far as 'proof' goes.

Responding from Nigel's kill-file, I must protest. This
is simply not true.

What I have done is to discover, initially quite by
chance, that it's *possible* to interpret the words of
the epigraph in a second way that is very different to
the way in which it is (presumably) meant to be inter-
preted. Included within this 'hidden' version are two
rebuses which, together, give the words 'Christofer
Marley: he is returned'.

I subsequently discovered, mainly thanks to Terry,
that there was a clue to arriving at the full solution,
and that the probability of this clue having arisen by
chance was exceedingly low. Add to this the existence
of several unusual features of the epigraph, all of which
were important in reaching the apparent solution, and
one could in fact state with a level of confidence
verging on certainty that the hidden meaning I had
found must have been put there deliberately.

It is therefore my claim that in the monument, whilst it
proves nothing, we do in fact have concrete evidence
apparently supporting the idea that Marlowe played a
major part in writing the works of Shakespeare.

That is all I have claimed. I have not sought to 'rebut'
anything, only to add to the body of evidence there is
which really should be taken into account in reaching
any conclusion as to the truth of the current belief in
Shakespeare's authorship. I have in fact even suggested
a way in which this hidden message might be accomm-
odated within a Stratfordian paradigm.

Neither of us has the slightest idea of what these

is in fact true, and our *subjective* judgement on this
will undoubtedly depend to a certain extent upon how far
we are prepared to give credence to what the monument
apparently says.

A conclusion which takes account of *both* of them is the
one I would go for. Meanwhile I really would like to know
where specifically I go wrong in my thinking on this -
yet another ex cathedra repetition of the belief that I
*must* be wrong is really of no help at all.

change in the social atmosphere, where G.W.
Bush and the Pope are triumphant beyond their

to piano legs. What happens to the works of
that writer? If he was socially prominent (like,
say, Oscar Wilde) what happens to his
reputation?

This is far from a perfect analogy, since the
writer of whom we are talking could see the
beginnings of that change, and was mostly
careful to write ways that concealed nearly
all his meaning from the ignorant masses,
while entertaining the knowledgeable few.
Much of their delight in this form of writing
was, in fact, their shared awareness of the
hidden nature of these meanings, and their
amusement at the ignorance and confusion
of the masses, who could sometimes vaguely
sense that something was going on, but

What does Dante say of it?

Because I seek an image, not a book.
Those men that in their writings are most wise
Own nothing but their blind, stupified hearts.
I call to the mysterious one who yet
Shall walk the wet sands by the edge of the stream
And look most like me, being indeed my double,
And prove of all imaginable things
The most unlike, being an anti-self,
And standing by these characters disclose
All that I seek...

&gt;&gt;&gt;Probably a fair number did notice,
&gt;&gt;&gt;(or were inside the 'loop') but were
&gt;&gt;&gt;obliged not to discuss it much.

&gt;&gt;And any human being &quot;obliged&quot; not to spill the beans
&gt;&gt;could be expected not to? Preposterous.

&gt; What would they have done?
&gt; Taken their story to the 'Daily Bugle'?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2 that left no direct evidence of ever having existed;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Government-mounted cover-ups don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;usually leave direct evidence. We believe
&gt;&gt;&gt;that the Medicis, Borgias, and most
&gt;&gt;&gt;European monarchs and popes pursued
&gt;&gt;&gt;all sorts of policies in respect of which
&gt;&gt;&gt;they left little or no direct evidence.

&gt;&gt;I doubt that any government cover-up has much in common with the one
&gt;&gt;you envisage concerning who wrote Shakespeare's plays.

&gt; Any account of Shakespeare and his
&gt; literature will be remarkable, and indeed
&gt; necessarily unique in the history of the
&gt; world. You claim that it resulted entirely
&gt; from a remarkable 'combination of genes'
&gt; (on which no one happened to comment
&gt; at the time) and for which we have not
&gt; the beginnings of a parallel among the
&gt; billions of human births recorded.

&gt; It's a matter of finding the most sensible
&gt; explanation for some very strange
&gt; phenomena -- and then seeing if that is
&gt; supported by the rest of the data.

&gt;&gt;Could you give
&gt;&gt;me a hypothetical example. What I'm getting at is, sure,
&gt;&gt;a government could have some troublemaker poisoned
&gt;&gt;and keep people from finding out who did it, but that's
&gt;&gt;simply a matter of using an agent to do something
&gt;&gt;quickly, unseen by anyone else, not a matter of someone
&gt;&gt;pretending to write plays for twenty or more years, and
&gt;&gt;acting in them, etc.

&gt; No one pretended to write the plays for
&gt; twenty years of more. (In fact, the stooge
&gt; just kept out of sight.) Nor did anyone of
&gt; that name act in the plays. That is all no
&gt; more than Stratfordian imagination at work.

&gt;&gt;Another difference is that we know the kinds of
&gt;&gt;surreptitious things governments have done, but we
&gt;&gt;don't know of a government carrying out an Oxfordianist
&gt;&gt;conspiracy.

&gt; True. And there is nothing like it in the
&gt; history of literature -- and the truth is an
&gt; extraordinary story. But it is a better than
&gt; a made-up one that relies on 'genes', and
&gt; on vast gaps in the record.

&gt;&gt;Ah, the unschooled daVinci wasn't actually a painter?

&gt; Who says Da Vinci was unschooled?
&gt; (An extremely unlikely story.) But
&gt; why seek a conspiracy there?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;3. That fooled the greatest minds of the age

&gt;&gt;&gt;No. They were in on the plot. Only the
&gt;&gt;&gt;lesser minds were outside.

&gt;&gt;I love this, Paul. How did the wacks running this
&gt;&gt;conspiracy identify the lesser minds and keep them outside?

&gt; Great minds don't grow up unseen. They
&gt; need education and much else. When
&gt; there very few channels of education, it is
&gt; very easy to identify the 'great minds'.

&gt;&gt;Another question: why did knowledge of this conspiracy
&gt;&gt;die out--or, why was it not passed on since Oxford was
&gt;&gt;known to have wanted to be remembered.

&gt; Imagine a great writer today, who was as
&gt; explicit as Henry Miller. Then imagine a drastic
&gt; change in the social atmosphere, where G.W.
&gt; Bush and the Pope are triumphant beyond their
&gt; wildest dreams, and it becomes impolite to refer
&gt; to piano legs. What happens to the works of
&gt; that writer? If he was socially prominent (like,
&gt; say, Oscar Wilde) what happens to his
&gt; reputation?

&gt; This is far from a perfect analogy, since the
&gt; writer of whom we are talking could see the
&gt; beginnings of that change, and was mostly
&gt; careful to write ways that concealed nearly
&gt; all his meaning from the ignorant masses,
&gt; while entertaining the knowledgeable few.
&gt; Much of their delight in this form of writing
&gt; was, in fact, their shared awareness of the
&gt; hidden nature of these meanings, and their
&gt; amusement at the ignorance and confusion
&gt; of the masses, who could sometimes vaguely
&gt; sense that something was going on, but
&gt; about which they otherwise had no idea.

&gt; Now, 400 years later, we can, for the first
&gt; time, begin to study his meanings, and
&gt; appreciate the duality and ambiguity in his
&gt; work.

&gt;&gt;If not passed on, why did not later superior minds tumble to it

&gt; You have a strange superstition in 'superior
&gt; minds'. We are all subject to intense social
&gt; pressures and prejudices, and cannot see
&gt; what they prevent us from seeing. Isaac
&gt; Newton may have had a 'superior mind' but
&gt; most of his time was taken up with writings
&gt; on religion, all of which are now quite
&gt; unreadable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Err, how many private notebooks
&gt;&gt;&gt;from the time have you seen? Let me
&gt;&gt;&gt;guess . . . . Zero.

"/>

I was thinking of this page here:

Where for instance we have:

-Edward Alleyn recording a purchase as: &quot;a book shaksper sonnetts 5d&quot;
-Humphrey Dyson who wrote on a quarto title page of Troilus and
Cressida: &quot;Written by William Shakespeare &amp; printed amongest his workes&quot;
-William Drummond, hand written on RJ title page: &quot;Wil. Sha.&quot;
-Robert Burton's. V&amp;A title page hand written: &quot;by Wil. Shakespeare.&quot;
-John Rous, list of titles: &quot;Venus and Adonis by Wm Shakespear Lond.
1602&quot; and &quot;The rape of Lucrece by Wm Shakespear Imp{er}fet&quot;
-Sir John Harington, lists of play quartos from his personal collection
including: &quot;K. Leir of Shakspear&quot; and &quot;King Leyr. W. Sh.&quot;

Some of which are more like private notes than 'notebooks' perhaps...
but the point remains that none of these men credited the plays to
anyone other than Shakespeare/shaksper/Wil. Sha/Wil. Shakespeare/Wm
Shakespear/Shakspear/W. Sh... all of which makes a mockery of the
oxfordians attempt to distinguish between shakespeare (the true author)
and shaksper (the actor)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Err, we have a private notebook of Jonson's

&gt; Which, it is clear, he expected to be published.
&gt; He would not have included matter in it which

&gt;&gt;and at least one from Bacon.

&gt; Which he expected to be read after his death.

&gt;&gt;We have all kinds of
&gt;&gt;equivalents of them, like Harvey's note about Hamlet.

&gt; Oxfordians maintain that there are plenty
&gt; of such 'notes' -- which, of their nature,
&gt; could not be explicit statements of the facts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Farey's theories are irrational.

&gt;&gt;Why?

&gt; For one reason, he can't defend them in
&gt; detail in the face of any serious challenge.
&gt; For another, he has no overall theory or
&gt; theme. He's a Marlite, who &quot;believes in
&gt; Marlowe&quot; from sentiment. He saw his
&gt; picture on the wall of his school, and that's
&gt; about the sum of his 'system of belief'. All
&gt; Marlites are much the same. Scratch the
&gt; surface and you have found the bottom.

&gt;&gt; Just as you have looked over your own theories
&gt;&gt;and judged them correct, he has looked over his and
&gt;&gt;judged them correct. How are you ahead of him?

&gt; You have this great problem about how
&gt; 'objective truth' is established. But, don't
&gt; worry your little head too much about it.
&gt; Just accept that it is -- by-and-large.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Why not have the greatest writer of all time
&gt;&gt;&gt;be born into, and brought up by, a family
&gt;&gt;&gt;of illiterates? How can that be a problem,
&gt;&gt;&gt;when there's not a single author of any

&gt;&gt;Because, if anyone were stupid enough to accept your
&gt;&gt;lies about Shakespeare and other authors, creativity
&gt;&gt;depends on genes, not environment?

&gt; That must be why every large coal-mine
&gt; and factory has always produced as

vinciolators believe, would have just as much reason to find a

I would say the only reason they didn't is because the extra century
Leonardo had to be confirmed as who he was was enough to keep him from

knowledge of this conspiracy die out--or, why was it not passed on
since Oxford was known to have wanted to be remembered. Horatio said
so! Or was it passed on, as some wacks believe. If not passed on, why

did not later superior minds tumble to it--until Delia Bacon, John
Looney and Charlton Ogburn--none of whom did anything indicating a

only those believing their nonsense indicated a superior mind?

No, Reedy. The difference between me

you cannot be said to have minds -- not
in any real sense. You can only repeat
what you have been told -- often from
school. (In forums like this you actually
believe that Ross and Kathman have
some idea of what they are talking about.)
Grumman falsely thinks he has a mind, so
when he encounters (usually at third or
fourth-hand) those who he believes can
think (and whom he is persuaded are
'acceptable' or, at least, not heretical) he
thinks that they must have 'great minds'.
Insofar as he is on the right lines at all,
the difference is usually that they just
have minds.

Near-proof that would not is the fact that you won't accept the
overwhelming evidence that Shakespeare was an actor: named by Jonson as
acting in two of his plays; testified to by Heminges and Condell who
knew him; testified to by Digges who spoke of the actors as his
fellows; testified (posthumously, but some people accept that kind of
evidence) directly to by Cuthbert Burbage, who knew him, in a legal
document; testified to by two or more poems composed in his lifetime by
others; indicated by his gift in his will of ring-money to his
&quot;fellowes,&quot; three actors; testified to by the authors of the Parnassus
plays, who had a character describe him as an actor; testified to by
two court records concerning the cloth given the King's Men; testified
to by a document from the Herald's office which describes him not as an
actor but as THE actor Shakespeare--in a document to identifies him as
the Stratford man; named on various documents in the company of
theatrical people like Burbage. Just what evidence of his having been
an actor does he lack? Even the anecdotal evidence makes him an actor.

&gt; No problem. I'd like people to understand my case,
&gt; even if they don't accept it.

&gt;&gt; Is it normal for monuments of that time to have some
&gt;&gt; letters capitalized and some not? For example, the
&gt;&gt; one given on Tarlton also has some letters capitalized
&gt;&gt; for apparently no reason. I'm looking at various title
&gt;&gt; pages of Shakespeare plays, and they occasionally seem
&gt;&gt; to have words capitalized for no reason that I know of.

&gt; The Stratford monument is all in capitals, of course, so
&gt; I will assume you are referring to the larger ones as
&gt; 'capitals'. My detailed reasons for claiming that some
&gt; of existing capitals (or lack of them) on the monument
&gt; are 'unusual' are given in my essay's appendix at
&gt; http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/epi_1.htm  On the other
&gt; hand, none of the clues should look *too* unusual,
&gt; should they?

"/>

Yes, I was assuming that the larger ones were capitals.
I'd have to spend some time looking at your other
document.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Would it be expected that the first letter of each line
&gt;&gt; would be capitalized? You imply that, but is it true on
&gt;&gt; other monuments?

&gt; Not necessarily. The poem on the grave itself has two
&gt; lines which start with smaller caps, for example. There
&gt; is some pattern to these, however, where there is no
&gt; pattern to the ones on the monument. The point is, though.
&gt; that (with the exception of Dugdale, who retained the
&gt; lower cap for 'within') every single transcript that I
&gt; have seen which has shown different sizes at all has
&gt; given 'read', 'with' and 'quick' larger initial capitals.

&gt; My assumption is that such a clue would be based upon
&gt; what people would take to be the norm for written verse
&gt; of any kind, not just as it might appear on monuments.

"/>

I realize that I brought up printed texts, but should we really include
them in comparisons? Isn't written verse subject to the whims of
printers and typesetters, who might have different shortcuts and
conventions than monument engravers (perhaps partly as a result of the
equipment they use)?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; To uncapitalize first letters of lines and then capitalize
&gt;&gt; other first letters seems a bit eccentric to me--

&gt; Precisely.

&gt;&gt; if I were devising a puzzle, that wouldn't be the first
&gt;&gt; thing that would come to mind. It seems far out.

&gt; Using the first thing that came to mind would, in my view,
&gt; make it a rather unsatisfactory puzzle.

&gt;&gt; Are there other instances of such puzzles?

&gt; Not that I know of, although some 'eteostics', as referred
&gt; to by Ben Jonson, were based upon letters being of a diff-
&gt; erent size to the rest. This is all rather irrelevant,
&gt; though. It is usually better for the key or clue to any
&gt; cryptic writing *not* to have been used before.

"/>

I don't know about that. If Jonson did similar puzzles, and you
suspect that Jonson wrote this verse, wouldn't it make sense
that he might have done something similar here? If no one had
ever done such a thing, I would suspect that you were just seeing
it on your own.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Your explanation of &quot;He&quot; seems stretched. You say that
&gt;&gt; the last person mentioned is Christofer Marley, so the
&gt;&gt; word &quot;He&quot; must be referring to him, but you're the one
&gt;&gt; who said that the last person mentioned is Marley, so
&gt;&gt; it seems that you're using your previous guess to support
&gt;&gt; this one; however, the previous guess might be incorrect.

&gt; Certainly. If it had said &quot;Edward de Vere&quot;, that is who the
&gt;&quot;He&quot; would have referred to. It's not a question of who it
&gt; *does* refer to, therefore, but to whom it *doesn't* -
&gt; i.e. Shakespeare.

"/>

If the &quot;far more&quot; anagram really is there, I can see why you associate
the &quot;He&quot; with it. But &quot;far&quot; and &quot;more&quot; are common words, so I'm not
sure it really is there.

Even if there is an anagram, why couldn't the &quot;He&quot; refer to
Shakespeare? Our initial assumption is that it is his grave, after all.
I think you can use one clue to support another clue only to a limited
extent--they should each get an independent analysis as well.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; It was not a &quot;guess&quot;, of course. It was the only solution
&gt; that I could find.which satisfied all three parts of the clue.

&gt;&gt;&quot;And the odds against such a match occurring by chance
&gt;&gt; are over a thousand million to one.&quot; Do you have a math-
&gt;&gt; ematical derivation of that? You ought to publish that
&gt;&gt; as well; otherwise it just sounds like you're throwing
&gt;&gt; probabilities around. Just because some of us might not
&gt;&gt; understand it doesn't mean that others won't.

&gt; A fair point. It's 1 in n!/(x!*(n-x)!), where n is the
&gt; total population of words (70) and x is the number of
&gt; selected items (7)

&gt;&gt; Your solution is quite ingenious, but perhaps it is too
&gt;&gt; ingenious(?)

&gt; I find it extremely ingenious, but the ingenuity was
&gt; entirely the designer's, and none of mine.

&gt; Not quite. There are seven words which have the clue's

&gt; meaning, help to change the *overall* meaning more than

Ah, but it's hard to define terms such as &quot;more than&quot;. Someone
might disagree with you if they find other clues.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; 2) The 7 clues relate to Marlowe and not to anyone or
&gt;&gt; anything else.

&gt; Not really. Only one of the clues, 'Tombe', leads us to
&gt; that name, However, that name then allows us to under-
&gt; stand how reinterpreting some the other words (eg 'quick'
&gt; and 'Sieh') works.

&gt;&gt; 3) The 7 words with the weird caps don't have weird
&gt;&gt; caps for other reasons.

&gt; Right. Otherwise they would presumably not be &quot;weird&quot;.

&gt;&gt; 4) The caps were really meant to be weird.

&gt; This is not really an assumption. It is what is shown
&gt; by the extremely low probability of the two lists
&gt; matching by chance.

"/>

I think it is an assumption--if setting capitals was as haphazard as
spelling seems to have been at that time, the capitals could have been
inadvertantly altered by say a nonchalant or adventurous engraver. I
can see myself being silly in that way.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; 5) The words are equally weighted.

&gt;&gt; So, given that 7 words with clues have been found, and
&gt;&gt; 7 words with weird caps have been found, what is the
&gt;&gt; probability that the words with the clues are the same
&gt;&gt; as the words with the weird caps in a 70-word text?
&gt;&gt; (Only about ~50 words on the monument--is it ok to use
&gt;&gt; the other words?)

&gt; Yes, provided that you are still looking both for words
&gt; with wrong-sized capitals and words requiring a changed
&gt; meaning if it is still to make sense.

&gt;&gt; The reasoning was to take 2 samples from the text(urn)
&gt;&gt; of 70 words. First take out 7 words, put them back in
&gt;&gt; the urn, then take out 7 more.

&gt;&gt; The probability we are looking for is the (# of combos
&gt;&gt; where the 7 words match) divided by the total # of
&gt;&gt; combos. My book says that for this kind of probability,
&gt;&gt; you can use either unordered or ordered samples, and
&gt;&gt; it looks like unordered was used.

&gt; Correct. The order is irrelevant, once you have picked
&gt; out the 'top seven' in each case.

&gt;&gt; So we have 1/(70 choose 7) = 1/ 1,198,774,720

&gt;&gt; Even if that is correct, I still think the assumptions
&gt;&gt; are too big.

&gt;&gt; 1/(50 choose 7) = 1/ 99,884,400, if I did it right.

&gt;&gt; C.

&gt; The *poem* has 52 words, 6 of which are counted
&gt; (read, with, quick, Tombe, Sieh and He), ie 1/20,358,520

&gt; The whole *epigraph* has 70 words, 7 of which are
&gt; counted (as above, plus Ætatis), ie 1/1,198,774,720

"/>

Because the incorrect caps are only on the poem, I'm still not
convinced that you can use all 70 words.

Has anyone compared the curse with the similar reference to bones being
at peace in Marlowe's epitaph for Roger Manwood? It is obviously
noticeable, but I don't recall anyone pointing out the possible
similarity, though they probably have. Was it commonplace to make
reference to the bones of the dead in that way?

Actually, the two poems are not as similar as I had thought. One

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;from the time have you seen? Let me

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;guess . . . . Zero.

&gt;&gt;I was thinking of this page here:
&gt;&gt;http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~ahnelson/witness.html#buc

&gt;&gt;Where for instance we have:

&gt;&gt;-Edward Alleyn recording a purchase as: &quot;a book shaksper sonnetts 5d&quot;
&gt;&gt;-Humphrey Dyson who wrote on a quarto title page of Troilus and
&gt;&gt;Cressida: &quot;Written by William Shakespeare &amp; printed amongest his workes&quot;
&gt;&gt;-William Drummond, hand written on RJ title page: &quot;Wil. Sha.&quot;
&gt;&gt;-Robert Burton's. V&amp;A title page hand written: &quot;by Wil. Shakespeare.&quot;
&gt;&gt;-John Rous, list of titles: &quot;Venus and Adonis by Wm Shakespear Lond.
&gt;&gt;1602&quot; and &quot;The rape of Lucrece by Wm Shakespear Imp{er}fet&quot;
&gt;&gt;-Sir John Harington, lists of play quartos from his personal collection
&gt;&gt;including: &quot;K. Leir of Shakspear&quot; and &quot;King Leyr. W. Sh.&quot;

&gt;&gt;Some of which are more like private notes than 'notebooks' perhaps...
&gt;&gt;but the point remains that none of these men credited the plays to
&gt;&gt;anyone other than Shakespeare/shaksper/Wil. Sha/Wil. Shakespeare/Wm
&gt;&gt;Shakespear/Shakspear/W. Sh...

&gt; These are ridiculous examples. All are
&gt; listing (or are about) books. If you have
&gt; some of Mark Twain's works on your
&gt; shelves, are you going to use that name
&gt; in a list, or the real name of the author
&gt; (even assuming that you know it)?

"/>

The title page of shakespeares sonnets reads:

&quot;Shake-Speares
Sonnets.
Never Before Imprinted.&quot;

Edward Alleyn, on purchasing the sonnets describes his acquisition as:
&quot;a book shaksper sonnetts 5d&quot;

i.e. he specifically attributes the sonnets not to 'shake-spear' the
(supposedly) anonymous author but to 'shaksper' the actor.

Why would Alleyn use the name of the actor to describe the sonnets when
the 'real author' was shake-spear. The only rational answer is that
shaksper and shake-spear were the same person and different spellings
wewre not uncommon.

Alleyn was a favorite of the queen and the foremost actor if his age if
'shakesper' was not the author then it is almost beyond argument that he
would have been in on the hoax.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;all of which makes a mockery of the oxfordians attempt
&gt;&gt;to distinguish between shakespeare (the true author)
&gt;&gt;and shaksper (the actor)

&gt; It's quite probable that none in your
&gt; list were aware of the true authorship
&gt; of the work in question.

&gt; The only mockery here concerns the

"/>

Responding from Nigel's kill-file, I must protest. This
is simply not true.

What I have done is to discover, initially quite by
chance, that it's *possible* to interpret the words of
the epigraph in a second way that is very different to
the way in which it is (presumably) meant to be inter-
preted. Included within this 'hidden' version are two
rebuses which, together, give the words 'Christofer
Marley: he is returned'.

I subsequently discovered, mainly thanks to Terry,
that there was a clue to arriving at the full solution,
and that the probability of this clue having arisen by
chance was exceedingly low. Add to this the existence
of several unusual features of the epigraph, all of which
were important in reaching the apparent solution, and
one could in fact state with a level of confidence
verging on certainty that the hidden meaning I had
found must have been put there deliberately.

It is therefore my claim that in the monument, whilst it
proves nothing, we do in fact have concrete evidence
apparently supporting the idea that Marlowe played a
major part in writing the works of Shakespeare.

That is all I have claimed. I have not sought to 'rebut'
anything, only to add to the body of evidence there is
which really should be taken into account in reaching
any conclusion as to the truth of the current belief in
Shakespeare's authorship. I have in fact even suggested
a way in which this hidden message might be accomm-
odated within a Stratfordian paradigm.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What is the probability of a hoax that: 1. Was so good

&gt; (no private notebook that i have sen attributes the
&gt; works of shakespeare to anyone other than Shakespeare
&gt; himself); etc?. Next to nothing.

Neither of us has the slightest idea of what these
probabilities are, nor of course whether any of them
is in fact true, and our *subjective* judgement on this
will undoubtedly depend to a certain extent upon how far
we are prepared to give credence to what the monument
apparently says.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In any case if we were to accept fareys probability we

&gt; monument being correct.

A conclusion which takes account of *both* of them is the
one I would go for. Meanwhile I really would like to know
where specifically I go wrong in my thinking on this -
yet another ex cathedra repetition of the belief that I
*must* be wrong is really of no help at all.

This 'evidence' dates from 1635, some 25 years

something to do with the theatre.
He did -- but not as you know it, Jim.

The apparent award of the coat-of-arms

Those who would have been expected to solve it would
have seen far more lines of verse in either handwritten

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Are there other instances of such puzzles?

&gt;&gt; Not that I know of, although some 'eteostics', as
&gt;&gt; referred to by Ben Jonson, were based upon letters
&gt;&gt; being of a different size to the rest. This is all
&gt;&gt; rather irrelevant, though. It is usually better for
&gt;&gt; the key or clue to any cryptic writing *not* to have
&gt;&gt; been used before.

&gt; I don't know about that. If Jonson did similar puzzles,
&gt; and you suspect that Jonson wrote this verse, wouldn't
&gt; it make sense that he might have done something similar
&gt; here?

"/>

In this case, since a key is used, those without it were
clearly *not* intended to suspect the existence of a
second meaning. Anything reminding them of a similar
puzzle (especially if the author was known to have used
the method before) would be foolish.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If no one had ever done such a thing, I would suspect

No doubt. And this is why the evidence I gave for my
claiming it to be valid is so important.

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If the &quot;far more&quot; anagram really is there, I can see
&gt; why you associate the &quot;He&quot; with it. But &quot;far&quot; and &quot;more&quot;

"/>

Is there some reason why common words should not be used
in anagrams?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; so I'm not sure it really is there.

"/>

What you need to do is to separate two different things:

1) whether is is possible to obtain a name from the words
&quot;whose name, doth deck this Tombe, Far more, then cost&quot;

2) If so, whether that name was inserted deliberately.

Now there really is no doubt that it is *possible* to
obtain a name if we assume that the 'Tombe' is referring
to the grave, and take the words as a form of rebus. It
is my contention that, given those assumptions, the
answer becomes apparent quite automatically, each part
leading to the next.

It would be unlikely, but nevertheless possible, for this
apparent rebus to have happened accidentally, but as
I explained in my first post on this thread, the rest of
the 'solution', the number of necessary anomalies, and
the existence of that clue to solving it, in effect put
any such 'possibility' out of the question,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Even if there is an anagram, why couldn't the &quot;He&quot; refer
&gt; to Shakespeare? Our initial assumption is that it is his
&gt; grave, after all.

"/>

You're having a laugh, right? We are seeing what happens
*if* the clue is what I suggested it was, i.e. that the word
'He' would *not* have the meaning it is usually given.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think you can use one clue to support another clue only
&gt; to a limited extent--they should each get an independent
&gt; analysis as well.

"/>

On the contrary. The *only* way you can decide whether
elements of such a word puzzle are correct is from the extent
to which they support each other and lead to one consistent
answer. Of what may be many possible answers each time,
you pick the one that *fits*.

&gt; I think it is an assumption--if setting capitals was as

The word 'AEtatis' has an incorrect cap and is not in

The present state of the Shakspeare monument text is not the original,
which was not in caps, but upper and lower case as in many other
inscriptions that Dugdale set down for his Antiquities of Warwickshire,
1656. If Farey (who lives in Warwickshire?)can show that Dugdale was
ever wrong about his upper and lower case transcriptions, he could
then go on to make his cipher discoveries, which are worthless without
this investigation.

Re. the following:

characteristic (a wrong-sized initial capital) more than
any others, and there are seven words which, given a new
meaning, help to change the *overall* meaning more than
any others. The seven words turn out to be the same ones
in each case.

Comment:

I printed out Peter's paper this morning and, since there are many ways
to skin a cat, checked to see whether the Cipher Sum of the seven words
in question might add a THIRD reason for concluding that they were
MEANT to aid in the riddle's solution.

Read = 1347
With = 3622
Qvick = 3042
Tombe = 2469
Sieh = 1925
He = 604
Ætatis = 3541 = 16550

For one familiar with the imagery of Shakespeare Myth, this Cipher Sum
is immediately suggestive of the theme that, in number form, runs as
follows: 1000 + 4000 + 9550 = 16550.

In translation: The Compleat Gentelman, 9550, is the product of Light
of the World, 1000, become Flaming Sword, 4000.

In the 'vocabulary' of Shakespeare Myth, Before and After scenarios are
represented by the Cipher Sums 3394 + 1 + 1654 + 345 + 11156 = 16550,
and 3331 + 7 + 5322 + 4000 + 3890 = 16550, respectively.

In translation, the Before scenario reads: Jesus, 3394, is Monad/God,
1, incarnate as ION, 1654, alias Intuition in the Psyche, 345, of
Mircrocosmic MAN-Beast alias 'Christopher Marlow', 11156, in Thomas
Thorpe's spelling of the name.

The After scenario reads: Jesus is WILL, 3331, at the level of
Microcosmic MAN-Beast of Seventh Day, 7, alias Gulielmus, 5322, whose
Flaming Sword, 4000, is the Christ, 3890.

A fourth coherent story line is mirrored in the Cipher Sum 7128 + 9322
+ 100 = 16550.

Translation: In The Beginning, God said Let there be light, 7128, and
there was William Shakespeare, 9322, at The End, 100.

While this is already plenty, it would seem that the Cipher Value of
the Seven Words, 16550, is rooted in some ancient imagery which I have
yet to identify - for it mirrors an allusion to The Second Coming in
13th century Saga Myth which reads as follows:

Snorri Sturluson í annat sinn, 16450 - Icelandic for &quot;Snorri Sturluson
a second time.&quot;

That would mark The End, 100, of Myth as in 16450 + 100 = 16550.

As noted before, Snorri Sturluson placed the Saga-Shakespeare Cipher
Key on record in enciphered form some 770 years ago where I chanced
upon and deciphered it some 30 years ago.

Compounded by the odds against two independent means of analysis -
Peter's and mine - entailing analogous and mutually reinforcing
conclusions, I submit that we are now looking at truly astronomical
odds against the Monument's Riddle NOT being a valid one.

As you say, &quot;In effect, the two form one letter&quot;, and the point
is that this 'letter' is, for no apparent reason, shown as larger
than any of the others in that bit of the inscription. The way
I put it in   is:

In this part of the inscription we can see that *Ætatis*
has a wrong-sized initial capital too, so it may well be
intended to give us a seventh word. If larger initial
capitals were to be used at all in this bit, then *obiit*,
*domini* and *aprilis* should have them, not *Ætatis*.
And if larger initial capitals were not to be used in
this bit, then *Ætatis* should still not have one.

The *validity* of the riddle has nothing whatever to do
with precisely when the version of the epigraph that I
used was created. It would still be as valid if it had
been specially designed by Halliwell-Phillipps for the
edition of his book in which it first appeared. What
this would affect, however, would be the probable
*truth* of what the hidden message says.

Personally, I am prepared to trust him that this was a
a genuine reproduction of the inscription as it was in
1896. And since there is no reason whatsoever to assume
that the Weever, Dugdale, and Vertue transcripts were
anything other than inaccurate versions of this same
design and wording, we are entitled to presume that
this is most probably how it was to start with.

That no other version 'works' in the way this one does
is, at least for me, a clear indication that it *is* in fact
the original.

The date shown on the Privy Council's message, June 29, 1587, precedes
the date of the burning of The Globe on June 29, 1613 by 26 years - an
interesting coincience (?) as indicated by the following extract from
an old working note of mine:

&quot;Moreover, in Shakespeare 'hidden poetry' on the End-of-the-World
theme, &quot;The Wonderfull Yeare&quot; of the title of Harvey's poem
begins on June 29, 1587 - when Her Majesty's Privy Council took
Marlowe's detractors to task - and ends with the burning of The
Globe on June 29, 1613, exactly 26 years later as in the number of
Generations in the mythical Cycle of Moses.

&quot;The myth concerns metamorphosis of Man's Psyche, with Micrcosmic
MAN-Beast of Seventh Day being one with 'The World/Globe' which is
burned to the ground at Cycle's End to make way for Brave New World
alias 'The Compleat Gentelman' as in the title of Henry Peacham's
1622 book which listed Edward Oxenford but not the Stratfordian as poet
of a &quot;golden age&quot;.&quot;

Re:

Does it? The text I give on my website is:

&quot;Whereas it was reported that Christopher Morley was
determined to haue gone beyond the seas to Reames and
there to remaine, Their Lordships thought good to
certefie that he had no such intent, but that in all
his accions he had behaued him selfe orderlie and
discreetlie wherebie he had done her Majestie good
service, &amp; deserued to be rewarded for his fathfull
dealinge: Their Lordships request that the rumor
thereof should be allaied by all possible meanes, and
that he should be furthered in the degree he was to
take this next Commencement: Because it was not her
Majesties pleasure that anie one emploied as he had
been in matters touching the benefitt of his Countrie
should be defamed by those that are ignorant in
th'affaires he went about.&quot;

Comment:

Here is J. Leslie Hotson's text ('The Death of Christopher Marlowe',
1925) - Appendix III in David Rhys Williams' book 'Shakespeare Thy Name
is Marlowe:

&quot;Whereas it was reported that Christopher Marlowe was determined to
have gone beyond the seas to Rheims and there remain, their Lordships
thought good to certify that he behaved himself orderly and discreetly
whereby he had done her Majesty good service, and deserved to be
rewarded for his faithful dealing. Their Lordships request that the
rumour thereof should be allayed by all possible means and that he
should be furthered in the degree he was to take this next
Commencement; because it was not her Majesty's pleasure that anyone
employed as he had been in matters touching the benefit of his country
should be defamed by those ignorant in the affairs he went about.&quot;

The difference between the original text:

&quot;Their Lordships thought good to certefie that he had no such intent,
but that in all his accions he had behaued him selfe orderlie and
discreetlie wherebie he had done her Majestie good service&quot;

and Hotson's text:

&quot;their Lordships thought good to certify that he behaved himself
orderly and discreetly whereby he had done her Majesty good service&quot;

is indicative of what I referred to as editing &quot;by parties unknown for
purposes unknown&quot;.

Well, it was not necessarily your overall point, but
your particular example of this that I was questioning.
This is certainly not Hotson's text, which was in fact
more accurate than my own, as he italicized precisely
where he had expanded any abbreviation.Assuming that
your own transcript of David Rhys Williams's version is
accurate, therefore,it is solely down to him that these
errors appeared, and one ancient Marlovian's transcript
is not quite what I would describe as &quot;the revised text
that is usually cited&quot;!

I stand corrected.

Charles Nicholl's citation of &quot;Hotson, pp. 57-67&quot; in &quot;Notes&quot; at the end
of &quot;The Reckoning&quot; does NOT refer to the Hotson text as cited by David
Rhys Williams.

I bought and read Nicholl's book in 1994 and this citation stuck in my
mind.

P.S. David Rhys Williams reproduces in Appendix VIII an extract from
Thomas Beard's 1597 work &quot;The Theatre of God's Judgements&quot; - &quot;Not
inferior to any of the former in Atheism [through] show its head any
more in the world's eye.&quot;

Do you know if a trustworthy version of the text may be found on the
Internet?

Afraid not, at least not as far as you want.

The site of Monash University (Peter Groves's place of work) at

has the following:

Not inferior to any of the former in Atheisme and impietie,
&amp; equal to al in maner of punishment, was one of our own
nation, of fresh and late memorie, called Marlin [printed
marginal note: Marlowe], by profession a scholler, brought
up from his youth in Universitie of Cambridge, but by
practice a Play-maker, and a Poet of scurrilitie, who by
giving too large a swing to his owne wit, and suffering
his lust to have the full reines, fell (not without just
desert) to that outrage and extreemitie, that hee denied
God, and his sonne Christ, and not onely in word blasphemed
the Trinitie, but also (as it is credibly reported) wrote
bookes against it, affirming our Saviour to be but a
deceiver, and Moses to be but a conjurer and seducer of
the people, and the holy Bible to be but vaine and idle
stories, and all religion but a device of policie. But see
what a hooke the Lord put in the nostrils of this barking
dogge: so it fell out, that as he purposed to stab one whom
he ought a grudge unto, with his dagger, the other party
perceiving, so avoyded the stroke, that withall catching
hold of his wrest, hee stabbed his owne dagger into his
owne head, in such sort, that notwithstanding all the
meanes of surgerie that could be wrought, hee shortly after
died thereof: the manner of his death being so terrible (for
hee even cursed and blasphemed to his last gaspe, and
together with his breath an oath flew out of his mouth)
that it was not only a manifest signe of God's judgement,
but also an horrible and fearefull terror to all that beheld
him. But herein did the justice of God most notably appeare,
in that hee compelled his owne hand which had written those
blasphemies, to bee the instrument to punish him, and that
in his braine, which had devised the same. (p. 149-150)

The transcript in A. D. Wraight's &quot;In Search of Christopher
Marlowe differs from this in a few particulars, but which
is the more accurate I cannot say.

Thanks Peter - I visited the website five minutes ago and copied the
text, including the title:

The theatre of Gods iudge-ments: wherein is represented the admirable
justice of God against all notorious sinners...

The title's Cipher Value is 51492 and, knowing what to look for, it
took me ca. 5 seconds to determine that it mirrors the Cipher Sum 8477-
1000 + 35662 + 7615 - 3858 = 51492, where

8477 = Christofer Marley (Peter Farey's riddle solution);

- 1000 = Darkness;

35662 = Stratfordian's Houre Vpon The Stage (from the purported COPY of
Holy Trinity Church &quot;records&quot; on the Stratfordian's baptism and burial;

7615 = Get thee hence, Satan (Jesus to The Devil in Matt. 4:10); and

- 3858 = The Devil (3858) gets lost...

... and The Devil's Host, alias Archetypal Stratfordian is set to
become the iCon of Stratfordian Funamentalists.

I see that I left out the date of The Devil's getting lost:

May 30, 1593 as in 3003 + 1593.

The Cipher Sum then reads:

8477 - 1000 + 35662 + 7615 - 3858 + 3003 + 1593 = 51492.
