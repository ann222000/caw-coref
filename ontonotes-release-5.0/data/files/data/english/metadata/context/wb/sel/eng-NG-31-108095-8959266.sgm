I'm saving my nickels for a canoe to fly fish from.  I'm hoping, God-
willing, to be able to buy one over the Winter, or early Spring.  Do
many of you fish from canoes?  I'm thinking a canoe would be a simple
way to get onto the many ponds, rivers and lakes around here, without
the hassle of having to trailer a bigger boat.  My brother-in-law in
Oregon has had a canoe for years, and it sure seems peaceful and
hassle-free.

I'm looking at a 17 footer that is stable, light and capable of being
a tandem OR a solo canoe.  Have any of you had experience (or heard
good or bad) about the Souris River Canoes?  I'm looking at the
&quot;Quetico 17&quot;.  Here's a link to what I'm considering:

http://www.redrockstore.com/quetico17.html

I think this canoe would be great for the places I fish around here in
Central Illinois -- and be easy to take on trips out-of-state.

Let me know if there is something else worth considering in a fly
fishing canoe.  Thanks.

&quot;Years&quot; is the important point.  People already skilled in
handling a canoe can fish from them enjoyably.   Most
experienced anglers new to canoes find them far too
unstable.  The built-in advantages of the canoe (speed,
manoeuvrability, load-carrying capacity) require experienced
piloting and contribute little to fishing comfort or performance.

Before spending your money, you should perhaps compare
other types of man-portable boat that may be slower but more
stable.

Hi Dave,

I flyfish from canoe quite a bit and can easily say the most important
thing I think about when looking at canoes is: How many things are
sticking up. I swear I am never really sure if I'm fishing if there
isn't something tangled up, but fewer tangles are better.

I have been fishing out of a little aluminum type canoe for a while
and like it a lot for my solo excursions. Its VERY light and easy to
handle in a wind. The bottom is wide and flat. I feel very stable with
a foot on each side when I stand. I used to have a long lake style
canoe, but it was too narrow to feel stable when standing.

My 2 cents.

I hate the idea of fishing in a canoe by myself, without another paddler
to keep it in place and oriented in the wind to where I want to cast. I
far prefer a  pontoon boat that I can control with both oars AND fins.
The oars get you to where you want to go and the fins keep you where you
want to be and facing in the direction you want to face.

I've fished in one-man kayaks in the Florida Keys and in Belize. Same
problem. Hated it.

Listen to what Fortenberry sez about canoes.  He knows them well and I
trust his judgement/word.

Old Town makes a canoe specifically for fishing.  Can't recall the
model, but I have friends who swear by it.

All the advice you have been given is good.

In a nutshell, the very things that make a canoe good on the water
(responsive, quick, etc) make them scary to stand and cast in. And if
they turn easily when you paddle, they can twist all around when you
cast. If you have an excellent sense of balance, then you could stand
and cast in almost any canoe...including a whitewater boat with a
curved bottom (tippy), but its far from relaxing.

For the intermediate caster/paddler, then you will need to compromise
somewhere....something flat bottomed (so it won't tilt side to side),
with little rocker (so it won't twist around), fairly long, in the 17
foot range (anything longer is a bear to paddle, anything shorter is
skittish to stand in), and BEAMY (that means wide...makes it more
stable). A flat-bottomed, rockerless, beamy 17 foot boat won't be a
Maserati on the water, but it will satisfy your 'peaceful flycasting'
requirement and still be paddleable.

Look at the WeNoNah website http://tinyurl.com/2p5pyn and look at
their 'Fisherman&quot;. Its made for fishing ONLY, so its properties are a
bit over the top, but notice that its flat lengthwise, flat in cross
section, and beamy as all get out. The Adirondack that Fortenberry
recommended is an excellent choice: it also is flat bottomed with no
rocker and quite beamy. The Boundary Water 17' is another good choice.

I think as long as you avoid boats with rocker greater than 1 or 1.5
inches, keep to boats with as flat a bottom as possible, and ones with
at least a 35 or 36&quot; width, you'll be fine.

Your selection of the Quetico is not bad, but probably right on the
limit as far as rocker, width and length go. I don't know what the
hull shape is, but if its rounded at all, I'd avoid it.

Good luck, WEAR A LIFEJACKET.

I agree with everything except the 17' length. A 17' tandem
is more canoe than I care to paddle solo, I wouldn't buy a
tandem canoe much over 16' for solo paddling/fishing. Souris
River makes nice boats and if you have to have a foreign-made
boat instead of a better quality boat made in Winona, Minnesota
USA then I'd go with the Quetico 16 instead of the Quetico 17.

Do a google search of roff for Fortenberry and Riverman- they've
hashed this out before and I think there are some very detailed posts
floating around.

I used an Old Town Guide, 14'-7&quot;. It is a little too tippy to stand
in, but being tall and top heavy, I tend to move the center of gravity
too far above the water. My wife gets really nervous when I stand up.
I haven't tried it by myself - we usually go together, pack a picnic
lunch and make an excursion rather than just a fishing trip. I find
that a longer rod helps with line control while sitting - I usually
use a 9' nine or a 9' five, though I just got a 10' seven that I think
will work much better than either for largemouth and carp on a lake or
smallmouth on the Lower Delaware. She paddles in the back, I fish or
paddle in the front. It works out well. I have a clamp-on rod holder I
bought from L.L. Bean that I use to troll a streamer when we want to
canoe more than we want to fish. A tan and olive over grizzly olive
half-and-half, say #6 or #8 trolled through a riffle was very
productive this summer on a bright day in low water.

Yeah, I agree that there's some discussion on the 16' vs 17' length to
be had. I find a 16' boat a tad on the crowded side for tandem
tripping, but a 17' is certainly a bit long for a solo boat (although
my first love was a Blue Hole 17A that I put a lot of solo miles on).
I think the OP should put a lot of thought into how much solo vs
tandem paddling he is truly planning to do, and with how much gear.

Probably 75% of the time I'd be tandem.  I wouldn't be hauling much
gear either.  Most of the time (not all, but mostly) I'd be fishing
small ponds, lakes and rivers around here.  There is one larger lake
that I would fish some (Ken it would be Lake Evergreen).  Even on
vacation I wouldn't be tripping, but just fishing during the day. I do
want something light that I can easily carry in to the remote places
that I fish around here.  I &quot;get it&quot; that the canoe would need to be a
very stable design, rather than one with a lot of rocker or one that
is meant for speed -- and not for fishing.  My brother-in-law has a
Wenonah, so I will definitely consider going that route.

YMMV, but Ken's probably right on this one.  Although I've never
fished out of it (not sure why not), I have an Old Town Discovery 174
that's stable as all hell.  It's a barge to paddle, though.

It's a great &quot;family&quot; canoe, and if that's your primary usage or
excuse, it's a fine boat for the money; but as a solo craft, sheesh.
It's too beamy to paddle from amidships; but a bag 'o rocks in the
front seat works great.

Wow.  Never thought a wooden canoe would be that light- 57 pounds.
That's actually lighter than my Wenonah.

But here's another (qualified*) vote for Wenonah's Adirondak.  I sure
like mine.  And it's eggplant color is nearly as nice as that natural
cedar. :-)

*qualified because I've only owned it a few months and have paddled it
but a half-dozen times.  I've never stood to fish in a canoe, but
rather remain kneeling or seated.

Ditto, canoes and kayaks.  Both are abominable platforms to fish from.  Even
with someone else along to paddle, a canoe is still fairly miserable.

Nice boat. Here's the tandem tripper I use for solo paddling
and fishing.

http://www.frappr.com/?a=viewphoto&amp;id;=3381173&amp;pid;=5896861

It's a Kedros Navigator 16. The Navigator 16 is very much like
the Wenonah Adirondack in design except, of course, the layup
is cedar strip instead of glas or royalex.

&gt;&gt;I hate the idea of fishing in a canoe by myself, without another paddler
&gt;&gt;to keep it in place and oriented in the wind to where I want to cast. I
&gt;&gt;far prefer a  pontoon boat that I can control with both oars AND fins. The
&gt;&gt;oars get you to where you want to go and the fins keep you where you want
&gt;&gt;to be and facing in the direction you want to face.

&gt;&gt;I've fished in one-man kayaks in the Florida Keys and in Belize. Same
&gt;&gt;problem. Hated it.

&gt; Ditto, canoes and kayaks.  Both are abominable platforms to fish from.  Even
&gt; with someone else along to paddle, a canoe is still fairly miserable.

&gt; Don't know squat about pontoons.

&gt; Belly boats are great.
">

Pontoon boats have three big advantages over belly boats:

1. You can use the oars to travel much farther distances with much less
effort.

2. You sit up higher, out of the cold water and in a better casting
position.

3. You can carry more stuff (tackle, anchor, lunch, etc.).

The only disadvantage is that they're heavier. You pretty much need road
access to the water.

I use both a pontoon boat for when I have road access and a belly boat
for backcountry fishing.

Let me further qualify- method rather than watercraft- since another
thread evolved into &quot;oh, he was talking about fishing for a different
species than I am.&quot;

I have never once (knowingly) fished for trout from a canoe, nor for
any species in flowing water.  My sole prey when paddling are
largemouth bass and bluegill (and any other topwater feeders, the
stray crappie, etc.) in warmwater ponds.  As far as I'm concerned,
anchoring a comfortable casting distance from some structure in such a
piece of water and slinging a big garish popper to the bucket mouths
is a perfectly fine way to spend a summer afternoon or evening, and
requires neither standing, nor particular stealth, perhaps the root of
its appeal to me.

However a certain lake in beautiful Iron County, Michigan of which I
am inordinately fond, hosts warmwater species as well as brook trout,
and it is my firm intention to target all of them one of these days.

I'm trying to decide on a possible craft. Like you started with, there
are pluses and minuses for all the self propelled craft:

1. Belly boats
+ easy to transport, good for fishing, control with feet,
- need to wear waders and fins, difficult to go any distance, suck in
the wind, cold because you're sitting in the water, not for
running water

2. Pontoons
+ great for fishing, fair for covering distance, control with feet, some
models good for rivers
- need to wear waders and fins, difficult to transport if kept together
PIA to assemble if you break it down, nor good for long distances

3. Canoes
+ great for carrying gear, great for long trips, good speed and easy of
rowing, good for rivers
- mediocre for fly fishing, have to use paddle to control, fairly
difficult to transport

4. Kayak
+ fastest and easiest to go long distance, good in rivers, best
(only?) in ocean
- mediocre for fishing, fairly difficult to transport, have to use
paddle to control

It seems to me that each has places where it is better than the others.

I couple I've been looking at:

Ditto that.  However, I'll disagree with some of what Ken and riverman say.
I *love* my Wenonah Solo+ for flyfishing.  Not a great tandem boat (except
for my sons), but a totally awesome solo boat for flyfishing (I don't try to
stand up).  The narrow beam makes casting to either side easy.  The hull
shape lets the boat roll with your hips.  Great to paddle - fast, stable,
tracks well.

We'd be good paddling partners. I'm 6'3&quot; and 235, but I have varying
bow paddlers. When doing day trips or weekend trips, I use an Explorer
16 (solo or tandem). On longer trips, I like a river with a bit of
whitewater, so I like a shorter boat: 17 or 17'6 is about max. I like
an OT Tripper when I can get ahold of one.

When I guided, of course I tried to keep all perishables out of the
client boats, and also keep their boats light, so I paddled the BH
solo with hundreds of pounds of gear for weeks on end. Not very good
for snappy turns, but I learned to use the currents,and man could I
glide through almost anything while laying on a brace. I also could
use the sharp end of eddy lines to help with turns, etc, so I never
really 'muscled' it around as much as some would think.  In any case,
I got extremely comfortable with a big heavy boat, and anything less
than 16 foot still feels a bit small and skittish to me. I also like
long skis; I'm a bit old school.

All this is past tense, of course. I recently gave away the BH, and my
fleet now consists of a 16' and 14' Explorer (and a Folboat Aleut). I
need to get out in the shorter canoe more, but its racked in Maine and
of course, I'm in HK.

I accept that, and being good at pushing around River Pigs isn't
necessarily Merit Badge material. But I was thinking of what might
work best for the OP: if he's a novice or intermediate canoist, and
interested in standing and casting while having a dry and peaceful
experience, I'd recommend that he lead toward the longer side of the
16'-17' debate. For you and me, the recommendation is quite different.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Wasn't the Blue Hole a whitewater
&gt; boat ?
">

Yeah, BITD (back in the day), it was one of the original ww boats. The
idea was to have a high volume, low-rocker, flat bottomed boat that
would ride up and over big waves. The current trend of course is high
rocker and good flare to knife into big waves and rock through them
while the flare kicks the bow wave aside.

The result is that the BH has a niche in big water...I've run Class
IVs in it (loaded) and come out dry. But there's a difference between
survival boating and playboating. I'm a tripper, not a playboater.

When I was on the Arolik River AK this year, there was an official from
the Alaska F&amp;G that floated by us. He was in a one-man inflatable kayak. I
was pretty impressed as I watched him maneuver the craft with ease through
the fast water with his double paddle. He had great kayaking skills.   He
also carried enough load for himself. He told me it's the best craft he's
even been in.
I asked for all the data,  here is the link:
http://www.alaskaraftandkayak.com/catalog.php?dep=Boats&amp;cat;=Inflatabl...
He actually started 3-days behind us on our 9-day trip.  He passed us and
was scheduled to get to the end 4-days before us. We told him about the fish
we caught, and he told us we did better than most guides that come out here.
Although we had our AK fishing license, he never asked for it. He  was just
out to review the Arolik River.

">

You've been given some good advice thus far.  I'd add/paraphrase that if
the marketing for any canoe you are considering contains the word
&quot;fast(er)&quot; or anything else touting the speed of the boat, it's gonna be
that much less suitable for use as a FFing platform.  Like most of
boating, there ain't no such thing as a free lunch - you want holeshot
from a outboard prop, you're giving up topend, you want more cockpit
room in an X ft. boat, you're taking a smaller house, you want more HP
from a particular diesel, it'll reduce TBOH, etc.  HOWEVER....many
canoes that aren't particularly stable (for FFing or otherwise) can be
made much more so with sponsons, and if the craft is fairly stable &quot;au
natural,&quot; it can be made damned near untippable with them (you can
actually FF standing from a sit_IN_ kayak with a proper set...not my cup
of tea, but...).  They range from permanent types &quot;'glassed&quot; (or
whatever material'ed) on/in to &quot;airbags/tubes&quot; that strap to the side,
with the middle ground being the bolt-on removable type.  I've fished
(FFing and otherwise) from canoes with the permanent type and the &quot;bag&quot;
type and they work.  We have a hard-moulded dink with accessory tubes
that are much like sponsons (they turn it into a sort of quasi RBI) and
the damned thing is just about like a sheet of cork tile with them on -
you can fall down or out and you can swamp it, but you and 5 friends
ain't sinking or flipping it.

That said, if you're looking for (only) a &quot;fishing boat&quot; (platform)
rather than transport, etc., there are lots of choices, including
light(er)weight jonboats, rigid-bottom inflatables, hybrids (ala
&quot;gheenoes&quot;), pirogues, etc. that are probably better choices for pure
fishing (only) platforms than a canoe.  However, what a makes a canoe
effective as longer-distance self-powered transport makes it weaker as a
stable FFing platform and vice-versa - a wide, flat (particularly
stable) bottom on a boat is going to make it harder to paddle/row.  And
many of the options are heavier than a canoe in a similar size.  If you
have a fairly healthy fishing partner or are physically capable of
putting a small jon boat into a pickup, you're pretty much good to go,
but if you plan on nothing but solo'ing and cannot lift 75-plus lbs.
over your head, you'll need to really study your options, canoe or
otherwise.  And a tip on loading a canoe damage-free onto a standard
factory &quot;SUV&quot; - many such racks are not tall enough (from the roof) and
the crossmembers aren't stiff enough to in-line load a canoe from the
rear without the bow scraping the roof, so I'd recommend loading first
with assistance to see what's what.  And I don't care what _anyone_
says, those off-the-shelf foam-block &quot;racks&quot; that fit over the gunwales
aren't worth a bag of wet cowshit...in fact, if it were large enough,
the bag of wet cowshit would probably make a better &quot;rack&quot;...do yourself
and your vehicle a favor and get a real rack.  With the right rack and a
little instruction, a moderately healthy 12 y.o can load a 12-14 ft.
aluminum jonboat onto a tall &quot;SUV&quot; with nary a wince from the owner.

Finally, whatever you decide to get, if you wish the craft to remain
stationary or only move short distances (under 100-200 ft.) while
fishing, use two anchors/anchorpoints.  For example, if you are in a
river and wish to remain in one spot, bring the bow (or if you've
swapped positions, what is the apparent bow) into the current, set a
Danforth off the bow, drift back past the desired spot (how far depends
on depth), drop a river anchor off the stern, and use the bow rode to
reposition.  You can do a similar thing, with one anchor ashore from the
bow relative to the land and one off the stern relative to the land to
hold position and distance off of a bank, island, etc. in lake.
Obviously, if the water has motorized traffic, keep that in mind with
regard to anchorage, rode angle, etc.

Good, lightweight rode is pretty cheap (well under 20 bucks US for a 100
ft. 3/8 if you shop, about 20 bucks if you just go buy it) and if you
can use such techniques, get at least 100 ft. for each anchor.  An
anchor rode has a thimble and the anchor is shackled to the rode - a
length of chain may be needed between the rope and the anchor, depending
on bottom conditions (unless the bottom is particularly abrasive or the
anchorage failing can endanger people or property, you probably don't
need the chain for your purposes).  An anchor rode _is not_ a hunk of
clothesline granny-knotted hard to the anchor eye.  The dirt cheap poly
rope (places like Home Depot and Harbor Freight sell hanks of it for
under $5.00 for 100 ft.) IS NOT ANCHOR ROPE - granted, you're not
anchoring the QE2 in a hurricane, but it's not it's lack of strength
that'll screw you - it'll kink, you've got to take care with knot types,
it's hard to properly coil, it isn't UV resistant, etc., and you'll
generally regret the alleged &quot;savings.&quot;  Lastly, never drop an anchor
unless you have _at hand_ a way to _instantly_ cut the rode - IOW, a 1&quot;
rode and a pair of safety scissors somewhere in the salon can be a
deadly combination...a 3/8&quot; line and a good sheath knife on your belt is
a safe combo.

Remember that boats are subject to not only the &quot;water current&quot; but wind
and wind currents, and while you don't need to know a bunch of ground
tackle theory and application, a general knowledge of basic anchoring
techniques and equipment will serve a fisher in a small boat well.

Hey,
I can stir this pot. One option is to build your own canoe. I've made
several. My favorite for fishing is a 12ft solo that weighs 17#. I can
put it on my shoulder and walk into most any trout pond. There are
several designs available. The one I made is a bit technical as it
involves molding thin sheets(1/8&quot;) of plywood. An alternative method is
to &quot;stitch&quot; panels of Plywood together with wire and then &quot;glue&quot; the
joint with epoxy. Much easier than it sounds. Important for fishing
from a solo boat is an anchoring system to hold your place. Although
I've never used one. The Hobie kayaks feature  underwater fins that
allow you to pedal the boat leaving your hands free to fish. The
drawback of these boats besides expense is weight. Finally the cost of
the boat I built was about $300. If I hadn't made some stupid mistakes
it would have taken me about 2 weeks to build, working on it after
work. Toodles,Frogge.

I don't know much about canoes and kayaks, except I personally find them
uncomfortable. I do use both a belly boat and a pontoon boat (not at the
same time). My preference really is for the pontoon boat. My only
disagreement with the points you and Steve have raised is the part about
assembly. My pontoon boat (Outcast) is held together by six pins, and is
really easy to assemble. It only takes about 10 minutes to inflate the
pontoons. I usually carry it in its four components in the back of my
vehicle., and it is pretty easy to set up at the lake. If I am hiking
in, of course, I take the belly boat.

That looks suspiciously like what is basically a VERY overpriced
pirogue.  FWIW, you can buy pirogue kits and build one in a day or two
for under $200USD or buy one &quot;off the shelf&quot; for $400.00 or less.  I did
notice that the Native Watercraft was offered in recyclable
materials...hell, pirogues have been recycled for years: when you're
tired of patching them, they become crawfish boil platters and when they
become to fragile for that, they become planters....

&gt; I don't know much about canoes and kayaks, except I personally find them
&gt; uncomfortable. I do use both a belly boat and a pontoon boat (not at the
&gt; same time). My preference really is for the pontoon boat. My only
&gt; disagreement with the points you and Steve have raised is the part about
&gt; assembly. My pontoon boat (Outcast) is held together by six pins, and is
&gt; really easy to assemble. It only takes about 10 minutes to inflate the
&gt; pontoons. I usually carry it in its four components in the back of my
&gt; vehicle., and it is pretty easy to set up at the lake. If I am hiking
&gt; in, of course, I take the belly boat.

The only time I've disassembled mine was when I met Willi at Duck Lake,
Nev. (Good trip.) The frame didn't fit assembled into my popup camper.
Once assembled, we carried it around lashed to my front window. Crazy
photo, but I can't find it. Willi?

I normally just throw it into my pickup bed; frame, pontoons, lunch,
tackle, anchor, and all. I fill the pontoons tight at the station before
I leave or the night before.

Pontoons are kick-ass flyfishing boats, as long as you can drive in or
float a stretch. I wouldn't carry mine into backcountry, but I've seen
it done. It's not a pretty sight.

That's the photo. Thanks. BTW, that's my Border Collie, Bee.

Duck Valley (not Duck Lake -- my error) was lots fun. The Indian

You might look into one of these.

http://www.easypacker.com/

If your boat is 9' long or less, this rack is really convenient (watch
the video) I _almost_ bought one. On my call to order one, I questioned
the maker about my 11&quot; Scadden pontoon boat. He said I would have to
deflate the pontoons, and fold them so they wouldn't drag on the ground.
That wasn't something I wanted to do, so I didn't place the order.
Instead, I put a Thule rack on top of my camper shell, and haul the boat
fully assembled.
