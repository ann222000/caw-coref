I have never driven an ss camaro so I have no idea.  I do love the c4
corvette.  I know about all the shortcomings as well.

Anyway, Down and dirty, any driving comparisons between a newer camaro
and a c4 corvette.

My neighbor just pulled up in a 2000 SS and it does look very nice.
Kind of bulky though.

Thanks
Please no flaming.

Owned Both......Camaro Z28...A Good Touring Car...Fast.. Good
Mileage...Feels Heavier than it is...Handles Well..But...Not A Sports
Car..............C4.....Handles Great..Even With The Standard
Suspension.... To Fast To Real Fast (ZR1) ( LT4)...Feels Lighter Than
It Is.....Has A Very Nimble Feel And You Can Really Toss it
Around.....87 To 91 Are Good Buys if you are a good home wrench
guy...Super Clean 95 96 Are Priced Too Close To A 98 99
C5.........Rather Have A C5 For The Tech,....Not The Looks...Buddy Has
A C5 ZO6 and 400 H.P.Is Fun At First But A Bit Much For The Traction
This Chassis Offers....500 H.P. C6 ZO6......Bragging Rights...But The
Best Factory Hot Rod In The World For The Money....No Contest

Drove a 99 SS 6-speed from new for 3 years. Now driven a 99 C-5 6-speed
for the last 2 years.

The biggest difference is the way the SS wallows with it's extra 400lbs &amp;
the way the C-5 scrapes the airdam on a peanut in the road. SS is OK if
you get tire pressures exactly right - Corvette is far more forgiving.
Both my cars had Goodyear F1 GS-D3's.

I had more fun with the SS - Corvette drivers need to go for it a little
more (although the effect of the speeding ticket on my licence, has
definitely been noticed).

If they make a new Camaro (SS), I think I'll be queueing up for one - it
brings out the hooligan in me - although my favourite tire adhesion test
on a freeway interchange in Phoenix - entry at 80 &amp; exit at 95 - I'd be
hard pressed to give that up - WOOHOO ! Now how can I make the exit at 100
? Maybe I'll keep the 'vette after all. Sometimes I just think that
promising to buy the 2008 Camaro is just self defense - against the
impulse to buy a 2007 GT500 - no mama, don't make me buy a Fud. Please, I
bought one once &amp; I came out in a rash ;-)

I drive a '90 ZR1 and it's by far the finest car I've ever owned.
Handling, performance, stopping, looks, the C4 is, IMHO, hands down the
best car made and the best bang for the buck you can buy.
My brother has a 98 SS Camaro. It's a beautiful car. He's modded the LS1
so that it's output is comparable to my LT5.
It's downright FRIGHTENING.
Drop the hammer in my ZR1 and she squats in the back, the horizon
disappears from your field of view, and you go from 0 to speeding ticket
so sweet and so smooth that you almost don't hear the Lotus designed
racing engine howl like the gods of war under the hood.
I've never had the balls to open her up past third gear simply because
when the shift light comes on at the top of third gear, you're going
twice the legal speed limit anywhere in the USA. The truly awesome thing
is that there's three more gears left, AND, it'll get 25mpg on the freeway.
My brother describes his Camaro under acceleration similar to "opening a
big bag of snakes".
And that describes it very well indeed.
You'll need both hands on the steering wheel from the moment the wheels
start spinning and engine torque pulls the ass end of the car to the
right. When the tires finally grab, it snaps to the left and wants to
continue in that direction. If you should be foolhardy enough to tap the
throttle with your big toe while in a corner you had better be prepared
to change your underwear and maybe buy another Camaro.
The Camaro is easier to get into and out of and it does have a trunk.
Both cars don't like speed bumps and anything larger than a tennis ball
in the road.
Personally, I like both cars. The Camaro for stop light to stop light
barn storming, which it does very well.
The 'Vette was made for really long straight stretches of freeway with
nobody in sight. ;-)
Life begins at 180mph.
Hoo-Rah!
