US should consider Taiwan's need

By ChenHurng-yu 陳鴻瑜

Tuesday, Sep 18, 2007, Page 8

Having stated through various channels that it opposes Taiwan's plan to
hold a referendum on applying for UN membership under the name Taiwan,
the US has now declared its official position through the publication of
a speech made by US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian
Affairs Thomas Christensen.

When we read this document carefully, we can start to understand what
the US is thinking. The US is against the referendum for six reasons.

First, such a referendum could cause Beijing to use military force
against Taiwan, and the US wants to avoid provoking Beijing.

Second, the referendum might involve a name change for Taiwan, and
President Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁) has promised not to pursue a change in
Taiwan's official name.

Third, the US &quot;[does] not support Taiwan's membership in international
organizations that require statehood and therefore would not support
such a referendum.&quot;

Fourth, this referendum would harm the interests of both Taiwan and the
US, because Taiwan's safety is in the US' best interest.

Fifth, the referendum has no benefits for Taiwan's international status.
It might harm Taiwan's foreign relations, and &quot;will limit, not expand,
Taiwan's international space.&quot; Beijing would likely react by limiting
Taiwan's space even further, and this might scare away countries that
are friendly to Taiwan.

Sixth, &quot;... most countries in the world accept Beijing's
characterization of Taiwan, and ... the PRC can call in overwhelming
support to marginalize Taiwan.&quot;

Christensen's points are a review of what has been US policy for years
in the triangular relationship between the US, China and Taiwan.

The US thinks that in this situation, Taiwan should not act rashly, to
avoid breaking the triangular framework that has gradually taken shape
over time. But this framework is based on the US' strategic ideas about
East Asia, and does not take Taiwan's situation and needs into account.

The shrinking of Taiwan's international space has taken shape under this
framework, and under it, in the long term Taiwan will have no
international space left.

Why did this situation arise? At the beginning of the 1970s, the US
sought to normalize its relations with Beijing, in order to be able to
extricate itself from the Vietnam war. Before the UN adopted the crucial
Resolution 2758 on the matter of who had the right to represent China in
the UN, Henry Kissinger went to Beijing to meet Chinese leader Mao
Zedong (毛澤東) and premier Zhou Enlai (周恩來), resulting in an
electoral setback.

With the normalization of relations, the US wanted to cater to China by
using Taiwan as a negotiation chip, and this involved turning it into a
special area that is not considered to be a country.

Simply put, in finding a solution for the Taiwan issue, the US has never
seriously thought about it from Taiwan's point of view, and only
considers the issue as part of its strategy in East Asia.

In the negotiation process with China, US leaders never brought up the
issue of dual recognition of China and Taiwan, but accepted Beijing's
conditions from the start.

In this respect, the US doesn't take account of former French president
Charles de Gaulle in 1964 and Lao premier Souvanna Phouma in 1962, who
publicly stated they wanted to recognize both China and Taiwan.

When the San Fransisco Peace Conference was held in 1951, many countries
advocated respecting the will of the Taiwanese people. But the US turned
a deaf ear to them, and left Taiwan's status undetermined, so it would
have even more leverage over it.

This policy helped Taiwan overcome the threat of Chinese invasion, and
develop its current democracy and prosperity. However, the US' policy
did not solve the Taiwan issue. To this day Taiwan lives with the threat
of military action from China. In light of the US' current security
strategy in East Asia, this threat will remain, and it is hard to see it
receding in the foreseeable future.

The US is using three methods to avert China's military threat against
Taiwan. The first is persuading China to restrain itself. The second is
selling arms to Taiwan. The third is opposing Taiwan's &quot;provocative
behavior.&quot;This is a passive approach, playing a game of balance.

Why doesn't the US take the Taiwan issue to the UN to debate it? It
could allow the UN to safeguard Taiwan's safety by thoroughly clearing
away China's threats to Taiwan.

Christensen said in his speech that the US government was &quot;trying to
help preserve and expand the Taiwan people's international space.&quot;

How can we put this statement to the test?

The US State Department could consider, or not be opposed to, taking the
Taiwan issue to the UN for discussion. It could support Taiwan in
setting up a Taiwan liaison office in the UN. It could reconcile its
conflicts with Taiwan. Then we would know we can believe Christensen's
words.

I strongly disagree.

Micky Wong has watched &quot;Team America:World Police&quot;(2004)
one too many times --  it is only a puppet show.

The U.N. is closest the world has to a global policeman.

The U.S. have never been a global policeman,
so not surprisingly U.S. foriegn policy reflects
its own interest.   The US support for spreading
democracy around the world has been inconsistent
and in competition with its foriegn policy which
overlooks oppression for political-economic-military
expediency. For example, the USA overlooked
human rights violations in USA friendly oil-rich
countries like Indonesia. ISTM that often what
appears to constitutes being &quot;USA-friendly&quot;
seem to have to do with a country's relationship
with the US military and access for US based
international corporations.

The reason why a democracy comes about is
because a government cannot deal effectively
(over an extended amount of time) with its
people any other way. Not only are the people
capable of governing themselves BUT they
are unwilling to be governed any other
way, are capable of defending themselves,
and willing to die for the control over their
own lives.  You can't  force democracy
on a people - it percolates from the ground
up to the top.  Self rule becomes politically
expedient solution when certain conditions
exist --  it does not happen because there
is a *need* but because there can be no
other other way. Democracy is not for the
faint of heart but for the courageous. A
democracy cannot be sustained unless
the people are committed and actively
working to keep it so.
