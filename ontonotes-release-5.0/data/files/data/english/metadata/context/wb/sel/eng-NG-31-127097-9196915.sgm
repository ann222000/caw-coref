I am stopping taking Remeron antidepressants, and a side effect is
severe insomnia. I have been to my doctor and he's refusing to
prescribe me any pills, since he states that sleeping pills are no
longer prescribed here in England, since they are addictive.
I have tried stuff like Melatonin, valerian, passionflower etc etc,
but none of it is powerful enough to induce sleep.
So, I have no option but to buy sleeping pills from an online
pharmacy. However, unfortunately, since I'm still in the stages of
applying for a credit card, which I'd need to make payment from an
online pharmacy, I'm left in the situation of not having any pills for
my insomnia.
So, I was wondering if anyone in this group would be kind enough to
post me any sleeping pills they have? I'm only asking for about 2
weeks worth of pills,14 days.
If anyone is generous enough to help me out,then please contact me for
my postal address.
If needed, I'm prepared to make payment for the sleeping pills via
Paypal.
Thanks and bye friends.

Welll, my doctors will certainly not prescribe any more sleeping pills
to me, not even the non-benzodiazapene one's like,zolpiderm
I've tried warm milk alone,and with chocolate powder,and it has very

So, I hope someone can be kind enought  to give me their spare

Drug abuse is also a terrible illness.

If you truly have insomnia and require medication, your doctor should
prescribe the proper medication.  There is another problem, I have
detected deceptions in your posts.

cripes !!  international  begging for something that is
universally illegal !!!  what do you thing is going to happen ?

really you sound like some kind of  a troll , but if I'm wrong
then I apologize.

so ..............
pretty much everyone knows that if you need OTC sleep
meds , then for nearly all people there is triprolidine !!!

it works so well at putting people a to sleep that here in the USA
nearly all retailers have pulled this OTC cold medicine off the shelf
because of tons of lawsuits. these mostly from truck drivers , that
have fallen asleep and wrecked when taking this decongestant.

I'm quite sure that OTC brands containing Triprolidine are readily
available there as they are  ( on the web mostly in the USA )
here in the USA.   get some of this,  take it ONLY when you are sure
you are going to bed. give it an hour and  get ready to hit hard as
it knocks you out !!!  it is generally WAY more effective  than many
prescription sleeping preparations.
go to RxPalace to order a brand with triprolidine
https://www.rxpalace.com/Aprodine24.htm

type  triprolidine lawsuits into google for more info.

in the UK Actifed still contains triprolidine  ( not now in the USA
because of lawsuits ,  it's reformulated over here )
and you can get it everywhere .......
http://www.mypharmacy.co.uk/medicines/medicines/a/actifed/actifed%20t...

NEVER take triprolidine if you have to leave the house and drive or
operate machinery !!!!

Understand this; sending just ONE still violates US law.  Go back and
discuss the matter with your doctor.  If you are genuine in your
request, I'd suggest your issues go much deeper than simple insomnia,
and that's probably why your doctor cut you off.  And asking a bunch
of anonymous people on usenet to send you drugs through the mail is
just plain stupid.  I trust this is the last we've heard of this
matter from you.

I use triprolidine, it is an excellent antihistamine (it is not a
decongestant).  Yes is it sedating for many people, but not everyone.
Unfortunately has no drowsiness effect whatsoever for me.

Ok, I'm here to set the damn record staright. I really was on remeron
antidepresstans for 5 months. Now I am going off it. The main PROBLEM
IS SEVERE INSOMNIA.
My life has been hard in ways you ppl couldn't understand, so I'm a
bit offended with all the ppl calling me a druggie in search of a fix.
Thanks for the guy who gave me the link to the actifed site.
My life is hell. And the old truism that no man can understand another
mans hell is so true.
I'll try to ignore the snide comments about me being a junkie and
focus on the good ppl who went to the trouble and intriuduced me to
stuff like actifed.
Bye my brothers.

Buy them from a drug dealer. That way you put only yourself at risk instead of
dragging people from the ng into it. A better alternative would be rehab tho.

Don't think you are the only one on earth who has suffered the effects
of insomnia.  In fact, I'll bet my best days have been worse than your
worst days.  That said, you come in here again asking people to
illegally send drugs to you through the mail, I'll personally TOS your
