I guess it is no surprise to be disappointed in a Dealer, but in this
case it is one of the after market specialty shops.

The clutch on my Venture has been slipping a bit for some time now.
The recommended fix for it as identified in the Venture or V-4 forums
is the Barnett SR-2 pressure plate and spring conversion. So last
weekend I go to one of my favorite local shops, Andres, to order the
kit. Now Barnett's suggested retail is $137.50 US and Andres quotes me
$192.95 Can. OK US exchange and shipping can account for most of the
difference so I think it's a fair price and place my order.

Today I get the call the part is back ordered for a couple of weeks.
Ah it's winter and I can still ride the bike if we get a warm day or
two so the delay is no big deal. Then they tell me since they will
have no pending order for Barnett in a couple of weeks they will not
bring the part in.

Huh?

They suggest I should call them back when I really need the part and
if they have more call for Barnett parts they will bring it in.

I appreciate the freight for a single order digs into the profit
margin, but you are either a dealer or you are not a dealer. For the
record Andres advertises itself as a Barnett dealer and are listed on
the Barnett website as a dealer.

I called Barnett and they confirmed the SR-2's will not be available
for a week or two but they cannot sell directly to me.

So I have to find another place to buy the parts and maybe I will have
to resort to one of the online guys.

Since Andres would not order the part for me, even if they had to
sacrifice a bit of profit or at least offered to split the freight
cost they have now lost all of my business. I probably drop a grand or
two there every year. That will not have a major impact on their
bottom line, but if you figure they operate on a 40% GPM that
translates into $800.00. Bad business to not sacrifice ten or twenty
dollars in lost profit for an item they claim to be a dealer for and
then lose $800.00 by losing the customer.

So now I am looking for an online Barnett dealer. Suggestions?

Well, I suppose you've looked at this:

But, why not just ask the good folks at Barnett where or
how to locate a retail outlet for your purchase.

Barnett has a dealer search function on their web site. I made a few
calls today trying to find one able to bring in the SR-2 without
success but I am pretty sure I could find a dealer locally, the only
question will be price. Many of the local guys try to make a years
income on single deals.

First you should write a polite letter to the *owner* of Andres explaining
exactly why he's losing your business, how much he's likely to lose annually
as a result, and asking him if that's what he really wants to do. (The boss
sometimes doesn't know what the guys in the parts department are doing.)

If you get a negative reply, waffling, or no reply at all, *then* it's time
to go looking for a new parts source.

Well, I don't have any suggestions, but I'll certainly agree that's a
prime example of shit for service and bad business on their part.

Not saying this to make you feel more ripped, but I've had such good
service at one of the Harley dealers here in Edmonton that I've almost
felt a little guilty at times.

A few weeks ago, for instance, they put a whole bunch of slow-moving
and old stock upstairs, rather loosely organized, at cheap prices.  I
heard about it, so I just went to the back and began up the stairs to
take a look.  One of the parts people, who hadn't been there long
enough to know me, stopped me and told me I couldn't go up there
unless they first got a parts person to accompany me.

"Why?", I asked.  "Because there's a lot of small stuff up there, easy
for people to stuff in their pockets," was the reply.  To which I, of
course, defended my integrity and said they shouldn't have to worry in
my  case.

A rather small incident and I could see the reason for the policy, so
I gave little thought to it afterwards.

But, when I came into the dealership 3 days later, people were
practically falling over themselves apologizing for what had happened,
as soon as I stepped through the door.  You know.  "We heard what
happened and we have spoken to the person involved and we want to
apologize and let you know it will not happen again."  So small was
the insult, I had to get them to remind me what it was about.

They then proceeded to knock off over $100 off what I bought, the
parts person explaining by saying, "I heard about what happened."

And, as for ordering seemingly small parts...  I needed 3 self-tapping
screws to mount my speakers to the inner fairing.  They didn't have
them in stock and I know I could have matched them up at a bolt place
if I had to, but they didn't balk at ordering them for me.  I've
ordered lots of small stuff like that and never met an inkling of
resistance.

That's the way it should be.  And that's the dealer where I'll be
buying that Street Bob - proving again what you said about the effect
of good business practices.

Maybe they're just passing on the additional shipping charges.  That's what I'd
do.

If someone orders something and it's going to cost me 50 cents more than normal
because it's out of production or some other special reason, I'm not splitting
that 50 cents with him.  If he wants it, he pays what it costs.

They should have given you the option of sending in a special order if
you paid the additional shipping or waiting until they had a large
enough order to cover it.

Well that's one way of looking at it, but I look at it this way. I
have supported this shop for many years most times paying more for a
product than I could purchase it for online. I pay the premium in
support of the local shop.

In this case the shop claims to carry Barnett parts, has a retail
price for the part, but refuses to bring it in because the freight
will be too expensive. I didn't tell them to be a Barnett dealer. I
didn't set the retail price. I only asked them to order what they
claim to carry and buy it at their retail price.

So in the future I will use the local shop the way a wary buyer would.
If their price is the same or cheaper than the online guys, I'll buy
it there, but if not I'll use their inventory to check out quality and
define the right size, if applicable, and then order it online.

At the end of the day, to save "50 cents" this shop will lose hundreds
of dollars in profits. I'd say that was a weak decision.

There is an old saying in the contracting business that applies to
this situation:

"You can shear a sheep a hundred times, but you can only slaughter it
once."

It's probably a lot less than a hundred times.  How many times a year is a sheep
sheared?  Two?  One?  That's an old sheep if it gets it 100 times.

Check with another Barnett dealer.  If they give you the same thing about a
minimum order for them, it may be a stipulation from Barnett and they're just
passing it along, which is all they can do.

approximately 1-2 times a year until the silly
bugger is too old...they start losing teeth when
7+ years old. So you would normally (FSVON) get
only 7 to 14 shearings. Alpaca OTOH can yield

&gt;Check with another Barnett dealer.  If they give you the same thing about a

Made two calls yesterday, found a shop that would order it in as soon
as Barnett has them. A couple of weeks.

No but once the fiber becomes to coarse for much
use they usually are retired from production. Cut
off is about 30 microns =\- depending on the
quality. Much over 25 micron and it gets used
mostly for things like the shell on suit coats and
such. The really coarse stuff also makes good
filler for coats. It is what I consider one of the
more unique animal fibers that man uses,
hypoallergenic, cheaper to process than wool (no
lanolin, no microscopic barbs) when it is cold it
is very warm, when it is hot it is cool. Oh and it
can be found in 22 natural colours. Let's see wool
do that! Sheep is good for naught but cooing
imnsho.

History does not record anywhere at any time a
religion that has any rational basis. Religion is
a crutch for people not strong enough to stand up
to the unknown without help. But, like dandruff,
most people do have a religion and spend time and
money on it and seem to derive considerable
pleasure from fiddling with it.
