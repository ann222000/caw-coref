My plans don't give a lot of detail about my wing walk but it's for a truss
rib mostly wood wing. The walk is supposed to go from the front spar to the
trailing edge and should be 1/4 ply. my question is will a piece of 1/4 ply
bend around the curvature of the wing (Clark Y) or should I laminate, say,
two pieces of 1/8 ply? If I were to laminate, what would the best way of
ensuring i got decent contact between the top and bottom surfaces?

The designer should know, if it has been built before.  I would think that
you would trust him, if you are trusting him for your life on the rest of
the design.

That small bend should not be a problem.  If you do laminate, use a 1/8th
inch notched trowel to spread adhesive, place the two together firmly on a
flat surface using another thicker flat surface on top to apply some
pressure, then wiggle the two pieces back and forth a little.  Apply the two
pieces at one time without taking apart again.

Well, what I was actually asking is if I could laminate the two pieces
to take the curve in the wing. I realise this is basic stuff for a lot
of you guyus, but I've never bent realatively thick ply before and I
don't want to make a mess out of the rest of the wing trying..

Mine also calls for 1/4" but only from the front spar to
the back spar, since I have flaps. Laminating 2 peices should
be ok but I wouldn't us an 1/8" trowel. I would spred the glue
around with a popsicle stick or scrap wood, quite a few clamps,
and straps of wood to put on top. Clamp one end, then start
clamping every couple of inches until you reach the other end.

1/4" ply will bend more easily if you orient the grain across
the bend instead of along it. The grain should be parallel to the
spars.
If it's 1/4" birch ply, that would seem a lot of overkill
for a wingwalk. If it's 1/4" pine or fir, it should bend without any
problem. My son and I finished a small boat last year, using 1/4"
Chilean Pine plywood, and we put some impressive curves in it. See this
picture of an identical boat:

OK. Here's what I'm thinking now. I use a couple of 3/4 ply ribs as a
mold with holes drilled near the upper edge as a place to locate the
clamps. A few pieces of wood across the underside of the ply to keep it
from sagging and a few pieces clamped right on top of those to ensure a
good contact between the two glued surfaces. the width is only 12 inches
so I'm supposing the two pieces would have adequate surface contact
(i.e, no gaps) and I should end up with a molded walkway..

I would be very surprised if your one ply of 1/4" ply would not conform to
the curve you need.  Astonished, even! &lt;g&gt;

Don't forget that the curve is part of what gives that thin of a piece of
plywood the ability to carry your weight.

Is there any other structure to help out?  Extra stringers, or anything?

I would think there should be no more than 6" to a stronger structure as you
measure parallel to the grain of the ply face, and perhaps 9 or 10 inches
between supports as measured across the grain.

Are those types of numbers close to what all of you other wooden
homebuilders have found in your plans?

I am going with these types of numbers based upon my knowledge of being a
woodworker.  I am curious if that is what others have found.

What do the plans call for? Any specific type of plywood?  What
model of aircraft is it? 1/4" birch is awfully heavy, and if that's
what the designer calls for I'd wonder how overbuilt the rest of the
airplane is. My Jodel has a wingwalk of 1/8" birch and it's good
enough.

Laminating a curved piece is, if anything, better than laminating
a flat piece, and also better than using a single piece.

If you laminate it on the curve before the glue sets the
laminated plywood will be pre-stressed to the desired curve.

You don't need a mold, you can attach one piece, let it set,
then glue the second piece over it.

Regarding the veneers, the laminated piece should  be symetrical.
If the pieces have an A and a B face, they should be laminated
ABBA or BAAB, not ABAB or BABA.  The grain on the new front
and back face should be parallel.  I'd put the A faces out, ABBA.

But I think aircraft and marine plywood is supposed to have A-grade
veneers front and back, right?

Well, the ribs are truss type., the two that will support the walk I've
covered with 1/16th birch ply. I plan to run a 1/4 inch stip alnog the
length to hold the walk surface fluch with the top of the ribs an glue
some , say 1/2 inch sq spruce betwwn the ribs every 6 " to support them
The whole thing shouldn't be too heavy, I reckon, especailly as I'm only
going to install one on one side.

Aha, I bet that is exactly why they make it that way.  Plywood with
the grain on the front and back parallel is 15% stronger (or is it
stiffer, I don't remember) vs bending across that grain.  Made as
you describe, it is more omnidirectional in stiffness.

If I were to laminate it for the wing walk, I'd do it with the
outer face grain (outside and inside) parallel to the spar
It should curve better that way and be a bit stiffer--like the
way plywood is laid over joists.

&gt;&gt; &gt; ...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Dunno, that's what I was asking. I've laminated two pieces of ply
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; together before, just was wondering if it was practical or
advisable
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; do it curved.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Laminating a curved piece is, if anything, better than laminating
&gt;&gt; &gt; a flat piece, and also better than using a single piece.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I reckoned.

&gt;&gt; &gt; If you laminate it on the curve before the glue sets the
&gt;&gt; &gt; laminated plywood will be pre-stressed to the desired curve.

&gt;&gt; &gt; You don't need a mold, you can attach one piece, let it set,
&gt;&gt; &gt; then glue the second piece over it.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Regarding the veneers, the laminated piece should  be symetrical.
&gt;&gt; &gt; If the pieces have an A and a B face, they should be laminated
&gt;&gt; &gt; ABBA or BAAB, not ABAB or BABA.  The grain on the new front
&gt;&gt; &gt; and back face should be parallel.  I'd put the A faces out, ABBA.

&gt;&gt; Well, the don't really. This stuff is so fine it's beyond belief. For
&gt;&gt; instance the 1/4 birch IU have is 12 ply and is one direction on one
&gt;&gt; side and the other on the other side, so it doesn't much matter which
&gt;&gt; way you put it on.

&gt; Aha, I bet that is exactly why they make it that way.  Plywood with
&gt; the grain on the front and back parallel is 15% stronger (or is it
&gt; stiffer, I don't remember) vs bending across that grain.  Made as
&gt; you describe, it is more omnidirectional in stiffness.

&gt; If I were to laminate it for the wing walk, I'd do it with the
&gt; outer face grain (outside and inside) parallel to the spar
&gt; It should curve better that way and be a bit stiffer--like the
&gt; way plywood is laid over joists.

OK, that makes sense. This stuff is pretty stiff as it is which is why
i'd prefer to make it out of two laminated pieces.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt; But I think aircraft and marine plywood is supposed to have A-grade
&gt;&gt; &gt; veneers front and back, right?

&gt;&gt; This stuff has a grade all the way through..

&gt; Over on rec.boats some people say they have found marine
&gt; ply with voids in the interior plys.

Yeah, i think that's allowed in marine. This stuff is aircraft grade and
I've cut up quite a bit of it into small pieces. I've never found even
the tiniest spot in it. Bit of sworl on the outer faces from time to
time, but nothing even approaching what you'd call a knothole..

No.  Repairs (like those football-shaped patches you see the B-face
of B-C plywood) are allowed in the interior plys  of marine plywood,
but no voids.
