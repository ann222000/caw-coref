This is for all U.S. residents or visitors:

We'd just covered over a thousand miles of touring, camping out and
seeing the sites in Eastern Oregon, Washington and Idaho. My friend and
I were attempting to ride home to Oregon through the state of Washington
in 105 degree heat. We were tired and hot, and stopped at a little place
to the west of Walla Walla named &quot;Touchet&quot;. As we were rehydrating and
hanging out in the air-conditioned quickie-mart there, a Washington
State Highway patrolman (sorry, I didn't get his name or license)
started giving us a long, deliberate and malevolent eye as he stood in line.
I wondered to myself what in the world we could possibly be doing
that was illegal and could come up with nothing. Eventually he left (I
thought) but he really went outside to sit in his car and wait for us.
When I went outside to remount, from the front seat of his car he
told me that if I put on my beanie and rode, he would cite me *and* (now
get this) _&quot;SEIZE&quot;_ my motorcycle.
Not &quot;impound&quot; mind you, but _SEIZE_!
I asked him if he'd ever heard of the constitution and he admitted
that he had, but basically blew it off much in the same fashion that
George Bush has referred to it as &quot;Just a Goddamned Piece of Paper!&quot;:

http://tinyurl.com/232hv3

I then told him there was nothing wrong with my helmet (yes, it was a
beanie as was my friend's) and showed him the DOT sticker on the back of it.
&quot;That helmet isn't legal in the state of Washington. The new law,
effective on the 22nd (notice that he avoided saying which month he was
referring to) says that Washington is going to adopt federal guidelines
for helmet construction.&quot;
&quot;There ARE no federal guidelines for helmet construction.&quot;
&quot;Yes, there are now. They just changed it (lying through his teeth.)
Standards for padding thickness, straps, etc. are all clearly defined in
that law.&quot;
Not wanting to give him any more of what he wanted, instead of asking
what law he was referring to I simply said, &quot;There are better things to
bust a guy's chops about than helmets. My friend and I are just trying
to get home. Once we're back in Oregon, we won't be coming back.&quot;
&quot;If that's the case, then I'll let you go through as long as you
don't come back into Washington wearing that helmet. However, if another
officer sees you, he's going to give you a ticket.&quot;
/'Yeah, right,'/ I thought to myself. I've had cops pull that kind of
thing on me before and was not about to fall for it again. I NEVER
believe anything that a cop says at face value. IME, they will make up
laws and lie their collective asses off to entrap you into doing
something so that they can bust you anyway. &quot;Let you go through&quot;
translates directly to &quot;just try to get on your bike and I will nail
your ass to the wall.&quot;
I simply said, &quot;Thanks.&quot;
In the mean time, my friend had come out of the store and he also
politely thanked the trooper for the warning, after which the guy drove
off towards the west on Highway 12. To be fair, I do have to admit that
he could have simply gone up the road and laid for us, but he did give
us fair warning.
On the other hand, immediately after he left, a guy in his thirties
ran up to us and said, &quot;That guy's a real asshole. Don't believe him.
He's going to lay in wait for you up the road and nail your ass. He got
me and my old lady last week for the same thing. He ticketed me and not
my old lady for some reason, but then let us drive off. Since you're
from out of state, you can bet that he's going to do whatever he can to
fuck with you. Your best bet is to go up Hanson Road or Touchet North
and try to cut around him.&quot;
As my friend and I were discussing our options, an older guy came up
to us and asked us if we'd seen the unmarked stater go blasting by just
then, also heading east. Now it became obvious what the cop's plan was.
He wouldn't give us the tickets- he'd leave that honor to his buddy in
the unmarked car.

My friend and I thought about all this but decided that the best
thing to do was to gas up quickly and do a 180 back to Walla Walla. From
there, we would bag ass over the border into Oregon where we would
presumably be safe (turned out we were.)
On the way back to Walla Walla, ANOTHER unmarked state highway
cruiser went blasting by us in the opposite direction. I guess he didn't
ID us as the bikers who needed some grief, so we continued on our way at
the speed limit unmolested.
Once in Walla Walla, we headed down Highway 125 into
Milton-Freewater, Oregon and as we crossed the border, my friend waved
goodbye to Washington. I also waved but for some reason, all of my
fingers but one were unable to straighten into the upright position if
you get my drift.

The rest of our ride was both cooler and uneventful, but we had to
ride many miles out of our way to avoid getting a ticket.

You are advised to avoid the state of Washington if you wear a beanie.

In response to this incident, I decided to try to obtain a link to the
NHTSA's (DOT) standards for helmet construction. The federal standards
describing approved motorcycle helmets are in Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standard (FMVSS) 218.

_FMVSS 218_

Remember that number, my friends. And better yet, try to find it on an
official United States government website.

Can't find it? Here, I'll help you:

http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/portal/site/nhtsa/template.MAXIMIZE/menuitem...

or better yet:

http://tinyurl.com/ywqy7n

It can be gotten to by doing the following:

1. Go to the NHTSA home page at http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/

2. Click on the &quot;Traffic Safety&quot; tab (note: NOT, as would be expected,
the &quot;Vehicles &amp; Equipment&quot; tab)

3. In the light blue left hand column, click on &quot;Motorcycles&quot;

4. Scroll down to &quot;Studies &amp; Research&quot;

5. Click on &quot;Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 218 (Motorcycle
Helmets)&quot;

(My thanks to Michael at the NHTSA Motorcycles division for his help in
finding out how to do this. It took me over three hours to get this
information. In the process, I was hung up on, yelled at, deliberately
made to believe that I had a bad connection and so on. Finally I was
forwarded to Michael, and his patient and helpful demeanor was greatly
appreciated.)

Note though, that the current version of the actual wording of the
standards is apparently only available from the &quot;Federal Register&quot;:

http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/index.html

The wording at the NHTSA link I provided may or may not be current
(&quot;Revised as of October 1, 1997&quot; and the current version is 2002 I
believe) but it's the best I can find. I spent over an hour searching
the Federal Register, but to no avail.

So much for &quot;ignorance of the law is no excuse.&quot; Now it would appear
that we the people are deliberately being held in ignorance of laws so
that we can be arrested or hassled at any time.

Also note this website (a vague description of how to identify an unsafe
helmet):

http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/pedbimot/motorcycle/UnsafeHelm...

I've been wearing that beanie for over 20 years now. However, I want to
obey the law and will start wearing my other helmet which has one inch
of styrofoam lining and is DOT approved. What gets me though, is that
helmet law are so deliberately obfuscatory and vague. IMO, both the
government and the legal industry (I no longer refer to it as a
profession) do this intentionally so that they can always snap
&quot;IGNORANCE OF THE LAW IS NO EXCUSE!!&quot; and then suck legal fees off of
you. They don't give a FLYING FUCK about your safety, or whether or not
you are found guilty or not. They just want those legal fees. And to get
you into a court of law, they have to deliberately make the standards
and guidelines, which you and helmet manufacturers are supposed to
follow, as vague and hard to find as possible so that you will BREAK THE
LAW NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY NOT TO.

Remember this:

1. If you bought your helmet and the DOT label separately, then you put
the label on later, you are going to most likely be found guilty. Period.

2. All helmets sold in the United States have to be designed within the
FMVSS 218 standards by federal law (I forget which, but believe me,
this is the case.)

3. Novelty helmets aren't worth the money you pay for them as more and
more states that have helmet laws are changing such laws to read that in
their state, helmets must meet federal standards.

4. Those standards are damned near impossible to find and when you do,
they are both incomplete and old. For instance, note that there are
supposed to be illustrations included with FMVSS 218 but that they have
been ommitted from the NHTSA website.

If anybody has better luck finding the current version of FMVSS 218 at
the Federal Register, please let me know. I spent over an hour there and
had no luck. I also called them and spent a half hour talking with one
of their reps, and we both gave up.

(Later) I just found this government site which has FMVSS 218 and links
to all the illustrations:

I wore a beanie for a few years until I realized that if I've gotta wear
something anyway, I might as well wear something that provides protection. I
sometimes still elect to go lidless in approved states but most commonly
wear one. I like the option and use it accordingly. My brain is well
protected in my ass so the helmet is more to preserve my devilish good looks
and ability to blow my nose without leaking from my ears. &lt;sfsf&gt;

The trooper was bullshitting you. The law is here...

http://tinyurl.com/2bobbv

Basically it says...

For purposes of this section, &quot;motorcycle helmet&quot; means a
protective covering for the head consisting of a hard outer shell,
padding adjacent to and inside the outer shell, and a neck or chin
strap type retention system, with a sticker indicating that the
motorcycle helmet meets standards established by the United States
Department of Transportation

Since the law went into effect a few years ago I know of no one
that's been hassled when they have a DOT sticker on their helmet,
even if the only thing on the sticker were the letters DOT, which of
course is fake.

It also says that the State Patrol can only amend the rule only when
it pertains to glasses, goggles and face shields, BUT not helmets.

It doesn't say anywhere (that I can find) that they can take your
vehicle, except in a new law pertaining to drivers licenses...

Regarding the &quot;new law&quot; he was talking about, it authorizes an
officer to impound your vehicle if you're not properly licensed
to operate the vehicle. That includes an endorsement.

But, as one cop told me a few years ago... &quot;It's not my job to
know the exact wording of every law. That's what a judge is
for.&quot;

Buy a DOT approved helmet, and get over it.
Twist all the words into whatever you need

You broke the law,

How can it be any simpler?
Just like if you go one mile an hour over the speed
limit and people around you are going 10 over...
if you get the ticket...
it's because *you* broke the law.

Depends on what kind of cop you are, IMO there are two kinds:

2. Join the force to bully people (AKA &quot;pigs&quot;.)

If the latter, then yes. I hate and detest pigs as would anybody with a

Jesus. I'm a real arch-criminal. I wear a beanie.

Didn't that trooper have anything better to do than to hassle me and my
friend? As I stood there talking with him, I counted (no shit) EIGHT
cars go by that were traveling WAY past the speed limit. However, he
wasn't interested in them, was too focused on a couple of &quot;vicious
helmet law offenders.&quot;

By the way, the main thing that the trooper did to piss me off was to
threaten to &quot;seize&quot; my motorcycle and I have no doubt that he carefully
chose this wording in an attempt to provoke a situation. Doesn't matter
though because it didn't work and eventually, people like him always pay
the price in karma. I've seen it happen too many times. He's going to
get his.

Note that the NHTSA is going to be pushing for legislation which makes
it illegal to sell beanies and DOT stickers separately in order to get
around the law that helmet manufacturers must make helmets that meet DOT
standards. Once they do that, beanies will most likely be a thing of the
past.

As for me, I have another (half) helmet that's legal and I'm going to
start wearing it. It's white and reflects the heat better.

Sure wish they'd design a helmet that's both legal and at the same time
can suck in air to cool your skull though.

">

I once had a state cop give me so much shit for a traffic violation that I
was compelled to hire a defense attorney. I mean this guy was on a fucking
tyraid, yelling, getting all wrapped up in his indignation. I was sure he
was going to pull me from the driver's seat and start beating me.

Later I thought, luckily I weigh around 250lbs.

(As I was reaching into the glove box to get my registration, he opened my
driver's door, while I wasn't looking, and started right into yelling at me.
Good thing for him I wasn't reaching for a gun. I wished I could press
charges against him for wreckless endangerment of a police officer, to wit,
himself.)

I admitted to him that what I did was wrong (I went around another vehicle
and through a stop sign, wihtout really stopping), and that I had nothing to
say in my defense, but he pushed it, and pushed it, until I couldn't help
but explain myself to try to diffuse his anger. He then quoted me
incorrectly in his report and added a criminal charge to the civil
violations. Clearly he was too pissed off to be able to think and act
coherently, and actually comprehend what I was telling him.

Me? I was as calm and cool as I always am.

My attorney turned and used the misquote in my favor before the magistrate,
and I got through it the same as I would have, had he some self-control, and
just given me the ticket for the actual traffic violations that he
witnessed.

What I did sounds worse on paper than it actually was if you were there when
I did it and saw it happen from start to finish, which the officer did not.
He saw the tail end of something that might seem extremely dangerous, _if_
you start guessing at what happend 30 seconds before that, and if you start
projecting what _could_ have happened during the maneuver under _different_
circumstances. So in effect, he was prosecuting me for something he
_thought_, not something he actually witnessed.

Anyway, that's my bad cop story. I've taken a lot of shit over that story
for the same reason that the cop gave me so much shit. Unless you were in
the car with me, you wouldn't really understand that it was ultimately a
harmless maneuver. At least with pictures of the intersection and an
explanation of the events leading up to the actual traffic violation, the
magistrate was agreeable enough to drop the ciminal charge, and simply fine
me for a lane violation and failure to stop, which I had never intended to
contest. Had the cop just given me the ticket, I would have simply mailed in
the 200 bucks.

If they aren't looking for an explanation for the purpose of cutting you
some slack, cops should check their emotions before they step out of the
cruiser, shut the fuck up, and hand you a ticket for only what they
witnessed.

I mostly agree with you.  No reason for him to be a dickhead from the
start.

But, unfortunately,,, you don't know what the cop may have just got
finished doing; like seeing a baby fly through the windshield because
the parents didn't have enough sense to put it in a car seat.  Or some
drunk blow a stop sign and wipe out a biker.  Or some other shit they go
through on a daily basis like listen to the same old crap of a reason
from some idiot that wanted to get home to his couch in a hurry.  Wear

I figured if your dealer ran low, you'd grow your own and could therefor
blame the dealer. It's a whole scenario. Pay attention and it will all come
together. Now, who wants to play Rooster the pimp? &lt;Baretta theme song

I really don't give a flying fuck what that cop just went through. He
sure the fuck dosn't give a fuck what I just went through.

I personally don't care much for cops.

I do know in Cedar Rapids Iowa it only 86 bucks to knock an off duty

twice.

As I implied Steve, this group is guilty of one of the highest noise to

probably will continue to be.

If people didn't like my inclusion of that section, it's just too bad
I'm afraid. I threw it in there to emphasize what a total PRICK the
Washington State Trooper was being when he told me he would SEIZE my
motorcycle.

Riding a motorcycle is a freedom that's going to go away very soon for

I understand completely.

FWIW, he was on the road to the left of the intersection on the other side
of a partially opened construction gate behind a bunch of orange and white
barrels with a Road Closed sign (must have been bored out of his mind).

That's not to say he wasn't harboring some ill-will for other reasons, but
taking that out on me is utter bullshit. His profession is dealing with
these situtations, he needed to calm down before getting out of the cruiser.
When I have a bad morning at work, I don't take it out on my peers, or get
home and take it out on my wife and kids.

That said, I was cutting him all the slack he needed by keeping my mouth
shut and just taking it. I was in no hurry to get away, and I would have sat
there until he calmed down. He was the one in control of the time table. Not
to mention that he is as responsible for his actions, as I am, and he owed
it to me to not be a dick, since I was trying to have a calm discussion.
Clearly I was not a wild eyed, drugged out, or alcohol impaired lunatic.

At this point, I'm just happy to still have my license. Although I do harbor
the resentment of the additional cost of hiring a lawyer to defend myself
should _that_ cop show up at the hearing, which he did not. A state police
representative was there instead.

I still count the lawyer fee as  well worth retaining my license, but that
additional expense could have been prevented, if the dolt had had a two way
conversation with me, rather than just yelling, and threatening to see me in
court to petition that my license be permanently revoked (which he repeated
three times during his diatribe, before going on his way with a final, &quot;see
you in court&quot;).

I feel bad for his kids if they ever fuck up in front of him. Holy shit.

Basically, I cost myself a couple hundred in fines and a few hundred more in
insurance premiums over the next three years. That was _my_ doing, and I
take/took full responsibility for my actions. But it cost me an extra grand
for defense of my driving priviliges, because _his_ emotions got the better
of him.  I sure do wish I could get _that_ money back.

So, yeah, I'm a little bitter toward state cops who come across as civilian
haters.

And now, I've got yet another ticket which I _have_ to contest, rather than
just accept and pay the fine, or find myself taking driver re-training. I
put my passenger side wheels over the rumble strip and into the breakdown
lane to make my exit from the highway. State cop pulls me over for a BDL
violation, and actually gives me a ticket that we both know is going to get
dismissed by the magistrate. He was just being a dick.

Honestly, I saw him sitting there and didn't think anything of what I had
done. Probably because unlike so many others at that intersection, I
actually refuse to go all four wheels into the brakedown lane to get to the
exit lane when the light is red. That is, I'm mindful of the law, and figure
it's bad form to violate it so blantantly, but two wheels? Oh, come on, I
wasn't even _half_ a car width over the line, and for only about 20 feet of
forward travel.

As I past by him in the exit lane 50 feet further down, he pulled out of the
stopped traffic, got behind me and put on his lights. I was completely
dumbfounded that he was actually pulling me over. When I asked him what I
had done,  he sarcastically remarked, &quot;Do you _always_ drive in the
breakdown lane?&quot; At that point, I had had enough of state cops, and didn't
say a word.

What really ticks me off though, is that I _really do_ commute every day at
60-65 in a 55 (bike or car), where (almost) everyone else is doing 65-70.
I'm one of the good guys out there. I challenge any state trooper to follow
me around without me knowing it for a month, without hassle for the
occasional minor fuck up, or the occasional hammering of the throttle for a
brief distance, and do an actual critique of my driving.

I just let the pack go by, and keep my distance from everyone. I've been
driving since I was 10, and on the road since 14. On the same roads. I've
seen it all, done it all, lived to tell about it, and grown old enough to
prefer to just take my time 95% of the time, and to always put safety first,
especially when I decide to pull out the stops every now and again, hammer
the throttle, and increase the risk of _personal_ injury.

Bottom line is there seems to be too much enforcement of the wrong traffic
laws for my liking around here, and not enough of the ones that matter day
to day. Like cagers going 70 MPH in a 55 with less than a one second gap
between them. I've checked the books. That constitutes driving to endanger
at the discretion of the LEOs. Problem is, they do it too, and in so doing,
promote it among others.

Frankly I blame the safety features in contemporary cars, for a lot of the
actual danger out there on the road. In the old days, if you were smart, you
knew that crashing at 70 was going to end badly. These days, folks seem to
think they're gonna survive no matter what happens, because they're
commuting in a fortess of safety. Doing 80MPH with a one second gap between
bumpers is nothing to them.

Good luck, I say.
