EVERETT - A Snohomish woman was charged today with telephone harassment
for allegedly making threats against a 16-year-old boy who was severely
injured when a cannon exploded at a Snohomish High School football
game.

Prosecutors allege that a 41-year-old woman called Brett Karch Oct. 20
while he was being treated at Everett Providence Medical Center. Karch,
a member of the school's Marine Corps Junior Reserve Officer Corps,
pulled the trigger the night the cannon exploded. The blast shattered
his leg and Karch has undergone at least three surgeries to repair the
damage.

His mother reported that Karch received threatening phone calls and
cards during his hospital stay from adults and students blaming him for
the explosion and what they fear could be a lost tradition. The cannon
for more than 30 years marked the start of each home game and Panther
touchdown.

The family reported the threats to Everett police and the hospital
restricted access.

Prosecutors filed the misdemeanor charge in Everett Municipal Court. If
convicted the woman could be sentenced to up to 90 days in jail and
$1,000 fine.

Icy
roads slow down commute

There were fewer drivers on the road than usual this morning, but they
were being warned to prepare for a potentially icy trip home tonight as
frigid temperatures continued to keep Snohomish County locked in a deep
freeze.

The morning commute turned into a crawl in some areas in the county.
Snow that started falling Wednesday afternoon and continued into late
evening froze in many places, leaving behind ice-encrusted roads.

The early morning commute along southbound I-5 was slow going,
Washington State Patrol trooper Kirk Rudeen said. A spinout on the
Snohomish River Bridge gummed up traffic.

"It's hard to get up to freeway speed so it takes even longer for it to
clear up," he said.

Overall, drivers seemed to be cautious and driving to the conditions,
Rudeen said. There also were fewer people on the road after a number of
area school districts either delayed classes or were closed.

This morning, troopers were called to 14 non-injury spinouts and two
collisions that resulted in minor injuries.

Many side streets remain icy and some have been closed to traffic.
Heavily traveled I-5 was mostly cleared but hazardous conditions remain
on bridges and elevated roadways, Rudeen said.

In Lynnwood, several vehicles were stuck this morning in the middle of
44th Avenue W because of black ice, Lynnwood police spokeswoman Shannon
Sessions said. There were no injuries, but numerous spinouts around the
community, she said.

Emergency room doctors at Providence Everett Medical Center treated
only a few people who had slipped and fell on ice and a couple of
patients involved in a car crash, spokeswoman Cheri Russum said.

Snow finally came Wednesday evening, and with cooler temperatures
overnight, officials feared that any moisture left on the roads could
have turned to ice by this morning.

Many surface roads were already icy Wednesday evening, including in
south Everett, where hail fell by 4:30 p.m. A wave of Arctic air
finally arrived.

"People should be aware that things could be a little dicey," said
Johnny Burg, a National Weather Service meteorologist.

This morning's commute will likely be slippery, but road conditions
were expected to improve throughout the morning. Temperatures could
cool again overnight, making for another slippery commute Friday.

It should stay cold through the weekend, but temperatures likely will
warm a little day by day, Burg said. By Sunday, temperatures are
expected to be close to normal, with highs in the upper 30s and lows in
the upper 20s.

Hail was falling in some locations Wednesday afternoon, pellet snow in
others, observers said.

The U.S. 2 trestle resembled a parking lot by 3:30 p.m. Wednesday.
Backed-up traffic was crawling on many streets in Everett, too. Traffic
was stop-and-go on I-5 south of I-405, and on I-405 east of I-5,
according to the Washington Department of Transportation.

By 8:30 p.m., I-5 and I-405 in Snohomish County south of Everett were
clear and almost free of traffic. Traffic had also cleared from U.S. 2,
and the Washington State Patrol had not been called to any serious
injury accidents.

Snow that fell Wednesday afternoon quickly melted from most roads and
highways in west Snohomish County. In east county, between 3 and 6
inches of snow remained on roads into the evening, said Meghan Soptich,
a state Department of Transportation spokeswoman.

Snow began falling again later Wednesday night.

Work crews were scheduled to spread de-icer on the highways early
today. However, de-icer becomes less effective as temperatures fall
deeper below freezing, Soptich said.

"We're expecting an icy commute, and we want people to be prepared for
that," she said.

Lake Roesiger resident Lyle Inman swept away the inch or so of snow
that fell on a parking lot he owns to keep it from turning into ice.

"That'll freeze and then you just got glare glass," he said.

Anyone who tried to drive on it "would just be in a ditch or in the
office - with a car and all."

Island County seemed to be getting hit even harder, officials there
said.

Central and north Whidbey Island and all of Camano Island were
blanketed with at least three inches of snow by 3:30 p.m., said Bill
Oakes, public works director and engineer for Island County.

"Snow is falling an inch an hour," he said.

Several roads were impassable with many vehicles snowbound.

"If people could stay off the roads ... that would help us," Oakes
said.

The rough weather means that drivers must slow down, said trooper Kirk
Rudeen, a spokesman for the Washington State Patrol.

"The biggest thing is slow down and increase following distance," he
said.

If you have to go somewhere, fill up your gas tank first, Rudeen said.
If you get stuck in the snow, stay in your vehicle. That's one way to
stay safe, and it makes it much easier for emergency crews to help you
get your vehicle off the roadway.

"We will get to you," Rudeen said.

Herald writers Jeff Switzer and Scott Pesznecker contributed to this
report.

Disaster Kit Snohomish County has been struck by a seemingly endless
series of storms recently. If you haven't already prepared a disaster
kit for your home, work and car, click here for a helpful list of the
items you should include.

A jury should decide whether a 16-year-old boy was negligent when he
picked up and put down a semiautomatic rifle that was later used to
kill two teens, a judge ruled Friday.

Dennis Cramm grabbed the rifle after a staged fistfight turned to
gunplay on May 30, 2000, in south Everett.

Cramm fired into the back of a car, killing two young men who had come
to watch the fight.

On Friday, Snohomish County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Cowsert turned
down a bid to dismiss a civil lawsuit against Daniel Woodall, who was
convicted of helping Cramm hide from police.

Woodall, then 16, had been put in charge of the military-style SKS
rifle that was used in the killing.

The parents of Jason Thompson and Jesse Stoner brought the lawsuit.
Thompson and Stoner, both 18, had been in the back seat of a car
leaving the area when they were killed.

The suit seeks damages from Pioneer Insurance Co. and the homeowner's
policy taken out by Woodall's parents, Michael R. and Donna L. Woodall.
The policy has a $300,000 limit, Pioneer lawyer Andrea Holburn said.

The policy comes into play because of the allegations against their
underage son.

The suit names a number of people, including Cramm, who was 17 at the
time of the shooting. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to 60
years in prison.

Several others also are named as defendants, including Dennis Cramm's
father, Dale Cramm, who owned the murder weapon and several other
firearms that were staged around the property that day.

Holburn argued that Woodall hid the gun twice while watching Dennis
Cramm fight with another young man. When gunfire erupted, Woodall ran
like most of the others who gathered to watch the fistfight, she said.

"He didn't want anyone to use it," she told Cowsert. "He was surprised
like everyone else that gunfire broke out that day."

One of the attorneys for the dead men's parents told Cowsert that
putting the gun down where Woodall did was an invitation to disaster.
The atmosphere was charged with tension, and firearms were placed in
various locations in anticipation of the fight and trouble.

Lawyer Franklin Shoichet of Seattle called it a "fistfight where people
were packing" guns and said that gunfire should have been anticipated.

It's up to a jury to decide if Woodall exercised "reasonable care" in
handling the dangerous weapon, Shoichet said.

"There were more red flags flying than in central Moscow during a
Soviet May Day parade," Shoichet told the judge. "This is a case of
negligent placement of a firearm."

Whether that's true is up to a jury, Cowsert said. In his ruling, he
said that someone possessing such dangerous items as firearms has a
duty to exercise the highest degree of care in their placement.
