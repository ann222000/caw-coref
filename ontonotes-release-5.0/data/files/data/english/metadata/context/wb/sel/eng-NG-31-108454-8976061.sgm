Narcotizing the Masses Through Religion
M. Bakri Musa
&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;

In the 19th Century, tiny Britain was able to humiliate the great Chinese Empire and subdue its masses by making opium readily available to them.  It was also highly lucrative for the British, with the poor Chinese bearing the heavy burden.  To be fair, Chinese leaders from the Emperor on down were fully aware of the dangers, but despite their valiant efforts they were unable to prevail against the British.
Today Muslims, Malays in particular, are being similarly narcotized, not by opium but by an equally potent agent:  religion.  Unlike the Chinese of yore who were victims of a malevolent foreign power, with Malays it is our leaders who are doing it to us, and with good intentions too.  They want us all to end up in Heaven!  Touching!
The Muslim masses today, like the Chinese of the 19th Century, were not unwilling victims.  They are not to be blamed, just like we cannot blame a patient who is in great pain wanting a powerful painkiller.  It may not cure the underlying disease but at least it relieves the suffering.  Likewise when your daily existence is terribly painful – the fate of the vast majority of Muslims – you too need immediate relief.  It would be cruel and inhumane to deny that.
The familiar official indices readily reveal the targic reality of daily existence of the Muslim ummah:  high mortality and low literacy rates, pathetic per capita income, gross abuses of human rights, women deprived of their basic dignity, and oppressive governments.  It is obvious to all, except the leaders.  Visit the slums and squatters of Bangladesh, Indonesia and Pakistan, and the anguished reality of unbelievable depravation will hit you hard even if you try to avoid it.
Muslim leaders should worry less about their followers ending up in Heaven and focus more on the monumental task at hand of lifting the masses out of their current living hell.  It may be argued that if religion brings relief to their daily struggle, so be it.  That is a delusion; the narcotizing effect of religion is even more destructive.

Hard Work of Leadership

Making sure that your citizens are fed, educated, and housed so they could have a reasonably decent life to pursue their dreams and realize their potential is no easy task.  While there are well-established and proven principles out there, there is no simple solution or ready path for a particular society.  Each has its own unique challenges; its leaders must carve their own distinctive path.  That would demand, aside from the mandatory diligence, intelligence, and integrity, an even greater sense of humility on the part of leaders.
The problems and challenges are infinite in their manifestations, and great intelligence is required in recognizing and elucidating them.  The humility is for the inevitable pitfalls and failures that would humble you and sap your confidence.  Humility is also needed so you could learn from your failures and from others, including your adversaries.
These necessary leadership qualities do not come naturally, nor are they easily acquired.  Consequently and far too often, the tendency is for incompetent leaders to resort to simplistic solutions or endlessly mouthing meaningless slogans:  “Bring back the Caliph!” “Implement the Sharia!” “Establish an Islamic state!”
The masses pick their cue from the leaders.  No surprise then that they are only too willing to senselessly “martyring” themselves.  Working hard to acquire the necessary skills to make themselves useful to society is much more mundane but necessary undertaking.  Nor does it grab the headlines.
The American scholar Abdullahi Naim wisely observed that the experience of the vast majority of Muslims across the world today is about “struggles for constitutionalism and human rights, economic development, and social justice, not about the quest for Islamic states to enforce sharia.”  Naim’s words should be emblazoned all over our masjids, ministries, and country.

First Tie Your Camel

Allah will not change the fate of a people unless they first change themselves, goes the wisdom of the Quran.  That in turn takes leadership.  Islam recognizes the supreme importance of leaders.  At Friday and other congregational prayers, it is customary for the Imam to lead the dua (supplication) seeking Allah to provide wisdom and health to the Sultans and leaders so they could lead their people along the path of righteousness.
Our culture too recognizes the importance of leadership, hence the observation:  Endah negri kerana penghulu (Great leaders, great society!).  It is not enough for us to pray that our leaders would lead us along the straight path.  We must also do our part and exercise due diligence in choosing our leaders and then attentively monitor their performances.
As per the wisdom of our Prophet Muhammad, s.a.w., first tie your camel securely, then pray to Allah that it does not escape.  To put that in current political perspective, we must first choose our leaders wisely, meaning, scrutinize them thoroughly before casting our votes, then pray to Allah that we get leaders with integrity and competence.  Praying alone will not secure your camel, or guarantee you honest leaders. Nor should we assume the one who could lead us in prayers is the one most competent to lead the nation.
Even a determined and wise Chinese Emperor could not withstand the narcotizing power of opium.  Religion is even more so.  Given a leadership woefully lacking in integrity and competence, religion can have a stranglehold more tenacious than the most potent opiate.
To Malays today, religion is less a salve for the soul and more a narcotic to make us escape the world and perversely, as God is everywhere in this wonderful universe, away from Him.

Malaise, Chinese and Indians (Part 1)
Helen Ang Oct 4, 07 11:34am

When the lawyers walked in Putrajaya, I'd wondered if police would baton
charge them, like it did the public who last protested at KLCC over the fuel
price hike. On balance, I thought not. If the black coats had been
manhandled, they'd have been more than happy to sue, I reckon.

Umno veteran Shahrir Abdul Samad hopes the march will not spread to other
things. I have a diametrical view and wish the show of disapprobation would
spread further. That's why the Walk for Justice was a gloaming (that faint
light seen before sunrise).

To have had cautious Chinese even participate in last Wednesday's walk is
already a positive development. The Malaysian-Chinese ethos is best
characterised by their catechism &quot;Don't get involved&quot; . it's what parents
teach children and wives preach to husbands who show even a sliver of
political activism.

But the real axis of Chinese existence resides in the mantra: &quot;It's the
economy, stupid&quot;, a tagline from Bill Clinton's presidential election
campaign. However frayed at the edges and broken at the seams the system is,
as long as there is a thread left hanging, on which to make a half decent
living, the Chinese will be prepared to stomach the malaise.

This malaise is the systemic rot in Malaysian institutions, both statutory
and quasi-government (e.g. the mass media that is controlled and owned by
ruling parties). The Chinese have mainly thus far been indifferent to their
rotting surroundings, well at least in public but we don't know what's
whispered at home.

It is this public apathy that has allowed Barisan Nasional to stake the
middle ground, for instance when Umno minister - with legal schooling,
without portfolio - Nazri Abdul Aziz equated the march and marching lawyers
with the opposition. It is BN political opponents and the usual suspects,
i.e. the NGO types, who normally dissent against the status quo.

'Naysayers and detractors' have been accused by PM Abdullah Ahmad Badawi of
painting a dark and bleak picture of Malaysia. Government critics, says
Abdullah, are discordant voices. Actually, these are lonely, overburdened
soloists when there should be a strident chorus.

The tai-ko syndrome

Referring to the Lingam tape, Shahrir also says the Bar Council should not
be 'overly sensitive' to matters yet unverified, reports national news
agency Bernama.

Why were the lawyers antsy on the implications of the video . to which
mainstream media has been self-consciously coy about attaching names,
incidentally? On a personal level, some of those lawyers may need to submit
in the courtroom before some judges they lack faith in.

But the national pall over the judiciary includes a deficit in upholding the
Federal Constitution which has been amended more times than there are
independent years in Malaysia; defending 'the rule of law', some promulgated
to lawfully benefit particular privileged people; asserting civil
jurisdiction uncivilly jostled by syariah, etc, etc.

Nonetheless, the average man on Petaling Street may not care about lofty
ethics, rarefied separation of powers, yadda-yadda if they do not see these
as bread-and-butter issues. Such parochial insularity is why there are
Chinatowns the world over . we Chinese prefer to keep ourselves to
ourselves.

A Chinatown product is MCA. It is a runner and fixer, operating on petty
levels through eternal 'internal discussions' with da Boss. Its service
centres assist Ordinary Joe or Ong Ah Ngiau and Koh Ah Kow to meander
through red tape, say, in applying for trading licences or filling
bureaucratic forms in triplicate. The nature of this communal party speaks
volumes about the Chinese credo.

A goldfish outlook to one's rice bowl will not help keep malaise at bay.
National policies assuredly impact on Chinese lives, be it through education
diktats and missed educational opportunities, escalating cost of private
healthcare, down sliding professionalism in public healthcare or simply the
rot permeating too many institutions of governance.

What apolitical Chinese should ponder on is this: if you don't go to
politics, wouldn't politics come to you?

Chinese fears and the cabal

Politics comes knocking on our door in many guises; in Little Napoleons
attempting to impose a race quota in private sector employment, for one.
Earlier, there was Maybank at the same on its appointment of legal firms.

To a Chinese child growing up, the bogeyman is the 'mata' or cop, who if he
is a naughty boy will spirit him away into the night. It's perhaps no
coincidence that the police force is overwhelmingly Malay. However, the
average, law-abiding adult Chinese will have no cause to blip on the police
radar. Which is not to say, though, that he is able to evade police
altogether. Driving, he can't skirt roadblocks.

This is fasting month and despite being starved of food and parched of
drink, our hardworking cops are assiduously on the job. So like it or not,
Ah Ngiau in his shiny Honda or Ah Kow in his spotless Toyota will have to
wind down his automatic window to be addressed in greasy tones by the mata.

The Royal Commission to Enhance the Operation and Management of the Royal
Malaysia Police has made 125 recommendations. If the crucial recommendations
objected to by police (and the force's political patrons) were to be
implemented, it might go some way towards wiping away some of the sliminess.

Among the recommendations are those on safeguarding the human rights of
detainees in police custody. This is largely an Indian community concern and
more on it in Part 2 of my article.

One other recommendation is to amend Section 27 of the Police Act 1967 which
confers on police the power to regulate assemblies, meetings and
processions.

Malaysians are curbed of freedom of assembly, be it to demonstrate against
impending toll hikes, petrol price spike and runaway inflation or to gather
for a Bersih ceramah without fearing violent dispersal. DAP
secretary-general Lim Guan Eng revealed there are 7,000 personnel in the
Special Branch. What are their policing duties, pray tell.

If it's the economy that is dearest to the Chinese heart, then the least
this economically- driven minority should expect is the right of peaceful
congregation at its chambers of commerce.

But when 'the' (I detach myself from association by refraining from saying
'our') MCA forebears bartered race dignity for their bowl of gruel, they
left a legacy that has echoed through time. Their descendants inheriting the
mythical social contract are serenaded with song of these chambers of
commerce to be burnt down and music of keris slicing the air.

Have police ever given any assurance they would protect buildings from
arsonists or the public from politicians who run amok?

What Chinese kow-tow to

The lawyers had walked and submitted a memorandum to express their loss of
confidence in the direction that the judiciary is heading. This action has
been construed by certain notables (renowned for their other enlightened
utterances) in government as being &quot;disrespectful&quot; of judges.

Taking the discussion tangentially, who or what do the Chinese respect?
Besides money, the Chinese respect authority and titles. It is abject
conditioning to a habit of fear that makes them so mindful of the pecking
order.

Lee Lam Thye's elevated 'Tan Sri' title puts him at par with the Chinese
billionaire tycoons and socially at the top of the food chain. Perhaps in
appointing Lee to the three-man Malay-Chinese- Indian panel to tackle the
Lingam tape, the government believed that Lee commanded respect and
credibility in Quadrant Two.

As someone proud to be Chinese and a denizen of this quadrant, I'm willing
to say I have no respect for Lee given his chequered history in politics. He
may be seen either as a role model for Chinese pragmatism or as a walking
example to dissuade idealism in the young. You choose.

Lee has lent his name to several government campaigns as well as the
National Service which has overseen the wasteful, unforgivable deaths of 14
teenagers and it is a programme that should not have seen the light of day.
Lee is hardly a Justice Bao to be tasked with reviewing tape or judiciary.

It is unadulterated feudalism to deem that title, authority and integrity
must necessarily be mutually inclusive. While we want a Royal Commission on
the video clip and the baggage it carries, there was the Royal Commission on
police to which there has been no discernible follow-up action - as far as
public opinion goes - for improving the trustworthiness of police.

Do we even realise how in over-legislated Malaysia and with our overpowering
police we're all easily 'criminals' in the making? Jeff Lee Kwong Yong, 19,
spent half a year in Kajang prison because he could not produce his MyKad to
show the police and could not remember his IC number. Yes, the law does
allow his punishment as such.

We can rue that there's no 'political will' to revamp our decayed
institutions. Well, it's simple; simply because establishment leaders and
their beneficiaries have a vested interest in maintaining the racket and
theirs is the will to power in perpetuity.

The will to change is to be found in Atan, Ah Kow and Arumugam ('dan
lain-lain' in NEP parlance). Crisis or no in the judiciary, where is the
Independent Police Complaints and Misconduct Commission, IPCMC? It was to
have been set up by May 2006, according to the Royal Commission's timeline.

This is the present status of the IPCMC: The Attorney-General' s chambers has
prepared the second draft of the bill. We do not know how far the AG's
version deviates from the first draft prepared and published by the Police
Royal Commission. Perhaps the PM, as minister-in- charge or Umno man
ministering to police, has some answers.
