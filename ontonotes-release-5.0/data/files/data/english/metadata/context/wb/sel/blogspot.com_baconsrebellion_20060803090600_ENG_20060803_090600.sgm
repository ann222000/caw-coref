Gregory Letiecq, the blogger behind the Northern Virginia blog "
Black Velvet Bruce Lee ," has received a cease and desist letter from
the Los Angeles law firm representing the estate of the late Bruce Lee.
Letiecq, a 42-year-old computer programmer who comments on Prince
William and Manassas politics, said he won't fight it, according to the
Manassas Journal-Messenger . He doesn't need the trouble.

I have to say, though, I love Letiecq's idea of his changing the name
to "Not Black Velvet Bruce Lee." How could the Bruce Lee estate complain
with that? The blog would explicitly state that it's NOT black velvet
Bruce Lee. No room for trademark confusion there!

(By the way, for a great laugh, view " Something to Really Complain
About .")

As blogs gain readership and prominence, expect more legal actions
against them for trademark/copyright infringement, libel, defamation,
violations of political campaign laws, or God knows what else. Welcome
to the real world, baby.

You give me even more to think about -- so far the blogosphere has
been providing me with a treasure trove of suggestions for alternative
names, and I appreciate it.

Maybe someday I'll cease being the designated whipping boy for
everyone with a legal axe to grind, but I guess that will require my
ideological opponents to get thicker skin or rack up a few losses before
they do. I guess it'll take a while before that happens.

Jim:

At the risk of being accused of being humourless, I would encourage
you to think about whether your attempt at humor in the title of this
post is up to your usual standards of professionalism and respect for
all views and all Virginians.

For my part, I think that such stereotyped, Charlie Chan style stuff
is well beneath your usual standards.

Sterotypes can be cruel, but the laugh is on us if we forget that
sterotypes get that way for a reason.

What is the sterotypical PC response to a stereotype joke? Oh, that's
right PC is a sterotype. < $BlogBacklinkSnippet$>
