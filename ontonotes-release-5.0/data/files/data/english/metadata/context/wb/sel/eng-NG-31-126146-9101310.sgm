Hi guys,

I've been driving myself nuts lately starting projects and not finishing
them. New model designs that is. Everytime I start a new design, half way
through I get another idea and start it right away and immediately lose
interest in the other one.

So far there's been the Sulaco, the Narcissus, the Mustang and the Betty. Oh
and a Toyota Supra but I gave the model to someone else for unfolding, a
nice 15 year okld kid from Dubai. The Narcissus is done but lacks textures
so I'll happily hand it over to someone toget it done if there's a kind
person who fancies detailing it??

Anyway, I wondered. Do any of you guys have the same problem with an
over-active imagination? Or not enough patience?

To my original reason for this post. Whilst looking for my older model
design to give to John Leslie for hosting I came across yet another
unfinished design. The bridge of the Enterprise-D, I'll attach some pics for
ya. I finished that one as I thought no-one would be interested in it but I
like how I've designed it so far and and asking if any of you out there
would be interested in such a model?

If so then I'll make an effort to complete it. It's almost done really, just
needs chairs and the Security post modelled and then textures.

This would be a nice match to the original enterprise that came out some time ago.

Figured I'd do some work on this while I wait for the first post to be
moderatred and that.

Added a view screen and Worf's tactical station. I also found a floor plan
of the Bridge deck and it has the Observation lounge, turbo shafts and Ready
Room so I could stretch to have add-on models for these areas??

Does anybody out there have some decent LCARS displays for the consoles?

Thanks, That's what got me to start this a while back. I even gathered the
reference for doing the movie of the 1701 and 1701-A.

I'm looking for LCARS displays at the moment ready to detail this when it's
done. I see the model being fairly simple with the chairs and consoles being
the trickiest parts.

It's &quot;not&quot; just you.

I'm only now getting around to things I set aside two and three YEARS ago.
Since my work floats around what I feel like doing at the time (3D,
Patterning, Creating Instruction Sheets) I try to keep a bunch of
projects handy.

I am glad. I feel like a prize idiot sometimes when I announce working on
something. Some people get interested but before you know it something else
gets into my head and people get dissapointed.

I'm determined to finish this one.

Thanks fellas. I thought it'd be cool but then thought it'd be daft as it
wouldn't be as impressive as say a starship sitting on your desk or display
shelf and just put it to one side.

It's reassuring to know that others would be interested in building it. As
there's only the chairs left to do and the two small displays either side of
Riker and Troi's chairs I'm just searching for decent textures for the
concoles and creating some of my own for the rest.

If you can find the CDrom &quot;Enterprise D Technical Manual Interactive&quot;
is has ALL the bridge displays in blow up photos.  It comes in Win95
and MacOS9 flavors.  There is also a CDrom called something like &quot;THE
BRIDGE&quot; and has the same thing for ALL famous Starship Bridges of the
ST universe.  A GREAT resource.

I've seen that on Amazon before. I don't have it though. I may take a look
later. The main thing is the yellow/red alert panels at the front and rear
of the bridge. Since the displays always change depending on what
information would be accessed they don't matter as much.

If anyone has the Alert panels at all it would be appreciated?

Currently trying to design:

Talon (from Stealth) - beta build

Flying HK from Terminator/2 - model pretty much finished, waiting on above.

Discovery - model in design.

Flying Wing from Raiders - reference only at this point

Nostromo - reference collected

Starship Troopers Anime &quot;Gorilla Suit&quot; - reference collected - plan is for
1/6 scale upon completion

SF3D paper models

Personal designs - in limbo

And that's the short list....

Now, what I would LIKE to build by others:

Robocop I started about 2 months ago

Thunderhawk Gunship I STARTED IN FEBRUARY!!

Eagle Transporter

B-17G from FG

Warhound Titan paper kit

Enterprise Bridge

And that also is the short list....

Hey Bill, that's quite a list you have there.

I'd love to see alot of them. Like the T2 Aerial HK, Talon and Nostromo.
Where did you get Robocop from?

David, I'm trying that link out as I type. I managed to gather quite a bit
yesterday though.

Today I'm going to try and get some of the chairs done.

Making some progress. Three chairs done, I've simplified them as much as I
can yet keep the general look. I'm going to rely on textures alot more for
this, especially the furniture.

Two pics added, one is the view from the turbo lift to the left(or right
depending on you perspective.LOL).

Hi guys,

Got the modelling done I think. They're not in this pic but the doors are
done too.

Time to unfold it now I think. If you see something wrong with what you see
just let me know.

I found a good pic of the alert status bar too.

I'm just missing the model-files ;-)

so say do you need an beta-builder ?
I just have some appetite to build the bridge :-)

the one thing i would say accodring your picture.
If you don't plan to modell the rooms touching the bridge, i would
modell the walls with a straight edge in the back. Thous would be
easyier to build as the recess and the curved walls currently

Thanks,

No, the English was fine. I'd like to add the other rooms, such as Picard's
Ready Room, Observation Lounge and Turbolifts. Also on my floor plan of the
Bridge there's a restroom to the left of the science stations at the rear of
the Bridge so I thought I'd like to add that too for laughs. I'll attach the
pic for you.

Then finally if I still have steam I'd like to attempt the ceiling of the
Bridge, with the dome and skylights.

I know as it is the outer walls look almost silly but they're like that for
a reason. Simply to allow me to later add further rooms. Though I haven't
fully thought that through yet.

Thanks for the offer of a Beta builder. I generally don't bother which I
know is bad practice so I'll take you up on that I think. :)

I thought about it and I intend to do Picards Ready Room next. I've been
busy gathering reference such as the general interior, PADDs, the laptop
typr monitor in his desk and of couse the 1701-D portrait on the wall.

So that will be the first add-on. It'll have mini PADDs for display, I'm
thinking of a very primataive papermodel of the Stargazer. I haven't decided
on a final scale for this so some things will obviously be too small to have
as individual models.

I am sorry about that, I have two copies of that one. A Bitmap and a JPG, I
attached the wrong one. I'm dial-up too and wondered why it was taking
longer than usual.

Sorry to all.

wow....okay first let me say that that enterprise D bridge REALLLY
needs completion as there are hundreds of us horses chomping at that
bit.....second....I feel finally wonderfully vindicated and not so
alone anymore on this frozen barren hoth of unfinished models.
I was very glad to know that I was not the lone survivor outpost down
here in the artic tundra land of started but abandoned
models.....yeahaaay..mind if i come in for some company kick off my
seal skin boots and have some warm coffee in the company of another
who has the same crazy deal as me, then we can swap stories of the
days of yor, when we were kids and would finish models becasue we
didnt care about the fiddly details.
happy modelling. Cory.

LOL. Too true, when I was younger I finished every model I started within a
day or too. Now even when I buy a model kit I rarely finish them even though
the hard work has already been done. Silly.

I'm determined to get this one done. It'd be daft not to as the design
itself is finished. Unfolding it will be fairly simple too so it should be
out there soon.

The model is now all unfolded and ready for a test build while I refine the
textures for the final version.

I need some help. As I said, I've infolded the model now and I'm beginning
to add the textures. Thing is I don't have the full program of Pepakura
Designer2 so can't use it to unfold  the model as you get the sample marks
all over it. So I used the first version instead.

I want to keep the model crisp and have high resolution pages so that the
LCARS screens can be seen clearly.

How can I do this? Also I've heard of things like illustrator files that
stay sharp no matter how much you reduce or enlarge an image.

Can someone help me here?

Andrew,

Apart from registering your copy to get the full functionality, you
can take those images over into Illustrator or another vector drawing
program and trace the parts. Add your textures there for stuff that
needs it. The vector parts will be cleanly scalable, but the
bitmap/raster textures will always scale up fuzzily.

Thanks. Idid find a way. I downloaded some sort of PDF printer driver, so
when I print from Pep Designer 2 instead of printing on paper it prints as a
PDF and I get the high resolution too! Then from there I copied each page
into PSP8 for adding the textures, plus it's scaled to print to A4.

What is this A4 stuff we hear about it in the US but it is hard to find.

Scale to regular 8.5 X 11 if you plan on sharing  Makes life much easier for

Paul,

The majority of the world uses A4; pretty much only the US and Canada
(I think) use US paper standards.

Unless you're adamant about maintaining the designed scale of a model,
you can just print to fit and not worry about it.

For the designers:

A4 is 210 x 297 millimeters or 8.28 x 11.69 inches.
US Letter is 216 x 279 millimeters or 8.5 x 11 inches.

Designing a model to fit within a 210 x 279 millimeter box would
ensure that it will fit both A4 and US Letter paper, though allowing a
bit around the edges is a good idea because not all printers will
print clear to the edges all around.

Fitting the parts within a box 190 x 260 millimeters gives a 10
millimeter (about 3/8 inch) border all around.

&gt; &gt; Then finally if I still have steam I'd like to attempt the ceiling of the

&gt; &gt; I know as it is the outer walls look almost silly but they're like that

&gt; &gt; &gt; I know as it is the outer walls look almost silly but they're like
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; for a reason. Simply to allow me to later add further rooms. Though I
&gt; &gt; &gt; haven't fully thought that through yet.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the offer of a Beta builder. I generally don't bother which
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; know is bad practice so I'll take you up on that I think. :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the one thing i would say accodring your picture.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you don't plan to modell the rooms touching the bridge, i would

After getting some feedback from the tstbuilds so far the model seems
in good shape. There are some issues but most can be fixed while
others are due to the size(such as small folds for Conn and Helm
consoles).

With a bit of luck it'll be available in the next few days?? Hopefully.

I'm so excited!!!

Just recieved a photo of a testbuild progress and thought I'd share it
here. This is early on in the build with the ramp being assembled and
the start of chairs and Worf's tactical station.

Apologies for the dark photo

Not sure if anyone's following this thread now. If you are, there's a
thread over at Zealot detailing the testbuild of the &quot;D&quot; bridge beta
version.

The thread can be found at: http://forum.zealot.com/t151873/

Thanks guys.

&gt; I'm so excited!!!

&gt; Just recieved a photo of a testbuild progress and thought I'd share it
&gt; here. This is early on in the build with the ramp being assembled and
&gt; the start of chairs and Worf's tactical station.

&gt; Apologies for the dark photo

&gt; &gt; After getting some feedback from the tstbuilds so far the model seems
&gt; &gt; in good shape. There are some issues but most can be fixed while
&gt; &gt; others are due to the size(such as small folds for Conn and Helm
&gt; &gt; consoles).

&gt; &gt; With a bit of luck it'll be available in the next few days?? Hopefully.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So that will be the first add-on. It'll have mini PADDs for display, I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinking of a very primataive papermodel of the Stargazer. I haven't
&gt; &gt; &gt; decided
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on a final scale for this so some things will obviously be too small to

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, the English was fine. I'd like to add the other rooms, such as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Picard's Ready Room, Observation Lounge and Turbolifts. Also on my
&gt; &gt; &gt; floor
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plan of the Bridge there's a restroom to the left of the science
&gt; &gt; &gt; stations at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rear of the Bridge so I thought I'd like to add that too for
&gt; &gt; &gt; laughs.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll attach the pic for you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then finally if I still have steam I'd like to attempt the ceiling of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bridge, with the dome and skylights.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know as it is the outer walls look almost silly but they're like
&gt; &gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a reason. Simply to allow me to later add further rooms. Though I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; haven't fully thought that through yet.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the offer of a Beta builder. I generally don't bother which
&gt; &gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know is bad practice so I'll take you up on that I think. :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just have some appetite to build the bridge :-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the one thing i would say accodring your picture.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you don't plan to modell the rooms touching the bridge, i would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; modell the walls with a straight edge in the back. Thous would be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easyier to build as the recess and the curved walls currently

Sorry, btw, I'm not the one who started that thread. A friend of mine
is writing it as he's one of the testbuilders.

Having 4 volunteers meant that I could carry on and texture the &quot;D&quot;
bridge and start the &quot;E&quot; bridge too!!

The thread length is not just you at all... but many e-mails on the
list lately have been simple one line messages, that are followed by
5 pages of quotations from the last e-mails in that thread.  No BIG
thing, but it can be annoying when set to digest mode.  :)
