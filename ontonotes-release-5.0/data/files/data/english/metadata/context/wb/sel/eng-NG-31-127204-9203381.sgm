It's probably only a short term thing. Car prices will have to come into

take action to regain their business. But presently, it is very obvious that

Middle posting depends on the post you are replying to. If it is
long and contains a large number of small points, it's almost
necessary to space the responses throughout the quoted text,
instead of putting them all at the bottom, where they would
overwhelm the reader.

They are self-appointed, like the fashion police and the political

The posting format is completely up to the person posting. But if
they don't want a lot of comments, they must stick more or less to
the established conventions.

There are always nuts who post craziness that can't even be read.
All CAPS, no punctuation, rows of symbols, solid blocks of
page-long text. I don't even bother reading posts the formatting
of which is far from the norm. Generally, they contain no
worthwhile content.

Top posting is just laziness, for the most part. I believe the
default Windows news reader automatically positions the cursor at
the top of posts, and many people can't be bothered to change it.
Or maybe some of them feel that their one-line comment would get

The readers. Most people post because they intend someone to
read it.

No-one polices conventions, but many readers, like me, skip
or kill-file those who become tedious to read. Such as those
who consistently top-post or don't snip verbiage irrelevant
to their reply.

So, if you wish to flout convention, that's fine. Just don't
get annoyed when fewer and fewer respond to your posts.

Cheers, Alan, Australia

Actually if you look rationally top posting make good sense.  The major
advantages are two fold.  First, it locates the new information at the
beginning of the message while retaining the message stream in a single
document.  To me though another significant advantage is that it
connects the identification of the person posting with the post in a
convenient manner.  For example

with top posting.

Name 3
message 3

name 2
message 2

name 1 message 1

with bottom posting

name 3

name 2

&gt; name 1

&gt;&gt; message 1

&gt;message 2

message 3

The first format makes much more sense.  If it were not for the
irrational rants of the fashion police I would use it fairly
consistently.  Alas the Neanderthals around get off into a major fit so
I use the bad format for the most part.  Unless a rational poster is the
one I am responding to.

As a real dinosaur I have no idea why the Neanderthals get their
knickers in such a twit but they do.

I agree that middle posting sometimes makes sense in the situation you note.

As far as trimming of posts is concerned given the identifications I
mention it is usually done so badly that unless line prefixes are
carefully counted individuals often appear to have said something that
is actually the responsibility of another.  Or it trims so much that you
have no idea what the message is a response to without a long search
thru the message tree.

You know, it was only recently that I discovered the &quot;Windows98

The emulation mode fixed the problem. I didn't try it when I

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Middle posting depends on the post you are replying to. If it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; long and &gt; contains a large number of small points, it's almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessary to space &gt; the responses throughout the quoted text,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; instead of putting them all at &gt; the bottom, where they would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; overwhelm the reader.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; -Al-

&gt;&gt;&gt; Besides.  I don't get the concept of 'posting police'.  Who
&gt;&gt;&gt; determines the right way to post anyway?

&gt;&gt; They are self-appointed, like the fashion police and the political
&gt;&gt; correctness police.

&gt;&gt; The posting format is completely up to the person posting. But if they
&gt;&gt; don't want a lot of comments, they must stick more or less to the
&gt;&gt; established conventions.

&gt;&gt; There are always nuts who post craziness that can't even be read. All
&gt;&gt; CAPS, no punctuation, rows of symbols, solid blocks of page-long text.
&gt;&gt; I don't even bother reading posts the formatting of which is far from
&gt;&gt; the norm. Generally, they contain no worthwhile content.

&gt;&gt; Top posting is just laziness, for the most part. I believe the default
&gt;&gt; Windows news reader automatically positions the cursor at the top of
&gt;&gt; posts, and many people can't be bothered to change it. Or maybe some
&gt;&gt; of them feel that their one-line comment would get lost at the bottom
&gt;&gt; of a huge thread, which (naturally) they do not bother to trim.

&gt;&gt; -Al-

&gt; Actually if you look rationally top posting make good sense.  The major
&gt; advantages are two fold.  First, it locates the new information at the
&gt; beginning of the message while retaining the message stream in a single
&gt; document.  To me though another significant advantage is that it
&gt; connects the identification of the person posting with the post in a
&gt; convenient manner.  For example

&gt; with top posting.

&gt; Name 3
&gt; message 3

&gt; name 2
&gt; message 2

&gt; name 1 message 1

&gt; with bottom posting

&gt; name 3

&gt; name 2

&gt;  &gt; name 1

&gt;  &gt;&gt; message 1

&gt;  &gt;message 2

&gt; message 3

&gt; The first format makes much more sense.  If it were not for the
&gt; irrational rants of the fashion police I would use it fairly
&gt; consistently.  Alas the Neanderthals around get off into a major fit so
&gt; I use the bad format for the most part.  Unless a rational poster is the
&gt; one I am responding to.

&gt; As a real dinosaur I have no idea why the Neanderthals get their
&gt; knickers in such a twit but they do.

&gt; I agree that middle posting sometimes makes sense in the situation you
&gt; note.

&gt; As far as trimming of posts is concerned given the identifications I
&gt; mention it is usually done so badly that unless line prefixes are
&gt; carefully counted individuals often appear to have said something that
&gt; is actually the responsibility of another.  Or it trims so much that you
&gt; have no idea what the message is a response to without a long search
&gt; thru the message tree.

I'd much rather see a top-poster than somebody who posts one-liners at the end
of 6 pages of quotes. And if somebody top-posts from time to time it's not the
end of the world. But they should at least cut the bottom verbiage to a
minimum! Nex

That would be good.

I'm pretty sure I won't be moving on to Vista. I'll probably go
with Ubuntu, in a year or two. I was hesitant to move up to XP
because of Product Activation, but when I found a hack that
bypassed it, I decided to give XP a try, and discovered that it is
much more stable than 98. It does have annoying features -- dozens
and dozens of processes run by default that you do not need and
will never need. I turned them all off (the nonessential ones,
that is -- some of them, you do need). That makes XP faster and
more secure to run. The default GUI is grotesque, but it can be
replaced by what is called Windows Classic GUI, which returns the
computer to the look and feel of Windows 98. All the eye candy can
be turned off, which speeds up the screen changes.

After you do all this, Windows XP is not bad. The file manager
still sucks to high heaven, but there are replacement file
managers -- I use Power Desk. You have to turn on all the hidden
stuff that Microsoft hides from users, such as some types of
files, and file terminations. They do this to make life easier for
malware writers, apparently, since it serves no other purpose. Or
harder for average users, I'm not sure which.

Vista, I've read, has more annoying product activation and
security checks, so I don't think I'll be bothered trying to get
around them. If someone comes up with a simple, easy hack that
chops all that crap out of the OS, I might try Vista, if I happen
to get a free copy somewhere ... otherwise, it won't happen. I
built my last computer specifically to avoid the &quot;Microsoft tax&quot;
as it's called, and I have no intention of paying for a copy of
Vista on my next computer. My feelings about Microsoft are similar
to my feelings about the RIAA. Lakes of fire, burning pitch, that
sort of thing ...

I see the U.S. dollar staying weak for a while, but it may be true that
the Canadian dollar will weaken in the new year. The former will be even
more so if the U.S. slips into a recession.

Just got $1,011 US$ for C$1,000 at the CIBC, getting ready to spend, spend,
spend in the USA, where prices are more sensible.

3 of my neighbours are getting ready to head south, to buy at least 3 trucks
in the USa, where they will each save at least $20,000 compared to the crooked
Canadian dealers, plus they get a holiday as well.

As for selling out Canada, who cares?
I have absolutely no sympathy for crooked scuzballs like Bumbardier, and
similar, and retailers, and Amazon.ca.
Let them all go bankrupt, and their staff unemployed, just because they are
greedy bastards.

We will just continue buying in and from the USA, where we get treated well.

duhhhh, if all retailers go bankrupt, the whole economy would crash...
so even if you are a service company, you would loose most of your
customers since they won't have cash/job anymore.

Soooo, refusing to sell to Canadians is what you call being treated
well.. interesting.

Actually, good business owners would probably emigrate, to somewhere where
they can make an honest dollar, where taxes are not so onerous, and where
welfare is not so easy for bums to obtain - such as EIRE, or Western
Australia....

I would suggest Nauru instead.

Talking about Eire, you forget to mention that they have a decent level
of living because of the billions in subsidy from the European
community. If you want to be a capitalist pig, fair enough, but be
consistent... if you don't want to give anything, don't expect to
receive anything either!

My FIRST loyalty is to myself and my family to get the BEST deal possible. Why should I enrich a bunch of
buccanneers whose only loyalty is NOT to their customers but to their being able to have 4 overseas
vacations every year, financed by customers paying way too much?
