Actually the Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society have been proven to be an
ungodly organization that has prophecised falsely for decades.

THE FALSE PROPHETS
by Joe Grossinger

One of the false claims that Jehovah's Witnesses make is that they are the
prophets of God. The Scriptures have a good test of whether a person is a
prophet or not. Please turn to Deuteronomy chapter 18 verses 21 to 22. Right
there you can read:

You may say to yourselves, &quot;How can we know when a message has not been
spoken by the Lord?&quot;  If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the LORD
does not take place or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken.
That prophet has spoken presumptuously.  Do not be afraid of him.

This and all other quotations I make are from the New International Version
of the Holy Scriptures. So, we see that anybody that claims to be a prophet
of God must be 100% accurate in his prophecy else he is not speaking for
God.
What does that have to do with the Jehovah's Witnesses? The Society
specifically calls it's leadership a &quot;prophet&quot; or &quot;prophet class&quot;, and they
also teach that JWs are a modern-day Ezekiel. So, is the Jehovah's Witness
leadership speaking God's word?  Let's see.  In 1897 in &quot;Studies In The
Scriptures, vol 4, p 621&quot; they wrote:

&quot;Our Lord, the appointed King, is now present, since October 1874.&quot;

In 1899 in &quot;The Time Is At Hand, pg 101 (1908 edition) they again wrote:

&quot;...the 'battle of the great day of God Almighty' (Revelation 16: 14), which
will end in A.D. 1914 with the complete overthrow of earth's present
rulership, is already commenced.&quot;

Please keep that date of 1914 in mind, as I will return to it again at the
end of this article. Now we move to 1916 again in &quot;The Time Is At Hand, pg
ii, (forward):

&quot;The Bible chronology herein presented show that the six great 1000 year
days
beginning with Adam are ended, and that the great 7th Day, the 1000 years of
Christ's Reign, began in 1873.&quot;

What sheer and utter nonsense! Is anybody with a rational mind to believe
that our Lord, Jesus Christ could set up His Reign on earth and nobody
noticed? Nothing changed in 1873 and onward except man became more
destructive. Let's see what they said in 1918 in &quot;Millions Now Living Will
Never Die, pg 89.

&quot;Therefore we may confidently expect that 1925 will mark the return of
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the faithful prophets of old, particularly those
named by the Apostle in Hebrews 11, to the condition of human perfection.&quot;

Well, 64 years have gone by since then and nobody noticed any great change.
In fact, the JWs changed their tune and decided 1914 was the year after all.
Again, the leadership of the JW's was barking up the wrong tree.  However,
in 1922 in &quot;The Watchtower 9/1/22, pg 262 one finds:

&quot;The date 1925 is even more distinctly indicated by the Scriptures than
1914.&quot;

Don't bother running to your Concordance to look up those dates. One can
only
find them in the imagination of the JW leadership.

In 1923 the suspense really builds when The Watchtower (4/1/23, pg 106)
states:

&quot;Our thought is, that 1925 is definitely settled by the Scriptures.  As to
Noah, the Christian now has much more upon which to base his faith than Noah
had upon which to base his faith in a coming deluge.&quot;

Now we get to 1925 and here is what they wrote in &quot;The Watchtower 1/1/25,
pg 3:

&quot;The year 1925 is here. With great expectation Christians have looked
forward
to this year. Many have confidently expected that all members of the body of
Christ will be changed to heavenly glory during this year.  This may be
accomplished. It may not be. In his own due time God will accomplish his
purposes concerning his people. Christians should not be so deeply concerned
about what may transpire this year.&quot;

Sure people have been expecting the return of the Lord in 1925! The JW
leadership had been talking and writing about it since 1918. With the
promise of the imminent return of our Lord they had been swelling their
membership rosters for eight years. Now, that 1925 has arrived, they begin
to prepare their membership for the inevitable let down.  Compare the
statements made in 1925 with those made in 1923 and you can see their
deliberate attempt to white wash their statements. In 1931, in their
Vindication publication on page 338 the leadership almost sounds as if they
had gotten some &quot;religion&quot; about fixing dates because they write:

&quot;There was a measure of disappointment on the part of Jehovah's faithful
ones
on earth concerning the years 1914, 1918, &amp; 1925, which disappointment
lasted for a time... and they also learned to quit fixing dates.&quot;

I would venture to say that &quot;a measure of disappointment&quot; was the
understatement of the year. What they really meant so say was that the
membership roster was getting awful thin and so was the bank balance.
Still, by 1941 all was forgotten and the Watchtower (9/15/41 pg 288) was
back in the prophecy business. Here is what they say:

&quot;Receiving the gift, the marching children clasped it to them, not a toy or
plaything for idle pleasure, but the Lord's provided instrument for most
effective work in the remaining months before Armageddon.&quot;

Well, of course 1941 came and went and so have a lot of years since then.
Again the Jehovah's Witnesses were wrong and again they have an explanation
as we can see in the October 1968 issue of Awake where they write:

&quot;True, there have been those in times past who predicted an 'end to the
world', even announcing a specific date. Yet nothing happened.  The 'end'
did not come. They were guilty of false prophesying. Why?  What was missing?
...Missing from such people were God's truths and the evidence that he was
using and guiding them.&quot;

Neat little two-step that was. OK, twice now the JW's leaders say they ought
to quit setting dates. If they learned then why did they write in The
Watchtower (8/15/68, pg 494):

&quot;Why are you looking forward to 1975?&quot;

As you can see, the leadership of the Jehovah's Witnesses never does learn.
They go off half-cocked time and time again. I would even venture it fair to
state that it won't be long before they do it again.  Look what Jesus has to
say about people like this in Luke 21:8:

He replied: &quot;Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my
name, claiming, 'I am he' and, 'The time is near.' Do not follow them.

Do not follow them, because they are not of the Lord. They don't even admit
that Jesus is God Almighty. They claim our Lord was created by God.  That
Jesus is another creation of God, in fact an angel. The JWs claim that Jesus
is the Archangel Michael is totally blown apart by Paul in Colossians 2:18-
19. Where Paul states:

Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels
disqualify you for the prize. Such a person goes into great detail about
what he has seen, and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions.

I think the warning to the unwary is clear and unequivocal. Avoid them at
all
cost. I have quoted prediction after prediction of the Lord's return right
out of the Jehovah's Witness Society's own publications. I have shown where
they make predictions, are proven wrong, state that one should not make any
predictions and then they go right ahead and make more predictions
concerning the imminent return of the Lord. In their book, &quot;You Can Live
Forever in Paradise on Earth&quot; dated 1982, page 154 they again state:

&quot;Also, the Bible said that all these things would happen upon the generation
that was alive in 1914.&quot;

&quot;These things&quot; they are talking about here is the return of our Lord Jesus.
Then they go on to say:

&quot;Those persons yet remaining of that generation are now very old. However,
some of them will still be alive to see the end of this wicked system. So of
this we can be certain: Shortly now there will be a sudden end to all
wickedness and wicked people at Armageddon.&quot;

Old? I'll say. Since this is now 1989 a person born in 1914 would now be 75
years old. It's beginning to look like the JW leadership is going to have to
do another two-step pretty soon. Well, you say &quot;ok, they make a lot of wrong
predictions, is that so bad?&quot;

Yes it is, because all of their awful predictions that never come true point
out the fact that the JW leadership really can not accurately teach the word
of God. They simply go wrong when they read the Bible! You don't have to be
a mental giant to understand that if these people can be so terribly
mistaken
about one Bible subject for so many years then all of their teachings must
be
suspect.  As Paul warned the Colossians, avoid these people at all cost. Do
not trust them to bring you the word of God. With all the crazy predictions
the Jehovah's Witness Society has made, they kind of stuck with 1914 to
explain away their failures. They now say that Jesus did indeed come in 1914
but He set up His rule in the sky. How can anybody teach such blatant and
bald-faced heresy? It's just like it was back in 1873. Jesus is supposed to
have set up His Reign and nobody noticed!  Please, do not be led astray by
these false prophets. Study the word of God and if you have not already,
join
a regular Christian church.

From: James White
To: Brian Blad
Subj: 1914, 1975, etc.

BB&gt; As to 1975, I looked at all the references, and I did not find any
BB&gt; official statement of the society that 1975 was it.

According to this trustworthy Bible chronology six thousand
years from man's creation will end in 1975, and the seventh
period of a thousand years of human history will begin in
the fall of 1975 C.E.
-!-Life Everlasting in Freedom of the Sons of God, p. 29

From the most reliable investigations of Bible chronology,
harmonizing with many accepted dates of secular history, we
find that Adam was created in the autumn of the year 4026
B.C.E.  Sometime in that same year Eve could well have been
created, directly after which God's rest day commenced.  In
what year, then, would the first 6,000 years of man's
existence and also the first 6,000 years of God's rest day
come to an end?  The year 1975.  This is worthy of notice,
particularly in view of the fact that the &quot;last days&quot; began
in 1914, and that the physical facts of our day in fulfill-
ment of prophecy mark this as the last generation of this
wicked world.
-!-Awake! magazine of October 8, 1966, p. 19

But, without a doubt, nothing has created more interest
in this textbook than the first chapter with its chart and
fine information regarding the 7,000 years of God's rest
day.  The observation that 1975 may well mark the beginning
of mankind's great Jubilee has intrigued many.
-!-Watchtower magazine of January 1, 1967, p. 29

The May 1, 1968 Watchtower (pages 272-273) throws more fuel upon the
fire by specifically raising the question of Armageddon taking place in
1975.  While not taking a firm stand, the article presents the
possibility as the clear indication of &quot;Bible chronology.&quot;  A few
months later, the Watchtower of August 15, 1968 ran a lengthy article
entitled &quot;Are You Looking Forward to 1975?&quot;  The article repeats the
assertion (found in the earlier articles) that the time between Adam's
creation and Eve's &quot;need not have been a long time.  It could have been
a rather short one.&quot;  This will be important in examining the excuses
made by the Society in 1976.  Then we read:

One thing is absolutely certain, Bible chronology reinforced
with fulfilled Bible prophecy shows that six thousand years
of man's existence will soon be up, yes, within this
generation! (Matt. 24:34)  This is, therefore, no time to be
indifferent and complacent.  This is not the time to be
toying with the words of Jesus that &quot;concerning that day and
hour nobody knows, neither the angels in the heavens nor the
Son, but only the Father.&quot; (Matt 24:36)  To the contrary, it
is a time when one should be keenly aware that the end of
this system of things is rapidly coming to its violent end.

More articles appeared--10/15/69 Watchtower, pages 622-623; 10/8/71
Awake! pages 26-27.  The excitement grew--fed by these tidbits from
Brooklyn.  Some today say that &quot;some of the brethren simply became
overzealous.&quot;  That is ridiculous.   The conclusion that 1975 would be
the end was clear from the materials that WTBTS was printing.  Notice
the _Kingdom Ministry_ (a publication reserved for Jehovah's Witnesses
and not distributed to the public) of May, 1974:

Yes, the end of this system is so very near!  Is that not
reason to increase our activity?...Yes, since the summer of
1973 there have been new peaks in pioneers every month.  Now
there are 20,394 regular and special pioneers in the United
States, an all-time peak.  This is 5,190 more than there were
in February 1973!  A 34-percent increase!  Does that not warm
our hearts?  Reports are heard of brothers selling their homes
and property and planning to finish out the rest of their days
in this old system in the pioneer service.  Certainly this is a
fine way to spend the short time remaining before the wicked
world's end.

Things could hardly be clearer!  There is no word of warning from the
Society in the above quotation--instead, one finds the Organization
feeding upon the frenzy produced by its publications.  And the WTBTS
prospered!  Yes, over a million people *left* the Society in the years
following 1975--but the overall growth rate of the Society was much
improved by the 1975 push.

When 1975 came--and went--just as 1914, 1915, 1918 and 1925 had
done in the past--the Society produced its &quot;reason&quot; for the delay.
It's quite simple, actually: there was a delay, they said, between the
creation of Adam, and the creation of Eve.  To this day, that &quot;delay&quot;
is now about 16 years!  Of course, this was in direct contradiction to
what the Society had said earlier--their _Aid to Bible Understanding_
book had directly asserted that Eve was created in the *same year* as
Adam (compare the age of Seth as found on page 538, bottom left column,
with chart on page 333, bottom right column).  When the Society
replaced the _Aid_ book recently, they used the material from the
chronology section nearly word-for-word--with the exception of those
passages that directly discussed 1975.  Those passages were &quot;emended&quot;
(without note, of course).

The duplicity of the Society can be seen in comparing the 1968
edition of the book, _The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life_ with the
1981 edition.  In quoting Dean Acheson, United States Secretary of
State, from a Newsweek article of October 9, 1967, the *original*
version read:

Also, as reported back in 1960, a former United States
Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, declared that our time is &quot;a
period of unequaled instability, unequaled violence.&quot;  And he
warned:  &quot;I know enough of what is going on to assure you that,
in fifteen years from today, this world is going to be too
dangerous to live in.&quot;

Note:  1960 + 15 years = 1975.  Now note the 1981 edition:

Also, as reported back in 1960, a former United States
Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, declared that our time is &quot;a
period of unequaled instability, unequaled violence.&quot;  Based on
what he knew was then going on in the world, it was his
conclusion that soon &quot;this world is going to be too dangerous
to live in.&quot;

Note the reference to 1975 has been subtly removed--again, with no
note to explain the deletion.

JW&gt; Again, Brian, you say that the Society makes mistakes.  OK, that's
JW&gt; fine--but when the Society makes those &quot;mistakes&quot; in the name of
JW&gt; Jehovah God, and teaches these &quot;mistakes&quot; as the truth of Jehovah God,
JW&gt; do you really think that their claim to be &quot;Jehovah's only organization
JW&gt; on earth&quot; holds water?  I do not believe so--and when someone claims to
JW&gt; speak exclusively for Jehovah, I, for one, do not believe that their
JW&gt; past history is &quot;irrelevant.&quot;

BB&gt; Every human makes mistakes.

Yes, every human makes mistakes.  But when a human says that he is
speaking in the name of Jehovah God, that removes from him the excuse,
&quot;well, it was just a mistake.&quot;  As the Awake of October 8, 1968 put it:

True, there have been those in times past who predicted an &quot;end
to the world,&quot; even announcing a specific date....Yet, nothing
happened.  The &quot;end&quot; did not come.  They were guilty of false
prophesying.

JW&gt; Then you admit that the Society is but a human organization?
BB&gt;
BB&gt; Yes, all Witnesses do, But we also recognize that it has God's backing
BB&gt; and direction, although it is not by &quot;direct revelation&quot;

From the 1939 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses:

It should be expected that the Lord would have a means of
communication to his people on the earth, and he has
clearly shown that the magazine called The Watchtower is used
for that purpose (p. 85).

In 1955, when current WTBTS president Fred Franz was asked &quot;At any
rate, Jehovah God is now the editor of the paper, is that right?&quot; Franz
responded, &quot;He is today the editor of the paper [i.e., The Watchtower].

In the same trial Nathan Knorr was asked about The Watchtower:  &quot;In
fact, it is set forth directly as God's Word, isn't it?&quot;  Knorr
replied, &quot;Yes, as His word.&quot;  The questioner then asked, &quot;Without any
qualifications whatsoever?&quot;  Knorr replied, &quot;That is right.&quot;

The January 15, 1969 Watchtower said:

Jesus foretold that among his people there would be a &quot;faithful
and discreet slave&quot; class who would be providing the spiritual
food to God's family of devoted servants on earth, acting as
*his channel of communications* and overseeing the carrying out
of the Kingdom interests world wide (p. 31).

There is much more I could mention, Brian:  the Society's referring to
itself as our &quot;mother,&quot; and all sorts of things.  I think the viewpoint
taken by the Witnesses long ago remains today:

Furthermore...people cannot see the Divine Plan in studying
the Bible by itself....if he then lays them [the six volumes of
the _Studies in the Scriptures_] aside and ignores them and
goes to the Bible alone, though he has understood his Bible for
ten years, our experience shows that within two years he goes
into darkness.  On the other hand, it he had merely read the
Scripture Studies with their references, and had not read a
page of the Bible, as such, he would be in the light at the end
of two years, because he would have the light of the
Scriptures.  (Watchtower, 9/15/1910).

This is still true today--think about it, Brian:  how many pages of the
Watchtower's writings are you to read in a year?  And how many pages of
the Bible in comparison?  When you do a study with someone, do you
study a book of the Bible, say, Romans, or do you study a Watchtower
publication that is ostensibly *about* the Bible?

BB&gt; Which part of 1914 James?

Well, there are a number of false parts: the interpretation of Daniel 4
is false--the book of Daniel itself refutes the WTBTS interpretation.
But, most obviously, the entire scheme is based upon saying Jerusalem
fell in 607--it didn't, it fell in 586.  The Society knows this, but
has purposefully changed history to hide the facts.

BB&gt; That the Christ took his heavenly throne in
BB&gt; 1914, no I would not as the composite sign has/is being fulfilled
BB&gt; exactly as Christ stated it would when he was ruling in Kingdom
BB&gt; power. I'm not familiar with other statements regarding 1914.

...the &quot;battle of the great day of God Almighty&quot; (Rev. 16:14),
which will end in A.D. 1914 with the complete overthrow of
earth's present rulership, is already commenced.
-!-The Time is At Hand, 1888, p. 101

And doesn't this sound very much like Witnesses today, Brian:

...yet so great is our confidence in the Word of God and in the
light of present truth shining upon it, that we could not have
doubted its testimony whatever had been the appearances.  The
date of the close of that &quot;battle&quot; is definitely marked in
Scripture as October, 1914.  It is already in progress, its
beginning dating from October, 1874.
-!-Zion's Watch Tower, 1/15/1892

And who can miss the parallel between these words and those used to
stir up excitement about 1975:

For instance, as we look back and note that the Scriptures
marked 1873 as the end of six thousand years from ADam to the
beginning of the seventh thousand, and the fall of 1874 as the
beginning of the forty-year harvest of the Gospel age and day
of wrath for the overthrow of all the institutions of &quot;this
present evil world..., we can see that *facts* have well borne
out those predictions of Scripture.
-!-Zion's Watch Tower, 7/1/1894

The same year the Society said that &quot;they are...God's dates, not ours.&quot;

Finally, as to the belief that Jesus returned invisibly in 1874:

Surely there is not the slightest room for doubt in the mind of
a truly consecrated child of God that the Lord Jesus is present
and has been since 1874.
-!-Watch Tower, 1/1/24, p. 5

To understand the events concerning the Lord's second presence
from 1874 to 1914 requires one to be spiritually minded; and
the clergy are not spiritually minded.
-!-Creation, 1927, p. 291

Today, if one is &quot;spiritually minded&quot; one believes that Christ returned
in 1914, right, Brian?

Some Watchtower Doctrine to Be Noted
by David Powell

When the Watchtower states something as unequivocally from God they lose the
right to then state that there was a misunderstanding of prophecy.  When the
prophets of old stated a word from God it always happened.  If they stated
something as being from God and it did not happen then they were put to
death
as a false prophet.  No man is perfect but God's word is.  If it is used
falsely then that person is a false prophet.  Study the history of the
Watchtower closely and see just how far it was from God in the beginning and
still is today.

Watchtower Doctrine:

1.  The Watchtower Society claims to be the only organization upon
earth guided by God's Holy Spirit, and the only organization capable
of understanding the meaning of the Holy Scriptures.
(The Watchtower, July 1, 1973, page 402)

2.  They claim: &quot;That the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, is God's
sole collective channel, for the flow of biblical truth to men on
earth in these last days.&quot;
(The Watchtower, July 15, 1960, page 439)

3.  The Jehovah's Witness is taught: &quot;That they must adhere absolutely to
the decisions and scriptural understandings of the Society because
God
has given it this authority over his people.&quot;
(The Watchtower, May 1st, 1972, page 272)

4.  In order to gain Eternal Life, the Jehovah's witness is told that
certain things are necessary - as follows:
a.  They should study the bible diligently, but only through Watchtower
publications.
b.  They should attend all five meetings each week.
c.  They should devote as many hours as possible to the ministry work.
d.  They should only associate with other Jehovah's Witnesses.
e.  They should be baptized. They are then told: &quot;That all of these
things, and more, must accompany faith, because the earning of the
reward of eternal life, requires 'hard work'.&quot;

(The Watchtower, Aug.  15, 1972, pages 491 through 497.) (Please Note:
Nowhere does the bible speak of Eternal Life as a reward but rather as a
Gift.  [Romans 6:23: &quot;The gift of God...&quot;])

5. To them, and them alone, the bible is not a sealed book.
(The Watchtower, July 1, 1973.)

6.  The year 1975 would mark the end of six thousand years of rebellion
against God.
(The Awake, January 8, 1968, page 19.)

7.  1975 will mark the end of 6000 years of human history since Adam's
creation.
(The Watchtower, Aug.  15, 1968, page 494.)

8. In A.D. 1914, The Kingdom of God was to be set up in the earth.
(The Watchtower, 1880, page 82.)

9.  &quot;In A.D. 1914, the Kingdom of God will be firmly established in earth
on the ruins of present institutions...&quot; also &quot;He whose right it is
to take dominion, will then be present as 'Earth's New Ruler'.&quot;
(The Time is at Hand, pages 76-78)

I have included the date, page and location of each, thereby avoiding any
possible refutation by Watchtower members.

The Watchtower's Attitude Towards The Bible

W.T.  May 1, 1957, page 273 stated:

&quot;Jehovah God has provided His holy written word for all mankind and it
contains all the information that is needed for men in taking a course
leading to life.  But God has not arranged for that word to speak
independently, or to shine forth life giving truths by itself.  His word
says, &quot;Light is sown for the righteous&quot; (Psalm 97:11).  It is through his
organization that God provides this light that the prophet says is the
teaching or law of the mother.  If we walk in the light of truth, we must
recognize not only Jehovah God as our father, but his organization as our
mother.&quot;

W.T.  Oct. 1, 1967, page 587 stated:

&quot;Thus the Bible is an organizational book and belongs to the Christian
congregation as an organization, not to individuals, regardless of how
sincerely they may believe that they can interpret the Bible.  For this
reason the Bible cannot be proper understood without  Jehovah's visible
organization in mind.&quot;

W.T.  Sept. 15, 1910, page 298 stated:

&quot;Furthermore, not only do we find that people cannot see the divine plan
in studying the Bible by itself, but we see, also, that if anyone lays the
&quot;Scripture Studies&quot; (Russell's writings) aside, even after he has used them,
after he has read them for ten years...if he then lays them aside and
ignores
them and goes to the Bible alone, though he has understood his Bible for ten
years, our experience shows that within two years he goes into darkness.&quot;

In the Scriptures it states. 2 Tim 2:15; &quot;Study to show thyself approved
unto
God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word
of truth.&quot;

We do not need an organization such as the Watchtower to tell us what the
Bible says.  All we need to do is read it for ourselves and allow the Holy
Spirit to give us understanding!

Prophecies of the Watchtower Society of Jehovah's Witnesses.

JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES CLAIM TO BE PROPHETS

The Watchtower of April 1st, 1972, page 197, had this statement,
&quot;So, does Jehovah have a prophet to help them, to warn them dangers and
to declare things to come?...These questions can be answered in the
affirmative. Who is the prophet?...This &quot;prophet&quot; was not one man, but
was a body of men and women. It was the small group of footstep
followers of Jesus Christ, known at that time as International Bible
students. Today they are known as Jehovah's Christian witnesses...Of
course it is easy to say that this group acts as a &quot;prophet&quot; of God. It
is another thing to prove it. The only way that this can be done is to
review the record. What does it show?

Since the J.W.'s claim to be God's prophet, we are free to put them
to the Bible test for a prophet, found in Deuteronomy 18:18-20. Verse
22 of this same chapter says, &quot;When a prophet speaks in the name of the
LORD (YHWH), if the thing does not come about or come true, that is the
thing which the LORD has not spoken.&quot; Verse 20 plainly says, &quot;that
prophet shall die&quot;.

False prophecy cannot be &quot;explained away&quot; and treated lightly. The
Watchtower has invited us to examine their record, and we will! All
quotes are from publications of the Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society
and available at headquarters in Brooklyn, New York. Some of these
publications may also be found in local Kingdom Hall libraries. Judge
this self-proclaimed &quot;prophet&quot; for yourselves!

6,000 YEARS OF HUMAN HISTORY OF PROPHECIES

6,000 years of human history ended in 1873. (The Time is at Hand,
p.33). 6,000 years of human history ended in 1972. (The Truth Shall
Make You Free, p. 152, 1943 edition). 6,000 years of human history
ended in 1975. (Awake!, October 8th, 1968.)

ARMAGEDDON PROPHECIES

Armageddon would end in 1914. (The Time is At Hand, Page 101, 1889
Edition). Armageddon would end in 1915. (The Time is At Hand, Page 101,
1915 Edition).

Today, J.W.'s expect Armageddon any minute!

THE RETURN OF CHRIST PROPHECIES

Since Christ failed to show up for any of the Watchtower dates,
J.W.'s altered their teaching to make his coming conveniently
&quot;invisible&quot;.

Christ returned in 1874. (The Finished Mystery, pages 386, 295, 1917
Edition). The Watchtower publications taught this 1874 date right up to
1929. The &quot;Prophecy&quot; book, published in 1929, states on page 65, &quot;The
Scriptural proof is that the second presence of the Lord Jesus Christ
began in 1874 A.D.&quot;

Christ returned in 1914. (The Truth that Leads to Eternal Life, p.
87).

THE MILLENNIUM PROPHECIES

The Millennium began in 1873. (Thy Kingdom Come, page 305). The
Millennium began in 1874. (Finished Mystery, page 386).

PROPHECIES ON THE RESURRECTION

The resurrection would occur in 1878. (Thy Kingdom Come, page 234).

Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the faithful prophets of old would return
in 1925. (Millions Now Living Will Never Die, page 89).

The Watchtower Society even published a book telling their followers
to add a room onto their houses, and get an undertaker to decorate it.
Undertakers, of course, would be looking for employment, since there
would be no more deaths in 1926. When the room was completed,
Watchtower devotees were to call up Jerusalem, where Abraham would have
an office, and request that their parents be &quot;awakened&quot; from death.
They would soon appear in the new room! (The Way to Paradise, pages
228, 229).

PROPHECIES ON SPACE TRAVEL

&quot;Man cannot by airplane or rockets or other means get above the air
envelope which is about our earthly globe...&quot;(The Truth Shall Make you
Free, p. 285, 1943 edition).

THE BOOK OF RUTH

The Book of Ruth is &quot;not prophetical&quot;. (Watchtower Reprints IV, p.
3110, Nov. 15, 1902). The Book of Ruth &quot;is prophetic&quot;. (Watchtower
Book, &quot;Preservation&quot;, pages 169, 175, 176).

PROPHECIES ON SODOM AND GOMORRAH

Sodom and Gomorrah will receive a second opportunity. (Man of Ages,
page 110).

Sodom and Gomorrah will receive no second opportunity. (Watchtower,
March 1965, p. 139).

THE &quot;HIGHER POWERS&quot; OF ROMANS 13:1

&quot;Higher Powers&quot; refers to earthly governments. (The Time is at Hand
(1889) p. 81).

&quot;Higher Powers&quot; refers to Jehovah God and Jesus. (The Truth Shall
Make You Free, p. 312).

&quot;Higher Powers&quot; refers to earthly governments. (Man's Salvation...at
Hand p. 326). Notice how the &quot;brighter light&quot; dimmed back again!

THE REVELATION NAME &quot;ABADDON-APOLLYON&quot;

Refers to Satan. (Studies in the Scriptures, Vol.7). Refers to Jesus
Christ. (Then is Finished the Mystery of God, Page 232). Quite a change!

THE &quot;ALPHA AND OMEGA&quot; OF REVELATION

Refers to Jehovah God. (Awake! August 22, 1978, page 28). Refers to
Jesus Christ. (Watchtower, October 1, 1978, p.15).

Notice the rapid change of &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;interpretation of scripture&quot;
in just two months!

THE FAITHFUL AND DISCREET SLAVE

Refers to their founder, Charles Taze Russell. (Watchtowers from
Dec. 1, 1916 to March 1, 1923, p. 68).

Refers to the &quot;Remnant of Spiritual Israelites&quot; (the supposed
remnant of the 144,000 &quot;heavenly class&quot;). (From Paradise Lost to
Paradise Regained, page 193).

IN CONCLUSION

Although the official publication of the Jehovah's Witnesses claims,
&quot;...Jehovah's Witnesses today make their declaration of the good news
of the kingdom under angelic direction and support&quot; according to the
Watchtower of April 1, 1972, page 200, they have proved to be an
embarrassment to the angels!

Undaunted, the Watchtower of July 1st, 1973, page 402, goes on to
claim, &quot;Consider too, the fact that Jehovah's organization alone in all
the earth is directed by God's holy spirit or active force.&quot;

Obviously the Holy Spirit did not prompt these false prophecies!

Not only does the Bible give us a simple test for prophets, which we
considered at the beginning of this tract, namely that their prophecies
will fail, but the word of God has more to say about prophecies and
prophesying.

The Bible reveals three sources for prophecy. One, it is from God,
and inspired by Him. Two, it is from the Devil and inspired by him.
Thirdly, prophecies can come out of &quot;the flesh&quot;, or out of our &quot;own
spirit&quot;.

Since the Watchtower Society of Jehovah's Witnesses has so many
failed prophecies, we know they are not prophesying by God's direction,
and through His Holy Spirit, or by the angels.

This leaves us with two alternatives for the false prophecies of the
Watchtower Society. They are from Satan, or they are from &quot;the flesh&quot;.

The Watchtower has chosen the latter, claiming that &quot;we all make
mistakes&quot; etc. &quot;We have new light&quot;. Is this an &quot;out&quot; for them? No, for
Jehovah's Witnesses should carefully read Ezekiel, chapter 13. This
chapter is a judgment of God on prophets who hope for a fulfillment of
their words, after prophesying falsely. Verse 8, says, &quot;Because you
have spoken falsehood and seen a lie, therefore, behold, I am against
you&quot;, declared the Lord God.&quot;

The Watchtower Society of Jehovah's Witnesses is a proven false
prophet, and the Lord, by His own decree, is against them.

WHAT THE WATCHTOWER DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT BETH-SARIM!
by Jim L. Toungate Jr.

In the year 1926, under the leadership of Joseph F. Rutherford,
and the then Watch Tower (since changed to Watchtower) Bible &amp;
Tract Society, purchased two lots. Lot One Hundred and Ten (110)
and lot One Hundred and Eleven (111) in Kensignton Heights unit
No.2, in the County of San Diego, State of California.

This in its self does not seem strange. It is what the lots were
purchased for that is strange. The two lots were purchased to
build a mansion, but not just any mansion, a mansion called Beth-
Sarim (Hebrew for House of Princes).

So what was the purpose of buiding Beth-Sarim? Rutherford and all
those who followed him believed in a Watchtower prophecy that said
in 1925 ALL of the men mentioned in the Book of Hebrews the
eleventh chapter would be resurrected

&quot;We may confidently expect that 1925 will mark
the return of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and all
the prophets of old, particularly those named
by the Apostle in Hebrews chapter eleven, to
the condition of human perfection.&quot;

Millions Now Living Will Never Die (1920),pp.88-90

The Watchtower stated in 1922 that &quot;this chronology is not of man,
but of God.&quot; The Watchtower (July 17, 1922), p. 217

So, if God said it, it should be able to pass the test of a true
prophet set forth in Deuteronomy chapter 18 verses 21 and 22 which
read:
Deu 18:21 And if thou say in thin heart, how shall we know
the word which the Lord hath spoken?

Deu 18:22 When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord,
if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the
thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath
spoken it presumtuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.

When the prophecy didn't come true in 1925 the Watchtower admitted,
&quot;It may not be. In his own due time God will accomplish his
purposes concerning his own people.&quot; The Watchtower (Jan. 1, 1925)
p.3

So, in 1930, the Watchtower built Beth-Sarim as a testimony of
their faith in God that this would come to pass and as a place for
the men mentioned in Hebrews chapter eleven to rule God's
Theocratic Kingdom from during Armageddon. &quot;Judge&quot; Rutherford
convieniantly set it up in the title and deed to Beth-Sarim so that
he and his assistants could live in the palatial mansion until his
death or the return of the men in Hebrews. At the time of their
return, the estate was to be turned over to them for the rest of
eternity to live and rule as a visible presence in Paradise.

In the title and deed filed on the 24th of May, 1926 it states of
this:

&quot;The condition set herein is that the said WATCHTOWER
BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY shall hold said title
PERPETUALLY  in trust for the use ofany or all of the
men aboved named as representativesof God's Kingdom on
earth.&quot;

In another part of the title it states:

&quot;This property has been aquired and the improvements
built thereon at the instance and under the direction
of the said Joseph F. Rutherford and dedicated to
Jehovah God and to His King Christ who is the rightful
ruler of the earth and for the express purpose of being
used by those who are servants of Jehovah God. For this
reason the provision is made in this deed that the
property shall be FOREVER used for the purpose subject
to any encumberance that may have been palced thereupon.&quot;

So, according to the above statements in the title and deed, the
Watchtower Bible and Tract Society should still own Lot One Hundred
and Ten and Lot One Hundred and eleven upon which Beth-Sarim was
built, right?

Joseph F. Rutherford, passed away on the 8th of January, 1942. Soon
thereafter Beth-Sarim was sold and is no longer owned or possessed
by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society.

Can events of this magnitude within the Society be so easily
forgotten? Can it be so easily swept under the rug? Or was it just
simply &quot;another mistake&quot; made by &quot;fallible men&quot;?

The Watchtower seems to think so. I have not met a Jehovah's
Witness yet, who knew of Beth-Sarim's existance before I informed
them of it. The Watchtower has long been succesfull at covering up
and erasing their embarrasing &quot;mistakes.&quot;

So this article was written as a gentle reminder of Beth-Sarim for
unaware Jehovah's Witnesses and for the people who's door's they
come knocking on.

Due 18:22 When a prophet speaketh in the name of the
Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that
is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the
prophet hath spoken it presumtuously: thou be not afraid
of him.

The above verse of scripture says that if the prophecy fails to
come to pass, it is something which the LORD hath NOT spoken!
It says nothing about admitting you made a mistake, or that men
are fallible. Only if it does not come to pass it is a FALSE
PROPHECY!

BETH SARIM - HOME OF THE PROPHETS?

In anticipation of the soon to be resurrected biblical prophets
and patriarchs, Joseph Rutherford, president of the Watchtower
Bible and Tract Society commissioned the construction of a house
in San Diego, California. This house was to become home for
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, David, Samuel and all the
rest mentioned in Hebrews chapter 11. However, when the biblical
party failed to appear, the embarrassing Beth-Sarim incident had
to be repressed.

Beginning in 1920, Rutherford declared, &quot;As we have heretofore
stated, the great jubilee cycle is due to begin in 1925. At that
time the earthly phase of the kingdom shall be recognized.&quot; How
would it be recognized? What event would trigger the ushering in
of the kingdom?

Rutherford explained, &quot;Therefore we may confidently expect that
1925 will mark the return of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the
faithful prophets of old, particularly those named by the Apostle
in Hebrews chapter eleven, to the condition of human perfection&quot;
(Millions Now Living Will Never Die, pp. 89-90).

This was an exciting prophecy. Jehovah's Witnesses around the
world anticipated their cause being justified by the physical
manifestation of these biblical patriarchs. When 1925 did come,
but Abraham and the rest did not, some of Rutherford's followers
left the fold. Others still believed that though they were late
in their anticipated time of arrival, the Hebrews 11 crew would
be back shortly. Even though it had not occurred by 1929, it was
still a topic of much excited anticipation.

For this reason, Rutherford, realizing that when Abraham and
company did finally show-up they were going to need a home, he
gave instructions to build them a house. In his book, Salvation,
Rutherford mentions this house and its purpose for being built.

&quot;At San Diego, California, there is a small piece of land, on
which, in the year 1929, there was built a house, which is called
and known as Beth Sarim. The Hebrew words Beth Sarim mean `House
of the Princes;' and the purpose of acquiring that property and
building the house was that there might be some tangible proof
that there are those on earth today who fully believe God and
Christ Jesus and in His kingdom, and who believe that the
faithful men of old will soon be resurrected by the Lord, be back
on earth, and take charge of the visible affairs of earth&quot; (p.
311).

With the house now built, there was nothing to do but wait. And
wait they did, until 1942.

As Rutherford wrote the last book of his life, he again mentioned
Beth-Sarim and Abraham, et.al. He wrote, &quot;¼hence those faithful
men of old may be expected back from the dead any day now. The
Scriptures give good reason to believe that it shall be shortly
before Armageddon breaks.

&quot;In this expectation the house at San Diego, California, which
house has been much publicized with malicious intent by the
religious enemy, was built, in 1930, and named `Beth-Sarim,'
meaning `House of the Princes.' It is now held in trust for the
occupancy of those princes on their return&quot; (The New World, p.
104).

Notice that Rutherford said it was &quot;held in trust.&quot; Actually, the
deed has several very interesting points. It explains, &quot;that
(the) kingdom of God will have visible representatives on the
earth who will have charge of the affairs of the nations under
the supervision of the invisible ruler Christ; that among those
who will thus be the faithful representatives and visible
governors of the world will be David, Israel; and Gideon, and
Barak, and Samson, and Jepthae, and Joseph, formerly the ruler of
Egypt, and Samuel the prophet and other faithful men who were
named with approval in the Bible at Hebrews the eleventh chapter.

&quot;The condition herein is that the said Watchtower Bible and Tract
Society shall hold said title perpetually in trust for the use of
any or all of the men above named as representatives of God's
kingdom on earth and that such men shall have possession and use
of said property hereinabove described as they may deem for the
best interest for the work in which they are engaged.&quot;

However, there was a conditional clause placed in the deed. Until
David, Abraham or someone else arrived, &quot;the said Joseph F.
Rutherford in such lease or other paper writing shall have the
right and privilege of residing on said premises until the same
be taken possession of by David or some of the other men herein
named and this property and premises being dedicated to Jehovah
and the use of his kingdom it shall be used as such for ever&quot;
(deed dated 24 December 1929).

The deed, which was signed by Rutherford, has three noteworthy
items in it.

First, Beth-Sarim was built for the express purpose of housing
the patriarchs.

Second, though Rutherford could live in the house, he could only
do so until someone from Hebrews 11 arrived.

Third, the Beth-Sarim house was to remain in Jehovah's kingdom
use perpetually. Thus, the Watchtower would certainly have this
property forever.

Perhaps it is not necessary to explain, but no one from Hebrews
11 ever arrived to take charge of the Beth-Sarim property. As a
result, Rutherford spent the last years of his life in this
beautiful mansion while his followers suffered in poverty during
the Great Depression of the 1930's.

Further, a few years after Rutherford's death, the Beth-Sarim
house was sold. In 1948 this house was disposed of and the
teaching concerning the &quot;return of the ancient worthies was
quietly dropped in 1950&quot; (Millions Now Living Will Never Die: A
Study of Jehovah's Witnesses, Alan Rogerson, p. 48). Thus,
Beth-Sarim's stint in kingdom service was a few years short of
perpetual.

There is an epilogue to this story. In 1975 the Watchtower
Society published a book which mentioned Beth-Sarim. However, the
information contained in its pages only serves to complicate the
Jehovah's Witnesses historical credibility. From its very
inception, Beth-Sarim was said to have been built for Abraham and
friends. This book seems to tell a completely different story.

&quot;In time, a direct contribution was made for the purpose of
constructing a house in San Diego for Brother Rutherford's use.
It was not built at the expense of the Watchtower Society.
Concerning this property, the 1939 book Salvation stated: `At San
Diego, California, there is a small piece of land, on which, in
the year 1929, there was built a house, which is called and known
as Beth-Sarim'&quot; (1975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, p. 194).

There are two problems with this Yearbook statement.

First, the Watchtower said that it was built for Brother
Rutherford's use when in fact, according to Rutherford himself,
it was built for the Hebrews 11 patriarchs!

Second, the writer of the Yearbook articles quotes - or more
accurately, misquotes - Rutherford. Thus, making Rutherford say
exactly the opposite of what he actually said. The author of the
Yearbook quotes the Salvation book, written by Rutherford, which
mentions Beth-Sarim. However, the Yearbook author stops just
short of the truth. Earlier in this article, the full quote from
the Salvation book is given. In comparing the two it will be
extremely obvious how the Watchtower has lied.

Though Rutherford claimed to have prophetic wisdom, he made many
false prophecies. One of these prophecies concerned his 1925
prediction concerning the return of Abraham and other biblical
patriarchs. To compound these problems in recent years the
Watchtower Society has, in its attempts to cover-up embarrassing
events in their past, turned from false prophecies to outright
lying. Perhaps worst of all, is the fact that in so doing, they
are now lying to their own followers.

FACTS YOU WON'T BE TOLD WHEN JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES CALL AT YOUR DOOR
by Lori MacGregor

They believe &amp; teach

THAT all religions except theirs are of Satan, and your Pastor or
Priest is under the Devil's control.

THAT the Watch Tower Society is the only source of truth on earth
today, and all churches teach error and will be destroyed at
Armageddon.

THAT the cross is a pagan symbol of sex worship, and that all
buildings or persons displaying the cross are likewise pagan.
Jehovah's Witnesses deny that Jesus died on the cross. However,
recent &quot;new light&quot; in the WatchTower Magazine now admits they
are not certain about the cross, but will continue to deny it
anyway.

THAT no one goes to heaven but 144,000 Jehovah's Witnesses, and
your soul will be destroyed if you refuse their organization.

THAT the Christ child was only an &quot;IT&quot;, not a &quot;HE&quot;. See the New
World Translation, Luke 2:16,17.

THAT Jesus was not the Christ (or Messiah) until age 30, even
though their own bible says in Luke 2:11, &quot;because there was born
to you today a savior, who is Christ the Lord.&quot;

THAT after Jesus was buried in the tomb, Jerhovah dissolved his body
into gases and it disappeared forever.

THAT Jesus rose invisibly in three days, so Jehovah had to
&quot;materialize&quot; a fake body for him complete with fake nailprints
so His disciples would believe it was really Jesus risen.

THAT Armageddon and Christ's second coming were foretold to happen
in 1874, 1914, 1925 and 1975 by this &quot;non-prophet&quot; organization.

THAT when Christ failed to show up in 1914 The Society claimed in
later years that He had come invisibly--of course, and all
Jehovah's Witnesses believe this today.

THAT Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob etc. were to be back on earth
as perfect humans in 1925. The Society built a palacial home for
them BUT when the patriarchs failed to show up, the President
of the Society moved in.

THAT their light gets &quot;brighter and brighter&quot;, allowing for many
changes and &quot;about faces&quot; on their doctrines. Yesterday's error is
today's &quot;truth&quot;. Often the &quot;light&quot; bounces back and forth from
old to new views and back again! Does real light return to darkness?

THAT the Watch Tower Society and its followers are all prophets of
God today and the Governing Body is directed by angels from God.

THAT salvation for Society members consists of doing good works of
selling Watch Tower books and magazines and winning converts.

THAT soon Jehovah God will become a GRANDFATHER and Jesus will be
promoted to &quot;EVERLASTING FATHER&quot;!

THAT Jehovah God is not omnipresent, but still Almighty. Think!
How can this be?

They have NOT been told --
By the leadership of the Society ....

THAT when they translated their New World Translation of the Bible
they deliberately altered almost every scripture on the deity of
Christ, to make him only a creature.

THAT the Society used a translation by a SPIRIT MEDIUM, Johannes
Greber, to support their rendering of John 1:1 with full knowledge
that his sources were DEMONIC.

Greber was exposed in the Feb. 15/56 Watch Tower. However in 1961
they released a translation based on his occult one, then denied
they knew what they were doing on page 31 of the Apr. 1, 1983
Watchtower!

THAT none of their &quot;translating committee&quot; knew Biblical Greek
or Hebrew. No scholars at all.

That Fred Franz, who for many years headed the Society, perjured
himself under oath in Scotland in a court trial, by saying he
could read Hebrew, and then failing a simple Hebrew test.

THAT the following encyclopedias consider the name &quot;JEHOVAH&quot;
to be FALSE: Merits Student Enc.; Encyclopedia Americana;
The Jewish Enc.; Encyclopedia International, The Interpreters
Dictionary of the Bible; The New Catholic Enc.; The Universal
Jewish enc., [Encyclopaedia Britannica] etc.

J.W.'s own &quot;Aid&quot; book admits on pages 884 &amp; 885 that &quot;Jehovah&quot;
originated with a Catholic monk about 700 years ago!

THAT the date 1874 was taught for Christ's invisible presence
by the Society right up till 1929. (See their book, &quot;Prophecy&quot;,
page 65).

THAT top executives of the Society have admitted under oath that
they forced their members to accept false prophecies or face
disfellowshipping and be found worthy of death.

In Summary

We find the Watch Tower Society practising their belief that it is
proper to deceive people. But they say this really isn't lying.
Why? Because the Society has a different Definition of lying than
most of us. In their book &quot;AID TO BIBLE UNDERSTANDING&quot; under the
word &quot;LIE&quot; we read:

&quot;Lying generally involves saying something false to a person who
is ENTITLED to know the truth....&quot;. &quot;While malicious lying is
definitely condemned in the Bible, this does not mean that a
person is under obligation to divulge truthful information
to people who are not entitled to it&quot;.

OF course it is the Watch Tower leaders who decide WHO deserves
to know the truth.

DO YOU DESERVE TO KNOW THE TRUTH ?

WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WATCHTOWER ERRORS?
by Carl McCaskey

*EXCUSES, EXCUSES, EXCUSES*
Most, if not all Jehovah's Witnesses today attempt to dismiss
criticism of the Watchtower's numerous mistakes with such excuses
as &quot;they are only human&quot; or &quot;the light of truth was not shining
upon it at the time&quot; or &quot;they don't claim to be inspired.&quot; All of
these excuses fall flat not only upon closer examination and in
light of what the Watchtower itself has said via its own
publications, but most importantly by Jehovah God's own words.

Another excuse Jehovah's Witnesses are taught to use is that the
Watchtower shouldn't be held to its past errors because Biblical
prophets and apostles made mistakes and they weren't condemned
for being false. In fact one of their favorite &quot;examples&quot; cited
to support this excuse is the prophet Nathan. According to the
Watchtower (Reasoning From The Scriptures {1989}, pg. 134), when
King David wanted to build a house of worship for God, Nathan
told David to do as he wished. Later on, however, God told Nathan
to inform David that he was not to be the one to build the
temple. Even though Nathan erred, he wasn't condemned by God nor
anyone else. In fact, God continued to use Nathan because he
humbly corrected the matter when God made it plain to him. This
story is only partially true as set out by the Watchtower because
they twisted the scripture to suit their own needs by neglecting
to point out that Nathan's original message to David about
building the house was _not_ claimed by Nathan to be instructions
from God, however his subsequent message about not building the
house _was_ claimed to be instruction from God. Since the
Watchtower has made the claim that their messages come directly
from God, the Watchtower's &quot;example&quot; (via their scriptural
twisting) becomes irrelevant.

*INSPIRED?*
When asked what they mean by &quot;inspired&quot;, Jehovah's Witnesses are
taught to explain that the Watchtower is written by men who are
imperfect and if it were written by God, then it would be
inspired just like the Bible. In other words, the Jehovah's
Witnesses claim to not blame Jehovah for all the mistakes, false
prophecies and doctrinal errors made by the Watchtower throughout
its history. At least that is what the average Jehovah's Witness
will _attempt_ to explain. However upon closer examination,
evidence will clearly show that the Watchtower actually made the
claim that Jehovah God is responsible for _ALL_ information in
the Watchtower.

*WHO DID THE WATCHTOWER CLAIM WAS RESPONSIBLE?*
Let's look at the historical and documentable facts.

Firstly, in a 1943 court case, then Watchtower Vice-President
Frederick Franz was asked the following:

Q: At any rate, Jehovah God is now the editor of the paper
[Watchtower magazine], is that right?
Franz: He is today the editor of the paper.
Q: How long has He been editor of the paper?
Franz: Since its inception He has been guiding it.

Later, in the same court case, then Watchtower President Nathan
Knorr was asked about the importance of the Watchtower magazine:

Q: In fact, it [Watchtower magazine] is set forth as God's word,
isn't it?
Knorr: Yes, as His word.
Q: Without any qualification whatsoever?
Knorr: That is right.

These answers were given _under oath_, so unless both men
committed perjury, it must be assumed that their claims of the
Watchtower's information coming directly from Jehovah God were at
least quite sincere.

This is further substantiated by the Watchtower magazine itself.
In the May 1, 1938 edition of the Watchtower {pg. 143}, it was
written

&quot;The interpretation of prophecy, therefore, is
not from man, but is from Jehovah; and Jehovah
causes events to come to pass in fulfillment of
the prophecy in due time.&quot;

Since these claims have never been officially rescinded by the
&quot;Governing Body&quot; over the subsequent years, then it can only be
assumed that they are still in effect.

In addition, the Watchtower made the following claim

&quot;...Jehovah's Witnesses today make their declaration
of the good news of the kingdom under angelic direction
and support&quot;
(Watchtower, April 1, 1972, pg. 200)

So when did God give the responsibility of editorship to His
angels? The Watchtower has never made this clear, but instead
have used this as one of their more recent excuses for their
errors. Unfortunately it is an erroneous excuse and without merit
as I shall later prove.

Also, the Watchtower of July 1st, 1973 {pg. 402}, claims,

&quot;Consider too, the fact that Jehovah's organization
alone in all the earth is directed by God's holy spirit
or active force.&quot;

It is painfully obviously the Holy Spirit did not prompt their
false prophecies, doctrinal errors and other mistakes.

With all of this in mind, it becomes quite clear and unarguable
that the Watchtower claims that their information comes directly
from Jehovah God without qualification. Therefore, whenever they
try to dismiss their errors, mistakes, false prophecies, etc.
they are actually blaming Jehovah God for their mistakes.

*ERRORS? WHAT ERRORS?*
Let's look at some of their errors:

Did Abraham, Isaac and Jacob return to earth in 1925 as predicted
by the Watchtower?

According to WT publications, the year 1925 _was definitely_ when
these Old Testament saints were expected to come on the scene.
This expectancy is reflected in the following Watchtower
publications:

&quot;we may expect 1925 to witness the return of these
faithful men of Israel from the condition of death,
being resurrected..1925 will mark the return of Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, and the faithful prophets of old.&quot;
(Millions Now Living Will Never Die [1920], pgs. 88-90)

&quot;There will be no slip-up....Abraham should enter
upon the actual possession of his promised inheritance
in the year 1925 A.D.&quot;
(The Watchtower, October 15, 1917, pg. 6157)

&quot;1925 is definitely settled by the Scriptures.&quot;
(The Watchtower, April 1, 1923, pg. 106)

&quot;The year 1925 is a date definitely and clearly
marked in the Scriptures, even more clearly than
that of 1914.&quot;
(The Watchtower, July 15, 1924, pg. 211)

In fact, the Watchtower clearly stated in 1922 their claimed
source of this chronological information:

&quot;this chronology is not of man, but of God.&quot;
(The Watchtower, July 17, 1922, p. 217)

So, if God said it, it _should_ easily pass the test of a true
prophet set forth in Deuteronomy 18:21, 22 which states:

&quot;And if thou say in thine heart, how shall we know
the word which the Lord hath spoken? When a prophet
speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow
not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the
Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it
presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.&quot;

There was no uncertainty expressed anywhere in these predictions
made by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society over several
years. In fact, the Watchtower built Beth-Sarim and gave the
following explanation for purchasing the property and building
the estate thusly:

&quot;the purpose of acquiring that property and building
the house was that there might be some tangible proof
that there are those on earth today...who believe that
faithful men of old will soon be resurrected by the Lord,
be back on earth, and take charge of the visible affairs
of earth.&quot;
(Salvation [1939], pg. 311]

In short, the Watchtower predicted with no uncertainty that
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob would return bodily in 1925, yet they
didn't. Doesn't this, therefore, become a false prediction; a
false prophecy? Of course it does. To be a prophet of God, each
and every single one of the prophecies made _has_ to come
_completely_ true or else the prophet making it (in this case,
the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society) is a false prophet and
therefore is _not_ of God. However, this is only one of several
false prophecies that the Watchtower is guilty of.

*CHANGE IS GOOD???*
If it were true that Jehovah God is the editor of the Watchtower
and the Watchtower is set forth as His word without any
qualification whatsoever (as Franz and Knorr respectively swore
under oath in 1943), then there wouldn't be any need to change
_anything_ published by the Watchtower. However look at all the
inconsistencies found throughout their history.

Look at what the Watchtower published concerning the its
prediction of when the 6,000 years of human history would end.

6,000 years of human history ended in 1873.
(The Time Is At Hand, p.33)

6,000 years of human history ended in 1972.
(The Truth Shall Make You Free, p. 152, 1943 edition)

6,000 years of human history ended in 1975.
(Awake!, October 8th, 1968)

Then there's the changes in the date for the end of Armageddon.

Armageddon would end in 1914.
(The Time is At Hand, Page 101, 1889 Edition)

Armageddon would end in 1915.
(The Time is At Hand, Page 101, 1915 Edition)

[NOTE: Today, Jehovah's Witnesses expect Armageddon at any
minute.]

How about the changes in when they say the millennium began?

The Millennium began in 1873.
(Thy Kingdom Come, page 305)

The Millennium began in 1874.
(Finished Mystery, page 386)

What about the changes the Watchtower made concerning the Book of
Ruth?

The Book of Ruth is &quot;not prophetical.&quot;
(Watchtower Reprints IV, p. 3110, Nov. 15, 1902)

The Book of Ruth &quot;is prophetic.&quot;
(Watchtower Book, &quot;Preservation&quot;, pages 169, 175, 176)

Let's now look at the Watchtower's flip-flopping concerning Sodom
and Gomorrah.

&quot;Sodom and Gomorrah will receive a second opportunity&quot;
(Plan of the Ages&quot;, page 110)

&quot;Sodom and Gomorrah will receive no second opportunity&quot;
(Watchtower, Feb. 1954, page 85)

&quot;Sodom and Gomorrah will receive a second opportunity&quot;
(Watchtower, Mar. 1965, page 139)

The Watchtower could not even get a historical prediction
correct.

&quot;Man cannot by airplane or rockets or other means
get above the air envelope which is about our earthly
globe...&quot;
(The Truth Shall Make You Free, p. 285, 1943 edition)

Admittedly, many people said the same thing, some of them
prominent scientists, but remember, it had been made clear not
only by Watchtower publications, but by the Watchtower's own
leaders that their information came directly from God.

The Watchtower claimed all they published were God's word:
therefore it _had_ to be correct. If true, then how come they
flip-flopped on specific Biblical issues like:

The &quot;higher powers&quot; referred to in Romans 13:1

&quot;Higher Powers&quot; refers to earthly governments.
(The Time is at Hand [1889] p. 81)

&quot;Higher Powers&quot; refers to Jehovah God and Jesus.
(The Truth Shall Make You Free, p. 312)

&quot;Higher Powers&quot; refers to earthly governments.
(Man's Salvation...at Hand p. 326)

[NOTE: Notice how the &quot;brighter light&quot; dimmed back again.]

The Revelation name &quot;Abaddon-Apollyon&quot;

Refers to Satan.
(Studies in the Scriptures, Vol.7)

Refers to Jesus Christ.
(Then is Finished the Mystery of God, Page 232)

[NOTE: That's _quite_ a massive change, isn't it?]

The &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot; of Revelation

Refers to Jehovah God.
(Awake! August 22, 1978, page 28)

Refers to Jesus Christ.
(Watchtower, October 1, 1978, p.15)

[NOTE: That's also _substantial_ change in only two months.]

The &quot;Faithful and discreet slave&quot;

Refers to their founder, Charles Taze Russell.
(Watchtowers from Dec. 1, 1916 to March 1, 1923, p. 68).

Refers to the &quot;Remnant of Spiritual Israelites&quot; (the
supposed remnant of the 144,000 &quot;heavenly class&quot;).
(From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained, page 193).

*IN CONCLUSION*
The Bible gives us a simple test for prophets in Deuteronomy, but
the Holy Scriptures have more to say about prophecies and
prophesying.

The Bible reveals three sources for prophecy.

First, it could be from God, and inspired by Him.
Secondly, it could be from the Devil and inspired by him.
Or finally, prophecies can come out of &quot;the flesh&quot;, or out of our
&quot;own spirit.&quot;

History has shown that the Watchtower has made numerous
prophecies that did not come true. Therefore simple logic and
Biblical guidance dictate that they cannot be prophesying by
Jehovah God's direction, nor through His Holy Spirit, nor by His
angels.

This leaves us with only two other choices for their false
prophecies. They are either from Satan, or they are from &quot;the
flesh&quot;.

As pointed out in the beginning of this article, the Watchtower
has chosen the latter, claiming that &quot;they are only human&quot; or
&quot;the light of truth was not shining upon it at the time&quot; or &quot;they
don't claim to be inspired.&quot; None of these excuses hold any water
as far as Biblical instruction is concerned. Jehovah God even
made His position on false prophets _extremely_ clear in Ezekiel
chapter 13. This chapter is Jehovah God's righteous condemnation
of prophets who hope for a fulfillment of their words after
prophesying falsely. In fact, Ezekiel 13:8 states:

&quot;`Because you have spoken falsehood and seen a lie,
therefore, behold, I am against you', declared the
Lord God.&quot;

God is very clear and certain in His righteous judgment against
false prophets. The Watchtower has made false prophecies on
numerous occasions. Therefore it can logically be concluded that
God, by His _own_ decree, is _against_ the Watchtower and thereby
condemns this cultic organization.
