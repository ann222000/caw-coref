Peggy--

Are there regs (Lloyds, AYC) on type of hose to run from head to thru
hull.  I just installed 1 1/2 PVC sanitation hose (the glossy white
stuff that Waste Marine sells for almost $10 a ft)?  I then realized
that the hose I replaced was heavy black rubber--the type used on
diesel engines.

Thanks, Peggy

Joe

Nope..there are currently no standards whatever for sanitation plumbing
materials or installation.

I doubt if the hose you replaced really was engine or exhaust hose...it
was prob'ly double-walled rubber sanitation hose.

I need to clarify that. Although there are no materials or installation
standards, the CFR and CG regs do include some requirements...i.e. all
waste tanks must be vented to the outside of the boat...gray water and
black water plumbing shouldn't be combined...acceptable ways to secure a
system. But when it comes to how to plumb a system or what materials to
use, there is nothing--at least nothing specific to sanitaion. There is
a standard advising vented loops in all hoses connected to
below-waterline thru-hulls and advice to keep all seacocks closed except
when in use, but that's it. When it comes to what hoses and tank
materials and how to plumb 'em, there's only collective wisdom.
