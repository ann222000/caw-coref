Tonight features the Top 10 acts performing from Los Angeles. At the
beginning of the show the Top 5 were picked, by who had the most votes,
out of the 10 performances from last week, and...they were, as follows:

1. Terry Fator (ventriloquist)
2. Calypso Tumblers
3. Cas Haley (singer)
4. The Duttons
5. Jason Pritchett (singer)

They will be performing, along with the 5 voted through from the week
before. Only 8 will continue after the votes are counted from tonight,
and will be announced next Tuesday.

1st up were THE DUTTONS....a group of brothers and sisters, plus mom and
dad. Piers didn't like them that much (don't think he's ever been too
crazy about them) and I didn't much care for them either, to be honest.

2nd was ROBERT HATCHER...probably not the best singer, and I don't
expect him to win, but I do like this guy. His voice is mellow and easy
to listen to, and just seems like one heck of a nice guy!

3rd THE CALYPSO TUMBLERS...dang! they ARE good, and it surprises me just
how much I do like them, but I am spell bound when they are on
stage...best performance ever by them, I think.

4th  JASON PRITCHETT...I liked him better this week, just strumming his
guitar and singing a slower country song so effortlessly. I could just
listen to him all night, and if I was on a cruise ship where he was
singing, I'd definitely go to his show!  He got 10 votes from me on my
cell.

5th BUTTERSCOTCH...she looked nice and seemed more at ease on stage
tonight, and did more singing, but not sure that was her best
performance? She hasn't yet won me over?!

6th THE GLAMAZONS....I like these gals...seem like nice ladies, and I
love the way they &quot;strut their stuff!&quot; I also like their voices, and
think they harmonize well.

7th  CAS HALEY...tonight he sang a blues type song, which I didn't care
for as much as his Sting song when he auditioned, but he sings from the
heart, and his unique voice appeals to me, and he  seems like such a
true Southern gentlemen. He's always gotten my votes, and tonight he got
10 from my land line.

8th TERRY FATOR...I like this guy so much. He is so talented, and truly
makes those puppets come &quot;alive&quot;....completely and utterly fascinating
to watch!

9th JULIENNE IRWIN..Oh, my! I like this young lady, and I thought she
was GREAT, and didn't notice the pitch problems that the judges did, but
then I have hearing loss in my left ear too.

10th (and the final act) SIDESWIPE...love looking at these gorgeous
guys, but I didn't care for their act as much tonight. Not sure if it
was the addition of the kids, or not, but just wasn't that entertaining
to be truthful.

What two acts will be eliminated, do  you think?  My guess would be The
Duttons and Sideswipe, but it might be Robert Hatcher too, but I feel
the other 7 acts are safe...guess we'll find out in a week?!

It was a cheap ploy for votes to bring the kids in, and I hope everyone
else realizes it and doesn't give them the sympathy vote for being
ragged on.

I could see them wowing crowds at local fairs and church bazaars; and
given thier level of skill, I don't doubt that's what they may already
do - but I don't care enough for them to even look that up, much less
vote for'em.  They do seem like a very nice bunch though.

I agree Judy - who doesn't like tumblers?  But I've seen little
gymnasts and Chinese acrobats who performed similar stuff.  It's neat,

I've had my fill of them as well - ditch the saloon hootchie-mama

I thought they were very mediocre last week but I really liked them
this week.  That guy who was balancing the other two on his knees -
wow!  I don't like the token pretty boy, though; he's kinda creepy.

Last week I enjoyed her singing voice but this week, not so much.
Plus, I think Piers nailed it when he said she shouldn't be slumping
around the stage the way she was; it's very unappealing.

I am totally over them.  Last night I heard two standout voices - the
black girl (I think she's black?) and the darker haired girl.  But for
me, the harmonies were completely lacking and I am really, really
tired of the hooker outfits.  We get it, okay?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I love the blues; it's my music of choice.  And I like Cas Haley.
That said, last night was the first time I felt like I could have been
in any old smokey bar listening to someone jamming.  He was a bit
shrill, too.  I still like him but not so much tonight.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 8th TERRY FATOR...I like this guy so much. He is so talented, and truly
&gt; makes those puppets come &quot;alive&quot;....completely and utterly fascinating

I like him too, and every time that he doesn't bring out a creepy
humanoid puppet I like him even more.  He has great facial
expressions.

I didn't so much notice the pitch problems, but I didn't really enjoy
the performance overall, either.  I think as far as country singing
goes Jason Pritchett definitely outsang her tonight.

My favorites (top to bottom):

Terry Fator
Calypso Tumblers
Cas Haley
Jason Pritchett
Julienne Erwin
Robert Hatcher
Butterscotch
Glamazons
The Duttons
SideSwipe

Who should go:  Glamazons and SideSwipe
Who will go:  SideSwipe and the Duttons

Doesn't matter Judy, Julianne is going to win.  Fator will come in a
close second and either Haley or the Duttons will be third.  Simon
smells a 14 year old who can be his first real unofficial &quot;American X-
Factor&quot; winner and he can preempt AI by making her 4x the star before
she's even old enough to have qualified for AI.

If Simon is really out to get AI, he'll push Pritchett as the underdog
since AI is going to have to go country in a great way next season.

REALLY....I don't want to analyze AGT like AI.  I don't have the desire
or the facts that we get for AI at hand.

However, the Duttons are what really attracts the Heartland of America.
It all depends on who votes in terms of demographics.  I wouldn't be
surprised if they went out next week and I wouldn't be surprised if they
lasted until the top three.

Acgtually, a lot of them had new backup singers and stage props.

I felt the same way about the kids until the spokesman for Sideswipe
spoke up to Piers, and he was genuinely offended by the idea that they
were brought on as a ploy.  He said that this is their main talent,
that they work with kids and teach them the disciplie and precision of
martial arts. I believed him, and in that context I was even more
impressed with them.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have never liked them and bringing out the kids was a big mistake.

&gt; &gt;I'm glad to hear I wasn't the only one that thought the kids just hurt
&gt; &gt;them.  When I said it was a cheap ploy, I thought a dozen people would
&gt; &gt;respond, &quot;I thought they were cute.&quot;  I don't even see why the show
&gt; &gt;allowed them.  Having an accompanist or backup singers is one thing, but
&gt; &gt;bringing new people into the act itself shouldn't be allowed.  What if
&gt; &gt;one of the solo singers had some friends join in and all of a sudden
&gt; &gt;became a singing group?

&gt; Acgtually, a lot of them had new backup singers and stage props.

I believed Mullins as well - the Sideswipe guys have always been about
helping kids;
http://www.sideswipepro.com/

I've seen Matt in other non-realityTV shows focusing on his skills as
a martial artist - he's a Champ, and the real deal; http://www.sideswipepro.com/team.html
.. and I absolutely believe he was sincere about giving up the prize
for the experience of working with those kids.

To some people, it's not all about the money.

Although I'd have also had those little kids beat the tar outta that
British Blowhard after the show.  ;-P

I thought it was odd they were allowed to add to their ensemble.
