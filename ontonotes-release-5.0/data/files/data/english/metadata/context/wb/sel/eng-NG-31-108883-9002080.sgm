Guess I'll start!

Hi, my name is Aaron.  I work now as a software engineer in and around San
Francisco.  My BS is in physics, and I've done a bit of research in
biophysics.

My interest in SICM comes from my interest in both physics and computer
science (as distinguished from software development - which I happen to do
too).  When I first discovered the book, I enjoyed how it melds the two in a
way that's new to me.

I have read and worked the exercises in most of chapter one and the first 25%
of chapter two.  Just skimmed the rest, so far.

I'm mainly a software engineer these days, so I guess I count as an amature
physicist at best.  (If you're curious, I'm blessed to be paid to work on
open source software in Python.)  Tobin, looks like you're a physics grad
student?
