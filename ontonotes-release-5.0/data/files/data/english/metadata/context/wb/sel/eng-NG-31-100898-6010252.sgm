1274 CE: The First Mongol invasion of Japan. Nichiren Daishonin
predicts the First and Second Mongol Invasions, and that prediction
occurs.

In 1274, Japan is invaded by a fleet of 900 ships and 31,000 men, as
the Mongols swept over the islands of Tsushima and Iki, and then
attacked the major Southern island of Kyushu. At the point of victory
in Hakata, a storm swept in and sank more than 200 Mongol battleships.
The Mongols withdrew to Korea.

In 1281, the Mongols prepared for their second invasion with a fleet
of 4000 ships and 140,000 men. The Kamakura Shogunate is driven to
poverty in preparation for the invasion, which will cause upheavals in
Japan for centuries. The first 40,000 quickly overwhelmed Tsushima and
Iki again, the remaining 100,000 are delayed for a while, and when
they do join forces, a massive storm sinks everything but 250 ships.
This storm is later called the Divine Wind, or Kamikaze.

Nichiren Daishonin pp. 774-778.

.      'On the eighth day of the fourth month, I met
.   with Hei no Saemon. In contrast to his behavior
.   on previous occasions, his manner was quite mild,
.   and he treated me with courtesy. An accompanying
.   lay priest asked me about the Nembutsu, a layman
.   asked about the True Word school, and another
.   person asked about Zen, while Hei no Saemon
.   himself inquired whether it was possible to
.   attain the way through any of the sutras preached
.   before the Lotus Sutra. I replied to each of
.   these questions by citing passages from the
.   sutras.'
.
.      'Then Hei no Saemon, apparently acting on
.   behalf of the regent, asked when the Mongol
.   forces would invade Japan. I replied: "They will
.   surely come within this year. I have already
.   expressed my opinion on this matter, but it has
.   not been heeded. If you try to treat someone's
.   illness without knowing its cause, you will only
.   make the person sicker than before. In the same
.   way, if the True Word priests are permitted to
.   try to overcome the Mongols with their prayers
.   and imprecations, they will only bring about the
.   country's military defeat. Under no circumstances
.   whatever should the True Word priests, or the
.   priests of any other schools for that matter, be
.   allowed to offer up prayers. If each of you has a
.   real understanding of Buddhism, you will
.   understand this matter on hearing
.   me explain it to you.'
.
.      '"Also, I notice that, although advice from
.   others is heeded, when I offer advice, it is for
.   some strange reason invariably ignored.
.   Nevertheless, I would like to state certain facts
.   here so that you may think them over later. The
.   Retired Emperor of Oki was the sovereign of the
.   nation, and the acting administrator [Hojo
.   Yoshitoki] was his subject, [and yet the latter
.   attacked and defeated the retired emperor]. Why
.   would the Sun Goddess permit a subject to attack
.   a sovereign, who should be like a father to him?
.   Why would Great Bodhisattva Hachiman allow a
.   vassal to attack the lord with impunity? And yet,
.   as we know, the sovereign and the courtiers
.   supporting him were defeated by Hojo Yoshitoki.
.   That defeat was no mere accident. It came about
.   because they put their faith in the misleading
.   teachings of the Great Teacher Kobo and the
.   biased views of the great teachers Jikaku and
.   Chisho, and because the priests of Mount Hiei,
.   To-ji, and Onjo-ji, in their opposition to the
.   Kamakura shogunate, offered prayers for its
.   defeat. Thus their curses 'rebounded upon the
.   originator,' (24) and as a consequence the
.   sovereign and his courtiers were forced to suffer
.   defeat. The military leaders in Kamakura knew
.   nothing of such rituals, so no prayers to subdue
.   the enemy were offered; thus they were able to
.   win. But if they now depend on such prayers, they
.   will meet the same fate as the courtiers.'
.
.      '"The Ezo people of northern Japan have no
.   understanding of the principles of birth and
.   death. Ando Goro (25) was a pious man who knew
.   the law of cause and effect and erected many
.   Buddhist halls and pagodas. How could it happen,
.   then, that the Ezo beheaded him? In view of these
.   events, I have no doubt that, if these priests
.   are allowed to go on offering prayers for
.   victory, Your Lordship will meet with some
.   untoward event. And when that happens, you must
.   not under any circumstances say that I failed to
.   warn you." Such was the stern manner in which I
.   addressed him.'
.
.      'When I retuned home, I heard that the Dharma
.   Seal of the Amida Hall (26) had been asked to
.   pray for rain from the tenth day of the fourth
.   month. This Dharma Seal is the most learned
.   priest of To-ji and the teacher of the prelate of
.   Omuro.(27) He has mastered the True Word esoteric
.   teachings of the great teachers Kobo, Jikaku, and
.   Chisho, and has memorized all the doctrines of
.   the various schools such as Tendai and Flower
.   Garland. He began praying for rain on the tenth
.   day, and on the eleventh a heavy rain fell. There
.   was no wind, but only a gentle rain that fell for
.   a day and a night. The regent, the lord of
.   Sagami, was said to have been so deeply impressed
.   that he presented the Dharma Seal with thirty ryo
.   in gold, a horse, and other gifts as a reward.'
.
.      'When the people of Kamakura heard this,
.   eminent and humble alike clapped their hands,
.   pursed their lips, and laughed with derision,
.   saying: "That Nichiren preached a false kind of
.   Buddhism and came near to getting his head cut
.   off. He was finally pardoned, but instead of
.   learning his lesson, he goes on slandering the
.   Nembutsu and Zen schools, and even dares to speak
.   ill of the esoteric teachings of True Word. How
.   fortunate that we have had this rain to serve as
.   proof of the power of True Word prayers!"'
.
.      'Faced with such criticisms, my disciples
.   became quite downcast and complained that I had
.   been too provocative in my attacks on the True
.   Word school. But I said to them, "Just wait a
.   while. If the evil teachings of the Great Teacher
.   Kobo could be correct and in fact produce
.   effective prayers for the welfare of the nation,
.   then the Retired Emperor of Oki would surely have
.   been victorious in his struggle with the Kamakura
.   shogunate, and Setaka,(28) the favorite boy
.   attendant of the prelate of Omuro, would not have
.   had his head cut off. Kobo in his Treatise on the
.   Ten Stages of the Mind states that the Lotus
.   Sutra is inferior to the Flower Garland Sutra. In
.   his Precious Key to the Secret Treasury he claims
.   that the Shakyamuni Buddha of the 'Life Span'
.   chapter of the Lotus Sutra is an ordinary person,
.   and in his Comparison of Exoteric and Esoteric
.   Buddhism he calls the Great Teacher T'ien-t'ai a
.   thief. Moreover, Shokakubo (29) in his Rules of
.   Rites for Revering the Buddha's Relics states
.   that the Buddha who preached the one vehicle of
.   the Lotus Sutra is not even worthy to tend the
.   sandals of a True Word master. The Dharma Seal of
.   the Amida Hall is a follower of the men who
.   taught these perverse doctrines. If such a man
.   could show himself superior to me, then the
.   dragon kings who send down the rain must be the
.   enemies of the Lotus Sutra, and they will surely
.   be chastised by the gods Brahma and Shakra and
.   the four heavenly kings. There must be more to
.   this than meets the eye!"'
.
.      '"What do you mean by 'more than meets the
.   eye'?" my disciples asked with a scornful smile.'
.
.      'I replied: "Shan-wu-wei and Puk'ung both
.   caused rain to fall in answer to their prayers,
.   but it is recorded that they also brought about
.   high winds. When Kobo prayed for rain, it fell
.   after twenty-one days had passed. But under such
.   circumstances, it is the same as though he had
.   not caused it to rain at all, since some rain is
.   naturally bound to fall in the course of a
.   twenty-one day interval. The fact that it happened
.   to rain while he was praying for it is in no way
.   remarkable. What is really impressive is to cause
.   it to fall through a single ceremony, the way
.   T'ien-t'ai and Senkan (30) did. That is why I say
.   there must be something peculiar about this
.   rain."'
.
.      'I had not even finished speaking when a great
.   gale began to blow. Houses of every size,
.   Buddhist halls and pagodas, old trees, and
.   government buildings all were swept up into the
.   air or toppled to the ground. A huge shining
.   object flew through the sky, and the earth was
.   strewn with beams and rafters. Men and women were
.   blown to their death, and many cattle and horses
.   were struck down. One might have excused such an
.   evil wind if it had come in autumn, the typhoon
.   season, but this was only the fourth month, the
.   beginning of summer. Moreover, this wind did not
.   blow throughout the country, but struck only the
.   eight provinces of the Kanto region, and in fact
.   only the two provinces of Musashi and Sagami. It
.   blew strongest in Sagami; and within Sagami, it
.   blew strongest in Kamakura; and within Kamakura,
.   it blew strongest at the government headquarters,
.   Wakamiya, and the temples Kencho-ji and Gokuraku-
.   ji. It was apparent that it was no ordinary wind,
.   but rather the result of the Dharma Seal's
.   prayers alone. The people who had earlier pursed
.   their lips and laughed at me suddenly turned
.   sober, and my disciples too were astonished and
.   expressed their wonder.'
.
.      'I had been determined all along that, if
.   after three attempts to warn the rulers of the
.   nation my advice still went unheeded, I would
.   leave the country. With that thought in mind, I
.   accordingly left Kamakura on the twelfth day of
.   the fifth month and came here to Mount Minobu.'
.
.      'In the tenth month of the same year (1274),
.   the Mongols launched their attack. Not only were
.   the islands of Iki and Tsushima (31) assaulted
.   and captured, but the forces of the Dazaifu
.   government office in Kyushu were defeated as
.   well. When the military leaders, the lay priest
.   Shoni and Otomo,(32) received word of this, they
.   fled, and the remaining warriors were struck down
.   without difficulty. [Though the Mongol forces
.   withdrew,] it was apparent just how weak Japan's
.   defenses would be if they should launch another
.   attack in the future.'
.
.      'The Benevolent Kings Sutra says, "Once the
.   sages have departed, then the seven disasters are
.   certain to arise." The Sovereign Kings Sutra
.   states, "Because evil people are respected and
.   favored and good people are subjected to
.   punishment, marauders will appear from other
.   regions, and the people of the country will meet
.   with death and disorder." If these pronouncements
.   of the Buddha are true, then evil men certainly
.   exist in our country, and the ruler favors and
.   respects such men while treating good men with
.   enmity.'
.
.      'The Great Collection Sutra states, "The sun
.   and moon no longer shed their light. All the four
.   directions will be afflicted by drought. . . .
.   The wicked rulers and monks who perform these ten
.   evil acts will curse and destroy my correct
.   teaching." In the Benevolent Kings Sutra we read,
.   "Evil monks, hoping to gain fame and profit, in
.   many cases appear before the ruler, the crown
.   prince, or the other princes, and take it upon
.   themselves to preach doctrines that lead to the
.   violation of the Buddhist Law and the destruction
.   of the nation. The ruler, failing to perceive the
.   truth of the situation, listens to and puts faith
.   in such doctrines. . . . In this way he brings
.   about the destruction of Buddhism and of the
.   nation." And the Lotus Sutra speaks of the "evil
.   monks of that muddied age."(33) If these passages
.   in the sutras are true, then there must
.   unquestionably be evil monks in this country. The
.   crooked trees are destined to be cut down on a
.   treasure mountain, and dead bodies are rejected
.   by the great sea. Though the great sea of the
.   Buddhist Law and the treasure mountain of the one
.   vehicle may admit the shards and rubble of the
.   five cardinal sins or the dirty water of the four
.   major offenses,(34) they have no room for the
.   "dead bodies" of those who slander the Law, or
.   for the "crooked trees" who are icchantikas,
.   persons of incorrigible disbelief. Therefore,
.   those who endeavor to practice the Buddhist Law
.   and who care about what happens to them in future
.   lives should know what a fearful thing it is to
.   slander the Lotus Sutra.'
.
.      'Many people wonder why anyone should pay heed
.   to a person like myself who speaks ill of Kobo,
.   Jikaku, and others of their group. I do not know
.   about other regions, but I know that the people
.   everywhere in the province of Awa have good
.   reason to believe what I say. They have seen the
.   proof right before their eyes. Endon-bo of
.   Inomori, Saigyo-bo and Dogi-bo of Kiyosumi, and
.   Jitchi-bo of Kataumi were all eminent priests;
.   but one should inquire what kind of deaths they
.   met with. However, I will say no more of them.
.   Enchi-bo spent three years in the great hall of
.   Seicho-ji copying the text of the Lotus Sutra in
.   a laborious fashion, bowing three times as he
.   copied each character. He had memorized all ten
.   volumes, and every day and night recited the
.   entire sutra twice for a period of fifty years.
.   Everyone said that he would surely become a
.   Buddha. But I alone said that he, along with
.   Dogibo, was even more certain to fall into the
.   depths of the hell of incessant suffering than
.   were the Nembutsu priests. You would do well to
.   inquire carefully just how these men met death.
.   If it had not been for me, people would have
.   believed that these priests had attained
.   Buddhahood.'
.
.      'You should realize from this that the manner
.   of the death of Kobo, Jikaku, and the others
.   indicated that a truly miserable fate was in
.   store for them. But their disciples contrived to
.   keep the matter secret, so that even the members
.   of the imperial court never learned of it. Hence
.   these men have been looked up to with increasing
.   reverence in later times. And if there had been
.   no one like me to reveal the truth, they would
.   have gone on being honored in that manner for
.   endless ages to come. The non-Buddhist teacher
.   Uluka [turned to stone at his death], but eight
.   hundred years later [his errors were brought to
.   light and] the stone melted and turned to water.
.   And in the case of another non-Buddhist teacher
.   Kapila, a thousand years passed before his faults
.   were brought to light.(35)'
.
.      'People are able to be born in human form
.   because they have observed the five precepts in a
.   previous existence. And if they continue to
.   observe the five precepts in this life, then the
.   twenty- five benevolent deities will protect
.   them, and Same Birth and Same Name, the two
.   heavenly messengers who have been with each of
.   them since birth on their shoulders, will guard
.   them. So long as they commit no fault, the demons
.   will have no chance to do them harm. And yet in
.   this country of Japan, there are countless people
.   who cry out in misery. We know, too, that the
.   people on the islands of Iki and Tsushima had to
.   suffer at the hands of the Mongols, and what
.   befell the defenders of the Dazaifu in Kyushu.
.   What fault were the people of this country guilty
.   of that they should meet with such a fate? One
.   would surely like to know the answer. One or two
.   of the persons there may have been guilty of
.   evil, but is it possible that all of them could
.   have been?'
.
.      'The blame lies entirely in the fact that this
.   country is filled with the disciples of those who
.   despised the Lotus Sutra---True Word priests who
.   follow the doctrines handed down from Kobo,
.   Jikaku, and Chisho; Nembutsu priests who are
.   latter-day disciples of Shan-tao and Honen; and
.   the followers of Bodhidharma and the other
.   patriarchs of the Zen school. That is why Brahma,
.   Shakra, the four heavenly kings, and the other
.   deities, true to the vows they took when the
.   Lotus Sutra was expounded to split into seven
.   pieces the head [of anyone who troubles a
.   preacher of the sutra],(36) have sent down this
.   punishment.'

Footnotes:

24. Lotus Sutra, chap. 25. In the sutra, the sentence reads in the
future tense. It was changed here to fit the context of this letter.

25. Ando Goro (n.d.) was a magistrate who exercised jurisdiction over
the northern part of Japan in the time of the regent Hojo Yoshitoki
(1163--1224).

26. The Dharma Seal of the Amida Hall refers to the True Word priest
Kaga Josho, who was the superintendent of the Amida Hall in Kamakura.

27. The prelate of Omuro refers to Prince Dojo (n.d.), a son of
Emperor Gotoba who had entered the priesthood. This generally means
the title of a retired emperor or prince who entered the priesthood
and lived at Ninna-ji, a True Word temple in Kyoto. Omuro is another
name for Ninna-ji.

28. Setaka (d. 1221) was the sixth son of Sasaki Hirotsuna, a warrior
who supported Emperor Gotoba. He was the cherished favorite of the
prince-priest Dojo at Ninnaji, and was beheaded in 1221 at the time of
the Jokyu Disturbance.

29. Shokaku-bo (1095--1143), also called Kakuban, was the precursor of
the New Doctrine branch of the True Word school.

30. Senkan (918--983) was a priest of the Tendai school. In the summer
of 962, when Japan was suffering from drought, the emperor ordered him
to offer prayers for rain. It is said that, immediately after the
imperial envoy reached him, he caused rain to fall.

31. Iki and Tsushima are islands off the coast of Kyushu in southern
Japan. The Dazaifu office was the administrative center of Kyushu,
Iki, and Tsushima, and served as a foreign affairs conduit as well as
a rallying point in the case of foreign invasion. During the Mongol
attack of 1274, it was a focal point of defense against the Mongols.

32. Shoni is Shoni Sukeyoshi (1198--1281), the constable of Chikuzen.
Otomo is Otomo Yoriyasu (1222--1300), the constable of Bungo.

33. Lotus Sutra, chap. 13.

34. The four major offenses are precepts for monks, dealing with
killing, theft, sexual misconduct, and lying.

35. Kapila was the founder of the Samkhya school, one of the six main
schools of Brahmanism in India. According to The Annotations on "Great
Concentration and Insight," he transformed himself into a stone
because he was afraid of death. But when Bodhisattva Dignaga wrote a
verse of admiration on the stone, it cracked into pieces, thereby
revealing the falsity of Kapila's teachings a thousand years after his
death.

36. Lotus Sutra, chap. 26. It states, "If there are those who fail to
heed our spells and trouble and disrupt the preachers of the Law,
their heads will split into seven pieces."
__________________________________________________________

1275-1279 CE, 1287-1288 CE: Rabban Bar Sauma and Markos. Önggüd
(Turkic) Nestorian monks who traveled from Tai-tu, Qubilai Khan's
northern capital, to the Middle East, via the southern branch of the
Silk Road (through Khotan and Kashgar). Although on a pilgrimage to
Jerusalem (which they never reached), they seem to have had official
sponsorship from the Khan. Once in the Mongol Ilkhanid realms, they
became involved in Nestorian church politics, and Markos eventually
was elected head of the church as Patriarch Mar Yaballaha III. Bar
Sauma was sent to the West as an emissary of the Ilkhanid ruler Arghun
in 1287, with the goal of concluding an alliance against the Mamluks.
Bar Sauma's writings were preserved in an abridged translation into
Syriac, from which there are several translations into modern
languages. As Rossabi notes, "His narrative remains the only one of
its era to provide an East Asian perspective on European ways and
rites," even though it is somewhat disappointing in detail about life
in the places through which he traveled. Like their contemporary,
Marco Polo, the travelers are not mentioned in any Chinese sources.
__________________________________________________________

1279-1328 CE: John of Monte Corvino. Franciscan missionary, active in
Armenia and Persia, and then in India and China. He left Tabriz for
India in 1291 and arrived in Beijing probably after the death of
Qubilai Khan in 1294. He was elevated to the rank of Archbishop in ca.
1307 and continued to head the Catholic mission there until his death.
Although he did not write a travel narrative, several of his letters
have been preserved.

1316-1330 CE: Odoric of Pordenone. Franciscan monk who traveled via
Constantinople and the Black Sea to Persia, and then via the Indian
Ocean to India in the early 1320s. From there he sailed around
southeast Asia to the east coast of China and spent several years in
Beijing. His claim to have returned via Tibet is dubious, although he
apparently traveled overland, arriving back in Venice via the Black
Sea and Constantinople. His lengthy travel account, which he dictated
in 1330, became a "best seller," in part because of Odoric's
indiscriminate mixture of tall tales with more authentic information.
He occasionally notes aspects of Chinese culture that were ignored by
Marco Polo, "with whose account he was certainly familiar" (de
Rachewiltz). Important portions of his material were re-worked and
given a further fictional gloss by the author of the very popular late
medieval travel fable attributed to John Mandeville.
__________________________________________________________

1325-1354 CE: Ibn Battuta. A native of Tangier (Morocco), Shams al-Din
Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad Ibn Battuta (1304-1368/9 or 1377) is famous
for spending the years between 1325 and 1354, when he returned home,
traveling across North Africa and through much of Eurasia, all the way
to China. His initial goal was to participate in the pilgrimage to
Mecca (the hajj); his interest in Muslim holy men and places dominates
portions of his text. While he may have kept notes, the account as we
have it is "a work of literature, part autobiography and part
descriptive compendium" (Dunn). It was dictated to Ibn Djuzayy between
1354 and 1357. Some sections clearly do not contain eye-witness
material; chronology is often confused. There are critical views of
the value of his material on Iran and questions about how much he saw
in China. Among the most valuable sections are his descriptions of
Anatolia, the territories and customs of the Golden Horde, and
Southern India.

1333 CE: Nichiren Daishonin's designated successor, Nikko Shonin,
passes away at Omosu (2/7) and his designated successor, Nichimoku
Shonin passes away on the road to Kyoto to remonstrate with the
government, at Tarui (11/15).

After Nitta Yoshisada's army defeats the ruling Hojo clan of the
Kamakura Shogunate and Emperor Godaigo re-establishes the imperial
government at Kyoto, Nichimoku had decided to remonstrate with the new
government, which might bring on a new opportunity to refute the other
schools of Buddhism in front of the ruler of the nation. Tragically,
he is old and dies during the trip, with no capable successors.

The quick succession of their deaths creates a leadership struggle in
the Fuji School at Taisekiji (Nichiren Shu Komon Shu). The sect
quickly falls into a ruinous struggle which lasts for a century. (Note
that merely 7 years after their passing, Zen becomes the official
religion of the Shogunate.)

The Fuji School goes into decline.

1339-1353 CE: John of Marignolli. Franciscan sent as papal legate to
Yüan (Mongol) Emperor of China. Entered the lands of the Golden Horde
via the Black Sea. His route probably ran through Urgench (S. of Aral
Sea), via Hami (north of the Taklamakan) to Beijing and Shang-tu,
where he was received in August 1342. After three years, headed home
via ship to Hormuz and then overland to the Levant. Included his
travel recollections in his chronicle of the history of Bohemia; his
account was ignored until the nineteenth century.

1340 CE: Francesco Balducci Pegolotti. A Florentine merchant,
Pegolotti was active in the Eastern Mediterranean in the second
quarter of the fourteenth century, at which time he acquired first-
and second-hand information on the Asian trade. While he himself never
travelled further east, his account is of particular interest for its
description of the relative security of trade routes through the
territories of the Mongol Empire and the great variety of products
available in commercial centers such as Constantinople by about 1340.
His merchant handbook survived in a copy made in 1471.

.   Statute of Heresy (De Hæretico Comburendo (1401)
.
.   As witch hunters went to work, at least 200,000
.   died at the stake in Europe between the 11th and
.   18th centuries. In Britain there were sporadic
.   witch burnings until the De Hæretico Comburendo
.   (Statute of Heresy). This law enabled bishops to
.   arrest all those believed to have spoken out
.   against God, including preachers, schoolmasters
.   and writers.
.
.   Statutes of the Realm, 2:12S-28: 2 Henry IV
.
.   Whereas, it is shown to our sovereign lord the
.   king on the advice of the prelates and clergy of
.   his realm of England in this present Parliament,
.   that although the Catholic faith builded upon
.   Christ, and by his apostles and the Holy Church,
.   sufficiently determined, declared, and approved,
.   hath been hitherto by good and holy and most
.   noble progenitors and predecessors of our
.   sovereign lord the king in the said realm
.   amongst all the realms of the world most devoutly
.   observed, and the Church of England by his said
.   most noble progenitors and ancestors, to the
.   honor of God and the whole realm aforesaid,
.   laudably endowed and in her rights and liberties
.   sustained, without that the same faith or the
.   said church was hurt or grievously oppressed, or

.   wicked, heretical, or erroneous opinions. Yet,
.   nevertheless, divers false and perverse people of
.   a certain new sect, of the faith of the
.   sacraments of the church, and the authority of
.   the same damnably thinking and against the law of

third envoy, Gómez de Salazar, died en route. Traveled through the
Mediterranean to Constantinople, into the Black Sea to Trebizond and
then overland via Tabriz to Balkh, Kesh (Shahr-i Sabs) and Samarkand.
On return journey, they passed through Bukhara. Clavijo's account,
written soon after his return in 1406, is a very important source for
travel on the western part of the Silk Road. Its description of
Tamerlane's Samarkand is one of the fullest available and includes
substantial detail on economic life, trade with India and China, and
Timurid buildings.

1410, Tafur traveled from Spain to the Eastern Mediterranean and back.
While not a merchant, he was very interested in commercial affairs and
well connected with the trading networks. He was in Egypt, the Black

In his "Journey to Tana" he describes the regions adjoining the Black
Sea as well as distant Muscovy, which he never visited; his "Journey

The largest part of his travel account describes India; the account is
of some interest for his advice to fellow Christian merchants to leave
their faith at home and profess Islam if they wished to prosper on the
Silk Road. There is a 1958 Russian film based on his journey; a Soviet

1478 CE: The Spanish Inquisition (Local). As horrible as the Papal
Inquisition was (in both of its manifestations), in modern times, the
Spanish Inquisition has became almost synonymous with the excesses,
violence, and cruelty, and torture of the Inquisition. In 1478 Pope
Sixtus IV issued a bull authorizing King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella
to appoint an inquisitorial board (which occurred in 1480). The
express purpose of the Spanish Inquisition was to root out false
Christians in Spain -- especially Jews and Moslems who claimed to
convert to Christianity, but were still secretly practicing their
faith.

While the members of this board needed to be approved by the Pope, the
fact that the sovereigns of Spain appointed them was a significant
departure from the practices of the Papal Inquisition. During the
Papal Inquisition, the heads of the mendicant orders typically chose
inquisitors (grand inquisitors were chosen by the pope). Another
difference between the Papal Inquisition and the Spanish Inquisition
was that the Spanish government paid the expenses, and received the
net income, of the Inquisition.

1478 CE: Sixtus IV issues bull authorizing Ferdinand and Isabella to
appoint an inquisitorial board
1480 CE: Ferdinand and Isabella appoint first two Inquisitors; for
district of Seville
1481 CE: First auto-da-fé occurs; 6 people burned alive in Seville.
298 were burned by the end of the year. (Durant, Reformation, p. 213)
1482 CE: Seven additional Inquisitors named, including Tomas
Torquemada
1483 CE: Tomas Torquemada. As Grand Inquisitor, it is estimated that
over 100,000 people were sentenced as heretics under his jurisdiction.
(Hroch, p. 47.) Torquemada died in 1498, but not before he had
achieved his life's goal (next item).
March 30, 1492CE: All unbaptized Jews ejected from Spain; 50,000
accepted conversion, 100,000-200,000 left

.   Tomas de Torquemada
.
.   At his birth (1420, Valladolid, Castile, Spain)
.   Tomás already had something to hide: his
.   grandmother was a converso; a converted Jew; a
.   New Christian.
.
.   Spain had more converted Jews than any other
.   country; some had converted by choice, many more
.   by force, but they were all regarded with
.   suspicion and mistrust by the Old Christians.
.   Some, called Marranos, were only nominally
.   converted, and continued their Jewish customs in
.   secret.
.
.   The result was the Spanish cult of sangre limpia,
.   "pure blood", that is, pure white Christian
.   blood. Actually, since Spain had the largest
.   Jewish population in medieval Europe and
.   conversion and intermarriage were common, hardly
.   anyone had sangre limpia, but many claimed to,
.   and it was a constant preoccupation of the
.   nobility. Torquemada's life work was an attempts
.   to achieve sangre limpia for Spain.
.
.   By 1479, when Spain was unified under Ferdinand
.   and Isabella, Torquemada was a Dominican priest
.   and Isabella's confessor. Four years later he had
.   established himself as the head of the Spanish
.   Inquisition, appointed as Inquisitor General for
.   all of Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella.
.
.   The purpose of the Inquisition was to root out
.   heresy, and for Torquemada this meant destroying
.   the Marranos. The Inquisition published a set of
.   guidelines so that Catholics could inform on
.   their Marrano neighbors:
.
.   - If you see that your neighbors are wearing
.   clean and fancy clothes on Saturdays, they are
.   Jews.
.   - If they clean their houses on Fridays and light
.   candles earlier than usual on that night, they
.   are Jews.
.   - If they eat unleavened bread and begin their
.   meal with celery and lettuce during Holy Week,
.   they are Jews.
.   - If they say prayers facing a wall, bowing back
.   and forth, they are Jews.
.
.   The mildest penalty imposed on Marranos began
.   with the forfeiture of their property, which
.   proved to be a convenient fund-raising technique
.   for the war against the Moors. This was followed
.   by the public humiliation of being paraded
.   through the streets wearing the sambenito, a
.   sulfur-yellow shirt emblazoned with crosses that
.   came only to the waist, leaving the lower body
.   uncovered. They were then flogged at the church
.   door. This was the punishment suffered by Juan
.   Sánchez de Cepeda, the grandfather of Teresa de
.   Avila.
.
.   The scale of punishments continued up to burning
.   at the stake, which was performed as a public
.   spectacle called an auto-da-fé ("act of faith").
.   If the condemned recanted and kissed the cross,
.   they were mercifully garroted before the fire was
.   set. If they recanted only, they were burned with
.   a quick-burning seasoned wood. If not, they were
.   burned with slow-burning green wood.
.
.   In 1490 Torquemada staged a famous show-trial,
.   the LaGuardia trial. This involved eight Jews and
.   conversos, who were accused of having crucified a
.   Christian child. No victim was ever identified
.   and no body was ever found; nevertheless all
.   eight were convicted, on the strength of their
.   confessions which were obtained through torture.
.   They were burned at the stake.
.
.   Rumours about Jews committing ritual murder of
.   Christian children have circulated around Europe
.   for centuries and are known collectively as "the
.   blood libel." While there is no evidence to
.   support the blood libel, its opposite, the ritual
.   murder of Jews by Christians, is well known. The
.   Spanish Inquisition alone committed the ritual
.   murder of about thirty thousand Jews.
.
.   Torquemada used the LaGuardia trial to argue that
.   the Jews were a danger to Spain. His intention
.   was to convince Ferdinand and Isabella to order
.   their expulsion. Hearing of this, two influential
.   Jews raised thirty thousand ducats and offered it
.   to Ferdinand and Isabella, saying they could give
.   them even more if they would allow the Jews to
.   remain. Ferdinand and Isabella, always hard up
.   for cash, wavered at this; but Torquemada said,
.   "Judas sold his Master for thirty ducats. You
.   would sell Him for thirty thousand ... Take Him
.   and sell Him, but do not let it be said that I
.   have had any share in this transaction."
.
.   On March 31st, 1492, Ferdinand and Isabella
.   issued their Edict of Expulsion. "[We] have
.   decided to command all of the aforesaid Jews, men
.   and women, to leave our kingdoms and never to
.   return to them." The Jews were given until July
.   1st to leave the kingdom; any found within its
.   borders after that date would be killed. Some
.   fled to Portugal or North Africa, where they
.   faced more persecution; some took ship with a
.   foolhardy explorer named Christopher Columbus;
.   some remained in Spain as "Secret Jews", and
.   their descendants are still Secret Jews today.
.
.   Having accomplished the expulsion of the Jews,
.   Torquemada retired to the monastery of St. Thomas
.   in Avila, which he had designed himself. In his
.   last years he was convinced that he would be
.   poisoned, and kept a unicorn's horn by his plate
.   as an antidote. He was not poisoned, however, but
.   died a natural death in 1498.

1488 CE: The Ikko sect establishes hierocracy in Kaga domain in Japan.

Economic autonomy of monastery led not just to the independence of its
religious authority but also to claim its supremacy over secular
power. Weber states an unavoidable tension between the religious
charisma of the monk and the religious authority of the caesaro-papist
ruler:

Their [monks] charismatic religiosity rejects all caesaro-papist
intervention in religious affairs much more vigorously than does any
regular priesthood, and their strict ascetic discipline permits them
to establish a very strong power position. Once monasticism has gained
strength, it will clash sooner or later with caesaro-papist claims.

During the frequent wars and power struggles, the monastery became
militarized. Weber describes:

Given the thoroughly feudal character of the country, this competition
[feudal lords and Buddhist orders] often gave the monastic communities
of Japan the character of military communities of crusaders, of
monastic orders of knights, especially as long as the monks, or at
least the abbots, were recruited from noble strata. They fought at the
same time for their own position of power in the population.

In addition to the monastery, sectarian and independent community of
the laypeople also became militarized. The militarized followers of
the Ikko (Jodo Shin) sect even overthrew the Togashi House, the
military lord of Kaga domain, in 1468 and established a hierocratic
rule for a century. Thus, the monastery and the sectarian community of
the lay people became formidable religio-political authorities against
the secular power of the warrior lords.

Victims of the Spanish Inquisition

Jews and Muslems

There was a long history in Spain of persecution of Jews before the
Inquisition. During 1391 for example, over 50,000 Jews were murdered
by mobs. In 1492, the Jews in Spain were given the option of becoming
baptized Christians, or leaving Spain. It is estimated that about
50,000 "accepted" conversion, and 100,000-200,000 left Spain. Forced
Jewish converts were known as Marranos (meaning "swine"), conversos,
or "New Christians". While the Inquisition had no authority over
practicing Jews (who could not be branded as Christian heretics), the
Inquisition had great authority over the conversos, many of whom
continued to worship as Jews in secret.

The Inquisition drew up an elaborate list of "signs" by which a
"Judaizer" (a relapsed Jew) could be discovered, some of which are
included in the following "Edict of Faith" issued in Valencia in 1519:

"...changing into clean personal linen on Saturdays and wearing better
clothes than on other days; preparing on Fridays the food for
Saturdays, in stewing pans on a small fire; who do not work on Friday
evenings and Saturdays as on other days; who kindle lights in clean
lamps with new wicks, on Friday evenings; place clean linene on the
beds and clean napkins on the table; celebrate the festival of the
unleavened bread, eat unleavened bread and celery and bitter
herbs...who do not wish to eat salt pork, hares, rabbits, snails, or
fish that have not scales; who bathe the bodies of their dead...if any
know that in any house, people congregate for the purpose of carrying
on religious services, or read out of bibles in the vernacular or
perform other Judaic ceremonies..." - Edict of Faith issued in
Valencia in 1519 by Inquisitor Andres de Palacio (Roth, p. 77/79)

Moslems in Spain suffered a similar fate to the Jews -- convert, or be
exiled. Converted Moslems were known as Moriscos, and were viewed with
great suspicion by the Inquisition. Moslems that did not convert were
exiled from Spain -- by some estimates, up to 3,000,000 Moslems left
Spain between 1502 and 1615!

Protestants

Protestants were also frequent targets of the Spanish Inquisition.
Among the victims were native Protestants (Lutherans and Calvinists),
such as Francisco de San Roman, who was the first Protestant burned at
the stake in Spain, in 1540. More controversial were Protestants that
served on merchant vessels visiting Spanish ports. In 1565, for
example, 26 English subjects were burned at the stake, and 10 times
that number were sentenced to Inquisitorial prisons.

Needless to say, this situation became a major bone of contention
between Spain and its trading partners! In 1604, the Treaty of London
was signed, which forbade subjects of the King of England from being
persecuted for matters of conscience within the realm of the King of
Spain. However, a caveat existed in the treaty -- English subjects in
Spain were only safe provided they did not cause public scandal -- a
matter open to subjective judgement!

Like the Papal Inquisition in Italy in the 16th century, the Spanish
Inquisition was very successful at preventing Protestantism from
gaining a foothold in Spain.

1549 CE: Jesuit Francis Xavier begins first missionary of Christianity
in Japan. He is denied entry to do the same in China, due to the ban
on foreigners at the time. Xavier died from disease on an island off
the coast of China while waiting for a Chinese merchant to smuggle him
into the country.

Saint Francis Xavier was one of the most significant Jesuit
missionaries of modern time. He is known for having baptized 30,000
people. Xavier was canonized in 1622; his feast day is December 3.

Xavier was born 1506 in Northern Spain. He was the third son of a high
official at the court of Navarre, and, as was common among younger
sons of noble birth, destined for an education in theology.
Essentially, Xavier was obliged to enter the clergy, but no one would
have guessed the impact he would have on the Asian world. He began his
theological studies at the University of Paris in 1525. At this time
he met Ignatius Loyola who would be the single most influential man in
his life. Loyola was looking for a group of men who would join him in
his apostolic service to Christ. Xavier became a part of that group.
Together they were ordained priests in 1537, and shortly after helped
establish the Society of Jesus, commonly known as the Jesuits. From
this point on Xavier's life was devoted to missionary work.

In 1541 King John III of Portugal sought ministers to spread
Christianity to the Asians in his dominions. Loyola assigned Xavier
the task. His missionary work can be categorized into four major
areas: India, Malacca, Japan, and China.

Xavier arrived in Goa, India in 1542. The following two years he spent
among primitive pearl fishers on the Indian coast. Despite of language
difficulties he educated and baptized thousands. He founded schools
and made efforts to train ministers among the natives, which was an
unusual tactic during the 16th century.

The years of 1545-48 Xavier spent breaking new ground for the Jesuits
and the Catholic Church in the Malacca area. Before returning to the
Indian mainland he founded mission stations among the tribal peoples
who lived there. While living in Malacca, Xavier befriended a Japanese
Gentleman whose interest in Christianity inspired a journey to Japan
in 1549. After limited success inspiring the Japanese to conversion,
he went on to China and died in the attempt.

1557-1560 CE, 1561-1564 CE, 1566-1567 CE, 1571-1572 CE: Anthony
Jenkinson. Representing the English Muscovy Company and accompanied by
Richard and Robert Johnson, traveled via the White Sea and Moscow,
down the Volga River and across the Caspian Sea to Bukhara and then
back by the same route in 1557-60. In 1561-1564, via the same route to
the Caspian, he went to Persia to try negotiating trade agreements;

merchants. Jenkinson's subsequent trips did not take him beyond
Moscow. Beginning in 1546, well prior to his Russia service, Jenkinson
had traveled widely in the Mediterranean and the Levant.

1568 CE: Oda Nobunaga marches his powerful army into Kyoto and creates
a puppet Shogunate in Japan.

The death-struggle between the caesaro-papist authority and the
hierocratic authority was unavoidable, and it came to climax with
Nobunaga Oda (1534-82), a rationalist feudal lord. His introduction of
disciplined warfare and gun powder changed the power-position between
the secular lords and the Buddhist communities.

Oda destroyed the Enryakuji, the most militarized and prestigious
monastery, in 1571, the Ikko sect, the most powerful Buddhist sect, in
1580, and other strongholds of the militarized Buddhist community.

Furthermore, he supported the spread of the Catholic Christianity in
order to weaken the traditional and spiritual authority of the
Buddhist monk and priest.

restricted this power of the ecclesia militants [militarized Buddhist
communities]. An enormous massacre broke the politico-military power
of the Buddhistic monk orders forever, and the victors had no scruples
about making use of the assistance of Christianity, above all, of
Jesuit missionaries, for this purpose.

Thus, the power-struggle between Oda and the Buddhist community was
the watershed of Japanese caesaro-papism. And the Buddhist hierocracy
was rooted out.

Oda burned three thousand buildings of Mt. Hiei (Enryakuji), and

1966).

1579 CE: The Ohmi debate. Before the Tokugawa period, Oda Nobunaga
also demonstrated his supremacy over religious authority. Oda summoned
the doctrinal debate between the Ikko sect and the Nichiren sect in
Ohmi in 1579. He intentionally declared the defeat of the Nichiren
sect, and forced the Nichiren Buddhists to stop its aggressive
propagation. See Ooms, Tokugawa Ideology, (1985)  Nichiin is the 13th
High Priest at this time, he had assumed the position at the age of
nine and was the designated successor of Nitchen, who became 12th High
Priest at the age of thirteen. Clearly, preparation for the position
of High Priest at the Fuji School was not a requirement during this
period. The Fuji School goes into further decline.

.
.      'Nichiu's tenure as the ninth high priest

.   once again.'
.
.      'According to The Chronology of the Fuji

.   secular custom, the priesthood at Taisekiji
.   began appointing the children of powerful feudal
.   lords as successors to the office of high priest.
.   This indicates both the shortage of capable

.
.      'Many priests and members at the head temple's

.   and form a relationship with the living Sage
.   Nichiren" (Essential Writings of the Fuji School,

.
.      'Sakyo Nikkyo equated the Daishonin with the

.
.      'According to records kept by Nichiji, the

1579 CE, 1580-1582 CE, 1583-1584 CE: John Newbery.A London merchant,
Newbery undertook three trips. The first went only as far as the
Levant. The second took him from the Levant through Mesopotamia to the
Persian Gulf and Hormuz and then back through central Persia, the
southern fringe of the Caucasus, Anatolia, and Eastern Europe. On the
third he was accompanied by Ralph Fitch (see separate entry), John
Eldred (who stopped short of the Persian Gulf), William Leeds and
James Story all the way to the Mughal court in India. Newbery died on
the route home. He was the first Englishman to visit several of these
regions. Unfortunately, he never wrote much about his travels--notes
on the first and especially the second trip were apparently worked
into a narrative by Purchas in the 17th century; the third trip is
known from some letters, Fitch's account, and Linschoten.

1580 CE: Oda destroys the Ikko sect in Japan.

Kitagawa narrates the death-struggle between Oda and the Ikko sect:
"In 1570 Nobunaga's forces attacked Ishiyama [the center of the Ikko
sect], but the monto (followers of the sect) came from all parts of
Japan to defend their holy city, and Nobunaga's army was completely
defeated.... Nobunaga attacked the followers of the True Pure Land
[Ikko] in the Owari district, near Nagoya, but failed miserably in
1571, 1573, and 1574. Then the desperate Nobunaga tricked the Ikko by
offering peace, only to turn about and massacre nearly forty thousand
believers in Owari. In 1575 he dispatched his forces to the Hokuriku
district and massacred forty thousand more adherents of Ikko. In 1576
Nobunaga again attacked Ishiyama; however, not only was his army
defeated, but he himself was wounded. In the following year Nobunaga's
forces attacked the Wakayama district which had supplied men and
materials to Ishiyama.... Finally, in 1580, the temple town of
Ishiyama surrendered" (Kitagawa 1966).

1582 CE: Oda Nobunaga is betrayed by a vassal and murdered. Toyotomi
Hideyoshi inherits full power over clan,  in Japan.

Hideyoshi Toyotomi, Oda's vassal, completed the demilitarization of
the Buddhist community and the subject. In 1578, Toyotomi subjugated
other strongholds of the militarized monasteries (Negoro, Kumano, and
Koya), and conducted the Sword Hunt all over the land. In 1586,
Toyotomi summoned hundreds of the monk and priest from all sects and
major monasteries to conduct the prayer for the Toyotomi Shogunate and
the Toyotomi family. He intended to demonstrate his supremacy over
religious authority.

Nichio, the leader of the Fuju-fuse, alone refused the summon claiming
the supremacy of Buddhist authority (buppo) over secular authority
(oho). For a detailed account of this incident, see Herman Ooms,
Tokugawa Ideology, (1985) p. 190.

1583 CE: Matteo Ricci: A Jesuit mathematician who learned fluent
Chinese and established the first successful mission in China after
others had failed and been expelled.

In 1552, Matteo Ricci was born in Macerata, in central Italy to a
noble family. His father, Giovanni Battista, was a pharmacist and
devoted his life to public affairs once serving as Marcerata's
governor. His mother, Giovanna Angiolelli, was known for her piety.
Matteo was the oldest child in the family and learned primarily at
home. On August 15, 1571, Matteo Ricci decided to enter into the
Jesuit order against his father's wishes. Matteo Ricci entered the
order and soon after devoted himself to scientific research and also
the exploration of the new world. He studied science with
mathematician Christopher Clavius. Later, he was assigned to work in
the China mission arriving in the Far East in 1583. Known as Li Madou
to the Chinese, Ricci accomplished many tasks in his twenty-seven
years of living in China as a missionary. In the field of math, he was
able to translate Christopher Clavius' works in Geometrica Practica
and Trigonometrica bringing western mathematics and different
trigonometric and astronomical instruments to China. Furthermore, at
one point, he became the court mathematician in Beijing. In addition
to his mathematical achievements, he was able publish the first maps
of China made available for the West. He was also able to translate
the first six books of the Euclid into Chinese.

1583-1591 CE: Ralph Fitch.English merchant (d. 1611) who traveled with
John Newbery (s. v.) via the Levant and Mesopotamia to India, through
northern India and on as far as Malacca (in Malaysia) before returning
home via the Persian Gulf, to discover in London that he was presumed
dead and his property had been divided among his heirs. He later
returned to Aleppo. He apparently did not keep a diary; in writing
down his account, in part with the encouragement of Hakluyt, he drew
upon the travel account by the Italian Cesare Federici. The Indian
section of Fitch's account is "disappointingly meagre and haphazard";
clearly he must have known a lot more than made its way into writing.
Since, unlike Newbery, he survived to tell the tale, he often is given
the greater prominence of the two.
1602-1607. Benedict Goës. In 1594 the Portuguese Jesuit Benedict Goës
joined a mission to the Mughal Emperor Akbar, where he was chosen by
the Jesuit leadership (partly because of his knowledge of Persian) to
travel on an exploratory mission to China via Kashgar. He died before
reaching Beijing; what survived of his notes and letters and some oral
accounts were later (1615) combined by the famous Jesuit missionary
Matteo Ricci into his travel journal. Despite some inconsistencies and
problems in dating, the account is a unique record by a European of
travel on the overland trade routes in inner Asia at the beginning of
the seventeenth century. One is struck by the route itself-- heading
northwest into Afghanistan before going north across the Hindu Kush to
the headwaters of the Amu Darya, then east to Sarikol and on to
Yarkand and Kashgar before skirting the Taklamakan on the north. The
account details human and natural threats to travel and other aspects
of the inner Asian trade, and provides some valuable information on
the political divisions of the time.

violating every admonition of the founder, and most of Nichiren's
teachings. Nissei became corrupted, and with the complicity of the
Shogun's niece, placed the Fuji School under the Tokugawa Shogun's
rule. Other Nichiren sects (like the Fuju-Fuse sect), that did not
have the benefits of Nikko's understanding of Nichiren's Buddhism,
actually resisted the Shogunate more than Nissei.

Tokugawa Ieyasu, one of Hideyoshi's vassals, defeats rivals at

Once the Shogunate destroyed the military power of the Buddhist
communities, the spread of Christianity was also unfavorable for the
caesaro-papist interest. To the Tokugawa Shogunate, the demilitarized
Buddhist sects were easier to control than hierarchical Catholic
Church.

The Shogunate banned, persecuted, and finally terminated Christianity
by 1660, which once counted over 300,000 believers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Weber writes: &quot;The ascension of the Tokugawa Shoguns put an end to

this [the Christian mission]. They did not wish to exchange Buddhistic
clericalism for the rule of a clergy directed from abroad".

Reischauer and Craig estimate that "there were 150,000 Japanese
converts around 1582, some 300,000 by the end of the century, and
perhaps as many as 500,000 in 1615".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Weber writes: The religious edict of 1614 and the subsequent
">

persecution of Christians finished the Christian mission in Japan and
its establishment. Therewith, all clericalism in Japan was broken.

The persecution was targeted not just to Christianity but also to non-
conformist Buddhist sects, especially, the Fuju-fuse ("No receiving
and no giving") group of the Nichiren sect. The edict of 1614
denounced Christianity and the Fuju-fuse who were alike in insisting
on having their own rites and temples and in refusing to support the
worship of the parishes where they might reside. The Shogunate called
them "enemies of the Empire and the objects of the people's
hostility" (quoted in Eliot). The Shogunate banned the Fuju-fuse and
banished the leaders such as Nichio (1565-1630) and Nikko (1626-98).

In 1599 Ieyasu held a Buddhist service summoning a thousand monks and
priests from all sects and major monasteries. Ieyasu followed the
example of Hideyoshi to demonstrate the supremacy of his secular power
over religious authority. And again Nichio refused to participate the
service for the same reason that he made to Hideyoshi. Then Ieyasu
held the doctrinal debate between the Fuju-fuse and other Nichiren
sects. Ieyasu declared the defeat of the Fuju-fuse and banished Nichio
and his followers. The Tokugawa Shogunate outlawed the Fuju-fuse again
in 1630 and 1663. See Ooms, Tokugawa Ideology, (1985)

Shogun's caesaro-papist interest had taken any opportunity to break
the prestige and authority of the Buddhist sects.

Before the Tokugawa period, Oda also demonstrated his supremacy over
religious authority. Oda summoned the doctrinal debate between the
Ikko sect and the Nichiren sect in Ohmi in 1579. He intentionally
declared the defeat of the Nichiren sect, and forced the Nichiren
Buddhists to stop its aggressive propagation. See Ooms, Tokugawa
Ideology, (1985)

To weaken the strong hierarchical organization of the Ikko (Jodo Shin)
sect, the Shogun, Ieyasu Tokugawa (1542-1616), interfered with the
succession of the chief priest in 1602, and caused the division of the
sect.

Ieyasu Tokugawa sided with the Abbot Kyonyo in a dispute with Abbot
Junnyo over the succession of the 12th patriarch. Kyonyo's supporters
became known as Higashi (East) Honganji and Junnyo's Nishi (West)
Honganji.

Finally, the Shogunate instituted the state Buddhist church.

A church, in the sociological term, means "a compulsory institution
for universal salvation," in contrast to a sect, "a voluntary
association of selected individuals." See Weber, Economy and Society.

Every household was ordered to become affiliated with a parish temple
(danka-dera). Every denomination of the Buddhist church was organized
into hierarchy (hon-matsu ji). The parish temple issued a certificate
(tera-uke) to prove that an individual was not a member of a forbidden
sect. Those temples which had no hierarchical affiliation were
demolished.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Weber writes: The Buddhist church was restored and for the first time
">

systematically organized. But this occurred entirely under the
auspices of the state.... Since the Tokugawa Iemitsu, no priest was
allowed to officiate without having passed an examination in the
Chinese manner.

The head of Buddhist church was the Shogun, and the department of
temple and shrine (jisha-bugyo) controlled religious matters. Compared
with other caesaro-papist regimes, however, the Shogunate could not
control Buddhism completely like in China nor destroy like in Korea
because Buddhism had established social prestige and intellectual
authority, and formed the communities of the lay people.

The number of Buddhist temples increased more than 30 times before the
institutionalization at the cost of the autonomy and prestigious
authority.

Kitagawa estimates that the number of temple increased to more than 35
times between the Kamakura and the Tokugawa periods: "Such a policy
necessitated the existence of a temple in every town and village;
thus, which there only 13,037 temples during the Kamakura era, the
number increased to 469,934 during the Tokugawa period" (Kitagawa
1966).

In contrast, the temple lands decreased from 40 % of the late Heian
period to 1 % in the beginning of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Hall
estimates the figure "something over one per cent of tax-bearing land
of Japan, a figure estimated at 1444, 000 koku during the 1660s" (Hall
1959, 287).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Weber writes: The number of Buddhist monasteries and temples increased
">

tremendously, but the social power of the monks declined. The purchase
of priestly offices seems to have been widely practiced.

"Buddhism became nothing more than a department of the feudal
regime" (Kitagawa 1966). State Buddhism became ritualized and
democratized, and thereby lost prestige and religious authority.

Weber continues: In the monastic schools in general, they acquired
only what was necessary for the practical management of the cult.
Therewith the prestige of monasticism and Buddhism decreased; socially
to a considerable extent.

Thus, the Tokugawa Shogunate successfully turned salvational and
prophetical Buddhist sects into ritualistic and magical cult of the
Buddhist church.

Here the word "unorganized" refers to belief and value-orientation,
not economic interest. In contrast, American society is characterized
to the organized demos: "American democracy is not a sand-pile of
unrelated individuals but a maze of highly exclusive, yet absolutely
voluntary sects, associations and clubs, which provide the center of
the individual's social life.... The sect and its derivations are one
of her unwritten but vital constitutional elements, since they shape
the individual more than any other influence" (Weber 1968).

Under the pacification of the land, however, the feudal rulership was
stereotyped. The Shogun could not demonstrate its military charisma
against the threat of foreign power in the later 19th century. On this
occasion, the disciplined local army destroyed Shogun's feudal
rulership in 1868.
