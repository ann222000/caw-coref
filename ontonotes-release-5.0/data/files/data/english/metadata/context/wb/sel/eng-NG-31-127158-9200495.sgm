Since Essen would appear to be out of reach this year, Drexoll's 24-
hour gaming was timely in scratching my gaming convention itch.  If
you attended as well, please post your experience on this year's
edition of Vancouver's gaming nirvana.

Upon my 6:30 pm arrival, I found an ongoing game of Colosseum
involving, amongst others, Devon, Shannon and Dan (Casterman); plus,
Pat and Derek were finishing up a game of Einfach Genial Reiseedition
(Ingenious - Travel Edition).  At that point, the event was well under
way, but people were still arriving and the contest for the event was
not yet explained.  With no more seats available at Drexoll, people
were just starting to be ushered into the overflow seating at Saffron,
the restaurant a couple of doors over.

Drexoll's Darcy announced the contest for the 24-hour event and
proudly displayed it's trophy.  As with the Stanley Cup, the winner
get's enshrined with their name written on the hallowed piece of
hardware, but cannot take it home.  The throngs in the street really
would have overcome the city anyway, so maybe that was just as well.
As I wasn't staying for the entire 24-hours, I only briefly listened
to the rules of the contest so please correct me if I am incorrect, or
fill in some details where they are lacking.  Basically, everyone had
to write down, on the paper provided, which games they played, with
whom, and what place they finished in those games.  Then, everyone
would holds hands, chant to Cthulhu, and follow that with a short but
reverent prayer to Reiner Knizia.  Like I say, I could be wrong.

Pat, Derek and I walked on over to Saffron and made ourselves at
home.  Nice place, Saffron.  Their special games night menu included a
burger combo, various sides including salad and cut fries, plus
brownies, cookies and assorted yummies were available.  It seemed like
a plum move, heading over to the place with all the food.  Was it?
Perhaps, but all was not entirely what it seemed.  More about that in
a bit.

Our first game was a four-player game of If Wishes Were Fishes, taught
by our fourth: Tamara of Drexoll.  That almost sounds like some sort
of medieval title.  However, let's not let Tamara get wind of this,
'else she might insist on being addressed as &quot;Lady Tamara Paulin of
Drexoll&quot; or something like that, complete with the requisite curtsies
and what not.  So, back to the fishes and the worms.  Yes, worms.
That is the hype of this game.  There is much discussion on the Geek
about whether this game offers more than just cutesy, squirmy worms.
I would say that there is a game there, but it wasn't something that
made me run back to Drexoll to make a purchase.  Still, I'd like to
play again to better evaluate it, so that says something.  Can't
remember who won (I think it was Derek or Pat), but can say that it
wasn't me.

It was during our game of &quot;don't eat the french fry-shaped worms&quot; that
Pat and Derek's burgers arrived.  The plates certainly looked
appetizing.  It's too bad that the meat wasn't fully cooked.  Now
don't get me wrong: I am not ragging on Saffron.  It is a top notch
place.  They were very apologetic and immediately fixed the burgers
and both Pat and Derek were absolutely forgiving themselves; plus, the
Saffronites, of their own suggestion worked on improving the overhead
lighting above our table.  The consequence of this, however, was that
foreign substances were seen to descend upon the area; most
unfortunately, this also included Pat's burger.  Again, I don't want
to rag on the fine people at Saffron.  Upon hearing about this mishap
later in the eve - and this wasn't even Pat or Derek reporting it, the
fine restaurant folk were more than forthcoming with a refund.  Every
restaurant experiences problems at one time or another, it's how they
deal with them that really matters and I give Saffron top marks in
this regard.

The second game to hit the table was Mesopotamia - a game that I
greatly appreciated learning from Pat and Derek because I own it.  In
classic Tikal, Mexica, Java fashion, this game uses the action point
system to great success.  It is easy enough to learn, but not an easy
game to   win.  Derek won this one with a strong finish.  Now that I
have had my learning game, I am eager to play this one again soon.

One thing to keep in mind for next year's 24-hour gaming, should
Drexoll use Saffron again - and despite the aforementioned problems, I
DO hope they use Saffron again - is that as people started to vacate
the restaurant (which, BTW, has very high ceilings so does not appear
to retain heat especially well), it got considerably colder.  Make a
mental note to bring a warm sweater next year.

The final game, for me at any rate, was my copy of Elasund, which was
new to both Derek and Pat.  It's part of the Catan family of games
(Elasund is the first city of Catan), but is different enough to stand
on it's own merit.  Again, as with Mesopotamia, Elasund is a
relatively easy game to learn, but not necessarily easy to discern a
winning strategy, especially in it's early stages.  This was evidenced
by virtue of my 1.5 games experience providing me with the victory.
All told, the game appeared to go over well and could make another
appearance soon.  Dan observed a bit of our game and noted that he too
really enjoys it.

The final part of the evening saw us watching part of a somewhat
subdued game of Last Night On Earth, the Zombie Game.  Well, maybe it
was too late in the eve for zombie theatrics and apparently we had
missed Devon's zombie stylings in the game's early stages.  Anyway, it
was just after 1am and time for me to hit the road.  The evening was a
thoroughly enjoyable one.  Pity I couldn't stay for the whole 24-
hours.

awww man, I wish I didn't miss out on this but on the good news side,
we sold our apartment so our new house will have room for games (not
that we will be able to afford any) and room to game in. Perhaps a
x-mas party/games night may be in order.....all contingent on us
finding a house before then of course. :)
We can even have undercooked burgers for Pat and Derek to have fond
memories of...

Hi all,
I need to get a copy of Age of Empires III. Therefore I am going to place an order at www.germangames.com .

Does anyone want in on the order? No rush, I was thinking about placing the order in a week or so.

Email me if you want in.

Yes, that would be just great Mike!  Undercooked burgers, and don't
forget to sprinkle them liberally with tiny shards of glass!  :)

Zombie theme!

MUST...     EAT...     RAW...     MEAT!!!

We were on the West Side and brains are so like, last week.
