Clark Holloway commented today:

&quot;R. Kennedy may not have a lot of credibility on HLAS (and deservedly
so, in my opinion), but he was apparently the first on SHAKSPER to
provide actual evidence that Ford wrote the Elegy. Whatever we may
think of him, a person with any integrity must acknowledge that he
made a shrewd guess, if nothing else.&quot;

Of course it's a pleasure to receive compliments about my discovery
that the Funeral Elegy was written by John Ford. But it was not a
&quot;shrewd guess&quot;. I was directed to my study of the poem because of an
acrostic/anagram set quite boldly into the text. John Ford wrote the
thing and he said so. With a bit of study, sorting out of the cipher
upon the strictest rules, that's the message I found.

Naturally, I couldn't say that my discovery came by way of an cipher,
so I had to set out some scholarly proofs in order to convince Foster
(and he is convinced) that Ford wrote the Elegy.

I'm quite happy the way it turned out and that I didn't have to go to
the covert proof given by John Ford. It probably wouldn't have been
believed, and certainly the greatest living Renaissance scholar of
Rhetoric (Brian Vickers) wouldn't have been interested if I hadn't
given more than an acrostic/anagram to back up my discovery.

But surprisingly, it was fairly easy to collect evidence. The poem is
very like the young John Ford and very unlike Shakespeare of any date.
My advantage over the other searchers is that I could go directly to
John Ford because of the cipher. I didn't have to fool about
searching the poems of other writers. John Ford was the poet, the
acrostic/ anagram was quite straightforward about that. The initials
&quot;W.S.&quot; I could completely ignore.

The SHAKSPER archives have the entire discussion. Foster spent some
time trying to get the ups on me, and on one or two occasions I was
tempted to bring up the anagram for proof, but held back, certain that
some cool scholar would see that I had John Ford's identity down cold
without having to bring up the despised practice of Jacobean
ciphering.

This note is prompted by such as Holloway who think I made a &quot;shrewd
guess&quot;, and had nothing else going for me. Actually, I had a good
solid piece of ciphering followed up with some scholarship that is
respected and complimented, thank you. It just bothers me when people
say I took a lucky guess, as it were, which denies the genius of John
Ford in the placing of his acrostic/anagram in the poem. Without
that, and my finding of it, the Funeral Elegy, that morbid piece of
weepy moralizing would still be in the books, maybe forever, and I
appreciate everyone's thanks that I led the way in dumping it.

Of course, it probably helped that the &quot;scholarly proofs&quot; you came up with
had come from Foster's book and hand-out.

Actually, Vickers doubted the attribution from the beginning. In my
opinion, he's being extremely generous in granting you precedence for making
the correct attribution. But since he hadn't lighted on Ford as the most
likely author until *after* you had posted your guess on SHAKSPER, I'm
assuming that he was honor bound to acknowledge it.

So I understand. Foster was apparently handing it out at the door of the
conference you attended.

Yeah, I missed that one. Vickers mentions on page 300 of his book that your
SHAKSPER post of 3/1/96 quoted the parallels from Foster's book and
hand-out. So you at least had Foster's own work going for you.

There is zero reason to believe that Wells, Monsarrat, Vickers, Jackson,
Elliott, Valenza, or any other doubters of the Shakespeare ascription would
have sat idly by if you hadn't boldly blazed the trail for them. Some were
already well advanced in their work before you posted your guess on
SHAKSPER. Integrity may demand that you be granted precedence for being the
first to publicly make the correct ascription, but it doesn't require that
we feed your ego.

And for the record, I refuse to inquire as to the nature of the alleged
&quot;acrostic/anagram,&quot; being content to let R. Kennedy continue to live in his
self-congratulatory fantasyland. Others may feel compelled to inquire, but
I'd caution that the sheer agony of reading what he'd have to say about it
must surely outweigh any amusement value there may be.

I certainly appreciate Clark's grudging compliments upon my finding of
John Ford as the poet of the Funeral Elegy. The fact is that Foster
might have discovered this himself, but he was after bigger game,
loaded for Shakespeare.

Foster considered several poets as &quot;W.S.&quot;, amongst them John Ford, but
he threw them all out, rejected all of them and went for Shakespeare.
He couldn't have gone back, and when I took up what he threw away, he
asked me for my credentials.

You might think that Foster hadn't the slightest idea that it was John
Ford, and he'd spent several year's studying the poem. It took me
about a month to find out that John Ford was certainly the writer, and
which Foster has finally admitted, or at least he can think of no
better candidate.

The press of the press, and fame, and signing autographs is no fun I
can tell you. Except for the free lunches and speaking engagement
fees, I wish I'd never have found out that John Ford wrote that awful
poem.

Grudging is probably the best you're going to get around here.

The first intentionally funny thing you've said in a long time. How's that
for a grudging compliment?

Now that your attribution has been endorsed by Foster himself and
there is a growing consensus that it is correct, nothing prevents you
from disclosing the &quot;acrostic/anagram&quot; that led to your discovery. I
just hope it is as funny as the &quot;anagram&quot; that you and Eva Turner Clark
apparently jointly hallucinated.
