hi

a friend of mine might get permission to put up an antenna or two on top
of his apt building  about 30 stories up  mostly flat roof

the other buildings for a good distance are less than 6 stories

so i was wondering   how do you protect  something like that from
lightning

even if he disconnects the rig from the antenna   you've still got well
over 100ft of coax  with a lot of charge

there are no other antennas up there   just  a red flashing light ontop
of the elevator room

what is typically done?

running a heavy cable to ground  downside the buidling is out

i guess it wouldn't be  'code'  to grab a electrical ground out of the
elevator room,     and i guess equally bad to tie into the steal girders
in there

so how do the pro's  do it??

The building has no lightning protection in place now?

Likely the building already has air terminals (lightning rods) around
its periphery. These probably are connected with heavy cable to the the
steel skeleton of the building. If not, that is another story.

Your friend needs to directly ground his antennas to the same system as
the air terminals for lightning protection.

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;i might have over looked the obvious,  i didn't get to walk the
roof,  but looking at it from the ground   or building apartment to the
other building it's 1 of 2 buildings (twins)  no obvious lightning rods
that i can see  any place  thou i can't totally see  the roof

the only thing i can clearly see is 2 red lights on a short pole on the
wall of the elevator room

i'll certainly look for lightning protection if it's there great  if not
i dunno

just seems to me a really really tall building   out in the open,  with
a ham antenna   ontop  can certainly get it's share  of zaps

thanks all

Hi Myles,

Your friend may stand getting static from the FAA if those red lights
are aeronautical warning lights.  If so (and this is just a guess),
then he may be required to light up his mast (as well as paint it).

Checking with authorities might be warranted.

The steel structure of the sky scraper is one of the best grounds you
could have.  It is effectively a Faraday shield around everything.

You ought to find out where the ground connections for the existing
lighting rods are and use that.  If there are no lightning rods around
(shudder) find some structural steel close to your antenna, and bug
(clamp) on to it.  I would also suggest following an electrical panel
ground around to see where its ground is.  They too ought to be on
building steel.

Good Luck!

Even if it does, this antenna is likely to protrude above its zone.

you don't.  you add proper arresters and connect to the existing building
ground to handle the inevitable direct strokes.  and don't do it on the
cheap or he may be liable for damage to lots of other stuff when the
lightning follows his transmission line into the otherwise safe building.

hate to show my ignorance, but  are the ibeams  really 'ground'?
usually i've seen them either sitting on concreate squares  or  on
larger concreate foundation wall like things   so i always figured
they'd be rather isolated from ground  beside what little connecitivity
was in the concreate itself    which i know would carry a lightning
strike,  if hit   but not the other way around  ie higher resistance
so i ponder

same for the electrical pannel ground  to be attached to  the building
steel   ??

i dunno

If the building steel weren't grounded, you'd have serious damage every
time a thunderstorm came along.  The building would get struck by
lightning and then it would have to make a path to ground SOMEHOW.
Often, static charges could build up just from wind blowing past a
building.  Can you imagine the static discharge of a whole building
against some poor slob who happens to touch it by accident?  It would be
deadly...

In any case, most building standards I've heard of do require building
steel to be grounded.

One of the BEST POSSIBLE grounds uses rebar in buried concrete;
Google for "ufer ground" and read to your heart's content.

When I had a basement built beneath my house, I installed a Ufer
ground in the footing around about half of its perimeter.
