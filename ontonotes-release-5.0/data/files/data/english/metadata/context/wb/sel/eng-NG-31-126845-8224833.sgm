Rove Talks: If Mistakes Were Made, They Weren't His
By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

Karl Rove says he feels like Moby Dick.

In a television tour of three Sunday morning shows as his departure
from the White House nears, Mr. Rove, President Bush's chief political
adviser, complained that Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill were
Captain Ahabs relentlessly pursuing him as the big white whale.

&quot;Let's face it, I mean, I'm a myth,&quot; Mr. Rove told Chris Wallace on
&quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; when asked about his critics. &quot;You know, I'm
Beowulf, you know, I'm Grendel. I don't know who I am. But they're
after me.&quot;

In the spirited hunt for White House culprits, Mr. Rove is certainly a
favorite target, though many Republicans are also inclined to blame
him for the sinking popularity of the president and his party.

Mr. Rove, who is leaving the White House at the end of the month,
didn't cut an especially heroic or villainous figure. The strategist
who looms in the public imagination as a political mastermind and West
Wing Svengali used a rare appearance on camera to deliver an exiting
White House aide's most time-honored Washington message: mistakes were
not made, and it's not my fault.

He even denied responsibility for his hip-hop performance as a rapping
&quot;M.C. Rove&quot; at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner in
March.

&quot;They dragged me up there,&quot; he told Mr. Wallace. &quot;I was uncomfortable,
and I said, 'I've got a choice. I can be irritated and everybody will
see it, or I can play along and try and show them I'm a good sport.' &quot;
He noted that his black-tie rap routine, shown over and over on
television and the Internet, was his &quot;most humiliating moment in
Washington, bar none.&quot;

The incident, and a video clip of it, didn't come up during Mr. Rove's
appearance on &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; perhaps because David Gregory, the NBC
White House correspondent who filled in on Sunday for Tim Russert, had
also been dancing on stage that night.

Mr. Rove said he was blameless as well for his role in the unmasking
of a C.I.A. operative, Valerie Wilson. White House officials were
accused of seeking to discredit her husband, Joseph C. Wilson IV, who
wrote an Op-Ed article in The New York Times in 2003 questioning the
administration's case for war in Iraq.

Asked by Mr. Gregory if he owed Ms. Wilson an apology, Mr. Rove gave a
one-word answer, &quot;No.&quot;

Mr. Gregory asked Mr. Rove if he felt responsible for the downward
slide of the Republican Party. &quot;Well, look, everyone who identifies
with the Republican Party ought to, ought to, ought to feel some
responsibility,&quot; he replied.

Mr. Rove said the Constitution prevented him from complying with a
Congressional subpoena to describe his part in the firings of United
States attorneys.

When Mr. Wallace argued that executive privilege did not prevent him
from answering a reporter's questions (&quot;Why did you push to fire some
U.S. attorneys in the president's second term?&quot;), Mr. Rove turned
testy. &quot;I know you don't understand you're being an agent of Congress
when you ask me that question,&quot; he said. &quot;But you are.&quot;

Fox News is usually considered by Bush officials as a safe harbor. But
Mr. Wallace had the most prickly, and probing, interview with Mr.
Rove, which is not surprising; Mr. Wallace has a way of needling his
guests, Republicans and Democrats alike. Last year, he goaded Bill
Clinton into an angry outburst during a discussion of Osama bin Laden.

Sometimes, however, honey works just as well. Bob Schieffer, who
conducts interviews on &quot;Face the Nation&quot; on CBS as if they were chats
over predinner drinks at the Metropolitan Club, asked Mr. Rove why he
was subjecting himself to Sunday morning second-guessing.

&quot;Somebody else made the decision for me,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm just doing
what I was instructed to do.&quot;

Rove must have a split-personality disorder; he blames &quot;somebody else&quot;
for every damned thing, when we know he's the one who made those bad
decisions.

Did anyone else hear Matt Cooper say on Meet the Press that Rove was
the one who outed Valerie Plame? There's a video clip here:
