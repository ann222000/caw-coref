Okay, here's where this question comes from.  It's kinda related to an
earlier discussion about delivery mechanisms, and how there's a huge
learning curve to get over.  And in particular, a bandwidth curve.

My Mom asked me the other day about my MP3 player.  I waxed poetic about
audio books (she listens to lots of books on tapes and CDs), podcasts
(she's an NPR fan), and a couple other options.

But she's older (she's my Mom, and for that matter, AARP is lusting for -
my- next birthday), she's on a fixed income, and she has dialup.  And she
doesn't feel motivated to keep even that, much.

So there I am, trying to explain MP3 players and podcasts and their value
to her, and after trying to show where she could get them, came to the
conclusion that she really couldn't get them in any practical fashion,
because she's on dialup.

Yeah, higher-bandwidth options are cheaper than they used to be, but only
sometimes, and not by much.  Fixed income usually means fixed at a low
level.  So, dialup.

After trying to do what I remembered of the math, it looks like there is
no practical way at all to listen to podcasts without a pretty damn fast
connection of one sort or another.  Not even to the AM Monaural Broadcast
radio level.  The files are pretty damn big, and one would have to do a
really, really short show to get within reasonable download size.

Granted, Blogs are a viable option, kinda, since it's mostly just text on
a webpage.  Until you combine a fixed income with failing eyesight.  And
if she could read a book comfortably in the firat place, she wouldn't need
the audio books so badly.

I won't say &quot;podcasts&quot; are elitist, because I don't think podcasts or
podcasters are intentionally elitist in what they say or in who they
intend to speak to.  Nobody I know, anyway.  Ayn Rand wouldn't have had a
podcast.  But maybe she would -- she wrote like kind of a sociopath, and
everyone was required to listen -- when I was in school, some of her crap
was still required reading.

I don't know of any current podcasts that are deliberately trying to make
their programs less accessible to older folks, starting with officially-
older-folks me in maybe a year, btw.  What I'm concerned about is that the
accessibility problem isn't as limited as I have sometimes seen it, and
isn't limited to what sort of software and hardware you use for access.
Decent audio quality requires a pretty damn big file for any significant
length.  And big files take bigtime bandwidth to download in a reasonable
time, say, less than an hour or so.

Because of the format of the content, and because of the size of the
content, we can only offer what we have to those who can afford it, which
means people who can afford a really decent DSL connection at the very
least -- even a slower DSL connection is way too slow for any longer show.
So we're talking to the economic elite, since there really isn't a middle
class, anymore.

And people on &quot;fixed incomes,&quot; which is a euphemism for &quot;low incomes&quot;
(which is why they called it &quot;fixing&quot; Social Security), use dialup because
it's cheap.  Or use nothing at all, because that's cheaper.

So, yeah, I do a hokey little Midwestern show, and I'm trying to make my
content appealing to folks like me.  But why bother?  I'm an exception,
I'm helping to pay for a shared decent-speed DSL connection, and that
serves well enough to download the many podcasts I listen to -- taking
several hours to download all of them, in an automated process off my
mailserver, at 3 or 4 in the morning.

Most people my age, in my area and my level of income -- most of my real
potential audience -- can't afford to even download my show, and probably
never will.

So if you really wanna talk about the technical limitations on the
audience of podcasting, you gotta include bandwidth, bigtime.  Not that
the technical aspects aren't profoundly daunting.  I couldn't even find
the right language to explain to my Mom what is meant by podcasting.  Not
that a lot of podcasts and similar stuff wouldn't be useful and desirable
for her, but she won't have them, because she's on dialup.

And at her age, &quot;someday&quot; won't help.

So.  Is there a way to fix the process of distributing podcasts that will
make them accessible to those to whom DSL is something their kids can
afford, and they can choose as compared to, say, eating?  I could pay for
hers myself, as compared to, say eating.  Or podcasting.

Based on the bandwidth issue alone, I don't think our position as
podcasters is comparable to the Golden Age of Radio.  It's like the days
when a few random tinkerers who could wind their own coils and track down
a chunk of Galenium crystal.  And it's not even that good -- once you
bought a crytal, you had it.  No monthly fees.

Nobody else listened, and nobody else could listen, because at the time,
the effort and cost was way beyond them.

So?  Answers?  Further problems?  Suggestions?  Hints?

How do we turn what we have into what Radio used to offer, before the
medium was taken over by the ...

Insert words as appropriate.  You know what I'm asking.

I think that what you're thinking about is not totally out of reach. I would
like to believe that technologies like wide area wireless networking might
mean that you can just bring your mom a wireless network adapter and then
&quot;Whammo&quot; she's on the Fast Web. It could happen. I'm all the time hearing
about Google rolling out free intarwebs.

The only other thing I can think of is: burning MP3s to CDs? Then you have
other problems, like how to play them. One of my friends at work has an MP3
CD player, which allows him to hear MP3s that are on CDs.

Ultimately, though, I think that podcasts will not be truly universally
available until universal wireless internet for free is a reality.

Well - if she is really interested - she can certainly subscribe to a
few podcasts - as long as it is not overwhelming - and let them
download overnight.  I've certainly been known to transfer shows from
my TIVO to my PC and convert to my iPod at night so my PC isn't bogged
down doing this while I am doing stuff on it.  So she could certainly
connect to her dialup, open iTunes, and go to bed....and 6-8 hours
later she'd probably have all her content.

I guess my point is - if the interest is there, then the method is
there. Granted it's slower, but it works.

Can get -what- at the library?  Can get playback of an audio file from
somebody's website at the library?  Sure, if the library's willing to
devote their own bandwidth, and allow playing back audio files -- not
always true at smaller libraries.  Or is even willing to allow a soundcard
in one of their machines in their communal computer room.  Many won't even
allow speakers (or headphones) to be attached.

Can download the file to a SDMedia card?  How many public libraries have
the technology, the willingness, or both?  Most I've encountered in upper
midwest libraries are unwilling to have anything at all shoved into their
computers, for download or upload or who cares?

Most public libraries are so frightened of viruses and keyloggers and
whatnot, they won't let you put in a floppy.  A floppy will hold a
profoundly bad quality audio file of extremely short length.

Can burn a CD?  As likely (in many cases) as permission to burn down the
library.  For a bunch of reasons.

Library-internet folk will never hear our shows.  Not in a decade or two,
anyway.

It's mostly the bandwidth.  The technology isn't billed on a monthly
basis.

I grew up in libraries.  I mean that quite literally; my Mom was a
librarian when I was a kid, and I spent much of my early childhood in the
Children's Room of our local Library.  It's a nice dream.  Not gonna
happen.

David.  According to the Leichtman Research Group, 53% of US homes now
have broadband.  Comparing that to building crystal radios is a bit
disingenuous.

Is there a technology barrier?  Yes, there's a technology barrier.  In
too much of the world, having computers or any communications
technology at all is a technology barrier.  Or the basic literacy to
operate them.

This changes over time.  I'm not sure what you want to happen in the
meantime.  If your mom doesn't want broadband, podcasting isn't
important to her.  That's not a flaw in the medium.  If you want her
to hear yours, put it on a CD.

It's elitist in the way space missions are elitist: they're accessible to
those who have the technology and can afford them. Is there an intent behind
this? No. New technologies cost more than established ones. Waiting until
they are more accessible and affordable is fallacious; they won't just show
up cheap and available. It's like saying Why hock the Queen's jewels so we
can pay for these wooden ships to go across the Atlantic when, if we just
wait, we'll have steam-driven ironclads produced by factories. The one led
to the other. The expensive and harder-to-come-by technologies are a
precursor to that grassrooted technology. For decades GM has introduced new
technology into its Cadillacs; part of what Caddy drivers are paying for is
that first-on-the-block availability. A few years later that technology
shows up across the line. As above, so below. :)

Television was considered elitist at first. Who thinks that now, or even
remembers that this was so?

I remember when this was so, and my Mom remembers when this was so.  But
you're young enough you never lived in a house with only one TV, and that
rather large, and that black and white, and much of the broadcasting
consisting of varying quality test-patterns?  Me?  Not so much.  Been
there, done that.  Didn't have T-shirts back then; had to hand paint that
stuff on Auroch hides.  By candle light.  Uphill, both ways.

I've got nothing unique to offer in this venue.  Old, I've got.

Television was something everybody wanted, and eventually a lot of folks
got it.  What, you were born after alla that &quot;eventually&quot; stuff?  God
bless you.  I watched the moon landings on black and white TV, while my
cutting-edge high-tech Dad recorded the audio on a reel-to-reel recorder.
He knew about that stuff; he'd been trained during WW II.

Yeah, it will eventually happen.  I had this crazy idea that folks doing
shows now might want their shows to be available to mass audiences -now-
and not 30 years from now.  Say, for example, some of the people in this
group, for example, who are not getting enough audience exposure -now- and
don't want to wait for their work to be sold as part of a &quot;Best of Old
Time Podcasting&quot; datacube long after they're dead from the Bird Flu
Pandemic of... well, wouldn't wanna spoil the surprise...

Do I know how to accomplish that this week?  Hell, no.  Why ask?

Mot this week.  Not as much I might wish, desperately, otherwise.  But
what -can- be done this week is start asking technosavvy people this week
what ideas they have to make that work.  And, oddly enough, we have a
group of motivated individuals who have content they want to get to the
public before they die.  And many of them have a technosavvy audience.
Hell, all of us have a technosavvy audience, to a greater or lesser
extent; they couldn't get &quot;Here&quot; if they weren't technosavvy in the first
place. Funny how that works out.

So, do we blame iTunes for the next decade or two, or do we ask the clever
folks who listen to us -- and if they can manage to listen to us, they -
are- clever folks -- how to solve that problem, and get our content out to
the masses who are waiting, breathlessly, for our content?

&quot;Sail on, oh Ship of State,
Sail on, oh Union, Strong and Great,
Humanity, with all it's Fears,
With all it's Hopes for Future Years,
Is hanging, Breathless, on Thy Fate.&quot;

Winston Churchill's response to Franklin Roosevelt, was also taken from
Longfellow:

&quot;Give us the Tools,
And we will Finish the Job!&quot;

Have broadband, or could have broadband if they could afford it?  Lots of
folks in this country (like me) have some sort of high-bandwidth access
available, but how many can afford to keep it?  Sure, I'm familiar with
the concept of the &quot;statistically significant sample,&quot; but i'm also aware
of a lot of ways you can create a sample that really isn't random, and
isn't really statistically significant.  How heavily reviewed were their
sampling methods, and were their results published in a reputable peer-
reviewed publication (I demand both).

I am part of that statistically-significant fraction of America that has
been jobless and homeless at the same time.  I am on the verge of the AARP
generation, and much of my family is part of that generation.  Hell, the
US gummint claims a substantial part of the US population is way the hell
and gone up in that age range.  So, this study presents 53 percent of
whom, exactly?

To paraphrase Gracie Allen, &quot;That's the right answer, but you asked the
wrong question.&quot;

Yes, I do love my Mom.  I'm not particularly enthusiastic for her to hear
what I'm doing.  I was kinda hoping for her to be able to hear what -
you're- doing (you have interesting shows), if she wants to.  Now, she
can't.  Can't afford the bandwidth.

Going back to the unanswered question I asked in the first place, based on
questions raised here in the past.  We keep saying the technology is too
hard, or the learning curve is too steep.  Well, the primary audience for
some of our shows (perhaps mine only; perhaps I'm the only person trying
to do a show for most people; perhaps not) is simply never going ot hear
our program because they simply can't afford the necessary bandwidth to
download the files, which are rather large.

So, given that we're already using a medium inside a delivery mechanism
that is too expensive for most people to use to get what we're doing: do
we still get to bitch about how the technology -alone- is the problem,
rhat that is too complex for people, and that's why people aren't
listening?

If we know both obstacles exist, do we get to only blame one and ignore
the other?  And can we clever folks come up with a way -- not just for my
mom, but for most of our potential not-24-34-audience -- to actually hear
what we're doing?

So, Steve, given that I like your show and think my Mom would, too, how do
we arrange reasonably so my Mom can hear your show?

How about that one detective show I listen to, &quot;Black Jack Justice,&quot; and
she's from the era where they invented the humor style in &quot;The Red Panda
Adventures,&quot; and grew up in the era when Isaac Asimov was still working in
his Dad's candy store?  Any help here?  Wanna tell me how dumb I'm being
about not burning CDs for her, like I didn't know about that?

What, you want me to burn CDs for two-thirds of the US population, or
whatever that demographic (THAT'S the word I was trying to think of!)
works out to be these days?

We keep bitchin' about iTunes is too hard, but what do we do, as at least
part of the solution, to fix the fact that with all the best solutions and
easiest technology, our audio files are just too damn big for most of our
potential audience to ever hear?

I asked a question.  Got answers?  Any science fiction help here, buddy?
Or ya wanna whine about how I should burn CDs for my Mom, and ignore a
substantial demographic?

I'm sorry I'm flying off the handle a bit -- we're talking about taking
care of my Mom here, ya feel me?

Or do you want to prove me (and I sincerely hope not) wrong, and that
podcasters really are elitists, and don't give a rat's ass that much of
their potential audience can't afford to hear them?

It's not as if a great many people haven't identified the need for a magic
podcasting bullet. What, are you cracking the whip to make them come up with
it faster?

And I watched the landing on tv, too, thank you very much. I was eating Rice
Krispie cakes. It took them for*ever* to get that damn hatch open.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's elitist in the way space missions are elitist: they're accessible to
&gt; those who have the technology and can afford them. Is there an intent
&gt; behind this? No. New technologies cost more than established ones. Waiting
&gt; until they are more accessible and affordable is fallacious; they won't
&gt; just show up cheap and available. It's like saying Why hock the Queen's
&gt; jewels so we can pay for these wooden ships to go across the Atlantic
when,
&gt; if we just wait, we'll have steam-driven ironclads produced by factories.
&gt; The one led to the other. The expensive and harder-to-come-by technologies
&gt; are a precursor to that grassrooted technology. For decades GM has
&gt; introduced new technology into its Cadillacs; part of what Caddy drivers
&gt; are paying for is that first-on-the-block availability. A few years later
&gt; that technology shows up across the line. As above, so below. :)

&gt; Television was considered elitist at first. Who thinks that now, or even
&gt; remembers that this was so?
">

I remember when this was so, and my Mom remembers when this was so. But
you're young enough you never lived in a house with only one TV, and that
rather large, and that black and white, and much of the broadcasting
consisting of varying quality test-patterns? Me? Not so much. Been
there, done that. Didn't have T-shirts back then; had to hand paint that
stuff on Auroch hides. By candle light. Uphill, both ways.

I've got nothing unique to offer in this venue. Old, I've got.

Television was something everybody wanted, and eventually a lot of folks
got it. What, you were born after alla that &quot;eventually&quot; stuff? God
bless you. I watched the moon landings on black and white TV, while my
cutting-edge high-tech Dad recorded the audio on a reel-to-reel recorder.
He knew about that stuff; he'd been trained during WW II.

Yeah, it will eventually happen. I had this crazy idea that folks doing
shows now might want their shows to be available to mass audiences -now-
and not 30 years from now. Say, for example, some of the people in this
group, for example, who are not getting enough audience exposure -now- and
don't want to wait for their work to be sold as part of a &quot;Best of Old
Time Podcasting&quot; datacube long after they're dead from the Bird Flu
Pandemic of... well, wouldn't wanna spoil the surprise...

Do I know how to accomplish that this week? Hell, no. Why ask?

Mot this week. Not as much I might wish, desperately, otherwise. But
what -can- be done this week is start asking technosavvy people this week
what ideas they have to make that work. And, oddly enough, we have a
group of motivated individuals who have content they want to get to the
public before they die. And many of them have a technosavvy audience.
Hell, all of us have a technosavvy audience, to a greater or lesser
extent; they couldn't get &quot;Here&quot; if they weren't technosavvy in the first
place. Funny how that works out.

So, do we blame iTunes for the next decade or two, or do we ask the clever
folks who listen to us -- and if they can manage to listen to us, they -
are- clever folks -- how to solve that problem, and get our content out to
the masses who are waiting, breathlessly, for our content?

&quot;Sail on, oh Ship of State,
Sail on, oh Union, Strong and Great,
Humanity, with all it's Fears,
With all it's Hopes for Future Years,
Is hanging, Breathless, on Thy Fate.&quot;

Winston Churchill's response to Franklin Roosevelt, was also taken from
Longfellow:

&quot;Give us the Tools,
And we will Finish the Job!&quot;

What, you want more poetry? Listen to my next podcast!

If you can.

I read a considered reply from Stephen and you're acting as if you're
somehow entitled to a hard answer the possession of which would almost
certainly make its innovator wealthy, which is why many people are putting
their efforts to answer it wholly apart from yer mum's needs. The whine I

&gt; David. According to the Leichtman Research Group, 53% of US homes now have
&gt; broadband. Comparing that to building crystal radios is a bit
&gt; disingenuous.
">

Have broadband, or could have broadband if they could afford it? Lots of
folks in this country (like me) have some sort of high-bandwidth access
available, but how many can afford to keep it? Sure, I'm familiar with
the concept of the &quot;statistically significant sample,&quot; but i'm also aware
of a lot of ways you can create a sample that really isn't random, and
isn't really statistically significant. How heavily reviewed were their
sampling methods, and were their results published in a reputable peer-
reviewed publication (I demand both).

I am part of that statistically-significant fraction of America that has
been jobless and homeless at the same time. I am on the verge of the AARP
generation, and much of my family is part of that generation. Hell, the
US gummint claims a substantial part of the US population is way the hell
and gone up in that age range. So, this study presents 53 percent of
whom, exactly?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Is there a technology barrier? Yes, there's a technology barrier. In too
&gt; much of the world, having computers or any communications technology at
all
&gt; is a technology barrier. Or the basic literacy to operate them.

&gt; This changes over time. I'm not sure what you want to happen in the
&gt; meantime. If your mom doesn't want broadband, podcasting isn't
&gt; important to her. That's not a flaw in the medium. If you want her
&gt; to hear yours, put it on a CD.
">

To paraphrase Gracie Allen, &quot;That's the right answer, but you asked the
wrong question.&quot;

Yes, I do love my Mom. I'm not particularly enthusiastic for her to hear
what I'm doing. I was kinda hoping for her to be able to hear what -
you're- doing (you have interesting shows), if she wants to. Now, she
can't. Can't afford the bandwidth.

Going back to the unanswered question I asked in the first place, based on
questions raised here in the past. We keep saying the technology is too
hard, or the learning curve is too steep. Well, the primary audience for
some of our shows (perhaps mine only; perhaps I'm the only person trying
to do a show for most people; perhaps not) is simply never going ot hear
our program because they simply can't afford the necessary bandwidth to
download the files, which are rather large.

So, given that we're already using a medium inside a delivery mechanism
that is too expensive for most people to use to get what we're doing: do
we still get to bitch about how the technology -alone- is the problem,
rhat that is too complex for people, and that's why people aren't
listening?

If we know both obstacles exist, do we get to only blame one and ignore
the other? And can we clever folks come up with a way -- not just for my
mom, but for most of our potential not-24-34-audience -- to actually hear
what we're doing?

So, Steve, given that I like your show and think my Mom would, too, how do
we arrange reasonably so my Mom can hear your show?

How about that one detective show I listen to, &quot;Black Jack Justice,&quot; and
she's from the era where they invented the humor style in &quot;The Red Panda
Adventures,&quot; and grew up in the era when Isaac Asimov was still working in
his Dad's candy store? Any help here? Wanna tell me how dumb I'm being
about not burning CDs for her, like I didn't know about that?

What, you want me to burn CDs for two-thirds of the US population, or
whatever that demographic (THAT'S the word I was trying to think of!)
works out to be these days?

We keep bitchin' about iTunes is too hard, but what do we do, as at least
part of the solution, to fix the fact that with all the best solutions and
easiest technology, our audio files are just too damn big for most of our
potential audience to ever hear?

I asked a question. Got answers? Any science fiction help here, buddy?
Or ya wanna whine about how I should burn CDs for my Mom, and ignore a
substantial demographic?

I'm sorry I'm flying off the handle a bit -- we're talking about taking
care of my Mom here, ya feel me?

Or do you want to prove me (and I sincerely hope not) wrong, and that
podcasters really are elitists, and don't give a rat's ass that much of
their potential audience can't afford to hear them?

David, you appear to be speaking purely from emotion here, and don't
seem willing to distance yourself from that emotion to consider the
issue rationally.

The question you raised isn't a bad one, but I for one am less and

Rice Krispie Cakes?  When I was a boy we had Rice, and damn glad to get

Although, we did have Tang.

(grin)

Yeah, not really cracking the whip about anything in particular.  Not so
much kicking anybody else's butt anymore than kicking my own.  I mean
dang.  My mom listens to audio books a lot, mostly CDs, sometimes tapes,
from the public library.  I have this wonderful mechanism for her to get
them, automagically delivered, and I know how to set it up so they are
just handed over to her periodically, one of the few real fixes I can
provide -- and I'm big on fixing things -- and I can't because there's no
damn way to get them from the source to her.  I can get them to me, I have
broadband.  To my mom, no.  She's on dailup.  And I'm well familiar with
the limitations of dialup; I spent 30 years dealing with the limitations
of dialup.

Don't nobody ever mess with my Mom, or something I wanna get for her,
unless you wanna pull back a bloody stump.

But I mean that in the nicest possible way, of course.

But cracking the whip, me?  Surely you jest?

I totally understand where you're coming from here, but look at
broadband penetration; broadband subscribers now out number dial-up
subscribers, and broadband is pretty cheap these days, often about the
same price as dial-up. For example (while they don't publicize this),
as part of the merger, AT&amp;T is required to offer $9.95/mo DSL.
Broadband is becoming very cheap, and it will only get cheaper, so
look at it this way: things are only going to get better, there will
always be a growing pool of potential listeners.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Okay, here's where this question comes from.  It's kinda related to an
&gt; earlier discussion about delivery mechanisms, and how there's a huge
&gt; learning curve to get over.  And in particular, a bandwidth curve.

&gt; My Mom asked me the other day about my MP3 player.  I waxed poetic
about
&gt; audio books (she listens to lots of books on tapes and CDs), podcasts
&gt; (she's an NPR fan), and a couple other options.

&gt; But she's older (she's my Mom, and for that matter, AARP is lusting
for -
&gt; my- next birthday), she's on a fixed income, and she has dialup.
And she
&gt; doesn't feel motivated to keep even that, much.

&gt; So there I am, trying to explain MP3 players and podcasts and their
value
&gt; to her, and after trying to show where she could get them, came to the
&gt; conclusion that she really couldn't get them in any practical fashion,
&gt; because she's on dialup.

&gt; Yeah, higher-bandwidth options are cheaper than they used to be, but
only
&gt; sometimes, and not by much.  Fixed income usually means fixed at a low
&gt; level.  So, dialup.

&gt; After trying to do what I remembered of the math, it looks like
there is
&gt; no practical way at all to listen to podcasts without a pretty damn
fast
&gt; connection of one sort or another.  Not even to the AM Monaural
Broadcast
&gt; radio level.  The files are pretty damn big, and one would have to do a
&gt; really, really short show to get within reasonable download size.

&gt; Granted, Blogs are a viable option, kinda, since it's mostly just
text on
&gt; a webpage.  Until you combine a fixed income with failing eyesight.
And
&gt; if she could read a book comfortably in the firat place, she
wouldn't need
&gt; the audio books so badly.

&gt; I won't say &quot;podcasts&quot; are elitist, because I don't think podcasts or
&gt; podcasters are intentionally elitist in what they say or in who they
&gt; intend to speak to.  Nobody I know, anyway.  Ayn Rand wouldn't have
had a
&gt; podcast.  But maybe she would -- she wrote like kind of a sociopath,
and
&gt; everyone was required to listen -- when I was in school, some of her
crap
&gt; was still required reading.

&gt; I don't know of any current podcasts that are deliberately trying to
make
&gt; their programs less accessible to older folks, starting with officially-
&gt; older-folks me in maybe a year, btw.  What I'm concerned about is
that the
&gt; accessibility problem isn't as limited as I have sometimes seen it, and
&gt; isn't limited to what sort of software and hardware you use for
access.
&gt; Decent audio quality requires a pretty damn big file for any
significant
&gt; length.  And big files take bigtime bandwidth to download in a
reasonable
&gt; time, say, less than an hour or so.

&gt; Because of the format of the content, and because of the size of the
&gt; content, we can only offer what we have to those who can afford it,
which
&gt; means people who can afford a really decent DSL connection at the very
&gt; least -- even a slower DSL connection is way too slow for any longer
show.
&gt;  So we're talking to the economic elite, since there really isn't a
middle
&gt; class, anymore.

&gt; And people on &quot;fixed incomes,&quot; which is a euphemism for &quot;low incomes&quot;
&gt; (which is why they called it &quot;fixing&quot; Social Security), use dialup
because
&gt; it's cheap.  Or use nothing at all, because that's cheaper.

&gt; So, yeah, I do a hokey little Midwestern show, and I'm trying to
make my
&gt; content appealing to folks like me.  But why bother?  I'm an exception,
&gt; I'm helping to pay for a shared decent-speed DSL connection, and that
&gt; serves well enough to download the many podcasts I listen to -- taking
&gt; several hours to download all of them, in an automated process off my
&gt; mailserver, at 3 or 4 in the morning.

&gt; Most people my age, in my area and my level of income -- most of my
real
&gt; potential audience -- can't afford to even download my show, and
probably
&gt; never will.

&gt; So if you really wanna talk about the technical limitations on the
&gt; audience of podcasting, you gotta include bandwidth, bigtime.  Not that
&gt; the technical aspects aren't profoundly daunting.  I couldn't even find
&gt; the right language to explain to my Mom what is meant by podcasting.
Not
&gt; that a lot of podcasts and similar stuff wouldn't be useful and
desirable
&gt; for her, but she won't have them, because she's on dialup.

&gt; And at her age, &quot;someday&quot; won't help.

&gt; So.  Is there a way to fix the process of distributing podcasts that
will
&gt; make them accessible to those to whom DSL is something their kids can
&gt; afford, and they can choose as compared to, say, eating?  I could
pay for
&gt; hers myself, as compared to, say eating.  Or podcasting.

&gt; Based on the bandwidth issue alone, I don't think our position as
&gt; podcasters is comparable to the Golden Age of Radio.  It's like the
days
&gt; when a few random tinkerers who could wind their own coils and track
down
&gt; a chunk of Galenium crystal.  And it's not even that good -- once you
&gt; bought a crytal, you had it.  No monthly fees.

&gt; Nobody else listened, and nobody else could listen, because at the
time,
&gt; the effort and cost was way beyond them.

&gt; So?  Answers?  Further problems?  Suggestions?  Hints?

&gt; How do we turn what we have into what Radio used to offer, before the
&gt; medium was taken over by the ...

&gt; Insert words as appropriate.  You know what I'm asking.

Oh, I think David's being pretty calm about it, myself. What I read is that
he wonders how to put podcasts in the hand of people who cannot afford the
bandwidth.

Hmmm. This seems to me like something a big podcasting promotion
organization could jump in and send out burned copies of podcasts on CD for
people who want to opt in.

Say you are a woman in the midwest on a fixed income, like for example,
David's mom. Heck, you could be a Luddite Tennessee housewife like MY mom.
This promotion company would, for a small price, or even no price at all if
you get advertising with this, take a survey from you and then, based on
your preferences, come up with several podcasts you might like. If you hear
something that you just don't like, you call up that company and raise heck
(these are older polite ladies, mind you) and they unsubscribe that podcast
for you. Once a week or so, a friendly, fresh-faced young lad of 12 or 13
will bring your CD to your door on his trusty bike while you feed him Rice
Crispie treats.

Or something like that.

">

I just spent 10 minutes writing this brilliant reply, and then
accidentally deleted it, and now I don't really feel up to replying...

Oh, hell, never mind, Welcome to the Internet.

First of all, I listen to Steve's show alla time, love it, brings back
memories of buying mass quantities of SF paperbacks at the local used book
store.  Read AFAIK all of Asimov's SF work.  So I have street cred in that
minor regard, anyway.

I recall, as I did in my original post which wasn't replied to or quoted
in this reply, agreeing with the whole argument that the Real Problem with
podcasting was how screwed up iTunes was in handling podcasts and whatnot.

Then, yesterday, I tried to explain podcasting and MP3 players and whatnot
to my Mom.  My Mom was 27 when I was born.  I'm going to be 49 at the end
of August.  You do the math.

Not only could I not show her what it was, or how it worked, I couldn't
even download an MP3 file from NPR, because the files are inherently so
damn large.  And she can't afford Broadband on her fixed income, so she
can never, practically, listen to what might be very worthwhile and
attractive and useful content for her.  Because it costs too much.

I can't afford to pay for Broadband for her.  I can't afford to pay for
broadband for me, really either.  But if I don't pay for broadband, I
dunno from Podcasts.  So a whole demographic is gone from the mix.  And my
show would be all about that demographic.  But they aren't there.  They
can't afford to be.

Maybe it's just me, but I Fix Problems.  For family, I damn well fix
problems, to the extent that they don't think it should have been a
problem in the first place.

I can't fix this, for my Mom.

Ever try to fix something for your Mom?

Ever ask friends how to fix it, and get back, basically, &quot;Well, your Mom
should spend more money, and it's not my problem, anyway?&quot;

Ever get that back from somebody you respect?

Thing is, after listening to how the Real Problem in podcasting is how
difficult iPod is, and how difficult other aggregators are, did you ever
think about the thousands of people who can't listen to podcasts because
they can't afford the bandwidth to download them?

How many disability-based podcasts aren't talking to most of their
audience because most of their audiences can't afford to listen?  Have you
ever heard of the heavily-celebrity-funded &quot;Autism Speaks?&quot;  Mostly,
Autism doesn't speak, because so few of us can afford to Speak in fact.

So, bandwidth is a serious problem, vastly more important than mere
administrative problems with iPod and such.

Well, your Mom should just have spent more money for bandwith.

Have you never had somebody you respected say something and you gotta
respond, WTF?

I'm not looking for arguments, even if I win the argument and prove what a
clever fellow I am.  That doesn't fix things for my Mom.  At her age, I
need either to fix stuff now, or &quot;this is the solution, and it happened
because of you.&quot;  What that solution might be, I dunno.  If I did, I'd
have patented it and would use the residuals to pay to my broadband
connection, and my Mom's, and wireless Internet for all of the small town
where she lives now.

Niggling little problem.  I don't have a solution.

But hey, I know this big group of guys who sit at the Fountainhead of the
greatest intellectual resouce in the history of humankind, and all I need
to do is ask, because if anybody can solve the problem, they can.

So, other than have my Mom (and other fixed-income folks) pay more money
for bandwidth, what else have we got?

It's hard to preach and not sound like you're preaching.  If it were easy,
everyone would do it.

I have tried twice now to post replies to replies to what Steve said in
the first place, usually including complements to Steve -- and I keep
hitting wrong keys and deleting my own replies.  I've been tinkering with
computers since 1976, and I keep getting overwhelmed by the complexity of
technology.  Unless the keys I hit didn't work the way I thought, and I
managed to post two responses to The Other Steve's post.  (Not The Fake
Steve, I believe that's trademarked or something.)

But I don't think that's the only problem.  Eventually, some clever person
comes up with a solution people can manage to make work.

Oddly enough, I decided to cut myself short on my original post, and
didn't even cover my take on &quot;Net Neutrality.&quot;  Ya woulda loved it.

Maybe on my blog, later.  (grin)

&gt; Oh, I think David's being pretty calm about it, myself. What I read is that

&gt; Say you are a woman in the midwest on a fixed income, like for example,

&gt; This promotion company would, for a small price, or even no price at all if

In the title to this thread, David Smith very thoughtfully posed the
essential question about podcasting Then at the end of his original post he
tried to look ahead to the future:

How do we turn what we have into what Radio used to offer, before the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; medium was taken over by the ...

&gt; Insert words as appropriate.  You know what I'm asking.
">

And then a bunch of people started beating up on him for somehow not
&quot;getting&quot; that technology changes, that broadband is not all that expensive,
really, that this is nothing like the crystal-set age of radio, etc., etc.,
etc.

But David's original question has been on my mind ever since about April
2005, ever since I got into this podcasting thing.

We are all excited about podcasting for a lot of different reasons, but one
common reason is that the &quot;little guy&quot; can now have access to a big
megaphone. (Just take a look at LibSyn's logo to understand the longevity
and resonance of this metaphor.) We can say things, produce interesting
audio, and make it available to &quot;the world.&quot;

Except &quot;the world&quot; of podcasting is not the world. It's the world of wealthy
people who have...

...computers. Never mind broadband or even dial-up Internet access. You have
to have a computer. Billions of people worldwide don't have computers. Tens
of thousands of adults in the District of Columbia don't have computers.

And then, of course, you do need an Internet connection. Broadband is pretty
close to essential (although not absolutely, since the original idea of
iPodder was that you would download shows in the background while connected,
perhaps overnight). At the very least you have to have an Internet
connection. If you've got a slow one, you really won't be partaking of our
various bursts of genius on any level.

My parents are pushing 80 years old. They are brilliant people with advanced
degrees. They own an Apple eMac. They communicate with their friends via
email.

But they get onto the Net via a dialup connection on the same phone line
through which they talk to the world.

They also live in rural North Carolina, 2 miles from the nearest neighbor.
They couldn't get DSL at their house even if they were willing to pay for
it.

So what are they supposed to do? I've been producing The Word Nerds for two
and a half years with my brother. We've cited our parents quite frequently
in the show. They've never heard a word of it, except for the handful of
shows we've burned to CD for them.

So do they not count? Am I supposed to tell them, and their highly educated
friends, that they'll just have to wait a few more years until broadband
comes to their rural route? And drops precipitously in price? But it's
really a cool technology, and broadband really isn't that expensive?

Somebody in this thread said &quot;well, you can get a fast Internet connection
at the public library.&quot; OK, fine. Does your public library let you install
iTunes on their machines, or use Podshow to organize your channels and then
sync with your MP3 player? Come on! That's no answer at all, and you know
it!

I'm still jazzed at the ability to speak through my podcast to a few
thousand people all over the world who share my interest in etymology and
linguistics. But I don't fool myself into thinking the whole world can hear
me--no matter how cool the technology is.

Yeah, David, podcasting is essentially a technologically elitist medium. No
matter what the rest of us techno-geeks on the Yahoo Podcasters Group tell
you, there's only a tiny fraction of the world's population that has any
access to what we do.

To me that's a real problem.

You know, David, I'm really tired of your attitude.

My friend Jenna is on dialup not because she can't afford it but
because her highrise is so old there isn't anywhere to put the
equipment.  (Basically the landlord wants to charge the cable company
for the rental of the eight or so units they'd have to take out of
service to make it work)

Do you know what's sitting in my backpack right now?  A compilation
DVD-rom containing dozens and dozens of creative commons podiobooks
and podcasts that I downloaded for my own enjoyment and thought she'd
enjoy.  That's one of the great things about CC, by the way, is that
it allows your content to seep out of the high bandwidth world into
the rest of the world... not fast, but it moves.  Anyways, that DVD
cost me nearly nothing, the download cost me nearly nothing, and the
postage to send it to Jenna costs me nearly nothing.

All it took was time, and a little care.

Because I've got a life. Because I have my own family with my own kids and
my own job, and it takes more time than I've got just to produce my podcast.

So, I take it, your solution to the 47% of the population who doesn't have
access to this technology is this: they should find some nice young
podcaster to burn CD's for all their favorite podcasts, and send them to
their post office boxes. Then they'd have something to look for in the
mailbox four days of the week.

Yep. That sounds just like podcatching to me.

I've got to say, I re-read the thread again after I posted that last thing,
and I'm absolutely just as pissed as David Smith at you guys for completely
missing his point.

He's supposed to burn CD's of his show for his mom; I'm supposed to burn
CD's of mine for my parents. What about the other 50,000 podcasts (including
yours) in which they might be interested? Are you going to burn those folks
a CD every week and send it to them via snail mail? What about the other 47%
of the population?

The argumentation gets more elitist by the second, I must say. You guys
don't want to spread the word. You want to sit around here and talk to each
other over and over again about whiz-bang technology.

In the meantime, the question posed in the original post is, I submit, the
essential core question in podcasting. I think it's something we all ought
to sit with for a long time and think about.

Ah, so you -have- a solution, which you thought was necessary, but I have

And I have my Mom.

Does this solve the problem of ongoing access for most of our audiences to
our output?  Well, unless you have a really rugged DVD burner, that
doesn't solve the ongoing problem.  And doesn't acknowledge the fact that
I didn't come into this with anything more than concern for how to give my
Mom something I couldn't give her, because I didn't know how.

So, I'm sorry you thought that was an attitudinal thing.  Do a quick
Google on Asperger Syndrome.  Sorry if I made you feel bad, it wasn't my
intention.

So, on a month-to-month basis, how does the rest of the bandwidth-poor
planet get access to the content we're producing?

I don't have an answer.  But hey, if I gotta be the Pinyatta for this
particular solution, keep on swingin', we may solve this one, yet.  I
don't bruise easy, I've got lots of practice.

BTW, I got one direct email so far with a partial solution.  Anyone else
wanna jump in?

I understand his point. His mom would like to listen to other podcasts and
it just isn't easy for her because she has limited bandwidth--because of
that, she can't even sample to figure out what her favorite shows would be!

David can burn her anything she wants, but it would be better if she didn't
have to rely on that. It's a real problem.

Back when I was a kid, they used to put Monkee's records on cereal boxes,
which was as non-elitist as it could be. I wonder if there could be a way
for podcasting in general to be sampled by the general non- or very
little-computer-using public in a similar sort of way?

&gt; &gt; Why only a handful?

&gt; Because I've got a life. Because I have my own family with my own kids and
&gt; my own job, and it takes more time than I've got just to produce my podcast.

Right.  Well, I guess you have to prioritize, right?  We all do.

&gt; So, I take it, your solution to the 47% of the population who doesn't have

&gt; their post office boxes. Then they'd have something to look for in the

No, that's my solution for YOUR problem.

&gt; David can burn her anything she wants, but it would be better if she didn't
&gt; have to rely on that. It's a real problem.

&gt; Back when I was a kid, they used to put Monkee's records on cereal boxes,
&gt; which was as non-elitist as it could be. I wonder if there could be a way

Thinking about this a little further, I could see some kind of call-up
service at a local newspaper or radio station (so no long distance call
because many older people don't like them as they used to be very
expensive), where you'd call a special number and listen to a few minutes of
podcasts. It would be kind of like a phone-based iTunes, if you will.

When you heard one you liked, you'd punch some codes on your phone and a CD
would be burned for you and mailed off, rather like the red envelopes
Netflix sends out. You'd pay a subscription for the service.

I would imagine that people would get all excited and order a lot at first,
but like Netflix and health clubs, they would slowly stop doing that and yet
still lazily pay for their subscriptions, so the newspaper or radio station
or what have you would make a lot of money from these people. It wouldn't
cost too much to set up.

Hmmmmm......

It was 13 Aug 2007, when Dave Shepherd commented:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In the title to this thread, David Smith very thoughtfully posed the
&gt; essential question about podcasting Then at the end of his original post he
&gt; tried to look ahead to the future:

&gt; How do we turn what we have into what Radio used to offer, before the
&gt; &gt; medium was taken over by the ...

&gt; &gt; Insert words as appropriate.  You know what I'm asking.
">

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm still jazzed at the ability to speak through my podcast to a few
&gt; thousand people all over the world who share my interest in etymology and
&gt; linguistics. But I don't fool myself into thinking the whole world can hear
&gt; me--no matter how cool the technology is.

&gt; Yeah, David, podcasting is essentially a technologically elitist medium. No
&gt; matter what the rest of us techno-geeks on the Yahoo Podcasters Group tell
&gt; you, there's only a tiny fraction of the world's population that has any
&gt; access to what we do.

&gt; To me that's a real problem.
">

On occasion, I've had to point out that somebody made me Laugh Out Loud,
literally.  Only on a handful of occasions has somebody literally brought
tears to my eyes.

I don't think it's an intentionally elitist medium.  But we forget that,
even with the $10 a month I pay for Libsyn, for example, that doesn't mean
my audience can hear me as cheaply or as easily.  Otherwise...

Yeah.  What he said.

Don't we want to be heard by everybody?  Literally, everybody, everywhere?
Wasn't that what I was asking for?

I'm sorry if asking for that offended people I respect.  That certainly
wasn't what I intended.  But, by arguing that our biggest problem is
iTunes, aren't we missing the point?  Most of our potential audience won't
ever even look at iTunes.  Most of our potential audience feel blessed to
even see a Webpage, anywhere, no matter how pathetic by our experienced
standards.

I've been tinkering with computers off and on since 1976.  And I feel a
profound sense of wonder that we can even argue about this stuff.

How can we claim to be the new Radio, when most of the world has no way
whatsoever to hear us?

A substantial percentage of my audience is in China (how many depends on
which week you look).  To speak in the current nomenclature, WTF?  Me,
some midwestern idiot with a worn-out computer and an aging Radio Shack
microphone, with an audience in a country that traditionally doesn't
listen to anybody?

I dunno.  But apparently, whatever I'm saying strikes a chord with people
I'd never conceive of trying to speak to.  And they listen, for whatever
their reasons.  WTF?

We don't want to argue, I think, about how to make it easier for the
current band (love them dearly) to keep listening, or to get more of the
same to listen.  We need to figure how the hell we go from what we have
(primitive and ragged as it is) to something where anyone, anywhere,
anytime, with minimal access to our medium (whatever that turns out to
mean) can listen if they want to.

And that'll probably mean that half whit old fellows like myself will be
kicked to the curb for something more dramatic.  But it'll also mean that
folks who (for some crazy reason) want to hear me, can.

So, yeah, I do raise the whole elitist label -- why only worry about the
convenience of those who can find -some- way to hear us, anyway -- but I
did say &quot;kinda.&quot;  I say that, because I've found historically, elitists
are all about supporting the elite as long as they -are- part of the
elite.  And we don't want to be part of the elite (though I shouldn't try
to speak for everybody).  We want to be the voice behind the microphone,
and the hand behind the track selector, sure, but we want to be heard by
absolutely everybody, even if some flip channels.

Hence, &quot;kinda.&quot;  Go figure, me getting all philosophical and whatnot.

Yeah.  What he said.

Now here I go, getting all teary-eyed and whatnot.

There are already a number of free services where people can listen to
podcasts via phone.

I'd actually forgotten about that, because I really don't think much
of it as a delivery mechanism.  I spend too much time on my cell phone
already.  &gt;8-&gt;  But if Internet bandwidth is a problem, it is one
viable solution.  No need to go the extra step and set up an

Sounds like it might be feasible.  Back in the Day, I used to own a Tandy
Color Computer, and I owned three of the four models of same they owned.

I used to get the magazine published for Color Computers, published by
Ziff-Davis Publications.  I eventually decided I just hadda have the CD-
based magazine for same.  And Ziff-Davis had their own web-based service,
under something called ZDNet.

After the Color Computer became obsolete -- they came with that silly IBM
PC thing, was of course just a passing fad -- but ZDNet stuck around,
eventually having something to do with something called CNet.  Might have
heard of them, I gather they're still around, and have some podcasting
stuff they do, too.  I believe I might actually listen to a podcast or two
they do.

But that costs money.  OTOH, we also have the more recent Linux distro,
Ubuntu, which manages to distribute their distro feed free to initial
recipients.  And there's a similar obstacle; nearly all the Linux distros
are available for free, if you can afford the Internet bandwidth necessary
to download them.

One never knows, do one?

Look upthread, Michael.  I just talked about it in detail.  To say more on it:

Selling archive CDs of content that's being given away for free is a
model that can work for very few podcasts.  It _does_ work for Escape
Pod, to some extent -- I've sold a couple hundred of those three-CD
sets.  Comparing that against our total audience size over the time
period we've been selling them, however, it's much less than one
percent.

It hasn't worked at all for the other podcasts I've tried to sell.
The characteristics that would make a listener want to pay money for
old content are not common across most podcasts.  It doesn't seem to
work for interview content, news content, or commentary.  It probably
works best for pure entertainment podcasts: ones in which, to borrow a
page from Nobilis, there's more 'experience' than 'information.'
Those are the podcasts I'm looking at next to expand the PodDisc
catalog.

I'm not trying to brag that my podcast is a unique snowflake; just
making observations from having tried this for a while.

My (possible) answer seems to have been lost in the bru-ha-ha
=================================
IT IS POSSIBLE FOR FOLKS ON DIAL-UP TO LISTEN TO PODCASTS IF THE PODCAST IS
ENCODED WITH A LOW ENOUGH BANDWITH.

They DON'T have to download the entire podcast before listening. They can
stream the podcast .. listen in 'real time'.  It's not perfect, but it is
possible.  There ARE existing podcasts that fall into this catagory, but
very few.

If you want to support dial-up listeners .. make a second feed, with reduced
bandwidth, just for them. It won't work for everyone (like music shows) but
it will work for speech.

HOW do folks on dial-up listen?  There may be other programs, but Quicktime
for one, can be configured to stream (play on delivery) a mp3 file.

My answer was also lost in the noise:

Download podcasts on the overnight.  As long as you are not subscribed
to too many - you should easily be able to get them all in a 6-8 hour
sleep cycle.  56K dial up downloads about 3 MB a minute.  That's 1080
minutes of podcasts in a 6 hour sleep cycle.  Even if you half that
accounting for poorer performance or less time spent online, that's
still 500 minutes downloaded a night.  Enough to get even 5-7 podcasts
a day.

Dial up is not crippling to podcasts if you do batch downloading once
a day on the overnight.

Many people do it. The primary writer for our podcast only has a dial-up
connection. He listens to podcasts all of the time. Sure, it is slower than
broadband, but it works.

And believe it or not, there are still parts of this country where people
can¹t get broadband.

I know that Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte do a 16 kps version of their
podcast Security Now for people with low bandwidth.

Well, as one with depression-era parents who will never consider spending more
than $6 per month for Internet access, I can speak to this to some degree.  My
mother does listen to my One Minute How-To show via dial-up because it is
encoded at 96k, which is just barely low enough to fit in the pipe on a good
day.  She listens through the Flash player on my site and I've shown her that
if the download is not keeping up then she can hit the pause button while the
show buffers.

My father enjoys words, so I collect episodes of Podicitionary and burn them to
CD for him (and I've always offered to send my shows on CD to anyone
interested).  So it's really a matter of whether or not you want to go the
extra mile to help someone listen to your show.

And as far as AARP is concerned, I joined about two weeks ago so that I could
get the motel discounts during my vacation last week. &lt;g&gt;

Cheers -

David and everybody else,

Time-brokered radio! This turns the &quot;bandwidth problem&quot; into a money
problem, and money is always an easier problem to solve than technology. I
know it's a regressive technology, but it's relatively cheap and very easy
to syndicate to. If anyone is serious about getting podcasts to the masses,
you need to roll into the entry level of terrestrial radio, figure out how
to pony up some cash, and get the advertising out to tune people in.

For all the time that I've been on this group, nobody has once EVER
mentioned publicly accessible broadcasting options in TV or radio to get
your message out (let alone out of the box online solutions like converting
audio podcasts for youtube). If we are hankering for a wider audience and
better awareness of podcasting as a genre, why are we not clambering for a
chance to leverage public-access and time-brokered radio and tv?

If you want people to hear your message, go to them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;   Okay, here's where this question comes from. It's kinda related to an
&gt; earlier discussion about delivery mechanisms, and how there's a huge
&gt; learning curve to get over. And in particular, a bandwidth curve.

&gt; My Mom asked me the other day about my MP3 player. I waxed poetic about
&gt; audio books (she listens to lots of books on tapes and CDs), podcasts
&gt; (she's an NPR fan), and a couple other options.

&gt; But she's older (she's my Mom, and for that matter, AARP is lusting for -
&gt; my- next birthday), she's on a fixed income, and she has dialup. And she
&gt; doesn't feel motivated to keep even that, much.

&gt; So there I am, trying to explain MP3 players and podcasts and their value
&gt; to her, and after trying to show where she could get them, came to the
&gt; conclusion that she really couldn't get them in any practical fashion,
&gt; because she's on dialup.

&gt; Yeah, higher-bandwidth options are cheaper than they used to be, but only
&gt; sometimes, and not by much. Fixed income usually means fixed at a low
&gt; level. So, dialup.

&gt; After trying to do what I remembered of the math, it looks like there is
&gt; no practical way at all to listen to podcasts without a pretty damn fast
&gt; connection of one sort or another. Not even to the AM Monaural Broadcast
&gt; radio level. The files are pretty damn big, and one would have to do a
&gt; really, really short show to get within reasonable download size.

&gt; Granted, Blogs are a viable option, kinda, since it's mostly just text on
&gt; a webpage. Until you combine a fixed income with failing eyesight. And
&gt; if she could read a book comfortably in the firat place, she wouldn't need

&gt; the audio books so badly.

&gt; I won't say &quot;podcasts&quot; are elitist, because I don't think podcasts or
&gt; podcasters are intentionally elitist in what they say or in who they
&gt; intend to speak to. Nobody I know, anyway. Ayn Rand wouldn't have had a
&gt; podcast. But maybe she would -- she wrote like kind of a sociopath, and
&gt; everyone was required to listen -- when I was in school, some of her crap
&gt; was still required reading.

&gt; I don't know of any current podcasts that are deliberately trying to make
&gt; their programs less accessible to older folks, starting with officially-
&gt; older-folks me in maybe a year, btw. What I'm concerned about is that the
&gt; accessibility problem isn't as limited as I have sometimes seen it, and
&gt; isn't limited to what sort of software and hardware you use for access.
&gt; Decent audio quality requires a pretty damn big file for any significant
&gt; length. And big files take bigtime bandwidth to download in a reasonable
&gt; time, say, less than an hour or so.

&gt; Because of the format of the content, and because of the size of the
&gt; content, we can only offer what we have to those who can afford it, which
&gt; means people who can afford a really decent DSL connection at the very
&gt; least -- even a slower DSL connection is way too slow for any longer show.

&gt; So we're talking to the economic elite, since there really isn't a middle
&gt; class, anymore.

&gt; And people on &quot;fixed incomes,&quot; which is a euphemism for &quot;low incomes&quot;
&gt; (which is why they called it &quot;fixing&quot; Social Security), use dialup because

&gt; it's cheap. Or use nothing at all, because that's cheaper.

&gt; So, yeah, I do a hokey little Midwestern show, and I'm trying to make my
&gt; content appealing to folks like me. But why bother? I'm an exception,
&gt; I'm helping to pay for a shared decent-speed DSL connection, and that
&gt; serves well enough to download the many podcasts I listen to -- taking
&gt; several hours to download all of them, in an automated process off my
&gt; mailserver, at 3 or 4 in the morning.

&gt; Most people my age, in my area and my level of income -- most of my real
&gt; potential audience -- can't afford to even download my show, and probably
&gt; never will.

&gt; So if you really wanna talk about the technical limitations on the
&gt; audience of podcasting, you gotta include bandwidth, bigtime. Not that
&gt; the technical aspects aren't profoundly daunting. I couldn't even find
&gt; the right language to explain to my Mom what is meant by podcasting. Not
&gt; that a lot of podcasts and similar stuff wouldn't be useful and desirable
&gt; for her, but she won't have them, because she's on dialup.

&gt; And at her age, &quot;someday&quot; won't help.

&gt; So. Is there a way to fix the process of distributing podcasts that will
&gt; make them accessible to those to whom DSL is something their kids can
&gt; afford, and they can choose as compared to, say, eating? I could pay for
&gt; hers myself, as compared to, say eating. Or podcasting.

&gt; Based on the bandwidth issue alone, I don't think our position as
&gt; podcasters is comparable to the Golden Age of Radio. It's like the days
&gt; when a few random tinkerers who could wind their own coils and track down
&gt; a chunk of Galenium crystal. And it's not even that good -- once you
&gt; bought a crytal, you had it. No monthly fees.

&gt; Nobody else listened, and nobody else could listen, because at the time,
&gt; the effort and cost was way beyond them.

&gt; So? Answers? Further problems? Suggestions? Hints?

&gt; How do we turn what we have into what Radio used to offer, before the
&gt; medium was taken over by the ...

&gt; Insert words as appropriate. You know what I'm asking.

There was actually a thread that addressed reaching the masses. It ended up
with some of us offering some decent sized money towards radio advertising,
as long as others donated and participated.

Nobody chimed in about it.

I've learned that most podcasters are willing to band together when it is a
good cause, but when it comes to promoting podcasting, a lot of us are not
willing to do what it takes to get to a mass audience. And I know that a
niche is fine for many of us, but with the level of complaints we hear about
audience and such, you would think that more people would jump at an
opportunity to get more people to listen.

Of course, the logistics of it all are a bit daunting without anyone willing
to do some work.

What would the advertisement say?
What markets would it be in?
Who will it advertise?
How much will it cost?
Will it point to a certain website?
Who will make that website?
Etc., etc., etc.

Being that a lot of us are independent podcasters, we are used to doing
things on our own. So getting a collective going can be a task in itself. I
was part of the Podcast Guild, which was supposed to be an organization to
promote podcasting, and represent podcasters. The problem with it, was
getting podcasters organized and agreeing to what should be done with it. I
also helped start the Podcasters Wiki. An open source place to put info for
all podcasters. Maybe about 5 to 10 people helped out. You would think that
with a group of over 2000 people here, we could get maybe 40 or 50 to get
something serious going.

It will take a large band of podcasters to get anything real done, and I
dare say some strong leaders to get it accomplished. Until that happens,
podcasting will elude those on the other side of the digital divide.

Is podcasting elitist? No. It is available to anyone who is willing to find
it. Either on purpose, or by accident. Unfortunately for us, that is the way
it is going to be until podcasters become a unified group.

I disagree. A community action is always going to resemble herding kittens
sooner or later. I strongly suspect that it's going to take an entrepreneur
who's figured out how to make money by syndicating podcast programming to
the masses for anything to really roll. Community is great, but money is
what gets things done.

You didn't notice Richarm Amirault talking about his public access
cable show *yesterday*?  There was quite a lot of discusison back and
forth about it!  Nor the &quot;Feed Me Bubbe&quot; folks talking just the other
day about being featured on ABC TV?  That thread is still ongoing.

And I take it you haven't ever read a message here from Jesse Thorn,
whose primary podcast is also a syndicated public radio show.  And you
didn't know that the Dragon Page family of podcatss started on the
radio.  A lot of podcasters I know of have been on the radio, a few
have been on TV (including me -- I was briefly interviewed at least
year's Balticon by some producers doing a public television show about
science fiction), and there are miscellaneous podcasters featured in
the print and television news all the time.  And then there's KYOU,
and all the talk about the public radio talent quest, and Brian's
Dragon*Con TV...

This isn't new.  This stuff gets talked about.  If you haven't &quot;once
EVER&quot; heard it mentioned, we must be reading different lists.

And let us hope that this future entremanure understands podcasting and
podcasters, and is not doing it for personal gain. Not that there is
anything wrong with that. But we have already seen what happens when an
'outsider' comes in and says they are going to promote podcasting. And
although iTunes did help promote podcasting, the results are mixed.

I agree that money is needed, but I would much prefer that money come from
the community, where the only interest is podcasting. Otherwise, in order to
for that entremanure to do this, he/she would first need a business model.
And seeing as there is no immediate money involved in podcasting.....

I am hatching my diabolical plan as we speak. I will get rich off of
promoting someone else, and they will pay me nothing. Brilliant!!

1. Make plan
2. Advertise podcasts
3. ????
4. Profit
