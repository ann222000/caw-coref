What are the advantages of blow-off fermentation other than no blocked
air locks? Also Do you leave the Beer in the carboy for a clearing
period or just for primary fementation (do you rack at all)?

I don't see any other advantages to the blow off.

My first few batches were primary only, and moving to secondary made a
HUGE difference in clarity and taste. It forces you to wait a little
longer before you start drinking, which only helps the beer age a little.

I started brewing 10 gallon batches for this reason since by the time
the beer was really getting good, it was gone.

The blow off carries a lot of crap out with it, bitter by products of the
boil.  I use a 6gal carboy for the primary and a 5 gal for the secondary.
The secondary seems to provide clearer beer, better tasting beer by getting
the beer off the yeast cake, and in my case, frees up my primary for the
next batch.

The only advantage to using a blow-off hose is that it makes less of
a mess when the carboy overflows and avoids the potential for a blocked
airlock (although I've never had that happen).  I wouldn't intentionally
try to make a fermentation blow-off for some reason.

Personally, I rack to a secondary fermenter for clearing.  However, you
can do that in the primary as well if you want to.  Secondaries are
optional.

A blow off hose is good to prevent messes during primary fermentations.
I've had 6 gal carboys spew all over the place with airlocks before.
Unless I'm using my 6.5 gal carboy for primary I use the blow off.

You can also use a blow off system to capture yeast for culturing.
Never actually did this but recently read about it.

You can leave the beer in the primary for a couple of weeks with no
real problems. If you leave it in for too long a period you run the
risk of getting off flavors from the dying yeast and other by-products
from the fermentation process. It really depends on the beer as whether
or not you need to rack to a secondary. Racking increases the risk of
contamination and oxidation leading to off flavors.

There certainly is advantages to racking. It aids in clearing. Yeast
and other proteins get a chance to fall out of solution, it frees up
your primary, and it can be a place to age the beer before bottling or
kegging.

Lagers need to condition for a long time and it should be done in a
secondary otherwise off flavors will develop. There is plenty of
reading online about the advantages and disadvantages of racking ales
and types to rack.

I'm not sure that works so well anymore.  It used to be that lager
yeasts were "bottom fermenters" and ale yeasts where "top fermenters".
However, that's not really the case anymore.  There are very few true
top fermenting yeast.  Because of that, I'm not sure how much live yeast
you'd really get from a blow off.  Maybe some, but probably not as much
as you might think.  IMO, there are probably better ways of getting
yeast samples from your fermenter for culturing.

A lot of older books say this, but IMO it's definitely a case of over
paranoia.  I, and several other brewers on here, have stored beer in the
primary for much longer than the older books warn about.  In most cases,
I believe it will take at least several months for autolysis to occur,
not the couple weeks that is often stated.

If you really have any significant risk of contamination or oxidation
when you rack, then you're doing something wrong.

You have to admit that racking _does_ increase the risk of contamination
and oxidation since there is no risk of contamination and oxidation if
you don't rack.  As someone who is very good at doing things wrong, it's
something to consider.  Plus there's the time and effort involved -- I
prefer keeping things simple.

But I think that the improvement in the beer by introducing the "extra
step" is worth the time and risk.  My observation is that there is an
observable improvement in clarity and taste.  This appears to agree with
the consensus of people posting here.

Absolutely. I sometimes rack my beers to a tertiary fermenter just for
that reason (clarity and cleaner taste). Anything I dry-hop goes to
tertiary to clear afterward.

If you can't learn to rack your beer without oxidizing or infecting it,

If you read this newsgroup long enough, you'll find that only a
few yeasts, in the experience of those who post here, still
follow definite "top" or "bottom" fermentation patterns.  As one
datapoint, in my (limited) experience with ale yeast, it remains
in suspension or settles directly to the bottom during
fermentation.  I've never noticed any real yeast density building
in the top strata of the fermenter.

What is reference.com's source?

This isn't a book.  There are dozens of regulars who post here,
with probably thousands of homebrew batches in their collective
experience.  Several recent posts have noted very long
fermentations without incurring autolysis.  OTOH, I've been
reading here for 3-4 years, and don't recall anyone ever
mentioning an actual case of autolysis.

What I should have said here, is that the majority of yeasts,
