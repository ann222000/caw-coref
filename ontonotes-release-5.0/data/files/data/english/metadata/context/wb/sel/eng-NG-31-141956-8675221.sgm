Hey all, school is back in, and I have myself my very own laptop! (Dell
Inspiron 1501, 1 GB Ram, 80 GB HDD, used to have Vista, but that locked
up completly 45 mins into first boot, so it's now PCLinuxOS 2007 Final,
DualCore 1.7 GHz 64 bit processor) :)

&lt;Smiles, until someone walks up to him, like in older Dell commercials,
and then yells at him 'DOOOOD!!!!  YOU&quot;RE GETTIN A _DELL_!!!!!!!1!!1!11one&gt;
&lt;Becomes really frightened&gt;
&lt;Recovers his composure&gt;

A few things I want to get off my chest.  Things I've been wanting to
talk about all summer, but haven't had a fast enough connection to be
able to keep track of stuff, as I will most definately need to clear
things up along the way.

I noticed the posts about Lucid Dreaming.  I do that all the time, for
some reason.  I used to have nightmares all the time, so I somehow was
able to train myself to be able to control what happens in my dreams.  I
am, in effect, concious within the subconcious, and I can pull out
memories from dreams as if they were real memories.  The thing is, is
that it has evolved from the whole &quot;Controlling everything that goes
wrong&quot; to &quot;I Can't Believe It's Not Reality!&quot;.  In other words, my
dreams have the same types of rules as reality does.  Now, there are
major differences, like I know when I'm dreaming (which, btw, I do all
night), but my dreams happen in what seems to be real time.
For example, I was dreaming I was taking this tour at this research
facility, where my trueform is.  In the middle of it, I was woken up by
Nature, and when I went back to sleep, the rest of the group had moved
on, and I was lost.  You wouldn't believe what I found there.  Later in
that dream series (occurs about 3-4 times a week), I was able to land a
job there.  Yays. :D  I've always had this dream thing, as far as I can
remember.  Now, here's something that LFS would be interested in.

A while back, I was reading old archives, and got a description of
LFS's Trueform.  It was in the middle of the day, when all of a sudden,
a memory of a dream from about 8-9 years earlier popped into my mind.
This large, dragonlike body, on this lab table, with all kinds of
creatures running around, running tests, acting panicked.  It looked to
be completely black, and they were able to revive it for a moment, and
when they did, the wings fluttered, the legs began to move, and vivid
red markings appeared!  Of course, everyone was cheering at this point,
until the markings started to fade.  But there were lots of machines
with readouts and such.  Oh, too long ago, for my memory.  Now, this
place is the same place where I've apparently gotten the job at.  So,
with that in mind, next time I was there, I told them my theory, that
both LFS and myself are trapped on Earth.

Wow, this is getting to be a long post, eh?

Anyways, another little thing about my dreams:
They are too realistic.  For example, I broke my arm in my dream, and
/until it healed in the dream/ I could not move my arm without
excruciating pain for about 10 mins after I fully awoke.  I have no wish
to repeat that again.

Well, I think I'm gonna wrap this post up, as it is getting long, and I
need some sleep.  I'm writing it whilst offline, at 5 before 2 in the
Morning.

Woot; the grapes are sour!

I suffer from great envy in such matters.  Can you tell?  :-P  (I don't
actually go green AFAIK but I do suffer from stomach-churning, which is
compounded by the presence of dragons.)

More useful: have you ever tried hypnotism?  That last part hints that your
suggestibility level could be very high.

I work in a tech department and none of us can set it up to work.  Most of the
faculty here need a VPN client to work remotely and Cisco does not currently
offer a VPC client for Vista.

As well as several other problems.  The college officially doesn't support
Vista yet (I don't think IRT will even help people with it beyond &quot;reformat
and install XP&quot; which oddly, happens to be their solution to many many
problems).  We probably won't support it (beyond &quot;we'll poke at it but no
garuntees&quot;) until Service Pack 1.  There are still too many companies that
don't have drivers or don't have GOOD drivers yet.

I gave Vista a fair chance.  It booted up, asked me to agree to both
MS's and Dell's EULA, and then entered my new login info.  It then went
to this &quot;Checking the performance of your computer&quot; thing, took a half
hour to do, then when it was trying to display those results, it locked
up completely.  Blech.

Haven't bothered with it since, and I'm quite happy.  Very snappy PC, I
find, and I love my CPU monitor that shows the load on each CPU :)

Depends on if it's a Home model or a Business model.  The business ones hold
up pretty good.

Depends on the hardware configuration, the temperature, the relative
humidity, the day of the week, etc, etc.....  So, pretty standard for a

I've got one of those on my keyboard (Logitech G15 Gaming Keyboard).  I
usually keep it on my POP reference screen, though, to let me know when
my other e-mail address has any mail.

Nothing wrong with mine, I frankensteined it from the parts of three
dead ones in the junk box at the comp shop.

And the three dead ones looked to have gotten dead from abuse and
mishandling, not because they were crap.

That doesn't count as a Dell to me.

When I say &quot;Dells are crap&quot;, I'm talking about ones that were builty *by*
Dell, and have had no major modifications since.  Even a reformat/reinstall
of the HDD will make a &quot;stock&quot; Dell less crappy.
