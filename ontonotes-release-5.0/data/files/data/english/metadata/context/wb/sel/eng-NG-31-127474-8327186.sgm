LL: What makes you think god is not a sadist? If we accept the current
theory of god and eternal damnation, he is a sadist, and if you
believe in it anyway, you're a masochist.

This is from DSM-III-R

Sadistic personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of cruel,
demeaning, and aggressive behavior, beginning by early adulthood, as
indicated by the repeated occurrence of at least four of the
following:

*Has used physical cruelty or violence for the purpose of establishing
dominance in a relationship (not merely to achieve some
noninterpersonal goal, such as striking someone in order to rob him or
her)
*Humiliates or demeans people in the presence of others
*Has treated or disciplined someone under his or her control unusually
harshly.
*Is amused by, or takes pleasure in, the psychological or physical
suffering of others (including animals)
*Has lied for the purpose of harming or inflicting pain on others (not
merely to achieve some other goal)
*Gets other people to do what he or she wants by frightening them
(through intimidation or even terror)
*Restricts the autonomy of people with whom he or she has a close
relationship, e.g., will not let spouse leave the house unaccompanied
or permit teenage daughter to attend social functions
*Is fascinated by violence, weapons, injury, or torture

LL: Sound familiar? An argument could be made that the christian god
fits all of those criteria--and certainly four.

And here's the DSM-III's definition of Masochism or as they prefer to
describe it, &quot;self-defeating personality disorder&quot;:

Masochistic (Self-defeating) Personality Disorder
(The Loyalist)

Self-defeating Personality Disorder is a pervasive pattern of self-
defeating behavior, beginning by early adulthood and present in a
variety of contexts. The person may often avoid or undermine
pleasurable experiences, be drawn to situations or relationships in
which he or she will suffer, and prevent others from helping him or
her, as indicated by at least five of the following:

*chooses people and situations that lead to disappointment, failure,
or mistreatment even when better options are clearly available;

*rejects or renders ineffective the attempts of others to help him of
her;

*following positive personal events (e.g., new achievement), responds
with depression, guilt, or a behavior that produces pain ( e.g., an
accident);

*incites angry or rejecting responses from others and then feels hurt,
defeated, or humiliated (e.g., makes fun of spouse in public,
provoking an angry retort, then feels devastated);

*rejects opportunities for pleasure, or is reluctant to acknowledge
enjoying himself or herself (despite having adequate social skills and
the capacity for pleasure);

*fails to accomplish tasks crucial to his or her personal objectives
despite demonstrated ability to do so, (e.g., helps fellow students
write papers , but is unable to write his or her own);

*is uninterested in or rejects people who consistently treat him or
her well, (e.g., is not attracted to caring sexual partners);

*engages in excessive self-sacrifice that is unsolicited by the
intended recipients of the sacrifice;

Really?  This is the same diety that holds every innocent newborn
complicite in a transgression that two other people committed - yet no
newborn has the capacity to morally evaluate their own ethical
position, much less anyone elses.  The same diety that allegedly
slaughtered the first born of egypt because of the actions others
committed (Hmmmm...seems to be a theme here), and lets not forget that
after He got pissed off at the whole world he wiped out damn near
every living thing of the planet because He was getting the proper
respect.  takr about an attitude problem.   Curious behavior from a
supposedly omniscient Creator who should have known how his own
creations were going to turn out.  Oh, yeah...the old Free Will
canard.  Sorry but an omniscient being precludes free will.

Cheers,

Steve

One has to question the nature of the relationship between the
Loyalist type who avoids pleasure and seeks situations and
relationships in which he or she will suffer at the hands of others,
and the rest of society, healthy or otherwise, who, presumably, in the
world of the Loyalist, actually fulfill his/her wishes to be
dominated, humilliated, hurt etc., given that they all fit the pattern
that drives him/her towards those people most likely to exploit him/
her. Presumably, also, this individual would prefer the company of
Satan as a lover, protector, guardian etc. rather than a benign,
loving God as creator and friend.

Sadomasochism is demonstraby a product not of Christianity but of any
desire to manipulate and to control which is psychologically endorsed
by the second person, i.e. me. If you actualy think about the Ten
Commandments, for example, you will find that they are far from being
sadomasochistic; and we haven't even mentioned the New Testament yet.

To say that God must be a sadist and all his followers masochists,
Loyalists, slaves, is false. It is not God who persecutes.

This entire thread is a rather pathetic and pompous attempt to make
fun of something true, written by idiots with nothing better to do
than to try to be clever while avoiding the obvious by not thiking
about it. I have never read Marquis de Sade, but it sounds like a
stupid book to me!

WelshWolly!

Hi!

I don't believe I have had the pleasure of addressing you prior to
this.
It is unfortunate that our first encounter is, on my part, by way of
critique.
The Marquis de Sade was an aristocrat and Colonel von Masoc was
a military man, his dispositional opposite. People not a book!

The benign, loving god of which to speak, as far as anyone on this
planet is aware, has never been known to exist. Therefore is would
seem more than a little presumptous to assume that it was
sadomasocistic of nature. There is no doubt but that the persons
responsible for producing the pagonistic literature that introduces
this imagary and calling it god, were of doubtful tendencies as the
buy bull clearly demonstrates.

It is to be regretted that religion has so einveigledthe populous at
large, that vast numbers now believe this rubbish.

Lawrey,

Thank you for pointing out my ignorance.
It's interesting that you cite the Bible as a source of exposure of
the dubious tendencies of sadomasochists - surely you don't need to
refer to any religious text in this context. Must we become enmired in
the superficial citation of the names of books and people in order to
reach truth?

Yes, it may be true according to some that the populous at large can
become enveigled by certain ideas pertaining or not to religion, but
that itself is such an idea - has it enveigled you?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; variety of contexts. The person may often avoid or undermine
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pleasurable experiences, be drawn to situations or relationships in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which he or she will suffer, and prevent others from helping him or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her, as indicated by at least five of the following:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *chooses people and situations that lead to disappointment, failure,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *rejects or renders ineffective the attempts of others to help him of

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *incites angry or rejecting responses from others and then feels hurt,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defeated, or humiliated (e.g., makes fun of spouse in public,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; provoking an angry retort, then feels devastated);

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *rejects opportunities for pleasure, or is reluctant to acknowledge

Misunderstanding 1 - Original sin
-------------------------------
&quot; This is the same diety that holds every innocent newborn  complicite
in a transgression that two other people committed - yet no  newborn
has the capacity to morally evaluate their own ethical  position, much
less anyone elses.&quot;

Steve can be excused in this because most christians are confused by
the concept of 'Original Sin'. We have no idea what the diety holds
about innocent newborns . What we know is the position various
churches adopts about this. The catholic church believes that on death
unbaptised babies have to spend time in the purgatory before reaching
heaven.....I dont buy that.

'Original Sin' is mentioned in Genesis ( book 1 of the bible) to
emphasise the glaringly obvious fact that left to his own means man
( without exception) succumbs to sin. It's a part of our
nature ...like every thing else that is part of our nature ,we inherit
it from our parents........original sin is not about babies being
punished for the parent's sin......

Misunderstanding 2  - Tenth plague
------------------------------
&quot;The same diety that allegedly  slaughtered the first born of egypt
because of the actions others committed (Hmmmm...seems to be a theme
here), &quot;

Nothing comes close to an atheist's paranoia about death..you just
have to read couple of their posts to realise that.......Death of a
loved one -ur first born is more of a punishment to you than to the
first born.....According to Christianity, physical death is not always
a punishment for  sins....the real punishment is later....the first
borns will be judged based on their life on earth. Nothing changes
that.

The punishment is for the pharoah who CHOSE to let the first borns of
egypt die rather than free the people who have been slaved for 480
years......

Misunderstanding 3 - The great flood
----------------------------
&quot;and lets not forget that after He got pissed off at the whole world
he wiped out damn near every living thing of the planet because He was
getting the proper respect.  takr about an attitude problem.  &quot;

Again the atheist's paranoia about death

The real question is what right does a creator have over the
created........when I eat a meat burger, I am contributing to the
mutilation/death of atleast one animal and atleast three
plants......will this fact stop an atheist from eating meat
burgers.....or  anything else except corpses ! An atheist who does not
care about the life of the creatures ( plant/ animal) that makes up
his food has no right to question the creator punishing his
creatures.

As one of the creatures I can question the creator punishing me for
not regarding him......But to the creator, the action of the creature
is offensive, intolerable enough to take back what was given to the
creature......life.

Misunderstanding 4
------------------------------
Curious behavior from a supposedly omniscient Creator who should have
known how his own creations were going to turn out.  Oh, yeah...the
old Free Will canard.  Sorry but an omniscient being precludes free
will. &quot;

Oh the omniscient Creator knows very well how his own creations are
going to turn out.......The surprise is that he permits
them to exist and disobey him.............the old Free Will canard is
why we are not animals- why it is you and not the chimp in the zoo who
posted those messages....

Omniscience does not preclude anything. Omniscience is the knowledge
of your actions........your actions are governed by what you are and
what drives you. Notice that christians strongly believe in omniscence
but never blame that for their failures.

Cheers,

Leslie

WelshWolly,

I was not inferring ignorance in any derogatory way.

In order to reach the truth as you put it, one must look to the
origins of religion, Christianity, Philosophy, and Theology.
The history of philosophy tells a sorry tale it's true, but it does
enlighten us as to the truth of the beginnings of gods and
religious thinking, with all its cruel and bloodthirsty fanaticism.
If one goes back to the very first recorded history of philosophy,
one clearly sees from whence gods were derived and why,
and how religions took upon themselves the promotion of gods,
and used them to good effect for their own purposes, which
were by no means honourable.
I am not enveigled by any supersticious mysticism. I am
interested in truth.

Your talk of gods tells me you are not aligned with truth,
but are caught in the web of lies and deceits of religious
fantasy and scriptural farce.

It is to be deplored.

&gt; Thank you for pointing out my ignorance.
&gt; It's interesting that you cite the Bible as a source of exposure of

&gt; the superficial citation of the names of books and people in order to

&gt; Yes, it may be true according to some that the populous at large can

&gt; &gt; Hi!

&gt; &gt; I don't believe I have had the pleasure of addressing you prior to
&gt; &gt; this.
&gt; &gt; It is unfortunate that our first encounter is, on my part, by way of
&gt; &gt; critique.
&gt; &gt; The Marquis de Sade was an aristocrat and Colonel von Masoc was
&gt; &gt; a military man, his dispositional opposite. People not a book!

&gt; &gt; The benign, loving god of which to speak, as far as anyone on this
&gt; &gt; planet is aware, has never been known to exist. Therefore is would
&gt; &gt; seem more than a little presumptous to assume that it was
&gt; &gt; sadomasocistic of nature. There is no doubt but that the persons
&gt; &gt; responsible for producing the pagonistic literature that introduces
&gt; &gt; this imagary and calling it god, were of doubtful tendencies as the
&gt; &gt; buy bull clearly demonstrates.

&gt; &gt; It is to be regretted that religion has so einveigledthe populous at
&gt; &gt; large, that vast numbers now believe this rubbish.

&gt; &gt; &gt; One has to question the nature of the relationship between the

&gt; &gt; &gt; and the rest of society, healthy or otherwise, who, presumably, in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; world of the Loyalist, actually fulfill his/her wishes to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; dominated, humilliated, hurt etc., given that they all fit the pattern
&gt; &gt; &gt; that drives him/her towards those people most likely to exploit him/

&gt; &gt; &gt; Satan as a lover, protector, guardian etc. rather than a benign,
&gt; &gt; &gt; loving God as creator and friend.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sadomasochism is demonstraby a product not of Christianity but of any
&gt; &gt; &gt; desire to manipulate and to control which is psychologically endorsed
&gt; &gt; &gt; by the second person, i.e. me. If you actualy think about the Ten
&gt; &gt; &gt; Commandments, for example, you will find that they are far from being
&gt; &gt; &gt; sadomasochistic; and we haven't even mentioned the New Testament yet.

&gt; &gt; &gt; To say that God must be a sadist and all his followers masochists,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Loyalists, slaves, is false. It is not God who persecutes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This entire thread is a rather pathetic and pompous attempt to make
&gt; &gt; &gt; fun of something true, written by idiots with nothing better to do
&gt; &gt; &gt; than to try to be clever while avoiding the obvious by not thiking

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi!

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't believe I have had the pleasure of addressing you prior to
&gt; &gt; &gt; this.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is unfortunate that our first encounter is, on my part, by way of
&gt; &gt; &gt; critique.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The Marquis de Sade was an aristocrat and Colonel von Masoc was
&gt; &gt; &gt; a military man, his dispositional opposite. People not a book!

&gt; &gt; &gt; The benign, loving god of which to speak, as far as anyone on this
&gt; &gt; &gt; planet is aware, has never been known to exist. Therefore is would
&gt; &gt; &gt; seem more than a little presumptous to assume that it was
&gt; &gt; &gt; sadomasocistic of nature. There is no doubt but that the persons
&gt; &gt; &gt; responsible for producing the pagonistic literature that introduces
&gt; &gt; &gt; this imagary and calling it god, were of doubtful tendencies as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; buy bull clearly demonstrates.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is to be regretted that religion has so einveigledthe populous at
&gt; &gt; &gt; large, that vast numbers now believe this rubbish.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the rest of society, healthy or otherwise, who, presumably, in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world of the Loyalist, actually fulfill his/her wishes to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dominated, humilliated, hurt etc., given that they all fit the pattern
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that drives him/her towards those people most likely to exploit him/

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Satan as a lover, protector, guardian etc. rather than a benign,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loving God as creator and friend.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadomasochism is demonstraby a product not of Christianity but of any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire to manipulate and to control which is psychologically endorsed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by the second person, i.e. me. If you actualy think about the Ten
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Commandments, for example, you will find that they are far from being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadomasochistic; and we haven't even mentioned the New Testament yet.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To say that God must be a sadist and all his followers masochists,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Loyalists, slaves, is false. It is not God who persecutes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This entire thread is a rather pathetic and pompous attempt to make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fun of something true, written by idiots with nothing better to do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than to try to be clever while avoiding the obvious by not thiking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about it. I have never read Marquis de Sade, but it sounds like a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stupid book to me!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is from DSM-III-R

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadistic personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of cruel,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; demeaning, and aggressive behavior, beginning by early adulthood, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indicated by the repeated occurrence of at least four of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; following:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Has used physical cruelty or violence for the purpose of establishing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dominance in a relationship (not merely to achieve some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noninterpersonal goal, such as striking someone in order to rob him or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Humiliates or demeans people in the presence of others
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Has treated or disciplined someone under his or her control unusually
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harshly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Is amused by, or takes pleasure in, the psychological or physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suffering of others (including animals)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Has lied for the purpose of harming or inflicting pain on others (not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; merely to achieve some other goal)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Gets other people to do what he or she wants by frightening them
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (through intimidation or even terror)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Restricts the autonomy of people with whom he or she has a close
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relationship, e.g., will not let spouse leave the house unaccompanied
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or permit teenage daughter to attend social functions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Is fascinated by violence, weapons, injury, or torture

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LL: Sound familiar? An argument could be made that the christian god
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fits all of those criteria--and certainly four.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And here's the DSM-III's definition of Masochism or as they prefer to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; describe it, &quot;self-defeating personality disorder&quot;:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Masochistic (Self-defeating) Personality Disorder
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (The Loyalist)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Self-defeating Personality Disorder is a pervasive pattern of self-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defeating behavior, beginning by early adulthood and present in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; variety of contexts. The person may often avoid or undermine
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pleasurable experiences, be drawn to situations or relationships in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which he or she will suffer, and prevent others from helping him or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her, as indicated by at least five of the following:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *chooses people and situations that lead to disappointment, failure,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or mistreatment even when better options are clearly available;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *rejects or renders ineffective the attempts of others to help him of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *following positive personal events (e.g., new achievement), responds
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with depression, guilt, or a behavior that produces pain ( e.g., an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accident);

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *incites angry or rejecting responses from others and then feels hurt,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defeated, or humiliated (e.g., makes fun of spouse in public,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; provoking an angry retort, then feels devastated);

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *rejects opportunities for pleasure, or is reluctant to acknowledge
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enjoying himself or herself (despite having adequate social skills and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the capacity for pleasure);

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *fails to accomplish tasks crucial to his or her personal objectives
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; despite demonstrated ability to do so, (e.g., helps fellow students
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; write papers , but is unable to write his or her own);

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *is uninterested in or rejects people who consistently treat him or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her well, (e.g., is not attracted to caring sexual partners);

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *engages in excessive self-sacrifice that is unsolicited by the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intended recipients of the sacrifice;

&gt; &gt; WelshWolly,

&gt; &gt; I was not inferring ignorance in any derogatory way.

&gt; &gt; In order to reach the truth as you put it, one must look to the
&gt; &gt; origins of religion, Christianity, Philosophy, and Theology.
&gt; &gt; The history of philosophy tells a sorry tale it's true, but it does
&gt; &gt; enlighten us as to the truth of the beginnings of gods and
&gt; &gt; religious thinking, with all its cruel and bloodthirsty fanaticism.
&gt; &gt; If one goes back to the very first recorded history of philosophy,
&gt; &gt; one clearly sees from whence gods were derived and why,
&gt; &gt; and how religions took upon themselves the promotion of gods,
&gt; &gt; and used them to good effect for their own purposes, which
&gt; &gt; were by no means honourable.
&gt; &gt; I am not enveigled by any supersticious mysticism. I am
&gt; &gt; interested in truth.

&gt; &gt; Your talk of gods tells me you are not aligned with truth,
&gt; &gt; but are caught in the web of lies and deceits of religious
&gt; &gt; fantasy and scriptural farce.

&gt; &gt; It is to be deplored.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for pointing out my ignorance.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's interesting that you cite the Bible as a source of exposure of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the dubious tendencies of sadomasochists - surely you don't need to
&gt; &gt; &gt; refer to any religious text in this context. Must we become enmired in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the superficial citation of the names of books and people in order to
&gt; &gt; &gt; reach truth?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, it may be true according to some that the populous at large can
&gt; &gt; &gt; become enveigled by certain ideas pertaining or not to religion, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; that itself is such an idea - has it enveigled you?

&gt; &gt; &gt; In order to reach the truth as you put it, one must look to the

&gt; &gt; &gt; The history of philosophy tells a sorry tale it's true, but it does
&gt; &gt; &gt; enlighten us as to the truth of the beginnings of gods and
&gt; &gt; &gt; religious thinking, with all its cruel and bloodthirsty fanaticism.
&gt; &gt; &gt; If one goes back to the very first recorded history of philosophy,
&gt; &gt; &gt; one clearly sees from whence gods were derived and why,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and how religions took upon themselves the promotion of gods,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and used them to good effect for their own purposes, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; were by no means honourable.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not enveigled by any supersticious mysticism. I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; interested in truth.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Your talk of gods tells me you are not aligned with truth,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but are caught in the web of lies and deceits of religious
&gt; &gt; &gt; fantasy and scriptural farce.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is to be deplored.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's interesting that you cite the Bible as a source of exposure of

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, it may be true according to some that the populous at large can

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is unfortunate that our first encounter is, on my part, by way of

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Marquis de Sade was an aristocrat and Colonel von Masoc was

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The benign, loving god of which to speak, as far as anyone on this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planet is aware, has never been known to exist. Therefore is would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seem more than a little presumptous to assume that it was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadomasocistic of nature. There is no doubt but that the persons
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; responsible for producing the pagonistic literature that introduces
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this imagary and calling it god, were of doubtful tendencies as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; buy bull clearly demonstrates.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is to be regretted that religion has so einveigledthe populous at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; large, that vast numbers now believe this rubbish.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadomasochism is demonstraby a product not of Christianity but of any

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadomasochistic; and we haven't even mentioned the New Testament yet.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To say that God must be a sadist and all his followers masochists,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Loyalists, slaves, is false. It is not God who persecutes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LL: What makes you think god is not a sadist? If we accept the current
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theory of god and eternal damnation, he is a sadist, and if you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe in it anyway, you're a masochist.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is from DSM-III-R

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadistic personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of cruel,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; demeaning, and aggressive behavior, beginning by early adulthood, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indicated by the repeated occurrence of at least four of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; following:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Has used physical cruelty or violence for the purpose of establishing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dominance in a relationship (not merely to achieve some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noninterpersonal goal, such as striking someone in order to rob him or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Humiliates or demeans people in the presence of others
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Has treated or disciplined someone under his or her control unusually
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harshly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Is amused by, or takes pleasure in, the psychological or physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suffering of others (including animals)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Has lied for the purpose of harming or inflicting pain on others (not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; merely to achieve some other goal)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Gets other people to do what he or she wants by frightening them
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (through intimidation or even terror)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Restricts the autonomy of people with whom he or she has a close
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relationship, e.g., will not let spouse leave the house unaccompanied
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or permit teenage daughter to attend social functions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Is fascinated by violence, weapons, injury, or torture

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LL: Sound familiar? An argument could be made that the christian god
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fits all of those criteria--and certainly four.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And here's the DSM-III's definition of Masochism or as they prefer to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; describe it, &quot;self-defeating personality disorder&quot;:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Masochistic (Self-defeating) Personality Disorder
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (The Loyalist)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Self-defeating Personality Disorder is a pervasive pattern of self-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defeating behavior, beginning by early adulthood and present in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; variety of contexts. The person may often avoid or undermine
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pleasurable experiences, be drawn to situations or relationships in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which he or she will suffer, and prevent others from helping him or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her, as indicated by at least five of the following:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *chooses people and situations that lead to disappointment, failure,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or mistreatment even when better options are clearly available;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *rejects or renders ineffective the attempts of others to help him of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *following positive personal events (e.g., new achievement), responds
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with depression, guilt, or a behavior that produces pain ( e.g., an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accident);

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *incites angry or rejecting responses from others and then feels hurt,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defeated, or humiliated (e.g., makes fun of spouse in public,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; provoking an angry retort, then feels devastated);

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *rejects opportunities for pleasure, or is reluctant to acknowledge
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enjoying himself or herself (despite having adequate social skills and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the capacity for pleasure);

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *fails to accomplish tasks crucial to his or her personal objectives
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; despite demonstrated ability to do so, (e.g., helps fellow students
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; write papers , but is unable to write his or her own);

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *is uninterested in or rejects people who consistently treat him or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her well, (e.g., is not attracted to caring sexual partners);

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *engages in excessive self-sacrifice that is unsolicited by the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intended recipients of the sacrifice;

lawrey,

'Salmonids' are fish from the family Salmonidae.   'Salmoides' refers
to specific species such as the Black Bass (Micropterus salmoides -
although from the family Centrarchidae).  Salmonoid indicates a
relation to the suborder Salmonoidea.  Finally, 'salmonella' is I what
I just spread on Keith MacNevins' picnic sanwiches (with my trusty
butterfish knife).

Yours ichthyologically.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was not inferring ignorance in any derogatory way.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In order to reach the truth as you put it, one must look to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; origins of religion, Christianity, Philosophy, and Theology.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The history of philosophy tells a sorry tale it's true, but it does
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enlighten us as to the truth of the beginnings of gods and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; religious thinking, with all its cruel and bloodthirsty fanaticism.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one goes back to the very first recorded history of philosophy,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one clearly sees from whence gods were derived and why,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and how religions took upon themselves the promotion of gods,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and used them to good effect for their own purposes, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were by no means honourable.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not enveigled by any supersticious mysticism. I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in truth.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your talk of gods tells me you are not aligned with truth,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but are caught in the web of lies and deceits of religious
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fantasy and scriptural farce.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is to be deplored.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for pointing out my ignorance.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's interesting that you cite the Bible as a source of exposure of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the dubious tendencies of sadomasochists - surely you don't need to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; refer to any religious text in this context. Must we become enmired in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the superficial citation of the names of books and people in order to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reach truth?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, it may be true according to some that the populous at large can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; become enveigled by certain ideas pertaining or not to religion, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that itself is such an idea - has it enveigled you?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't believe I have had the pleasure of addressing you prior to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is unfortunate that our first encounter is, on my part, by way of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; critique.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Marquis de Sade was an aristocrat and Colonel von Masoc was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a military man, his dispositional opposite. People not a book!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The benign, loving god of which to speak, as far as anyone on this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planet is aware, has never been known to exist. Therefore is would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seem more than a little presumptous to assume that it was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadomasocistic of nature. There is no doubt but that the persons
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; responsible for producing the pagonistic literature that introduces
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this imagary and calling it god, were of doubtful tendencies as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; buy bull clearly demonstrates.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is to be regretted that religion has so einveigledthe populous at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; large, that vast numbers now believe this rubbish.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One has to question the nature of the relationship between the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relationships in which he or she will suffer at the hands of others,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the rest of society, healthy or otherwise, who, presumably, in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world of the Loyalist, actually fulfill his/her wishes to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dominated, humilliated, hurt etc., given that they all fit the pattern
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that drives him/her towards those people most likely to exploit him/
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her. Presumably, also, this individual would prefer the company of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Satan as a lover, protector, guardian etc. rather than a benign,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loving God as creator and friend.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadomasochism is demonstraby a product not of Christianity but of any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire to manipulate and to control which is psychologically endorsed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by the second person, i.e. me. If you actualy think about the Ten
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Commandments, for example, you will find that they are far from being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadomasochistic; and we haven't even mentioned the New Testament yet.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To say that God must be a sadist and all his followers masochists,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Loyalists, slaves, is false. It is not God who persecutes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This entire thread is a rather pathetic and pompous attempt to make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fun of something true, written by idiots with nothing better to do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than to try to be clever while avoiding the obvious by not thiking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about it. I have never read Marquis de Sade, but it sounds like a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stupid book to me!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was not inferring ignorance in any derogatory way.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In order to reach the truth as you put it, one must look to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; origins of religion, Christianity, Philosophy, and Theology.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The history of philosophy tells a sorry tale it's true, but it does
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enlighten us as to the truth of the beginnings of gods and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; religious thinking, with all its cruel and bloodthirsty fanaticism.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one goes back to the very first recorded history of philosophy,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one clearly sees from whence gods were derived and why,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and how religions took upon themselves the promotion of gods,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and used them to good effect for their own purposes, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were by no means honourable.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not enveigled by any supersticious mysticism. I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in truth.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your talk of gods tells me you are not aligned with truth,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but are caught in the web of lies and deceits of religious
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fantasy and scriptural farce.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is to be deplored.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for pointing out my ignorance.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's interesting that you cite the Bible as a source of exposure of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the dubious tendencies of sadomasochists - surely you don't need to

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the superficial citation of the names of books and people in order to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reach truth?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, it may be true according to some that the populous at large can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; become enveigled by certain ideas pertaining or not to religion, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that itself is such an idea - has it enveigled you?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is unfortunate that our first encounter is, on my part, by way of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; critique.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Marquis de Sade was an aristocrat and Colonel von Masoc was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a military man, his dispositional opposite. People not a book!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The benign, loving god of which to speak, as far as anyone on this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planet is aware, has never been known to exist. Therefore is would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seem more than a little presumptous to assume that it was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadomasocistic of nature. There is no doubt but that the persons
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; responsible for producing the pagonistic literature that introduces
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this imagary and calling it god, were of doubtful tendencies as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; buy bull clearly demonstrates.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is to be regretted that religion has so einveigledthe populous at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; large, that vast numbers now believe this rubbish.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relationships in which he or she will suffer at the hands of others,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the rest of society, healthy or otherwise, who, presumably, in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world of the Loyalist, actually fulfill his/her wishes to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dominated, humilliated, hurt etc., given that they all fit the pattern

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her. Presumably, also, this individual would prefer the company of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Satan as a lover, protector, guardian etc. rather than a benign,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loving God as creator and friend.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadomasochism is demonstraby a product not of Christianity but of any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire to manipulate and to control which is psychologically endorsed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by the second person, i.e. me. If you actualy think about the Ten
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Commandments, for example, you will find that they are far from being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadomasochistic; and we haven't even mentioned the New Testament yet.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To say that God must be a sadist and all his followers masochists,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Loyalists, slaves, is false. It is not God who persecutes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This entire thread is a rather pathetic and pompous attempt to make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fun of something true, written by idiots with nothing better to do

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is from DSM-III-R

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadistic personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of cruel,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indicated by the repeated occurrence of at least four of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; following:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Has used physical cruelty or violence for the purpose of establishing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dominance in a relationship (not merely to achieve some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noninterpersonal goal, such as striking someone in order to rob him or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Humiliates or demeans people in the presence of others
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Has treated or disciplined someone under his or her control unusually
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harshly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Is amused by, or takes pleasure in, the psychological or physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suffering of others (including animals)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Has lied for the purpose of harming or inflicting pain on others (not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; merely to achieve some other goal)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Gets other people to do what he or she wants by frightening them
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (through intimidation or even terror)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Restricts the autonomy of people with whom he or she has a close
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relationship, e.g., will not let spouse leave the house unaccompanied
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or permit teenage daughter to attend social functions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Is fascinated by violence, weapons, injury, or torture

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LL: Sound familiar? An argument could be made that the christian god
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fits all of those criteria--and certainly four.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And here's the DSM-III's definition of Masochism or as they prefer to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; describe it, &quot;self-defeating personality disorder&quot;:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (The Loyalist)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Self-defeating Personality Disorder is a pervasive pattern of self-

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is unfortunate that our first encounter is, on my part, by way of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; critique.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Marquis de Sade was an aristocrat and Colonel von Masoc was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a military man, his dispositional opposite. People not a book!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The benign, loving god of which to speak, as far as anyone on this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planet is aware, has never been known to exist. Therefore is would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seem more than a little presumptous to assume that it was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadomasocistic of nature. There is no doubt but that the persons
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; responsible for producing the pagonistic literature that introduces
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this imagary and calling it god, were of doubtful tendencies as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; buy bull clearly demonstrates.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is to be regretted that religion has so einveigledthe populous at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; large, that vast numbers now believe this rubbish.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relationships in which he or she will suffer at the hands of others,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the rest of society, healthy or otherwise, who, presumably, in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world of the Loyalist, actually fulfill his/her wishes to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dominated, humilliated, hurt etc., given that they all fit the pattern
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that drives him/her towards those people most likely to exploit him/
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her. Presumably, also, this individual would prefer the company of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Satan as a lover, protector, guardian etc. rather than a benign,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loving God as creator and friend.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadomasochism is demonstraby a product not of Christianity but of any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire to manipulate and to control which is psychologically endorsed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by the second person, i.e. me. If you actualy think about the Ten
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Commandments, for example, you will find that they are far from being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadomasochistic; and we haven't even mentioned the New Testament yet.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To say that God must be a sadist and all his followers masochists,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Loyalists, slaves, is false. It is not God who persecutes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This entire thread is a rather pathetic and pompous attempt to make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fun of something true, written by idiots with nothing better to do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than to try to be clever while avoiding the obvious by not thiking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about it. I have never read Marquis de Sade, but it sounds like a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stupid book to me!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; following:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Has used physical cruelty or violence for the purpose of establishing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dominance in a relationship (not merely to achieve some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noninterpersonal goal, such as striking someone in order to rob him or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Humiliates or demeans people in the presence of others
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Has treated or disciplined someone under his or her control unusually
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harshly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Is amused by, or takes pleasure in, the psychological or physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suffering of others (including animals)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Has lied for the purpose of harming or inflicting pain on others (not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; merely to achieve some other goal)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Gets other people to do what he or she wants by frightening them
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (through intimidation or even terror)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Restricts the autonomy of people with whom he or she has a close
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relationship, e.g., will not let spouse leave the house unaccompanied
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or permit teenage daughter to attend social functions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Is fascinated by violence, weapons, injury, or torture

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LL: Sound familiar? An argument could be made that the christian god
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fits all of those criteria--and certainly four.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is unfortunate that our first encounter is, on my part, by way of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; critique.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Marquis de Sade was an aristocrat and Colonel von Masoc was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a military man, his dispositional opposite. People not a book!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The benign, loving god of which to speak, as far as anyone on this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planet is aware, has never been known to exist. Therefore is would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seem more than a little presumptous to assume that it was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadomasocistic of nature. There is no doubt but that the persons
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; responsible for producing the pagonistic literature that introduces
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this imagary and calling it god, were of doubtful tendencies as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; buy bull clearly demonstrates.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is to be regretted that religion has so einveigledthe populous at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; large, that vast numbers now believe this rubbish.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relationships in which he or she will suffer at the hands of others,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the rest of society, healthy or otherwise, who, presumably, in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world of the Loyalist, actually fulfill his/her wishes to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dominated, humilliated, hurt etc., given that they all fit the pattern
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that drives him/her towards those people most likely to exploit him/
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her. Presumably, also, this individual would prefer the company of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Satan as a lover, protector, guardian etc. rather than a benign,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loving God as creator and friend.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadomasochism is demonstraby a product not of Christianity but of any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire to manipulate and to control which is psychologically endorsed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by the second person, i.e. me. If you actualy think about the Ten
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Commandments, for example, you will find that they are far from being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadomasochistic; and we haven't even mentioned the New Testament yet.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To say that God must be a sadist and all his followers masochists,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Loyalists, slaves, is false. It is not God who persecutes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This entire thread is a rather pathetic and pompous attempt to make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fun of something true, written by idiots with nothing better to do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than to try to be clever while avoiding the obvious by not thiking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about it. I have never read Marquis de Sade, but it sounds like a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stupid book to me!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LL: What makes you think god is not a sadist? If we accept the current
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theory of god and eternal damnation, he is a sadist, and if you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe in it anyway, you're a masochist.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is from DSM-III-R

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadistic personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of cruel,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; demeaning, and aggressive behavior, beginning by early adulthood, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indicated by the repeated occurrence of at least four of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; following:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Has used physical cruelty or violence for the purpose of establishing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dominance in a relationship (not merely to achieve some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noninterpersonal goal, such as striking someone in order to rob him or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Humiliates or demeans people in the presence of others
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Has treated or disciplined someone under his or her control unusually
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harshly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Is amused by, or takes pleasure in, the psychological or physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suffering of others (including animals)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Has lied for the purpose of harming or inflicting pain on others (not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; merely to achieve some other goal)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Gets other people to do what he or she wants by frightening them
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (through intimidation or even terror)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Restricts the autonomy of people with whom he or she has a close
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relationship, e.g., will not let spouse leave the house unaccompanied
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or permit teenage daughter to attend social functions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Is fascinated by violence, weapons, injury, or torture

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LL: Sound familiar? An argument could be made that the christian god
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fits all of those criteria--and certainly four.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And here's the DSM-III's definition of Masochism or as they prefer to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; describe it, &quot;self-defeating personality
