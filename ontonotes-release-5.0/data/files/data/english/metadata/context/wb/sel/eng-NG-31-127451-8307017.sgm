The Bellevue 8th Ward was and is a Young Adult Ward in Bellevue,
Washington, just east of Seattle. The following is a true account of a
sex scandal and cover-up that occurred there in 1987-89.

I met Larry in 1987, he had just been divorced. He was humble (the
first and last time in his life I think).
Larry was 6'5&quot;, and had blondish hair. He was a BYU grad, and an
Enginner with Boeing in Seattle. His wife of 5 years had just divorced
him. His wife had been a Miss Utah (forget the year...late 70s).

Larry and I became roommates, and we were friends and associates for
about 3 years. He liked intellectual
conversations, and I am an intellectual and enjoy such conversations.
During this time I was becoming very skeptical of the LDS Church,
although I had served a mission. I was at this time studying other
religions. Although I still considered myself a Mormon, I was becoming
more than more disillusioned with Mormons in general; Mormon bishops,
Mormon leaders, Mormon women, etc. I found in Larry somebody I could
talk to without being shunned, as most Mormons were shunning me by
this time.

Larry confided in me, he told me about his life in the Church, and at
BYU. He spent 6 years at BYU. He made BYU appear to be a HUGE FREE
BROTHELL.  I could sense he was not lying, but I assumed that he was
referring to 3% of Mormon women, who had no morals, and not to the 97%
who were moral.  He would just laugh at me and shake his head! He was
born and raised in the Church. According to Larry, Mormon girls were
just like all women, that they weren't any more moral than
prostitutes; give them what they want, or pretend they will get what
they want, and they will give you all the sex you want...PERIOD!!!  I
disagreed with him fervently, and said that perhaps 3% of Mormon women
were that way, but he should not judge all Mormon women by the 3% who
were like that. I was to discover in the coming years that I WAS WRONG
AND LARRY WAS RIGHT!!!!

Larry sexually seduced scores of young active Mormon girls in and
around the Seattle area over the next two years. For over 18 months
during this time, he had a 17 year old live-in girlfriend, that he
treated like SHIT, called her &quot;THE BITCH&quot;. Yet, the young girl made
gorgeous meals for him every night, washed his clothes, gave him sex
every night, and put up with his abuse for 18 months. He finally moved
leaving her behind.

All during the time he had this girlfriend, he was &quot;dating&quot; active
Mormon girls, from ages 18 to 29 (he was 36-37 at this time). He had
many marriage proposals from these girls, two of them were 18, a few
around 20 or 21, and several returned missionary sisters (YES!). They
all loved him dearly, and chased him. He referred to these women as
&quot;whores&quot; and &quot;fat-asses&quot; etc. He used them for sex, but he considered
himself FAR...FAR superior to all of them.

Finally, he met a girl named KARAN at the Belleuve 8th Ward (a
Single's Ward). She looked like a fashion model. He fell in LOVE!!!
He respected her, and did nothing at all sexual with her. After
all...he was going to take her to the Temple!!! All during this time,
of course, he had anywhere from 4 to 6 girlsfriends at any one time.

Larry would invite a girl home then have her sit on his lap, then he
would massage her shoulders, then her breasts, then he crotch, then
unzip her crotch and &quot;finger&quot; the girl to climax. How many girls
called the police on him? ZERO!!! The VAST great majority of these
active Mormon girls (including returned missionaries) interpreted what
Larry did to them as LOVE! I KID YOU ___NOT___!

Larry gave them an orgasm, and they thought this meant he LOVED them
and wanted to marry them. It didn't. He considered them &quot;whores&quot; and
compared them to pieces of toilet paper; to be used once as needed,
then disgarded. During the last 6 months I knew him, he was trying to
become a CHAPERONE for Youth dances! Why? He was growing tired of all
the sex he was getting from 18 and 19 year old Mormon girls. HE WANTED
THE 13 and 14 MORMON GIRLS TOO!!! He used to tell me sometimes, &quot;You
know Darrick, if a girl had HAIR DOWN THERE that means they are old
enough for sex!&quot;

All during this time, Mormon girls from ages 18 to 35 would invite him
to Sunday dinners, and he would come home from 3 to 5 pieces of paper
in his pocket every Sunday, shoved into his pocket by Mormon girls he
would meet at the Young Adult Ward. I saw the papers with their
numbers. I saw the letters he received from them, BEGGING him to call
them. I answered the phone when he was not there, from young Mormon
girls DESPERATE for him to call them back. This went on for YEARS.

I came back many a night only to see a girl come out of his room, or
go into it.

All this time, my attitude was, &quot;IT IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS!!!&quot; I never
spread TRUE rumors about this girls, or him, at Church. My philosophy
was that what other people did WAS NONE OF MY BUSINESS!!!

During this time I tried to date, but attractive girls would not date
me. I remember calling one and asking her out. After a short period of
silence, she said, &quot;BUT....I&quot;M &quot;&quot;&quot;BETTER&quot;&quot;&quot; THAN YOU!!!&quot; and hung up
the phone. Finally, I began to date fat girls. I wasn't attracted to
them, but, I thought, &quot;Well, if this is who God wants me to date, then
I'll try to fall in love with one of them!!!&quot; Of course, I couldn't
fall in love with any of them, but I tried very hard to do so. I
figured if I grew to love a fat woman as a person, then this love
would grow into sexual attractive. NEVER DID! At any rate, I kept
trying, because the other girls would not talk to me usually, much
less date me.

At first the fat girls seemed very happy I was dating them, but then
they would say, &quot;The other girls in the Ward say you're a LOSER! I'm
not sure if I can see you again!&quot; I discovered that the attractive
girls in the Ward were telling the fat ones, &quot;Oh, don't go out with
DARRICK! Ugggg! He's a LOSER! Have you seen his car?&quot;  Some of the fat
girls dumped me. But a few of them wanted to marry me, regardless of
what the other girls said, but, ultimately, I could not go through
with marrying one of them, because from Day One until the last day I
knew them, they repulsed me physically. I tried to become attracted to
them, but it never worked.

Why did the attractive women in the Ward treat me so bad? What did I
DO to this women? Nothing! I had a junky car, and junky clothes, and
low-wage jobs. That was it. Larry had a nice car and nice clothes, and
a very good job. He was a WINNER that women chased. I was a LOSER than
these women HATED! I mean that, I was despised.

Finally, there was a very nice girl, thin, who planned to go on a
mission. Larry seduced her, and then dumped her. To her credit, she
cancelled her mission plans.  By then, I'd had ENOUGH!!!  I went to
the bishop of the Bellevue 8th Ward and told him what Larry was doing.
He looked at me with a self-righteous smirk on his face, and said,
&quot;Larry? Larry? I see him EVERY SUNDAY! I hardly ever see YOU at all!
And LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE WARING! You look like a BUM OFF THE STREET!&quot;

He went on to tell me that Larry was NOT seducing girls, that I was
just jealous of him, and making up things (lying), and that girls
chased Larry because he was LIVING THE GOSPEL, and girls rejected me
because I was &quot;NOT LIVING THE GOSPEL&quot;. Finally, he told me to stop
lying and get a new suit!

His name was Bishop Kunzler (yes...really!). He was the Vice
Presidents of Boeing at that time. They had many.
Anyway, I went to the Ward for 3 more weeks, but I then completely
inactive and went back to my parents to live.

About 5 months later, I get a call from &quot;Bishop Johnson&quot; of the
Bellevue 8th Ward. At first I was defensive, but this is what he told
me. He told me that he had been bishop of the 8th Ward for 2 months,
having replaced Kuntzler. He told me the first Sunday he was Bishop
about 5 girls came to see him, saying, &quot;Bishop, there's a guy in the
Ward named Larry. He did this and that to my friend. I just don't want
him to do this to more girls.&quot;
He told me that he tried to get Larry into his office several times by
saying, &quot;Can you come see me after Sacrament?&quot; and Larry would say,
&quot;Sure!&quot; then never show up. Finally, Johnson literally corralled him
into his office as Larry was passing in the hall, and confronted him,
and Larry laughed and said, &quot;Ha ha ha...these girls ARE ALL LIARS!!!!&quot;

Johnson told Larry, &quot;You are NOT welcome in this Ward again while I am
bishop of it!&quot; Larry left that Young Adult Ward, and promptly went to
another one (Lake Washington Single's Ward) about 4 miles away.

Johnson had gotten my number from an old Ward directory, because a few
of the girls had told him that &quot;Darrick Evenson&quot; was Larry's roommate.
Johnson wanted to me to confirm what the girls were saying was true.

I told Johnson that Larry would normally bring young girls home after
a Young Adult Dance, seduce them, then drive them back to their cars,
all the time he would tell his 17 year old girlfriend to wait upstairs
for him, in bed, and remain silent so as not to &quot;spook&quot; the girl he
had on the coach downstairs. SHE OBEYED COMPLETELY...for over 18
months!!! Then, on Sunday mornings, he would get out of bed with his
young girlfriend, take a shower, put on his best Sunday suit, then go
to Church; there to get numerous offerings for Sunday dinners, and
phone numbers shoved into his pockets; all from young attractive
active female single Members of the Ward, including at least two
returned missionaries that I know of.

Anyway, Johnson decided he would have a 'Meeting&quot; that included me,
himself, his first counsellor in the Bellevue 8th Ward bishopric, and
the bishops of the Wards that Larry was attending or had attended.
Four of us showed up, and I recounted what I knew. Suddenly, Johnson
told me, &quot;I phoned Bishop Kunzler about this, and he told me YOU NEVER
TOLD HER WHAT LARRY WAS DOING!&quot; I said, &quot;Not only did I tell him, I
shoved notes under his door for 3 Sundays after that, saying; &quot;PLEASE
DO SOMETHING ABOUT LARRY!&quot; Kunzler simply gave me looks like he wanted
to kill me!&quot;

The men in the room stood up and said, &quot;ARE YOU CALLING BISHOP KUNZLER
A LIAR? HE'S PROBABLY IS GOING TO BE OUR NEXT STAKE PRESIDENT!!!!&quot;

You see, Dear Reader, for Mormons the higher Church office you have,
the closer you are to God, and the more righteous you MUST be!

Of course, Kunzler LIED THROUGH HIS TEETH. I told him about Larry, but
he refused to believe me.

Anyway, to make a long story short, Bishop Johnson went and help a
special session with the Relief Society in the Bellevue 8th Ward,
warning them about Larry. I went to the Bellevue 8th Ward that day.
After Relief Society was over I was walking past, in the hall, and one
girl said to another (whom I had seen making Larry breakfast once),
&quot;Susie, didn't YOU go out with Larry once or twice?&quot; and Susie said,
&quot;Oh, NO! He asked me out but I refused to go out with him!&quot; I knew of
course THIS WAS A LIE, but I didn't say anything. I just walked on. I
began to feel sick, so I went to the Men's room, and I threw-up.

Now, Bishop Johnson had plans to hold a few Church Courts with a few
of the girls that had been sexually involved with Larry, but one of
these girls was the daughter of a member of the Stake High Council, a
very wealthy Old Utah Pioneer family. Calls to Salt Lake City were
made, and ALL the Church Courts were cancelled, and Bishop Johnson was
RELEASED from his calling! He was FIRED!!! He only served as bishop
about 5 and 1/2 months.

On the other hand, Bishop Kunzler, the man who called me a LIAR twice,
the man who covered-up Larry's womanizing,  a man who LIED to Bishop
Johnson saying I never told him about Larry, was soon called as 2nd
Counsellor in the Bellevue Stake Presidency.

Larry was NEVER called to a Church Court. None of the active Mormon
girls and women who were sexually involved with Larry, to one degree
or another, were ever called to a Church Court.  I tried going to the
Bellevue 8th Ward several times after this, but the women, and most of
the men, treated me like a Jew at a Nazi rally! Not long afterwards, I
went completely inactive, and eventually resigned from the LDS Church
in July of 1996.

In 2005 I became a Daheshist, and I am very happy now in my new
religion.
