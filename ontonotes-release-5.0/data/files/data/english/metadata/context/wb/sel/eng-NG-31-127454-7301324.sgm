All answers valid until JKR opens her mouth again and dependent upon how
far into time the epilogue takes us, especially regarding pregnancies and
natural deaths.

I concede that I take a cue from gjw and choose more deaths than I
normally would to spread out the odds. It really isn't going to get _all_
that bloody.

You appear to have two definitions of "M" and I try to specify.

Wouldn't this whole thing be easier respond to and score if the defaults
were simply allowed to stand?

What's the grand prize?

DIVINATION TEST

INSTRUCTIONS:

All questions concern predictions of what will be revealed in book 7,
even when the questions relate to past events.  To be graded after the
release of book 7.  Answers marked "default" will be presumed correct
if Book 7 provides no additional information.  For True/False
questions, the default answer is always "False."

Scoring:  Each question is worth at least one point.  However, daring
guesses are rewarded, if correct:   scoring is curved to grant
additional points depending on the number of respondents who choose a
different response, divided by the number who answer correctly
(rounding down).  Hence if 2 people answer a T/F qustion "T" and 4
answer "F" and T turns out to be correct, then those who answered "T"
will get 1 + (4/2= 2) = 3 points.

Thanks.  Your answers have been recorded.  You are the Third

Like I said, the scoring system has been designed to rewards brave
guessers to some extent.  There is no penalty for inconsistency.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Regardless of which you specify, you will be marked correct if, at the
close of book 7, that character is hospitalized either indefinitely or
permanently.  So far, all known examples of this involve some form of
madness (the closed ward on St. Mungo's).

But I had to run it through an interpreter program so some points were rewritten to
make sence.  This is do to how my system handles punctuation.  So I changed things
around to make them clearer when my system reads them to me.

That depends.  I go with the default if you mean willingly.  But I expect at least
one of the above to be imperoed.  And I think blaze will be a bigger player.

Thank you.  I have recorded most of your answers, and you are now
contestant number 8.  There were problems with some of your answers,
however, and I have listed them below.  If I recorded the wrong
answer, please tell me:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
> > 8 Snape    D or p
">

Unfortunately, you must choose a single answer.  Unless you indicate
otherwise, I will record your as "D", merely because you placed that
answer first.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Same problem.  I recorded your answer as "U".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
> > 12. Lucius     D if he gets back to V but P if he stays where he is.
">

I recorded your answer as "D", because you mentioned it first.  If you
think "P" is a better bet, let me know.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
> > 35. Delores Umbridge  U (She's already Mad.) P or D at the end
">

I recorded your answer as "U" for "Undead" because you listed it
first.  If you prefer another option, let me know.  I should clarify
that she is not already "M" because, although she is arguably Mad, she
is not currently confined on that basis.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Nice predictions.  I will keep them in mind in case I do a
supplemental test.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

It is a poorly worded question, but the basic idea is that there is no
locket Horcrux, and the locket is merely a container for the true
Horcrux.  Based on what you wrote, recorded your answer as "F".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

Another poorly worded question on my part.  I mean either that he will
recover his ability to form new memories sufficient to be released
from St Mungo's, or that he will recover specific previously forgotten
memories.  Since F is the default, either development will have to be
specifically mentioned.  I would not count a general statement from
the nurse that he is continuing to improve.

I recorded your answer as "F".  Let me know if you want to change
it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
> > 123.  Which character will receive the Order of Merlin, First Class?

">

That would be "A", "B" or "C".  Since you typed "Harry" first, I
recorded your answer as "A".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I recorded your answer as "H" for "None of the Above".  Out of
curiosity, does "Emy" refer to "Emmeline Vance"?

I would not count an imperius curse victim as a "traitor", so I
recorded your answer as "H", which is the default.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Even though both could be correct, you need to choose one.  I put you
down for "B" (meaning Percy will die) because you wrote it first.

I put you down for "D" (Mrs. Norris) because you wrote it first.  Let
me know if you prefer F (Errol).

On this one, I intend to stick with my original mistake and keep the
original letters (which were A, B, A, B, C, D, respectively.  Thus,
"A" will be marked correct if Harry finds it at Zechariah Smith's
house OR at Hogsmeade.  "B" will be marked correct if Harry finds it
at Hogwarts OR London.

I am unsure if you want "A" (Zechariah Smith's house) or "B" (London)
or "D" (None of the Above).

I recorded "A" (12 Grimmauld Place) because you wrote it first.  Let

Any information revealed in Book 7 counts, including the epilogue.  Do

I marked you as "J" (an animated potrait) because you wrote it first.
Let me know if you prefer "L" (nobody except Pettigrew).  Note that J
and L are meant to be mutually exclusive.  Even if Pettigrew turns out
to have been present, "L" will NOT be marked correct if anyone else,
including an animated portrait, is also present.

No I expect him to get back to V and wind up dead.  That is the bigest chance.

Ok I see what you mean.  And I will still go for ghost as I think her character is the

By the way if you do that I think you should list all the people up in the same area
where we have more then true or false.  Some of that area I would have listed as in
hospital or prison rather  then the one or other pick.

No I don't think he will get that good.  I don't think he will be releast.  But it is

Truely if K was done the same as the others She would be the top pick.  she should be put
in her own true or false question.
But I expect a fight to happen at hogwarts and before that I think a DE will kill
fliche's cat just to cause him pain.

I think the old forest is the one in albainey.  But albainea is my guess.

If the destruction of his "ghost" truly caused his soul to depart
(rather than rendering him a relatively powerless, but still-
earthbound spirit), then I would count him as "dead" at the close of
the novel.

Okay, Tonks it is.  But I *do* mean the *next* DADA teacher.  It need
not be the one during Harry's seventh year if the position remains
vacant during that period.

She also knows too much, judging from her behavior in Book 5.

Well, the question asks about "someone else" and since Harry,
Voldemort, James and Lily are all mentioned in the question, they are
all meant to be excluded.

That aside, I would include anyone who was close enough to observe or
overhear or otherwise interact during any portion of what was going on
between Voldemort and the Potters that night.  It would not
necessarily matter if they were not in the room.
