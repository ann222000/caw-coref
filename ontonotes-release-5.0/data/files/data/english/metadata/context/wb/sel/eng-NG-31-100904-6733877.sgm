I have run across something I will post.  For one thing it touches
at some tangent on the topic of "mana" or psychic energy, which
has come up in another set of threads.

The idea of psychic energy approached in terms of "mana" brings up
the very weird idea that some arcane energy more or less floats
around in our environment; presumably one might walk into a cloud
of it without knowing it and then suddenly feel energized or some
such thing.  I am not above metaphysical speculations along these
lines.  Jung pointed out that it is characteristically human to
engage in metaphysical speculation.  And if such and such an idea
turns out not to be true when the real facts eventually come to be
known, then the fact of there having been the speculation is still
quite interesting in itself.  In another thread I just mentioned
that the "E" energy of physics turns out to be oddly similar in
some ways to the most ancient concept of mana - an observation Jung
made and found to be of interest.

Anyway, in this text that I will post, there is mention of psychic
energy but in a way that seemingly would not link up with "mama"
speculations.  The idea here is that psychic energy is generated by
psychic conflict within the individual.  That would seem to be
quite true.  I don't know how this idea might connect up with
metaphysical speculations about energy fields, but I will try to
keep both in mind at the same time anyway.  We know that over in
physics the "E" energy can be neither created nor destroyed, so
perhaps "generated" is not the best possible term to use, but
often it is used.  Perhaps "allocated" would be a better term?

In any event, the phrase "psychical energy" occurs only near the
beginning of the text that I will post, but it is interesting to
hold on to that thought while reading the next several sentences.
Those sentences are interesting in themselves in that they in a
rather efficient and elegant way articulate the whole basic idea
central to Jungian psychology.

The quote starts right off with the concept of "conflict."  In
the larger context that I pulled the quote from it is very clear
that Jung is speaking of _internal_ conflict.  He made that as
clear as could be earlier on, but we are joining him in progress.
Here is the quote -

=======(begin quote)=======
We need [internal] conflict and the willingness to accept it.
For conflict is the origin of our psychical energy - there can be
no energy without it.  We must have conflict, otherwise we don't
live. ... Conflict is absolutely indispensable for individuation.
You cannot individuate as long as you are identical with your aims
and activities because they are always only one aspect, and if you
identify with only one aspect of yourself you are merely an
autonomous function, an autonomous aspect of yourself.  But if you
accept the conflict between two or several aspects of personality,
you have a chance to individuate, because you then need a center
between the conflicting tendencies; then individuation makes sense.
If you are identical with only one aspect of yourself, you are
naturally up against the unconscious, and then it looks as if your
enemy were outside of yourself; at least you don't understand why
you should be opposed from within because you only see that one
tendency with which you are identical, and do not see the opposing
tendencies.  So you project your aspects into other people who
then become your bete noire.  They seem to be the cause of your
defeat or your neurosis; one likes to accuse father and mother or
a wrong education or enemies in order to excuse oneself for one's
own defeat. --Jung (quote from seminar given on June 19th 1935)
=======(end quote)=======

Ok, so two possibilities are available -

1. I can have a number of conflicting aspects of my personality
more or less conscious.  Of course I am likely to experience some
internal conflict in that case.

2. I can allow only one aspect into my awareness.  Of course, the
other aspects will still be there - but I won't know about them.
The unconscious will probably then take on a disturbing aura as
perceived by me, but I will largely experience that as being a
series of bad things about the outside world.

There is the basic idea central within Jungian psychology, but in
the quoted text we see psychic energy mentioned in connection with
it.  Really of course it always is that way, as projection always
has an energy factor connected with it - withdraw projection and
recover lost energy or energy that is, at least in effect, leaking
away.  On the surface I might guess that some person or object in
the outside world is draining my energy.  From Jungian theory we
can rather speculate that the energy is associated with an aspect
of my own personality not connected with consciousness and so then
automatically projected away.  We can say that allowing it to come
into awareness will cause energy-generating conflict (some sort of
at least potential conflict must have caused me to deny it in the
first place) as the projection ends.  At the same time, we can say
that the newfound association with consciousness of the formerly
unconnected complex will just bring with it the energy of that
complex.  Maybe these two things both happen - maybe the newly
incorporated content brings energy just because it has energy, and
also because of the conflict it causes.  In any event, the process
begins with being introspective enough to recognize as an internal
object something formerly unconnected and probably projected.

So there we go - I am seemingly more or less "explaining away" the
old "mana" concept by claiming that energy loss or gain can be seen
as strictly internal psychological mechanics, and the outside world
then does not enter into it.  I think that is of some value.  And
reasonably rational.  However, speculations can be made about the
relationship between the unconscious and the outside world and then
the whole thing would start back up again in an interesting way.

"Symbolic images, such as the cross and the star, are
the language of the unconscious and are essential to its
self-expression. It is well known that pictures are a
very primitive form of language and are used to express
psychological shades of meaning that a rational account
could not impart. The conscious mind can learn to
interpret the meanings inherent in an image of this kind,
thus making contact between the surface of the psyche and
its depths, and raising the libido from the material to
the psychological level." --Eleanor Bertine

I don't know about the mana part, but it's a great quote.  Can you
give more information about the source (e.g., in a form that could be
cited in a bibliography; was this one of his titled seminars, for
example?  Does it appear in print?)

Back to the mana part, what I get from the quote is not so much that
accepting conflict gives you energy, but that it lets you achieve a
transcendent attitude towards the conflict.

However, I agree in general that conflict is potentially energizing.

Synchronistically, I was just writing about this today:   I see it as
analogous to a physics model--the ball and springs paradigm.  That is,
suppose you have a ball attached to two springs, left and right.  If
the springs are strong and taught, then the ball is, in a sense,
energized: a small push will make the ball to oscillate vigorously.
But if the springs are both weak or slack, then a push on the ball
won't have much effect at all.

I tend to view it in Pythagorean terms:  the mind or soul contains of
a variety of tensions of opposites.  The goal is not to eliminate the
tensions, but to harmonize them with each other.

Part of the idea, then, is to change the perspective from one of
conflict to one of constructive tension.

"This confrontation [with the unconscious] is the first test of courage on the
inner way, a test sufficient to frighten off most people, for the meeting with
ourselves belongs to the more unpleasant things that can be avoided so long as
we can project everything negative into the environment. But if we are able to
see our own shadow and can bear knowing about it, then a small part of the
problem has already been solved..." (Vol 9i, para 44)

"Both sides of [a] partisan conflict derive their energy from the same source,
the shared Self; but being unconscious of this they are condemned to live out
the conflict in their lives" (EGO AND ARCHETYPE, Edward F Edinger, pg 68)

"Consciousness as a spiritual principle has created a counterpole to natural,
instinctive animal function. Duality, dissociation and repression have been born
in the human psyche simultaneously with the birth of consciousness. This means
simply that consciousness in order to exist in its own right must, initially at
least, be antagonistic to the unconscious" (EGO AND ARCHETYPE, Edward F Edinger,
pg 20)

"It is the appropriate role of the ego to mediate between the opposing parties
of an intrapsychic conflict. If the ego identifies with one side of the
conflict, no resolution leading to wholeness is possible. The dissociation
becomes permanent" (EGO AND ARCHETYPE, Edward F Edinger, pg 137)

"When a primitive man is unable to think out a problem for himself, but has to
ask his tree, or his snake, or his fetish-object for advice, he is really
consulting a part of his psyche that is not located within himself but is found
only in projection to the tree or other object. Such an object is, of course,
taboo -- sacred dread -- and no one may injure it or even touch it without doing
serious damage to the man for whom it is sacred. In some cases the projection
has actually involved the man's soul or his life, so that if the tree should be
cut down the man himself would die. To us this seems like the crassest
superstition, but the same mechanism persists and is still effective among
civilized people, and we can even observe it in ourselves at times" (THE I AND
THE NOT I, by M Esther Harding, pg 181)

Mana itself is a projection.

"Mana [is that] invisible secret power that produces in a man awe, attraction,
and dread and so exerts an unconditioned influence over him...such an object is
numinous" (THE I AND THE NOT I, by M Esther Harding, pg 38)

"[A] mana-containing object has a superior wisdom and can tell him what to do in
times of doubt. That is to say, his thinking ability has not been developed as a
conscious function, but has remained as a potentiality in the unconscious and is
only experienced in the projection" (THE I AND THE NOT I, by M Esther Harding,
pg 39)
