I bought this bird feeder, hung it on my back porch and filled it with
wild bird seed. Within a week, we had hundreds of birds taking
advantage of the free and easily accessible food.

But then the birds started building nests in the boards of the patio.
above the table and next to the barbecue. Then came the poop. It was
everywhere, on the patio tiles, on the table and chairs, it was
everywhere.

Then some of the birds turned mean. They would dive bomb me on my head
and try to peck me, even though I had fed them out of my own pocket.
Then all the other birds got into the act. They would sit on that
feeder and squawked and screamed at all hours of the day and night! It
almost seemed that they were demanding I fill it when it got empty.

After a while, I couldn't even sit on my own porch or go into my
backyard. So I took down the bird feeder and in three days they were
all gone. I cleaned up their mess and took down all the nests they
built. Now my backyard and patio are back to normal, nice and quiet
and peacefull and no one is demanding a free meal anymore.

Now let me get this straight....
Our Government gives out free food, subsidised housing, free medical
care, free education and allows anyone born here in the U.S. to be an
automatic citizen.
Then the illegal's came by the tens of thousands. Suddenly our taxes
went up to pay for all the free services; small apartments are housing
5 or more families; you have to wait 5 hours to be seen by an
emergency room doctor; your child's 2nd grade class is behind other
schools because over half the class dosen't speak English; Corn Flakes
now come in a bilingual box; I have to press &quot;one&quot; to hear my bank
talk to me in English, and people waving flags other than &quot;Old Glory&quot;
are squawking and screaming in the streets demanding more rights and
free liberties!

Maybe, just maybe it's time for the government to take down the bird
feeder!

Now let me get this straight.

People have been walking north and south for thousands of years through
the region where the U.S. placed a border 160 years ago, and after
starting a war with Mexico so that we could steal half of Mexico fair
and square, and after selling subsidized corn in Mexico for cheaper than
we can grow it (thus driving farmers and farm hands out of work and off
the land), and given that these folks subsidize your food and housing by
working for less money than Americans are willing to work for, &quot;YOU&quot;
want to complain? Dios Mio!

Is this a natural condition or do you take stupid pill?

Thank God for Mexicans.

Billy it is very difficult for some folks to look at the larger
picture.  These days we get our info from corporate America.  Even if
our sensibilities incline wider understanding it can be lost in our
state propaganda.

A way out when our school curriculums  are driven by self centered
narrow minded  morons.  All I can say is &quot;treat your children well&quot;.

Best Bill who thinks of the factory as last resort.  Support local and
if you must work for the man make it a better place to be.

No sh*t, Sherlock.  They are territorial and/or protecting their nests
from would be predators (which you are).... you should see
hummingbirds in action.  Oh, man.  If they were any bigger, they'd be
scary!
