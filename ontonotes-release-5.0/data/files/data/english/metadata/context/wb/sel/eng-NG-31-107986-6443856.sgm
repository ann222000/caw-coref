Instead of using a wine thief to remove samples from
a carboy I've been lowering my hydrometer on a length
of fine sewing thread into the carboy. The thread is tightly
tied around the hydrometer but I'm wondering if anyone
has any better idea?

I switched to a refractometer for FG readings.  It needs to be corrected to
get the gravity reading from the brix reading, but it also takes just a few
drops of beer to figure things out.

For OG readings, I got one of those large wine thiefs with a wide enough
diameter to fit the hydrometer inside of it.  For whatever reason, the
general handling of that hasn't caused a busted hydrometer yet.

My better idea is not to worry so much about intermediate
gravity checks.  Unless you're having problems with sluggish
fermentation, just a bit of experience (and patience) will
let you know when your beer has fermented out.  In most
cases, letting it ferment in a primary fermenter until you
think it's done (7-10 days after fermentation kicks in for
"normal" ales), racking to a secondary fermenter to clear
(take a gravity reading here for reassurance), and letting
clear in the secondary should get you a fully-fermented beer.
IMO the "check gravity every day to make sure it's done"
advice is overkill, and opens up the batch to infection.

I disagree.  Checking it before you bottle is a lot more important
than checking it when you rack to the secondary.  If you open the batch
up to a significant infection risk just by checking the gravity, then
you've got bigger problems.  Unless you're an experienced brewer, checking
before you bottle is the only way you're going to know the difference
between a finished fermentation and a stuck one.  IMO, waiting X number of
days and just assuming it's done is bad advice.

The one thing I agree with is that "intermediate" gravity checks aren't
necessary.  IE, there's really no reason to check it while racking to
secondary.  The only time to check is at the end when you are trying to
determine if fermentation is complete.

I never take mid fermentation readings. At the end of fermentation why
not just take the sample from your bottling line? I usually take it
off the line to the conditioning keg or just wait till the kegs
conditioned and carbonated then take a sample and let it go flat.

A secondary fermenter should be used merely to let

to dry hop a beer.  The check at this point is to
ensure that has happened.  If fermentation has "stuck"
(something that is extremely rare if my 300+ batches

I recommend checking gravity at packaging time.

it takes many brew sessions to recognize whether
fermentation is taking place.  Perhaps a dozen times.

It depends on when you rack to secondary.  Many people rack with
some fermentation activity still present.  Stuck fermentations are
usually a lot more likely with beginning or intermediate brewers.  I'm
sure that it's going to be rare with both of us, but that's because we
understand a lot of the factors that go into ensuring a healthy fermentation.
Many of those factors are classic things that beginners struggle with.

There's a difference between no fermentation activity and a stuck
fermentation.  A stuck fermentation and a complete fermentation can
have visuallly identical signs.  Obviously if there were no fermentation
taking place, that would be easy to spot.

This is what I do. With a 3 gallon batch in a 5 gallon
carboy I don't feel there is enough CO2 generated
to guarantee that the 2 gallon air space will be
purged of oxygen. I wait until fermentation has
slowed significantly then rack to a 3 gallon carboy
to let it complete fermentation and then clear.
After that I will rack to a 5 gallon bucket with
priming sugar to bottle. At each rack I'll leave
some sludge behind. It's right before I bottle
that I check the FG.

As John mentioned I do it to ensure I don't have
a stuck fermentation. I did it once with a wine
kit and ended up putting in the potassium
metabisulphite at 1.010. It took me 4 months to
get the fermentation going again by aerating
and using hydrogen peroxide.

I had two 5 gal batches fermenting in a 14 Cubic foot
chest freezer (turned off) with a space heater to keep
it at fermenting temp.
After practically choking when leaning into the chest, I tried
lighting a match and lowering it into the chest. It went out
every time about 2" below the top lip.

I don't think that insufficient CO2 is really a problem.

3 lb test monofilament fish line. It's probably much easier to
properly sanitize. I used a prussik knot to attach it.

Nowadays, I used a two hole stopper which fits my sample
tube, with two small plastic hoses coming out of it. Sanitise
one of the hoses. Suck on the other to draw the sample into
the tube. Remove the stopper and drop in the hydrometer.
Drink sample.

At least you would have died amoungst friends :)

Suffocation is a different issue than oxidation, not
sure which is more serious. In the carboy the CO2
would have to uniformally push the O2 above it
and out the air lock to ensure no O2 remains to
oxidize the beer. I'm just not sure that it does,
more likely there's some air currents that allow
some O2 to remain especially considering the
amount of air space in the 5 gal carboy.

Transferring the wort to a 3 gal carboy solves
the problem due to the small air space.

It's just much easier to only disinfect a hydrometer than to
do a tall wine thief as well. With the thief I end up filling a
5 gallon pail and adding bleach, for a hydrometer I do it
right in the reading cylinder - a quick disinfect, string and all,

A hydrometer reading saved a batch for me last week.

I did a 10 gallon all grain "New Old Ale"
( http://northernbrewer.com/docs/kis-html/1503.html - had to substitute
priming sugar for dark Belgian candi sugar - was not shipped) which has
Wyeast #1084, Irish Ale yeast. Claims optimum ferment temp down to 62 F.
Brew day went fine, no problems.

I was able to chill it down to about 65 F (brewing in the garage in
winter heh) and put it downstairs, set the downstairs thermometer (we
have a bi-level) to 65 F and let it be for a week. After a week airlock
activity suggested it was just about done, so I set the thermostat on
its usual schedule (58 at night 63 during the day unless we are down
there, and I manually set it to 66-68). Anyhow, I keg my beers and have
as of late have been skipping secondary fermentation, just leaving it
in primary for 3 or so weeks and racking into the kegs. So, after three
or so weeks from brew day I get ready to keg. I notice that the beer
is more cloudy than I am used to. As I always do, I rack a glass to
taste as I fill the first keg - holy crap it's still way to sweet! I
take a hydro reading - 1.035 (down from 1.070 but still). Oh no, are
we stuck?? Change of plan time! I excise my kegged lagering Maibock
from the temp-controlled chest freezer (it's ready anyhow) and put the
2 cornies in the kegerator. I rack both old ales into secondary, wipe
out the inside of the freezer, drop 'em in there, and scrounge up my
portable aluminum clip-on utility light (takes one regular light bulb).
Put a 100 W bulb in it, switch the temperature controller to from cool
to heat, set it to 72 F, wrap both carboys in lots of towels to block
the light, close the lid, switch it on and cross my fingers.

I check the freezer a few hours later, temp is almost up to 70 (from 33
mind you).

Next day it's actively fermenting again - about one bloop every 10-20
seconds.

Now, I probably shocked the buggers a bit but I think it will be fine.
Had I kegged this beer, it would have been cloyingly sweet. So taking
a reading at kegging/bottling time is recommended. Sometimes I don't -
if it tastes fabulous out of primary I don't see the need except for
curiosity's sake. I am a somewhat lazy brewer :)

This is something that is often misunderstood.  While CO2 is heavier
than O2, the two gasses will mix completely.  That is, if you were to
take a bottle and fill the lower half with pure CO2 and the top half
with O2 and just let it sit (persumably at a temperature and pressure
where both were gas) you would end up with bottle whose contents had a
uniform compositon of 50% CO2 and 50% O2.

If you transfer while the wort is actively fermenting, while the
evolving CO2 will help purge any O2 that exists in the headspace, it
takes a long time (quite possibly longer than the fermentation will
last).  The Oxygen will also diffuse into the wort at the same time.
If the wort is actively fermenting, however, the yeast will metabolize
any O2 that actually makes its way into the wort, preventing
oxidation.  That is why, if I can't transfer it to the 2ndry while the
fermentation is still active, I just leave it alone.

&gt; takes a long time (quite possibly longer than the fermentation will
&gt; last).  The Oxygen will also diffuse into the wort at the same time.
&gt; If the wort is actively fermenting, however, the yeast will metabolize
&gt; any O2 that actually makes its way into the wort, preventing
&gt; oxidation.  That is why, if I can't transfer it to the 2ndry while the
&gt; fermentation is still active, I just leave it alone.

There's also the common misconception that an airlock keeps O2 out of the
fermenter, which isn't really true either.  The whole idea of a CO2 purge
or CO2 blanket protecting the beer, only pertains to short term storage.
Eventually O2 will get back in, and as you say it will mix evenly with
the CO2.

Quick question: I have generally been pouring my wort on top of yeast
cake -- will the OG be skewed due to the yeast present in the wort?

Maybe a little (theoretically), but nothing significant.  We don't need a
super accurate OG reading anyway.

&gt;&gt;I for one don't understand what the problem is with using a wine
&gt;&gt;thief. If you are worried about introducing infection, then (a) you
&gt;&gt;ought to be more careful, and (b) introducing the hydrometer into the
&gt;&gt;carboy certainly isn't a step in the right direction. The idea of
&gt;&gt;putting the hydrometer in the wine thief is interesting, but that
&gt;&gt;sounds like asking for an infection to me, notwithstanding my earlier
&gt;&gt;comment :-)

&gt; It's just much easier to only disinfect a hydrometer than to
&gt; do a tall wine thief as well. With the thief I end up filling a
&gt; 5 gallon pail and adding bleach, for a hydrometer I do it
&gt; right in the reading cylinder - a quick disinfect, string and all,
&gt; and you lower it into the carboy for a reading. Done.

&gt; Sounds like I'm sticking with the string. Good enough.

Go to Lowe's or some other home improvement store (but not home depot,
they don't carry it) and get a water tray for pre-pasted wallpaper. It
only holds about a gallon and a half to 2 gallons and my wine thief fits
into it. I use it for other things was well, like my big stir spoon
among other things.
