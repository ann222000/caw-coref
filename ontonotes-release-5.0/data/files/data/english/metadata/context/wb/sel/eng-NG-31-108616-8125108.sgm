Curved Spacetime Local Quantum Field Theory Meets Epstein-Glaser
http://federation.g3z.com/Physics/QG2007_2.pdf

which describes the evolution and morphing of the whole Epstein-Glaser
paradigm, ending with the recent contribution by Brunetti and
Fredenhagen in the 2007 Quantum Gravity book from Birkhauser.

Some excerpts:

1. Perturbative Quantum Field Theory a' la Epstein-Glaser
1.1. Background
The Brunetti and Fredenhagen article is a recent one in a long chain
of articles from what may be described as the &quot;Zurich school&quot;. One of
its earliest prologues had been Bogoliubov, himself, as far back as
the 1950's. Eventually in the 1970's, Epstein and Glaser introduced a
new method for treating the infinities in the perturbation expansion
of quantum field theory that avoided, at the outset, the infinities
seen in loop integrals. The method came into prominence when Scharf
(at ETH) entered the field in the 1980's and 1990's.

The method of infinity-avoidance is technical, rather than one which
entails the introduction of new physics, and so is normally classified
as a renormalization technique, rather than as a solution to the
ultraviolet divergence problem. It does not actually construct closed-
form operator solutions for the equations governing interacting
quantum fields, but only series expansions. More significantly: it
does not address the question of why (or whether) the field
quantities, or the Green's functions they are derived from, need to be
distributional in the first place. For that is the ultimate origin of
the ultraviolet divergences both in classical and quantum field
theory. It doesn't even address the ultraviolet divergence problem in
classical field theory from which the divergence problem in quantum
field theory ultimately arose.

Essentially, what the method does is that, by more careful handling of
the distributional mathematics associated with the singular
&quot;operators&quot; that define quantum fields, and more careful hair-
splitting, the poles seen in the divergent integrals resulting from
the usual series expansions can be avoided before they are even
encountered. The cost of doing so, however, is ambiguity: the
resulting effective Lagrangian is defined only up to undetermined
coefficients for those counter-terms that would have otherwise been
required by renormalization to cover up the infinity.

In later times (the 1990's), other renormalization techniques closer
to the idea of taking &quot;principal parts&quot; of distributions arose,
notably including differential renormalization, which is an equivalent
of Epstein-Glaser.

What all this amounts to is that the primary error of methods based on
the Wick expansion is noted: the Wick expansion only gives you
contractions for pairs, which may be thought of as the terms needed to
handle 1-on-1 coincidences or collisions. However, this does not
complete the picture: one should also have contractions for triples,
quadruples and so on.

1.2. Causality and Localized Interactions
The principle used to generate the recursive expansion goes back to
Bogoliubov and predecessors. The time-ordering operator is no longer
defined explicitly in terms of distributional functions, like the Q
function, but through the causality principle. Though a more complex
version of this principle had been used by Bogoliubov, and though most
people working on this approach have specifically tied it to the
Smatrix of a perturbation theory, in fact the principle transcends all
these contexts. Where it is used in this context, the S-matrix serves
as nothing more than a device for defining a generating function such
as the function A e seen in the cumulant expansion.

(Mathematics contained therein)

The essential relation to locality enters the picture here. If one
thinks of the interaction as a generating function, then the
coefficients of the terms involved in /I (which is normally taken as a
polynomial) serve as multipliers which may be used modulate the
interaction. In this way, one can localize the interaction and then
apply the causality principle to factor the S-matrix.

In particular, for a foliation, one obtains a product of S-matrices,
each one describing the interaction local between two leaves of the
foliation. The essential idea behind &quot;shutting off&quot; the interaction at
the boundary has nothing per se to do with any physics of actually
shutting off an interaction. What's actually being expressed here is
that each region can be considered in its own right, independently of
how it may be embedded in the larger manifold comprising spacetime.
Consequently, it is as if the interaction could be turned off at the
boundary of the region, since one of the potential embeddings of the
region could be into a larger spacetime where no interaction occurs
outside the region. Since everything is supposed to be independent of
the embedding, then it follows that the boundary of the region should
be parametrized by
the states corresponding to a free field.

However, there is a crucial distinction with the usual approach taken
in perturbation theory: no descent to positive and negative infinity
(and no mass gap issue or infrared divergence) is involved here. The
regions can all be compact. Instead, one is dealing with a finite
version of perturbation theory, where the &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; states are
simply those associated with the starting and ending foliation leaves
bounding the region of interest.

So, at the foundation of the causal Epstein-Glaser approach lies the
kernel of an idea (and interpretation) for an entirely different
approach to quantum field theory that potentially even transcends its
historical origins from perturbation theory. The na√Øve interpretation
of Epstein-Glaser within existing formalisms (e.g. LZW) leads only to
confusion and misunderstanding on the true nature and power of this
general method.

Apparently, this is the direction Brunetti and Fredenhagen have been
taking in recent years, as evidenced by their article which this
commentary is in reference to.

However... there is one source that has been on my mind for a long
time which appears to be nothing less than the classical analogue of
Epstein-Glaser. Barut's 1964/1980 reference on classical field theory
treats classical renormalization theory in section 4. The method he
uses is essentially the same distribution-splitting method used by
Epstein-Glaser.

Some other key points in further excerpts from the article referenced
before:

1.3. Clamping Down On The Ambiguity via Quantized Gauge Invariance
By the 1980's, the still little-known Epstein-Glaser technique was
planted on the map by Gunter Scharf's Finite Electromagnetism, which
advanced the idea that Epstein-Glaser is, indeed, an infinity-avoiding
technique... The one additional, but little-noted, element that Scharf
had introduced was a general method for actually DETERMINING the
structure or even values of the ambiguous counter-terms. In a 1995
update to his Finite
Electromagnetism, this idea was elaborated on much further, where the
beginnings of a whole new
methodology for actually constructing a Lagrangian for a field theory
was developed. In the process, much
of the methodology associated with renormalization theory
(renormalization group, Ward identities,
anomalies, etc.) was fit within this framework.

2. Locally Covariant Quantum Field Theory
2.1. The Holy Grail of Epstein-Glaser
If a perturbative gauge invariance principle can be used to clamp down
on a finite set of counter-terms,
such as would be encountered in a renormalizable theory; can it also
be used to clamp down on an infinite
set of counter-terms, even constructing a well-defined effective
Lagrangian for nonrenormalizable
theories? In fact, with such theories you can actually grow a
Lagrangian out of a simple core, if the
quantum Noether principle or other similar principle can be
effectively used in this way. This would
implement the deWitt(?) construction of the Einstein-Hilbert
Lagrangian.

The Holy Grail of the whole Epstein-Glaser enterprise is to construct
Quantum Gravity this way.
