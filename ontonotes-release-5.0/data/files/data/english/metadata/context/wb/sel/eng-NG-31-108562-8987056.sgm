Question: Will the set come on in service mode and display the service data?
If so then you may be having a problem in the Zero Crossover section of the
power control circuits.

Mike:
D647, D690, &amp; Q605 all have caused issues in the ZCO circuit causing 9
Blink. E_Mail me for files from bulletin. A/J

Hi. Can I get the file too. I want to fix this problem but I don't
know how to do it. Techs charge me around 300 bucks to fix this. I
prefer fix it myself than paying that amount cuz i can buy with 200
bucks more a HDTV .

Did you call Sony service, or go to a small private dealer?  Try calling
Sony service.

There may be a problem with the EPROM, which is part of the uPC. You
would not have the set-up at home to reprogram it. There is calibrations
and specific parameters involved. Each TV set has its particular
characteristics that have to be set up.

I had one of those sets that gave me fits for days. It had a bad diode
(D647 off T603 pin 7 on the A board) in the zero cross detector circuit and I
got the 9 blinks and nothing else. I could power the set by jumpering the power
relay and pressing power on (shutdown within 2 seconds), so I knew most of it
was working. The diode didn't test bad but it made the zero cross pulses
&quot;jitter&quot; and the micro couldn't read it properly. Any old power diode worked,
but I put in an ECG506 anyway.
When I inquired about the problem (before I fixed it), I was told to check
or just resolder Q605, Q606, D690, Q691 and to check the ZCD and standby
circuits. They were all OK. I have the schematic in .pdf format, by the way.
I'll not send that unless you ask first... it's a big'un.

Now, the blink codes and what they mean (didn't help me any). Some of this info
can help you destroy your TV if you mess up. 'Nuff said...

Many of the later model Sony TV’s have a built in self-diagnosis function. If
the timer/standby indicator is blinking, this could be an indication of a
problem with the unit. The diagnostic blinking will occur automatically with no
action required by you to engage it.

The timing of the blinking you see would be as follows: two to nine blinks,
(depending on the fault), about a third of a second apart, then a pause for 3
seconds, then the two to nine blinks about a third of a second apart again.

Here is a list of the problems that might have occurred indicated by the number
of blinks. The words in parentheses are those, which you will see for each of
these faults on a diagnosis screen described later in this article.

* Unit is dead, No blinks - Problem in the standby power section. Might
check fuse, R607, Q601, IC601, R612 and VDR601 (should show open).

* Continuous blink once a second, no pausing - No reply from the jungle
IC301 (data bus is busy, shorted to ground, or held high), IK video path is
defective.

* One blink - not used for the self-diagnosis

* Two blinks - B+ over current protection (OCP), unit goes to the standby
mode then displays the 2 blink fault. Could be a short in the power supply of
any of the circuits.

* Three blinks - B+ over voltage protection (OVP), unit goes to the standby
mode then displays the 3 blink fault. This is also a problem in the power supply
circuit, check T603 and R672.

* Four blinks - No vertical Deflection (V STOP), Screen goes to a single
horizontal line then the video signal muted. Check IC1509, Q1505

* Five blinks - AKB circuit (automatic kine bias), the timer/standby
indicator blinks for about 30 seconds then goes to the self-diagnosis function.
Something is wrong with the video. Check video out, Q705, 732, 761 and other
components on the Cboard, also check Q218, 219, 220 on the A board. In addition,
unit could be in IK blanking, try turning up screen slightly.

* Six blinks - No Horizontal (H STOP), no raster, goes to the blinking
self-diagnosis function immediately. Check C515 &amp; 516 and the jungle IC, IC206.

* Seven blinks - High voltage shutdown. The high voltage has exceeded 33k
and the unit goes immediately into safety shutdown. Check power supply
regulation and horizontal circuits.

* Eight blinks - Problem with the audio (AUDIO), unit goes to standby and
blinks the self-diagnosis code. Check IC406 audio amp, PS401, and 402.

* Nine blinks - Panel Module Error or Thermal Error. If it is intermittent 9
blinks, meaning sometimes the TV comes on and other times you get flashing, then
change the switching regulator. Make sure the part number is -12 or -13.

Intermittent problems? This is a great feature. You can also bring up these
fault codes on-screen to see a list of the problem numbers with the abbreviation
of the problem and the number of times this problem has occurred. This is
slightly different than entering the service mode. To see the diagnostic screen,
press the following buttons: Display, Channel, 5, volume Minus, ( not plus )
then Power. This brings up a screen with a list of the problems and number of
times they have occurred. Each of the problems named, are abbreviated as, &quot;OCP&quot;,
&quot;OVP&quot;, &quot;V STOP&quot;, ETC. We have repeated them in parentheses in the text for the
&quot;Blinks&quot; described above so you can correlate between the diagnostic screen and
the blink codes.

Now that you know about these self-diagnostics, how do you use them? Say that
you have a set with a black screen. You see that the LED is blinking four times.
This would tell you that you have no vertical sweep, which is why the video is
muted. If it was blinking 6 times, you would know that you have a horizontal
fault. It's not a sure cure..

IMPORTANT: After you repair the unit, you MUST clear the values on this
diagnostic screen. These codes do not reset themselves after the fault is
corrected, so if you don't clear them, you'll be seeing &quot;old&quot; fault codes the
next time you enter this screen. Clearing is done by going into the service mode
(display, channel, 5, volume plus, then power ). Press 8 and Enter, which
returns everything to the factory preset condition.
