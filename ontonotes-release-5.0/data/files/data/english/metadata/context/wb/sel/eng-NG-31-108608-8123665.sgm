Yesterday I created a directory of important and/or informative papers
in GR. I have also included the best of the free standard reference
materials. The title of the directory is General Relativity Directory
- Everything Important.

http://www.everythingimportant.org/relativity/general.htm

One category, last but not least, is Flat Spacetime Theories that are
Empirically Indistinguishable from General Relativity. I wish that
everyone could understand why this category is important. If you are
aware of any other papers that fit in this very interesting but
despised and neglected category, please let me know.

Do you really mean &quot;empirically indistinguishable from general relativity&quot;
or do you mean &quot;consistent with the evidence so far&quot;? I'm pretty sure that
discovering that the universe had nontrivial topology would falsify those
theories but not general relativity.

The second paper in the first section is basically nonsense, as I've said
before:

Message-ID: &lt;db3gu1$pc ... @gemini.csx.cam.ac.uk&gt;

In fact, my opinion of most of the papers in that section is just as low.
Where they're not outright wrong, they're stating the obvious at a length
which makes me think the authors don't understand why it's obvious.

Hi math wizard. Look at &quot;Holographic Principle&quot; where information
contents in 4D spacetime can be modeled on 2D surface so
that's about the flatest you can have... lol.. see:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle

&quot;The holographic principle is a speculative conjecture
about quantum gravity theories, proposed by Gerard 't
Hooft and improved and promoted by Leonard Susskind,
claiming that all of the information contained in a volume
of space can be represented by a theory which lives
in the boundary of that region. In other words, if you
have a room, you can model all of the events within
that room by creating a theory which only takes into
account what happens in the walls of the room.&quot;

I meant &quot;consistent with the evidence so far&quot;. Thank you. I changed
the heading to read, &quot;Flat Spacetime Theories that are Empirically
Indistinguishable from Testable General Relativity&quot;. Please correct me
again if I'm still wrong. Would it be clearer if I chanced the heading
to say, &quot;Flat Spacetime Theories that are Consistent with all

You are right of course, but, as I understand it, observations up till
now still indicate nothing inconsistent with a trivial topology and a
flat space.

And I still agree with you. However, my point is the importance of the
topic in the hierarchy of elementary spacetime models, not the clumsy
manner or the confusion of physicists when they try to explain
childishly simple concepts.

I couldn't agree with you more. My interest in that topic is from the
observation that many physicists are not aware of the new and
elementary conclusions that arise when trying to conceptualize special
relativity on a circle universe. It's like no one coming up with the
pole and the barn paradox until the 1950s. There is something very
wrong here. I believe that the spacetime SxR is even easier to
understand than ordinary special relativity in one spatial dimension.
I can't imagine why a simple study of this spacetime is not included
in elementary textbooks. I also can't imagine why physicists are
generally so confused about the childishly simple implications of
nonstandard clock synchronization schemes. I look forward to the day
when all these simple things that physicists now obfuscate or
misunderstand will be taught at the high school level.

It is neither despised or neglected, it is simply an unsuccessful way
of doing things.

BTW: You need more than an agreement with weak field predictions. The
weak field limit is flat space with a small perturbation so finding a
flat space theory that agrees with GR in the weak field limit isn't
surprising.

Finding one that meshes with strong field predictions [rotating black
holes, for example] would be more interesting.

there have been a number of theories formulated
that provide gravity in flat spacetimes

a number of quantisation programmes do this where gravity becomes just another field

however
one of the more clever techniques has been that of &quot;analogue gravity&quot;
which takes as its starting point interpretations of gravity
as fluid flow equations on a flat background

To disprove the myth that gravity must be spacetime curvature and that

Why is it all your attempts to play with physics are geared towards
destruction? Everything you do is an attempt to quash some sort of
imagined &quot;myth&quot; in physics.

While you are moving your armada of ignorance in position to attack
GR, you might want to consider the fact that you know even less about
GR than you do SR. There are a few people here who know enough about
GR to argue with you about it, and I'm one of them.

I simply cannot wait to hear your misconceptions! Will your
misunderstandings be something I've seen a dozen times before, or will
you misunderstand something simple in a new and interesting way? I
can't wait to find out! Remember shooby, you are entertainment. Don't
allow the illusion that you are doing good physics to take hold,
otherwise the crippling depression that will land upon you after a
decade of spewing on USENET might drive you to swallow the 9mm pill.

You self-study SR and GR. What books did you use? I found out
there's a difference when one discusses it with GR wizards
because it would clear up many misconceptions.

Anyway. For a start. You must read Clifford book &quot;Was Einstein
Right? Putting General Relativity to the Tests&quot;, Wheeler &quot;A
Journey into Gravity and Spacetime&quot;, etc. However, if you'd
tell me you have read such book as Wald &quot;General Relativity&quot;
and understood everything then I salute you.

About flat spacetime theory. Well. It's just that our rulers
measure the curvature so even if spacetime is really
flat and there are gravitons. Calculations show that
it produces curved spacetime as a classical limit,
something like that. So it seems there is no way
we can tell if spacetime is really curved or just appear
curved.

I just found SR and GR to be amazing. Years ago.
I thought they are just mathematical concepts without
relevance to reality. But stuff by Lee Smolin and
company teaches one how to think of it physically
and the effect is like poetry. That is, the beauty of
GR is like poetry, one has to appreciate it.

Of course I'd be equally glad if I'm just a victim
of relativity hypnotists and Pentcho is the King
of Physics who dislodge Einstein :)

I wonder if Shubee even read an SR book or just self study it
by reading wikipedia. Well. I really want to understand how
he thinks there is an absolute frame when SR is anti-absolute
frame. Maybe he sees something we don't? There's this
Wheeler book called &quot;Spacetime Physics&quot; that people
recommended before but I didn't get it. I finally got it a while
ago after reading the following review.

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/0716723271/sr=8-1/q...

&quot;The aim of this book is to explain to one the essential
of the theory of special relativity: The GEOMETRY of
spacetime! Keyword: GEOMETRY. Those who give
this book one or two stars because they think this
book is too wordy or does not retain enough rigor
simply do not see the simplicity and elegance in
the authors' presentation.
Yes. You don't see complicated equations in this
book because the ideas are, as I said, geometric.
The authors even tell the reader not to pay too
much attention to things like the Lorentz transformation
because it conceals the intuitive geometric ideas.
Everything in speical relativity can be done
without appealing to any local coordinate frames
because spacetime IS geometry, the quantities
we are interested in are inheritedly covariant.
This is all built into the theory of relavity.
And the paradoxes that arise when one first
studies the subject can all be expalined by the
relativity of simultaneity, which is again because
space or time alone is not covariant but spacetime
as a whole.
This book gives a concrete meaning to spacetime.
Things like 4-vectors are not just something
the physicists cook up to make their equations
look better on paper; They have their very own existence.
As for the nontechnical language used in the book,
I would have to say that any bright high school students
can learn from this book.

I hope Shubee would own this book too so he can be
acquainted with the common sense of SR and can
attack it at its turf if he still sees there is a problem
with it. Without serious reading. Shubee would spend
another decade here like Seto who has already more than
a decade giving the same arguments that the book
can easily refute. But I guess Shubee is much better
than Seto, isn't it.

Of course they are.  There is no known way to tell the difference between a
theory where space-time is curved or rulers and clocks behave as if it was
curved.  This has been known since the time of Riemann.  So?

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in GR. I have also included the best of the free standard reference
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; materials. The title of the directory is General Relativity Directory
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; - Everything Important.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.everythingimportant.org/relativity/general.htm

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One category, last but not least, is Flat Spacetime Theories that are
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Empirically Indistinguishable from General Relativity. I wish that
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone could understand why this category is important. If you are
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; aware of any other papers that fit in this very interesting but
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; despised and neglected category, please let me know.

&gt;&gt; &gt; It is neither despised or neglected, it is simply an unsuccessful way
&gt;&gt; &gt; of doing things.

&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW: You need more than an agreement with weak field predictions. The
&gt;&gt; &gt; weak field limit is flat space with a small perturbation so finding a
&gt;&gt; &gt; flat space theory that agrees with GR in the weak field limit isn't
&gt;&gt; &gt; surprising.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Finding one that meshes with strong field predictions [rotating black
&gt;&gt; &gt; holes, for example] would be more interesting.

&gt;&gt; To disprove the myth that gravity must be spacetime curvature and that
&gt;&gt; this curvature has been measured directly, it suffices to construct a
&gt;&gt; consistent flat-spacetime theory that passes all the tests that have
&gt;&gt; been applied to general relativity.

&gt; You self-study SR and GR. What books did you use? I found out
&gt; there's a difference when one discusses it with GR wizards
&gt; because it would clear up many misconceptions.

&gt; Anyway. For a start. You must read Clifford book &quot;Was Einstein
&gt; Right? Putting General Relativity to the Tests&quot;, Wheeler &quot;A
&gt; Journey into Gravity and Spacetime&quot;, etc. However, if you'd
&gt; tell me you have read such book as Wald &quot;General Relativity&quot;
&gt; and understood everything then I salute you.

Wald is THE book to learn about GR IMHO.  Difficult - yes - but well worth
it.

&gt; About flat spacetime theory. Well. It's just that our rulers
&gt; measure the curvature so even if spacetime is really
&gt; flat and there are gravitons. Calculations show that
&gt; it produces curved spacetime as a classical limit,
&gt; something like that. So it seems there is no way
&gt; we can tell if spacetime is really curved or just appear
&gt; curved.

&gt; I just found SR and GR to be amazing. Years ago.
&gt; I thought they are just mathematical concepts without
&gt; relevance to reality. But stuff by Lee Smolin and
&gt; company teaches one how to think of it physically
&gt; and the effect is like poetry. That is, the beauty of
&gt; GR is like poetry, one has to appreciate it.

&gt; Of course I'd be equally glad if I'm just a victim
&gt; of relativity hypnotists and Pentcho is the King
&gt; of Physics who dislodge Einstein :)

Yes, it is a despised and neglected category because of the multiple
myths and mistakes promoted during decades by relativists.

You can read below a message from Eric with something like:

&quot;BTW: You need more than an agreement with weak field predictions.
The
weak field limit is flat space with a small perturbation so finding a
flat space theory that agrees with GR in the weak field limit isn't
surprising.&quot;

Which is completely wrong.

The confusion that a flat spacetime theory is valid only in the weak
limit is one of the spreaded myths by relativists. Currently that myth
is spreaded by Baez, Hillman, Carlip, and other well-known flammers.

Fortunately, this myth begins to be corrected in last literature.

Your list of gravitational theories lacks the more popular
contributions. One is telleparallel gravity, where gravity is modelled
in a flat spacetime. Gravity is not curvature but a real force like
electromagnetism.

The scheme is

Non-metric theories --&gt; metric theories --&gt; (Curvature OR torsion)

Now when choosing the metric procedure, you can select different
spaces. If you select a classical Riemannian structure you get
curvature and GR. If you select teleparallelism then you get
telleparallel gravity, where the geometric interpretation is not
curvature but torsion. Of course, this modelling of gravity is valid
beyond the weak limit.

Telleparallel gravity is being actively under research now because let
the 'unification' with rest of forces and spin can be included in the
torsion metric structure (which is useful for quantum gravity
studies).

Other great theory is Feynman field theory. Here also gravity is
modelled like the rest of forces and is being advanced in recent
years. Here gravity is a field propagates over a background. In some
sense Feynman approach is the basis for current superstring theory.

However, both approaches, field and metric (either torsion or
curvature), are limited in the description of gravitational phenomena.
For an alternative theory see relativistic gravitational theory i
cited in a new micro-thought (see the message &quot;Relativistic Lagrangian
and limitations of field theory&quot; but wait for the second part).

This is the scheme, maybe you could use in your site instead
presenting the theories in flat.

Note: Maybe Stefanovich disagrees with this classification for his
theory. I do not know where clasify the analoge gravity models cited
by the other poster, Some of them may be probably listed under the
field approach because the field is substituted by some other
continuum model. They inherit limitations of the field model.

Note: Gravity is not a force in GR but gravity *IS* a proper force in
the other formulations. This may confuss many students and laymen. I
wait the myth &quot;gravity is curvature&quot; (e.g. Wald) to be eliminated from
textbooks in some decades. The geometric formulation is useful but is
neither fundamental nor complete.

Note: It is ironic that the more un-promising way to model gravity is
precisely the more popular today: General Relativity. The Feynmann
approach is very promising for unifications tasks but is based in
fields and, therefore, limited.

Hi Eugene, i see obligate to explain this a bit (you know).

The above scheme is helpful for understanding what are the theoretical
foundations basis for each theory.

In no way i suggest each theory to be in the same basis. Even
teleparallel theory sometimes named an equivalent of general
relativity by different authors is in some sense an extension of GR
because can introduce spin.

I know that you have worked only up to c^2 terms. Feynman theory has
been worked beyond, including the test of binaries, which you still do
not reproduce in the theory because you avoided radiation phenomena in
your first approach.

However, your introduction of a non-retarded component in the
potential energy is an interesting feature where your theory goes
beyond that of Feynman (and the others). You can embrace a kind of
gravitational version of the Chubykalo et al. electromagnetic dualism
(i think you know).

a compact spatial dimension. Such topology allows two twin observers
to remain inertial yet meet periodically. The paradox is resolved by
considering the relationship of each twin to a preferred inertial
reference frame which exists in such a universe because global Lorentz
invariance is broken. The twins can perform &quot;global&quot; experiments to
determine their velocities with respect to the preferred reference
frame (by sending light signals around the cylinder, for instance).&quot;

I kept that first part and removed the rest from
http://www.everythingimportant.org/relativity/general.htm

&quot;Here we discuss the possibility of doing so with local experiments.
Since one spatial dimension is compact, the electrostatic field of a
point charge deviates from $1/r^2$. We show that although the
functional form of the force law is the same for all inertial
observers, as required by local Lorentz invariance, the deviation from
1/r2 is observer-dependent. In particular, the preferred observer
measures the largest field strength for fixed distance from the
charge.&quot;

able to find earlier references by looking at the literature section.
I am interested to know if existence of black holes is an

a connection that converts the connection to/from one with either
(1) 0 curvature, non-zero torsion
(2) 0 torsion, non-zero curvature
(3) just about any combination of the two you want
The transformation involves a system of partial differential equations
whose compatibility requirement is just the first and second Bianchi

This shows that torsion is just a fancy way of expressing curvature.
So it still counts, when the torsion is not zero; and the

&gt; &gt; You can read below a message from Eric with something like:

&gt; &gt; &quot;BTW: You need more than an agreement with weak field predictions.

&gt; &gt; limit is one of the spreaded myths by relativists. Currently that myth
&gt; &gt; is spreaded by Baez, Hillman, Carlip, and other well-known flammers.

&gt; &gt; Fortunately, this myth begins to be corrected in last literature.

&gt; &gt; Your list of gravitational theories lacks the more popular
&gt; &gt; contributions. One is telleparallel gravity, where gravity is modelled
&gt; &gt; in a flat spacetime. Gravity is not curvature but a real force like
&gt; &gt; electromagnetism.

&gt; &gt; The scheme is

&gt; &gt; Non-metric theories --&gt; metric theories --&gt; (Curvature OR torsion)

&gt; &gt; Now when choosing the metric procedure, you can select different
&gt; &gt; spaces. If you select a classical Riemannian structure you get
&gt; &gt; curvature and GR. If you select teleparallelism then you get
&gt; &gt; telleparallel gravity, where the geometric interpretation is not
&gt; &gt; curvature but torsion. Of course, this modelling of gravity is valid
&gt; &gt; beyond the weak limit.

&gt; &gt; Telleparallel gravity is being actively under research now because let
&gt; &gt; the 'unification' with rest of forces and spin can be included in the
&gt; &gt; torsion metric structure (which is useful for quantum gravity
&gt; &gt; studies).

&gt; &gt; Other great theory is Feynman field theory. Here also gravity is
&gt; &gt; modelled like the rest of forces and is being advanced in recent
&gt; &gt; years. Here gravity is a field propagates over a background. In some
&gt; &gt; sense Feynman approach is the basis for current superstring theory.

&gt; &gt; However, both approaches, field and metric (either torsion or
&gt; &gt; curvature), are limited in the description of gravitational phenomena.
&gt; &gt; For an alternative theory see relativistic gravitational theory i
&gt; &gt; cited in a new micro-thought (see the message &quot;Relativistic Lagrangian
&gt; &gt; and limitations of field theory&quot; but wait for the second part).

&gt; &gt; References:

&gt; &gt; http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0011087

&gt; &gt; http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0264-9381/21/22/011

&gt; &gt; http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9912003

&gt; This is the scheme, maybe you could use in your site instead
&gt; presenting the theories in flat.

&gt;           |                 | Field (Feynman)
&gt;           | Non-geometric  -|
&gt;           |                 | AAAD (Stefanovich)

&gt;           | Geometric  - |
&gt;           |              | Riemannian (General Relativity)

&gt; Note: Maybe Stefanovich disagrees with this classification for his
&gt; theory. I do not know where clasify the analoge gravity models cited
&gt; by the other poster, Some of them may be probably listed under the
&gt; field approach because the field is substituted by some other
&gt; continuum model. They inherit limitations of the field model.

&gt; Note: Gravity is not a force in GR but gravity *IS* a proper force in
&gt; the other formulations. This may confuss many students and laymen. I
&gt; wait the myth &quot;gravity is curvature&quot; (e.g. Wald) to be eliminated from
&gt; textbooks in some decades. The geometric formulation is useful but is
&gt; neither fundamental nor complete.
">

Is it possible the &quot;gravity is curvature&quot; myth is just a veil or decoy
to hide something. &quot;Gravity is curvature&quot; is the only one that
doesn't allow anti-gravity because we are led to believe in
eternal motion in geodesic path proportional to time. So the
only way to stop geodesic path is to stop time which is
impossible. If gravity is some kind of force. Then it is possible.
Could the other models of gravity permit anti-gravity?

It is possible Einstein GR is just a coincident it was correct.
Later when the Nazi developed anti-gravity machines
and the US stealing them and created Area 51 to
study the technology. United States continued to promote
GR so that no one would suspect anti-gravity propulsion
are already being developed and deployed by the US
in clandestine operations.

Go for it Shubee! Expose the cover-up and you will be
our next Einstein (or his official replacement).

Plenty of experimental evidence for bodies that obey most known

Hi Eric,

thank you for the references. These seems to be high quality works.
However, you would possibly agree with me that they do not offer 100%
proofs. So, there still remains some room for scepticism. On the other
hand, there is no proof that non-geometrical theories of gravity
cannot explain properties of black holes, should they be firmly
established. So, they are not ruled out yet.

Eugene.

They won't, Eugene. We've been over this before.
You start your argument by  using a Newtonian potential in your
Hamiltonian (eq 8).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From (8) you get equation of motion (11) that you later on find to

&quot;contradict&quot; PoE (eq 26). Surprise! Surprise!
GR doesn't use Newtonian potentials (for a good reason), so you didn't
find a contradiction with PoE, you have simply constructed a self-
contradictory theory, your very own. Any decent editor will continue
to reject your paper.

Besides , how can you claim that your theory is indistinguishable from
GR when your very math (eq.26) attempts (unsuccessfully) to falsify
PoE. Didn't you know that there are plenty of experiments that verify
PoE? You always have experiments quotes ready, how could you miss such
an important one?

Well, when the non-geometrical theories of gravitation make a
prediction that a) differs from GR and b) can be tested, we will talk
about them. Until then, they can sit in the corner.

&gt; &gt; You can embrace a kind of

&gt; Yes, I find Chubykalo's ideas very similar to mine. He also has the
&gt; benefit of being able to test his ideas in experiments. Do you have
&gt; any comments on the paper http://www.arxiv.org/physics/0601084which

I knew but did not check the results because i want first to derive
dualism from microscopic theory instead postulating it to work on any
EM phenomena as Chubikalo and Smirnov-Rueda did.

Probably experimental work is right. But i dislike the v&gt;c and the
v=infinity you can read during the paper. No-retardation does *not*
implies v&gt;c. This is impossible to grasp when working directly with
the macroscopic Maxwell equations. Precisely, that is one of reasons
which are trying to derive dualism from microscopic theory.

Also new non-local understanding about magnetic fields has been
experimentally verified in other situations Marinov motor and AB
effects. Relativists are still trying to derive the experimental
outcomes.

Another situation where the retarded potentials fail experimental test
is cited in http://canonicalscience.blogspot.com/

Take a look to recent http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1661 also.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday I created a directory of important and/or informative papers

&gt; &gt; &gt; - Everything Important.

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.everythingimportant.org/relativity/general.htm

&gt; &gt; &gt; One category, last but not least, is Flat Spacetime Theories that are
&gt; &gt; &gt; Empirically Indistinguishable from General Relativity. I wish that
&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone could understand why this category is important. If you are
&gt; &gt; &gt; aware of any other papers that fit in this very interesting but
&gt; &gt; &gt; despised and neglected category, please let me know.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Shubee

&gt; &gt; Yes, it is a despised and neglected category because of the multiple
&gt; &gt; myths and mistakes promoted during decades by relativists.

&gt; Once again you try to frame the debate by using the word &quot;relativists&quot;
&gt; in the pejorative form.

&gt; &gt; You can read below a message from Eric with something like:

&gt; &gt; &quot;BTW: You need more than an agreement with weak field predictions.
&gt; &gt; The
&gt; &gt; weak field limit is flat space with a small perturbation so finding a
&gt; &gt; flat space theory that agrees with GR in the weak field limit isn't
&gt; &gt; surprising.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Which is completely wrong.

&gt; &gt; The confusion that a flat spacetime theory is valid only in the weak
&gt; &gt; limit is one of the spreaded myths by relativists. Currently that myth
&gt; &gt; is spreaded by Baez, Hillman, Carlip, and other well-known flammers.

&gt; I love how someone with no formal education in physics walks by and
&gt; shits all over three people who have Doctorates in physics.

&gt; Read what I said _very carefully_, because like I have told you
&gt; before: reading is fundamental.

&gt; I said the WEAK FIELD LIMIT - not *all flat space theories*. Finding a
&gt; flat space theory that agrees with the weak field limit is NOT
&gt; difficult because the weak field limit _IS_ a flat space theory.

&gt; &gt; Fortunately, this myth begins to be corrected in last literature.

&gt; The &quot;myth&quot; doesn't exist. The only confusion is in your head.

&gt; You are encouraged to find flat space theories that mesh with GR in
&gt; strong field situations...
