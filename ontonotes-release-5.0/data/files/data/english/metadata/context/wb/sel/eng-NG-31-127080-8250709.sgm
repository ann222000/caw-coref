I think the article is just as relevant for T1's too. In my case, my
current doc looked at my A1C's (which were truly excellent) and all
the risk factors (especially a deep deep family history) for heart
disease, and decided that my diabetes or complications of it wouldn't
kill me, it would be heart disease. Yes, diabetes is certainly one of
the risk factors for heart disease

I do disagree with a couple of sentences in the NYT article most
notably &quot;[emphasizing] blood sugar control is difficult and expensive
and has not been proven to save lives&quot;, which I partly agree with
(difficult and expensive) and disagree with (I was in a coma 25 years
ago, my first week with diabetes, nobody can tell me that controlling
my bg didn't save my life!)

But the emphasis on having to look at other aspects of health beyond
just bg, especially after bg's have been brought into control, is
something that many of my diabetes-concentrating endos had not done a
good job of for several decades. I feel so so so much better now that
my other aspects of health are being taken care of too (and there is
so much more work to do too!)

We can sit around and be satisfied with our bg control and assume that
it will prevent all the bg-related complications and any other nasty
effects of diabetes.

But no research has shown that diabetics with excellent blood sugar
control are at zero risk for complications and heart disease and all
the other things. In fact, all the research has shown that we're still
at increased risk even with excellent control.

If the NYT article came out heavy on the pharma side, that's
unfortunate. It doesn't mean that we're off the hook. Me, whatever I
can do to lessen all the other risks, I'll try it, whether it's a pill
or (more often) something else. And I realize fully that I'm still not
doing everything I could.

The current research proves that higher HDL and lower TGLs are far more
predictive of CVD than LDL and that the target of very low LDL is an
inappropriate recommendation.

But targets aren't the only consideration: it's *how* you get your bg
and lipids to goals that's important.  Eating and living in a way that
achieves goals is far more protective because you're not fighting
damaging processes with chemical interventions.

I mostly agree. I thought the issue of needing to address heart disease
risks more generally than by controlling blood sugar was important, though.

I also think that the British study that showed controlling bg didn't lower
heart disease risks has flaws. I've seen more detailed analyses that seem to
say that measuring control by A1c isn't good enough and that you have to
also look at variability. When the data were re-analyzed with variability
measured within A1c catagories, it was obvious that control was actually
very effective.

And I wonder about the talk about weight loss not being very efffective.
With the recent discoveries about metabolic signaling within visceral fat,
it may be that people don't lose enough weight to do the job. I don't think
we really know.

Certainly there is more to treating diabetes than controlling bg.
Controlling insulin also comes to mind...

I'd say the evidence on the importance of LDL lowering is a bit murky. We
know that lowering LDL with a statin reduces mortality and cardiac morbidity
in diabetics. But we can't yet really tease out whether the benefit is from
the lowered LDL or the statin in some other way.

For sure people with DM and heart disease didn't get them because they
weren't taking the right drugs. They got them from genetics and lifestyle.
Once they have them, they may need drugs to help them. Or, they may not if
lifestyle changes will do the job for them.

It would be easier to see this with clarity if we could run studies where we
could control LDL down to 60 or so without a drug or with different
unrelated drugs so we could sort out the LDL effect from the other possible
confounding effects of a statin.

The NYT article was definitely negative re what the patient could do apart
from taking a number of drugs.

I think the fact that we can't is proof that our bodies aren't meant to.

Likely that wouldn't be enough LDL to support healthy, normal
adrenal/immune function.  That's probably why the elderly with the
lowest LDL have higher mortality.

Susan -
I've looked at the cholesterol studies and while I agree that all of
them are not as clear-cut as the simple things put in textbooks, they
come down overwhelmingly in favor of tight LDL targets. Or, as my doc
as done, extra-super-tight LDL targets considering all the other risk
factors I already have.

You don't have to agree with me, but it seems pretty slam-dunk to me
and my body.

I read the other responses to date.

This is the part that sets the scene:

&quot;Mr. Smith, a 43-year-old pastor in Fairmont, Minn., tried
hard. When dieting did not work, he began counting
carbohydrates, taking pills to lower his blood sugar and
pricking his finger several times a day to measure his sugar
levels. They remained high, so he agreed to add insulin to
his already complicated regimen. Blood sugar was always on
his mind.

But in focusing entirely on blood sugar, Mr. Smith ended up
neglecting the most important treatment for saving lives —
lowering the cholesterol level. That protects against heart
disease, which eventually kills nearly everyone with
diabetes.

He also was missing a second treatment that protects
diabetes patients from heart attacks — controlling blood
pressure. Mr. Smith assumed everything would be taken care
of if he could just lower his blood sugar level.&quot;

For Mr Smith all that may have been true. But the article
extends those false presumptions by implication to all type
2's.

The specific critical mistake is here: &quot;When dieting did not
work, he began counting carbohydrates, taking pills to lower
his blood sugar and pricking his finger several times a day
to measure his sugar levels.&quot;

First, dieting needs definition - what diet, what was it's
purpose (weight loss, BG management, lipids management,
other?). Next - how did he count carbs, using what method
and to what purpose? Next - what system was he following for
BG testing?

If, for example the diet he followed was that advocated by
the majority of dieticians reported here by newbies on
arrival, and by my own dietician, it would be low-fat, high
carb.

If he counted carbs using the exchange system or that
advocated by the majority of dieticians reported here, and
my own dietician, it would be 30-45 grams at every meal and
15 gms for snacks, with 5 veges and 2 fruits every day.
Regardless of the post-meal BG results.

If he pricked his finger several times a day in accordance
with the advice reported by most newbies here, and my own
doctor, it would be fasting, pre-dinner and maybe two hours
after each meal without using any of those tests to review
his menu. At most he reported the results to his doc, who
upped his meds and then suggested insulin.

Why am I not surprised that his diet, carb counting, testing
and the meds he was taking not only did not improve his BG's
but led to high cholesterol and high blood pressure? Because
we see Mr Smith arrive here daily. I also meet him on Yahoo
Groups and the ADA forum. We see the results of that system.

Nearly every person who appears here as a newby and then
bothers to drop in again months later with a follow-up not
only reports improvements in BG's and A1c but also in
weight, cholesterol, blood pressure and other health
aspects.

Those who succeeded started by focusing on BG's using test,
test, test and exercise. Along the way they reviewed their
menu constantly to not only improve BG's but to add variety
and good nutrition without raising BG's. That awareness of
what was going on in their bodies led to improvements in all
areas, not just one.

And that takes us back to that critical mistake - it's not
that diet did not work, it's that the correct way of eating
is the critical platform that all the other parts of type 2
diabetes and heart health management are founded on. If the
diet is actively working against the meds, exercise and
insulin - then they will fail. As they did for Mr Smith; and
as they will in his future if he keeps adding meds and
insulin to a poor foundation.

Just my opinion.

I think it depends upon the individual's ratios.  But no studies have
found any benefit of lowering to targets under 100.

Even when my LDL was 179, my calculated CVD risk was below average on
Harvard's calculator IIRC, for example, because my HDL was so high and
TGLs so low.

There are high risks of toxicity from the drugs that lower lipids so
much; measuring only mortality rather than quality of life changes from
fatigue, aches, pains, cognitive losses misses the patient's health
completely.

VLDL's etc as well as kidney signals, etc.  I am on 2 meds for bp, altace
and Avapro, my diabetic meds (currently in flox post accident adn needign
to get reaccustomed to the Metformin, and Lipito.  I was told, actually,
way back 22 years ago at diagnosis, that a big issue for diabetics is
heart and odisease and stroke, and have tried to keep the risks as low as
possible.

When i erad the article, what most impressed me was that so many o fthe
doctors in the cases they seem to have reviewed did not alert the
diabetics to the circulatory dangers associated with the disease so people
were blythly thinking that keeping their bgs in line was all that might
ever be necessary, and not knowing that they were in danger of heart and
stroke problems.  10 minute visits were mentioned as not sufficient time
to educate patients with this complex disease.

One thing I found interesting was the issue of &quot;burnout&quot;.  Peole getting
sick of constant finger stick testing, keeping track of foods, etc and
finding it so onerous that they just  quit or eased back too much.   I
think too, that exercise gets to be difficult for busy  or aging people
with aches and pains, so kind of disappears, leaving more to diet and
meds(as is the case with me with sciatica).

The article was more of a condenation of the medical profession and its
failure to properly educate diabetics about the full panoply of side
effects than one of those &quot;blame the victem&quot; article saying that fat is
the whole isses.  It carefully mentioned that only 10%(I believe was the
figure) of fat peole have type 2 diabetes, and that weight loss does not
cure or remove the disease and, once weight is stable, control must be
exercised to keep the bgs in order.

In sum,  a pretty good article for a newspaper account, although not &quot;all
that we anal diabetics&quot; would  hope for.  People shouldn't have to wait
until they get a heart attack to be told to watch their lipids adn bp adn
to be given help, in one form or another, to deal with them.

&gt; I read the other responses to date.

&gt; This is the part that sets the scene:

&gt; &quot;Mr. Smith, a 43-year-old pastor in Fairmont, Minn., tried
&gt; hard. When dieting did not work, he began counting
&gt; carbohydrates, taking pills to lower his blood sugar and
&gt; pricking his finger several times a day to measure his sugar
&gt; levels. They remained high, so he agreed to add insulin to
&gt; his already complicated regimen. Blood sugar was always on
&gt; his mind.

&gt; But in focusing entirely on blood sugar, Mr. Smith ended up
&gt; neglecting the most important treatment for saving lives -
&gt; lowering the cholesterol level. That protects against heart
&gt; disease, which eventually kills nearly everyone with
&gt; diabetes.

&gt; He also was missing a second treatment that protects
&gt; diabetes patients from heart attacks - controlling blood
&gt; pressure. Mr. Smith assumed everything would be taken care
&gt; of if he could just lower his blood sugar level.&quot;

&gt; For Mr Smith all that may have been true. But the article
&gt; extends those false presumptions by implication to all type
&gt; 2's.

&gt; The specific critical mistake is here: &quot;When dieting did not
&gt; work, he began counting carbohydrates, taking pills to lower
&gt; his blood sugar and pricking his finger several times a day
&gt; to measure his sugar levels.&quot;

&gt; First, dieting needs definition - what diet, what was it's
&gt; purpose (weight loss, BG management, lipids management,
&gt; other?). Next - how did he count carbs, using what method
&gt; and to what purpose? Next - what system was he following for
&gt; BG testing?

&gt; If, for example the diet he followed was that advocated by
&gt; the majority of dieticians reported here by newbies on
&gt; arrival, and by my own dietician, it would be low-fat, high
&gt; carb.

&gt; If he counted carbs using the exchange system or that
&gt; advocated by the majority of dieticians reported here, and
&gt; my own dietician, it would be 30-45 grams at every meal and
&gt; 15 gms for snacks, with 5 veges and 2 fruits every day.
&gt; Regardless of the post-meal BG results.

&gt; If he pricked his finger several times a day in accordance
&gt; with the advice reported by most newbies here, and my own
&gt; doctor, it would be fasting, pre-dinner and maybe two hours
&gt; after each meal without using any of those tests to review
&gt; his menu. At most he reported the results to his doc, who
&gt; upped his meds and then suggested insulin.

&gt; Why am I not surprised that his diet, carb counting, testing
&gt; and the meds he was taking not only did not improve his BG's
&gt; but led to high cholesterol and high blood pressure? Because
&gt; we see Mr Smith arrive here daily. I also meet him on Yahoo
&gt; Groups and the ADA forum. We see the results of that system.

&gt; Nearly every person who appears here as a newby and then
&gt; bothers to drop in again months later with a follow-up not
&gt; only reports improvements in BG's and A1c but also in
&gt; weight, cholesterol, blood pressure and other health
&gt; aspects.

&gt; Those who succeeded started by focusing on BG's using test,
&gt; test, test and exercise. Along the way they reviewed their
&gt; menu constantly to not only improve BG's but to add variety
&gt; and good nutrition without raising BG's. That awareness of
&gt; what was going on in their bodies led to improvements in all
&gt; areas, not just one.

&gt; And that takes us back to that critical mistake - it's not
&gt; that diet did not work, it's that the correct way of eating
&gt; is the critical platform that all the other parts of type 2
&gt; diabetes and heart health management are founded on. If the
&gt; diet is actively working against the meds, exercise and
&gt; insulin - then they will fail. As they did for Mr Smith; and
&gt; as they will in his future if he keeps adding meds and
&gt; insulin to a poor foundation.

&gt; Just my opinion.

Snips of chats with my doctor:

Wingmask: I am afraid of heart disease
Doc: No need to panic, you are doing what you have to do to stay
healthy.

Wingmask: What about kidney disease?
Doc: Keep the blood pressure normal and sugar under control, no need
to worry.

Wingmask: What is the average sugar reading that gives someone an a1c
of 5.5 or less?
Doc: An a1c over 6.5 is definitely diabetic. (Grrrrrr...didn't answer
my question)

Wingmask: I was up over 190 the other day.
Doc: As long as you don't stay there for more than an hour or two,
you're fine.

Wingmask: How long before complications sack me?
Doc: Complications take a long time to develop. 40 years, 50 years,
maybe never.

Wingmask: You mean I can live healthy?
Doc: Absolutely. It's all about good glucose control, maintaining good
cholesterol and blood pressure control.

I'd like to see a serious study that set out to find the percentage of
non-compliant patients, diabetic or otherwise, who go to a doctor but
don't follow the advice or take the prescribed medications.  From my
personal experiences and observations I would predict that it would be
a significant % of people who don't follow even the most basic health
advice.  How many people do you know that still smoke, are overweight,
don't exercise, or eat foods they know are bad for them?  I agree that
doctors should spend more than 10 minutes with their patients, but for
many patients even if the doctor followed them around 24/7 they would
still find a way to ignore what it takes to make them a healthier
person.

Compared with moderate lipid lowering with standard-dose statin
therapy, intensive lipid lowering with high-dose statin therapy after
acute coronary syndromes (ACS) significantly reduces cardiovascular
events. However, the 2 trials of high-dose versus standard-dose statin
therapy in patients with ACS, Aggrastat to Zocor (A to Z) and
Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-
Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE-IT-TIMI 22), were not
individually powered to evaluate the impact on mortality alone. In
this study, a pooled, patient-level analysis of these trials of 8,658
post-ACS patients was performed to provide a more robust estimate of
the impact of intensive statin therapy on mortality. By 8 months,
achieved low-density lipoprotein levels were lower in the group with
intensive statin therapy (median 64 mg/dl, interquartile range 51 to
81) than in the group with moderate statin therapy (median 87 mg/dl,
interquartile range 71 to 107) (p &lt;0.001). All-cause mortality was
significantly reduced in the group with intensive statin therapy
compared with the group with moderate statin therapy (3.6% vs 4.9%,

without significant interaction by trial (interaction p = 0.63). The
reduction in all-cause mortality with intensive statin therapy was
consistent across key subgroups. In conclusion, in this analysis of

therapy after ACS was associated with reduced mortality compared with
moderate lipid lowering with standard-dose statin therapy. On the
basis of these findings, 1 death was prevented for every 95 patients
treated with high-dose statin therapy for 2 years. The results of this
pooled analysis provide further evidence for early intensive statin
therapy after ACS.&quot;

I don't trust the data at all.  Same way I didn't trust the HRT data,
the LymeRix data, the Rezulin data.

In 20 years, when a non profit entity reviews the effects of statins
after decades of use, we'll likely get a report like the WHI showing
that all the alleged &quot;well proven&quot; benefits were a lie.

Statins have high toxicity, the higher the dose, the higher the toxicity.

I just remembered the Heart Protection Study, which included both those with
heart disease and those with DM:

BMC Med. 2005 Mar 16;3:6.  Links
The effects of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin on cause-specific
mortality and on cancer incidence in 20,536 high-risk people: a randomised
placebo-controlled trial [ISRCTN48489393].Heart Protection Study
Collaborative Group.

BACKGROUND: There have been concerns that low blood cholesterol
concentrations may cause non-vascular mortality and morbidity. Randomisation
of large numbers of people to receive a large, and prolonged, reduction in
cholesterol concentrations provides an opportunity to address such concerns
reliably. METHODS: 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with vascular disease
or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily or
matching placebo. Prespecified safety analyses were of cause-specific
mortality, and of total and site-specific cancer incidence. Comparisons
between all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants
(ie, &quot;intention-to-treat&quot;) involved an average difference in blood total
cholesterol concentration of 1.2 mmol/L (46 mg/dL) during the scheduled
5-year treatment period. RESULTS: There was a highly significant 17% (95% CI
9-25) proportional reduction in vascular deaths, along with a
non-significant reduction in all non-vascular deaths, which translated into
a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (p = 0.0003). The
proportional reduction in the vascular mortality rate was about one-sixth in
each subcategory of participant studied, including: men and women; under and
over 70 years at entry; and total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L or LDL
cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L. No significant excess of non-vascular
mortality was observed in any subcategory of participant (including the
elderly and those with pretreatment total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L), and
there was no significant excess in any particular cause of non-vascular
mortality. Cancer incidence rates were similar in the two groups, both
overall and in particular subcategories of participant, as well as at
particular primary sites. There was no suggestion that any adverse trends in
non-vascular mortality or morbidity were beginning to emerge with more
prolonged treatment. CONCLUSION: These findings, which are based on large
numbers of deaths and non-fatal cancers, provide considerable reassurance
that lowering total cholesterol concentrations by more than 1 mmol/L for an
average of 5 years does not produce adverse effects on non-vascular
mortality or cancer incidence. Moreover, among the many different types of
high-risk individual studied, simvastatin 40 mg daily consistently produced
substantial reductions in vascular (and, hence, all-cause) mortality, as
well as in the rates of non-fatal heart attacks, strokes and
revascularisation procedures.

I just played around with the Harvard calculator, and it wouldn't increase

Apparently, they think that smoking and untreated high blood pressure are

I so agree as I too was in a coma and on a ventilator for 6 days.   Before

early, but did not expect it to happen any day now, since I had type II as

has been proven to save my life, and that is good enough for me.  Plus,
tight blood sugar control has been proven to decrease rates of complications
in diabetics, which is a worthwhile pursuit in itself.

&gt; something that many of my diabetes-concentrating endos had not done a

I'm not surprised.  Nobody has brought up statins to me until this year and
I have had diabetes for 9 years.  I was only 33 when I got it though, so
maybe that was why.  I did have a doctor trying to get me to take an ACE
inhibitor 3 years ago even though my blood pressure was only slightly high
at 125/80, but he said it had protective kidney affects, but I declined
since I was in the middle of building my family, and ACE inhibitors are not
safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  I did start one just a few months
ago finally.

Lipid panels are correlated to cardiovascular disease, but not as highly

I appreciate you providing this cite.  I found the entire study here:

cause abstracts are never good enough for me.  ;)

In a 5 year study of people with known vascular disease and/or diabetes,
mortality was reduced 17% in men and 19% in women on statins due to
fewer heart disease deaths.  Overall mortality reduction was 13% on
statins, which indicates that some number of people in the control group
died of other causes at a higher rate (but that was not statistically
significant... I expect we'd need a larger sample size to examine that
issue).

I don't see any methodological problems with the study - it looks
persuasive to me.  There may well be risks associated with statins that
this study didn't pick up because it wasn't large enough or long-term
enough, but a 13% reduction in mortality in 5 years is a pretty
persuasive argument to me.  Death is pretty much the mother of all
adverse effects.

My personal conclusion is to renew my prescription for pravastatin as
I'm both a heart patient and a diabetic.

Not quite the same ratio, but this paper on the Trigs/HDL
ratio for type 2 may interest you, although I suspect you
have already seen it. The full pdf: http://tinyurl.com/rvb55

&quot;Ratio of Triglycerides to HDL Cholesterol Is an Indicator
of LDL Particle Size in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and
Normal HDL Cholesterol Levels&quot;

I have difficulty getting a VLDL test through my local lab -
but I'm more interested in that ratio in any case. If my
trigs/HDL is well under 1.33 (I'm in mmol land, that's 3.0
in mg/dl land) I'm not particularly worried about the LDL.
It is presently just over 1.0, so I'll remain on
ezetrol(zetia) even though my LDL is 30% higher than it was
on lipitor. The lipitor only affected LDL and had no effect
whatever on my trigs or HDL.

Only for the past couple years has this route been quite so obvious.

9 years ago, when he was diagnosed, some docs knew about some of the

I've seen such incredible advances in diabetes treatment and diagnosis
in the past 25 years you'd be blown away. When I was diagnosed it was
with a urine test. And no docs in my hometown knew about home blood

It's bad journalism - but not for that reason. I'm not
refuting the link between diabetes and heart disease in any
way. There is an obvious link and all of us here are more
than aware of it. If I remember correctly to be diagnosed as
a type 2 diabetic is equivalent to the same risk as having
had your first heart attack. I disagree with several things
in that article - but that is not one of them. My prime
disagreement is on their focus and their clear implication
that BG's are less important than BP or Lipids.

To be specific, from what I've read, there is a far closer
and more provable link between death and HbA1c for type 2
than there is for a link between death and LDL or death and
hypertension. All three are high risk factors - but to
ignore BG's as the primary one for diabetics is ridiculous
and dangerous. Further, my own experience and that of many
other type 2's I have corresponded with and met personally
is that when diet and exercise are used as the primary means
of BG management and meds are used as the secondary or
complementary then lipids and hypertension are usually
improved at the same time.

Jim Chinnis mentioned this excerpt from a paper on statins
and LDL: &quot;This shows a 23% reduction in all-cause mortality
just from a stronger statin dose corresponding to an average
change in LDL from 87 mg/dl to 64. Impressive, right? I must
admit that's the strongest case I've heard in favour of
statins and LDL reduction for a while, although I haven't
read the detail. It's also the only one I've seen that comes
out that strongly.

However, when I compare it to this, I doubt I'll give up
recommending test, test, test:

&quot;HbA1c was continuously related to subsequent all cause,
cardiovascular, and ischaemic heart disease mortality
through the whole population distribution, with lowest rates
in those with HbA1c concentrations below 5%. An increase of
1% in HbA1c was associated with a 28% (P&lt;0.002) increase in
risk of death independent of age, blood pressure, serum
cholesterol, body mass index, and cigarette smoking habit;&quot;

I think any diabetic who ignores BG's and concentrates only
on lipids and BP is mad. And that is the clear signal in
that article; not just in the text - look at the nice photo
and comment on the guy who tests rarely having a good time
in his orchard.

I have no figures on hypertension drugs and death - but I do
test at home and I do ensure my BP is OK.

BG's, lipids, BP; they are all only part of the whole, but
for us as type 2's if we don't gain reasonable control of
the BG's the others won't matter. The other message in that
article is that diet doesn't work, meds are essential and
progression is inevitable. Read it again in full.

Nothing would ever convince me that statins are indicated.  If I thought
I needed a chemical intervention, I'd use pantethine, well researched,

adrenals as statins do, it supports their normal function.

I believe that a HDL/TGL ratio below 3, optimally 1-1.5 is very
protective and indicative of large, fluffy, VLDL without directly
testing it.

The deaths would more likely be from immune dysfunction, inflammation,

Doctors never recognize it and fail to diagnose even the most flagrant
obvious cases even when steroids are in use.  I'm living proof.  The
symptoms are so gradual and insidious, that even the patient usually

not aggressive in finding information for hirself, how is s/he supposed to
control the bp and chloresterol?

How about giving a mew patient either a book or a DVD full of diabetic
advice (even ADA goals are better than none).  this might help take the
place of some of the lack of time devoted to educating patients on all the
ramifications of the disease.

Well, I honestly don't know what's more or less important. I did not
agree with every quote in the article and I've already clearly stated
here that I think the quote that controlling bg being unproven to save
lives is wrong for me (I'm not a Type 2 but will generalize at least
some of my beliefs beyond my little lesser-numbered type!)

But if I look at the risk factor lists associated with cardiovascular
disease, diabetes is usually just one of seven or one of thirteen.
That doesn't mean that all the risk factors are equally weighted -
it's pretty obvious they aren't all equal.

What I read in the NY Times article was that getting good bg control
doesn't eliminate the diabetes risk factor, and it doesn't do much to
help any of the other twelve risk factors at all. And that's the story
I took away from it, and I think it's a good story.

When it comes to going over news articles with a fine-toothed comb, I
cannot fault the reporter for quoting a knowledgable source as to what
he said. Sometimes I think the context is lost, and that's
unfortunate, but it's important not to get all bent out of shape just
because the context was lost around a single quote. I've been quoted
out of context several times in national publications (most recently
the Washington Post) and don't hold it against the reporter.

That was there, sure, but, on the whole, the article read like an
infomercial for the pharmaceutical companies.
