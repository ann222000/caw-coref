Recently I was in an accident where the other driver was 100% at fault. The insurance
company totaled my car. They are offering about $3200+taxes for a fully loaded, 1990 Camry
V6 LE with 126,000 miles on it. Since I wasn't planning on selling it, I had no idea of
the value, so I looked at the classifieds and found 4 ads for the same vehicle (almost all
had more miles on them than mine) and the average came to about $4700. I figure this to be
kinda high, with these being dealership prices. I told the insurance company that I
thought their offer was low. They replied that their figure was fair and was arrived at by
outsourcing a service called Autosource, who had 37 vehicles of the same make and model
within a 96 mile radius in their listings database. How can Autosource have 37 1990 Camry
LE's when I could only find 4??? I used as many online search engines as I could find. I
asked to see the listings that Autosource used so that I could verify the price and the
insurance agent indicated that she would send the listings to me. What do you guys think?
Should I take the money and run?? Should I hold out? They seem to have a good case for
their price, although I haven't seen the data yet. I've never negotiated with an insurance
company before. Anyone have any tips?

&gt; $3200 for a 90 Camry?!?!?!?!?! That's $1200 too much.

"/> I was thinking it's $3000 too much. But I know how the OP feels. I've got
a 1995 Mits. Galant that still looks and runs like new. It's only driven on
weekends and the occasional long road trip. It is not a commuter. I am the
only owner, the only DRIVER, and the thing is always garaged when not in
use. The body is immaculately clean. If you looked at the interior, you
might think it just drove off the new car lot (other than a stain on the
driver's seat . . . soda?, I think). If I wanted to BUY such a vehicle, I'd
have to pay a minimum of four times the blue book value . . . if I could
even FIND ONE with low mileage in near-mint condition, that is.

In short, it is irreplaceable.

I haven't carried full insurance on it in years. What's the point? Even if
the insurance company &quot;totalled&quot; it, I'd be lucky to get even 25% of what
it's worth. Yeah, I know I could have the thing appraised and insure it for
a larger amount . . . if I wanted to pay someone to appraise it. I wish
someone offered (reasonably priced) full NEW replacement value insurance for
cars, like they do with homeowner's insurance. In the case of homeowner's
insurance, it only costs a little more (10% or so, from memory) to have all
the contents of your home insured for full *replacement* value. The way car
insurance companies are run, I shudder to think what full replacement
insurance would cost, though.

I'd advise the OP to take the money and apply it to a new car. Also, unless
your state requires it, why carry FULL insurance on a car more than five
years old? Our state only requires liability (which I'm unlikely to need,
but I have it anyway) and I have health insurance to cover me and my family
in case an underinsured driver causes us to need medical help. If my car is
totalled, I'll take the money I've saved by not buying FULL insurance
coverage and apply it as the down-payment on a new car. I'll have a larger
down-payment that way than if the insurance company bought my &quot;totalled&quot; car
from me. -Dave

"/> Yes it, like many things posted here, is a great idea. Now let's see if
it works. What leverage do you have when they laugh? Do you think they
might claim they are not in the auto dealer business? Oh, and lastly,
does your contract with them (also called a policy) specify they will do
that?

A better course is to explore the data provided by Autosource, if I
remember the correct name. How current is it? Is it listing or more
likely transactions? Is the data 96 miles away valid for your location?
You could be in the boonies 96 miles from a large city with no way to get
there.

Good luck!

Well, I am leaning to taking the money and running with it. They are paying the 3200 and
adding the sales tax to it, so the total is about $3500. Can't recall if they are
including registration, but I will ask on Monday.
My wife had a similiar experience, her car was totaled - the insurance company
gave her a lower than bluebook value and she countered by sending in ads with her car.
They gave her more money than she paid for it! I guess that is why I am shooting higher
than what the insurance company is offering. It's called GREED :-). Truely, though, I am
leaning to accepting their offer. It sounds pretty fair, but first I want to verify the
data-set that their using to determine the offer.

I went through this 10 years ago with my insurance company. When I
challenged it, I asked for the dealer names and locations where the
supposedly 'comparable' cars were located.

The list was out of date; some of the dealers were out of business.

I went to the local dealers with pictures of my car before the accident,
the maintenance history, etc., and asked them what they thought the car
would be worth. None of the dealers had a problem putting their number
of paper, with their name.

I took all of this to my insurance agent, and asked why my insurance
company was totalling out my car for 60% of book value, and why the list
of comparables was so out of date. Within a day, the settlement went up
to book value.

Against another insurance company your have less leverage. I'd still
get your insurance company involved - they might be able to lend a hand.
If the settlement offer is significatly below book value, fight it.

"/> If you have the space, the skill set, and the interest, and the old car has
any good parts left on it, you can usually have them knock a few hundred off
the settlement and keep the car. (assuming you will be buying something
close enough that the parts will do you any good.) My brother did this twice
on the same car (neither accident his fault), and ended up selling the car
for more than he had in it. If you have a fancy stereo or fresh tires or
anything like that, keeping those is usually not a big deal- doesn't make
any difference in what the insurance company's contract scrap yard will pay
for the car.

YMMV, of course- customary practices in a good-ol'-boy small town may be
different in the big city. Places I have lived, insurance agents understand
the concept of a parts car.

"/> Take the insured and his insurance company to small claims court for the
difference between their offer and the price of the equivalent models
you can find IN YOUR AREA. Add in the additional cost of buying a new
car -- sales tax, license fees, additional insurance, safety inspection
of new vehicle, and give a shot at getting mileage at current federal
rates for conducting your search for the new car.

What about medical payments? Can you legally submit the same medical
claim to his insurance company AND your own insurance company? Note:
this used to be legal, maybe it still is. If so, that MRI is a profit
center. Out of the goodness of their heart they paid for pain and
suffering too.

I got all of the above when my own car was totaled, except for the
mileage. I would rather have had my old car.

"/> Yes, of course it still is, but it's unlikely to get you any more
money.

However, there will probably be a box on the claim form somewhere
that asks if any other insurance is applicable. If you don't answer
honestly, it's fraud (big-time illegal), and if you do answer
honestly it's quite likely that any one company will pay for the
same items that another company pays for.

But if there's a medical claim (and I don't believe the OP mentioned
one), then it is _C_R_A_Z_Y_ for the claimant not to have a lawyer.
The chance an insurance company will give an unrepresented lay
person what a medical claim is worth is essentially nil. (This is a
constant refrain on misc.legal.moderated.) And that same lawyer can
probably squeeze more money for the property damage too.

"/> Have them send you the Autosource documentation listing the comparable
vehicles for sale or recently sold. It is possible that there were
errors in assessing your vehicle (e.g. year, condition, mileage) against
the comparables. But also note that recent sales may be used with the
actual selling prices, which can be lower than the asking prices that
you see in the paper.

"/> Insurance settlements should give you replacement cost (plus tax and
pro-rated license). In practice, car pricing services used by insurance
companies use cars for sale or recently sold at dealers (because dealers
are easier to track, and one visit can give price and condition data on
many cars for sale or recently sold). Of course, actual sale price of
cars recently sold may be lower than offering prices that one sees in
the classified ads.

But do note that it is likely that certain characteristics of cars can
be under or over valued in the used car market (relative to how you would
value a car), and insurance valuations based on the used car market.
Also, a known used car (i.e. your own car) may be more valuable to you
than an unknown used car of generally similar condition -- your car may
have n defects or problems that you are willing to live with, while some
other used car with n defects or problems may have some that you can't
live with and must spend money to have fixed.

&gt;It's the same old story. The owner of the car always think his car is

&gt;Look any appraisal sites, e.g. edmunds.com, kbb.com, for the estimated
&gt;prices of any used car of that age (in your case, look for any other
&gt;Honda models), and you'll see that the private party estimated selling
&gt;price is about 2/3 of the estimated retail (dealer) price. If you
&gt;yourself found that the average dealer asking price is $4,700, then
&gt;the private value can be estimated to be at most $4,700 * .67 =
&gt;$3,149. So, it's a good offer. I'm surprised the insurance company

&gt;probably $1,000 higher than I expected.

"/> In most states, the courts have ruled that the insurer must pay what

Not what you could get for it if you sold it, but (in most cases) what
you would pay if you bought it from a used car dealer.

That's basically &quot;retail&quot; blue book, less deductions for any damage
the car had previously sustained, _plus_ the sales tax and initial
registration fee on the equivalent car. Also in most cases _plus_ any
add-on for recently replaced tires and/or battery, and plus or minus
the appropriate allowance for lower/higher than normal mileage.

So if the typical car with _more_ mileage is selling for $4,700, and
assuing OP's car didn't have any unfixed problems (damage and/or
deferred repairs), then the insurance should pay OP $4,700 *plus*
taxes and registration, *plus* an allowance for the difference in
mileage. And that's assuming OP wasn't injured. If OP _was_ injured,
he should get a lawyer, pronto.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In theory, it would work (depending on state law) in one of three
&gt;&gt;&gt; ways: (1) each company would pay its own insured's costs; (2) they
&gt;&gt;&gt; would share the costs according to a percentage allocation of
&gt;&gt;&gt; liability between the drivers; (3) one driver would be judged &quot;at
&gt;&gt;&gt; fault&quot; and that company would pay everything. I'm not saying it
&gt;&gt;&gt; always works that way in practice, of course.

&gt;&gt; Whichever way it works the insurance companies make money. If they
&gt;&gt; didn't they'd be in another business.

&gt; I'd advise the OP to take the money and apply it to a new car. Also, unless
&gt; your state requires it, why carry FULL insurance on a car more than five
&gt; years old? Our state only requires liability (which I'm unlikely to need,
&gt; but I have it anyway) and I have health insurance to cover me and my family
&gt; in case an underinsured driver causes us to need medical help. If my car is
&gt; totalled, I'll take the money I've saved by not buying FULL insurance
&gt; coverage and apply it as the down-payment on a new car. I'll have a larger
&gt; down-payment that way than if the insurance company bought my &quot;totalled&quot; car
&gt; from me. -Dave

"/> Hi Dave,

You say you don't carry uninsured/underinsured coverage because you
have health insurance to cover you if an un/underinsured driver causes
you to need medical help.

Having represented people who were in car accidents I can tell you
that health insurance often doesn't even begin to cover all of the
expenses associated with being severely injured in a car accident.
Health insurance doesn't cover being unable to work for a period of
time (weeks, months, years?). If you end up with some degree of
permanent disability health insurance doesn't provide any coverage for
lost income or additional living expenses.

I personally believe that uninsured/underinsured coverage is the
really the only auto insurance that you really *do* want to carry. As
you have pointed out, collision/comprehensive coverage is a waste on
cars over 5 years old. Carrying liability insurance may be legally
required, and a decent thing to do from a civics standpoint, but its a
poor value for most people. Personal injury attorneys don't have much
interest in suing someone with low/no liability insurance, so having
it doesn't really protect most people from anything. If you are rich,
that is another story, but the average person doesn't have enough
assets to interest a personal injury lawyer. Underinsured/uninsured
coverage, in contrast, pays you in the event you are disabled in a car
accident and in many cases it is a families only source of financial
help in a desperate time.

Andy

"/> Your answer is technically correct but not very helpful. Sort of like
Microsoft's software documenation. By searching diligently, I
eventually found the relevant section:

Sickness and
Injury Benefits

Generally, you must report as income any
amount you receive for personal injury or sickness through an
accident or health plan that is paid for by
your employer. If both you and your employer pay for the plan,
only the amount you receive that is due to
your employer's payments is reported as income.
[exception for military-service-related payments snipped]

And there's an example under &quot;Itemized Deduction Recoveries&quot;:

During 2001, you paid $1,700 for medical expenses. From this
amount you subtracted $1,500, which was 7.5% of your adjusted
gross income. Your actual medical expense deduction was $200.
In 2002, you received a $500 reimbursement from your medical
insurance for your 2001 expenses. The only amount of the $500
reimbursement that must be included in your income for 2002
is $200the amount actually deducted.

This example also supports your argument, although it doesn't
directly address it.
