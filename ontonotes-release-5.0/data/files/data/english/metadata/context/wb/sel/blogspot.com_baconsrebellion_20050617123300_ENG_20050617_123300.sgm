Virginia Tech is sponsoring an early childhood conference in
Charlottesville with a focus on "development through inclusion –
regardless of physical or mental ability."

Workshops will examine "cultural differences and disabilities in
children in order to provide collaborative, instructional strategies and
curriculums designed to meet the needs of all children." Speaker Mara
Shapon-Shevin will expound upon the idea of applying "the practice of
inclusion" to all classrooms "in order to eradicate inclusion’s general
association with special needs children." Blah, blah, woof, woof, eyes
glaze over.

Is it just me, or does this sound like a touchie-feelie fest? Does
anyone really think that more "inclusion" will help special needs
students? Am I overlooking something when I observe that "special needs"
students have special needs -- that they need specialized exercises and
programs tailored to their level of cognitive development? In some
instances, I would guess, children could be mainstreamed with their
peers and given special instruction for an hour or two per day. But
certainly not all. Am I sounding cold and callous by suggesting that
"inclusion" of inappropriate children in mainstream classes will result
in the dumbing down of the curriculum for students who are not disabled?

Disabled children certainly deserve our compassion, but is
"inclusion" truly the best way to help them? I don't know the answers.
I'm just asking questions.

My wife is an elementary school guidance counselor. School
administrators need max lattitude - that is called professional
discretion - to determine how much any special needs child can be
mainstreamed. Forcing it from top down diminishes the education of the
other kids. The school administrators are caring and sensitive enough to
stretch as far as they can to include special needs kids.

My wife was a special education teacher before becoming a stay at
home mom (a much harder job). She was expected to teach 1st, 2nd and 3rd
graders in the same class at the same time. Hey, I'm a Hokie, but
whoever thinks you can design a program for all students, especially in
the same class, is full of crap.

This is a very difficult, very sensitive topic. Inclusion, when it is
appropriate, is a wonderful thing for both parties. Figuring out when it
is appropriate is not easy.

Check and I think you will find that special education, from
transportation through staffing through lawsuits brought by parents,
consume huge portions of most school budgets. No parent wants anything
but the best for their child, but the same mindset that we saw in Terri
Schaivo's parents is sometimes present in the parents of special needs
children. I think generally schools try to do the best they can in this
area under frequently difficult circumstances, but parents often
disagree.

My wife was for several years a substitute aide for special needs
children. She accompanied individual children to their "mainstreamed"
class and rarely saw much that was positive; her job often was to keep
the special needs child from disrupting the class. Many other students
had such profound special needs that the school was a de facto temporary
institution that changed diapers and fed the children. Why a public
school was deemed the provider for this level of care was hard to
explain.

Like any ongoing bureaucratic program with little hope of change,
these "touchie-feelie fests" are a part of the landscape. I must admit
that I'd rather see us spend tax dollars to send a beleagured special ed
teacher to a conference where he/she can relax and learn something than
send a DGIF big-wig to a Las Vegas trade show.

feely language until "blah blah woof woof eyes glaze over" woke me up.

Paul, Can you believe that there are people in the world who spend
all their time talking that way? Poor bastards.

Does anyone really think that more "inclusion" will help special
needs students?

As a kid, my middle school was next door to a "special needs" middle
school. We shared a parking lot and a playground (with a chain-link
fence down the middle) with that school. The kids in my school spent a
lot of time making fun of the kids in the other school. And those kids
at the other school sure did look sad all the time.

Then, in 8th grade, the schools started to mix it up. The most
egregious offenders (students in my school who would do things like trip
the retarded kids from the other school) were matched up with
special-needs kids, and they spent about half an hour together each day.
The kids would come over to our school for assemblies, and started
having classes in our school. They weren't in the same classes as the
rest of us, of course, but we all mingled in the hallways.

The result was a huge, huge success. These assholes in my school
became these kids' biggest defenders. It became common to see a pair of
12 year old boys hugging, since many of these retarded kids were in an
emotional state at which that's simply how they express happiness with
somebody else. I guarantee you that damned near every kid in my 8th
grade class now considers themselves a defender of mainstreaming and its
benefits.

I have no idea of whether inclusion is the "best" way to help them,
but it's a pretty freaking great thing.

This type of conference is prima facie evidence of why so much is
spent on education with so little result in improved learning and
knowledge.

Evidence continues to mount that cognitive training can be employed
successfully to improve learning of previously low performing students,
including those considered “special needs.” Yet, what are we talking
about? A social agenda with the veneer of credibility from the
university associations.

With an autistic cousin, I know that it can be challenging to educate
special education students. My uncle and aunt have had to work very hard
get her as far as they have.

This is a case where something in the middle may actually be the best
option. Obviously, special needs students require a different education
to those in your standard public school. However, the hope is that, one
day, we will be able to integrate these students into the real world.
So, at least some social interaction with their peers is needed. I can't
propose a solution to this, as it might be difficult to place some of
them into standard courses, and only allowing interaction during lunch
and recess periods may not be quite enough.

Waldo's idea might work in some cases, but there are some rough kids
out there who might not like to conform. This idea could be potentially
risky (though, if the teachers are doing their job, one would hope that
it wouldn't be). I will agree that it is not the "inclusion" that would
help those with special needs, but the exposure might. Special needs
certainly doesn't mean dumb; they can learn a lot when dealing with
others. And in real life, the "normal" students will have to learn with
many different people; this is not "diversity", but diplomacy.

One big key; avoid the PC crap. The special ed students are
different. Students need to learn that they are fully capable of leading
full lives, but teaching the students that they are not different is
just plain a bad idea.

In the end, we can't make this about what's "fair" or "nice", but
what is best for the special ed students. It might not seem fair for
them to have seperate classes, but if we find that it works best, then
that option should be the way the schools go.

I saw an interesting statistic the other day: 25-35% of teenagers
with learning disabilities will abuse alcohol (American Psychiatric
Assoc). Is this a result of taunting and exclusion from their
non-disabled peers? Their own inability to deal with their differences
and issues? Who knows. But it seems to me that approaches like the
original cited may attempt to address more than just the cognitive
development needs of these students. This taps the broader issue of just
what the purpose of school is. Is the pursuit of knowledge the sole
purpose of our educational system, and development of socialization
skills just a happy byproduct? Or do we expect our schools to do much
more than just teach ABCs? < $BlogBacklinkSnippet$>
