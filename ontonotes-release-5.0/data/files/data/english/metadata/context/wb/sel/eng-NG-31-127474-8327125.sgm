It is often claimed that the difference between an atheist and
Christian is that the number of gods the atheist doesn't believe in is
1 greater than the number of gods the Christian doesn't believe in. Is
the claim accurate?

Consider a god that Christians don't believe in. The one with the most
followers is possibly Vishnu. Do atheists and Christians have exactly
the same reasons for not believing in his existence?

For me, an atheist, I do not believe Vishnu exists because I have no
compelling evidence that he does.  Same goes for the Junior/Pa/
Spookster combo.

It'd interesting to see if any Christian tries the UGT (Unified God
Theory) and claim that Vishnu *is* the same God, just seen through a
different lens.

Good question. According to them, yes probably--they don't believe in
Vishnu because they haven't had that &quot;personal experience&quot; with him.
But I would say Christians just _prefer_ their God, largely because
they were programmed to but for other reasons as well. History has
proven that the Abrahamic God is simply the most appealing to people,
which accounts for its success. Monotheism in general is largely
preferred than polytheism because it has a more powerful God, and the
three central monotheisms have a built-in system of reward and
punishment that didn't leave the old polytheisms with much of a
chance.

Obviously if they did then all Christians would be atheists because they
would not believe in Vishnu for the same reason that atheists don't believe
in the Christian God.

More seriously, that is a subjective question.  There are some atheists who
chose atheism because of the moral repugnance of a life of faith.  There are
others who pursue it because they perceive science as offering better
answers to life's questions.  So really your question is like asking &quot;Do all
Christians believe in the trinity for the same reason?&quot;  In fact, the
trinity is not a universally-held belief among Christians.  Furthermore, it
is a notion that does not even exist in the original Bible from which
Christians supposedly draw their instruction.

Actually, I think your question is a loaded one.  It's like that famous
question &quot;have you stopped beating your wife?&quot;  For example, there are many
Christians who do in fact believe in the existence of gods other than their
God, but who identify those Gods with the work of Satan.  1 Timothy 4:1 is a
verse sometimes used to justify this idea (for example, see Neil Anderson
and Dave Park.  &quot;The Bondage Breaker&quot; Eugene:  Harvest House pub., 1993, p.
163).  Not assenting to a faith's spiritual truths is not the same as not
believing in the existence of that faith's deities or other supernatural
entities.

If you perceive reason as to be more moral than a lack of reason, then
the two are one and the same.

I can see why you look at it that way, but I really do not believe
they do on one level. To clarify: I could say two Christians believe
in God for the same reason because they both believe in God because
they prefer to and be correct. But they might prefer to for different
reasons. So it really is a semantic ambiguity more than anything.

It depends on your interpretations. A lot of Christians think certain

Atheists simply lack the belief in any supernatural powermonger.
Christians have a much more complicated relationship with competitive
gods.  They either deny their existence totally, or believe that they
are a manifestation of the devil, or a misguided attempt of millions
of ignorant believers looking for JC.

What is the relative position of Krishna, Rama, Siva and Vishnu? The
Brahmanic literature gives us no clue. There is some explanation as to
why the cult of Brahma disappeared in ancient India. The charge is
Brahma raped his own daughter. The enmity between Siva and his father-
in-law, Daksha, is known to all. Daksha said:&quot; This monkey-eyed (god0,
after having taken of (my) fawn-eyed (daughter), has not even by word
shown suitable respect to me whom he ought to have risen and saluted.&quot;
There are four persons who go by the name Krishna. One Krishna is the
son of Satyavati and father Dhatrashtra, Pandu and Vidur. Second
krishna is the brother of subhadra and friend of Arjuna. Third Krishna
is the one brought up by Nanda and Yashoda at Gokul and it was he who
killed Shishupal. Krishna's youthful career was full of illicit
intimacy with young girls of Brindaben which is called Rasalila.
Krishna is also an incarnation of Vishnu. The Devi Bhagwat states that
the Devi desired to rub her palms. The rubbing of palms produced a
blister. Out of this blister was born Brahma. When Brahma was born the
Devi asked him to marry her. Brahma refused saying she was his mother.
The Devi got angry and burned Brahma alive by her wrath and Brahma was
reduced to ashes then and there. Devi rubbed her palms a second time
and had a second blister. Out of this second blister a second son was
born. This was Vishnu.
What funny persons are these Hindu goda1

I fail to see that the religious worship the same god as the Xians
have a triune one whereas the other two Abahamic ones are mono. And
Bhrama can be hundreds of gods.And all these vary on what is moral.
Christinsanity, Smith's Fraud, Moses's Folly, Mohammed's Lunacy,
Buddha's Wrong Path, the Hindu Illusion,the Dao Fancy and the Shinto
Nonsense- none with any evidence!

ranjit's contention is not correct.According to Skanda Purana Vishnu
at one time lay asleep on the bosom of Devi, a lotus arose from the
navel, and its attending flower soon reached the sueface of the flood.
Brahma sprang from the flower, and looking around without any creature
on the boundless expanse, imagined himself to be the firstborn. How
funny it is! Hinduism itself is born out of imaginary tales, like
Aesop's fables. The story does not end with Brahma's imagination of
his claim of 'FIRST BORN'. Brahma decided to ascertain whether he was
really the FIRST BORN. He decided to investigate, and he glided down
the stock of the lotus and finding Vishnu asleep. asked loudly who he
was:&quot; I am the first born&quot; answered Vishnu. But Brahma refused to
accept Vishnu's claim, and soon there was a bitter battle between
Brahma and Vishnu. While they were engaged in a deadly fight, Mahadeo
pressed between them in great wrath, saying: &quot;It is I who am truly the
first born.&quot; How ridiculous it is the Hindu Gods fighting among
themselves to get the right of &quot;FIRST BORN.&quot; It is clear from these
incidents that Hindfuism is founded merely on imaginary fables and
stories. Ancient Greek religion was also based on fables. They had
also Gods like Zues, Appollo, and Goddess Athena. But once the Greeks
became intelligent and literate, they realized that their religion was
based on fables and stories. The characters of the Illiad and Odyssey
whom they worshipped as Gods and Goddesses are now in Greek Museum.
Zues and Athena are no more their God and Goddess. But in India the
characters of Ramayana and Mahabharata are still worshipped as Gods
and Goddesses without knowint that these Gods and Goddesses are mere
imaginary characters, like the characters of Illiad and Odyssey.

&gt; Oh good.  I see that you currently have YeshuY2k detail.  :-)

How perceptive of you! Have you also noticed that Christianity itself
is born out of imaginary tales, like Aesop's fables?

Matthew 17:
How did Peter know the names of the figures standing with Jesus? Did
Moses leave his tomb in Moab empty when he came to hang out with Jesus
and did he return to his tomb after the meeting with Jesus? Where was
Elijah living when he was not hanging out with Jesus? Where is Elijah
living now? Why did Peter offer to pitch one tent each for Jesus,
Moses and Elijah? Did he want Moses to remain away from his tomb for
the rest of the night? Do resurrected men need shelter from the
elements? Why not a single tent for all of them? Was Peter afraid they
were fags?

Nope.

Atheists don't believe because there is no evidence.

Christians don't believe because there God commands loyalty.  If they
considered it a matter of evidence, they'd be forced to consider their
own God with such scrutiny.  Clearly, most don't.

Then, the atheist's claim, &quot;the only difference between us is that I
disbelieve in one more god than you do&quot; is incorrect, what?

Ranjit is again confusing facts with fables. Hindu literature itself
shows that Vishnu is a fool. Vishnu Agama says that Akrur was a demon
with the face of a bear, who, nevertheless, was continuously reading
the Vedas and performing acts of devotion. Vishnu was greatly pleased
and promised him any boon that he would care to ask. Akrur requested
that no creature then existing in three worlds, might have power to
deprive him of life, and Vishnu compiled with his request. But the
demon became so insolent that the Devatas, whom he oppressed, were
obliged to conceal themselves. Akrur assumed the dominion of the
world. Vishnu was sitting on a bank of the Kali, greatly disquieted by
the malignant ingratitude of the demon: and his wrath being kindled, a
shape, which never before has existed, sprang from his eyes. It was
Shiva who came to his rescue. Like Aesop's fables, we see imaginary
and fantastic accounts about these Gods in all Hindu literary works.
The rivalry and consequent enmity among these Gods can be seen in all
the works. There are about 3 million Hindu gods and goddesses, every
village having a god like  Chollamadan or a goddess like Isakkiamma..
It is quite apparent that they are primitive tribal gods and goddesses
sprang from imagination. Only after the coming of the British,
European scholars traced philosophical thought behind these imaginary
fables and legends, as they traced philosophical outlook in the
religious fables of ancient Greece and Egypt. While the Greeks and
Egyptians abandoned these legendary gods and goddesses when they
became mature and intelligent, Indians are still worshipping these
legendary characters.
