Does anyone have a boombox so we can follow the Pats game in the

Hey guys,

Here's what happened in the "other" big game last night, for those of
you who were too intoxicated from watching the Patriots (and for the
guy who was in Vegas helping them set the odds for our game).

--------------------

Game Summary:

The Sharpshooters turned back a scrappy challenge from the undermanned
Wave and cruised to a 5-2 victory.

The teams entered the third period tied 2-2 despite the Sharpshooters
holding a 20-7 advantage in shots.  But Steve Williams netted two
quick goals and the Wave never threatened again.

After being held scoreless despite a strong first period performance,
the Sharpshooters took a 2-0 lead in the second period on goals from
Mark Krangle and Dave Swanberry.

The team and its third-string goalie then took the rest of the period
off, allowing the Wave to knot the game, with the equaliser coming
with just 12 ticks left on the clock.

Tommy Walsh scored the final goal for the Sharpshooters.  The team
finished the game with a 39-9 margin on the shot clock.

The win snapped the team's three-game winless streak and lifted the
Sharpshooters back into a second place tie with the Force.

--------------------

Alex Chou is now 1-1 on the season as a goalie....Both teams gave a
loud roar when the rink attendant announced the final score of the
Patriots game, a thrilling 24-21 win over the Chargers.  At the time
of
the opening face-off, the Patriots had the ball at their own 34 with
the game tied at 21 and less than three minutes remaining.
