The experts at iamthewitness.com and www.prisonplanet.com now agree that
there's no reason why America loving radical Islam would do the 9/11 attacks.
First of all, most Islamists can't fly airplanes.  In fact, most Islamists
can't afford an airplane ticket.

It was obviously Da Jews.

So! You confess and admit that you are unable to prove that it wasn't a
conspiracy by the Jews and Bush.

No, I just have more important things to do than to try and have an intelligent

Another ad-hominem attack I see!
Ad-hominem attack is the refuge of unintelligent and immature people that
can't refute an opinion with logic or facts, so they resort to childishly
attacking the person that holds the opinion and knows the facts!

LOL! According to whose mathematics? Is that some dumb "muzzie mathematics"?
Post proof of those 99%! If you come up with more than 10% to think that the
Jews were behind 9/11, post proof, too!
