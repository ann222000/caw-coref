Assuming a UK model,

If you have the controls set to de-mist the front windscreen the A/C
comes on automatically to remove moisture from the incoming air.

One of the radiator cooling fans is part of the A/C circuit

F29  30Amp/Green Engine Cooling Fan (Air Conditioning)
F6    30Amp/Green Engine Cooling Fan (Air conditioning)

These are in the engine compartment fuse box.

The A/C switch goes directly into an electronics module which in turn
derives it's power via 2 fuses in the engine compartment fuse box and 2
on the panel inside the car. My Haynes manual and the UK Ford Owners
handbook disagree on the fuse numbers but anyway removing any one of the
fuses may disable a lot more than just the A/C. (heated screen/trip
computer/air re-circulation motor/ice warning/engine run relay etc.)

Haynes manual F7, F8, (engine compartment) F58 and F36 (behind the glove
box)

Not on earlier cars however.

Earlier than which year?  My 2001 UK model has this feature.

My '99 doesn't :-)

I would hate to have it, and would find a way to disable it if fitted.

I find that using A/C to demist works fine. However, the next time you use
the car, it mists up as soon as you start. It's OK if you remember to turn
the A/C off a few miles before you stop, but I'm not that disciplined. It
sort of defeats the idea of having an automatic system!

One of the few weak spots of the Focus is its heating and ventilating. It's
the worst modern car I've had for misting up. There is a TSB to improve
things, but others have said here that it makes little difference.
