"/> I don't go to website links from newsgroups, you should have posted the
text here. However I don't make offers either. To me, when I ask
someone how much something is, and they say &quot;Make an offer&quot; it is an
insult, as he is hoping that I will say a price that is higher than he
might have asked, and get more money out of me. Anytime one DOES give
an offer, the seller just laughs at you anyway and tells you to keep
walking, or some other insult. I always get the last laugh when I see
the same seller a year later trying to sell the same item.

If I don't see a price ON the item being sold, I don't even bother to go
through the silly game of asking. I assume the item is not for sale and
move to the next table, as if it was for sale, it would have a price tag
on it. I am usually right, as the &quot;sellers&quot; always end up bringing the
items home with them and bring them back for &quot;show&quot; many times for
years.

"/> I really enjoyed the article and my story is just a little different as
this time I was on the other side of the fence...
Years ago, I purchased a 1940's mahogany bedroom suite for an upstairs
bedroom. I don't remember exactly what I paid for it....I know it wasn't
much and it really didn't matter as I wanted it and we used it for a long
time. Well, approx 2 years ago, we decided to redo the bedroom in oak. I
put the bedroom set in a garage sale and priced it $350.00 for the set
(that was a bed, chest of drawers, and dresser). My garage sale came and
went and no one even looked at it! Needless to say, I was very
disappointed as I really wanted a piece of oak to start my new room. I
couldn't understand why no one wanted my little bedroom set....I mean, no
one even looked at it! Anyway, I went to a dealer and asked if she would
be interested. She came and looked at it and asked how much. I didn't
really care...I would have taken $100.00 just to get it out of the house.
I asked her to please &quot;make me an offer&quot; and she replied, &quot;$750.00&quot;.
I sold it.

"/> I'm with you, Judith. I'd prefer not to make offers either on things which I'm
not familiar -- it is often counterproductive and frankly, it makes me
uncomfortable. But occasionally I've been in situations where it has worked to
my advantage when I know the merchandise and I know that the seller doesn't
care much about it. What I do is offer a lowball number and judge their
reaction. In many casees, they take the offer. If they demur, I just then say,
&quot;Well, you gotta give me SOME kind of idea about what you want,&quot; and if they
don't, then I just walk away. Of course all of this depends upon how desirable
the merchandise is. But at least it can start the negotiation ball rolling.

Example: once I was shown a closetful of great vintage clothing at an estate
sale and asked to make an offer on the whole lot. I said, &quot;I dunno, how's $50
for it all?&quot; and they took it -- I eventually cleared more than $1000 on the
clothing (though it took a lot of time and effort.)

A dealer friend of mine taught me to not feel bad about going in with a
lowball number. He said that they often take it (he's right) and it helps at
least put a stake in the ground upon which to base negotiation.

"/> No, because it would actually be taking you MORE time!! It takes
forever for some of these graphic loaded pages to come up on your
screen, only to find out that the idiot posted the address to the HOME
page, and NOT the page containing the item of interest. Now you have to
search and seek all over the bloody website for the information, and
wait for THOSE pages to come up on screen.

Even in YOUR case as explained above, getting the paragragh of test
included in the post, would SAVE time, and be best for EVERYONE. (except
the poster who intended for you to search all over their website, as the
post was mearly bait to get you there, or else they wouldn't post the
address of the HOME page, but rather the page where the info is on!)

"/> Whether one goes to an auction in person, makes one bid (or most times),
several bids or else leaves a bid with the auctioneer or even bids on the
telephone or GOD forbid on the internet, either way or anyways, one is
making &quot;an offer&quot; Maybe you would like to check the meaning of 'bid' ? Most
times, one is not even aware as to what to auctioneer or the owner will
'really' sell the lot for, or if it's reserved, or the pre-sale estimate is
something of a 'vision' the auctioneer had the previous night in bed, or
indeed, one may very well end-up bidding ONLY against the auctioneer.

....... yes, it is most ridiculous to get into a bidding war at auction,
as it is, just as ridiculous, not to ask the price of something, only,
because it doesn't have a price tag attached to it. Any dealer worth
his/her salt should know what they wish to pay (pre-determined) for any
item or any lot that's on offer, of course the trick and the BIG bonus is,
to 'hopefully' get it for less than one is 'really' prepared to pay.

That may not be always possible, but if you don't try (haggle, bid or
offer) then you can't win. Likewise, if you are at auction and a lot is
being knocked down for a 100 when you KNOW its market value could be around
1000, what are you going to do, stand there like a dummy? Let the other guy
get it for a 100 or even 800, when you can bid, maybe get it and make a few
bob or add it to your collection?

I buy a lot of stuff privately, direct from the normal person in the
street, some of these folk may be factory workers, some may be electricians
and other may be university professors, all may well be experts in their
own job or profession, but most times, they are NOT, antiques dealers and a
lot of times don't HONESTLY know what to ask for the item. They may not ask
a price in fear of asking, too much, and scaring the dealer off, they of
course don't ask a price in-case they ask, too little, and the dealer would
have paid more, we all know that, it isn't some mystical secret. Therefore,
I will do exactly what I do at auction or in some other dealer's shop,
doesn't matter if the item is priced or it is not priced - I &quot;BID&quot; them.
With my &quot;best&quot; offer, slightly below my top price of course, the price I
have &quot;pre-determined&quot; that I 'personally' wish to pay. If they accept my
offer well and good, if we haggle a bit that's OK and in fact, if we do
HAGGLE that will kind a brighten my day quite a bit, after all, I'm, a
dealer :) At the end of the day, if they don't take my offer, then I walk
away, no hard feeling no big loss. It's much the same if they DO ask me a
price, that price could be too high, or a little too high, or maybe just
right either way, I doubt very much I'm going to be giving them the FIRST
price that comes out their mouth.

I don't think we should say &quot;never&quot; look what happen to Sean Connery, and I
certainly don't think one should cut off one nose to spite one face. The
day you buy is the day you sell. :)

I'm going to share a secret with you folks that my dear departed grandmother (
who was also my boss &amp; mentor ) used to use in a standoff situation with people
who had merchandise for sale that they didn't know what to ask for it or even
if they really wanted to sell it. ( This is assuming it's something you really
want. ) Tell the seller we're going to play a little game, get 2 pieces of
paper &amp; give one to the seller &amp; you keep one. Now tell the seller to write a
price on the paper that would make them happy &amp; you write your price that your
willing to offer &amp; keep them hidden. Now tell the seller we'll both reveal our
prices &amp; if mine is higher than yours you will sell the piece to me at my price
if not than the deal is off &amp; you can say thank you &amp; leave. Then flip the
papers &amp; see what happens. Now even if your price is not higher than theirs at
least you have an idea of what price this person is thinking &amp; may lead to
further negotiations or you may run out of the house screaming ! At minimum
you have gotten the seller to commit to something &amp; started the negotiation
process. Besides people love games &amp; will usually play along. This is part of
the legacy I pass on from Carrie Ruggles may she RIP. David

Ok, I've read all these threads and I think I've learned the following:
As a dealer, we don't make an offer to buy something because &quot;maybe&quot; the
person really doesn't want to sell it and we would end up just giving a
free appraisal.
We don't make an offer because maybe the person selling will take their
item to someone else who gives them more.
We don't make an offer because maybe we could have gotten the item for
practically nothing because the poor dummy trying to sell it didn't know
what it was worth.
I guess I'm the dummy because I always felt if someone offered to sell
me something I would tell them what I could pay for it and still make
the profit that I felt necessary to continue on in business. If they
decided to take it somewhere else, so what. I have lost nothing and in
many cases have ended up with a nice item to sell. Granted I never
ended up with $1000.00 worth of merchandise for $50.00, but I still did
just fine. The one thing I did do on occasion was tell the seller that
my offer was only good at that time, not later and I'm sure in some
cases this encouraged them to sell to me rather than take a chance and
shop around.

"/> Bravo ! Carol Millar. You have earned the admiration and utmost respect
from me for your note. I guess I'm a big dummy also because I try to operate
with a similar procedure as yours. I would much rather offer someone a fair
value for their antique and hope they will return with more to sell me. If I
give them the $50.00 for their $1,000.00 value item and they leave and see an
identical item as theirs at another shop or mall I don't believe they will
return. Unless to let me know they think I'm a crook and they will tell all
of their friends ect., ect.
I was give this unwanted advice when I started in business about 5 years ago
from a couple of dealers... &quot; Have the customer tell you what he/she wants
because otherwise you may offer more than they had wanted in the first
place...&quot; It kind of follows your third reason for not making offers which I
think most dealers apply but will not admit to it.
Having said this, let me also say I'm sure none of our dealers would ever take
advantage of any one in this manner.
Again , very refreshing note Carol.

David -

The version I heard is this - the seller shows his price. If the Dealer's
number is higher, he shows and pays the higher amount. If the dealer's
number is lower, he never shows it, thus avoiding the 'free appraisal'.

I've never used this. I only occasionally make an offer, because of the
ridiculous expectations of some people about 'Grandma's dishes'.

I never ask about unpriced items I see at shows. I guess I may have missed out
on a lot of great deals, but I always expect the dealers price to be on an
item. I feel at an unfair advantage somehow, revealing to the dealer that the
item interests me enough to ask its price. But at garage sales when I find an
unmarked item I like, I make an offer without even asking the price. In that
case, I figure the person either overlooked it or didn't know what to ask, so I
just make an offer.
In the case of online items where either no price is given or they state &quot;make
me an offer&quot;, in most cases I ignore such posts. I agree that lots of time the
person is looking for an appraisal and I have been in situations where I ended
up bidding on something against some unknown and possibly nonexistant person
and ended up feeling used. Since ebay came along there is no need to get
involved in such blind auctions.

So glad to hear that there's someone else out there who refuses
to ask price on &quot;unpriced&quot; show items!! When I go to a large
antique show, my time is worth something &amp; in the time I am try-
ing to run down a dealer for a price, I could have looked at &amp;
maybe bought 5 priced items!

&gt;to ask price on &quot;unpriced&quot; show items!! When I go to a large
&gt;antique show, my time is worth something &amp; in the time I am try-
&gt;ing to run down a dealer for a price, I could have looked at &amp;
&gt;maybe bought 5 priced items!

&gt;Leota

"/> Here's the &quot;flip side&quot;

At almost EVERY antique show we sell at, someone brings me
an item with NO sticker and asks &quot;how much?&quot; All of my
items are priced (I check while I'm setting up to make sure that
everything has a clean and proper price tag and I retag all
items that need one.) And....those &quot;missing&quot; price tags turn
up in the most curious places (stuck on another item, dropped
on the floor/ground, stuck on a tablecloth, etc.) Some of the
items brought to me have obviously had the sticker torn off
(there's residue of the paper) -- and it's obvious that the
sticker just didn't fall off.

Since I always have my notebook computer with me, all I have
to do is let them watch me check the sales price. And I let them
watch me put a new tag ON the item.

Do they ever buy the item? Nope.
Do they make a counter-offer? Nope.
They're hoping, obviously, for a &quot;guesstimate&quot; -- and since
the tag is immediately replaced, it's obvious that my selling
price IS my selling price (and my prices are quite reasonable.)

So...what I'm saying is: It's not always the dealer who's
responsible for unmarked items. Items at shows undergo a
lot of looking, prodding, poking and my Adventures Of The
Missing Tags makes me ASK the dealer if they know the
tag is gone and if I'm interested, I do ask.

What is all this Dealer vs Seller stuff?! What about a PERSON who wants
to buy something for his own pleasure?!

All this talk of buying and reselling means you people are buying things
you don't really WANT, and are taking it away from the people who would
like to have the item in their home.

You people shouldn't assume that only dealers are on here. It is not
rec.antiques.dealers Some of us do not like hearing about how you are
ripping us private collectors off.

"/> Don't worry, there are PLENTY of us who don't ask on unpriced items!!
If it doesn't have a tag on it, it means the seller is EMBARRASSED of
what he is asking for the item, or knows it is much higher than what the
item is worth.

Same goes for catalogs in the mail in which every item is listed as
&quot;call for price&quot;. How long would it take for everyone to call in and
waste an hour or more each to get the price for every item in the
catalog? JUST PRINT THE PRICES IN THE #$%^&amp;@# CATALOG YOU #$%$&amp;&amp;^@S!!

"/> Why would someone rip off the price tag and leave the item on the
shelf?? This is silly. And if someone ripped off the price and brought
it to the front trying to see if he could get a lower price on it, the
store owner would have put a new price tag back on it before putting it
back, so this theory does not fly.

Prices are not put on certain items, because the seller wants more than
the item is worth, and if it was displayed, everyone would just walk by
the item and never buy it. THIS way, the customer has to bring the item
up and ASK, and then the seller hopes the customer feels intimidated and
can be talked into buying the item. They never just tell you the price
and leave it at that, they have to get into a big conversation, that
when it is over, you could have been through the whole store and on your
way to the next one.

was getting way too long.)

Just ONCE I left the pricetag OFF the item, after it had been
obviously removed. It proved to be the most popular item
in my booth. I had many questions about the price -- and
since I'd bought it at a terrific price, I answered with a price that was

about 50% of what it had been marked. Still no buyers.

I really think the ONLY correct answer would have been &quot;Aw,
I don't know - how about fifty cents?&quot;

On day 2 of the antique show, I put the correct price back
on it and it sold within an hour. Go figure.

BTW, it wasn't junk. It was a nice piece of (real) cobalt
carnival glass.

to buy it at all. Look my friend ;) I'm a dealer and a _collector_ and a
damn _serious_ collector at that, but at the same time I make no apologies
for being a dealer, it's what puts the bread in my family's mouth and feeds
my 'habit' of collecting, but it's a job, don't you have a job and don't
you get paid for that job?- Do you think we dealers are all prostitutes?
.wise-up! Some of the best collections I see, are DEALERS collections, and
most dealers started off originally as collectors. Geez, you must have one
hell of collection and a MOUNTAIN of stuff, do you NEVER, have you NEVER,
sold, swapped or part-exchanged anything that you have privately collected?
The dealers you buy from, I assume you buy from dealers, how do they get
their stuff, or maybe they just find it lying around some place? Perhaps
you've had a bad experience with &quot;dealers&quot; - so have I, so has many other
folk, dealers, non-dealers and &quot;private collectors&quot; but don't judge all
dealer the same, I don't nor doest most folk, the business is to complex
and has many aspects. The dealer needs the collector, but the collector
needs the dealer every bit as much, and for what it's worth, MUCH of the
information posted to this ng comes from the dealers you appear to
mis-trust and hold in such low esteem.

The antique business doesn't work like the local branch of Marks and
Spencers ...... God forbid it should ever work like that, and as for, we
dealers ripping off private collectors. ROTFBAGASLOL. ;)

plenty of people putting grandpa's old stuff in the landfill instead of selling

We all have to make a living somehow. Most the dealers I know (myself included)
love their jobs. Most also work long hours looking for just the right items to
stock their shops, staying at auctions all day to acquire just the right things
so their customers will get a chance to purchase items they normally would not
have even seen. They search for particular items to complete a customer's
collection, and occasionally make someone's day.

If you care to buy for pleasure, Dr. Bellows, that's wonderful. I do it much
too often myself. If you feel you are getting ripped off by a dealer, the
solution is simple; don't buy from them.

If it's a flame war you're after, I'm sure you can get it here, but that's not
very productive.

Maybe a better idea would be to share some stories about your particular field
of interest.

When I come across a booth that has many items unmarked, I never
first pick up the piece that I am interested in. I pick up
several items around it and ask their prices. I then pick up the
piece that I'm interested in. This way, they don't know which
item it is that you are interested in.

"/> Dr. Bellows,
When I wrote the article about not making offers, it was meant as a
statement of a viewpoint that evolved after several like experiences
from prospective sellers. It was certainly not intended as a treatise
against dealers, collectors or any other group. Generalization is the
refuge of those whose arguments are weak.

It seems to me that you've spent the ensuing few days taking on all
comers, lashing out at dealers in particular. Why the chip on the
shoulder? It take all kinds to make a world. We have a wonderful
opportunity here, for a worldwide forum, a place to exchange ideas and
information in an atmosphere of fellowship. Wouldn't you get more out
of it with an open mind?

I'll never ignore a piece with no tag on it if it's something I would

I don't care, though, for the shops or booths with unmarked merchandise
where the proprietor is never close by.

At the one and only flea market on sundays in my area, almost nothing is
marked. If you are not prepared to ask a price, you might as well not attend.
I see no problem with this. If it is more than I want to spend, I say Thanks
and walk away. Quite often it is less than what I had expected or would have
paid. I have not yet been asked by any dealer there to make an offer nor
attempted to haggle on the price. They are, by and large, a reasonable lot and
I have picked up some great bargains! Carole.

I hope one of you can help me. Recently, I acquired an old, round ice
cream parlor table, approximately 40 inches high, that had been sitting
upside down for at least 50 years in the loft of what used to be a drug
store. It has black wrought iron legs that are twisted just above where
the feet sit on the floor. The top is made of what I believe to be maple,
and is visible in many places through worn, green paint. I merely cleaned
it with a mild detergent and water, wanting to preserve the table in the
condition in which I found it. After flaking off many years of petrified,
chewed gum that had been stuck to the underside of the table, I attempted
to read the writing (looks like a stencil) that is barely visible there.
My problem is that, since the table was stored top-down, the underside of
the table-top is blackened with dust and age (the underside of the table
has no finish; paint or otherwise), and any writing is illegible. I'm
reluctant to use any cleaner, even water, because I'm afraid that it will
remove the markings there.

Does anyone know of a way that I might safely remove the dirt, revealing
the writing there, so that I can find out more about my table? Also, if
you have any information regarding pieces like this, I'd greatly
appreciate it.

By the way, in the same loft, I also found a very old certificate,
reading, &quot;...a License to conduct the business of Pharmaceutist,
Apothecary and Druggist...&quot;, dated December 15, 1875. The frame was, at
one time, gilded, and is in remarkably good condition, with no cracks,
breaks or scratches in the glass. The back of the frame is three pieces
of wood, held in place with several, very small square nails. Can anyone
offer me any information concerning a piece like this? I'm not interested
in selling either my table or the framed certificate, and I'm not an
antique dealer, or even a diehard collector. I simply know what I like,
and have a varied &quot;eclectic&quot; collection of mish-mosh.

Thanks for any assistance you may be able to offer.

are so dense that they think, &quot;Gee, this person isn't really interested and
thinks this is a piece of junk so I better lower my price&quot;? Not in your
wildest dreams.

Got news for y'a .. been there done that .. then grew-up and wised-up. ;)

then stop making a fool of yourself at his booth, he's only laughing up his
sleeve at you, and I'll bet, when you walk away from his stand at the show,
he and the dealer on the stand next door, has a damn good chuckle at your

I never thought that a dealer is a half wit cause I am on that
side of the fence also. But like most of us, we must walk on the
other side of the fence. I also must admit, that I also have a
good chuckle when I walk away from their booth with my money
still in my pocket.I have been in booths where the item wasn't
marked and picked up the piece and asked its price. I then
promptly put it down. After some time has passed, I send my wife
over to the booth and she asks the items price. I can't tell you
how many many times, the price was much lower than I was quoted.
You can't believe the chuckle I get .

If its true that most dealers started as collectors, did you have to fight

last weekend. One dealer had a box of small mostly junk dolls thrown together
on a table. As I looked through it, I found a Winking Heidi doll from the
1960s. She is hard to find in working condition, as this one was, and all she
needed was some cleaning up. I didn't want the dealer to know that I
recognized the only decent doll in the box, so I picked up a dollhouse doll
that was in poor condition and asked how much she was asking for them. Well,
the first dealer told me the Heidi was $5 and had to consult with her partner
for the price on the dollhouse doll. The second dealer took a little time to
answer, and after giving the other dealer a funny look, said $5 (way too much
based on the condition the 2nd doll was in). I don't think she knew what she
was going to ask and based her price on what the other dealer had asked.
Anyway, I gladly paid the $5 for the WH, knowing I'd have to pay at least $20
if I found her on ebay and passed up on the dollhouse doll, as I had intended.
I don't think I was being silly here, I just wanted them to think I was a
casual shopper instead of a collector looking for a particular doll. But now
that I think about it, chances are she would have been $5 whether I asked about
her individually or together.

:::shaking head::::

Your question is very bizarre. As a part time antiques dealer and I buy and
resell at a profit all the time. Does it shock you that people in this
business shop for merchandise at estate sales?

You certainly could have gone in there and made the same deal. And what makes
you believe that I priced it out of the range of most people? For the record,
when I sold the merchandise, I ended up selling it to other dealers for 1/3 of
the estimated retail price of each item. Certainly within the price range of
most buyers. Even the estimated full retail prices were reasonable -- between
$15 and $45, so....you're pretty much off base with your comment.

And, if I didn't WANT the merchandise, I wouldn't have bid on it.

By the way, as a vintage clothing lover, I did keep and wear several pieces
that fit me, but most of them weren't my size.

NO!! ......... it doesn't become easier to part with things, that's why
many dealers houses are stuffed to the door with things they can't bear to
part with, and many times much of their own stuff would be so EASY to sell,
because much of it was bought MANY years ago and the profit can sometimes
be huge. A dealer doesn't STOP becoming a collector when he/she decides to
start selling, can some folk start to understand maybe the ONLY reason the
&quot;most&quot; of us started to deal in the first place (buy and sell) was to feed
the habit and passion to collect. We're not car-sales men or vacuum reps,
have you any idea or notion why we do this?.... and a BIG clue .... it
isn't for the money, what bloody money? :)

I'll ask about a price if I see something I want without a tag. But the

&gt;&gt; I have to agree with kris on this one. I spend hours every day
&gt;&gt; replacing price tags on items. But some of them come off because of age
&gt;&gt; or dusting the glue dries up especially on the easy to remove tags I use
&gt;&gt; to not damage paper or lithos.

&gt; Might it not be a bad idea to take a second look at the price on your

"/>  Bruce, When you have your own place and the tags fall off because of
age you do have to reassess your price. I have found that I usually
priced the item too low giving the impression that it's a repro or
repaired. I had a set of seated bowls by homer laughlin in perfect
condition that set on the shelf for months at $125.00. Lots of people
looking at them but no buyers. I lowered the price to $85.00 same thing.
I knew these were worth at least $250.00 so I raised the price to
$195.00 and the next week got an offer of $175.00 and sold them. Strange
but great business this is. Olio's

A couple of sundays ago, I went with my friend to the flea market to look
for bargains, antiques and whatnot. We took along her seven year old son.
Many of the tables there are junk tables, filled with cheap toys and bric a
brac and occasionally something worthwhile. Well of course, the seven year old
immediately zoomed in on the toys at every table and then came upon a spinning
top (or do all tops spin, I don't know), a piece of plastic junk really, that
he absoluteley had to have.

My friend asked the dealer how much they were and was told they were
$1.00. She decided to wait just a little while, having every intention of
getting him &quot;something&quot; with the idea in mind that he might see something he
liked better.

About an hour passed and all we were hearing was about this wonderful top
and he would not stop so we went back to the booth to buy it for him. When my
friend went to pay the dollar, the gentleman that had quoted the price turned
to a young girl who in turn went in search of her mother. When she came back
she said something to him and he told us that the top was going to be $2.00.
Did the price go up because she was actually going to buy it with real money
showing? I politely told him that he had quoted us $1.00 earlier. &quot;I just
work here&quot; was his response. (I have heard this before, but didn't think
people actually &quot;said&quot; it.)

Needless to say, we walked away and later found the identical item. She
ended up paying $1.50 and the child broke the toy before we left.

Anyway, this is just one example. There are a lot of dealers there who are
more than fair and I have been bringing home items at quite reasonable prices
and then seeing them auctioned off and selling at about a 200% mark-up on
E-bay.

Bottom line, I don't try and cheat them and I think it's pretty obvious
when they are trying to cheat me so I can choose to do business with them or
not. There are all sorts of people in this world, dealers among them, and one
has to treat each person and each situation accordingly. To lump all sellers
or all buyers into any one catagory does not do the good people justice. But
to be fair to everyone (unless provoked into battle) has its rewards. What
goes around does come around; it just takes so damn long sometimes.

he' happy and I'm happy it's been a good deal all round, and next time it
might be me for the big profit.

Couldn't see the general &quot;antiques&quot; buying public behaving like that, or
would they?

I read all this anti-dealer and &quot;we don't buy if it isn't priced&quot; as these
people having bad experiences with bad dealers, and then painting with a
big bush on the subway wall &quot;all dealers are in it for the money, and out
to rip everybody else off&quot; What some of these folk want to do is to talk to
the dealer see if he/she shares the same passion for &quot;collecting&quot; as they
&quot;do&quot; not walk past, act disinterested and not speak because something isn't
priced.

So what more important the piece or the price?

&gt; so their customers will get a chance to purchase items they normally would not

I have been trying to stay out of this thread, since everyone has gotten so
emotional, but my self-control has ebbed so here I am commenting too.

I consider myself a collector and I suspect there are many others like me who
are in this newsgroup, learning from the more experienced, including the
dealers. I buy things I like and display them at my home. When I first
started, I bought less expensive things, and sometimes things that were in less
than perfect condition. As time has passed, I have collected more and space
has become a constraint. (How many cream and sugar sets does one have room for
after all?) Also, sometimes I have found things I wanted in box lots at
auctions with other items, leaving me with 12-15 other items in the box lot
that I didn't want plus the fewer things I did want.

So, on 2-3 occasions a few years ago, I shared a booth at a flea market with a
friend to sell off some of the things at the lower end of my collection (e.g.,
damaged items I had replaced with better examples) and things I didn't want.
That didn't disrupt my collection, it improved it. On occasion, some of my
selling prices were as low (and in at least one case lower) than what I had
paid, since I was chiefly trying to get rid of stuff. But I will confess to
making a profit on a couple of items, and don't feel bad about it either.

Having thus given you enough background about me to avoid the condemnation of
dealers that pervades this thread, I must say that I respectfully disagree with
that attack. I do feel wistful when I see things I like priced high by
dealers. And I am as appalled at the Beanie Baby racket as anyone.

But I also recognize that I do not have time to go from estate sale to garage
sale to flea market all the time as I once did, and if it weren't for dealers
scouting for things, I would be able to buy even fewer of the things I like.
So antique dealers make a profit ... that's what capitalism is all about. I
am thankful for the dealers who shop garage sales in California or wherever,
and puts items on ebay so that I can buy them from my computer in NY. I
wouldn't get them otherwise.

And, by creating a larger market for antiques, dealers create an incentive for
people to safeguard rather than destroy their old things. After all, what is
treasure to someone may be junk to someone else. Especially for, say, paper
items (old advertising, letters, postcards, or whatever else people collect),
without a market-based incentive to value those things, the owners may just
toss the stuff in the garbage, destroying it forever. There won't necessarily
be a true collector of any given item at any given garage sale.

Well, I know I won't have persuaded Dr. Bellows, but at least I've gotten this
off my chest. But Dr. Bellows, don't flee the newsgroup. We need all sorts of
folks here, and I for one don't consider you a troll, just someone with very
strong divergent opinions.

the way most new merchandise is offered to the public.

Antiques have already gone through this process. People have bought
them and owned them. When owners want to sell them, there will be eager
buyers who want to use them or add them to collections, and there will
be dealers who want to buy them to resell at a profit. The former
doesn't necessarily need the latter, but the latter certainly needs the
former as customers.

I think I understand the emotion on both sides of this issue, but (as a
non-dealer) tend to lean toward Dr Bellows' view, as unrealistic as it
may be.

&gt; No no no... you are missing the point. If you didn't buy all the stuff

"/> Lets say you hold an estate sale on any given weekend in any given town. It's
unrealistic to assume that if no dealers came, the whole estate would be sold to
collectors and go to it's &quot;proper&quot; home. The logistics just don't allow any
collector to be at every single sale that may have something they want. The
person selling the estate relies upon dealers to buy most of the items so the
estate can be sold within a given period of time. After all, they're not opening
a store here, they just have one or two weekends to clear out a houseful.

I am a collector. And as a collector I am very thankful for the dealers who
search out what I'm looking for and make it easy for me to find. I'm also glad
those dealers don't fall in love with it, because if they did, I'd never get it!

I am also a dealer. I'm a dealer because I truly love antiques. I love helping
to preserve little bits of history. I always wonder who touched these items
before me and what their life was like. And I must admit I sometimes feel like
I'm running an adoption agency, helping that lonely goblet find a new home in a
lovely china cabinet. So there's all the gushy stuff, and I sometimes make a
profit too. What could be better? A chance to do something that you love,
support your own collecting habit, and make a little money, all at the same time.

Getting off the soapbox now...

Congratulations.....great thread....lot's of people sharing their opinion.... after all
this is a discussion group, right? Too bad no opinions so far have matched
your's....does that give you a clue? Strange isn't it, when we start to think the world
is wrong it it doesn't agree with us and we are right.....don't they have a clinical
name for people that just won't accept the fact that their thinking is flawed. Why
don't you start your own newgroup....call it &quot;Collectors That Agree With Me.&quot; By the
way, I hope what you collect is at least 50 years old....if got you don't belong in this
discussion group, of course we have a lot of people that stumble in but don't belong but
it doesn't take the majority of them too long to figure it out..

Have a nice day Dr. Bellows

"/> What gets me ..... where does &quot;Dr.Bellows&quot; acquire or buy (although

that no-one on God earth has, so far, made a profit from or inflated the
price for poor old Dr.Bellows.

Not from antique shops, not from malls, and it would appears due to the
current de-cry of E-Bay not there either. At auction perhaps, but then
obviously, ONLY if the lot is a non-dealer lot, that's puzzling too, how
would one know the sources of all the lots. Not on the internet as
Dr.Bellows doesn't link to www sites, doesn't buy from dealers, malls etc
etc etc etc ...... &lt;YAWN&gt;

Surely not from other collectors, how would there be any guarantee that the
stuff didn't originally come from a dealer and the said collector, god
forbid, was selling to Dr.Bellows at a profit and not passing it no at
loss, as obviously it's bound to be over-inflated.

So what does this leave? - car boot sales, yard sales, where else? or yes
from PRIVATES that must be it, but only from privates when the stuff didn't
originate from a dealer, yes all privates are honest with that information,
and it's all been sitting there since the day it was made, at which time of
course it was made for charity and given away free to the crying wee'ns of
these folk's fore bearers. Heavens I gone blank, where else do we dealers
get stuff? - or yes the skips, the dump, other folk's trash cans, and
stolen goods yea we're big on that as well. That's it!!!! god no wonder I'm
a crap dealer, wish I had Dr.Bellows sources. No I didn't mention, being in
a mudding field at day-break, in the back of beyond, standing in the
pissing rain with a flash-lamp in one mouth whilst at the same trying to
look at something, that isn't priced, hoping to buy for ones 'private
collection'. Didn't mention it for obvious reasons.

Oh yes, forgot knew there was another source, we dig it up, out of the
ground, with one of those 'antique seeking devices' that companies sell for
free to half-wits that go around destroying the country-side and ancient
sites, in search of the holy grail, and then get pissed when the State
won't pay them money for most of the crap they unearth, or take it off them
(and a bloody good job too) because it AIN'T their to start off with.

Hey, shit, now I know why Dr.Bellows the Private Collection never makes
offers, nor interested in stuff that isn't priced, he the sort of person
that loves to get something worth a 1000 pounds for a tenner at the expense
and mercy or everyone else around. Bet you just love little old ladies?

Dear Dr. Bellows (what an appropriate name),
Please don't threaten us with leaving. If you can't stand the heat
or opinions,just hit the road.
A piece of trivia: when you leave your home and venture out into the
world for the day,the word that you will see most (by a 10 to 1 ratio)
is SALE. It's everywhere and without it,the economy would collapse and
everyone would just DIE and that's the truth.
I have a shop that is open 2 days a week (Sat. &amp; Sun.) or 8 days a
month. I passed by an older couples outside daily table (rented for $11
a day by anyone) (like boot sales for the U.K.) on both days for two
weekends and had looked at their items but not bought anything Approx.
25,000 others had walked past these same tables in two weekends. On the
4th day (2nd Sun.) I purchased a small 5&quot;X8&quot; picture marked $10 that
they told me I could have for $8 (without my asking) and while wrapping
it, stated that &quot;NO-ONE was buying anything&quot; and how disappointed they
were. I took this 'picture' and priced it $75 and hung it in my shop for
2 months while researching the signature. I sent it off to Weschler's
where it sold for $975 (it was a mid 19th cent. oil on panel) WHERE WERE
THE COLLECTORS (both in my shop and for the old couple)?
I went to an contempory house auction (held in the yard,bring your
own chair) and one of the items was an old Atlas with the cover
detached,
I bid $20 and NO-ONE else bid. I duct taped the cover back on and
shipped it off to an online auction where a 'collector' or dealer
thought enough of it to pay $1210.00 for it. WHERE WERE THE COLLECTOR'S
and what were the other dealers present waiting for at the auction?
Buying and re-selling makes the world go around. Stop whining and
grow up...... IMO
I hope that you decide to stay here to offer an different view, but
if the odds here scare you, go seek safe haven elsewhere. It's been
nice.

Jeeeeeeeeeez!

I'm strictly a collector who sometimes finds great deals and at other
times pays in excess of the actual worth of an item....it's part of the
process. I ALWAYS acknowledge that a certian percentage of the sellers
price includes a &quot;fee&quot; for finding, transporting, storing and maybe even
researching the item for me.

It's a GREAT BIG WORLD - if I'm unhappy with the state of affairs, it is
MY responsibility to go find my own solutions without blaming others for
my unhappiness.

If you collect rare and unusual items, be prepared to pay. If you don't
need the assistance of the large and varied group of dealers, do the work
yourself!

If what you collect is not rare or unusual, well then...........

customer at LOW price (including trade ins) and resold at a HIGHER price, or
they're bought in quantity at auction and resold at a HIGHER price. Sound
familiar? At least with antiques, auctions aren't closed to the general public
as they are with cars.

because of the business they're in and are willing to share it for others. FREE.

Some collectors also buy antiques as INVESTMENTS to be resold later. What
nasty label would you call those people?

I'm sorry, your argument threads, plus the incredulous fact that you didn't
believe customers remove price tags from items makes me see that you are
amazingly naive about the way the world works. You were upset at the reaction
people had to your comments here, but if you look back, you initiated this
discussion with very provocatory and nasty insinuations. What did you expect?
You won't catch flies with vinegar.

First off even though I may be blunt, do not consider this a flame...(I've
just gone through these scenarios as an individual way too many time...)
I'm referring to the below comments as if they were made at a mall antique
show. (Which may be different in context as the original poster wanted...)

&gt; Ok, I've read all these threads and I think I've learned the following:
&gt; As a dealer, we don't make an offer to buy something because &quot;maybe&quot; the
&gt; person really doesn't want to sell it and we would end up just giving a
&gt; free appraisal.

"/> So what? Any appraisal worth its salt is in 'writing' so it can be used
for reference and include the qualifications of the dealer making the
statement. Without this, a verbal appraisal is nothing more than a
'guesstimate.'

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We don't make an offer because maybe the person selling will take their
&gt; item to someone else who gives them more.

"/> This could mean you didn't know the market for the item as well as the
next dealer...the other dealer already has a buyer ready for the item...or
your price was far below what would be considered 'reasonable' to the
seller.

It seems to me many dealers feel insulted when their offers aren't taken.
Somehow it's looked upon as a blow to their 'professionalism.' Which is
interesting because usually these same dealers think nothing about the
sellers feelings when they scoff, turn around, and raise a hand while
saying, &quot;Oh that's way too much, not interested.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We don't make an offer because maybe we could have gotten the item for
&gt; practically nothing because the poor dummy trying to sell it didn't know
&gt; what it was worth.

"/> Welp, you would have lost me as a customer. The point of being a dealer is
to make a living off of selling items which include a 'fair markup.'
Taking advantage of someone's lack of education seems somehow morally
wrong.

If you buy an item for $5 and it's worth $3000...and the seller finds out
he more or less screwed himself...you think he'll suggest you to his
friends? Not likely. Dealing fairly with an individual can have benifits
far beyond the bottom line of your bank statement.

Case in point: I go around comic book shows with a bag full of books to
sell/trade. One dealer pointed me to a gentleman who had some old Westerns
for sale. No one wanted them because no one deals in Western book around
here. So, I go out to the man's car to look at the box full. Previously,
the man was only offered 25 to 50 cents a book...and was quite surprised
when I told them these Golden Age (1950's) books in FN+ to NM condition
were worth at least $20 each. Overall, the man had $3000 worth of books.
Needless to say, I didn't have nearly enough to give a fair offer...but
did buy 3 of them for my own collection at 50% of guide value.

I gave him the name of a dealer I knew who would like them, and included
my own contact info in case he had any more questions. A week later I
recieved a check from the seller for 10% of what he sold them as
commission. He said he knew I didn't ask for any money and appreciated my
help. Plus there was names and phone numbers for two of his friends also
wanting to sell books.

Without playing fairly with this gentlemen I wouldn't have been able to
include almost 75 books in my collection. (It has been over four years now
and I'm still getting contacts due to this initial response.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I guess I'm the dummy because I always felt if someone offered to sell
&gt; me something I would tell them what I could pay for it and still make
&gt; the profit that I felt necessary to continue on in business. If they
&gt; decided to take it somewhere else, so what. I have lost nothing and in
&gt; many cases have ended up with a nice item to sell. Granted I never
&gt; ended up with $1000.00 worth of merchandise for $50.00, but I still did
&gt; just fine.

"/> You're not a dummy. It's called 'moral fiber.' :D

The one thing I did do on occasion was tell the seller that

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; my offer was only good at that time, not later and I'm sure in some
&gt; cases this encouraged them to sell to me rather than take a chance and
&gt; shop around.

"/> This I disagree with. If a dealer tells me his offer is no good once I
leave, I always leave. The little warning lights inside my head begin to
go off while a little voice tells me, &quot;He wants me to sell this before I
go to the next dealer who has it in his display case for 5x what he's
offering.&quot; ;)

Another Case in Point: An antique dealer had comic books for 3x as much as
they were worth. (Hey...when using Overstreet's price guide...the Good
price is for Good condition books...it doesn't mean that's the lowest
price people are paying ! :P) They said I could buy the books for what
they're worth if I bought the whole box. I said I'd consider it which gave
me, &quot;Well once you leave, blah, blah, blah...&quot; (Oh, BTW...they were marked
up 3x because, &quot;Well, those are show prices.&quot; *grumble* not going to get
on that topic...just not going to do it.)

Needless to say, at the end of the show the dealers flagged me down and
wondered when I was going to buy the books. &quot;Well, how much lower are you
going to go?&quot; Both seemed surprised that I would want a cheaper discount
than their actual value. &quot;Why not? If you still have them that means you
can't sell them...and so they're really worth less than what you want.&quot;

Both their jaws dropped. (The reason for this was simple. Earlier they
used that exact line on a woman selling dishes. Because she still had them
an hour later, the dealers implied she wanted too much. (It, of course,
had nothing to do with the fact that they were the only dealers that
weekend with china for sale.) Upon pulling out a price guide the seller
was informed how it was 'only a guide...market values fluctuate...&quot; She
finally sold them for about 25% less than what she wanted.)

After hearing a 'we're dealers we know what things are worth' and a 'we've
been in this business since Jesus built his first sand castle&quot; a just
walked away. What a hopeless cause.

"/> I'm totally baffled by this point you've repeatedly pounded home.
How do dealers prevent collectors from buying at the same sales??
When I had my own business for 8 years and was free to get up
before dawn and go stand in line at estate sales, I had every bit
as much of a chance to buy as the dealers. In fact, that's where
I met some of my dealer friends.

Your previous statement holds no water, either. I've found some
*great* items on the second day of a sale, after dozens of dealers
have been through a house. Maybe they missed those items. Maybe
they don't deal in those types of things. Whatever, but regardless,
I don't know why you think dealers are the only ones who can get
up early and are the only ones who can buy at estate sales, auctions,
etc. It's just not logical.

&gt; you are the only OTHER collector on here besides me! Perhaps I will
&gt; find one of your OTHER posts where I find out you are just a reseller
&gt; like everyone ELSE here!

"/> I've already read your apology for leaping to this conclusion.
It is this sort of blatant emotionalism that gets people labeled
trolls. Usually trolls make points STRONGLY (you know, with
liberal use of all-capped words) and make many accusations, instead
of simply discussing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> You complain that no one is listening to your viewpoint. Numerous
people have stated a different opinion in a very reasonable,
nonadversarial manner, yet you persist in ranting about this
as if it were some huge conspiracy.

You've made your point. No one's saying a variety of opinions
isn't wanted on r.a. You just seem to be unhappy that there's
not much support for yours so you keep restating it...over and
over and over. What makes a truly good discussion or even a debate
is when the participants support their position with facts. I've
yet to see any with your name attached.

&gt; To show that I am not the &quot;evil monster&quot; that everyone here is making me
&gt; out to be, I did the research, and you appear to be just a collector,
&gt; shopping at dealers for yourself, mostly post cards, and even said in
&gt; one post something to the regards of &quot;that in the unlikely event that
&gt; you would sell any&quot;

"/> I don't recall seeing anyone accusing you of being an &quot;evil monster.&quot;
I will say, however, that if you have time to track down all my
posts, maybe you should consider becoming a dealer, to use up
some of that spare time you seem to have. :)

I'm beginning to wonder if your last name has anything to do with
the device that is used to fan flames. Just a wild guess.
