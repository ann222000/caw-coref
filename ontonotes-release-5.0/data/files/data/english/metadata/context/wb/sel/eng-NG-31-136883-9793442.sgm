Well, yeah, you can &quot;always do more&quot; but not always until you excel --
sometimes it's until you overdo it.  The article seems to presume that those
who aren't winning are allowing their mind to limit themselves, whereas it's
often the case that the mind doesn't restrict one enough and one over
exerts.  The anecdotes selected for the story are about those who applied
willpower to extend themselves, but I'm sure the writer would have had no
problem finding just as many anecdotes of those whose minds allowed them to
burn out too soon.

To me, it's searching for that balance and working with the variant bits
that makes sport interesting.  Even if I know *on average* my optimum heart
rate and muscle output over 54.7 miles (or whatever the course is), there
are plenty of other variables to leave enough doubt in my mind so that I'm
never 100% certain for any *particular* effort.

When you get *real* good, your mind does not even limit your equipment!

Oh, man, the entire office is wondering why I'm laughing so hard!  That's
wild!

Their dissociation trick often works.  When an attack goes in a race, you often have to go all out to just stay on.  If you get dropped, your race is basically over.  In such a situation, I fixate on the rear wheel of the guy ahead of me, and I WILL IT to come back to me.  Not me to go faster, but the wheel to come back.  Almost always works.

Oh, yeah, of course.  I don't usually think of overextending as a
possibility in a bicycle race.  You're ahead of the pack, with the pack or
you're not racing.  I do the counting thing, there, too.  &quot;Push hard for 10
more pedal strokes.&quot;  Then another 10.  Usually the surge is over by then.
