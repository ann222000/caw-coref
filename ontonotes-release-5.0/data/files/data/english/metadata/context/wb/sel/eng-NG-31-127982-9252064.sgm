Some of you may remember a discussion I started over the winter, concerning
the possibility, and usefulness, of a wiki-style website for collaborative
transcription of manuscripts. ... Er, well. This isn't a wiki and it doesn't
support collaborations. But I haven't finished with it yet.

TuneBook Live! http://livetunebook.qualmograph.org.uk

Basically, it's the beginnings of the program that I'd like to have, to
manage my tunes with; implemented as a webserver in hopes that it could
do the same job for others too.

I've been on the edge of announcing it for months, but each time, I think of
a new bunch of stuff I &quot;really ought&quot; to do first and it's getting tiresome,
so here we go. There's still a lot wrong with it, but many eyeballs find
more bugs quicker, and all that ... they're certainly there to find. The
several that I currently know of will hopefully be fixed fairly shortly, and
I rely on you lot to find more &lt;offstage: fiendish laughter&gt;. At least I've
got it off my home machine onto a proper (I hope) server.

I'd be glad to know what anyone thinks. Does it work ?

Excellent stuff.  I haven't tried uploading yet, but the rest is mostly
working OK so far, apart from one thing.  When I display a tune by
clicking on the View link I get the tune plus the abc below it, with a
warning that it's in utf8 encoding.  If I select the abc and copy it
from the browser into a local program the utf8 causes no problems;  the
accented characters display correctly here.  However, every line of the
abc (except the first X:) is preceded by a space, and most of these
have to be removed before it is recognised by BarFly.

Like this:

X:104
T:l'Aïgo de Rotzo
M:2/4

N:The funny character in the title is an i-umlaut, in case any software
has trouble with it. Mine does.
O:France
R:Schottische

ABcA d2cB| ABAG F2D2| ABcA d2cB| ABAF G4 :|

Oddly enough, if I select abc and click the Download link, the abc is
not downloaded but displays in the browser, and here the encoding is
not recognised, resulting in a strange collection of random characters
in places.  If I then copy and paste that tune into BarFly there are no
leading spaces and the abc works fine apart from the encoding problem.

This is under Mac OS 10.3.9 using Safari as browser.

Mmm. Copy &amp; paste from the webpage, you're getting ABC-in-HTML, rather than
ABC. The phrase &quot;angle-brackets&quot; comes to immediately to mind, but I'll look
into it tomorrow.

Mime-types ? It's sent as the &quot;official&quot; text/vnd.abc - what you see would
happen if you don't have a handler defined for that. Perhaps I should also
offer it as text/plain.

That's the bug I knew about, I think. It's infuriating. As it leaves my
code, it's definitely in the proper iso-8859 set, a single byte character,
but by the time it arrives clientside it's been forced into the 2-byte utf8
coding. Mostly, ABC programs handle input naively as a simple stream of 8bit
chars, so you just get a little tangle of spurious stuff where the accented
character should be. Barring anybody finding anything more drastic, this is
top of the TODO.

Thanks.

SQL is, er, something else. The limited bits of it I let people get at
aren't _too_ bad (I think that bit's slightly broken at the moment, though),
but you'd have to want to be doing something complicated in the first place.
The idea of the pretty pointyclicky was that people shouldn't have to think
about it ... but, if you need it, it's seriously powerful stuff.

None of the other download options are quite working properly either:

MIDI opens a blank page in the browser, but does not play anything.

This is a bit problematical. My comment on the 'view' page, that the
accented chars are utf8, turns out to be over-simple - I think it depends on
what encoding the browser is set to, I discover that accented characters
display differently on this page according to what I select from
view/encoding - as above, the browser's rendering it. This is messy. I need
to look into the headers that are being generated at some point, I may have
to try and spell out that it's giving utf8.

Could I ask a favour ? Look at
http://livetunebook.qualmograph.org.uk/tune/00000666
and tell me how the accented character displays ? I'm guessing you'll see it
as an accented 'e' ?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I think that's an artefact of the previous bug. The abc's encoded as utf8
instead of Latin, this generates eps which seem to work but has glitched
characters, which causes the eps-&gt;pdf to generate broken pdf (it's a binary
format, and it's seeing 2 bytes where it expects 1. I think).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I think this may be due to your viewer ? if you were to get an eps directly
from the ABC and view that in it, is it different ? Using ghostview here, it
shows just a cropped eps. kde's kghostview displays a cropped eps
rotated through 90 degrees ... perhaps they just all do things differently ?
I'm not sure.

Oh, good.  Yes, that's what it should be. I've seen it called a hacek as
well (should the 'c' there have one ?), I got 'caron' from my 'character
map' program.

On checking again, my browsers do it properly, as well, I'd been under the
impression they didn't. I can't remember why now, this is confusing stuff.
So perhaps it's safe after all, and I could just remove the warning.

[ On a different but related subject, could I beg you to please, please,

That's how the EPS is being made, so it very possibly is. I'd like to give
people a choice of programs here (yaps is on the system already for

It is helpful. It's not always easy to see what things'll be like once they
arrive on someone else's different system, it's good to hear what happens;
and that it's not too bad, really. Very reassuring, actually. I've never
done the all-singing all-dancing code-driven website thing before, I'm
hugely relieved it doesn't seem to have blown up entirely.

It was worse than that. Something, among the various layers of conversation
it passes through, is insisting that all these other mime-types are Latin-1
text and translating all &gt;127 bytes into what would be their utf8
equivalents if it actually was. Which is annoying enough when it's abc, but
even more so when it's binary data like pdf ...

A work-round is in place, the &quot;download&quot; should be giving proper data for
all types now. Touch wood ...

&gt; &gt; I think that's an artefact of the previous bug. The abc's encoded as utf8
&gt; &gt; instead of Latin, this generates eps which seem to work but has glitched
&gt; &gt; characters, which causes the eps-&gt;pdf to generate broken pdf (it's a binary
&gt; &gt; format, and it's seeing 2 bytes where it expects 1. I think).

&gt; It was worse than that. Something, among the various layers of conversation
&gt; it passes through, is insisting that all these other mime-types are Latin-1
&gt; text and translating all &gt;127 bytes into what would be their utf8
&gt; equivalents if it actually was. Which is annoying enough when it's abc, but
&gt; even more so when it's binary data like pdf ...

&gt; A work-round is in place, the &quot;download&quot; should be giving proper data for
&gt; all types now. Touch wood ...

Both PDF and EPS working correctly now.  Files open automatically in
Preview after download, the top margin is correct and both have the
correct accented characters as far as I can see.

(I'm confused by the quoting, was it you who said that ?)

Anyway, I tried to look into that, since it's clearly silly [1] but I can't
persuade it to happen. Would you mind trying again, please ? and if it still
happens, tell me how you do it ?

[1] I'm not saying there aren't 3338 copies of the Atoll Highlanders to be
found, just not there. yet ...  (That's a misspelling to conjure with)

Believed attempt at filtering on text Atholl, but can't get in to
replicate or not.

I should frafvoly have been looking at the original tune book as I was
looking at tunes rather than uploading anything, but yielded to
temptation.

Also trggvat jnfuvat qbar in parallel...

Bleargh. Many eyeballs do indeed find more bugs faster.

Fixed now, I _think_ ?

List contains 3 tunes.
selected by filters :-

* (T = Atholl)

Thank you, Richard.

the Atholl Highlanders                                  Pipe march
the Atholl Highlanders Farewell to Loch Katrine         Pipe march
Cam' ye by Atholl ?                                     Slow Air

This last looks like an excuse for re-tuning to DADGAD. Correctly
displayed, but printed in white on black for some reason - looks like
scraper-board or woodcut, rather charming. Tune stave and dots
rectangle, that is, rest is fine. &lt;Turnpike prints fine, possibly a
FriedFox nonsense?&gt;

So 6/8 is a slow air - wanders off to find Sarah McQuaid's book....

Excellent, that what it tells me, too. That's a relief.

Odd. I remember learning the tune, I remember playing it, but I can't
remember a thing about how it goes. And it was hardly more than 15 yearss
ago ...

I've just checked, it's black-on-white here, so local settings of some sort.
(yours or mine, though ?)
