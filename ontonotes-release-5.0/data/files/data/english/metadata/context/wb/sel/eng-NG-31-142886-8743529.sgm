This is really just a matter of mercy and compassion.

http://www.citizenlink.org/content/A000005216.cfm

Rep. Chris Smith has reintroduced a bill in the U.S. House that would
require doctors to inform abortion-minded women of the pain their preborn
child would feel during the procedure.

The New Jersey Republican said his goal in bringing the bill back is to
&quot;expand and strengthen informed consent requirements&quot; for abortion
practitioners. A similar measure is being considered in the Senate.

The measure would require doctors to notify patients of the pain a preborn
baby may feel during an abortion and to offer anesthetic for the child prior
to the procedure. Of course, the hope is that after hearing the facts the
mother would choose life.

Dr. Jean Wright with the Mercer School of Medicine said the abortion culture
has made it difficult to make such a simple case.

&quot;It has been so astonishing in our country that we literally have had to go
to a level of congressional hearing to get folks to recognize that, 'No,
this really is pain,' &quot; she told Family News in Focus. &quot;This is the same
kind of pain that you or I would feel.&quot;

Wright said new science has forced the medical field and lawmakers to take a
second look.

&quot;If you recognize that there's pain in the unborn, to the degree that you're
actually going to treat it or give informed consent,&quot; she explained, &quot;then
it causes you to address the personhood of who is behind the womb.&quot;

Wendy Wright, president of Concerned Women for America, said the legislation
has a tough road ahead, but there is hope.

&quot;Some Democrats will be caught in the middle,&quot; she said, &quot;because they
realize that most voters would be in favor of some compassion and some
protection toward unborn children.&quot;

Kinda funny the reaction you got.  These people refuse to consider
medical evidence that threatens their political views, but you
apparently lack mercy and compassion.

She has an education in medicine, obvious.  She is far more qualified
to discuss medical issues than anyone else in this newsgroup.

So, when you can show me you have the credentials to prove her wrong,
then and only then shall your opinion be taken into consideration.

If you are going to say she is wrong, fine...but back it up with
something.

Since feeling occurs in the brain, a creature without a brain can't

&gt;&gt;&gt; neurologists) who disagree with her are wrong, too.

&gt;&gt;Start showing these physicians.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you are going to say she is wrong, fine...but back it up with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Funny how you never seem to think that stricture applies to you, isn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; it?

&gt;&gt;I noticed so far, you wasted a lot of space and provided nothing of
&gt;&gt;substance.  That's typical of most liberals.

&gt; The four year old's argument &quot;no I'm not, you are!&quot;, standard practice
&gt; for conservatives when asked to back up anything.  You're the idiot
&gt; who made the statement about her qualifications.  Please elaborate or
&gt; shut up.
">

Obviously you are the four year old.

The argument stated by another individual was that a fetus can not feel
pain.

The article has a statement by a medical professional, someone trained in
the medical field, that says a fetus can.

That person, Dr. Jean Wright with the Mercer School of Medicine, would be
qualified to make that statement.

Now, unless someone can refute her, then her statement stands.  If someone
does refute her, they need to show they are qualified to do so.

Now, I realize you are having a hard time understanding and you probably
have to get someone to read this to you and explain it for you.

I'll give it time to roll around in that little liberal head of yours and if
you can block out your stereotypes and bigotry, maybe a light bulb will
light up and you might get it.

Most of the time, liberals brains are like a fluorescent light-bulb.  When
you flick the switch, it flickers for a few seconds and eventually lights
up.

Oh, and I will not shut up.

Now, if you think you can make me shut up..by all means, give it your best
shot.

Many have tried before, and all have failed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it's a matter of stupidity and imposing your will on others.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Before the brain is functional, pain (a function of the brain) is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; impossible.  It's like a fetus having dental carries before it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tooth buds.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean Wright with the Mercer School of Medicine, says there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is pain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; felt by the fetus.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And what makes her right and others who disagree with her wrong?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; She has an education in medicine, obvious.  She is far more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; qualified
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to discuss medical issues than anyone else in this newsgroup.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, when you can show me you have the credentials to prove her
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrong,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then and only then shall your opinion be taken into consideration.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When you show us that YOU have the credentials to proclaim her
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; right, then and only then does your opinion matter.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't have to show you any credentials.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then nobody has to show you any.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They sure do, if they are going to refute a qualified medical
&gt;&gt;&gt; professional.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Her argument stands.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's just like in a court room, when someone testifies as an expert,
&gt;&gt;&gt; they must demonstrate their abilities and knowledge first.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you are going to speak as a medical professional and give a
&gt;&gt;&gt; medical statement, then yes, you provide your credentials.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not speaking as a medical professional.  I am merely stating that
&gt;&gt;&gt; someone else is, and she has the qualifications.

&gt;&gt; Prove it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; She is making the statement..SHE has the credentials

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you are going to disagree with her, either show your credentials
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or provide a statement from someone else who has the credentials.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That has been provided, over and over.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Empty space

&gt;&gt;&gt; That it was not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; provided this specific time does not mean that it hasn't been.

&gt;&gt;&gt; More wasted space

&gt;&gt; Yes, and it's all yours.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, and you'd better prove that all the other physicians (and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; especially neurologists) who disagree with her are wrong, too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Start showing these physicians.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Try the AMA, first.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm trying this newsgroup and anyone who wants to argue against the Dr.

&gt;&gt; Since the AMA specifically refutes her, your ignorance is not my problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Since the part of the brain that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; senses pain doesn't develop until late in pregnancy, there can be no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'feeling' before then. The claim that there could be is as bogus as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there being 'brain waves' at 40 days.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Functional maturity of the cerebral cortex [where pain is sensed,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; along with the thalamus] is suggested by fetal and neonatal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; electroencephalographic patterns...First, intermittent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; electroencephalograpic bursts in both cerebral hemispheres are first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seen at 20 weeks gestation; they become sustained at 22 weeks and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bilaterally synchronous at 26 to 27 weeks.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/anand/
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE, Volume 317, Number 21: Pages
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1321-1329, 19 November 1987.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now your talking.

&gt;&gt;&gt; However, note: The article does mention after 22 weeks, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt; argument is on partial birth abortion.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm pretty confident the Dr. in the article is refering to a fetus in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the later stages.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Also the article does support the argument that a fetus can feel
&gt;&gt;&gt; pain...of course anyone knows that this occurs later in the pregnancy.

&gt;&gt; Except for everyone who's claiming it happens at 20 weeks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you are going to say she is wrong, fine...but back it up with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Funny how you never seem to think that stricture applies to you,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; isn't it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I noticed so far, you wasted a lot of space and provided nothing of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; substance.  That's typical of most liberals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And now you'll ignore the cite, while you have provided nothing to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; back up your claims.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually the cite supports the Dr.

&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't.

But your cite lists the same point of development -- 20 weeks -- that
this bill suggests that women should be told the fetus might (it said
*might*, not *will*) feel pain and be offered an anesthetic for it.
So your evidence seems to actually support rather than counter the
claim you're trying to refute.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't have to show you any credentials.

&gt;&gt;&gt;She is making the statement..SHE has the credentials

&gt;&gt;&gt;If you are going to disagree with her, either show your credentials or
&gt;&gt;&gt;provide a statement from someone else who has the credentials.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, and you'd better prove that all the other physicians (and especially
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; neurologists) who disagree with her are wrong, too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Start showing these physicians.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you are going to say she is wrong, fine...but back it up with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Funny how you never seem to think that stricture applies to you, isn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I noticed so far, you wasted a lot of space and provided nothing of
&gt;&gt;&gt;substance.  That's typical of most liberals.

&gt;&gt; The four year old's argument &quot;no I'm not, you are!&quot;, standard practice
&gt;&gt; for conservatives when asked to back up anything.  You're the idiot

You might want to consider pushing that back a bit...I can remember my first

candle.  (Such was Oklahoma in 1956. :-)

But were you aware of YOU as an individual?

I was thinking more of the psychological ability to be aware that you
aren't the center of the universe and that others have their own points
of view.  Osprey clearly lacks this ability and can't fathom when he is
saying something stupid, or that he can say something and others might not
automatically have his point of view.

Not completely, but I knew that cupcake was for me.  (Three years and two
weeks later, Mom was gone for a couple of days and then came home with a
squalling brat.  Fortunately, in the 48 years since then, the brat has made
her way through school and is helping my parents ride herd on their house up
in my native town.)
