Sup.

Don't bite.

It is my reasoned position based on my most careful examination and
comprehension of the mass of scientifically verifiable evidence that
the following postulates are supported by an unbiased interpretation
of said evidence (interpreting individual evidences based on the
overall impression of the whole):

*The scientifically observed and catalogued process of biological
evolutionary change is inadequate to provide an explanation for the
diversity of life that is observed today or can be inferred based on
fossilized remains.
*No piece of evidence when taken in context reasonably suggests that
any terrestrial artifact or object has an age significantly greater
than 15,000 years.
*The overwhelming body of evidence collected seems to indicate a large-
scale aquatic catastrophe that affected large portions of the earth
between four and seven thousand years ago.

As a side note, it is my reasoned position that the Hebrew Torah, the
writings of the Hebrew prophets, and the body of literature compiled
by societal consensus in the first and second centuries C.E. known
collectively as the New Testament are as accurate as can be reasonably
determined in their original autographs. It is incidental to this
discussion that these writings tend to agree in historical narrative
with the scientifically oriented postulates I have listed above.

I am entirely aware that the majority of scientists and scientific
organizations that choose to involve themselves in various aspects of
the popular creation-evolution controversy hold positions in
opposition to the above postulates.  I am equally aware that the
majority of operational scientists who do research for the betterment
of the human race and the advancement of technology do not concern
themselves with that controversy as it is inconsequential to their
work.  Neither fact is relevant to this discussion except for the
derivative fact that I hold a scientific minority opinion.

Because of my philosophical belief in the importance of being
intellectually honest with oneself, I find it vaguely troubling that I
hold a position that is a minority compared to the mass of scientific
thought in that field.  Therefore ... educate me.

Please do not request that I &quot;go read www.talkorigins.org &quot;.  I've done
that.  A few times.  If you must point me to a particular page on
talk.origins, please specify the section or paragraph number so that I
will know exactly what point you want to bring up.

I find that in these types of discussions it is very easy for straw
man attacks to take place.  I have tried as hard as I can to define my
scientific positions as precisely as possible so that this will not
happen by mistake.

The more specifically you address the above postulates, the more
directly I will be able to inform you whether or not I have already
heard the evidence you propose to interpret and whether I can
reconcile it with the body of evidence I have already seen.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

So put up your first piece of evidence that you are right and science
is wrong.  Should be simple, right?  Why don't you start with isochron
radiometric dating methods and tell us what is wrong with them and
what you have that leads you to believe that you have a better
answer.  If you don't know what I am talking about, how can you make
your assertions about the age of anything over 15,000 years?

No. It seems that you need to educate the rest of the world- or at least
that portion that accepts mainstream science.

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. If that isn't
forthcoming, then your claim is simply baseless assertion.

You might start with letting us know the scientific sources you used to
refute the conclusions scientists have come to in the last 150 years or
so. You can start with the age of the planet (and the solar system, and
the universe) and move on from there.

Then you can tell us why an ancient book of fables and myths is somehow
more accurate than all of human scientific endeavor. Is it just your say-
so? I think we need a little more evidence than that.

You claim to have arrived at these conclusions by reason, but it sounds
suspicously like faith.

Hello, Ron.

Naturally, this debate is not about &quot;pieces of evidence&quot; any more than
a criminal trial hinges on which side has more exhibits.  The question
is what a given &quot;piece of evidence&quot; most directly supports, not
whether you have &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; evidence.  But I understand
what you mean.

Isochron dating methods are, of course, widely used to provide backing
for the accepted chronological position.  As with any scientific
method of measurement or derivation, certain assumptions are made.

Isocron methods are only accurate insofar as they can detect and
account for contamination and experimental variance, and this can only
be done if the researcher knows how the igneous or other substrate
originally formed.  The accuracy of the measurement hinges on the
value of D_i, which will not yield correct results if the parts of the
sample were formed at different speeds in nonuniform conditions.
Unless the sample (for example, lava) forms under a certain set of
conditions similar to what we see today, the values will yield a
straight isocron line without necessarily being accurate.  The
influence of rapid changes in environmental temperature or isotope
concentration has significant effects on the accuracy of P/D_i and D/
D_i ratios.

Likewise, there are few isocronic dating equipment systems which can
yield results for samples under 50,000 years.  There is no reason to
trust a date of 13.8 Mya for a given sample if there is no way of
knowing whether it is within the acceptable limits for that dating
system.

Radiometric dating usually yields a wide variety of specific results
for a particular sample.  Those results that line up with the
scientist's expectations for the age of the fossil are selected and
lined up with similar results from different radiometric dating
methods.  This is why radiometric dating is rarely if ever applied to
rocks for which an &quot;acceptable&quot; age range has not yet been determined.

Thank you.

Friar Broc,

I did not recall mentioning the age of the universe (about which I may
or may not have an opinion).  I spoke specifically about evidence
indicating the earth itself is over 15,000 years old.

As far as the Antarctic Ice sheet is concerned: you are presupposing
that it existed before this catastrophe that I am referring to.  The
formation rate of ice sheets is far from constant, as is the rate at
which ice cores are laid down.  Ice is more directly dependent upon
humidity levels than it is on lasting temperature changes. The rate at
which ice forms would be very high after a large flood, which would
allow the Antarctic Ice sheet to grow to its present size in less than
a few millenia.

Thank you.

Sue,

Of the three postulates I presented, two were negative (&quot;there isn't
enough evidence to suggest that....&quot;) and one was positive (&quot;the
evidence suggests that....&quot;).  Naturally, the burden of proof is on
you if you wish to disagree with the first two and on me if I want to
demonstrate the truth of the third.  In other words, explain to me how
biological evolutionary change can explain the diversity of life and
why the evidence shows an earth greater than 15,000 years.

The body of evidence suggesting a large aquatic catastrophe in the
recent past consists mostly of the observed ability of fast-moving
water or sediment to lay down large strata layers in short periods of
time, the existence of fossilized carcasses spread throughout these
layers that are more consistent with a rapid burial than a gradual
fossilization process, the existence of marine fossils at high
altitudes inconsistent with gradual continental uplift, and holes in
the ground like the Grand Canyon that could have easily been formed by
water runoff after the breakup of ice dams formed after such a flood.

Yeah, quite a coincidence. That's what &quot;incidental&quot; means. :D

As I stated before, this isn't about what &quot;evidence&quot; I have or don't
have.  You don't win a court case by having more exhibits; you win by
showing that the exhibits best align with your client's side of the
story.

Thank you.

Chris,

Usually, the majority attempts to educate the minority.  It goes
quicker that way.

And again, I knew that my beliefs relating to faith would be
questioned, so I stated my reasoned position by way of reference.  I
also pointed out that this was incidental to the discussion at hand.
Please address the three postulates which I referenced.

Thank you.

What about carbon-14 dating, which covers short timespans (up to c. 60,000 years)?

Moreover, why do dating methods using different isotopes (that have relatively
similar half-lives) agree with one another? If contamination is as much of a
problem as you seem to suggest, how do you explain this agreement?

Finally, you seem to be claiming that decay rates depend on external factors
such as temperature and density. This isn't true; with the exception of electron
capture decays (which are not used for radiometric dating), there is no evidence
that decay rates depend on environment.

top. IIRC, the top is 1100 ft from the floor of the canyon.

http://www.so-utah.com/souteast/powerdrv/mokidgwy/dugway.jpg

Heading NW on Rt. 261, the Valley of the Gods would be on the right

http://www.viamagazine.com/top_stories/articles/valleyof_gods05.asp

and the Goosenecks are on the left.

http://www.so-utah.com/souteast/powerdrv/goosenck/homepage.html
http://utahpictures.com/Goosenecks.html
http://www.colonialvoyage.com/viaggi/usautahgoosenecks.html

About nine miles east of Goosenecks and 3 miles NE of they town of
Mexican Hat is Mexican Hat Rock along the banks of the San Juan
River.

http://www.sanjuancounty.org/ps_mexican_hat_rock.htm
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Hat,_Utah

To the north about 40 miles is Natural Bridges National Monument.

http://www.so-utah.com/souteast/natural/homepage.html
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Bridges_National_Monument
http://www.utah.com/nationalsites/natural_bridges.htm

The challenge for the YEC is to present a plausible scenario for the
removal of material from the valley floor between Mexican Hat Rock
and
the cliffs at the Moki Dugway and from north of the Valley of the
Gods
through Monument Valley in the south. The material is up to 1100 feet
from the top of Cedar Mesa to the floor of the canyon. This must be
done before the incised meandering of the San Juan could begin. The
removal of the material must be gentle enough so as to not topple
Mexican Hat Rock or the spires in the Valley of the Gods and Monument
Valley. The natural bridges to the north show that much of the
material is solid rock.

Only after the valley is formed can the San Juan begin its incision.
The river is 1000 feet below the floor of the canyon. The water
cannot
maintain much velocity with the changing directions, thus minimal
carrying capacity to remove a great deal of material in a short
period
of time. As can be seen in the satellite images, the meandering is
not
confined to the Goosenecks.

If the claim of soft material is maintained, then please explain the
slot canyons of the American southwest

http://www.americansouthwest.net/slot_canyons/index.html

and why the Ohio River and the Mississippi River do not have banks a
thousand feet high.

How does one maintain the pretense of a belief in a young earth when
this much evidence of long term erosion is so apparent?

I'm not an expert, but I think that biologists are reasonably content
with computing rates of evolutionary change in terms of mutation of
DNA in successive generations, although there is still much debate
about exact quantities.  You may be aware that DNA mostly does not
last more than a few thousand years at best in a state that can be
studied, but modern DNA of related species can be compared - and if
DNA is enough to prove a relationship in a paternity suit, then it
should do for species, too.  This includes DNA that does not actually
do what is clearly its job, such as the broken vitamin C gene in
primates.

I agree with Ron, you should go study dating science, including
radiocarbon dating, dendrochronology, other radioactive dating
formulas, and... basically everything mentioned on this web page:
http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v26/i1/game.asp
I leave it to you to discriminate, reading that account, between
honest criticism, simple ignorance, and wilful obfuscation.

As for overwhelming evidence of a poorly dated &quot;aquatic catastrophe&quot; -
on the face of it, it doesn't really have much to do with our group
topic, the origins of natural things.  But I think we know what story
you have in mind; the evidence, however, is thinner on the ground.  By
all means explain why you think otherwise, apart from the bible, which
you declare to be not a necessary support to the views you've stated.

Incidentally, if &quot;original autographs&quot; means what I think it does in
this context, I don't think there are any.  Many modern bible scholars
are even sceptical that bible documents presented as the work of a
single author, are so.

Rich,

I believe that carbon-14 dating is not the same as isochron dating.  I
can address carbon dating specifically if you would like.

As I stated before, all dating methods use several samples and yield a
variety of specific results.  Those results from one method that agree
with the expectation for the sample's age are paired with similar
results from another method - which is why isocron dating cannot be
used to date rocks of unknown age.

I'm sorry I wasn't clear in my &quot;claim&quot;; I didn't say that decay rates
vary depending upon temperature or density.  Rather, the rate at which
the sample originally formed (and whether the various samples formed
under identical conditions) affects the P/D_i and D/D_i ratios, which
in turn can yield a &quot;straight-line&quot; isocron that is inaccurate.
Radiometric decay rates are quite constant unless one is in the middle
of a nuclear reaction.

Thank you.

No, do not go read any website.  Instead, spend at least three years in
college full-time studying biology, geology, and physics.  Six years
would be better.  There is a huge amount of information you should learn,
and you are not likely to learn very efficiently  piecemeal over the
internet.

Note above all that your education is *your* responsibility, not ours.
If you choose not to invest in college, there are still plenty of
resources you can draw on, but they all -- even the internet -- have one
thing in common: they require you to invest time and effort.  If you are
not willing to do that, then simply erase origins as topic of discourse
for you, and go on to other things.

Hard to be sure what you mean here. Do you mean that mutation and

evolution, or that descent with modification can't explain the number of

This is clearly false. I presume by &quot;artifact or object&quot; you mean
anything manmade, right? In order to believe this you must absolutely
reject all forms of dating, whether radiometric or otherwise, since they

So who cares about ages less than 13.8 million years ago when we are
using isochron dating to date the oldest rocks on earth?  That
argument is so bad that you must be obfuscating and bull shitting on
purpose.  Concentrating on areas where we aren't talking about is not
an honest way to start.  Aren't we talking about billions of years for
the age of the rocks we date with the method.  Isn't the method much
more accurate out at these ages?  So what good are your arguments?
Got any evidence that all the dates are wrong?  Why would you even
consider that to be a possibility?  What is your explanation for why a
lot of rocks date to over a billion years old?  What about the rocks
that we can date with more than one method and get the same date?
What kind of statistical tests have you done to warrent chucking all
the data that demonstrates that you are full of baloney?

Remember this is only the first point, and you aren't doing very
well.  Why would you worry about worthless data trying to date things
less than 15 million years old?  Why not stick with the mixing and
formation argument?  It is a long shot, but still honest.  So what
statistical tests have you done to establish that all the data from
the samples tested are due to Di or formation problems.  How can you
get consistent dates using multiple decay products from the same rock
if it is due to these problems?

Greg,

Thanks for addressing the first postulate!

I assume that you are referring to the detrimental effects of
mutagenesis and positive feedback for &quot;progressive&quot; mutagenesis.  The
process of natural selection can only operate on positive feedback
that is present in the first generation of genetic change.  Otherwise,
it has nothing to bring it to the forefront and thus is no more likely
than any other variation to be carried on, built upon, and eventually
provide positive feedback. All genetic changes are naturally
attenuated unless they provide an immediate survival advantage (and I
am referring to gene survival, not organism survival).  Are there
random genetic changes which provide an immediate survival advantage
that are progressive enough (able to be built upon for further
advances) to drive microbes-to-man diversity?

I have considered &quot;all the evidence&quot; together and have concluded that
there is no reason to believe any part of the earth (and derivatively
the earth itself) is greater than 15,000 years.  What evidence makes
all of this change?

On erosion:

Flood and sediment lays down a wide variety of layered earth that, if
it remains underwater in the right conditions, form into rock very
quickly.  Underwater currents necessitate a wide range of pressures
which change the consistency and density of the rock underneath them.
Later on, the receding of the water (due to continental uplift or the
breaking of ice dams) slices through the less dense portions of rocks
and only partially (i.e. as though it took a long period of time)
erodes the surrounding rock.  There is little or no trace left of the
softer rock and today's observer can easily succumb to the assumption
that the stream trickling through the bottom of the basin carved
everything out over a long period of time.

It's like a backhoe carved out a massive trench in the earth and rains
eroded the banks of the trench.  The rain is only responsible for the
erosion that took place AFTER the trench was made.

Thank you.

Pretty close:

drops, dramatically limiting the possibility of precipitation.

If that's what you meant, your statement was highly misleading. The

The Grand Canyon is inconsistent with the breakup of an ice dam. If you

Agreed. So far, none of your exhibits align at all.

Here's my first exhibit: the fossil record shows clear sorting by level.
Cambrian fossils are different from Ordovician fossils, and so on up to
Pleistocene fossils being different from extant species. Further, the
fossils of particular strata are more similar to those immediately above
and below them than to those in strata far above or below: Permian
fossils are most similar to Pennsylvanian and Triassic ones, and much
less similar to Cambrian or Pleistocene ones. Quite aside from questions
of absolute age, this pattern of relative age refutes the notion that
much of the record can have anything to do with a single event like a
wordwide flood. The sequential nature and gradual change in biota over
time also refute any sort of simultaneous creation event. It also argues
against sequential creation, since why would a creator be constrained to
producing species only slightly different from immediately previous ones?

&gt; Naturally, this debate is not about &quot;pieces of evidence&quot; any more than

&gt; Isochron dating methods are, of course, widely used to provide backing

&gt; Isocron methods are only accurate insofar as they can detect and
&gt; account for contamination and experimental variance, and this can only
&gt; be done if the researcher knows how the igneous or other substrate
&gt; originally formed.  The accuracy of the measurement hinges on the
&gt; value of D_i, which will not yield correct results if the parts of the
&gt; sample were formed at different speeds in nonuniform conditions.
&gt; Unless the sample (for example, lava) forms under a certain set of
&gt; conditions similar to what we see today, the values will yield a
&gt; straight isocron line without necessarily being accurate.  The
&gt; influence of rapid changes in environmental temperature or isotope
&gt; concentration has significant effects on the accuracy of P/D_i and D/
&gt; D_i ratios.

&gt; Likewise, there are few isocronic dating equipment systems which can

between objects in the sky.  specifically that parralax does not exist.
when statistics says you have a varance, and a probablity does that mean
that the mathematics lies?

I really dont know anything technical about the science behind genetics
but if you talk about physics in general I kind of know what is going
on.  but for that you can say that I take genetics on faith, I certainly
cannot talk about that, oh maybe mouth off about population changes, but
statistics are strange.   If you really understand math you can talk
about dating methods,  I know what I dont know, and I know pretty much
what I do know.   I am exploring the mathematics of black holes and how
big a space the sphere of influence is.

Signus A is a strange object.  they posted a value for a star speed &gt;
5000 kilometer per second.  and they give a minimum distance of 17 light
hours.

since I know some simple stuff    V^2*R = G*M  gm is G * that big mass

so put this in your calculator.   5188000^2 *(17*3600*299792485) and it
will equal 4.93828932E26, divide that by 6.67244E-11 and you will get
7.400949176E36  since a solar mass is in round numbers 1.991E30 we can
divide by 2E30 and you will get 3.70047E6 solar mass  that is 3.7
million times our sun.   just for the record it was publihed in the news
that the BH is 3.7 million suns, the velocity  (more than 5000kps amd a
distance pf 17 hours.    thre is a different star that is 8 hours
minimum distance and I will let the reader calculate how fast it is
traveling -- ( 1/40 of the speed of light)

look up surfing a Black Hole.   google is your friend. I have been
studying  celestial mechanics for many years.    for the moment consider
that  GM/r^2 = V^2 so we want V

pluto  [( 1.3271244E20/(39.44*1.4959787066E11)^2]^(1/2)  =  1.9525E-3
GBH [(4.93828932E26/(365.25*86400*299792485)^2]^(1/2) =  2.3448E-3

because the gravity at 1 light year near the BH is like the gravity
near pluto.  it implies that all stars in this radius are in orbit
around the BH.

that is my math, now show me  yours.

Biological evolutionary change has been observed to produce variety, and

Actually, the &quot;gradual fossilization process&quot; normally begins with rapid
burial, often by localized flooding.  There is also many examples of
fossilization that occurred in quiet, anoxic lagoons, which is
impossible with a flood scenario.

The existence of those fossilized &quot;carcasses&quot; (along with plants,
and microbes)  which show faunal succession contradicts the idea of a
single global flood.  If the fossil record was laid down at once, we'd
expect to see fossils unsorted by chronological order.   Instead we see
distinct periods that were classified long before Darwin published his
theory.

There is also a lack of evidence of a single &quot;aquatic catastrophe&quot;
that involved the entire Earth's surface.  Moreover, the problem of
where did the extra water come from, and where did it go afterward is an
issue that has never been adequately answered by creationists.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

How so?   Existence of marine fossils at high altitude is much more
consistent with tectonic uplifting than a global flood, which would not
have left marine fossils inside rocks.   A global flood might have left
a relatively thin layer of sediment on top of mountains, (but then
quickly washed away) but could not possibly have placed fossils inside
of the rocks themselves.

First of all, where do you get the idea there would have been &quot;ice dams&quot;
caused by a global flood?  The kinetic energy released by a flood of
that magnitude (and the rain) would have heated the surface of the
Earth, not cooled it.  Second, the Grand Canyon is not merely a &quot;hole in
the ground&quot;.   The Grand Canyon is the result of tectonic forces
uplifting and erosion of the Ancestral Colorado River cutting down
through the rock layers.   Runoff from ice dams fits more with
glaciation scenarios, than a single global flood.  May I suggest you
read some geology?   Maybe Glen Morton's example would be helpful.  He

Vend,

I am not blaming contamination entirely.  But when contamination
happens, it does not infer that it is a pure chunk of &quot;old rock&quot;; in
isocron dating D_i, P, and D don't exactly stick together unless it is
a closed system.

We can trust the equipment for the range of accuracy for that
equipment.  However, since isocron dating doesn't measure under a
particular age, we can't date something as being within that range
unless we already know it is in the range ... which is circular
reasoning.

The geological similarity between West Africa and South America strongly
suggests they were once joined together. How do you explain the fact that the
Atlantic Ocean now separates them? Based on a 15,000 year age for the Earth, and
a present-day separation of ~1800 miles, the average spreading rate would have
had to been c. 50 cm per day.

Compare this to the spreading rate we actually observe in the Atlantic -- c. 2cm
per year, or 0.005 cm per day. How do you explain the 4 orders of magnitude
difference between the observed rate, and the inferred rate for a 15,000 year
old Earth?

Well, okay.  But no.

This may be your positioned, but it isn't based upon a careful examination

I'd ask you elucidate your position further, but let's try to focus the
effort on a single of your claims.  &quot;No piece of evidence when taken

significantly greater than 15,000 years.&quot;

On my desk, I have a fossil of an Elrathia Kingii: a type of trilobite.
In fact, here's a picture of the very fossil (actually, you can see two
of them):
http://brainwagon.org/images/trilobite.jpg

Scientists classify this trilobyte as belonging to the order Ptychopariida,
which are some of the most primitive trilobites known.  They date these
little critters to the middle of the Cambrian, but members of this order
seem to have lasted till the Ordovician.  In other words, this critter is
claimed by scientific consensus to be roughly half a billion years old.

I must admit, it's pretty cool when you think about it.  It's the coolest
$5 object I think I own.

Now, here's your challenge:  why do you think that the scientists who
date this little guy thusly are wrong?

&gt; Hello, Ron.

&gt; Naturally, this debate is not about &quot;pieces of evidence&quot; any more than

No.  They are widely used because they establish chronological position.
Verifiably.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As with any scientific
&gt; method of measurement or derivation, certain assumptions are made.

&gt; Isocron methods are only accurate insofar as they can detect and
&gt; account for contamination and experimental variance, and this can only
&gt; be done if the researcher knows how the igneous or other substrate
&gt; originally formed.  The accuracy of the measurement hinges on the
&gt; value of D_i, which will not yield correct results if the parts of the
&gt; sample were formed at different speeds in nonuniform conditions.
&gt; Unless the sample (for example, lava) forms under a certain set of
&gt; conditions similar to what we see today, the values will yield a
&gt; straight isocron line without necessarily being accurate.  The
&gt; influence of rapid changes in environmental temperature or isotope
&gt; concentration has significant effects on the accuracy of P/D_i and D/
&gt; D_i ratios.

&gt; Likewise, there are few isocronic dating equipment systems which can
&gt; yield results for samples under 50,000 years.  There is no reason to
&gt; trust a date of 13.8 Mya for a given sample if there is no way of
&gt; knowing whether it is within the acceptable limits for that dating
&gt; system.

&gt; Radiometric dating usually yields a wide variety of specific results
&gt; for a particular sample.  Those results that line up with the
&gt; scientist's expectations for the age of the fossil are selected and
&gt; lined up with similar results from different radiometric dating
&gt; methods.  This is why radiometric dating is rarely if ever applied to
&gt; rocks for which an &quot;acceptable&quot; age range has not yet been determined.
">

You didn't actually put forth any reasoned position to justify your
mistrust in isochron dating.  Your entire argument boils down to &quot;you think
you are so smart, you don't know everything&quot;.  This is of course true, but
in the context in which we are speaking, equally irrelevent.

Do you have any real life examples of this?   Geologists can normally
differentiate between flood sediments, and annual varves, based on
chemical analysis, and other methods. See:

http://www.geocities.com/athens/thebes/7755/henke/krh-floodnonsense.html

This bit, especially

&quot;The famous Green River Formation of Wyoming contains numerous varves.
The formation and its varves probably developed in several large Eocene
lakes. The Green River Formation is frequently cited by YEC critics
because the numerous varves refute both &quot;Flood geology&quot; and a &quot;young&quot;
creationist Earth. Sarfati and other YECs argue that the rocks of the
Grand Canyon and the Green River Formation and its varves may have
formed rapidly, just like Austin's pyroclastic &quot;flow&quot; at Mount St.
Helens. However, clearly, it is gross mistake for Sarfati and his YEC
allies to assume that the rapid processes that formed a pyroclastic
deposit at Mount St. Helens can be scaled up to explain the geology of
the Grand Canyon or the delicate and extensive varves of the Green River
Formation. For example, as far as I know, the laminae of the Green River
Formation do not include cross-bedding, antidunes or other features that
are present in Bouma sequences and some pyroclastic deposits.

Now, there is no doubt that multiple laminae may form in a single season
or even from a single storm or sediment flow as Austin (1994, p. 37-39)
and other YECs claim. However, YECs are mistaken if they believe that
ALL laminae form rapidly. Glenn Morton in Young-Earth Arguments: A
Second Look, for example, cites Hsu and Lambert (1979) and illustrates
the great differences between regularly spaced annual varves from Lake
Zurich, Switzerland, and noticeably irregular storm laminae from Lake
Walensee, also in Switzerland. Austin (1994, p. 38) mentions the storm
laminae from Hsu and Lambert (1979), but fails to quote Hsu and
Lambert's (1979, p. 460) clear statement that annual varves do exist in
other Swiss lakes, such as Lake Zurich. By failing to quote Hsu and
Lambert's (1979, p. 460) comment, Austin gives the false impression that
there are no annual varves in any Swiss lakes.&quot;

John,

&quot;Evolution can't account for diversity&quot; = &quot;There is insufficient
evidence that evolution provides a mechanism for this diversity.&quot;

&quot;The body of evidence does not infer an old age for the earth&quot; =
&quot;There is insufficient evidence that the earth is old.&quot;  And I'm
referring to the earth.

Since water lays down strata layers, and we have strata layers, thus
it is quite likely that water did it.

Rapid burial and gradual fossilization are not exclusive (technically
all fossilization takes a while); I meant the entire fossilization
process which includes the method whereby the fossil is buried.

Explain why the Grand Canyon is inconsistent with effect of massive
runoff from an ice-enclosed lake in the northern part of the United
States as the sedimentary layers of the Canyon were raised up.

Very well.  Instead of that, consider the souterrains, and chambered

can all be dated to about five thousand years ago.  None of them show
the silting that would be the result of massive flooding.  Therefore,
a massive flood would have to predate them.

However, if such a flood did predate them by the one to two thousand
year you posit, then there is no way to explain how enough people to
build them found their way to the grim, remote Orkney Islands in that
narrow band of time remaining.

I recommend reading &quot;Tomb of the Eagles&quot; which is quite accessible to

&gt; It is my reasoned position based on my most careful examination and

&gt; the following postulates are supported by an unbiased interpretation
&gt; of said evidence (interpreting individual evidences based on the
&gt; overall impression of the whole):

&gt; *The scientifically observed and catalogued process of biological
&gt; evolutionary change is inadequate to provide an explanation for the
&gt; diversity of life that is observed today or can be inferred based on
&gt; fossilized remains.
&gt; *No piece of evidence when taken in context reasonably suggests that
&gt; any terrestrial artifact or object has an age significantly greater
&gt; than 15,000 years.

well, if you think all of physics is wrong...including that which is
operating your computer now, then there's no arguing with you. you've
chosen ignorance over logic. better men than you have done so.

OK convince me.

&gt; As a side note, it is my reasoned position that the Hebrew Torah, the
&gt; writings of the Hebrew prophets, and the body of literature compiled
&gt; by societal consensus in the first and second centuries C.E. known
&gt; collectively as the New Testament are as accurate as can be reasonably
&gt; determined in their original autographs. It is incidental to this
&gt; discussion that these writings tend to agree in historical narrative
&gt; with the scientifically oriented postulates I have listed above.

since it took 400 years for xtians even to agree on the canon AND we
have evidence that it has been changed a number of times to deal with
marcionites, ebionites, etc., such a statement is simply

wrong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The more specifically you address the above postulates, the more

&gt; Thank you.

instead of starting with science, start with the bible. check bart
ehrman's book 'lost christianities' to see how many 'new testaments'
there were for the 1st 400 years of xtianity. check also 'the closing
of the western mind' to see how constantine manipulated the church to
enforce an orthodoxy on christianity that was quite alien to its
founding.

the problems with the bible....not the answers of science...will
convince you the bible is wrong.

&gt; Hello, Ron.

&gt; Naturally, this debate is not about &quot;pieces of evidence&quot; any more than

I think that is where you missed the ship because science is EXACTLY
about the evidence. In the case of evolutionary theory it's not one
piece of evidence or a dozen; it's ALL of the available evidence
supports the theory. In a civil trial, the preponderance of evidence
is supposed to carry the day; in a criminal trial it is &quot;beyond a
reasonable doubt.&quot; The evidence for the scientific theory of evolution
goes way beyond &quot;a reasonable doubt.&quot;

You may not like what results from applying the scientific method
because it conflicts with some cherished belief. That's fine, you
don't have to like them, but don't pretend that they're not
scientific.

you keep saying this.

proof?

and proof that the bible is accurate? hell, my 'new english bible'
completely eliminates the story of the women in john's gospel who was
accused of adultery. it's not found in the most ancient manuscripts.

So, because you're unaware of whatever supporting evidence a
proposition might have, it can't be true? Using similar logic, one
could argue that heliocentrism isn't true because one hasn't seen any

which is about 300 years after christ. not a good start. and these

well, no, they don't.  first, we don't know what the texts WERE in the

about 370 AD. and there is no agreement on what the original texts
