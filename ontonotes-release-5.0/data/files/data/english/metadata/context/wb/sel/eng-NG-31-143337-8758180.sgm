The economy, the war &amp; peace

The Business Community, including the heads of some of the leading
conglomerates in the country paid a courtesy call to the Secretary Defence
at his office on Tuesday (11). This meeting provided the forum for the
Business Community to voice some issues of concern, which were clarified by
the Secretary Defence. Following are the excerpts taken from this
discussion.

As expressed by the Secretary Defence, &quot;We are all aware of the kind of
publicity you see in certain sections of the Media which has a negative
impact on the Security Forces with both short and long term impact on the
economic front as well. While observing a clear national political agenda
influenced by some international forces with definite ulterior motives to
misinterpret or mischievously misinform the public of certain facts , I
consider it to be my duty to place some facts before you as the key drivers
of the economy of this country&quot;.

He continued to state that Sri Lankans have lived with this uncertainty for
more than 25 years and as a Government, there obviously is no quick-fix
solution to this issue. However, working according to the direction &amp;
overall plan of the Government, which believes that the final solution to
this problem lies in a negotiated settlement, he is of the firm belief that
in order to achieve this objective, the country needs to combat terrorism
and push the terrorist leaders to come to the negotiating table and above
all protect the law &amp; order of the country.

He was of the opinion that a company without a vision is a company blinded.
A company without a mission only gropes in the dark. He was very confident
in saying that &quot;I can assure you one thing. And that is we are driven by a
vision and we do have a carefully crafted mission to achieve our objectives.
Our long term strategies and short term tactics are very well focused to
achieve these objectives&quot;.

He expanded that the Defence Ministry of Sri Lanka today, is fighting the
most ruthless terrorist organization in the world, which possesses the
largest cadre of suicide bombers. He stated that this situation is very
different from competing with commercial competitors in a level playing
field. According to him, the LTTE also differs from other such terror
groups, in the sense that over the years they have evolved into a corrupt
mafia, with little commitment to fulfill its own declared objective of
forming a separate state for the Tamil people.

With examples to back his argument he stated that &quot;The world over, they are
engaging in drug trafficking, arms smuggling, money laundering, human
trafficking and other large scale banking frauds. They have so far
assassinated close to 60 Tamil leaders who have fought for democratic rights
of the Tamil people. They have put 2 generations of Tamil people in jeopardy
by recruiting the largest no. of child soldiers over 25 years. The complete
education system and the lifestyle in the North &amp; East are in total disarray
except in little pockets in Government controlled areas. While the so called
Tamil civil diaspora is funding terrorism for petty economic gain, their
kith and kin are suffering in the North &amp; East of Sri Lanka&quot;.

He felt that this has further complicated the task as the LTTE is no more
the conventional terrorist organization, fighting for a cause. That is why
it was very important that all the stakeholders including the business
community and the corporate hierarchy of Sri Lanka understand this problem
for what it is, without any prejudice, bias or ambiguity. This knowledge
will help the business community especially in their short term and long
term business decision making, may it be an investment, corporate planning
initiative or simply whether to buy or sell stocks.

While confessing to the truth that &quot;I'm not directly exposed to the
commercial world, I do understand that any conflict can only bring adverse
results to an economy of a country and also to individual businesses which
fuel the economy. I must also say that my exposure to politics is also
limited but yet I do my best to understand the intricacies and the
implications. But as a soldier I know only the right strategy which takes
all other factors into consideration will work and achieve the final bigger
goal that not only you as a corporate but we as one nation longs for. This
is the way towards long term, sustainable stability in the country where you
can take strong investment decisions in order to achieve your corporate
objectives. This is the way in which you can be a part of an equitable
society as a responsible, strong corporate citizen&quot;.

He willingly admitted that he was more than convinced that Sri Lankan
corporates are patriotic in every sense. He said that he has seen the
willingness in the Business Comunitys to support and strengthen the nation.

With regard to the role of the opposition, he had the following to say &quot;I
sense that some of you believe that the present opposition can deliver
stability as far as your business opportunities are concerned. I must say
this is a big myth. As I have explained before, signing temporary peace
pacts with a ruthless terrorist group cannot bring lasting peace nor
economic stability. It only seems as a attractive alternative if you don't
comprehend and confront the reality.

As the whole world has realized, the only way to bring about peace is to
curb terrorism. Sri Lanka cannot be foolishly idealistic. Peace has become a
marketable commodity in the world today and in Sri Lanka too there is
blatant marketing of this commodity called peace for pure economic gain. So
much so, that for some people it has become a lucrative business venture,
where the top line has become equivalent to the bottom line since there
aren't any costs involved. You might even be envious if you see the Income
Statement of some of these &quot;peace organizations&quot;.

It is in this context that he appealed to the Business Community to
understand the role of the Ministry of Defence along with the security
forces of Sri Lanka. He said &quot;We on our part have understood the challenge
placed before us and are acting with 100% professionalism in achieving the
said objectives. I can assure you with responsibility that we do not have
any private agenda. The Commanders of the three Forces and the IGP have
pledged their unstinted support to this cause and we work as one team.

I do not have to emphasize the fact that when you work hard, only then will
you be subject to allegation and criticism. Though we like to accept some
constructive and objective criticism, it is sad that some of our own Sri
Lankan people engage in unsubstantiated accusations, merely for their petty
political or economic gains.

I have from time to time explained about the systems and procedures we have
introduced to the military in the recent past, in order to prevent any
malpractices during procurement. In fact I am proud to be part of team that
is free from any such acts which if we are honest were commonplace once upon
a time&quot;.

He believed that the &quot;Allegations against the violation of human rights&quot; was
a slogan created by some of those peace brokers &amp; so called civil society
with hidden agendas, who were willingly supported by certain political
parties. While agreeing that in a conflict situation like this, it is not
very easy to completely control such problems, he said that all possible
steps have been taken to avoid such violations, which includes training &amp;
briefing our security forces on the merits of the subject.

As a responsible Government official he assured the Business Community that
the Government will definitely curb terrorism in Sri Lanka within a
stipulated time period. This would undoubtedly open new doors of opportunity
for business right here in Sri Lanka. He took the opportunity to invite the
Business Leaders present to understand the gravity of this national
situation and willingly lend their support to achieve what we have set out
to do. He said &quot;Because for you to do your business, first there must be a
country&quot;.
