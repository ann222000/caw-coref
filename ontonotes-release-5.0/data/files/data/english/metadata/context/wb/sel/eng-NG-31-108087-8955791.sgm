Looking for a security solution, want to bounce this off the NG:

http://www.digitalguarddawg.com/Product-P-HF-1.html

That's where i'd pick whichever one fits a Suzuki Volusia. It would be
$150 for a starter relay interrupt that only makes it possible for the
ignition to complete the circuit only when a personal RFID tag is
within 10 feet of the unit. Meaning if i put the RFID tag in my
pocket, someone would have to steal my jacket in order to start my
bike OR would have to take my seat off and get into my fusebox and
spot this (or, i suppose, have left my jacket within 10 feet of the
bike).

How would *you* steal a bike? Would you check to see if a fuse was
missing when it didn't start, in which case, would you probably spot
this as a new piece (and thereby suspicious, and therefore a likely
security measure)?

This seems to do pretty much what i want - prevent someone from
starting my bike (and thus unable to ride away on it). I'm just
curious about what i might be missing and if anyone's heard anything
about this or if anyone has an idea how feasible this type of
precaution is. Best guesses? Seem ok? Seems easily foiled by the
average thief?

Could always throw a physical lock on also, either a U or a disc. And
of course i could try something totally different.

Have a mate give me a hand with a couple of skateboards, put one under
each wheel and roll it up the ramp into the back of the
van......or.....just pull up alongside it in a ute, again with the help
of a mate 9or two) and just pick it up and dump it in the tray. A bit
more cosmetic damage than plan 'A'.

As I understand it, many bikes are simply lifeted up an into trucks
and carted off.

I wouldn't even worry about trying to start it. I'd arrive with my truck
or van, and three burlymen, and pick up the bike and toss it inside.

The only good way to prevent theft is to weld the bike to a fire
hydrant.

Or ride a beater.

As others have already said, forget it.  Bikes are too easy to pick up
to worry about whether or not the thief can start it.  If you're that
worried, chain it to something heavy or immovable; but even that won't
stop a determined thief.  Like most security measures, the best you
can hope for is deterring the honest.

And it works!

In the musical would we call this the &quot;ugly puppy syndrome&quot;, I.E. you learn
to take a thrashed-looking dirty old guitar to gigs, because drunks and
thieves -like magpies- are attracted to shiny objects, and will invariably
gravitate to new and expensive looking guitars that are left unprotected for
even a short while.

But unless your potential thief or drunk is an expert guitarist themselves
they will nearly always pass over the &quot;ugly puppy&quot; that sounds great and
plays like greased lightning.

Note: Exceptions can be made for bands big enough to afford their own
security guys, who can watch the stage while the band takes a break between
sets.

Making it a lot of trouble to steal a Motorcycle,  or for that
matter,anything around the place, or out somewhere, is the only thing we
can possibly do, to keep and/or protect.  If the thief is experienced,
he will have the right tools, to take what he wants, and  consequently
do it quickly. A locked door at home, only slows them down, or keeps an
unexperienced punk from being sucessful.

My Volusia is a 2003.  One thing that crossed my mind was to put
big Suzuki stickers on it, then park by the Gold Wings and Harleys.

Same happens here. Two or three big blokes pick up the bike, alarm
screaming and immobiliser immobilising, and throws it into a van.  Bye

Are there any affordable tracking units where you are?  It still gets
taken, but then you know it's gone and you stand a chance of finding

In the US there's a company called &quot;Lojack&quot; that makes a business of
vehicle recovery systems.  Their unit costs about $700 when bought
with the vehicle with no recurring fees--I don't know what it costs if
you buy it aftermarket.  For another hundred bucks they'll give you an
additional coverage to the effect that if your vehicle isn't recovered
in 30 days or is totalled when recovered they'll pay you $5000.  The
additional coverage is good for five years and I believe it's
renewable.

The deal is that if your bike is stolen you call the cops, give them
the VIN, and they can track it from there.  Until you do that the unit
is inactive.

There are various GPS-based systems that have wider coverage area, but
they also involve a monthly or annual fee, so in the long run they
cost more even if the initial purchase price is cheaper.  I find
myself wondering how well they'll work in NYC--they're mostly
satphone-based and satphones sometimes have trouble in places like NYC
where there are many tall buildings.

Ok, this is providing some consternation. I just figured getting a
good security system would be a no-brainer, but clearly i don't
understand the ratio of thefts by shifty-eyed joe's and by guys with
trucks/vans &amp; friends.

If someone is going to come with a truck/van and lift my bike in, then
all security measures become moot - the only ones that could make it
more difficult to get my bike carted away would be chaining it to a
fixed object. But if someone has a truck/van, why wouldn't they also
have big enough boltcutters or a lock drill (whatever thieves use)
with them to take care of that? So basically there's no way to protect
against someone taking my whole bike away (not under its own power). I
have comprehensive insurance and this is covered.

For everything else, which *seems* (please correct me) to be getting
the bike to start and riding it away, the proscriptions against that
include disc locks, chaining to something inert, ignition stoppers,
custom tricks (like yoinking a fuse or hiding a relay interrupt), and
alarms (somewhat). Is there a chance some thief is going to disable
all those securities and roll the bike away without starting it? Can
someone steal a bike without either riding it away or carting it away
in a truck/van?

If not, then an ignition relay trick is effective, just like a lock of
some sort. No? Is the feeling here that the likelihood of getting it
carted away diminishes the chance of it being started and driven away?
Whether an alarm would do diddly (especially in NYC) is questionable,
and i'm not really considering one (if anything i'd get a pager
model). So...the consensus thus far is that these &quot;other&quot; thieves (the
ones who don't cart the bike away) are not worth considering; if my
bike is getting stolen, it's because someone with some real motivation
(and a truck/van got my bike.

How accurate is that? If i'm worried about the average thief, should a
$50 disc lock be all i bother with? Is this guard dawg (or other
'invisible'-ish ignition locks) going to be wasted? (I'm guessing
you'll all say yes...)

Any lock is a delaying device, nothing more.  Nice thing about a disk
lock is that if the guy doesn't notice it and gets the bike started he
may end up maiming himself when he goes off .  Probably break the bike
too, but that's another story.  Downside is that if you forget to take
it off, the same thing may happen to you.

The guys with trucks will also have bolt cutters but there are chains
designed to defeat those--they can still be cut but it takes power
tools--if they can't cut the chain they'll go for an easier target.
Be careful what you chain it to though--if the post is an easy thing
to cut they may cut the post instead.

If you get an alarm get one with a visible indicator--that indicator
may be enough to cause the potential thief to move on to a different
target.

Some people keep the bike in their apartment, which is the safest
alternative from a theft viewpoint, but may not be terribly convenient
and may incur the wrath of your landlord.
