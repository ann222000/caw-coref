Threats - the homeopathic panacea
o Ben Goldacre
o The Guardian
o Saturday October 20 2007

Let's imagine that we live in an exotic parallel universe where I am
able to use an amusing but trivial news event to illustrate a wider
cultural and intellectual issue. Dr Andy Lewis runs a website called
Quackometer; he criticised the Society of Homeopaths (Europe's largest
professional organisation of homeopaths) in no uncertain terms. In his
opinion, they do not enforce their own &quot;code of practice&quot; (you're not
even allowed to imply you can cure a named disease!); it is a figleaf;
and they fail to censure their members over dangerous claims.

His chosen example was the Newsnight malaria sting: an undercover
investigator went to see some homeopaths and was given homeopathic
pills to protect against this fatal disease, by quacks who denigrated
medical options and failed to give basic &quot;holistic&quot; advice on things
like bite protection. I agree with Dr Lewis: this was cavalier and
dangerous.

Did the SoH engage with these criticisms? Reflect on them? Challenge
and rebut them? No. It sent a threatening legal letter. Did this
letter say what was wrong with Dr Lewis's post? No. It wasn't even
sent to him, it was sent to his hosting company, Netcetera, demanding
it take his page down. He contacted the SoH, very politely, to ask
what the problems were with his comments. No response.

Instead its lawyers sent another angry letter to his hosting company,
which is, strictly speaking, liable and so the page was taken down.
Corporate conspiracy silences the little man: except of course his
piece has now been replicated at least a hundred times across the
internet by an army of smirking bloggers.
