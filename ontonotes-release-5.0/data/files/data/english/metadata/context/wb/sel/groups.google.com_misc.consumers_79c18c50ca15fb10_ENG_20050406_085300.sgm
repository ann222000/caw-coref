Sweeping New Bankruptcy Law To Make Life Harder for Debtors
After 8 Years, Legislation Finally Nears Passage;
No Limits on Card Giants
A Day Trader's Bills Come Due
By MICHAEL SCHROEDER and SUEIN HWANG
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

After eight years of trying, Congress next week is expected to pass
legislation aimed at a growing problem: Encouraged by mass mailings
from the credit-card industry, more and more consumers are taking on
more debt than they can handle and ending up in bankruptcy court.

The law, crafted with industry help and backed by President Bush, takes
the firm view that this is the borrower's problem, not the industry's.
The bill would swing the legal pendulum on this long-running issue in
favor of creditors.

Credit-card companies, banks and their allies say the legislation, the
biggest change to U.S. bankruptcy law since 1978, is an overdue
correction to a system that is biased in favor of borrowers and too
often protects deadbeats. Opponents condemn the bill as an overreaction
that will inflict pain on consumers overwhelmed by debt that they can't
pay because of health problems or layoffs.

The new law would require debtors to receive credit counseling and
would put up other hurdles to make filing for bankruptcy more
difficult. It would make it harder for consumers to wipe out
credit-card bills and other loans that aren't secured by a house or
other asset. And it would require the bankruptcy court to apply strict
tests to be sure people with the means to do so repay some of their
debts.

The legislation could have big repercussions for consumers, creditors
and the economy. Will thousands of debt-laden families pay back more of
the money they owe? Or will the extra burden push more of them into
poverty? Will banks, credit-card companies and others lend more readily
because they're more likely to get paid back? Or will people borrow and
spend less, depressing the economy?

The law would make things tougher for consumers like Crystal Herndon, a
single mom in Hayward, Calif., who makes $15 an hour handling accounts
for a janitorial firm. When she got sick with pneumonia in late 2003,
she missed six weeks of work and ran up more than $5,000 in medical
bills. Soon, she was falling behind on her car payments and owed
various creditors about $15,808. &quot;I was head over heels in bills. I
wanted to pay them off, but I knew I couldn't,&quot; she says.

In February 2004, Ms. Herndon filed for bankruptcy protection, winning
a court-approved plan to wipe out some debts and pay back others. The
court knocked several thousand dollars off her car loan and slashed the
interest rate to 10% from 18.6%. Her monthly payment dropped by nearly
$100 to $275.

Under the bill that passed the Senate in March and is expected to clear
the House of Representatives next week, a bankruptcy judge wouldn't be
allowed to lower car payments for debtors like Ms. Herndon.

The success of the bankruptcy legislation, which came close to being
passed several times over the past eight years, would be a major
victory for the Bush administration's economic and political agenda. In
February, the president signed a landmark class-action law that makes
it easier for corporate defendants to move cases to federal court.
Meanwhile, however, the administration's efforts to rein in lawsuits on
asbestos claims and medical malpractice are facing big battles.

The bankruptcy legislation also is consistent with President Bush's
emphasis on personal responsibility -- a view embodied in his approach
to Social Security, health insurance and home ownership. By fostering
what he calls an &quot;ownership&quot; society, in which people take more risks
but potentially enjoy greater rewards, Mr. Bush believes that he can
transform individual behavior and Americans' relationship with
government.

The long battle over the bankruptcy bill coincides with a surge in
borrowing by American families. Lenders, particularly companies
pitching credit cards and home-equity loans, have given credit to many
who wouldn't have qualified a generation or two ago. Americans
currently owe $2.12 trillion, not counting their mortgages, 110% more
than they did a decade ago, the Federal Reserve Board says. Their
financial assets have risen 94% in the same period and their incomes
have gone up by 65%.

In 2001, the typical credit-card holder had five cards and a balance of
$1,900, according to a Fed survey. About 83% of college undergraduates
had credit cards in 2001, up from 67% just three years earlier,
according to a survey by Nellie Mae Corp., a student-loan company.

As credit spread, more families sought to unload their debts in
bankruptcy court. Last year, 1.59 million people filed for personal
bankruptcy, up from 780,000 a decade earlier. At least $40 billion in
debt is wiped out annually through personal bankruptcy, according to an
industry-sponsored study in 1998 by the WEFA Group, now part of Global
Insight, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm.

More than 70% of the filings fall under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy
code. The provision allows consumers to erase credit-card, medical and
many other debts -- but not alimony, child support, student loans or
most taxes -- after certain assets such as savings are liquidated to
benefit creditors. If people want to hold onto their homes and cars,
they file under Chapter 13, in which the court approves a
debt-repayment plan. In some cases, judges require filers who have
enough income and assets to file under Chapter 13.

Chapter 13 debtors paid creditors $4.2 billion in 2003. Chapter 7
filers turned over $1.5 billion in assets disbursed to creditors,
according to the U.S. Office of Bankruptcy Trustees.

All sides expect the bill to reduce the number of bankruptcy filings
because filing will be more costly and more of a hassle. Most experts
expect it to push thousands of debtors, particularly those with
above-average incomes, into Chapter 13 plans instead of Chapter 7 --
forcing them to repay more debts. A key change in the new law is that
it would block from Chapter 7 debtors with incomes above their state's
median and with the means to pay some debts.

The legislation includes a raft of other provisions backed by
creditors. People filing for bankruptcy would be required to undergo
credit counseling at their expense six months before filing. Debtors
would have to repay the full amount of loans on cars purchased within
30 months of filing. That's the provision that would snare those like
Ms. Herndon. Filers would, for the first time, have to document income
with pay stubs and tax returns.

Consumer groups are unhappy that the legislation does little to hold
the financial-services industry responsible for the easy access to
credit they have been offering consumers. Democrats sought
unsuccessfully to have the bill put limits on marketing to students
under age 18 and cap some credit-card interest rates.

The bill also clamps down on repeat filers. No one, for instance, would
be allowed to file a Chapter 13 petition more than once every two
years, the first such limit.

That would affect people like James and Angela Lawrence of Glen St.
Mary, Fla., who have filed for Chapter 13 in each of the past three
years. The last filing, in February, showed debt of about $85,000,
including the outstanding balance on an $11,000 loan to buy furniture
from W.S. Badcock Corp., a Mulberry, Fla.-based home-furnishings
retailer. The firm, which has 350 outlets in the South, says about
1,000 of its customers file for bankruptcy each month. Mr. Lawrence
says he and his wife haven't stuck to their Chapter 13 repayment plans
because they have been periodically unemployed.

&quot;We filed under [Chapter] 13 so we could keep our stuff,&quot; including a
four-bedroom mobile home and a 1999 Buick, he says. The current
four-year repayment plan calls for monthly payments to their bankruptcy
trustee of $1,104 -- or about a quarter of the $55,000 the couple now
earns before taxes. He works at a construction firm, she at the Florida
corrections department.

Entrepreneurs like James and Cindy Curry, who filed for bankruptcy in
January, would face a tougher time under the new law. After more than
13 years at Compaq Corp., Ms. Curry decided to retire and open a beer
and wine bar in rural Texas. Despite her good credit, Ms. Curry found
banks unwilling to lend her enough money to open. She took thousands of
dollars of cash advances from her personal credit cards. The Currys
opened their bar, Texas Thunder, in August of 2002.

But in August of 2004, business suddenly slowed, and the couple fell
behind in their credit-card payments, causing the interest on one of
them to rocket to 28.74%. Then in September, Ms. Curry suffered a
serious bout of diverticulitis. After three days in the hospital, the
couple owed $12,000. &quot;With both things hitting at one time there was
nothing else we could do,&quot; says Ms. Curry, 43. &quot;I cried a lot.&quot;

Under the current laws, the couple was able to file a Chapter 7
bankruptcy, which cost them $1,909 in legal fees. But according to
Henry Sommer, president of the National Association of Consumer
Bankruptcy Attorneys, under the new legislation the couple's attorney
would have to argue that the Currys should be allowed to file Chapter 7
because of &quot;special circumstances.&quot; If the court ruled against them,
the Currys would have to decide whether to try to create a payment plan
under Chapter 13, even though their profits after business expenses are
barely enough to keep them alive. As a result, the best-case scenario
for the Currys is a higher legal bill.

Fortunately for the Currys, the legislation wouldn't go into effect
until six months after the president signs it. &quot;I just feel lucky we
got in when we did,&quot; Ms. Curry says.

Whether a higher hurdle for bankruptcy filings is a good thing is the
subject of heated debate. Economist Lawrence Ausubel of the University
of Maryland says more people would be pushed into &quot;informal
bankruptcy&quot;: &quot;You hang up ...

&gt;From what I've heard, the new laws aren't nearly strong enough.

"/> Apparently the scumbags who declare bankruptcy won't have to lose any
of their IRA, 401K, or Social Security benefits. This is terrible.
This gives people more incentive to declare bankruptcy because they can
keep their enormous compounded tax-free retirement accounts.

One form of karma might occur from the above law: if an individual
invested in crooked companies such as Kmart, Conseco, and Worldcom,
lost it all when those corrupt companies declared bankruptcy, then the
individual declares bankruptcy, he/she has nothing to preserve in the
retirement account because the companies did the same thing he/she did.

The best bankruptcy law: no individual or business should be allowed to
declare bankruptcy. If you can't pay your debts, all your assets
should be liquidated.

The only legit reason to declare bankruptcy I can think of is if an
individual is forced to undergo medical treatment and the hospital
overcharges and/or the insurance unfairly denies the claim.

If I used all the credit I've been given via cards, I'd owe about $120K
on an RNs salary.

To be fair, a lot of people use credit cards as a last resort for daily
needs when they are buried with medical bills/unemployment/etc. So they
look like they've been out buying diamond underwear or something because
they go bankrupt with credit cards.

On the other hand, I personally know several people who simply lived
high off credit and couldn't pay it. No medical problems, no job loss.
Just immature greedy living. And that bothers me a great deal. One guy
spent and spent and declared bankruptcy (was being supported by
significant other, not married) and *framed* the bankruptcy certificate
and hung it up. A disgrace.

"/> Don't like bankruptcy? I assume you're equally in favor of abolishing
corporations. A corporation is a legal contrivance which shields
investors from any personal liability for a business that loses money.

The fact is, people sometimes go under, leaving companies holding the
bag. But that's already built into credit rates. That's why this lady
had an 18.6% car loan, whereas you probably do not. It's why credit
card companies can charge hefty 20%+ interest (to certain customers),
and payday-loan places can charge 650% APR to really desperate people.

There's no free lunch. Companies that want a risk-free 20% or 650%
annual return on their money have another thing coming.

Because it isn't secured.

The lender protected himself by securing the property. Without that security
there would not have been a loan and there would not have been a business or
jobs.

The employee, should he be concerned, can negotiate with the employer to
secure some unencumbered property as security for his wages. And walk away if
the employer will not agree.

Following your rules, if the company purchased a property with a mortgage and
went bankrupt, the bank (and thus it shareholders - many of whom are widows
and orphans) would lose their money as the property would be granted to the
employees.

Do you really think that is right or just?

:&gt;What pointless nastiness.

Not nastiness. Reality.

If you never were a business owner (and never entertained the possibility of
being one), you would not realize the risks that the owner takes.

The more money and the more risk that you require them to put in the business,
the less likely they are willing to open it. They can always put their money
in a mix of bonds and stock index funds and make a much safer return.

:&gt;&gt;Try thinking hard and look at it from the owner/investors point of view. Make
:&gt;&gt;it too expensive to open a business and they won't open it. Or they will open
:&gt;&gt;it overseas.

:&gt;Policy choices are policy choices. Plain and simple.

Exactly.

Do you feel that the best way to protect the worker is to make sure that there
are less jobs?

Especially with high unemployment?

Sort of like killing the chicken to make it chicken soup for its' cold?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Under the bill that passed the Senate in March and is expected to clear

&gt;&gt; Nor should they. In what way is that lender responsible for Crystal's

&gt;&gt;&gt;The bankruptcy legislation also is consistent with President Bush's

consumers.&quot; Well I agree. Credit is too easy (for thieves) to obtain today.
Fixing that problem won't help your catastrophically ill person or your
soldier because their financial problems didn't stem from too-easy credit,
so why bring them up here? There are only two sets of people that addressing
the easy-credit problem will help:

1) Those who would be financially stable if only they had the willpower to
resist all those instant-credit lures to buy stuff they don't need.

2) Those who do have the willpower but get &quot;loaned&quot; the money against their
will because fuckass outfits like Choicepoint are warezing their social
security numbers all over the place and that's all it takes to get a loan.

I'm asking why the Demmies only seem to be interested in helping the first
group when it's only the second group that deserves help.

:&gt;&gt;Exactly.

:&gt;&gt;Do you feel that the best way to protect the worker is to make sure that there

:&gt;When a business is in Chapter 7 bankruptcy you'r not doing much to
:&gt;save worker jobs. Giving a preference to the unpaid workers is not an
:&gt;unreasonable policy choice. Of course it's an unlikely one, given that
:&gt;capital writes the rules.

Are you suggesting changing the rules after the bank has loaned the money?

Will you allow them a day to call in their loans before stealing their money?

Obviously once the bankruptcy occurs, it is too late.

The issue is if the rules do not allow a lender a security interest they will
loan less at higher rates.

Thus the investor has to risk more - which may cause the business not to be
opened and the jobs not created.

:&gt;&gt;Especially with high unemployment?

:&gt;&gt;Sort of like killing the chicken to make it chicken soup for its' cold?

:&gt;I'm merely pointing out it's a policy choice. You seem unable to grasp
:&gt;that simple point.

I understand the point.

I was demonstrating what would happen if that policy choice was made. It is
anti-business and would lead to less jobs being created.

"/> That's still only 15 days of sweat equity - how many secured loans are for
such a short period?

Another factor to consider is employees don't have long-term loan schedules.
Employees are at-will - they can decide to stop lending sweat equity to the
company at any time, without notice, and demand immediate remittance for all
accrued vacation days, etc., no matter how inconvenient it is to the debtor.
And employees usually know well in advance when their company's in financial
trouble - they have plenty of time to bail out. While employers often have
the same at-will rights in theory, in practice, an employer that tries to
close this particular sweat-equity loan arrangement is often threatened with
lawsuits and is often forced to pay out hefty cancellation fees (known in
some circles as &quot;severance pay&quot;).

Given all that, I don't pity them too much for being placed lower in prioity
than secured creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If you work in a market segment where operations go bust
&gt;&gt;&gt;much, you should allow for that in your personal finances.

&gt;&gt;But you do not work.

&gt; You have absolutely no idea at all what I do, salesfuckwit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Speaking of corporate bankruptcies, why are employees at the end of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;line when creditors are paid?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1. They are not at the end.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Why should they have priority over those with secured debt?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Having been in this situation I can assure you that employees rarely get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anything.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You cant assure anyone of anything, you will never
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ever see more than a pathetically inadequate sample.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And they clearly got their wages before it went bust anyway.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not aways true.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Its always true that they did get paid wages at some time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If they were stupid enough to work for an operation that didnt
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pay them their wages, ever, they've only got themselves to blame
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if they end up without any wages paid at all when they go bust.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, some might choose to operate like that, but those that do should
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;obviously rank behind secured creditors if they choose to do that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I know of companies that went bell up in the middle of a pay period or,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;worse yet, a day or two before pay day.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They would obviously have been paying wages before that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Before you say that only means a few days of pay keep in mind that some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;companies only pay twice a month.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A couple of week's wages is hardly the end of civilisation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;as we know it compared with what is owed to the secured
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;creditors who will mostly lose much more than that when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what they are owed isnt paid in full.

&gt;&gt;&gt; For someone like who who does not work it means nothing.

&gt;&gt; Even a pathetic salesfuckwit should be able to bullshit its way
&gt;&gt; out of its predicament better than that pathetic effort, crapchild.

&gt;&gt; I've worked for many more years than you ever have, crapchild.

&gt;&gt; And doing much more useful work than you have ever managed,
&gt;&gt; and been paid a hell of a lot better than you as well thanks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyone with a clue wont need to slash their wrists if they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;dont get a couple of week's wages and they will clearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not be getting wages after the company has gone bust.

&gt; Most of the bankruptcies with medical expenses had coverage and then

:&gt;&gt;Are you suggesting changing the rules after the bank has loaned the money?

:&gt;Gee sort of like the bankruptcy law just did to all the borrowers?

So your class of borrowers took the loans with the intent of going bankrupt?

They would not have taken the same loans at the same rates if they thought
that the bankruptcy laws would change?

Think about it.

The borrowers, if they are honest, did not take the loan with the intent of
declaring bankruptcy and would have taken the same loan at the same terms even
if the bankruptcy rules were different. They are not damaged by the change.

A lender, on the other hand, makes larger loans at lower interest rates for
secured loans. If they had known that they could not secure the loan they
would have loaned less at much higher rates.

Got it now?

:&gt;&gt;Will you allow them a day to call in their loans before stealing their money?

:&gt;&gt;Obviously once the bankruptcy occurs, it is too late.

:&gt;&gt;The issue is if the rules do not allow a lender a security interest they will
:&gt;&gt;loan less at higher rates.

:&gt;&gt;Thus the investor has to risk more - which may cause the business not to be
:&gt;&gt;opened and the jobs not created.

:&gt;Sheesh. You seem totally incapable in thinking of possibilities
:&gt;outside the status quo. That was the full sum and substance of my
:&gt;comment. You seem to want to just keep making that point over and
:&gt;over.

Because you haven't addressed it.

Your rule change makes business loans a lot more risky.

Not just a little more risky. A lot more risky.

The security interest puts you first in line up to the value of the object.
That encourages larger loans.

How many banks will lend 400K for a building with just a &quot;priority interest&quot;
(whatever that is)?

Now address the question:

Who will loan large sums to such a company without a security interest, as you

&gt;Once again, that's by their own choice. They should never have turned

OK, maybe you saved six months worth of your salary. Then maybe it
takes longer to find your next job.

"/> :&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; :&gt; Speaking of corporate bankruptcies, why are employees at the
:&gt;end of
:&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; :&gt;the line when creditors are paid?

:&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; 1. They are not at the end.

:&gt;&gt; :&gt;where are they?

:&gt;&gt; As I understand it, before other unsecured creditors and
:&gt;shareholders.

:&gt;OK. I understand. There's no real reason for this priority but it is
:&gt;as it is.

The reason to place them before unsecured creditors is social needs - the
creditor could have secured the loan but chose to charge a higher rate. It is
a lot harder for an employee to secure their salary.

The shareholders are the owners. Obviously they get nothing until all
creditors are paid.

:&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; 2. Why should they have priority over those with secured debt?

:&gt;&gt; :&gt;theyre the least likely to be able to absorb a loss.

:&gt;&gt; Even if true, not a good enough reason.

:&gt;&gt; You want to change the rules and declare that loans to companies
:&gt;cannot be
:&gt;&gt; secured, fine.

:&gt;There are other ways to view this. There can be other solutions. For
:&gt;instance, non-management wages could be put on an equal footing with
:&gt;secured loans.

They cannot be on &quot;equal footing&quot;.

Either the loan is secured or it is not.

:&gt;&gt; Just don't be surprised when businesses are shut down (and workers
:&gt;put out of
:&gt;&gt; work) as the lenders close down the loans, and don't be surprised
:&gt;when less
:&gt;&gt; new jobs are created.

:&gt;Should labors who do not get paid for their labor care about being put
:&gt;out of
:&gt;work?

Once the company crashes it is too late. The jobs are lost anyway.

The issue is what should be done as the company is forming.

Do you want to make it harder for companies to open?

That will have the natural effect of producing fewer jobs.

:&gt; Risk should command a premium.

Certainly does.

Now allowing a creditor to secure their loan to a company increases the risk,
which leads to higher rates and smaller amounts loaned.

:&gt; Is capital better off without
:&gt;labor than
:&gt;labor is without scheduled wages?

&quot;than labor is without capital&quot; would be a valid comparison.

And the answer is that capital is better off, as it can be used in many more
way.

:&gt; It seems to me it's not so much
:&gt;workers
:&gt;would be put out of work but rather they would assume some level of
:&gt;risk for
:&gt;scheduling their own wages as the middlemen were cut out of the labor
:&gt;market.

Yes, the workers would have to place their homes at risk to form companies.

Do you think most employees would like to bet their house on their job?

Those that would, already do. They start small businesses.

:&gt;Capital would have no where else to go. If it sat idle it would be
:&gt;consumed.

Capital has plenty of places to go.

:&gt;Let's make it harder for the owners of companies to limit their
:&gt;financial
:&gt;liabilities and put them on a par with labor.

It isn't the company, it is the investors.

You make them take more risks, they need to see higher potential returns. They
don't see it, they can go overseas or into bonds or indices - either of which
are relatively safe.

:&gt; If capital should be
:&gt;able
:&gt;to walk away without honoring its debts then so should labor.

What is this &quot;capital walking away&quot;? The shareholders are paid last.

The issue is the secured creditors.

:&gt; If labor
:&gt;must honor its debts then so should capital.

Who or what is this &quot;capital&quot; that has debts?

:&gt; Let the markets settle
:&gt;the
:&gt;risk premiums in an open and fair way. Government should be giving
:&gt;preferential
:&gt;treatment to certain classes of people.

It isn't government giving &quot;preferential treatment to certain classes of
people&quot;. That is the entire concept of a secured loan, that the secured
creditor is first in getting his money out of the security.

If it is more than the loan, the remainder goes to the creditors.

If the security is worth less than the loan, the creditor gets the securities
value and is then an unsecured creditor for the remainder.

As I said, you want to make rules that creditors cannot secure loans to
companies, fine. Just be aware of the consequences in starting new businesses.

Require companies to post a bond for $$$$ days of salaries. Do not be

You seem to forget that the creditor is not an officer of the company.

The creditor would not make the same loan at the same terms without the
security.

That is a secured loan - the security is not available to pay for anyone else
until the secured debt holder is paid.

:&gt;The books should be opened to labor so they can know the risk they are

The employees are free to do that as a condition of taking the job. Do not be
surprised that if there is a large labor pool that they will choose those that
give smaller hassles (unless there are special skills). If there is a small
labor pool (or they need the special skill) the employer will be more willing
to come to arrangements.

George - have you read the legislation or just the soundbites?

First - there is no prohibition against filing bankruptcy - just that
there is a means test to determine if it Chapter 13 or Chapter 7
filing. Chapter 13 requires you to pay back some of your debts. The
means test is set somewhere around the median income level in most
states. In other words, people with good jobs but large debts no
longer skate. People with low wage jobs or no jobs, get the same
treatment as before.

Regarding military - the Dems original ammendment (Durbin, IL, I think
was the sponsor or cosponsor) would hae exempt ALL military personal
and veterans from the legislation. This is obviously wrong. The
argument goes that ``We're penalizing members of our military because
they've lost some of their income serving America,...&quot; This is clearly
bullshit. If in fact we pay military personnel so poorly (or
non-competitively) then we need to fix military pay scales, not through
them charity bones.

Now, you might want to argue that in the case of reservists, for
example, when they are called up, they incur some possible financial
burdens - cut in wages, etc. And you would be right. However, the
current law protects these individuals from creditors (all they need to
do is to apply) andmoreover, the new bankruptcy legislation expressly
provides for them by allowing judges to make a case by case
determination of eligibility for Chapter 7 filing in the case of active
duty military personnel and those with medical disabilities.

So the safety net is there and addresses the specific conditions on a
case by case basis, as opposed to giving a blanket perk across a class
regardless of any defined or documented need.

Basically, folks that get in over their heads because they over consume
(live a $100K lifestyle on a $75K salary) no longer get away with it.

What is most infuriating is that the bad debt writeoffs that result
from Chapter 7 filings are paid for by those who are rational and
prudent consumers. Makes you want to vomit. Here you are driving a 5
year old Chevy Tahoe and the guy next door has a brand new tricked out
Escalade or beamer.

"/> I just HATE this statistic - all of a sudden medical COSTS drive people
to bankruptcy. That is not what the data show. The data show that in
a large number of cases, medical problems precede bankruptcy - and the
intervening but uncontrolled variable is JOB LOSS. The authors of the
report discuss this in their linmitations section - you ought to read
it.

Job loss coupled with high debt are the explanatory variables in
bankruptcy. Illness (long term) and injury (disabling) can precipitate
job loss.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Speaking of corporate bankruptcies, why are employees at the
end of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;line when creditors are paid?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1. They are not at the end.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Why should they have priority over those with secured
debt?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Having been in this situation I can assure you that employees
rarely get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anything.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You cant assure anyone of anything, you will never
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ever see more than a pathetically inadequate sample.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And they clearly got their wages before it went bust anyway.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not aways true.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Its always true that they did get paid wages at some time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If they were stupid enough to work for an operation that didnt
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pay them their wages, ever, they've only got themselves to blame
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if they end up without any wages paid at all when they go bust.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, some might choose to operate like that, but those that do
should
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;obviously rank behind secured creditors if they choose to do
that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I know of companies that went bell up in the middle of a pay
period or,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;worse yet, a day or two before pay day.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They would obviously have been paying wages before that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Before you say that only means a few days of pay keep in mind
that some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;companies only pay twice a month.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A couple of week's wages is hardly the end of civilisation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;as we know it compared with what is owed to the secured
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;creditors who will mostly lose much more than that when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what they are owed isnt paid in full.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For someone like who who does not work it means nothing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Even a pathetic salesfuckwit should be able to bullshit its way
&gt;&gt;&gt; out of its predicament better than that pathetic effort,
crapchild.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've worked for many more years than you ever have, crapchild.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And doing much more useful work than you have ever managed,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and been paid a hell of a lot better than you as well thanks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyone with a clue wont need to slash their wrists if they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;dont get a couple of week's wages and they will clearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not be getting wages after the company has gone bust.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Tell you what, let's see what you do when your next welfare check
never
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;comes.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've told you before, that I have never ever had even
&gt;&gt;&gt; a cent in welfare, ever, you silly little lying salesfuckwit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you work in a market segment where operations go bust
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;much, you should allow for that in your personal finances.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But you do not work.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You have absolutely no idea at all what I do, salesfuckwit.

&gt;&gt; No, because you are to embarrassed to tell us. Let me guess:

&gt;&gt; Professor of English at a major university.
&gt;&gt; PR Director for a large multinational firm.
&gt;&gt; Proofreader for a major publication.

&gt; Even a pathetic salesfuckwit should be able to bullshit its way
&gt; out of its predicament better than that pathetic effort, crapchild.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No operation I have ever worked for ever went bust either.

&gt;&gt; Welfare systems never do.

&gt; Never ever worked for any of those either, unlike some
&gt; pathetic parasite with delusions that its a bicycle that cant
&gt; manage anything better than sucking at one of those govt teats.

&gt; No surprises there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Speaking of corporate bankruptcies, why are employees at
the
&gt;&gt; end of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;line when creditors are paid?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1. They are not at the end.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Why should they have priority over those with secured
&gt;&gt; debt?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Having been in this situation I can assure you that
employees
&gt;&gt; rarely get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anything.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You cant assure anyone of anything, you will never
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ever see more than a pathetically inadequate sample.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And they clearly got their wages before it went bust anyway.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not aways true.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Its always true that they did get paid wages at some time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If they were stupid enough to work for an operation that didnt
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pay them their wages, ever, they've only got themselves to
blame
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if they end up without any wages paid at all when they go
bust.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, some might choose to operate like that, but those that do
&gt;&gt; should
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;obviously rank behind secured creditors if they choose to do
&gt;&gt; that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I know of companies that went bell up in the middle of a pay
&gt;&gt; period or,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;worse yet, a day or two before pay day.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They would obviously have been paying wages before that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Before you say that only means a few days of pay keep in mind
&gt;&gt; that some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;companies only pay twice a month.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A couple of week's wages is hardly the end of civilisation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;as we know it compared with what is owed to the secured
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;creditors who will mostly lose much more than that when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what they are owed isnt paid in full.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For someone like who who does not work it means nothing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Even a pathetic salesfuckwit should be able to bullshit its way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out of its predicament better than that pathetic effort,
&gt;&gt; crapchild.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've worked for many more years than you ever have, crapchild.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And doing much more useful work than you have ever managed,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and been paid a hell of a lot better than you as well thanks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyone with a clue wont need to slash their wrists if they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;dont get a couple of week's wages and they will clearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not be getting wages after the company has gone bust.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Tell you what, let's see what you do when your next welfare
check
&gt;&gt; never
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;comes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've told you before, that I have never ever had even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a cent in welfare, ever, you silly little lying salesfuckwit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you work in a market segment where operations go bust
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;much, you should allow for that in your personal finances.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But you do not work.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You have absolutely no idea at all what I do, salesfuckwit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, because you are to embarrassed to tell us. Let me guess:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Professor of English at a major university.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PR Director for a large multinational firm.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Proofreader for a major publication.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Even a pathetic salesfuckwit should be able to bullshit its way
&gt;&gt;&gt; out of its predicament better than that pathetic effort,
crapchild.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No operation I have ever worked for ever went bust either.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Welfare systems never do.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Never ever worked for any of those either, unlike some
&gt;&gt;&gt; pathetic parasite with delusions that its a bicycle that cant
&gt;&gt;&gt; manage anything better than sucking at one of those govt teats.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No surprises there.

&gt;&gt; If it wasn't for me, deadbeats like you wouldn't have a pot to piss
in,
&gt;&gt; welfare cheat.

&gt; Not a fucking clue, as always. No wonder the
&gt; best it can manage is sucking at some govt teat.

If one has other assets, why not?

Not that I think that the bankrupted person should be stripped bare, but he
should not be able to retain more than $X where X is reasonable for a certain
amount of time. When he gets back on his feet he should pay off the debts.

:&gt;The company may secure the debts but the owners of the company are

What you are requesting is the removal of the concept that a corporation is a
&quot;person&quot;.

That has ramifications as well. Currently an investor/shareholder knows that
he cannot lose more than his investment.

Now you would make the shareholder personally responsible for the corporate
debt.

You do realize that this will pretty much shut down VC firms because they
don't have the ability to be intensely involved in every investment.

Again the result is less new jobs.

The shareholders are paid a dividend for their investment. They are not given
it for nothing.

Current law allows the corporate veil to be pierced and the officeholders and
directors to be personally sued if they did not act properly.

As I said, this approach means that a corporation will no longer be considered
a person. Can be done, but has effects.

:&gt;&gt; don't have the ability to be intensely involved in every investment.

False. You will need MORE execs (in each company) as each investor will want
to make sure that they are not personally liable for any losses.

True, in the net there will be fewer execs, but that is because there will be
fewer companies and fewer jobs in general.

And how will this stop job export? You think the other countries will make
laws that will reduce investment? Unless all do, those that do will lose. And
if all do, some will not get investment at all - thus they will not.

Why not get your buddy union bosses to actually create companies? Plenty of
$$$$ in the union slush funds. Then you can decide to pay the workers more and
have the union lose money.

I would not be surprised if unions - right now - have outsourced some of their
own workers in order to save money.

"/> Since 1986 the U.S. federal government has been rewarding
American corporations for exporting as many jobs as possible
overseas. At that time a proposal to change our tax law (to tax
income from foreign production, which would have removed
the financial incentive to export American jobs) was nixed at
the insistence of then president Reagan. The exodus of quality
American jobs started shortly thereafter and has been increasing
ever since.

Clinton likes to brag about creating 18 million jobs, the fact of
the matter is that most of these jobs (with the exception of the
high-tech bubble) were shit service sector jobs. Manufacturing
and other quality jobs have been on a steady decline since 1986.

It is now more profitable to export jobs because OUR OWN
GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IT SO, NOT because U.S.
workers are somehow greedy or overpaid or lazy.

:&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; Gasp.

:&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; The shareholders wish to pay a bonus because the CEO made them more profits??

:&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; How dare they!

:&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt;&lt;/Sarcasm&gt;

:&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; :&gt; It's corporate greed and immorality on a scale
:&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; :&gt;never seen before on planet Earth.

:&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; What is immoral about shareholders wishing larger profits and CEO's doing what
:&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; the shareholders want?

:&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; :&gt;That's not what happened in this case. Just one minor example of this
:&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; :&gt;can be found here:  http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2003-100.htm

:&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; True.

:&gt;&gt; :&gt;&gt; Don't see what it has to do with my statement.

:&gt;&gt; :&gt;Don't or refuse to?

:&gt;&gt; Don't.

:&gt;&gt; :&gt;The fact is, HP shareholders got two things out of the Compaq
:&gt;&gt; :&gt;merger. Diddly and squat. And Carly? She pocketed $22M.

:&gt;&gt; She ripped them off.

:&gt;&gt; :&gt;Oh and 20,000 Americans had their jobs shipped to Asian
:&gt;&gt; :&gt;sweatshops. Yes indeed, corporate America at its finest.

:&gt;&gt; The corporate officers should be working to increase the shareholders profits.

:&gt;&gt; If the US workers supply a unique skill or a fair price, it will be more
:&gt;&gt; profitable to hire them. If only generic skills are required or if the unions
:&gt;&gt; demand more than the work is worth, it will be more profitable to move the
:&gt;&gt; jobs overseas.

:&gt;Since 1986 the U.S. federal government has been rewarding
:&gt;American corporations for exporting as many jobs as possible
:&gt;overseas. At that time a proposal to change our tax law (to tax
:&gt;income from foreign production, which would have removed
:&gt;the financial incentive to export American jobs) was nixed at
:&gt;the insistence of then president Reagan. The exodus of quality
:&gt;American jobs started shortly thereafter and has been increasing
:&gt;ever since.

The corporate structures van easily be changed to handle higher taxes. It
would be pointless for the US government to play this game.

:&gt;Clinton likes to brag about creating 18 million jobs, the fact of
:&gt;the matter is that most of these jobs (with the exception of the
:&gt;high-tech bubble) were shit service sector jobs. Manufacturing
:&gt;and other quality jobs have been on a steady decline since 1986.

:&gt;It is now more profitable to export jobs because OUR OWN
:&gt;GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IT SO, NOT because U.S.
:&gt;workers are somehow greedy or overpaid or lazy.

False.

:&gt;&gt; Why are shareholders, many of whom are widows and orphans, required to support
:&gt;&gt; union fatcats? Why should their pension money be reduced so that union members
:&gt;&gt; can be paid more than what they are worth?

:&gt;Union fatcats? Paid more than they're worth?? You're stuck
:&gt;in the year 1960, pal. Corporations are outsourcing $8/hour
:&gt;and $10/hour jobs to India for chrissakes. And you're claiming
:&gt;these Americans were being paid more than they're worth?

If A will do the job for $5 and B will do the exact same job for $10, yes, if
the officers paid B to do the work instead of A they would be paying more than
the work is worth and would be stealing the shareholders money.

:&gt;You should come to my part of the U.S. and see PhDs and
:&gt;people with masters degrees pumping gas and bussing tables
:&gt;for a living. Yeah, they sure are being paid more than they're
:&gt;worth aren't they.

If no one will hire them at higher amounts, yes, they are being paid what they
are worth - the pay for pumping gas.

The USA is not a communist country.

You do not get a premium because you spent eight years in college studying
poetry - unless someone wishes to pay you for those skills or the education
allows you to write a book that sells.

:&gt;&gt; Why not get your buddy union bosses to actually create companies? Plenty of
:&gt;&gt; $$$$ in the union slush funds. Then you can decide to pay the workers more and
:&gt;&gt; have the union lose money.

:&gt;&gt; I would not be surprised if unions - right now - have outsourced some of their
:&gt;&gt; own workers in order to save money.

:&gt;Union bashing has become a caricature of itself. There is no
:&gt;major union power any more --

There still are some cells.

I still remember not being able to get higher raises because of unions. I was
able to automate jobs, but, sadly, due to union rules we had to keep the more
senior but less capable workers. Rather than reducing three positions I might
only be able to reduce 2 (and these were semi-skilled positions). My raises
were tied to how much money I could save the company.

:&gt; if there were, our current idiot
:&gt;in chief would have lost the last election by at least ten points.

Not all union members blindly pull the (D) lever nowadays - especially when
the steward doesn't get to watch the vote.

There are conflicts.

Pay the worker more that the market and the widow and orphan shareholders who
are hoping to get their mortgage payment out of the dividends will not get the
money.

Why does the union worker deserve it more?

If YOU want to hire the highest charging furnace repairman to fix YOUR
furnace, fine.

If you want to force the widow down the block to hire the highest charging
repairman, not good.

I might believe that my artwork is work $20K, but unless someone is willing to
pay $2oK for it ........................

As a side point, if the union worker is skilled and does a better job, so that
replacing him requires several overseas workers who will cost more, the union
worker will get the job.

If the $20/hour union worker does not do a better job than the foreign $5/hour
worker, why does he deserve $20/hour? Why should the widows and orphans have
to pay the extra $15/hour?

"/> What you are seeing is taxation pulling people down so they cannot
get ahead. If you've been around long enough, like I have, you have
seen the number and amount of deductions continually get eroded
away.

Credit card interest used to be deductible.
Medical expenses now have to meet or exceed 7.5% of income.
AMT can now kick in at the middle-class income levels.
and a host of other sneaky tax hikes by removing deductions.
When the government wants their money, and they know that
raising taxes will look bad for them, they simply remove deductions.

Look at some of the proposals that are waiting in the wings.....

You buy a hybrid card to save money on gas. What does the
government propose? Putting sensors in your car so that they
can tax you on your mileage! They lose on the gas tax, so they
figure out a sneaky and greedy new way to get their money.

This is called &quot;creeping socialism&quot;; and it's eating away at the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can still get in deep trouble even with health insurance. With a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;illness, the insurance usually pays about 80-90%. This mean that if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rack up a $30,000 illness, you may still have to pay $6,000. Many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;do not have $6k sitting around.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And often the companies lay off sick folks because they're not
&gt;&gt;&gt; working. They quickly move to cancel their health insurance because of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the expense. COBRA fees can be extreme. Try paying $2000/month when
&gt;&gt;&gt; you've lost your job. Some will not. Others will move to home equity
&gt;&gt;&gt; or credit cards to pay the COBRA fees. But that only works for so
&gt;&gt;&gt; long. At the end, you've got no job, and huge debt. Add in the number
&gt;&gt;&gt; of insurance claims denials and lengthy red tape put in place solely
&gt;&gt;&gt; to slow down paying out the money.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I watched a neighbor go through something like this for his daughter.
&gt;&gt;&gt; She got leukemia. She got sicker and sicker. When dead took too much
&gt;&gt;&gt; time off to care for her and take her to appointments he got fired.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The insurance company denied her treatment. He took out a second
&gt;&gt;&gt; mortgage to pay the bills to keep getting treatment for his daughter.
&gt;&gt;&gt; He fought two years with the insurance company in court. In the end
&gt;&gt;&gt; she died because he couldn't afford treatment. He lost his house and
&gt;&gt;&gt; his job. And then went bankrupt.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What kind of country allows this too happen?

&gt;&gt;What you are seeing is taxation pulling people down so they cannot
&gt;&gt;get ahead. If you've been around long enough, like I have, you have
&gt;&gt;seen the number and amount of deductions continually get eroded
&gt;&gt;away.

&gt; What idiocy. Nothing above has anything to do with taxation. AND BTW
&gt; we are one of the lowest taxed developed coutnries in the world. Go

I will take into consideration from whom I'm buying.
I leave pretty good tips. No one asks me to do so.
A few weeks ago I was at Denny's and notice how hard the
cook was working. He wasn't getting any help and I had
sat there for a couple of hours drinking coffee, waiting
for my car to be fixed. I asked the waitress if he shared
in the tip. He did not. I gave him a $10 tip on an $8 meal.
I tipped the waitress $3 besides. I seldom leave less than
$3 for the waitress/waiter.

You are wrong when you say &quot;no other consumer sets a lower bounds
on the price he's willing to pay for goods and services.&quot; I'm not
going to be as generous with the owner of the store unless I know
the details of the situation.

Fair competition is just the way it is. I don't like it when labor is

guess we could go back to might makes right. Why should a society that
doesn't respect life respect property?

&gt; The average federal tax return is 11% of income. The highest taxed

&gt; are a tax result. Gawd but boys are stupid.

&gt; Hey my burger's under cooked --- TAX CUTTT!!!!

"/> Listen jerk-ass, if you would have read the whole thread, I was repsonding
to the many ways people get pulled down. But even with that, you seem
to forget all the other little taxes moron. Are you that ignorant? Obviously
you have no idea where your money is going do you opie?

&quot;The government taxes you when you bring home a paycheck. It taxes
you when you die. It taxes you when you make a phone call. It taxes you
when you turn on a light. It taxes you when you sell a stock. It taxes you
when you fill your car with gas. It taxes you when you ride a plane. It
taxes
you when you get married. Then it taxes you when you die. This is taxual
insanity and it must end.&quot;

-- Rep. J.C. Watts (R-OK)

&quot;When you turn on the light in the morning, you pay utility taxes. When
you brush your teeth, you pay water taxes. When you drive to work, you
pay gas taxes and rising toll taxes. Before you get paid at work, they take
out payroll taxes. After you get paid at work, they take out income taxes
- state and federal. If you are married, they tax you for that too. And when

you buy things, you have to pay sales taxes and the seller's corporate
income taxes. You are probably dog tired from paying all of these taxes
when you get home at night, but then you have to pay property taxes -
which in this state are at their highest level ever. And if these high taxes

make you have to sell your home, you will then have to pay capital gains
taxes. Worse yet, if you become sick to death of all these taxes, they
will make you pay estate taxes.&quot;

-- Jersey City mayor and New Jersey GOP gubernatorial
candidate Bret Schundler

&quot;Today, the government takes some 40% of the income from the average
American worker. Most of us will work until May 3 this year just to pay
our tax burden. And incredible as it seems, many Americans don't believe
they are over-taxed! In fact, about half of us do not support across the
board tax cuts. In city after city across America, local tax referendums
will find a majority of citizens actually voting to increase their taxes.
Can
you believe it?&quot;

&quot;It's hard to imagine that it was only a generation ago when the average
married couple with two children paid only 2% of their income in federal,
state and local taxes. In 1999 that same family paid some 15% in Social
Security taxes, some 30% in federal taxes, plus hundreds of hidden taxes
on everything from amusements to zucchini, and everything in between.
The National Taxpayer's Union says taxes have gone up 175,000% in the
last 83 years! And yet many Americans don't believe they are over-taxed!
Amazing!&quot;

And the simple answer is - he does not.

What handouts?

Their money is invested in the corporation. They deserve dividends from the

You, on the other hand, demand handouts for workers simply because they are
union members.

Let the union price their workers at market rates and they will get hired.

Try to charge more than they are worth and they will tend to not be hired
unless forced to by the government.

Pork barrel spending occurs when Members of Congress use the
appropriations process to circumvent the federal funding system.
Let’s use the job-training example again. Say Congressman X wants
to engender some goodwill back home and knows that building a job
training facility will garner some positive press. So, instead of having
his/her local community make the case for expending federal funds in
this manner, which would subject this project to scrutiny, instead they
just insert the project. The appropriators will simply put in what is called

a ‘line-item’ for the amount of funding that is needed to begin to build
a whole new center, taking away resources for other job training needs
somewhere else.

Not the same as roads and sewers.

&gt; Sweeping New Bankruptcy Law To Make Life Harder for Debtors
&gt; After 8 Years, Legislation Finally Nears Passage;

"/> Take a look at the following article on personal and corporate
bankruptcy by the Republican Cato think tank:

http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/reg20n4e.html

I didn't realize that in USA bankruptcy (except for buisness owners) was
originally a felony for the debtor punishable by death! The death
penalty was replaced by 10-years in prison in 1800. At that time
creditors filed bankruptacy charges against debtors. Over the next 205
years US law has became more lenient towards debtors. According to this
article, under current law 16-24% of americans would benefit financially
by filing for bankruptcy, but less than 1% of americans actually file
for bankruptcy. The problem is that a clever deadbeat can easily shield
millions in assets under the homestead laws of certain states while
eliminating all debt. Interestingly the proposed &quot;reform&quot; does not
eliminate this loophole, it just limits it to homesteads owned for over
3 years, so more planning is required to exploit it. In addition,
unlimitted assets can be stashed in so-called Asset Protection Trusts in
many states. Not surprisingly, Cato proposes a much smaller $20-40K
exemption per person and no homestead, Asset Protection Trust or
pension/IRA exemptions.

According to Cato, the Corporate Bankruptcy code (Chapter 11) is
basically welfare for underperforming CEOs, who can extend proceedings
for years and fritter away the entire remaining assets of the company in
legal bills. This gives the CEO the power to get debtors to accept an
out-of-court settlements in which debtors lose money but the original
shareholders still get some money (The CEO typically owns lots of
stock)! If the debtors insist on a trial, they are guaranteed under
current law that either they get all their money OR the shareholders get
nothing (based on the strict debt over equity priority prescribed by
law), but then the debtors risk getting less since the CEO can fritter
away most of the corporation in legal bills over an average of 5 years
of bankruptacy proceedings. Less than 2% of corporate bankrupcy's honor
the strict debt over equity priority prescribed by law.

Cato suggests handing over the corporation to a creditors committee
after a bankruptcy filing, to insure this kind of CEO abuse of the
bankruptcy code is not possible. Shareholders are already protected by
the limited liability law which prevents creditors from coming after
shareholders personally for any unpaid debt. Limitted liability
corporations were introduced originally to formalize buisness bankruptcy
(at that time only buisness owners could file for bankruptcy), so a
corporate bankruptcy code is actually redundant. The intent of the
current corporate bankruptcy code is to protect workers in a going
concern from having the corporation's assets auctioned off piecemeal by
debtors. However if the corporation is simply handed over to debtors (by
cancelling the old stock and replacing the debt by new stock) the new
owners have no more reason than the old owners to shut down a company
that is worth more as a going concern than auctioning off its parts.

&gt;&gt;Is that a fact goober? When you pay more than 40% of your income to
&gt;&gt;taxes, it's ludacrous.

&gt; The average federal tax return is 11% of income. The highest taxed
&gt; place int he nation is considered NYC with federal state and local
&gt; taxes. On an income of $75,000 taxes are 28%.

&gt; Another right wing myth (lie).

"/> Another individual with the blinders on.

I ain't in NYC, but here's what I've got:

Federal income Tax -- 33%
SE taxes (me), Employer portion (Wife)~ 7%
FICA ~ 6.2%
Medicare ~ 1.5%
State income tax 6.9%
Local municipal tax 3.1%

O.K -- we're now up to: TOTAL 57.7%

That's off the top.

Property tax (currently about 1.2% of our income)

57.7
1.2

TOTAL 58.9

Assuming we spend all the money that's left,
we're stuck with a 6.5% sales tax

58.9
6.5

TOTAL 65.4

Now, for the nickel and dime shit -- we pay
(locally) $0.44 on every gallon of gas as the
local &quot;road tax&quot;.

Some places, that don't get enough money from
the property taxes to support the school systems,
have additional &quot;school taxes&quot;

There's taxes on our phone
bill, our cable bill, water bill, sewer bill,
electric bill, etc.

We have to pay every year to &quot;register&quot; our
vehicles. That's a tax. Plain and simple.

There's a &quot;syrup tax&quot; on any sodas you buy.

There's a &quot;sin tax&quot; in every bottle of alcohol
you buy and every pack of smokes you buy.

There's a &quot;hotel tax&quot; every time you stay at
the local Holliday in.

Hunting, fishing, and trapping licenses are
nothing more than taxes to make the payroll
for the Rangers.

There's Unemployment taxes for employees.

There's toll roads -- a tax on the use of the
roads.

Assuming you don't spend all your money, Uncle
Sam still wants to get his digs in -- there's
capital gains taxes on your investment earnings.

Assuming, after all this shite, that you've
managed to actually *save* anything (rather
than have the various taxing authorities steal
your hard-earned money) -- assuming there's anything
left, it's subject to estate taxes (&quot;death taxes&quot;)

There's import taxes/tarriffs/duties/etc burried
in the price of virtually all consumer goods we
buy.

I could go on and on here, but I'm limited on
time. You're insane if you think we pay low
taxes here in the states. Sure, the income
taxes are low -- but add in the rest of the
taxes most folks don't think about any you
end up having 25 cents on the dollar left
after taking taxes into consideration.

Just keep kidding yourself. No one cares.

&gt; Another individual with the blinders on.

&gt; I ain't in NYC, but here's what I've got:

&gt; Federal income Tax -- 33%

"/> You must be your own accountant, because he's an idiot.

Your TOP bracket is 33%; that is, you are paying 33% on
your income over $178,651 (assuming you're MFJ).

You don't tell us what your gross is, but in 2003, for taxpayers with
an Adjusted Gross Income over $200,000, the ratio is 1.14:1;
On a taxable income of $250,000, that would make your AGI ~$285,000.

You pay 10% on income up to $14,300. That's $1,430.
You pay 15% on income from $14,301 to $58,100. That's $6,570.
You pay 25% on income from $58,101 to $117,250. That's $14,787.
You pay 28% on income from $117,251 to $178,650. That's $17,192.
You pay 33% on income from $178,651 to $319,100.
For the sake of argument, let's assume you fall right in the middle,
with an income of $250,000. That would be $23,545, for a total of
$63,524. That is 25% of your TAXABLE income, NOT 33%. It's about 22%
of your hypothetical AGI.

Of course, your TAXABLE income is not your GROSS income.
You pay property tax (deductable), so you own (or most likely, are
paying the mortgage on) a home, and the interest on your mortgage is
also deductible.

You don't tell us what that is, but in 2002, U.S. taxpayers deducted
$336.6 billion in mortgage interest.

Did you donate to charity this year (don't forget donations to your
church, synagogue, or mosque)? Did you deduct it?

Does your wife contribute to a 401(k) plan? How about you? Got a Keough
or an IRA? All pre-tax dollars, so it doesn't show up on your taxable
income. Or are you planning to live on your Social Security check, or
maybe just be a burden on your children? Or work until you die?

Your FICA tax IS 6.2%, but only on the first $87,900 dollars you make.
That's $5,450, or 1.9% of your AGI.

Your self-employment tax is 6.2% FICA + ~1.5% Medicare. Please
don't count your wife's employer's contribution, it didn't come out
of your pocket. Of course, SE FICA is capped to the same $87,900
as regular FICA, so again amounts to 1.9% of your AGI.

Since you're S/E, it's likely you file Schedule C, and deduct business
expenses, including a portion of your home, utilities, and work
clothing, as well as get to deduct the depreciation of the value of that
SUV you use for &quot;business&quot;, the gas it consumes, and the tolls you pay.

I'm pretty sure there is no state with a flat tax rate of 6.9%
In 2004, only Ohio had a tax rate of 6.9%, and that was on income
between $100,000 and $200,000.
As with the Federal, it's graduated. For an Ohio resident:
You pay 0.743% on income up to $5,000. That's $37.15
You pay 1.486% on income up from $5,000 to $10,000. That's $74.30.
You pay 2.972% on income up from $10,000 to $15,000. That's $148.60.
You pay 3.715% on income up from $15,000 to $20,000. That's $185.75.
You pay 4.457% on income up from $20,000 to $40,000. That's $891.40.
You pay 5.201% on income up from $40,000 to $80,000. That's $2,080.40.
You pay 5.943% on income up from $80,000 to $100,000. That's $1,188.60.
You pay 6.9% on income up from $100,000 to $200,000. That's $6,900.00.

That totals up to $11,506, or an effective rate of 5.75% of your
taxable income, which must be $200,000 or less, or you would be in the
next higher bracket.
Against the guesstimated AGI of $285,000, that's 4%.

In 2003, the average cost to educate a child in Ohio was $8,435,
so if you have two kids in the school system, you're goldbricking to
the tune of $5,000 per year.

The list of exemptions to the Ohio sales tax includes food and
practically any service, so please subtract the cost of all the food you
eat before applying the sales tax.

Don't worry about the estate tax; you'd need to leave an estate of
greater than $1.5 million, and you get to exclude anything that goes to
your spouse, and all your debts.

So, as a percentage of AGI:
Federal: 22%
State: 4%
FICA: 2%
Muni: 3%
SE: 2%
Medicare: 2%

Total: 35% of AGI

So stop whining. If you don't like what you get for your money here,
leave. Better yet, move to Florida or Texas with the rest of the
innumerates, where there's no state income tax.
Of course, the property taxes are steep to make up for all that missing
income tax, unless you live in a county where you're lucky if they can
teach your kid to pick his nose.

&gt; This is not conservativism. This is not fiscal responsibility. This is
&gt; unprosecuted economic treason,

"/> It's also par for the course, if you look at all the legislation passed
in the last ten years. Economic treason, social treason, moral
treason etc. The little the poor have really is being taken away
and given to the rich.

Less than a month after our federal congresscritters passed this
bankruptcy &quot;reform&quot;, they voted to forgive over $80 billion in
debts owed by corrupt third-world shitholes, and NO ONE
even blinked an eye -- not anyone in Congress, not our media,
not the American people.
