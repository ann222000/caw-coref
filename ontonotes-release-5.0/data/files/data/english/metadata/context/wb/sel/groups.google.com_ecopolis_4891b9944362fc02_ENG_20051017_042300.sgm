Geologist urges seismic shift in process for selecting EarthScope study
sites
*************************************************************

ANN ARBOR, Mich.---EarthScope, an enormous, nationwide earth science
project, is poised to revolutionize understanding of earthquakes, fault
systems, volcanoes and the North American continent's structure.

But geologists can mine even more information from the project and
engage nonscientists of all ages if they take a radically different
approach to deciding where to focus attention and funding, said Ben van
der Pluijm, a professor of geological sciences at the University of
Michigan.

Van der Pluijm will present his ideas for such an approach---a concept
he calls GeoTraverse---on Oct.16 at a meeting of the Geological Society
of America in Salt Lake City, Utah. In addition, a workshop on the
concept, sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF), will be
held in St. Louis in February 2006.

EarthScope, an NSF-funded project designed to provide a
three-dimensional view of the geophysical processes that affect North
America, has three main parts. In one part, the San Andreas Fault
Observatory at Depth, a borehole is being drilled into the San Andreas
Fault, about halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Rock and
fluid samples will be taken, and instruments installed in the borehole
will create a kind of underground observatory for monitoring how the
fault zone changes before, during and after earthquakes.

The second part, the Plate Boundary Observatory, is a system of
instruments for studying interactions among tectonic plates---the
moving blocks of Earth on which the continents reside. The third
component of EarthScope, called USArray, will use a mobile system of
nearly 3000 scientific instruments. The instruments will move east from
California over the next decade, providing 3-D images of structures
that lie deep beneath the United States.

It is in the USArray project that geologists have an opportunity to
work together in unprecedented ways to get the biggest scientific
payoff, van der Pluijm said. The core of the project is a transportable
array of 400 portable broadband seismometers, to be placed in a grid at
intervals of about 70 kilometers (44 miles). But there's also a suite
of 2400 instruments for collecting shorter-term seismic recordings, and
deciding where to place those instruments is where GeoTraverse comes
in.

&quot;You can't adequately instrument the whole country; you've got to
select certain areas,&quot; van der Pluijm said. &quot;Typically that's done
through competition. Individuals or small groups of scientists write
proposals that compete with other scientists' proposals.&quot; The
disadvantage is, individual projects are selected in piecemeal fashion,
without considering how they relate to one another.

Instead, van der Pluijm would like to see groups of geologists identify
areas where the instruments could best be used to explore
scientifically interesting questions, but select only those areas that
can be connected into one or a few east-west transects. For example, a
single transect might pass from the active plate margin near Seattle,
through Yellowstone National Park, the New Madrid seismic zone---an
active fault in the middle Mississippi Valley that could produce
devastating earthquakes in years to come---and the southern
Appalachians. An alternative to a single transect would be a series of
shorter transects that link the most representative assortment of
sites.

Including geologically interesting National Parks such as Yellowstone
in the transect or transects would have an additional benefit, van der
Pluijm said. With its truckloads of mobile instruments, EarthScope will
attract attention whenever it rolls into a new region. Setting up
seismometers in areas the general public is already curious about would
offer opportunities to explain &quot;why we do what we do,&quot; van der Pluijm
said. &quot;People want to know why the Black Hills are where they are or
why Yellowstone is the way it is. Why not capitalize on the natural
interest and curiosity people have?&quot;

Van der Pluijm admits that getting geologists to consider new ways of
prioritizing projects will be challenging. But the payoff, he said, &quot;is
an outcome greater than the parts alone. In this case, you'll have a
cross-continent segment through the crust, across geographically
diverse and scientifically interesting areas, that will help us
understand not just the individual areas, but also their connections
and how they came together. And that, ultimately, will help us
understand how our continent came into being,&quot; serving one of the
primary goals of the EarthScope project.
