Hi all,
I`m having a clearout, and have lot of items that I want to get sold.  Items
are listed below, please contact me by email with any offers for the items
you fancy.

(1)  Nintendo Gamecube in purple.  No games included, a single Nintendo
controller, power pack and lead to connect it to you TV (The lead has a
yellow, red and white connector on the end, I can never remember what these
are called).
(2)  Bose Quiet Comfort 2 headphones.  Used but in good condition.  An
excellent pair of headphones, currently selling for £225 inc VAT direct from
Bose when new.
(3)  Bose Quiet comfort 2 headphone - faulty.  These sometimes work fine,
sometimes there is a crackle.  I think it`s a bad solder joint somewhere, if
you`re capable of doing it I`d think it would be an easy fix, but I don`t
know this for certain.  This pair of headphones is being sold for repair, so
please bear this in mind.
(4)  The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion for the XBox 360.  In new condition, I
just didn`t get into it.
(5)  A Grey PS2 controll pad.  Good condition, working fine.
(6)  Gainward Ultra 1960PCX GeForce 6600GT 128MB DDR3 PCI-E graphics card.
Working fine, supplied in the original box with driver CD (works with the
bog standard NVidia drivers you can download direct from the site).  Capable
of SLI (it was used as a second card in an SLI system, but this system has
been replaced).  Has a single VGA and a single DVI port on the rear, as well
as a port labelled TV/OUT.  I`ll try and dig the cable out for this port if
it is required.  This has a cooling fan on the card also.
(7)  ATI X1300 256 meg PCI-E graphics card.  Supplied new with a Dell
machine, pulled and replaced with the other 6600GT from the SLI system
mentioned above.  Has the same 3 ports on the rear - VGA, DVI and TV/OUT.
This is a fanless card, so good for quiet systems.  It is a normal full
height card, not a half-height card as provided with some Dell machines.
(8)  Western Digital Caviar SE SATA hard-drive.  250 gig, will be formatted
and checked before postage.  Worked fine in a PC for a year or so, plenty of
cooling.
(9)  2 x Nintendo DS consoles.  Both used, fitted with screen protectors
very soon after purchase so the underlying screens are in good condition.
Both work fine.  One was supplied through aspecial offer run by Nintendo,
resulting in 2 bonus cartridges.  1 has a demo of Metroid on it, the other
has a demo of Warioware.  These will be included with the DS that is sold
for the most money :-)
(10)  1 x G6 Lite 5 in 1 multi media card for NDS and GBA(SP).  Also a
passthrough 3 NDS cart - if you know what this is, you`ll know what it is
for and what they cost new.  If not, then I don`t think it`s for you :-)
(11)  1 x Motherboard, CPU, Heatsink and RAM bundle.  Pulled from a working
system, unable to identify the motherboard.  Has 2 x DDR slots, 2 x SDR
slots, 5 PCI, 1 AMR, 1 AGP, 2 x IDE, 1 x Floppy.  Built in PS2 keyboard and
mouse, 2 x USB, 2 x serial, 1 x parallel, 1 x Gameport, 3 x audio
input/output.  Has 256 megs of TEAM RAM installed, an Athlon 2000+ processor
and a Thermaltake TR2 fan on a large aluuminium heatsink.  There are 4
capacitors on this board showing signs of bulging, so please bid according
(but note that it worked fine when tested, and will be tested again before
posting).
(11)  1 x Floppy drive with built in USB media reader.  Marked on the front
for CF, MD, SM, MS and SD MMC.  Has a normal Floppy cable and power
connector on the rear, along with a cable to plug into a USB header on your
motherboard.  Drivers can be found within Windows IIRC - none where supplied
with this anyway, and I had it in an XP based machine.  This is a Mitsumi
device.
(12)  1 x 2 GB Mini-SD memory card, made by Sandisk.  Came from Carphone
Warehouse.  Includes the adaptor to turn it into a normal SD card also
included, so it`ll work as a normal SD card too.
(13)  1 x Reuters PWA 92100-4000 ISA card.  Not sure how I got this, no idea
if it works, sold as untested but it might be of use to someone out there?
(14)  2 x Tesco Mobile Value sim pack.  Calls are 15p per min, texts are 5p
each.
(15)  1 x Lexcron 36 in 1 USB 2.0 media reader/writer.
(16)  1 x Green Dreamcast VMU.  Still in box, new condition, marked as
&quot;NTSC:U&quot; on rear, whatever that means :-)
(17)  1 x Waverace: Blue Strom for the Nintendo Gamecube.  Good condition,
Original PAl release.
(18)  1 x Jeantec 350W ATX PSU with PFC.  Pulled from a working machine,
given a good blast with compressed air so in clean condition.
(19)  1 x Thermaltake Purepower 550W PSU.  Active PFC, ball bearing fan.
Again pulled from a workiing system and given a good blast with compressed
air.  Includes the controller that goes in a spare slot at the rear of your
case to adjust the PSU fan.
(20)  1 x PCI Dual IDE RAID controller.  Pulled from a working system
(21)  1 x Blue Belkin IDE cable.  Rounded, so not a flat ribbon cable.
Looks good in a case with the interior visible.
(22)  1 x DVD Duplicator.  It`s got a single reader, and 3 writer drives.  A
nice piece of kit, great for mass duplicating DVD`s or CD`s.  Comes with 3 x
Pioneer drives in it, all standard IDE drives.
(23)  1 x 2GB Sony Memorystick Duo.  used in a PSP for the last 2 years or
so, now replaced with a bigger card.

And I think that will do for now :-)

Please include the postage of your choice in your offer, but be aware that
if you insist on using a method with no signature on delivery I will assist
with any claim for compensation, but I will not be held responsible.  I`d
much prefer either recorded, or ideally Special Delivery, to reduce any
issues with items going missing in the post.  :-)

Thanks for looking!
