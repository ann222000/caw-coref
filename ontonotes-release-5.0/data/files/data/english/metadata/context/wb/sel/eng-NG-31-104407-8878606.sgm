Hello Facilitators

Seeking responses to a live problem I'm struggling with...

Amongst other work, I tutor on an academic programme.  The participants are in full-time work, and attend three residential workshops during the programme. They are from different organisations - they wouldn't be working together at all outside unless they were in this programme. They are formed into groups in order to research and write a group project report.  The group I'm working with has been - apparently to me - working very hard and producing high quality work ahead of deadlines.  People are based in three different countries so work between workshops is done by e-mail, teleconference and sharing up the tasks between people. We are approaching the third of the residential workshops, and the cracks are beginning to show.  The people who have been leading on the synthesis and editing of the draft report have asked me to help :

&quot;We will also really need your help in bringing the group together in order to finish it as a group effort.  Workload is not always evenly shared and some of us are getting a bit tired and frustrated.&quot;

I find myself feeling some dread and surprisingly unresourceful in the face of this request - despite some years of experience of facilitating groups.  I think that part of this is related to my perception of us not having a lot of group time at the workshop - three to four hours over the course of the two days, with many other things packed into the agenda (outside speakers, whole-group exercises, sharing with other groups, fun activities, free time etc etc).  In our group time, we need to do some project-related tasks, as well as - I hope - resolve this situation of unevenly shared workload and the frustration some people are feeling.  This feels like enough time to surface the problems, but I'm fearful that there isn't enough time to resolve them... ;-)

Observations and suggestions gratefully received - the workshop begins next Wednesday!

Kind regards

Hello Penny,

I'm sure you will get good and thoughtful responses from this list,
as well as some techniques that I don't know.  You've done an
excellent job in describing the issue and you've engaged me in
thinking about it.

You say you are feeling some &quot;dread and surprisingly unresourceful&quot;.
I ask you to examine that a bit more. If we were talking I would ask
these questions and wait for your answers before asking the next
one.   Why the dread? What do you suspect? Is it possible that you
sensed there was an issue and have let it go unattended?

Is it possible that there are one/two overacheivers who have pushed
the group to finish ahead of schedule and the others don't &quot;get&quot; it,
so that they have been unresponsive? And the overachievers have been
taking on more than they need?  ( I know,  for myself,  that
sometimes my mode of resistance to my sense of  unreasonable demands
is to let &quot;them do it.&quot;)  In other words,  I wouldn't assume that
there is a single problem person in the group who will end up feeling
attacked by the group.

What is the goal of the group exercise? Is it to learn to manage
different cultural expectations around work? To work as a cross-
cultural team? If so, I think you have a golden opportunity here, and
that this is what they are in the programme to learn.  Your group may
need to forgo some sleep/meals to resolve the issues, or not.

It sounds like a small group. Collect some data before you meet. You
could ask each person to rate each other on: the quality of their
input, timeliness of fulfilling their obligations to the group,
satisfaction in the group's collective effort. Keep it simple, (use a
three-point scale?) so that you have scores for each person from
everyone else and that person's scores. Then see what you have:
create bar charts: self compared to team perception. Use this as a
starting point for talking about how the work should be done for the
last report. Focus on future action - the personal/cultural/past
stuff/will come up but (I'm hoping) not as attacks but rather as
differences.

Story: When I was in college I lived with 4 other woman in a college-
owned house. At one point, we had a meeting to discuss getting the
household chores done. I was shocked to discover that I was the
problem. It wasn't intentional, I simply didn't realize how much more
there was to do that I had been doing. You may have such a situation.

I hope this helps.
Please let us know what happens.

Hello Penny,

You do face a difficult facilitation situation.  I agree with your sense that there is not sufficient time to surface and resolve the problems that appear to be brewing.  Perhaps it will be better to ignore them unless the prevent the group from succeeding.

My recommendation is that you begin by visualizing the outcomes you would like to see from the session, prioritize the outcomes, lay out an agenda and realistic time budget to achieve the top-priority outcomes, then trim back the agenda and time budget until it fits the time you have.  And make allowance for the likelihood that your time estimates are too low.

If you follow my recommendation, I think your dread will go away.

Hope this is of help.  Best wishes for success with your session.

Hello Penny,

&quot;I find myself feeling some dread and surprisingly unresourceful&quot;, you wrote, which mirrors the &quot;Workload is not always evenly shared (= use of resources) and some of us are getting a bit tired and frustrated.&quot; statement by the people from the group. I suspect it is an issue concerning 'involvement': their involvement to their job and yours towards the group and the interactions between the two. Also, the situation is structured in way that doesn't generated a lot of involvement. So stuckness is inevitable.

As i read your mail, i tend to think that this is not a group, or better, not a working group working together towards a common goal. You should check with the members if they feel they belong to a group, a heap, a set or an agegrate. Or better still, ask them how they would call themselves. In the same line, i would search for what the group expects from you. Are they making you responsible for their non-groupness? What is this subgroup projecting to you and the others? What makes them ask you to intervene in what clearly ( ;-) ) is a their problem? What is that they want from you to do to resolve this conflict? On writing this, it occurred to me that this might be a reason why you feel so resourceful. You're clearly involved in their situation, but can remain uninvolved in this situation. Perhaps their learning has to with learning how to deal with sharing workload: how did they became aware of this problem? How did they communicate between them? How did this lead to 'stuckness'?

Best

Kind regards,

Jan Lelie
