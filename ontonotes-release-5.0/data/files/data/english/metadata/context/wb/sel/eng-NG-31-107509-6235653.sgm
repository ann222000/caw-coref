Hello again, everyone :)

I have been reading the boards faithfully daily as everyone posts, and I see the numbers
some of you banty about for listenership, and my jaw drops.

I'm struggling to get *25* people to listen to my show on a daily basis.  I have no money
to pay for advertising for the show, and I've been very active in forums posting with
signatures.  This is a fun thing I enjoy doing and am doing in my free time, and I'm listed
at all the major podcast directories that I know of.

I'm waaaay open to suggestions, because six thousand listeners is a dream that sounds
staggeringly unrealistic LOL.  Is it because folks have been podcasting since the
beginning? Or is it that you are doing something else to actually grow your listenership
that I'm simply not aware of?

The Signal was my inspiration for doing a podcast, what they did was stagnormous (that's
staggering and gianormous).  Their listenership is a little more motivated than mine,
unfortunately, and I wonder if that also has something to do with it, their message is more
of a movement whereas my show is just an informational/discussion show.

I've also signed up for podcastannouncements, and post in my relevant topics on places
like IGN, GameFaqs..  So my point is if there is something I'm missing, please feel free to
point it out to me.

Just don't tell me it's that patience/time combo thingee, noone has that *big grin*.
Seriously, I'm in this for the long haul, I just want to make sure I have the right foundation
to build upon.

I *do know* about my website's size issue, I'm just trying to find the time to revamp it.

Also, I posted about this before, but I'm hosting at Podshow, but I don't actually want
people to go directly through podshow, as it bypasses my Podtrac data (which I think is
much more detailed and useful), so my podcasts button on my mainpage goes to my
forums, which has direct links (with podtrac metadata) to the shows.  Can someone
suggest a better way to do this?

I have the embedded podtrac player already present on my main page, should I look at
turning the 'podcasts' link into a popup with the embedded player instead?  I have no clue
how to do this, but I could probably figure it out if that sounds like the predominant
course of what I should be doing.

As always, everyone is so helpful here, makes me glad I came.

Thanks in advance,

The numbers thing always messes me up.  I use libsyn tied to
feedburner and there are so many numbers, I'm not really sure how I am
doing.  According to feedburner I have 262 subscribers.  According to
libsyn I have an 'active audience' of 547 and an 'average audience' of
477.  In addition, out of 7 episodes I have an 'overall distribution'
of 3811 and 'total impressions' of 3797. I have no idea if this is
good or bad or even what it all means except that the numbers have
been growing so I assume it's good.

I can tell you what I did and if these numbers are good, do the same.
If not...then don't do any of the same stuff.  I basically followed
what was in Jason Van Orden.  I was careful about choosing words in
both the title and tags that I thought would get hits.  I made sure
that all these tags were placed in iTunes and numerous other podcast
directories. (I will say that the vast majority of what I get is from
iTunes).  I put the webcast address in the signature of my emails.  I
have a blog that supports the podcast.  And I try to provide
informative show notes.  That's really all I consciously do.  I really
think the biggest thing was the careful thought about tags, words in
the title and subtitle that will get search hits.

Hope that was of at least a little help.

What does your podcast offer that you think is unique and special?  If
you were *not* the producer, what's in your show that would make you
want to listen?  Once you know the answer to that: are you
communicating it to people?

When you participate in communities related to your podcast's subject,
are you letting folks know about your podcast and what it offers?
Just having it in your signature isn't enough -- most people's eyes
are trained to ignore signatures by now.  It's better to make it part
of the conversation.  Not obnoxiously, but just say "Hey guys, this is
what I'm doing."  Even better, make it a question: "Hey guys, this is
what I'm doing, would anyone like to listen and tell me if this is
stuff you like hearing about?"  If there are movers and shakers in the
communities you participate in, ask them directly (but nicely) if
they'll listen and give feedback.  People are more inclined to
participate if they feel they're being brought in as part of the
action.

More questions: how long are your episodes?  I listen to a few daily
podcasts and many weekly ones.  The daily podcasts I listen to are
*very* short -- from one minute to about five minutes.  I just don't
have the time to consume longer content daily, no matter how
interesting it is.  I have too many other podcasts to listen to.

Is your content tight?  Do you start episodes with a couple minutes of
"Hi, here's how my day is going" or do you jump fairly into your
subject matter (gaming news, right)?  If you want to go personal, I'm
a fan of putting that stuff at the back of the podcast.  Give people
what they came for early, then you can take it casual at the end, like
an after-dinner drink.

Bumpers are fine in theory, but I'm listening to one of your episodes
as I type this, and I feel like I'm drowning in music and sound
effects.  You announced gaming news, but played three promos and at
least two or three different bumpers before you actually started
talking any news.  That's too much cacophony.  A few seconds of bumper
is more than enough -- then start talking.  Space your promos out
across the episode.  And keep your transitions and effects in
moderation!  No one ever recommended a podcast to someone else because
the bumpers were cool.

Another observation: I checked out your Web site and found it
extremely hard to make sense of.  Yeah, you've got the flashy dynamic
buttons with lights and sounds, but the fonts are tiny and blocky,
most of the space is wasted, and I can't tell if the "news" on your
front page is meant as a link to episodes or what.  When I click on
the "Podcasts" menu item, it takes me to a *forum* page (?!) with an
entirely different aesthetic, and then I have to do more clicking to
drill down to episodes.  The bare subject lines don't entice me.  Most
podcasts follow a blog model for a good reason: it's an easy way to
give people enough content on the front page to help them decide to
listen, and it puts several episodes on one page.

&gt; that I'm simply not aware of?
">

I haven't been podcasting since "the beginning" -- I came 8 to 12
months later, in May 2005.  My audience has been ramping up since
then.  It does take time, and a *lot* of work promoting your podcast
in the proper places, and content that inspires people to want to tell
others about it, and some luck.  If you're expecting very fast
success, it won't happen.

But you've been at this a couple months, right?  So you've got some
good experience at this point, and the technical aspects shouldn't be
as intimidating as they were in Week One, and you've picked a subject
where there will *always* be content.  It's a good time to start
polishing and refining, to approach your podcast as a listener would,
and to put real work into promoting.  A few hundred listeners in the
near term (say, within 3 months or so) should be an attainable goal if
you get the right message in the right place.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I *do know* about my website's size issue, I'm just trying to find the time to revamp it.
">

I'm not sure what you mean by "size issue."  I think it's structured
wrong.  And if you ask for feedback, which you did, don't be surprised
if people tell you what you already know.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; forums, which has direct links (with podtrac metadata) to the shows.  Can someone

">

Personally, I'd ditch Podshow.  Put a few bucks a month into some real
hosting (Libsyn, Dreamhost, whatever) that won't push its branding
ahead of yours.  And bring all of it into one Web site.  Install a
blog on that site, and put your episodes there.  (I personally think
Wordpress + Podpress is the best podcast platform right now in the
general case.)  If you do have forums, run them yourself, under your
own domain.

Yeah, that's not free.  But it's not expensive either.  You're already
putting a huge amount of time into this.  Is $5 to $10 a month going
to break you, if it makes for a better presentation to your audience?

Anyway, that's my take.

Feedburner's number tells you how many unique readers hit your RSS
feed in the past 24 hours.  Libsyn's number tells you how many people
are downloading your episodes (unbounded by a particular time period).

So they're measuring different things.

Bingo.  If the numbers keep going up, you're doing something right.  &gt;8-&gt;

Obsessing on numbers can drive you crazy. It can really make your show
suffer too.
I always do my show with the mindset that I have only one listener. It
makes the show more honest, in my opinion. We all want to be huge
stars but really we are just people talking into a microphone.
You can always lie and tell people that you have huge numbers. I am
sure most podcasters do that anyway.
I think David Lee Roth had a saying: It's not how big you are, it is
how people think you are.

Now back to lurking.

&gt;  general case.)  If you do have forums, run them yourself, under your
&gt;  own domain.

&gt;  Yeah, that's not free.  But it's not expensive either.  You're already

&gt;  Anyway, that's my take.

Hey Steve,

That was a fantastic PAP smear!

For that that don't get the reference (there may be a couple that
don't) one of Steve's podcasts with Michael R. Mennenga is PodHoles
( www.podholes.com ) where they critique a podcast ...at the podcasters
request I might add. They call the segment the PAP Smear (Podcasting
About Podcasting).

If you are serious about getting better at podcasting, PodHoles is
really a MUST listen. I don't always agree with what the boys have to
say, but they do a great job letting you know what they think and more
times than not, they have gems of knowledge to share.

And no...neither Steve nor Mike paid nor even asked that I plug their
show....although...I would gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger
today!

Enjoy!

I completely agree.  I don't particular worry about the numbers.  How
could I?  I didn't even really understand the numbers (until Steve
cleared it up for me).  As long as there are a couple of people
listening, it's enough to keep me interested.

I have done the particular kind of talks I am doing on the podcast
live and whether there is 1 or 40 people in the room doesn't really
make a difference.  Just talk and answer questions.

&gt; Obsessing on numbers can drive you crazy. It can really make your show

&gt; You can always lie and tell people that you have huge numbers. I am

Wow, you get 25 each day? That's not too bad.

I officially started podcasting in July with Coffee and Tea Show. On CATS I
consider it a matured download array at about 85 downloads--it will pick up
a few more down the road, but the most any episode has gotten was 185 and
that was only because I experimented with having a Pickle Player on the
MySpace, which messed up my numbers and I finally dumped it. I was really
upset about it for a while--especially because Rockypod got popular right
away--and almost faded it, but realized that of the two shows I do, that one
is actually a bit more fun because I don't follow any set pattern, anyone
who wants to come do the show with me is okay by me and I just do whatever I
like. I also don't try to follow any set schedule with it, so it's relaxing.
And because the audience has been so small, there hasn't been any
controversies or crazy things happening (Wish I could say the same for
Rockypod).

One time I heard Dave Slusher on Evil Genius Chronicles talking about the
smallest possible audience he could have and still keep the show going. Then
he heard someone say that if one listener likes your show, then it's all
worthwhile, the one listener being the podcaster him or herself (I didn't
quote this right, but you know). That helped me change my attitude and now
as long as I personally think my shows are pretty good and I still wake up
at night thinking of something fun to do on the show, I'll keep doing them.

Stay active on myspace and other places outside the podcasting

Make flyers i you have shops near your place that are targeted to

Encourage your loyal listeners to spread the word.

&gt; Hello again, everyone :)

&gt; I have been reading the boards faithfully daily as everyone posts,
&gt; and I see the numbers
&gt; some of you banty about for listenership, and my jaw drops.

&gt; I'm struggling to get *25* people to listen to my show on a daily
&gt; basis. I have no money
&gt; to pay for advertising for the show, and I've been very active in
&gt; forums posting with
&gt; signatures. This is a fun thing I enjoy doing and am doing in my
&gt; free time, and I'm listed
&gt; at all the major podcast directories that I know of.

&gt; I'm waaaay open to suggestions, because six thousand listeners is a
&gt; dream that sounds
&gt; staggeringly unrealistic LOL. Is it because folks have been
&gt; podcasting since the
&gt; beginning? Or is it that you are doing something else to actually
&gt; grow your listenership
&gt; that I'm simply not aware of?

&gt; The Signal was my inspiration for doing a podcast, what they did
&gt; was stagnormous (that's
&gt; staggering and gianormous). Their listenership is a little more
&gt; motivated than mine,
&gt; unfortunately, and I wonder if that also has something to do with
&gt; it, their message is more
&gt; of a movement whereas my show is just an informational/discussion
&gt; show.

&gt; I've also signed up for podcastannouncements, and post in my
&gt; relevant topics on places
&gt; like IGN, GameFaqs.. So my point is if there is something I'm
&gt; missing, please feel free to
&gt; point it out to me.

&gt; Just don't tell me it's that patience/time combo thingee, noone has
&gt; that *big grin*.
&gt; Seriously, I'm in this for the long haul, I just want to make sure
&gt; I have the right foundation
&gt; to build upon.

&gt; I *do know* about my website's size issue, I'm just trying to find
&gt; the time to revamp it.

&gt; Also, I posted about this before, but I'm hosting at Podshow, but I
&gt; don't actually want
&gt; people to go directly through podshow, as it bypasses my Podtrac
&gt; data (which I think is
&gt; much more detailed and useful), so my podcasts button on my
&gt; mainpage goes to my
&gt; forums, which has direct links (with podtrac metadata) to the
&gt; shows. Can someone
&gt; suggest a better way to do this?

&gt; I have the embedded podtrac player already present on my main page,
&gt; should I look at
&gt; turning the 'podcasts' link into a popup with the embedded player
&gt; instead? I have no clue
&gt; how to do this, but I could probably figure it out if that sounds
&gt; like the predominant
&gt; course of what I should be doing.

&gt; As always, everyone is so helpful here, makes me glad I came.

Hey.  I listened too.  I'm not a fan of overly produced podcasts with
running sound effects and long bumpers, so I'm agreement with Steve.
However, I think your website is just fine.  It looks a lot better
than most podcasters website's.
I think your show sounds fine, you're just not promoting it in the
right places.

&gt; &gt; signatures. This is a fun thing I enjoy doing and am doing in my
&gt; free time, and I'm listed
&gt; &gt; at all the major podcast directories that I know of.

&gt; What does your podcast offer that you think is unique and special? If
&gt; you were *not* the producer, what's in your show that would make you
&gt; want to listen? Once you know the answer to that: are you
&gt; communicating it to people?

&gt; When you participate in communities related to your podcast's subject,
&gt; are you letting folks know about your podcast and what it offers?
&gt; Just having it in your signature isn't enough -- most people's eyes
&gt; are trained to ignore signatures by now. It's better to make it part
&gt; of the conversation. Not obnoxiously, but just say &quot;Hey guys, this is
&gt; what I'm doing.&quot; Even better, make it a question: &quot;Hey guys, this is
&gt; what I'm doing, would anyone like to listen and tell me if this is
&gt; stuff you like hearing about?&quot; If there are movers and shakers in the
&gt; communities you participate in, ask them directly (but nicely) if
&gt; they'll listen and give feedback. People are more inclined to
&gt; participate if they feel they're being brought in as part of the
&gt; action.

&gt; More questions: how long are your episodes? I listen to a few daily
&gt; podcasts and many weekly ones. The daily podcasts I listen to are
&gt; *very* short -- from one minute to about five minutes. I just don't
&gt; have the time to consume longer content daily, no matter how
&gt; interesting it is. I have too many other podcasts to listen to.

&gt; Is your content tight? Do you start episodes with a couple minutes of
&gt; &quot;Hi, here's how my day is going&quot; or do you jump fairly into your
&gt; subject matter (gaming news, right)? If you want to go personal, I'm
&gt; a fan of putting that stuff at the back of the podcast. Give people
&gt; what they came for early, then you can take it casual at the end, like
&gt; an after-dinner drink.

&gt; Bumpers are fine in theory, but I'm listening to one of your episodes
&gt; as I type this, and I feel like I'm drowning in music and sound
&gt; effects. You announced gaming news, but played three promos and at
&gt; least two or three different bumpers before you actually started
&gt; talking any news. That's too much cacophony. A few seconds of bumper
&gt; is more than enough -- then start talking. Space your promos out
&gt; across the episode. And keep your transitions and effects in
&gt; moderation! No one ever recommended a podcast to someone else because
&gt; the bumpers were cool.

&gt; Another observation: I checked out your Web site and found it
&gt; extremely hard to make sense of. Yeah, you've got the flashy dynamic
&gt; buttons with lights and sounds, but the fonts are tiny and blocky,
&gt; most of the space is wasted, and I can't tell if the &quot;news&quot; on your
&gt; front page is meant as a link to episodes or what. When I click on
&gt; the &quot;Podcasts&quot; menu item, it takes me to a *forum* page (?!) with an
&gt; entirely different aesthetic, and then I have to do more clicking to
&gt; drill down to episodes. The bare subject lines don't entice me. Most
&gt; podcasts follow a blog model for a good reason: it's an easy way to
&gt; give people enough content on the front page to help them decide to
&gt; listen, and it puts several episodes on one page.

&gt; &gt; I'm waaaay open to suggestions, because six thousand listeners is
&gt; a dream that sounds
&gt; &gt; staggeringly unrealistic LOL. Is it because folks have been
&gt; podcasting since the
&gt; &gt; beginning? Or is it that you are doing something else to actually
&gt; grow your listenership
&gt; &gt; that I'm simply not aware of?

&gt; I haven't been podcasting since &quot;the beginning&quot; -- I came 8 to 12
&gt; months later, in May 2005. My audience has been ramping up since
&gt; then. It does take time, and a *lot* of work promoting your podcast
&gt; in the proper places, and content that inspires people to want to tell
&gt; others about it, and some luck. If you're expecting very fast
&gt; success, it won't happen.

&gt; But you've been at this a couple months, right? So you've got some
&gt; good experience at this point, and the technical aspects shouldn't be
&gt; as intimidating as they were in Week One, and you've picked a subject
&gt; where there will *always* be content. It's a good time to start
&gt; polishing and refining, to approach your podcast as a listener would,
&gt; and to put real work into promoting. A few hundred listeners in the
&gt; near term (say, within 3 months or so) should be an attainable goal if
&gt; you get the right message in the right place.

&gt; &gt; I *do know* about my website's size issue, I'm just trying to
&gt; find the time to revamp it.

&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;size issue.&quot; I think it's structured
&gt; wrong. And if you ask for feedback, which you did, don't be surprised
&gt; if people tell you what you already know.

&gt; &gt; Also, I posted about this before, but I'm hosting at Podshow, but
&gt; I don't actually want
&gt; &gt; people to go directly through podshow, as it bypasses my Podtrac
&gt; data (which I think is
&gt; &gt; much more detailed and useful), so my podcasts button on my
&gt; mainpage goes to my
&gt; &gt; forums, which has direct links (with podtrac metadata) to the
&gt; shows. Can someone
&gt; &gt; suggest a better way to do this?

&gt; Personally, I'd ditch Podshow. Put a few bucks a month into some real
&gt; hosting (Libsyn, Dreamhost, whatever) that won't push its branding
&gt; ahead of yours. And bring all of it into one Web site. Install a
&gt; blog on that site, and put your episodes there. (I personally think
&gt; Wordpress + Podpress is the best podcast platform right now in the
&gt; general case.) If you do have forums, run them yourself, under your
&gt; own domain.

&gt; Yeah, that's not free. But it's not expensive either. You're already
&gt; putting a huge amount of time into this. Is $5 to $10 a month going
&gt; to break you, if it makes for a better presentation to your audience?

&gt; Anyway, that's my take.

Hi Laura,

That's exactly my stance too...I do my shows simply for a creative
outlet and I do material that I think is funny....I'm lucky that there
are about 100 other people that think the same and as cool as it is to
get e-mail, comments and contributions to the show, I would keep on
doing it even without the listeners feedback.

One thing that I learned early on, is that most of the people
listening to podcasts right now are podcasters and that when you make
a contribution to another podcaster, they give you a free plug.  So
being active on other podcasts you listen to can also help to raise
awareness of your show. Also, it's a great way to develop your circle
of friends.

Comment on people's blogs that you read...you do read blogs don't you?
I've commented on a couple of other blogs that I have seen in
newspaper articles etc. and have gained them as listeners.

And as has been previously stated, if you're producing good stuff that
people want to listen to, they will find you. I think more than
anything (and I know no one likes the p-word) patience is the key.

The overall number of podcast listeners is really a small number in
comparison to other forms of media that is our competition.

Despite some of their contractual issues, PodShow is really helping to
get podcasting out into the eyes and ears of the general public.
Others like Blubrry and the Podcast Pickle are also doing their part
to bring our voices to everyone's ears.

Fretting over the numbers is really not a good use of your time.
Producing the best possible content in a clear and entertaining manner
is really a better use of your time.

Just my 2 cents.

How are they doing this?

What marketing campaigns have PodShow, Blubrry, or Podcast Pickle
initiated to inform the general public about podcasting?  Where are
they advertising?  I know that at least two of those companies have
bought big edifices in Second Life, but in *this* life, where are they
spending money to bring more people in as listeners?

I'm serious -- this is not a rhetorical question, and I'm *truly* not
just asking it to be a smartass or to rag on anyone.  I'm actually
hoping for a positive answer.  I'm not really up on a lot of popular
culture, so if it's happening somewhere and I haven't noticed, I'd
like to know about it.

Hmm.  This is one that I've been working with.  They are usually 30 minutes, or around
there.  I have been trying to shorten it, and when I am solo due to cohosting conflicts, they
are MUCH shorter, but the show loses the aspect you asked about, which is our knowledge
base on the subject and communicating those things via discussion back and forth.

Do you think this concept would better be served as a longer (maybe 1 hour show) weekly
instead of daily?  We're already generally hand-picking what we feel are the 'more
important' stories to trim down to 30 minutes.

Noted.  I will change the format accordingly; I think that's a great suggestion.
The format is something I had been playing with to reduce time, I have more to say on that
after I answer the next one :)

Ok, several questions and explanations in response.  1) I have 2 'commercial breaks' in the
show.  Originally we had a daily discussion topic, but I had to kill it just to fit the news in
to keep us *close* to 30 mins.  So that's why I had it laid out in that fashion; If you might
suggest a better format for breaking it up?  Also, I'm guessing you were listening to a
current show from this week, where my co-host has been out sick all week.  It does
change the dynamic of the show, because usually we discuss or comment on every story,
so 2) I can see how you might feel you were drowning in bumps/sound effects.  I wish I
could say I was original, but I patterned our news off the Signal, which has a bump
between every story.  I do the same and try to limit the sound effects otherwise, unless it
comes up in our actual conversation (like one of us quoting southpark, for example).

My conflict comes from 3) That's one of the things that I believe does set the podcast
apart.  We're a videogame show aimed at videogamers.  Who generally have shorter
attention spans.  I try to produce the show in a way that keeps it entertaining and
hopefully emotionally links the listener through the use of the bumps.  I know it sounds
touchy feely, but if gamerA had spent two years of his life playing mario brothers, and
we're talking about a nintendo story and I precede the story with a mario brothers sound,
gamerA is going to be emotionally connected there.  At least, that's how it works for me...
I talk about this stuff because I truly love it, and sounds and bumps that draw me into the
games; well I want them to draw listeners into the show as well.  Man, I hope I'm relaying
this in a way that makes sense.

I'm SO not arguing; I'm just trying to find a way to mesh what I want to do with what will
bring listeners in; and I'm trying to let you all into my head so that you know where my
thought processes are.

So, I can understand you felt you were drowning in the bumps/sound effects if it was just
me talking; but if you are willing, listen to episode 18, for example.  That's a fairly
standard show, and please let me know if you still feel like it is too much.

4) Lastly, my promos are currently  Intro/personal | promos | News | promos | News and
mashup.   Do you think News1 | promos |news 2| promos | personal and mashup is more
along the lines of what you were thinking?  That's what I have in my head now :)

I understand, I was just trying to point out I know the website needs a complete overhaul.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Personally, I'd ditch Podshow.  Put a few bucks a month into some real
&gt; hosting (Libsyn, Dreamhost, whatever) that won't push its branding
&gt; ahead of yours.  And bring all of it into one Web site.  Install a
&gt; blog on that site, and put your episodes there.  (I personally think
&gt; Wordpress + Podpress is the best podcast platform right now in the
&gt; general case.)  If you do have forums, run them yourself, under your
&gt; own domain.
">

Therein lies the rub.  I own my own domain, and I can probably/maybe/hopefully install
forums.  But I know Wordpress+Podpress is not an option there.  So I need to either invest
waaaay more, which is not even remotely possible at this point, or host everything offsite.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Yeah, that's not free.  But it's not expensive either.  You're already
&gt; putting a huge amount of time into this.  Is $5 to $10 a month going
&gt; to break you, if it makes for a better presentation to your audience?
">

Actually. *sigh* Yes.  I have virtually no money I can invest in it, and my time is stretched
pretty thin.  I live in a poor rural area, and I don't make much money.  Every spare scrap I
have, goes to content to fuel the show.

And that's also why I chose podshow and then try to do everything in my power not to
have folks go there; it's free.  I know it sounds crass, but I'm not a professional, I'm just
doing this because it's what I love and I feel there is a real hole that can be plugged by me;
but all I have to contribute is time.

Again, I'm not fighting/arguing; I'm just trying to reconsile how to do this with what I
*can* do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Anyway, that's my take.

I *really* appreciate the feedback, Sir.  Thank you for taking the time to attempt to help.
Hopefully I will have an update with a new webpage in whatever form I can figure out.
Does libsyn charge for wordpress and podpress hosting as well?  And I *really* don't want
to do it, but can they run with your hosted domain?  I suppose I can just remap my server
address to redirect to the libsyn page...

Thanks again!

Hmm both you and Steve mentioned this, I know this is probably a can of worms, but what
is 'too long'?  Generally most of my bumps are around maybe 2-3 secs; it's usually the
system startup sound of whatever platform we're going to be talking about in the next
news piece (IE if we were going to talk about Windows, you'd hear the Windows startup
sound before the news piece).  Occasionally it's slightly longer, but usually not much.

Thanks again for your feedback, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

&gt; Hi Laura,

&gt; That's exactly my stance too...I do my shows simply for a creative

Thank you Laura and Andy.  That *is* why I do the show, I just feel the need to have to get
it to more people.  My end goal is to create this community of folks who can jump online
and play together, and not have to be strangers.  They have the shared experience of the
podcast, and participating in the forum boards.  I know it sounds all touchy feely, but I'm
32 and I'm discouraged by the 14 year old vidiots online who sour the experience of
playing online for everyone.  But there are bad 32 year olds, too.  I guess I am just wanting
to build a 'huge community of friends' and that's why I want to expand past my 25
listeners.  So I'm trying to temper my vision with what's proven to work, hence my asking
for *everyone's* input.

Thank you both for taking the time to respond!

And you're asking them to listen to 30 minutes a day?

Remember: you have total control over your podcast.  You don't have to
pattern yourself off The Signal or anyone else.  Starting with a
template is not a bad idea, but you've been doing this long enough
that you shouldn't feel squeamish about departing from it.

(By the way, I should probably observe here that I stopped listening
to The Signal after a couple months because it was too long for me.
It wasn't boring, but I only have so much time to listen to podcasts,
and they were taking too much of it.  That's just my own taste and
opinion, so take it with a shaker or two of salt.)

Why isn't Wordpress an option?

If your hosting doesn't give you options you want, change hosts.
There are plenty that offer flexible features and lots of bandwidth
for just a few dollars a month.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No.  Libsyn offers their own homebuilt, very basic blogging functions.
That's why a lot of people only host their MP3 files at Libsyn and
have their main Web sites somewhere else.  (I personally don't use
Libsyn at all, BTW -- I serve my own MP3 files from my own Web host.)

As for the rest of your questions: sorry.  I can't take the time to do
multiple rounds of this; I still have to get my own podcast up today.
I've given my feedback.  You can do what you like with it.  Anyway,
it's not my opinion that you should be worried about, but that of your
audience.  Ask *them* what they think of the show, and what could be
done to improve the show -- and if you're lucky, a few will answer.

I dont have a good answer for how long is too long.  For me it's like
what sounds most disruptive to the overall listening experience.

Hi,

One of my podcasts is actually about SL, I do have some of my land play the
mp3 (direct path to where libsyn is carrying it). It goes under your Media
tab of your land.

There are also people who make MP3 players for SL, (allows you to give it a
list of MP3s to play one after another). Currently no one has gotten SL to
read RSS feed itself.

The way I do it, just having it on one land, each person who listens gets
their own stream, instead of a shared stream. MP3 players for SL would have
everyone at the same spot (though this does make it more complicated to
know for sure how many people are actually listening to your podcasts, as
it will always count as a web download).

Chris

We have RSS devices for Second Life. We give them away is several forms. The
three most popular are:

1. a podcast billboard that will check your feed and start playing the
latest episode (audio or video) for the visitor when they touch it, and
gives them a cube to click to subscribe in Podcast Ready. The billboard then
resets itself when no one is around and waits for the next visitor. (not yet
in the directory but IM me for a copy)

2. what we call a Proximity Player. Its a cube that detects the presence of
a visitor and reads the feed and starts playing automatically. This player
has no video screen, so if its a video podcast you have to have your own.
Once they leave, it resets. It too allows visitors to subscribe by simply
touching it. (available in the directory)

3. a media control panel for your land that lets someone else provide the
feed address or URL of file (in chat) and it then sets the land to play the
latest episode or the file. (available in the directory)

Of course, in order to subscribe in Podcast Ready the user has to have an
account and completed the Second Life part of their profile - and in order
for these devices to play the podcast they have to be owned by the same
person or group that owns the land. If you don't own land we'd be happy to
put a billboard on our space around the directory.

All free for the taking... check out the podcast directory holodeck at *
http://tinyurl.com/2fyyd8 *and click on the 'media tools' sign.* *(Placement
in the holodeck directory it free too... see location).

Koz knows - uses shout cast I think to stream.  HippieGeek has built a
player that works.

You can always tag a file to land you own.   I have a player on my land that
links to a few files that passers by can play.

HippieGeeks player does not require you own the land but all other options
that I am aware of do.

Hope that helps a little.

Most people I talk with are clueless about podcasting and I don't see Podshow or others helping to educate the public about it.  My experience, based on my listening to a seminar from PPME last fall and, more importantly, my own show, is that people listen on their computer by clicking a listen button and that this is nothing more than delivering audio/video via the net in the traditional sense.  People don't get feeds, they don't get podcatchers and they don't get subscribing.  I have not found anyone that seemingly is able to meet Joe and Jane sixpack where they are in terms of computer knowledge and awareness.  I don't even call my show a podcast now because more than a few people said they didn't think they could listen because they didn't have an iPod.
