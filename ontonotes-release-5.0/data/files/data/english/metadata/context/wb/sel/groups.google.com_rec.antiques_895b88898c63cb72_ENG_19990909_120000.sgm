Hi all

My son has been helping me on the computer and at work this last
week.

He put up this website (and this message) for me:

http://web.ukonline.co.uk/members/jon.d2/Whytham.htm

I bought all the buys shown for less than $150. I'll give more detail
when I can write for myself!

Jon (and Christopher)

PS I have a big review at the eye hospital tomorrow (Friday 10/9) I'll
let you know what's up after that!

When you are feeling better, would it be possible to get a closer picture
or two of the cakestand shown in w_haul2.jpg? It really looks beautiful
in the picture.

I like the coal bin a lot!
Good luck tomorrow.

Jon,

I liked the little chest I thought that was the
item with the most character.

Ditto on the coal bin, but some day I'd like to see that red bike that
has the apple in it! &lt;grin&gt;

Get better soon! Michele

Great stuff, Jon! I'll have to take some flea market pictures when I sell
in October. You folks really do sell out of the car boot. I thought that
was just an expression.

OT: We're thinking of working the IOW into our December itinerary...any
progress on that flat? I hear there are places you can watch the great
ships pass by. And I just found out today (you probably knew this)
Jeremy Irons is a IOW native like you.

Now that I think of it, there's a resemblance...

"/> HA! Luv it. Okey doke Jon, thanks for taking me shopping with you.
What fun! And you were making fun of my Brimfield? Hee, hee. Your car
boots look about the same. Maybe a little less commercial.
From memory: My favorite are the two advertising signs. I'm partial to
advertising stuff. Are you planning to strip the &quot;walnut&quot; side table/cupboard
or just sell it as cottage furniture (heh, heh). How old do you think the
copper coal bin is? Looks a bit spiffy to be as early as the 30's but then
again...they POLISH everything in Europe, so who knows.
Lets see, what else was there. Oh yes, what does &quot;also rans&quot; mean.
Thank you.
I hope your eyes are getting better. Tell Christopher hello, job well
done, make Dad pay you for honest work.
See ya!
Fayette

I think it will keep the Aga going during the winter, well for an hour at
