Have you read the Tao Te Ching?  It's been translated many times, and
some translations are online.  You can find the Feng/English
translation here: http://www.terebess.hu/english/tao/gia.html It
doesn't take long to read it, understanding it takes longer.

Tao is difficult or impossible to define.  I view it as the universal
operating principle of all realities.  Living in harmony with Tao
could be called Taoism, I suppose.  Taoists believe whatever they
believe, but if you try to live in harmony with Tao you could probably
get away with calling yourself a Taoist if you wanted a label.

I think that if you keep your eyes and ears open, and throw away
beliefs that prove themselves not to work, you will end up in harmony
with Tao whether you ever heard the word or not.  The Tao Te Ching
(TTC) contains a bunch of hints about what you may end up with.

Here's one from wikipedia

&quot;Taoism (Daoism) is the English name referring to
a variety of related Chinese philosophical and
religious traditions and concepts.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Here's a link to the wiki site.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism

There's a section about beliefs.

If that's too complicated,
and if you can begin to say why or how
then maybe folks here can explain more.

This quest keeps returning to me.

Very simply, taoism is a word. Duh.
An, &quot;ism&quot; could be a bunch of stuff.
Tao-ism is a bunch of stuff about Tao.

Sometimes there are words about words.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;and what taoist believe.

Here's something that may apply.

&quot;What do I mean by a True Man? The True Man of
ancient times did not rebel against want, did not
grow proud in plenty, and did not plan his
affairs. A man like this could commit an error and
not regret it, could meet with success and not
make a show. A man like this could climb the high
places and not be frightened, could enter the
water and not get wet, could enter the fire and
not get burned. His knowledge was able to climb
all the way up to the Way like this.&quot;

Taoism can be mystical.
Or it can be practical, as with Cook Ting.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Maybe a easy web site.
">

The Chuang-tzu,
in which the above tale appears,
http://www.terebess.hu/english/chuangtzu.html#6
might not be very easy, but it could be said
that easy does it. Muddy water can become clear
by allowing things to settle down.

There are lots of tails to wag in the book.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Taoism may pertain to most anything.
As a path, a journey, it could  be said that
a thousand steps begin with one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I still think it's a great quest'ion
and am greatful for the thought to ponder.

Dear Cougar,

In my opinion, taoism is the acceptance of life or death in the face
of other religions which seem fascist by comparison, because they
would prefer someone to address them as an exteriorism of life.
Typically taoists snuff people who want martial arts, meditation, chi
gung, or any other sort of advancement into the wa of old american
vampiric traditions. They then wonder facetiously if they will ever
recover. This is seen as a sort of balance in a baby country which
never grows up.

You're back.

It's been dull while you were gone (much as it was before you left).
Craig dropped in for a while.  shazi graced us with a few brief
comments.  I think Jim Fish put in an appearance while you were absent
but am unsure of the timing.  Jay is desperate for anyone to argue
with.  I've plonked a few more wankers.  In brief you ain't missed a
thing.

yes, but zhuangzi is 30 times the number of words,
so 81x30 would be 2430 chapters,

If you can't say it in a single sentence (and you can't) you come to a
fork in the road with one side leading to no words read by posterity
because you shrugged your shoulders and walked away, and the other
side leading to more words than meat unless you are a really good
rambler.

If someone was the true man, fulltime shengren, the mythical sage,

all the time... could his companions fail to learn the way?

Forget the gurus crap wr, they're just in it for the cash and the

No, I was completely serious, but maybe talking off to your left
someplace.  What I was saying has nothing to do with gurus.

Suppose there's some guy (not a guru, just a guy) who remains in
harmony with Tao all the time.  Everything he does is in harmony with
Tao.  His ego-self is basically gone, all that's left is this shengren
dude.

The point was, if you hung around the guy, and watched what he did and
what happened in the world, kept your eyes and ears open, wouldn't you
have to eventually get it?

It seems like you would, but maybe not, maybe your own ego-garbage
would stay in the way, make you blink at the wrong times, look at the
redheaded chick when you should be watching the watch.

Dunno, whaddya think?  If you were Cook Ting's apprentice for example,
would you learn how to keep your knife sharp?  Or would you have as
much chance of learning harmony with Tao if you hung around with some
lowlife pimp or something instead?

The more I think about the question, the more I think that it doesn't
matter, Tao is just there, you're either going to &quot;get it&quot; or not.

I think gurus buy into their own experiences as being something
extraordinary/supernatural, though, and therefore, though I doubt
their experience is in anyway more extraordinary/supernatural then
anyone else's, I think some are sincere; however, like anything else,
money, power, and adulation can be  strong motivations.

I think Taoist Te pretty much is Taoist Te; so when I think in these
terms I think of them in Taoist philosophical terms.   I think a
pimp's ego would be inline with a pimp's ego, whatever the case may
be.   And if a pimp became a Taoist then, philosophically, he could
manage to understand Taoist Te.

yes, they could fail to 'learn the way'

it can only benefit.

i have never seen a case

wei wuwei: 'act without acting'

one may observe, true,

'by this', or 'by what is inside',
then it is wei past wuwei.

i may not agree with your words,
but i can observe that
--being true to yourself--
you are not 'acting'.

but your way is not my wei
and that's okay.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Prolly why the TTC doesn't have 687 chapters, huh?

&gt;&gt;&gt;yes, but zhuangzi is 30 times the number of words,
&gt;&gt;&gt;so 81x30 would be 2430 chapters,
&gt;&gt;&gt;and the wenzi, which i've been translating lately
&gt;&gt;&gt;is much larger than ddj.

&gt;&gt;&gt;some of these guys were really wordy.

&gt;&gt;If you can't say it in a single sentence (and you can't) you come to a
&gt;&gt;fork in the road with one side leading to no words read by posterity
&gt;&gt;because you shrugged your shoulders and walked away, and the other
&gt;&gt;side leading to more words than meat unless you are a really good
&gt;&gt;rambler.

&gt;&gt;If someone was the true man, fulltime shengren, the mythical sage,
&gt;&gt;whatever you wish to call him, the guy who remains in harmony with Tao
&gt;&gt;all the time... could his companions fail to learn the way?

&gt;yes, they could fail to 'learn the way'

&gt;according to wenzi,
&gt;dao cannot be transferred,
&gt;it can only benefit.

&gt;of course your statement is theoretical.
&gt;is there such a thing as a fulltime shengren?
&gt;does anyone remain in harmony all the time?
">

I dunno.  I suspect so, but they probably would be hidden from the
common view.  For damned sure I don't, my wife calls me &quot;Donald Duck&quot;
when I'm flapping my arms and yelling... usually when I'm overtired,
but it's what it is.

From my experience, staying in harmony is pretty intense and tends to
be physically draining, at least as far as I've progressed; it seems
likely that once the house is swept the floor is likely to stay clean,
but I still have crap laying around all over the place and have to be
careful where I step.

I remember times when I was in the presence of one who was in harmony,
and I recall thinking &quot;wow, there's something extra going on here&quot;.
Wondering what that might have been seems to have pointed me in a
direction.  It leads me to wonder about that &quot;dao cannot be
transferred&quot; statement; maybe it can't be transferred directly, but
observation teaches.

true enough.

observation stimulates,
but until the lesson is internalized,
listening, as it were, with the entire spirit,
then the lesson isn't really there, is it?

and if one can observe,
really with the internal spirit,
then the master is everywhere,
the student is ready,
and the master appears.

confucius said that walking with two others,
they could both be his teacher.
from the sage, what to do,
from the idiot, perhaps, what not to do.

heavily paraphrased, of course.

to be declared a guru is adulation by others; and, imo, will in no way
affect such person, (praise or blame) unless they believe in their own
guruness unto others.  it is said we all carry such within...our own
