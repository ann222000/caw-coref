hi i am kind of a newbie, i recently installed a Pioneer DEH-P4800MP,
and Rockford punch P162S in the front and "power 6x9 2-Way Full-Range
Speakers" in the rear. i love the rear but the front 6.5s aren't
giving any bass. they where really expensive and they just don't sound
good, the highs are Cristal clear, i was wondering if i had to amp
them or get the baffles or what. i am looking at the fosgate punch
P450.4.

If you don't have your speakers baffled by isolating the front from
the back, that might be your biggest problem.  Doesn't matter how much
power you give it, the bass waves will cancel out.  Some 6.5's have
higher sensitivity for highs/midrange and lower sensitivity for lows.
If you're running your 6.5's off your head unit, then don't expect too
much from the low end of the spectrum.  6x9's are a bigger speaker,
therefore generally it doesn't require as much wattage for bass
notes.  A general rule of thumb is, the bigger the woofer cone the
more bass it pumps out at a certain wattage.  In order to get a decent
amount of bass from your 6.5's, you need have the speaker baffled, and
you need sufficient power from an amp.  And don't forget you need good
connections and good wires.  Some loud speakers need to be run at a
certain high wattage in order to produce a decent sound.

ok cool so i should get those foam baffles and then try an amp?

there are many ways to baffle your speakers... just do whatever seems
suitable to you.. If it were me, I would go to crutchfield, ebay, or
some audio shop and just buy a set of baffles for the 6.5's.  The main
point is you want isolate the back from the front of the speaker.
Also, if you don't have your speaker baffled there is no air
resistance behind the speaker when the woofer cone moves it puts too
much stress on the coil and you can damage your speaker coil when
playing at high wattages.  I always like to have a clean setup before
I install any high-power amp.

Correction... You want air resistance behind the speaker but not too
much air resistance.  If you get too much air resistance the woofer
cone won't move at all.  A baffle is good for bass response if you
know what you are doing.  I suggest if you use a baffle, you cut a 3
inch diameter hole in the back of the baffle.  I'm don't really know a
lot about baffles, but I do know you need to isolate the front from
the back of the speaker.  There is probably a thread about this
somewhere else in this group.  Hold on...

Just out of curiosity what kind of car are you instslling these in.I
actually have the same speakers up front in my truck and am not
running baffels or an amp and they sound amazing and i even have the
bass on my HU turned down to zero. Well good luck with your system!

Ugh... I can't believe nobody's stepped in here yet with some REAL advice.

Okay... first, those foam "baffles" are NOT going to help your bass.  NOT.  Bass
frequencies will travel right through them and you're right back where you started.

Second, they're NOT going to affect the air mass that the driver "sees" because
they'll flex right along with the sound waves.

Third, the types of drivers you're dealing with, since they're almost always
mounted in what amounts to an "infinite baffle" setting (like a door or a car's
rear deck), are DESIGNED to work best without an small enclosure behind them.

Yes, you do need a baffle to improve bass response.  A "baffle" in this case is
any continuous mounting surface that separates the front of the speaker from the
back.  Whether it's a box enclosing the back of the driver, or a sheet of
plywood, it performs the same function: blocking the backwave of the cone from
cancelling out the front wave.

If the speakers are in the doors, you need to make sure there are no holes or
gaps between the area behind the speaker and the area in front of it.  There
should be no gaps between the surround frame and whatever it's mounted to.  Most
door panels are cheap plastic or cardboard and can also flex with the bass, thus
cancelling the bass frequencies, especially with all the holes that normally
exist in the metal so covering the door under the panel with a sound deadener
(like Dynamat) can help as well.

Many years ago, I had a 1980 Mazda GLC, in which the door panels were literally
just a flat sheet of cardboard with a vinyl cover.  I used them as templates to
cut new panels out of 1/4" MDF (medium-density fiberboard) and mounted the 6.5"
Alpine speakers in those, and got some very good (for 6.5") bass out of them.

So yes, the baffles are the critical piece of your puzzle, but you need to
understand what a baffle really is, and how it affects the sound.

Ultimately though, your standard 6.5" speaker simply doesn't move a lot of air,
especially not one with a tweeter or two stuck in the middle (because that
design limits how far the cone can move, not because the tweeter "blocks" the
sound), and you're just not going to get a lot of bass out of them.

6x9s are not a lot better in that regard - the ONLY way to get proper bass is
with a subwoofer.

depends on your speakers... there are actually some 4-ways that have
better bass than a 2-way or component system.  My 6x9 4-ways have a
longer pole for the midrange and tweeter sections than most 6x9 4-ways
so it leaves more room for the woofer cone.  I can put 100 Watts in my
6x9's and it the bass is actually louder than most subwoofers at 100
Watts.  Why?  I don't know for sure, but maybe it is because that
subwoofers require more wattage to get higher volumes (less
sensitivity).  Although the bass quality from my 6x9's are not better
than a subwoofer's quality, it still produces decent bass for a 6x9.

A lot depends on the mounting.  The old (early-80s) Firebirds and Trans-Ams used
to get an astounding amount of bass out of rear-deck-mounted 6x9s, even without
much power, because the shape of the back window effectively horn-loaded the
drivers, helping to enhance and direct the bass.  Even my Accord hatchback gets
way more bass with its single 10" sub sitting in a back corner of the hatch than
it does with the sub placed right behind the driver's seat.

Fact is, a 6x9 typically has less surface area than an 8" sub, and even with
longer tweeter mounts, generally less excursion than a dedicated sub is capable
of, due in part to the limitations of the oval design (which wreaks havok on the
sound anyway).  It's a hack driver design that should have been abandoned years
ago, let alone ever existed in the first place.

Here's is what I just did for my 6.5 speakers...

1. Get a couple cardboard boxes
2. Get a lot of duct tape and scissors
3. Take off the door panel
4. Tape cardboard to the whole door.  Make sure no holes are between
the front of the speaker and the back of the speaker.

Cardboard helps absorb the bass waves that come from behind and it
also eliminates the rattling of the metal if you do it right.  Plus,
you get better insulation.  No dynamat needed.  Cardboard does the
same thing as dynamat, just a lot cheaper.

I got bass out of my 6.5" speakers that I would of thought of getting
from the head unit amplifier.   Trust me, it works!  I just did it.

A couple things to remember are you want to isolate all the little
cracks around the speaker even if you can't do it with cardboard.  Use
a little foam or just several layers of tape would even help.  And you
want to get the high quality duct tape which is like 7 dollars at
Walmart.

Cardboard is not going to absorb any significant bass waves. What it
*will* do is absorb the mid to high frequencies and dampen any
spurrious resonances and vibrations.

Insulation against what? Electrical shock? Temperature changes?

I would hardly put a cardboard box and a roll of heavy, self-adhesive
damping material in the same category. Among other things, Dynamat and
the like will not turn to mush if it gets wet.

I'm still having a hard time even believing that I've responded to
this post,
let alone believing that someone is actually advocating supplementing
his door
paenls with *cardboard*.

Amazing.

A *much* better alternative would be to use 1/4" (or even 1/8" if you
can't fit the 1/4" behind the door) *hardboard* (or "medite"). A
really good solution for sealing your door's interior is to take
pieces of hardboard and cut them to fit in the holes in your door's
metal, and use very small screws and silicone caulk to fasten these
panels to the sheet metal (be sure to use some latex paint or other
waterproofing on the "inside side" of the panels), and then cover the
panels and sheet metal with dynamat. For those holes that won't fit a
flat piece of anything, you'd pretty much have to resort to making
these plugs out of a couple layers of fiberglass--which is much more
involved and hazardous to your health.

And if you want to do it *right*, you can use spray undercoating on
the interior of the door to dampen the external sheet metal. Once you
do this, you can get a pretty decently-sealed, "dead" doors...but
they'll still be leaky around where the window slot at the top (unless
you use silicone caulk and seal your windows shut. :-).

well you are probably right, but i don't think the cardboard is going
to get that wet since it is pretty much isolated from the outside.
Maybe I will try it your way in the future, but for now I've noticed a
huge difference with cardboard.  Whatever works is fine for me.  Why
spend a ton of money with proper equipment, when you can do it the
cheap way and it still works.  Right now, I can't even afford to buy
dynomat let alone everything else you just mentioned.  I'm going full-
time to college with a part-time job to pay for the bills.  Maybe you
wouldn't put cardboard in your door, but I don't really give a crap
what I put in my car.  It's a hunk of crap.  96 rusted out cavalier.
Plus the door panel would cover the cardboard mess and it would just
look like as it did before.  As I said, whatever works and is cheap...

Yes, good point. Of course, one of the main design factors for a coax/triax
speaker is also that it fit behind what's usually a fairly low-profile grille.
That generally means your tweeter or mid/tweeter assembly can't stick out too
far, and that naturally limits the Xmax as well.  There are actually some 6.5"
woofers that produce relatively good bass; I even used to have a pair of 5.25"
Kicker woofers that were quite effective for their size... but these aren't
multi-way drivers and thus aren't limited by the presence of the tweeter supports.
