Granted that as a student of Bonhoeffer (in an actual but non historical
sense) I identify Christ with reality and evaluate all theologies with that
prism -

so all the fancy word castles no matter how ornately built can still
collapse for me on the issue of reality -

and Phil Hefner was my theology teacher at LSTC who expressed another
determinant that I had prior felt as a Bonhoeffer-ian, that any theology
that cannot account for evil is a theology that fails - and I apply the
reality critique to attempts to account for evil -

I spent the best part of my weekend with Robert Donia - I attach two links,
you can google him to find out more on who he is -

http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;search-type;=ss&amp;index;=books&amp;field-auth...;
http://www.arhivsa.ba/ica2004/robert.htm

but who he is is that Bob Donia is a scholar of Eastern Europe, has done
special work in Kosovo and Bosnia, and as such has testified in twelve
crimes against humanity trials held in the Hague.  For example:
http://www.umich.edu/~iinet/journal/vol11no2-3/donia.htm
http://hague.bard.edu/icty_info.html
http://www.un.org/icty/milosevic/trialc/decision-e/050531.htm

You can google Robert Donia with names as Milosevic and gets tons of
results.  Bob had the pleasure of being attacked by Milosevic (verbally) for
several hours as Milosevic attempted to discount Donia's expert witness
testimony from the Serbian archives during Milsovec's trial.

Donia is currently working on a biography of Radovan Karadzic - genocidist
currently in hiding in Serbia or Montenegro.  Bob has access to thousands of
archival dicuments kept by the Bosnian Serbs as they planned the ethic
cleansing and genocide of the Bosniacs (Islamic Bosnians), much of it
Karadzic talking about his own life.

What does this have to do with anything -

it has to do with all this talk of supersessionism  that posits one's own
faith as better than someone else's, why? because of course God said so.

And when some want to argue this supersessionism based on their translation
of a word here or there in Scriptures, I evaluate based on reality while
looking at (or at least attempt to look at) the whole of Scriptures.  And I
have argued here that believing that Christianity is better than Judaism is
a step towards Holocaust - and thus to be rejected.  I have been chided for
that, told that I was &quot;assuming&quot; rather than having the right to have drawn
my own conclusion - I guess Goldhagen and I are assumptionists -because we
differ from some hold as the only truth -

anyway Bob Donia and I were discussing the attempted genocide of the
Bosniacs (Bosnian Muslims) by the Christian Serbs -

Bob has done a lot of work in Srebrenica -
http://www.pbs.org/wnet/cryfromthegrave/ for those who forget -

and made a comment that a belief in religious superiorty - supersessionsim -
being the first small step in the short journey from faith/religion to
genocide.

Bob is currently working on a dissertation on that very subject.

But when he made that comment, it was an electric moment for me.  It was a
ratification of what I believe, so I liked it, but to get an unsolicited
ratification from someone closely involved in genocide, who has been
intimately involved as he has been, that is something that I needed to hear,
because it is a grounding in reality.

I have been disdained and that will continue by those who think that I am
not one of the club, someone who dissents from the orthodoxy of this place,
which does exist - I think the head trips on how Christianity is superior to
Judaism because Jesus tells me so is wrong Scripturally and wrong based on
reality.

I especially enjoy when I get falsely complimented on pointing out nuance
when something is misquoted - how dare one challenge the pope - and when I
get rebuked for stating something that is contrary to the only acceptable
views here.

But a weekend with Bob Donia revives me.  I certainly do not have all truth,
but God has given me insight into something that needs to be lifted up - I
am a devout Christian, I know God in Christ, and I get in trouble with those
who think to speak of Christ is divisive.  I am evangelical and I get in
trouble with those who think we should water down the Gospel.  On those
matters I am with you here.  But not on this supersession thing.   It is the
first small step in the short  journey from religion to genocide.

I don't have the name - the common name is Andy but the man's real name I
don't have - Donia counted him as one of the four architects of genocide in
Bosnia - Milosevic and Karadzic being two of the four - this Andy was a good
friend of Donia.  Donia is Hope '67 and this Andy was a visiting professor
at Hooe College (which is RCA) for a year, and one of the four architects of
genocide.  This Andy being Bob's friend gives him a lot of pause - which is
why he feels so strongly on the issue of religious superiority, genocide,
and the distance from faith to genocide being a short one.  I didn't ask Bob
if he has read Goldhagen, but everything he said over the weekend supports
Goldhagen's thesis - that genocide arises from long held views that may not
seem to be hate but do involve the sense of the &quot;my&quot; being superior to the
&quot;other&quot; especially in religion.

This is long, I know and I will end soon.  As I continue the conversation
with Donia, I may share parts of that for he has much to teach me and I will
feel like sharing.  And I will get the name of Andy for those who question
whether this can be true.  But it is true - the oxymoron is &quot;my religion is
superior but I have no hate and my belief in the superiority of my religion
has no historical consequences; see what a nice person I am.&quot;

Donia has pictures of the genocide at Srebrenica, which now haunt my
theological speculation just as Aushwitz and Babi Yar have long done.  The
cross is ever reused.

Wild grasses rustle over Babi Yar,
The trees look sternly, as if passing judgement.
Here, silently, all screams, and, hat in hand,
I feel my hair changing shade to gray.

And I myself, like one long soundless scream
Above the thousands of thousands interred,
I'm every old man executed here,
As I am every child murdered here.
No fiber of my body will forget this.
