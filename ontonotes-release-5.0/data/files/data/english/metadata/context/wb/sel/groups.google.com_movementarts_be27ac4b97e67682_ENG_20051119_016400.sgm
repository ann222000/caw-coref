Contact Improvisation Fundamentals
with Patrick Crowley

Wednesdays 8:30-10pm
Nov 2- Dec 14, 2005

CONTACT IMPROVISATION is an exploration of the underlying principles of
movement as they play out in physical contact with a partner, the floor, and space.

We will study specific skills and states that will develop new creative and
neurological pathways,
giving the foundation for this form:

1) Moving from Center; your own &amp; shared center with partner
2) Groundedness/Balance/Falling off Balance
3) Changing Level
4) Giving/Supporting Weight
5) Point of Contact: rolling, sliding
6) 3-Dimension Awareness – in body and environment
7) Kinesthetic Listening; Trust, Safety, Presence
8) Improvisational Structures; Moving &amp; Witnessing

* physical skill building * states of mind and body * safe &amp; fun environment
*

$14 class

PLACE: Tree of Life, 440 Somerville Ave, Somerville, MA

GIVING THANKS
An Authentic Movement Workshop
with PATRICK CROWLEY

1–5 pm  Sunday, November 20, 2005

How can we allow ourselves to go through the layers as we inhabit our inner
landscape -- moving with eyes closed?   We will also explore the compassionate
action of witnessing ourselves and others, &quot;holding&quot; the experience in a
supportive, spacious, nonjudgemental way.   We will let the focus of giving thanks
permeate our time together.  As we progress, we will become active witnesses
working in dyads, committing to attention without expectation.   Come for a
wonderful journey of experiencing your self, others, and the archetypal energies
that move us!

This workshop is appropriate for anyone wanting to develop in their movement,
creative, body, personal, or spiritual practice.

CASANIA, 46 Porter Rd Cambridge, MA
