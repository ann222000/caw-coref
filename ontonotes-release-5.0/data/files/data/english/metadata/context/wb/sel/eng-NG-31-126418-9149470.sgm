I'm posting this here to get some feedback from the community before I
post a ticket:

Bake is great! but for me it's missing a critical bit of
functionality: A 'Bake All'

My current project has about 30 tables in. During the development
stage I've been customising the bake view templates to give my app the
look and feel we are after.

When it comes to baking the app, I have to run the bake script 60
times to build the app (30 for the controllers, 30 for the views). You
can guess how tedious this becomes during the course of a day...

Each time I bake the controllers I answer the questions identically
and same for the views.

Is there a way to get bake the whole app automatically? I've tried
writing DOS batch scripts (remember those?) but I can't seem to get it
to autofill the yes/no answers...

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding your comments, but I just tried baking
some stuff and I only had to run 'cake bake' once and was able to bake
3 controllers and 2 models (just as a test).  I didn't have to rerun
the script.

Although, it would be interesting to have a 'bake all' which simply
bakes all models and controllers based on those models.  Might be a
lot of work though.

I think I know what he's talking about.

I recently wrote a post on this at: http://www.webdevelopment2.com/ (but
it's scheduled for Monday, so it's not out yet :) )

Um...you don't Google much do you?
&quot;cakePHP bake&quot;

http://cakebaker.42dh.com/tags/bake/

The only thing you REALLY have to step through the process for is with the
models...

After that...

&quot;cake bake controller [controller] scaffold admin&quot;
and
&quot;cake bake view [view]&quot;

Should give you want you need. At least you won't have to go through all the
prompts.
Not exactly what you're looking for, but a bit closer.

You could then feed your controller and view names in via your batch script.

I create two solutions:
1. autobake model with all associations included automatically
and
2. shell script that genereate list of commands like
...
cake bake model A1 auto
cake bake model A2 auto
cake bake model A3 auto
...
cake bake controller A1s scaffold
cake bake view A1s scaffold
...

I will share second script in blog cakeexlorer.wordpress.com but 1st
solution require changes in /cake/console classes. This mean that i
need support it for working on edge. So i can't share this solution
with guaranties of support.

Main prob

Thanks for the feedback folks :-)

I've finished with the baking part for now, I'll try your suggestions
on the next project.
