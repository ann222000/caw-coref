I am scheduled for a radical prostatectomy in the near future.  One
problem - my wife, otherwise very supportive, doesn't seem to believe me
when I tell her that I am going to need 3 months of post-operative absolute
bed-rest and TLC!   Any helpful suggestions as to how to overcome this
problem??

Hello, Envo:

The amount of bed-rest you'll need depends on your general state of health
and the type of procedure -- but 3 months sounds pretty high!  On the other
hand, TLC is always needed in all things.

I was at the gym doing light workouts by day 15.

Walking slowly on the treadmill. Very light, light exercises of the
arms, chest, shoulders, etc....

Recovery comes quickly if you want it to.

Have her talk to your surgeon.  My wife is recovering from a double
mastectomy and wanted all that TLC.  Our  follow-up visit with her surgeon
yesterday convinced her to get out of the chair, back to walking and to
begin an exercise/rehab program at the local health center.  Ooops....maybe
I'm making the wrong point here.

Exercise.
If you are in any kind of shape pre-op, your extra-bed-rest-phase will
last a week or two after you return home. I hope that three-month thing
is a joke, as muscles atrophy very quickly if unused, even in teenagers.
You should be walking a lot within days, doing light localized exercises
in a couple of weeks, and resisting the impulse to wrestle with the
dog or a grandkid in a month.

If you were frail enough to need a month of bed rest post-op, I'd bet
your docs would have ruled out surgery.

I.P.

I guess you're just going to have to settle for the truth.

Has your wife NEVER attended a doctor's appointment with you?   I'm shocked
she hasn't been involved in all the discussions and details.   Are you
locking her in a closet?  Are you trying to get her in bed with you for 3
months?

I doubt you are going to find anyone, not a soul, who is going to believe it
either.

You aren't getting a heart or lung or brain transplant.  Unless you bribe
some doctors and nurses and physical therapists, you're going to be up and
walking the next day, or the day after at the latest.  They will hook all
your IV's to a post on a walker, and fasten the catheter to the walker, and
get you going up and down the halls of the hospital in no time at all.

Yup. 2nd day with me. In fact they wanted to head back to the room
but i wanted to walk
a little more. I was out walking the streets (slowly but walking)
within a week. I got plenty
of TLC and bed rest but got out walking as much as possible.  Felt
good.

Unless you're in a VA hospital, in which case it's up to you to drag
your own sore carcass out of bed, figure out how to set up the IV post,
get your slippers on, and manage your catheter.

Sorry to be so cynical, but after several surgeries in three different
VA hospitals over 20 years, I've concluded that's the norm there. On the
bright side, that has left me prepared -- I hope -- to handle most
recovery wards I'm likely to encounter over the next 20.

Three months?

I stayed one night at the hospital. Three days later I was driving my
car with my cateter.
