All,

After banging my head against the dash, buying a new battery and
alternator i am about to tow my Xtreme to the nearest scrap heap
(should get quite an bit of money thanks to the stainless steel) that
is however, dependant on whether or not anyone can shed any light on
my electrical gremlins.

The storey so far, car took a few attempts to pass MOT so only done a
handfull of short runs in the past 6 weeks or so. Everytime i go to
start it, it struggles, but eventually goes. Tried charging the
battery with no luck, so go out and but a new one, bingo, untill i try
starting it for the 3rd or 4th time, try charging the new one and
don't seem to be able to get much above 12v.

So i check the output from the alternator (at the battery) whilst the
car is running and it read 9.5v, so assume the alternator is f**ked.
Get a new alternator, fit it t, jump start it and it runs..........
however checking the voltage across the battery again shows a 9.5
ish.  Leave it running for 10 or minutyes, switch it off, try to start
it again and nothing.

If 'doner' car is left connected to the Xtreme voltage stays around
the 14v mark, disconnect the 'doner' car and voltage slowly drops to
9.5v and voltage at alternator drops at roughly the same rate.

The other strange thing is the tacho is not registering anything and
the speedo does not measure the speed (electronic speedo) but does
show the mileage on the lcd display. And absolutly nothing else has
been tinkered with since the last time it was out and about.

If you can help me out it'd be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Sean

The 9.5 volts is the issue the other Speedo symptoms are probably as a
result. As you say it should be 14V and the gauge systems normally regulate
this down to 12V to use as a stable reference. A low reference or if it
wanders will cause strange results.
Simple electronics theory Volts current and resistance are linked.
So make sure all the earth connections are good a bad one will cause high
resistance. If this does not work unplug all unnecessary equipment and check
to see if there is a part pulling down the current, I don't expect this so
much as the jump car can keep the out put up.
Have you been measuring the voltages at tick over? Does it alter if the
engine revs are increased?
Check for melted, crimped, squashed wires Etc
What is the engine pinto / Zetec?

I suspect you may have more than one problem.

First of all, when you say you &quot;tried charging the old battery with no
luck&quot; what happened ?, even with a knackered battery the voltage across
the battery should rise as soon as the charger is connected and get to
13 or 14 volts.
Unless you have one of these new battery chargers which won't charge a
really flat battery, or with a faulty battery it charges for a few
seconds and then trips out saying fully charged.
Batterys nowadays don't like being deep discharged, if it has been left
6 weeks on the car with an alarm connected then it may well have lost
most of it's capacity and won't recharge. Luckily i've always been able
to get them replaced under warranty in this condition.

Also, is your alternator warning light working, if that doesn't come on
when you turn on the ignition then the alternator won't charge when the
engine is running.
The current through the light is used to provide power for the field
winding in the alternator when the alternator spins up, no light no
charging (on almost all types of alternator).
If you warning lights are LEDS then they may not provide enough power
either. Or if you have a digi dash, some of those don't seem to have an
alternator warning light.  In which case you either want to fit one or a
suitable resistor in the circuit.

Since some of your gauges aren't working then it may well be that the
ignition powered side of the warning light isn't getting power either
(and therefore the alternator) so you need to find the cause of that
problem as well, maybe a fuse or a wiring problem.
The trip meter on the speedo is often powered from a continuous live
supply so it stays on with the ignition off so thats a different circuit.

I don't have an Xtreme wiring diagram to be sure, maybe somebody could
email me one.

What i can't quite explain is why the new battery (which normally come
pretty well fully charged) only lasted 3 or 4 starts.
Have you access to a current meter that you could connect in series with
the battery (don't try and start the car !!!!) to see what the current
drain is with the ignition off (should be &lt;0.05 amps) and with it on but
no lights or wipers etc (should be pretty low).

Unfortunately i'm now out for the day but hopefully it might give you a
clue or somebody else can carry on the diagnostics from here.

I know what it's like when these things happen, if it gets too bad just
shut the garage door and go and do something else for a day !
I did that for 6 months when i first started building my 2+2 and i
couldn't get the door glass right.

A bad earth could only stop the battery charging properly.
If you are measuring the voltage directly across the battery terminals
and it's dropping from 12v to 9.5 volts that quickly then the battery is
not charged or if it has been charger it's faulty, no question about it.
A fully charged good battery with nothing connected to it's terminals
should be 12.6 to 12.8 volts, 12.0 volts is almost flat.

Checked all the earths and all are good and now nice and clean.

Point taken about the possible faulty battery, however, I started and
ran the engine with the 'doner' car connected but it's engine not
running and voltage across the battery was 12.15v, rather than at rest
13.5v.

When the Xtreme engine is running (with 'doner' car battery not
connected) the voltage, drops and was still dropping at 8.9v. However
when the engine is switched off, the voltage (after a few minutes)
returns to 12v. Ignition in position 1, no change, ignition in
position 2, votage drops.

I disconnected my Facet fuel pump and re-installed the mechanical one
and the same scenario as above happens.

Have checked the wiring that is visible and no signs of melting
together or excess heat.

Although the Xtreme battery may not be in tip-top shape, something is
still drawing power from the system, next potential culprit is the
starter motor, but it's a tad difficult to disconnect whilst the
engine is running. Otherwise it's a case of biting the bullet and
getting and installing a new starter motor.

Any more suggestions ?

Hi sean,

I think you have to be sure that the battery is in good condition. If
you can find or borrow a high rate discharge tester (most garages will
have one - (you might be able to take the battery in and ask them to
test it - it only takes a few seconds, so there should be no charge
for it). When you connect the tester, the voltage reading should drop
to about 9 volts and hold there. If it starts dropping below that,
then the battery is questionable. If a cell starts gassing, it is U/S
(blow away any gas before releasing the testing - hydrogen is highly
explosive).

If the battery checks out ok, from what I have read in the previous
posts, it sounds like you have a major current draw somewhere, which
is having the same effect as using a high discharge tester. The
easiest way to try to identify which circuit is causing it is to have
a meter connected to the battery and one by one remove each fuse and
watch for a significant change on the meter. Remove and replace each
fuse in turn. This should narrow it down a bit.

Failing all this, I think you need to double check that your new
alternator is indeed new and not just a painted old one and check all
of the wiring in the alternator circuit. I might have an old sierra
manual at home that I can look at, but I am at work and won't be home
until around 7pm.

I hope this simple test helps.

What happens if you pull all the fuses?  Could you disconnect the
starter from the battery once it's started?  If not, disconnect the
starter first, and run a separate cable to it which you can disconnect
easily once it's going.  Could try the same thing with the alternator
maybe...

I had a &quot;new&quot; (read recon) alternator on my fiesta. As the original went
bad. A specialist connected his meter and said all was OK. Still the warning
light flickered away at low revs more with power drain (lights Etc). took it
to a back street garage advertising free checks and he came out with a
moving coil meter in a spray paint patch box. Connected it up and was
advised that the &quot;new&quot; alternator had dropped a winding as the needle dipped
slightly each turn and was Duff. I would disconnect any item that was not
related to the donor car first to see if it makes a difference, if not then
as advised pull fuses 1 by 1.

Thats about what i'd expect if the alternator on the Xtreme isn't
charging the battery.
You didn't reply about the ignition warning light, what is that doing
and why aren't the other gauges working ?
I'd fix that problem first and you may fix the other problem as well.
That and i think your Xtreme battery is flat or duff.

To draw enough power from a fully charged battery to drop the voltage to
9.5 volts you'd be looking at around a 100 amps
You'd know if anything was drawing that much pretty quickly as it would
be smoking !
Your battery is flat or knackered which is why a much smaller load is
dropping the battery voltage.

Connect your test meter on the 10 amp range in series with the battery
(ie disconnect the wires from the postive on the battery and joint them
back to the battery via the meter).
The turn on the ignition (but on no account try to start the car) and
see what the current drain is.

Ignition light works and rest of the gauges work OK until the voltage
on the battery drops to about 9.5v

I've also pulled a couple of small wires from the solenoid and i'm
buggered if i can remember where the white/red one goes.

I've had it up to my eye balls today with it, so will test the
batteries tomorrow.

Gary, Jim, Bob &amp; Tony, thanks for all the help today, hopefully i'll
get it sorted in the next couple of days and be able to drive it
before winter sets

Now wheres that nice cold beer with my name on it..........

A couple of points raised here.  I can't add anything to the trouble
shooting tips etc already supplied, but often on a problem like this
it can help to sit back and think about the configuration when it last
worked OK and what's happened since.  By virtue of the fact you've
been for an MoT, I assume its not a new build.

When I have such problems, I often find its something I've done, so I
retreat, open a cold beer and think back.  Have you changed anything
since it last worked, had the engine out, done any modifications that
could have affected this and missed connecting any wires or connected
incorrectly.  If you've done anything, question if it could have
caused the problem(s) you are having.

On the subject of red white, I checked the Q Manual and its not very
explicit, as best I can tell both the white/red and white/ yellow go
to the starter solenoid.  However like I said the manual isn't too
clear and will back my car out later and check.

Nigel,

It'd be appreciated if you cold confirm where the red/white wire goes
and agree the build manual isn't clear.

The only thing that has been changed since the car was last out and
about is one of the headlights. During which time I noticed that the
headlight was on main beam instead of dip, so I switched the wires
around.

I did pull each fuse out one by one yesterday and the only fuse that
made any difference was the one for the ignition / fuel pump, which
doesn't really help, except confirm what i already knew.

Sean,
It definitely sounds like a knackered battery. Disconnect it and
connnect your jump battery directly if possible or use jump leads if
not (make sure the jump leads can't short on anything). Don't start
the donor vehicle, just try to start the xtreme. if it starts and
charges, then you have solved the problem. You can also check the
state of charge of the battery with a hydrometer (a couple of quid
from a good motor factor).

This may seem like an obvious question but you haven't mentioned it so
far. Does the battery have sufficient electrolyte in it?

Bob,

I'm getting my battery tested by my local garage today. 1 of the is
only about 3 weeks old, so if it is knackered, then i'll be taking it
back and getting a replacement.

I did connect my jump battery to the Xtreme (without jump car engine
running) and started it up and voltage at jump battery was reading
just over 12v.

The 1st battery electrolyte level was not covering the elements, I
topped it up but never managed to revive it.

This is getting to sound like an interesting article for the club
magazine....... I guess i should be taking some photos with a confused
look on my face pointing at various batteries etc :-)

White red and white yellow are connected together and go to the
starter solenoid.

My engine is a Zetec so have to interpolate bewteen the std manual and
Zwetec manual, to try an make sense.  Oh wouldn't a full wiring
diagram be wonderful!!

White red is the starter signal from the ignition switch, so not sure
how you're cranking it if this is disconnected.

White yellow is a bit of a mystery!!  On the Pinto it should feed into
a Ford wire for the coil electronic ignition set up.  The reference in
the manual states - feed from starter (white yellow) to Ford black
green (Pinto only).  The hook up should be at the six pin plug just on
the engine side of the bulk head.  I'm pretty sure on my Zetec with
Omex it is dead ended.  Give Paul at Q a call he would help.
Whichever way they both go to the same starter hook up.

If you want the manual sections let me have your e mail and I will
scan for you.

Other points of note on manual, brown yellow is the ign light source
to alternator and there should be a junction for this somewhere
between the starter and alternator near to starter, although it is not
connected to starter.  Two heavy brown wires on alternator should go
directly to starter.

I'm not convinced its a battery problem as it should be reading more
than 12v with the donor battery hooked up and engine running if the
alternator is charging correctly.  Still thats not too helpful a
comment and will be interesting to see outcome of the checks.  Another
point to note is that about a year ago I fitted a new alternator
(Chinese) and when I first start the car it requires revving to about
1800 RPM, before it starts to charge and the ign light goes out,
thereafter it charges fine at tickover.  This was in line with the
info supplied with the alternator, but it was the first time I had
come across this.   I note that in the correspondence you don't
mention what the ign light is doing in all this (or I've missed it!).

Good luck with battery checks.

This may seem a little cheeky, but have you checked to see if the wire
going between the alternator and the battery is connected (and on the
correct battery terminal)?

It probably goes from the alternator to the starter and from there to
the battery.
It's also worth noting that running an alternator without the output
cable connected is quite likely to damaged it.

Well I think the problem is now sorted.

I got both batteries tested yesterday and the one which is 3 weeks old
is dead. Went back to Halfords last night to get a replacement, they
also tested it and said it was unservicable, just before I left the
counter i asked them to test the one they were about to give me and
sure enough this also came up as unservicable, probably a duff batch
of batteries.

Anyway, got a slightly different spec one and got that test and it was
OK. So went home, re-attached the wires to the starter, fitted the
battery and ......

It started and the new alternator was charging. I am going to check a
few other items (whether or not my Halfords battery charger actually
works and a full test on the alternator) and should be back tearing
around at the weekend..

Thanks to all that have helped and no thanks to Mr Halfords for
selling me a duff battery, causing me to spend money on an alternator
that i probably didn't need and adding to the number of grey hairs on
top of my head.

Thanks again,

Sean

I've a sneaky recollection that batteries are supplied to stores dry, and
that the stores add the acid to them prior to selling them.

Bearing in mind that the average Halfords employee is a spotty 16 year-old
with a passion for loud speakers and LED washer jets, it wouldn't surprise
me to find the entire stock in your store had been filled with brake
fluid, tap water, or any other colourless fluid.

Aye, I was going to say that as well.. the only thing they could
possibly do is to top up the electrolyte, but I've not known a new
battery to need this.  But then I've always got my batteries from the

The acid _IS_ the electrolyte?  (Albeit with distilled water added).

I've got 2 Halfords maintenance-free batteries in the garage; they both
have push-in caps on top so you can check the levels.  You would add
acid/electrolyte through these.

In olden days, batteries were certainly supplied dry (you even used to
see labels indicating that they had been &quot;dry charged&quot; and which had a
space for the shop to fill in the date they first charged it.

Check out the following link for more info - it's aimed at motorcycle
batteries but reads across for (older?) cars too:

http://www.getgeared.co.uk/productinfo/batteries/Act_GGBatteryBuyingG...
.html

The stamped date would be the date of first charge - probably the &quot;dry
charge&quot; at the manufacturing plant.

But maybe retailers are selling more factory sealed items these days -
it would certainly suit their profile better.

I would be very surprised if places such as Halfords, or any other
general car parts supplier for that matter, filled the batteries in
the shop these days. The electrolyte is sulfuric acid and as you can
imagine the health and safety legislation regarding the use, storage
and training is very tight. I suspect they are delivered filled and
charged. Halfords have them on shelves and you simply pick it up and
pay (through the nose) for it.

A battery needs to be used to work properly. If it sits idle for too
long, the plates start to sulphate and it loses its capacity to hold a
charge, or eventually, take a charge at all. There are systems
available to recover a battery but they are not available to the
general public, as far as I know.

Motorbike batteries pretty much always come dry charged with 6

I once spilt battery acid on my hand whilst getting one of two out
from under the landy seat, I wondered what all the fuss was about, it
took about a minute before anything really happened... oooooowwwwwch

&gt; Haven't got many years of experience behind me in these things given

&gt; Given the UK's HSE culture, I can't see any halfords' monkeys being
&gt; allowed anywhere near battery acid without a full lead-suit, PPE,
&gt; emergency cleaning equipment........, plus the batteries come with

Cheapest place I found for batteries was makro (the cash and carry
place).  A massive 650 Ah battery for the landy was £30, halfords
price was £85.

A Siemens engineer gave me a tip - I've used it and found it to work ....
But do be careful, and I (and I guess the QOC) take no responsibility etc
for the outcome or safety issues. If the battery is DEAD FLAT and therefore
unlikely to be any good, it's worth a try.
Make sure it is fully discharged (rig up a bulb and get it DEAD FLAT if
necessary). Remove the cell caps (and in a well ventilated area) using a
trickle charger connect the battery to the incorrect terminals (ie reverse
charge) and charge for 10 minutes. You will see cells fizzing and the
electrolyte getting cloudy/dirty. Keep a constant watch on it and don't
leave it and forget it! After it's 10 minutes, disconnect (switch off at
plug in case of any gasses/sparks) and leave for 24 hrs. The next day you
should see the electrolyte is clear. Trickle charge in the proper way and
the battery MAY be good again. Basically the reverse charge cleans the
plates, then over the 24hrs any matter falls to the bottom on the battery,
then you charge again to get a (hopefully ) good battery........

&gt; I would be very surprised if places such as Halfords, or any other

&gt; the shop these days. The electrolyte is sulfuric acid and as you can

&gt; A battery needs to be used to work properly. If it sits idle for too

Now you come to mention it, i've been told that before as well, i'd just
forgotten about it !

I've heard of somebody who managed to charge a completely flat battery
up the wrong way round and then got rather lot of damage when he
connected it up to the car.

There is an American company who have came up with a system of battery
regeneration (much to the annoyance of the battery companies). They
also claim to be able to put an additive in new batteries that will
prolonge their life. This isn't such a big factor in the motor trade
as it is in the industrial battery market (e.g fork lift, floor
sweepers, etc) where a battery can cost thousands of pounds. They have
successfully broken into the market in Australia and New Zealand and
are currently negotiating with some UK companies (watch this space).
