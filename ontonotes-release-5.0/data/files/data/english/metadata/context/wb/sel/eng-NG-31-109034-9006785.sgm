to Nielsen&quot;
(c) 1951 by Malcolm Leveson
Columbia Press: Columbia [Knoxville, Tennessee]

The Great War saw the first substantial naval clashes since the
Brazilian Civil War.  Twenty years of development in technology and
armaments had taken place during that conflict, but the lack of
practical experience meant that doctrine had not advanced to match
it.  As the navies of the world prepared to fight battles which they
expected to be even bloodier than the North American War, they did so
with naval tactics and battle plans which were going to be sorely
tested.

While some strategists had certainly recognised some of the
implications of technological developments, naval planners had not
taken into account the combination of improvements in reconnaissance
and gunnery.  Naval doctrine had been shaped by the results of the
Battle of Long Island.  In most nations' navies, planning still
centred on the need to fight a decisive engagement with the enemy's
battleships and gain control of the seas.  This had been possible a
generation before, but naval planners usually underestimated the
cumulative of skyborne reconnaissance, instantaneous funk
communications, and larger and longer-range naval guns.

Combined, these developments meant that capital ship battles would
usually be fought at substantially longer ranges than those which had
been fought off New England.  Given that battleship armour had also
become substantially improved since the last war, this meant that it
would be much harder for capital ships to sink each other,
particularly the most modern battleships.  This was a lesson which had
been indicated during the earliest days of the war, when every
battleship on both sides survived the Battle of Suez.  But it would
take larger naval engagements to make this lesson clear.  This was
demonstrated firstly in the Battle of Neu Tessel [Lan Yu / Orchid
Island, Taiwan] and then the Battle of Dogger Bank...

Keio University, Tokyo, Empire of Nippon
English Translation by Kathryn Warner

To the citizens of Nippon and Australia, the course of events which
led to the Great War was both expected and strange.  The turbulent
years of the Nervous Twenties had demonstrated the potential for a
global war, and most foresighted people were uneasily aware that one
would break out sooner or later.  What proved surprising about the
Great War was that so many crises in East Asia had brought the Great
Powers to the brink of war, and yet each had been resolved.  When war
came, it was over a relatively distant crisis which had not been
considered any more likely to turn to armed conflict than several
previous crises over the last decade.  So the immediate outbreak of
war came as a surprise to most Nipponese and Australians...

With the coming of war, it was self-evident to most military
strategists that it was the clash of naval arms that would determine
the immediate course of the Far Eastern theatre.  While large land
armies were available in China and India, they were of questionable
political loyalty, and in any case their deployment to new
battlefields would require control of the seas.

In such a contest, the Bouclier had the clear advantage.  The full
might of the Imperial Japanese Navy was concentrated in the Pacific,
and it had the support of the Royal Australian Navy.  Germany had its
Far Eastern Fleet, based in Formosa, but this fleet was comprised of
older capital ships, with the most modern battleships being deployed
to theatres closer to the German homeland [1]...

Formosa had been a bastion of German colonial pride since the 1850s,
and its primary ports of Zeelandia [Tainan] and Haven Regen [Keelung]
were heavily fortified.  But these could not alleviate the fundamental
logistical difficulties of maintaining control of an island so far
from Germany's homeland and so near to Nippon's Home Islands.  Nippon
had long before developed plans for the invasion of Formosa, and these
needed only quick updates for the situation in which Nippon found
itself at the outbreak of the Great War.

In preparation for the conquest of Formosa, the IJN concentrated all
ten of its available battleships, including the newly-commissioned
Yamashiro and Fusa [2].  Australia despatched a battle group formed
around the battleships New South Wales and New Zealand, which
rendezvoused with the Grand Fleet at Kagoshima on 2 August 1929.  Five
days later, the Combined Fleet was off the coast of Formosa, covering
the landing of five divisions of marines at Blau Stieg [3].  As the
IJN had expected, this brought the Far Eastern Fleet out to fight...

The Battle of Neu Tessel was an uneven contest, with twelve Bouclier
battleships including several of the most modern types engaging half
that number of older German battleships.  Yet for all of this apparent
disparity, and the support of a small number of skycraft on each side,
converting the Bouclier numerical advantage to the sinking of German
battleships proved to be remarkably difficult.  All six of the German
battleships were damaged to a greater or lesser degree during the
battle, but none were sunk during the main engagement.

The Far Eastern Fleet withdrew from Formosa, pursued by the faster
ships from the Combined Fleet.  The most badly-damaged German
battleship, the Laudon, suffered further bombardment damage from the
New South Wales and Yamashiro, but eluded its pursuers again, only to
be fatally torpedoed by a sea wolf off Hainan.  The next most-damaged
battleship, the Habsburg sought to come to the aid had suffered damage
to its steering at Neu Tessel, and at the urging of its commander, was
left behind by the remaining German battleships as they made for
Haiphong.  Habsburg was caught by Fusa and Mikasa, and was unable to
elude its pursuers.  After receiving intensive bombardment, Habsburg
caught fire and sank; the first battleship of the Great War to be sunk
by another battleship...

The remains of the Far Eastern Fleet gathered at Haiphong.  Vienna and
Danzig were the least-damaged of Germany's battleships, and were put
into dry-dock, where they were expected to be repaired within weeks.
Luik was considered too badly damaged to be repaired, and was
deliberately sunk in shallow water in the Red River Delta, where its
still-functional guns were to provide fixed defensive support in the
event of any Bouclier attack on Haiphong.

The remaining battleship, the Lübeck, was unable to be repaired in
Haiphong or any other available Far Eastern port due to lack of
suitable drydock space.  Eventually, it was ordered to return to the
port of Jabuuti, where the ship could be potentially be repaired.  Due
to successful British decryption of German naval codes, the movement
of the Lübeck was anticipated.  It was caught south of Socotra by the
Liberian battleship Liberty.  After receiving further damage during
the engagement, Lübeck's commander decided to scuttle the ship rather
than allowing it to fall into Bouclier control.  However, after the
regular sailors had abandoned ship, some of the scuttling charges
failed to detonate properly.  The badly-damaged Lübeck was boarded and
repaired by Liberian sailors, who claimed it as a prize of war...

By Admiral John Cochrane (ret.) and Prof. Albert McLaughlin
(c) 1944 New Cambridge University Press
Sydney, Kingdom of Australia
Used with permission.

The Krijgmarine had made several efforts to draw the Royal Navy into
battle in the opening months of the war, mostly through repeated
sorties into the North Sea, only to see their foes remain resolutely
in port.  These efforts came to an abrupt halt with the entry of the
United States and New England into the war.  This forced a rethink of
German naval strategy, because it was apparent that the Royal Navy
would not commit itself to a battle until the US and New England
fleets arrived from North America.  At least not for any reason short
of German landings on Great Britain itself.  Since these were not
likely to be forthcoming, the naval manoeuvrings in the North Sea
degenerated into stalemate for the remainder of the year.

In early 1930, with Paris besieged and Allied land forces preparing
for a counter-attack, the Royal Navy finally received its expected
reinforcements.  The US Navy sent a large naval contingent spearheaded
by the new battleships Wilkinson and Coahuila.  New England used its
skycraft carriers to transfer several hundred naval skycraft to
operate from land bases in Kent and Northumbria, although the carriers
themselves remained in the Atlantic.

After some internal debate, the German naval command wanted to force a
battle while they could still consider themselves to have a reasonable
chance of success.  They expected, correctly, that British and
American ships were still not used to operating together.  German
intelligence brought reports of several brawls between British and
American sailors, and that more American battleships were to be
redeployed from the Pacific.  With these incentives for quick action,
the bulk of the Krijgmarine sortied into the North Sea on 16 March
1930.

This time, the Royal Navy came out to meet them.

Interesting, When and how did Wales get a National Assembly?  I take it
this is some devolved legislative body meeting in Cardiff?

I also take it that the Cymry Nationalist Party is a relatively new

Looks like Wales is a reluctant ally in the United Kingdom, any reason
why?

All very interesting!

You don't have to share intelligence to get this result. If your intel
leads you to allocate more resources to patrolling certain areas, you
don't have to tell your allies why. And if you know a specific route
will be used, it would even make sense to encourage your ally take
that patrol sector, to reduce suspicion that you have broken codes.
Famously, only a handful of people on Malta knew about Ultra, but they
sent patrols to areas to find convoys. The pilots may have suspected
that there was intel behind the patrol instructions, but the Italians
knew that they had been spotted by aircraft.

Errol Cavit | If you took the whole of Norway, scrunched it up a bit,
shook out all the moose and reindeer, hurled it 10,000 miles around

Hmm.  Good point.  Given the way things are going, I'd expect the

There's no need for the British to reveal to the Liberians the source
of their intelligence.  Something as simple as &quot;reconnaissance

Well, from a naval intelligence point of view, using the Liberians is
the best cover of all.  Having them intercept the Lubeck is certainly
not going to suggest that Britain has been reading naval codes.

As far as strengthening Liberia, Britain certainly wasn't expecting
that the Lubeck would be captured.  Just sunk.

&gt; 2- Surely the biggest German drydocks east of Suez are in Java or

Yes, a small retcon is probably in order.  The main drydocks would be
in Java, not Haiphong, but they are full with the two other
battleships.  Djibouti is the only alternative.  And yes, Djibouti is
isolated, but with the Suez Canal isolated, the Royal Navy is mostly
further south, too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3- Why tell the Liberians, rather than leaving the capture to the

Mostly the intention of plausible deniability; it makes it even less
likely that suspicion will fall on British codebreaking.  There's also
the detail that the Liberty is the oldest battleship in the Bouclier
navy; certainly capable of defeating a damaged German battleship, but
the one most readily spared from other duties.  And the most readily
sacrificed, if things do go wrong somewhere.

It is a tactical draw, yes, but a Bouclier strategic victory.  The
reason there wasn't more carnage amongst the capital ships was that,
as far as I can tell, battleships of this era are actually very
unlikely to sink each other.  Damage, sure, but unless the damaged
ships can be pursued effectively, they'll just withdraw to the nearest
port and refit.

He was a former prime minister, but after losing office he was
jettisoned as leader of the opposition, and his chances of regaining
leadership of Labour were not high.  Making the jump to being a
(hopefully) big fish in a smaller pond was a relatively attractive
option.  OTL's Lloyd George was perfectly prepared to change parties
if he thought it would suit his political fortunes, so I figured an

&gt; &gt; have gathered here today not to abandon the war, but remind our
&gt; &gt; brothers and sisters in England that a great war is not an excuse to
&gt; &gt; forget a great need.  Cymru needs a home of its own, and while we will
&gt; &gt; always stand alongside England, we will not stand under them forever.

&gt; Interesting how this speech tells us Wales is revolting by not telling
&gt; us that it is...

Not open revolt, exactly, but the push for Kingdom status has been
getting increasingly loud throughout the twentieth century.

The National Assembly is a devolved body with _very_ limited power.
It was mostly created as a sounding board, by Lloyd George himself no
less, in the early 1920s.

Of course, now that it's formed and Lloyd George is involved, he'd
rather it have more power rather than less.

Yes.  Created rather noisily by Lloyd George when he broke from the
Labour Party after being ousted as leader of the opposition.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Oh, they're mostly willing to fight.  They just want to do it the same
way in which Ireland is doing it; under their own banner and own armed
forces.  There's a certain mistrust of &quot;English&quot; army commanders
stretching back to the North American War and the perceived
incompetence there.  Plus a few voices who think that this is the
perfect time to argue for Kingdom status.

Fleet (noun) = group of ships
fleet (verb, adj.) = to move quickly; rapid

It's a double pun (in the groaning sense of the word.)  As Errol Cavit
notes downthread, &quot;fleet&quot; meaning both a group of ships and &quot;moving
rapidly&quot;.  And the Combined Fleet in OTL was the name for the Japanese
fleet when they made a combined action; ATL it's how the &quot;author&quot; has
chosen to translate the name of the allied Japanese-Australian fleet.

Very much so.  In one sense the Liberals wouldn't mind losing some
competition, but they also believe more in the unity of the United
Kingdom.  So in other words, neither of the main British parties is
very keen on the idea.

That was what I figured.  Where does a former Prime Minister go, when
he knows he will never get back into leadership of his own party, but
who wants to stay in office and have some sense of power?
