China's Death Penalty and Tales of the Organ Trade

Chinese government is using mobile execution buses to execute
people and take their organs

CHONGQING, China  Zhang Shiqiang, known as the Nine-Fingered Devil,
first tasted justice at 13. His father caught him stealing and cut off
one of Zhang's fingers.

Twenty-five years later, in 2004, Zhang met retribution once more, after
his conviction for double murder and rape. He was one of the first
people put to death in China's new fleet of mobile execution chambers.

The country that executed more than four times as many convicts as the
rest of the world combined last year is slowly phasing out public
executions by firing squad in favor of lethal injections. Unlike the
United States and Singapore, the only two other countries where death is
administered by injection, China metes out capital punishment from
specially equipped &quot;death vans&quot; that shuttle from town to town.

Makers of the death vans say the vehicles and injections are a civilized
alternative to the firing squad, ending the life of the condemned more
quickly, clinically and safely. The switch from gunshots to injections
is a sign that China &quot;promotes human rights now,&quot; says Kang Zhongwen,
who designed the Jinguan Automobile death van in which &quot;Devil&quot; Zhang
took his final ride.

State secret

For years, foreign human rights groups have accused China of arbitrary
executions and cruelty in its use of capital punishment. The exact
number of convicts put to death is a state secret. Amnesty International
estimates there were at least 1,770 executions in China in 2005  vs. 60
in the United States, but the group says on its website that the toll
could be as high as 8,000 prisoners.

The &quot;majority are still by gunshot,&quot; says Liu Renwen, death penalty
researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a think tank in
Beijing. &quot;But the use of injections has grown in recent years, and may
have reached 40%.&quot;

China's critics contend that the transition from firing squads to
injections in death vans facilitates an illegal trade in prisoners'
organs.

Injections leave the whole body intact and require participation of
doctors. Organs can &quot;be extracted in a speedier and more effective way
than if the prisoner is shot,&quot; says Mark Allison, East Asia researcher
at Amnesty International in Hong Kong. &quot;We have gathered strong evidence
suggesting the involvement of (Chinese) police, courts and hospitals in
the organ trade.&quot;

Executions in death vans are recorded on video and audio that is played
live to local law enforcement authorities  a measure intended to ensure
they are carried out legally.

China's refusal to give outsiders access to the bodies of executed
prisoners has added to suspicions about what happens afterward: Corpses
are typically driven to a crematorium and burned before relatives or
independent witnesses can view them.

Chinese authorities are sensitive to allegations that they are complicit
in the organ trade. In March, the Ministry of Health issued regulations
explicitly banning the sale of organs and tightening approval standards
for transplants.

Even so, Amnesty International said in a report in April that huge
profits from the sale of prisoners' organs might be part of why China
refuses to consider doing away with the death penalty.

&quot;Given the high commercial value of organs, it is doubtful the new
regulations will have an effect,&quot; Allison says.

Local executions

Makers of death vans say they save money for poor localities that would
otherwise have to pay to construct execution facilities in prisons or
court buildings. The vans ensure that prisoners sentenced to death can
be executed locally, closer to communities where they broke the law.

That &quot;deters others from committing crime and has more impact&quot; than
executions carried out elsewhere, Kang says.

From the outside, the vans resemble the police vehicles seen daily on
China's roads. A look inside reveals their function.

&quot;I'm most proud of the bed. It's very humane, like an ambulance,&quot; Kang
says. He points to the power-driven metal stretcher that glides out at
an incline. &quot;It's too brutal to haul a person aboard,&quot; he says. &quot;This
makes it convenient for the criminal and the guards.&quot;

The lethal cocktail used in the injections is mixed only in Beijing,
something that has prompted complaints from local courts.

&quot;Some places can't afford the cost of sending a person to Beijing
perhaps $250  plus $125 more for the drug,&quot; says Qiu Xingsheng, a
former judge working as a lawyer in Chongqing. Death-by-gunshot requires
&quot;very little expense,&quot; he says.

Qiu has attended executions by firing squad where the kneeling prisoner
is shot in the back of the head. The guards &quot;ask the prisoner to open
his mouth, so the bullet can pass out of the mouth and leave the face
intact,&quot; he says.

No debate

In the United States, some death row inmates and death penalty opponents
want the Supreme Court to declare lethal injections cruel and unusual. A
recent lawsuit claimed inmates suffer excruciating pain during
executions because they do not get enough anesthetic.

There is no such debate in China, which uses the same three-drug
cocktail as the U.S. federal government and most U.S. states: sodium
thiopental to make the condemned unconscious, pancuronium bromide to
stop breathing, potassium chloride to stop the heart.

People's Daily and other state media describe the mix as a &quot;non-virulent
drug,&quot; bringing about &quot;immediate clinical death while inflicting no
physiological pain.&quot;

&quot;It doesn't matter what method you use,&quot; Qiu says. &quot;If someone is
convicted of a capital crime, they should be executed.&quot;

Chinese prisoners condemned to death are not offered a choice of
injection over gunshot, but Qiu and others suspect wealth and
connections can buy the newer method.

&quot;It is a real phenomenon that gangsters and corrupt officials are killed
by injection more than gunshot, so their bodies are intact, and death is
less painful,&quot; Liu says. &quot;But I doubt it is government policy. These
criminals are usually held in cities, where the injection is used.
Common criminals are held in county-level facilities, where shooting is
more common.&quot;

Tycoon Yuan Baojing was executed in March in a death van, in northeast
China's Liaoyang city. He had been convicted of arranging the murder of
a man trying to blackmail him for attempting to assassinate a business
partner.

Sixty-eight different crimes  more than half non-violent offenses such
as tax evasion and drug smuggling  are punishable by death in China.
That means the death vans are likely to keep rolling.

&quot;If we abolish the death penalty, then crime will grow,&quot; Kang says.

&gt; &quot;Given the high commercial value of organs, it is doubtful the new
&gt; regulations will have an effect,&quot; Allison says.

&gt; Local executions

&gt; Makers of death vans say they save money for poor localities that would
&gt; otherwise have to pay to construct execution facilities in prisons or
&gt; court buildings. The vans ensure that prisoners sentenced to death can
&gt; be executed locally, closer to communities where they broke the law.

&gt; That &quot;deters others from committing crime and has more impact&quot; than
&gt; executions carried out elsewhere, Kang says.

&gt;  From the outside, the vans resemble the police vehicles seen daily on
&gt; China's roads. A look inside reveals their function.

&gt; &quot;I'm most proud of the bed. It's very humane, like an ambulance,&quot; Kang
&gt; says. He points to the power-driven metal stretcher that glides out at
&gt; an incline. &quot;It's too brutal to haul a person aboard,&quot; he says. &quot;This
&gt; makes it convenient for the criminal and the guards.&quot;

&gt; The lethal cocktail used in the injections is mixed only in Beijing,
&gt; something that has prompted complaints from local courts.

&gt; &quot;Some places can't afford the cost of sending a person to Beijing
&gt; perhaps $250  plus $125 more for the drug,&quot; says Qiu Xingsheng, a
&gt; former judge working as a lawyer in Chongqing. Death-by-gunshot requires
&gt; &quot;very little expense,&quot; he says.

&gt; Qiu has attended executions by firing squad where the kneeling prisoner
&gt; is shot in the back of the head. The guards &quot;ask the prisoner to open
&gt; his mouth, so the bullet can pass out of the mouth and leave the face
&gt; intact,&quot; he says.

&gt; No debate

&gt; In the United States, some death row inmates and death penalty opponents
&gt; want the Supreme Court to declare lethal injections cruel and unusual. A
&gt; recent lawsuit claimed inmates suffer excruciating pain during
&gt; executions because they do not get enough anesthetic.

&gt; There is no such debate in China, which uses the same three-drug
&gt; cocktail as the U.S. federal government and most U.S. states: sodium
&gt; thiopental to make the condemned unconscious, pancuronium bromide to
&gt; stop breathing, potassium chloride to stop the heart.

&gt; People's Daily and other state media describe the mix as a &quot;non-virulent
&gt; drug,&quot; bringing about &quot;immediate clinical death while inflicting no
&gt; physiological pain.&quot;

&gt; &quot;It doesn't matter what method you use,&quot; Qiu says. &quot;If someone is
&gt; convicted of a capital crime, they should be executed.&quot;

&gt; Chinese prisoners condemned to death are not offered a choice of
&gt; injection over gunshot, but Qiu and others suspect wealth and
&gt; connections can buy the newer method.

&gt; &quot;It is a real phenomenon that gangsters and corrupt officials are killed
&gt; by injection more than gunshot, so their bodies are intact, and death is
&gt; less painful,&quot; Liu says. &quot;But I doubt it is government policy. These
&gt; criminals are usually held in cities, where the injection is used.
&gt; Common criminals are held in county-level facilities, where shooting is
&gt; more common.&quot;

&gt; Tycoon Yuan Baojing was executed in March in a death van, in northeast
&gt; China's Liaoyang city. He had been convicted of arranging the murder of
&gt; a man trying to blackmail him for attempting to assassinate a business
&gt; partner.

&gt; Sixty-eight different crimes  more than half non-violent offenses such
&gt; as tax evasion and drug smuggling  are punishable by death in China.
&gt; That means the death vans are likely to keep rolling.

&gt; &quot;If we abolish the death penalty, then crime will grow,&quot; Kang says.
