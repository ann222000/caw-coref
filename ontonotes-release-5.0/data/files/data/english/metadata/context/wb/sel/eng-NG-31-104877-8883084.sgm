The Legend of the True Cross.

&lt;&lt;Adam before he died pursuaded SETH to return to the garden and plead
for the oil of mercy. Gabriel gave SETH the branch of the original
tree
from which Adam and Eve ate. This tree had blackened and withered away
when they had committed their &quot;happy sin&quot; or Felix culpa, but had
burst
forth anew when Michael promised man's future salvation. But Adam had
died when SETH returned, so he planted the branch on Adam's grave,
where
it lasted until Solomon's time as a mighty tree. Solomon cut it down
to
build, but it always changed shape and was thrown down as a BRIDGE.
When
the Queen of Sheba came to cross the water, she knelt in adoration at
the *SACRED WOOD* and prophesied that it would be used to nail a world
saviour who would defile and end the Jewish heritage.&gt;&gt;

I mildly handed it over to him. It read as follows:

Where was my uncle? I could easily imagine him tearing along some
solitary road, gesticulating, talking to himself, cutting the air with
his cane, and still thinking of the absurd bit of hieroglyphics. Would
he hit upon some clue? Would he come home in better humor? While these
thoughts were passing through my brain, I mechanically took up the
execrable puzzle and tried every imaginable way of grouping the
letters.
I put them together by twos, by threes, fours, and fives- in vain.
Nothing intelligible came out, except that the fourteenth, fifteenth,
and sixteenth made ice in English; the eighty-fourth, eighty-fifth,
and
eighty-sixth, the word sir; then at last I seemed to find the Latin
words rota, mutabile, ira, nec, atra.

&quot;Ha! there seems to be some truth in my uncle's notion, thought I.

Then again I seemed to find the word *LUCO*, which means *SACRED
WOOD*. Then
in the third line I appeared to make out labiled, a perfect Hebrew
word,
and at the last the syllables mere, are, mer, which were French.

It was enough to drive one mad. Four different idioms in this absurd
phrase. What connection could there be between ice, sir, anger, cruel,
sacred wood, changing, mother, are, and sea? The first and the last
might, in a sentence connected with Iceland, mean sea of ice. But what
of the rest of this monstrous cryptograph?

I was, in fact, fighting against an insurmountable difficulty; my
brain
was almost on fire; my eyes were strained with staring at the
parchment;
the whole absurd collection of letters appeared to dance before my
vision in a number of black little groups. My mind was possessed with
temporary hallucination- I was stifling. I wanted air. Mechanically I
fanned myself with the document, of which now I saw the back and then
the front.

Imagine my surprise when glancing at the back of the wearisome puzzle,
the ink having gone through, I clearly made out Latin words, and among
others craterem and terrestre.

I had discovered the secret!

&quot;Backwards!&quot; cried my uncle, in wild amazement.
&quot;Oh most cunning Saknussemm; and I to be such a blockhead!&quot;

He snatched up the document, gazed at it with haggard eye,
and read it out as I had done.

It read as follows:

In Sneffels IOCULIs craterem kem delibat

umbra Scartaris Julii intra calendas descende,
audas viator, et terrestre centrum attinges.
Kod feci. Arne Saknussemm

Which dog Latin being translated, reads as follows:

Descend into the crater of YOCUL of Sneffels, which the shade of
Scartaris caresses, before the kalends of July, audacious traveler,
and you will reach the center of the earth. I did it.

ARNE SAKNUSSEMM

YOU see, the whole island is composed of volcanoes,&quot; said the
Professor,
&quot;and remark carefully that they all bear the name of YOCUL. The word
is
Icelandic, and means a glacier. In most of the lofty mountains of that
region the volcanic eruptions come forth from icebound caverns. Hence
the name applied to every volcano on this extraordinary island.&quot;

Terrible detonations, like Heaven's artillery, began to multiply
themselves with fearful intensity. I could only compare them with the

And then the mad COMPASS, shaken by the wild electric
phenomena, confirmed me in my rapidly formed opinion.
T.S. Eliot (1888-1965).  The *SACRED WOOD*: Essays on Poetry and
Criticism.  1922.

Ben Jonson

THE reputation of Jonson has been of the most deadly kind that can be
compelled upon the memory of a great poet. To be universally accepted;
to be damned by the praise that quenches all desire to read the book;
to be afflicted by the imputation of the virtues which excite the
least pleasure; and to be read only by historians and antiquaries-this
is the most perfect conspiracy of approval. For some generations the
reputation of Jonson has been carried rather as a liability than as an
asset in the balance-sheet of English literature. No critic has
succeeded in making him appear pleasurable or even interesting.
Swinburne's book on Jonson satisfies no curiosity and stimulates no
thought. For the critical study in the &quot;Men of Letters Series&quot; by Mr.
Gregory Smith there is a place; it satisfies curiosity, it supplies
many just observations, it provides valuable matter on the neglected
masques; it only fails to remodel the image of Jonson which is settled
in our minds. Probably the fault lies with several generations of our
poets. It is not that the value of poetry is only its value to living
poets for their own work; but appreciation is akin to creation, and
true enjoyment of poetry is related to the stirring of suggestion, the
stimulus that a poet feels in his enjoyment of other poetry. Jonson
has provided no creative stimulus for a very long time; consequently
we must look back as far as Dryden-precisely, a poetic practitioner
who learned from Jonson-before we find a living criticism of Jonson's
work.      1
Yet there are possibilities for Jonson even now. We have no
difficulty in seeing what brought him to this pass; how, in contrast,
not with Shakespeare, but with Marlowe, Webster, Donne, Beaumont, and
Fletcher, he has been paid out with reputation instead of enjoyment.
He is no less a poet than these men, but his poetry is of the surface.
Poetry of the surface cannot be understood without study; for to deal
with the surface of life, as Jonson dealt with it, is to deal so
deliberately that we too must be deliberate, in order to understand.
Shakespeare, and smaller men also, are in the end more difficult, but
they offer something at the start to encourage the student or to
satisfy those who want nothing more; they are suggestive, evocative, a
phrase, a voice; they offer poetry in detail as well as in design. So
does Dante offer something, a phrase everywhere (tu se' ombra ed ombra
vedi) even to readers who have no Italian; and Dante and Shakespeare
have poetry of design as well as of detail. But the polished veneer of
Jonson reflects only the lazy reader's fatuity; unconscious does not
respond to unconscious; no swarms of inarticulate feelings are
aroused. The immediate appeal of Jonson is to the mind; his emotional
tone is not in the single verse, but in the design of the whole. But
not many people are capable of discovering for themselves the beauty
which is only found after labour; and Jonson's industrious readers
have been those whose interest was historical and curious, and those
who have thought that in discovering the historical and curious
interest they had discovered the artistic value as well. When we say
that Jonson requires study, we do not mean study of his classical
scholarship or of seventeenth-century manners. We mean intelligent
saturation in his work as a whole; we mean that in order to enjoy him
at all, we must get to the centre of his work and his temperament, and
that we must see him unbiased by time, as a contemporary. And to see
him as a contemporary does not so much require the power of putting
ourselves into seventeenth-century London as it requires the power of
setting Jonson in our London: a more difficult triumph of divination.
2
It is generally conceded that Jonson failed as a tragic dramatist;
and it is usually agreed that he failed because his genius was for
satiric comedy and because of the weight of pedantic learning with
which he burdened his two tragic failures. The second point marks an
obvious error of detail; the first is too crude a statement to be
accepted; to say that he failed because his genius was unsuited to
tragedy is to tell us nothing at all. Jonson did not write a good
tragedy, but we can see no reason why he should not have written one.
If two plays so different as The Tempest and The Silent Woman are both
comedies, surely the category of tragedy could be made wide enough to
include something possible for Jonson to have done. But the
classification of tragedy and comedy, while it may be sufficient to
mark the distinction in a dramatic literature of more rigid form and
treatment-it may distinguish Aristophanes from Euripides-is not
adequate to a drama of such variations as the Elizabethans. Tragedy is
a crude classification for plays so different in their tone as
Macbeth, The Jew of Malta, and The Witch of Edmonton; and it does not
help us much to say that The Merchant of Venice and The Alchemist are
comedies. Jonson had his own scale, his own instrument. The merit
which Catiline possesses is the same merit that is exhibited more
triumphantly in Volpone; Catiline fails, not because it is

&lt;&lt;Lucius Sergius *CATILINE* , B.C. 64, conspired with a large number
of dissolute young nobles to plunder the Roman treasury, extirpate the
senate, and fire the capitol. Cicero, who was consul, got full
information of the plot, and delivered his first Oration against
*CATILINE* November 8th, 63, whereupon Catiline quitted Rome. Next day
Cicero delivered his second Oration, and several of the conspirators
were arrested. On December 4th Cicero made his third Oration,
respecting what punishment should be accorded to the conspirators. And
on December 5th, after his fourth Oration, sentence of death was
passed. Catiline tried to escape into Gaul, but, being intercepted, he
was slain fighting, B.C. 64.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;It occurs once in Antony and Cleopatra, when Enobarbus is inspired
to see Cleopatra in this dramatic light:
.
.    The barge she sat in...
.
Shakespeare made fun of Marston, and Jonson made fun of Kyd. But in
Marston's play the words were expressive of nothing; and Jonson was
criticizing the *FEEBLE* and conceited language, not the emotion, not
the &quot;oratory.&quot; Jonson is as oratorical himself, and the moments when
his oratory succeeds are, I believe, the moments that conform to our
formula. Notably the speech of Sylla's ghost in the induction to
*CATILINE* , and the speech of *ENVY* at the beginning of The
Poetaster. These two figures are contemplating their own dramatic
importance, and quite properly. But in the Senate speeches in
*CATILINE* , how tedious, how dusty! Here we are spectators not of a
play of characters, but of a play of forensic, exactly as if we had
been forced to attend the sitting itself. A speech in a play should
never appear to be intended to move us as it might conceivably move
other characters in the play, for it is essential that we should
preserve our position of spectators, and observe always from the
outside though with complete understanding. The scene in Julius Cæsar
is right because the object of our attention is not the speech of
Antony (Bedeutung) but the effect of his speech upon the mob, and
Antony's intention, his preparation and consciousness of the effect.
And in the rhetorical speeches from Shakespeare which have been cited,
we have this necessary advantage of a new clue to the character, in
noting the angle from which he views himself. But when a character in
a play makes a direct appeal to us, we are either the victims of our
own sentiment, or we are in the presence of a vicious rhetoric.&gt;&gt;
