I've been thinking lately that I am beginning to understand what it's
like to love cats.

I have this wish, this dream.  It may not be a realistic dream.  But I
wish this was a world where every kitty was happy, content, and loved.
I want to get into each cat's mind, read its every wish and hope, and
fulfill them.  I want to watch them chase butterflies and jump into
their hoomin's arms.

Kitties are capable of such incredible love and happiness.  When I
first brought Betty home, I thought she would start off a bit wary
being in a new environment.  But when she popped out of her carrier
and saw where she was, she was the happiest, trillingest, most excited
little cat I'd ever seen.

And when near the end, when her jaw was half gone and she would back
away from her food and come to me begging for something to eat that
didn't bite back, I felt sadder than I ever had.

So you really want them to be happy, all the time, don't you?

Yes. You may have guessed already, I am totally enthralled by my bunch and
can't believe my good fortune at having SEVEN wonderful kitties living with
me, adoring me and vice versa, and adoring each other as well. Each of them
is incredibly special in its own way. And every kitty that I meet, or see a
picture of, or hear about, is also special and enchanting and I want the
best for all of them. When I read about a sick or suffering kitty, I cry,
and when I see one crushed on a road, it tears my heart out.

I have the same wish, Tak. I wish, actually, all the animals that need
people, and they do need people, would have happy homes.

Oh, definitely. I feel so blessed to have these beautiful,
companionable animals in my life. They are so wonderful to come home
to, even though I know the first thoughts in their little heads is
"She's home! Time for dinner!"

I  could sit for hours stroking and admiring my two girls. Their
perfection is fascinating, and each cat is wonderful in their own
unique way.  I know I could not bear the thought of anyone being cruel
to them. And I want them to stay healthy and happy all their lives,
may they be long.

Tak, I hope you will find a new cat friend to love, and soon. May
Bastet send you a cat who needs you,    so that you have an outlet for
your loving heart.  I'm sure Betty would approve.

I know you loved Pollyanna, your whippets, and so many other
creatures.  I wasn't feeling sad primarily about Betty today, but
about so many other cats and other pets who need hoomins.  Betty
sensitized me to needy ones like herself.

I had just watched this video of a stray cat that someone apparently
momentarily let indoors.  It's so happy to have found a home for a few
minutes: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD7t0_uLEwo

Sometimes I think I should stop watching these. :)

Well, Tak, there is a furry owner waiting out there with your name

homes!

I remember the days I used to shoplift to make sure my Fritzie was well-fed,
stealing cat food to have cash for the vet appointments on hand. I never
wanted anything dire to happen to my little one, even when putting myself at
such risk. His happiness was my priority. And it is so with my five now.
Nothing makes me feel more appreciated and like I've done my part than when
one of my babies rolls over to show me a furry belly. Talk about trust and
contentment.

Blessed be,
Baha

and for the record, after thirty years not a day goes by that I don't think
of my first cat, second cat, third cat... and so on... but the love I share
with the current owners makes the love I shared with those at the bridge
even more precious,... and sending you a new owner is a real possibility, I
was convinced I did not want another cat when Miss Violette went to the
bridge... We still had 4 and it was Due to Violette that Harri and Toni got
different owners than us... less than 2 weeks later Miss Violette sent us
Stormmee and her energy then led us a few short months later to allow
Chester to adopt us... so not only did we get another but 2.... all because
of the love we shared with Violette, Lee

A kitty can tell that it's a very special can of food, filled with
love when the slave puts a finger to the lips and serves it while

I wrote something that's so easy to misconstrue. ;)

What I was thinking was that cats are such mysterious and subtle
creatures, but that the more you're around them, and the more you pay
attention to them, the better you understand them.  Since Betty was my
first cat, she taught me things in leaps and bounds, and I'm really
thankful to her for that.

I wanted to see and understand more, and I think that what I really
wanted was for us to share all the same thoughts.  I wanted to feel
her excitement and wonder at seeing a flock of birds in the yard.  And
I wanted her to feel my wonder at seeing a sunset.  I felt that we
were meant to be one being - not apart as one hoomin and one cat, but
one eternal hoomincat, together, inseperable, such that you couldn't
tell what part was hoomin, and what part was cat.

But instead of being together, we were torn apart, and it left my
education incomplete.  But when I see other cats, I can see that I've
still learned enough from Betty, and have enough of Betty left, that I
can feel what other kitties feel.  Still in an imperfect hoomin way,
but still enough that I wish all kitties were happier, safer, more
content.

2 is double the fun, and you can learn your place in the universe when you
watch them sharing kitty things, and you feel the awe and privilege of being
allowed to witness it, Lee

Most cats that aren't totally agressive or extremely shy get along.  By
older kittenhood they can normally work things out.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I know you loved Pollyanna, your whippets, and so many other
&gt; &gt;&gt; creatures.  I wasn't feeling sad primarily about Betty today, but
&gt; &gt;&gt; about so many other cats and other pets who need hoomins.  Betty
&gt; &gt;&gt; sensitized me to needy ones like herself./////

&gt; &gt;Well, Tak, there is a furry owner waiting out there with your name
&gt; &gt;stamped on their paw. It seems to me that Betty is starting to suggest
&gt; &gt;that you think about opening up your homw to a new owner....

&gt; &gt;You know you want to. ;) :) :)

&gt; I wrote something that's so easy to misconstrue. ;)

&gt; What I was thinking was that cats are such mysterious and subtle
&gt; creatures, but that the more you're around them, and the more you pay
&gt; attention to them, the better you understand them.  Since Betty was my
&gt; first cat, she taught me things in leaps and bounds, and I'm really
&gt; thankful to her for that.

&gt; I wanted to see and understand more, and I think that what I really
&gt; wanted was for us to share all the same thoughts.  I wanted to feel
&gt; her excitement and wonder at seeing a flock of birds in the yard.  And
&gt; I wanted her to feel my wonder at seeing a sunset.  I felt that we
&gt; were meant to be one being - not apart as one hoomin and one cat, but
&gt; one eternal hoomincat, together, inseperable, such that you couldn't
&gt; tell what part was hoomin, and what part was cat.
">

I don't think we ever get to share that. Pearl has this certain look that
she looks at me and it is sooooo deep and fathomless, and I just can't
figure out what she could possibly be thinking to look at me so deeply. It's
almost like soulgazing or something, only I don't get to see what is in
hers!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But instead of being together, we were torn apart, and it left my
&gt; education incomplete.  But when I see other cats, I can see that I've
&gt; still learned enough from Betty, and have enough of Betty left, that I
&gt; can feel what other kitties feel.  Still in an imperfect hoomin way,
&gt; but still enough that I wish all kitties were happier, safer, more
&gt; content.
">

The only way that can happen, Tak, is if good cat parent people go out and
bring them in ;)

Well, I admit a boy girl sibling match is best but mostly, it is the rare
exception that they don't grow up being at least ok with each other. Boy boy
matches are also usually really good. Now, there is a thought too Tak. The
boy cat experience is very different from the female one and they still need

Boy-boy sibs are usually OK, or two boy kittens-- they keep each other
busy.
But I've often thought that the reason that Stinky and Dante never got
along was that Dante was a boy-- and I think boys keep that
territoriality even if they are neutered.  And Dante never really
respected Stinky's territory-- he was kind of clueless about it as a
kitten, and now that he is a grownup (???) cat, he is still very
boisterous and disrespectful, except bigger. :0

So I think two boykittens together are a different deal from bringing
a new boycat onto an established boycat's territory.  I think I made a
mistake in that respect (although I don't regret having Dante), and I
think if I was doing it again, I would be more careful to get a girl
kitten.

Indeed! It's a slippery slope... :)

But if you're someone who might not want to (or simply can't) have a

having a multi-cat household is watching them interact with each other.
(Of course, I wish I'd handled the Smudge-Licky introduction more

But two cats who get along well and are close are just so sweet and
fun to watch.

A friend of mine once cautioned me against having more than one or two
cats, because the more cats you have, she reasoned, the less they interact
with the human, since they have each other. In other words, if the human
is the only show in town, the cat will gravitate to the human. But to me,
seeing my cats enjoying each other is as satisfying as having the cats
interact with me - and they do that, too.

and I'll add that even two cats that just tolerate each other are very good

I would agree with this from my experience.  I didn't expect a boycat in my

&gt;&gt;&gt; of like some folks, I guess.

&gt;&gt; Well, I admit a boy girl sibling match is best but mostly, it is the rare
&gt;&gt; exception that they don't grow up being at least ok with each other. Boy
&gt;&gt; boy
&gt;&gt; matches are also usually really good. Now, there is a thought too Tak. The
&gt;&gt; boy cat experience is very different from the female one and they still
&gt;&gt; need
&gt;&gt; love and a home.....

&gt;I would agree with this from my experience.  I didn't expect a boycat in my
&gt;life, but Boyfriend appeared.  I didn't want him, to be truthful.
&gt;He is WONDERFUL and AMAZING.
&gt;Don't discount a boycat when you feel able to look for another feline
&gt;companion, Tak.

I have to second Christina-- I lerve my boycats, and I never had a
boycat before Stinky.  I had my little girl Mimi for so long, I
couldn't imagine a boycat.  Although Stinky may have his problems with
Dante, he has been the most loving cat I have ever encountered, beyond
my wildest expectations.  My Mimi was special in a very different
way-- she had an incredible personality and was my precious little
shrimpboat. ;)  Stinky seems like he is just full of lerve, like he's
just busting with a wonderful, sweet nature.  A friend once observed
"He glows with amiability."

I think they are all individuals.

True! Just keep adding them until you find the right number. =o)

Two is enough to give the cats company when you must leave them for a

Two is manageable in terms of food, litter and veterinary needs for

I've been tempted to adopt a shy neighbor kitty, a sort of blue gray-
Siamese with incedible blue eyes.  This cat is very sweet and friendly
and obviously used to people, so I'm not sure if he/she has a human,
or not.

I was very glad to have my girls when Pan crossed the Rainbow Bridge
last spring.  But  they and I manage very well as a household of three
girls.

I think Cat lovers need a MINIMUM of two cats. Any more they want to
add on after that is  great, too.  =o)

Tak, if you adopt two cats at once, they'll each be getting used to
the other at the same time they're getting used to you, which will
hopefully cut down on territorial fighting.  Even though I have a
mother-daughter pair, they're not  conjoined at the hip. They have
their cuddles and their battles and their sessions of mutual grooming
and play.  It's a pleasure to watch them at it. And it's nice to see
each cat's distinctive personality bloom. =o)

One more thing about the video: in spite of the tails they don't look
seriously angry. Both have their ears forward, not back, and there's no
hissing. I think Sugar definitely looks like she wants to play. That's
how the wrestling matches start around here, too. And I don't think
there can be any doubt that Mir and Cali lerve each other. :)(Note to

The boycats I've known have usually been friendly, groom-y types.  I
remember when I visited the shelter when I adopted Betty, I was
considering taking one of three cats.

One was a ham of a 1 year old orange boy cat.  Another was a gray
ultra-purry 2 year old girl cat of extreme clinginess.  The third was
3 year old tuxedo girl cat who was sad and quiet, and gave headbutts
in exchange for scritches:

YOU DID NOT KILL HER BODY!!!, you let her body go, and her spirit will
always live on, in your heart, in your head and in the greatness of the
universe, love is eternal...  Getting another kitty doesn't mean any
disrespect to Betty, what it means is that she taught you well enough for
you to share another part of your heart with another of her kind... having
another companion in no way disrespects what you shared with Betty, it gives
it the honor of your realization that there are many who are loved and many
who need love and many who will love in return if they are only given the
chance... If you never get another kitty it would mean that you are never
going to share all that you learned from Betty, Lee, who understands the
pain... several times over...

It is hilarious to watch them now. Pearl looks at Sugar and Sugar puts her
ears back (and remember she is usually at least 5 feet away) and
cack-cack-cacks in warning. And yet, she likes to be chased. There is one
rule for BOTH of them. "No touching".  If both adhere to that, they both
seem amenable, even happy to have Pearl stalk and terrorize Sugar. It's the
funniest thing. In fact, last night, Pearl was behind a big pillow bolster
on the floor. Earlier she had been "evil gazing" on Sugar, but then she
found this spot and settled in. Well, even though Sugar HAD been acting
annoyed by Evil Gazing, now she couldn't stand that it wasn't followed up
on. SHe went over and sat on the other side of the bolster (Pearl didn't
even know she was there) and cocked her head looking full of expectancy. It
was hilarious. Pearl never did "come get her" much to Sugar's
disappointment.

Yeah, its very funny. They BOTH have to be in the mood at the same time
though. And they only play "Chase Sugar". Chase Pearl is a no no and

Wait, why does that mean you kill her spirit? Spirit just doesn't work that
way. Spirit is always in you/with you. It's in your memories, but also even
tangible at times. I don't think there IS anything you can do to kill
spirit, not unless maybe you want to. Even then, I don't think you would be
able to will it. That would mean undoing the past and making it not exist.

The only time I saw Otis get pushed around was by a spunky little black
female kitten that we considered adopting briefly.  She swiped his nose and
had him cowed from the get go.  We returned her the same night to the person
who had found her and she was almost instantly adopted to another home.  In
my experience, girl cats can be real prima donas and really territorial.
Boy cats have seemed less complicated to me and I've seen lots of dual boy
households.

As usual though, its purrsonality dictated and you all know how we held
Chester up to the "single cat only" cats at the shelter and watched him yawn
unconcernedly when they hissed at him.  He was the perfect match for Otis!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ah, kitty interactions!  It's true that that's something that I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; haven't seen.  But it would be difficult to predict whether a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; particular pair of cats would get along.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Oh now you are really out there. You get siblings.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, that doesn't always work. My good friend has two kitty
&gt;&gt;&gt; sisters
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who are always at each others' throat and who never hang out together.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Kind
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of like some folks, I guess.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, I admit a boy girl sibling match is best but mostly, it is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; rare
&gt;&gt;&gt; exception that they don't grow up being at least ok with each other. Boy
&gt;&gt;&gt; boy
&gt;&gt;&gt; matches are also usually really good. Now, there is a thought too Tak.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The
&gt;&gt;&gt; boy cat experience is very different from the female one and they still
&gt;&gt;&gt; need
&gt;&gt;&gt; love and a home.....

&gt;&gt;I would agree with this from my experience.  I didn't expect a boycat in
&gt;&gt;my
&gt;&gt;life, but Boyfriend appeared.  I didn't want him, to be truthful.
&gt;&gt;He is WONDERFUL and AMAZING.
&gt;&gt;Don't discount a boycat when you feel able to look for another feline
&gt;&gt;companion, Tak.

&gt; I have to second Christina-- I lerve my boycats, and I never had a
&gt; boycat before Stinky.  I had my little girl Mimi for so long, I
&gt; couldn't imagine a boycat.  Although Stinky may have his problems with
&gt; Dante, he has been the most loving cat I have ever encountered, beyond
&gt; my wildest expectations.  My Mimi was special in a very different
&gt; way-- she had an incredible personality and was my precious little
&gt; shrimpboat. ;)  Stinky seems like he is just full of lerve, like he's
&gt; just busting with a wonderful, sweet nature.  A friend once observed
&gt; &quot;He glows with amiability.&quot;

I guess Kitty put me off cats a bit as she is so grumpy and always has been.
Initially, both Boyfriend and myself didn't trust each other.
I expected he would bite/scratch me, he expected I would ill treat him.

He doesn't have a bite or scratch in him.  He's like Stinky.  Full of love,
shy love though, only for me.  Some of my friends think he is an imaginary
cat as the moment they come in the house he disappears outside.
No-one will ever see him curled on my lap when everywhere is quiet, purring
his tiny purr and stretching his leg out so his paw can gently touch my
face.

and it is things like this that require me to continue to be open to the
hurt of losing one of them, Lee
