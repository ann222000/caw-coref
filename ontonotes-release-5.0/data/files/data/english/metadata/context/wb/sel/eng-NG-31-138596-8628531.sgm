Oga Ojo,

I can see the trend in your argument, I find it difficult to support because two wrongs do not make a right. What if those Nigerians, the Police Chief and Prison boss in Oyo state were actually born and bred in Oke Mapo? What if the senior and qualified Oyo Men or Women in the Police Force or Prison Services were born and brought up in Kano or Port Harcourt ? Ethnicity, though, currently downplayed, has remained an issue in sociopolitical (under)development of Nigeria . It determines who we MUST vote for to be our elected President. Remember how the options of the electorate were reduce to an Obasanjo or Olu Falae in 1999, Obasanjo or OBJ in 2003, and between a Yar'Adua, a Atiku and a Buhari in 2007. All other key posts are also determined by ethnicity of people. An Obasanjo's president will only attract an Atiku Vice President, A Ghali Na'Abba Speaker, and apparently an Ibo Senate President. One is not surprised that a Yar'Adua presidency also
produced an Etteh Speaker in the House of Representatives. It is also a key factor for the appointment of Permanent Secretary, SGF, et al. People sometimes want to know the ethnic groups to which players from the national teams are from; if in there view, it tilts to the west, east, south or north, they become interested in knowing the parent of the coach. If it is a foreign coach, then, the tribe he mingles win become important. It is such an appalling thing since we are infected with it once we are born by particular parents irrespective of location of our birth. It is always head: we lose, Tail: they win.

What gives the impression that a Mr. 'Yorubanimi' or a Mrs. 'Emikise Ajoji' would have protected those Nigerians killed in my own view, by over-zealous government authorities? I am particularly happy that National Human Rights Commission and other stakeholders have stepped in to investigate the endo-massacre committed on Nigerians who are merely suspects and incarcerated endless because of courts, and other government departments are on strike in Oyo state.

I suggest this case should be thoroughly investigated by concerned and independent civil society groups, and anyone found guilt of derelict of duty or any other form of 'penkelemese' should be made to face the music. Life is so precious that it is unacceptable to waste life of people simply because the authorities assume that they are 'nobody'. These kind of absurd massacre could not have happened to ex-governors who were incarcerated as suspects for corrupt practices, but, Nigerians who did not have 'long legs' were mowed down by Nigeria state. It is a national shame.

You do have it wrong - You are actually employing a colonial tactic of the British to divide and conquer based on arbitrary and static delineations of ethnicity.  Nigeria is a multi-ethnic nation, not a confederation of ethnic enclaves.  Leadership and national and state resources do matter, so rather than attacking a person's ethnicity, one should look at the person's effectiveness as a leader, the resources he/she has access to, and what he/she has accomplished with those resources to improve the conditions and safety of the prison system.

Thank you,

I will here again ask the same question that has earned me the undeserved title of &quot;ethnic bigot&quot; from some quarters:

What does a &quot;Mrs. Maureen Omeili&quot;, a none indigene Yoruba who has no discernible ties to Ibadan or Oyo State or to any Yoruba state have, to be &quot;the Comptroller of Prison, Oyo State&quot; - a Yoruba State ?

Or a &quot;Prince Udom Ekpoudom&quot; being the &quot;the Oyo State Police Commissioner,&quot; what amounts really to something akin to &quot;foreign occupation&quot; as in the times of the colonial overlords?

Now, don't get wrong please. Neither the Yoruba nor the Hausa nor the Ndiigbo (nor any other ethnic group) should have any business or rights policing outside their ethnic enclaves either, if one truly wants security and commitment to service in these branches of governance.

As far as practicable, Nigerians should be allowed and encouraged to do the policing, and be responsible for judicial and legal services, law and order, including prisons and prison warders, within their own ethnic enclaves, if the Nigeria Police. The Nigerian Judicial Services, and the Nigerian Prison Services are to be reformed and made responsive to the needs of the communities they are supposed to serve.

You as well transfer teachers and make them teach children whose languages they do not speak, and whose cultural backgrounds they know nothing about.

The entire structure can then be set up to be monitored by a central federal service to ensure effective functioning.

This business of asking &quot;foreigners&quot; to police and &quot;imprison&quot; people to whom they are not related or affiliated in any way is pure simple, occupation by foreigners under another guise, foreigners who have no iota of sympathy for their &quot;victims&quot;. It served the needs of our colonizers very well, but has proven a disaster and a calamity for our continued peaceful co-existence as a nation of diverse cultural, ethnic, linguistic and religious entities.

Agodi Prison Horror!: How warders attacked journalist - Loses cellphone, money, car key
Thur. 13th Sept. 2007

Mr. Tope Abiola
Men and officials of the Nigeria Prison Service and Nigeria Police recently attacked a journalist who was on an official assignment at the Agodi Prison for allegedly trying to expose the killing of some prison inmates. Adebayo Waheed reports:
Ibadan has constantly been in the news. Only that on Tuesday, 11 September, attention shifted to the Agodi Prisons in the heart of the city. Sporadic gunshots were heard in the neighbourhood while there was a stampede.
As early as 8 a.m. on the fateful day, officers and men of the Nigeria Police had stormed the prison with a view to assisting their prisons counterparts avert an alleged jail break by some inmates who were said to be protesting against the poor medicare and feeding in the prison, but they ended up disrupting business activities at the popular Gate area of the state capital just as some of the warders descended heavily on an Assistant Editor with the Nigerian Tribune, Mr. Tope Abiola and his colleagues who were trying to save him from the hands of the trigger-happy and power-drunk prison operatives.
The operatives were trying to prevent men of the pen from accessing information on what actually led to the death of the inmates in the custody of the Nigeria Prisons Service in Ibadan . It was when they were doing this that they descended on Mr. Abiola who was trying to perform his statutory responsibility. He was given the beating of his life.
It is a miracle that Mr. Abiola was able to escape from the prison warders. Their intention was not only to beat him but kill him because they felt he had taken the pictures of some inmates killed. This, they must have thought, would not only expose their shoddy care of the inmates to the whole world but would put the Nigeria Prisons Services in ridicule as people would want to know why they decided to kill the inmates who were defenceless but protesting poor feeding and medicare.
Mr. Abiola, while narrating his ordeal at the hands of these power-drunk warders, said he had gone to the Agodi Prison like every other journalist for an official assignment but on getting there, the Comptroller of Prison, Oyo State, Mrs. Maureen Omeili did not allow journalists to get close to the prison gate as she said 'it is not a media affair, it is a private matter.'
According to Mr. Abiola, journalists who were there were of the opinion that an alleged attempted jailbreak could not be a private matter. &quot;They were trying to prevent us from seeing how the lifeless bodies of the inmates were being thrown into an NPS lorry, so they sent us away. &quot;We moved away as the warders did not allow us to take pictures of the event while cameramen of the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) and Galaxy TV were asked to turn down their cameras while the corpses were being thrown into the lorry. Before we lost count, we had counted 102 corpses as they were being thrown into the lorry&quot;, he said.
He narrated further that trouble started when the Oyo State Police Commissioner, Prince Udom Ekpoudom arrived the premises of the prisons and journalists saw that as an opportunity to follow the police boss inside. &quot;Though he (Commissioner) directed that journalists should be allowed to enter, the warders and mobile policemen stopped them from performing their statutory responsibility. Immediately the CP entered, they closed the door and when we told them he had said we should follow him, they responded by saying that the Comptroller had directed that only FRCN and NTA should be allowed in.
&quot;I told them that other media houses could also help them but they said we would only

THE AFRICAN AND THE ETHNICITY DILEMMA

Members of the USAAfricaDialogue@googlegroups.com who may have been
following this Thread:

I promised a further rejoinder to my last deposition before this forum, in
the hope of being able to state my position (thesis, if you chose to dignify
it with such a heavy word) in this matter as clearly as humanly possible. I
also hope to use this opportunity to make some other salient observations
about how we African “intellectuals” go about confronting and debating
issues that may lie close to our hearts – as much as we may wish to deny
that fact, for reasons which I will endeavor to speculate on. And on the
dilemma of Africans in general in regards to our ethnic identities

I therefore crave your indulgence, and ask that you take the time to read
and digest what I am about to present here with as much intellectual
open-mindedness as you can muster and as dispassionately as you possibly
can. And then please come to your own conclusions. I am not out to convince
anyone about anything – I am not on a mission, and I am not selling
anything.

I am merely sharing my views on a matter of personal concern and interest to
me that I have followed and observed for some time, and about which I have
ruminated and thought deeply over time. The Agodi Massacre was merely a
trigger to re-express some views which I have already had occasions to
express elsewhere, for example the idea of introducing local policing in
Nigeria as a means of reducing corruption in the police, and curbing crime
in the society, especially the scourge of armed robbery. And I will
presently come back to that in due course.

When Professor Toyin Falola added my name to this forum,
USAAfricaDialogue@googlegroups.com, I saw it as an opportunity to rub minds
informally with colleagues at an elevated level of discourse, but without
the formal constraints of journal articles or conference papers – like
holding a debate on issues among peers.

After participating for some time, I came to the realization that we
so-called “African intellectuals” have a rather peculiar and discomfiting
way and manner of conducting discussions and exchanging views on issues
about which we may hold radically different views. I often do not know what
my reaction should be – to laugh out loud, or to shake my head in sadness
and commensuration at how some of us reason.

We all too frequently either get outright irritated and often times
downright abusive or we start playing heartstring music on what I have
termed our emotional talking drums, tam-tams and gojes.

Example:

“It is truly sad that somebody as educated as Dr.Valentine Ojo would
essential culture in such a dangerous way.” - Abubakar Momoh

“…somebody as educated as Dr.Valentine Ojo would essential culture in such a
dangerous way”, what precisely does that mean?  What is the meaning of
“would essential culture in such a dangerous way?” How does one “essential
culture”?

Or is it that somebody as educated as Dr. Ojo should not dare to suggest
that Nigeria should think of abolishing the colonial legacy and inheritance
of using the police to “keep the natives in line”, now elevated to the fine
art of those in power using the police to “terrorize their own local
populations” by considering introducing “community policing”, if what we
wish to maintain is truly “law and order” – as is the standard practice in
most civilized nations, including the United States and even Britain, from
whom we inherited our “police force” – an erstwhile instrument of colonial
coercion which is yet to lose its predilection for coercion?

I know of no single civilized country in the world that moves police
officers and police units indiscriminately from one part of the country to
another or from one town, municipality or local government area to another.

I stand corrected.

Then another commentator came out to demand that:

“This forum has to decide for its own interest, and for the integrity of
contributors, whether intolerant demagoues pretending to be intellectuals
should be allowed to have their way unchecked.

I think the editors of this forum should be on the watch out.” -Tokunbo
Ayoola”

The same Ayoola Tokunbo had no qualms coming out on this same forum to
denounce President Robert Mugabe of muzzling the press and silencing the
opposition – a patently false allegation.

What then is Ayoola Tokunbo demanding here; if not the same sin she is
accusing Robert Mugabe of - “muzzling the press and silencing the
opposition”?

And as to what makes me out to be one of those “intolerant demagoues
pretending to be intellectuals”, Ms Ayoola does not give a single clue.
Besides, those comments come very close to being an outright insult, but for
the fact that no name was mentioned.

The “forum has to decide for its own interest, and for the integrity of
contributors, whether intolerant demagoues pretending to be intellectuals
should be allowed to have their way unchecked.”

Read: Ban them from the forum! And yet we lament that African nations are
ruled by despots and dictators!

Then another contributor proclaims:

“Kayode and Ojo,

You are only dragging us back for no good reason except that its hard for
you to appreciate and leverage the diversity in Nigeria.”

“Dragging us back” from where to where? How do you “appreciate and leverage
the diversity in Nigeria,” when you refuse to recognize that there is any
“diversity in Nigeria?”

We are saying: “My fellow Nigerians/Africans, you all must forget that you
are Akan, Hausa, Ijaw, Igbo, Fante, Ogoni, Yoruba, Zulu!” Is this then the
way to “appreciate and leverage the diversity” – the same “diversity” you
are busily telling the same people to forget about?

Allow me to pursue further the “arguments” of Zacharys Gundu. Gundu
hypothesizes that “the prisoners in Ibadan are not only people of Yoruba
extraction”. Maybe, maybe not. But that’s not very relevant here.

Like another contributor, Kayode Adenaiya, succinctly pointed out, “if
someone from that area would have been in charge he or she would have
managed it such that things like that would be avoided and if it happens the
people of that area will be able to hold him accountable without the fear of
been tagged ethnic bigots.”

I could not have put it any better.

And a contributor full of faith and optimism in the Nigerian system has this
to say “I suggest this case should be thoroughly investigated by concerned
and independent civil society groups, and anyone found guilt of derelict of
duty or any other form of 'penkelemese' should be made to face the music.”

How many “” in the brutal and senseless killing of the Apo Six, unarmed
people of Igbo extraction, by a patrol of power-drunk Hausa police officers
in Abuja, the nation’s capital, have since been “found guilty of derelict of
duty or any other form of 'penkelemese' [and have been] made to face the
music” to date?

How many people have been “found guilty of derelict of duty or any other
form of 'penkelemese' [have been] made to face the music” in the callous
murder of a former attorney general of the federation, Late Bola Ige?

Gundu argues further that “moreover, the prison is a federal facility and it
will be very silly to insist that those who are looking after the facility
must be yoruba people from Ibadan.” (I wonder why Gundu chose to write
“yoruba” in lower case. Is that intended to be a slight on the Yoruba? What
does that portray about respect for another ethnic group other than yours?)

The question Gundu has failed to ask is this: why should the prison be a
federal property? In the United States, most prisons, just like the various
police units, are run by the county or the state in which they are located.

Even Nigeria at one time (up to the late 60’s I believe) used to have local
government and regional police, recruited usually from among the local
indigenes, and then the NPF. Why were the local government and the state
police formations banned by the army, if not for reason of being able to
maintain a central stranglehold on the populace? To more effectively be able
to deploy and use the police to control the populace? This present
horrendous practice was introduced during Nigeria’s brutal and exploitative
military rule.

Why is it that police continues to be housed in barracks – to further
alienate them from the general populace – than residing among the general
populace like is the practice in all civilized nations?

Gundu continued:

“What point are you really making besides druming up useless sentiments that
are not related to the problem at hand?”

What then are “useless sentiments”? Your identifying with your “ethnicity”
is a useless sentiment? What is your “nationality” built on then – if not
first and foremost on your ethnicity, especially in a country like Nigeria?
You are first and foremost a Nigerian if and when you belong to one of the
ethnic groups located within the borders of what we call Nigeria.

Thus, if you refuse to acknowledge your ‘ethnicity’, how do you wish to
acknowledge your ‘nationality” which in Nigeria based primarily on your
ethnicity?

Let me make this real simple, using myself as an example:

I am born into a family in Ondo which makes me a Yoruba. The Ondo are part
of the Yoruba group located in Nigeria (the Togo and Benin Yoruba do not
count as Nigerians, right?) By virtue of Nigeria being in Africa, I am seen,
and I see myself as an African.

Thus I am all of this, one predicated on the other: I am from the Ojo family
in Ondo which is in the Yoruba area of Nigeria which is on the continent
named Africa. Now, at what level do I now begin to acknowledge my being, at
what level do I begin to deny and shy away

Dr Ojo,
One must thank you for clarifying aspects of your
thesis, even though the clarification throws you up as
one that is a little bit confused and unable to
communicate the meat of his arguement. Before I go
further, I want to agree with you that we must never
seek to throw away our ethnic identities inorder to
fit into the Nigerian project, its not necessary and
may not even work. Because of this, I have no problem
when people acknowledge their ethnicity. When you also
argue here and elsewhere in a direct reply to Nomshan
that our federal structure is distorted, I agree with
you without reservations. This is how far my agreement
with you goes. When Kayode says 'If someone from the
area would have been in charge he or she would have
managed it such that things like that would be avoided
and if it happens, the people of that area will be
able to hold him accountable without the fear of been
tagged ethnic biggot' and you chorus that 'I could not
have put it any better', your chorus raises a few
questions. One, Is it only your ethnic person that you
can hold accountable? Two, If an Ife person were to
hold a Modakeke person accountable at a prison
facility in Ife, will he escape the tag of a biggot?.
Three, To what extent will an Ijebu man who risks
holding an Egba man accountable, escape the charge of
been a biggot?.
You find it cruel that 'power drunk' Hausa officers
killed some Ibo people in Abuja and are totally
oblivious of the fact that 'power drunk' other people
(officers)including Yoruba officers have also killed
other people in Lagos and other parts of the country.
The point you do not seem to acknowledge is that we
have constructed a system in Nigeria that is making it
possible for just anybody from any group(big or small)
who has an opportunity, to damage our collective
interests. In my opinion, we disempower ourselves (and
our groups) from facing the challenges in Nigera if we
are coming across as pure victims who are not part of
the problem.
You ask why prisons must be  Federal facility? I may
not be able to satisfy you here but can say that in
the present, this is the reality in Nigeria. I do not
have problems rethinking this reality, but those with
a little sense of history will remember how some of
these facilities and institutions were abused and used
against the people in the first republic. This sense
of history tells me that if today we have a problem
with a federal facility/institution, turning it over
to some state or local government will not necessarily
be a solution. It will be naive to seek a solution in
such simplistic terms. To the best of my knowledge,
education in Nigeria is still under the concurrent
list, yet when you go to the West and the East which
according to you have more progressive values, the
decay in the school system is as much as you find in
the North. I lived in Lagos until recently (at
Mafoluku- Oshodi) this place had no portable water
just as many many parts of Lagos,yet the provision of
water in Lagos is not the responsibility of the
Federal Government. Lagos is still one of the dirtiest
towns in the world, yet refuse management there is not
the responsibility of the Federal Government. What
does this tell me? It tells me that most of the
challenges we are dealing with in Nigeria cannot be
properly handled if our perspective is ehnic without
more.
This leads me to another issue. What does it mean to
be detrabilized?  Certainly it does not mean denying
that you are Ojo from Ondo State or that I am Zacharys
from Benue State. Nor does it mean denying you are
Yoruba or denying that I am Tiv. What I think it means
is to pause and consider our challenges in a multi
ethnic Nigeria and the options for dealing with those
challenges from a perspective distinct but additional
to our ethnic eyes. Class can be an alternative and
additional  perspective. We can also seek to review
the way we look at the citizenship question in Nigeria
to enrich our perspective. What really am I asking?. I
am not asking that we throw away our ethnic
identities, what I am asking we do is to enlarge our
identities and read the challenges in Nigeria in such
a way that each and every one of us, each and every
group, big and small are part of the problem instead
of victims of the cruelty of the person or group next
door.
I had one of the greatest insights into the Nigerian
project when I entered an innocent conversation with a
brilliant Professor of History in one of the American
Universities a few days ago. The Professor humbly told
me that Nigeria is what it is today because contrary
to good practice, the country is been run by oil
rather than taxes. No one including those clamouring
for resource control nor those thieving government
officials, politicians and States  waiting for the
month to end in order to get their allocations are
working for the oil to keep flowing. No person is
accountable. The legislator, governor , president is
unaccountable. He is not paid strictly speaking by the
tax payer and no person can begin to hold him
accountable because the basis is not there. I am of
the opinion that we must restructure the Nigerian
Project. There are also windows for restructuring
which have remained closed because we are really not
looking at what is possible even in the context of our
limitations. States can still do a lot. They can
redefine citizenship within their borders. They can
run increasingly on taxes and take the oil revenues as
bonus. They can be more accountable in terms of the
structures they retouch. More importantly, any State,
big or small, rich or poor can just start taking these
simple steps and before long others may catch up.
This is may stake.
Zacharys.

Zacharys Gundu:

You started off what could have been a reasonable response with these
comments: &quot;... even though the clarification throws you up as one that is a
little bit confused and unable to communicate the meat of his arguement.&quot;

And what or who gives you the impression that you are &quot;one that is [NOT] a
little bit confused and [ABLE] to communicate the meat of his argument?&quot;

Who decides that? What part of my argument are you confused about, and what
&quot;meat&quot; have I not communicated adequately?

These sly and underhanded ad hominem INSULTS are uncalled for in
intellectual discussions. That was one of the things I criticized about how
Africans, especially Nigerian &quot;intellectuals&quot;, are wont to discuss issues.
This verges on outright rudeness.

Was this per chance how you addressed your &quot;brilliant Professor of History
in one of the American Universities?&quot; Why me then?

Moving on...to your questions:

1. &quot;Is it only your ethnic person that you can hold accountable?&quot;

As things still stand today in Nigeria, sadly, yes. You cannot find recourse
with the so-called &quot;federal&quot; authorities. That's why, rather than wait for
the &quot;electoral tribunals&quot;, when the Army and Police and the courts are
actively involved in rigging elections, whom do you turn to? The Federal
authorities are still to solve any of the high profile murders that occurred
in Nigeria, or the well-advertised killings of unarmed civilians by the
Federal Police - the Apo 6 being one of the most known and documented
instances.

2. &quot;If an Ife person were to hold a Modakeke person accountable at a prison
facility in Ife, will he escape the tag of a biggot?&quot;

I worked in Ife for more than a decade, and I resided most of that time in
the Modakeke section, at the Sijuwade Estate, an off-campus official
residence for OAU staffers. And I lived through two riots there.

First off, the Ife-Modakeke dispute/conflict is more economic than
socio-political, and curiously enough, it only flares up, when some
ambitious wannabe politicians on either side fans up the embers of this
ordinarily dormant conflict to serve his own political ambition.

Ordinarily, the reality is that virtually every Ife family is inter-married
with some Modakeke family, almost without any exceptions. There are no
discernible boundaries between Modakkeke and Ile-Ife, and in reality,
Modakeke is actually one of the wards in Ile-Ife, albeit a rather large one.

But whenever politics is introduced, it is always possible to find an
&quot;outside political patron&quot; to bank-roll the riots. This is no place to go
into the details of what I know about these conflicts, having lived through
two of them. My house on the Sijuwade Estate was even burnt down, and my
personal properties totally destroyed, including two cars, a Passat and a
Peugeot 505 sedan, during one of these riots.

3. &quot;...education in Nigeria is still under the concurrent list, yet when you
go to the West and the East which according to you have more progressive
values, the decay in the school system is as much as you find in the North.&quot;

The regions (states) no longer control education as such - these are based
largely on federal allocations which are frequently embezzled. More to that
below.

4. &quot;I lived in Lagos until recently (at Mafoluku- Oshodi) this place had no
portable water just as many many parts of Lagos,yet the provision of water
in Lagos is not the responsibility of the Federal Government. Lagos is still
one of the dirtiest towns in the world, yet refuse management there is not
the responsibility of the Federal Government. What does this tell me?&quot;

Again, like the case with Ife-Modakeke, the moment the actual control is no
longer in the hands of the local populace like in the old Western region,
but in the hands of some umbrella political godfathers resident outside the
state, the governor can do pretty much what he pleases - as long as he has
the blessings and support of his political godfathers. This was what
happened with the likes of Andy Uba in Anambra, and virtually all the PDP
governors. Under the PDP umbrella, they can do and undo as they pretty much
please; they are NOT accountable to the people, but only to their political
party structures.

4. &quot;I had one of the greatest insights into the Nigerian project when I
entered an innocent conversation with a brilliant Professor of History in
one of the American Universities a few days ago. The Professor humbly told
me that Nigeria is what it is today because contrary to good practice, the
country is been run by oil rather than taxes. No one including those
clamouring for resource control nor those thieving government officials,
politicians and States  waiting for the month to end in order to get their
allocations are working for the oil to keep flowing. No person is
accountable. The legislator, governor , president is unaccountable. He is
not paid strictly speaking by the tax payer and no person can begin to hold
him accountable because the basis is not there.&quot;

This is a no brainier. You did not need have talked to any &quot;brilliant
Professor of History in one of the American Universities;&quot; you could have
easily asked me. I have even lectured to various audiences on this theme.
The things that happened in the old West and in the old East, especially in
the areas of education and provision of some essential infrastructures that
worked were possible because the revenues for them came largely from the
local farmers and businesses in these regions, where the public officials
were held accountable. If the cocoa and palm oil and timbers and groundnuts
were not produced, harvested and marketed efficiently, there would be no
revenues to run the government. Simple logic!

This was how Awolowo and his team were able to establish the Cocoa House,
the Ikeja Industrial Complex, Bodija Estae, WNBS, the Araromi Obu Rubber
Plantation, and provide free education and health services. I repeat: the
people held them accountable for the revenues they collected from the
people, and for which the people were willing to riot and protest, and even
die if need be. It was pretty much the same in the East. In the North, the
populace having different cultural values had less control on what their
Emirs and Sultans did with state revenues.

That was the explanation for the educational differential.

Today, however, things have changed radically. Like your &quot;brilliant American
professor of history at one of the American universities&quot; rightly informed
you, &quot;the country is been run by oil rather than taxes. No one including
those clamouring for resource control nor those thieving government
officials, politicians and States  waiting for the month to end in order to
get their allocations are working for the oil to keep flowing. No person is
accountable. The legislator, governor, president is unaccountable. He is not
paid strictly speaking by the tax payer and no person can begin to hold him
accountable because the basis is not there.&quot;

That is why Lagos has become the dirtiest metropolis in the world, and in
short, why ALL Nigerian infrastructures have broken down, and Nigerian roads
become impassable. Those in charge are not accountable to anyone, but to
their own pockets.

Did you not read the article that I posted recently, where one governor had
to confess that they are under pressure to steal? You give a few people
unlimited access to such huge amounts of money, and an army and police
trained primarily to guard and protect these thieves, and you wonder that
they are all &quot;off da hook&quot; - like Americans are wont to say.

Who should hold them accountable then? Who dares? Accountable to whom?
Accountable for what? For monies they did not collect from you? The
well-paid senior military and police officers and judges who are actually
protecting their own interests as well and the well-paid prison comptrollers
ready to receive trouble makers?

&quot;States can still do a lot. They can redefine citizenship within their
borders. They can run increasingly on taxes and take the oil revenues as
bonus. They can be more accountable in terms of the structures they retouch.
More importantly, any State, big or small, rich or poor can just start
taking these simple steps and before long others may catch up.&quot;

Laudable and idealistic benchmarks indeed! But who are the &quot;they&quot; that you
are referring to that will set these wonderful objectives in motion?

I will wait until you return to Benue to kick it off, and you can invite me
to come and deliver an inaugural lecture there then - gratis, just my flight
ticket to Nigeria, and one or two nights' accommodation, even in your
official Boys' Quarters.

I think the attack on Dr. Ojo's position misses the point he tried to make.
While it does not logically follow that a Yoruba or Igbo official cannot be
cruel his own (ethnic) kind, there is a commonsensical limit to cruelty,
within a shared value culture and language.  The only such shared culture
and value within the Nigerian federal service to date is (debased) pidgin
culture, which at any rate, devalues and slowly strangles the development of
Nigerian indigenous cultures.

The only thing that allowed the Yeltsin coup succeed againstGorbachev and
the soldiers sent to apprehend him balk at the performance of their
professional duties was the mutually shared culture of soldiers and
principles of democracy, whereas, the &quot;godogodos&quot; in Nigeria did not bat an
eyelid in going to arrest the winner of a democratic election,(Abiola)
because the victim was in the eyes of the tresonable arresters outside the
enclave of the giver of the order, so that the higher ideal of democratic
values is truncated beneath the background of the giver of the order.  The
notion of federal nation (American style) that Nigeria aspires to is not
feasible within the purview of its present geo- ethnic configuration; at
best it could make do the European Union type of non-national confederal
federation, in view of similar multinational multi-tongued, multicultural
ethos.

&gt;Oga Ojo,

&gt;I can see the trend in your argument, I find it difficult to support
&gt;because two wrongs do not make a right. What if those Nigerians, the Police
&gt;Chief and Prison boss in Oyo state were actually born and bred in Oke Mapo?
&gt;What if the senior and qualified Oyo Men or Women in the Police Force or
&gt;Prison Services were born and brought up in Kano or Port Harcourt ?
&gt;Ethnicity, though, currently downplayed, has remained an issue in
&gt;sociopolitical (under)development of Nigeria . It determines who we MUST
&gt;vote for to be our elected President. Remember how the options of the
&gt;electorate were reduce to an Obasanjo or Olu Falae in 1999, Obasanjo or OBJ
&gt;in 2003, and between a Yar'Adua, a Atiku and a Buhari in 2007. All other
&gt;key posts are also determined by ethnicity of people. An Obasanjo's
&gt;president will only attract an Atiku Vice President, A Ghali Na'Abba
&gt;Speaker, and apparently an Ibo Senate President. One is not surprised that
&gt;a Yar'Adua presidency also
&gt;  produced an Etteh Speaker in the House of Representatives. It is also a
&gt;key factor for the appointment of Permanent Secretary, SGF, et al. People
&gt;sometimes want to know the ethnic groups to which players from the national
&gt;teams are from; if in there view, it tilts to the west, east, south or
&gt;north, they become interested in knowing the parent of the coach. If it is
&gt;a foreign coach, then, the tribe he mingles win become important. It is
&gt;such an appalling thing since we are infected with it once we are born by
&gt;particular parents irrespective of location of our birth. It is always
&gt;head: we lose, Tail: they win.

&gt;What gives the impression that a Mr. 'Yorubanimi' or a Mrs. 'Emikise Ajoji'
&gt;would have protected those Nigerians killed in my own view, by over-zealous
&gt;government authorities? I am particularly happy that National Human Rights
&gt;Commission and other stakeholders have stepped in to investigate the
&gt;endo-massacre committed on Nigerians who are merely suspects and
&gt;incarcerated endless because of courts, and other government departments
&gt;are on strike in Oyo state.

&gt;I suggest this case should be thoroughly investigated by concerned and
&gt;independent civil society groups, and anyone found guilt of derelict of
&gt;duty or any other form of 'penkelemese' should be made to face the music.
&gt;Life is so precious that it is unacceptable to waste life of people simply
&gt;because the authorities assume that they are 'nobody'. These kind of absurd
&gt;massacre could not have happened to ex-governors who were incarcerated as
&gt;suspects for corrupt practices, but, Nigerians who did not have 'long legs'
&gt;were mowed down by Nigeria state. It is a national shame.

&gt;You do have it wrong - You are actually employing a colonial tactic of the
&gt;British to divide and conquer based on arbitrary and static delineations of
&gt;ethnicity.  Nigeria is a multi-ethnic nation, not a confederation of ethnic
&gt;enclaves.  Leadership and national and state resources do matter, so rather
&gt;than attacking a person's ethnicity, one should look at the person's
&gt;effectiveness as a leader, the resources he/she has access to, and what
&gt;he/she has accomplished with those resources to improve the conditions and
&gt;safety of the prison system.

&gt;I will here again ask the same question that has earned me the undeserved
&gt;title of &quot;ethnic bigot&quot; from some quarters:

&gt;What does a &quot;Mrs. Maureen Omeili&quot;, a none indigene Yoruba who has no
&gt;discernible ties to Ibadan or Oyo State or to any Yoruba state have, to be
&gt;&quot;the Comptroller of Prison, Oyo State&quot; - a Yoruba State ?

&gt;Or a &quot;Prince Udom Ekpoudom&quot; being the &quot;the Oyo State Police Commissioner,&quot;
&gt;what amounts really to something akin to &quot;foreign occupation&quot; as in the
&gt;times of the colonial overlords?

&gt;Now, don't get wrong please. Neither the Yoruba nor the Hausa nor the
&gt;Ndiigbo (nor any other ethnic group) should have any business or rights
&gt;policing outside their ethnic enclaves either, if one truly wants security
&gt;and commitment to service in these branches of governance.

&gt;As far as practicable, Nigerians should be allowed and encouraged to do the
&gt;policing, and be responsible for judicial and legal services, law and
&gt;order, including prisons and prison warders, within their own ethnic
&gt;enclaves, if the Nigeria Police. The Nigerian Judicial Services, and the
&gt;Nigerian Prison Services are to be reformed and made responsive to the
&gt;needs of the communities they are supposed to serve.

&gt;You as well transfer teachers and make them teach children whose languages
&gt;they do not speak, and whose cultural backgrounds they know nothing about.

&gt;The entire structure can then be set up to be monitored by a central
&gt;federal service to ensure effective functioning.

&gt;This business of asking &quot;foreigners&quot; to police and &quot;imprison&quot; people to
&gt;whom they are not related or affiliated in any way is pure simple,
&gt;occupation by foreigners under another guise, foreigners who have no iota
&gt;of sympathy for their &quot;victims&quot;. It served the needs of our colonizers very
&gt;well, but has proven a disaster and a calamity for our continued peaceful
&gt;co-existence as a nation of diverse cultural, ethnic, linguistic and
&gt;religious entities.

&gt;Agodi Prison Horror!: How warders attacked journalist - Loses cellphone,
&gt;money, car key
&gt;Thur. 13th Sept. 2007

&gt;Mr. Tope Abiola
&gt;Men and officials of the Nigeria Prison Service and Nigeria Police recently
&gt;attacked a journalist who was on an official assignment at the Agodi Prison
&gt;for allegedly trying to expose the killing of some prison inmates. Adebayo
&gt;Waheed reports:
&gt;Ibadan has constantly been in the news. Only that on Tuesday, 11 September,
&gt;attention shifted to the Agodi Prisons in the heart of the city. Sporadic
&gt;gunshots were heard in the neighbourhood while there was a stampede.
&gt;As early as 8 a.m. on the fateful day, officers and men of the Nigeria
&gt;Police had stormed the prison with a view to assisting their prisons
&gt;counterparts avert an alleged jail break by some inmates who were said to
&gt;be protesting against the poor medicare and feeding in the prison, but they
&gt;ended up disrupting business activities at the popular Gate area of the
&gt;state capital just as some of the warders descended heavily on an Assistant
&gt;Editor with the Nigerian Tribune, Mr. Tope Abiola and his colleagues who
&gt;were trying to save him from the hands of the trigger-happy and power-drunk
&gt;prison operatives.
&gt;The operatives were trying to prevent men of the pen from accessing
&gt;information on what actually led to the death of the inmates in the custody
&gt;of the Nigeria Prisons Service in Ibadan . It was when they were doing this
&gt;that they descended on Mr. Abiola who was trying to perform his statutory
&gt;responsibility. He was given the beating of his life.
&gt;It is a miracle that Mr. Abiola was able to escape from the prison warders.
&gt;Their intention was not only to beat him but kill him because they felt he
&gt;had taken the pictures of some inmates

Hmmm. Pidgin means debased right? That seems to be a neological cultural approbation of the term.

I was not going to jump into this forray, one because these days, my hip pains (muscle strains) allow me minimal time on the computer (if it has to heal), and secondly because I thought it was romanticizing idealized notions. In any case, now I am. My friend, Agebtuyi has to be blamed!

One thing I laugh about is that there is an  ethnic limit to the human capacity for cruelty.

This good laugh  allows me to reflect.

Are armed robbers who rob in Ibadan only robbing non-Yoruba, and those in the Sabon area? Was Anini's act of terror carried out in neighboring states to the former Bendel state or mainly within the ambient that he calls home? What do we call the terror of the Alaiye Baba- the notorious area boys, are they also so selective in cataloguing and classifying the ethnicity of their victims before they prey on them?

Lugard and Ojukwu, respectively in their books: The Dual Mandate and Because I am Involved, have all alluded to the fact that a Nigerian colonial soldier can be greatly bestial in the showing-off of power to even members of his village, his kins, and those he is familiar with to prove his towering ascent in alignment with the power of the state; the power that be. In that sense, ethnicity has not analytically proven to eliminate terror. It is just simplistic-simpleton logic to  analyze social reality based on such reifications.  The ethnic warlords of Nigeria, would continue to privilege ethnicity beyond other analytic models in their confrontation with social reality and constructs.

Regarding Abiola case, it is on record that many prominent Yoruba, including the recent erstwhile President Obasanjo, also an Egba Yoruba, helped to kill his mandate following the June 12th, 1993 imbroglio.  Others denounced him and worked with the late Sani Abacha (maximum dictator and bespectacled general). Yoruba were among those in the so-called pro-democratic and civil rights movements that beckoned upon Abacha to take over from Shonekan, the head of the Interim National Government (ING). Was Diya, a Yoruba general not instrumental, in his own pursuit of domination and relevance, very much involved in winning the Yoruba initially to Abacha's side? Were the Jakandes, Onagoruwas, and other Yoruba not in the same Abacha's government that truncated the Abiola Presidential mandate and political aspiration, how many of them resigned when Abiola was detained and a chain of court processes unfolded? Or even more, was it outsiders non-Yoruba who betrayed the late Kudirat
Abiola to be assasinated, or a close personnel, also Yoruba who for possibly money denounced her to be killed by Abacha's blood thirsty assasins?

Yes, Abacha might have minimized Abiola, but not without the collaboration of some Yoruba actors, who too must share responsibility for Abiola's fate.  In the same way, they were non-Yoruba who stuck their neck out for Abiola's cause. In fact, one of the major crises of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) later after its formation, follows the alienation of non-Yoruba actors that were initially involved, as a result of Afenirere's actions that typified the democratic struggles along ethnic considerations.  The inordinate privileging of ethnic identity politics delimits certain serious considerations of the reasons that enable &quot;malaised domination&quot; within the Nigerian national life and processes. Yes, ethnicity plays a role but is it total? Or is this simply a subterfuge, that attempts to eliminate other factors, so that ethnic identity actors can image their imagined relevance, within a certain limited enclave and opinionated clime?

I personally can imagine, how the current Oyo crises for instance involves politics, is the outcome of ethnicity, rather than of an intra-political affairs.  Is Adedibu, Akala, and Ladoja not all Yoruba, and do we not know how the outcome of their altercations have produced terror in Ibadan? Do we not have on record the Ife-Modakeke crises during the Abacha era and its resurfacing during the early days of Obasanjo democratic administration? Are these cases of unleashed terror and mayhems purely non-Yoruba antics, or intra-Yoruba politics? Was Bola Ige killed by non-Yoruba actors? Was a Yoruba President not in power when many Yoruba were assasinated- Lai Balogun, Bola Ige, and others, and tillions date there's been no justice?

The capacity for terror, as it is currently expressed in Nigeria, is related focally to the goals of illicit domination, that manipulates ethnicity, religion, and other differences within its objective to succeed, even if it causes abysmal problems and trauma.  Finally, Federalism, like any other system of government is a social and cultural construction, that can succeed anyway, if there is the will.  It is on record that the emergence of the Federal Constitution in 1954 Nigeria, was the outcome of the efforts of Nigerian politicians who negated the erstwhile constitution. That Federalism in Nigeria has not worked is based on the fact that we have not allowed it to work. The politics of ultimate supremacy- winner take all, majority dominate all spheres, and eclipse the minorities, is one of the fundamental reason, while Federalism has not worked in Nigeria.  Awolowo had a vision of Federalism (confederation) in Nigeria that he envisaged as workable, he was Yoruba. It was
a Federal Nigeria (in spite of its contradiction) that produced a Yoruba as Nigerian President in 1999, even when his fellow Yoruba abandoned him and did not vote massively for him. Other ethnic groups voted for him, and he emerged President, even when so maligned by his own Yoruba ethnics.

Therefore, Federalism, to some extent has worked, even within Nigerian ethnic identity politics in favor of the Yoruba.  Further, even when we delimit the Nigeria space further, they would also emerge within Yorubaland, the politics of Egba versus Ijebu, Ibadan versus Ogbomosho, Ibadan versus Ilorin, and only God knows, how the Ekiti and the Oyo, would fair.  When all spheres are reduced, then the Ogbomosho man would run to their discrete backwaters, after the national ethnic identity politics is over, and the Ibadan would be the neck of the Owu, who is a prison comptroller in Ibadan, maybe even pursuing him to go head the prison in his Owu homeland, because an Ibadan cannot trust this Owu official.

Then, when will all these fragmentations end.

Dear Mr. Agbetuyi,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
You wrote:&quot; ...there is a commonsensical limit to cruelty, within a shared value culture and language..&quot;

From your name i assume you are a Yoruba, and against this background i go on  to say that you probably did not have the Yoruba in mind when you wrote the above quoted portion of your contribution.
A critical examination of modern history of  the Yoruba will of course nullify your thesis. For many years i worked in a federal government-owned management trainning institution and I had access to many middle and very senior public servants from across Nigeria, and from the three levels of government. Year upon year my colleagues and i  were inundated with heart-wrenching stories of how Yoruba Directors-General , Permanent Secretaries, CEOs of Federal and State Parastatals etc blocked, terminated, and destroyed not only the careers of fellow Yoruba, but were also responsible for their physical elimination from the service.
Have you forgetten how Obasanjo destroyed the careers of Justices Elias and Odesanya and other prominent Yoruba Nigerians when he was military head of state? How Yoruba ganged up against Abiola on June 12? Or how many people lost their lives during Operation We tie? You must remember the circumstances that led to Awolowo's imprisonment. Do you still not hear how in some sections of Yorubaland  how Akintola is still being cursed in his grave? The list is endless.
As we continue confront and try to resolve the deepning crises of contemporary Nigeria, what we should be doing as patriotic people is to fight to standstill  members of Nigerian political class - composed of people from all ethnic groups in the country - who are manipulating ethnicity, religion, state of origin, geography etc to gain and hold on to power. We should not join this bankrupt Nigerians -members of the politicall class - in fanning the embers of division and ethnicity.

The only such shared culture &gt; and value within the Nigerian federal service to date is (debased) pidgin &gt; culture, which at any rate, devalues and slowly strangles the development of &gt; Nigerian indigenous cultures.&gt; &gt; The only thing that allowed the Yeltsin coup succeed againstGorbachev and &gt; the soldiers sent to apprehend him balk at the performance of their &gt; professional duties was the mutually shared culture of soldiers and &gt; principles of democracy, whereas, the &quot;godogodos&quot; in Nigeria did not bat an &gt; eyelid in going to arrest the winner of a democratic election,(Abiola) &gt; because the victim was in the eyes of the tresonable arresters outside the &gt; enclave of the giver of the order, so that the higher ideal of democratic &gt; values is truncated beneath the background of the giver of the order. The &gt; notion of federal nation (American style) that Nigeria aspires to is not &gt; feasible within the purview of its present geo- ethnic configuration; at &gt; best it could make do the European Union type of non-national confederal &gt; federation, in view of similar multinational multi-tongued, multicultural &gt; ethos.&gt; &gt; Olayinka Agbetuyi&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From: Olumide Olaniyan &lt;olumy ... @yahoo.co.uk&gt;&gt; &gt;Reply-To: USAAfricaDialogue@googlegroups.com&gt; &gt;To: USAAfricaDialogue@googlegroups.com&gt; &gt;Subject: USA Africa Dialogue Series - Fw: USA Africa Dialogue Series - Re: &gt; &gt;FW: Agodi Prison Horror!: How warders attacked journalist - Loses &gt; &gt;cellphone, money, car key&gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 14 Sep 2007 15:49:54 +0000 (GMT)&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Oga Ojo,&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I can see the trend in your argument, I find it difficult to support &gt; &gt;because two wrongs do not make a right. What if those Nigerians, the Police &gt; &gt;Chief and Prison boss in Oyo state were actually born and bred in Oke Mapo? &gt; &gt;What if the senior and qualified Oyo Men or Women in the Police Force or &gt; &gt;Prison Services were born and brought up in Kano or Port Harcourt ? &gt; &gt;Ethnicity, though, currently downplayed, has remained an issue in &gt; &gt;sociopolitical (under)development of Nigeria . It determines who we MUST &gt; &gt;vote for to be our elected President. Remember how the options of the &gt; &gt;electorate were reduce to an Obasanjo or Olu Falae in 1999, Obasanjo or OBJ &gt; &gt;in 2003, and between a Yar'Adua, a Atiku and a Buhari in 2007. All other &gt; &gt;key posts are also determined by ethnicity of people. An Obasanjo's &gt; &gt;president will only attract an Atiku Vice President, A Ghali Na'Abba &gt; &gt;Speaker, and apparently an Ibo Senate President. One is not surprised that &gt; &gt;a Yar'Adua presidency also&gt; &gt; produced an Etteh Speaker in the House of Representatives. It is also a &gt; &gt;key factor for the appointment of Permanent Secretary, SGF, et al. People &gt; &gt;sometimes want to know the ethnic groups to which players from the national &gt; &gt;teams are from; if in there view, it tilts to the west, east, south or &gt; &gt;north, they become interested in knowing the parent of the coach. If it is &gt; &gt;a foreign coach, then, the tribe he mingles win become important. It is &gt; &gt;such an appalling thing since we are infected with it once we are born by &gt; &gt;particular parents irrespective of location of our birth. It is always &gt; &gt;head: we lose, Tail: they win.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;What gives the impression that a Mr. 'Yorubanimi' or a Mrs. 'Emikise Ajoji' &gt; &gt;would have protected those Nigerians killed in my own view, by over-zealous &gt; &gt;government authorities? I am particularly happy that National Human Rights &gt; &gt;Commission and other stakeholders have stepped in to investigate the &gt; &gt;endo-massacre committed on Nigerians who are merely suspects and &gt; &gt;incarcerated endless because of courts, and other government departments &gt; &gt;are on strike in Oyo state.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I suggest this case should be thoroughly investigated by concerned and &gt; &gt;independent civil society groups, and anyone found guilt of derelict of &gt; &gt;duty or any other form of 'penkelemese' should be made to face the music. &gt; &gt;Life is so precious that it is unacceptable to waste life of people simply &gt; &gt;because the authorities assume that they are 'nobody'. These kind of absurd &gt; &gt;massacre could not have happened to ex-governors who were incarcerated as &gt; &gt;suspects for corrupt practices, but, Nigerians who did not have 'long legs' &gt; &gt;were mowed down by Nigeria state. It is a national shame.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Olumide Olaniyan&gt; &gt;Abuja/Port Harcourt&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------&gt; &gt;Let us go ahead.

Neither the Yoruba nor the Hausa nor the &gt; &gt;Ndiigbo (nor any other ethnic group) should have any business or rights &gt; &gt;policing outside their ethnic enclaves either, if one truly wants security &gt; &gt;and commitment to service in these branches of governance.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;As far as practicable, Nigerians should be allowed and encouraged to do the &gt; &gt;policing, and be responsible for judicial and legal services, law and &gt; &gt;order, including prisons and prison warders, within their own ethnic &gt; &gt;enclaves, if the Nigeria Police. The Nigerian Judicial Services, and the &gt; &gt;Nigerian Prison Services are to be reformed and made responsive to the &gt; &gt;needs of the communities they are supposed to serve.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;You as well transfer teachers and make them teach children whose languages &gt; &gt;they do not speak, and whose cultural backgrounds they know nothing about.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The entire structure can then be set up to be monitored by a central &gt; &gt;federal service to ensure effective functioning.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;This business of asking &quot;foreigners&quot; to police and &quot;imprison&quot; people to &gt; &gt;whom they are not related or affiliated in any way is pure simple, &gt; &gt;occupation by foreigners under another guise, foreigners who have no iota &gt; &gt;of sympathy for their
