I have two cats which are indoor/outdoor cats. My wife and I have had them
for a few years since they were ~8 weeks old. They had their front claws
removed when they were 6 months old. What is the best solution to keep them
from jumping up on furniture, etc. (where they do not belong)? This habit
has occured since they were kittens. I really hate to see good furniture
get claw marks on them because of the cats.

Thanks for the help,
Danimal

Not have cats. I hate to say this but cats seem to like being up high,
particularly young cats. My cat will go out of her way to leap from one
piece of furniture to another when walking across the floor would be quicker
and shorter. I think it would be going against a cat's nature to try to
keep them on the ground. I can see keeping them off a counter or a table,
but all the furniture seems impossible and unreasonable. Best alternative
would be to give them a better place to go. Some good cat trees perhaps.
My cat has abandoned the couch for her tree perch since it is even higher

Just trim the claws...

I once saw a tv program on people who were keeping monkeys. People buy them
and then when the monkeys started biting and climbing on furniture, they
wouldn't be able to tolerate that. But ... these were monkeys, they climb as
a normal behavior!

Cat do climb as well. The only thing I ask mine, is not to climb on the
kitchen counter and table ( where I eat) WHEN I AM THERE. I know they do
climb there each night... I often find some hair on these surfaces!

Mostly, I &quot;spit&quot; and growl at them to show then I'm angry. They understand
very well and you should see how good I am at doing it... :0))

Cats do not like the smell of lemon, if you lightly spray lemon juice on the
places where you do not want your cats to go they should not. When I tried
this on a blanket on the back of our sofa my cat went out of his way to
avoid touching the blanket. You will have to re-apply every once and a
while. I hope this helps with your problem.

Declawing a cat is barbaric!!!
If you don't want them jumping on furniture,why not cage them?
You obviously don't care for their well being.
Why get a pet,then mutilate it?!!!!
Do you also have their voice boxes removed like I know some dog owners do?

Hmm,

Lets give my own 5 cent here,

Keeping animals in general requiers the people to be a bit more tolerant and
friendly than generally being displayed. It seems ok to want a cat or dog,
expecting them to fullfill human desires instead of their own.

My cats can kiss and lick and bite me (friendly bites ofcourse) but some ppl
won't tolerate it and that is quite wrong. You can't be an animal friend
only untill you think your cosmetic norms are being exceeded, thats
hypocritic. I always tell people who complain about hairs and stuff that I
have to tollerate female human hairs between my bread quite often and I wont
jump at them as well. Of course when the person is allergic to cats I can
understand their withdrawal to a house with too much cattyness in it.

My house is a bit of a zoo, because I want to take the consequences of
wanting a cat.

For example: someone has to find an intermediate solution between having
lots of expensive artworks and pottery on display and wanting a cat. You
can't expect the cat to NOT push over things that are loose.

I agree with Wardy, you don't want cats, you want a teddybear.
You shouldn't have cats if you're not prepared to be subject to it's
behavior. You might want to try a goldfish.

Advice: Bring cats to friends (if any) or family, provided they do like
cats. And get yourself a nice goldfish , he will stay right where he
belongs. So you can enjoy your good furniture. And the next time you feel
barbaric, you can even pull the scales of the fish so he won't lose them in
the water and make it all look bad.

Final advice : Don't get a goldfish before the cats are gone to be with a
loving family, goldfish looks yummie.

The best way I have found is either to use a squirt bottle to squirt them
everytime they do something bad or get double sided tape and put it where
you don't want them because they don't like sticky things on their paws.

It looks like I better respond to all of this.

First of all, I appreciate the people that gave me helpful advise.
Especially trimming of the claws.

We have NOT just started attempting to correct this behavior. We have been
trying since they were very young. We have tried spraying them with a water
bottle. We also have a cat stand for them. We have had it for 1.5 years.
We have tried other ideas as well with little lasting success.

I am not saying that I do not want them on every piece of furniture. We let
them on chairs, couches, etc. I like it when they sit on my lap. I also
like it when they sleep on the bed with us. However, there are certain
pieces of furniture that I feel they should not be on. Some of you stated
similar scenarios, ie: kitchen table, etc.

I am not going to touch the declawing. I will say that all of the cats in
my life (including these two) have enjoyed being outdoors and have not had
any problems. The two that we have now want to be outdoors more than we let
them. The one cat has still been known to climb some trees.

The point is, I am looking for possible solutions to the situation. I do
not have the answer. If there is no answer, then I will have to live with
it. However, I have not come to accept there is no answer.

I let my cat up on everything but I live alone and rarely cook with more
than a microwave. I have read that the way to keep them off counters and
tables is to make it an unpleasant place for them to be. Cats are creatures
of habit, if it is unpleasant to be there they will stop going there. Put a
layer of tinfoil/double sided sticky tape down on the counter and leave it
there for a few weeks. They don't like being on it. Put booby traps up
there like mouse traps under something that will go off loudly and scare
them. Make sure the trap can not close on the cat. The trick is to make the
cats think the counter is doing it, that it can defend itself or is just a
bad place to be.

&gt;&gt; Cats do not like the smell of lemon, if you lightly spray lemon juice
&gt; on the
&gt;&gt; places where you do not want your cats to go they should not.

&gt; you also run the risk that the lemon juice may discolor the furniture.

&gt; as for me, i'd rather have kitty on the sofa next to me.

Actually, I read his message and saw nothing exce[t someone asking
for a tip on how to protect their furniture. I saw absolutely
nothing in there that gave you the right to call the poster barbaric
or anything else, that was just rude and uncalled for.

We all have personal feelings about our pets and what we allow and
do not allow. That is between the pet and the owner. I do not declaw
my indoor cats but if someone else chooses to do that, it is their
business and I let them mind it. Life tends to run smoother that way.

I realize it is tough to hold back feelings about a pet, I just don't
believe it is necessary to slander someone in an effort to get your
point across. I commend your concern for pets but not at the risk of
being cruel to someone who hardly seems to be a pet abuser.

The way a person post a message states a lot about his/her character.
For example, I wonder why you felt you needed to &quot;yell&quot; in your
message and if you felt better afterwards. Some people have a need
to take over a conversation or thread by getting everyone off the
topic which WAS a request for help. Oh well.

Simply,
Serisa

&gt; Declawing a cat is barbaric!!!
&gt; If you don't want them jumping on furniture,why not cage them?
&gt; You obviously don't care for their well being.
&gt; Why get a pet,then mutilate it?!!!!
&gt; Do you also have their voice boxes removed like I know some dog owners do?

I use a very simple technique...a squirt bottle! Anytime my cats try
to claw the furniture or do anything that I consider &quot;inappropriate&quot;
behavior, I simply squirt them with the bottle. They learn very fast
and it only seems totake a few squirts.

"/> Kittens almost always are better off with another kitten around. You
can play with them all you like, but the amount of energy they work off
doesn't compare with what they will use up playing with another kitten.
I think it's mostly older cats used to being on their own which don't
like another cat around.

Apart from Rufus who arrived as a rescue of 3 1/2 and would be better
off as an only cat, mine all enjoy each other most of the time, sleep
together and wash each other quite often.

"/> I don't know about the USA. I'm in a tiny third world African
country, Swaziland, where *everything* is imported.

The reason why cat food is more expensive than dog food is that cats
need a higher proportion of animal protein in their diet than dogs
do.

I discovered this about twenty years ago. Someone brought me their
sick kitten (enteritis) to see what my opinion was. I didn't think
to ask if she'd been feeding her cat dog food and I suggested she
put the cat onto raw eggs which have a binding effect. She was
totally amazed at the difference in her kitten after the illness.
So she chatted to her vet, who suggested that the kitten had not
been getting enough protein because dog food is actually inferior in
protein quality to cat food.

When my father died in 1994 I bundled my border collie and some
clothes into the car and drove the 500 kilometres to the family home
where I simply arrived at a friend's home to stay. He has six
German Shepherds, and while they wouldn't hurt my dog, she was
frankly terrified, so we kindly kept her indoors where she ate the
cats' food for them. She got enteris as a result. Most unpleasant
for me - and I daresay for her. It didn't win her any friends among
the cats either.

"/> That is very true. You can feed a dog cat food in total safety, but
dog food is not good enough for cats.

&gt; I have two cats which are indoor/outdoor cats. My wife and I have had
them
&gt; for a few years since they were ~8 weeks old. They had their front claws
&gt; removed when they were 6 months old. What is the best solution to keep
them
&gt; from jumping up on furniture, etc. (where they do not belong)? This habit
&gt; has occured since they were kittens. I really hate to see good furniture
&gt; get claw marks on them because of the cats.

&gt; Thanks for the help,

&gt; I'm sure my cat would have much preferred if I had never brought a new cat
&gt; into his house. He much prefers to spend time with me than with the other
&gt; cat.

"/> as does mine. i actually had to seperate him from his sister as they
were unable to live together. he severely injured her in one of his
many attempts on her life.

but i'm sure the original poster meant that all cats would definitely
prefer having another cat around. he's a bit of a nut job.
