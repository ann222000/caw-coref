My daughter has recently purchased a lovely old silver plated castor
set. It looked as though it had been re silvered recently. Can one
clean it well and then put a coating of some kind on it, rather like
copper cookware often has when new, or will it turn it yellow? She
would like to if it can be done successfully. What should she use?
I also have a castor set which I would like to have resilvered. Is
there anything I should know before doing so?
Thanks
Liz

"/> How much of the silver is gone from your castor set? Some of the silver being
used today gives the piece a shiny almost tin looking appearance. I had an old
receiving card tray resilvered and was very disappointed. If you have someone
in your area who does this kind of work, ask to see a piece that has been
resilvered before turning your piece over. I would suggest that unless almost
all the silver is gone, leave it alone.

I am sure there are fine products out there to coat the castor set but, please
have her re-think doing so. There is nothing lovelier than old pieces with a
little patina on them. I know this has been re-silvered but by adding a
coating, it will only lessen the value of the piece. Tell your daughter that
by simply washing the silver every 3-4 months in warm soapy water, the tarnish
will melt away and she will probably never have to polish it.

As for having a piece re-plated, they do tend to look artificial for years and
an antique is suppose to look old. I agree with the other respondent, don't do
it unless it is absolutely necessary. Enjoy it for what it is.

I want to add my two cents worth:) You made a comment that if it doesnt look
old its not an antique:) I have been honored to come across a few rather old
items that looked brand new. You know something you cant sell those sort of
items.:) I find it silly that people who buy antiques to display in there house
will not buy a mint condition piece even if it is marked reasonably. But I do
agree I wouldnt resilver and item. Only thing worse than an antique that has
gone to hell is a fake refinished one:) I hate fake antiques and I consider
anything that has been refinished to be a fake.

"/> Interesting about washing the silver. Now a quick question for the group
- I have long used Simichrome polish on new silver - but I have a lovely
(and very thin-walled) late 19th Century carved sterling vase which is
very tarnished. Will Simichrome hurt it? If yes, any recommendations?

Someone (maybe Tracey) asked about cleaning a thin walled sterling vase.

When I have sterling to clean (particularly many pieces) I put a large
piece of aluminum foil in the bottom of the kitchen sink and then pour a
complete box of Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda on the foil,then lay ALL the
silveware or serving pieces or candle holders on top of the baking soda
and then pour a LARGE pot of BOILING (not just hot) water over it all
and Wallah ! clean sterling silver........ Do this in a ventilated room
and tie a handkerchief or towel around your nose/face as this method
gives off a nasty smelling gas for a few moments......

"/> Yea and he'll be creeping when he reads the above post. That method of
&quot;cleaning&quot; silver or silver plate ...... sucks!! ... IMO

Dangerous practice, it doesn't clean anything just coats the piece
with a thin film of silver deposit and can run the risk of destroying
the piece not only in finish but value as well.

IMO ........ don't do it ...... the only safe way to care for silver
and especially silver plate is by gentle washing with mild soap and
water, then carefully dry and buff lightly with a soft cloth. The very
occasional use of a silver polish and only used sparingly on badly
tarnished pieces as the last resort.

Flogging silver &quot;cleaned&quot; by that method, you'll be needing to wear
that handkerchief around your nose/face all the time Doug and with the
orange and black striped t-shirt to go with it. &gt;&gt;&gt;;

You know I really have no idea what you all are talking about:) there is a
really simple way of doing this all. Ok every once in awhile I come across a
nice piece of sterling. And because Im so cheap the only reason I get it is
because I noticed it and no one else did due to the severe tarnish. I just use
Tarn-x. I tell you that crap works. Shines pieces up in few minutes. They look
beautiful and whatever fake layer that might be there, well I dont care:) If
someone takes care of it they wont have to worry about polishing it:) and
anyway I just sell things:) im not in the long term business.

one.

"/> Thanks, Danny. It is just that attitude and business practice that gives the
entire antiques industry a bad reputation. Because of a few dealers like you
out to make the quick buck off of unsuspecting trusting buyers, the rest of us
get stigmatized. We don't need people like you. Have you ever considered
becoming a lawyer?

"/> Yea, Bollocks or Ballocks doesn't pass the American spell-checker in
my newsreader ;) .... is a special language spoken by the like of
Danny. Yes Fayette, it's meaning in the &quot;Danny&quot; context is quite
obvious, much like someone that's talking via his/her rear end, sort a
of muffled incoherent language used by dit-wits.

Usually a taboo word, but where I come from, not so :) it does of
course have a proper meaning, referring to the &quot;body parts&quot; that Danny
is clearly missing. Yes it's a good word ...... IMO :)

So if Danny continues to talk bollocks, he will continue to receive a
right good bollocking for it. &gt;&gt;&gt;;

Well, before everyone just writes off my idea about the foil,baking soda
and boiling water because Ronnie wouldn't use it on any 'important' 500
year old sterling which is the only type that he would be interested in,
I wish that at least ONE r.a poster would try it (it DOESN'T hurt
stainless sinks,that's what I have).
Put a small strip of foil and a few tablespoons of Arm &amp; Hammer in a
bowl or dish and place ONE fork,spoon or knife on it and add BOILING
water,let sit for a couple of minutes and then rinse with warm water.
Maybe I'm boolocks TOO ! IMO

"/> I can hardly believe I read that! Unless by &quot;antique&quot; he means anything
more than 10 years old.

The whole point of an antique is its age, the life it's led, its
history, its patina! Over-cleaning destroys the patina, and all that
lovely aging, and destroys the value of the piece both commercially and
as an item in its own right. As you said, so people as just stupid.

"/> Danny,

Let me know where you're selling these box lots! There's a big market out
there for good quality old silver plate, worn and tarnished even! I used to do
a light polish before I sold silver or silver plated items. I've found that my
serious collectors prefer to buy something that's totally black, and clean it
themselves to the degree they desire (If they polish it at all!).

That &quot;Silver Plated Garbage&quot; that you, and others like you, are selling by the
box to people like me, is putting my daughter through college!
