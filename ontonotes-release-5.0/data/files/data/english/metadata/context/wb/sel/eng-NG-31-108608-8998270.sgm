I did some checking up in the archive to see when I definitely was
onto this Model of Lobachevskian Geometry where I get both
Hyperbolic and Elliptic geometry from the sphere.
Up until that time my best model was the saddle shape but it never
told me much about numbers intrinsic
to Hyperbolic geometry.

So if the p-adics are the intrinsic numbers to Elliptic geometry what
are the intrinsic numbers to
Hyperbolic geometry? The answer awaited until I found the correct
model that would reveal what those
numbers are.
Apparently it was January of 2007 when the realization came and not
2006. And the realization of
the model is that the sphere can have distended line segments forming
triangles or squares but each
of those line segments can be turned into either concave outwards or
concave inwards. A globe with
Greenwich meridian or line of longitude from England to France has an
equal and opposite line segment
on the opposite side of Earth that is the same except it is concave
inwards instead of concave outwards
so that if those two equal line segments were joined together would
cancel one another and leave
remaining a Euclidean straight line segment.

So here is how I get Hyperbolic geometry and Elliptic geometry all
from a sphere. I say that a triangle
on the sphere is concave outwards of its line segments but has an
equal triangle as antipodal triangle
on the opposite side of the sphere and equal in all respects except
that it is concave inwards so that
if I were to join these two triangles the concave outward cancels the
concave inwards and what
remains is one Euclidean plane geometry triangle.

So that if P-adics were the points of a sphere then the antipode
points would be negative-P-adics.

This is similar arrangement in Euclidean Geometry where the podal
points are positive Reals
and then we cross the 0 and enter the antipodal points which are the
negative Reals.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From reading my old post of January 2007, I can now see and remember
">

why I did not celebrate back
then. Because I was still unclear how to get Hyperbolic geometry and
Elliptic geometry all from one
sphere model. Back then I harped on the &quot;inside of the sphere&quot; as the
concave inward as compared
to the outside of the sphere as the concave outward. I could not get
Hyperbolic geometry as a stand
alone geometry, for I had to use both.

And I see now that this solution simulates the Poincare model of a
disc only here it is a half sphere
with the inside surface as concave inwards.

So I did not celebrate in January 2007 for it was not yet ironed out.

Start of today's new fresh post and a new fresh assault upon the old
and beautiful and haunting
mathematical discovery by Euler that e^(i)(pi) = (-1). This discovery
by Euler is as mysterous to
math as it is to physics and is one in which when fully understood is
a deciding evidence as
to whether the Atom Totality theory is true or whether the Big Bang
theory is true. The Atom
Totality theory says the Observable Universe, the night sky that is
allowed to be seen and observed
is merely the last six electrons of a gigantic atom of plutonium. And
since the night sky is just
six electrons, what the Euler Identity is all about with its (-1) is
that an electron has Charge of
(-1). And so, when you multiply how fast the Universe grows  or how
long is the Universe as a number called (e) and how
wide the Universe is as a number called (pi) and how thick is the
Universe called (i). That
when you multiply them together in Euler's Identity you end up with
the Charge of a electron which
is (-1). So here in this textbook we look back and we assemble Euler's
old Identity and give it fresh
meaning.

So now, we take the tool I discovered in January of 2007 that a sphere
provides both Hyperbolic
and Elliptic Geometry as a Model for both those geometries. And the
tool is that the semisphere
is concave inwards and the other semisphere is concave outwards. So
that one triangle in a semisphere
is Elliptic geometry and when joined with its antipodal triangle which
is concave inwards cancels one
another out forming a residue triangle which is Euclidean flat plane
geometry triangle. So that
means Elliptic geometry is positive P-adics and Hyperbolic geometry is
negative P-adics.

Now the new fresh assault on the Euler Identity, since we can have the
Reals and P-adics in one
equation by using the above Model of the Sphere which gives us the P-
adics interplayed with the
Reals by that tool of a residue triangle where the concave outward
cancels the concave inward.

Since I am using the 10-adics in this textbook as all possible digit
arrangements, I will stick with that
notation.

The 10-adics are residued into the 5-adics and 2-adics since 10 is not
prime. And the 5-adics have
two square roots of (-1) which I will use. These are:

.......303243121.2

and

.....422141201323.3

Pi and e are Reals as such:

3.14159......

and

2.71828.......

So, now, I have all the four numbers that goes into the Euler Identity
and what I have that noone
in past history ever had in dealing with this problem is a true
overall picture of the true physics of
the Cosmos as well as a Model to work with and, the best understanding
of the foundation of Numbers
themselves. So I have alot in favor that noone before in history ever
had when tackling Euler's
Identity.

So, now, suppose (e) were 3 and suppose (pi) were 3 and suppose (i)
were ......111111111.

Suppose that were true and when multiplying them as in the Euler
Identity gives me:

3^ .......3333333333

which gives me

......99999999

But because it is a residue it is a negative .....99999999 and thus
equal to (-1)

Now when we look at the two 5-adic square roots of (-1) they do not
look far away from
.....11111111

nor does (pi) look far away from 3 or 2.7 far away from 3 for (e).

A key to this textbook is to well order the chapters since it will be
over 1,000 pages
long and designed for all parents with a High School education to be
able to read
and instruct their 6 year old son or daughter. So I have to style the
chapters
so that they flow and are easy to read.

Chapters of this book:
(1) preface
(2) introduction
(3) physics is the supreme science and math a minor science
(4) Infinite Integers are geometry of the surface of a sphere
(5) Reals are the geometry of Euclidean Plane or 3rd dimension
(6) some big errors of past Number systems such as Euclidean lines are
finite
(7) Infinite Integers are macro whereas Reals are micro
(8)  definition of Infinite Integer or P-adic and definition of Real
(9) symmetry between P-adics versus Reals
(10)  symmetry between Euclidean Geometry versus Elliptic/Hyperbolic
(11) new fresh look at Euler's Identity of e^(pi)(i) = -1

(12) Adding Infinite Integers
(13) Multiplying Infinite Integers
(14) Subtracting Infinite Integers
(15) Dividing Infinite Integers
(16) Square Root of Infinite Integers
(17) exponentiation of Infinite Integers

(18) Infinity comes in only one type
(19) Cantor diagonal is a modern day mistake repeat of the Zeno
paradox of the
turtle and rabbit race
(20) Why Counting Numbers are internal to P-adics and not Reals
(21) Intrinsic coordinates of Eucl geometry
(22) Intrinsic coordinates of Riem geom
(23) Intrinsic coordinates of Loba geom

Apparently the flow of thought of my mind while writing this textbook
is not
in tune with the chapters that I list. A big reason for that is
because some of the
material is just freshly discovered which this book is forcing me to
do and I give
higher priority to &quot;discovery&quot; than to organizing.

I do know that this book will have many chapters for students like
short brief chapters to
give them a sense of accomplishment in a quick time span. A young mind
cannot focus
as long as old minds and so the chapters should be as short as
possible especially
for math and physics.

Now this chapter on SYMMETRY is one of the very most important in this
textbook for it
is the validation in math as well as physics that when you have the
utmost symmetry that
you in a sense are validating the truth. That if your theory has alot
of asymmetry is probably
because it is a false theory.

Now the Maxwell Equations in physics are a great example of
validation. The Maxwell Equations
have alot of symmetry, but they also have two small asymmetrical
items. But when you look
at the Maxwell Equations in an overall Universe of an Atom Totality,
those two small asymmetrical
items of the Maxwell Equations disappear. This is what I mean by
symmetry validating the truth
of a theory and in our case the truth of this textbook. So let me
plunge directly into the Symmetry
of Numbers and compare them to the Symmetry of Geometries.

I started this textbook defining two types of Numbers:

Reals as infinite rightward strings and a finite portion leftwards
such as this Real:

5.7777777.......

And P-adics as infinite leftward strings and a finite portion
rightwards such as this 10-adic

........77777777777.5

Now that is beautiful symmetry because one is the opposite or reverse
of the other.

Now can you have numbers which are Doubly Infinite? Where it is a
string both infinite rightwards
and leftwards? No. Because you break symmetry and when you do that you
have a fake theory.
So Doubly Infinites are fakery and meaningless and nonsense.

Why is that important? Well it is very important for most
mathematicians of the last century and
even the 7 years of the 21st century are still saying that Euclidean
Geometry has lines that stretch
out to infinity. That they are parallel and stretch to infinity. When
they make such claims and assertions
they are saying that a Real number exists which is Doubly Infinite. A
Real number such as

......777777777.55555555........ in order to represent a Euclidean
line that stretches out to infinity.

Euclidean Geometry has no lines that stretches to infinity for all
lines in Euclidean Geometry are finite
and are what is called &quot;line segments&quot;.

So here we see how attention to detail of Symmetry saves us from
making huge mistakes.

Another example of SYMMETRY is in geometry and follows closely to the
symmetry in Numbers that there
are only two types of numbers.

Geometry consists of two and only two types of geometry and they are:

Euclidean which can be broken down into positive Reals and negative
Reals

Elliptic connected with Hyperbolic where they are the positive P-adics
joined with the negative P-adics

The blunder and error past mathematicians made with geometry is that
they thought Hyperbolic
and Elliptic were never joined in one. They thought these two
geometries were isolated and independent
of one another. They thought the world of geometry had 3 independent
geometries.

But since the world of mathematics all comes from Physics and physics
says the world comes
in two things, either particle or wave, then the world cannot have 3
independent geometries. That the
world comes in only two distinct and independent geometries and they
are Euclidean as
representated by Reals and the Elliptic-Hyperbolic geometry as
represented by P-adics.

Much more later about symmetry....

I wanted to save the algebra operations on P-adics for last, but when
this book
is fairly largely assembled I will put those chapters near to the
introduction.

In the above I would have to explain the assertion:

3^ .......3333333333

The way I am going to define P-adic addition, multiplication,
subtract, divide, roots, powers
is that I am going to stay as close as possible to Reals operations of
the same.

For example adding ..........999999 with ......9999999 would be this

.....99999999.
+...99999999.
---------------------

And defined by Reals as a sequence of additions as such

9
+9
-----
18

99
+99
-------
198

999
+999
-------
1998

And so, from Reals, we have the P-adic of 10-adics addition of .....
99999 and .....9999
as that of .......999999998

In a similar manner I define the operation of exponentiation for p-
adics by using the Reals
in sequence form where I take

3^3

then

3^33

then

3^333

And what I end up with is the conclusion that an infinite string for
exponent leads to zeroes
in very long stretches, where the 0 in a place value seems to always
eventually occupy future
digit place values so that 3^.......33333333333333333333

is going to end up as .....00000000000000000 which is zero.

But we cannot have that since zero is the smallest positive-P-adic and
so 3^.....33333
is the largest positive P-adic which is ......99999999999.

But that does not explain how the Euler Identity ends up as (-1) and
the answer to that
is because the application of the residue of joining the Elliptic .....
999999  with the Hyperbolic
of (-)....9999999 was not done. For the (-)....99999 is your (-1).

So what remains the same after the sequence from 3^3 to that of 3^3333
is the digits ..........3523

We cannot tell if the next digit is going to be a 5 or perhaps a 7 or
something else and so
we have to go out to 3^33333 and then 3^333333 and so on as we build
our answer as to
what 3^......333333333 is.

So the answer so far is that 3^......33333333 = .......3523 and if
someone needs more of an answer
they have to multiply out further to elaborate further on the answer.

In this manner, Exponentiation is defined for Infinite Integers and P-
adics.

Resuming discussion with e^(pi)(i) = (-1).

5-adic square roots of (-1)
.......303243121.2

and

.....422141201323.3

Pi and e are Reals as such:

3.14159......

and

2.71828.......

Using (e) as 3 and (pi) as 3 to make things easier, let us do a trial
run and taking (i) as
....1323.

We have 3 x ....1323 giving us ......3969 for (pi) x (i)

Now for e^ (pi) x (i) we have 3^ ....3969

So what is

3^9

then

3^69

then

3^969

then

3^3969

Is it going to be close to .......9999? I doubt it.

So what number, call it Z such that 2.71^Z is going to give me .....
999999999

Is it a number that is somewhere inbetween ......03030303. and .....
303030.
if I can describe &quot;inbetween&quot;.

So what I am hunting for here is a Z number which is 2.71^Z = ....

Looks like I am going to have to define Roots operation such as the
square root for P-adics.

So what is the square root of ......999999999999 ?

We do this operation in the same manner we define all operations for p-
adics. We keep everything
similar to the operations of Reals and we run sequences to get the
answer.

So the square root of .......99999999 goes like this:

square root of 9

then

square root of 99

then

square root of 999

then

square root of 9999

then

square root of 99999

and on and on until we have the digit place we are satisfied with.

sqrt of 9 = 3
sqrt of 99 = 9.9
sqrt of 999 = 31.6
sqrt of 9999 = 99.9
sqrt of 99999 = 316.2
sqrt of 999999 = 999.9
sqrt of 9999999 = 3162.2

So the square root of the p-adic or Infinite Integer of ......99999999

is two answers. One answer is ......999999
and the second answer involves a string with digits of 316 which can
be represented
as such

.........316.....r where the r is the radix point.

Now why do I bother with the square root of ....999999 since the P-
adics in this book are
only the 10-adics string? Well, because in 10-adics there are no
square roots of (-1) and
we have to use the 5-adics sqrt (-1). However we have some luck here
in that the 10-adics
or any other adics do have a sqrt(-1).

Remember that the P-adics have negative P-adics. So there is a
positive .....9999999
which is not (-1) but the number -...99999 is the negative 10-adic and
it has two
square roots as such:

square root of -...99999 is -...9999
and the number -...316...

It is this second square root of -...9999 which perhaps is the (i) in
Euler's Identity,
and which I need to explore.

Sorry about the numbering of these posts for I have two #16s which I
corrected with a #17 (sic). So
this post is #18.

The way I am defining P-adics and Infinite Integers is so that someone
can easily cross the bridge
between doing Reals and doing P-adics. That I trashcan or dismiss base-
dependency. So that I can
look at a P-adic and all the other P-adics as one whole picture, just
as we do with Reals in base-10.
Theorems about Reals are base independent. This textbook achieves the
same base independency
that Reals have. And when I operate with Reals of add, multiply etc
etc, I want the same operations
for P-adics.

The old P-adics as written by Koblitz and Gouvea, are more of a
Algebraic exercise where p-adics
are seen as a Rational number of the Reals than as independent and
different numbers than the Reals.
The old P-adics had stuff such as ....99999 is equal to (-1). The true
P-adics has ....999999 something
that is totally different from any Real Number and where .....99999 is
never equal to (-1).

The P-adic of .......00000002 is not the same number as the Real
2.0000000....... and the best way
to describe that difference is that the P-adic is a point on a sphere
surface whereas the Real
is a point in Euclidean Plane geometry so they can never be equal.

Recently I said that the Gelfond - Schneider number of 2^sqrt2 was
Algebraic and contrary to their
claim it was transcendental. And one proof of that is to show that
2^sqrt2 has a transpose in P-adics.
It happens that sqrt2 is a 7-adic.

So what I aim to do here and now is give a transpose of 2^sqrt2 in 10-
adics and to show what
this number is in P-adics. If it exists in P-adics then it is a
Algebraic Real Number and the Gelfond-Schneider
claim was a fake theorem.

The square-root of 2 in Reals is 1.414213.... and is an Irrational
Real.

I transpose that Real into 10-adics as .....3124141.

So, now, I have it set up. What is this number in P-adics

2^.....3124141 ???

Remember how I am defining all the operations in P-adics as the same
as the operations
in Reals. Where I operate just as if they are Reals and I take the
convergence of the
sequence.

So I look for these numbers:

2^41

then

2^141

then

2^4141

then

2^24141

and so on, so on

And what emerges in the convergence of this sequence, (I mean what
stays the same digits in
the place value) is the answer.

Now I do not have a computer free at the moment to give me these
numbers.

But the important issue is that we have a well defined concept of an
infinite integer exponent.

And the fact that all the Gelfond-Schneider Numbers have an answer in
P-adics means that they are
all Algebraic numbers, even though they were Real transposed numbers.

The fact that I can grind out all the digits for as far as I want with
2^....24141 means it is Algebraic
and since it is the transposed Real 2^sqrt2 means that Real is also
Algebraic.

(For crying out loud, learn to format your posts!!!)

So it appears you can use the old algorithm for the square root of an
integer; you just keep going forever (6 year-old kids will love
THAT ...) and you don't bother with a decimal point. (See
http://www.nist.gov/dads//HTML/squareRoot.html )

But in order to be a REAL square root, you need to wind up with ....
999 when you square it; i.e., when you multiply it by itself. If you
multiply a string of 9's by a string of 9's, you get something ending
in 1, so ...999 is a &quot;fake&quot; (or &quot;extraneous&quot;) square root of ...999.
Come to think of it, ...22613 * ...222613 doesn't equal ...999 either
(the ten's digit is wrong).

But if (sqrt(x)) * (sqrt(x)) doesn't have to equal x, I guess that's
okay.

Probably not! It is probably that ......9999999 or some nearby number
to that of ......999999
is the (i) in Euler's Identity, perhaps some P-adic with a radix
of .....9999997r where the
r stands for radix point.

Here I am far ahead of the present day mathematics community for they
could never see or
even understand that the 10-adics or any P-adic of composite such as
10 has a square root of
(-1). I get a square root of (-1) in 10-adics because there is a
-......999999999 as well as a
+.....999999999

But this chapter is about MULTIPLICATION and I left the above
suspended loose in mid air
last night. So let me see if the square root of -.....99999999999 is
really .....99999 where
I multiply:

.....999999999   x ..........999999999 to see if it gives me ......
9999999

Here again as always, a operation in P-adics/Infinite Integers is the
exact same way as
the operation done in Reals and the answer is the sequence of digits
that does not change.
Why do I define the operations in this manner? Because I want to
escape the base dependency for
which the modern day accepted P-adics such as Koblitz and Gouvea and
going back to Hensel
himself. Their P-adics was nothing more than the Rational Reals
dressed up in a costume pretending
to be someone else. Remember the old Monty Python TV shows where the
men comedians pretend
to be old women with high pitched voices screaming &quot;I don't like
spam&quot;. Well that is what the mathematics
community pretends the P-adics are-- just another way of writing the
Rational Reals. Why pretend
the P-adics are Rational Reals when the P-adics are an entirely
different number and comprise a
Number system that is completely different? So it takes Archimedes
Plutonium and this textbook to drive
that point home. To teach the world what these numbers truly are.

So, MULTIPLICATION

Is ....999999 x .....99999999  equal to ....999999 as square roots
multiplied by a square root??

Let us see.

We take

9 x 9

then we take

99 x 99

then we take

999 x 999

then we take

9999 x 9999

And so on

We then see what digits in what place values remain the same in that
sequence

9x9 = 81

99x99 = 9801

999x999 = 998001

9999 x 9999 = 99980001

So we begin to see the pattern of the sequence forming and it does not
look good for the
above claim that the square root of -.....999999999 which is (-1), is
the number ....99999
because of the 80001 pattern developing. So how to fix this problem?
The answer is easy
in that the radix point was not accomodated. So if I put into the
radix point such as this

9r99 x 9r99 = 99r8001

And so the square root of -....99999 in P-adics is indeed ....
99999r9999 where the radix
portion is a finite string.

Now let me get back to the Euler Identity of looking for a Z number to
satisfy 2.71^Z = -....99999
For I suspect that the Z number is .....999997 with perhaps a finite
radix portion. The old p-adics
people would say ....999997 was (-3) but theirs was nothing more than
a Monty Python man dressed
as a woman with a high pitched voice.

I need to clarify one point that is already become murky and obfuse.
The issue of -....99999
as opposed to +....9999 and their square roots.

I said the sphere surface is covered in P-adics. That as you start
with 0 then go to 1 then 2 then 3
then 4 then 5 and on and on until you come back around in one great
circle and end up at +...99999
and you are one step away from 0 again. I said this number +.....
999999 is the largest possible
integer that exists and is the infinity-integer- number itself so no
need to write the sideways 8
anymore for infiinity since +....999999 is the largest possible
integer. Now I did not include a
radix point for some would argue +....99999r9 is larger than +....
99999. But I am correct in saying
it is the largest Integer and the Infinity Integer. But getting back
to the clarification of the positive
and negative sign on ....99999

I said that a sphere is divisible into semispheres at all great-
circles including the 10-adic great
circle. So the 10-adic of ....99999 can be part of the semicircle or
semisphere that is not a part
of the numbers ....00001 , ....000002 etc. And that a negative 10-adic
is the antipodal point of
a positive 10-adic. And the reason for this is because the sphere has
both Elliptic Geometry
properties and Hyperbolic geometry properties, that when we take a
triangle formed from
say a line segment that goes from England to France to Germany and
back to England
that the opposite side of the globe has the identical same triangle
only it is concave inwards whereas
the England triangle is concave outwards. And when these two triangles
formed on a sphere
are joined in some process what remains is a flat Euclidean triangle
where the angle sums are
180 degrees. Why does it leave a flat Euclidean triangle when those
two are joined? Because the
concave inward cancels the concave outward leaving Euclidean geometry.
So every p-adic that
covers the surface of a sphere has a antipodal p-adic and these are
represented as a negative
p-adic. So that there is a +....9999 and a -....99999

So the +......999999 is the world's largest integer and is the
Infinity Integer. The number -.....99999
is (-1). So when I take the square root of +....99999 the answer I get
is also the answer for
the square root of -....99999 with a negative sign in front of the
answer. I hope that clarifies things
and I maybe shaky on some issues of this also. So, now, let me proceed
to what is perhaps the
worlds first true conquering of Euler's Identity.

I am not going to parse words here; get to the heart. Let me call (e)
as 3 and (pi) as 3 to see if it
comes close enough to use 2.71 and 3.14 respectively. For (i) let me
use -.....99999 of 10-adics
since -.....9999r9999 is the square root of (-1). If it gets close
enough then I substitute actual (pi)
and (e).

So we have in this approximation :

3^ (3 x ....99999) = (-1)

Does it get close at all?

3 x ....999999 according to our Multiplication is ....999997

3^....999997 according to our Exponentiation is the convergence of the
sequence

3^97
then
3^997
then
3^9997
then so on

Yes, it looks very promising for it looks like it will get close
to .....9999997

And even closer yet to what I want of ....9999999

Because 2.71 where the &quot;7&quot; delivers a &quot;9&quot; that can eliminate the &quot;7&quot;
in ....999997
delivering .....9999999

So I think I am almost home on this.

Yes indeed, it looks very promising since

2.718^9 = 8095.52599

So that sequence will generate alot of &quot;9&quot;

But when we substitute ever more exacting values for (pi) and (e) into
this equation:

(e)^(pi)x ....99999

we can see where the final answer gets closer and closer to ....99999

I need some outside computer strong enough to carry out multiplication
on this scale:

2.71^ 3.14x....999999

where I defined multiplication and exponentiation above as identical
to the Reals operations
and the answer as the sequence whose digits do not change.

I suspect as we throw in more digits of pi and e above that the number
gets more and more
closer to ....99999999

What I would not understand is that all the people looking to pick the
cherry that was Euler's
Identity, how they could have ever overlooked the idea that ....999997
and .....999999
are the answers. But then again Maxwell's discovery of the speed of
light in the Maxwell Equations
was overlooked. So there is a first time for every new discovery.

Alright, let us look at it from a commonsense and even layperson's
point of view.
And a look at it from a Pragmatist viewpoint.

I am claiming that the world's largest integer, and calling it the
Infinity Integer is ...999999
and is a replacement for the sideways 8 we often symbolize infinity
with in mathematics.
So instead of calling infinity as the sideways 8, we can now write
infinity as simple a
number as ....99999999 which is the Infinity-Integer. Now if we put a
radix point onto
this Infinity-Integer and add some digit places rightwards such
as .....999999r8
or .......999999r99 then one could say those are larger Infinity
numbers than the
Infinity-Integer of .....999999999r

The commonsense I want to discuss is that these numbers of ....
9999999r or .....999999r99
are infinity numbers and so when they are used in equations such as
this:

2.71 ^ (3.14 x .....999999) = .....999999

that the question comes up as to whether that is commonsense?

Does it make commonsense that if you multipy the world's largest
integer, the infinity integer
by 3.14 or by 3.14159 that you would get anything other than a return
of the world's largest
number? Does it make sense that if you multiply infinity by 3 that you
would get back something smaller
than infinity? No, of course if you multiply the Infinity Integer by 3
or by 3.14 or by 3.14159 or any
other approximation of (pi) that you will end up with none other than
the Infinity Integer once again.

So that the above equation becomes by commonsense:

2.71 ^ ....99999999 = ......9999999

And now examine this last piece of the above by commonsense. We have
2.71 to the exponent
of the world's largest number. So does commonsense not tell us that
exponent is simply multiplication
and we went through the multiplication of the world's largest number
before, and the final outcome
of that is simply the world's largest number again. So the above ends
up as this equation.

.....9999999 = ......9999999

Now commonsense is not a mathematical proof, but it is important that
commonsense rules the situation
or at least is explainable in a situation.

The point is this. The Euler Identity of (e)^(pi)x(i) = (-1) where (i)
is the Infinity-Integer then it really
makes no difference what numerical value for (e) or (pi) are. Does it?
Because multiplication and
exponentiation of the world's largest number simply gives back the
same world's largest number.

And the only reason mathematicians missed this explanation of the
Euler Identity is because they
could not see the P-adics are different numbers than the Rational
Reals. They thought that ....99999
is (-1). They never realized that ....99999 is not (-1) but the
world's largest integer. The negative of
....999999 is (-1).

The square root of both +....99999 and -.....9999999 is ....999999.
When you take the square root
or cube root or root of any power of the world's largest number, you
are going to get back the world's
largest number. Mathematicians until I came along thought the p-adics
were merely a different representation
of the Rational Reals and Irrational Reals and that ...99999 was
merely (-1). They never realized
that the P-adics are altogether different from Reals. As different as
a human is to a tree. They thought
P-adics was the same species as Reals, and merely an extension of
Reals. That is why they
overlooked resolving Euler's Identity.

When you take &quot;to the power&quot; of the world's largest integer of ....
99999 your answer
will come back as the world's largest integer. This is only
commonsense.

AP claims that his &quot;infinite integers&quot; are base-free, but the

There IS a substantial difference between 10-adics and other p-adics.
For instance, there is a square root of -1 in the 13-adics (by
Hensel's Lemma) but not one in the 7-adics. Hence there is no way to
make them truly base-free, in the sense that you can't assign to every
13-adic a 7-adic so that the arithmetic operations hold up.

&gt; &gt; be represented
&gt; &gt; as such

&gt; &gt; .........316.....r where the r is the radix point.
">

I was curious to see if pi or (e) had the string of 316227766 and used
these
two websites of their pi and (e)

http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/e.2mil
http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~huberty/math5337/groupe/digits.html pi to
100,000 digits

Curious to see if they had those digits in them in that sequence to
tell me if they would
build a string of 99999

Curious to see if the occurrence of that string of 31622 showed up for
pi in the same place
it shows up in e. They came close but not the same. Neither one had
the sequence
of 316227766. Why explore this? Because perhaps I can figure out if
the (i) is a string
that is ....9999999 compared to a string that is .....316227766.....r
Or perhaps a combination
of the two such as say ........999993162299993162........r

Probably all of this exploring gives naught since pi and (e) have no
pattern, but in exploring
some stone may be turned over which yields a nice discovery.

As far as I know there is no pattern between pi and (e), none
whatsoever. And that is in keeping
with their being transcendental.

Now, the Euler Identity itself should be a counterexample to the
Gelfond Schneider alleged theorem
in that you have a exponent that is transcendental yet whose product
of (-1) is algebraic. So if both
the exponent and (e) is transcendental and delivers the algebraic
number (-1), why would
Gelfond and Schneider insist that 2^sqrt2 is transcendental?

But getting back to the issue of a pattern between pi and (e) for the
Euler Identity. I also checked each
corresponding digit place of pi relative to (e) as for even digits
such as 2,4,6 versus odd digits such
as 3,5,7. Why explore that for a pattern? Because if we multiply then
exponentiate to get a final
answer of (-1), perhaps there is a pattern of even and odd digits in
place values of pi and (e). There
was none to report.

I explored successive subtractions to see if there is some pattern to
the &quot;difference&quot; between the
two numbers, and it went like this 43, 423, 4233, 42331, 423311, ..
and there is no pattern here.

Pi
3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974

2.718281828459045235360287471352662497757247093699959574966

There is one solution that really solves it all, but I hate to go
there, for most would consider it
a &quot;easy out&quot; rather than a solution. The idea is that the
multiplication of (pi) with (i) ends
up as 0 and then the (e)^0 would be 1, but that needs to be (-1) so
there is one more hurdle.
This &quot;easy out&quot; reminds me of my recent journey with thermodynamic
absolute temperature scale
of Kelvin where the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation of 2.71
Kelvin when taken to the
zero power is a Kelvin temperature of 1 degree Kelvin and established
Kelvin as an Absolute
Temperature Scale, not just a scale that has Absolute Zero but the
entire scale is Absolute. So
the exponent of 0 establishes an Absolute Temperature Scale for
Kelvin.

My only problem with that easy out is that it ends up with +1 and I
need (-1).

Now, is there someway I can finagle that equation of (e)^0 to be (-1)
instead of +1???

Perhaps I can say that for the reason that two of the numbers in
Euler's Identity are not even
numbers as defined in this textbook. Pi and (e) are not even numbers
since they have holes
in their digit strings and are thus &quot;incomplete and not yet formed&quot;,
and so are not numbers.
One number in the Euler Identity is a P-adic of (i) and the other
number is a Real of (-1).

So, since pi and (e) are not even Numbers can I finagle a negative
sign out of them?
Or, better yet, is there such a thing as a negative zero as distinct
from a positive zero?

Perhaps such a thing exists because P-adics are the points on the
sphere, the intrinsic
coordinate points of a sphere and the P-adic of zero 0 exists just as
well as ....0001
or .....0002 or any other P-adic. So if each P-adic has an Antipodal P-
adic, just as the point
where London exists has a antipode geographical point on the opposite
side of the globe.
So if 0 is a point on the globe what is the Antipode of 0? And if a
triangle on the globe which
is an Elliptic triangle has
an antipodal Hyperbolic triangle where the two joined dissolve into a
new triangle that is Euclidean
triangle, then is there a 0 podal and negative 0 antipodal?

So can we have something like this ever in mathematics where we have
2.71^(-0) = (-1)

That surely would be the easiest solution to the Euler Identity, but
is it justified?

Now in Reals we can probably prove by mathematics that you cannot have
a (-0). But the
picture is altogether different for P-adics when you define positive P-
adics and negative P-adics
as I have done in this texbook by using Elliptic and Hyperbolic
geometry for models. In Reals,
the negatives are separated from the positives by one number which is
neither positive
or negative. But does that hold for P-adics? I think not and I think I
can drive a good case for
two types of 0 number in P-adics.

I hate the term &quot;cop-out&quot; and there really is no other term that
embodies the concept
of taking the easy way out when hard pressed for any solution. Sad
that English
does not have a term for that concept and where alot of words have to
be used

of the
Euler Identity. By this I mean where we multiply each digit of pi and
(e) and (i)
and after all the multiplication the final result is (-1). I have a
solution for the
Euler Identity but it is not pleasant and would seem like a &quot;trick&quot; to
anyone who
has tried to solve the Euler Identity with a digit by digit

For those just joining this discussion, the Euler Identity is one of
the most famous
mathematical equations and a solution to it would clarify not only
mathematics
but physics. Giving the deeper meaning of the Euler Identity, (e) ^
(pi)(i) = (-1)
ranks as high in mathematics as giving the deeper meaning of the fine-
structure
constant in physics.

On and off I have tried tackling Euler Identity. But I think I have
reached the near-endpoint
of my journey, and it is a great surprize to me as to this ending. It
is nothing I expected.
But Numbers and especially Geometry arguments are evidence in support

I want to add something about that Absolute Temperature Scale that
Kelvin
is. What makes it Absolute in all senses, is that 0 Kelvin has the
Physical
Meaning of &quot;no motion&quot;. And the 1 degree Kelvin begot from 2.71 K
raised
to the exponent of 0 gives the temperature of 1 degree Kelvin and that
has
Physical meaning since 2.71^0 comes from the smallest Blackbody cavity
of the inside of an atom. You cannot get any atomic blackbody cavity
smaller
than 2.71^0 temperature. So you have Absolute Zero and Absolute 1
degree
and this makes Kelvin the Absolute Temperature Scale and all other

&gt; where London exists has a antipode geographical point on the opposite
&gt; side of the globe.
&gt; So if 0 is a point on the globe what is the Antipode of 0? And if a
&gt; triangle on the globe which
&gt; is an Elliptic triangle has
&gt; an antipodal Hyperbolic triangle where the two joined dissolve into a
&gt; new triangle that is Euclidean
&gt; triangle, then is there a 0 podal and negative 0 antipodal?

&gt; So can we have something like this ever in mathematics where we have
&gt; 2.71^(-0) = (-1)

&gt; That surely would be the easiest solution to the Euler Identity, but
&gt; is it justified?

&gt; Now in Reals we can probably prove by mathematics that you cannot have
&gt; a (-0). But the
&gt; picture is altogether different for P-adics when you define positive P-
&gt; adics and negative P-adics
&gt; as I have done in this texbook by using Elliptic and Hyperbolic
&gt; geometry for models. In Reals,
&gt; the negatives are separated from the positives by one number which is
&gt; neither positive
&gt; or negative. But does that hold for P-adics? I think not and I think I
&gt; can drive a good case for
&gt; two types of 0 number in P-adics.
">

I am going to offer a geometrical argument that says the Euler
Identity
is (e)^(-0) and a number raised to the (-0) is (-1). I am making this
argument as brief as possible.

The numbers (pi) and (e) are actually not numbers at all. They should
have been
called &quot;imaginary&quot; but that term was saved for (i). Pi and (e) are
numbers which
have holes in them some distance out on their digit place value. And
once the hole is
reached, their are no digits there and beyond. Pi and (e) are growing
numbers for
they are not complete. That is why they are called transcendental and
are not a root
to a polynomial. A synonym for transcendental is incomplete. If a
meeting were called
where only grown-ups (those over 21 years age) are allowed to attend
then a 10 year
old would not be a member of that group. Likewise, both pi and (e) are
not grown
numbers. The Algebraic numbers are completed numbers. So pi and (e)
are not
numbers and are imaginary. But that is no loss, because pi and (e) are
never needed
since we always use the Rational number approximation that fits our
purpose for the
moment. So pi and (e) were never needed since we use approximations to
however
close we want.

The imaginary number (i) was badly named also since it exists in P-
adics such as
the two 5-adic square roots of (-1). So the Euler Identity really has
just two bona fide
numbers of (i) and (-1). Where pi and (e) can be represented by
decimal approximations.

The P-adics are geometrically represented as the points on a sphere
where the 10-adics
forms one great-circle or lines of longitude. The numbers 0, 1, 2,
3, ....., out to
.....999998, .....99999 form a semicircle of this great circle. If we
start the North
Pole as 0 then one unit back from the South Pole would be the
number .....99999.
The South Pole, since it is the antipode of the North Pole which is 0,
then the South
Pole would be (-0) and the next unit number from (-0) is -....00001,
then -.....0002
and on and on until we reach one unit back from the North Pole and
this number
is -.....99999

Now that geometry model is pretty certain to be true because it gives
both Elliptic geometry in on semisphere and Hyperbolic geometry in the
other semisphere
or hemisphere. And when you join a triangle from one semisphere to the
antipode
triangle in the opposite semisphere, that the concave outward triangle
joined to the
concave inward triangle cancels one another leaving a flat plane
Euclidean triangle.

In Euclidean geometry you needed only one 0 point and can go from
positive Reals to
Negative Reals by just one 0 which was neither positive nor negative
but neutral.

In P-adics which forms Elliptic and Hyperbolic geometry, you are
required or forced
to have two zeroes where one is positive and the other is negative. In
Euclidean
geometry zero is special for it separates positive from negative. In
Elliptic and Hyperbolic
geometry, since they coexist as semispheres require two zeroes.

So, in the Euler Identity we have two objects which are not numbers at
all since they
have holes in themselves. So how can you multiply pi by (i) when
somewhere out in
those place values, a hole will appear and no digits exist beyond that
hole? So, now
(i) in P-adics since it is Algebraic it is a completed number and has
digits in all of its
place value. So what happens when you multiply a number like (pi) that
has holes
in it once a certain place value is reached, and multiply it with (i)
that has digits in
all of its place-values? Well, and here is the cop-out, when you
multiply a number
with holes in it out to infinity then the product is 0. And it is the
P-adic (-0).

So at this point in the Euler Identity we have (e) ^ (-0) and since in
Reals we
know that (e)^0 is equal to 1, then by symmetry (e)^(-0) is (-1).

Can can illustrate this by the geometry that if one starts at the
North Pole +0 and
walks the longitude in one direction will end up at ....999999 and one
unit short of
the South Pole whereas if this same person had started at the North
Pole and
walked ....99999 in the opposite direction will end up at -....999999
one unit distance
short of the South Pole which is -0.

Alternative argument: I could argue instead of saying that (pi) a
number with holes
in it multiplied by a P-adic ends up as 0, instead I could argue that
-0 is (i) and that
every P-adic, whether 10-adic or 5-adic has -0 as (i). Normally we
think that square
root of (-1) is (i), but noone has investigated whether (i) for P-
adics is (-0). I say this
because there are no 1-adics, nor are there any 0-adics. The adics
start with
the 2-adics. So is not +0 and -0 imaginary numbers in P-adics?

And has anyone really fully explored the Euler Identity, that the (i)
is from Reals
or whether the imaginary number (i) is beckoning and harking on the
imaginary
P-adic. So that it is 0 and (-0) that is imaginary to the P-adics.

I am letting geometry do most of the driving.

P.S. I am more comfortable with the (-0) as the (i) in Euler's
Identity then the
argument that multiplying (pi) by (i) yields (-0).

Long time since I looked at the Roots of Unity. I am looking at them
now to try to
have a feel or sense of what is &quot;imaginary&quot; for P-adics.

Roots of Unity
(e)^2(pi)(i)k/n = 0

The Euler Identity is a special case of the Roots of Unity, n=2.

What I am looking for is where P-adics falter, or are so primitive
that those
numbers are really imaginary. We never realized they were imaginary
because
we saw the P-adics as extensions of the Reals.

I think I spotted the problem. P-adics really does not start until 2,
for there is no
0-adics nor 1-adics.

In Reals, we find out what is the imaginary number since it prevents
or halts us
from Completing the Reals with respect to Algebra. Since there is no
square root
of -1, the algebra on Reals is incomplete. So we tack a new number and
call it
imaginary (i) equal to the square root of (-1).

But noone ever went over to the P-adics and wondered if there was an
imaginary
number to be tacked on so that the P-adics were complete. I have a
suspicion that
0 is imaginary to P-adics and obviously the other P-adics can not be
built without
there being a 0.

I am looking at the Roots of Unity in this regard, as to whether 0 is
assumed and
imaginary.

Also, I  should use (e)^2pi(i) = 1 as per the Roots of Unity so that
all I now need
is simply (e)^0 = 1

So how do I get that zero? Does it come from pi? Although pi has holes
in it and is not
a number, still we substitute the rational sequence that approximates
pi.

Rather than think (pi) can turn into 0, I am going to focus on (i) as
the last hurdle.

Does the Roots of Unity or the Euler Identity say anything about
whether (i) comes
from Reals of square root of (-1) or is there latitude in what (i)
is?? Is there enough
latitude in where (i) comes from, such that the (i) is coming from P-
adics and is not
a square root of -1 but rather instead is the 0 in P-adics?

I would rather trust that.

The (i) in Roots of Unity or in Euler Identity is probably the
imaginary number in the P-adics
which would be the number 0. So instead of the i-axis and the cos and
sin theta, that
the i-axis is a line of longitude on the P-adic sphere and where there
is no 0, so 0
is imaginary in P-adics but essential. So we append 0.

And thus the Euler Identity written per Roots of Unity (e)^2(pi)(i) =
1

where (i) equals 0

hence we have (e)^2(pi) (0) =1

finally we have (e) ^0 =1
and that is certainly true.

But I need to research deeper into the claim that the (i) of Roots of
Unity and
Euler's Identity is really begging for the imaginary number in P-
adics.

Not true.

In some cases, the number is already there. If you look at the
polynomial x^2 + 1, then this polynomial has a root in the p-adics iff
there is an integer k such that
(k^2 + 1) is a multiple of p. (This is due to Hensel's Lemma.) So
there is an &quot;i&quot; in the 2-adics, 5-adics, 13-adics, etc., but not the 3-
adics, 7-adics, 11-adics, etc.

Since Hensel's Lemma requires p to be prime, I can't tell whether
there is an i in the 4-adics, 6-adics, 8-adics, etc., or not, at the
moment.

So once again, AP has missed something he was told about.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Great. -1 = i^2 = 0^2 = 0, so, adding 1 to both sides, 0 = 1. The
blatant contradiction, which means something is wrong.

I have finally solved Euler's Identity and it is cause for breaking
out the champagne for this is the first
time a human has understood Euler's Identity.

In Reals, which are infinite rightward strings with finite portion
leftwards needs an
imaginary number when all is said and done because of a equation that
is not
fulfilled the equation is

Square root of -1 equals something. In order for the operations in
Reals to be
completed there must be such a number for Reals so we just give it a
symbol and
call it &quot;i&quot;.

In P-adics, which are infinite leftward strings with finite portion
rightwards also
is a completed system but has a missing number and is imaginary to the
total
system.  P-adics forms the Elliptic and the Hyperbolic geometries
where the
semisphere or hemisphere is Elliptic geometry of concave outward and
joined
by the other or antipode semisphere which is concave inward and when
you join
a triangle from one semisphere with its antipodal triangle, in the
process of joining
the concaveness of one cancels the concave of the other and you end up
with a
Euclidean flat geometry triangle. What I am saying is that 0 is
foreign and alien
to P-adics and is the IMAGINARY number in P-adics that square root of
-1 is foreign
and alien in Reals.

The Roots of Unity and the Euler Identity were never written for the
Reals. They
were written for the P-adics and the (i) in P-adics is 0.

Counting Numbers are finite rightwards and finite leftwards. That
means the
Counting Numbers are fantasy and do not exist. So where do the
Counting
Numbers exist? Well, not in Reals because they are finite leftwards
and we know
the prime numbers are infinite. So the only place where Counting
Numbers exist
is in P-adics which has infinite string leftwards. So the Roots of
Unity and Euler's
Identity was not written for Reals but written for P-adics.

Reals are the geometry of Euclidean geometry where the number 0 is a
natural
native borne individual. Flat geometry means 0 curvature. In P-adics
the geometry
is both Elliptic and Hyperbolic where one is all negative numbers and
the other is
all positive numbers so where does 0 fit in either Elliptic or
Hyperbolic geometry?
It fits nowhere since all positive numbers are positive curvature and
not 0 curvature
and all negative numbers are negative curvature and not 0 curvature.
So 0 is
foreign and alien to P-adics and thus is Imaginary in P-adics. But
zero must be appended
to the P-adics in order to even sequence the numbers that constitute
the P-adics.

So P-adics have an imaginary number and it is 0. The P-adics start
with the most
primitive P-adic being 1-adics which is simply the number 1 in P-
adics, then the
full and robust 2-adics. But we did not start with the 0-adics because
there is no 0
and 0 is Imaginary.

What is pi and (e) in P-adics? That is a good question. Well it
happens that a sphere
surface has an infinity of pi. You see, on the surface of a sphere pi
is no longer a
constant for a circle on the surface of a sphere makes pi a variable.
In one circle
on a sphere the pi for that circle is smaller than the pi for a
different circle. And since
pi is variable for the circles on a sphere surface the value of (e) in
P-adics is also
variable. So the Roots of Unity and Euler Identity in P-adics becomes

y^2(z)(i) = 1

and the simple solution for that is (i) = 0

So the Euler Identity was wrapped in mystery, beautiful mystery simply
because
noone understood that it was an equation that belonged solely with P-
adics and
had nothing to do with Reals.

The Euler Identity is no longer a mystery because the equation Y^0 = 1
is no mystery at all. Any number raised to a zero power equals 1.

So the Euler Identity of (e)^2(pi)(i) = 1 is merely a fancier way of
writing
(e)^0 = 1

Everyone, including myself, have spent a long time in trying to
unravel the Euler
Identity mystery. Well, here it is finally. And it does teach us
something. It teaches
us that we can be looking madily for an answer when all we had to do
was ask
some better questions. Is this Identity embedded in Reals? Or is this
Euler Identity
embedded in P-adics?

This textbook is proud to say it was solved for the first time and for
a international audience.

The Euler Identity is no more than the fact that 0 is an imaginary
number in P-adics
and that the Euler Identity is just a fancier equation of this
equation z^0 = 1.

Now, let us go out and break out a bottle of champagne and even a
steak dinner.
Atom!

P.S. maybe I should keep these above posts with mistakes and all in
all future
editions as a example of the creative discovery process that goes on
in
mathematics.

&gt; there is no 0
&gt; and 0 is Imaginary.

&gt; What is pi and (e) in P-adics? That is a good question. Well it
&gt; happens that a sphere
&gt; surface has an infinity of pi. You see, on the surface of a sphere pi
&gt; is no longer a
&gt; constant for a circle on the surface of a sphere makes pi a variable.
&gt; In one circle
&gt; on a sphere the pi for that circle is smaller than the pi for a
&gt; different circle. And since
&gt; pi is variable for the circles on a sphere surface the value of (e) in
&gt; P-adics is also
&gt; variable. So the Roots of Unity and Euler Identity in P-adics becomes

&gt; y^2(z)(i) = 1

&gt; and the simple solution for that is (i) = 0

&gt; So the Euler Identity was wrapped in mystery, beautiful mystery simply
&gt; because
&gt; noone understood that it was an equation that belonged solely with P-
&gt; adics and
&gt; had nothing to do with Reals.

&gt; The Euler Identity is no longer a mystery because the equation Y^0 = 1
&gt; is no mystery at all. Any number raised to a zero power equals 1.

&gt; So the Euler Identity of (e)^2(pi)(i) = 1 is merely a fancier way of
&gt; writing
&gt; (e)^0 = 1

&gt; Everyone, including myself, have spent a long time in trying to
&gt; unravel the Euler
&gt; Identity mystery. Well, here it is finally. And it does teach us
&gt; something. It teaches
&gt; us that we can be looking madily for an answer when all we had to do
&gt; was ask
&gt; some better questions. Is this Identity embedded in Reals? Or is this
&gt; Euler Identity
&gt; embedded in P-adics?

&gt; This textbook is proud to say it was solved for the first time and for
&gt; a international audience.

&gt; The Euler Identity is no more than the fact that 0 is an imaginary
&gt; number in P-adics
&gt; and that the Euler Identity is just a fancier equation of this
&gt; equation z^0 = 1.

&gt; Now, let us go out and break out a bottle of champagne and even a
&gt; steak dinner.

&gt; P.S. maybe I should keep these above posts with mistakes and all in
&gt; all future
&gt; editions as a example of the creative discovery process that goes on
&gt; in
&gt; mathematics.

In life, we often do not celebrate our achievements enough, but rather
go on to start
climbing another mountain and make more progress and order.

But I am going to celebrate this victory quite a bit. Not only with
champagne and
steak but more.

Hindsight is always 20/20 and why did I not start this journey of the
Euler Identity
in the mid 1990s with a better starting question. The better starting
question was
this. Is there any number that would solve the equation

(e)^2(pi)(i) = 1

quick and easily? Of course one of my troubles along that journey was
that I kept
looking at (e)^(pi)(i) = (-1) which kept me distracted. One of the
reasons I loved that
equation is because the charge of an electron is (-1).

But if I had concentrated on (e)^2(pi)(i) = 1 for those years, would I
have solved it faster?
Well that is all spilled beans now.

There is a quick and easy solution to the above Euler Identity and
that is the better
question I should have asked in 1995. That the above equations
resemble e^0 =1.

Now that I know it all, another question I should have applied in 1995
was the reverse
of what is the easiest and quickest solution, was &quot;what is a proof
that no combination
of numbers substituting for e,pi, and i could solve Euler's Identity
except for either pi
or i to equal 0. In other words, a proof existed in 1995 that no
infinite digit strings for
e,pi, and i exists which can solve Euler's Identity except for either
pi or i being 0.

So I can see how sadly I wasted so much time in ever thinking that
some number for
(i) of its digit string such as ......99999999 was going to work with
3.14159...... and
2.71828...... If I had been wiser in 1995, I would have sat down and
proved that no digit
strings works for e,pi,i except when (i) is zero.

But that is life, and the important thing is the journey. And
sometimes we are blessed
with a pretty victory.

I should summarize this victory and spell out the logical steps.

We defined all numbers as either Reals with infinite strings rightward
and finite portion leftwards or
P-adics as infinite strings leftward and finite portion rightwards. So
all possible digit
arrangements if either infinite strings rightward or leftward includes
all Numbers. And
we see that the Reals are the intrinsic coordinate numbers for
Euclidean Geometry
and that P-adics and negative P-adics are the intrinsic coordinate
numbers of a sphere
which the semisphere is Elliptic geometry and the antipodal semisphere
is Hyperbolic
geometry.

Now we are presented with the famous Euler Identity of e^2(pi)(i) = 1
and our task or chore or job is to find what the digit strings of e,
pi and i
that solve that equation.

We know in Reals that pi = 3.14159...... and we know in Reals that
(e) = 2.71828...... and we define (i) as the square root of (-1). But
the job
is to find the digit string for (i) and (pi) and (e) that end up with
equaling 1.

So if we replace the equation as 2.71828.... ^ 2 (3.14159.....) (i) =
1
we are finished except for revealing the digit arrangement of (i).

So the above is all Reals for the Euler Identity, but we say we are
free
to use not only Reals for e,pi, i but to use P-adics and negative-P-
adics.
In other words, we do not restrict ourselves in anyway, shape or form.
All
we want to do is list what the infinite string of digits for (e), (pi)
and (i) are
so that they equal 1.

Now, here, it can be proven that there exists only one string of
digits that
can satisfy the Euler Identity and that is the zero string or ......
000000
where the zero string is in the exponent. That implies either pi is 0
or
(i) is zero. There are no other solutions for the Euler Identity
except for the
exponent being 0.

So, the question then becomes, which is zero? Is it (pi) or is it (i)?
Remember
we allowed the numbers to be either Reals or P-adics (both positive
and negative
P-adics). Pi is a constant in Reals as 3.14159.... but (pi) in
Elliptic or Hyperbolic
geometries (surface of sphere) is a variable. Can pi be zero? No.

Since (pi) cannot be zero, must mean that (i) is zero.

So now we have the Euler Identity looking like this, since (pi) can
vary and since
(pi) varies so also does (e) vary in P-adics. Let me call the (e)
variable as Y
and the pi variable as Z. So we have the Euler Identity as:

Y ^ 2 Z (i) = 1

So what number with its digits can satisfy that when Z as pi cannot be
0.
The answer is that (i) must be zero, for a number to the exponent 0 is
equal to 1.
Where we have Y^0 = 1.

So now we ask some more questions as to how can (i) be zero? Well it
cannot
be zero in Reals because imaginary (i) is the square root of (-1). So
we look over
to the positive and negative P-adics and ask if 0 is imaginary in the
P-adics?
And the answer is definitely yes according to geometry and the
sequencing of P-adics.
There is no zero in Elliptic geometry where the curvature is always a
positive number
greater than zero.  In Euclidean geometry the curvature is equal to 0.
In Elliptic
the curvature is greater than 0 and in Hyperbolic the curvature is
negative and thus
less than 0.  Explained in terms of the sequencing of P-adics, there
is no 0-adics,
and the 1-adics is only the number 1. The first full P-adics is the 2-
adics. So 0 is
a foreigner or alien number to P-adics just as square root of (-1) did
not exist in Reals.

So (i) never came from Reals and there exists square roots of (-1) in
P-adics. So the
imaginary number of (i) in Euler's Identity was never square root of
(-1) but was
0.

And the entire Euler Identity was a equation written where all of its
numbers are from
the P-adics, where the (e),  2 , (pi), (i) and 1 are all P-adic digit
strings where (pi)
and (e) are variables. If you want to allow freedom of using Reals for
these numbers,
is allowable, except for (i) which must be the P-adic (i) = 0.

And so, in the final analysis, the Euler Identity was merely a more
fancy way of
writing this equation Y^0 = 1

The bittersweet in all of this, is that anyone in 1995, could have
asked, what three
strings of numbers for pi, e, (i) will come out as 1? And the unique
answer is that
only with (i) = 0 does it work. Shame on me, that it took me 12 years
to conquer that
simple problem, which is simple in hindsight.

It is, it's -1.
e to the ipi/2 (90 deg) turns the vector 90 degrees just as sqrt(-1)

So e^ipi is an operator to be multiplied with any vector in the

Yes it helps. For it brings the two great Number Systems together into
focus. And it brings
the two together where Euler's Identity becomes *what is common to
both Systems*. The
old mathematics-- math prior to 1993 -- saw the world as only One
Number system where
p-adics and complex were extensions of Reals and where the Reals are
built from Counting
Numbers to Rationals to Irrationals and final Dedekind Cut to form
Reals. So the old-math
is a paucity of thought, never realizing that Reals are only 1/2 of
the Numbers.

The New Math realizes that Numbers come in two distinct types, either
Reals or P-adics
and the Reals form Euclidean Geometry and the P-adics form both
Elliptic and Hyperbolic Geometry.

So what are the Complex Numbers if Reals are only Euclidean Geometry?
Well, the Complex numbers
are nothing more than joining the P-adic-sphere to the Reals.

So what John is pointing out above if we eliminate the Complex
Numbers, do we eliminate anything?
No, of course not. We have eliminated nothing, because:

P-adics were the Complex Numbers adjoined onto the Reals.

John, if the world consists of 2 and only 2 types of Numbers as either
Reals or P-adics, as either
infinite rightwards or infinite leftwards. Is there any room for
Complex Numbers? Of course not.
The Complex Numbers were an adjoint of the P-adics before p-adics were
discovered.

The Euler Identity is solidly, 100 percent P-adics. (Pi) and (e) are
variables and exist in p-adics, and
(i) is natural in p-adics with such species as the 5-adic square roots
of (-1) and so is ....00002
and ......000001, except for .....00000000 which is imaginary in p-
adics. So the Euler Identity
was never really written for Complex and Reals but was written for P-
adics.

We do not have to throw out the window the Complex Numbers, do we,
because the Complex Numbers
never existed for they were a primitive-morph, or a mathematical
pregnancy that was never borne. The Complex
Numbers were always the P-adics.

John says above that the Euler Identity is a 180 degree rotation or -1
or (pi). That is all true John, but is
not in P-adics .....9999999 thought of as (-1) and is not .....9999999
the last number in P-dics that forms
a Semicircle of that line-of-longitude and thus 180 degrees.

In other words, John, the P-adics were the Complex Numbers but we did
not have the brilliancy to realize
that in the 20th century.

The Complex Numbers was a &quot;groping attempt&quot; to use the P-adics for the
P-adics were not discovered
and understood until 1993-2007.

This textbook throws the Complex Numbers on the trashpile and throws
them out the window, because
the Complex Numbers are nothing but a poorly developed P-adics.

Summary of why Complex are the P-adics. Euler Identity is a 180 degree
rotation where -1 is pi rotation
but this is the same as P-adics of .....999999 is (-1) and is the last
P-adic of a semicircle on a line of
longitude of a sphere. So the Complex Numbers were nothing more than a
borrowed time of what has
emerged as the P-adic Number System.

I do not like refering or even metaphoring to anything sexual. I do
not like to use the
terms pregnancy or groping etc etc so I need to find better analogies
in those spots
of the textbook. I am trying to write this book down to the level of a
bright 6 year old
and that means the removal of adult type of metaphors.

The reason I want alot of analogies and metaphors is quite
understandable in that they
are best rapid fire way of learning for laypersons. They are an
educational tool to be
used often.

When I write fast, I often leave in inappropriate metaphors which have
to be removed
in future editions of this textbook.

But the trouble with the term scaffolding is that I am afraid even the
brightest 6 year olds may not understand
scaffolding to build a theory and when the theory is built the
scaffolding no longer remains any of the
building structure itself and is removed. So in the same sense, the
Complex Numbers never existed
as numbers but were merely substitutes for the day to arrive when
humanity realized the P-adics were
the Complex Numbers all along.

I think old grown-ups with a bright 6 year old can teach their 6 year
old what scaffolding is. And thus the
Complex Numbers that the old fogey mathematics of the last several
centuries built was all scaffolding.

That the P-adics are what Complex Numbers are refering to. The
building and edifice that is Reals
exists and where square root of -1 as imaginary to Reals exists but
there are no Complex Numbers.
What there is whenever someone writes e^pi*i is that this is not a
Complex Number but a P-adic
number.

The old fogey mathematics is that any new number is seen as some sort
of extension of the Reals.
Well that sort of thinking is for decrepit minds. What numbers exist
should be answered by Quantum
Mechanics and how Quantum Mechanics begins its lessons. QM starts by
saying the world is dualistic
and that 2 things are in existence and they are particle and wave.
Likewise Math starts with 2 things
that exist-- Numbers and Geometry. As for Numbers, we repeat QM
existence in that 2 and only 2
types of Numbers exist and they are infinite strings rightward
(Reals), and infinite strings leftward (p-adics)

So how are Complex Numbers the same as P-adics? That is very simple to
answer given the last several
posts here. The P-adics are the numbers on a semisphere where the
other half of the sphere are
negative P-adics. The North Pole of this semisphere is the point
designated as 0 in P-adics but 0
is imaginary in P-adics and the line of longitude that goes through
the North Pole and ends at the
South Pole where the South Pole is (-0). The number one unit distance
away from the South Pole
is .....9999999 and we often think of this P-adic number as (-1).

So, what have we got here? We have the identical setup where pi is a
180 degree rotation from 0.
We have where e^pi(i) = -1 and we already know that .....9999999 is
viewed as (-1). So we have everything
that Complex Numbers had, only these are P-adics.

So what is Complex Numbers? They were premature hints of the P-adics.

What the Complex Numbers were in prior centuries were hints of what
they truly are--- the points of
Elliptic and Hyperbolic geometry as represented by the surface of a
sphere where the numbers are P-adics.

So, say goodbye to Complex Numbers for they were only a primitive
scaffolding and hint of the P-adics.

Now here is a pretty analogy of why Complex Numbers were so mysterious
but needed in both
mathematics and especially physics. And why no-one realized that
Complex Numbers are merely
the P-adics.

The Complex numbers were borne of a need for a square root of -1 in
order to make operations complete.
But the imaginary number for P-adics is also a number required in
order to even begin P-adics and here
the imaginary number is not a square root of -1 but the common number
of 0 itself. There is no zero
in P-adics and we have to attach it to the P-adics just as we attached
square root of -1 to Reals and
called it imaginary.

So along comes a beautiful equation by Euler of (e) ^ 2(pi)(i) = 1 and
everyone scrambling to make sense
of it, but unfortunately their binoculars were all wrapped into Reals
thinking that pi and e are Reals
in that equation and that (i) was square root of (-1). Never blinking
to think, wait a minute, perhaps
the (pi) and (e) and (i) of that equation are all numbers of P-adics.
That (i) in P-adics is not square
root of (-1) but is 0. And that pi and (e) in P-adics are variables.
For example the line of longitude
(and a grown up of a bright 6 year old and fetch the globe here), of
Greenwich which passes close
to London forms a semisphere of the Earth. So that huge circle has a
circumference and the diameter
of the Greenwich Longitude line is the semiEquator. So what is pi on
the surface of a sphere that
we take as Earth if Earth were a perfect sphere? And the answer is
that pi would be a value of 2
and not a value of 3.14159....... How is this possible? Because a
circle on the surface of a sphere
causes the value of pi to vary.

So when mathematicians of the past looked at Euler's Equation (or
Identity, whichever name you
want to call it) they thought the (i) was square root of -1 and that
the pi and e in that Euler Equation
were all numbers coming from the Reals. What would be to their
astonishment, even though they
never had P-adics extant is that the (i) is really the number 0.

Summary of the entire picture: I am going to try to make a stab at a
summary but may have to dwell
on specifics later. The major idea is that Complex Numbers are
essential to math and physics. And
if P-adics replaces them completely, then what is the summary picture
of this replacement? The idea
is this, I suspect, that whenever Complex Numbers are essential in
equations of math or physics
is because the geometry of that particular piece of Physics or
mathematics has escaped itself from
Euclidean geometry and is now in either Elliptic or Hyperbolic (or
both) geometries.

So that whenever Complex Numbers are used or needed in an essential
manner, then the mathematics
or physics is no longer in Euclidean Geometry, if it ever was in
Euclidean Geometry.

In the old days of old fogey mathematics with their talk of Complex
Numbers as if it were some rotation
in Euclidean Geometry and which baffled the minds of everyone as some
sort of hidden dimensions
that no-one could ever visualize. Well, all of that old fogeyness now
disappears and clarity and sunshine
comes forth. Whenever you use Complex in either Physics or Math, you
simply are trading away Euclidean
flat geometry for that of NonEuclidean geometry such as the surface of
a sphere. Your physics takes
place, or your mathematics takes place in Elliptic/Hyperbolic geometry
when you use Complex Numbers.

What is the French word for Goodbye? is it sail la vie, for it sound
poetic and sounds as if we are
sailing away. Bon Voyage.

Here is a fun way for me to spend a Saturday evening is explaining
what Hamilton's
Quaternions actually were.

I never realized that the quaternions in history came before the
vectors and cross
and dot products were a result of Hamilton's quaternions. Nor had I
realized that Maxwell
originally wrote his equations in quaternion form and was later
abandoned to the
vector format.

Anyway the Quaternions are noncommutative and we instantly know that
algebra on a sphere surface is noncommutative.

Hamilton's Quaternions are summarized as this:

i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1

where ij = k and ji = -k
jk = i and kj = -i
ki = j and ik = -j

So, now, with my recent new found knowledge that the Complex Numbers
are
simply numbers that are the coordinates of the Sphere where one
semisphere
is positive P-adics and the antipode-semisphere is negative P-adics
and where
the +P-adics is Elliptic Geometry and the -P-adics is Hyperbolic
Geometry.

Okay, my mission here is to say what exactly are the numbers of that
model sphere
are the i, j and k.

So I want to set up the sphere to be understandable to readers. I will
call the North Pole
the +0 of Elliptic Geometry and the +.....99999 as its last integer
and -0 as the
South Pole with (-).....999999 as the last integer of Hyperbolic
Geometry.

There is also the point in Elliptic Geometry of +....00001 and -....
000001 in
Hyperbolic.

And I will use the Greenwich Prime Meridian as the line of longitude.
I may have
to use the Equator great-circle line also and another longitude line
such as the
one that nearly goes through Paris and is the 2degree line. Anyway to
get a mental picture
before I jump onto this mission.

So my mission is to see what points of this model fulfills Hamilton's
Quaternions given
the new found knowledge that imaginaries and Complex numbers are
merely the P-adics
on the sphere surface.

Now keep in mind what are imaginaries in P-adics and they are +0 and
-0 or
the North Pole point and the South Pole point. And that sqrt-1 exists
in P-adics
as commonplace where any prime of form 4n+1 for n an integer

So now, in P-adics there are two sqrt-1 in 5-adics and we take the
sqrt-1 of
the 17-adics which are three different points on the sphere. And
connect those
points by great-circles forming a Elliptic triangle. Call those three
points as
i and j and k respectively and we can make a temporary definition of
multiplication
where ij would be the next vertex depending on whether clockwise or
counterclockwise.
as to whether the point is positive or negative.

So that satisfies all the above with perhaps a sticking point of ijk

In the last post I brought up the topic of Hamilton's quaternions and
also the concept of vectors with
the idea of multiplication.

You see, I have defined multiplication for P-adics in this textbook as
that of
similar to multiplication of Reals only where I take the digits that
do not change.

For example .......11109876543210. X ........100000100001000100101.
Would be this:
10x01
then
210x101
then
3210x0101
then
so on and so on

Until enough of a sequence emerges in which the digits in place values
no
longer change but remain the same in successive multiplications.

But now since I have the positive P-adics as a semisphere and the
negative
P-adics as the antipodal semisphere, I would like to define
multiplication over the
entire sphere, not just with two points on a semicircle which the
above example was
thereof. For in the P-adics, the 2-adics forms a unique longitude line
and the 3-adics
another unique longitude line.

But I would like to define multiplication of say a point in 2-adics
with a point in
3-adics. So is there some nice clean cut way of doing that? I would be
surprized if there was
none. And a problem that has begun to irritate me is this notion that
a -0 exists
in the same model as a +0 so what is -0 x +0 ?? So hopefully an answer
to that
may emerge.

What is multiplication in Euclidean geometry? Well, actually it is
forming squares
or rectangles when you multiply two numbers together you usually form
a rectangle.

So what is multiplication on the surface of a sphere which models both
Elliptic
and Hyperbolic geometry simultaneously? I suspect it is not the
forming of NonEuclidean
rectangles because the trouble lies in the fact that if you multiply
say
.....99998 by ......999999 the sphere does not accomodate such a huge
NonEuclidean
rectangle. Euclidean geometry multiplication can always accomodate the
product,
but with Elliptic geometry we face the problem of large numbers in a
multiplication
are too large to fit on the sphere and we come back around the globe
and retrace our
former steps.

So I guess here we have to ask what is a reasonable multiplication for
NonEuclidean
geometry such as a sphere surface?

I think I maybe have an answer. I think part of the problem is that I
want to have
all the various P-adics of 2-adics, 3-adics, 4-adics, 5-adics, ad
infinitum all represented
on each sphere as a line of longitude. Perhaps that is my mistake and
where
all spheres can only have one type of P-adics at a time. So that a
sphere may
have all lines of longitude and equator line as only 3-adics or only
10-adics.

So the multiplication of a point on the sphere with another point on
the sphere is all
done in one adic and not crossing different adics.

Now in this manner I do not need to have a multiplication for numbers
that lie in
different adics.

Now when we have the distance from London to Paris by a great circle
and want
to multiply that by 3, then it is a vector sum of three of those arcs.

So, now what is +0 x -0? This is like saying what is London multiplied
by Paris for
we do not have a reference point. When we ask for 3 X London to Paris
then
we have something to multiply.

More later, have to go for now

What I am trying to figure out here is whether multiplication on the
surface of one
sphere where it is a semisphere of +P-adics for Elliptic geometry and
the
antipodal semisphere of -P-adics for Hyperbolic geometry whether all
the p-adics
such as 2-adics, 3-adics, 4-adics, 5-adics ad infinitum are on each
and every
sphere or whether each sphere has only one kind of p-adic such as the
5-adic
sphere is separate and has only 5-adics compared to the 17-adic
sphere?

So this is the question I am grappling with now.

I have made tremendous progress to reach this point since I have
discovered these
items:

(1) world's finest model that models both Elliptic and Hyperbolic
geometry all on one
sphere as semispheres
(2) +P-adics for Elliptic geometry as a semisphere and -P-adics as a
antipodal
semisphere for Hyperbolic geometry
(3) Euler Identity is written in P-adics where (i) is imaginary but
(i) = 0
(4) there are two distinct zeroes in P-adics where there is +0 and -0
(5) ....99999 is the last and largest Infinite Integer in +P-adics
and(-).....99999 is
the last and largest Infinite Integer in -P-adics
(6) there is a bridge between Reals and P-adics and it is through the
Euler
Identity where the bridge itself is the imaginary number in Reals is
sqaure root
of (-1) and the imaginary numbers in P-adics is +0 and -0  where one
is the North
Pole and other is South Pole. And through this imaginary number bridge
we have
the Euler Identity of (e)^2(pi)(i) = 1 and through this bridge we see
that the Complex
Numbers were merely the P-adics all along

So alot of progress has been made, but now I am focused on cross-
multiplication
of say 5-adics with 17-adics and are the P-adics layed out on every
sphere or is every
individual sphere accomodate only one type of P-adic at a single time?

The meaning of multiplication in Euclidean geometry of 2nd dimension
is area, when
two different numbers (Reals) are multiplied then a rectangle is
produced which has
an area. If three numbers are involved then 3rd dimension Euclidean
geometry where
a rectangular solid is produced and volume is the final answer. So
Euclidean
geometry has a specific meaning for multiplication.

But when we look for meaning of multiplication for P-adics between 5-
adics and
17-adics, can we obtain a meaningful multiplication. Does a sphere
surface covered
in P-adics have a meaning for multiplication? What would we expect the
meaning
of multiplication for points on a sphere that are the coordinate
points of that sphere.

We can try to answer that question by looking at the Earth globe and
how it is layed
out in its lines of longitude and Equator. We can get a distance from
London to
Paris as a arc of a great-circle and multiply that arc by another
number.

But the trouble is with large numbers there is not enough Earth and we
make circuits
around the Earth.

So I suspect that Multiplication for P-adics has to restrict each
sphere to only one
specific kind of P-adic where one sphere is all 5-adics and another is
all 17-adics.
In this way, a multiplication of any two 5-adics will not exceed ....
44444444
and will not make circuits around the sphere but stay confined to the
+5-adic
semisphere.

I have the feeling that multiplication in P-adics is not area or
volume, nor is it arc-length
such as 3 x the arc length of London to Paris. I have the feeling that
multiplication
in P-adics is more to do with the concept of *Quantity* and not with
that of geometrical
area. So in this view, multiplying a 5-adic by a 17-adic, is like
asking to multiply the
arc length of a line of longitude on the surface of Jupiter with a arc
length of a
line of longitude on the surface of Earth.

The opinion I am beginning to gather is that a specific sphere has
only one type of
P-adic as its lines of longitude and Equator such as all of them as 5-
adics and not
my previous idea that every p-adic of 2-adic, 3-adics, 4-adic, ad
infinitum is represented
on every sphere. Maybe I am wrong here and that every sphere can
accomodate all
the P-adics. But for now it looks to be not so.

AP's newfound knowledge is that if x^2 = -1, then x = 0, which he

only have no quaternions other than the real numbers.

Gee, that was easy. Maybe I'll dash off a proof and send it to the

I think I found out the answer to my problem of multiplication of a 5-
adic with a 17-adic. In Euclidean
geometry, multiplication is an area for 2nd dimension and a volume for
3rd dimension. In Elliptic and
Hyperbolic geometry, multiplication is a angle product.

The Euler Identity confirms this. We see that the Euler Identity is a
180 degree rotation with (pi)
and where we have (-1) and in P-adics we have .....9999999 is seen as
(-1).

So in other words, numbers in Reals when multiplied ends up as area,
and in P-adics which are
the coordinate system of a sphere, the multiplication product ends up
as an angle.

So, if we take .....99999 in 10-adics and multiply by ......66666 in 7-
adics our final answer is
the angle 2(pi) or 360 degrees where vector cross product.

Here the trouble will be to find out what each P-adic number,
regardless of what base it comes from
what angle it represents. But I suppose the Euler Identity can
identify what angle corresponds to
what individual P-adic.

It would be interesting to know what number in 10-adics is 90 degrees
and what number is 270
degrees.

And the problem of figuring out the Equator line compared to lines of
longitude since the
Equator is twice as long as the semispheres of lines of longitude.

All in all, the above implies that each sphere can accomodate only one
specific P-adic, not
where every p-adic has a line of longitude in every sphere. So all
lines of longitude and Equator
of a specific sphere is one particular P-adic. So that the 5-adics are
on one sphere and the
17-adics on a different sphere. Now to multiply a 5-adic by a 17-adic
the answer will end up
as a angle from 0 degree to 360 degree.

This is the true #36 for I duplicated the last post.

Earlier in this textbook I defined multiplication in P-adics as
similar to
Reals and take what digits do not change in place value.

However, now that I am on this idea that multiplication in P-adics has
more
to do with angle than with anything else, I may have to revise the
definition.

My prior definition would take the number .....3333333 X ....0000003
as being equal to the largest integer ......9999999
But if we analyze those numbers as angles it is really saying 60
degrees
X an angle smaller than 1 degree is equal to an angle nearly 180
degrees.
When we multiply a 60 degree angle with a 1 degree angle we would
expect
due to vector cross product that the angle is about 61 degrees, not
180 degrees.

So I may toss out my earlier definitions of multiplication and end up
with this angle
addition as the multiplication of P-adics.

Now in the previous post I outlined how one multiplies a number on a 5-
adic
sphere with a number on a 7-adic sphere and ends up with a addition-
angle.
But the first question I have is why would anyone ever need to define
multiplication
of a point on one sphere with a point on a different sphere? So maybe
such a thing
is pointless (forgive the pun) in the first place. But maybe
mathematics and physics
may have some need for such a thing. Perhaps if two different spheres
are in contact
with one another, there maybe a need for multiplying a point on one
and a point
on the other. Many times in physics, some math is created that looks
of no use to
physics but later finds its use.

Now in P-adics, what would be the half of ....99999999 and would it be
90 degrees?
So maybe I need to define division on P-adics as the same as division
on Reals
and the answer is going to be those digits which remain the same in
place value.
So,
1/2 of 9 is 4.5
then
1/2 of 99 is 49.5
then
1/2 of 999 is 499,5
then
1/2 of 9999 is 4999.5

And so the answer as to ....99999 divided by 2 is the Infinite
Integer  4....99999

Now I must say something here about this number for it is very strange
from
all the other numbers written about so far in this book. It is an
Infinite Integer and
thus an infinite string leftwards. So the 9s never end, but it has a
digit 4 instead of
a digit 9.

So the Infinite Integer ......999999 has all its digits as 9, but
4....9999999
is the same as ....9999999 except for one of its digits is 4.

Now some philosophers would interrupt and say such a number is
nonexistent.
I would retort by saying I defined Infinite Integers as &quot;all possible
digit arrangement&quot;
and this number of 4.....999999 is one possible digit arrangement.
Also the idea
that if the above is not an Infinite Integer, are we to say that the P-
adic .....999999
has no number which is 1/2 thereof?

And now, what is the angle of 45 degrees if 180 degrees is ....99999
and 90 degrees is 4....999999 ? Again, dividing 4...99999 by 2

So,
1/2 of 49  is 24.5
then
1/2 of 499 is 249.5
then
1/2 of 4999 is 2499,5
then
1/2 of 49999 is 249999.5

So the answer is the Infinite Integer 24....999999 which would be 45
degrees

So the 10-adics would have ....99999 as 180 degrees and 4...99999 as
90
degrees and 24....999999 as 45 degrees.

Now back to my earlier comment that it is unreasonable to think
that ....33333
multiplied by ....0000003 should be equal to ....99999999 in 10-adics
since
.....000003 is not even a full 1 degree whereas ....999999 is 180
degrees
and where ....33333 is 30 degrees.

So, unless I can incorporate both the definition of multiplication
with angle measure,
then I will eventually have to drop one of those definitions. At this
moment, it looks
like I should keep the angle idea and drop the idea of (similar to
Real multiplication).
But then another problem arises in that addition has to be re-defined
as per angle,
and since multiplication is angle summation, what is addition since
adding angles
is already taken up.

&gt; is the same as ....9999999 except for one of its digits is 4.

&gt; Now some philosophers would interrupt and say such a number is
&gt; nonexistent.
&gt; I would retort by saying I defined Infinite Integers as &quot;all possible
&gt; digit arrangement&quot;
&gt; and this number of 4.....999999 is one possible digit arrangement.
&gt; Also the idea
&gt; that if the above is not an Infinite Integer, are we to say that the P-
&gt; adic .....999999
&gt; has no number which is 1/2 thereof?

&gt; And now, what is the angle of 45 degrees if 180 degrees is ....99999
&gt; and 90 degrees is 4....999999 ? Again, dividing 4...99999 by 2

&gt; So,
&gt; 1/2 of 49  is 24.5
&gt; then
&gt; 1/2 of 499 is 249.5
&gt; then
&gt; 1/2 of 4999 is 2499.5
&gt; then
&gt; 1/2 of 49999 is 249999.5

&gt; So the answer is the Infinite Integer 24....999999 which would be 45
&gt; degrees

&gt; So the 10-adics would have ....99999 as 180 degrees and 4...99999 as
&gt; 90
&gt; degrees and 24....999999 as 45 degrees.

&gt; Now back to my earlier comment that it is unreasonable to think
&gt; that ....33333
&gt; multiplied by ....0000003 should be equal to ....99999999 in 10-adics
&gt; since
&gt; .....000003 is not even a full 1 degree whereas ....999999 is 180
&gt; degrees
&gt; and where ....33333 is 30 degrees.

&gt; So, unless I can incorporate both the definition of multiplication
&gt; with angle measure,
&gt; then I will eventually have to drop one of those definitions. At this
&gt; moment, it looks
&gt; like I should keep the angle idea and drop the idea of (similar to
&gt; Real multiplication).
&gt; But then another problem arises in that addition has to be re-defined
&gt; as per angle,
&gt; and since multiplication is angle summation, what is addition since
&gt; adding angles
&gt; is already taken up.
">

Sometimes in math and life, the easiest solution is the correct one.
Maybe that
applies here. The idea is that addition in P-adics involves the angles
that
are represented by the number so the addition of say ....999999 + ....
000001
is not what was formerly thought as equaling 0 but that the above
addition
would be a little closer to the 180 degree mark.

In 10-adics we think of ....999999 as equal to (-1) but I think of it
as one unit
short of 180 degrees. So it is very close to 180 degrees but not equal
to 180 degrees
and the 10-adic of .....000001 is what we call 1.0000..... in Reals.
But the 10-adic
....000001 as a angle is microscopically far away from even 1 degree.
So the
addition of .....999999 + .....000001 in 10-adics as a angle
definition would be
that you have less than 180 degrees added with a angle that is so tiny
that it
is almost immeasurable and the summation is closer to 180 degrees but
not quite
there.

And the definition of multiplication in P-adics is the similar to
Reals and we use
the digits that stop changing. So that we have .....999999 X .....
0000002
as equal to .....99999998

Now I wonder if that connects with other branches of mathematics such
as the
Euler Identity and trigonometry, where you have multiplication like
Reals but
you have addition as ANGLES added.

This makes sense because in Euclidean geometry you have addition that
is
with numbers but where multiplication is area and that is geometrical.
In P-adics
we reverse that in which multiplication is like Reals and regular
multiplication but the
addition turns strange in that it is angles added.

I made some mistakes in previous posts as to what is 60 and 30 degrees
in 10-adics. It was late
at night when I should have went to sleep. So will spend this post in
just summarizing what some angles
are in 10-adics.

....99999999 is nearly or approximately 180 degrees. It is not fully
180 degrees because the arc from
North Pole to South Pole is a full 180 degrees. The number ....999999
in 10-adics is one unit shy or
away from the South Pole and thus is almost 180 degrees, and close
enough to be called 180 degrees
Maybe we can use a new symbol for approx

Dividing ....99999 by 2 gives us approx90 degrees and that is
4...99999

Dividing 4...9999 by 2 gives us approx45 degrees and that is 24...9999

My mistakes last night concerned what is 60 degrees and 30 degrees

If ....999999 is approx180 degrees then 1/3 of ....99999 would be
approx 60 degree

So that ....33333 is approx60 degrees

And that would leave ....666666 as approx 120degrees

Does that make sense?? What is 30 degrees then??

Well 1/2 of ....33333 is

So we take 1/2 of 33 which is 16.5
then
we take 1/2 of 333 which is 166.5
then
we take 1/2 of 3333 which is 1666.5

And so the 10-adic of 1...666 is approx 30 degrees

Now let us see if all is well here. If I add approx60 to approx30
degrees do the 10-adics
follow the same algebra?

So do I get 1...666 + ....333333 to equal that of 4....99999999 ????

Funny, maybe I ought to have my question marks in a p-adic string to
infinity!!!!

Well, I think I am alright in algebra here because we can say that ....
333333  which is approx60
degrees can be written as 3...333333

And now we do the algebra of addition and have

3...333333
+1...66666
gives us
4...99999 which is approx90 degrees

I tend to make more mistakes at night before going to bed than in the
morning after a full night
of sleep

In summary the situation looks like this:

9...9999999 is approx 180 degrees
8...8888888 is approx 80 percent of 180 degrees
7...77777 is approx 70 percent of 180 degrees
6...6666 is approx 60 percent of 180 degrees
5...5555 is approx 50 percent of 180 degrees where 4...9999 is the
closest approx to 90 degrees

So that 5...5555 is not far off from 4...9999

4...4444 is approx 40 percent of 180 degrees
3...3333 is approx 30 percent of 180 degrees
2...22222 is approx 20 percent of 180 degrees
1...1111 is approx 10 percent of 180 degrees

Now what is the degree angle for the transposed pi or e? Such as
these:
......951413r

and

....828172r

Well, to assign them an angle, the key feature is knowing what the
first digit is, for example
in ....999999 we can rewrite as 9.....999999. We cannot rewrite
transposed (pi) or (e) as such.
Nor can we rewrite the idempotents in 10-adics as such nor the square
roots of (-1) in 5-adics
as such.

Summary: so multiplication in Infinite Integers or P-adics becomes the
same traditional way of
multiplying in Reals where the digits that do not change in place
value is the answer. As for
addition in P-adics or Infinite Integers, things change drastically or
change alot in that addition
in P-adics is Angle sum.

Before I attempt to &quot;explain away&quot; Hamilton's quaternions I should do
some
historical research as to whatever possessed Hamilton to be looking
for such
creatures as quaternions? What in his academic environment of the
1830s
and 1840s of around the same time as Faraday, had Hamilton looking for
these mathematical entities? It seems like something totally out of
the blue.

And why he called them quaternions when there are only three is
another question.

But my anchor, I believe will fully answer Hamilton. My anchor is the
world's
finest model that has both Elliptic and Hyperbolic geometry all
contained on
one surface and that is the surface of a sphere, where the poles are
+0 and -0
respectively and Elliptic geom is a semisphere as +P-adics and the
Hyperbolic
geometry is the Antipodal semisphere as -P-adics. An anchor in math is
like
an anchor in everyday life such as a home and job. If one does not
have
a home and job, well, they are anchorless and can hardly do much
progress
or order for their lifetime. So what I have that Hamilton did not have
for Quaternions
is I have an anchor.

Now if we examine a sphere and the Earth globe will do as a suitable
analogy
and we pick four points on the Equator such that the four points are 0
degrees
and 90 degrees and 180 degrees and 270 degrees. And now, we need only
three of these four points, so we discard 0 degrees and keep 90 and
180 and
270 degrees. And now we draw a huge triangle shaped figure on the
globe
that connects with 90 and 180 and 270 degrees. These three points of
this
Elliptic triangle form vertices and it is these three points that
Hamilton
would call quaternions.

Hamilton's operation was multiplication but when it comes to vertices
of a triangle
in Elliptic geometry that multiplication becomes addition of angles.
So the three points of 90 and 180 and 270 degrees of this Elliptic
geometry
triangle were Hamilton's i and j and k.

Let me show you in the next post as I have something to attend to now.

It occurred to me today that the transposed (pi) and (e) can be
displayed in the other
way as follows:

314159........r

and

271828........r

In one display we have the smallest digits of transposed (pi) and in
the other way we have
the largest digits of transposed (pi). One help of the pi at infinity
as its last digit of *3* would
tell us that the (pi) angle is a 31 degree angle and the (e) angle is
a 27 degree angle, or
if we include Hyperbolic geometry of the antipodal semisphere then pi
is 314 degrees and
(e) is 271 degrees. So (pi) in this view is 56 degrees shy of
completing a circuit of the sphere
and (e) is 1 degree larger than the Hyperbolic right angle.

&gt; Let me show you in the next post as I have something to attend to now.
">

Basically Hamilton's quaternions obey these rules:

i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1

where ij = k and ji = -k
jk = i and kj = -i
ki = j and ik = -j

The triangle vertices I outlined are noncommutative.

But can I show where those vertices of 90 degree and 180 degree and
270 degree are (-1)?

Can I show that 10-adics, not just 5-adics and 4n+1 prime adics have a
square root of (-1)

I think so, and the reason I can do it is because I am the first to
rewrite P-adics where the
*infinite digit* is written first. So that ....9999999 is also
9....9999999 and 1/2 of 9....99999
is 49...9999999

Now notice what the square root of (-1) means in 5-adics algebra. It
arises because of the
idea of 49 and 50 where there is a -1 where 49-50 = -1 and 49 has a
square root of 7

So, examine this Infinite Integer or 10-adic:

5...000000000

Now that is a Infinite Integer and not to mistake it for .....00000005

Where 5...0000000 is one unit larger than 4.....999999999

Now 9....99999 is approx 180 degrees and 1/2 of 9....999999 is
4....99999 and this
number is angle approx 90 degrees.

Now the square root of 4....999999 is the square root of 49...99999
and thus we begin to
see that the 10-adics have at least two square roots of (-1) in the
form of 7....00000
and the square root of 9...99999 as that of 9...9999r9.

Because we can rewrite all P-adics as either a front loaded number at
the *infinity digit* or
we can load it from the rear tail end. The reason 5-adics square root
of (-1) were easily
begotten was because they are amenable to the tail end whereas the
square roots of (-1)
for 10-adics or 6-adics or 94-adics the square root of (-1) has to be
pulled from the front
end of the infinite string.

An interesting question that occurred is whether a p-adic has a limit
to how many square
roots of (-1) there are. Does 5-adics have only two? I would think
not, since noone bothered
to find the sqrt(-1) for front loaded 5-adics. So there maybe a
theorem here that says given
any P-adic, it has 2 and only 2 square roots of (-1). Or the theorem
may say that given
any P-adic, there is an upper bound to the number of square roots of
-1. Or it may even say
there is an infinite supply of sqrt (-1) for any given P-adic.

I do not remember when I first posted that P-adics could be front
displayed. I do remember
there were replies of outburst of skepticism and even mockery. Their
disgust and complaint
is that since the digits are an infinite string, that you cannot
display the &quot;point of infinity&quot;.

I can sympathize with their concerns for infinity is an &quot;endless
process&quot; so there is no end.
So how dare I say that .....99999999 is 9....9999999.

But I am pragmatic if nothing else. And the above has to be examined
as per pragmatism and as
per philosophy.

We all know that the digits of .....999999 are all 9s.

So here is the pragmatism. What is 1/2 of ....999999 and it is
4...9999999. An infinite string
which has all 9s except for one digit that is 4.

So the debate ends by saying that if I cannot display ....99999 as
9...99999 then there is no
midpoint of this number and that the number 4...999999 does not exist.

So I and my critics and skeptics have a choice. If 9...99999 does not
exist then its midpoint
of 4...99999 is also nonexistent. Which is the most repulsive? It is
more repulsive to think that
a arc has no midpoint.

Give me any Rational Infinite Integer or Rational P-adic and I can
display it front view and where
I can thence give you a midpoint of that number or give you 1/2 of
that number.

So pragmatism wins over any critic or skeptic.

I think I first introduced this front loaded display or presentation
around 1995. It is important because
it allows us so much more calculation ability and opens up a whole new
vista of mathematics to explore.

And also, it makes us aware that the 10-adic of ....999999 is not (-1)
but the largest 10-adic integer.

there are no negative p-adics, or composite-based ones,
nor is there any notion of valuation, since non-archimedean.

Gibb's change of the notation of quaternions,
did not change anything about their applications,
other than making inner &amp; outer products (Hamilton's terms)
into seperate operations.

you are such a long way from any workable definitions, yet
such a long way into your outline!

thus:
here's another one from my text, for the area,
very wellknown: twice the area of the trigon = abc/D,
D is the circumdiameter; what does the 2, mean?

the substitution, somewhere, above is,
second-power of the area of the trigon =
(a+b+c)(a+b-c)(a-b+c)(-a+b+c),
Heron's or Archimedes' formula; see,
it's a nice instantiation of the trilateral inequality
the value is always positive!

You shouldn't write a textbook until you have all the math taken care
of. AP hasn't done this. (After I &quot;fed him&quot; the equation

e^(2 pi i) = 1

and suggested taking logs, he fell for an old trick and concluded that
i = 0; this still makes me laugh. He's in the middle of a reducio ad

he has made an assumption which is false, and that all his &quot;work&quot;
since then is based on the (false) assumption that pi*i is real. He
might not discover it, either, and he didn't take the hint when I
pointed out that he'd discovered the equation

0 * 0 = -1

he's called it his &quot;greatest victory&quot;.)

&gt; &gt; There IS a substantial difference between 10-adics and other p-adics.
&gt; &gt; For instance, there is a square root of -1 in the 13-adics (by

Now keep in mind the Elliptic/Hyperbolic geometry Model to derive at
least FIVE, you count 'em,
square roots of (-1).

Model:

We have a sphere, think of the Earth globe as a sphere to make things
easier. The North Pole is +0
and South Pole is -0. The Equator marks out the semisphere of +P-adics
with North Pole and the
antipodal semisphere with South Pole as -P-adics. The positive
semisphere is Elliptic geometry
and the negative semisphere is Hyperbolic geometry. Whenever a
triangle is constructed in one
semisphere (hemisphere) it has a reverse concaveness in the other
hemisphere
and thus when putting the two opposite concave triangles together they
cancel
concaveness leaving behind Euclidean triangle. So the hemispheres are
Elliptic
versus Hyperbolic geometry.

Pay Attention to these three points of the Sphere:

Alright, I want five square roots of (-1) for three of them are going
to be
Hamilton's quaternions of i, j, k.

(1) Look at ....999999 or better written as 9...9999 as one candidate.
It lies one
unit distance away from the South Pole of -0.

(2) Look at (-).....00000001 and it lies one unit distance from -0 in
Hyperbolic geometry

(3) Look at (-) ....999999 or written as (-)9...99999 in Hyperbolic
geometry
and lies one unit distance away from the North Pole of +0

Remember Roots Operation in P-adics?

Well we want the square root of 9....999999

So we take sqrt 9 equals 3
then
we take sqrt 99 equals 9.9
then
we take sqrt 999 equals 31.6
then
we take sqrt 9999 equals 99.9
then
we take sqrt 99999 equals 316.22
then
we take sqrt 999999 equals 999.9
and so on

So our final answer as to the square root of ....99999 or 9...9999
has two answers of 9...9999r9 and 3162.....r

Now is 9...9999 the same as (-1)? I do not believe so, but those who
look at
P-adics with a myopic viewpoint say that ....999999 looks and acts
like as if it
were (-1) with their prejudice of thinking that p-adics are extensions
of Reals. I see
p-adics as altogether different from Reals and a rival of Reals. To
me, to say that
....99999 is (-1) is an error that a physicist who says a particle is
the same
thing as a wave makes. For this argument I will just go along with
their misconceptions
because the Hamilton quaternions and also the Euler Identity were
borne of the
idea that they were working with Complex Numbers when in reality they
were
working with P-adics and that there are no Complex Numbers since
Complex
Numbers are the P-adics.

So already I have two square roots of (-1) in the form of 9...9999r9
and
3162.....r of the number 9....999999 which is one unit distance from
the
South Pole. Now I jump across the South Pole of one unit distance and
I land
upon the point (-) ......0000001. I am now in Hyperbolic geometry
where multiplication
is the very same as in +P-adics however, since this is hyperbolic
geometry everything
ends up with a negative sign. So you multiply like normal but end up
putting a negative
sign in front of every number. This is Lobachevskian geometry and the
angle sum
of triangles is always less than 180 degrees and the curvature is
always negative
curvature.

So let us examine (-)....00001. Does it have a square root. Well,
obviously yes
for we take all Negative p-adics and operate as if they are positive
and at the end
we slap a negative sign on the answer. So the square root of 1 is 1
and now attach
the negative sign and we have the square root of (-)....00001 is
(-)....000001

So now I have three numbers in 10-adics that are the square root of
(-1).

Now I focus on the number (-)9.....999999 which lies one unit distance
from the
North Pole and I treat this number the same way as I found the square
roots of
9...99999 and to attach a negative sign on any final answer. So this
number of
(-)9...99999 delivers me two more new square roots of (-1) in the form
of

(-)9....99999r9
and
(-)3162....r

So there, I have Five different square roots of (-1) provided I act
and behave like
mathematicians that believe ....99999 looks and acts like (-1). I do
not buy theirs
and I would believe I found only THREE new square roots of (-1) in the
above.

So, to solve Hamilton's quaternions of i,j,k, I would fetch these
three points of the
sphere:

(-)....00001

and

(-)9...9999r9

and

(-) 3162......r

So where are these three square roots of (-1) on the sphere? Well,
(-)....00001
is very close and nearby the South Pole and less than one unit away.
The number
(-)9.....99999r9 is very close and nearby from the North Pole. But the
interesting
one is the (-)3162....r . For the number (-)3....333333 is 1/3 of
approx180 degrees and
is thus approx60 degrees. So that 3162....r is very close to
60degrees. from
the South Pole.

So that if we were to travel around the Equator of Earth a square root
of (-1) would
appear close to the South Pole then approx 60 degrees from South Pole
and
finally next to the North Pole.

Note: in the above it is obvious that every P-adic whether prime or
composite N-adic
would have square roots of its largest integer such as ....22222 in 3-
adics or
.....5555 in 6-adics. So there are square roots of (-1) in all p-adics
and N-adics.
And at least two sqrt(-1) considering their negative hemisphere.

That should read :

is very close and nearby the South Pole and is one unit away.

Alright, this is a mistake large enough to warrant its own post. I
should never
include the Equator when I talk about numbers such as ....9999999 or
(-).....99999 close to either the North or South Pole taking them as
+0 and
-0 respectively.

Obviously the Semisphere of +p-adics with +0 to +....99999 cannot have
the equator. Likewise the -p-adics with -0 and (-)....9999 cannot have
the equator as dividing the two hemispheres.

So the Hemispheres in the above would be a line of Longitude and where
I can never include the Equator.

P.S. I do not think I can blame that mistake on writing late at night,
or, at least
I found the mistake while writing early in the morning. Auf Wedersehn
