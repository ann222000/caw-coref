AsSalaam O Alaikum

*Another Record Breaking Disaster in India, and Bangladesh also.*

*بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم*

*In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful*

*Disasters: a Test – or – Punishment*

*A humble advise to Muslims as well as Non-Muslims*

*Why should Allah punish you if you have thanked (Him) and have believed in
Him. And Allah is Ever All-Appreciative (of good), All-knowing.
(Al_Quraan_004:147)*

*Disaster does not mean only Natural Disaster, it could be Cruel Ruler as
well*

*Dated: 21 – SEP – 2005*
------------------------------

*More and more record breaking Disasters are coming all over the world and
one after another. Regardless of Muslims or Christian or others, every one
is suffering badly. It is time to Re-think, Repent and Enter into Islaam
Whole-Heartedly.*

*Disaster gets more and more Killer, after an Informer (Warner) arrives in a
town (city / country): *

*Whenever We sent a Prophet (Informer / Warner) to a town*, We took up its
people in *suffering and adversity*, in order that *they might learn
humility*. (Al_Quraan_007.094)

*Those Who Listen BUT Do Not Obey are the Worst Animal*, *since they do not
understand:*

*You Hear it that is it, Now it is Between You and Allah:*

O you who believe! obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn back from
Him while you hear. And be not like those *who* said, We *hear*, and they *did
not obey*. Surely the *worst of animals*, in Allah's sight, are the *deaf,
the dumb*, *who do not understand*. (Al_Quraan_008.020-022)

*What to do when you know a Disaster has approached?*

*1&gt;         Evacuate the place if needed. When you start feeling the Danger
from the Disaster, Start Making the Athan every 10 to 15 minutes on all
corners if possible. If it is safe step out from your place (home or work)
otherwise stay inside to make the Athan.*

*2&gt;         Recite Darood-e-Ibraheem before making any Duaas, like we do
recite Darood-e-Ibraheem in all of our Salaat.*

*Allahumma Salli 'alaa Muhammad-in wa 'alaa aali Muhammad-in Kamaa Sallayta
'alaa Ibrahima wa 'alaa aali Ibrahima Innaka Hameedun Majeed.*

*Allahumma Baarik 'alaa Muhammad-in wa 'alaa aali Muhammad-in Kamaa Baarakta
'alaa Ibrahima wa 'alaa aali Ibrahima Innaka Hameedun Majeed.*

*O Allah! Shower blessings upon Sayyidina Muhammad and on the family of
Sayyidina Muhammad as You showered blessings upon Sayyidina Ibrahim and on
the family of Sayyidina Ibrahim. Surely, You are the Praiseworthy, Glorious.
*

*O Allah! Bestow favours upon Sayyidina Muhammad and on the family of
Sayyidina Muhammad as You bestowed favours upon Sayyidina Ibrahim and on the
family of Sayyidina Ibrahim. Surely, You are the Praiseworthy, Glorious.*

*Then Recite as many Duaas as you need. Remember Allah knows all languages,
in which** language you will ask from Allah, HE will sure listen to your
Duaas, Inshaa Allah.*

*3&gt;         Keep Asking Allah to forgive you.*

*Duaa for Forgiveness:*

*لا إِلَهَ إِلا أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ*

&quot;None has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allah), Glorified (and
Exalted) are You. Truly, I have been of the wrong-doers.&quot;
(Al_Quraan_021.087)

*رَّبِّ اغْفِرْ وَارْحَمْ وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ الرَّاحِمِينَ*

&quot;My Lord! Forgive and have mercy, for You are the Best of those who show
mercy!&quot; (Al_Quraan_023.118)

*4&gt;         Keep Asking Allah for help. Only Yaa Allah Help, all others are
shirk, including Yaa Ali Help or Yaa Muhammad Help.*

*إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ*
*Iyyaka nabudu wa iyyaka nastaeen.*

*You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for HELP for each and
everything.*

*5&gt;         Make TRUE intention that you will sure Learn and Practice
the Quraan,
Inshaa Allah.*

*May Allah forgive all of us and guide us to follow the Quraan and Really
Authentic Sunnah. AMEEN.*
------------------------------

*How to help the survivors of the disasters?*
Saving a Life is like Saving the Whole World. (Ref. Al_Quraan_005.032)

*Help the victims from the depths of your heart with what ever you can,
regardless of any race. If there are many dead, try to bury them
immediately. BUT if the deaths are enormous then there is no need to waste
time on counting bodies and waiting for others to come and recognize their
loved ones. This may cause huge delay and diseases may spread which may
double the figure of deaths.*

*Advise to the Victims of the disasters?*

*We feel very sorry from the depth of our heart and we help from the depth
of our heart. It is very hard to face such a great disaster, than writing in
words. When the relief (help) is on the way, be patient and try to organize
and help those first who need the immediate attention among you. Try to give
the first chance to children, old people, injured people, women. Try not to
break the justice and try to divide the relief (help) equally among you with
true justice.*
------------------------------

*Why Disasters? *

*Disaster gets more and more Killer, after an Informer (Warner) arrives in a
town (city / country): *

*Whenever We sent a Prophet (Informer / Warner) to a town*, We took up its
people in *suffering and adversity*, in order that *they might learn
humility*. (Al_Quraan_007.094)

*Allah Never Destroys the Good Nations: *

But why were there not among the generations before you those possessing
understanding, who should have forbidden the making of mischief in the
earth, except a few of those whom We delivered from among them? And those
who were unjust went after what they are made to enjoy of plenty, and they
were guilty. *Your Lord never annihilates any community unjustly, while its
people are righteous*. (Al_Quraan_011.116-117)

*Allah Never Changes the Conditions of a Nation till their People (NOT their
Leader) Changes themselves: *

In the manner of the people of Pharaoh and those before them; they
disbelieved in Allah's communications, therefore Allah destroyed them on
account of their faults; surely Allah is strong, severe in requiting (evil).
This is because *Allah has never changed a favor which He has conferred upon
a people until they change their own condition*; and because Allah is
Hearing, Knowing. (Al_Quraan_008.052-053)

*Corruption in the Land is because of Peoples Deeds: *

*Corruption has appeared in the land and the sea on account of what the
hands of men have wrought (done)*, that He may make them taste a part of
that which they have done, so that they may return. (Al_Quraan_030.041)

*Disasters Continued: *

Even if a Quraan caused mountains to move, or the earth to tear asunder, or
the dead to speak (they will not believe). Allah controls all things. Is it
not time for the believers to give up and realize that if Allah willed, He
could have guided all the people? The *disbelievers will continue to suffer
disasters*, as a consequence of their own works, or have disasters strike
close to them, until Allah's promise is fulfilled. Allah will never change
the predetermined destiny. (Al_Quraan_013.031)

*Miserable Life of Disbelievers: *

And whoever turns away from My reminder (message), *he will have a miserable
life*, and We will raise him on the Day of Resurrection, blind.
(Al_Quraan_020.124)

*Disbelievers are Loosing their Lands: *

Nay, We gave the good things of this life to these men and their fathers
until the period grew long for them; Do they not then see that *We gradually
reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders?* Is it then
they who will win? (Al_Quraan_021.044)

*Destruction of Disbeliever's Land: *

And when We wish to destroy a town, *We send Our commandment to the people
of it who lead easy lives*, but *they transgress* therein; thus the word
proves true against it, *so We destroy it with utter destruction*. And *how
many of the generations did We destroy after Nuh!* and your Lord is
sufficient as Knowing and Seeing with regard to His servants' faults.
(Al_Quraan_017.016-017)
------------------------------

*Why Muslims and Muslims countries are getting more affected, while Allah
promised to protect the believers? We need to find out immediately, what was
the sins of those Muslims who were affected by such disasters, so that we
can avoid those sins.*

And *if* the people of the towns had *believed and guarded* (against evil) *we
would certainly have opened up for them blessings from the heaven and the
earth*, but they rejected, so we overtook them for what they had earned.
(Al_Quraan_007.096)

*Recently Indonesia got affected by Tsunami triggered by an under sea
Earthquake on 26-DEC-2004. Before Bangladesh got affected by massive flood
and over 2/3 of Bangladesh gone under water. History of Earthquake in Iran
and Turkey is not too old as well. It looks like we are Muslims by name only.
We have the Quraan and we believe on the Quraan that it is from Allah and
free from any kind of error or contradiction BUT when the time comes to
practice it, we try to deviate from it and start looking shortcuts. Enter
into Islaam Completely and immediately without any delay.*

*Disasters are not without any reason:*

*Mischief (Disaster or Corruption) has appeared on land and sea because of
(the evil) that the hands of men have earned, that (Allah) may give them a
taste of some of their deeds: in order that they may turn back (from Evil)
[Al_Quraan_030:041]*

*As for those who disbelieve, disaster ceaseth not to strike them because of
what they do, or it dwelleth near their home until the threat of Allah come
to pass. [Al_Quraan_013.031]*

*In the above two Ayaat Disaster points to both the Natural Disasters as
well as Man Mad, including a Cruel Ruler.*

*Do we think that Allah will change our conditions, since we just recite
Kalima and obey his few commands. It is our mistake. Allah never changes the
condition of people unless they change themselves. Our Ummah has to change
immediately, so don't delay, time is running out. Do you think that Cruel
Ruler is not a Disaster, Think again.*

*Take an example of present condition in Iraq, their language is
Arabic BUTthey are widely divided into several sects, like Shia,
Sunnee, Kurd etc.
They still didn't change and get united immediately, so perhaps Allah didn't
change their condition of being butcher as well as many others in the past
and may be in the future. Who knows that they will be the next. Change
yourself to unite perfectly and immediately. It is not an unity if you still
are Shia, Sunnee, Kurd etc. Please read my article on Perfect Unity of
Muslim Ummah.*

*Remember: After Listening or watching or reading etc. of Quraan and
Authentic Hadeeth, it is your responsibility to think and decide as well as
change accordingly and immediately. Yes, Rasool Allah already warned that
there will be around 73 sects of Muslims BUT only one will go to the Heaven,
doesn't mean that in any sects I am fine. I must need to find out the right
one and change accordingly and immediately, only then there is a real hope
to enter to the heaven. Tomorrow may never come so don't delay and Enter
into Islaam immediately. Also telling others as well is your responsibility.
*
------------------------------

*Possible Reason Why Muslim Ummah is suffering Badly: *

Yet you it is who slay your people and turn a party from among you out of
their homes, backing each other up against them unlawfully and exceeding the
limits; and if they should come to you, as captives you would ransom them--
while their very turning out was unlawful for you. *Do you then believe in a
part of the Book and disbelieve in the other*? What then is the re ward of
such among you as do this but disgrace in the life of this world, and on the
day of resurrection they shall be sent back to the most grievous
chastisement, and Allah is not at all heedless of what you do. These are
they who buy the life of this world for the hereafter, so their chastisement
shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped. (Al_Quraan_002.085-086)

*(Here Believing means Practicing. Islaam is a Practical Religion and NOT a
Verbal Religion. Today vast majority of Muslim Ummah are not Practicing
Islaam completely, so it means, they are believing in some parts of the
Quraan, while disbelieving in the others.) *

*Allah has promised for the great bounty, BUT why Muslim Ummah are
suffering: *

And *if* the people of the towns had *believed and guarded* (against evil) *we
would certainly have opened up for them blessings from the heaven and the
earth*, but they rejected, so we overtook them for what they had earned.
(Al_Quraan_007.096)

Do not hold the Messenger's calling (you) among you to be like your calling
one to the other; Allah indeed knows those who steal away from among you,
concealing themselves; therefore *let those beware who go against his order
lest a trial afflict them or there befall them a painful chastisement*.
(Al_Quraan_024.063)

Behold! You are those who are called upon to spend in Allah's way, *but
among you are those who are niggardly*, and whoever is niggardly is
niggardly against his own soul; and Allah is Self-sufficient and you have
need (of Him), and if you turn back He will bring in your place another
people, then they will not be like you. (Al_Quraan_047.038)

Shall I then seek a judge other than Allah? And He it is Who has revealed to
you the Book (which is) made plain; and those whom We have given the Book
know that it is revealed by your Lord with truth, therefore you should not
be of the disputers. (Al_Quraan_006.114)

*Those who don't do Justice according to the Laws of Allah they are
unbelievers: *

Surely We revealed the Taurat in which was guidance and light; with it the
prophets who submitted themselves (to Allah) judged (matters) for those who
were Jews, and the masters of Divine knowledge and the doctors, because they
were required to guard (part) of the Book of Allah, and they were witnesses
thereof; therefore fear not the people and fear Me, and do not take a small
price for My communications; and whoever did not judge by what Allah
revealed, those are they that are the unbelievers. (Al_Quraan_005.044)

*What about those Muslim Rulers, who don't implement the True Islamic Laws,
how come they are Muslim? What about those who appoint them by giving vote
in a democratic system, although there are others asking their support, so
that they may be able to implement the True Islaamic System (Khilafa)? What
about those who don't go for vote where there is a democratic system, to
elect someone who is promising to implement the True Islaamic System? As an
example, suppose 3% who wants Islaamic System, but didn't vote, 49% vote to
Non-Islaamic party while 47% vote to Islaamic Party. Then Non-Islaamic Party
will be in the power only because of 3% people. Why there are so many
divided Islaamic Parties?  Suppose that the majority of the people don't
want Islaamic System then, would you like to force the people or do Dawah
and leave the rest on Allah? A Muslim can never vote to a Non-Islaamic
party, while there are Islaamic Parties available. These things are
extremely important and need TRUE Justice otherwise the corrupt Rulers will
be appointed and will destroy the Nation. You must need to help those who
are sincerely &amp; peacefully trying to build the Khilafa (United States of
Islaam). *

*Those who vote for NON-Islaamic Party May be actually Disbelievers: *

O ye who believe! Whoso of you becomes a renegade from his religion, (know
that in his stead) Allah will bring a people whom He loves and who love Him,
humble toward believers, stern toward disbelievers, striving in the way of
Allah and fearing not the blame of any blamer. Such is the grace of Allah,
which He gives unto whom He will. Allah is All Embracing, All Knowing.
[Al_Quraan_005.054]

*Remember: There is no Compulsion in the Religion… (Al_Quraan_002.256) *

*Those who Divide the Religion are NO Longer Muslims: *

*As for those who Divide their Religion and break up into Sects, thou hast
NO part in them in the least: their affair is with Allah. He will in the end
tell them the truth of all that they did.&quot; [Holy Quraan 6: 159] *

*Allah wants us to be United Perfectly: *

*If you DIFFER* *in anything (Faith, Salaat, Sayaam, Zakaat, etc.)* *amongst
yourself, then REFER to Allah and his Messenger, if you really believe in
Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for
determinations. [Al_Quraan_004.059] *

*Weather you believe or not, our Foundation (Worshipping Method) is
widely divided
into several sects. Not only every group, believing on, that they are right,
BUT every person practically believe that he is right, and perfect, so he is
acting accordingly. *

Check your Faith, Kalimah, Salaat, Sayaam, Zakaat, Hajj, etc (Every Act
including Worship). Think again, why you are different from other Muslims.
First see yourself, may be you are not Correct.

Only No Innovations, No Additions or Subtractions in our Faith, Kalimah,
Salaat, Sayaam, Zakaat, Hajj, etc. will bring us to Perfect Unity.
------------------------------

*Allah Saved only those Who were doing Dawah:*

But why were there not among the generations before you those possessing
understanding, who should have forbidden the making of mischief in the
earth, *except a few of those whom (ONLY) We Saved ( from harm)?* And those
who were unjust went after what they are made to enjoy of plenty, and they
were guilty. (Al_Quraan_011:116)

*It is NOT only Duty of Scholars to do Dawah (Tell the TRUTH about the
Message of Allah), to save the whole world from Disasters. A single Scholar
may not do door to door Dawah to tens of millions of people. It is DUTY on
EVERY Single Muslims to do Dawah with Wisdom. As an example, I included at
the end, &quot;My Way of Dawah&quot;. Do some dialog and give them Quraan, if they are
really interested and give the address of Scholars to contact for more
clarifications.*

------------------------------

*Allah Never Destroys the Good Nations: *

But why were there not among the generations before you those possessing
understanding, who should have forbidden the making of mischief in the
earth, except a few of those whom We delivered from among them? And those
who were unjust went after what they are made to enjoy of plenty, and they
were guilty. *Your Lord never annihilates any community unjustly, while its
people are righteous*. (Al_Quraan_011.116-117)

*Allah Never Changes the Conditions of a Nation till their People (NOT their
Leader) Changes themselves: *

In the manner of the people of Pharaoh and those before them; they
disbelieved in Allah's communications, therefore Allah destroyed them on
account of their faults; surely Allah is strong, severe in requiting (evil).
This is because *Allah has never changed a favor which He has conferred upon
a people until they change their own condition*; and because Allah is
Hearing, Knowing. (Al_Quraan_008.052-053)
------------------------------

*Disasters in Muslim Countries: *

*If Disasters are coming in Muslim Countries, it does not mean that
Disasters are a natural phenomena. Muslims are badly divided into sects and
many of them have NOT yet Completely Entered into Islaam, actually many of
them are disobeying Allah by neglecting the Quraan and Allah already has
warned them as in Quraan:*

*As for those who Divide their Religion and break up into Sects, thou hast
NO part (Not Muslim any More) in them in the least: their affair is with
Allah. He will in the end tell them the truth of all that they did.&quot; [Holy
Quraan 6: 159]*

*If any (including Muslims) do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah
hath revealed, they are Unbelievers. (Al_Quraan_005.044)*

*(True Justice you need do at home, at work, in the court, in the assembly
and every where.)*
------------------------------

*Allah wants us to start Obeying him IMMEDIATELY so Don't Delay**:*

*And (remember, O children of Israel) when We made a covenant with you
and caused
the Mount to tower above you, (saying): Hold fast that which We have given
you, and remember that which is therein, that ye may ward off (evil).
[Al_Quraan_002.063]*

*As we can see, now a days more and more record breaking disasters are
coming to the land, which may be an alarm to the human, so below are my
advise to Muslims as well as Non-Muslims:*
------------------------------

*Advise to NON-MUSLIMS before it gets too LATE:*

*Think why are you getting disasters, if God (Allah) or Jesus (pbuh) loves
you. Don't say it is a Mother Nature, even then if it is a Mother Nature,
why didn't God (Allah) or Jesus (pbuh) protects you from the Disasters. It
will be great lie. Although Science took many times U Turn, even then now a
days you have a good opportunity of Science to check which of the Holy Book
may be more LOGICAL, TRUE and FREE from any ERROR or Contradiction. Should
you accept those Holy Book which says the Earth is Flat, or those which says
to clean the place, sprinkle it with blood. Do you clean your operation
theatre with blood or Anti Bacterial Medicine. Why don't you read the Quraan
and get the Guidance from it, which is free from all errors and
contradictions and fully protected by God (Allah). Don't think that man made
law is right for you or majority of people (Democracy) is right. Today man
says something and tomorrow changes those because he finds many problems
with the man made laws.*

*For those who are not Muslims, they are advised to find the Real Truth
Immediately, Learn the Teaching of Quraan and if you Really Find the
Truthin it,
then, you must immediately accept it from your deep heart, before it gets
too late, regardless of what other people are doing, otherwise more and more
disasters may come. Don't forget that Noah's Ark was also a punishment from
Allah (God Almighty). Every where in the world we are getting record
breaking disasters, like Tornado, Cyclone, Hurricane, Earthquake, Volcano
Eruption, Floods, Wild Fire and Cruel Ruler, etc.*
------------------------------

*Advise to MUSLIMS before it gets too LATE:*

*For those who are Muslims, they are advised to think why in Indonesia,
Bangladesh, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and other Muslim populated areas we are
getting record-breaking disasters. Those are actually Punishments from
Allah. If you don't unite Perfectly and start worshipping Allah what really
Allah expects from us, more and more disasters (Punishments) may come. Don't
under estimate, don't do the Great Mistake again and again that &quot;I am Right&quot;.
Come to Perfect Unity of Muslim Ummah NOW before it gets too LATE. Enter
into Islaam Completely.*
------------------------------

*Whenever any problem or disaster like Tornado, Cyclone, Hurricane,
Earthquake, Volcano Eruption, Flood, Wild Fire and Cruel Ruler, etc and does
many damages, we need to do research and analyses in detail. Is it a
Testfrom Allah or
Punishment from Allah?*

*If a Nation Disobeys Allah and Rasool Allah (SAW), that Nation may get
Punishment like Tornado, Cyclone, Hurricane, Earthquake, Volcano Eruption,
Flood, wild fire and Cruel Ruler, etc doing many damages.*

*If a single person Disobeys Allah and Rasool Allah (SAW), that individual
person may get punishment like accident, cancerous disease or other prolong
disease.*

*As for those who disbelieve, disaster ceaseth not to strike them because of
what they do, or it dwelleth near their home until the threat of Allah come
to pass. [Al_Quraan_013.031]*

*To make sure it is not a punishment but a test, we need to have a detail
analysis to CHECK the checklist, if we are really following Quraan and
Sunnah and without any differences:*

1&gt;               *Faith:*                                           Is it
according to Quraan and Authentic Sunnah?

2&gt;               *Salaat (Regular 5 Times):*      Is it according to Quraan
and Authentic Sunnah?

3&gt;               *Worshiping Methods:*             Is it according to Quraan
and Authentic Sunnah?

4&gt;               *Sayaam:*                                     Is it
according to Quraan and Authentic Sunnah?

5&gt;               *Zakaat:*                                        Is it
according to Quraan and Authentic Sunnah?

6&gt;               *Hajj:*                                             Is it
according to Quraan and Authentic Sunnah?

7&gt;               *Justice System:            *            Is it according to
Quraan and Authentic Sunnah?

8&gt;               *Dawah:*                                       Is it
according to Quraan and Authentic Sunnah?

9&gt;               *Muslim Unity:*                            Is it according
to Quraan and Authentic Sunnah?

10&gt;           *All other matters:          *            Is it according to
Quraan and Authentic Sunnah?
------------------------------

*Avoid Great Mistake that &quot;I am Right&quot;.*
------------------------------

*Great Sins:*

*Any single act we do against what Allah is mentioned in Quraan is a Great
Sin.*
------------------------------

*Committers of only one Great Sins:*

*Generally Muslim believes that he or she is only doing one great sin, rest
is fine, since he or she is not committing any other sin.*

*Iblees was the first committer. [Al_Quraan_002.034]*

*People of Shueyb (pbuh) [Al_Quraan_012.084]*

*People of Musa (pbuh) about Sabbath [Al_Quraan_007.163]*

*People of Lut (pbuh) [Al_Quraan_007.080-084]*

*Etc.*
------------------------------

*Allah wants us to be United Perfectly:*

*If you DIFFER in anything* *(Faith, Salaat, Sayaam, Zakaat, Hajj,
etc.)* *amongst
yourself, then REFER to Allah and his Messenger, if you really believe in
Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for
determinations. [Al_Quraan_004.059]*

*Weather you believe or not, our Foundation (Worshipping Method) is
widely divided
into several sects. Not only every group, believing on, that they are right,
BUT every person practically believe that he is right, and perfect, so he is
acting accordingly.*

Check your Faith, Kalimah, Salaat, Sayaam, Zakaat, Hajj, etc (Every Act
including Worship). Think again, why you are different from other Muslims.
First see yourself, may be you are not Correct.

Only No Innovations, No Additions or Subtractions in our Faith, Kalimah,
Salaat, Sayaam, Zakaat, Hajj, etc. will bring us to Perfect Unity.

*Cross Marriage between Arabs and Non-Arabs might be very helpful to come
closer.*
------------------------------

*Change yourself NOW before it gets too LATE:*

*Verily Allah will never change the condition of a people until they (first)
change it themselves. [Al_Quraan_013.011]*

*Enter into Islam whole-heartedly, and follow not the footsteps of the evil
one. (Al_Quraan_002.208)*
------------------------------

*Forgiveness:***

*If any of you did evil in ignorance (without knowing it), and thereafter
repented, and amend (his conduct), lo! He is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.
(Al_Quraan_006.054)*

*(Asked Allah to forgive you and never ever think to do it again, otherwise
it will be like a joke with Allah)*
------------------------------

*May Allah Forgive all Muslims. AMEEN.*

*May Allah UNITE all Muslims. AMEEN.*
