THE ANGEL OF MERI-DOSA

Meri-Dosa pronounced &quot;Meyer a Dosa&quot;
Lucia pronounced &quot;Loo-chee-a&quot;
- Meeting in the Rain -

Chapter One

The down pour was horrible,
Too much for the windshield wipers to clear.
Pelting in massive sheets,
I couldn't see anything from here.

It matched my mood
As my tears poured like the rain.
My heart was jerked and tossed, and
To this was the mental agony and pain.

The doctor said, with such finality,
&quot;Your baby will, most assuredly, be blind
And, hopefully, not be more seriously ill.&quot;
He said it sadly, trying to be so kind.

But no matter how kind,
There were no buffers for what he said -
A baby due, in a week or two;
Sorrow for joy instead.

Due to my illness, in the beginning,
The baby would be born unsighted,
The way the doctor spoke;
A situation that would never be righted.

What started as a regular day
Had turned into a personal hell.
How would I tell this to Jeff?
What words do you use to tell?

We had just moved to Meri-Dosa,
Out of the busy dirty city and its noise.
With a baby on the way, we wanted
A good place to raise a family of girls and boys.

So, we had come to this place,
A beach town more or less;
Laid back society, in tune to the ocean waves.
As Jeff said, &quot;A place to let go of stress.&quot;

We had lost a baby, last year.
So, this was suppose to be healing,
Buying the old Victorian mansion;
Needed so much and all the paint was peeling.

We worked hard, fixing it up;
Painting and mending windows, and grooming it.
Five big bedrooms - a place to grow,
Where children (four or more) would fit.

I was working on the nursery.
I chose yellow and white,
Bright and cheery; almost ready
For a baby who would have no sight.

I heard myself talking loud,
&quot;Why, God?  Why us?
Please, help me, somebody.&quot;
I guess I was talking to Jesus.

Funny, I had went to Sunday School.
As a child, I had heard about Him.
But to trust, really trust -
He was just a ladder while I was out on a limb.

Isn't that the way it goes?
Why should He listen to me, now?
I would have to look for another answer.
But truthfully, I didn't know how.

It was dark.  I was near to home,
A place I wanted filled with children and laughter;
Where Lucia and Jeff, and kids,
Would live - happily ever after.

Then, out of nowhere, a child
Just standing in my head lights.
I swerved to avoid hitting her,
Trying to locate her in the brights.

She was drenched and shivering.
No wonder, what a scare!
She stood motionless.
Her big eyes could only stare.

I grabbed her and pulled her to me,
&quot;Gracious child, where did you come from?&quot;
She didn't cry or react,
Like she was struck dumb.

I put her in my car.
&quot;Where can I take you to?&quot;
Just down the street, miss;
Over there will do.&quot;

The rain slacked down.
She pointed to a hovel, looked to be abandoned.
So, she was from that part of town,
Still looking shaken and very stunned.

&quot;What's your name?&quot; I asked.
&quot;My name is Angel, that's me.&quot;
&quot;Why were you out in the road?
You could have been killed, so easily.&quot;

Her eyes brightened,
&quot;Jesus wouldn't let that happen.&quot;
Good Lord, I thought.
Here we go, again.

I saw a bit of a light, in the house.
She opened the door and jumped out.
&quot;What's your name, lady?&quot;
&quot;Lucia,&quot; I heard myself shout.

More softly, I replied, &quot;Lucia.&quot;
&quot;I could have guessed that, I bet.&quot;
&quot;Sure,&quot; I whispered, &quot;and, in five minutes,
A name she would forget.&quot;

&quot;Where do you live?&quot; she inquired.
&quot;I live at the end of Meri-Dosa Street.&quot;
&quot;Okay, thank you, Lucia.  Thanks for the ride.&quot;
And with that, she left on bare feet.

For the moment, she had made me forget.
I was pulling in the portico, at home, finally.
Now the sick feeling returned.  My baby,
Longed for, planned for - that would never see.

Chapter Two

Jeff wasn't home, yet.
I went to change clothes and dry my hair.
&quot;Dear God,&quot; I reached out, again.
&quot;Are you really there?&quot;

Then, I laughed at myself,
&quot;Silly, like He would answer you.
How long since you talked to Him,
Like you use to do?&quot;

I felt ashamed, mixed with anger.
&quot;How can you be a merciful God and, yet,
Let children be born blind, or dead -
Like the other one I can't forget?

Just like I thought,
You aren't talking to me any more.
I've outgrown you, I guess.&quot;
I was confused to the core.

I heard Jeff come in, downstairs,
&quot;Lucia, are you alright?
I saw a car, like yours, in a ditch,
As I was coming home tonight.&quot;

I descended the steps.
My feet felt like led.
How am I going to say this to him?
I delayed - to fix supper, instead.

&quot;Lucia, what did the doctor say?&quot;
I felt those hot tears well up, again.
I was emotionally drained, now;
A stone where my heart had been.

I turned to face him.
Bless his heart, he was so sweet.
&quot;The doctor said,&quot; I swallowed hard.
It was his eyes I couldn't meet.

&quot;Oh, Jeff, he said
The baby will be born blind
And, hopefully, nothing more to worry about.
And, that was the good news he could find.&quot;

I was shaking, again, and sobbing.
&quot;Come on, honey,&quot; he chided as he held me.
&quot;God wouldn't let that happen.&quot;
I cried back, &quot;O, wouldn't he?&quot;

&quot;Jeff, you have to realize
The truth of what my sickness did.
I'm sorry, we had such wondrous plans;
All the things this child will miss.&quot;

&quot;Ok, Lucia, if that happens,
We can love past the affliction.
But, I'm trusting God for this,
Be it a daughter or a son.

We will make a happy home, regardless.
A child 'filled with love' is what it is all about.
He or she will be blessed .
Sometimes, God just chooses a different route.&quot;

That was Jeff, forever the optimist.
I guessed that was why I loved him so much.
But even so, I felt like a failure.
For me, God was out of touch.

My heart was bitter.
How do you care for a blind child?
I wasn't prepared for this, in the classes I took.
Jeff just patted my hand and smiled.

&quot;Lucia, things will work out for the best.
Love will make a way, just wait and see.
Blind, deaf, crippled, disfigured -
It is family.&quot;

Why couldn't I feel like that?
Maybe, someday, some way;
Seems like (just maybe) for now,
I have had enough for today.

&quot;By the way, Jeff,
I almost had an accident this evening.
A little girl just appeared, from nowhere.
I almost ran over her.  It was so frightening.&quot;

&quot;O, my God, was she alright?  Are you alright?
No wonder you are so upset.&quot;
&quot;Yes, she is fine.  I took her home,
Strangest child I ever met.&quot;

&quot;She said her name was Angel and
She lives out past the dunes, way past there.
She was just, all of a sudden, there;
Pretty little girl with violet eyes and golden hair.&quot;

&quot;Did you speak to her folks and
Find out why she would be out in this rain?
What kind of folks would allow that to happen,
Someone with out a brain?&quot;

&quot;No I didn't go in.
There was a light, but very faint.
I just watched her go in;
A real house - it sure ain't.

By now, Jeff had his paper in hand.
His pipe clenched between his teeth, again.
Conversation ended, kaput, done.
My pessimism or Jeff's optimism, which would win?

The next morning, when Jeff left for work,
I got my kiss and hug at the door.
I went to the nursery, to paint,
then I asked my self, &quot;Why?  What for?&quot;

Then, I heard a tiny voice in the garden,
Under a storm of flying fuzz,
Singing a song (an old familiar song)
&quot;Jesus loves ya.  Yes, he does.&quot;

As she sung, with
The words all her own,
Sitting among the dandelion debris -
Swirling from what the wind had blown ...

I listened to her words,
&quot;Jesus loves ya.  Yes, he does.
He's the same as he usta was,&quot;
To the tune of Jesus Loves Me.

But the words, a far cry
From what I believe.
She must have heard it in a strange way,
The way that children perceive.

She, being none other than Angel,
My nemeses from the stormy night;
Dressed just the same, but dry -
Kind of long and lacy white ...

I went down the back steps,
Out to the veranda, off the library,
Into the garden and made my way to her.
How she got here was kind of scary.

&quot;Hello, Angel.  What ya doing?&quot;
&quot;Mommy says I should come and help you,
For being so kind to bring me home, yesterday.
So, that's what I came to do.

Mommy said I should stay here,
For a couple of days.
She had to go with daddy.
They had to go a long long ways.&quot;

&quot;What!&quot; I almost yelled.
Why would they do that? ponder that one.
Here sat the little girl,
With golden hair glistening in the sun.

She looked up, at me,
With the most beautiful violet eyes ever.
They were beautiful, but some how seemed old;
Maybe a little impish of a child, somewhat clever.

Chapter Three

Angel looked at me as if she could see my heart and soul.
I imagine her six, maybe; but very small.
What was I going to do with her?
I didn't know how to reach her folks, at all.

How dare her parents assume
That I would care for her!
I couldn't help asking, like Jeff,
What kind of folks they were.

&quot;So, Angel, where did they go?
Your folks, I mean to say.&quot;
She never batted an eye,
&quot;Don't know, for sure.  They just went away.&quot;

&quot;I heard your song.  The words
Were different than the ones I knew.&quot;
&quot;I know,&quot; she said, &quot;Jesus wrote them
And told me to sing them to you.&quot;

I was stunned, again.  How do you know Jesus?&quot;
&quot;Well,&quot; she answered, &quot;He just is
And he lives in my heart,
And I'm a friend of his.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; but, I didn't really.
Now, it seems, I had a house guest;
Self invited, I guess.  I owed her that much.
I felt a twinge of anger.  I sure didn't feel my best.

She sat in the old garden glider,
Sing/songing her words over and over again.
To be happy with these events,
I couldn't even pretend.

When Jeff got home, she greeted him.
His eyes lit up with joy.
&quot;Well hello, there!  Aren't you a pretty little thing?
Would you be a girl or boy?&quot;

She giggled, &quot;Why, a girl, of course,
And my name is Angel.  What's your name?&quot;
&quot;Well, Miss Angel, I would be Sir Jeffery.&quot;
He bowed at her, &quot;One and the very same.&quot;

Boy, were they hitting it off!
Jeff loved kids, wanted a house full, someday.
Then, I felt the stirring for my child
Who wouldn't ever see the true light of day.

Jeff walked Angel through the house,
Asking which room she wanted for the night.
They sat on the veranda and watched the sun set,
From other perspective, it looked so right.

She fell asleep in his arms
(Golden curls, across his broad shoulder, spread
As he carried her to the room she selected)
And he put her to bed.

She was up early and was sitting at the table,
Chatting away like a bubbly bird.
Jeff was listening intently,
Leaning on every word.

He drank his coffee and ate his toast,
And kissed her and me good bye.
She had won his heart
And he didn't even have to try.

She tried to help with the dishes and
We visited over a cup of afternoon tea.
She studied me, with violet eyes,
And made conversation comfortably.

&quot;By the way, Angel&quot; I ventured.
&quot;Your mom sure gave you a pretty name.&quot;
&quot;Oh, no.  Jesus calls me Angel.
My real name is Mira, not the same.&quot;

&quot;Well, I stand corrected,&quot; I stuttered.
&quot;That's alright, Miss Lucia.  You didn't know&quot;.
&quot;So, when did you change, or Jesus change, your name to Angel?&quot;
Almost matter of factly, with a toss of her curls, &quot;A few days ago.&quot;

I let that pass.  She was a child with an attitude
And she made me feel like the child.
&quot;So, ya gonna have a baby, when?&quot;
My mind almost went wild.

&quot;In a few days, a week or so.&quot;
She looked at me, closely,
&quot;Then, why do you look so sad?&quot;
Now, she was beginning to really bother me.

&quot;Don't you like kids, or babies?&quot;
I know she meant well.
But now, I was crying all over again
And felt the hurt to my very soul.

&quot;Of course, I like kids and especially babies.
But, my little baby is going to be born blind.&quot;
I know I sounded harsh and angry.
I just couldn't bring myself to be kind.

I know it wasn't her fault.
But, I felt she was too intrusive,
Putting herself in the middle of my heart ache.
It was like this pain was mine, exclusive.

&quot;Did ya talk to Jesus about that?&quot;
She asked innocently,
&quot;Now, Angel, what good would that do?
He's way to busy to listen to me.&quot;

&quot;Ain't so, Miss Lucia,&quot; she cried.
&quot;Just like the song says so,
Jesus loves ya.  Yes, he does
And he's the same as he usta was.

If you ask him every day,
He will answer when you pray.

Maybe your baby will have eyes like mine.
Do ya think so, maybe?&quot;
&quot;No Angel, your eyes are violet blue.
Him and I both Italian decent,
It will have eyes of dark brown, like Jeff and me.&quot;

Chapter Four

Jeff got home early and she was waiting for him.
He picked her up and swung her around.
She giggled and they were lost in play,
Like she was his long daughter - now found.

After supper, they went to the library
And Angel sat in his easy chair, with him.
They would read and joke, and talk.
He hadn't been this happy since I don't know when.

I found myself jealous of her,
For she was able to read and see
What my child would never do;
T'was like it had no being.

It was odd, the baby
Was moving more; responding to her voice.
I could almost believe everything was alright.
It was my feeling of choice.

I was so down and
Preparing myself for the peril ahead.
She helped me finish the nursery and
Even put the bumper pads on the baby bed.

&quot;The baby will sure have a nice place to play.
What a lucky baby to have a mommy like you.&quot;
Tears spilled down my face.
I could only hope that was true.

&quot;Shouldn't your folks be getting back soon?&quot;
I asked, to change the conversation.
&quot;Don't know, maybe.  They said they would send for me.&quot;
This was becoming a difficult situation.

&quot;Mommy said not to worry,
I would know when it was time to go.&quot;
&quot;I see.  Will they call you here?
How will they let you know?&quot;

She shrugged her shoulders and
Those big violet eyes looked at me.
&quot;Sometimes, Miss Lucia,
Ya just know how things be.&quot;

What kind of answer was that?
I mean, they never sent her a change of clothes.
I washed her only dress while she slept.
What kind of folks ... God only knows.

The third morning, I felt
Like I needed some real answers
From 'someone in the know',
Not just hers.

&quot;Do you want to ride with me today, Angel?
I'm going by your street.
Maybe we could stop by your house
And get some shoes for your feet.

&quot;No, thanks.  I don't have any.
I usta live here, you know.
This place was named for me.
I'm Meri.  Yep, that's me.  It's really so.&quot;

What a cleaver little one, she was,
Changing the matter at hand.
Was she just foxing with me?
I didn't understand.

&quot;Is that so?  Tell me more.&quot;
&quot;Well,&quot; she said like she was giving a news report,
I just did ... live here, I mean,&quot;
In a kind of retort.

With that, she looked away.
I think she was going to cry.
&quot;That's why I stayed with you,
Since my mommy went bye-bye.

&quot;Are you saying your mommy passed away
And she's not coming back, at all?&quot;
&quot;I tried to go with her, but Jesus said
For me to wait for him to call.&quot;

&quot;You're confusing me, Angel.
Who will call you?&quot;
&quot;Why Jesus, of course.  He said that to me,
When my mission is through.&quot;

&quot;What job could he want you to do?
You're just a little child.&quot;
&quot;Mommy says Jesus has all kinds of workers,&quot;
And, with that, she smiled.&quot;

&quot;Ok, Angel, what are you suppose to do?&quot;
&quot;Why, take care of you, like mommy said.
But, she's waiting for me in heaven.
She just went on, a head.&quot;

I felt a prickle, up and down my spine.
What, on earth, had she been taught?
That silly kind of talk
Could lead to naught.

Chapter Five

&quot;Well, miss Angel, or Meri,
What does Meri Dosa mean to you?&quot;
Calmly, she replied, &quot;It was our last name,
And they called it 'Dosa house'.
That is sure true.&quot;

Quite a little story teller, this one.
I loved her bright smile and big eyes,
And I told myself,
Somewhere therein, the truth really lies.

&quot;Hey, Miss Lucia.  Have you talked to Jesus, yet?
Did you ask him about your baby's eyes?
Mommy says 'what we ask for' he supplies.

I guess that means, if we ask,
He gives us what we need.
I just listen a lot,
'Cause, you know I can't read.

Are you going to adopt me?
Do you want to?&quot;
I almost choked, giving no answer.
Adoption?  That would never do.

This is not an easy thing to discuss
And less easy to do, now days.
Besides, what would her family say?
This child sure had some strange ways.

After Jeff put her to bed,
I related the story to him; about living here.
&quot;Awe, honey, you know kids.  It's like comfort candy.
It was just a way of cheer.

Do you suppose she is an orphan or run away?
And, who knows what she has been through?
Would you consider adoption, Lucia?
Is that something we could do?&quot;

&quot;Jeff, why ask that?
Is she that important to our life?&quot;
Waiting for his answer was torture,
like being run through with a knife.

Honey, why don't you like her?
What wrong has she done?
She's sweet and pretty, and bright;
And she's a helpful little one.

&quot;Listen to yourself, Jeff.
Are you forgetting we have a child on the way.
A blind, misfortunate, baby -
Due just any day?

Now, you speak of adopting another.
Why, Jeff? because she can see?
I was screaming my heart out now,
Crying for my baby and me.

I awoke, Sunday morning,
To the chanting of Angel's song.
I gritted my teeth,
Not that she was doing any wrong.

&quot;Jesus loves ya.
Yes, he does
He’s just the same
As he usta was.&quot;

She was out in the garden,
On the glider swing,
Rocking, in time,
With the song she loved to sing.

I pulled on my robe
And slipped down the stairs, quietly.
Jeff wasn’t in the kitchen -
Wondering if he was still mad at me.

I walked out to the garden.
I could hear the ocean.
The day was heavy and hot,
And it would storm before this day was done.

It was a beach town
And, often, vacationers would drop in;
Congregate at the coffee shop
And talk about the places they had been.

Jeff often went there to soak up the local atmosphere.
He loved to be where there was laughter and mingle.
Myself, I was more the loner;
Even when I was single.

The singing stopped.
The swing ceased its old squeak.
She spoke, softly, &quot;I’m sorry you and
Mr. Jeff got mad.&quot;  She was so meek.

&quot;I’m sorry you heard that.
It wasn’t really about you.
Some things scare me, when I don't understand why;
Especially when I don’t know what to do.&quot;

&quot;I know, Lucia.
But, maybe, Jesus can help you, now.&quot;
Oddly enough, I didn’t bristle at that
and she sensed it, too, somehow.

&quot;You know, Angel,
I did and I have been praying.&quot;
And, for the first time since meeting her,
I admitted, &quot;I think God heard what I was asking.

I had asked for a perfect baby
With two arms and legs, and eyes that could see.
But, I, also, told Him, from my heart,
Whatever he decided was alright with me.&quot;

She smiled as I sat in the swing, beside her.
I cradled her, in my arms, as she sank into them.
She started crying, in small sobs,
&quot;I’m going to miss you.  I’m going home, again.&quot;

Chapter Six

I looked into her sweet face,
&quot;I didn't hear your mother call.&quot;
&quot;Oh, she came by, in my sleep, and said
She would be by to get me, after all.&quot;

She must have been dreaming.
After all, I thought she was an orphan.
Wasn't that what the argument was all about last night,
After all was said and done?

&quot;Angel,&quot; I countered,
&quot;We were going to try to adopt you.
I'm sorry, we thought you were all alone.&quot;
By now, I wasn't sure of what was true.

&quot;Oh, Lucia,  I just came to help.
That was my mission here,
To help you love someone new
And accept a blind baby without fear.

But, I could stay and be your baby's eyes,
And see things for him or her, you know;
Like a seeing eye dog I saw, one time.
I got no where else to go.&quot;

It was beginning to rain.
I suggested we go inside.
She cuddled close, for a moment,
As I tried to sort out truth; like an on coming tide.

These past few days had
Swept over me, in waves;
From the thought that 'Jesus didn't care'
To 'Jesus answers prayers and saves'.

Emotions were running high,
Confusing me more than I could ever realize.
But she, Meri or Angel,
Wanting to be my baby's eyes?

I felt sad that she would compare herself
To a seeing eye dog; a place of servitude.
I realized, in that moment,
It was me (not her) that had an attitude.

I curled 'one of her golden curls'
Gently around my finger.
The rain was pelting, now.
This was no time to linger.

She threw her arms around me,
&quot;I love you, too, Lucia.  I really do.&quot;
I accepted her joyous hug,
And 'I love you, too'.

I was going inside.
She said she had to go somewhere, right now.
How could anyone make sense of this,
Anybody, any how?

&quot;See ya later,&quot; she called back to me
As I ran inside.
Happy, confused, and even sad tears
'Down my flushed cheeks' began to slide.

Gads, I hope she makes it alright.
As the storm, in earnest, had begun.
Typical for me, I mused,
Another day with out the sun.

Then I heard it, the squeal of brakes and then a thud.
I knew, in a flash, what had happened.
I ran down the terrace steps, to the street.
Under the cars bumper, Angel laid: pinned.

The driver, in hysterics, screaming,
&quot;I didn’t see her!  I didn’t see her!
She was just there, in front of me, in the storm!&quot;
I pulled her, gently as I could, as she began to stir.

&quot;Oh, Angel, honey.  Hear me.
Wake up.  Speak to me, Angel.&quot;
If she was breathing or awake,
I couldn’t tell.

I tried to shield her from the onslaught of rain,
Leaning over the little body, so frail.
To add misery to this peril,
We, now, had an assault of hard hail.

She moved in my arms and whispered,
&quot;Thank you for loving me.
Now, your baby can have my eyes,
So that it can see.&quot;

I held her close and, somewhere far off,
I could hear the siren of an ambulance.
&quot;Oh, Angel, your gonna need them,
You’ll see.  Give me another chance.&quot;

&quot;Jesus said
I wouldn’t need them any more.&quot;
Then, the eyes of violet closed
And she slipped into heaven's doors.

I lost track of time.
I verily remember arms pulling me away
As I kept calling to her,
&quot;Angel, please, don't go.  Please stay.&quot;

Jeff got there
Just as the emergency cars did.
Our tears mingled over her little body;
Hot burning tears never hid.

No one came forth to claim Angel,
Or Meri, or who ever she was, or is.
Jeff and I said she was ours
And that, now, Jesus, said she was his.

We stood at the grave.
Jeff prayed and, then, we sang
From our hearts
As the Spirit sprang ...

&quot;Jesus loves me.
Yes, he does
And he's just the same
As he usta was.&quot;

Laid to rest, now, at peace;
Gone to the Father and her friend Jesus.
Golden curls and violet eyes -
Who had come to bless us.

Chapter Seven

Epilog

Only one person had attended the service,
An older lady who sat alone.
Was she the only person that knew Angel?
If so, there was no emotion shown.

After the service, I went to her.
Are you some of Angel's family?
She shook her head, &quot;No.
I just came to see.&quot;

I heard of her, once.
I think she might be a ghost
Or an angel, or something
From the heavenly host.

If memory serves me right,
There was a child called Meri Dosa.
She and her folks were killed in a train wreck,
And they say she was the child from Meri-Dosa.

I heard she didn't go with them.
She claimed she had a work to do for Jesus.
Imagine a tiny slip of a thing, like her,
About the Father's business.

Of course, it was just a legend or story
And she was your little girl.&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; I cried.  &quot;She should have been
As I touched one golden curl.&quot;

With that, she ambled away;
Leaving more questions than answers.
Maybe an angel, a ghost, a legend;
Whatever her story, it was hers.

How fitting, we met in a storm
And we parted the same way.
She had asked me, that morning,
would I remember her, someway.

Lord knows I surely would.
She had left heart prints all over me.
In her dying breath, trying to give
Sight to a child that couldn't see.

The house was terribly empty.
But, her essence was still 'all the way' through.
Someday, I would tell her sister or brother
They have angel eyes looking over you.

The following week,
Our child entered life loudly.
They whisked her away, immediately;
Not letting me really see.

They wanted to check her over,
To see what other malformities she might have had.
But, my heart knew that, whatever,
To have her 'with me' would make me glad.

The doctor returned, beaming the broadest smile.
You won't believe this, in a million years.
She's perfect and she can see!
That wasn't a complete mystery to me.

They handed the pink bundle to me
And she opened her eyes.
And there, we all saw
A wonderful surprise.

Staring back at me
Were the most beautiful violet eyes,
Eyes of an angel, golden downy hair:
An angel in a human shell.

Her name, Angel Meri,
To remind us of what a storm had wrought
And that Jesus still answers prayers
When his love is sought.

Some say an angel in disguise,
A ghost, maybe.  But, we know - heaven sent.
We were blessed in the knowing of her.
But, all along, she was heaven bent.
