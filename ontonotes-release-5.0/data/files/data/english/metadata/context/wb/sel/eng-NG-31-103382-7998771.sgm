I wonder if anyone out there knows whether or not there is any
evidence to show that an atmosphere with an increased amount of CO2
will necessarily be significantly hotter.

The last estimates I read suggested that the human generated increase
in CO2 had increased the percentage from 0.035% to 0.045%.
Please tell me how is is possible that a change iof 0.01% is thought
to be so injurious to earth's future.
Surely an increase in even 10 times that will not significantly
increase the heat capacity of air to a significant degree?

What is really going on here?

21st century environmentalism is merely the screeching of left-over marxists
determined to renew their agenda of world domination.  They use scare
tactics; this is but their latest.

Very good question.

Nitrogen, oxygen and argon together comprise MORE than 99 percent of the
atmosphere. *(CO2 is less than 1%)*. None of these three gases absorb either
visible or infrared light; both types penetrate the entire atmosphere. It is
as though, when it comes to the absorption and emission of light, the
atmosphere's three main components do not exist!

The amount of carbon dioxide has increased by more than 25 percent in the
past century, an increase which is known to be in part due to combustion of
fossil fuels and the removal of forests.

When the combined effects of both increasing aerosols and greenhouse gases
are taking into account, the most sophisticated climate models suggest that
the Earth will warm by about 2.0 degrees Centigrade by the year 2100. In
addition, these same models suggest a 50 centimeter (20 inch) rise in sea
level by 2100.

The physics and calculation belongs to expert, I know barely anything about
it.

The heat absorbed by water vapor and carbon dioxide is shared with all the
nitrogen, oxygen and argon, because the latter molecules are always bumping
into water vapor and carbon dioxide as they mix in the atmosphere. This
effect makes the atmosphere act somewhat like a blanket that becomes thicker
when amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, such
as methane and nitrous oxide, increase. The top of the blanket remains cold
and continues to emit about the same amount of infrared to space but below
the blanket it gets warmer because it is more difficult for the heat to rise
to the top. We are stuffed without it this effect, Earth would be cold as
Mars, now we are heating though  up.

Air Pollution, which should be eliminated, is ironically slows the green
house runaway effect. After Ground zero for three days there was absolutely
no air traffic in NY. To expert's shock, NY's air heated up. They fear, if
we stop pollution, which is a must, by now accelerates GH effect.

Here in Australia, you burn to death at the beach due to 200-300 times
higher UV radiation. Not that bad in Europe, due to their pollution.

You are mistaken . The IPCC was initiated by Margaret Thatcher who was
seeking to do two things. 1) Smash the miners unions and close down
coal based power stations, 2) Propmote nuclear energy. She financed
the IPCC to prove that CO2 was damaging the earth.
Maybe you could naswer why is it that Bush and his new right-wing
cronies is now behind CO2 as the chief cause of GW. It is so that he
can use a stick to retard third world development. In particular he
wishes to slow China's meteoric growth.

The percentage of atmospheric CO2 is no more that 0,045% actually.
The recent (100 years or so ) is only thought to have incresed by
0.01% from about 0.035%.
There seems to be no basic science which can explain or justify any
significant temperature increase.
ICe-core evidence from Vostok, despite the claims of Al Gore, does not
demonstrate that CO2 promotes a temperature rise: it shows the
opposite.
The evidence actually shows that a rise in earth's temperature causes
an increase in CO2. The evidence shows a realtionship between CO2 and
temperature: temperature increases and is FOLLOWED by a CO2 increase
around 800 years later.
THough it may be true that CO2 can absorb some infra-red: I have seen
nothing that can explain how an increase of 0.01% could hever be
responsible for a measurable temperature change. Water vapour can also
absorb infra-red and is thought to account for around 70+% of GW.
Fluctuations in water could do more to explain a temp increase, solar
activity can do more to explain and increase, there are many more
natural fluctuations that might be offered as an explanation.
But a 0.01% increase in CO2 - where is the basic science?

I agree with you

'The recent (100 years or so ) is only thought to have incresed by
0.01% from about 0.035%.'

Nothing to worry about. We can dismiss CO2 question. Global warming is an
illusion.
500 million tones of petrol, gas, pumped yearly into the atmosphere, 600
million of cars, 100000 airplanes every second in the air burning more than
50 tones of kerosene cannot possibly have an impact.

Some Chinese cities have not seen the sun for years due to enormous
pollution. I worked in Mumbay. You don't see green leaves, they are all
covered with dust.

Long live the denial. everything is cool. No damage done.
Why did you ask anyway?

It's frustrating to see that list discussions fall
totally in oblivion, without leaving a slightest
trace.
Global Warming has been discussed in several threads
and here it starts again from the scratch. Nothing
wrong, of course, with restarting it, but pity it
starts from the scratch.

Last thread on GW has been triggered by Sam's
revelation of his &quot;10 Recommendations&quot; (read
&quot;Commandments&quot;). I opened the discussion with
the answer quoted here in Appendix, which I believe
is pertinent to the newly started thread.

Georges
======================================================
APPENDIX

A neighbor riding his bicycle at nights, panicked by
Global Warming (GW), changed the battery of his
bike's lamp, which he considered polluting, to a
dynamo. &quot;More effort&quot; he says, &quot;but my conscience
is quiet. I did my part and if all did the same,
we would stop and reverse the GW&quot;.

Would we indeed? Seems somehow thin.

Sam's &quot;Recommendations&quot; would have about the same
effect, i.e. tranquilize Sam's conscience without
any impact on GW. He seems full of good will, but
it's the sort of good will paving roads to hell.

Let's first ask, what has GW to do with Epistemology.
It's doubtless a most important problem, one of the
critical for mankind's survival, but it concerns
physics, sociology, economy and politics. Actually,
it became entirely confined in politics which
discovered its panic generating quality. Now, panic
is the strongest lever in political campaigns. We saw
it at work, triggering the Iraq war. Now, I'm not
arguing for, nor against Iraq war, it would not be
pertinent to Epistemology, but just stress the role
of panic in politics. Generating it slickly and
astutely with help of GW, some Gore or Clinton may
be elected. With what impact on the GW and its
sequels?
Rigorously, NONE.
They don't care a damn about it else then as the
political lever and even if they cared, what, if
anything, could they do?

Now, that's where Epistemology could be of avail. It
deals with consistent formulation of problems and with
their processing following rigorous inference.

Let's see what could we do in this direction at the
state of the art of our knowledge, competence and
skills.

First, we shall state that the problem is much too
complex to hope for a decisive formulation, let
alone for solutions, in this first, timid trial. We
have to hope for a reasonable debate, bringing new
ideas as successive approximations. It would be the
first time that such thing would happen in this list,
but nothing is impossible, so we don't lose hope
and pass to our trial to formulate the GW.

GW has two kinds of causes: human and natural.
Starting with natural, we observe that GW happened
several times in history as one of two phases of a
more general cyclic structure GW/GF (Global Freezing).
As it's easier to explicate separately GW and GF, we
shall start by it before moving to their more complex
cyclic reversion and succession.

Earth surface encompasses white ice areas reflecting
heat radiated by the sun and other dark ones absorbing
it. In a steady state of ice/not-ice distribution and
constant amount of radiated heat, the absorption to
reflection ratio stays constant and the climate does
not change. Yet, the smallest distortion may change
this equilibrium.
Let's suppose that one year the sun emits more heat
and then returns to the constant yearly amount.
The triggering change warms up the earth more than
usually, so that more ice melts. Then, next year less
heat is reflected and more absorbed, so that still
more ice melts and we enter the progressive,
accelerating GW phase. Nothing seems to stay in the
way of earth losing all its ice and becoming a Sahara
interspaced with hot seas. Yet, history shows, that
GW was succeeded by GF, in turn by GW, etc.

Which mechanism may rewerse GW into GF and vice versa?

There must be several, but I can think only of one,
albeit sufficient to account for the cyclicity,
viz the salt.

Oceans are salted and salt waters freeze at lower
temperature than the sweet. Snows and ice melting
copiously during the GW, flood oceans with sweet water
decreasing their salinity and increasing their
freezing temperature, so that over a threshold they
start to freeze again over larger surfaces and the
phase moves to GF and towards a new glacial period.

Pseudo-scientific committees commanded by politicians,
decided that GW is &quot;due&quot; with 80% certainty to human
causes, implying that it may be reversed by human
action.

Double lie:

1.&quot;Due&quot; should be replaced with &quot;triggered&quot;. It's
possible that greenhouse triggered GW, as any small
distortion could disarrange the fragile equilibrium.
However, once triggered and entered in the ice melting
phase, it's DUE to ice melting.

2.Once in the ice melting phase, the triggering action
did its job and is of little, if any avail. Even if we
stop all emissions, ice will continue to melt and GW
to progress.

Which actions seem advisable in this light?

1.Dissociate GW from greenhouse, admit that it is
inevitable and start immediately to plan actions
aiming at saving millions endangered by inundations,
(expatriation, artificial islands, etc.) and other
sequels of the GW.

2.In order to finance these actions, stop subsidizing
fraudulent and useless phantasms such as intermittent
energy sources (photo-voltaic and mainly the wind
mafia steeling and sharing with corrupted politicians
heavy billions from the tax payers.)

Dissociate pollution from GW. Pollution is a critical
problem in itself and should be treated as such, but
separately from GW. And we should discuss it in a
separate thread.

The fundemental question is little more than: How is it thought that
the increase in atmospheric CO2 from 0.035% to a staggeringly high
(irony) 0.045% can cause any significant increase in GW?
I would have thought that it was a straightforward &quot;epistemological&quot;
question.
It is a question that, it seems, has not been, tested, whereas the
assumptions that have led to the hysteria of anthropocentric GW, have
been clearly falsified by experimentation.
Without an answer to that question, ALL assumptions of the GW
hysterical fraternity of the IPCC and the &quot;back to nature&quot; lobby are
nothing more than circumstantial evidence and the findings of the IPCC
are nothing more than &quot;Cargo-Cult&quot; science.

To George: the reason why I &quot;started it from scratch&quot; is to see
whether any one had seen the basic science.
This is the simple question: how can 0.01% of CO2 cause a global
catastrophy?

&gt; The fundemental question is little more than: How is
&gt; it thought that
&gt; the increase in atmospheric CO2 from 0.035% to a
&gt; staggeringly high
&gt; (irony) 0.045% can cause any significant increase in
&gt; GW?
&gt; I would have thought that it was a straightforward
&gt; &quot;epistemological&quot;
&gt; question.
&gt; It is a question that, it seems, has not been,
&gt; tested, whereas the
&gt; assumptions that have led to the hysteria of
&gt; anthropocentric GW, have
&gt; been clearly falsified by experimentation.
&gt; Without an answer to that question, ALL assumptions
&gt; of the GW
&gt; hysterical fraternity of the IPCC and the &quot;back to
&gt; nature&quot; lobby are
&gt; nothing more than circumstantial evidence and the
&gt; findings of the IPCC
&gt; are nothing more than &quot;Cargo-Cult&quot; science.

&gt; To George: the reason why I &quot;started it from
&gt; scratch&quot; is to see
&gt; whether any one had seen the basic science.
&gt; This is the simple question: how can 0.01% of CO2
&gt; cause a global
&gt; catastrophy?
">

=====================================================
It could perhaps TRIGGER but not CAUSE the GW
phase of the GW/GF(Global Freezing) cycle.
A tour of pedals may push the bike over the summit,
thus TRIGGERING its descent CAUSED by the natural
cause of gravity. And even if the pedals triggered
the descent, you may turn backwards your freewheel
pedals till you are blue in the face, but gravity
will not notice it and the descent will continue
undisturbed, just like the GW will stay insensitive
to Kyoto Protocols,to anti-American propaganda
and to green presidential campaigns.
Till the bike passes the valley and, always by natural

causes, starts climbing the other side, or the GW
phase passes, always by natural causes, to the
GF phase.

As to the science, it does not have for the moment
precise enough Models to carry out long term climate
predictions and if it had, it still lacks geological
and astrophysical data to input as boundary conditions
at its sources and sinks.

BTW, as you rightly said, the whole pseudo-ecological
circus was started by Margaret Thatcher who did not
care a button about climate, but searched a ruse
to suppress protests of callously exploited coal
miners.

You are absolutely right, that is not epistemology. I got sucked in after
reading about jews and god knows what.

Traditional epistemology is concerned with knowledge as justified true
belief, philosophical debate of their meaning, it can be considered to be a
language game described by Wittgenstein.

We barely have these topics here, Einstein, infinity, quantum mechs are not
epistemology topics.
Neither consciousness.

&gt; It's frustrating to see that list discussions fall
&gt; totally in oblivion, without leaving a slightest
&gt; trace.
&gt; Global Warming has been discussed in several threads
&gt; and here it starts again from the scratch. Nothing
&gt; wrong, of course, with restarting it, but pity it
&gt; starts from the scratch.

&gt; Last thread on GW has been triggered by Sam's
&gt; revelation of his &quot;10 Recommendations&quot; (read
&gt; &quot;Commandments&quot;). I opened the discussion with
&gt; the answer quoted here in Appendix, which I believe
&gt; is pertinent to the newly started thread.

&gt; Georges
&gt; ======================================================
&gt; APPENDIX

&gt; A neighbor riding his bicycle at nights, panicked by
&gt; Global Warming (GW), changed the battery of his
&gt; bike's lamp, which he considered polluting, to a
&gt; dynamo. &quot;More effort&quot; he says, &quot;but my conscience
&gt; is quiet. I did my part and if all did the same,
&gt; we would stop and reverse the GW&quot;.

&gt; Would we indeed? Seems somehow thin.

&gt; Sam's &quot;Recommendations&quot; would have about the same
&gt; effect, i.e. tranquilize Sam's conscience without
&gt; any impact on GW. He seems full of good will, but
&gt; it's the sort of good will paving roads to hell.

&gt; Let's first ask, what has GW to do with Epistemology.
&gt; It's doubtless a most important problem, one of the
&gt; critical for mankind's survival, but it concerns
&gt; physics, sociology, economy and politics. Actually,
&gt; it became entirely confined in politics which
&gt; discovered its panic generating quality. Now, panic
&gt; is the strongest lever in political campaigns. We saw
&gt; it at work, triggering the Iraq war. Now, I'm not
&gt; arguing for, nor against Iraq war, it would not be
&gt; pertinent to Epistemology, but just stress the role
&gt; of panic in politics. Generating it slickly and
&gt; astutely with help of GW, some Gore or Clinton may
&gt; be elected. With what impact on the GW and its
&gt; sequels?
&gt; Rigorously, NONE.
&gt; They don't care a damn about it else then as the
&gt; political lever and even if they cared, what, if
&gt; anything, could they do?

&gt; Now, that's where Epistemology could be of avail. It
&gt; deals with consistent formulation of problems and with
&gt; their processing following rigorous inference.

&gt; Let's see what could we do in this direction at the
&gt; state of the art of our knowledge, competence and
&gt; skills.

&gt; First, we shall state that the problem is much too
&gt; complex to hope for a decisive formulation, let
&gt; alone for solutions, in this first, timid trial. We
&gt; have to hope for a reasonable debate, bringing new
&gt; ideas as successive approximations. It would be the
&gt; first time that such thing would happen in this list,
&gt; but nothing is impossible, so we don't lose hope
&gt; and pass to our trial to formulate the GW.

&gt; GW has two kinds of causes: human and natural.
&gt; Starting with natural, we observe that GW happened
&gt; several times in history as one of two phases of a
&gt; more general cyclic structure GW/GF (Global Freezing).
&gt; As it's easier to explicate separately GW and GF, we
&gt; shall start by it before moving to their more complex
&gt; cyclic reversion and succession.

&gt; Earth surface encompasses white ice areas reflecting
&gt; heat radiated by the sun and other dark ones absorbing
&gt; it. In a steady state of ice/not-ice distribution and
&gt; constant amount of radiated heat, the absorption to
&gt; reflection ratio stays constant and the climate does
&gt; not change. Yet, the smallest distortion may change
&gt; this equilibrium.
&gt; Let's suppose that one year the sun emits more heat
&gt; and then returns to the constant yearly amount.
&gt; The triggering change warms up the earth more than
&gt; usually, so that more ice melts. Then, next year less
&gt; heat is reflected and more absorbed, so that still
&gt; more ice melts and we enter the progressive,
&gt; accelerating GW phase. Nothing seems to stay in the
&gt; way of earth losing all its ice and becoming a Sahara
&gt; interspaced with hot seas. Yet, history shows, that
&gt; GW was succeeded by GF, in turn by GW, etc.

&gt; Which mechanism may rewerse GW into GF and vice versa?

&gt; There must be several, but I can think only of one,
&gt; albeit sufficient to account for the cyclicity,
&gt; viz the salt.

&gt; Oceans are salted and salt waters freeze at lower
&gt; temperature than the sweet. Snows and ice melting
&gt; copiously during the GW, flood oceans with sweet water
&gt; decreasing their salinity and increasing their
&gt; freezing temperature, so that over a threshold they
&gt; start to freeze again over larger surfaces and the
&gt; phase moves to GF and towards a new glacial period.

&gt; Pseudo-scientific committees commanded by politicians,
&gt; decided that GW is &quot;due&quot; with 80% certainty to human
&gt; causes, implying that it may be reversed by human
&gt; action.

&gt; Double lie:

&gt; 1.&quot;Due&quot; should be replaced with &quot;triggered&quot;. It's
&gt; possible that greenhouse triggered GW, as any small
&gt; distortion could disarrange the fragile equilibrium.
&gt; However, once triggered and entered in the ice melting
&gt; phase, it's DUE to ice melting.

&gt; 2.Once in the ice melting phase, the triggering action
&gt; did its job and is of little, if any avail. Even if we
&gt; stop all emissions, ice will continue to melt and GW
&gt; to progress.

&gt; Which actions seem advisable in this light?

&gt; 1.Dissociate GW from greenhouse, admit that it is
&gt; inevitable and start immediately to plan actions
&gt; aiming at saving millions endangered by inundations,
&gt; (expatriation, artificial islands, etc.) and other
&gt; sequels of the GW.

&gt; 2.In order to finance these actions, stop subsidizing
&gt; fraudulent and useless phantasms such as intermittent
&gt; energy sources (photo-voltaic and mainly the wind
&gt; mafia steeling and sharing with corrupted politicians
&gt; heavy billions from the tax payers.)

&gt; Dissociate pollution from GW. Pollution is a critical
&gt; problem in itself and should be treated as such, but
&gt; separately from GW. And we should discuss it in a
&gt; separate thread.

The weather forcast for the comming weekend changes as the week goes
on. People at work joke about choosing which wheather they would like
from among the various weather sites, Which, they say, all base their
different predictions on the same met office data (I can't be bothered
to look at them, but I watch the weather on the news). They can't get
accurate predictions for the weather for this weekend, but we are
supposed to credit their predictions for what the weather will be like
in forty years. This just doesn't seem reasonable. I suppose there is
a difference between predicting long term trends and predicting
weather on a particular day, but they've had a lot more practice
predicting weather for the near future, and still arn't very accurate.
This doesn't give me much confidence for their other predictions,
which they've hardly been able to test very well except for evidence
that the world has warmed up a bit, ice caps have retreated, and we've
had some hot summers. This isn't any sort of semi rigorous proof.
Another thing that exasperates me is that whenever there is a 'weather
event' the media just cannot help insinuating that it must be due to
global warming. But the world is supposed to have warmed by 0.7
degrees (celsius, I presume) over the last century. Was, or is the
worlds weather so finely balanced that 0.7 degrees difference over a
century can cause disasterous weather events? And this when, in
England, the temperature often changes by ten degrees every day from
day to night, and by thirty degrees every year from summer to winter,
and when there is often violent weather in the arctic and ant-arctic
(where its cold) and in the tropics (where its hot). 0.7 degrees
increase, on average, over a century is supposed to cause catastrophic
weather events all of a sudden. This doesn't seem very plausible
either.
There is a tendency to think that nature is naturally good. This is a
comforting thought, because we are stuck with nature in one form or
another and if it is naturally good but bad things happen we must be
to blame. But we can do something about our own behaviour so we have
got something we can do to make everything all right again. This again
is a comforting thought, in a superstisciously paniky sort of a way.
We aren't just stuck in a situation where horrible things are liable
to happen despite our being good. This is the same sort of attitude of
people who chastised themselves on the appearance of comets  or during
the black death. But according to one major scientific theory,
evolution through natural selection, nature is red in tooth and claw.
This doesn't seem very consistent with nature supposedly being
naturally good.
Nevertheless, now we've given up relying on God to sort things out, we
have got to manage the situation we find ourselves in. Or whatever the
situation turns out to be. And our actions may well influence what
does happen. It seems unfortunate, but a fact, that our ability to
predict and understand complicated events like the weather is just
woefully uncertain.

It's a white knuckle ride. Keep holding on to the other side.

Nice post. I agree with you that the media are too biassed. Always
been so, though. I remember 2 years ago in mid August a couple of
mornings i experienced 10°Celsius (i live in Italy, sunny land). No
one talked about global freezing then. Not even local freezing. This
said, though, we have worrysome reports on melting glaciers. It may be
of no relevance (i don't really know if this has already happened in
the past) but it might also be a signal. What decisions could possibly
we adopt? I think that this issue, again, shows how science is totally
useless. Shamans cound't have done it worse. They would have danced to
stop the warming. Scientists, on the other hands, spend their time and
our money to instruct journalists about what politicians care, so that
common people can have sleepless nights and endless discussions about
climate change (as seen on tv). Truman show.

Yes, you are right about nature not being good to us, necessarily. Yet
it's the only available, good or bad that it is. Outside nature
there's only Disneyland. So trying to have decent relationships with
her and knowing it doesn't protect us from natural events should be
the basic knowledge and ethics of any human. This said remains the big
problem of what humans are doing to nature. Do you remember Manhattan
300 years ago? Nature created it through millennia (many) of constant
relationships between different species and elements. When men arrived
no species but theirs was allowed. Ah, yes, Indians were not their
species either, just to set the record straight.
This generates a sense of guilt. Don't ask me why, but it happens. The
more people ignore nature and destroy what nature has created, the
more they feel compelled to adopt a religion (or a science, or a
fashion for that matters) for propitiatory reasons. Only mass
behaviours exceeds the needs of peace with the environment.
You might already know that Sushi cuisine is both very fashionable and
responsible of the big ocean fishes extinction.
Difficult thread.

Dear George,

You are right on the money. I agree with you, those topics are far more
fascinating (EPR) to me too, than epistemology. But traditional epistemology
has nothing to do with quantum physics,genetics and Newton paradoxes; it
deals in propositional or sentential terms.

EPR or DNA from digital information/entropy coding computational process is
part of knowledge touching philosophy, but epistemology is not even close
with its tools to deal with those subjects.

Just because all are knowledge based and have their philosophy (so is
everything, plumbing and gardening, fibre optics); it does not make them
epistemology.

I prefer, however EPR and Einstein like you. I join you in holly matrimony.
Keep it up, Quine is a genius, but I vote for your topics.

Good on you.

&gt; &gt; The fundemental question is little more than: How is
&gt; &gt; it thought that
&gt; &gt; the increase in atmospheric CO2 from 0.035% to a
&gt; &gt; staggeringly high
&gt; &gt; (irony) 0.045% can cause any significant increase in
&gt; &gt; GW?
&gt; &gt; I would have thought that it was a straightforward
&gt; &gt; &quot;epistemological&quot;
&gt; &gt; question.
&gt; &gt; It is a question that, it seems, has not been,
&gt; &gt; tested, whereas the
&gt; &gt; assumptions that have led to the hysteria of
&gt; &gt; anthropocentric GW, have
&gt; &gt; been clearly falsified by experimentation.
&gt; &gt; Without an answer to that question, ALL assumptions
&gt; &gt; of the GW
&gt; &gt; hysterical fraternity of the IPCC and the &quot;back to
&gt; &gt; nature&quot; lobby are
&gt; &gt; nothing more than circumstantial evidence and the
&gt; &gt; findings of the IPCC
&gt; &gt; are nothing more than &quot;Cargo-Cult&quot; science.

&gt; &gt; To George: the reason why I &quot;started it from
&gt; &gt; scratch&quot; is to see
&gt; &gt; whether any one had seen the basic science.
&gt; &gt; This is the simple question: how can 0.01% of CO2
&gt; &gt; cause a global
&gt; &gt; catastrophy?

&gt; =====================================================
&gt; It could perhaps TRIGGER but not CAUSE the GW
&gt; phase of the GW/GF(Global Freezing) cycle.
&gt; A tour of pedals may push the bike over the summit,
&gt; thus TRIGGERING its descent CAUSED by the natural
&gt; cause of gravity. And even if the pedals triggered
&gt; the descent, you may turn backwards your freewheel
&gt; pedals till you are blue in the face, but gravity
&gt; will not notice it and the descent will continue
&gt; undisturbed, just like the GW will stay insensitive
&gt; to Kyoto Protocols,to anti-American propaganda
&gt; and to green presidential campaigns.
&gt; Till the bike passes the valley and, always by natural

&gt; causes, starts climbing the other side, or the GW
&gt; phase passes, always by natural causes, to the
&gt; GF phase.

&gt; As to the science, it does not have for the moment
&gt; precise enough Models to carry out long term climate
&gt; predictions and if it had, it still lacks geological
&gt; and astrophysical data to input as boundary conditions
&gt; at its sources and sinks.

&gt; BTW, as you rightly said, the whole pseudo-ecological
&gt; circus was started by Margaret Thatcher who did not
&gt; care a button about climate, but searched a ruse
&gt; to suppress protests of callously exploited coal
&gt; miners.

Thanks. I still find it hard to beleive that; the basic physics of
Co2's ability to trap energy is not available; and the wish-led
gullibility seems to so easily allow people to believe in this without
evidence; the environmental lobby who has been so keen to attack
science over the years is also so keen to accept the &quot;scientific&quot;
findings of the IPCC when it suits their political agenda.

&gt; The weather forcast for the comming weekend changes as the week goes

&gt; different predictions on the same met office data (I can't be bothered
&gt; to look at them, but I watch the weather on the news). They can't get
&gt; accurate predictions for the weather for this weekend, but we are
&gt; supposed to credit their predictions for what the weather will be like
&gt; in forty years. This just doesn't seem reasonable. I suppose there is
&gt; a difference between predicting long term trends and predicting
&gt; weather on a particular day, but they've had a lot more practice
&gt; predicting weather for the near future, and still arn't very accurate.
&gt; This doesn't give me much confidence for their other predictions,
&gt; which they've hardly been able to test very well except for evidence
&gt; that the world has warmed up a bit, ice caps have retreated, and we've
&gt; had some hot summers. This isn't any sort of semi rigorous proof.
&gt; Another thing that exasperates me is that whenever there is a 'weather
&gt; event' the media just cannot help insinuating that it must be due to
&gt; global warming. But the world is supposed to have warmed by 0.7
&gt; degrees (celsius, I presume) over the last century. Was, or is the
&gt; worlds weather so finely balanced that 0.7 degrees difference over a
&gt; century can cause disasterous weather events? And this when, in
&gt; England, the temperature often changes by ten degrees every day from
&gt; day to night, and by thirty degrees every year from summer to winter,
&gt; and when there is often violent weather in the arctic and ant-arctic
&gt; (where its cold) and in the tropics (where its hot). 0.7 degrees
&gt; increase, on average, over a century is supposed to cause catastrophic
&gt; weather events all of a sudden. This doesn't seem very plausible
&gt; either.
&gt; There is a tendency to think that nature is naturally good. This is a
&gt; comforting thought, because we are stuck with nature in one form or
&gt; another and if it is naturally good but bad things happen we must be
&gt; to blame.

I think this is a very salient point. Maybe it is nothing more than
bourgoise guilt that we are enjoying so much wealth and technical
achievment in the face of the third world's poverty and lack of
development, that we seek to blame oursleves for whatever woes seem to
befall the world.

Paradoxically our erge to curb CO2 emissions will enevitably further
impoverish the third world as if they are prevented from using the
fosil fuels they need to provide cleaner living conditions that
electricity can provide. We shall pat outsleves on our backs and
reflect how nice it is for all those third world countries to be kept
in a &quot;state of grace&quot; of primitive and natural living while their
children die of smoke inhalation from the dung cooking fires they
enjoy instead of the evil electricity.

&gt; people who chastised themselves on the appearance of comets  or during

&gt; evolution through natural selection, nature is red in tooth and claw.
&gt; This doesn't seem very consistent with nature supposedly being

&gt; Nevertheless, now we've given up relying on God to sort things out, we

Sorry Pete, but EPR, QM (QF), genetics and Georges subjects remain
propositions too, as well as propositional knowledge. Therefore they remain
as epistemological as they could ever be, even in the 'traditional' sense
(and I challenge anybody to define precisely what that 'tradition' exactly
is). Since no one can exactly define the imaginary wall between physics,
philosophy and psychology (emotions to be specific) many people seem to try
to keep up and standing, - I do not know anyone who even attempted to define
that wall - we'd better not keep up the illusion that there is such a wall
that isolates them from each other. So saying that epistemology 'does not
come even close to those subjects with it's tools', is forgetting that all
these subjects connect. But foremost, saying that is forgetting that all of
them use the same tools. For those tools are characters, symbols and words.

Cheers to both of you.

Dear George,

You are right on the money. I agree with you, those topics are far more
fascinating (EPR) to me too, than epistemology. But traditional epistemology
has nothing to do with quantum physics,genetics and Newton paradoxes; it
deals in propositional or sentential terms.

EPR or DNA from digital information/entropy coding computational process is
part of knowledge touching philosophy, but epistemology is not even close
with its tools to deal with those subjects.

Just because all are knowledge based and have their philosophy (so is
everything, plumbing and gardening, fibre optics); it does not make them
epistemology.

I prefer, however EPR and Einstein like you. I join you in holly matrimony.
Keep it up, Quine is a genius, but I vote for your topics.

Good on you.

Sorry Jan, my friend,

epistemology has no maths tools on Kalabi  gauge symmetry, intellectually
not even divorced from that standard (you try it). EPR, QM are not
propositional knowledge. They have been observed million times in CERN and
experimental tests.

by all means not propositional, but FACTUAL.

Since no one can exactly define the imaginary wall between physics,
philosophy and psychology

It is well defined, you are ignorant to leading knowledge.

tools are characters, symbols and words. yes, the map is not the territory.
talking about sunshine and rain is symbolic, still describes physical
reality. sunshine/radiation exists.

Consciousness is a PROCESS, not  a thing.

You are lovely, but confusing categories.

I wonder if you could possibly continue this discussion on a separate
thread.
DO either you or Jan have any information as to where I might find
basic science which links CO2 to Global Warming. I don't think it is a
QM event so please keep to the thread.

Magnificent, both of you. Congratulations. And thank you !

If I look at the clouds, and I see how much, how quick and in how strange
and unknown ways and shapes they change, indeed predictions about the
weather on an extraordinary large scale like the earth become very, very
uncertain. Here in Belgium for instance, to our surprise (that is at least,
to my surprise) we had almost nothing but rain all summer, in contradiction
to a few extremely hot past summers. And it 'looks' very much like that rain
will continue till fall and beyond, much to the dislike of everyone here.
What I am sure of is that I have never seen so much rain in summer in my
whole life. I was expecting and fearing a very long and even hotter summer
than before, with temperatures of over 40 degrees Celsius for more than one
month. But to my surprise it did not happen. On the contrary, it was
unusually cold these past few days, weeks and even months. It is midsummer
now, and yesterday I had to turn on the heating again ! I do not remember
having to do that for a very long time. So indeed : what is going on ? The
least I can say is that I am confused. I have been following the debate on
GW rather closely, and I seem to notice that the extremes in the weather
grow in numbers, personal perceptions and scientific and political reports,
hot and cold, wet and dry. Is that what is going on ? Do the extremes grow,
in our perceptions, emotions or our imagination ? Are those extremes
'outside' (but there is no real 'outside') growing in connection with the
extremes inside people, in as many domains of life as we can think of ? Do
all these different kinds of extremes connect ? It seems that way to me, but
it remains a big question. Look at this : extremely rich and extremely poor
; extremely violent and extremely peaceful ; extremely intelligent and
extremely stupid ; extremely sensitive and extremely insensitive ? Extremist
religious and extremist anti-religious ; extremist political and extremist
anti-political ; extremely social and extremely narcissistic ; extremely
epistemological and extremely anti-epistemological ? Is our humane and
moderate balance, our natural moderation that seems and feels so peaceful to
us, disappearing together with the moderate balance in nature ? And what is
moderation ? What is moderate and what is extreme, to who, when, where and
why? Very complex indeed !

Cheers.

Nice post. I agree with you that the media are too biassed. Always
been so, though. I remember 2 years ago in mid August a couple of
mornings i experienced 10°Celsius (i live in Italy, sunny land). No
one talked about global freezing then. Not even local freezing. This
said, though, we have worrysome reports on melting glaciers. It may be
of no relevance (i don't really know if this has already happened in
the past) but it might also be a signal. What decisions could possibly
we adopt? I think that this issue, again, shows how science is totally
useless. Shamans cound't have done it worse. They would have danced to
stop the warming. Scientists, on the other hands, spend their time and
our money to instruct journalists about what politicians care, so that
common people can have sleepless nights and endless discussions about
climate change (as seen on tv). Truman show.

Yes, you are right about nature not being good to us, necessarily. Yet
it's the only available, good or bad that it is. Outside nature
there's only Disneyland. So trying to have decent relationships with
her and knowing it doesn't protect us from natural events should be
the basic knowledge and ethics of any human. This said remains the big
problem of what humans are doing to nature. Do you remember Manhattan
300 years ago? Nature created it through millennia (many) of constant
relationships between different species and elements. When men arrived
no species but theirs was allowed. Ah, yes, Indians were not their
species either, just to set the record straight.
This generates a sense of guilt. Don't ask me why, but it happens. The
more people ignore nature and destroy what nature has created, the
more they feel compelled to adopt a religion (or a science, or a
fashion for that matters) for propitiatory reasons. Only mass
behaviours exceeds the needs of peace with the environment.
You might already know that Sushi cuisine is both very fashionable and
responsible of the big ocean fishes extinction.

&gt; The weather forcast for the comming weekend changes as the week goes

&gt; different predictions on the same met office data (I can't be bothered
&gt; to look at them, but I watch the weather on the news). They can't get
&gt; accurate predictions for the weather for this weekend, but we are
&gt; supposed to credit their predictions for what the weather will be like
&gt; in forty years. This just doesn't seem reasonable. I suppose there is
&gt; a difference between predicting long term trends and predicting
&gt; weather on a particular day, but they've had a lot more practice
&gt; predicting weather for the near future, and still arn't very accurate.
&gt; This doesn't give me much confidence for their other predictions,
&gt; which they've hardly been able to test very well except for evidence
&gt; that the world has warmed up a bit, ice caps have retreated, and we've
&gt; had some hot summers. This isn't any sort of semi rigorous proof.
&gt; Another thing that exasperates me is that whenever there is a 'weather
&gt; event' the media just cannot help insinuating that it must be due to
&gt; global warming. But the world is supposed to have warmed by 0.7
&gt; degrees (celsius, I presume) over the last century. Was, or is the
&gt; worlds weather so finely balanced that 0.7 degrees difference over a
&gt; century can cause disasterous weather events? And this when, in
&gt; England, the temperature often changes by ten degrees every day from
&gt; day to night, and by thirty degrees every year from summer to winter,
&gt; and when there is often violent weather in the arctic and ant-arctic
&gt; (where its cold) and in the tropics (where its hot). 0.7 degrees
&gt; increase, on average, over a century is supposed to cause catastrophic
&gt; weather events all of a sudden. This doesn't seem very plausible
&gt; either.
&gt; There is a tendency to think that nature is naturally good. This is a
&gt; comforting thought, because we are stuck with nature in one form or
&gt; another and if it is naturally good but bad things happen we must be
&gt; to blame. But we can do something about our own behaviour so we have
&gt; got something we can do to make everything all right again. This again
&gt; is a comforting thought, in a superstisciously paniky sort of a way.
&gt; We aren't just stuck in a situation where horrible things are liable
&gt; to happen despite our being good. This is the same sort of attitude of
&gt; people who chastised themselves on the appearance of comets  or during
&gt; the black death. But according to one major scientific theory,
&gt; evolution through natural selection, nature is red in tooth and claw.
&gt; This doesn't seem very consistent with nature supposedly being
&gt; naturally good.
&gt; Nevertheless, now we've given up relying on God to sort things out, we
&gt; have got to manage the situation we find ourselves in. Or whatever the
&gt; situation turns out to be. And our actions may well influence what
&gt; does happen. It seems unfortunate, but a fact, that our ability to
&gt; predict and understand complicated events like the weather is just
&gt; woefully uncertain.

&gt; It's a white knuckle ride. Keep holding on to the other side.

Whilst I still agree that using less fossil fuel is a good idea for
reasons of pollution and conservation, blaming CO2 for GW is a huge
mistake which will cloud the real issues and casues of GW. That is
stupid.
500 million tonnes is nothing compared to volcanos, nothing compared
to animals breath, and nothing compared to how much the sea can emit
annually - so get a grip and try to answer the real question.

The situation you talk of in Mumbay is not dissilmilar to the

Because there IS such a thing as GW, and we need to know the REAL

global temperature, not the cause.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Very good question.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Nitrogen, oxygen and argon together comprise MORE than 99 percent of the

&gt; &gt; either
&gt; &gt; &gt; visible or infrared light; both types penetrate the entire atmosphere.
&gt; &gt; It is
&gt; &gt; &gt; as though, when it comes to the absorption and emission of light, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; atmosphere's three main components do not exist!

&gt; &gt; &gt; The amount of carbon dioxide has increased by more than 25 percent in
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; past century, an increase which is known to be in part due to combustion
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; fossil fuels and the removal of forests.

&gt; &gt; The percentage of atmospheric CO2 is no more that 0,045% actually.
&gt; &gt; The recent (100 years or so ) is only thought to have incresed by
&gt; &gt; 0.01% from about 0.035%.
&gt; &gt; There seems to be no basic science which can explain or justify any
&gt; &gt; significant temperature increase.
&gt; &gt; ICe-core evidence from Vostok, despite the claims of Al Gore, does not
&gt; &gt; demonstrate that CO2 promotes a temperature rise: it shows the
&gt; &gt; opposite.
&gt; &gt; The evidence actually shows that a rise in earth's temperature causes
&gt; &gt; an increase in CO2. The evidence shows a realtionship between CO2 and
&gt; &gt; temperature: temperature increases and is FOLLOWED by a CO2 increase
&gt; &gt; around 800 years later.
&gt; &gt; THough it may be true that CO2 can absorb some infra-red: I have seen
&gt; &gt; nothing that can explain how an increase of 0.01% could hever be
&gt; &gt; responsible for a measurable temperature change. Water vapour can also
&gt; &gt; absorb infra-red and is thought to account for around 70+% of GW.
&gt; &gt; Fluctuations in water could do more to explain a temp increase, solar
&gt; &gt; activity can do more to explain and increase, there are many more
&gt; &gt; natural fluctuations that might be offered as an explanation.
&gt; &gt; But a 0.01% increase in CO2 - where is the basic science?

&gt; &gt; &gt; When the combined effects of both increasing aerosols and greenhouse
&gt; &gt; gases
&gt; &gt; &gt; are taking into account, the most sophisticated climate models suggest
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Earth will warm by about 2.0 degrees Centigrade by the year 2100. In
&gt; &gt; &gt; addition, these same models suggest a 50 centimeter (20 inch) rise in
&gt; &gt; sea
&gt; &gt; &gt; level by 2100.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The physics and calculation belongs to expert, I know barely anything
&gt; &gt; about
&gt; &gt; &gt; it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The heat absorbed by water vapor and carbon dioxide is shared with all
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; nitrogen, oxygen and argon, because the latter molecules are always
&gt; &gt; bumping
&gt; &gt; &gt; into water vapor and carbon dioxide as they mix in the atmosphere. This
&gt; &gt; &gt; effect makes the atmosphere act somewhat like a blanket that becomes
&gt; &gt; thicker
&gt; &gt; &gt; when amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases,
&gt; &gt; such
&gt; &gt; &gt; as methane and nitrous oxide, increase. The top of the blanket remains
&gt; &gt; cold
&gt; &gt; &gt; and continues to emit about the same amount of infrared to space but
&gt; &gt; below
&gt; &gt; &gt; the blanket it gets warmer because it is more difficult for the heat to
&gt; &gt; rise
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the top. We are stuffed without it this effect, Earth would be cold
&gt; &gt; as
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mars, now we are heating though  up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Air Pollution, which should be eliminated, is ironically slows the green
&gt; &gt; &gt; house runaway effect. After Ground zero for three days there was
&gt; &gt; absolutely
&gt; &gt; &gt; no air traffic in NY. To expert's shock, NY's air heated up. They fear,
&gt; &gt; if
&gt; &gt; &gt; we stop pollution, which is a must, by now accelerates GH effect.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Here in Australia, you burn to death at the beach due to 200-300 times
&gt; &gt; &gt; higher UV radiation. Not that bad in Europe, due to their pollution.

To Pete, Chazwin and George,

First sorry Chaz that I barged into this again - and my apologies to Pete
and George as well. I simply could not resist. But since this is an
Epistemology forum I found it only natural to do it. That's just me. Don't
bother about that. It may seem to you Chaz that GW has nothing to do with
EPR, QF and CERN, but I hope when I write this now that the three of you
will immediately feel spoken to, and your imaginations will hopefully start
working to the limit just like mine and see a lot of connections that I
cannot even dream of at this moment. Let me give some examples why I believe
they connect and they should connect, for epistemology should be and remain
a forum of connection in my view.

1.      No one can deny the realty of EPR, QF and CERN, and no one can deny
they existed and still exist on the same earth the four of us live on right
now (and luckily the four of us do not live alone here).
2.      No one can deny the effects of temperature change we all feel at
this moment, including physicists, and those effects will not vanish, even
with a billion new insights or refutations in new theories in QM like String
Theory and/or M-theory e.g.
3.      For me it remains a big question what priorities we should chose for
our debates here, including these two subjects at hand, but if they should
connect factually (to quote Pete), we are right on the money at this moment
(to quote Pete :-)), and it is not apple sauce (to quote George). For me
they do connect factually, because language is a fact (and I thank Einseele
for that, because he is also the one, amongst other people, that sparked my
investigations into language). So you see Pete why I have to repeat that
literally everybody uses the same tools : characters, words as combinations
of characters, and language in general. Those tools remain the same for any
person, and the different characters, Pete, in the words 'factual' and
'process' - (f, a, c, t, . and p, r, o, c, .) are not exclusive possessions
of those words. We use those characters for thousands of other words too, in
thousand of different combinations, and their connection through these
symbols of the alphabet do not suddenly vanish into thin air. For we build
sentences with those words, thousands of different sentences, exactly like
the ones I just build here, and the meaning of those sentences can only be
understood by connecting those characters and words again and again. We
already do that practice of connection automatically so quickly and easily
that we are not aware of that any more. That is because we already did for
tens of years in our life simply speaking and writing, i.e. millions of
times, through our memory. We are such trained character-athletes that we
quickly forget the distance we are still running. That distance only comes
back when we stumble over those characters, e.g. in difficult words like
&quot;Phenomenology&quot; some times, when we are tired. Our languages teachers
trained us to read and write in our primary and basic schools, but those we
already forgot. I don't. They were the Masters of Connection, and I hope
they realise that.
4.      Since for example the abbreviation GW (Global Warming) uses the same
characters (and to a certain extend, symbols too) as &quot;G&quot; for Gravitation and
&quot;W&quot; for &quot;Weak Force&quot; (QF), the connection to both of them is crystal clear
now, and should remain like that for ever. We should remember where these
characters come from - it is the alphabet -, we should remember that
language is their mother, and we should not try to think that suddenly they
have nothing to do with each other because we get entangled in different
meanings or domains of knowledge. Since Gravitation plays an important role
in the weather, and since the sudden flooding of CERN with water (not with
criticism) would effect the knowledge in QF to a larger extend than many
physicist in the world would like, let anybody here try to disconnect our
two subjects at hand again. I think that is impossible. In CERN that would
not be a matter of weak or strong force of any person or any (nucleus of)
particle any more ; for the ones that were working there at that moment it
would immediately become a matter a survival.
5.      QM should play a major role in climate predictions, for these
predictions are also based upon processing and interpreting computational
information about polluting particles in our clouds. The size of these
polluting particles may differ infinitely from those extremely small ones
studied in CERN, but they connect because they are made up of them. So their
behaviour also depends upon the behaviour of those extremely small
particles. QM probably already plays a role in climate predictions, without
common people like me knowing that. At least that is what I hope. But if we
keep disconnecting both so called 'domains' or 'specialisms' - in this case
physics and climatology -, we may throw away the Golden Key of Connection. I
am sure if we would compare both method of acquisition and data of particles
of Climatologists and CERN, both could learn a lot from each other. What I
am sure of is that the Large Hadron Collider that is being build at CERN
right now is not meant to spin the heads of different scientist of different
scientific disciplines around and collide them. Let's hope it is under
construction to connect them as people, with new insights in our existence.

I'll leave it at that for now.

Thanks all for your posts, and cheers to all of you.

X Jan

Sorry Jan, my friend,

epistemology has no maths tools on Kalabi  gauge symmetry, intellectually
not even divorced from that standard (you try it). EPR, QM are not
propositional knowledge. They have been observed million times in CERN and
experimental tests.

by all means not propositional, but FACTUAL.

Since no one can exactly define the imaginary wall between physics,
philosophy and psychology

It is well defined, you are ignorant to leading knowledge.

tools are characters, symbols and words. yes, the map is not the territory.
talking about sunshine and rain is symbolic, still describes physical
reality. sunshine/radiation exists.

Consciousness is a PROCESS, not  a thing.

You are lovely, but confusing categories.

that wall - we'd better not keep up the illusion that there is such a wall

come even close to those subjects with it's tools', is forgetting that all

Dear George,

You are right on the money. I agree with you, those topics are far more
fascinating (EPR) to me too, than epistemology. But traditional epistemology
has nothing to do with quantum physics,genetics and Newton paradoxes; it
deals in propositional or sentential terms.

EPR or DNA from digital information/entropy coding computational process is
part of knowledge touching philosophy, but epistemology is not even close
with its tools to deal with those subjects.

Just because all are knowledge based and have their philosophy (so is
everything, plumbing and gardening, fibre optics); it does not make them
epistemology.

I prefer, however EPR and Einstein like you. I join you in holly matrimony.
Keep it up, Quine is a genius, but I vote for your topics.

Good on you.

The debate about the EPR Paradox is IMO the most
important epistemological debate of the 20th

Thanks for the attempt at an answer but I'm not sure one word of this
is relevant.
May I remind you that I have never denied that GW is a fact. Nor have
I denied that it may well be a problem for many humans. I just feel
that when one considers the long duration of the earth's climate, the
minor changes in temperature over the last 30 years are not very
significant.
It still seems to me that the basic science which would link CO2 to GW
has not been done and that the possibility that such small increases
in CO2 could casue ANY temperature change are remote to say the least.
When we learn that the &quot;evidence&quot; linking CO2 to GW actually suggests
that CO2 is an indicator of GW and clearly not the cause of it, I am
forced to wonder at the political uses to which &quot;science&quot; has been put
in this field.
I rather think Feynman would call the CO2 debate &quot;cargo cult&quot; science.

&gt; have nothing to do with each other because we get entangled in different
&gt; meanings or domains of knowledge. Since Gravitation plays an important role
&gt; in the weather, and since the sudden flooding of CERN with water (not with
&gt; criticism) would effect the knowledge in QF to a larger extend than many
&gt; physicist in the world would like, let anybody here try to disconnect our
&gt; two subjects at hand again. I think that is impossible. In CERN that would
&gt; not be a matter of weak or strong force of any person or any (nucleus of)
&gt; particle any more ; for the ones that were working there at that moment it
&gt; would immediately become a matter a survival.
&gt; 5.      QM should play a major role in climate predictions, for these
&gt; predictions are also based upon processing and interpreting computational
&gt; information about polluting particles in our clouds. The size of these
&gt; polluting particles may differ infinitely from those extremely small ones
&gt; studied in CERN, but they connect because they are made up of them. So their
&gt; behaviour also depends upon the behaviour of those extremely small
&gt; particles. QM probably already plays a role in climate predictions, without
&gt; common people like me knowing that. At least that is what I hope. But if we
&gt; keep disconnecting both so called 'domains' or 'specialisms' - in this case
&gt; physics and climatology -, we may throw away the Golden Key of Connection. I
&gt; am sure if we would compare both method of acquisition and data of particles
&gt; of Climatologists and CERN, both could learn a lot from each other. What I
&gt; am sure of is that the Large Hadron Collider that is being build at CERN
&gt; right now is not meant to spin the heads of different scientist of different
&gt; scientific disciplines around and collide them. Let's hope it is under
&gt; construction to connect them as people, with new insights in our existence.

&gt; I'll leave it at that for now.

&gt; Thanks all for your posts, and cheers to all of you.

&gt; Sorry Jan, my friend,

&gt; epistemology has no maths tools on Kalabi  gauge symmetry, intellectually
&gt; not even divorced from that standard (you try it). EPR, QM are not
&gt; propositional knowledge. They have been observed million times in CERN and
&gt; experimental tests.

&gt; by all means not propositional, but FACTUAL.

&gt; Since no one can exactly define the imaginary wall between physics,
&gt; philosophy and psychology

&gt; It is well defined, you are ignorant to leading knowledge.

&gt; tools are characters, symbols and words. yes, the map is not the territory.
&gt; talking about sunshine and rain is symbolic, still describes physical
&gt; reality. sunshine/radiation exists.

&gt; Consciousness is a PROCESS, not  a thing.

&gt; You are lovely, but confusing categories.

&gt; Dear George,

&gt; You are right on the money. I agree with you, those topics are far more
&gt; fascinating (EPR) to me too, than epistemology. But traditional epistemology
&gt; has nothing to do with quantum physics,genetics and Newton paradoxes; it
&gt; deals in propositional or sentential terms.

&gt; EPR or DNA from digital information/entropy coding computational process is
&gt; part of knowledge touching philosophy, but epistemology is not even close
&gt; with its tools to deal with those subjects.

&gt; Just because all are knowledge based and have their philosophy (so is
&gt; everything, plumbing and gardening, fibre optics); it does not make them
&gt; epistemology.

&gt; I prefer, however EPR and Einstein like you. I join you in holly matrimony.
&gt; Keep it up, Quine is a genius, but I vote for your topics.

&gt; Good on you.

Thank you Chaz.

What the relevancy of my post truly is, in your case I have to leave that to
your personal interpretation as I can read in your first sentence.
Interpretations differ, but IMO one is not better than the other for reasons
of meaning. None of them all are universal in the sense they can claim the
truth, that's for sure. But since you seem to believe mine is not very
relevant, I'll leave it at that.

Thanks for the attempt at an answer but I'm not sure one word of this
is relevant.
May I remind you that I have never denied that GW is a fact. Nor have
I denied that it may well be a problem for many humans. I just feel
that when one considers the long duration of the earth's climate, the
minor changes in temperature over the last 30 years are not very
significant.
It still seems to me that the basic science which would link CO2 to GW
has not been done and that the possibility that such small increases
in CO2 could casue ANY temperature change are remote to say the least.
When we learn that the &quot;evidence&quot; linking CO2 to GW actually suggests
that CO2 is an indicator of GW and clearly not the cause of it, I am
forced to wonder at the political uses to which &quot;science&quot; has been put
in this field.
I rather think Feynman would call the CO2 debate &quot;cargo cult&quot; science.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; To Pete, Chazwin and George,

&gt; First sorry Chaz that I barged into this again - and my apologies to Pete
&gt; and George as well. I simply could not resist. But since this is an
&gt; Epistemology forum I found it only natural to do it. That's just me. Don't
&gt; bother about that. It may seem to you Chaz that GW has nothing to do with
&gt; EPR, QF and CERN, but I hope when I write this now that the three of you
&gt; will immediately feel spoken to, and your imaginations will hopefully
start
&gt; working to the limit just like mine and see a lot of connections that I
&gt; cannot even dream of at this moment. Let me give some examples why I
believe
&gt; they connect and they should connect, for epistemology should be and
remain
&gt; a forum of connection in my view.

&gt; 1.      No one can deny the realty of EPR, QF and CERN, and no one can
deny
&gt; they existed and still exist on the same earth the four of us live on
right
&gt; now (and luckily the four of us do not live alone here).
&gt; 2.      No one can deny the effects of temperature change we all feel at
&gt; this moment, including physicists, and those effects will not vanish, even
&gt; with a billion new insights or refutations in new theories in QM like
String
&gt; Theory and/or M-theory e.g.
&gt; 3.      For me it remains a big question what priorities we should chose
for
&gt; our debates here, including these two subjects at hand, but if they should
&gt; connect factually (to quote Pete), we are right on the money at this
moment
&gt; (to quote Pete :-)), and it is not apple sauce (to quote George). For me
&gt; they do connect factually, because language is a fact (and I thank
Einseele
&gt; for that, because he is also the one, amongst other people, that sparked
my
&gt; investigations into language). So you see Pete why I have to repeat that
&gt; literally everybody uses the same tools : characters, words as
combinations
&gt; of characters, and language in general. Those tools remain the same for
any
&gt; person, and the different characters, Pete, in the words 'factual' and
&gt; 'process' - (f, a, c, t, . and p, r, o, c, .) are not exclusive
possessions
&gt; of those words. We use those characters for thousands of other words too,
in
&gt; thousand of different combinations, and their connection through these
&gt; symbols of the alphabet do not suddenly vanish into thin air. For we build
&gt; sentences with those words, thousands of different sentences, exactly like
&gt; the ones I just build here, and the meaning of those sentences can only be
&gt; understood by connecting those characters and words again and again. We
&gt; already do that practice of connection automatically so quickly and easily
&gt; that we are not aware of that any more. That is because we already did for
&gt; tens of years in our life simply speaking and writing, i.e. millions of
&gt; times, through our memory. We are such trained character-athletes that we
&gt; quickly forget the distance we are still running. That distance only comes
&gt; back when we stumble over those characters, e.g. in difficult words like
&gt; &quot;Phenomenology&quot; some times, when we are tired. Our languages teachers
&gt; trained us to read and write in our primary and basic schools, but those
we
&gt; already forgot. I don't. They were the Masters of Connection, and I hope
&gt; they realise that.
&gt; 4.      Since for example the abbreviation GW (Global Warming) uses the
same
&gt; characters (and to a certain extend, symbols too) as &quot;G&quot; for Gravitation
and
&gt; &quot;W&quot; for &quot;Weak Force&quot; (QF), the connection to both of them is crystal clear
&gt; now, and should remain like that for ever. We should remember where these
&gt; characters come from - it is the alphabet -, we should remember that
&gt; language is their mother, and we should not try to think that suddenly
they
&gt; have nothing to do with each other because we get entangled in different
&gt; meanings or domains of knowledge. Since Gravitation plays an important

I don't think it fair to &quot;leave it at that&quot;. I am quite open for you

At the moment it seems to me that I have asked why kittens die under
water and you have answered: becasue dogs fall out of trees.

If you really think that CO2 is a cause of GW due to QM maybe its
mystical property is simply becasue you beleive it to be so, given
that all we would have to do  is simply believe that lolipops were the
cause, ban them, and hey presto no lolipops:no more GW.

Hello Chazwin.
Thank you for your reply.

Sorry, but I was wondering if that what I originally wrote really meant
anything to you. Your sentence (I quote you) &quot;Thanks for the attempt at an
answer, but I'm not sure one word of this is relevant&quot; was not received very
well here yesterday. I felt bad about that - it seemed that what I wrote was
complete rubbish for you -, but my interpretation was probably wrong ? Since
you made a second comment now, I see it probably was. I am mostly very
sensitive to the way people write something, maybe more than what they
write, and all too often I react accordingly.

Secondly this is going to be a difficult answer for me, because the subject
at hand remains entangled with so many other subjects (yet unknown ones as
well). My answer concerns mainly both our positions on this forum as
different persons, not in the least the different and varying feelings of
'importance' and 'unimportance' in both of us, and the very tenacious and
terrible problem of being 'negative' or 'positive'. This again may seem to
have nothing to do with Global Warming, but I can assure you they have
everything to do with the way people talk about that subject. Ways of
communication about something can change that something a lot in my view.
Imagine this for that. Imagine a period of ten years, during which we would
all completely stop talking about GW (because we developed too many
differences in opinion e.g., or simply because we forgot essential
communication skills like 'the right words in the right way' e.g.). Now
imagine the opposite : incessant world wide discussion and collection of
more and more new information. Would it make a difference how we perceive
that same GW, and would we act differently collectively accordingly ? I
think we would.

Very differing and sometimes extraordinary changing and varying feelings of
importance or unimportance, negative and positive, and the comparisons in
that regard we automatically seem to make with one another, can change
inside of me from second to second sometimes. Does it affect GW ? Since GW
is a matter of (un)importance, positive and negative as well, and since
anyone discussing it is also (un)important, they cannot be separated. Do
those qualities not always play a big part in anyone here on this forum ?
And isn't that rightly so ? I might be wrong, and I certainly do not want to
judge that in anyone else's place - I think about Peter and George now too
-, but don't we often compare the (un)importance of ourselves to one
another, in ever so many unknown ways to each other (specifically connected
to the subject and even some delicate sentence or even word at hand),
combined with feeling positive or negative ?
For that reason alone, and for some other ones as well I hope that will
become clear later, I consider this post of the utmost importance to me. GW
is a part of that, but (not) as big as it may seem now.

&gt; Thank you Chaz.
&gt; What the relevancy of my post truly is, in your case I have to leave that
to
&gt; your personal interpretation as I can read in your first sentence.
&gt; Interpretations differ, but IMO one is not better than the other for
reasons
&gt; of meaning. None of them all are universal in the sense they can claim the
&gt; truth, that's for sure. But since you seem to believe mine is not very
&gt; relevant, I'll leave it at that.

Chazwin:
I don't think it fair to &quot;leave it at that&quot;. I am quite open for you to
explain just &quot;how&quot; your posting was relevant - unless your ideas negate the
meaning of &quot;how&quot;. At the moment it seems to me that I have asked why kittens
die under water and you have answered: because dogs fall out of trees.

Jan:
Exactly. My interpretation of your answer was wrong. It was a reduction.
Sorry. About the &quot;how&quot; we'll have to talk more later, but in fact we are
already busy here.
Fine image, the kittens and the dogs. Let me rescue both of them, by saying
that we have to prevent me becoming the water causing you becoming the
ground. The trees were already there a long time ago I suppose. They were
reflection.

Chazwin:
If you really think that CO2 is a cause of GW due to QM maybe its
mystical property is simply because you believe it to be so, given
that all we would have to do is simply believe that lollipops were the
cause, ban them, and hey presto no lollipops : no more GW.

Jan:
Well, let me just say that I think indeed GW is a mystery - no one knows
it's true nature, and the ones that do feel too important or too little (and
shut up or shout accordingly) -, and that a lot of very important (combined)
scientific data of very important climatologists and physicists still have
to be gathered to know exactly what is going on. But it is not simply a
matter of CO2 and QM. The indeterministic and probabilistic nature of GW
reflects QM perfectly, and we would love it so much to be deterministic,
mechanistic and therefore perfectly predictive to feel safe and sound, that
some would almost kill anyone that disagrees with anything said about it.
Sadly, reducing GW to CO2 and QM is exactly such determinism, with at least
one paradox included. You are right in that regard Chazwin, and also not
(you understand). For sure this is not a time to go back to Newton to ask
him hard questions about GW. This is a time to ask QM and the best String
Theorists for some clear explanations about the connection between physics
and climatology, and a time for us to probe carefully and critically into
preliminary results. Personally I know little to nothing about both domains,
so specialists, start talking and start explaining. But please remember my
sentence about importance or unimportance. For that sentence will enable or
disable your conversation with whoever takes part in it after a while, when
you forget it. It would not in another regard, but our Cargo Cult Science
may also be (un)important. For there is our language again ...

To be continued.

Cheers Chaz !

&gt; like
&gt; &gt; the ones I just build here, and the meaning of those sentences can only
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; understood by connecting those characters and words again and again. We
&gt; &gt; already do that practice of connection automatically so quickly and
&gt; easily
&gt; &gt; that we are not aware of that any more. That is because we already did
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; tens of years in our life simply speaking and writing, i.e. millions of
&gt; &gt; times, through our memory. We are such trained character-athletes that
&gt; we
&gt; &gt; quickly forget the distance we are still running. That distance only
&gt; comes
&gt; &gt; back when we stumble over those characters, e.g. in difficult words like
&gt; &gt; &quot;Phenomenology&quot; some times, when we are tired. Our languages teachers
&gt; &gt; trained us to read and write in our primary and basic schools, but those
&gt; we
&gt; &gt; already forgot. I don't. They were the Masters of Connection, and I hope
&gt; &gt; they realise that.
&gt; &gt; 4.      Since for example the abbreviation GW (Global Warming) uses the
&gt; same
&gt; &gt; characters (and to a certain extend, symbols too) as &quot;G&quot; for Gravitation
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &quot;W&quot; for &quot;Weak Force&quot; (QF), the connection to both of them is crystal
&gt; clear
&gt; &gt; now, and should remain like that for ever. We should remember where
&gt; these
&gt; &gt; characters come from - it is the alphabet -, we should remember that
&gt; &gt; language is their mother, and we should not try to think that suddenly
&gt; they
&gt; &gt; have nothing to do with each other because we get entangled in different
&gt; &gt; meanings or domains of knowledge. Since Gravitation plays an important
&gt; role
&gt; &gt; in the weather, and since the sudden flooding of CERN with water (not
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; criticism) would effect the knowledge in QF to a larger extend than many
&gt; &gt; physicist in the world would like, let anybody here try to disconnect
&gt; our
&gt; &gt; two subjects at hand again. I think that is impossible. In CERN that
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; not be a matter of weak or strong force of any person or any (nucleus
&gt; of)
&gt; &gt; particle any more ; for the ones that were working there at that moment
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; would immediately become a matter a survival.
&gt; &gt; 5.      QM should play a major role in climate predictions, for these
&gt; &gt; predictions are also based upon processing and interpreting
&gt; computational
&gt; &gt; information about polluting particles in our clouds. The size of these
&gt; &gt; polluting particles may differ infinitely from those extremely small
&gt; ones
&gt; &gt; studied in CERN, but they connect because they are made up of them. So
&gt; their
&gt; &gt; behaviour also depends upon the behaviour of those extremely small
&gt; &gt; particles. QM probably already plays a role in climate predictions,
&gt; without
&gt; &gt; common people like me knowing that. At least that is what I hope. But if
&gt; we
&gt; &gt; keep disconnecting both so called 'domains' or 'specialisms' - in this
&gt; case
&gt; &gt; physics and climatology -, we may throw away the Golden Key of
&gt; Connection. I
&gt; &gt; am sure if we would compare both method of acquisition and data of
&gt; particles
&gt; &gt; of Climatologists and CERN, both could learn a lot from each other. What
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; am sure of is that the Large Hadron Collider that is being build at CERN
&gt; &gt; right now is not meant to spin the heads of different scientist of
&gt; different
&gt; &gt; scientific disciplines around and collide them. Let's hope it is under
&gt; &gt; construction to connect them as people, with new insights in our
&gt; existence.

&gt; &gt; I'll leave it at that for now.

&gt; &gt; Thanks all for your posts, and cheers to all of you.

&gt; &gt; Sorry Jan, my friend,

&gt; &gt; epistemology has no maths tools on Kalabi  gauge symmetry,
&gt; intellectually
&gt; &gt; not even divorced from that standard (you try it). EPR, QM are not
&gt; &gt; propositional knowledge. They have been observed million times in CERN
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; experimental tests.

&gt; &gt; by all means not propositional, but FACTUAL.

&gt; &gt; Since no one can exactly define the imaginary wall between physics,
&gt; &gt; philosophy and psychology

&gt; &gt; It is well defined, you are ignorant to leading knowledge.

&gt; &gt; tools are characters, symbols and words. yes, the map is not the
&gt; territory.
&gt; &gt; talking about sunshine and rain is symbolic, still describes physical
&gt; &gt; reality. sunshine/radiation exists.

&gt; &gt; Consciousness is a PROCESS, not  a thing.

&gt; &gt; You are lovely, but confusing categories.

Hey PJ,

A fine post indeed ! I was familiar with the idea but you formulated it
perfectly.

I would be very happy to agree with you if we could be absolutely sure
man-made GW (MMGW) is a non-fact. But IMO we are not. Indeed this has become
a huge political issue with all its illnesses of power, money, corruption
and ideology, but our sciences that provide conflicting date to support or
dismiss MMGW have those illnesses too. We only have to prevent ourselves to
catch all those illnesses from them, on this forum as well.

I am not a believer of anything, but IMO it would be foolish to live on this
rock pretending our climate does not exist and therefore does not change
anything, hence we can pollute as much as we like. That I would call
dangerous, insane and insanely irresponsible too. Whether our average global
temperature rises or falls due to our own fault may not seem very important
now because the extremes in temperature and storms did not seem to grow very
much yet and therefore did not affect some of us individually yet. But the
moment e.g. it starts to become 45 degrees Celsius or even more here, I can
assure you that little will be needed for some people in my immediate
surroundings to die immediately (even myself) if the wind suddenly stopped
blowing. If some would experience sudden breathing problems e.g., and nobody
would be around to help immediately .  If certain immediate and preventive
measures wouldn't be taken by some empathising people swiftly and
effectively at that moment, on some scale yet unknown, I'm afraid it would
not matter very much either if MMGW were an ideological issue or not. Those
'empathising people' at that moment would preferably be our next door
neighbours and ourselves, for reasons of distance and speed, and differences
in ideology in general could even be the cause of neglect and death, that's
for sure. For weak subconscious convictions have a tendency to weaken our
attention for important details in extreme circumstances. Sadly, the
question of responsibility then would never be posed again by people who
actually die. So we might better think hard and well now on the matter of
who or what is responsible for those rare extreme temperatures (we see them
here in Europe right now, and they are unheard of until now), for future
people not to establish that it was us that did not act in advance because
we thought is was only politics. Ideology in politics works both ways in
MMGW. If MMGW is a lie and ideology supports that lie, ideology is very
destructive indeed. But if it is true and ideology supports it, it can be
very beneficial for necessary change. It is for us to find out which is
which, not fall asleep and suddenly suffocate in heat and ignorance. IMO it
is too easy e.g. for any given rich person with two or more big cars and a
castle that can house a hundred people to say MMGW is a matter of ideology
and therefore crap. If one of his big cars with a perfectly functioning,
very expensive air-conditioning inside of it drove by a window of a shack
were an old lady were suffocating because the heat were unbearable, and the
cloud of gas out of that car's exhaust pipe were to enter that window and
caused that lady to stop breathing for ever, I know who and what would be
responsible for her death. It would be the result of a combination of
capitalist ideology, climate change, MMGC - Man Made Global Change - and
unreflecting narcissism.

Cheers to you PJ.

&gt; and George as well. I simply could not resist. But since this is an
&gt; Epistemology forum I found it only natural to do it. That's just me. Don't
&gt; bother about that. It may seem to you Chaz that GW has nothing to do with
&gt; EPR, QF and CERN, but I hope when I write this now that the three of you
&gt; will immediately feel spoken to, and your imaginations will hopefully
start
&gt; working to the limit just like mine and see a lot of connections that I
&gt; cannot even dream of at this moment. Let me give some examples why I
believe
&gt; they connect and they should connect, for epistemology should be and
remain
&gt; a forum of connection in my view.

&gt; 1.      No one can deny the realty of EPR, QF and CERN, and no one can
deny
&gt; they existed and still exist on the same earth the four of us live on
right
&gt; now (and luckily the four of us do not live alone here).
&gt; 2.      No one can deny the effects of temperature change we all feel at
&gt; this moment, including physicists, and those effects will not vanish, even
&gt; with a billion new insights or refutations in new theories in QM like
String
&gt; Theory and/or M-theory e.g.
&gt; 3.      For me it remains a big question what priorities we should chose
for
&gt; our debates here, including these two subjects at hand, but if they should
&gt; connect factually (to quote Pete), we are right on the money at this
moment
&gt; (to quote Pete :-)), and it is not apple sauce (to quote George). For me
&gt; they do connect factually, because language is a fact (and I thank
Einseele
&gt; for that, because he is also the one, amongst other people, that sparked
my
&gt; investigations into language). So you see Pete why I have to repeat that
&gt; literally everybody uses the same tools : characters, words as
combinations
&gt; of characters, and language in general. Those tools remain the same for
any
&gt; person, and the different characters, Pete, in the words 'factual' and
&gt; 'process' - (f, a, c, t, . and p, r, o, c, .) are not exclusive
possessions
&gt; of those words. We use those characters for thousands of other words too,
in
&gt; thousand of different combinations, and their connection through these
&gt; symbols of the alphabet do not suddenly vanish into thin air. For we build
&gt; sentences with those words, thousands of different sentences, exactly like
&gt; the ones I just build here, and the meaning of those sentences can only be
&gt; understood by connecting those characters and words again and again. We
&gt; already do that practice of connection automatically so quickly and easily
&gt; that we are not aware of that any more. That is because we already did for
&gt; tens of years in our life simply speaking and writing, i.e. millions of
&gt; times, through our memory. We are such trained character-athletes that we
&gt; quickly forget the distance we are still running. That distance only comes
&gt; back when we stumble over those characters, e.g. in difficult words like
&gt; &quot;Phenomenology&quot; some times, when we are tired. Our languages teachers
&gt; trained us to read and write in our primary and basic schools, but those
we
&gt; already forgot. I don't. They were the Masters of Connection, and I hope
&gt; they realise that.
&gt; 4.      Since for example the abbreviation GW (Global Warming) uses the
same
&gt; characters (and to a certain extend, symbols too) as &quot;G&quot; for Gravitation
and
&gt; &quot;W&quot; for &quot;Weak Force&quot; (QF), the connection to both of them is crystal clear
&gt; now, and should remain like that for ever. We should remember where these
&gt; characters come from - it is the alphabet -, we should remember that
&gt; language is their mother, and we should not try to think that suddenly
they
&gt; have nothing to do with each other because we get entangled in different
&gt; meanings or domains of knowledge. Since Gravitation plays an important
role
&gt; in the weather, and since the sudden flooding of CERN with water (not with
&gt; criticism) would effect the knowledge in QF to a larger extend than many
&gt; physicist in the world would like, let anybody here try to disconnect our
&gt; two subjects at hand again. I think that is impossible. In CERN that would
&gt; not be a matter of weak or strong force of any person or any (nucleus of)
&gt; particle any more ; for the ones that were working there at that moment it
&gt; would immediately become a matter a survival.
&gt; 5.      QM should play a major role in climate predictions, for these
&gt; predictions are also based upon processing and interpreting computational
&gt; information about polluting particles in our clouds. The size of these
&gt; polluting particles may differ infinitely from those extremely small ones
&gt; studied in CERN, but they connect because they are made up of them. So
their
&gt; behaviour also depends upon the

&gt; I rather think Feynman would call the CO2 debate &quot;cargo cult&quot; science.

The conclusion of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is
that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50
years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is
not due to known natural causes alone.
http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/wg1/Report/AR4WG1_Pub_SPM-v2.pdf (page 10)

I don't think the IPCC has overlooked much, it has been around for about two
decades now, without finding anything of substance that would lead to a
different conclusion. There are plenty of others that have looked at
alternative views, only to conclude that it didn't add up, e.g. have a look
at:
http://environment.newscientist.com/climatemyths

If anyone could come up with a story that pointed to a different conclusion,
that would be very spectacular indeed and it would make this person
instantly rich just by selling such a story to the many media anxious to
come up with something new on the topic of global warming. So, you don't
need to be afraid that basic scientific (as well as other) research won't
continue on global warming for many years. If something new would come up
that would lead to a different conclusion, then there's no reason to believe
that this wouldn't get the attention it deserved.

But given the urgency of the problem that global warming poses, there's no
point in waiting for further diagnosis and there's no reason to postpone
taking adequate action. Scientists typically refuse to work on articulating
such action, under the pretence that there was a line between politics and
science that scientists couldn't cross without compromising some assumed
objectivity. Scientists will prefer to duck their responsibility and focus
on further research, which is also typically the only way for them to make a
living.

Modern epistemologists will point out that this latter attitude by
scientists is unwarrented, given the illusive nature of objectivity and the
money and trust that society has vested in them. Moreover, as I have been
pointing out for a long time, some conclusions go beyond both science and
politics. Scientists are habitually ducking their responsibility when
referring the task of articulating action to politicians. Scientists should
not refer such a task to politicians, since some things should not be left
to politicians to decide. We all have a duty to speak out when something is
wrong. If we handed the task of dealing with global warming to right-wing
politicians, they would propose buying off those who wanted action,
resulting in no effective action at all. If we handed the task to left-wing
politicians, they would increase taxes and use the proceeds partly to
increase an inefficient government bureaucracy, in which case nothing
effective would be achieved either. As long as no there's no alternative
available, the rich will continue with polluting activities (because they
can afford to do so), while the poor have no alterbnatives either, so they
will be given the other part of the tax proceeds with the argument that they
needed help with the increased cost of energy and food, which will only lead
to them to continue with or take up further polluting activities.

It is up to good epistemology to point out that this isn't a scientific
issue. We're not waiting for further research teams to descend on Antarctica
and drill holes. We know enough to convince us that action needs to be
taken. But neither should we wait for those who seek to advance a specific
political ideology, to articulate the necessary action for us. No, we should
all take responsibility ourselves and both take action regarding our own
lifestyle, as well as regarding our logic. Because the answer as to what
should be done is so simple and straightforward. The best way to
decrease emissions of carbon dioxide is to tax fossil fuel and use the
proceeds to subsidize local supply of clean and renewable energy, which
will make the policy doubly effective. Similarly, the best way to
decrease emissions of methane is to tax what's responsible for that, e.g. by
introducing a tax on the sale of meat. Again, to make such a policy doubly
effective, the proceeds should be used to subsidize local supply of
alternative food, e.g. in vegetarian restaurants.

These are only two out of my ten recommendations to deal with global
warming, but it goes to show that epistemology can reach conclusions that
are to some extent beyond science and also beyond politics, establishing
epistemology as an area of immense importance on its own. The importance
of global warming in epistemological discussions is that it so clearly
shows what happens when epistemology is neglected in society. Indeed, it is
precisely because epistemology is so ignored in society that we're in such
big problems with climate change. As discussed, scientists will be
inclined to stay away from the task of articulating what action should be
taken, while we cannot trust politicians to come up with effective policies
either - global warming is an issue demonstrating that both capitalism and
socialism are dead. It's up to epistemologists to articulate the action plan
and it's up to society to listen to epistemologists (for a change). Will
society do so? How would people know whether I am right on this? Well, this
is precisely the kind of &quot;knowledge&quot; that epistemology should focus on. Of
course I am right, because the reality of global warming urges us all to
figure things out and anyone who thinks matters through will feel that both
scientists and politicians have let us down and that what I say makes sense.

&gt; &gt; &gt; am sure if we would compare both method of acquisition and data of
&gt; &gt; particles
&gt; &gt; &gt; of Climatologists and CERN, both could learn a lot from each other. What
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; am sure of is that the Large Hadron Collider that is being build at CERN
&gt; &gt; &gt; right now is not meant to spin the heads of different scientist of
&gt; &gt; different
&gt; &gt; &gt; scientific disciplines around and collide them. Let's hope it is under
&gt; &gt; &gt; construction to connect them as people, with new insights in our
&gt; &gt; existence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry Jan, my friend,

&gt; &gt; &gt; epistemology has no maths tools on Kalabi  gauge symmetry,
&gt; &gt; intellectually
&gt; &gt; &gt; not even divorced from that standard (you try it). EPR, QM are not
&gt; &gt; &gt; propositional knowledge. They have been observed million times in CERN
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; experimental tests.

&gt; &gt; &gt; by all means not propositional, but FACTUAL.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Since no one can exactly define the imaginary wall between physics,
&gt; &gt; &gt; philosophy and psychology

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is well defined, you are ignorant to leading knowledge.

&gt; &gt; &gt; tools are characters, symbols and words. yes, the map is not the
&gt; &gt; territory.
&gt; &gt; &gt; talking about sunshine and rain is symbolic, still describes physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; reality. sunshine/radiation exists.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Consciousness is a PROCESS, not  a thing.

There are many stories with different conclusions. Take a look at &quot;CO2

No one can explain how an increase in CO2 of 0.01% can affect

&gt; But given the urgency of the problem that global warming poses, there's no

&gt; taking adequate action. Scientists typically refuse to work on articulating
&gt; such action, under the pretence that there was a line between politics and
&gt; science that scientists couldn't cross without compromising some assumed

&gt; on further research, which is also typically the only way for them to make a
&gt; living.

&gt; Modern epistemologists will point out that this latter attitude by
&gt; scientists is unwarrented, given the illusive nature of objectivity and the
&gt; money and trust that society has vested in them. Moreover, as I have been
&gt; pointing out for a long time, some conclusions go beyond both science and
&gt; politics. Scientists are habitually ducking their responsibility when
&gt; referring the task of articulating action to politicians. Scientists should
&gt; not refer such a task to politicians, since some things should not be left
&gt; to politicians to decide. We all have a duty to speak out when something is
&gt; wrong. If we handed the task of dealing with global warming to right-wing
&gt; politicians, they would propose buying off those who wanted action,
&gt; resulting in no effective action at all. If we handed the task to left-wing
&gt; politicians, they would increase taxes and use the proceeds partly to
&gt; increase an inefficient government bureaucracy, in which case nothing
&gt; effective would be achieved either. As long as no there's no alternative
&gt; available, the rich will continue with polluting activities (because they
&gt; can afford to do so), while the poor have no alterbnatives either, so they
&gt; will be given the other part of the tax proceeds with the argument that they
&gt; needed help with the increased cost of energy and food, which will only lead
&gt; to them to continue with or take up further polluting activities.

I am willing to accept any changes in energy use that result in less
pollution and more conservation.  The GW issue is used for that
reason. But the reality is that alternative sources of energy are now
being sought becasue oil is expensive and this makes the new sources
competative. But I think we are making a serious mistake if will
wrongly attribute the correct causes of global warming. From 1940 to
1970 we witnessed Global cooling despite a massive increase in CO2
use. The effect was so great that climate scientists were warning us
about the next ice-age.  Now temperatures have returned to their 1940s
level, CO2 it seems has played no role in this. If global temperatures
should start to decline again: what is it we are going to tell the
public? What faith should the populace have in science if we are
talking a load of bollocks?

&gt; It is up to good epistemology to point out that this isn't a scientific
&gt; issue. We're not waiting for further research teams to descend on Antarctica
&gt; and drill holes. We know enough to convince us that action needs to be
&gt; taken. But neither should we wait for those who seek to advance a specific
&gt; political ideology, to articulate the necessary action for us. No, we should
&gt; all take responsibility ourselves and both take action regarding our own
&gt; lifestyle, as well as regarding our logic. Because the answer as to what
&gt; should be done is so simple and straightforward. The best way to
&gt; decrease emissions of carbon dioxide is to tax fossil fuel and use the
&gt; proceeds to subsidize local supply of clean and renewable energy, which
&gt; will make the policy doubly effective. Similarly, the best way to
&gt; decrease emissions of methane is to tax what's responsible for that, e.g. by
&gt; introducing a tax on the sale of meat. Again, to make such a policy doubly
&gt; effective, the proceeds should be used to subsidize local supply of
&gt; alternative food, e.g. in vegetarian restaurants.

&gt; These are only two out of my ten recommendations to deal with global
&gt; warming, but it goes to show that epistemology can reach conclusions that
&gt; are to some extent beyond science and also beyond politics, establishing
&gt; epistemology as an area of immense importance on its own. The importance
&gt; of global warming in epistemological discussions is that it so clearly
&gt; shows what happens when epistemology is neglected in society. Indeed, it is
&gt; precisely because epistemology is so ignored in society that we're in such
&gt; big problems with climate change. As discussed, scientists will be
&gt; inclined to stay away from the task of articulating what action should be
&gt; taken, while we cannot trust politicians to come up with effective policies
&gt; either - global warming is an issue demonstrating that both capitalism and
&gt; socialism are dead.

This is utter nonsense. Global Warming is a fashion that will die a
death, it has less credibility than Nazism and Stalinism. Capitalism
is still going strong and liberal ideas that have harnessed this force
for the general good are continuing to re-dress the wealth polarising
effects on the one hand by progressive taxes whilst providing a
working infrastructure in which capitalism can find markets whith
which to thrive.
If socialism was based on want and capitalism was based on greed then
Global Warming politics is based on guilt and shame.

It's up to epistemologists to articulate the action plan

======================================================
There is an option, reserved for panic stricken
bandwagon sheep: Under the device &quot;URGENCY&quot; lose no
time for thinking and jump into such pit as your
driver chooses, without forgetting to fatten on the
way the mafias of his penchant.

After this Epilogue instead of Prologue let's go to
the tahles.
======================================================

Global Warming (GW) is doubtless one of the most
important, critical problems the mankind is facing.
It concerns science, sociology, economy and politics.
Unfortunately, it became entirely confined in politics
which discovered its panic generating quality. Now,
panic is the strongest lever in political campaigns,
driving bandwagon sheep to jump like one yahoo into
such precipices as may please the driver.

The discovery of GW as panic generating political
lever has to be ascribed to Margaret Thatcher who did
not care a button about climate, but searched a ruse
to suppress the revolt of callously exploited coal
miners. Using it slickly and astutely in her wake,
some Obama or Clinton may be elected. With what impact
on the GW and its sequels?
Rigorously, NONE.
They don't care a damn about it, else than as the
political lever and even if they cared, they could not
do anything.

Let's try to examine the problem coolly and logically.

GW has two kinds of causes: human and natural, the
latter earth bound and cosmic.
Starting with natural, we observe that GW happened
several times in history as one of two phases of a
more general cyclic structure GW/GF (Global Freezing).
As it's easier to explicate separately GW and GF, we
shall start by it before moving to their more complex
cyclic reversion and succession. Historic cycles had
clearly natural causes, most of which are unexplained
if not unknown. One, however, is rigorously, albeit
only qualitatively known: melting and re-freezing of
glaciers and other ice caps. We shall use it as a
typical example of natural causes at work.

Earth surface encompasses white ice areas reflecting
heat radiated by the sun and other dark ones absorbing
it. In a steady state of ice/not-ice distribution and
constant amount of radiated heat, the absorption to
reflection ratio stays constant and the climate does
not change. Yet, the smallest distortion may change
this equilibrium.

Let's suppose that one year the sun emits more heat
and then returns to the constant yearly amount.
The triggering change warms up the earth more than
usually, so that more ice melts. Then, next year less
heat is reflected and more absorbed, so that still
more ice melts and we enter the recursive chain of the
GW phase. Nothing seems to stay in the way of earth
losing all its ice caps and becoming a Sahara
interspaced with hot seas. Yet, each GW was followed
by a GF, in turn by a GW, etc.

Which natural mechanism may reverse GW into GF and
vice versa?

There must be several, both earth bound and cosmic
and mostly unknown, but for our ice driven cycle the
answer is clear: the salt.

Oceans are salted and salt waters freeze at lower
temperature than the sweet. Snows and ice melting
copiously during the GW, flood oceans with sweet water
decreasing their salinity and increasing their
freezing temperature, so that over a threshold they
start to freeze again over larger surfaces and the
phase moves to GF and towards a new glacial period.

Pseudo-scientific committees commanded by politicians,
proclaimed that GW is caused with 80% certainty by
human actions, and reversible by their reversal.

Double lie:

1.&quot;Caused&quot; should be replaced with &quot;triggered&quot;. It's
possible that greenhouse triggered GW, as any tiny
distortion could disarrange the fragile unstable
equilibrium. However, once triggered and entered in
the ice melting phase, GW is CAUSED by ice melting.
Similarly, a tour of pedals may push a bike over the
summit and TRIGGER its descent whose CAUSE, however,
is gravity, a natural agent.

2.Supposing that Greenhouse indeed triggered the GW,
its triggering effect loses all avail upon entering
the ice melting phase, which thrives by its own
recursion and certainly cannot be &quot;un-triggered&quot; by
decreasing of emissions nor even by their hypothetical
total suspension. The pedals might have triggered the
descent, but you may turn them backwards on your
freewheel bike till you are blue in the face. Gravity
will not notice it and the descent will continue
undisturbed, just like the GW, unaffected by Kyoto
Protocols, by green presidential campaigns and by the
anti-American propaganda. Until the bike has passed
the valley and, always by natural causes, starts
climbing the opposite slope, or the GW phase switches,
always by natural causes, to the GF phase.

Which actions seem advisable in this light?

1.Dissociate GW from Pollution, admit that it is
inevitable and start immediately to plan actions
aiming at saving millions endangered by inundations,
(expatriation, artificial islands, etc.) and other
sequels of the GW.

2.In order to concretize and to finance these actions,
stop subsidizing fraudulent and useless phantasms such
as intermittent energy sources (photo-voltaic and
mainly the wind mafia steeling heavy billions from the
tax payers and sharing them with corrupted
politicians.)
Allegorically speaking, stop flagellating the see with
chains, in the wake of Xerxes, while fattening chain
manufacturers.

Dissociate pollution from GW. Pollution is a critical
problem in itself and should be treated as such, but
separately from GW. And if we want to discuss it, we
should do it in a separate thread.

There is of course another option, reserved for panic
stricken bandwagon sheep: Under the device &quot;URGENCY&quot;
lose no time for thinking and jump into such pit as
your driver chooses, without forgetting to fatten on
the way the mafias of his penchant.

Absolutely magnificent post Sam.

I cannot thank you enough for this.

If I see only the amount of work alone you must have put into this long
post, and if I click on those fine links and read the massive amounts of
complex scientific information that is presented there, I can only thank you
for your brilliantly formulated synthesis. I thank you as well for the
supporting and sound arguments of probably hundreds of scientists on those
links, that clearly do their utmost best to provide as much evidence to the
general public as they can, on that traitorous and extremely dangerous
subject of Man Made Global Warming (MMGW). You were very right to spend so
much time on it, for the importance of that subject can never be
underestimated. It concerns us all and every single living creature on this
planet, and the more I read about it thanks to you, the more I am convinced
of its importance, and the more I start to see how that crazy and devious
creature called man is trying again and again to cover up both truth and
lies about it. Low, narcissist reasons for that cover up are all over the
place again.

I did not study thoroughly yet all the information on those links you
presented, and that will probably take me a week or more, but one thing I
already assumed before I have become sure of now : reducing MMGW to a few
quick lines about imagined political scams or short chimerical personal
perceptions is simplistic, not serious and very naive. If one does that, one
could easily and lazily say even better that nothing exists and therefore
any problem, even the smallest one, does not exist either, and abandon MMGW
subsequently to put their mind to sleep for ever. Since I think at least
some people already do that, in this subject I see that dangerous nihilism
appearing again. That sleep of mind is the same naive and dangerous sleep of
people that were mislead by totalitarian rules like Hitler and Stalin in the
past, who used their own sick nihilism and paranoia to commit murder on a
monstrous scale. The subject of MMGW, and the new nihilism some people
apparently want to attach to it by saying it does not exist, will be used by
some of those new nihilists in governmental positions for the same purposes.
That is, if we do not all wake up. And now the scale of murder will not be
limited to only a number of countries on our planet. This time the murder
will be truly Total, in every sense of that word, for MMGW is truly Global
as well.

As I already showed on this forum a number of times - and saying I proved it
would be wrong -, the thinking path of reduction may lead us away from the
truth, and the path of addition may bring us closer to it without end.
Self-evidently such a general and all encompassing statement has to be
debated and thought through carefully, because we have to apply it to every
single issue first to establish firmly and definitively if it works
everywhere indeed. For if we don't, we would make the same mistake of
reduction all over again, and quickly repeat again as well that we found the
Holy Grail of Truth. Too many people already did that before us, mostly with
catastrophic results. Since MMGW is such an issue, I believe that on that
subject as well we'll still have a lot of addition to do - none the least
addition of scientific information - before we can even say anything.
Stopping addition may prevent us from finding and knowing crucial new data.
That kind of data will probably shed a new and surprising light again and
agian, like it mostly does, on the whole of that strange and unknown thing
that is mostly much more complex than we claim, think or even imagine it is
: the truth. But theoretical addition is only worth so much if it is
accompanied by practical addition, if such action is logical and necessary
in the theory itself. It is clear to me that the ones who add nothing
theoretically to MMGW, most likely do nothing practically as well. The ones
that still do a lot and only seem not to think about it, have already
thought about it long and hard a long time ago. It may well be they've
already added more theoretically than some scientist now can only dream of.
The only problem may be that this information is just not communicated to us
yet. Practice never occurs without a minimum of theory. So if we want to do
a lot about MMGW, we also have to know a lot. And that 'knowing a lot' I' am
afraid, is not yet the case.

Cheers to you friend !

A few very small details in your post I disagreed with, but let me study
that formidable amount of information on those links first before I do that.

The conclusion of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is
that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50
years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is
not due to known natural causes alone.

http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/wg1/Report/AR4WG1_Pub_SPM-v2.pdf (page 10)

I don't think the IPCC has overlooked much, it has been around for about two
decades now, without finding anything of substance that would lead to a
different conclusion. There are plenty of others that have looked at
alternative views, only to conclude that it didn't add up, e.g. have a look
at:

http://environment.newscientist.com/climatemyths

If anyone could come up with a story that pointed to a different conclusion,
that would be very spectacular indeed and it would make this person
instantly rich just by selling such a story to the many media anxious to
come up with something new on the topic of global warming. So, you don't
need to be afraid that basic scientific (as well as other) research won't
continue on global warming for many years. If something new would come up
that would lead to a different conclusion, then there's no reason to believe
that this wouldn't get the attention it deserved.

But given the urgency of the problem that global warming poses, there's no
point in waiting for further diagnosis and there's no reason to postpone
taking adequate action. Scientists typically refuse to work on articulating
such action, under the pretence that there was a line between politics and

I rather have to agree with Chazwin, PJ, but I do believe you have a point
with ideology. The real ideology though that poses a threat to all of us is
not Marxism. I know no one who really knows what Marxism really means. For
that one has to study Marx thoroughly enough. Due to the extremely
complicated large volumes he wrote, and the global context of those volumes,
IMO that would take any given person with average intelligence like all of
us at least three to four years to digest, and foremost, interpret correctly
to an acceptable limit. No, the real ideology that is known all to well to
all of us is Capitalism. In contradiction to Marxism the ideas of Capitalism
are extremely simple : exclusive financial profit, narcissism and death. Any
fool that knows the meaning those six words can understand it in one minute.
That is one of the reasons why billions of people are so seduced by it, and
that is a reason as well why they will die inside of it before their time
has come. So let us not criticize Marxism here, before we know it well
enough to do so. Let's focus our attention on Capitalism, and see how that
ideology responds to MMGW ! For respond it has already done, and it made
things worse than it already had before.

Cheers !

The IPCC is a well-known mouthpiece for Marxist propaganda, using GW as a
cover.  Their real agenda is to control thought and turn us all into
vegetarians.

Interestingly, it has always been temperature which rises first, then
CO2...That is why Gore had to explain why he reversed dating on the CO2/temp
chart in his scarumentary.

&gt; &gt; in CO2 could casue ANY temperature change are remote to say the least.

&gt; &gt; I rather think Feynman would call the CO2 debate &quot;cargo cult&quot; science.

&gt; The conclusion of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is
&gt; that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50
&gt; years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is
&gt; not due to known natural causes alone.
&gt; http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/wg1/Report/AR4WG1_Pub_SPM-v2.pdf (page 10)

&gt; I don't think the IPCC has overlooked much, it has been around for about
&gt; two decades now, without finding anything of substance that would lead to a
&gt; different conclusion. There are plenty of others that have looked at
&gt; alternative views, only to conclude that it didn't add up, e.g. have a
&gt; look at:
&gt; http://environment.newscientist.com/climatemyths

&gt; If anyone could come up with a story that pointed to a different
&gt; conclusion, that would be very spectacular indeed and it would make this
&gt; person instantly rich just by selling such a story to the many media anxious
&gt; to come up with something new on the topic of global warming. So, you don't
&gt; need to be afraid that basic scientific (as well as other) research won't
&gt; continue on global warming for many years. If something new would come up
&gt; that would lead to a different conclusion, then there's no reason to believe
&gt; that this wouldn't get the attention it deserved.

&gt; But given the urgency of the problem that global warming poses, there's no
&gt; point in waiting for further diagnosis and there's no reason to postpone
&gt; taking adequate action. Scientists typically refuse to work on articulating
&gt; such action, under the pretence that there was a line between politics and
&gt; science that scientists couldn't cross without compromising some assumed
&gt; objectivity. Scientists will prefer to duck their responsibility and focus
&gt; on further research, which is also typically the only way for them to make a
&gt; living.

&gt; Modern epistemologists will point out that this latter attitude by
&gt; scientists is unwarrented, given the illusive nature of objectivity and the
&gt; money and trust that society has vested in them. Moreover, as I have been
&gt; pointing out for a long time, some conclusions go beyond both science and
&gt; politics. Scientists are habitually ducking their responsibility when
&gt; referring the task of articulating action to politicians. Scientists should
&gt; not refer such a task to politicians, since some things should not be left
&gt; to politicians to decide. We all have a duty to speak out when something is
&gt; wrong. If we handed the task of dealing with global warming to right-wing
&gt; politicians, they would propose buying off those who wanted action,
&gt; resulting in no effective action at all. If we handed the task to left-wing
&gt; politicians, they would increase taxes and use the proceeds partly to
&gt; increase an inefficient government bureaucracy, in which case nothing
&gt; effective would be achieved either. As long as no there's no alternative
&gt; available, the rich will continue with polluting activities (because they
&gt; can afford to do so), while the poor have no alterbnatives either, so they
&gt; will be given the other part of the tax proceeds with the argument that they
&gt; needed help with the increased cost of energy and food, which will only lead
&gt; to them to continue with or take up further polluting activities.

&gt; It is up to good epistemology to point out that this isn't a scientific
&gt; issue. We're not waiting for further research teams to descend on Antarctica
&gt; and drill holes. We know enough to convince us that action needs to be
&gt; taken. But neither should we wait for those who seek to advance a specific
&gt; political ideology, to articulate the necessary action for us. No, we should
&gt; all take responsibility ourselves and both take action regarding our own
&gt; lifestyle, as well as regarding our logic. Because the answer as to what
&gt; should be done is so simple and straightforward. The best way to
&gt; decrease emissions of carbon dioxide is to tax fossil fuel and use the
&gt; proceeds to subsidize local supply of clean and renewable energy, which
&gt; will make the policy doubly effective. Similarly, the best way to
&gt; decrease emissions of methane is to tax what's responsible for that, e.g.
&gt; by introducing a tax on the sale of meat. Again, to make such a policy
&gt; doubly effective, the proceeds should be used to subsidize local supply of
&gt; alternative food, e.g. in vegetarian restaurants.

&gt; These are only two out of my ten recommendations to deal with global
&gt; warming, but it goes to show that epistemology can reach conclusions that
&gt; are to some extent beyond science and also beyond politics, establishing
&gt; epistemology as an area of immense importance on its own. The importance
&gt; of global warming in epistemological discussions is that it so clearly
&gt; shows what happens when epistemology is neglected in society. Indeed, it is
&gt; precisely because epistemology is so ignored in society that we're in such
&gt; big problems with climate change. As discussed, scientists will be
&gt; inclined to stay away from the task of articulating what action should be
&gt; taken, while we cannot trust politicians to come up with effective policies
&gt; either - global warming is an issue demonstrating that both capitalism and
&gt; socialism are dead. It's up to epistemologists to articulate the action plan
&gt; and it's up to society to listen to epistemologists (for a change). Will
&gt; society do so? How would people know whether I am right on this? Well, this
&gt; is precisely the kind of &quot;knowledge&quot; that epistemology should focus on. Of
&gt; course I am right, because the reality of global warming urges us all to
&gt; figure things out and anyone who thinks matters through will feel that both
&gt; scientists and politicians have let us down and that what I say makes sense.

Problem : the IPCC is a political body paid to demonstrate the human
impact on climate change. They are not paid to find the truth. They
have sacked dissenting scientists. They were set up by Margaret Thatcher
who wished to smash the miners and promote nuclear power.

Jan :
OK Chaz, suppose you are right. Do you think that Margaret still plays any
significant role in the IPCC now ? I do not believe that. Maybe we should
take change into account here ...

They have overlooked the lack of basic science concerning the link
between CO2 and GW. There is no science to support the link. They have
ignored the ice-core evidence which suggests that CO2 is in indicator
of warming but cant be the cause.

Jan :
Then what 'is' the real cause for you ? Simply 'natural fluctuations over
long periods of time' ? Is that all what those billions of scientific data
were produced for ? I do not believe that. We produced and still produce
massive amounts of CO2 in a very 'unnatural', or better 'disharmonic' way
you will agree. Can natural harmony be the result ? That would be very
extreme a thought I might say. But apart from that, surely in the middle of
summer when there is no wind, you smell that incredible stench too, when you
walk on the street, very relaxed and happy, and hundreds of cars pass by.
For me this stench is deadly poison for any wanderer, especially children.
Do you believe by saying that CO2 is no cause for GW, stupidly but surely
resulting in the approval that cars and their emitting stench are no problem
at all, will change anything for the good ? Sorry, no deal. For me it is
even okay if they lie about CO2 - they will lie anyway, they always do. As
long as we can get rid of that poisonous stench on the roads and in our
houses at night as a result, they can lie as much as they want for me.
Whether it's with or without those CO2 lies, as long as those poisonous
emissions will be banned forever, things are alright for me to begin with.
The rest we will deal with later, because the wars we fight over CO2 might
produce more stench then we want.

Chaz:
There are many stories with different conclusions. Take a look at &quot;CO2
Science&quot; website. The other story that DOES explain why CO2 level FOLLOW
global temperature changes relates to the oceans' ability to absorb CO2.
Ocean temperatures lag behind GW and emit CO2 when warmer.

Jan:
OK, and we have to add variations in sunlight reflection too, due to rising
moist (of rising evaporation, and changing polluting particles) in the air.
Very complicated ! Isn't it much, much simpler to stay as close as we can to
nature's thousands of interwoven, natural and rather moderate balances, by
getting rid of the thousands of extremes man carelessly introduced in
nature, causing him to get sick and die ? We know all those extremes very
well (the extinction of thousands of animal and plant species are a good
example), so why don't we do something about them ? Money ? Greed ?

No one can explain how an increase in CO2 of 0.01% can affect

is mixing everything up. We have boiled One Big Poisonous Soup of Lies. If
we continue to boil this Stinking Soup a bit longer, I think the

on earth are we to trust any more ? Sorry, but now I only trust my nose and
my lungs. That I can be most sure of.
No more data.

I am willing to accept any changes in energy use that result in less
pollution and more conservation. The GW issue is used for that
reason. But the reality is that alternative sources of energy are now
being sought because oil is expensive and this makes the new sources
competitive. But I think we are making a serious mistake if we will
wrongly attribute the correct causes of global warming. From 1940 to
1970 we witnessed Global cooling despite a massive increase in CO2
use. The effect was so great that climate scientists were warning us
about the next ice-age.  Now temperatures have returned to their 1940s
level, CO2 it seems has played no role in this. If global temperatures
should start to decline again : what are we going to tell the
public ? What faith should the populace have in science if we are
talking a load of bollocks ?

Jan:
True. But what fate should scientist have in the public when it mixes all
their data up amongst themselves, following their favourite politician with

gathering those data ? That is a two way street !

This is simply not true. I would like you to offer a single piece of
supporting evidence.

Marx is misunderstood. He stands in as a pinata for any august body
which the right wing wish to bash. For example, when The Lancet,
commisioned a study to assess to death toll in Iraq, it was accused by
the US press of being a communist rag full of Marxists. This came as
rather a silly joke to the British community who know the The Lancet
to be one of the most highly respected medical journals on earth.
Marx is misunderstood as the inspiration for Stalin who instigated one
of the most cruel regimes in history. What people don't understand is
that Marx was primarily an economist who laid down the basis for  the
two main economist movements of the twentieth century : Keynesianism
and Monetarism and would have been horrified to learn what became of
communism under Stalin.

SO you not only demonstarte your ignorance of Marx but also of the
IPCC.

&gt; &gt; scientists is unwarrented, given the illusive nature of objectivity and the
&gt; &gt; money and trust that society has vested in them. Moreover, as I have been
&gt; &gt; pointing out for a long time, some conclusions go beyond both science and
&gt; &gt; politics. Scientists are habitually ducking their responsibility when
&gt; &gt; referring the task of articulating action to politicians. Scientists should
&gt; &gt; not refer such a task to politicians, since some things should not be left
&gt; &gt; to politicians to decide. We all have a duty to speak out when something is
&gt; &gt; wrong. If we handed the task of dealing with global warming to right-wing
&gt; &gt; politicians, they would propose buying off those who wanted action,
&gt; &gt; resulting in no effective action at all. If we handed the task to left-wing
&gt; &gt; politicians, they would increase taxes and use the proceeds partly to
&gt; &gt; increase an inefficient government bureaucracy, in which case nothing
&gt; &gt; effective would be achieved either. As long as no there's no alternative
&gt; &gt; available, the rich will continue with polluting activities (because they
&gt; &gt; can afford to do so), while the poor have no alterbnatives either, so they
&gt; &gt; will be given the other part of the tax proceeds with the argument that they
&gt; &gt; needed help with the increased cost of energy and food, which will only lead
&gt; &gt; to them to continue with or take up further polluting activities.

&gt; &gt; It is up to good epistemology to point out that this isn't a scientific
&gt; &gt; issue. We're not waiting for further research teams to descend on Antarctica
&gt; &gt; and drill holes. We know enough to convince us that action needs to be
&gt; &gt; taken. But neither should we wait for those who seek to advance a specific
&gt; &gt; political ideology, to articulate the necessary action for us. No, we should
&gt; &gt; all take responsibility ourselves and both take action regarding our own
&gt; &gt; lifestyle, as well as regarding our logic. Because the answer as to what
&gt; &gt; should be done is so simple and straightforward. The best way to
&gt; &gt; decrease emissions of carbon dioxide is to tax fossil fuel and use the
&gt; &gt; proceeds to subsidize local supply of clean and renewable energy, which
&gt; &gt; will make the policy doubly effective. Similarly, the best way to
&gt; &gt; decrease emissions of methane is to tax what's responsible for that, e.g.
&gt; &gt; by introducing a tax on the sale of meat. Again, to make such a policy
&gt; &gt; doubly effective, the proceeds should be used to subsidize local supply of
&gt; &gt; alternative food, e.g. in vegetarian restaurants.

&gt; &gt; These are only two out of my ten recommendations to deal with global
&gt; &gt; warming, but it goes to show that epistemology can reach conclusions that
&gt; &gt; are to some extent beyond science and also beyond politics, establishing
&gt; &gt; epistemology as an area of immense importance on its own. The importance
&gt; &gt; of global warming in epistemological discussions is that it so clearly
&gt; &gt; shows what happens when epistemology is neglected in society. Indeed, it is
&gt; &gt; precisely because epistemology is so ignored in society that we're in such
&gt; &gt; big problems with climate change. As discussed, scientists will be
&gt; &gt; inclined to stay away from the task of articulating what action should be
&gt; &gt; taken, while we cannot trust politicians to come up with effective policies
&gt; &gt; either - global warming is an issue demonstrating that both capitalism and
&gt; &gt; socialism are dead. It's up to epistemologists to articulate the action plan
&gt; &gt; and it's up to society to listen to epistemologists (for a change). Will
&gt; &gt; society do so? How would people know whether I am right on this? Well, this
&gt; &gt; is precisely the kind of &quot;knowledge&quot; that epistemology should focus on. Of
&gt; &gt; course I am right, because the reality of global warming urges us all to
&gt; &gt; figure things out and anyone who thinks matters through will feel that both
&gt; &gt; scientists and politicians have let us down and that what I say makes sense.

Margaret Thatcher's only mistake in her long career was promoting the false
belief that man has a role in climate change.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the attempt at an answer but I'm not sure one word of this
&gt; &gt; &gt; is relevant.
&gt; &gt; &gt; May I remind you that I have never denied that GW is a fact. Nor have
&gt; &gt; &gt; I denied that it may well be a problem for many humans. I just feel
&gt; &gt; &gt; that when one considers the long duration of the earth's climate, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; minor changes in temperature over the last 30 years are not very
&gt; &gt; &gt; significant.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It still seems to me that the basic science which would link CO2 to GW
&gt; &gt; &gt; has not been done and that the possibility that such small increases
&gt; &gt; &gt; in CO2 could cause ANY temperature change are remote to say the least.
&gt; &gt; &gt; When we learn that the &quot;evidence&quot; linking CO2 to GW actually suggests
&gt; &gt; &gt; that CO2 is an indicator of GW and clearly not the cause of it, I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; forced to wonder at the political uses to which &quot;science&quot; has been put
&gt; &gt; &gt; in this field.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I rather think Feynman would call the CO2 debate &quot;cargo cult&quot; science.

&gt; &gt; The conclusion of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50
&gt; &gt; years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; not due to known natural causes alone :
&gt; &gt; http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/wg1/Report/AR4WG1_Pub_SPM-v2.pdf (page 10)

&gt; Chaz:
&gt; Problem : the IPCC is a political body paid to demonstrate the human
&gt; impact on climate change. They are not paid to find the truth. They
&gt; have sacked dissenting scientists. They were set up by Margaret Thatcher
&gt; who wished to smash the miners and promote nuclear power.

&gt; Jan :
&gt; OK Chaz, suppose you are right. Do you think that Margaret still plays any
&gt; significant role in the IPCC now ? I do not believe that. Maybe we should
&gt; take change into account here ...

&gt; &gt; I don't think the IPCC has overlooked much, it has been around for about
&gt; two
&gt; &gt; decades now, without finding anything of substance that would lead to a
&gt; &gt; different conclusion. There are plenty of others that have looked at
&gt; &gt; alternative views, only to conclude that it didn't add up, e.g. have a
&gt; look
&gt; &gt; at: http://environment.newscientist.com/climatemyths

&gt; Chaz:
&gt; They have overlooked the lack of basic science concerning the link
&gt; between CO2 and GW. There is no science to support the link. They have
&gt; ignored the ice-core evidence which suggests that CO2 is in indicator
&gt; of warming but cant be the cause.

&gt; Jan :
&gt; Then what 'is' the real cause for you ? Simply 'natural fluctuations over
&gt; long periods of time' ? Is that all what those billions of scientific data
&gt; were produced for ? I do not believe that. We produced and still produce
&gt; massive amounts of CO2 in a very 'unnatural', or better 'disharmonic' way
&gt; you will agree. Can natural harmony be the result ? That would be very
&gt; extreme a thought I might say. But apart from that, surely in the middle
&gt; of
&gt; summer when there is no wind, you smell that incredible stench too, when
&gt; you
&gt; walk on the street, very relaxed and happy, and hundreds of cars pass by.
&gt; For me this stench is deadly poison for any wanderer, especially children.
&gt; Do you believe by saying that CO2 is no cause for GW, stupidly but surely
&gt; resulting in the approval that cars and their emitting stench are no
&gt; problem
&gt; at all, will change anything for the good ? Sorry, no deal. For me it is
&gt; even okay if they lie about CO2 - they will lie anyway, they always do. As
&gt; long as we can get rid of that poisonous stench on the roads and in our
&gt; houses at night as a result, they can lie as much as they want for me.
&gt; Whether it's with or without those CO2 lies, as long as those poisonous
&gt; emissions will be banned forever, things are alright for me to begin with.
&gt; The rest we will deal with later, because the wars we fight over CO2 might
&gt; produce more stench then we want.

&gt; &gt; If anyone could come up with a story that pointed to a different
&gt; conclusion,
&gt; &gt; that would be very spectacular indeed and it would make this person
&gt; &gt; instantly rich just by selling such a story to the many media anxious to
&gt; &gt; come up with something new on the topic of global warming.

&gt; Chaz:
&gt; There are many stories with different conclusions. Take a look at &quot;CO2
&gt; Science&quot; website. The other story that DOES explain why CO2 level FOLLOW
&gt; global temperature changes relates to the oceans' ability to absorb CO2.
&gt; Ocean temperatures lag behind GW and emit CO2 when warmer.

&gt; Jan:
&gt; OK, and we have to add variations in sunlight reflection too, due to
&gt; rising
&gt; moist (of rising evaporation, and changing polluting particles) in the
&gt; air.
&gt; Very complicated ! Isn't it much, much simpler to stay as close as we can
&gt; to
&gt; nature's thousands of interwoven, natural and rather moderate balances, by
&gt; getting rid of the thousands of extremes man carelessly introduced in
&gt; nature, causing him to get sick and die ? We know all those extremes very
&gt; well (the extinction of thousands of animal and plant species are a good
&gt; example), so why don't we do something about them ? Money ? Greed ?
&gt; Life-time power-trips on medicines ? Ah, people are so stupid.

&gt; &gt; So, you don't need to be afraid that basic scientific (as well as other)
&gt; research
&gt; &gt; won't continue on global warming for many years.
&gt; &gt; If something new would come up
&gt; &gt; that would lead to a different conclusion, then there's no reason to
&gt; believe
&gt; &gt; that this wouldn't get the attention it deserved.

&gt; Chaz:
&gt; No one can explain how an increase in CO2 of 0.01% can affect
&gt; temperature. This is a serious problem to those who suggest CO2 as a
&gt; greenhouse gas.

&gt; Jan:
&gt; I don't trust ANY of those scientific data any more. How could I ?
&gt; Everyone
&gt; is mixing everything up. We have boiled One Big Poisonous Soup of Lies. If
&gt; we continue to boil this Stinking Soup a bit longer, I think the
&gt; CO2-emissions of that Poison Soup itself will cause GW in the future ! Who
&gt; on earth are we to trust any more ? Sorry, but now I only trust my nose
&gt; and
&gt; my lungs. That I can be most sure of.
&gt; No more data.

&gt; &gt; But given the urgency of the problem that global warming poses, there's
&gt; no
&gt; &gt; point in waiting for further diagnosis and there's no reason to postpone
&gt; &gt; taking adequate action. Scientists typically refuse to work on
&gt; articulating
&gt; &gt; such action, under the pretence that there was a line between politics
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; science that scientists couldn't cross without compromising some assumed
&gt; &gt; objectivity. Scientists will prefer to duck their responsibility and
&gt; focus
&gt; &gt; on further research, which is also typically the only way for them to
&gt; make
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; living.

&gt; &gt; Modern epistemologists will point out that this latter attitude by
&gt; &gt; scientists is unwarranted, given the illusive nature of objectivity and

&gt; &gt; needed help with the increased cost of energy and food, which will only
&gt; lead
&gt; &gt; to them to continue with or take up further polluting activities.

&gt; Chaz:
&gt; I am willing to accept any changes in energy use that result in less
&gt; pollution and more conservation. The GW issue is used for that
&gt; reason. But the reality is that alternative sources of energy are now
&gt; being sought because oil is expensive and this makes the new sources
&gt; competitive. But I think we are making a serious mistake if we will
&gt; wrongly attribute the correct causes of global warming. From 1940 to
&gt; 1970 we witnessed Global cooling despite a massive increase in CO2
&gt; use. The effect was so great that climate scientists were warning us
&gt; about the next ice-age.  Now temperatures have returned to their 1940s
&gt; level, CO2 it seems has played no role in this. If global temperatures
&gt; should start to decline again : what are we going to tell the
&gt; public ? What faith should the populace have in science if we are
&gt; talking a load of bollocks ?

&gt; Jan:
&gt; True. But what fate should scientist have in the public when it mixes all
&gt; their data up amongst themselves, following their favourite politician
&gt; with
&gt; smelly breath, and cook them into a stinking soup ? Will they still
&gt; continue
&gt; gathering those data ? That is a two way street !

&gt; &gt; It is up to good epistemology to point out that this isn't a scientific
&gt; &gt; issue. We're not

Global warming is just one of the issues showing that capitalism is
inappropriate in our modern society. Instead of who owns what, it's more
important to look at who does what. That should be reflected in the ways
society is regulated. Socialism long understood this, but it doesn't offer a
credible position in regard to global warming.

You don't seem to have anything credible to offer either. Persistently
promoting myths will definitely not give you credibility, neither from
scientific nor from epistemological perspectives. It just shows that there
are people who seek out forums like this one in an effort to spread myths.

Hello George,

Thank you for this elaborate and well thought through comment. On the one
hand I agree with you completely that we have to be careful not stop
thinking and act in panic, and that an individual or a small group of
people, at first glance I might add, have little to no effect on the
incredibly vast phenomenon we call 'earths climate', even if we consider the
relatively huge amounts they can pollute and destroy in nature in their
lifetime. For sadly some of them do, and I am not even sure if I am not one
of them. Even with the so called &quot;Butterfly Effect&quot;, we can only guess which
individual butterfly causes the opposite effect of any other, hence
annihilating any so called 'gigantic effect' immediately in the process.

Referring to my recent post entitled &quot;Important and unimportant&quot; though, I
fail to see how we may have to put a possibly unimportant, little old lady
called Margaret Thatcher on the driver seat of an imaginary bandwagon, that
would drive us all into a pit, fattening anything or anyone in the process.
The rather dark side of my mind that I only come to realise and fear a bit
recently, would cause me to imagine a very lonely Margaret Thatcher in a
wheelchair for that, asking somebody the road back home because she got lost
in the rain.

I completely agree that GW is the issue today we should all focus on to the
maximum of our abilities, and that it concerns such vast and complex domains
as many different sciences, sociology, economy and politics indeed. You
undoubtedly recognise immediately again who is writing here when I say we
may need to add many more, very important domains of our existence to that
subject as well, like psychology e.g., religion, spirituality, all the arts
and philosophy - epistemology none the least -, not to lose sight of the
complete picture. It may seem far fetched for you at first for example, if I
say the issue of GW may be completely misunderstood if we would forget about
music. With thanks to my friend Enrico Romeo though, who wrote me a poem
about it recently - it was that same friend I spoke to Chazwin about
recently -, if all music were to stop immediately all over the world, I'm
sure the deafening silence would turn our focus to music again immediately,
hopefully remembering it's connection to GW again after we turned it back
on.
The same applies to any other domain we forgot IMO, when it would suddenly
disappear. &quot;Important and unimportant.&quot;

I have some questions about the fine example of the bicyclist that pushed
his peddle and went over the edge. If this bicyclist were to be a desperate
scientist, pushing his bike over a cliff to commit suicide, because he knew
very well that his data about GW pointed out man already passed the point of
no return with his destruction, and nobody wanted to listen to what he had
to say about that, I'm afraid we would all be responsible for his death. How
easy do we forget that many people put their life on the line to gather
crucial scientific data, only for their data and their life to get lost in
unimportant discussion about alleged political scams. Or scientific scams.
Or other. The same applies to all those other people that commit suicide day
by day all for very different reasons over the world, because their lives
would get lost in those same discussions as well. The psychological domain ?

Is it a matter of dividing our attention to as many people we personally
know as we can, and still can get to know, to prevent such loss ? Is it a
matter of balancing our focus on GW with our focus on all the other very
important issues there are on our planet, personal, local, national and
global - of which some we do not even know -, to prevent such loss ? This is
a very hard question for me to answer at this moment. Is it an important one
as well ?

I want to say more George, but for now I have to go.
Thank you very much for your fine post, and see you later.

Cheers friend!

&gt; But given the urgency of the problem that global warming poses,
&gt; there's no point in waiting for further diagnosis and there's no

===================================================
There is an option, reserved for panic stricken bandwagon sheep: Under the
device &quot;URGENCY&quot; lose no time for thinking and jump into such pit as your
driver chooses, without forgetting to fatten on the way the mafias of his
penchant.

After this Epilogue instead of Prologue let's go to the tahles.
==================================================

Global Warming (GW) is doubtless one of the most important, critical
problems  mankind is facing.
It concerns science, sociology, economy and politics.
Unfortunately, it became entirely confined in politics which discovered its
panic generating quality. Now, panic is the strongest lever in political
campaigns, driving bandwagon sheep to jump like one yahoo into such
precipices as may please the driver.

The discovery of GW as panic generating political lever has to be ascribed
to Margaret Thatcher who did not care a button about climate, but searched a
ruse to suppress the revolt of callously exploited coal miners. Using it
slickly and astutely in her wake, some Obama or Clinton may be elected. With
what impact on the GW and its sequels?
Rigorously, NONE.
They don't care a damn about it, else than as the political lever and even
if they cared, they could not do anything.

Let's try to examine the problem coolly and logically.

GW has two kinds of causes: human and natural, the latter earth bound and
cosmic.
Starting with natural, we observe that GW happened several times in history
as one of two phases of a more general cyclic structure GW/GF (Global
Freezing).
As it's easier to explicate separately GW and GF, we shall start by it
before moving to their more complex cyclic reversion and succession.
Historic cycles had clearly natural causes, most of which are unexplained if
not unknown. One, however, is rigorously, albeit only qualitatively known:
melting and re-freezing of glaciers and other ice caps. We shall use it as a
typical example of natural causes at work.

Earth surface encompasses white ice areas reflecting heat radiated by the
sun and other dark ones absorbing it. In a steady state of ice/not-ice
distribution and constant amount of radiated heat, the absorption to
reflection ratio stays constant and the climate does not change. Yet, the
smallest distortion may change this equilibrium.

Let's suppose that one year the sun emits more heat and then returns to the
constant yearly amount.
The triggering change warms up the earth more than usually, so that more ice
melts. Then, next year less heat is reflected and more absorbed, so that
still more ice melts and we enter the recursive chain of the GW phase.
Nothing seems to stay in the way of earth losing all its ice caps and
becoming a Sahara interspaced with hot seas. Yet, each GW was followed by a
GF, in turn by a GW, etc.

Which natural mechanism may reverse GW into GF and vice versa?

There must be several, both earth bound and cosmic and mostly unknown, but
for our ice driven cycle the answer is clear: the salt.

Oceans are salted and salt waters freeze at lower temperature than the
sweet. Snows and ice melting copiously during the GW, flood oceans with
sweet water decreasing their salinity and increasing their freezing
temperature, so that over a threshold they start to freeze again over larger
surfaces and the phase moves to GF and towards a new glacial period.

Pseudo-scientific committees commanded by politicians, proclaimed that GW is
caused with 80% certainty by human actions, and reversible by their
reversal.

Double lie:

1.&quot;Caused&quot; should be replaced with &quot;triggered&quot;. It's possible that
greenhouse triggered GW, as any tiny distortion could disarrange the fragile
unstable equilibrium. However, once triggered and entered in the ice melting
phase, GW is CAUSED by ice melting.
Similarly, a tour of pedals may push a bike over the summit and TRIGGER its
descent whose CAUSE, however, is gravity, a natural agent.

2.Supposing that Greenhouse indeed triggered the GW, its triggering effect
loses all avail upon entering the ice melting phase, which thrives by its
own recursion and certainly cannot be &quot;un-triggered&quot; by decreasing of
emissions nor even by their hypothetical total suspension. The pedals might
have triggered the descent, but you may turn them backwards on your
freewheel bike till you are blue in the face. Gravity will not notice it and
the descent will continue undisturbed, just like the GW, unaffected by Kyoto
Protocols, by green presidential campaigns and by the anti-American
propaganda. Until the bike has passed the valley and, always by natural
causes, starts climbing the opposite slope, or the GW phase switches, always
by natural causes, to the GF phase.

Which actions seem advisable in this light?

1.Dissociate GW from Pollution, admit that it is inevitable and start
immediately to plan actions aiming at saving millions endangered by
inundations, (expatriation, artificial islands, etc.) and other sequels of
the GW.

2.In order to concretize and to finance these actions, stop subsidizing
fraudulent and useless phantasms such as intermittent energy sources
(photo-voltaic and mainly the wind mafia steeling heavy billions from the
tax payers and sharing them with corrupted
politicians.)
Allegorically speaking, stop flagellating the see with chains, in the wake
of Xerxes, while fattening chain manufacturers.

Dissociate pollution from GW. Pollution is a critical problem in itself and
should be treated as such, but separately from GW. And if we want to discuss
it, we

Thanks for nice post, but I don't understand why write
long stories.

I said shortly that IMO the only possible and
necessary
action is:

Admit that GW is inevitable and start immediately
to plan actions aiming at saving millions endangered
by inundations, (expatriation, artificial islands,
etc.) and other sequels of the GW.

Do you agree, yes, no?

If yes, why write long romances, just say &quot;yes&quot;.

If not, say clearly and exactly, why and what you
propose instead.

Then I suggested to dissociate pollution from GW.
Pollution is a critical problem in itself and should
be treated as such, but separately from GW. Mixing
them muddles both beyond understanding, let alone
solving.

Georges.

I propose information has no mass, so compression does not apply to it
Instead compression does comprise matter.
You said it sharply, information is a &quot;concrete proterty of matter&quot;,
although matter itself is secondary to information.
Matter is the pointer, information is the address. So whatever matterI
use to represent that address will be enough for information purposes.

In other words, if I say information is for instance, number 512.
It does not matter what I use to represent that concept, can be
decimal, binary, hex, in a base of 4, 5, 6...  a drawing, a word,
whatever.

It is true I need matter to point, to sustain information, although
information is clearly not such matter

Let me also answer your questions, George. To start with your last point,
George, do greenhouse gases constitute pollution? This is not so much a
scientific question, but it's a question of liability and requirement for
government to act. There has been a huge courtcase on that question and the
US Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that greenhouse gases did indeed
constitute pollution.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_v._Environmental_Protectio...
This ruling confirmed the need for the US government to act on global
warming.

What can and should be done to deal with GW? GW is in many respects
inevitable, in the sense that whatever we do or may not do, temperatures
around the globe are set to rise. There is little or no question about
that. The question is what can and should be done to mitigate and compensate
for the harm inflicted by GW. Firstly, we need to look at what are the
dangers of global warming. Flooding is indeed the first concern, but are
there further concerns? I responded to this question by articulating the
Ten Dangers of Global Warming:

*1. Flooding.

*We've all seen the pictures of disappearing glaciers and the predictions of
rising sea levels. Most people live close to the sea, but many are in denial
about the impact of global warming. They falsely believe that the only
change that will affect them will be a few centimeter rise of sea level over
many decades. Without government action to move them away into newly-built
cities, they will continue to live on land most prone to flooding and most
exposed to hurricanes, tornadoes and thunderstorms, until a disaster hits
them like we've seen happen in New Orleans. The task ahead is many scales
larger than the evacuation of New Orleans, which after all occurred in the
richest nation on earth while all other infrastructure in the US was in good
working order. Ironically, global warming comes with increased risks not
only of flooding, but also of shortage of water.

*2. Shortage of water.*

Many areas could be hit by droughts, especially once glaciers that
previously fed rivers have disappeared. As the weather becomes more
turbulent, we can expect more extreme droughts, while the occasional heavy
storm wouldn't give much relief, but instead cause landslides and run-off of
top-soil. Shortage of potable water causes dehydration in people and
livestock, making them more vulnerable to diseases. Lack of irrigation
results in loss of stock and crop in many areas. As people and animals move
to more fertile grounds, overgrazing of land and clearing land of trees
could cause desertification there as well. All this, combined with the
increased risk of flooding should increase concerns for famine and disease.

*3. Famine and disease.*

Higher temperatures will increase the risk of tropical diseases, such as
malaria, in previously temperate zones. Starvation is one of the biggest
unconscious human fears that may well become a reality that is daily
displayed on TV. The most fertile land is typically located just above sea
level, where rivers enter the sea. Due to climate change, many areas will
need to switch to other crops. This will take time, further contributing to
transitionary if not permanent shortages of food everywhere. Food storage
and distribution will be hit by rising cost of cooling, while stored food
will become exposed to pests and diseases in the face of increased humidity
and in the absence of adequate refridgeration. Cost of transport will rise,
while many roads may become inaccessable due to flooding and storm damage.

*4. Migration and refugees.*

Migration will stress the infrastructure of many cities, even if they
weren't affected much directly by climate change in terms of famine,
droughts, epidemics, flooding or storm damage. Apart from this, people will
also be driven away from many areas by pollution, heat, pests, diseases,
shortages of water and supplies, and collapse of infrastructure, medical
care and security. Many people will seek new habitats, while at the same
time many countries will seek to stop refugees from crossing borders.
Refugee camps are notorious for the outbreak of epidemics, such as cholera.
Without proper planning and action, this could result in human tragedy at
unprecedented scale, while refugee camps could become breeding grounds for
new diseases like avian influenza.

*5. Collapse of the financial system.*

The value of money used to be linked to gold, but now is based on economic
growth, value of real estate and the value of stock (company shares) and the
like. As such factors become increasingly exposed to the the above points,
the entire global financial system risks collapse. Instead, a carbon-based
system of currency may take over to some extent. Uncertainty about this
increases the risk that governments will simply become more dictatorial. In
the absence of market forces to guide developments, there will be increased
risks that such dictatorial governments take actions that make things worse,
resulting in total economic collapse.

*6. Economic collapse.*

Many countries face uncertain futures, as they are dependent on income from
oil, coal, tourism or a single crop that cannot survive climate change. As
an example, air travel could become too expense for tourists, taking away
the single biggest revenue stream for many small countries. Entire
industries, such as manufacturing of cars and airplanes, may collapse.
Globalisation has made many industries dependent on access to resources and
products that come from halfway around the world, while the cost of
transport is likely to go up. Again, such economic collapse may set the
scene for dictatorship in many areas, increasing the risk of war and of
wrong decisions being taken in general.

*7. War and civil unrest.*

The above points should increase our concerns about the risk of wars and
civil unrest. Production of weapons is one of the biggest industries
worldwide, with the clout to influence governments. The oil industry is
often regarded as the most powerful influence of global politics. Some
countries will want quick and dramatic changes, while other countries may
resist all calls for change or may want entirely different changes, setting
up confrontation at a global scale and setting the scene for World War III.
Within most countries, there will also be opposing groups. The smartest
people, who we now need more than ever, may be killed, may end up in prison
or may otherwise be silenced, while dictators seek to grab power without any
intention of solving the problems.

*8. Pollution, in particular as a result of nuclear war, fallout and waste.*

As concerns about emissions of carbon and methane increase, industry may
seek to abandon pollution standards in order to avoid emission of greenhouse
gasses. The nuclear industry may present itself as a &quot;green&quot; alternative,
but nuclear fallout and waste should count as one of the biggest dangers in
this regard. As concerns about carbon emissions sink in, more countries are
considering using nuclear power for electricity, which comes with increased
risk of fallout and concerns about the care of and disposal of nuclear
waste. Furthermore, many countries are seeking to develop nuclear weapons in
response to increased risk of war in the light of the above points. The
secrecy under which such development takes place gives cause to concern
about global safety and security.

*9. Tipping points.*

One of the biggest dangers is that, without dramatic action, the atmosphere
will reach certain tipping points beyond which sudden dramatic and
catastrophic changes take place that are irreversable in the short term.
Droughts and more turbulent wheather may cause earthquakes and associated
tsunamis, which not only come with loss of lives, infrastructure and fertile
land, but which will also make the greenhouse effect worse. So, instead of
facing gradual changes that can be mitigated by planned action, we may
suddenly face a future in which many if not most people will have little or
no access to food, water, medicines, electricity and shelter, while diseases
go rampant and gangs and warlords loot and devastate the few liveable areas
left. Human beings as a species will face the risk of total extinction,
particularly if many species of animals and plants that humans depend on
will disappear.

*10. Panic.*

While each of the above points gives reason to be concerned, many people are
still in denial about the severity of the problem of global warmimg. Once
they do get the message, though, there's a risk of over-reaction edging into
panic. This may result in people buying up all the food they can get hold
of, trying to get their hands on weapons, etc. Unscrupulous companies may
exploit the situation by deliberately creating scarcity of medicines, etc.
This is another reason to be open about these concerns and to come up with
planning that makes sense.

Yes, George, I articulated Ten Dangers and in the earlier thread you quite
rightly referred to I also articulated Ten Recommendations to deal with GW.
This was indeed deliberately done, not to take a devine position and make
commandments, but in response to the way the US Senate Committee on
Environment at that time dealt with GW, which was by articulating a list
of Top Ten Actions (indeed, almost evangelical commandments) urging people
to be more energy efficient.
http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Majority.GlobalWarming
While these are all worthwhile points, it shouldn't be used to make it look
as if the Senate was actively doing something. Government may urge people to
take certain actions in emergency situations and this will often work well,
but if the emergency turns out to stretch out for decades without ending in
one's lifetime, then one cannot expect such calls to save energy be
effective in the long term. Instead, as I argued, the Senate should focus
on looking at legislation that will work. Congress has meanwhile passed laws
that seek to
