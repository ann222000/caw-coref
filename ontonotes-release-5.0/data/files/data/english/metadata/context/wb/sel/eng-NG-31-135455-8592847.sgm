Disable gnome-power-manager?

Am I the only one who finds the gnome-power-manager to be
fundamentally flawed?  A power daemon needs intrinsically to be
system-global and not specific to a particular login session.
This becomes obvious when there are several logins active at the same time
(on different virtual consoles), typically with different users.

Now, recent versions of the gnome-desktop-environment depend on
gnome-power-management, so it makes it inconvenient to deinstall the
gnome-power-management package.  Is there a way to keep it installed but to
deactivate it?

I don’t have it installed, but maybe
/etc/dbus-1/system.d/gnome-power-manager.conf is of help. It suggest that
gnome-power-manager is launched through DBUS, so you should be able to disable
it that way.

Apparently, it is not. But README.Debian.gz is:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; GNOME Users: Starting GNOME Power Manager with your GNOME Session
&gt; =================================================================

&gt; 1) Add yourself to the powerdev group; this group is created by hal
&gt;    &gt;= 0.5.6+cvs20060219-1.
&gt; 2) Open System -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Sessions
&gt; 3) In the Startup Programs tab, click Add
&gt; 4) Type &quot;gnome-power-manager&quot;, click OK.
&gt; 5) Log out of your gnome session, and log back in again.
">

You obviously can do the opposite to disable it.

When I install gnome I don't install gnome-desktop-environment. I enter that
in aptitude and pick the items I want from there. gnome-power-management is
recommended by gnome-screen-saver so when I install that I temporarily
disable aptitude from automatically installing recommended packages.

Maybe the long way around but it gets me where I want to be.. :)
