my 1989 pickup has a crapped out master cylinder.  it will be fixed
soon.  another problem has come up and i wonder if the two are
connected.  after changing both brake bulbs and checking for obvious
wiring breaks (none), i'm wondering if a connection between the master
cylinder and the break lights exist.

Yes. The connection is the brake pedal.

The pedal operates the master cylinder, and activates a switch.

so, are you saying the switch is in the master cylinder?  i.e.
replacing the master cylinder will solve the brake light problem. or
is the switch a separate part that must be replaced, in addition to
the m.c.

The brakelight switch is a mechanical switch that hits the pedal arm
to turn OFF - if the pedal arm isn't returning to it's full release
stop the brake lights stay on.  Might just need adjusting.

If it's the Brake Warning light on the dashboard you're talking
about, that is tripped by a hydraulic brake failure switch on the
firewall, and usually means that one half of the brakes have totally
crapped out - if that's you, STOP DRIVING THE CAR till it's fixed.

If the half that still works (usually the front) fails you have NO
brakes.  The back brakes can fail without a big difference in stopping
distance, because the fronts do most of the work - when the fronts are
out, you'll know.

there is no brake light on the dash that is on.  in addition, the
brake lights aren't staying on, they are permanently off.  firstly, is
the brakelight switch within the mastercylinder, on the floor of the
cab, where? perhaps, behind the brake booster.  what i need to know
is, is the failed master cylinder effecting the brakelight switch
because the m.c. no longer holds pressure. or in other words does
pressure in the m.c. control the operation of the brakelights?  my
intention is to find the culprit and if i need to buy a master
cylinder and a booster, the replacement cost is less if both are
purchased as a pair.  but, since i'm working on a limited budget, i'd
prefer to only replace the m.c. if it will fix the problem.  any
suggestions would be appreciated. thanks.

Okay, that narrows it down some...

The only kind of brake light switch that would be on the Master
Cylinder itself would be a hydraulic pressure activated style switch,
and those have long gone out of style - when they fail it's usually a
diaphragm crack or rupture, they tend to start leaking brake fluid,
and when you run out of brake fluid you lose the brakes.  And of
course, this is very bad.

The last hydraulic brake light switch I messed with was on my 1962
International Scout (Girling brake system IIRC), and I think the
original few decades of Volkswagen Beetles had them...

And even then, they were not "built into" the MC.  They are a
separate part that looked like an oil pressure switch sender, screwed
into either a port on the MC, or a tee fitting on the hydraulic lines.

If the brakes operate properly and stop the car normally it probably
is NOT a problem with the MC - what makes you think that it is?

Open the drivers door and stick your head up under the dash with a
flashlight.  The brake light switch will most likely be at the top of
the brake pedal arm - look for the wires.  Push the brake pedal with
your hand and look for what moves and what doesn't.

They can make really odd looking switches that snap over the pedal
arm pivot, but they all function the same - mechanical pressure moves
the contacts, and they have to be wired to the car electrical system.

They build cars slightly different for each major market region's
laws and requirements (like LHD or RHD, or a turn-signal repeater lamp
on the front fender for some European countries, or a speed warning
buzzer for Saudi Arabia) but apart from that there aren't /that/ many
changes.  Would defeat the whole purpose of Mass Production.

I didn't say that at all.

You asked if they were connected. The connection is the brake pedal.

I do not think the two malfunctions are related, I think the switch is a
failure and the MC is a failure. Having said that, you didn't tell us what
the MC failure is, and why you think you need to replace it.

The failure of the BRAKE LAMPS and the condition of the Master Cylinder are
not related. Replacing the MC will not make the brake lights work again.

If you foot goes to the floor or sinks slowly to the floor at a traffic
light (or anytime you hold your foot on the pedal to keep from rolling),
then you have a MC problem. As a temporary measure, you can sometimes pump
the brake pedal to build hydraulic pressure, but the pressure eventually
fades and you have to repeat. As the MC gets worse, your need to repeat
increases.

If you lay on the floor and look up, you should be able to find the Brake
Light Switch mounted to the side of the steering column support braces, it
has a switch actuator that is activated by movement of the brake pedal.

Have you used a helper and a volt meter to see if you even have voltage at
the brake lamps?
