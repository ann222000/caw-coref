I'm surprised they made it through the entire US tour.  They just played

half of the outdoor ampitheater.  I saw Manson a few years ago at the
Wiltern theater in LA and it was a surprisingly good show.

slayer is an original thrash/speed metal band. you either like that (in
which case you worship them) or you don't.

manson garnered media notoriety in the late 90s for his outrageous
behavior (as contrived and stages as it was) but problem was under all
the glitz he (unlike vintage alice cooper) just didn't have any good
songs, much less albums.

I've always liked his version of Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This).
Not a big Manson fan, Dope Show is also pretty good.

Longtime Manson guitarist John Lowery (aka John 5) played on Roth's
DLR Band album.
He co-wrote a lot of the songs on the album (including one of the
best, Counter-Blast).
He's currently Rob Zombie's guitarist.

Yup. There was a big deal about that here when he split.

People were saying Manson was the future and Roth's career was over.

Now it's Manson playing 1/4 filled arenas while Dave is selling out arenas

Bwahahahahaha

Another jealous idiot journalist wannabe that let his emotions write his
story and now looking like an idiot.

Too bad, Roth gets the last laugh on everyone - he's watched many rockers
come and go (like the ones I mentioned), but in the end, he's still selling
out everywhere.

Not too many artists start at the top and go out on the top, it's virtually
unheard of...

Thanks for bringing that up again, Rusty!

If it was VH with Hagar, it wouldn't come close to selling out, as

Hagar sold-out three shows that were scheduled in May (at the Tahoe
Wabo, which holds maybe 850-1000).
They were canceled due to illness (Hagar was hospitalized).
This show was hastily re-scheduled as a make-up in June and did
extremely well (despite not touring under a new album). Just a one-off
in the desert.

However, the VIP tickets ($200) sold-out for the June show.
Adding $12-15K to an already impressive $210K gross.

&gt; Meanwhile, Dave is back and they're selling out everywhere and there's not a
&gt; damn thing you can do about it.

Sure I can.  I'll stay home and skip the sheep-fest.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Tissue?

You'll need it when Dave shits all over you.  How much is he paying
you, BTW?  Or are you just a rabid fan, the Mark David Chapman of the
group?

&gt; &gt; Evidently people think seeing the reunited VH 23 years later is going
&gt; &gt; to be as good as it was then.  Boy are they in for a disappointment.

&gt; LOL

&gt; I don't think anyone in their right mind thinks that.

&gt; I don't think anyone seeing any band 23 years later is going to think that.

&gt; I do know people are buying tickets and you're not happy about it.

Makes no difference to me, it's not costing me a dime to make fun of
you sheep.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; But hey, if it makes you feel as good as it did then, feel free to
&gt; &gt; plunk down $200.  Dave and Ed appreciate it.

&gt; People are plonking down a LOT more than that.

....making it all the more pathetic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Don't even try and sell this reunion short....

I'd sell it for about $50, any more than that is screwing the fans,
something VH has done in spades since 1984.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But hey, if it makes you feel good to be miserable while we all enjoy
&gt; ourselves, feel free to do so. We ALL appreciate it.

&gt; Are you trolling the Police and Genesis newsgroup too or is it just the fact
&gt; that VH is back on top with Roth that pisses you off so much?
">

The 3rd in the summer of cash grabs.  I never followed either of the
other two bands, so I don't care.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Shitty time to be a Hagar fan or anybody who said Roth was washed up or the
&gt; reunion would never happen.

Hagar has fans?

Au contrare, le petomaine.

&gt; Too funny!

You got that right.
