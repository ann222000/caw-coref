Disputes and Action

&lt; http://www.sabcnews.com/economy/labour/0,2172,152652,00.html &gt; 1.1 Transport workers want 8%

SABC, 16 July 2007
Road Accident Fund (RAF) employees in the Eastern Cape have joined the national strike to demand an 8% wage increase. The employees are all members of the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu).

The group has handed their list of demands to the provincial office of the department of transport in King Williams Town. The workers are also demanding a housing allowance. Workers have threatened that there will be no service delivery until their grievances receive attention. Denzel Skweyiya, the department's chief financial officer, accepted the memorandum.

More than 100 RAF employees, who are members of Satawu, were earlier demonstrating outside the RAF offices in Durban. Masakhane Gebhuza, the Satawu Durban chairperson, says their demonstration is part of the nationwide industrial action. They also want the housing subsidy to be increased.

&lt; http://www.theherald.co.za/herald/news/n07_17072007.htm &gt; 1.2 Emergency workers down tools

Lynn Williams, The Herald, 17 July 2007
Emergency services in Port Elizabeth came to a grinding halt again yesterday, and emergency calls were left unattended when workers downed tools to display their unhappiness with the Eastern Cape health department.

Telephones rang unanswered in the emergency services control room and ambulances stood idle at the depot.

National Allied and Health Workers' Union (Nehawu) regional secretary Xolile Vena said workers were stretched to the limit in the last two months as only six emergency workers had been forced to service the entire Nelson Mandela Bay area - with a population of more than 1,3 million - with only three ambulances.

He said none of the emergency workers due for the night shift last night would respond to emergency call-outs.

Their gripes date back to 2004 and include staff and vehicle shortages, overtime payments, lack of transformation, the training of paramedics and ambulance response times.

Veronique Potgieter said when she called for an ambulance for her diabetic aunt last night she was told there were none available. When she asked for an explanation, a man told her: &quot;You are wasting my time,&quot; and slammed down the phone.

Nehawu chairman Mpumelelo Qina warned that the protest action would continue until the union decided otherwise.

Provincial emergency medical and rescue services director Shanks Maharaj said formal notification of the protest had not been given and the workers had no right to deprive patients of medical care.

&lt; http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click;_id=594&amp;art;_id=vn2007071... &gt; 1.3 Council confident about resolving dispute

Anel Powell, Cape Times, 16 July 2007
The City of Cape Town is confident an agreement can be reached by the end of the month in the dispute declared two weeks ago by an irate group of Metro Police officers unhappy with their conditions of service.

David Beretti, executive director of the city's corporate services, said the city had called for a conciliation meeting to be held to try to resolve the dispute.

The dispute was declared after a group of about 30 police officers gathered at the Civic Centre to hand over a memorandum of grievances to city manager Achmat Ebrahim.

Among the 15 points in the document are complaints about the placements process and remuneration policy. The officers said the restructuring process, including new salary levels and grading, was &quot;unfair&quot;.

The officers, members of the South African Municipal Workers' Union (Samwu), called for a placement agreement to be drawn up by the city and unions.

Beretti said the declaration of a dispute in the bargaining council meant the city was limited in the way it could respond to the memorandum.

He said there were standard procedures and a &quot;built-in objection&quot; process for dealing with errors in calculating overtime or working out the remuneration of city staff.

&quot;We expressed disappointment in the manner in which the group came into the centre.&quot;

The city could not discuss the substance of the memorandum because of the dispute process, Beretti said.

The city would remain open to talks while it followed the dispute process, however.

Samwu's Andre Adams could not be reached for comment on Sunday.

&lt; http://www.fin24.co.za/articles/default/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&amp;A...; &gt; 1.4 Petrol strike may be avoided

News24, 16 July 2007
Progress was made in talks on Monday to avert a strike at oil refineries and fuel producers, the trade union Solidarity said.

Spokesperson Marius Croucamp said the unions met employers who made an official offer of a 7.5% wage increase. Negotiators indicated they would increase the offer to 8% provided the employer agreed.

&quot;They were only mandated to go to 7.5% but said they will go to 8% on condition that they get approval,&quot; Croucamp said.
The union decreased their demand from 10% to 9%.

Employers in the petroleum sector initially offered a 7% increase with unions wanting 10%.

The outcome of Monday's meeting would be taken back to union members where a decision on the way forward would be made, Croucamp said.

Talks in the industrial-chemical sector were scheduled for Wednesday. Employers in this sector were offering a 7.5% wage increase while unions demanded 10%.

Solidarity described the talks in both sectors as &quot;last ditch&quot; attempts to prevent industrial action.
The unions were issued a strike certificate over two weeks ago and have only to give their employers 48 hours notice should they decide to down tools.

&quot;Labour has been very patient,&quot; Croucamp said.

&quot;The trade unions are aware of their social responsibility to exhaust all possible options in order to avert a strike.

&quot;The trade unions' demands are not out of reach, the more so when the financial success of large companies in the industry, like Sasol and PetroSA, is taken into account,&quot; he said.

Companies that would be affected included Sasol, Shell, BP, Engen, Omnia and Afrox.

Solidarity represented some 6 400 of 20 000 workers in both sectors. Other unions involved were the Chemical, Energy, Paper, Printing, Wood and Allied Workers Union, the SA Chemical Workers Union, and the General industrial Workers Union of SA.

&lt; http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/topstories.aspx?ID=BD4A517683 &gt; 2.1 Soaring food prices bite hole in inflation target

Mariam Isa, Business Day, 17 July 2007
Food and fuel prices are set to remain high in the next few months, putting upward pressure on inflation and stretching the budgets of SA's poor majority, who spend half of their income on food.

Higher petrol prices are partly to blame but it is mainly the rising cost of food - a global trend - that has pushed inflation up through its 3%-6% target range, forcing the Reserve Bank to hike interest rates early last month.

Escalating prices for food staples such as grain, milk and meat have also driven inflation for low-income earners well above the levels experienced by affluent South Africans since the start of last year - a worrying trend for a developing country.

Poor people who live in rural areas are facing food inflation of up to 12% - considerably higher than the 6,9% annual increase paid by high-income earners who spend less than a fifth of their salaries on food.

&quot;These are the highest rates in several years,&quot; said Johann Els, an economist with Old Mutual Investment Group SA.

&quot;It means consumers who spend a large proportion of their income on food are under increasing pressure from double-digit price increases that are difficult for them to pay.&quot;

Food has the largest weighting in SA's main inflation gauges, ranging from 20% to 26%, compared with 5% to 7% for petrol - although the indirect effect of fuel costs is estimated at up to 16%.

The upward trend in both commodities poses a vexing problem for the Bank, as raising interest rates will have no effect on either - but it has to tackle the second-round effects of the price increases, which feed into both wage and inflation expectations.

&quot;Food will remain the largest contributor to inflation,&quot; said Standard Bank economist Elna Moolman. &quot;We expect the Bank to lift rates again at its next meeting next month - and the probability of a further hike is rising.&quot;

Crude oil futures in London edged above $78 a barrel yesterday, near the record peaks scaled last August. Oil prices have climbed 28% so far this year but in SA petrol costs have risen 20%, with strength in the rand helping to offset some of the price pressure.

But the upward trend in food prices could prove to be equally entrenched and more damaging.

The International Monetary Fund says global food prices have climbed an unprecedented 23% over the past 18 months and the US agriculture department estimates that global grain inventories are at their lowest level in 30 years.

Depending on which inflation measure one uses, local food costs rose at an annual rate of 8,7%-9,1% in May - both eight-month peaks.

That accounted for more than a third of the 6,4% annual rise in the CPIX index targeted for monetary policy, double the combined contribution of transport and fuel.

&quot;I still think we will see food inflation ticking higher before topping out,&quot; said Econometrix MD George Glynos. &quot;It is one of the factors that will prevent inflation from subsiding back to 5% or below.&quot;

Higher grain prices are the main culprit, spurred partly by regional drought but mainly by increased demand from developing countries such as China, along with the growing use of agricultural commodities to make biofuels.

&lt; http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/topstories.aspx?ID=BD4A517653 &gt; 2.2 Angry delivery protests worry ANC

Chantelle Benjamin, Business Day, 17 July 2007
The African National Congress (ANC) said yesterday it was deeply concerned about service delivery protests following another violent protest in Johannesburg at the weekend, saying some came from communities with genuine gripes and while others were politically motivated.

The comments also followed a call yesterday by Democratic Alliance (DA) spokesman on provincial and local government Willem Doman for poorly performing councillors to be sacked, after questions to parliament allegedly revealed that only an Eastern Cape councillor had been fired for poor performance.

ANC spokesman Smuts Ngonyama said yesterday that discussions were being held within the party to address the protests which had already claimed the life of an ANC mayor, councillor and city official, and caused damage to government property.

&quot;Some of these protests come from communities with genuine delivery issues and some are politically motivated, but there is often a thin line between the two and we give them the same amount of weight and attention,&quot; Ngonyama said.

At the weekend angry hostel dwellers from central Johannesburg, Soweto and Alexandra took to the streets to protest about conditions at the hostels, some of which have no running water.

Led by comments made by frustrated community members that councillors were not concerned about the communities they served, which were repeated to President Thabo Mbeki during presidential imbizos to various areas, most recently Soweto, the party has proposed giving more power to regional ANC branches to appoint councillors instead of having these councillors selected at national level.

The proposal, made during the ANC policy conference late last month, will be considered at the ANC national congress in December and is largely expected to be supported.

Political analyst Steven Friedman warns, however, that it would be a long time before communities would begin to see the benefits of such a move, which means protests over poor service delivery are likely to continue and intensify.

He said firing councillors was also not the solution.

&quot;The ANC replaced 60% of its councillors during the recent local government elections, but unhappiness over service delivery has intensified,&quot; said Friedman. &quot;The solution is to ensure that these councillors are seen by communities as representative of their interests, rather than the interest of national government.&quot;

Ngonyama said the party was working to ensure there was more interaction at structures on the ground. &quot;Information about what is being achieved is not filtering to the communities,&quot; he said. &quot;And councillors will continue to face the wrath of communities because they are at the coal face.&quot;

It was announced last month that Provincial and Local Government Minister Sydney Mufamadi had launched an investigation of the current system of government to see whether it was meeting the objective of serving the people.

&lt; http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3937755 &gt; 2.3 Call for basic grant for the poor and unemployed

Siyabonga Mkhwanazi, The Star, 17 July 2007
Desmond Tutu has urged the government to implement a basic income grant to relieve the plight of the poor and the unemployed, against concerted resistance from the ANC.

Tutu said research had shown that in most countries where a BIG is offered, recipients of the grant are healthy and their achievement level rises constantly.

This was his submission at the opening of the triennial national conference of the South African Council Churches in Sandton yesterday.

Tutu's comment comes after the ANC rejected a BIG at its national policy conference and resolved that any welfare grants for the unemployed had to be linked to some kind of a job.

President Thabo Mbeki's cabinet, with the exception of Social Development Minister Zola Skweyiya, is also opposed to a BIG, with presidential aides saying this would be more expensive than comprehensive social security programmes.

But Tutu appealed to the government to reconsider its stance.

He explained that most countries in the developed world offer what they call income transfers, which had an impact on the quality of people's lives.

&quot;The health of their children improved. Attendance at school improved. Their achievement level rises,&quot; he explained.

Tutu also decried the crime situation, including the rape of children, and warned against academic debates and &quot;semantic games&quot; regarding crime.

He added that if the country was able to defeat the monster of apartheid, it followed that people could defeat criminality.

He expressed concern at the scourge of sexual abuse of children by grown-up men.

Tutu also urged society to learn from the past generations, which upheld high moral and ethical values.

&quot;Our parents were poor but were dignified. They had self-respect. Why is it that you don't have a sense of shame when you steal money (from) pensioners? What has happened to us?&quot; asked Tutu.

Meanwhile, he praised South Africa's political stability and freedoms that came amid conflagrations.

&quot;Do you remember the assassination of Chris Hani? If our country did not go up in flames then, it never will. We have become an example to the world on how to deal with conflict. Let us celebrate our freedom,&quot; he said.

&lt; http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3936953 &gt; 2.4 Khutsong hit by protests over suspended teachers

Baldwin Ndaba, The Star, 17 July 2007
Learning was again disrupted in Khutsong when hundreds of pupils demanded that all those teachers suspended by the North West Education Department return to work.

Protest action began yesterday morning at Badirile Senior Secondary, where over 1 000 pupils and teachers turned up at the school.

A school assembly was held, and minutes later, school principal Goodwin Babupi held a staff meeting at which all the teachers committed themselves to teaching following a three-month school boycott in protest against Khutsong's incorporation into North West.

Schooling in Khutsong was affected from April when residents continued to protest against local councillors, who were seeking to hold a public meeting to plead with residents to accept their incorporation into North West.

Subsequently, a series of public meetings was held, where a boycott of classes was proposed.
Four Badirile teachers, including its principal and Jomo Mogale, the alleged mastermind of the protest actions, were served with suspension letters in May.

Babupi was found guilty last month of disobeying a lawful instruction and was docked a month's salary.

While others were still awaiting their disciplinary hearings and remain suspended, Babupi returned to school and struggled to keep the pupils in their classes.

The roads were barricaded with drums and burning tyres.

Daniel Matlhong, of the Congress of South African Students, told The Star that pupils had vowed to stay away from school until the North West Education Department reinstates the suspended teachers.

&quot;Our teachers were suspended for nothing,&quot; Matlhong said.

The situation was tense at the school, and one of the teachers - who wanted to remain anonymous - complained about being intimidated when he tried to give accounting lessons. He said some pupils walked into his class and started to hurl insults at him until he stopped teaching.

The pupils also ignored attempts by various teachers encouraging them to go to their classes and instead chose to take their protest actions to the streets.

The North West Education Department admitted that less than 40% of pupils attended school in Khutsong yesterday.

&lt; http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3936945 &gt; 2.5 Vlok to stand trial over Chikane's poisoning

Beauregard Tromp, The Star, 17 July 2007
Apartheid-era minister of police Adriaan Vlok and four of his colleagues will be charged for the assassination attempt on Reverend Frank Chikane.

Vlok, former police general Johann van der Merwe and three apartheid-era policemen will be charged with attempted murder on August 17 in the Pretoria High Court.

Spokesperson Panyaza Lesufi said the National Prosecuting Authority was completing its investigations into four other cases, two of which dealt with members of the liberation organisations.

Since news of Vlok's imminent prosecution was leaked, speculation was rife that this would only see members of the apartheid regime being prosecuted.

Vlok is reportedly in hospital, undergoing a medical procedure.

The attorney for the three policemen, Jan Wagenaar, recently indicated that he and his clients were in negotiation with the NPA with various permutations being considered as a settlement before going to court.

In September last year, Vlok apologised to Chikane in a ceremony where he washed the chief of the Office of the Presidency's feet and asked his forgiveness. The symbolic act was hailed by President Thabo Mbeki, while others denounced it as &quot;too little too late&quot;.

Chikane has repeatedly stated that he wanted all those responsible to step forward and admit their guilt.

The assassination attempt took place during 1989, when Chikane was head of the South African Council of Churches. The idea was to poison the reverend's underwear, which would fatally affect his nervous system.

Lesufi warned that anybody who failed to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission ran the risk of prosecution.

Former military commander of the PAC and current president, Letlapa Mphahlele, has often been cited as a possible candidate for prosecution. Mphahlele was responsible for a number of attacks on &quot;soft targets&quot;, including the Heidelberg Tavern massacre and the St James massacre.

&quot;The NPA works on its own. We cannot decide what to do on its behalf. If they should decide to prosecute Letlapa Mphahlele they must do so,&quot; said PAC spokesperson Mudini Maivha.

The PAC welcomed the prosecution. The party said the NPA should have prosecuted the late president PW Botha and should prosecute former minister of defence Magnus Malan.

The government should also be careful of channelling too many resources into following up on these prosecutions instead of channelling funds to critical areas of development.

At the TRC, Vlok sought amnesty only for the bombings of Khotso House, Cosatu House and the SA Catholic Bishops' Conference headquarters.

In 1988 Vlok charged ANC activist Shirley Gunn for the Khotso House bombing, an operation actually performed by his own policemen. The charges saw Gunn and her 16-month-old son spend two months behind bars.

Yesterday Gunn greeted the news that Vlok was to be charged with delight.

She said the TRC had offered conditional amnesty but that people like Vlok had not lived up to the conditions by making full disclosure.

&lt; http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=553&amp;fArticleId;=3937146 &gt; 2.6 Erwin puts his foot in it again on affirmative action

Peter de Ionno, Business Report, 17 July 2007
Public enterprises minister Alec Erwin is not averse to putting his proverbial foot in it. He has done so again, while in London, on affirmative action in the South African workplace.

Erwin told the SA Business Club that South Africa's skills shortage would be greater if it had not been for affirmative action, but that the issue was dead &quot;in many respects, not as far as policy is concerned, but as a requirement&quot; in job interviews.

Business may hope for a loosening of the policy. It is a pretty loose policy - not a requirement in law, but articulated through employment equity legislation, which sets broad goals, rather than quotas, for companies in the private sector.

Erwin's remarks are cold comfort to those who believe the government is moving away from an interventionist stance in the labour market.

The remarks have evoked a storm of comment from leading black commentators. Employment equity commission chairman Jimmy Manyi, who says the policy needs more muscle, has been joined by the chairman of the Presidential Black Business Working Group, Peter Vundla.

Vundla believes businesses are not going to carry out a policy out of the goodness of their hearts. He says there is little progress on black advancement in the corporate environment, but he is loathe to suggest that many corporate executives simply do not believe that black people are competent for the available jobs.

Repeated attempts to garner comment from labour minister Membathisi Mdladlana have proved fruitless. It is clear that his silence does not reflect consent.

Comment

&lt; http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3936749 &gt; 3.1 Communists shed old skin

Moshoehsoe Monare, The Star, 17 July 2007
When 32-year-old youth leader David Masondo ascended the stage as the most popular and the newest SA Communist Party central committee member, the 69-year old veteran Ronnie Kasrils was, literally and figuratively, at the exit.

The reckless militancy of Masondo, chairman of the Young Communist League, became undisguised last year when he called for the arrest of President Thabo Mbeki &quot;for his role&quot; in the arms deal.

Intelligence Minister Kasrils was punished for being on Mbeki's side.

The election of Masondo, who received the highest number of votes, and the walking away of Kasrils epitomise what one delegate described as an &quot;open succession combat&quot; and a &quot;radical facelift&quot; of the party.

SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande - who was re-elected unanimously - described the outcome of the conference as a &quot;foundation&quot; for building working class power in the ruling party.

The central committee was fumigated of those who were perceived to be Mbeki sympathisers.
They include Cosatu President Willie Madisha and Provincial and Local Government Minister Sydney Mufamadi, who withdrew their candidature.

Safety and Security Minister and party chairman Charles Nqakula was replaced by former National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) leader Gwede Mantashe, while National Prosecuting Authotiy executive Dipuo Mvelase was also ousted as deputy chairperson. But they were retained in the central committee.

Deputy Health Minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge, a nemesis of Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang who is an Mbeki ally, also managed to get into the central committee.
However her election - and that of nine other women - marked a slight improvement in gender equity in the 30-member central committee.

The suspension of national treasurer Philip Dexter, the dismissal from YCL of Mazibuko Jara, the dissolution of Gauteng YCL structure and suspension of Gauteng SACP regional executive members are a consequence of this succession shockwave and a power struggle.

Unionists who were voted into the central committee include NUM president Senzeni Zokwana, a staunch hardline supporter of Zuma.

Zuma couldn't help smiling when he read about the new leadership.

&quot;Our revolution is going through a test, it therefore needs leaders who must be able to withstand and overcome the troubles. I'm therefore convinced that as you are nominating today, you'll also keep that in mind that the leadership must go across these troubled waters. The task is that if you don't carry it correctly, you'll regret and live with it for a very long time,&quot; Zuma warned SACP delegates on Saturday.

However, delegates also retained hardcore communists such as deputy general secretary Jeremy Cronin.

But hardcore communists appear to have an isolated voice, drowned out by a sycophantic united crowd that, according to one Gauteng official, &quot;is blindly loyal to the cult leader (Nzimande)&quot;.

In assessing the new crop, one former leader expressed disappointment at &quot;the deterioration of the SACP&quot;. This sounds like sour grapes.

But even Mantashe spoke of a need to imbue the quality of members while at the same time growing the party.

There was a sharp contrast between his tone, unifying and acknowledging problems within the party, and that of Nzimande who was combative and brushing away party problems as media-manufactured and cynics' attempts to &quot;defocus and derail us&quot;.

While the excitement that characterised the closure of the congress was informed by a complacent satisfaction of victory, the post-succession challenges seem to be underestimated.

Nzimande said they would consolidate power in the ANC and the state.

The SACP and Cosatu passionately want to overhaul the ANC's national executive committee and government with worker-friendly &quot;cadres&quot;, possibly those who were elected last weekend in Port Elizabeth.

But this could end up being what policy guru Joel Netshitenzhe once cynically termed a phuma singene scenario (kicking out the old guard for the personal interests of the new guard).

Mantashe, cautious of the paralysis that happened after Cosatu and SACP leaders went into government en masse in 1994, admits that &quot;there must be a strong SACP beyond December&quot;.

It's possible, especially if Zuma and the Left do &quot;capture the ANC&quot;, that the same tensions within the SACP and Cosatu will escalate, perhaps even more, between the current Zuma supporters and those who remained behind.

On the other hand, the SACP was forced - by a hostile attitude within the ANC - to take this radical route.

They were bullied to a corner by a pompous ANC attitude that was personified by the likes of the late NEC member Dumisani Makhaye.

Had it not been the reaction and noise from the same unionists and Zuma supporters, the ANC would have gone on a unilateral policy and political path unchecked.

Even though Mbeki once warned communists not to think that they are genuine representatives of the poor and the Left, the SACP and Cosatu's uncomfortable presence in the alliance has kept the ruling party on its toes.

Nzimande said at the closure of the congress that the new leaders would put brakes on the unabated marginalisation and victimisation of leaders in the ANC.

Unless the new leaders grow fatter and comfortable in the trappings of power, the working class can rest assured that their interests won't be forgotten.

SACP and Cosatu have - through community campaigns, strikes and marches - strengthened the voice and muscle of the workers.

It is the same voice which ensured that government officials admitted policy misjudgments and forced a rethink, and a subsequent shift.

While Zuma survived a vicious political purge, as a result of a vocal SACP and Cosatu, these organisations in turn found fertile ground in a pro-Zuma lobby to mount a further tactical political onslaught in the battle for state power.

But it was ANC members who - after the 2005 national general council - felt liberated from a stifling centralised leadership within the ruling party.

It was the alliance partners which protested against the abuse of state organs when former Safety and Security Minister Steve Tshwete allegedly used his office to fight party power struggles in the name of a looming coup against Mbeki.

But the SACP has not healed from the wounds of the succession battle, leadership infighting, the financial morass, unclear political paths and dependence on Cosatu.

The SACP's reliance on the mood swings of the ANC sidetracked its political programme. This is why it was so painful for the SACP congress to reluctantly decide to contest elections.

It appears the most paralysing stroke to the SACP would be when the ANC functions normally (without leadership infighting) and is able to respond to the needs of its core constituency.

&lt; http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/opinion.aspx?ID=BD4A517491 &gt; 3.2 Crafty SACP keeps powder dry in SA's class war

Karima Brown, Business Day, 17 July 2007
Whether the South African Communist Party (SACP) goes it alone in elections in 2009 or thereafter, any decision to do so should not be taken outside the context of the balance of forces in the ruling African National Congress (ANC).

Not if the SACP wants to remain a serious player on the political scene in SA.

That the ANC is the largest political force in the country is not debatable. As a multiclass organisation, the ANC has traditionally been the site of fierce contests as factions and ideological tendencies slug it out for control and influence. The reality is that whichever faction ends up in power gets the controlling share in determining the political and economic destiny of SA for the foreseeable future. Communists and leftist forces in the ANC know this. But this is not the only reason the SACP should engage in the struggle for the &quot;soul&quot; of the ruling party. Any characterisation of post-apartheid SA continues to reveal the dialectic link between class and national struggles. The late Joe Slovo used to refer to it as the &quot;class content of the national struggle and the national content of the class struggle&quot;.

Put differently, the post-apartheid economic order can be characterised as one in which there is positive economic growth and opportunity for amassing wealth for a few. But despite unprecedented growth levels, growth is still not shared, resulting in continued skewed development. The main beneficiary of the economic boom remains white monopoly capital. Even the so-called black middle classes still suffer the consequences of a racist past. In class terms, they remain second-class citizens. Congress of South African Trade Unions general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi aptly says members of the black middle class have been reduced to the role of &quot;indunas&quot; in the economy. &quot;In a word, they remain oppressed as the white oligarchy remains firmly entrenched in power,&quot; Vavi told delegates at the SACP's elective conference last week.

But to come back to why the SACP appears to be taking a wait-and-see approach. For the first time since 2002 - when the left suffered a major defeat and was hounded out for being &quot;ultra left and counterrevolutionary&quot; for opposing the government's macroeconomic policies, among them the wholesale privatisation of state-owned enterprises, and the &quot;right-sizing&quot; of the public service (all of which have come to a halt due, in part, to struggles waged by the left in the alliance) - more space does exist in the ANC for a major realignment at both policy and leadership levels. The outcome of this could advance a leftist agenda in an unprecedented way.

While nothing is guaranteed in politics, it would be prudent for the SACP to use the fluidity that could come about as a result of a policy and leadership change in the ANC. The nexus between policy choices and who leads the ANC is well understood within the alliance. Of course, this does not mean the SACP should put off the question of defining its role and how it will go about building socialism under democratic conditions, which remains its most pressing challenge. My point is that the two processes are not mutually exclusive. The reality is that the ANC and the SACP draw on the same support base. That they fish in the same pond is a reality that complicates any kind of electoral pact between the two, should the SACP go it alone in elections or under a reconfigured alliance. It therefore comes as little surprise that the SACP chose to keep its sights firmly set on developments within the ANC, while at the same time focusing on building working-class power in six key centres, including the state, the economy and communities.

No doubt there are those on both the left and right of the political spectrum that want nothing more than to see an end to the relationship between the ANC and its pesky alliance partners on the left. But rumours of the death of the alliance appear to have been greatly exaggerated. At the same time, though, so have the prospects of its life-span , which some mistakenly say will continue in perpetuity.

Some, like those in the Democratic Alliance and business, are of the view that a wrecked alliance would hasten and speed up the necessary realignment that needs to happen in SA's body politic. Such an eventuality, they say, would then see the meeting of minds along ideological and class lines that would transcend party political and even racial differences.

On the other hand, there are those on the left who argue that a more independent SACP, freed from the ANC, would hasten the dawn of socialism in SA, something that can never be achieved as long as the SACP is locked into a relationship with the ruling party. There is a third view, shared by the old guard, which holds that the SACP should operate as a &quot;socialist affairs desk&quot; of the liberation movement, rubber-stamping government policy positions, and in so doing remain compliant and a &quot;reliable&quot; left ally, content on living off the largesse of the state.

By choosing not to collapse all its options into an electoral paradigm, the SACP has sidestepped the dangers inherent in electoral politics that have seen other political parties banished to the electoral fringe. Instead, the party has opted for a crafty set of manoeuvres that allows it to maximise its presence at all levels of the state, including in the legislatures, government departments and other key sites of power, but retain the right to contest power under its own banner in the future.

Hennie van Vuuren, Business Day, 17 July 2007
A battle between bulls is how Mmatshilo Motsei, author of the book The Kanga and the Kangaroo Court recently depicted the leadership race within the African National Congress (ANC). A battle between men, fought in the shadows about who will be the power behind, or on, the throne of the South African Presidency in 2009. Therein lies the rub. The contest for the leadership of the ANC is emerging as an anti-democratic process that is neither directly shaped by ordinary voters nor by the hundreds of thousands of members who make up the ANC.

It is shaping up into a three-way contest between President Thabo Mbeki, Jacob Zuma and Tokyo Sexwale. Anyone who dares enter the bullfight, we are told by the apparatchiks, is acting against the tradition of the ANC that favours leaders to &quot;emerge&quot; through consensus. Naturally this assumes that tradition is static and belongs to only those who have voice and power. The result is promise of a nameless &quot;compromise candidate&quot;, who waits in the wings, and once tipped by some unknown force, will be delivered to the people in the days before the trek to the party conference in Polokwane begins . The hard question the majority of South Africans, as bystanders, need to ask is: how democratic is this? Does it favour a popular president or a patron?

Surely the hallmark of an open process would be that those politicians who wish to lead their party should not fear presenting themselves to the public as a candidate. This would give us, the people, an opportunity to engage with their ideas and, importantly, with how they interpret the policies of the ruling party. The wail from those who favour back-room deals is that the leader is merely an instrument to give effect to policy. They could not be further off the mark.

If tradition is anything to go by, we should not forget that Gear, Mbeki's macroeconomic strategy the left has come to hate, was foisted upon the party, not through consultation but rather, like snow on the Highveld: a fait accompli that unexpectedly arrived at the doorstep of the party. The truth is that politics has come to trump party policy in SA. It is the party leader who sets the tone and effectively shapes policy . The recent ANC conference was a case in point. While Mbeki made a few concessions, they were mere nods to reform on key issues . Tellingly, he left it to his SABC interview, after the conference, to declare that he will make himself available to lead the ruling party for a third term. It was an opportunity for supporters to break into song that Mbeki is indeed &quot;fit to govern&quot;.

These factors should make one suspicious when analysts and others promise that an appropriate &quot;compromise&quot; candidate will emerge. The truth is that this almost mythical force will not be someone who has presented and debated their interpretation of policy with party structures in Diepsloot or in Durban, or for that matter among mineworkers and their bosses.

Rather, if a compromise candidate does emerge, we are at the mercy of the wisdom of a back-room deal between competing factions within the ANC. While the tradition of elite pacts is not new to SA, it does not serve attempts to build a sustainable culture of democracy . Rather, it has an alienating function, as &quot;important&quot; decisions are left to those who are somehow better equipped to govern. The impatience of people with back-room politics that is neither participatory nor delivers on basic services is exemplified in the latest wave of service-delivery protests.

While the reasons for such protests are complex, the truth is that people are demanding more robust engagement with leadership. The country's leaders would be foolish not to listen. The demand is that they should learn to do so more intently.

Part of that engagement is on the values that a future leader of the ANC represents. This is another juncture at which the compromise option fails. A deal maker will allow us little space to understand his or her approach to alleviating poverty, unemployment, the economy and HIV/AIDS. Rather, it is reduced to the bland debate that we have at the moment - we know that Zuma is supported by sections of the left in the tripartite alliance but still have little understanding of what kind of SA Zuma envisions.

The concern is that such leaders become beholden to the narrow factional interests that ushered them into power. This entrenches a system of patronage. The system that has been the undoing of politics across our continent is a fast track to corrupt rule that largely benefits only the ruling elite . Zuma is an obvious case in point. He may not have been involved in a generally corrupt relationship but the image of Schabir Shaik pressing envelopes of money into his hand is surely not the stuff modern African presidents are made of.

Others say Sexwale is in a league of his own when it comes to patronage - the manner in which he has awarded share options in his company to senior judges and politicians is a case in point. While respected political analyst Xolela Mangcu has described Sexwale as the &quot;next Kennedy&quot; on these pages, he protests that the shares he received from Sexwale had nothing to do with buying influence . Mangcu's defence, that he is but &quot;one in a million&quot; beneficiaries, is trite considering that Sexwale has made him a multimillionaire. How many of the ordinary people who benefit from broad-based black economic empowerment can say the same? It's a more refined, but no less insidious, form of patronage than that of which Shaik was found guilty.

The fact that Zuma is heaped with scorn while Sexwale receives muted criticism from his peers in business and the government points to the fact that we have not developed a principled response of rejecting patronage. On the other hand, there is a real danger that Mbeki's claim to a third term as head of the ANC will culminate in a puppet presidency - somebody who owes more to Mbeki, as political patron, than to the electorate. The lesson from Namibia is that such a setup either sees the president kept on a tight leash or engaged in destructive defiance of the party leader. Surely this is not the culture of accountability that Mbeki has come to champion?

It is time that the race for the presidency of the ANC was thrown wide open, so that candidates can present their vision of a SA post-2010 to the ANC branches and the public at large. Are there only three men capable of this task in a nation of 48-million? SA needs a leader of integrity, not a patron, to govern as president. The people are fit to decide. We exclude them at our collective peril.

&lt; http://www.pretorianews.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3937093 &gt; 4.1 Labour federations prepare for collapse of Zimbabwe

Sapa-AFP, Pretoria News, 17 July 2007
Southern African labour federations are preparing for the collapse of the Zimbabwean economy.

&quot;We are worried that if mediation fails, the Zimbabwe economy will collapse completely, with dire consequences for the poor of that country and the region as a whole,&quot; said Cosatu and the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) in a joint statement.

Cosatu would discuss a package of humanitarian interventions with its alliance and civil society partners &quot;in preparation for this reality&quot;, general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said.

Cosatu held talks with a ZCTU delegation in Johannesburg yesterday.

&quot;What do we do if that economy eventually collapses altogether?&quot; he asked.

&quot;No one is going to stop the flow of Zimbabweans into South Africa and other countries.&quot;

About 5 000 Zimbabweans were being arrested trying to cross the border into South Africa every week.

It was time that South Africans realised that their challenges of poverty and unemployment were a &quot;Sunday picnic&quot; compared with the struggle over the border, said Vavi.

A solution to the crisis in Zimbabwe had to be found &quot;yesterday&quot;, said ZCTU general secretary Wellington Shibebe.

&quot;Today is too late and tomorrow will be disaster.&quot;

Zimbabwe might have got its freedom in 1980, but it &quot;forgot to bring democracy and all the necessary freedoms&quot; to its people, he said.

The trade union federations called on the Zimbabwean government to admit to the crisis.

They urged the Zimbabwean government to call off its &quot;short-term populist actions&quot; and co-operate with the mediation process instigated by the Southern African Development Community.

The DA said yesterday that refugee camps should be set up near the border to house and feed Zimbabweans fleeing their country.

&quot;If the government takes its humanitarian duties seriously, Home Affairs will immediately begin to investigate setting up refugee camps to assist the people from Zimbabwe who so desperately need our help,&quot; the DA's Mark Lowe said.

He said that as the situation in Zimbabwe deteriorated, more refugees were expected to arrive in South Africa.

It is estimated that 3 million Zimbabweans are in South Africa illegally.

Lowe said the Lindela Repatriation Centre was not helping to curb immigration as the centre lacked the capacity to deal with the huge numbers of people coming through its gates.

&quot;Home Affairs should consider all the various options open to them, and consult the UN High Commissioner of Refugees on the best possible means to assist those fleeing from Zimbabwe.

&quot;They must be fed and sheltered until the situation improves,&quot; he said.

International resources should be mobilised to assist in the care of Zimbabweans in South Africa, he said.

* The University of Edinburgh confirmed yesterday that it had withdrawn an honorary doctorate awarded to Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe in 1984 because of concern over his human rights record.

The decision - the first time the British institution has taken such a step since it was founded in 1583 - was confirmed after Mugabe (83) failed to meet a weekend deadline to file a written appeal, a spokesperson said.

Zimbabwe has dismissed the decision as &quot;meaningless&quot;.

4.2 ITUC protests Israeli Army break-in at TU offices

Infoshop News, 10 July 2007
&lt; http://www.infoshop.org/inews/index.php?topic=32 &gt; Brussels, 6 July 2007: Acting on a report from its Palestinian affiliate the PGFTU, the ITUC has expressed its grave concerns over a break-in by members of the Israeli Defence Force at the PGFTU's Ramallah offices early in the morning of 4 July. In a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, ITUC General Secretary Guy Ryder called on the Israeli authorities to conduct a full investigation into the soldiers' actions, to compensate the PGFTU for damage done to the premises, and to return any information or documents taken from the offices.

&quot;The ITUC attaches the highest importance to the inviolability of trade union premises, and deplores any intervention into the legitimate activities of a trade union organisation&quot;, said Ryder. &quot;The PGFTU must be allowed to carry out its legitimate work on behalf of Palestinian workers in full freedom and in the absence of any such interference in the future,&quot; he added.
