Noam Chomsky: Options On The Table

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~

Liberty is not for these slaves; I do not advocate inflicting it against their conscience.
On the contrary, I am strongly in favor of letting them crawl and grovel all they
please before whatever fraud or combination of frauds they choose to venerate...Our
whole practical government is grounded in mob psychology and.. the Boobus Americanus
will follow any command that promises to make him safer.&quot; --H. L. Menchen -- 1956.

O liberty! O liberty! What crimes are committed in thy name!: Madame Jeanne-Marie
Roland

=
The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the
spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to understands the minds of other men
and women. Learned Hand

=
He that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression;
for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself:
Thomas Paine

=
Liberty is meaningless where the right to utter one's thoughts and opinions has
ceased to exist. That, of all rights, is the dread of tyrants. It is the right which
they first of all strike down: Frederick Douglass

=
He who dares not offend cannot be honest: Thomas Paine

Options On The Table

The sabre-rattling rhetoric about &quot;containing Iran&quot; has escalated to the point where

presidential candidates - possibly even nuclear weapons.

American; and, of course, former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
