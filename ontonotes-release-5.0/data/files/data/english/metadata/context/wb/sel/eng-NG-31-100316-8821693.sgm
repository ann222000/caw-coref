*About The Company:*
Pritish Nandy Communications is one of the first corporate entities in
Bollywood. Founded by Pritish Nandy, wellknown poet and journalist, PNC has
been professionally managed from its very inception. It was one of the first
media and entertainment companies to go public in 2000, when it listed on
India's two best known stock exchanges, the BSE and the NSE, where it is
among the few listed stocks in the sector. *Well known global funds like
Soros, Oppenheimer, Alliance and Lloyd George hold PNC stock*. The company
has grown consistently and has an unbroken profit and dividend record over
the 12 years of its existence. It has won many awards for its management
excellence and is the first company in the movie business to pursue
corporate excellence goals and targets. At the same time, it nurtures talent
and has launched some of the biggest names in the creativity business.
