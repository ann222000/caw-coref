Dunno, but if the civility of this post is any indication, it's not
surprising...

They should ban those kiddie cab carts during high traffic times. I love it
when they try to fit into the video section which has huge signs saying NO
CARTS...

How about the people that leave their cart blocking the aisle and wander off
for 20 minutes somewhere else?

How about the chatters who run into each other and have to catch up on what
they've been doing all their lives while blocking all the rest of the
people?

And one more while I'm on a roll - the stockers who roll their carts right
into you or right in front of what you're trying to look at as if it's more
important to stock the shelves than to have a customer purchase an item!

It's the slow ones who drive me nuts. To me, grocery shopping is a
chore to be completed in the quickest and most efficient manner
possible; it is not my social event of the evening/weekend. Do people
not know what they need to buy before they enter a store? They saunter
down the aisles, leaning on their carts and gawping and canned soup
like it's the Mona Lisa.

I have actually started taking one of my lunch breaks during the week
for grocery shopping (my car is colder than a refrigerator these days
anyway :) just so I can get in there when the aisles aren't blocked by
people who appear to be confused enough about the difference between
smooth and chunky peanut butter that it takes them and their giant cart
5 minutes to trundle slowly past the display.

JFC on a stick, people, MOVE.

I am never outwardly rude, but I am frequently fuming inwardly :p

sigh. So half the shoppers are inwardly raging about slow walkers and
half are seething about cart-crashing speed demons... The behavior i
see described in this thread is topologically congruent to road rage.

Remember that popular attitudinal quote? The one that goes &quot;Lack of
planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part?&quot;
Well, here's a thought: why don't all of you just friggin' plan your
schedules to allow enough time to accomodate the probable conditions in
the store.

Everyone [the .002% who don't, just shut up] has to grocery shop.

Here's another thought: how about trying to make the experience NICER
for EVERYBODY.

Me, i take my time, smile at the hot moms, make a point to be friendly
to everyone i interact with, customer and staff, stay out of the way of
the NASCAR shoppers, say excuse me and offer a spot in line if it seems
like it might make someone's life easier. etc.

You people need to live in a submarine for a while and get your social
skillz recalibrated.

"/> much ranting snippage

IMO it's not just the grocery store ... people everywhere are extremely rude
these days. You let people out of a driveway or lot and they can't even
wave a simple &quot;thanks&quot; to you. You say &quot;excuse me&quot; nicely to somebody in
the store so maybe they'll step aside and let you pass since they are in
your way and they don't move, at all, not one inch. I usually throw a &quot;or
not&quot; in as I'm squeezing by. People drive like total assholes, in a huge
rush to get out onto the road they cut you off, then proceed to do less than
the speed limit (and there's nobody behind you for miles, so it's not like
they *had* to take the opening when they saw it). What else? Oh yes,
people don't hold doors anymore, they let them whack the person behind them
rather than being courteous. The left lane of the highway is for higher
speed drivers, move out of the way for chrissake if somebody comes up behind
you ... especially on a two lane road. Right lane for driving, left lane
for passing, very simple people and, IMO I don't think you should drive in
the right lane of a 3+ lane highway unless you're getting on or off.

It's not everybody and it's not one age group - it's a mix. I think that
people in general just don't care about other people in general any more.
They just don't give a shit and it's pretty sad. I've done my good deeds to
help people out who look like they need it, I enjoy being helpful, but when
I don't get a simple 'thank you' it pisses me off.

Humanity is going downhill and that's a big part of why I choose not to
contribute to population explosion by having kids of my own.

Wouldn't you have less of a schedule constraint shopping outside of your
lunch hour?

Unbearable is a state of mind. It's subjective and you have control
over it -- you can choose how you want to respond, and if you're a
little long at the store, so what?

Lunch Hour is a state of time -- it's 60 minutes minus transit time, and
it's a fixed interval. Much less control, and there may be adverse
economic consequences. Plus you're jammed in there with all the other
speed maniac shoppers.

"/> Heh. Some time back, I went shopping with a guy who had seriously
injured his leg during a fall while hiking in the mountains.

There is no predictable time to find empty groceries in this area, but
we tried to hit an off moment. He was on crutches, and when we got to
the store (Safeway), it was pretty vacant.

He had no choice but to move slowly, so it took a while to do his stuff.
Meanwhile, even though the store traffic was light, I watched total
strangers shove him with their carts, and cast either dirty looks or
clearly audible aspersions at his plight.

By the time he got out of there, he was so stressed I thought his hair
would turn grey before my eyes. He didn't go shopping again until after
he got off his crutches.

You know, if he had been a total jerk, deliberately getting in people's
way and carelessly wasting other's time, I could see (if not accept)
their meaness. But he was trying hard to stay out of other shoppers'
way. After witnessing that little jaunt, I have come to think many
people seek out opportunities to get away with hurting others without
penalty.

less than

like

yes,
&gt; people don't hold doors anymore, they let them whack the person
behind them
&gt; rather than being courteous. The left lane of the highway is for
higher

behind
&gt; you ... especially on a two lane road. Right lane for driving, left
lane
&gt; for passing, very simple people and, IMO I don't think you should
drive in
&gt; the right lane of a 3+ lane highway unless you're getting on or off.

&gt; It's not everybody and it's not one age group - it's a mix. I think
that
&gt; people in general just don't care about other people in general any
more.
&gt; They just don't give a shit and it's pretty sad. I've done my good
deeds to

you live in the eastern half of the country? I'm asking because I don't

I am also wondering where you folks live who encounter this rudeness. I
live in the South, and courtesy still does exist. I often get doors opened
for me, and I do so for others. Rushing around in a major grocery store
certainly exists, but I see more politeness about it than rudeness.

When I lived in a smaller town, it was considered rude not to speak to
everyone in the grocery store---just hello, but if you knew them you
certainly needed to ask them how they were doing, etc. If you were rude in
the grocery store, that information would certainly be passed around, and
you would be thought the lesser for it.

In the larger towns and cities, these days we seem to live in anonymity, and
that seems to allow a lot of rude behavior with impunity.

I like not living in a fish bowl, but sometimes I miss the ways of small
town living.

I greatly fear that some of those moving down to our area from some parts of
the country are not used to courtesy. I see it often when at a four-way
stop. According to law and custom, there is a specific order in which each
car is supposed to take his turn through the intersection, but it has
sometimes become chaos because some drivers think it's every man for
himself, with no order.

I read somewhere that you should be kind to everyone you meet, because each
person is fighting a tough battle in life. I've thought about that many
times, and I believe that it's true.

&gt;Heh. Some time back, I went shopping with a guy who had seriously
&gt;injured his leg during a fall while hiking in the mountains.

&gt;There is no predictable time to find empty groceries in this area, but
&gt;we tried to hit an off moment. He was on crutches, and when we got to
&gt;the store (Safeway), it was pretty vacant.

&gt;He had no choice but to move slowly, so it took a while to do his stuff.
&gt;Meanwhile, even though the store traffic was light, I watched total
&gt;strangers shove him with their carts, and cast either dirty looks or
&gt;clearly audible aspersions at his plight.

&gt;By the time he got out of there, he was so stressed I thought his hair
&gt;would turn grey before my eyes. He didn't go shopping again until after
&gt;he got off his crutches.

&gt;You know, if he had been a total jerk, deliberately getting in people's
&gt;way and carelessly wasting other's time, I could see (if not accept)
&gt;their meaness. But he was trying hard to stay out of other shoppers'
&gt;way. After witnessing that little jaunt, I have come to think many
&gt;people seek out opportunities to get away with hurting others without
&gt;penalty.

"/> Perhaps you should be a bit more rude, as it tends to
discourage them. They also should be able to distinguish
between &quot;shopping&quot; and a &quot;social event&quot;.

Personally, I don't find it that annoying if on or more
don't actually get into a conversation and block access to
the shelves.

If someone doesn't seem to know exactly what they want, then
perhaps you should consider doing them a favor. Perhaps
they don't really understand the difference between &quot;smooth&quot;
and &quot;chunky&quot; peanut butter?

If you see them hesitating before the varieties of peanut
butter, then you can point at the brands of smooth peanut
butter, pronounce the words, spell them out if necessary,
and rub your hands together to indicate a smooth, handcream,
consistency.

If you want to indicate &quot;chunky&quot; peanut butter, the above
sign, then crossed index fingers to indicate &quot;plus&quot; then
small separation between the thumb and index finger to
indicate the &quot;chunk&quot; size.

However, it is usually easier just to reach over their cart,
grab what you want and give them a hard stare for daring to
waste your time.

Alternatively, you can just go on to the next item on your
list and come back to the location later.

However, this is a very minor complaint. If they have
children, then you can complain even more.

Of course, the ultimate complaint is for the Caine [Uh,
fellow American; old lady] at the checkout who insists on
searching through her purse for the &quot;exact amount of the
purchase&quot; in an apparently deliberate obsessive/compulsive
attempt to delay other shoppers rather than tending a note
large enough to cover the cost and letting the clerk provide
the appropriate change.

There are more annoying types, though. Those who question
the amount on an item and hold up the line while someone is
summoned to check the price. Or those who insist on writing
personal checks to cover a purchase rather than producing a
credit or debit card.

I would think that intelligent retailers would direct such
weird people to a slow checkout lane or at least provide
enough checkout people to handle the delays.

As have said before, I have abandoned one or two cartloads
of purchases and walked out rather than put up with such
delays.

As long as customers put up with such crap, that is what we
should expect.

What I want to see is customer scanning on most lanes. Any
store which doesn't trust me to scan my own items I don't
want to do business with.

"/> I would personally entirely disagree. Any mature adult in a
supermarket should know what they want and where to find it.

IMHO, the only excuse for even speaking to another shopper
is to ask advice on what to buy or where to find it, and in
those cases better to decide what you want before you get
there or ask a store employee.

IMHO, there is absolutely no excuse to block aisles for
_any_ sort of social contact.

Do that after you get out of the checkout and in the general
area of the shopping center or in the parking lot.

Children are a damned nuisance as well, don't inflict them
on others.

Dogs and cats on a leash would be much more acceptable. At
least they are usually well behaved and quiet.

&gt;much ranting snippage

&gt;IMO it's not just the grocery store ... people everywhere are extremely rude
&gt;these days. You let people out of a driveway or lot and they can't even
&gt;wave a simple &quot;thanks&quot; to you. You say &quot;excuse me&quot; nicely to somebody in
&gt;the store so maybe they'll step aside and let you pass since they are in
&gt;your way and they don't move, at all, not one inch. I usually throw a &quot;or
&gt;not&quot; in as I'm squeezing by. People drive like total assholes, in a huge
&gt;rush to get out onto the road they cut you off, then proceed to do less than
&gt;the speed limit (and there's nobody behind you for miles, so it's not like
&gt;they *had* to take the opening when they saw it). What else? Oh yes,
&gt;people don't hold doors anymore, they let them whack the person behind them
&gt;rather than being courteous. The left lane of the highway is for higher
&gt;speed drivers, move out of the way for chrissake if somebody comes up behind
&gt;you ... especially on a two lane road. Right lane for driving, left lane
&gt;for passing, very simple people and, IMO I don't think you should drive in
&gt;the right lane of a 3+ lane highway unless you're getting on or off.

"/> Yes, would have to agree with most of your post, perhaps all

"/> You seem to be wise beyond your years, oh Catty One! Which
group do you mainly post on?

Are you childfree? If so, you might want to post on this
group, but be prepared to be savaged if some of them don't
trust you.

In my experience, new posters of any sex or gender are
distrusted whether they are childfree or not.

Your sex and gender may be repeatedly questioned.

If you have any children, or are responsible for any, you
will probably be distrusted if not actually hated.

The same will probably apply if you are religious,
especially Christian, especially a Bible Believing
Christian.

Please don't mistake this group for an actual &quot;support&quot;
group, as even they don't claim this.

shelf space to put your purse, wallet, loyalty card and credit card

charge slip steady while you try to sign it with one hand because you're
holding your bag of groceries and the aforementioned stuff in the other.

&gt;&gt; So which orange soda has caffeine?

&gt; I tried to read the label, but some guy clipped me with
&gt; his grocery cart called me names, scooped up 12
&gt; two-liter bottles of Jolt, a case of Redbull and left
&gt; me writhing in the isle with a broken ankle.

&gt; the real answer is -- and you won't believe it, but
&gt; try to guess... &lt;http://tinyurl.com/4j2oo&gt; (a google
&gt; link, masked to keep the surprise).

"/> You're right; that would have _never_ been on my list to suspect
caffeine infusion. Sort of explains why the kids in Daughter-unit
Alpha's class pound the stuff down.

soothes the soul from the abrasiveness around me There is a lot of charm
here in the North East, I love it and wouldn't change it for the world ...
it's very strange how different areas of the country act different in their
daily lives.

I work with sales persons all over this county and there are certain areas
where I enjoy talking w/people and certain areas where I find the sales
people to be downright rude. If I ever have a job where I'm talking with
people in TX or the anywhere in the south, it's a joy (lots of thank you and
yes m'am, no m'am, etc.) -- if it's NYC or Long Island, ugh, it's a chore,

"/> Our local supermarket is not on the net, but offers free
delivery. Can go in and tell them what you want, phone in
an order, leave a list, or whatever.

If buy in bulk we even get better prices.
I suspect that the main reason supermarkets charge for
delivery is simply because too many people would abuse the
service, expecting to have one or two items delivered.

Supermarket markups are pretty low, and they have to try to
keep costs to a minimum.

If really want to save money on shopping, of course, buy in
bulk from food wholesalers, not supermarkets. Small shops
that are not part of retail chains have to buy their food
somewhere, and there are wholesalers who supply them.

Most are willing to sell direct to consumers if they buy in
case lots and are willing to pay cash &amp; sales taxes if
applicable.

For people who really want to save money, it is often
worthwhile to form groups so that can shop in bulk.

Not only talking of buying canned goods in case lots, but
sugar, flour, rice, etc. in, say, 100 lb bags. Cost per
pound is much cheaper than in smaller packs.

To avoid arguments, of course, it is best if everyone pays
in advance for what they want, and members of the group can
take turns actually doing the shopping.

Another point:

In Australia, almost all food is marked with a &quot;use by&quot;
date. As this approaches, even for canned goods,
supermarkets discount the lines to move them before the
expiry date. When items are actually past the use by date
they are very heavily discounted. I have bought canned
imported items normally selling for, say, $2.50 a can for 5
cents a can, which would be less than the cost of the metal
can!

In actual fact, most canned items will last for years, far
past the &quot;use by&quot; date.

Usually these items are taken off the shelf and dumped in a
&quot;bargain bin&quot; somewhere.

Now if one had a group organised, it might be worthwhile to
have a group member authorized to check the bargain bins
daily and buy the lot. If the group is large enough,
someone will want it no matter what it is.

&gt;I can't pick out the quality of produce doing that,

"/> Large supermarkets, especially chains, are encouraging
online shopping as allows them to balance their staff
workload far better. One of the largest problems for
supermarkets is staff utilization. Customer flow is not
really that predictable.

If don't have enough staff on hand to meet peak checkout
demand then people get annoyed at having to wait to long and
abandon trolleys full of food and go elsewhere.

At least I do this. I am only willing to wait a few minutes
to check out. If the store cannot provide enough staff to
meet this demand, or provide self-checkout services, then I
will simply abandon one or more cartloads of food and go to
some store that can provide swift service.

One of my pet peeves are people who search for exact change
to pay for any purchase, especially when they take longer
than a few seconds to provide it. To me, this is
obsessive/compulsive behaviour and slows up service. Far
easier for all concerned to pay cash and accept change or
use a credit/debit card.

If I was running a supermarket, I would make people using
personal checks go through a separate checkout. Why should
I wait while someone finds their checkbook, writes a stub,
then the check, then wait while the store verifies it?

As supermarkets know of these problems, it pays them to
introduce online shopping. When staff aren't required on
checkouts or stocking shelves, they can be filling online
orders.

Now, in order to get people to use online shopping, the
store has to provide excellent produce. If start sending
out substandard stuff, such as unripe or bruised fruit or
vegetables, then fussy people won't use the service.

Therefore, if the supermarket manager is smart, he has the
finest produce set aside for filling online orders to get
people to use the service. The &quot;second grade&quot; stuff is
offered to the public.

This makes sense in more ways than one, of course. Have you
noticed that mothers with babies and small children can
spend several minutes pawing over fruit and vegetables on
display? How do you know she has washed her hands since
changing a diaper or wiping some kids ass?

I much prefer buying pre-packaged vegetables or ordering
online.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In addition, if I need
&gt;something in the next 20 minutes, you still have to go to the store.

"/> To me, this would indicate lack of pre-planning. Even from
an emergency standpoint, everyone should have at least two
weeks supply of food and water on hand, and this is very
conservative.

If do this, you will never &quot;run out&quot; of anything or need
anything on &quot;20 minutes&quot; notice.

Yes, I know people who don't plan ahead, but I don't
understand them. Some people are always running out of
gasoline [petrol] in their vehicle.

IMHO, zero excuse for this, actually. It is just as easy to
keep the tank full as nearly empty. All that is required is
that refill every time the gauge drops to 3/4 full. Simple,
eh?

Why are automotive road services memberships expensive?
Because of the selfish or stupid idiots who are always
running out of fuel, lock themselves out of their vehicles,
don't bother to maintain the vehicles, etc.

After all, if belong to a road service organization such as
AAA, NRMA, RACV, etc, why bother to replace a defective
battery when can call road services every morning when
cannot get the car started?

&gt;What we usually do is order the bulk of our groceries online, then
&gt;twice a month or so hit Whole Foods (in the winter) or a produce stand
&gt;(in the summer) for produce. It's a quick trip because the store is
&gt;much smaller, so it's easy to get in and out fast.

&gt;&gt; or perhaps get
&gt;&gt; other ideas for what to eat by browsing.

&gt;I do that sometimes, but often I find I end up making too many impulse
&gt;purchases that way.

"/> I tend to do that, but one way to avoid it is never to go
shopping when you actually want something to eat. If most
people had a full meal before shopping, they would find that
they do much less impulse buying.

When the blood sugar is a bit low, the subconscious mind
keeps telling you that you had better buy anything that
looks acceptable at the moment. :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Online shopping is good in that you can't easily
&gt;impulse shop. The temptations just aren't there. Once you have your
&gt;lists created, it's a breeze and takes just minutes to order. That
&gt;alone - avoidance of impulse purchases - justifies the additional
&gt;delivery expense for me.

"/> Sounds reasonable to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; In addition, if I need
&gt;&gt; something in the next 20 minutes, you still have to go to the store.

&gt;I like to pre-plan so I never need anything in the next 20 minutes.
&gt;Although on occasion if I find I'm missing something, my DF will stop
&gt;off on his way home from work. Since he commutes by bike, it limits by
&gt;necessity the amount he can shop for, so he's in and out.

&gt;But he's strange because he actually *likes* grocery shopping! Go
&gt;figure.

"/> Hmm, I enjoy grocery shopping, looking for new items, sale
items, etc. and often impulse buy.

My wife gets very annoyed at me for this. We can both shop
from the same list, but she can be in and out of a
supermarket in ten minutes, rushing through and only
grabbing the list items.

I prefer a more leisurely journey. I will come back with
the listed items, but also other items such as &quot;sale items&quot;,
&quot;new products&quot; and so on.

We very seldom shop together as it leads to too many
arguments.

So your husband may not be as strange as you think. :-)

Actually, it might be an interesting psychological study to
do a survey and find out how many males actually enjoy
shopping more than their wives.

Of course, women are often more practical than men, but most
married people know this. Although not all will admit it.

Posting from alt.support.childfree, so please contact me
here as I don't follow the other groups.

At the moment, am pretty involved in trying to drag some
members of the 20th century group &quot;alt.support.childfree&quot;
kicking and screaming into the 21st century.

Very difficult when some of them want to start flamewars by
insulting me by apparently refusing to believe that I am
male by both sex and gender and have been married to a
female in both sex and gender for a few decades.

Am currently waiting to find out why this group seems to be
the only group that I have encountered on the net where the
members make such highly offensive sex and gender insults.

For a group that claims to reject children, some of them are
extremely childish.

So far, I have no acceptable responses. Anyone on
misc.consumers,misc.consumers.frugal-living, have any ideas?

Do people on your groups accuse you of being of a sex or
gender which you are not?

Actually, I suspect that I will eventually have to go to
professional psychology or psychiatric groups to get
meaningful answers.

&gt;I see more rudeness and nasty behavior during the weekly trip to the

&gt;road. Why are people so nasty at the supermarket???

&gt;Yesterday I nearly lost it. After the usual attacks and getting run
&gt;down by shopping carts being driven by aggressive, power mad insane
&gt;shoppers I stood there ready to scream. What nearly sent me over the
&gt;edge was this fat breeder cunt driving her little brat mobile
&gt;recklessly, nearly running everyone down. You know those shopping
&gt;carts with the little kiddie cab thing built into them. She was
&gt;speeding into and out of every corner of the store, expecting everyone
&gt;to move out of her way so she and her drooling one year old could do
&gt;their shopping, it's more important than everyone else's.

&gt;Then come the office workers doing their shopping during lunch hour in
&gt;their power suits and high heels running everyone down cuz they gotta
&gt;get back to the office.

&gt;I won't even go into the 40 and 50 year old women wearing sports bras
&gt;and spandex shorts bending over in front of every guy that walks by.
&gt;So subtle. Sheesh!

&gt;Somewhere along the line someone decided that social rules and
&gt;courtesy and respect were going to be forbidden when shopping at the
&gt;grocery store and forgot to tell me!

&gt;Why are people so damn rude at the grocery store???

Excessive worry about diet can be far more harmful than what

Gospel of Matthew.

Mat 6:25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your
life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for
your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than
meat, and the body than raiment?

Mat 6:26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not,
neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your
heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than
they?

Mat 6:27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit
unto his stature?

Mat 6:28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the
lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither
do they spin:

Mat 6:29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all
his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

Mat 6:30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the
field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven,
[shall he] not much more [clothe] you, O ye of little faith?

Mat 6:31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we
eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be
clothed?

Mat 6:32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:)
for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all
these things.

Mat 6:33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his
righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.

Mat 6:34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the
morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.
Sufficient unto the day [is] the evil thereof.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;What if you have four supermarkets you can choose from? Are they all
&gt;identically designed and stocked? Does Albertsons have a better deal
&gt;on FCOJ than Pricechopper?

"/> Nope, as none of the chains mentioned are in Australia.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;you don't know, do you?

"/> Well I certainly don't, nor do I care.

However, from a rational and logical point of view, some
supermarkets might be marginally cheaper than others, and if
they are all equal distance from you, this could be a
factor.

However, smart shoppers realize how competitive the various
chains are, and understand the concept of &quot;loss leaders&quot;.

In case any of you don't know, &quot;loss leaders&quot; are items sold
at or below cost merely to lure customers into the store in
the hopes that they will buy something else or even buy
there in the future.

So, for example, a store might offer a popular soft drink at
well below cost.

They will probably have a big display of cartons of the
product, mostly open and hard to handle into a shopping
trolley.

So what does the smart shopper do when confronted with this
challenge?

Unless there is a maximum purchase limit, and this is of
doubtful legality in Australia, what one does is to politely
ask an employee if it is possible to purchase several cases
of the product and pick it up from the warehouse loading
dock on the way out.

If they say that they are not authorized to arrange this,
then the simple solution is to assemble a few trolleys, then
deconstruct the display, stacking the open cartons in the
aisle, until one reaches the unopened cartons which can be
stacked in the trolleys.

Usually only one such demonstration is required until the
supermarket agrees to the more reasonable request to collect
unopened cartons from the loading dock of the warehouse.

Suppose there is a sign indicating any limits on maximum
purchases.

Read it carefully. Often it will say something like &quot;retail
sales only&quot; If you are a genuine retail customer and not a
small shop owner who is trying to take advantage of the
sale, then demand that they sell to you at the advertised
price or threaten to complain to the relevant government
authority!

If they are breaking the law, which they often are, it will
be cheaper for them to provide you with all the product you
want rather than be reported for illegal trading and try to
fight the government in a court case.

"/> Are you sure that you are qualified to choose? Tuna is
tuna, and any brand should have very similar nutritional
results. Any variation is likely to be due to analytical
errors.

However, I will point out that all protein sources consist
of amino acids, and those requiring the least conversion are
the most effecient. Therefore, from a purely scientific
point of view, cannabilism is the best source of protein as
it requires the least conversion.

By extension, any mammalian meat requires less conversion
than piscean conversion, or meat from a fish.

In recent years, there has been a lot of concern that the
meat from mammals, such as dolphins can end up in cans of
tuna.

From a logical and scientific point of view, this mammalian
meat would be more easily assimiliated than fish protein
from Tuna.

&gt;&gt;I can't pick out the quality of produce doing that,

&gt; Large supermarkets, especially chains, are encouraging
&gt; online shopping as allows them to balance their staff
&gt; workload far better. One of the largest problems for
&gt; supermarkets is staff utilization. Customer flow is not
&gt; really that predictable.

&gt; If don't have enough staff on hand to meet peak checkout
&gt; demand then people get annoyed at having to wait to long and
&gt; abandon trolleys full of food and go elsewhere.

&gt; At least I do this. I am only willing to wait a few minutes
&gt; to check out. If the store cannot provide enough staff to
&gt; meet this demand, or provide self-checkout services, then I
&gt; will simply abandon one or more cartloads of food and go to
&gt; some store that can provide swift service.

&gt; One of my pet peeves are people who search for exact change
&gt; to pay for any purchase, especially when they take longer
&gt; than a few seconds to provide it. To me, this is
&gt; obsessive/compulsive behaviour and slows up service. Far
&gt; easier for all concerned to pay cash and accept change or
&gt; use a credit/debit card.

&gt; If I was running a supermarket, I would make people using
&gt; personal checks go through a separate checkout. Why should
&gt; I wait while someone finds their checkbook, writes a stub,
&gt; then the check, then wait while the store verifies it?

&gt; As supermarkets know of these problems, it pays them to
&gt; introduce online shopping. When staff aren't required on
&gt; checkouts or stocking shelves, they can be filling online
&gt; orders.

&gt; Now, in order to get people to use online shopping, the
&gt; store has to provide excellent produce. If start sending
&gt; out substandard stuff, such as unripe or bruised fruit or
&gt; vegetables, then fussy people won't use the service.

&gt; Therefore, if the supermarket manager is smart, he has the
&gt; finest produce set aside for filling online orders to get
&gt; people to use the service. The &quot;second grade&quot; stuff is
&gt; offered to the public.

&gt; This makes sense in more ways than one, of course. Have you
&gt; noticed that mothers with babies and small children can
&gt; spend several minutes pawing over fruit and vegetables on
&gt; display? How do you know she has washed her hands since
&gt; changing a diaper or wiping some kids ass?

&gt; I much prefer buying pre-packaged vegetables or ordering
&gt; online.

&gt;&gt; or perhaps get
&gt;&gt;other ideas for what to eat by browsing.

&gt; Yes, well, that is a valid point. However, this is often
&gt; age related. By thirty or forty you should have a pretty
&gt; good idea what you and your husband [and/or children] like
&gt; to eat.

&gt;&gt; In addition, if I need
&gt;&gt;something in the next 20 minutes, you still have to go to the store.

&gt; To me, this would indicate lack of pre-planning. Even from
&gt; an emergency standpoint, everyone should have at least two
&gt; weeks supply of food and water on hand, and this is very
&gt; conservative.

&gt; If do this, you will never &quot;run out&quot; of anything or need
&gt; anything on &quot;20 minutes&quot; notice.

&gt; Yes, I know people who don't plan ahead, but I don't
&gt; understand them. Some people are always running out of
&gt; gasoline [petrol] in their vehicle.

&gt; IMHO, zero excuse for this, actually. It is just as easy to
&gt; keep the tank full as nearly empty. All that is required is
&gt; that refill every time the gauge drops to 3/4 full. Simple,
&gt; eh?

&gt; Why are automotive road services memberships expensive?
&gt; Because of the selfish or stupid idiots who are always
&gt; running out of fuel, lock themselves out of their vehicles,
&gt; don't bother to maintain the vehicles, etc.

&gt; After all, if belong to a road service organization such as
&gt; AAA, NRMA, RACV, etc, why bother to replace a defective
&gt; battery when can call road services every morning when
&gt; cannot get the car started?

&gt;Ah, this is one of my favorites. You have to understand where this
&gt;comes from. It all started with the women's magazines back in the
&gt;feminist heyday of the 70s and early 80s. There were all these
&gt;articles telling women that if they were over thirty and single their
&gt;train had left the station and there was a greater chance of being hit
&gt;by lightning than finding a man to marry them and impregnate them.
&gt;They gave all sorts of off the wall advice to women who had put the
&gt;careers first and their biological clocks were ticking so loud they
&gt;were suffering from hearing loss to dress provocatively and throw
&gt;themselves at men in public places. Two favorite ones were the gym
&gt;and the grocery store. Designing Women had a hilarious episode on
&gt;this. Ever since then the grocery store is considered a major
&gt;cruising park for busy successful people (read: desperate lonely
&gt;middle aged single people) whose battle gear seems to be bright
&gt;spandex that strategically calls attention to their reproductive
&gt;zones.

&gt;I can't pick out the quality of produce doing that, or perhaps get

"/> Hey, you're bitching about people not just shopping, and you want to
browse around squeezing vegetables and doing &quot;menu planning.&quot;
WTF?
Anyway, here's my tip. Been doing it for years. (I admit my wife does
most of the shopping, but I go with her or make my own foray on
occasion.)
If you can fit what you're buying in a basket, don't use a cart.
If you use a cart, toss a couple items in it and park it in a light
or no traffic area where 3 or 4 carts can fit abreast so it's not
blocking anybody . By the stacks of soda, for instance.
If there's ten feet of the same stuff, nobody has to move your cart.
Unless they JUST HAVE TO HAVE that six-pack behind it, because
all the other IDENTICAL six-packs AREN'T behind it. Not saying that
has happened to me, but it wouldn't surprise me.
Then just hoof it to what you want, and bring it back to your cart.
You can find a few of these dead areas to park in as you go through
the store, usually at the end of an aisle.
If you don't have to jockey a cart around, you'll find hardly any
impediment to getting around, and keep the blood pressure down.
Another thing I do is if I see an aisle blockage - or one shaping up -
I shop a different aisle, then come back to the blocked one later.
One thing that always pissed me off about shopping low-traffic times
is that any time saved by the lack of aisle blockers was lost by lack
of cashiers and resultant long checkout lines(line).

Well I hate kids anyplace. They are loud, rude, sniveling, carry
disease and stare at you.
So I just shop at Gelsons'. Bristol Farms and any other store that is
very upscale and really expensive. Places where you find Champagne on
end displays just down from the good ole fish eggs and not chicken
eggs.
Unually the breeder cunts can't afford to shop there and we can find
blissfull

&gt;&gt;&gt;I can't pick out the quality of produce doing that,

&gt;&gt; Large supermarkets, especially chains, are encouraging
&gt;&gt; online shopping as allows them to balance their staff
&gt;&gt; workload far better. One of the largest problems for
&gt;&gt; supermarkets is staff utilization. Customer flow is not
&gt;&gt; really that predictable.

&gt;&gt; If don't have enough staff on hand to meet peak checkout
&gt;&gt; demand then people get annoyed at having to wait to long and
&gt;&gt; abandon trolleys full of food and go elsewhere.

&gt;&gt; At least I do this. I am only willing to wait a few minutes
&gt;&gt; to check out. If the store cannot provide enough staff to
&gt;&gt; meet this demand, or provide self-checkout services, then I
&gt;&gt; will simply abandon one or more cartloads of food and go to
&gt;&gt; some store that can provide swift service.

&gt;&gt; One of my pet peeves are people who search for exact change
&gt;&gt; to pay for any purchase, especially when they take longer
&gt;&gt; than a few seconds to provide it. To me, this is
&gt;&gt; obsessive/compulsive behaviour and slows up service. Far
&gt;&gt; easier for all concerned to pay cash and accept change or
&gt;&gt; use a credit/debit card.

&gt;&gt; If I was running a supermarket, I would make people using
&gt;&gt; personal checks go through a separate checkout. Why should
&gt;&gt; I wait while someone finds their checkbook, writes a stub,
&gt;&gt; then the check, then wait while the store verifies it?

&gt;&gt; As supermarkets know of these problems, it pays them to
&gt;&gt; introduce online shopping. When staff aren't required on
&gt;&gt; checkouts or stocking shelves, they can be filling online
&gt;&gt; orders.

&gt;&gt; Now, in order to get people to use online shopping, the
&gt;&gt; store has to provide excellent produce. If start sending
&gt;&gt; out substandard stuff, such as unripe or bruised fruit or
&gt;&gt; vegetables, then fussy people won't use the service.

&gt;&gt; Therefore, if the supermarket manager is smart, he has the
&gt;&gt; finest produce set aside for filling online orders to get
&gt;&gt; people to use the service. The &quot;second grade&quot; stuff is
&gt;&gt; offered to the public.

&gt;&gt; This makes sense in more ways than one, of course. Have you
&gt;&gt; noticed that mothers with babies and small children can
&gt;&gt; spend several minutes pawing over fruit and vegetables on
&gt;&gt; display? How do you know she has washed her hands since
&gt;&gt; changing a diaper or wiping some kids ass?

&gt;&gt; I much prefer buying pre-packaged vegetables or ordering
&gt;&gt; online.

&gt;&gt;&gt; or perhaps get
&gt;&gt;&gt;other ideas for what to eat by browsing.

&gt;&gt; Yes, well, that is a valid point. However, this is often
&gt;&gt; age related. By thirty or forty you should have a pretty
&gt;&gt; good idea what you and your husband [and/or children] like
&gt;&gt; to eat.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In addition, if I need
&gt;&gt;&gt;something in the next 20 minutes, you still have to go to the store.

&gt;&gt; To me, this would indicate lack of pre-planning. Even from
&gt;&gt; an emergency standpoint, everyone should have at least two
&gt;&gt; weeks supply of food and water on hand, and this is very
&gt;&gt; conservative.

&gt;&gt; If do this, you will never &quot;run out&quot; of anything or need
&gt;&gt; anything on &quot;20 minutes&quot; notice.

&gt;&gt; Yes, I know people who don't plan ahead, but I don't
&gt;&gt; understand them. Some people are always running out of
&gt;&gt; gasoline [petrol] in their vehicle.

&gt;&gt; IMHO, zero excuse for this, actually. It is just as easy to
&gt;&gt; keep the tank full as nearly empty. All that is required is
&gt;&gt; that refill every time the gauge drops to 3/4 full. Simple,
&gt;&gt; eh?

&gt;&gt; Why are automotive road services memberships expensive?
&gt;&gt; Because of the selfish or stupid idiots who are always
&gt;&gt; running out of fuel, lock themselves out of their vehicles,
&gt;&gt; don't bother to maintain the vehicles, etc.

&gt;&gt; After all, if belong to a road service organization such as

Alt.support.childfree really needs more people such as

&gt;Mine is $4 a month, added to my cell phone bill. I consider that cheap,
&gt;since it includes free towing. I've never used it for fuel or locking
&gt;myself out, but did use it once for a jump start when I forgot &amp; left
&gt;the lights on one foggy morning. And road service is an option, not a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What if a shopper is trying to comparison shop? Can you compare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ml/dollar vs. oz./dollar vs. Gallon/cent as fast as you can reach for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;can? No?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Exactly, comparison shopping does take a little more time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What about label checking. Do you want to buy mixed canned fruit with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;HFCS? How many grams of fat in that can of chili? etc x10000000.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Label checking is a necessity and it also takes time. I buy very few
&gt;&gt;&gt;canned foods but do check the labels of those like tuna to be sure I get
&gt;&gt;&gt;the best nutrition for my money.

&gt;&gt; Are you sure that you are qualified to choose? Tuna is
&gt;&gt; tuna, and any brand should have very similar nutritional
&gt;&gt; results. Any variation is likely to be due to analytical
&gt;&gt; errors.

&gt;Oh, I don't know. Let's see, looking at my credentials, yes I am more
&gt;than qualified to choose. I am more than capable of deciphering
&gt;nutritional labels too. Talk about multi talents :)

"/> Ok, where do you wish to start?

&gt;&gt; However, I will point out that all protein sources consist
&gt;&gt; of amino acids, and those requiring the least conversion are
&gt;&gt; the most effecient. Therefore, from a purely scientific
&gt;&gt; point of view, cannabilism is the best source of protein as
&gt;&gt; it requires the least conversion.

&gt;&gt; By extension, any mammalian meat requires less conversion
&gt;&gt; than piscean conversion, or meat from a fish.

&gt;&gt; In recent years, there has been a lot of concern that the
&gt;&gt; meat from mammals, such as dolphins can end up in cans of
&gt;&gt; tuna.

&gt;&gt; From a logical and scientific point of view, this mammalian
&gt;&gt; meat would be more easily assimiliated than fish protein
&gt;&gt; from Tuna.

&gt;&gt; I assure you that this is true. Want to challenge me on it?

&gt;Nah, I think I would more than out rank you on qualifications ;)
&gt;Besides, I find your tactics rather childish at the moment. Perhaps
&gt;someone else will take the bait.

WRT supermarket rudeness, I've witnessed tons of that but occasionally
either been the beneficiary of or the provider of kindness. The kindness
generally seems to come from the older generation though.

One thing I can't stand though is the inability to use basic technology
- I note the card swipes seem to represent the biggest problem for many
people though it is mostly the poor programming on the things that leads
to it.

As I get older I notice my patience with regard to rudeness seems to
wear thinner and thinner.

"/> I think this it the rot of the entire problem. People these days are
so into themselves that they are oblivious to the rest of the world
around them:

The social shoppers who talk blocking the aisle. Would it be that
hard to stroll while having your conversation to a more wide open
place? Or you could be aware of people trying to quickly shop and try
to stay out of the way.

The NASCAR shoppers who run everyone down. You can shop efficiently
without running people over. Just watch where you are going.

The people paying with a check. While waiting in line, get out your
checkbook, fill in the name of the store, endorse the check, and then
you will be ready when the total is there. Or many stores will print
all of this information on the check for you. All you do is sign and
they run it through the machine and adds all of the required info.

If shoppers were aware of what others were doing around them (even
partially), we might all be able to shop in harmony.

Now to the rest of the world:

If you are driving in any other lane than the far right, you should be
passing. Even if you are driving 10 MPH over the speed limit does not
mean you should be in the left lane. Many states actually have laws
stating that you should be in the right lane except when passing. For
everyone here in Florida, THE CENTER LANE IS NOT THE RIGHT LANE. Why
does everyone want to be in the center lane when on a 3 lane
interstate? It slows everyone down.

When you are at a stoplight in the left turn lane, start going when
the car in front of you goes. It seems like every day, I see some
oblivious person stopped while everyone inf front of hime has gone.
Of course, this driver doesn't see this as a problem since when he
realizes that there is an empty lane in front of him, he goes. Of
course, when he is 10 feet from the stop light, the light turns yellow
and he cruises through screwing everyone behind him.

When you are at the coffee shop, determine what you would like while
waiting to order. Why wait to read the menu until you need to place
your order? I guess this is why I don't ever go to those places.

If you are going to pick up lunch for the entire office, do not use
the drive through (drive thru in our illiterat society). Ther are
others that are in the drive through because they are in a hurry.

If you must use the drive through as mentioned above, get one total
price onle. Don't waste everyone's time paying $4.35 separately 15
times.

If you stop to talk to someone on the sidewalk, move to the side so
others can pass. This relates to shoppers as mentioned above.

In essence, be aware of the rest of the world around you. Despite
what you may believe, you are not as important than you think.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I can't pick out the quality of produce doing that,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Large supermarkets, especially chains, are encouraging

&gt;&gt;&gt; If don't have enough staff on hand to meet peak checkout
&gt;&gt;&gt; demand then people get annoyed at having to wait to long and
&gt;&gt;&gt; abandon trolleys full of food and go elsewhere.

&gt;&gt;&gt; At least I do this. I am only willing to wait a few minutes
&gt;&gt;&gt; to check out. If the store cannot provide enough staff to
&gt;&gt;&gt; meet this demand, or provide self-checkout services, then I
&gt;&gt;&gt; will simply abandon one or more cartloads of food and go to
&gt;&gt;&gt; some store that can provide swift service.

&gt;&gt;&gt; One of my pet peeves are people who search for exact change
&gt;&gt;&gt; to pay for any purchase, especially when they take longer
&gt;&gt;&gt; than a few seconds to provide it. To me, this is
&gt;&gt;&gt; obsessive/compulsive behaviour and slows up service. Far
&gt;&gt;&gt; easier for all concerned to pay cash and accept change or
&gt;&gt;&gt; use a credit/debit card.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If I was running a supermarket, I would make people using
&gt;&gt;&gt; personal checks go through a separate checkout. Why should
&gt;&gt;&gt; I wait while someone finds their checkbook, writes a stub,
&gt;&gt;&gt; then the check, then wait while the store verifies it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; As supermarkets know of these problems, it pays them to
&gt;&gt;&gt; introduce online shopping. When staff aren't required on
&gt;&gt;&gt; checkouts or stocking shelves, they can be filling online
&gt;&gt;&gt; orders.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, in order to get people to use online shopping, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; store has to provide excellent produce. If start sending
&gt;&gt;&gt; out substandard stuff, such as unripe or bruised fruit or
&gt;&gt;&gt; vegetables, then fussy people won't use the service.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore, if the supermarket manager is smart, he has the
&gt;&gt;&gt; finest produce set aside for filling online orders to get
&gt;&gt;&gt; people to use the service. The &quot;second grade&quot; stuff is
&gt;&gt;&gt; offered to the public.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This makes sense in more ways than one, of course. Have you
&gt;&gt;&gt; noticed that mothers with babies and small children can
&gt;&gt;&gt; spend several minutes pawing over fruit and vegetables on
&gt;&gt;&gt; display? How do you know she has washed her hands since
&gt;&gt;&gt; changing a diaper or wiping some kids ass?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I much prefer buying pre-packaged vegetables or ordering
&gt;&gt;&gt; online.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or perhaps get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other ideas for what to eat by browsing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, well, that is a valid point. However, this is often
&gt;&gt;&gt; age related. By thirty or forty you should have a pretty
&gt;&gt;&gt; good idea what you and your husband [and/or children] like
&gt;&gt;&gt; to eat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In addition, if I need
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;something in the next 20 minutes, you still have to go to the store.

&gt;&gt;&gt; To me, this would indicate lack of pre-planning. Even from
&gt;&gt;&gt; an emergency standpoint, everyone should have at least two
&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks supply of food and water on hand, and this is very
&gt;&gt;&gt; conservative.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If do this, you will never &quot;run out&quot; of anything or need
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything on &quot;20 minutes&quot; notice.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I know people who don't plan ahead, but I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; understand them. Some people are always running out of
&gt;&gt;&gt; gasoline [petrol] in their vehicle.

&gt;&gt;&gt; IMHO, zero excuse for this, actually. It is just as easy to
&gt;&gt;&gt; keep the tank full as nearly empty. All that is required is
&gt;&gt;&gt; that refill every time the gauge drops to 3/4 full. Simple,
&gt;&gt;&gt; eh?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why are automotive road services memberships expensive?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Because of the selfish or stupid idiots who are always
&gt;&gt;&gt; running out of fuel, lock themselves out of their vehicles,
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't bother to maintain the vehicles, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt; After all, if belong to a road service organization such as
&gt;&gt;&gt; AAA, NRMA, RACV, etc, why bother to replace a defective
&gt;&gt;&gt; battery when can call road services every morning when

&gt;&gt;Mine is $4 a month, added to my cell phone bill. I consider that cheap,
&gt;&gt;since it includes free towing. I've never used it for fuel or locking
&gt;&gt;myself out, but did use it once for a jump start when I forgot &amp; left
&gt;&gt;the lights on one foggy morning. And road service is an option, not a
&gt;&gt;requirement.

&gt; Out of curiosity, what would it cost you for full road
&gt; service?

&gt;&gt;&gt; After all, if belong to a road service organization such as
&gt;&gt;&gt; AAA, NRMA, RACV, etc, why bother to replace a defective
&gt;&gt;&gt; battery when can call road services every morning when

&gt;&gt;I wouldn't want to have to rely on that, when they will be out in &quot;15
&gt;&gt;mins to an hour&quot; and I have to be at work on time.

&gt; If most people were honest and only accessed the service
&gt; when they really required it, service would be a lot faster.

"/> Dunno. Given that the number of monkeys in cars on duty at

&gt;&gt;I see more rudeness and nasty behavior during the weekly trip to the
&gt;&gt; grocery store than just about anywhere else, except perhaps on the
&gt;&gt; road. Why are people so nasty at the supermarket???

&gt;much ranting snippage

&gt;IMO it's not just the grocery store ... people everywhere are extremely rude
&gt;these days. You let people out of a driveway or lot and they can't even
&gt;wave a simple &quot;thanks&quot; to you. You say &quot;excuse me&quot; nicely to somebody in
&gt;the store so maybe they'll step aside and let you pass since they are in
&gt;your way and they don't move, at all, not one inch. I usually throw a &quot;or
&gt;not&quot; in as I'm squeezing by. People drive like total assholes, in a huge
&gt;rush to get out onto the road they cut you off, then proceed to do less than
&gt;the speed limit (and there's nobody behind you for miles, so it's not like
&gt;they *had* to take the opening when they saw it). What else? Oh yes,
&gt;people don't hold doors anymore, they let them whack the person behind them
&gt;rather than being courteous. The left lane of the highway is for higher
&gt;speed drivers, move out of the way for chrissake if somebody comes up behind
&gt;you ... especially on a two lane road. Right lane for driving, left lane
&gt;for passing, very simple people and, IMO I don't think you should drive in
&gt;the right lane of a 3+ lane highway unless you're getting on or off.

&gt;It's not everybody and it's not one age group - it's a mix. I think that
&gt;people in general just don't care about other people in general any more.
&gt;They just don't give a shit and it's pretty sad. I've done my good deeds to
&gt;help people out who look like they need it, I enjoy being helpful, but when
&gt;I don't get a simple 'thank you' it pisses me off.

&gt;Humanity is going downhill and that's a big part of why I choose not to
&gt;contribute to population explosion by having kids of my own.

"/> During the course of my working years I lived in various parts of the

My take on the rudeness level is that it reflects the population
density of the area. More densely populated, more rudeness. Less
densely populated, more politeness courtesy and friendliness.

In the Bay Area the customers at Trader Joes have special niche.
For those who do not know this chain carries many quality gourmet
items at grocery store prices. You can get an idea of their variety at
traderjoes.com
Anyway, one way that they keep prices down is by having narrow aisles
allowing them top carry more inventory.It is hard enough to pass through
when 1 cart is ahead of you but, for some reason, some shopper decide to
place their carts sideways while yakking on the phone (these people seem
unable to make a shopping list and have to phone home every few minutes
for advice). I simply say &quot;excuse me&quot; once and if I am ignored I slide
the cart down the aisle. One time a lady said in her phone &quot;you won't
believe what is happening to me&quot;.
Once i was behind a couple at the checkstand, each having their own
conversation. After everything had been tallied they both kept on
talking. I said&quot; excuse me, some of us have places to go&quot;. The lady said
to her caller &quot;Whoops, i will call you back, the natives are getting
restless.

A separate rant goes to those at any store who wait until everything
has been rung up and then start fumbling for their checkbook and start
writing the check. These are the same people who, after they finish at
ATM transaction, stay at the machine to add the transaction to their
records.

part of the transaction. They fumble with the purse, fumble with their wallet,
eventually find where they hid their money. Then they have to get out their
change purse and search around for the correct change. Given the choice between
equal length check out lines I will go to the one where there are men, because

&gt; Ah, this is one of my favorites. You have to understand where this
&gt; comes from. It all started with the women's magazines back in the
&gt; feminist heyday of the 70s and early 80s. There were all these
&gt; articles telling women that if they were over thirty and single their
&gt; train had left the station and there was a greater chance of being hit
&gt; by lightning than finding a man to marry them and impregnate them.
&gt; They gave all sorts of off the wall advice to women who had put the
&gt; careers first and their biological clocks were ticking so loud they
&gt; were suffering from hearing loss to dress provocatively and throw
&gt; themselves at men in public places. Two favorite ones were the gym
&gt; and the grocery store. Designing Women had a hilarious episode on
&gt; this. Ever since then the grocery store is considered a major
&gt; cruising park for busy successful people (read: desperate lonely
&gt; middle aged single people) whose battle gear seems to be bright
&gt; spandex that strategically calls attention to their reproductive
&gt; zones.

temperament(you know who you are) is similar to what you write here,
you are probably getting what you deserve. Reflecting what you put out

Have a nice day at the supermarket. (and guys, button up your shirts,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do what I do: shop online and have your groceries delivered. It's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;worth
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the few extra bucks because it saves you the stress and also saves a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of time. The delivery guy even brings the groceries in for me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I can't pick out the quality of produce doing that,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Large supermarkets, especially chains, are encouraging
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; online shopping as allows them to balance their staff
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; workload far better. One of the largest problems for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; supermarkets is staff utilization. Customer flow is not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really that predictable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If don't have enough staff on hand to meet peak checkout
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; demand then people get annoyed at having to wait to long and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abandon trolleys full of food and go elsewhere.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At least I do this. I am only willing to wait a few minutes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to check out. If the store cannot provide enough staff to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meet this demand, or provide self-checkout services, then I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will simply abandon one or more cartloads of food and go to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some store that can provide swift service.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One of my pet peeves are people who search for exact change
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to pay for any purchase, especially when they take longer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than a few seconds to provide it. To me, this is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obsessive/compulsive behaviour and slows up service. Far
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; easier for all concerned to pay cash and accept change or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use a credit/debit card.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I was running a supermarket, I would make people using
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; personal checks go through a separate checkout. Why should
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wait while someone finds their checkbook, writes a stub,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then the check, then wait while the store verifies it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As supermarkets know of these problems, it pays them to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; introduce online shopping. When staff aren't required on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; checkouts or stocking shelves, they can be filling online
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; orders.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, in order to get people to use online shopping, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; store has to provide excellent produce. If start sending
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out substandard stuff, such as unripe or bruised fruit or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vegetables, then fussy people won't use the service.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore, if the supermarket manager is smart, he has the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; finest produce set aside for filling online orders to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people to use the service. The &quot;second grade&quot; stuff is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; offered to the public.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This makes sense in more ways than one, of course. Have you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; noticed that mothers with babies and small children can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spend several minutes pawing over fruit and vegetables on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; display? How do you know she has washed her hands since
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; changing a diaper or wiping some kids ass?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I much prefer buying pre-packaged vegetables or ordering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; online.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or perhaps get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other ideas for what to eat by browsing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, well, that is a valid point. However, this is often
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; age related. By thirty or forty you should have a pretty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good idea what you and your husband [and/or children] like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to eat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In addition, if I need
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;something in the next 20 minutes, you still have to go to the store.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To me, this would indicate lack of pre-planning. Even from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an emergency standpoint, everyone should have at least two
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks supply of food and water on hand, and this is very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conservative.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If do this, you will never &quot;run out&quot; of anything or need
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything on &quot;20 minutes&quot; notice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I know people who don't plan ahead, but I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understand them. Some people are always running out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gasoline [petrol] in their vehicle.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IMHO, zero excuse for this, actually. It is just as easy to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keep the tank full as nearly empty. All that is required is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that refill every time the gauge drops to 3/4 full. Simple,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eh?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why are automotive road services memberships expensive?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because of the selfish or stupid idiots who are always
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; running out of fuel, lock themselves out of their vehicles,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don't bother to maintain the vehicles, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After all, if belong to a road service organization such as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AAA, NRMA, RACV, etc, why bother to replace a defective
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; battery when can call road services every morning when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cannot get the car started?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [An American in Australia]

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Posting from and contactable on alt.support.childfree, as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don't follow the other groups.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In passing, I have been told that &quot;crossposting&quot; from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alt.support.childfree is &quot;discouraged&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know if this is true or not, but I certainly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wouldn't agree to follow such an obviously stupid custom.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What the hell are they afraid of?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Some just hate it, like with top posting.

&gt;&gt;&gt;No rational reason with either of them.

&gt;&gt; OK, a rational and reasonable response!
&gt;&gt; Alt.support.childfree really needs more people such as yourself.

&gt;&gt; Without realistic input, they are likely to end up like the
&gt;&gt;&quot;flat earth&quot; believers or those who believe in
&gt;&gt;&quot;extraterrestrial UFO aliens&quot;.

&gt;Dunno, we do see the non technical newsgroups that
&gt;do tend to develop into a particular mentality over time
&gt;and its just about impossible to change that sort of thing.

&gt;Bit like pubs and clubs tend to do that too.

"/> Unfortunately, I would have to agree with you.:-)

However, isn't it strange that most Americans on this group
seem to be unrealistic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Note their hysterical rejection of anyone who
&gt;&gt; will not play their childish &quot;delurking&quot; games.

&gt;&gt; Have been waiting for someone else to comment on this, but
&gt;&gt; perhaps everyone is waiting for them to swim deeper in their shit.

&gt;Its more likely that those that dont like the 'style'
&gt;of a particular group have chosen to ignore it.

"/> Yes, that sounds reasonable enough, if one considers
ignorance and insults as merely a &quot;style&quot;. I don't,
though.

This group, &quot;alt.support.childfree&quot; is an open international
usenet group.

Therefore, they have a certain implied responsibility to be
reasonably civil to others who wish to post on the group.

There is no precedent for a small group of selfish Americans
to pretend to &quot;own&quot; a segment of usenet.

They can, of course, form a moderated group if they wish,
but if they have an open usenet group then they have to
accept postings from anyone who wishes to post.

As have said before, I meet their posted &quot;rules&quot; by being
childfree. Am even an American. Yet I was ordered off by
&quot;Caine&quot;, who is, apparently, an American female.

Don't get me wrong. Most American females are OK. Caine
seems to be an exception, or at least this is the way she
comes across on usenet.

No unmoderated usenet group that claims to be a &quot;support&quot;
group should ever be judgmental. IMHO, none ever have the
&quot;right&quot; to ever order anyone away, for any reason.

As Caine has ordered me off the group from my very first
post, I feel an obligation to warn others who may be tempted
to post here.

Caine has used a quote from Jason that the group is a &quot;shark
tank&quot;. Having spent a few months on it I would definitely
agree that this is exactly what it seems to be.

Supposedly, any childfree American is welcome, but I wasn't
welcomed.

I was ordered off the group by Caine. Since then I have
been accused of being a female, in sex and gender, and there
is hardly any greater insult.

It not only insults me, but my wife, and we have been
married for over 30 years.

I see no possible reason why I should have to put up with
such crap from anyone on Usenet.

They even have the nerve to attack me for being a Christian
and believing in the Bible.

This may not be important to you, Rod, but it is extremely
important to me, and may be important to other Christians
on the crosspost groups.

Thanks for your reply.

If anyone wants to contact me, please do so through
alt.support.childfree as I don't normally provide an email
address.

When dealing with hate groups, this really isn't advisable,
and &quot;alt.support.childfree&quot; certainly strikes me as a &quot;hate&quot;
group!

If anyone on other groups doubts this, they only have to
follow it for a few weeks. :-)

Especially after this post! :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;Mine is $4 a month, added to my cell phone bill. I consider that cheap,
&gt;&gt;&gt;since it includes free towing. I've never used it for fuel or locking
&gt;&gt;&gt;myself out, but did use it once for a jump start when I forgot &amp; left
&gt;&gt;&gt;the lights on one foggy morning. And road service is an option, not a
&gt;&gt;&gt;requirement.

&gt;&gt; Out of curiosity, what would it cost you for full road
&gt;&gt; service?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After all, if belong to a road service organization such as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AAA, NRMA, RACV, etc, why bother to replace a defective
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; battery when can call road services every morning when

&gt;&gt;&gt;I wouldn't want to have to rely on that, when they will be out in &quot;15
&gt;&gt;&gt;mins to an hour&quot; and I have to be at work on time.

&gt;&gt; If most people were honest and only accessed the service
&gt;&gt; when they really required it, service would be a lot faster.

&gt;Dunno. Given that the number of monkeys in cars on duty at
&gt;a particular time is varied by the organisation, that isnt likely.
&gt;The main effect would be that costs would go down.

&gt;Its just another example of a situation where there
&gt;is no real way to encourage sensible behaviour.

"/> Totally agree with your post! It is a pity that most

doesn't seem to be when they insult people. Therefore, as a
responsible human being I feel that I have to stay on the
group to warn others away from it.

Bible believing Christians are especially unwelcome.

If anyone wants proof of how I have been treated on this
group, I don't mind posting proof of what others have said
about me.

Some of them are too ashamed to allow their posts to be
archived on Google, but I have records of all their posts
including full headers and I don't mind revealing their

&gt;&gt;Well, there's the problem right there. You're just standing there,

&gt;&gt;the hell out of the way, or shop at 4am when nobody is in the store.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then come the office workers doing their shopping during lunch hour
&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt; their power suits and high heels running everyone down cuz they gotta
&gt;&gt;&gt; get back to the office.

&gt;&gt;Yah, some of us still work for a living and have limited time do get
&gt;&gt;shit done during our lunch hour.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why are people so damn rude at the grocery store???

&gt;&gt;I'm guessing you're a left lane blocker on the freeway as well. You
&gt;&gt;know, you're not the only one who has to shop. If you want to stand
&gt;&gt;around and pick your nose, go to a borders, get a coffee, and relax.
&gt;&gt;If you want to shop, then shop.

&gt;After seeing the large number of replies to this thread I figured I
&gt;would add my Pet Peeve at the supermarket.

&gt;That concerns the freezer cases with the see through glass fronts.
&gt;Obviously they were designed to allow the patron to view the contents
&gt;and then when seeing the item they want to buy, open the freezer door,
&gt;take it out and move on. Not all see it that way. They want to open
&gt;the freezer door and then survey the contents. This results in the
&gt;glass on the door fogging over and then the next person MUST open the
&gt;glass fronted door in order to view the selections.

&gt;Now Why The Hell Do They Do That??

&gt;Old_Timer

"/> Very interesting question, and must admit have wondered
about this myself. Possibly beause am a fellow &quot;old timer&quot;
:-)

I can only think of four possible reasons offhand:

1/ They don't realize what the glass doors are for.

2/ They have a compulsion to actually handle a product
before they purchase it.

3/ They have no concept of refrigeration.

4/ They are ignorant and stupid.

Can anyone else come up with any logical reason for their
behaviour?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I see more rudeness and nasty behavior during the weekly trip to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; grocery store than just about anywhere else, except perhaps on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; road. Why are people so nasty at the supermarket???

&gt;&gt;much ranting snippage

&gt;&gt;IMO it's not just the grocery store ... people everywhere are extremely rude
&gt;&gt;these days. You let people out of a driveway or lot and they can't even
&gt;&gt;wave a simple &quot;thanks&quot; to you. You say &quot;excuse me&quot; nicely to somebody in
&gt;&gt;the store so maybe they'll step aside and let you pass since they are in
&gt;&gt;your way and they don't move, at all, not one inch. I usually throw a &quot;or
&gt;&gt;not&quot; in as I'm squeezing by. People drive like total assholes, in a huge
&gt;&gt;rush to get out onto the road they cut you off, then proceed to do less than
&gt;&gt;the speed limit (and there's nobody behind you for miles, so it's not like
&gt;&gt;they *had* to take the opening when they saw it). What else? Oh yes,
&gt;&gt;people don't hold doors anymore, they let them whack the person behind them
&gt;&gt;rather than being courteous. The left lane of the highway is for higher
&gt;&gt;speed drivers, move out of the way for chrissake if somebody comes up behind
&gt;&gt;you ... especially on a two lane road. Right lane for driving, left lane
&gt;&gt;for passing, very simple people and, IMO I don't think you should drive in
&gt;&gt;the right lane of a 3+ lane highway unless you're getting on or off.

&gt;&gt;It's not everybody and it's not one age group - it's a mix. I think that
&gt;&gt;people in general just don't care about other people in general any more.
&gt;&gt;They just don't give a shit and it's pretty sad. I've done my good deeds to
&gt;&gt;help people out who look like they need it, I enjoy being helpful, but when
&gt;&gt;I don't get a simple 'thank you' it pisses me off.

&gt;&gt;Humanity is going downhill and that's a big part of why I choose not to
&gt;&gt;contribute to population explosion by having kids of my own.

&gt;&gt;~Catty One~

&gt;During the course of my working years I lived in various parts of the
&gt;U.S. , some small towns, some medium sized cities, and some large
&gt;metropolitan areas.

&gt;My take on the rudeness level is that it reflects the population
&gt;density of the area. More densely populated, more rudeness. Less
&gt;densely populated, more politeness courtesy and friendliness.

&gt;Old_Timer

"/> Would agree totally!

I don't know just why this should be so, but one possibility
is that in small towns everyone knows everyone else, or at
least can identify them with a bit of questioning.

In large cities, people are not directly traceable so they
feel free to reveal their passive/aggressive personalities
by being deliberate assholes.

Easy to see this on usenet, of course. On this group,
[alt.support.childfree] many people seem to be deliberate
assholes, insulting others by questioning their sex and
gender.

However, as have stated before, they might not be the
deliberate assholes they seem to be on usenet. Perhaps they
are just inadequate personalities.

Hmm, one wonders if social interaction would improve in
supermarkets if all customers had to wear a name tag
providing name,address, phone number and so on.

On a slightly deeper level, perhaps some people prefer to
shop in supermarkets because it allows them to be &quot;anonymous
assholes&quot; and express their hostility to other human beings?

Perhaps they cannot get away with it at work or home, so
they take there psychopathic hostility on others at
supermarkets, on internet groups, or whatever?

From a psychological point of view, why should people with
different views hate one another?

I am a childfree American and a conservative Protestant
Bible-believing Christian.

Yet I don't &quot;hate&quot; people who choose to have children. I
just don't want them myself.

I don't &quot;hate&quot; non-Americans. I don't &quot;hate&quot;
non-Christians. I don't even &quot;hate&quot; Roman Catholics, or
atheists, or Satanists.

Yet many people on alt.support.childfree seem to hate me for
some unknown reason, as many of them keep insulting me and
my wife.

Can you,or anyone on your group, offer any insight on this?
I must admit that it puzzles me!

Everyone has a right to their own opinion, and anyone on an
open usenet group should be willing to accept comment and
criticism.

If not, they should go to a moderated group, or an email
exchange group and not bother human beings.

I don't mind &quot;childfree&quot; groups, as my wife and I are both
&quot;childfree&quot; by choice.

However, I definitely _do_ mind neo-Nazi hate groups,
especially when they pretend to be &quot;support&quot; groups.

Do I have any proof that &quot;alt.support.childfree&quot; is a hate
group?

Enough to convince me: When I made my first post to the
group I was ordered off it by Caine.

Later there were many insults relating to my sex and gender,
as well as my religion.

I can provide proof on all of the above by quoting their
posts, if anyone is curious.

&quot;nilkids&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do what I do: shop online and have your groceries delivered. It's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;worth
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the few extra bucks because it saves you the stress and also saves a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of time. The delivery guy even brings the groceries in for me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I can't pick out the quality of produce doing that,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Large supermarkets, especially chains, are encouraging
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; online shopping as allows them to balance their staff
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; workload far better. One of the largest problems for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; supermarkets is staff utilization. Customer flow is not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really that predictable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If don't have enough staff on hand to meet peak checkout
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; demand then people get annoyed at having to wait to long and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abandon trolleys full of food and go elsewhere.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At least I do this. I am only willing to wait a few minutes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to check out. If the store cannot provide enough staff to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meet this demand, or provide self-checkout services, then I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will simply abandon one or more cartloads of food and go to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some store that can provide swift service.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One of my pet peeves are people who search for exact change
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to pay for any purchase, especially when they take longer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than a few seconds to provide it. To me, this is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obsessive/compulsive behaviour and slows up service. Far
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; easier for all concerned to pay cash and accept change or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use a credit/debit card.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I was running a supermarket, I would make people using
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; personal checks go through a separate checkout. Why should
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wait while someone finds their checkbook, writes a stub,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then the check, then wait while the store verifies it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As supermarkets know of these problems, it pays them to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; introduce online shopping. When staff aren't required on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; checkouts or stocking shelves, they can be filling online
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; orders.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, in order to get people to use online shopping, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; store has to provide excellent produce. If start sending
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out substandard stuff, such as unripe or bruised fruit or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vegetables, then fussy people won't use the service.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore, if the supermarket manager is smart, he has the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; finest produce set aside for filling online orders to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people to use the service. The &quot;second grade&quot; stuff is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; offered to the public.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This makes sense in more ways than one, of course. Have you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; noticed that mothers with babies and small children can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spend several minutes pawing over fruit and vegetables on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; display? How do you know she has washed her hands since
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; changing a diaper or wiping some kids ass?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I much prefer buying pre-packaged vegetables or ordering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; online.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or perhaps get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other ideas for what to eat by browsing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, well, that is a valid point. However, this is often
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; age related. By thirty or forty you should have a pretty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good idea what you and your husband [and/or children] like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to eat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In addition, if I need
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;something in the next 20 minutes, you still have to go to the store.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To me, this would indicate lack of pre-planning. Even from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an emergency standpoint, everyone should have at least two
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks supply of food and water on hand, and this is very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conservative.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If do this, you will never &quot;run out&quot; of anything or need
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything on &quot;20 minutes&quot; notice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I know people who don't plan ahead, but I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understand them. Some people are always running out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gasoline [petrol] in their vehicle.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IMHO, zero excuse for this, actually. It is just as easy to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keep the tank full as nearly empty. All that is required is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that refill every time the gauge drops to 3/4 full. Simple,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eh?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why are automotive road services memberships expensive?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because of the selfish or stupid idiots who are always
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; running out of fuel, lock themselves out of their vehicles,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don't bother to maintain the vehicles, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After all, if belong to a road service organization such as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AAA, NRMA, RACV, etc, why bother to replace a defective
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; battery when can call road services every morning when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cannot get the car started?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yep, seen it all. Don't know where you live but here in Southern

&gt;&gt;&gt; times I'd see some fool blocking up an entire aisle with his or her
&gt;&gt;&gt; shopping cart parked sideways while they blurted into their cell phone

&gt;&gt;&gt; of a friend of a friend of a friend of Brad Pitt or Jennifer Anniston
&gt;&gt;&gt; or whoever. And don't even get me started on the porn stars at the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ralphs.

&gt;&gt; It's not much different here. I used to get ticked off at the old ladies
&gt;&gt; behind me in line at the cashier who keep shoving their carts into my
&gt;&gt; ankles. Once I can understand, but when the same old bird hits you three
&gt;&gt; or four times? Then there are the people behind you who start putting their
&gt;&gt; goods on the conveyer before you have your cart unloaded. A few months ago
&gt;&gt; it happened to me. I said something to the guy and he started getting
&gt;&gt; mouthy. The last time it happened I put up down one of those little
&gt;&gt; dividers, but she kept doing it. I just swept it back to make room for more
&gt;&gt; of myself. I misjudged and knocked a bunch of her stuff on the ground.

&gt;Rudeness in supermarkets is just reflective of what you see in everyday
&gt;life. For example, today I'm walking and this brood just comes at me
&gt;without moving to my left, etc. And there are the rude ass parents
&gt;laughing and talking about something.

&gt;WRT supermarket rudeness, I've witnessed tons of that but occasionally
&gt;either been the beneficiary of or the provider of kindness. The kindness
&gt;generally seems to come from the older generation though.

Perhaps you can understand why I am so insulted when some
people on alt.support.childfree continue to insult me by
mistaking my sex and gender.

There are _only_ two possibilities.

One is that those who insult me are suffering from terminal
stupidity, as I have informed them of the truth.

The other is that they are deliberately insulting me and my
wife.

No one on the alt.support.childfree group has explained why
I should be insulted in this way.

So I will ask anyone on the crosspost groups.

if there is no acceptable reply, I will, of course, take the
issue much further.

The internet is a great resource, if there weren't so many
Jasons on it. Oops, I didn't mean to say &quot;Jasons&quot;, I
intended to say &quot;assholes&quot;.

Oh well, they are reasonably equivalent, are they not? Or
should I quote some of his posts?

In an earlier post, I suggested that I could name my
selections for the five most unpleasant American women on
usenet.

However, on reflection, where do I put someone such as
&quot;Jason&quot; who is of indeterminate gender?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, there's the problem right there. You're just standing there,
&gt;&gt;&gt;blocking everybody else who is trying to get this shopping done. Get
&gt;&gt;&gt;the hell out of the way, or shop at 4am when nobody is in the store.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then come the office workers doing their shopping during lunch hour
&gt;&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their power suits and high heels running everyone down cuz they gotta
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get back to the office.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yah, some of us still work for a living and have limited time do get
&gt;&gt;&gt;shit done during our lunch hour.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why are people so damn rude at the grocery store???

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm guessing you're a left lane blocker on the freeway as well. You
&gt;&gt;&gt;know, you're not the only one who has to shop. If you want to stand
&gt;&gt;&gt;around and pick your nose, go to a borders, get a coffee, and relax.
&gt;&gt;&gt;If you want to shop, then shop.

&gt;&gt;After seeing the large number of replies to this thread I figured I
&gt;&gt;would add my Pet Peeve at the supermarket.

&gt;&gt;That concerns the freezer cases with the see through glass fronts.
&gt;&gt;Obviously they were designed to allow the patron to view the contents
&gt;&gt;and then when seeing the item they want to buy, open the freezer door,
&gt;&gt;take it out and move on. Not all see it that way. They want to open
&gt;&gt;the freezer door and then survey the contents. This results in the
&gt;&gt;glass on the door fogging over and then the next person MUST open the
&gt;&gt;glass fronted door in order to view the selections.

&gt;&gt;Now Why The Hell Do They Do That??

&gt;&gt;Old_Timer

&gt; Very interesting question, and must admit have wondered
&gt; about this myself. Possibly beause am a fellow &quot;old timer&quot;
&gt; :-)

&gt; I can only think of four possible reasons offhand:

&gt; 1/ They don't realize what the glass doors are for.

&gt; 2/ They have a compulsion to actually handle a product
&gt; before they purchase it.

&gt; 3/ They have no concept of refrigeration.

&gt; 4/ They are ignorant and stupid.

&gt; Can anyone else come up with any logical reason for their
&gt; behaviour?

"/> There isnt one. 4 is the most common reason.

&gt;I am not sure if it is always rudeness or just plain thoughtlessness. My wife
&gt;used to think I was paranoid in malls until I pointed out my observations. When
&gt;there is a narrow gap in an aisle and there is a woman standing off to the side,
&gt;chances are she will suddenly step in front of me, perhaps do a spin around and
&gt;block the only gap just long enough that I have to stop. Then she steps back. No
&gt;matter how long I see them standing there, I just know that they are going to
&gt;step in front of me, and most of the time they do. It's not particularly rude or
&gt;aggressive. They don't even look. They just do it.

&gt;I'd be happy if some of them could handle the old technology, opening up their

&gt;behind a woman at the checkout counter while their groceries are being rung up.
&gt;Then when the cashier tells they seemed stunned when it comes time to do their
&gt;part of the transaction. They fumble with the purse, fumble with their wallet,
&gt;eventually find where they hid their money. Then they have to get out their

&gt;I'm with your there. I have a special dislike for groups of people walking in my

&gt;I think this it the rot of the entire problem. People these days are
&gt;so into themselves that they are oblivious to the rest of the world
&gt;around them:

&gt;The social shoppers who talk blocking the aisle. Would it be that
&gt;hard to stroll while having your conversation to a more wide open
&gt;place? Or you could be aware of people trying to quickly shop and try
&gt;to stay out of the way.

"/> Perhaps the phrase you are searching for is &quot;selfish
inconsiderate assholes&quot;?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;The NASCAR shoppers who run everyone down. You can shop efficiently
&gt;without running people over. Just watch where you are going.

"/> True, as long as the others actually shop, and don't try to
talk to one another or have to manage their wild children.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;The people paying with a check. While waiting in line, get out your
&gt;checkbook, fill in the name of the store, endorse the check, and then
&gt;you will be ready when the total is there. Or many stores will print
&gt;all of this information on the check for you. All you do is sign and
&gt;they run it through the machine and adds all of the required info.

"/> That sounds very reasonable, but have never seen anyone
actually do it!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;If shoppers were aware of what others were doing around them (even
&gt;partially), we might all be able to shop in harmony.

"/> Yes, of course, but the problem is that so many people are
extremely selfish and aggressive.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Now to the rest of the world:

&gt;If you are driving in any other lane than the far right, you should be
&gt;passing. Even if you are driving 10 MPH over the speed limit does not
&gt;mean you should be in the left lane. Many states actually have laws
&gt;stating that you should be in the right lane except when passing. For
&gt;everyone here in Florida, THE CENTER LANE IS NOT THE RIGHT LANE. Why
&gt;does everyone want to be in the center lane when on a 3 lane
&gt;interstate? It slows everyone down.

&gt;When you are at a stoplight in the left turn lane, start going when
&gt;the car in front of you goes. It seems like every day, I see some
&gt;oblivious person stopped while everyone inf front of hime has gone.
&gt;Of course, this driver doesn't see this as a problem since when he
&gt;realizes that there is an empty lane in front of him, he goes. Of
&gt;course, when he is 10 feet from the stop light, the light turns yellow
&gt;and he cruises through screwing everyone behind him.

&gt;When you are at the coffee shop, determine what you would like while
&gt;waiting to order. Why wait to read the menu until you need to place
&gt;your order? I guess this is why I don't ever go to those places.

&gt;If you are going to pick up lunch for the entire office, do not use
&gt;the drive through (drive thru in our illiterat society). Ther are
&gt;others that are in the drive through because they are in a hurry.

&gt;If you must use the drive through as mentioned above, get one total
&gt;price onle. Don't waste everyone's time paying $4.35 separately 15
&gt;times.

&gt;If you stop to talk to someone on the sidewalk, move to the side so
&gt;others can pass. This relates to shoppers as mentioned above.

&gt;In essence, be aware of the rest of the world around you. Despite
&gt;what you may believe, you are not as important than you think.

&gt; and then when seeing the item they want to buy, open the freezer door,
&gt; take it out and move on. Not all see it that way. They want to open
&gt; the freezer door and then survey the contents. This results in the

&gt; Now Why The Hell Do They Do That??

And I would bet these are the same people who do it at home. I have been

"/> One of my favorite pet peeves. If the person won't get out of line, I start
a ruckus and call the manager. The clerk should not check out the order. A
good manager will either stop the person or open another lane for the fast
checkout. If a person has say, 20 items and it is a long line, I start
counting out loud at each item is passed over the scanner to embarrass the
person. I have no problem letting the store know how I feel about it.

I got into the fast checkout line and the light was off. (busy time of day
I might add) The cashier said she was closed. I said there is no other fast
checkout open. The head cashier came over and explained that this person
was going on break. I asked where the other fast checkout was and there was
none open. I pointed out lack of planning on her part was not reason for
delay on my part. The light went back on while she got another person to
take over the station.

&gt;&gt;carts with the little kiddie cab thing built into them. She was
&gt;&gt;speeding into and out of every corner of the store, expecting everyone
&gt;&gt;to move out of her way so she and her drooling one year old could do
&gt;&gt;their shopping, it's more important than everyone else's.

&gt; Yep, seen them too. They usually have a crazed look on their faces as
&gt; they zoom by you and don't look at anyone, as if they and their
&gt; squealings are the only ones in the universe.

&gt;&gt;Then come the office workers doing their shopping during lunch hour in
&gt;&gt;their power suits and high heels running everyone down cuz they gotta
&gt;&gt;get back to the office.

&gt; Most of them are jaded neurotic single women.

&gt;&gt;I won't even go into the 40 and 50 year old women wearing sports bras
&gt;&gt;and spandex shorts bending over in front of every guy that walks by.
&gt;&gt;So subtle. Sheesh!

&gt; Ah, this is one of my favorites. You have to understand where this
&gt; comes from. It all started with the women's magazines back in the
&gt; feminist heyday of the 70s and early 80s. There were all these
&gt; articles telling women that if they were over thirty and single their
&gt; train had left the station and there was a greater chance of being hit
&gt; by lightning than finding a man to marry them and impregnate them.
&gt; They gave all sorts of off the wall advice to women who had put the
&gt; careers first and their biological clocks were ticking so loud they
&gt; were suffering from hearing loss to dress provocatively and throw
&gt; themselves at men in public places. Two favorite ones were the gym
&gt; and the grocery store. Designing Women had a hilarious episode on
&gt; this. Ever since then the grocery store is considered a major
&gt; cruising park for busy successful people (read: desperate lonely
&gt; middle aged single people) whose battle gear seems to be bright
&gt; spandex that strategically calls attention to their reproductive
&gt; zones.

&gt;&gt;Somewhere along the line someone decided that social rules and
&gt;&gt;courtesy and respect were going to be forbidden when shopping at the
&gt;&gt;grocery store and forgot to tell me!

&gt;&gt;Why are people so damn rude at the grocery store???

&gt; It's the residue of the Baby Boomer &quot;ME Generation&quot;. &quot;It's all about
&gt; me, me first, me always&quot; that kind of mentality. Nothing you can do
&gt; about it except to toughen up and learn to dish it out too. That
&gt; stuff about being nice to others might work well in Omaha and the rest
&gt; of flyover country, but if you're in the big cities on both coasts,
&gt; it's eat or be eaten, unfortunately.

"/> I've experienced many of these same abuses at the grocery store, but nothing
makes me fume like opening the glass fridge doors to pull something out and
some asshole grabs the door from me, opens it up all the way, and cuts in
front of me and sticks their paws in front of my face to grab what they
want. When confronted, they usually get extremely violent and/or obscene
and will yell something to the effect of &quot;I don't care you were already
standing there, I can grab what I want!&quot; It's happened to me four times and
all four it was women! Big, fat, ugly, rude, aggressive women. It's
interesting to observe how aggressive women get in the grocery store. By
contrast, I've never experienced any really rude or aggressive behavior from
another guy. Usually they're like me, they go with a list, are well
planned, know where everything is, get what they need, manage to get in the
appropriate line, have their payment ready when the cashier finishes ringing
up the items, puts the credit card through the reader in half a second, and
am on my way while the woman at the next line is still trying to figure out
how to write her check, something she's been doing every week for thirty
years!

&gt; feminist heyday of the 70s and early 80s. There were all these
&gt; articles telling women that if they were over thirty and single their
&gt; train had left the station and there was a greater chance of being hit
&gt; by lightning than finding a man to marry them and impregnate them.
&gt; They gave all sorts of off the wall advice to women who had put the
&gt; careers first and their biological clocks were ticking so loud they
&gt; were suffering from hearing loss to dress provocatively and throw
&gt; themselves at men in public places. Two favorite ones were the gym
&gt; and the grocery store. Designing Women had a hilarious episode on
&gt; this. Ever since then the grocery store is considered a major
&gt; cruising park for busy successful people (read: desperate lonely
&gt; middle aged single people) whose battle gear seems to be bright
&gt; spandex that strategically calls attention to their reproductive
&gt; zones.

&gt;&gt;Somewhere along the line someone decided that social rules and
&gt;&gt;courtesy and respect were going to be forbidden when shopping at the
&gt;&gt;grocery store and forgot to tell me!

&gt;&gt;Why are people so damn rude at the grocery store???

&gt; It's the residue of the Baby Boomer &quot;ME Generation&quot;. &quot;It's all about
&gt; me, me first, me always&quot; that kind of mentality. Nothing you can do
&gt; about it except to toughen up and learn to dish it out too. That
&gt; stuff about being nice to others might work well in Omaha and the rest
&gt; of flyover country, but if you're in the big cities on both coasts,
&gt; it's eat or be eaten, unfortunately.

"/> I've experienced many of these same abuses at the grocery store, but nothing
makes me fume like opening the glass fridge doors to pull something out and
some asshole grabs the door from me, opens it up all the way, and cuts in
front of me and sticks their paws in front of my face to grab what they
want. When confronted, they usually get extremely violent and/or obscene
and will yell something to the effect of &quot;I don't care you were already
standing there, I can grab what I want!&quot; It's happened to me four times and
all four it was women! Big, fat, ugly, rude, aggressive women. It's
interesting to observe how aggressive women get in the grocery store. By
contrast, I've never experienced any really rude or aggressive behavior from
another guy. Usually they're like me, they go with a list, are well
planned, know where everything is, get what they need, manage to get in the
appropriate line, have their payment ready when the cashier finishes ringing
up the items, puts the credit card through the reader in half a second, and
am on my way while the woman at the next line is still trying to figure out
how to write her check, something she's been doing every week for thirty
years!

How about the person who waits until their stuff is being rung up
and then remembers that they need one more item?
One tine I suggested that the clerk tally what had already been
purchased and then ring up a new sale (this was after a two minute wait)
when the person returned. He first said that he could not do it. I told
him that if he could not do this I would immediately leave and suggested
that others do the same. He decided that he could do it. When the
customer returned she was not happy that the world did not stop for her.

Then there are the people with a purchase totaling $18.43. Rather
than be burdened with change they will hand the clerk a 20 and then
spend some time fumbling around for 43 cents.

some dense populations manage to retain their tight social communities,

&gt; Houses in SoCal are built on postage-stamp sized lots, some as small
&gt; as 4000 square feet. Many newer developments are basically a plot of
&gt; land with the house itself taking up the entire plot except for a
&gt; walkway between the houses; the front yards share a common &quot;paseo&quot; (a
&gt; fancy word for sidewalk) and each pair of houses shares a garage. And
&gt; these houses sell for $700,000. How long before SoCal looks like New
&gt; York did in &quot;Soylent Green?&quot;

&gt; The freeways are equally jammed. People here spend hours every day in
&gt; their cars fighting gridlock. And when the weather is bad and
&gt; mudslides close the roads, forget about it. Five hours to drive 3
&gt; miles was a common rate of travel up in the north end of the Valley.
&gt; Even now I-5 is down to one or two lanes in each direction due to
&gt; storm damage - repairs are expected to take 6 months or more.

"/> Road rage arises because those on the freeway, alone in their cars, are
anonymous. One is more apt to flip the finger at someone one doesn't
know, and will probably never need to rely on in the future for a
favor.

I would hazard to say that in times past the grocery store used to be
kinda like a church - i.e., a place for locals to gather on a weekly
basis, to get their shopping done and also see and socialize with their
neighbors in the process - to build community ties. Today, with the
rise of massive supermarkets, I think grocery stores have become more
impersonal. You can shop weekly and never see anyone you know.

Or *we* have all become impersonal, because of the nature of our
anonymous, independent society, and therefore just have a lot less
patience for any community gathering place.

&gt;In theory, yes. In practice its MUCH more complicated than that.

"/> Care to elaborate? As far as I am concerned usenet is
international and operates with very few rules, aside from
relevant government laws and regulations and regulations
imposed by individual service suppliers.

If a group wants to set hard and fast rules, then they
should run a moderated group or stay off usenet altogether
and communicate by email. There are many such closed groups
that use the latter form of communication.

Either method can be used to block all dissent if desired.

"/> True, although it is becoming more closely regulated as time
passes. There is a current international effort to track
down pedophiles, and people in the US, UK, Australia who

You sound like someone who may have some background in

their very sex and gender were questioned, and/or if they

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Don't get me wrong. Most American females are
&gt;&gt; OK. Caine seems to be an exception, or at least
&gt;&gt; this is the way she comes across on usenet.

&gt;There's a couple of those in here, in mcfl

&gt;One is completely barking mad, claims all her relatives
&gt;are trying to kill her and that they have all the authoritys
&gt;in their pockets and that they are all totally corrupt.

&gt;Quite interesting to me how superficially rational even
&gt;the completely barking mad can be in many ways.

"/> In most cases, a psychotic is pretty easy to spot, as their
condition spills over to all areas of their life. For
instance, many have trouble correctly interpreting simple
proverbs such as &quot;A rolling stone gathers no moss&quot; or
&quot;People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.&quot;

However, there is a fairly unusual condition called a
&quot;compartmentalized psychosis&quot;, which means that the patient
is only psychotic in one particular area.

To make up an example, imagine a person called &quot;X&quot;. He
believes that Siamese cats are not cats at all, but Satanic
demons in disguise. This would lead &quot;X&quot; to hate and fear
all Siamese cats, and react with terror at the sight of one.
If anyone should own a Siamese, or even mention Siamese,
they would be considered to be a demon masquerading as a
human being. Naturally, he might try to kill all Siamese
cats, owners of same, etc. in what he sees as
&quot;self-defense&quot;.

Yet &quot;X&quot; might appear to be perfectly normal in all other
areas. Unfortunately, we cannot cure schizophrenia,
although it can often be controlled by medication.

If interested in this sort of thing, a google search for
compartmentalized psychosis
will provide ~644 returns

You should also check the alternative spelling of
compartmentalized psychosis
as this will may provide some different returns.

&gt;The worst of the fools in mcfl play childish games proclaiming

subnormal IQ that remain children throughout their lives.

Mobile phone coverage is unavailable in most remote areas,
and even HF and UHF citizens band is not that reliable.

Any intelligent tourist going &quot;off the beaten track&quot; rents a
HF radio and a comprehensive medical kit from the RFDS.
[Royal Flying Doctor Service] The HF operates on several
bands, which ensures communication. The tourist will be
told what medications to take out of the kit, if this is
likely to solve the problem.

If it isn't, the RFDS will fly in for a rescue.

I don't know where you are in the US, but there are a lot of
remote areas in the western half, and people still die when
they do the wrong thing.

Even in city areas there are many risks. Suppose that a
large US city has a local nuclear power plant malfunction,
or is subject to any form of terrorist attack.

How long would the unprepared person have to wait at the
average gas station? How many would even remain open? If
you were the owner of a gas station, would you remain open?
Even if you were money hungry to charge several dollars a
gallon for gasoline, there would be people who demanded it
at gunpoint.

Money does you no good if you are likely to die. If I owned
and operated a gas station, I certainly wouldn't remain
open. If everyone else is fleeing the city, perhaps they
know more than I do. :-)

Considering there is seldom an excuse for not keeping a full
fuel tank, who would do otherwise? ....Other than
incurable optimists, of course, which society could easily
do without anyway. :-)

&gt;Isn't Vaseline a really bad lube to use with condoms?

"/> Condoms are made from latex rubber, and natural rubber is
very intolerant of hydrocarbon compounds, even long chain

KY jelly or some non-petroleum based lubricant would
probably be a wiser choice.

Of course, in convention penile/vaginal sex no lubricant
should be necessary if the foreplay is adequate. :-)

There is an ancient joke that foreplay in Australia consists
of the male elbowing his partner in the ribs and saying

Obviously they have no idea how a refrigerator works. For
any readers who don't know, it is basically a heat pump
which conveys the heat from inside the box to outside the
box.

And if anyone in a developed country such as Australia, the
UK, or the US doesn't understand how a fridge works,
obviously the schools should be spending a lot more time on
basic science and technology!

I would suggest that people behave badly because they know that they'll get
NO criticism from anyone and if by chance someone does object, no one else
will publicly back them up simply by agreeing. Peer pressure would work
wonders. My suspicion is that society has changed over the last several
decades to become more self-centered and even the so called &quot;best&quot; people
will screw someone else if they have something to gain &amp; think they'll get
away with it; and they usually do get away with it which explains the repeat
bad behavior.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yep, seen it all. Don't know where you live but here in Southern
&gt;&gt;&gt;California people are too important and self-absorbed to be nice to
&gt;&gt;&gt;anyone. When I was living in West Hollywood I can't tell you how many
&gt;&gt;&gt;times I'd see some fool blocking up an entire aisle with his or her
&gt;&gt;&gt;shopping cart parked sideways while they blurted into their cell phone
&gt;&gt;&gt;that they'd been invited to the Oscars after party thanks to a friend
&gt;&gt;&gt;of a friend of a friend of a friend of Brad Pitt or Jennifer Anniston
&gt;&gt;&gt;or whoever. And don't even get me started on the porn stars at the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Ralphs.

&gt;&gt; An interesting post, and tends to confirm the aggressiveness
&gt;&gt; that I have seen on posts from alt.support.childfree

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yesterday I nearly lost it. After the usual attacks and getting run
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;down by shopping carts being driven by aggressive, power mad insane
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shoppers I stood there ready to scream. What nearly sent me over the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;edge was this fat breeder cunt driving her little brat mobile
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;recklessly, nearly running everyone down. You know those shopping
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;carts with the little kiddie cab thing built into them. She was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;speeding into and out of every corner of the store, expecting everyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to move out of her way so she and her drooling one year old could do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their shopping, it's more important than everyone else's.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yep, seen them too. They usually have a crazed look on their faces as
&gt;&gt;&gt;they zoom by you and don't look at anyone, as if they and their
&gt;&gt;&gt;squealings are the only ones in the universe.

&gt; I live in Raleigh, NC, and find that in the yuppie, upscale suburbs like
&gt; Cary you will see this extensively. Generic-looking soccer moms
&gt; monopolizing all available space as though they and their spoiled brat
spawn
&gt; are the only ones that count in this world. Then, off they go into their
&gt; gas-guzzling Yukons and Suburbans.

&gt; Some of these kids would make great poster children for Planned
Parenthood.
&gt; Not that I hate kids,I just wish more of them received some semblance of
&gt; discipline and control from their parents.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I have pet peeves with people who are on their cell phones talking loudly

&gt;&gt;WHY must they talk so loud?

&gt;This is so others do not feel lonely ......

&gt;Joel

"/> This has also puzzled me. A few years ago, when not many
people had cell phones, I always assumed that it was an ego
trip thing, like driving an expensive car or flying first
class.

However, now that most people have mobile phones, this seems
an unlikely reason.

Am sure that some psychologist or psychiatrist has suggested
a possible reason why people do it, but I haven't tried to
look it up.

It is difficult enough to understand why intellegent people
bother with such ego trips at all. They do, of course, as
otherwise there would be no such thing as &quot;fashion&quot; in
clothing.

Why, for that matter, do people drive themselves to an early
grave by trying to accumulate immense amounts of money?

What is the logical point of trying to accumulate more than
one can possibly spend in their lifetime?

It would be interesting to know how many readers of this
post would keep working if they won, say, US$ 10,000,000 in
a lottery.

Am quite sure that many would quit work and never work
another day in their life.

However, it would be interesting to check this out. Perhaps
one of the super-rich would like to check out this
hypotheses by providing a large amount of money a lucky few
from a pool of applicants? :-)

Of course, this seems a pretty unrealistic hope, so perhaps
people from these groups might be willing to tell us what
they might do with a windfall of $US10 million or even $US 5
million?

Am sure that there will be some who will claim that they
would keep right on working as if nothing had happened.

If there is anyone who would believe these claims, may I
suggest that they provide their full name, address, phone
number, etc. Many spammers would only be too pleased to get
in touch with you.

odd. The loony had taken the biblical 'teaching' that 'if thine hand
offends thee, cut it off' quite literally, with a radial arm saw.

His boss who has a VERY black sense of humor
always maintainted that they should have sewed
it back on backwards, to teach him a lesson.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now Why The Hell Do They Do That??

&gt;&gt;Because they are clueless...

&gt;&gt;And I would bet these are the same people who do it at home. I have been

&gt; However, I have heard of people leaving a refrigerator door

&gt; Obviously they have no idea how a refrigerator works. For
&gt; any readers who don't know, it is basically a heat pump
&gt; which conveys the heat from inside the box to outside the
&gt; box.

&gt; And if anyone in a developed country such as Australia, the

&gt;&gt;&gt;I can't pick out the quality of produce doing that,

&gt;&gt; Large supermarkets, especially chains, are encouraging
&gt;&gt; online shopping as allows them to balance their staff
&gt;&gt; workload far better. One of the largest problems for
&gt;&gt; supermarkets is staff utilization. Customer flow is not
&gt;&gt; really that predictable.

&gt;&gt; If don't have enough staff on hand to meet peak checkout
&gt;&gt; demand then people get annoyed at having to wait to long and
&gt;&gt; abandon trolleys full of food and go elsewhere.

&gt;&gt; At least I do this. I am only willing to wait a few minutes
&gt;&gt; to check out. If the store cannot provide enough staff to
&gt;&gt; meet this demand, or provide self-checkout services, then I
&gt;&gt; will simply abandon one or more cartloads of food and go to
&gt;&gt; some store that can provide swift service.

&gt;&gt; One of my pet peeves are people who search for exact change
&gt;&gt; to pay for any purchase, especially when they take longer
&gt;&gt; than a few seconds to provide it. To me, this is
&gt;&gt; obsessive/compulsive behaviour and slows up service. Far
&gt;&gt; easier for all concerned to pay cash and accept change or
&gt;&gt; use a credit/debit card.

&gt;&gt; If I was running a supermarket, I would make people using
&gt;&gt; personal checks go through a separate checkout. Why should
&gt;&gt; I wait while someone finds their checkbook, writes a stub,
&gt;&gt; then the check, then wait while the store verifies it?

&gt;&gt; As supermarkets know of these problems, it pays them to
&gt;&gt; introduce online shopping. When staff aren't required on
&gt;&gt; checkouts or stocking shelves, they can be filling online
&gt;&gt; orders.

&gt;&gt; Now, in order to get people to use online shopping, the
&gt;&gt; store has to provide excellent produce. If start sending
&gt;&gt; out substandard stuff, such as unripe or bruised fruit or
&gt;&gt; vegetables, then fussy people won't use the service.

&gt;&gt; Therefore, if the supermarket manager is smart, he has the
&gt;&gt; finest produce set aside for filling online orders to get
&gt;&gt; people to use the service. The &quot;second grade&quot; stuff is
&gt;&gt; offered to the public.

&gt;&gt; This makes sense in more ways than one, of course. Have you
&gt;&gt; noticed that mothers with babies and small children can
&gt;&gt; spend several minutes pawing over fruit and vegetables on
&gt;&gt; display? How do you know she has washed her hands since
&gt;&gt; changing a diaper or wiping some kids ass?

&gt;&gt; I much prefer buying pre-packaged vegetables or ordering
&gt;&gt; online.

&gt;&gt;&gt; or perhaps get
&gt;&gt;&gt;other ideas for what to eat by browsing.

&gt;&gt; Yes, well, that is a valid point. However, this is often
&gt;&gt; age related. By thirty or forty you should have a pretty
&gt;&gt; good idea what you and your husband [and/or children] like
&gt;&gt; to eat.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In addition, if I need
&gt;&gt;&gt;something in the next 20 minutes, you still have to go to the store.

&gt;&gt; To me, this would indicate lack of pre-planning. Even from
&gt;&gt; an emergency standpoint, everyone should have at least two
&gt;&gt; weeks supply of food and water on hand, and this is very
&gt;&gt; conservative.

&gt;&gt; If do this, you will never &quot;run out&quot; of anything or need
&gt;&gt; anything on &quot;20 minutes&quot; notice.

&gt;&gt; Yes, I know people who don't plan ahead, but I don't
&gt;&gt; understand them. Some people are always running out of
&gt;&gt; gasoline [petrol] in their vehicle.

&gt;&gt; IMHO, zero excuse for this, actually. It is just as easy to
&gt;&gt; keep the tank full as nearly empty. All that is required is
&gt;&gt; that refill every time the gauge drops to 3/4 full. Simple,
&gt;&gt; eh?

&gt;&gt; Why are automotive road services memberships expensive?
&gt;&gt; Because of the selfish or stupid idiots who are always
&gt;&gt; running out of fuel, lock themselves out of their vehicles,
&gt;&gt; don't bother to maintain the vehicles, etc.

&gt;&gt; After all, if belong to a road service organization such as
&gt;&gt; AAA, NRMA, RACV, etc, why bother to replace a defective
&gt;&gt; battery when can call road services every morning when
&gt;&gt; cannot get the car started?

&gt;away with it; and they usually do get away with it which explains the repeat
&gt;bad behavior.

"/> Would agree with you here, but it is also interesting to
consider why the behaviour of current generations has
deteriorated so much.

There are several possibilities. From my point of view, one
of the most obvious is decline in religious belief.

However, there are others. If we go back to the sixties in
the US we find a lot of rebellion. Some justified, some
not.

In any case, many of these rebellious people have become
parents, and many are incapable of controlling their
children.

Even President Clinton publicly admitted that he had once
&quot;tried&quot; marijuana, but then hastened to try to excuse his
breaking of drug laws with the lame excuse that &quot;he didn't
inhale&quot;.

I was a university student in sixties, and can assure anyone
on these groups that if anyone was busted for possession,
let alone use, an attempted defense claim &quot;but I didn't
inhale&quot; would have resulted is the courtroom breaking up
with helpless laughter and the judge banging his gavel
trying to restore order.

Why would _anyone_ break the law and smoke grass if they
didn't inhale? This would be directly equivalent to a
teenager drinking whiskey and insisting that he didn't
swallow!

However, the point am trying to make here is that if a
President the US has admitted to being a user of an illegal
drug, then it is obvious that many others of his generation
are equally guilty.

I am not talking here of whether there should or shouldn't
be laws, merely that some people choose to break them.

I could just as easily go back further in US history and
discuss the prohibition of alcohol by amendment XVIII.

What I want to point out is that many of the present
generation are assholes because their parents may also have
been assholes.

Since am crossposting here, am sure that some readers have
children.

Parents don't always set very good examples. If you are a
child and see daddy or mommy break the speed limit and
excuse their behaviour on the grounds that they are &quot;in a
hurry and there are no cops around&quot; what does that teach
you? ....That anything is permissible if you don't get
caught.

Or maybe you hear daddy bragging about how he cheated on his
income tax? Or on a more minor level see daddy or mommy
honk the car horn at another driver and give them the
finger? Or claim that religion is all superstition?

Great role models for the kids, eh? So why be surprised if
the kids are worse than their parents and their kids might
be worse still.

Then too, we shouldn't forget the influence of violent
movies and video games where kids gain points by running
over pedestrians.

Some people claim that movies, TV, games, etc. don't
influence children. Strange, then that so much money is
spent on advertising, no?

If anyone has any comments, I am available on
alt.support.childfree, which is the only group of those
above that I follow.

This will no doubt offend some of the people on
alt.support.childfree, but having been there for months I
can see that I am going to be hassled and gravely insulted
whatever I do or don't do.

I am still curious why alt.support.childfree is the _only_
group I have ever encountered on several years of usenet
where the members continually insist on insulting me by
refusing to believe my sex and gender.

&quot;nilkids&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yep, seen it all. Don't know where you live but here in Southern
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;California people are too important and self-absorbed to be nice to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anyone. When I was living in West Hollywood I can't tell you how many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;times I'd see some fool blocking up an entire aisle with his or her
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shopping cart parked sideways while they blurted into their cell phone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that they'd been invited to the Oscars after party thanks to a friend
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of a friend of a friend of a friend of Brad Pitt or Jennifer Anniston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or whoever. And don't even get me started on the porn stars at the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ralphs.

&gt;&gt;&gt; An interesting post, and tends to confirm the aggressiveness
&gt;&gt;&gt; that I have seen on posts from alt.support.childfree

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yesterday I nearly lost it. After the usual attacks and getting run
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;down by shopping carts being driven by aggressive, power mad insane
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shoppers I stood there ready to scream. What nearly sent me over the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;edge was this fat breeder cunt driving her little brat mobile
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;recklessly, nearly running everyone down. You know those shopping
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;carts with the little kiddie cab thing built into them. She was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;speeding into and out of every corner of the store, expecting everyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to move out of her way so she and her drooling one year old could do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their shopping, it's more important than everyone else's.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yep, seen them too. They usually have a crazed look on their faces as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they zoom by you and don't look at anyone, as if they and their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;squealings are the only ones in the universe.

&gt;&gt; I live in Raleigh, NC, and find that in the yuppie, upscale suburbs like
&gt;&gt; Cary you will see this extensively. Generic-looking soccer moms
&gt;&gt; monopolizing all available space as though they and their spoiled brat
&gt;spawn
&gt;&gt; are the only ones that count in this world. Then, off they go into their
&gt;&gt; gas-guzzling Yukons and Suburbans.

&gt;&gt; Some of these kids would make great poster children for Planned
&gt;Parenthood.
&gt;&gt; Not that I hate kids,I just wish more of them received some semblance of
&gt;&gt; discipline and control from their parents.

&gt;&gt;&gt; [An American in Australia]

&gt;&gt;&gt; Posting from and contactable on alt.support.childfree, as
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't follow the other groups.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In passing, I have been told that &quot;crossposting&quot; from
&gt;&gt;&gt; alt.support.childfree is &quot;discouraged&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know if this is true or not, but I certainly
&gt;&gt;&gt; wouldn't agree to follow such an obviously stupid custom.
&gt;&gt;&gt; What the hell are they afraid of?

&gt;&gt;Some just hate it, like with top posting.

&gt;&gt;No rational reason with either of them.

&gt; OK, a rational and reasonable response!
&gt; Alt.support.childfree really needs more people such as
&gt; yourself.

&gt; Without realistic input, they are likely to end up like the
&gt;&quot;flat earth&quot; believers or those who believe in
&gt;&quot;extraterrestrial UFO aliens&quot;.

&gt; Note their hysterical rejection of anyone who will not play
&gt; their childish &quot;delurking&quot; games.

&gt; Have been waiting for someone else to comment on this, but
&gt; perhaps everyone is waiting for them to swim deeper in their
&gt; shit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After seeing the large number of replies to this thread I figured I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would add my Pet Peeve at the supermarket.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That concerns the freezer cases with the see through glass fronts.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously they were designed to allow the patron to view the contents
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and then when seeing the item they want to buy, open the freezer door,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; take it out and move on. Not all see it that way. They want to open
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the freezer door and then survey the contents. This results in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glass on the door fogging over and then the next person MUST open the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glass fronted door in order to view the selections.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now Why The Hell Do They Do That??

&gt;&gt;&gt;Because they are clueless...

&gt;&gt;&gt;And I would bet these are the same people who do it at home. I have been
&gt;&gt;&gt;in houses where they treat the refrigerator as if it was a closet. Open
&gt;&gt;&gt;the door and stand there for 5 minutes looking or open the door and
&gt;&gt;&gt;leave it open while they are doing other tasks.

&gt;&gt; Must admit have never seen that.

&gt;&gt; However, I have heard of people leaving a refrigerator door
&gt;&gt; open in hopes of cooling off the kitchen. :-)

&gt;&gt; Obviously they have no idea how a refrigerator works. For
&gt;&gt; any readers who don't know, it is basically a heat pump
&gt;&gt; which conveys the heat from inside the box to outside the
&gt;&gt; box.

&gt;&gt; And if anyone in a developed country such as Australia, the
&gt;&gt; UK, or the US doesn't understand how a fridge works,
&gt;&gt; obviously the schools should be spending a lot more time on
&gt;&gt; basic science and technology!

&gt;I'm not convinced that its possible to teach those basics effectively.

&gt;I just smirk when someone warns me to take the batterys out
&gt;of a portable radio before opening it so I wont get electrocuted.

"/> Yes, amazing isn't it! The average non-technical or
non-scientific person seems to think that it is high voltage
that kills people.

It isn't, of course, it is the current, or amperage. As
little as 10 milliamps, through the heart, can be fatal.

The average high voltage at the plugs on even an old car
would have been 15,000 to 20,000 volts. Yet if you touch a
spark plug or a high voltage lead on an engine there isn't
much chance that you will die. Even with a dead short to
earth, between one hand and another across the chest.

However, I wouldn't suggest that anyone try it, just in
case.

So how about touching both terminals of a 12 volt car
battery? It can deliver hundreds of amps, but you won't
even feel it.

Yet under ideal conditions, people have died from 32 volt
farm lighting systems. All a matter of voltage, amperage,
and resistance.

&gt;&gt;away with it; and they usually do get away with it which explains the repeat
&gt;&gt;bad behavior.
&gt; Would agree with you here, but it is also interesting
&gt; to consider why the behaviour of current generations
&gt; has deteriorated so much.
&gt; There are several possibilities. From my point of view,
&gt; one of the most obvious is decline in religious belief.

"/> I doubt it has a damned thing to do with that if you mean
belief in some form of higher power. The percentage who

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yep, seen it all. Don't know where you live but here in Southern

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anyone. When I was living in West Hollywood I can't tell you how many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;times I'd see some fool blocking up an entire aisle with his or her
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shopping cart parked sideways while they blurted into their cell phone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that they'd been invited to the Oscars after party thanks to a friend
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of a friend of a friend of a friend of Brad Pitt or Jennifer Anniston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or whoever. And don't even get me started on the porn stars at the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ralphs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; An interesting post, and tends to confirm the aggressiveness
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that I have seen on posts from alt.support.childfree

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yesterday I nearly lost it. After the usual attacks and getting run
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;down by shopping carts being driven by aggressive, power mad insane
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shoppers I stood there ready to scream. What nearly sent me over the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;edge was this fat breeder cunt driving her little brat mobile
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;recklessly, nearly running everyone down. You know those shopping
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;carts with the little kiddie cab thing built into them. She was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;speeding into and out of every corner of the store, expecting everyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to move out of her way so she and her drooling one year old could do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their shopping, it's more important than everyone else's.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yep, seen them too. They usually have a crazed look on their faces as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they zoom by you and don't look at anyone, as if they and their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;squealings are the only ones in the universe.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I live in Raleigh, NC, and find that in the yuppie, upscale suburbs like
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cary you will see this extensively. Generic-looking soccer moms
&gt;&gt;&gt; monopolizing all available space as though they and their spoiled brat
&gt;&gt;spawn
&gt;&gt;&gt; are the only ones that count in this world. Then, off they go into their
&gt;&gt;&gt; gas-guzzling Yukons and Suburbans.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Some of these kids would make great poster children for Planned
&gt;&gt;Parenthood.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Not that I hate kids,I just wish more of them received some semblance of
&gt;&gt;&gt; discipline and control from their parents.

Just witnessed an amazing incident.

We're walking out of Nob Hill Foods here on the SF Peninsula and this woman
is in the lot in front of us near the front entrance, pulling forward and
about to turn one of the angled slots right in front of the store, a coveted
parking position here.

Another woman, who is driving an Acura SUV, suddenly reverses out of the
regular slots back into the front of the lot and directly into the path of
the woman who is slowly advancing on the slot up front. The other woman
stops abruptly but the SUV just keeps coming, oblivious. She backs right
into the front of the first woman's Volvo, and then pulls forward and parks
in the slot she was about to take.

When the first lady gets out and approaches the woman who hit her as she
emerges from her SUV, the culprit screeches epithets and tells the injured
party to take a pill, then calls her a bitch, gets a cart, and strolls on
into the store. My partner and I are standing two feet away from the
accident as it happens.

So you back into traffic abruptly, hit somebody, and then steal her parking
spot--and then call her a bitch.

Special place in hell.

I try to shop during non-peak hours (e.g. Thursday evenings after 8
p.m. or Sunday morning around 7:30 a.m.). I've found it to be much more
pleasant than shopping during the peak periods.

"/> It costs $5 extra. That's the delivery charge they tack on. The prices
are exactly the same as in the brick-and-mortar store. When the store
has a special, the online version also has the same special. They even
take coupons and you can use your store card for specials. What's more,
when shopping online, you can click a button to sort by price. It shows
a column for unit price so you can quickly compare which is really the
best deal. This is really good for me since I'm not that great at
calculating such info in my head on the spot in the store.

But you're right - my time is not worth that much. I don't really do it
for the time-savings, although that is a benefit. I started doing it
because I have a bad back and my PT told me not to carry groceries for
awhile. This way, I didn't have to. Now I continue to do it because, as
I mentioned, 1) I don't impulse shop (no temptation); 2) it forces me
to pre-plan meals more wisely and on a schedule; 3) I am more likely to
bulk shop (taking advantage of specials) because I don't get
discouraged by the notion that I'll have to lug the 20 cans of
discounted tomato sauce up three sets of stairs and into my house.

&gt;&gt; It's a just the 8 to 10 spots set aside for those with kids or
&gt;&gt; pregnant that I have problems with.

&gt; It certainly seems silly. I push-started a truck when I was 7 months
&gt; pregnant and it's really not that difficult to stuff kids into a cart
&gt; and push them to the store.

"/> Well, my kids are no longer that age, but I would like to say:

1) It's highly dangerous to put kids into a shopping cart. These things
are quite tippy, even more so when wheeled across uneven parking lot
pavement. I had a scare with my DD, when she was younger. The shopping
cart tipped over in the parking lot and she fell on her head. She was
bruised but ultimately okay, but after that I refused to put my kids in
a cart.

2) Assuming one was going to rely on a cart to transport kids from car
to store, I'd personally get nervous leaving my kids in the car while
running across the parking lot to grab a cart. Same goes for once
you've returned from the store, packed kids + groceries into the car,
then have to return the cart. It makes sense to me that the stalls
reserved for those with children happen to always be right next to the
return-cart stalls. Less abandoned carts that way.

3) Assuming one was not going to do #2, but instead rely on walking
across the lot while holding kids' hands, that also makes me nervous,
especially with young squirmy kids or more than one kid. Drivers
backing out can't see kids - they're too short.

For all these reasons, I've always assumed that the special stalls for
those with children had less to do with a courtesy and more to do with
grocery store's liability. Perhaps one too many carts tipped over or
kids got run over in the lot.

Anyway, even though my kids are preteen age now, and I couldn't use the
stalls if I wanted to, I don't mind them at all. It doesn't kill us to
walk an extra 50 feet to the store, and in fact, it's good exercise for
us.

&gt; Yes, well, that is a valid point. However, this is often

&gt; conservative.

However, I think this issue is a microcosm of the way people treat each
other in general. The slow pokes don't give a damn about anybody but
their own boring life, and they figure, hell, if they don't have
anything to do or to get home to, nobody else mustn't either.

I would bet the clueless slow pokes in the market are the same clueless
slowpokes blocking the left lane.

Strollers. I hate strollers. Women with strollers very often will
come at me and expect to have the right of way. They will also use the
strollers to nudge my legs when standing in line or waiting to get on
an elevator, etc. Some days I'm zen about it, but it's unbelievably
rude behavior.

Right now, my downstairs neighbor is playing loud music. All I can
hear is the bass, of course. It's 9:30am, by the way.

Yes, there is a lot of evidence that other people exist on the planet,
yet the rude assholes out there aren't buying into it, apparently.

&gt;&gt;It certainly seems silly. I push-started a truck when I was 7 months
&gt;&gt;pregnant and it's really not that difficult to stuff kids into a cart
&gt;&gt;and push them to the store.

&gt; Well, my kids are no longer that age, but I would like to say:

&gt; 1) It's highly dangerous to put kids into a shopping cart. These things
&gt; are quite tippy, even more so when wheeled across uneven parking lot
&gt; pavement. I had a scare with my DD, when she was younger. The shopping
&gt; cart tipped over in the parking lot and she fell on her head. She was
&gt; bruised but ultimately okay, but after that I refused to put my kids in
&gt; a cart.

"/> Wow, that is scary. I never had a problem with a cart tipping (until my
kids got to be about 5 and didn't want to ride in the cart but tried to
hang on the side or end of it. The cart tipped once, I explained to
them why we don't do that, and they stopped trying to get a free ride.)
But if the parking lot is uneven or in the midst of pothole season, it
certainly could be dangerous.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2) Assuming one was going to rely on a cart to transport kids from car

&gt; then have to return the cart. It makes sense to me that the stalls
&gt; reserved for those with children happen to always be right next to the
&gt; return-cart stalls. Less abandoned carts that way.

"/> Since I had to shop with two small children, we always went to the store
at low peak times, like mid-morning. I never had a problem finding a
parking place near the return cart bin. I would load both kids in the
cart and push it into the store. However, if was really cold weather, I
didn't put them into a cold cart that had been sitting in the parking
lot for hours. Instead, I picked up and carried the little one and had
the older one hold my hand as we walked into the store. I would never
have left them in the car while I crossed a parking lot looking for a
cart. There were some occasions when someone would be wheeling
groceries to a car just as we drove up. Seeing my situation, those
people nearly always offered me the cart when they were finished, and I
was always appreciative of their understanding.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3) Assuming one was not going to do #2, but instead rely on walking
&gt; across the lot while holding kids' hands, that also makes me nervous,
&gt; especially with young squirmy kids or more than one kid. Drivers
&gt; backing out can't see kids - they're too short.

"/> I had one basic rule. Never let go. Fortunately, my older one wasn't
the squirmy kind, but I can hold a death grip on a hand if I believe it

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; those with children had less to do with a courtesy and more to do with
&gt; grocery store's liability. Perhaps one too many carts tipped over or

"/> You're probably right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Anyway, even though my kids are preteen age now, and I couldn't use the
&gt; stalls if I wanted to, I don't mind them at all. It doesn't kill us to
&gt; walk an extra 50 feet to the store, and in fact, it's good exercise for
&gt; us.

"/> When I was pregnant, I wanted all the exercise I could get, so I never
minded walking across a parking lot. But not every pregnancy is an easy
one, so there can be a need for these special parking spaces. I don't
think anyone wants to see a woman go into labor in a parking lot.

My favorite grocery shopping experience in my days with small children,
though, was at the 24-hour Super Walmart in our city. I could wake up
at 4:00 a.m. and have the luxury of grocery shopping by myself while my
husband was still home with the kids (most of the time, they never knew
I was out). There was never anyone else in the store, and the employees
were just putting out all the fresh produce. It was a great, relaxing
time and never took very long.

For all of you who complain about a woman shopping with small children
in tow, believe me, she would have gone shopping alone if it were
possible. But if a woman is home alone with small children and the
household is out of milk, there's no alternative. I hope people were
more tolerant of your mothers than you all seem to be of the women out
shopping with their children.

&gt;&gt;the cart and pays for them. Then they put all the grocery bags into
&gt;&gt;the cart and walk out of the store together, load everything into

&gt; Been there and done that, only with teenage kids. So?

"/> It's cheating the system and you know it. the &quot;express lane&quot; is meant for
those to whisk through with a handful of items, not a family of 5 with 60
items.

The ironic thing is, not only are you holding up legitimate &quot;express&quot;
customers, but it's taking YOU longer to process 3-5 separate transactions
that it would if you had gotten in the regular checkout lane.

Congratulations on teaching your children how to disregard rules and that

&gt; My kids are only 19 months apart. There was a stage in which both
&gt; wanted to walk, and yet they were not quite old enough to do so without
&gt; me worrying they'd squirm out of my grasp. I quickly learned to wait
&gt; until the weekend when I could go shopping and leave the kids at home.
&gt; Of course, that's not always possible, like when one or both kids were
&gt; sick, and we'd have to hit the pharmacy on the way home for an Rx.
&gt; Argh. Those were the days!!

"/> I totally understand. My first two were a year and 2 days apart. Back
then, I did more grocery shopping because I did less home preserving and
bulk meat purchases. Sometimes I had no choice but to take them
shopping. For the most part though, the task of grocery shopping in an
actual grocery store was delegated to DH and it still is :) We were
lucky enough to have pharmacies that deliver free of charge. Both
deliver OTC meds, Rx, and any other item them carry. It was a real
blessing when on the rare occasion I ran out of diapers! BTW, I still
rely on the pharmacy free delivery. We live in a very small rural
village with no pharmacy but mine in town delivers here free of charge
which saves me the gas and time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Plus, my husband (now ex-h) routinely travelled Mon thru Fri. Sometimes
&gt; it was hard not to avoid a quick run to the store mid-week. I found a
&gt; good strategy was to skip the cart completely, and instead push the
&gt; kids through the store using the double stroller. I'd pick up just
&gt; enough items that could fit in the stroller basket.

"/> I preferred the stroller to a cart too both for ease and safety. We
lived close enough to a grocery store and a butcher shop so I could walk
which gave me exercise, the kids fresh air, and I got the very few
groceries I needed.

Over the years, my whole method of obtaining groceries has changed
dramatically to the point very little is purchased in an actual grocery
store. We still live within walking distance of a small Mom &amp; Pop
grocery store so I don't mind going there on the very rare occasion. DH
still does the majority of shopping at an actual grocery store. Friends
of ours owns the grocery store he shops at so occasionally I stop by to
chit chat with her but not to shop.

trip or two and do the same thing. IMO, this is maximizing your resources.

&gt; One thing I can't stand though is the inability to use basic technology
&gt; - I note the card swipes seem to represent the biggest problem for many
&gt; people though it is mostly the poor programming on the things that leads
&gt; to it.

"/> This used to peeve me as well. I'm a computer programmer and generally really
good at troubleshooting hardware problems as well, so I'm no technophobe. I
used to grit my teeth in the automated checkout line watching the people in
front of me scan their items multiple times, scan their debit cards multiple
times, and stare stupidly at the screen.

But then the more I used them, the more the machines themselves peeved me, and
the more compassion I have for the customers. Personally I like to scan my
items as fast as the machine will allow, do things efficiently and quickly. It
drives me nuts when the thing reverses the belt and tells me to re-position the
item. Or it will stop the belt and then complain that there are too many items
on it. Also it stops the whole process and insists that I bag the 4 items
already scanned before continuing. I'm convinced now that these things are
programmed to deliberately slow you down.

One time in particular, I was in line behind an older lady, maybe mid-60's who
was struggling with the machine. This was in a Giant supermarket. When she
got to the end of her transaction, the machine kept telling her to take her
receipt. She looked around and couldn't find it in the maze of computer boxes,
card-swipe and cash-entry slots and things. Just as I finally figure out where
it was, she did too, so I didn't have to help her. The receipt dispenser was
just in front of her (generally anyone's) left knee.

WTF?

Since then I've paid attention to the ergonomic setup of the thing. Typically
you stand in front of the scanner and display screen. If you hold your left
arm straight out from your body, the card swipe is near your left hand. The
cash-entry slot is next to it. The coin return and receipt dispenser is, as I
mentioned, in front of your left knee. Not only does the configuration require
you to step back and forth too much, it's also so spread out that even a techie
like me has trouble finding where things are, let alone non-techies like the
old lady. What's wrong with putting all the input-output devices next to each
other as close to (average) eye-level as possible?

When an adult walks with a child, the adult often has to bend over to

&gt;It costs $5 extra. That's the delivery charge they tack on. The prices

&gt;when shopping online, you can click a button to sort by price. It shows
&gt;a column for unit price so you can quickly compare which is really the
&gt;best deal. This is really good for me since I'm not that great at
&gt;calculating such info in my head on the spot in the store.

&gt;But you're right - my time is not worth that much. I don't really do it
&gt;for the time-savings, although that is a benefit. I started doing it
&gt;because I have a bad back and my PT told me not to carry groceries for
&gt;awhile. This way, I didn't have to. Now I continue to do it because, as
&gt;I mentioned, 1) I don't impulse shop (no temptation); 2) it forces me
&gt;to pre-plan meals more wisely and on a schedule; 3) I am more likely to

&gt;&gt;&gt;1) It's highly dangerous to put kids into a shopping cart. These

&gt; things

&gt;&gt;&gt;are quite tippy, even more so when wheeled across uneven parking

&gt; lot

&gt;&gt;&gt;pavement. I had a scare with my DD, when she was younger. The

&gt; shopping

&gt;&gt;&gt;cart tipped over in the parking lot and she fell on her head. She

&gt; was

&gt;&gt;&gt;bruised but ultimately okay, but after that I refused to put my

&gt; kids in

&gt;&gt;&gt;a cart.

&gt;&gt;Wow, that is scary. I never had a problem with a cart tipping (until

&gt; my

&gt;&gt;kids got to be about 5 and didn't want to ride in the cart but tried

&gt; to

&gt;&gt;hang on the side or end of it. The cart tipped once, I explained to
&gt;&gt;them why we don't do that, and they stopped trying to get a free

&gt; ride.)

&gt;&gt; But if the parking lot is uneven or in the midst of pothole season,

&gt; it

&gt;&gt;certainly could be dangerous.

&gt; Especially if the parent pushing the cart is petite like me. Some of
&gt; these grocery carts are enormous, and since I'm short, the leverage is
&gt; all wrong for maneuvering them when they get out of control. Easy for a
&gt; cart to start tipping if it hits a pothole, and then hard for someone
&gt; who's short to prevent it from tipping over. :-(

&gt; I personally think the carts that are designed like cars are a fabulous
&gt; invention. Very sturdy and not so tippable. I gladly get out of my way
&gt; when I see a parent pushing one down the aisle.

&gt;&gt;&gt;2) Assuming one was going to rely on a cart to transport kids from

&gt; car

&gt;&gt;&gt;to store, I'd personally get nervous leaving my kids in the car

&gt; while

&gt;&gt;&gt;running across the parking lot to grab a cart. Same goes for once
&gt;&gt;&gt;you've returned from the store, packed kids + groceries into the

&gt; car,

&gt;&gt;&gt;then have to return the cart. It makes sense to me that the stalls
&gt;&gt;&gt;reserved for those with children happen to always be right next to

&gt; the

&gt;&gt;&gt;return-cart stalls. Less abandoned carts that way.

&gt;&gt;Since I had to shop with two small children, we always went to the

&gt; store

&gt;&gt;at low peak times, like mid-morning. I never had a problem finding a

&gt;&gt;parking place near the return cart bin. I would load both kids in

&gt; the

&gt;&gt;cart and push it into the store. However, if was really cold

&gt; weather, I

&gt;&gt;didn't put them into a cold cart that had been sitting in the parking

&gt;&gt;lot for hours. Instead, I picked up and carried the little one and

&gt; had

&gt;&gt;the older one hold my hand as we walked into the store.

&gt; My kids are only 19 months apart.

"/> Wow, you're like me. Mine are 18 1/2 months apart. People would look
at me like &quot;Ooh, two in diapers?&quot; But I think it would have been even
worse to get out of the diaper stage and then get back into it. In the
two-in-the-shopping-cart-days people would frequently ask me if they
were twins. They're 12 1/2 and 14 now and the best of friends, and
enjoying living in the same &quot;world&quot; of school and activities. I'm
really glad they're that close, though I confess I don't remember a
whole lot about the first six months of the baby's life!

&gt;&gt; IMO, the policy shoud be enforced by making those particular registers
&gt;&gt; ring up no more than the stated number of items. So if someone with 20
&gt;&gt; items goes to a 12 or less aisle, the only 12 can be rung up and a total
&gt;&gt; would be required before any more could be rung up.

&gt;&gt;&quot;I'm sorry, but this register only rings up 12 items or less. There's
&gt;&gt; oting I ca do.&quot;

&gt;Let's face it. Those numbers are arbitrary. Some say 8 items or less, some
&gt;10 items or less, or 12 items or less. There are codes on everything these
&gt;days, and a few extra items is no big deal, just a matter of a few seconds
&gt;extra to pass them over the scanner. There are some things that aren't
&gt;worth fighting over, and even if you are inclined to fight, you have to pick
&gt;your battles. The stores want to come out ahead too.

"/> True, and IMHO the main problem is with customers who refuse
to follow the rules. However, there is an unresolved
question. Suppose I am in a store that has a policy of 10
items or less. I have 6 bags of potato chips at price &quot;x&quot;
and 6 x 2 litre bottles of soft drink at price &quot;y&quot;.

Should these count as 2 items or 12 items? Obviously it is
much quicker to pass an item through the scanner once to
determine the price then multiply it by 6 which is an option
on some systems. On others, can simply make multiple passes
of items over the scanner.

This probably takes less actual time than a customer with
8 or 9 separately priced items. So why cannot stores make
their policy clear?

Another annoyance: A supermarket may have a display
of a soft drink on sale, but most of the top boxes will be
opened, thus awkward to handle. If I want 5 unopened
cartons I have to half dismantle the display to get to them.

Often an employee will ask me what I am doing, and I
patiently explain why, and suggest that the display include
some unopened boxes that are easy to get at. Alternatively,
I suggest that it will save us both trouble if I can simply
pay for the product at the checkout and pick it up at the
loading dock.

So far, I haven't managed to get any store to alter their
display practice, but they have no objection to the latter
arrangement.

I don't suppose that I have to mention that when I am forced
to dismantle a display to reach unopened cartons I take my
time about it and the aisle is soon half blocked by opened
cartons. Yes, I do return the opened ones to the display,
but don't bother with artistically arranging them.

Another minor annoyance if buying one unopened case is that
the case has a separate bar code than the individual
bottles, so all that should be necessary is to scan the box
code. However, have never encountered a supermarket which
was prepared for this, and I have invariably been asked to
open the box and pull out a bottle to be scanned.

Does anyone know the reason for this, if there is any
reason?

Years ago I was once told that there was a limit of two
cases. As I grew up in the days where the customer was
always right, my response was to point out that they had not
posted a sign to this effect, and in a deliberately loud
voice demanded that the manager either sell me the five
cases without wasting my time any further or write me a
signed note that he was refusing the sale.

When he asked why, I told him that I needed it as evidence,
and that I intended to forward one copy to his corporate
headquarters and retain the other as evidence to present in
my complaint for false advertising under the trade practices
act. He wisely decided that the best course of action was
to sell me the five cases.

As a customer, one should not allow oneself to be bullied by
business people.

Incidentally, if ever have to make such a complaint to
someone's corporate headquarters, don't bother to talk to
his area manager. Write a letter to the CEO of the chain
and send it by security post with a return receipt
requested. This ensures that either the CEO or his private
secretary has to sign for it. This means he is usually
curious enough to read it, and it prevents his underlings
from concealing the complaint from him.

more of an annoyance than people using cellphones.

I suppose that one solution would be to carry a pocket tape
recorder and stand next to the offender recording their side

convince some of them to lower their voice. If people don't
want to carry actual pocket tape recorders, am sure that
some manufacturer could offer cheap imitation units.:-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've seen couples do the equivalent thing. The woman will pull 12

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the cart and pays for them. Then they put all the grocery bags into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the cart and walk out of the store together, load everything into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their car, and drive home.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't see the problem here. Is there one?

&gt;&gt;&gt; They are complying with the letter of the rule, but not the spirit.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's morally bankrupt.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As soon as that couple has kids, they'll start adding 12 additoional
&gt;&gt;&gt; items per kid to their carts in order to exploit the loophole even
&gt;&gt;&gt; further.

&gt;&gt;This is no different than when a store runs a good sale on a certain
&gt;&gt;item and limits it to 2 per customer. DH and I have taken advantage of
&gt;&gt;this by him getting his 2 separate from my 2. Since we end up with 4 of
&gt;&gt;the item rather than 2, it saves us the gas and inconvience of a second
&gt;&gt;trip. If it is something we really need a lot of we may make another
&gt;&gt;trip or two and do the same thing. IMO, this is maximizing your resources.

&gt;Unless someone else is doing it - then it's thoughtless exploitation
&gt;of the system.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do what I do: shop online and have your groceries delivered. It's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;worth
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the few extra bucks because it saves you the stress and also saves a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of time. The delivery guy even brings the groceries in for me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I can't pick out the quality of produce doing that,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Large supermarkets, especially chains, are encouraging
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; online shopping as allows them to balance their staff
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; workload far better. One of the largest problems for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; supermarkets is staff utilization. Customer flow is not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really that predictable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If don't have enough staff on hand to meet peak checkout
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; demand then people get annoyed at having to wait to long and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abandon trolleys full of food and go elsewhere.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At least I do this. I am only willing to wait a few minutes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to check out. If the store cannot provide enough staff to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meet this demand, or provide self-checkout services, then I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will simply abandon one or more cartloads of food and go to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some store that can provide swift service.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One of my pet peeves are people who search for exact change
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to pay for any purchase, especially when they take longer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than a few seconds to provide it. To me, this is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obsessive/compulsive behaviour and slows up service. Far
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; easier for all concerned to pay cash and accept change or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use a credit/debit card.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I was running a supermarket, I would make people using
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; personal checks go through a separate checkout. Why should
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wait while someone finds their checkbook, writes a stub,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then the check, then wait while the store verifies it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As supermarkets know of these problems, it pays them to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; introduce online shopping. When staff aren't required on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; checkouts or stocking shelves, they can be filling online
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; orders.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, in order to get people to use online shopping, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; store has to provide excellent produce. If start sending
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out substandard stuff, such as unripe or bruised fruit or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vegetables, then fussy people won't use the service.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore, if the supermarket manager is smart, he has the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; finest produce set aside for filling online orders to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people to use the service. The &quot;second grade&quot; stuff is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; offered to the public.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This makes sense in more ways than one, of course. Have you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; noticed that mothers with babies and small children can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spend several minutes pawing over fruit and vegetables on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; display? How do you know she has washed her hands since
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; changing a diaper or wiping some kids ass?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I much prefer buying pre-packaged vegetables or ordering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; online.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or perhaps get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other ideas for what to eat by browsing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, well, that is a valid point. However, this is often
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; age related. By thirty or forty you should have a pretty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good idea what you and your husband [and/or children] like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to eat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In addition, if I need
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;something in the next 20 minutes, you still have to go to the store.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To me, this would indicate lack of pre-planning. Even from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an emergency standpoint, everyone should have at least two
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks supply of food and water on hand, and this is very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conservative.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If do this, you will never &quot;run out&quot; of anything or need
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything on &quot;20 minutes&quot; notice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I know people who don't plan ahead, but I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understand them. Some people are always running out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gasoline [petrol] in their vehicle.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IMHO, zero excuse for this, actually. It is just as easy to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keep the tank full as nearly empty. All that is required is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that refill every time the gauge drops to 3/4 full. Simple,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eh?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why are automotive road services memberships expensive?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because of the selfish or stupid idiots who are always
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; running out of fuel, lock themselves out of their vehicles,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don't bother to maintain the vehicles, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After all, if belong to a road service organization such as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AAA, NRMA, RACV, etc, why bother to replace a defective
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; battery when can call road services every morning when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cannot get the car started?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I have pet peeves with people who are on their cell phones talking loudly

&gt;&gt;WHY must they talk so loud?

&gt;A good question! In a recent post I suggested that maybe
&gt;they are just showing off their cellphone, but admit that so
&gt;many people have them these days that this seems unlikely.

&gt;A recent issue of _The Weekend Australian Magazine_ had an
&gt;short discussion of the ethics of mobile phone use. In last
&gt;Saturdays edition, the &quot;feedback&quot; column had what thought
&gt;what sounded like a brilliant solution to the problem of
&gt;people on subways and buses talking loudly on cell phones.
&gt;Full text follows:

&gt;========
&gt;I have a more amusing solution to the problem of noisy
&gt;mobile phone users: respond to their speech as if they were
&gt;speaking to you. Once they realise you are actively
&gt;listening, they may be resentful of _their_ personal space
&gt;being invaded that they tone it down. Even if they don't,
&gt;your attempt to keep the peace should amuse you and your
&gt;fellow travellers.
&gt;Casey Salt
&gt;Townsville, Queensland,

"/> I've done that. Can't say it's really the polite thing to do, though :*)

The retort I got on one occassion: &quot;This is a PRIVATE conversation&quot;. I said,
&quot;evidently NOT&quot;.

Warning: some of the fellow travellers were amused, others seemed not.

Satisfying personally as it was, it does add to the noise and the rancor of the
cell phone yellers - it's probably not the best thing to do in the long run.

Cheers,
Banty

&gt; Many of the conversations are worth listening to. They are often more
&gt; interesting that what is going on over here.

"/> Okay, I know we're talking about grocery stores, but I had to get this
one off my chest.

The other day we were in a nice restaurant, in the last table right
near the bar area. This guy in the bar kept getting calls on his cell.
The bar area was too noisy, so he'd walk towards the restaurant area.
Since the waiters were rushing back and forth and he was in the way, he
kept camping himself right behind my seat. Then he'd stand there and
chat away in a REALLY LOUD VOICE.

We politely asked him twice could he please take his call outside? But
it was a really cold night, so while he'd go outside to finish, the
next call he got he'd walk right back over to the spot behind my chair
again. GRRRRR. No amount of glares would get across. I even pushed my
chair back at one point - deliberately bumping into him - and still he
didn't get the hint.

Finally his dining companions showed up. Apparently, they kept calling
him just to tell them they were still looking for a parking spot and
would be there shortly. That's it! That's the only reason his stupid
cell kept ringing off the hook. In fact, his dining companions walked
up, still chatting to him on his cell, as he walked towards the door to
meet them, still chatting with them on his cell.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's a just the 8 to 10 spots set aside for those with kids or
&gt;&gt;&gt; pregnant that I have problems with.

&gt;&gt; It certainly seems silly. I push-started a truck when I was 7 months
&gt;&gt; pregnant and it's really not that difficult to stuff kids into a cart
&gt;&gt; and push them to the store.

&gt; Well, my kids are no longer that age, but I would like to say:

&gt; 1) It's highly dangerous to put kids into a shopping cart. These things
&gt; are quite tippy, even more so when wheeled across uneven parking lot
&gt; pavement. I had a scare with my DD, when she was younger. The shopping
&gt; cart tipped over in the parking lot and she fell on her head. She was
&gt; bruised but ultimately okay, but after that I refused to put my kids in
&gt; a cart.

"/> Maybe I was lucky, but that never happened to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2) Assuming one was going to rely on a cart to transport kids from car
&gt; to store, I'd personally get nervous leaving my kids in the car while
&gt; running across the parking lot to grab a cart. Same goes for once
&gt; you've returned from the store, packed kids + groceries into the car,
&gt; then have to return the cart.

"/> Most parking lots are pretty level. The car is in park. The keys are
in your hand. Maybe you even have the parking brake on. What are you
afraid of? It's not like you parked in a downhill driveway and your
tiny baby son crawled out of his carseat and put the car into neutral,
allowing it to roll down the driveway and out into the street. Oh,
wait, that was me...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It makes sense to me that the stalls
&gt; reserved for those with children happen to always be right next to the
&gt; return-cart stalls. Less abandoned carts that way.

&gt; 3) Assuming one was not going to do #2, but instead rely on walking
&gt; across the lot while holding kids' hands, that also makes me nervous,
&gt; especially with young squirmy kids or more than one kid. Drivers
&gt; backing out can't see kids - they're too short.

"/> If you threaten them properly they will stick close to you while
crossing the parking lot. Like somebody else here mentioned, if it was
a problem I'd go with the leashes, especially in crowds. They don't go
around the neck like a dog collar, they're connected to a harness-like
apparatus. If the kid doesn't like it he can always learn to stay where
he's supposed to be.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; For all these reasons, I've always assumed that the special stalls for
&gt; those with children had less to do with a courtesy and more to do with
&gt; grocery store's liability. Perhaps one too many carts tipped over or
&gt; kids got run over in the lot.

"/> I'd guess the liability thing wouldn't work, or that the markets
consider it a cost of doing business. If they gave a damn about
courtesy they'd hire more checkers and lower prices.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Anyway, even though my kids are preteen age now, and I couldn't use the
&gt; stalls if I wanted to, I don't mind them at all. It doesn't kill us to
&gt; walk an extra 50 feet to the store, and in fact, it's good exercise for
&gt; us.

Interesting question: Is it in the best interests of our children to

(b) how to successfully bend or break them when it would clearly be
beneficial. Discuss among yourselves.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what else should I be asking for? Engine overhaul?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any distance limitations? Can see such low rates in city
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; areas, but what happens if you are on vacation in Death
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Valley and 100 miles from the nearest garage?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In a city or town of any size you should never have to ask
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for any &quot;road service&quot;. You should be able to handle most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problems yourself unless you are disabled in some way.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It can however be a convenient way
&gt;&gt;&gt; to deal with the lack of petrol etc.

&gt;&gt; True, but it can also be a way to end up stranded
&gt;&gt; on some road in a remote area if you cannot
&gt;&gt; contact your road service organization, which
&gt;&gt; is quite possible in much of Australia.

&gt;Nope, not if you use the Globalsat service flogged by Vodafone.

"/> OK, must admit am not up with latest offers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Its a standard GSM service when available and uses

&gt;The call cost isnt too bad either for that sort of problem.

&gt;&gt; Mobile phone coverage is unavailable in most remote areas,

&gt;Wrong. Globalstar is fine.

&gt;&gt; and even HF and UHF citizens band is not that reliable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; and a comprehensive medical kit from
&gt;&gt; the RFDS. [Royal Flying Doctor Service]

&gt;There's no need for that unless you go offroad.

"/> Depends on where you are. There are many rural roads in
sparsely populated areas which have almost no traffic.

Last time I was in North Queensland one didn't have to go
more than about 20 miles (~ 32 km) inland from the coast
until encountered large warning signs warning that
travellers should not proceed past that point without
adaquate supplies of food, water, oil, petrol, spares, etc.

It wasn't that many years ago when a group of Aboriginals in
a truck were driving from a settlement to the nearest large
town. From memory, the truck broke down. Some stayed with
the truck, some of the males tried to walk out. Most of the
group died of thirst. On such a road there might not be an
average of one vehicle every week or so, and it doesnt take
that long to die in some parts of Australia if don't have
water.

AFIK, travellers in remote areas are still advised to notify
police when they are likely to check in at the next town.
Then if they don't show up on schedule, someone can start a
search for them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; The HF operates on several bands, which ensures
&gt;&gt; communication. The tourist will be told what medications
&gt;&gt; to take out of the kit, if this is likely to solve the problem.

&gt;And a globalsat handset is MUCH more reliable.

&gt;&gt; If it isn't, the RFDS will fly in for a rescue.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; but there are a lot of remote areas in the western
&gt;&gt; half, and people still die when they do the wrong thing.

&gt;Sure, but far fewer get murdered by serial killers too.

"/> This is true, Australia is definitely a safer place than the
USA. Still, when I first arrived I wasn't worried about
walking alone anywhere in Sydney day or night. Must admit
that I would be reluctant to do it today, though.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Even in city areas there are many risks.

&gt;Nope, few, actually.

&gt;&gt; Suppose that a large US city has a
&gt;&gt; local nuclear power plant malfunction,

&gt;Has very little effect on anyone.

"/> Depends on the malfunction. Remember the story about the
nuclear power engineer who had explained to his audience
that nuclear plants cannot explode like a bomb?

In the following question period a member of the audience
asked what would happen in the event of a LOCA [Loss Of
Coolant Accident.] The engineer hesitated a moment, then
answered that the core would go &quot;prompt critical&quot; and the
reactor &quot;would disassemble&quot;.

Sounds much nicer than meltdown, doesn't it? Back in the
days of the cold war, the US Gov't assured the public that
in the event of an enemy first strike without warning that
the US would probably suffer first day casualties of
60 megadeaths. Sounds much nicer than 60,000,000 people,
doesn't it?

&gt;So rare its not worth worrying about.

"/> Here, so far, yes. The Hilton Hotel bombing was definitely
an amateur effort. In the US, more of a risk as we saw with
Oklahoma City and the WTC.

Before 9/11 most Americans would have told you that they
weren't worried about terrorism.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;You're much more likely to get fried when a gas train goes bag etc.

"/> Yes, this is true. The chances of any given person in
Australia or the US dying as the result of a terrorist
incident is very small. Probably much more likely to be
killed by a drug addict or colliding with a car controlled

&gt;&gt; How long would the unprepared person have to wait at the

&gt;&gt; several dollars a gallon for gasoline, there
&gt;&gt; would be people who demanded it at gunpoint.

&gt;In practice that doesnt happen in the first world.

&gt;&gt; Considering there is seldom an excuse for not
&gt;&gt; keeping a full fuel tank, who would do otherwise? ....

"/> It doesn't really, but much of the charm of usenet is that
fairly uninteresting threads often evolve into matters of
greater interest. :-)

When you get into a conversation with someone you don't
strictly stick to a set topic do you? :-)

Incidentally, heard an interesting item on the ABC a few
minutes ago. Apparently there are some people in Sydney and
Melbourne sticking minature US flags in piles of dog shit on
sidewalks, in parks, etc.

Authorities don't know who is doing it or why, but when the
practice first started it was thought that it might be a
form of protest to the US invasion of Iraq. Another
hypothesis is that is a comment on the re-election of
President Bush. Or perhaps the act is just designed to
annoy Americans, who have a far different attitude towards
the US flag than most other nationalities.

How many Australians do you see with a flagpole flying the
Australian flag outside their homes? Or wearing flag pins?

Both are pretty common in the USA, or used to be anyway.

So far none of the people doing it have been caught, and in
any case there is probably nothing they can be charged with
anyway, as there is no law against using a pile of dogshit
as a flagstand.

&gt;&gt;&gt;As soon as that couple has kids, they'll start adding 12 additoional

&gt;&gt;&gt;further.

&gt;&gt;This is no different than when a store runs a good sale on a certain

&gt;&gt;this by him getting his 2 separate from my 2. Since we end up with 4 of

&gt;&gt;trip. If it is something we really need a lot of we may make another

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) It's highly dangerous to put kids into a shopping cart. These

&gt;&gt; things

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are quite tippy, even more so when wheeled across uneven parking

&gt;&gt; lot

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pavement. I had a scare with my DD, when she was younger. The

&gt;&gt; shopping

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cart tipped over in the parking lot and she fell on her head. She

&gt;&gt; was

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bruised but ultimately okay, but after that I refused to put my

&gt;&gt; kids in

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a cart.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wow, that is scary. I never had a problem with a cart tipping (until

&gt;&gt; my

&gt;&gt;&gt; kids got to be about 5 and didn't want to ride in the cart but tried

&gt;&gt; to

&gt;&gt;&gt; hang on the side or end of it. The cart tipped once, I explained to
&gt;&gt;&gt; them why we don't do that, and they stopped trying to get a free

&gt;&gt; ride.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; But if the parking lot is uneven or in the midst of pothole season,

&gt;&gt; it

&gt;&gt;&gt; certainly could be dangerous.

&gt;&gt; Especially if the parent pushing the cart is petite like me. Some of
&gt;&gt; these grocery carts are enormous, and since I'm short, the leverage is
&gt;&gt; all wrong for maneuvering them when they get out of control. Easy for a
&gt;&gt; cart to start tipping if it hits a pothole, and then hard for someone
&gt;&gt; who's short to prevent it from tipping over. :-(

&gt;&gt; I personally think the carts that are designed like cars are a fabulous
&gt;&gt; invention. Very sturdy and not so tippable. I gladly get out of my way
&gt;&gt; when I see a parent pushing one down the aisle.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Assuming one was going to rely on a cart to transport kids from

&gt;&gt; car

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to store, I'd personally get nervous leaving my kids in the car

&gt;&gt; while

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; running across the parking lot to grab a cart. Same goes for once
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you've returned from the store, packed kids + groceries into the

&gt;&gt; car,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then have to return the cart. It makes sense to me that the stalls
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reserved for those with children happen to always be right next to

&gt;&gt; the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; return-cart stalls. Less abandoned carts that way.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Since I had to shop with two small children, we always went to the

&gt;&gt; store

&gt;&gt;&gt; at low peak times, like mid-morning. I never had a problem finding a

&gt;&gt;&gt; parking place near the return cart bin. I would load both kids in

&gt;&gt; the

&gt;&gt;&gt; cart and push it into the store. However, if was really cold

&gt;&gt; weather, I

&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't put them into a cold cart that had been sitting in the parking

&gt;&gt;&gt; lot for hours. Instead, I picked up and carried the little one and

&gt;&gt; had

&gt;&gt;&gt; the older one hold my hand as we walked into the store.

&gt;&gt; My kids are only 19 months apart.

&gt; Wow, you're like me. Mine are 18 1/2 months apart. People would look
&gt; at me like &quot;Ooh, two in diapers?&quot; But I think it would have been even
&gt; worse to get out of the diaper stage and then get back into it. In the
&gt; two-in-the-shopping-cart-days people would frequently ask me if they
&gt; were twins. They're 12 1/2 and 14 now and the best of friends, and
&gt; enjoying living in the same &quot;world&quot; of school and activities. I'm
&gt; really glad they're that close, though I confess I don't remember a
&gt; whole lot about the first six months of the baby's life!

"/> Our first two were a year and 2 days apart. I almost wish I could not
remember a lot of the first 6 mo of baby #2. Colic kept this kid crying
non-stop or at least until finally passing out for the first 4 mo of
life. I learned a lot of patience then ;)

This is from a Dave Barry article a few years back. Seems kinda
timely for this discussion -

================================

In addition to Road Rage, I frequently experience Parking Lot Rage,
which occurs when I pull into a crowded supermarket parking lot, and I
see people get into their car, clearly ready to leave, so I stop my
car and wait for them to vacate the spot, and.....Nothing happens!
They just stay there! WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY DOING IN THERE??!!
COOKING DINNER???

When I finally get into the supermarket, I often experience Shopping
Cart Rage. This is caused by the people who routinely manage, by
careful placement, to block the entire aisle with a single shopping
cart.

What makes the supermarket congestion even worse is that shoppers are
taking longer and longer to decide what to buy, because every product
in America now comes in an insane number of styles and sizes.

For example, I recently went to the supermarket to get orange juice.
For just one brand of orange juice, Tropicana, I had to decide whether
I wanted Original, Homestyle, Pulp Plus, Double Vitamin C, Grovestand,
Calcium or Old Fashioned; I also had to decide whether I wanted the
16-ounce, 32-ounce, 64-ounce, 96-ounce or six-pack size.

This is WAY too many product choices. It caused me to experience Way
Too Many Product Choices Rage. I would have called Tropicana and
complained, but I probably would have wound up experiencing Automated
Phone Answering System Rage (for questions about Pulp Plus in the
32-ounce size, press 23. For questions about Pulp Plus in the 64-ounce
size, press 24).

&gt;&gt; Negative &quot;stories&quot; (experiences) are spread quicker
&gt;&gt; than any positive experiences by a 10:1 ratio.

&gt;True in spades when the express lane limits ARENT enforced, stupid.

&gt;&gt; Every person a manager or clerk pisses off will immediately,
&gt;&gt; and often indefinitely, go tell a twisted tale of woe to
&gt;&gt; everyone (friend and stranger, it won't matter) that
&gt;&gt; doesn't make haste trying to get away from them.

&gt;Mindless silly stuff, like the original.

&gt;&gt; And those same reluctant listeners will spread that 2nd-hand tale of
&gt;&gt; woe to another 10 people, personalizing it to draw in more listeners.

&gt;They're MUCH more likely to spread the word that the
&gt;express lane rules are adhered to in the particular store.

&gt;&gt; Pretty soon the store doesn't have enough customers
&gt;&gt; to stay open because they rigidly enforced some rules.

&gt;Never said a word about rigidly.

&gt;&gt; That's why no one wants to be an
&gt;&gt; ogre about express lane enforcement.

&gt;Never said a word about an ogre either.

&gt;&gt; They _will_ miss that customer's money -- and
&gt;&gt; everyone that believed her story and stayed away.

&gt;And they'll gain the customers who use the express lanes and
&gt;like to see them used only by customers who are in a hurry.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The only time I saw a manager move a customer with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; too many items from an express lane to the end of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; another line was when he was moving on to another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; job. He got a round of applause from those of us in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; both express lanes. (Lucky's, 8/91, White and Alum
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rock.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then that is obviously why arseholes have noticed
&gt;&gt;&gt; they can get away with flouting the express lane rule.

&gt;&gt; Right...

&gt;Fraid so.

"/> Totally agree with this post. The problem is that every
time that someone is allowed through with more than the
allowed items, especially when they grossly violate the
rule, other shoppers notice and they will do the same if
they think they can get away with it.

I can think of one possible solution, though. Stores have
various code words or numbers to alert staff of suspected
shoplifters, etc.

When a customer tries to break the maximum item rule, the
checkout clerk could politely explain that he or she cannot
authorize any exceptions to the rule, and offer to page the
manager, as only he can make such exceptions. They can then
ask the customer to wait for the manager who can sort out
the problem.

The clerk then makes an announcement &quot;Code 13, register 6&quot;
or something similar. The customer thinks this is a request
for the manager to attend. It is, in a way. It is a code
to request the manager to deal with a selfish asshole on
register 6, but only after a 20 or 30 minute delay.

The customer then has the choice of standing there looking
like a shag on a rock and feeling increasingly embarrassed
as others wonder why she is standing to one side without
checking out.

Alternatively, she can return the excess items to the shelf
until she gets down to the required limit, or she can check
out through a regular line, not the express line.

This should be even more effective if she has a couple of
bratty kids with her who would quickly get bored, and start
demanding tempting items found near checkouts.

Alternatively, it should also work if she had to get back to
her office job.

When I first arrived in Australia supermarkets were only
open from 9 to 5 on weekdays and until noon on Saturday. A
single person who worked the same hours often had to shop in
their lunch hours.

These days, though, we have late night shopping on Thursday
nights and large supermarkets open and close later, often
trading all day Saturday. In some localities they may even
open Sundays.

Therefore there seems to be little excuse for anyone having
to shop in their lunch hour, at least having to shop for
more than a very few items which do qualify for the use of
express lanes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do what I do: shop online and have your groceries delivered. It's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;worth
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the few extra bucks because it saves you the stress and also saves a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of time. The delivery guy even brings the groceries in for me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I can't pick out the quality of produce doing that,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Large supermarkets, especially chains, are encouraging
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; online shopping as allows them to balance their staff
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; workload far better. One of the largest problems for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; supermarkets is staff utilization. Customer flow is not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really that predictable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If don't have enough staff on hand to meet peak checkout
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; demand then people get annoyed at having to wait to long and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abandon trolleys full of food and go elsewhere.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At least I do this. I am only willing to wait a few minutes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to check out. If the store cannot provide enough staff to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meet this demand, or provide self-checkout services, then I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will simply abandon one or more cartloads of food and go to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some store that can provide swift service.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One of my pet peeves are people who search for exact change
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to pay for any purchase, especially when they take longer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than a few seconds to provide it. To me, this is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obsessive/compulsive behaviour and slows up service. Far
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; easier for all concerned to pay cash and accept change or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use a credit/debit card.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I was running a supermarket, I would make people using
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; personal checks go through a separate checkout. Why should
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wait while someone finds their checkbook, writes a stub,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then the check, then wait while the store verifies it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As supermarkets know of these problems, it pays them to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; introduce online shopping. When staff aren't required on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; checkouts or stocking shelves, they can be filling online
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; orders.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, in order to get people to use online shopping, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; store has to provide excellent produce. If start sending
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out substandard stuff, such as unripe or bruised fruit or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vegetables, then fussy people won't use the service.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore, if the supermarket manager is smart, he has the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; finest produce set aside for filling online orders to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people to use the service. The &quot;second grade&quot; stuff is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; offered to the public.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This makes sense in more ways than one, of course. Have you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; noticed that mothers with babies and small children can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spend several minutes pawing over fruit and vegetables on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; display? How do you know she has washed her hands since
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; changing a diaper or wiping some kids ass?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I much prefer buying pre-packaged vegetables or ordering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; online.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or perhaps get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other ideas for what to eat by browsing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, well, that is a valid point. However, this is often
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; age related. By thirty or forty you should have a pretty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good idea what you and your husband [and/or children] like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to eat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In addition, if I need
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;something in the next 20 minutes, you still have to go to the store.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To me, this would indicate lack of pre-planning. Even from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an emergency standpoint, everyone should have at least two
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks supply of food and water on hand, and this is very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conservative.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If do this, you will never &quot;run out&quot; of anything or need
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything on &quot;20 minutes&quot; notice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I know people who don't plan ahead, but I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understand them. Some people are always running out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gasoline [petrol] in their vehicle.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IMHO, zero excuse for this, actually. It is just as easy to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keep the tank full as nearly empty. All that is required is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that refill every time the gauge drops to 3/4 full. Simple,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eh?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why are automotive road services memberships expensive?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because of the selfish or stupid idiots who are always
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; running out of fuel, lock themselves out of their vehicles,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don't bother to maintain the vehicles, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After all, if belong to a road service organization such as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AAA, NRMA, RACV, etc, why bother to replace a defective
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; battery when can call road services every morning when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cannot get the car started?

&gt;&gt; Last time I was in North Queensland one didn't have to

&gt;Thats just notifying you early where that stuff is still

&gt;&gt; It wasn't that many years ago when a group of Aboriginals

&gt;&gt; town. From memory, the truck broke down. Some stayed
&gt;&gt; with the truck, some of the males tried to walk out. Most of the

&gt;Sure, but that rare, about as rare as getting eaten by a shark.

"/> Admittedly not a major hazard, but not the best way to go.
A quick look on Google offers one small set of stats:

========
Human Deaths in Australia Between 1980-1990, Inclusive (from
Stevens &amp; Paxton, 1992)

Activity / Total Deaths Average/Year

Crocodile Attacks 8 0.7

Shark Attacks 11 1

Lightning Strikes 19 1.7

Bee Stings 20 1.8

Scuba Diving
Accidents 88 8

Drownings/
Submersions 3367 306

Motor Vehicle 32,772 2,979
Accidents

http://www.amonline.net.au/factsheets/sharks.htm============

Of course, if look at actual chances of death from any
cause, what is the chance that an American, Australia or
UK citizen will die of a terrorist attack in his lifetime?

Yet we are spending a huge amount of money fighting a war in
Iraq, and many think that this has increased our chances of
terrorist attacks, not decreased them.

According to Seymour Hersh of the New Yorker US Special
Forces are now operating in Iran.

=========
Pentagon slams Iran raid report

[extracts]
The Pentagon has made a blistering attack on American
journalist Seymour Hersh for claiming the United States has
been preparing for possible air strikes against Iran.

But the US Government has not denied his central allegation.
--------
But the errors the Pentagon points out are comparatively
minor.

While it also accuses Mr Hersh of being unable to keep track
of his wanderings, it never refutes his central claim that
the US is considering air strikes against Iran.

Mr Hersh has since responded to the criticism by Pentagon
spokesman Lawrence di Rita.

&quot;The last time he [Mr di Rita] and I crossed swords was over
Abu Ghraib, when I wrote about it six months ago or so,&quot; he
said.

&quot;At that time he said ... there's not much of a story
there.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then that is obviously why arseholes have noticed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they can get away with flouting the express lane rule.

"/> A local store has a terrible setup for an express lane: it's the one
lane in which people can purchase tobacco products. Found out the hard
way. Had four or five items and saw the &quot;express&quot; lane open. In front
of me was a woman (of course) with definitely more than the 10 maximum
items. As she took out an endless collection of items from her cart, I
turned back to the person behind me in line (a man with very few
items), and said in a raised voice: &quot;So much for the 10 items or less!&quot;
He snickered. The woman turned around and calmly pointed out that she
had to be in this line to get tobacco. She bought a few cans of
chewing tobacco. I was probably fortunate she was so calm, as nicotine
addicts usually have short tempers. When it was finally my turn, the
clerk said the usual fake &quot;How are you?&quot; Pretending he meant for me to
answer literally, I said, &quot;Fine, except for having to wait behind
someone with a million items in the 'express' lane!&quot; I told him, &quot;Too
bad management doesn't make the express line anywhere else than the
tobacco line!&quot;

[snip Nilkids' suggestions at countering express line violations]

A rather new Walmart did something good with their express lines: the
counters are ultra-short. Good idea, though people might be able to
fit more than 10 tiny items.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Yeah, tho there is no good reason for paying bills
&gt; in person either, yet plenty are silly enough to do that.

"/> I pay most of my water bills in person. They don't offer electronic
auto-pay. The water office is so close to where I often have other
errands, the cost of going in person is that of driving about a quarter
of a mile, plus starting the vehicle one extra time. This cost is less
than the 40 cents or so it'd cost to mail the bill.

Regarding the rude people in grocery stores, recently someone wrote a
controversial letter to the editor that offended a lot of readers. The
letter complained about retired people who shop on evenings and
weekends, clogging up the aisles for the people with jobs who HAVE to
shop on evenings and weekends. The letter requested that retired
people shop during the day on weekdays when most working people are at
work. The old people fired back with belligerent replies, saying
they'll shop when they want.

In my experience, old people, especially old women, are the rudest.
Many old couples walk slower than snails, side by side to block the
aisle. They take forever to choose items, and they fondle every piece
of produce with their filthy hands, sometimes dropping fruit and
vegetables on the ground.

I try to shop when households with children are most likely to be at
home having dinner. This cuts down on some married couples as well.
Young single people without children behave the best.

The worst is when I'm able to shop during the day on a weekday,
thinking the kids are in school, only to find there's no school that
day and the stores are overrun with hyperactive children whose mothers
let them misbehave.

It would be good to know when Mother's Day is, so I could shop for
groceries a day or two before Mother's Day. In case anyone isn't up
with the lingo, &quot;Mother's Day&quot; is slang for when the welfare queens get
their welfare checks and/or food stamps.

&gt; is in the lot in front of us near the front entrance, pulling forward and
&gt; about to turn one of the angled slots right in front of the store, a coveted
&gt; parking position here.

&gt; Another woman, who is driving an Acura SUV, suddenly reverses out of the
&gt; regular slots back into the front of the lot and directly into the path of
&gt; the woman who is slowly advancing on the slot up front. The other woman
&gt; stops abruptly but the SUV just keeps coming, oblivious. She backs right
&gt; into the front of the first woman's Volvo, and then pulls forward and parks
&gt; in the slot she was about to take.

&gt; When the first lady gets out and approaches the woman who hit her as she
&gt; emerges from her SUV, the culprit screeches epithets and tells the injured
&gt; party to take a pill, then calls her a bitch, gets a cart, and strolls on
&gt; into the store. My partner and I are standing two feet away from the
&gt; accident as it happens.

&gt; So you back into traffic abruptly, hit somebody, and then steal her parking
&gt; spot--and then call her a bitch.

&gt; Special place in hell.

"/> Better yet, that's a hit-and-run and you can call the cops to drag her
out of the store.

I live with my sister, we share a home - ie rent and utilities...but not
grocery expenses. I used to share them but she is a spendthrift when it
comes to food. she's a tightwad about the thermostat, the water heater,
things like that but not food. I'm not letting my kids get used to eating
like she does.

But sometimes, when we just need a few things, we will save gas $$ and go to
the store together, enjoy the pleasure of each other's company, put it all
in one cart and then pay for it separately. I'd rather go through the
express lane where we are not going to clog up traffic for our few items and
have the rest of you make judgements you are not capable of making
legitimately.

is ludicrous to think you know everything about their arrangements. They
may share they may not. Are all those who have a less th an traditional

share that than the particulars of their sex life in my experience.

In the case of buying groceries, who is paying ultimately and if that
expense was shared is not necessarily something you could or would know
about a couple. It's kind of hard to know what goes on, regardless of what
is said, even by the couple. I certainly would not have told others about
my marriage.

My point is that not everyone who is perceived as being rude is doing
something wrong or even skirting the spirit of the law. One should try to

couple, and if they have one, their bookkeeper, know for certain. You also
don't know if they are purchasing for someone else who is not along with
them with complete certainty. They could be secret santa clause types who

Protest all you want, you may be right 99% of the time too, but the
potential for error exists and not to admit that is judgemental.

Of course there are people who are hell bent on thinking the worst of
everyone else. I hope that is not true for in your life as it wastes so
much potential and doesn't get you anywhere. It's so much easier and better
on a person's psyche to admit they hate waiting in line at the grocery store
and leave it at that. Unless of course it is LESS comforting in that
situation to think the people in front of them are not trying to beat the
system. If that's the case I can't offer any advice as to how to deal with

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And his point was that your 'no one knows' is too strong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sometimes some do know that a particular pair are married.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll admit that it is possible you could be reasonably certain that a
&gt; given
&gt;&gt;&gt; married couple does completely share expenses. But not totally.

&gt;&gt; There'd be damned few who pay for their own grocerys.&gt;&gt;

&gt; And you can't possibly know for complete certain which ones they are unless
&gt; they are you.

&gt;&gt; Reams mindlessly silly very unlikely possibilitys flushed where they
&gt; belong.

&gt;&gt; Clearly with ALL your silly examples SOMEONE does actually know.&gt;&gt;

&gt; Unless they are describing themselves, it's not possible to completely know.

"/> Are you incapable of thinking outside the box? Are you completely unable to

It's possible you have never been aware of the situations which I describe
and can not fathom them being true. However, I can tell you from personal
experience, ie, me not secondhand...that it does happen. It isn't
necessarily wanted but not all things in life are. I would never have told
anyone when I was married my ex and I did not share the expenses for
groceries for a while. I was embarrassed and ashamed of that situation.
Usually I hid it by shopping separately from him but when you have to ride
the bus it's sometimes easier to wait and shop with him in the car. It's
really comforting to know that while I was in that situation there were
people like you behind me assuming that I just didn't want to wait in line
because you knew us and knew we were married. (sarcasm intended)

"/>  you know what, I can't possibly know for sure, but I can be reasonably sure
you just prefer to assume something you can't be sure of. I can only guess
why that is.

SInce my divorce I have been poor almost the entire time. (To keep it on
topic, being frugal probably prevented my kids from starving and has even
recently kept us in shelter when others would have been out on the street.)
I've had anonymous groceries placed on my doorstep. Yeah, I can assume
somebody bought them, but then again the store could have donated them so I
can't be sure. The nature of them being anonymous precludes any assumption
as to who if anyone purchased them... and if they were purchased and not
donated whether the couple (if it even was a couple) did so in one purchase
or in a separate one and if it was a separate one if it was with their own
groceries or on a day where they bought only charity. I've purchased two
loads on various occasions, with and without others, for our household and
for other people, as a favour and for charity. Because of the nature of
charity, I'm not about to reveal which times those are and it's nobody's
business. Again, it's really comforting to know that there are people out
there wondering whether I'm being selfish.

It's not bullshit. Refusing to make judgements about the circumstances and
motives of others is human kindness. I'm sure you're familiar with it.

|||| be right next to the return-cart stalls. Less abandoned carts that
|||| way.
||||
||| Since I had to shop with two small children, we always went to the
||| store at low peak times, like mid-morning. I never had a problem
||| finding a
||
||| parking place near the return cart bin. I would load both kids in

||| in the parking
||
||| lot for hours. Instead, I picked up and carried the little one and
||| had the older one hold my hand as we walked into the store.
||
||

|| or both kids were sick, and we'd have to hit the pharmacy on the way
|| home for an Rx. Argh. Those were the days!!
||
|| Plus, my husband (now ex-h) routinely travelled Mon thru Fri.
|| Sometimes it was hard not to avoid a quick run to the store
|| mid-week. I found a good strategy was to skip the cart completely,
|| and instead push the kids through the store using the double
|| stroller. I'd pick up just enough items that could fit in the
|| stroller basket.
||
||
||| I would never
||| have left them in the car while I crossed a parking lot looking for
||| a
||
||| cart.
||
|| Yep.
||
||| There were some occasions when someone would be wheeling
||| groceries to a car just as we drove up. Seeing my situation, those
||| people nearly always offered me the cart when they were finished,
||| and I was always appreciative of their understanding.
||
|| Yes, there are some nice people out there.
||
|||| 3) Assuming one was not going to do #2, but instead rely on walking
|||| across the lot while holding kids' hands, that also makes me
|||| nervous, especially with young squirmy kids or more than one kid.
|||| Drivers backing out can't see kids - they're too short.
|||
||| I had one basic rule. Never let go. Fortunately, my older one
||| wasn't the squirmy kind, but I can hold a death grip on a hand if I
||| believe it is a matter of life and death.
||
|| It's tough when you've got two that are very close in age. It got a
|| lot easier when they were old enough to obey my instructions to hold
|| on to the cart and not let go. They still do that, even though
|| they're 10 and 12 now. :-)
||
|||| For all these reasons, I've always assumed that the special stalls
|||| for those with children had less to do with a courtesy and more to
|||| do with grocery store's liability. Perhaps one too many carts
|||| tipped over or kids got run over in the lot.
|||
||| You're probably right.
|||
|||| Anyway, even though my kids are preteen age now, and I couldn't
|||| use the stalls if I wanted to, I don't mind them at all. It
|||| doesn't kill us to walk an extra 50 feet to the store, and in
|||| fact, it's good exercise for us.
|||
||| When I was pregnant, I wanted all the exercise I could get, so I
||| never minded walking across a parking lot. But not every pregnancy
||| is an easy one, so there can be a need for these special parking
||| spaces. I don't think anyone wants to see a woman go into labor in
||| a parking lot.
|||
||| My favorite grocery shopping experience in my days with small
||| children, though, was at the 24-hour Super Walmart in our city. I
||| could wake up at 4:00 a.m. and have the luxury of grocery shopping
||| by myself while my husband was still home with the kids (most of
||| the time, they never knew I was out). There was never anyone else
||| in the store, and the employees were just putting out all the fresh
||| produce. It was a great, relaxing time and never took very long.
||
|| Walmart has the worst shopping carts of all. Very tippy! And such
|| huge parking lots. Definetly wise not to take the kids along.
||
||| For all of you who complain about a woman shopping with small
||| children in tow, believe me, she would have gone shopping alone if
||| it were possible. But if a woman is home alone with small children
||| and the household is out of milk, there's no alternative. I hope
||| people were
||
||| more tolerant of your mothers than you all seem to be of the women
||| out shopping with their children.
||| Deb
||
|| Agreed.

for each even if his cart looks full as one order. Granted, he doesn't use
the express line, but I'm sure he must look to others as a pain because he

My point is that you (or anyone in line) has no idea what the circumstances

it's an act of a moron, but cheating the system?

As a bicyclist, I do everything via bicycle: go to work (6

line holding in my hands/arms my items and wait, surely a
person who has their items can wait. Matter of fact I

We took a trip together last fall, and they brought her son. She paid

support. I assume they do the same when it comes to everyday grocery
expenses, and I can assume all I want, but I don't know for sure, even

&gt;for his share of the meal expenses separately, using her wages and child
&gt;support. I assume they do the same when it comes to everyday grocery
&gt;expenses, and I can assume all I want, but I don't know for sure, even
&gt;though I know how they handle vacation expenses. So how can you assume
&gt;that you know (Edwin) know how all those people at the grocery store,
&gt;that you may know only in passing, handle their expenses?

And I just realized that I'm probably one of those people in line that
everyone hates. Because when I take the kids with me to the store, and
they want to buy gum or some other treat, I make them pay with their
allowance money. Which means that the clerk has to ring up DD10's gum,
then ring up DD12's gum, then ring up my stuff third.

I could just pay for the gum myself and then settle it with DD's later,
but I find that because I pay with a debit card, I don't always have
change to settle it, then we forget later, and it defeats the whole
purpose of teaching my children about how to handle and budget their
own money.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their car, and drive home.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't see the problem here. Is there one?

&gt;&gt;&gt; They are complying with the letter of the rule, but not the spirit.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's morally bankrupt.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As soon as that couple has kids, they'll start adding 12 additoional
&gt;&gt;&gt; items per kid to their carts in order to exploit the loophole even
&gt;&gt;&gt; further.

&gt;&gt; This is no different than when a store runs a good sale on a certain
&gt;&gt; item and limits it to 2 per customer. DH and I have taken advantage of
&gt;&gt; this by him getting his 2 separate from my 2. Since we end up with 4 of
&gt;&gt; the item rather than 2, it saves us the gas and inconvience of a second
&gt;&gt; trip. If it is something we really need a lot of we may make another
&gt;&gt; trip or two and do the same thing. IMO, this is maximizing your resources.

&gt;Some stores have the computer set so you can only buy the alotted amount
&gt;with your club card. Even if you go to another store later in the week.

"/> A &quot;club card&quot; sounds very Orwellian to me. Why should
anyone shop in a store where they are gathering saleable

One could gain a lot of information on customers by knowing
what they purchased. Why does the supermarket use such
cards unless they are selling the information to others?

What is the benefit to the customer? Why should anyone
accept a card from a store, other than an account card?

I've stopped shopping in one discount store because they
insist on my name and address before they will accept a
credit card. As far as I'm concerned all anyone needs is
the card number, the expiry date, and my signature on the
back of the card. This is good enough for all other stores
where I shop, and I don't know why they are so damned nosy.

I don't really care if they track my sales. That's their problem. My
wife loses things, so I suspect she's lost her card. They don't care, you
can just enter your phone number and that is tied to your &quot;account&quot;. Of
course, the phone number doesn't uniquely identify her, as it also is the
phone number for me as well as the 3 kids. So everytime she shops, the
store thinks that it is my son. I use my card, which has no name or

one around. (Kind of like the NYC taxicab/bicycle thing....when I'm riding a

annoy anybody with my stroller, and people have always been very
friendly--at least downtown -- holding doors, etc. It costs exactly one
second of their time. Up on the Upper East Side, however, many people
(usually *career women* who need to get out of that deli with their
half-decaf soy latte within the nanosecond or their inner control freak
would have them implode into a billion prioritized smithereens) would huff
indignantly behind you (as you struggle to get out the door, holding three
bags), and sometimes even slither past you, yank the door open, and strut
out with their little trotters stuffed into jobber pumps, letting the door
slam behind them to make a point, glossy mag sticking out of their Prada
baglet. After all, they're professionals, and I was just some *mother* with
torn jeans and long disheveled hair. (Who writes the crap they pore over as
they waste hours on the Stairmaster after a day of spreadsheets.... blah!)

&gt;&gt; Would agree with you here, but it is also interesting to
&gt;&gt; consider why the behaviour of current generations has
&gt;&gt; deteriorated so much.

&gt;&gt; However, there are others. If we go back to the sixties in
&gt;&gt; the US we find a lot of rebellion. Some justified, some
&gt;&gt; not.

&gt;&gt; In any case, many of these rebellious people have become
&gt;&gt; parents, and many are incapable of controlling their
&gt;&gt; children.

&gt;I would agree. Even Dr. Spock recanted some of his earlier &quot;flower child&quot;
&gt;philosophy on discipline free child raising.

"/> Recanted quite a few of his earlier recommendations, didn't
he? However by that time most of the damage had been done.

From memory, his kids didn't think much of his parenting
style either.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Parents don't always set very good examples. If you are a
&gt;&gt; child and see daddy or mommy break the speed limit and
&gt;&gt; excuse their behaviour on the grounds that they are &quot;in a
&gt;&gt; hurry and there are no cops around&quot; what does that teach
&gt;&gt; you? ....That anything is permissible if you don't get
&gt;&gt; caught.

&gt;&gt; Great role models for the kids, eh? So why be surprised if
&gt;&gt; the kids are worse than their parents and their kids might
&gt;&gt; be worse still.

&gt;I don't have kids but have had neighbors with young. There's no longer any
&gt;doubt in my mind why there are so many screwed-up people in the world. I'm
&gt;not talking poor/disadvantaged people here but a relatively upscale
&gt;neighborhood; one neighbor a major US corporation vice president, an
&gt;attorney, retired pilots.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> Actually was listening to an interesting program this
morning on Radio National which is also Radio Australia, our
overseas broadcasting service.

Can listen to them in the internet, and listen to recorded
programs with _Real Media | Windows Media_

Was listening to a repeat broadcast of the following
program:

-----
Psychopaths in Suits
Produced by Ian Walker
You need to be a little mad to go in to management, and you
need to be a bit mad to do it well.

But, there's a thin grey line.
[excerpts]

Ian Walker: Psychopaths…we usually only know them from
Hollywood movies, as serial killers, rapists or sadists. If
they made a movie about the unravelling saga of the Enron
collapse, no-one would get killed…but the main characters
would still be as chilling and ruthless as any baddie from a
B-grade horror flick.

Psychopaths people our nightmares and literature, but we
never expect them to enter our real life.

But the psychopath is closer than you think.

Most of them function incognito in high-powered professions
like the law, politics, entertainment, the church, the
military, trade unions, the media and the arts.

All the way to the very top.

Professor Robert Hare: They look and dress the same way as
most businessmen, they may even use the same language. Some
of these people are fairly persuasive, they can manipulate,
they’re very charming, some of them even charismatic. And a
lot of people, they like them, they think they’re kind of
fun to be around, but it takes a long time before you can
figure out that something is really amiss here.

Ian Walker: This week, we find out what happens when the
psychopath goes to work… with hair-rising stories of toxic
bosses, irrational CEOs, backstabbling co-workers, serial
bullies and malignant narcissists. No-one gets killed, but
there’s plenty of blood on the carpet.

And we ask the question: is economic pressure on modern-day
workplaces and corporate culture itself helping to create a
world where psychopathic behaviour is flourishing and even
being rewarded?

Plus, stay tuned for a few tips from the experts in how to
spot a “psychopath in a suit”.
-------
The now-infamous Enron Tapes provide a good example…those
truly shocking recordings of phone conversations between the
ruthless electricity futures traders from the company. Their
skulduggery helped black out the power grid in California,
and cost the State billions of dollars.
------
But what happens when the aberrant behaviour of our leaders
becomes malignant, maybe criminal, perhaps even
psychopathic? What are the signs? And how would we know what
to do?

Easily the best person to ask is Canada’s Robert Hare. He’s
the world’s pre-eminent expert on psychopathy and a regular
advisor to the FBI. In the ‘70s, Hare developed what’s known
as the Psychopathy Checklist, or PCL, which is used as the
international standard by police and mental health
professionals to determine who qualifies as a psychopath.
He’s spent much of his working life inside prisons, studying
hardcore criminal psychopaths, mostly murderers and serial
rapists.

More recently though, he’s shifted his focus to the
workplace and has now teamed up with Paul Babiak to help
corporations identify the psychopath at work.

Robert Hare: We estimate, on the basis of some reasonably
decent data, that about 1% of the general population will
meet our criteria for psychopathy. And in the business
world, the prevalence debatably could be somewhat higher,
dependent upon the organisation. The problem for the
organisation is that only one or two of these people can do
enormous damage, particularly if they get very high up in
the organisation.

In this instance, a written transcript is available. Can
pick from above site or direct at

http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s1265568.htm=============

A fairly long transcript, but IMHO, well worth reading or

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is no different than when a store runs a good sale on a certain

&gt;&gt;&gt; this by him getting his 2 separate from my 2. Since we end up with 4 of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the item rather than 2, it saves us the gas and inconvience of a second
&gt;&gt;&gt; trip. If it is something we really need a lot of we may make another
&gt;&gt;&gt; trip or two and do the same thing. IMO, this is maximizing your resources.

You sound like one of those entitlement moo bitches who doesn't mind

&gt; parking position here.

&gt; Another woman, who is driving an Acura SUV, suddenly reverses out of the
&gt; regular slots back into the front of the lot and directly into the path of
&gt; the woman who is slowly advancing on the slot up front. The other woman
&gt; stops abruptly but the SUV just keeps coming, oblivious. She backs right
&gt; into the front of the first woman's Volvo, and then pulls forward and parks
&gt; in the slot she was about to take.

&gt; When the first lady gets out and approaches the woman who hit her as she
&gt; emerges from her SUV, the culprit screeches epithets and tells the injured
&gt; party to take a pill, then calls her a bitch, gets a cart, and strolls on
&gt; into the store. My partner and I are standing two feet away from the
&gt; accident as it happens.

&gt; So you back into traffic abruptly, hit somebody, and then steal her parking

and/or

2. let the air out of all the tires on the SUV

cart in the stall. Leave the kid alone in the cart while you go get
your car to pick him up. This is apparently not illegal. :)

&gt;&gt;&gt; They are complying with the letter of the rule, but not the spirit.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's morally bankrupt.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As soon as that couple has kids, they'll start adding 12 additoional
&gt;&gt;&gt; items per kid to their carts in order to exploit the loophole even
&gt;&gt;&gt; further.

&gt;&gt; This is no different than when a store runs a good sale on a certain
&gt;&gt; item and limits it to 2 per customer. DH and I have taken advantage of
&gt;&gt; this by him getting his 2 separate from my 2. Since we end up with 4 of
&gt;&gt; the item rather than 2, it saves us the gas and inconvience of a second
&gt;&gt; trip. If it is something we really need a lot of we may make another
&gt;&gt; trip or two and do the same thing. IMO, this is maximizing your resources.

&gt;Some stores have the computer set so you can only buy the alotted amount
&gt;with your club card. Even if you go to another store later in the week.

to the supermarket where I used to live was all the pushy people who
got on the Express Line with *at least* twice the number of maximum

The worst was the rude broad who saw me glaring and spit out &quot;You got

particularly short of time on the two or three occasions I
have done this. All were in large supermarkets with 10 or
12 checkout lanes with only 2 or 3 open. At each of these
six or seven people were waiting with cartloads of
groceries.

There were staff stocking shelves which could have been
pulled off that duty and used to open some other checkouts.
For that matter, the manager and office staff could have
been pressed into this duty until the crush eased. Two or
three more checkouts opened would have eased the problem.

Sure, it took me extra time to go to another store and pick
up purchases. It also took the offending supermarket time
to have someone replace my intended purchases on the
shelves, in the coolers, freezers, etc.

I see no reason to put up with supermarkets who cannot
manage to open up other checkouts when there are too few
open, and I suggest that if more shoppers followed my
example the supermarkets would soon learn to open extra
lanes when needed. Or, these days, to offer self-check out
services.

You may think that such little protests are a waste of time.
They are not.

When I order a rare steak at a restaurant, I expect it to be
rare, not medium rare, not medium. I have sent overdone
meat back and demanded that it be provided as ordered. Not
often, as after doing it a couple of times a friendly waiter
told me that if I wanted a rare stake in Australia I should
specify &quot;blue rare&quot;. [No, I don't know the origin of the
term, and neither did he.]

So when now order a steak, I not only specify &quot;blue rare&quot;
but to tell the cook to just sear it on each side and
restore the body heat.

Hint to tourists visiting Australia. If you ask for medium,
it will come well done. If you ask for well-done, it will
be charred to a crisp. :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, the phone number doesn't uniquely identify her, as it also

&gt;&gt;&gt; no name or address associated with it.

&gt;&gt; Try viewing the contents of you family's buying habits from

"/> What makes you think that it doesn't happen? Why do you
think the store gathers the info in the first place if they

Data mining is big business these days.

If family X suddenly starts buying baby food, disposable
diapers, etc. there is a good chance that they will start
receiving advertisements and phone calls from people selling
baby products.

If an insurance company is thinking of issuing a policy to a
customer, it can save them a lot of money if they find he
buys a case of whiskey a week.

Don't think that medical records are always sacrosanct,
either. Medical professionals are hardly likely to pass on
information on patients with HIV/AIDS for example, but
realize that a lot of non medical people may have access to
that information. Data entry clerks, cleaners, computer
hackers, etc.

The HIV/AIDS epidemic has cost insurers a lot of money as
people are dying at an unexpectedly young age.

One mate of mine has one, because he's an engineer with local

You can make the same claim about the records telcos
keep on the phone calls you make so they can charge you

up and offer you plans etc that fit your calling patterns. In
practice almost always when they do call they dont usually
even know what plan I am currently on with their company,
let alone analyse the calls to work out which ISP I am with
and see how competitive their net plans are with their own.

Just ran across this in The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki -

==================================

The best queues assemble everyone who's waiting into a single line,
with the person at the head of the line being served first.

The phalanx, which you often see in supermarkets, with each checkout
counter having its own line, is by contrast a recipe for frustration.
Not only do the other lines always seem shorter than the one you're
in, but studies of the way people perceive traffic speed suggest that
you're likely to do a bad job of estimating how fast your line is
moving relative to everyone else's.

The phalanx also makes people feel responsible for the speed with
which they check out, since it's possible that if they'd picked a
different line, they would have done better.

One change to convention that would make sense would be to allow
people to sell their places in line, since that would let the
placeholders trade their time for money, and would let busy people
trade their money for time. But this would violate the egalitarian
ethos that governs the queue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As soon as that couple has kids, they'll start adding 12 additoional

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; further.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is no different than when a store runs a good sale on a certain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; item and limits it to 2 per customer. DH and I have taken advantage of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this by him getting his 2 separate from my 2. Since we end up with 4 of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the item rather than 2, it saves us the gas and inconvience of a second
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trip. If it is something we really need a lot of we may make another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trip or two and do the same thing. IMO, this is maximizing your resources.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Some stores have the computer set so you can only buy the alotted amount
&gt;&gt;&gt;with your club card. Even if you go to another store later in the week.

&gt;&gt; A &quot;club card&quot; sounds very Orwellian to me.

&gt;More fool you. Its no more 'orwellian' than a telco keeping

"/> Not sure this would be legal here. There is a law against

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; One could gain a lot of information on customers by knowing
&gt;&gt; what they purchased. Why does the supermarket use such
&gt;&gt; cards unless they are selling the information to others?

&gt;To stop the sort of flagrant abuse of the
&gt;limits per customer that plenty engage in.

"/> Why should there be any limits per customer? Have seldom
seen limits posted here. The only way I could see it to be
a major problem is that if a store was offering a loss
leader and some small shop owner came in and bought most or
all of the items on sale.

As limits are seldom imposed, I gather that it isn't a major
problem here. Or perhaps the supermarkets just don't want
to offend customers by setting an arbitrary limit. As
mentioned in another post, I often buy 5 or 6 cases of soft
drink when there is a promotion going. I am a private
individual and not a retailer, and would probably protest
both to the manager and the retail chain if they imposed a
one or two case limit. ...But of course, I grew up in an
era where the customer was always right, or at was least
treated as if this were so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Not that its very effective given you can just get more cards.

&gt;&gt; What is the benefit to the customer?

&gt;They continue to offer specials that wouldnt be viable to
&gt;offer if they allowed the customers to buy without any limit.

"/> If other stores can do it, why can't they? I don't know of
any supermarkets here that use such cards. I suspect if
they did that they would lose far more customers than they
would gain.

Australians have a greater sense of privacy than Americans.
Many consider the American habit of asking new acquaintances
what they do for a living, how much money they make, whether
they are married and have kids, what their religious beliefs
are to be fairly offensive.

In the more remote areas of Australia many people go by a
nickname, or just their first name. It is definitely
impolite to ask their surname or where they are from.

I've never been in England, but have heard that it is
possible to live next door to someone for years without
knowing their name or anything about them.

American behaviour is far more intrusive.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Why should anyone accept a card
&gt;&gt; from a store, other than an account card?

&gt;To get the specials, stupid.

"/> When one can get specials from other stores that don't use
the scam? Whatever for? Most store discounts are part of a
deal where a particular manufacturer offering a special deal
to a particular chain. In a given week or month Chain &quot;X&quot;
might be offered a special deal on Coca-Cola, where chain
&quot;Y&quot; might be running a special on Pepsi. Next week or month
chain &quot;X&quot; is offering Pepsi and &quot;Y&quot; is offering coke. The
consumer who prefers one over the other only need wait.

Of course, if people really want to shop cheaply they get
together and buy in bulk from a wholesaler rather than buy
from retail supermarkets at all. So why do you call me
stupid if you only buy retail? :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I've stopped shopping in one discount store because they
&gt;&gt; insist on my name and address before they will accept a
&gt;&gt; credit card. As far as I'm concerned all anyone needs is
&gt;&gt; the card number, the expiry date, and my signature on the
&gt;&gt; back of the card. This is good enough for all other stores
&gt;&gt; where I shop, and I don't know why they are so damned nosy.

&gt;Presumably so they can do something about card fraud.

"/> Credit card companies post lists of stolen cards. In
addition, a retailer can always call the issuer of the
credit card to check if it is valid if they are that
worried.

This is good enough for 99% of stores here so why should I
deal with one which insists on trying to invade my privacy?
Why should I trust them if they don't trust me?

I dont actually like the single line waiting system myself.

Mainly because you have to keep track of who is free when
you come to the head of the queue and you have a much
longer queue with it shuffling up much more often.

And I dont like the number allocation system either.

&gt; Just ran across this in The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki -

&gt; ==================================

&gt; The best queues assemble everyone who's waiting into a single line,
&gt; with the person at the head of the line being served first.

&gt; The phalanx, which you often see in supermarkets, with each checkout
&gt; counter having its own line, is by contrast a recipe for frustration.
&gt; Not only do the other lines always seem shorter than the one you're
&gt; in, but studies of the way people perceive traffic speed suggest that
&gt; you're likely to do a bad job of estimating how fast your line is
&gt; moving relative to everyone else's.

&gt; The phalanx also makes people feel responsible for the speed with
&gt; which they check out, since it's possible that if they'd picked a
&gt; different line, they would have done better.

&gt; One change to convention that would make sense would be to allow
&gt; people to sell their places in line, since that would let the
&gt; placeholders trade their time for money, and would let busy people
&gt; trade their money for time. But this would violate the egalitarian
&gt; ethos that governs the queue.

last year that reflect both sides of this. One, I had eaten at a
steakhouse chain, and had been refused when I requested that fries with
my steak sandwich be substiututed with a salad. That was against theor
policy to make substitutions like that, the waitress said. I wrote the
company HQ a very polite e-mail explaining that I was trying to watch
my fried food intake, that I didn't expect anything unreasonable like a
full-size salad, etc. All I really wanted was a small handful of salad
and some dressing on the plate where the fries would have been. They
responded with a letter of apology and a $20 gift card. I was quite
impressed. Will they change their policy? Probably not, but at least
they treated me like my opinion counted.

Boldened by that experience, I wrote to a local regional supermarket
chain that had just instituted tiered pricing for different size
packages of meat in their meat department. Again, I was very polite,
and pointed out that part of the reason I shopped in their store was
precisely because they didn't play pricing games like many of the other
stores do. I got a response pointing out that their research shows
that most customers &quot;prefer&quot; tiered pricing as it gave them more
options or some crap like that. I didn't believe it for a second.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is no different than when a store runs a good sale on a certain

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trip or two and do the same thing. IMO, this is maximizing your

&gt;&gt;&gt; insist on my name and address before they will accept a
&gt;&gt;&gt; credit card. As far as I'm concerned all anyone needs is
&gt;&gt;&gt; the card number, the expiry date, and my signature on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; back of the card. This is good enough for all other stores
&gt;&gt;&gt; where I shop, and I don't know why they are so damned nosy.
&gt;&gt; Presumably so they can do something about card fraud.
&gt; Credit card companies post lists of stolen cards.

"/> Its likely done that way to discourage crims from attempting to
use stolen cards which have not yet been reported in their store.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In addition, a retailer can always call the issuer of the
&gt; credit card to check if it is valid if they are that worried.

"/> Doesnt help with a stolen card thats been so recently
stolen that it isnt likely to have been reported yet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This is good enough for 99% of stores here so why should
&gt; I deal with one which insists on trying to invade my privacy?

"/> You're always welcome to be completely paranoid and only use cash.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why should I trust them if they don't trust me?

"/> Why should they bother with the business of

manager who tended to hide in his office when things got busy. On the

up an extra checkstand and sometimes bags groceries.

&gt; It can happen. &quot;Can&quot; being the key word. I had two experiences late
&gt; last year that reflect both sides of this. One, I had eaten at a
&gt; steakhouse chain, and had been refused when I requested that fries with
&gt; my steak sandwich be substiututed with a salad. That was against theor
&gt; policy to make substitutions like that, the waitress said. I wrote the
&gt; company HQ a very polite e-mail explaining that I was trying to watch
&gt; my fried food intake, that I didn't expect anything unreasonable like a
&gt; full-size salad, etc. All I really wanted was a small handful of salad
&gt; and some dressing on the plate where the fries would have been. They
&gt; responded with a letter of apology and a $20 gift card. I was quite
&gt; impressed. Will they change their policy? Probably not, but at least
&gt; they treated me like my opinion counted.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Boldened by that experience, I wrote to a local regional supermarket
&gt; chain that had just instituted tiered pricing for different size

&gt; and pointed out that part of the reason I shopped in their store was
&gt; precisely because they didn't play pricing games like many of the other
&gt; stores do. I got a response pointing out that their research shows
&gt; that most customers &quot;prefer&quot; tiered pricing as it gave them more

&gt;&gt; Just ran across this in The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki -

&gt;&gt; ==================================

&gt;&gt; The best queues assemble everyone who's waiting into a single line,
&gt;&gt; with the person at the head of the line being served first.

&gt;&gt; The phalanx, which you often see in supermarkets, with each checkout
&gt;&gt; counter having its own line, is by contrast a recipe for frustration.
&gt;&gt; Not only do the other lines always seem shorter than the one you're
&gt;&gt; in, but studies of the way people perceive traffic speed suggest that
&gt;&gt; you're likely to do a bad job of estimating how fast your line is
&gt;&gt; moving relative to everyone else's.

&gt;&gt; The phalanx also makes people feel responsible for the speed with
&gt;&gt; which they check out, since it's possible that if they'd picked a
&gt;&gt; different line, they would have done better.

&gt;&gt; One change to convention that would make sense would be to allow
&gt;&gt; people to sell their places in line, since that would let the
&gt;&gt; placeholders trade their time for money, and would let busy people
&gt;&gt; trade their money for time. But this would violate the egalitarian
&gt;&gt; ethos that governs the queue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A &quot;club card&quot; sounds very Orwellian to me. Why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should anyone shop in a store where they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gathering saleable information about customers?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because the only grocery store within walking distance uses them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are they mandatory or optional?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What is the benefit to the customer? Why should anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accept a card from a store, other than an account card?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because you don't get the &quot;sale&quot; prices without one. We all know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that they aren't really sale prices, that they've just jacked up the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regular price and then offered to sell it cheaper if you use your card.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then there must be a reason for them to do so. Perhaps
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it is just an attempt to ensure customer loyalty, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; usually the &quot;sale&quot; items at any chain store are manufacturer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; promotions. Therefore, the card would seem to be a &quot;con&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't really care if they track my sales. That's their problem.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My wife loses things, so I suspect she's lost her card. They don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; care, you can just enter your phone number and that is tied to your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;account&quot;. Of course, the phone number doesn't uniquely identify
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; her, as it also is the phone number for me as well as the 3 kids.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So everytime she shops, the store thinks that it is my son.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I use my card, which has no name or address associated with it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't kid yourself. If they have your phone number,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you are trackable. Ever hear of a reverse telephone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; irectory? If you provide a listed directory number,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they will have your home address.

&gt;&gt;&gt; None of them have ever showed up at
&gt;&gt;&gt; my place, or even posted any mail there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And if they did, I couldnt care less.

&gt;&gt; The stores must have some reason to
&gt;&gt; go to the trouble to issue such a card.

&gt;Yes, its to encourage the customers to return to their stores.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Because the only grocery store within walking distance uses them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are they mandatory or optional?

&gt;Optional, but see below.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What is the benefit to the customer? Why should anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accept a card from a store, other than an account card?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Because you don't get the &quot;sale&quot; prices without one. We all know that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they aren't really sale prices, that they've just jacked up the regular
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;price and then offered to sell it cheaper if you use your card.

&gt;&gt; The stores must have some reason to go to the trouble to
&gt;&gt; issue such a card. Why gather information if they have no
&gt;&gt; use for it?

&gt;They certainly have uses for it in tracking what people are buying. I
&gt;heard about lots of planned targeted advertising, but haven't seen any
&gt;myself. And of course, they are &quot;loyalty&quot; cards.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For instance, if you purchase baby food or food popular
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with children, then your information may be sold to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; companies providing toys and other child products.

&gt;And this is horrible because???

"/> Because I dislike all pushy advertising. I know where to go
to find products or services I want. I don't need info
pushed down my throat.

Anyone who wants to sell me something I am interested in can
put it on a nice simple website with item and price. I
don't mind a technical description, but no multimedia, no
pictures, no hype.

Phone advertising and spam is, by definition, &quot;pushy&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Would you rather get advertising that was
&gt;irrelevant to your needs, instead of stuff that you want?

"/> 95% of the advertising I see or hear is irrelevant to my
needs. Fortunately I subscribe to the Australian which
doesn't contain much of it, don't listen to commercial radio
stations, very seldom watch commercial TV.

Anything I want I know where to find or I can soon find out
where I can source it from.

Incidentally, there ways of discouraging mass advertising
mail. Some includes reply paid envelopes which means that
the sender must pay the return postage. These can be
photostatted and mass mailed back to him. Have even known
people to glue them around housebricks and send them back.
:-)

In the war against unwanted advertising, everything is fair,
is it not?

Actually, I could get along nicely without a postal service
at all, and would actually prefer to do everything online.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've seen couples do the equivalent thing. The woman will pull 12
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; items out of the cart, pay for them, and then stand at the end of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; aisle waiting while her boyfriend pulls the remaining 12 items out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the cart and pays for them. Then they put all the grocery bags into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the cart and walk out of the store together, load everything into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their car, and drive home.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't see the problem here. Is there one?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They are complying with the letter of the rule, but not the spirit.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's morally bankrupt.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As soon as that couple has kids, they'll start adding 12 additoional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; items per kid to their carts in order to exploit the loophole even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; further.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is no different than when a store runs a good sale on a certain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; item and limits it to 2 per customer. DH and I have taken advantage of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this by him getting his 2 separate from my 2. Since we end up with 4 of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the item rather than 2, it saves us the gas and inconvience of a second
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trip. If it is something we really need a lot of we may make another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trip or two and do the same thing. IMO, this is maximizing your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resources.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Some stores have the computer set so you can only buy the alotted amount
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with your club card. Even if you go to another store later in the week.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A &quot;club card&quot; sounds very Orwellian to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;More fool you. Its no more 'orwellian' than a telco keeping
&gt;&gt;&gt;track of what calls you have made to charge you for them.

&gt;&gt; Not the same thing at all. A &quot;club card&quot; isn't a credit card.

&gt;Never said it was. It does however identify the
&gt;customer and can be used for 'data mining' in theory.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why should anyone shop in a store where they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gathering saleable information about customers?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I couldnt care less. And if you are that mindlessly paranoid,
&gt;&gt;&gt; you can always make up fake details when getting the card.

&gt;&gt; Not sure this would be legal here.

&gt;Corse it is.

&gt;&gt; There is a law against gaining money or benefits under false pretences.

&gt;Doesnt apply.

&gt;&gt; Not sure it would apply in this case, though.

&gt;Corse it doesnt.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One could gain a lot of information on customers by knowing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what they purchased. Why does the supermarket use such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cards unless they are selling the information to others?

&gt;&gt;&gt; To stop the sort of flagrant abuse of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; limits per customer that plenty engage in.

&gt;&gt; Why should there be any limits per customer?

&gt;Basically because those are often loss leaders designed
&gt;to get the customer into the store where they will usually
&gt;buy more than just what is a loss leader with grocerys etc.

&gt;They're also there to prevent their competitors taking
&gt;advantage of their better buying prices. Many of the
&gt;smaller stores cant even buy the goods for what the
&gt;major chains flog the same stuff for to customers.

&gt;&gt; Have seldom seen limits posted here.

&gt;They're quite common with the loss leaders.

&gt;&gt; The only way I could see it to be a major problem
&gt;&gt; is that if a store was offering a loss leader

&gt;Which they often do.

&gt;&gt; and some small shop owner came in and
&gt;&gt; bought most or all of the items on sale.

&gt;Doesnt have to be all or most, they have no interest in
&gt;flogging stuff to a competitor at a loss. They have a
&gt;real interest in attracting customers into their store with
&gt;a loss leader and those will usually buy more than just that.

&gt;&gt; As limits are seldom imposed,

&gt;Wrong.

&gt;&gt; I gather that it isn't a major problem here.

&gt;It is actually, essentually because of the buying power of the majors.

&gt;&gt; Or perhaps the supermarkets just don't want
&gt;&gt; to offend customers by setting an arbitrary limit.

&gt;Or perhaps they do have limits.

&gt;&gt; As mentioned in another post, I often buy 5 or 6
&gt;&gt; cases of soft drink when there is a promotion going.

&gt;Sure. I used when I still bought beer, before I started to
&gt;make my own and I still do with the cans of concentrate etc.

&gt;&gt; I am a private individual and not a retailer, and would
&gt;&gt; probably protest both to the manager and the retail
&gt;&gt; chain if they imposed a one or two case limit.

&gt;And they'd just yawn.

&gt;&gt; ...But of course, I grew up in an era where the customer
&gt;&gt; was always right, or at was least treated as if this were so.

&gt;It was never the case and I'm likely older than you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Not that its very effective given you can just get more cards.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What is the benefit to the customer?

&gt;&gt;&gt; They continue to offer specials that wouldnt be viable to
&gt;&gt;&gt; offer if they allowed the customers to buy without any limit.

&gt;&gt; If other stores can do it, why can't they?

&gt;Its never a one size fits all world.

&gt;&gt; I don't know of any supermarkets here that use such cards.

&gt;Irrelevant. And they do exist, mostly coops.

&gt;&gt; I suspect if they did that they would lose
&gt;&gt; far more customers than they would gain.

&gt;You're wrong.

&gt;&gt; Australians have a greater sense of privacy than Americans.

&gt;You're wrong there too, particularly with ID theft.

&gt;&gt; Many consider the American habit of asking new
&gt;&gt; acquaintances what they do for a living, how much
&gt;&gt; money they make, whether they are married and have
&gt;&gt; kids, what their religious beliefs are to be fairly offensive.

&gt;Sure, but most do ask about work, kids etc.

&gt;We're just not as straight laced as yanks on marraige etc.

&gt;&gt; In the more remote areas of Australia many
&gt;&gt; people go by a nickname, or just their first name.
&gt;&gt; It is definitely impolite to ask their surname

&gt;Yes.

&gt;&gt; or where they are from.

&gt;Wrong. People do that all the time, particularly with blowins.

&gt;&gt; I've never been in England, but have heard that it
&gt;&gt; is possible to live next door to someone for years
&gt;&gt; without knowing their name or anything about them.

&gt;Its quite possible here too.

&gt;&gt; American behaviour is far more intrusive.

&gt;And far more paranoid too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why should anyone accept a card
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from a store, other than an account card?

&gt;&gt;&gt; To get the specials, stupid.

&gt;&gt; When one can get specials from other stores
&gt;&gt; that don't use the scam? Whatever for?

&gt;For the better prices.

&gt;&gt; Most store discounts are part of a deal where a
&gt;&gt; particular manufacturer offering a special deal
&gt;&gt; to a particular chain. In a given week or month Chain &quot;X&quot;
&gt;&gt; might be offered a special deal on Coca-Cola, where chain
&gt;&gt;&quot;Y&quot; might be running a special on Pepsi. Next week or month
&gt;&gt; chain &quot;X&quot; is offering Pepsi and &quot;Y&quot; is offering coke. The
&gt;&gt; consumer who prefers one over the other only need wait.

&gt;Its much more complicated than that.

&gt;&gt; Of course, if people really want to shop cheaply
&gt;&gt; they get together and buy in bulk from a wholesaler
&gt;&gt; rather than buy from retail supermarkets at all.

&gt;And those often do involve the use of cards.

&gt;&gt; So why do you call me stupid if you only buy retail? :-)

&gt;You dont know that I do.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've stopped shopping in one discount store because they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; insist on my name and address before they will accept a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; credit card. As far as I'm concerned all anyone needs is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the card number, the expiry date, and my signature on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; back of the card. This is good enough for all other stores
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where I shop, and I don't know why they are so damned nosy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Presumably so they can do something about card fraud.

&gt;&gt; Credit card companies post lists of stolen cards.

&gt;Its likely done that way to discourage crims from attempting to
&gt;use stolen cards which have not yet been reported in their store.

&gt;&gt; In addition, a retailer can always call the issuer of the
&gt;&gt; credit card to check if it is valid if they are that worried.

&gt;Doesnt help with a stolen card thats been so recently
&gt;stolen that it isnt likely to have been reported yet.

&gt;&gt; This is good enough for 99% of stores here so why should
&gt;&gt; I deal with one which insists on trying to invade my privacy?

&gt;You're always welcome to be completely paranoid and only use cash.

&gt;&gt; Why should I trust them if they don't trust me?

&gt;Why should they bother with the business of
&gt;the microscopic number as paranoid as you ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then there must be a reason for them to do so. Perhaps
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it is just an attempt to ensure customer loyalty, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; usually the &quot;sale&quot; items at any chain store are manufacturer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; promotions. Therefore, the card would seem to be a &quot;con&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't really care if they track my sales. That's their problem.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My wife loses things, so I suspect she's lost her card. They don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; care, you can just enter your phone number and that is tied to your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;account&quot;. Of course, the phone number doesn't uniquely identify
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; her, as it also is the phone number for me as well as the 3 kids.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So everytime she shops, the store thinks that it is my son.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I use my card, which has no name or address associated with it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't kid yourself. If they have your phone number,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you are trackable. Ever hear of a reverse telephone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; irectory? If you provide a listed directory number,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they will have your home address.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; None of them have ever showed up at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my place, or even posted any mail there.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And if they did, I couldnt care less.

&gt;&gt; Yes, its to encourage the customers to return to their stores.

discounts only available to card holders.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Why gather information if they have no use for it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; people calling wrong numbers, etc.
&gt;&gt; Has no effect what so ever on that.
&gt; Reduces it.

"/> Nope. Makes no difference if your number is
listed whether it gets wrong numbers or not.

What affects that is how similar your number is
to another number that can be misdialled to yours.

I normally do ask wrong number callers what number
they tried to call and tell them where they stuffed up,
basically so they can dial it correctly next time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> Nope.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why would any honest person want to bother
&gt; anyone else with unsolicited personal contact.

"/> Some do have something to sell and I have ocassionally
bought what they have to sell, usually when I have been
planning to get it and they ring before I have got off my
arse and done it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Anyone who has to use the phone book

I've ocassionally had to chase someone up in the phone book myself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Those with unlisted numbers can be a complete pain in the arse.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; One mate of mine has one, because he's an engineer with local

&gt;&gt; they have a problem with the water etc. Can cause big problems
&gt;&gt; when he moves and doesnt manage to tell everyone he wants to
&gt;&gt; about the new number soon enough. When another mate of mine
&gt;&gt; showed up in his town unexpectedly and wanted to drop in, he
&gt;&gt; couldnt even ring and ask for the new address. He's a pretty
&gt;&gt; cluey fella and resorted to ringing the real estate agents and
&gt;&gt; asked them where he'd bought his house, in Noosa. That pinned
&gt;&gt; it down very quickly but wouldnt have been easy otherwise.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So why should you refuse to allow your purchases to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be tracked? Well, it does tell a whole lot about you.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I couldnt care less. If they had some way of asking me
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without wasting my time, I'd be quite happy to tell them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And they have that info anyway from the checkout,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and in my case because I pay by plastic every time,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they can work out who it was too. I dont care.
&gt;&gt;&gt; They may be able to there, but not here. Or not easily,
&gt;&gt;&gt; anyway. Credit cards only have name, number and signature.
&gt;&gt; Wrong.
&gt; Mine do.

"/> Wrong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't know which ones you use.

"/> Same ones you do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; As mentioned in an earlier post, stopped doing business with
&gt;&gt;&gt; one discount chain because it demanded address and phone
&gt;&gt;&gt; number, which I consider none of their damned business.
&gt;&gt; Your paranoia is your problem.
&gt; Not a problem.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Tandy used to do that here and I never did get any mail from them.

And that has no relevance what so ever to whether giving
them my details ever saw them mail me anything at all anyway.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Some states in the US used to publish booklets listing

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; They dont even bother with a phone book on CD either.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; companies providing toys and other child products.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Have fun explaining how come I never get any targetted
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; advertising in the mail that I'm not sure of how it happens.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps your store doesn't sell the information,
&gt;&gt; There's plenty of stores involved.
&gt;&gt;&gt; although I still have heard no logical reason why
&gt;&gt;&gt; they should want to gather it in the first place.
&gt;&gt; I've told you more than once, you've just ignored it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

People seem to worry way too much about the &quot;ethics&quot; of shopping. You
go to the market to buy stuff at the lowest price you can; the market
is in business to sell you stuff at the highest price they can. There
are no unenforceable rules and we are not required to be &quot;nice&quot;.

New topic: Are people who refuse to open their yard sales until the
published time in spite of milling crowds and the fact that the sellers
are just standing around looking at their watches anal jerks or
fair-minded people who want to give everyone an equal shot at their
pitiful goods? Discuss among yourselves.

At least this was the case in the early years of the

input to adjust their tables, perhaps require new applicants

No; DMV will automatically mail your new placard and identification

you must file a change of address with DMV to ensure the placard will
be mailed to your most recent address. You may download the Change of
Address form (DMV 14) or contact the nearest DMV office.

The placard expires on June 30 in an odd-numbered year (2003, 2005,
etc.) and is valid for two years.

along with a few other things. As I left the store I began to think that
the total for my purchase seemed a little high. A look at the receipt
showed that I had been charged for a six pack of Gatorade and the bottle
, while it had a code, said that it was not labeled for individual sale.
The situation was rectified but I wondered how many others had been
overcharged.
A few weeks later I saw the same bottles still ready for individual
sale. If I had some more time that day I would have made a test purchase.

Or the store brand (Exact) throat lozenzes I buy. Scan the CASE, and it
comes to $10.79. Can the individual package and multiple by 20, the number
of packages in a case, and you get $9.80 (49 cents x 20). I ALWAYS have to
point this out to them. There are regularly items with cost MORE to buy in
quantity than in smaller amounts, e.g. on occasion Jumbo Special K. (unit
quantity, e.g. 1 ml or 1 gram)

does. For instance, some electronic eavesdropping devices
that have long been available over the counter in the USA
are prohibited imports here.

The question might arise that the average consumer simply
doesn't realize how much his privacy is being invaded by
such practices.

As grew up in the US, but now in Australia perhaps some of
these differences between the US and Australia are more

I don't have to. There are other stores that handle most of

&gt;This is for big-name credit cards? Odd.

"/> I thought it very odd as well. In many other stores,
including supermarkets and variety stores, can go through a
check out with a few hundred dollars worth of purchases and
the checkout clerk will ask if I wish to make a cash
withdrawal as well.

I can either use the card as a credit card or as a real time
direct debit card, what is called here &quot;EFTPOS&quot; [Electronic
Fund Transfer Point of Sale]

As mentioned in another post, the card only has my name, the
card number, the expiry date, and my signature on the back.
My signature is very seldom checked, and has been years
since anyone even looked at the back of the card.

The checkout clerk rings up the total of the purchase, adds
any cash withdrawal amount I ask for, I swipe my card
through a reader, and key in a 4 digit ID number, and
whether the account is checking or savings. When I do this
and punch &quot;enter&quot; I get back an OK on the reader and she
gets one on her display. She gives me a computer docket
showing itemized purchases and any cash I have requested.
End of story.

Technically, there is a daily withdrawal limit, but it seems
to be seldom enforced. Or perhaps just applies to cash
withdrawals, not purchases.

The store has no access to my address, phone number or any
personal details, and the issuer of my card will not provide
the store with any of this information.

I have no problems ordering items nationally or
internationally with Mastercard, and in this case they
cannot see my signature or personal ID number.
Nevertheless, they honor the card.

My international orders are usually for programs, and most
companies only have an email address for me. If dealing
with some Australian company, I could give the card number
and have a friend or acquaintance pick up the items if I
wished. I wouldn't have to provide a delivery address.

Phone calls normally display the number of the party that is
calling. However, anyone can dial a code to prevent caller
ID from showing up to the called party, or, as I do, have a
permanent block on my number from showing up to any called
party.

The only exceptions would be to emergency services who can
bypass a caller ID block.

is no surcharge for use of same, although most stores do
have a sign asking customers to not charge items under $10
or $20.

Little excuse for not carrying this much cash these days, as
ATMs [Automatic Teller Machines] are common where can easily
make cash withdrawals.

There aren't many transactions these days using cash except
for very small items. Personally, I don't think it will be
long until cash becomes just as obsolete as personal checks,
and everything is done with smartcards.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accept a card from a store, other than an account card?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 20% or more off selected items. You
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know, the loss leaders and other sale stuff.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't know any supermarket here that uses the
&gt;&gt;&gt; system. Not even sure that it would be legal to offer
&gt;&gt;&gt; discounts to some customers and not to others.
&gt;&gt; Why not? They offer quantity discounts and early-bird discounts
&gt;&gt; and 'get a free xxx if you buy two yyys' discounts, why not
&gt;&gt; discounts for &quot;members&quot;? It's not like you can be blackballed...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the card number, the expiry date, and my signature on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; back of the card. This is good enough for all other stores
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where I shop, and I don't know why they are so damned nosy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because they can get away with it.

[excerpt]
And we ask the question: is economic pressure on modern-day
workplaces and corporate culture itself helping to create a
world where psychopathic behaviour is flourishing and even
being rewarded?

Plus, stay tuned for a few tips from the experts in how to
spot a “psychopath in a suit”.
-------
The now-infamous Enron Tapes provide a good example…those
truly shocking recordings of phone conversations between the
ruthless electricity futures traders from the company. Their
skulduggery helped black out the power grid in California,
and cost the State billions of dollars.
------
But what happens when the aberrant behaviour of our leaders
becomes malignant, maybe criminal, perhaps even
psychopathic? What are the signs? And how would we know what
to do?

Easily the best person to ask is Canada’s Robert Hare. He’s
the world’s pre-eminent expert on psychopathy and a regular
advisor to the FBI. In the ‘70s, Hare developed what’s known
as the Psychopathy Checklist, or PCL, which is used as the
international standard by police and mental health
professionals to determine who qualifies as a psychopath.
He’s spent much of his working life inside prisons, studying
hardcore criminal psychopaths, mostly murderers and serial
rapists.

More recently though, he’s shifted his focus to the
workplace and has now teamed up with Paul Babiak to help
corporations identify the psychopath at work.

Robert Hare: We estimate, on the basis of some reasonably
decent data, that about 1% of the general population will
meet our criteria for psychopathy. And in the business
world, the prevalence debatably could be somewhat higher,
dependent upon the organisation. The problem for the
organisation is that only one or two of these people can do
enormous damage, particularly if they get very high up in
the organisation.

I am sorry but I can't understand how 20 feet of walking could possibly
matter so much to so many people. It's no wonder that the USDA has to
recommend walking - it's practically becoming extinct. I mean by now
walking is considered vigorous excercice and something that you can
only do in the gym wearing special equipmen like headphones and leg
warmers. I am serious, people go to the gym to walk for 30 minutes on
the threadmill. I always thought walking is a popular means of moving
your ass from point A to point B but it seems it has become such a
vigorous activity that 20 feet closer to the grocery store is
considered major privillege.

I'd have no problem with mothers having parking privilleges. I also
think granny should park closer. Anybody who wants to park as close as
they can to the door is welcome to go ahead. I always park on the
furthest side of the lot anyway - tons of space and no fat ass SUV
doors scratching my paint.

chose to be mothers. Thus they should be prepared to put up with the
inconveniences of the condition - and my experience as a parent tells me
that parking spaces are the least of it!

Does it make you feel superior to use the term &quot;gimp?&quot; Are so so lazy that
having to park a few extra spaces away because of all the &quot;gimp&quot; spaces
really ruins your day? Yes, the handicapped permits are misused by some
people, but I would much rather that a few people misuse them than someone

me

4-5
&gt; more disabled spaces allocated to those who need them - not at all. I
&gt; also don't see why an expanding definition of who needs help is a
&gt; problem. When you are writing things like &quot;even the morbidly
obese...&quot;
&gt; you are starting to judge not only the extent of their disability but
&gt; also the &quot;morality&quot; (or is it taste) of their disability - and that's
&gt; wrong. If they can't walk - they can't walk, doesn't matter why, they
&gt; need help.

"/> Great. You like walking, I like walking, even Geoff likes walking, but
Geoff's point seems to me is that by devaluing handicapped spaces from
people with serious mobility handicaps means eventually we all will be
entitled to some handicapped label (I myself have a very short temper,
and heaven help the car that snakes my parking place. Access to the
handicapped spaces would save a great deal of trouble all round). And
once everyone has their handy plastic hang-tag, those with actual
mobility issues won't be able to park conveniently close and will be
shut out of whatever shopping experience they once were privy to.

As far as judging the morbidly obese, I think we all make moral
judgements on &quot;real&quot; handicaps (infirmities of age, indignities of
veteran war service, bad luck/bad genes) and &quot;earned&quot; (or
habit-induced) ones...like morbid obesity. Doctors are shrieking about
how Americans need more exercise, how pregnant women need to get off
their butts and move a little, and yet handing someone a handicap
permit because they can't help but stuff themselves until they weigh
450 lbs and walking is //gasp// *hard work* seems enabling at the very
least.

What does that mean?

I thought you were more discreet than that. Guess not.

The &quot;qualifications&quot;, so to speak, for obtaining handicapped status are
quite well-defined and publicly available. Chicago's required
limitations, for instance, are very restrictive and highly detailed.

Is there some reason that &quot;even&quot; morbid obesity shouldn't be defined as
a handicap? Perhaps there are other conditions that accompany &quot;morbid
obesity&quot; that make the individual &quot;meet the standard&quot;, so to speak.

How about asthma? Diabetes? Heart disease? Could any of those meet your
definition of making someone a &quot;cripple&quot;? Or do you have to be terribly
scarred or in a wheelchair? What makes someone a &quot;cripple&quot; in your
opinion, Geoff?

STANDING SOLO IN THE CROWD
by Bill Bonner

Ek aur ek guyazah

A Hindi saying, meaning &quot;1 + 1 = 11&quot;

When we picked up James Surowiecki's new book, The Wisdom of Crowds, we
not only expected to be appalled; we counted on it. It is much easier
to write a review of a man's errors than it is to praise his merits.
Beyond that, we had reason to expect little. We have come to believe
that crowds are full of dumbbells and psychopaths; it would be a
nuisance to alter such a strongly held opinion at this stage in life.
What's more, we felt that the book would probably provide encouragement
to communists.

No one takes Bolshevism seriously any more. But unseriously, comically,
almost accidentally, it has taken over most of the world - including
the United States. The cost of paying retirements has been
collectivized. health care has been largely collectivized - both by
government force and by the insurance industry. Risk of all sorts -
including financial risk - have been spread out so much, no one knows
exactly how far they reach. If a man defaults on his mortgage in San
Diego, who will be the ultimate loser? It is hard to know. Risk is
collectivized. And modern corporations are hardly the exploiters and
despoilers of Marxist imagination. Au contraire, public companies are
now owned by &quot;the people&quot; - through millions of small shareholdings and
mutual funds. And they are managed in such a way that almost guarantees
that the capitalists will never make money. Dividend yields are below
2% - while the inflation rate is 3.3%. Investors take on the
dividend...even though it represents (assuming the share price remains
constant) a net annual loss of 1.3%. The capitalists no longer exploit
the proletariat, in other words. Instead, the workers exploit the
little capitalists.

As evidence for this, we give you the latest report from GM. The giant
automaker and finance house needs cash. &quot;Liquidity is oxygen to us,&quot;
said its CEO. Yet the cost of cash is going up. GM's bonds are getting
marked down to trade at junk levels after the company failed to hit
earnings targets, says the news, because its health care costs [for
employees] were higher than expected. GM, of course, is a huge
collectivity: Owned by American consumers-turned-capitalists. Operated
for the benefit of workers-turned-renters. And financed by lenders who
are beginning to regret it.

There is another reason, by the way, we were prepared to dislike
Surowiecki's book. The man had written a foolish column in The New
Yorker about gold. Not that that disqualifies him completely from
future contributions to mankind's understanding of the world around
him, but it was a bad omen.

&quot;Large groups of people are smarter than an elite few, no matter how
brilliant - better at solving problems, fostering innovation, coming to
wise decisions, even predicting the future,&quot; says the jacket cover. Did
a large group of people write Shakespeare's sonnets, we wondered? Did a
large group of people invent the beret...or crispy duck? Will a large
group of people help us fix our dishwasher?

It was, of course, a large group of people who wanted Adolf Hitler in
the Chancellor's office in Berlin. Another large group wanted to see
Mussolini in high office. And what about the multitude of yahoos who
cried out &quot;crucify him!&quot; when asked what to do with the Nazarene?

(We guessed that Surowiecki did not mean &quot;crowds&quot; at all - but
aggregated, independent individuals, putting their heads together like
Strunk and White.)

But now that we have read half the book we breathe a sigh of regret;
the book is not bad. In fact, it is delightfully misleading.

The idea of the book is that crowds are smart. We never doubted it.
&quot;Two heads are better than one,&quot; is the old expression. Actually, two
heads are often better than two. Putting people together with different
points of views, different tastes, different brains, and different
incentives actually can work a kind of magic - multiplying the talents
of the people involved. Surowiecki provides many examples. We have our
own: Laurel and Hardy. Rogers and Hammerstein. Gilbert and Sullivan.
Bogart and Bacall. Simon and Garfunckel. Antony and Cleopatra. Brad and
Jennifer. Lennon and McCarthy. Burns and Allen. Dow and Jones. Ernest
and Julio. Jagger and Richards. Scrooge and Marley. Bonnie and Clyde.
Jack and Daniels.

Ek aur ek guyazah.

Of course, this does not mean that every time you get a couple of
knuckleheads together they're going to write good music or build an
atomic bomb. Get any bunch of people you want. We will bet that we will
be better at guessing our PIN code - alone - than all of them put
together. Nor can even a hundred of the smartest men on the planet do a
better job of telling us what we want for breakfast than we can do for
ourselves. Nor do you get any extra benefit from having a group of
yes-men sitting around the table. Instead of giving you better
outcomes, they merely reinforce the moronic ideas of the group leader.
Even in decent groups, people tend to get bullied or bamboozled. Or,
they merely follow along with any idea that has the floor. This sets
off a &quot;cascade&quot; of ideas and opinions that tumbles toward an outcome -
either benign or malevolent.

Still, the Bolsheviks and syndicalists were right about one thing:
Collectives work. But the collectivists always make a mess of things
when they insist. The only collectives that work are voluntary
collectives - families, markets, communities, social groups, religious
groups, enterprises - the very things the collectivists wanted to
destroy.

None of this is particularly new. Adam Smith, Adam Ferguson...and
generations of natural philosophers and economists have worked on these
issues for many years. What is refreshing about The Wisdom of Crowds is
that Surowiecki describes what Hayek called the &quot;spontaneous order,&quot; as
if he had just discovered it. He seems astonished - and perhaps
disappointed - that people go about their daily lives and get things
done, without anyone telling them what to do. It is as if he had never
heard of culture, or trust, or fairness, or convention, or
tradition...or any of the millions and millions of small acts of
cooperation that make civilization possible. It makes the book fun to
read - it's like taking a Baptist teenager to a whorehouse; &quot;So this is
what it's all about?&quot; he asks, his face lit up and his pulse racing.

&quot;Yep,&quot; you feel like replying. &quot;What did you think?&quot;

We have only read the first half of the book, however. More to come...
Regards,

Bill Bonner

&gt;&gt;&gt; This seems like a natural reaction when you're talking about a zero sum
&gt;&gt;&gt; game. If you set aside close parking spots for one &quot;special&quot; group of
&gt;&gt;&gt; people, that means everybody else has to park further away and is
&gt;&gt;&gt; therefore worse off. So it's not that you're &quot;doing something nice for
&gt;&gt;&gt; other people&quot; but rather that you're favoring one set of people over
&gt;&gt;&gt; another, doing something nice to some and doing an equivalent not-nice
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing for others.

&gt;&gt;So, if we can't do something nice for everybody, we shouldn't do anything
&gt;&gt;nice at all?

&gt; No, that's not what I meant at all. I meant that if you do something
&gt; which helps some people and hurts other people, then you need to ask
&gt; yourself whether you're really doing &quot;something nice&quot; at all. It's
&gt; human nature that this kind of favoritism will breed resentment.

&gt; You can avoid this risk by picking situations where it's widely believed
&gt; (and true!) that the &quot;helping&quot; is essential while the &quot;hurting&quot; is minor.
&gt; This is generally the case with handicapped parking. It's not perfect --
&gt; we all know of people who game the system to get the advantages of
&gt; handicapped parking even though they don't really need it, and such people
&gt; undermine the respect of the program for those who do.

"/> None of the handicapped ever had special parking when I was a kid...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; In this case, it's certainly less clear. We were all small children
&gt; once, and when we were young grocery stores did not have special &quot;moms
&gt; with kids&quot; spots, and yet somehow we were able to get groceries and
&gt; survive.

"/> So, because nobody did it for our Mom, we shouldn't do it for anybody?

My Mom didn't have to crawl into the back seat to release me from a car
seat. I need to open my doors farther than she did. That was my original
point - it made it easier for me not to ding the heck out of the cars next
to me.

I'm not saying all stores need to have one. I just think they're nice to
have at the grocery stores, and I think it's nice that the groceries near my
old house had them. I don't understand why they make people bristle so,
when the whole logic seems to be &quot;because it isn't fair!'

Most of us even remember crossing large parking lots, and

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; while it was occasionally inconvenient or annoying it was not impossible
&gt; or life-threatening. Many people infer from this that such special spots
&gt; for moms are not essential the way they are for people with handicaps.

&gt; But I'm curious -- is there an upper bound to this &quot;nice&quot; thing you
&gt; speak of? How about if women with small children were allowed to cut to
&gt; the head of the checkout line in front of all the other customers --
&gt; that would also be &quot;something nice,&quot; right? I mean, we can't make little
&gt; kids wait in line like everybody else...

"/> Actually, the store I went to had a playroom, so I didn't have to have Jr
with me when I was in the check-out. Unfortunately, that was another little
life-perk that not everybody got to use, so it must have been a bad thing
too, I suppose.

Am I catching on now?

&gt; Yes, the posts in this thread seem to indicate that something nice that is

Cue the threads about resentment of people buying luxury food (that we
ourselves regard as too expensive) with food stamps. Same thing.

&gt; OTOH, doing something nice for one or two people should not make it more

&gt;&gt; The extra walking distance _is_ trivial, but then, it isn't the

&gt;&gt; special privileges at the expense of the majority is a matter
&gt;&gt; of principle.

&gt;&gt; The way that gimp spaces in particular always seem be on the

&gt;&gt; to pay attention to this, and I've observed that many times
&gt;&gt; when a shopping center's parking lot is repaved, it's re-
&gt;&gt; striped with more gimp spaces than were there before. I
&gt;&gt; think part of the problem is the defining up of what it is
&gt;&gt; to be handicapped. It used to literally mean &quot;crippled,&quot; but
&gt;&gt; now even the morbidly obese seem to qualify.

&gt; An important factor I believe is choice. Truly handicapped people did not
&gt; choose their condition - their paralysis, severe arthritis, broken leg, etc.
&gt; was something that was inflicted on them. Mothers, expectant or actual,
&gt; chose to be mothers. Thus they should be prepared to put up with the
&gt; inconveniences of the condition - and my experience as a parent tells me
&gt; that parking spaces are the least of it!

&gt; Does it make you feel superior to use the term &quot;gimp?&quot; Are so so lazy that
&gt; having to park a few extra spaces away because of all the &quot;gimp&quot; spaces
&gt; really ruins your day?

"/> I've been on both sides of the situation, and I tend to agree with the 'no
early birds' crowd. Unless you have a huge empty garage, and the time to set
it all up the day before behind that big closed door, you NEED that
undisturbed hour first thing in the morning to drag it all out onto the
driveway, stack/sort it into sets or by type, and price any stuff that
wasn't pre-priced already. (I hate garage sales where they basically open
the door on unpriced mounds of filthy junk, and just hang a sign saying
'make an offer'.)Having people paw through the stuff while you set up is a
big distraction, and 1 body has to be dedicated to security whenever
customers are around. (Don't scoff- shoplifting from garage sales is quite
common around here.)

My personal peeve- the free throw-away paper around here comes out on
Thursday, so people with large sales tend to run them Thurs-Sat, or even
Thurs-Fri only. Makes it hard for those of us with day jobs to see anything
other than the dregs. Showing up at closing sometimes makes for great deals.
But all that is left is stuff strange enough that nobody else wanted it.
Good thing my needs are often strange....

handicapped people parking closer, or to people who get a special line for

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This seems like a natural reaction when you're talking about a zero sum
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; game. If you set aside close parking spots for one &quot;special&quot; group of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people, that means everybody else has to park further away and is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; therefore worse off. So it's not that you're &quot;doing something nice for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other people&quot; but rather that you're favoring one set of people over
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; another, doing something nice to some and doing an equivalent not-nice
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thing for others.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So, if we can't do something nice for everybody, we shouldn't do anything
&gt;&gt;&gt;nice at all?

&gt;&gt; No, that's not what I meant at all. I meant that if you do something
&gt;&gt; which helps some people and hurts other people, then you need to ask
&gt;&gt; yourself whether you're really doing &quot;something nice&quot; at all. It's
&gt;&gt; human nature that this kind of favoritism will breed resentment.

&gt;&gt; You can avoid this risk by picking situations where it's widely believed
&gt;&gt; (and true!) that the &quot;helping&quot; is essential while the &quot;hurting&quot; is minor.
&gt;&gt; This is generally the case with handicapped parking. It's not perfect --
&gt;&gt; we all know of people who game the system to get the advantages of
&gt;&gt; handicapped parking even though they don't really need it, and such people
&gt;&gt; undermine the respect of the program for those who do.

&gt;None of the handicapped ever had special parking when I was a kid...

"/> When I was a kid, most public buildings didn't provide
access for the handicapped for that matter. Most do now,
and it is often a legal requirement these days.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; In this case, it's certainly less clear. We were all small children
&gt;&gt; once, and when we were young grocery stores did not have special &quot;moms
&gt;&gt; with kids&quot; spots, and yet somehow we were able to get groceries and
&gt;&gt; survive.

&gt;So, because nobody did it for our Mom, we shouldn't do it for anybody?

&gt;My Mom didn't have to crawl into the back seat to release me from a car
&gt;seat. I need to open my doors farther than she did. That was my original
&gt;point - it made it easier for me not to ding the heck out of the cars next
&gt;to me.

"/> Both these paragraphs make good sense to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;I'm not saying all stores need to have one. I just think they're nice to
&gt;have at the grocery stores, and I think it's nice that the groceries near my
&gt;old house had them. I don't understand why they make people bristle so,
&gt;when the whole logic seems to be &quot;because it isn't fair!'

"/> Surely you don't expect human behaviour to be logical! It

&gt;&gt; But I'm curious -- is there an upper bound to this &quot;nice&quot; thing you

&gt;&gt; the head of the checkout line in front of all the other customers --
&gt;&gt; that would also be &quot;something nice,&quot; right? I mean, we can't make little
&gt;&gt; kids wait in line like everybody else...

I suppose there are a couple of main reasons that we don't

don't want to risk injury to a child and simply cannot get
affordable liability insurance.

Then, of course, stores hate to waste space on any amenities
which can be used to display more items for sale. Some
supermarkets used to have a bin in the front of the store
where empty boxes were tossed, as well as a packing bench.

This allowed customers to pack their purchases in boxes
rather than crappy plastic bags. A definite convenience
when packing breakable items or items which may leak.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the cart and walk out of the store together, load everything into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their car, and drive home.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't see the problem here. Is there one?

&gt;&gt; They are complying with the letter of the rule, but not the spirit.
&gt;&gt; It's morally bankrupt.

&gt;&gt; As soon as that couple has kids, they'll start adding 12 additoional
&gt;&gt; items per kid to their carts in order to exploit the loophole even
&gt;&gt; further.

&gt; This is no different than when a store runs a good sale on a certain
&gt; item and limits it to 2 per customer. DH and I have taken advantage of
&gt; this by him getting his 2 separate from my 2. Since we end up with 4 of
&gt; the item rather than 2, it saves us the gas and inconvience of a second
&gt; trip. If it is something we really need a lot of we may make another
&gt; trip or two and do the same thing. IMO, this is maximizing your resources.

"/> Within reason, I'm in favor of this and do it myself. I use the
self-checkout lane and just do separate transactions. When there is plenty
of an item on the shelf and there is a set limit, but it's something I use
often enough to want to stock up, I might bring have a friend come along and
pick up, or I might do it in separate transactions. If it's for personal
use, I have no problem with it. I also have no problem when it's for some
sort of philantropy....like when I collected money from my coworkers for a
food drive and scanned 9 turkeys as separate transactions so we could donate
them to a food drive. there was a limit of 1 turkey at the sale price, we
could have only bought 5 if I had followed the rules.

If someone is stocking up to resell it somehow, I have a huge problem with
it. That's not really a factor with groceries, but I remember someone (was
it Dimitri?) telling a tale of a close out store having a great deal on
Kitchen Aid mixers before Christmas, limit of one per person, and he and his
son-in-law went to buy mixers for 2 people as gifts, and there was a woman
and 3 adult &quot;henchman&quot; who were there to snatch up mixers, and they were
bragging about selling them on ebay. That really annoys me.

There was a Ralph Lauren duvet cover I wanted, that has been discontinued by
the manufacturer for years and is very hard to find, it can only be found in
outlet stores and on ebay. Well...there were several on Ebay, but they were
listed at $90 and up. Plus shipping! I knew I had seen them at the outlet
stores for about $50. So I called my closest outlet, they didn't have a
full/queen. But they gave me a phone number to call, which could locate one
anywhere in the country. They found one in Columbus, Georgia! They
transferred me to the store in GA, who took my credit card over the phone,
honored my 15% coupon that I got via email from my local Westpoint Stevens
outlet store, added in the CT state sales tax and the shipping was only $8.
It was on special for $49.99. The coupon covered my tax and shipping, and
then some. And I got what I wanted for a reasonable price.

&gt;&gt; You can avoid this risk by picking situations where it's widely believed
&gt;&gt; (and true!) that the &quot;helping&quot; is essential while the &quot;hurting&quot; is minor.
&gt;&gt; This is generally the case with handicapped parking. It's not perfect --
&gt;&gt; we all know of people who game the system to get the advantages of
&gt;&gt; handicapped parking even though they don't really need it, and such people
&gt;&gt; undermine the respect of the program for those who do.

&gt;None of the handicapped ever had special parking when I was a kid...

"/> Ah, the good old days, when the handicapped people stayed in their homes
or in institutions or someplace else out of sight.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; In this case, it's certainly less clear. We were all small children
&gt;&gt; once, and when we were young grocery stores did not have special &quot;moms
&gt;&gt; with kids&quot; spots, and yet somehow we were able to get groceries and
&gt;&gt; survive.

&gt;So, because nobody did it for our Mom, we shouldn't do it for anybody?

"/> Yes, that's an accurate summary of what I said. &lt;rolls eyes&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;My Mom didn't have to crawl into the back seat to release me from a car
&gt;seat. I need to open my doors farther than she did. That was my original
&gt;point - it made it easier for me not to ding the heck out of the cars next
&gt;to me.

"/> Lots of people need to get items in and out of back seats, not just
babies. Maybe we should have special parking for &quot;backseat cargo
haulers.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But I'm curious -- is there an upper bound to this &quot;nice&quot; thing you
&gt;&gt; speak of? How about if women with small children were allowed to cut to
&gt;&gt; the head of the checkout line in front of all the other customers --
&gt;&gt; that would also be &quot;something nice,&quot; right? I mean, we can't make little
&gt;&gt; kids wait in line like everybody else...

&gt;Actually, the store I went to had a playroom, so I didn't have to have Jr
&gt;with me when I was in the check-out. Unfortunately, that was another little
&gt;life-perk that not everybody got to use, so it must have been a bad thing
&gt;too, I suppose.

"/> I note that you avoided answering the question. Yes, I remember those;
I assumed they went away because parents were dumping their kids there
and leaving the store to run other errands. There also could be liability
issues or discipline problems. Or maybe it was just more cost-effective
to use the space and employee time for other things.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Am I catching on now?

"/> Apparently not. Does the existence of the playroom cause inconvenience
to people who don't use it? If not then it's not analogous to special
parking spaces.

&gt;&gt; Because it's a common practice among sharp garage/yard/rummage sale

I'm not questioning the right of the seller to set his opening time;
what I am doing is saying that sticking to the nominal start time when
the sellers are ready and the crowds have gathered is stupid.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've seen couples do the equivalent thing. The woman will pull 12

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the cart and pays for them. Then they put all the grocery bags into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the cart and walk out of the store together, load everything into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their car, and drive home.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't see the problem here. Is there one?

&gt;&gt;&gt; They are complying with the letter of the rule, but not the spirit.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's morally bankrupt.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As soon as that couple has kids, they'll start adding 12 additoional
&gt;&gt;&gt; items per kid to their carts in order to exploit the loophole even
&gt;&gt;&gt; further.

&gt;&gt; This is no different than when a store runs a good sale on a certain
&gt;&gt; item and limits it to 2 per customer. DH and I have taken advantage of
&gt;&gt; this by him getting his 2 separate from my 2. Since we end up with 4 of
&gt;&gt; the item rather than 2, it saves us the gas and inconvience of a second
&gt;&gt; trip. If it is something we really need a lot of we may make another
&gt;&gt; trip or two and do the same thing. IMO, this is maximizing your resources.

&gt;Within reason, I'm in favor of this and do it myself. I use the
&gt;self-checkout lane and just do separate transactions. When there is plenty
&gt;of an item on the shelf and there is a set limit, but it's something I use
&gt;often enough to want to stock up, I might bring have a friend come along and
&gt;pick up, or I might do it in separate transactions. If it's for personal
&gt;use, I have no problem with it. I also have no problem when it's for some
&gt;sort of philantropy....like when I collected money from my coworkers for a
&gt;food drive and scanned 9 turkeys as separate transactions so we could donate
&gt;them to a food drive. there was a limit of 1 turkey at the sale price, we
&gt;could have only bought 5 if I had followed the rules.

&gt;If someone is stocking up to resell it somehow, I have a huge problem with
&gt;it. That's not really a factor with groceries, but I remember someone (was
&gt;it Dimitri?) telling a tale of a close out store having a great deal on
&gt;Kitchen Aid mixers before Christmas, limit of one per person, and he and his
&gt;son-in-law went to buy mixers for 2 people as gifts, and there was a woman
&gt;and 3 adult &quot;henchman&quot; who were there to snatch up mixers, and they were
&gt;bragging about selling them on ebay. That really annoys me.

&gt;There was a Ralph Lauren duvet cover I wanted, that has been discontinued by
&gt;the manufacturer for years and is very hard to find, it can only be found in
&gt;outlet stores and on ebay. Well...there were several on Ebay, but they were
&gt;listed at $90 and up. Plus shipping! I knew I had seen them at the outlet
&gt;stores for about $50. So I called my closest outlet, they didn't have a
&gt;full/queen. But they gave me a phone number to call, which could locate one
&gt;anywhere in the country. They found one in Columbus, Georgia! They
&gt;transferred me to the store in GA, who took my credit card over the phone,
&gt;honored my 15% coupon that I got via email from my local Westpoint Stevens
&gt;outlet store, added in the CT state sales tax and the shipping was only $8.
&gt;It was on special for $49.99. The coupon covered my tax and shipping, and
&gt;then some. And I got what I wanted for a reasonable price.

"/> Well I used to be a cashier and boy could I tell some stories. I
especially like the ones that have to do with the &quot;12 items or less&quot;
register and how people come with way more than that!

I have also seen customers come in just to &quot;pick up a few things&quot; and
who ever it is they are riding with will come into the store fuming
because the person is taking too long.

Of course there are incidents where people are nice too (-:

&gt;&gt;&gt;gourmet chocolates and adult sex toys.

&gt;&gt; I disagree. I would much rather see the brats confined to a
&gt;&gt; play area rather than run amok in the supermarket. If no
&gt;&gt; play area is provided the store should require children
&gt;&gt; under a certain age to be confined on short leashes to limit
&gt;&gt; damage to stock and to limit annoyance to other customers.

&gt; Back when I was a kid, a common sight in the grocery store was the
&gt; little red plastic calculator. It had several buttons across the top,
&gt; and a series of little holes across the front. Inside were small
&gt; numbered dials that would turn when the buttons were pressed, causing
&gt; one of the numbers to be visible in each of the holes. There was one
&gt; button/dial/window for the penny, dime, dollar, and ten-dollar decimal
&gt; places. When placing an item into your cart, one would press the
&gt; buttons corresponding to the price. A 59 cent item would result in 5
&gt; presses of the dimes button and 9 presses of the pennies button. The
&gt; machine would accumulate the button presses and the total would appear
&gt; in the little windows.

&gt; This was, of course, in the days before pocket calculators. ;)

&gt; Anyway, these days it seems that people are, in general, a lot lazier
&gt; than they used to be.

item/shelf is the price you pay at the register. I've wondered at times
how easy it is to do when the sales tax is added at the register, which

"/> It differs from state to state. Here in Indiana, there isn't sales tax
on groceries, except for soda pop and candy. And ready-to-eat foods
from the deli counter, such as complete sandwiches, although that does
vary sometimes, depending on what the ready-to-eat food is.

Sales tax applies to any non-food purchases at the grocery store, for
things like plastic wrap and magazines. The sales tax is 6%, so it's
pretty easy to figure out how much will be due if you're keeping track
of what you're buying.

Well, I have to confess Rhonda you are a marvel - I would love to be able to
add up as I shop, but find the multiple calculations that I have to force my
aging brain to do as I shop drives a total right out of my mind - do I buy
coffee on special at 9.99 for 250 grams? or the other special of 500grams
for 18.99, or the not on special of 150 grams for 7.89? or I could buy 5x 50
grams at 1.96 each? ...and that is an easy one!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've seen couples do the equivalent thing. The woman will pull 12

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;aisle waiting while her boyfriend pulls the remaining 12 items out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the cart and pays for them. Then they put all the grocery bags into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the cart and walk out of the store together, load everything into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their car, and drive home.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't see the problem here. Is there one?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are complying with the letter of the rule, but not the spirit.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's morally bankrupt.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As soon as that couple has kids, they'll start adding 12 additoional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;items per kid to their carts in order to exploit the loophole even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;further.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is no different than when a store runs a good sale on a certain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;item and limits it to 2 per customer. DH and I have taken advantage of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this by him getting his 2 separate from my 2. Since we end up with 4 of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the item rather than 2, it saves us the gas and inconvience of a second
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;trip. If it is something we really need a lot of we may make another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;trip or two and do the same thing. IMO, this is maximizing your resources.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Within reason, I'm in favor of this and do it myself. I use the
&gt;&gt;&gt;self-checkout lane and just do separate transactions. When there is plenty
&gt;&gt;&gt;of an item on the shelf and there is a set limit, but it's something I use
&gt;&gt;&gt;often enough to want to stock up, I might bring have a friend come along and
&gt;&gt;&gt;pick up, or I might do it in separate transactions. If it's for personal
&gt;&gt;&gt;use, I have no problem with it. I also have no problem when it's for some
&gt;&gt;&gt;sort of philantropy....like when I collected money from my coworkers for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;food drive and scanned 9 turkeys as separate transactions so we could donate
&gt;&gt;&gt;them to a food drive. there was a limit of 1 turkey at the sale price, we
&gt;&gt;&gt;could have only bought 5 if I had followed the rules.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If someone is stocking up to resell it somehow, I have a huge problem with
&gt;&gt;&gt;it. That's not really a factor with groceries, but I remember someone (was
&gt;&gt;&gt;it Dimitri?) telling a tale of a close out store having a great deal on
&gt;&gt;&gt;Kitchen Aid mixers before Christmas, limit of one per person, and he and his
&gt;&gt;&gt;son-in-law went to buy mixers for 2 people as gifts, and there was a woman
&gt;&gt;&gt;and 3 adult &quot;henchman&quot; who were there to snatch up mixers, and they were
&gt;&gt;&gt;bragging about selling them on ebay. That really annoys me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;There was a Ralph Lauren duvet cover I wanted, that has been discontinued by
&gt;&gt;&gt;the manufacturer for years and is very hard to find, it can only be found in
&gt;&gt;&gt;outlet stores and on ebay. Well...there were several on Ebay, but they were
&gt;&gt;&gt;listed at $90 and up. Plus shipping! I knew I had seen them at the outlet
&gt;&gt;&gt;stores for about $50. So I called my closest outlet, they didn't have a
&gt;&gt;&gt;full/queen. But they gave me a phone number to call, which could locate one
&gt;&gt;&gt;anywhere in the country. They found one in Columbus, Georgia! They
&gt;&gt;&gt;transferred me to the store in GA, who took my credit card over the phone,
&gt;&gt;&gt;honored my 15% coupon that I got via email from my local Westpoint Stevens
&gt;&gt;&gt;outlet store, added in the CT state sales tax and the shipping was only $8.
&gt;&gt;&gt;It was on special for $49.99. The coupon covered my tax and shipping, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;then some. And I got what I wanted for a reasonable price.

&gt;&gt; Well I used to be a cashier and boy could I tell some stories. I
&gt;&gt; especially like the ones that have to do with the &quot;12 items or less&quot;
&gt;&gt; register and how people come with way more than that!

&gt;&gt; I have also seen customers come in just to &quot;pick up a few things&quot; and
&gt;&gt; who ever it is they are riding with will come into the store fuming
&gt;&gt; because the person is taking too long.

&gt;&gt; Of course there are incidents where people are nice too (-:

&gt;&gt; Grant Basics 101!

&gt;Yesterday I got stuck behind a pair of those morons who can only buy
&gt;what they have cash in their pocket for, get too much and have to have
&gt;items removed *one by one* until they get down to an amount they can pay
&gt;for. If I knew I had only so much cash to spend, I'd be totalling my
&gt;take before I got to the checkout but I guess that never ocurred to
&gt;these dweebs.

&gt;Linda C.

"/> Haven't seen that one for years here in Australia. Paying
cash is becoming pretty rare, as most people use credit
cards for either credit or identification for direct cash
transfer [EFTPOS].

Certainly can think of very little excuse for their
behaviour. Can get pocket calculators here for around A$2,
which would be roughly $US 1.50.

Surely they can afford one of these and learn to run it? Am
surprised that the supermarket puts up with such ignorant
behaviour, especially since they have to replace the excess
back on the shelves.

Were I setting store policy they would be told to go put the
items back until they were sure they could afford what they
are selecting.

Of course, they might be offended enough that they refuse to
shop there in the future, but does any store really need
such customers? After all, they annoy other customers who
refuse to tolerate such crap and are likely to take their
business elsewhere.

Stores have regular lanes and fast lanes. Perhaps they
should consider a slow lane for people who are so obsessive
that they search through their pockets or purse for exact
change rather than tendering a note large enough to more
than cover the purchase. People using personal checks
should also be required to use this slow lane, as these
people slow up transactions as well.

Personally, I don't think it will be all that long before
governments do away with cash altogether, replacing them
with smart cards for all purchases. This was done at the
Atlanta Olympics and has been tried in other places. IMHO,
it cannot happen soon enough. It would eliminate a lot of
crime.

I am sorry, are we trying to create a complete list of human pettiness
that can possibly occur in the general vicinity of a grocery store. So
far, we have the following supreme examples of extrme pettiness:

1. Kids misbehaving\talking\not talking\eating\generally-being-kids are
irritating\disgusting\unschooled
2. Moms with kids are parking-space-hawking\rude\children-bearing
creatures
3. The disabled are
parking-space-hawking\disability-faking\morbidly-obese
special-status-abusers who occasionnally also double up as pregnant
women with kids (see #1 and #2)
4. Express-line cheating fellons are not unlike serial killers who get
out of jail on a technicality
5. Arithmetically and financially challanged people are dweebes
6. Food-stamp-recepients are french-cheese-munching leeches

It is a very good start and an incredibly productive discussion (522
posts and running) with some outstanding and very crteative
contributions - it never occured to me that some of those things can be
irritating.

Should we maybe add:

- All people who buy food we would never buy?
- All foreigners - shouldn't they learn proper English and go to their
enthnic shops in the first place. Plus I am sure they are speaking
about me behind my back in their impossible la-la-language?
- All people who buy too many items and block the line for like 5
minutes?
- All the people who buy too few items just so they can sneak throuhg
the express line?
- All people who pay with a check
- All people who pay with a credit card (groceries on credit !!!!) -
either white thrash or trying to cheat the poor airline into giving
them miles
- All people who ask for checkout help
- All people who have questions
- All married people who keep parading the fact that they are married
while we are not?
- All people who are not married but keep parading their girlfriends
and boyfriends while even our dog ran away?
- All people who buy frozen dinners instead of going to French
restaurants
- All people who are poor - that's deffinetely their fault
- All people who are rich - can't they order catering instead of
further crowding the supermarket?
- In general all the people who are not me - there is something wrong
with everyone who's not me (and the feeling is reciprocated).

&gt;&gt;&gt; have a certain amount of cash on me and don't want to pay in a different
&gt;&gt;&gt; manner.I make it a habit to tally as I go, either using a calculator if I
&gt;&gt;&gt; remembered to throw one in my bag, or using it as an exercise in mental
&gt;&gt;&gt; arithmetic. That way I don't get a shock at the cash register - sometimes

&gt;&gt;&gt; One thing - it's easy enough here to add up as you go as the GST (Goods &amp;

Both policy and rate(s) vary considerably from state to state. Some
states give the merchant options, so it can in theory differ from store
to store. Massachusetts has a relatively simple general 5% sales and use
tax, yet there are still two possibilities. As a merchant I may show
the price of an item as $1.00 and invoice you for $1.00 plus a tax of $0.05
provided the tax is clearly and separately itemized as such. I then remit
that tax to the state. Alternately, I may show the price of an item as
$1.00 and charge you only $1.00 for the item. I must still remit $0.05
to the state. This is rarely done, but it is not unheard of. I may _not_
show the price of an item as $1.05, remit $0.05 to the state, and keep
$1.00 for myself.

There are special cases relating both to the type of merchandise and to
the type of transaction.

Massachusetts does not tax sales of unprepared foods, but they do have
a meals tax which is coincidentally also 5%. Thus while most food at
a grocery store would not be taxed, a prepared sandwich would be. Some
items (e.g., a cooked chicken) are sufficiently ambiguous that I couldn't
say whether they are taxed or not--and I think I've seen it go both ways.

Massachusetts does not tax clothing unless the cost is over a certain
threshold that makes it a &quot;luxury item.&quot;

Massachusetts does not tax certain products used in agriculture. A bag of
lime is never taxed even if purchased at retail by a consumer, though a bag
of fertilizer that could be used on a lawn may be taxed. Some pesticides
are not taxed at all, some seem to be taxed only in lower concentrations,
and some are taxed in all forms.

Massachusetts does not tax sales for resale (that's pretty standard) but
they also do not tax sales of certain components that would otherwise be
taxable if those components are to become part of certain manufacturering
equipment. This latter has its own line item on the sales/use tax return.

(I leaving out the rules for coupons and other discounts which recently
changed to be both less taxing and more complicated.)

In spite of the relative simplicity of Massachusetts's sales/use tax, pros
still seem to get it wrong. I've had company accounting departments refuse
to pay me sales tax because they are incorporated and &quot;don't pay sales tax
on anything.&quot; Being unable to justify that position they switch to an
argument that they don't pay sales tax because they have a resale certificate.
Only when I point out that they really shouldn't be reselling the (explicitly)
non-transferable license do they relent...

Other states have more complicated systems including city/local sales taxes
that add to the state rate. I don't know if there are any states that allow
local jurisdictions to define the taxability of a transaction for local
purposes differently from the state, but I wouldn't be surprised if they can
at least exempt items in cases where the entire local tax is optional for
the locality.

For years there have been rumblings about simplification/unification of state
sales/use tax systems so that the federal government can enact legislation
requiring all sellers to collect tax from customers in all states without a
horrible political backlash. It's going to be interesting to see whether
states/localities will be willing to give up their special cases in return for
additional revenues that may turn out to be part of a larger zero-sum game.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've seen couples do the equivalent thing. The woman will pull 12
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;items out of the cart, pay for them, and then stand at the end of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;aisle waiting while her boyfriend pulls the remaining 12 items out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the cart and pays for them. Then they put all the grocery bags into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the cart and walk out of the store together, load everything into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their car, and drive home.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't see the problem here. Is there one?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are complying with the letter of the rule, but not the spirit.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's morally bankrupt.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As soon as that couple has kids, they'll start adding 12 additoional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;items per kid to their carts in order to exploit the loophole even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;further.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is no different than when a store runs a good sale on a certain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;item and limits it to 2 per customer. DH and I have taken advantage of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this by him getting his 2 separate from my 2. Since we end up with 4 of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the item rather than 2, it saves us the gas and inconvience of a second
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;trip. If it is something we really need a lot of we may make another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;trip or two and do the same thing. IMO, this is maximizing your resources.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Within reason, I'm in favor of this and do it myself. I use the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;self-checkout lane and just do separate transactions. When there is plenty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of an item on the shelf and there is a set limit, but it's something I use
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;often enough to want to stock up, I might bring have a friend come along and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pick up, or I might do it in separate transactions. If it's for personal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;use, I have no problem with it. I also have no problem when it's for some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sort of philantropy....like when I collected money from my coworkers for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;food drive and scanned 9 turkeys as separate transactions so we could donate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;them to a food drive. there was a limit of 1 turkey at the sale price, we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;could have only bought 5 if I had followed the rules.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If someone is stocking up to resell it somehow, I have a huge problem with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it. That's not really a factor with groceries, but I remember someone (was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it Dimitri?) telling a tale of a close out store having a great deal on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kitchen Aid mixers before Christmas, limit of one per person, and he and his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;son-in-law went to buy mixers for 2 people as gifts, and there was a woman
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and 3 adult &quot;henchman&quot; who were there to snatch up mixers, and they were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bragging about selling them on ebay. That really annoys me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There was a Ralph Lauren duvet cover I wanted, that has been discontinued by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the manufacturer for years and is very hard to find, it can only be found in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;outlet stores and on ebay. Well...there were several on Ebay, but they were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;listed at $90 and up. Plus shipping! I knew I had seen them at the outlet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stores for about $50. So I called my closest outlet, they didn't have a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;full/queen. But they gave me a phone number to call, which could locate one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anywhere in the country. They found one in Columbus, Georgia! They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;transferred me to the store in GA, who took my credit card over the phone,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;honored my 15% coupon that I got via email from my local Westpoint Stevens
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;outlet store, added in the CT state sales tax and the shipping was only $8.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It was on special for $49.99. The coupon covered my tax and shipping, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;then some. And I got what I wanted for a reasonable price.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well I used to be a cashier and boy could I tell some stories. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;especially like the ones that have to do with the &quot;12 items or less&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;register and how people come with way more than that!

&gt;&gt;&gt;I have also seen customers come in just to &quot;pick up a few things&quot; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;who ever it is they are riding with will come into the store fuming
&gt;&gt;&gt;because the person is taking too long.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course there are incidents where people are nice too (-:

&gt;&gt;&gt;Grant Basics 101!

&gt;&gt;Yesterday I got stuck behind a pair of those morons who can only buy
&gt;&gt;what they have cash in their pocket for, get too much and have to have
&gt;&gt;items removed *one by one* until they get down to an amount they can pay
&gt;&gt;for. If I knew I had only so much cash to spend, I'd be totalling my
&gt;&gt;take before I got to the checkout but I guess that never ocurred to
&gt;&gt;these dweebs.

&gt;&gt;Linda C.

&gt; Haven't seen that one for years here in Australia. Paying
&gt; cash is becoming pretty rare, as most people use credit
&gt; cards for either credit or identification for direct cash
&gt; transfer [EFTPOS].

&gt; Certainly can think of very little excuse for their
&gt; behaviour. Can get pocket calculators here for around A$2,
&gt; which would be roughly $US 1.50.

&gt; Surely they can afford one of these and learn to run it? Am
&gt; surprised that the supermarket puts up with such ignorant
&gt; behaviour, especially since they have to replace the excess
&gt; back on the shelves.

&gt; Were I setting store policy they would be told to go put the
&gt; items back until they were sure they could afford what they
&gt; are selecting.

&gt; Of course, they might be offended enough that they refuse to
&gt; shop there in the future, but does any store really need
&gt; such customers? After all, they annoy other customers who
&gt; refuse to tolerate such crap and are likely to take their
&gt; business elsewhere.

&gt; Stores have regular lanes and fast lanes. Perhaps they
&gt; should consider a slow lane for people who are so obsessive
&gt; that they search through their pockets or purse for exact
&gt; change rather than tendering a note large enough to more
&gt; than cover the purchase. People using personal checks
&gt; should also be required to use this slow lane, as these
&gt; people slow up transactions as well.

&gt; Personally, I don't think it will be all that long before
&gt; governments do away with cash altogether, replacing them
&gt; with smart cards for all purchases. This was done at the
&gt; Atlanta Olympics and has been tried in other places. IMHO,
&gt; it cannot happen soon enough. It would eliminate a lot of
&gt; crime.

&gt; Regards,
&gt;&quot;Nilkids&quot;

"/> This is the first instance of this I've seen in awhile. Most customers
do the swipe thing unless they're buying a magazine and a six-pack with
cash. I do cash for small amounts (like under $20) but swipe it for more
than that. It's just faster and easier.

&gt;of the store without buying anything.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> Does Terry consider that if it wasn't for stupid union rules
the store management, office workers, or even the &quot;grunts&quot;
on their &quot;break&quot; could perhaps man the registers when
necessary?

My advice is to take it up with your management or your
union. Customer behaviour is not predictable.

For instance, suppose the scheduled break is from 1000 to
1030. Maybe some idiot on a radio station has suggested
that there is a shortage of toilet paper or something, so
everyone mobs the store at this period.

OK, so what? What is so sacred about that time period?
Can't it be deferred until later in order to deal with the
crush? Cannot the union understand that it is better for
all concerned that the customers be kept happy?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and that cold items might spoil, so Nilkids is also
&gt;committing the sin of wasting food?

"/> Nope, not a sin, or even a problem. If the market management
is efficient someone will replace the items on the shelves
and in the coolers or freezers. The stock clerks usual job,
but if necessary the manager himself can do it.

If he or his employees are so incompetent that they cannot
deal with such a simple problem, I feel sorry for all
concerned.

However, basically not my problem. A retailer exists to
serve the customers. If they cannot do this in a
satisfactory manner, then perhaps they lose out to another
retailer who can somehow manage to do so.

Do you really think that if a clerk is promoted to a
management position that he or she insists on following
union rules?

In my experience, most people in management work harder and
longer hours than many of their employees, and if I was in
the position of supermarket manager any employee who refused
to volunteer to help in a problem situation might not last
very long.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;A good store policy would have the security guard stop Nilkids at the
&gt;door, and either force him to restock the items in his cart, make him
&gt;pay for items which could spoil if left in the cart, or arrest him.

"/> Nope, no legal justification for any of the above. The
items all belong to the store until I clear the checkout.
There is no legal obligation forcing me to purchase any of
them. Just what charge do you think I am going to be
arrested on?

On the other hand, I would have both civil and criminal
grounds for false arrest, in Australia at least. Perhaps
you should review your knowledge of the law?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Not being able to pay for selected items can happen to anyone. Once I
&gt;didn't realize I didn't have my debit/ATM card with me, and didn't have
&gt;enough cash to pay for everything (was short by about $5),

"/> Um, well, my question would be why you didn't have one or
more acceptable cards with you unless you had lost your
wallet, in which case you probably wouldn't have any
currency either.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;and the store doesn't take checks.

"/> Nor should they.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I apologized, quickly selected the items I
&gt;could do without (all non-cold items in boxes), and offered to put them
&gt;back where they belonged. The clerk declined my offer and simply
&gt;&quot;unscanned&quot; the items. The extra time caused by my mistake was less
&gt;than a minute.

"/> OK, has never happened to me, but sounds fair enough. I
once had a store scanner refuse to accept a credit/debit
card, perhaps due to a malfunction of their scanner or some
magnetic defect on the card I was using.

I could have used another credit/debit card but was curious
what their problem was, so asked my wife to use hers. It
worked. Therefore, obviously a problem with my particular
card or their scanner, so didn't have to criticize my bank,
just the supermarket for their obviously defective scanner.

Incidentally, my card worked fine in other stores later, so
it was the fault of their scanner.

So what if my wife hadn't been with me at the time? Then I
would have invited them to unplug their faulty card scanner
and substitute it with a spare, or one for an inactive
checkout?

If they weren't prepared to do this, then I probably would
have shrugged, said &quot;your problem&quot;, and walked away.

Why should customers have to put up with incompetence?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;It takes much longer than a minute for store workers to deal with an
&gt;abandoned cart.

"/> I would hope so, otherwise no point in making the protest.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;During the California grocery strike/lockouts, commie union LIE-BRAWL
&gt;scum encouraged a-holes to invade the grocery stores and load up carts
&gt;with items, abandon the carts, and walk out to inconvenience the &quot;scab&quot;
&gt;workers and to cost the store huge amounts of money.

"/> This is a dispute between management and labor, and the
customers shouldn't have to be involved. Perhaps the store
should have employed more scab labor. Or paid their existing
employees more so that there wouldn't have been a strike in
the first place.

In any case, though, if a store wants to stay in business,
and the employees want to stay employed, then strikes and
lockouts are problems between the store and its employees.

Customers shouldn't have to be involved. However, if they
wish to, they can be. Everyone has free will. If they
support the strikers, then they shouldn't be shopping at the
store at all and will not have to suffer much inconvenience
by the strike.

On the other hand if they expect service from the store, not
give a damn about the strikers, and should expect service
whatever the store has to do to provide it. Even if the
store has to import union members from other states, hire
more scabs, or run the stores with management staff.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If I were in
&gt;charge of those California stores, I would have all cart-abandoners
&gt;arrested.

"/> On what charge? AFIK, they are doing nothing illegal at
all. On the store side of the checkout, all items are the
property of the store.

If tried to require customer &quot;A&quot; to be responisble for all
items in his or her cart on the store side of the checkout,
then how you would you handle siatuations where other
customers &quot;B&quot; or children &quot;C&quot; accidentally or deliberately
added items to a cart used by &quot;A&quot;.

Are you so ignorant of the law that you think that you can
require &quot;A&quot; to return these items to the shelves? Let alone
to the proper locations?

You can request them to, but can you demand them to? I
doubt it.

Um, if it were possible to legally charge protesters from
abandoning carts full of groceries, don't you think that the
management of your supermarket chain would have thought of
this?

If so, you must grossly underestimate managers in any
orginizations who tend to plan for any possible emergencies
and are probably judged on how they do so.

Of course, am just guessing on this. Am not a supermarket
manager. However, these days, I would expect anyone in a
management position in any field from the government,
military, nuclear plants, emergency services etc. even down
to the level of supermarkets to have emergency plans.

My apology if have disturbed your complacency, as there were
better plans in the USA more than 40 years ago.

However, I don't suppose you would have ever heard of
them....

&quot;nilkids&quot;

&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; people with children get special parking, or that those who have no kids
&gt;&gt; should voluntary park farther away so the close spots would stay
&gt;&gt; available. I have never seen special parking for people with kids or
&gt;&gt; older folks. I have only seen handicapped parking.

&gt; I've never seen a parking space for moms whose kids are already born. I
&gt; have seen them for pregnant mothers. In SC they called it &quot;Stork Parking.&quot;
&gt; They are not handicapped spaces, but they are the next space over from
&gt; them,
&gt; there is usually 2-4 per parking lot.

"/> I still don't understand why successfully completing a fuck should afford

&gt;&gt; Do you really think that if a clerk is promoted to a
&gt;&gt; management position that he or she insists on following
&gt;&gt; union rules?

&gt; Managers are no longer in the union and become -- by definition --
&gt; adversaries.

&gt;&gt; In my experience, most people in management work harder and
&gt;&gt; longer hours than many of their employees, and if I was in
&gt;&gt; the position of supermarket manager any employee who refused
&gt;&gt; to volunteer to help in a problem situation might not last
&gt;&gt; very long.

&gt; So you'd ask employees to contribute their own time because of a
&gt; crunch? Most states have laws forbidding work without pay, and I
&gt; think WalMart is in deep shit for making employees work off the clock.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;During the California grocery strike/lockouts, commie union LIE-BRAWL
&gt;&gt;&gt;scum encouraged a-holes to invade the grocery stores and load up carts
&gt;&gt;&gt;with items, abandon the carts, and walk out to inconvenience the &quot;scab&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;workers and to cost the store huge amounts of money.

&gt;&gt; This is a dispute between management and labor, and the
&gt;&gt; customers shouldn't have to be involved. Perhaps the store
&gt;&gt; should have employed more scab labor. Or paid their existing
&gt;&gt; employees more so that there wouldn't have been a strike in
&gt;&gt; the first place.

&gt; Customers' and scabs' cars were keyed. Some were beaten. Top pay for a
&gt; grocery checker was ~$18US/hour at the time. Anybody here think it
&gt; takes more than a morning to learn how to run a cash register? The jobs
&gt; aren't worth much more than minimum wage and they're getting excellent
&gt; pay PLUS benefits.

&gt; During the strike they were paying the scabs, including my grandson,
&gt; $18/hour.

&gt;&gt; In any case, though, if a store wants to stay in business,
&gt;&gt; and the employees want to stay employed, then strikes and
&gt;&gt; lockouts are problems between the store and its employees.

&gt;&gt; Customers shouldn't have to be involved. However, if they
&gt;&gt; wish to, they can be. Everyone has free will. If they
&gt;&gt; support the strikers, then they shouldn't be shopping at the
&gt;&gt; store at all and will not have to suffer much inconvenience
&gt;&gt; by the strike.

&gt; The news mentioned that a picket-line-crossing customer was beaten up by
&gt; the strikers. My MIL, who weighs perhaps 110 pounds soaking wet and
&gt; whose 1/4-mile walk to the market took over an hour when she could do it
&gt; at all, apologized to the strikers because she had to eat and that was
&gt; the closest store. She was actually afraid that they might hit her.

&gt; --
&gt; Cheers,

&gt;&gt;&gt;Nope, not a sin, or even a problem. If the market management

&gt;&gt;their livelihood.

&gt;&gt;&gt;However, basically not my problem. A retailer exists to
&gt;&gt;&gt;serve the customers. If they cannot do this in a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yep, you watch if any jury buys the lies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Paying 50 million dollars is not &quot;deep shit&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ancient history. And doesnt qualify as IS IN deep shit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You have personal knowledge that the claims are lies?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Plenty of time for the jurys to have decided,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that pack of union lies just presents their lies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Care to explain the guilty verdict?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just one verdict. Doesnt qualify as DEEP SHIT.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Only an independently wealthy entrepreneur like little Rod can think that $50
&gt;&gt;&gt;million is not &quot;deep shit&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Like I said, ancient history doesnt qualify as IS IN deep shit, obese
&gt;&gt; fuckwit.

&gt;&gt; That ONE jury verdict didnt produce a $50M judgement, liar.
&gt; %0 million is 50 million, little boy.

Thats nothing like DEEP SHIT, and is in fact not even shit if they
came out significantly ahead on the hundreds of millions those
union bludgers claim that they saved in wages over that time.

&gt;&gt; Name the union, little boy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Have proof of the lies that you claim the jury believed?

&gt;&gt;&gt;You're lying again. I said no such thing.

&gt;&gt;Look above, little boy.

&gt; Completely useless, obscenely obese fuckwit.

&gt;&gt;You said a &quot;Pack of union lies&quot;.

&gt; But I never ever said that the jury bought those
&gt; particular lies, obscenely obese fuckwit.

&gt;&gt;I asked what union you were talking about and you replied by saying you never

&gt; Caught lying again.

&gt;&gt; Correction (something Rod speed never issues):

&gt; Caught lying again. I often call them brain farts. Completely
&gt; trivial for anyone with a clue, which obviously counts out
&gt; terminal salesfools, to check using groups.google.

&gt;&gt;The 50 million is a cumulative figure.

&gt; Peanuts for an operation like WalMart over the time that that accumulated.

&gt;&gt;Still unanswered by the child is why he considers 50 million to be
&gt;&gt;insignificant

&gt; You're lying again. I said that was ancient history and
&gt; so is irrelevant to the IS IN deep shit lie. At best you
&gt; could claim that Walmart may HAVE BEEN in deep
&gt; shit at one time and its just a tad unlikely that if they
&gt; ever shelled out that much, that they wouldnt have
&gt; changed company policy to stop that happening again.

&gt;&gt;and to provide the name of the union.

&gt; Completely irrelevant. You seriously attempting to claim that
&gt; there is no union involvement whatever in the numerous lawsuits,
&gt; only one of which ever had a jury decide in the claimant's favour ?

&gt; Yeah, right obscenely obese fuckwit.

"/>  As usual, whenever Rod can not back up a claim he resorts to
juvenile name calling. It would take less effort to name the union but,
lacking facts, he can not do that.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Correction (something Rod speed never issues):

&gt;&gt; Caught lying again. I often call them brain farts. Completely
&gt;&gt; trivial for anyone with a clue, which obviously counts out
&gt;&gt; terminal salesfools, to check using groups.google.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The 50 million is a cumulative figure.

&gt;&gt; Peanuts for an operation like WalMart over the time that that accumulated.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Still unanswered by the child is why he considers 50 million to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;insignificant

&gt;&gt; You're lying again. I said that was ancient history and
&gt;&gt; so is irrelevant to the IS IN deep shit lie. At best you
&gt;&gt; could claim that Walmart may HAVE BEEN in deep
&gt;&gt; shit at one time and its just a tad unlikely that if they
&gt;&gt; ever shelled out that much, that they wouldnt have
&gt;&gt; changed company policy to stop that happening again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;and to provide the name of the union.

&gt;&gt; Completely irrelevant. You seriously attempting to claim that
&gt;&gt; there is no union involvement whatever in the numerous lawsuits,
&gt;&gt; only one of which ever had a jury decide in the claimant's favour ?

&gt;&gt; Yeah, right obscenely obese fuckwit.
&gt; As usual, whenever Rod can not back up a claim he resorts to juvenile name
&gt; calling.

"/> Corse you never ever do anything like that yourself, eh liar ?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It would take less effort to name the union

"/> You're lying again.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but, lacking facts, he can not do that.

"/> I dont give a flying red fuck what the name is.

I dont give a flying red fuck what the
name of the individuals involved is either.

Both are completely irrelevant to whether
Walmart IS IN DEEP SHIT CURRENTLY.

Keep desperately digging, you'll be out in china any day now, salesfool.

No surprise that the best 'work' it can manage is salesfool.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Right, little boy, tell us how a $50 million award not &quot;deep shit&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Its peanuts for an operation the size of Walmart and even you

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or do you deny that the court made that award?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, no court made that award. Even

&gt;&gt;Several awards were made after lawsuits.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ancient history. And doesnt qualify as IS IN deep shit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You have personal knowledge that the claims are lies?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Plenty of time for the jurys to have decided,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Right, little boy, tell us how a $50 million award not &quot;deep shit&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Its peanuts for an operation the size of Walmart and even you

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or do you deny that the court made that award?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, no court made that award. Even

&gt;&gt;&gt;Several awards were made after lawsuits.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You said a &quot;Pack of union lies&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But I never ever said that the jury bought those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;particular lies, obscenely obese fuckwit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I asked what union you were talking about and you replied by saying you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;never said that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Caught lying again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You forgot to snip your own quote.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No need, it says nothing like what you lied about it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What was the name of the union, little boy?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Record's stuck, obscenely obese sales fuckwit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yep, you keep making claims but when asked for substance you show us to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the child that you are.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Corse you never ever do anything even
&gt;&gt;&gt;remotely like that yourself, eh crapchild ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can tell when the liitle boy is frustrated that he can not back up his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;claims when he shows his maturity by engaging in cursing and juvenile name
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;calling,

&gt;&gt;&gt;Corse you never ever do anything even
&gt;&gt;&gt;remotely like that yourself, eh crapchild ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the bozo equivalent of a white flag.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Just as true of yours, crapchild.

&gt;&gt;Nope.

&gt; Yep.

&gt;&gt;Show me where I ever cursed in a post.

&gt; There's a little word 'and' in that spectacular fool you
&gt; made of yourself above, crapchild. Have a look at
&gt; what is on the other side of that to the cursing, crapchild.

&gt; No wonder the best you can manage is sales fuckwit.

&gt;&gt;Still frustrated over your inability to name the union in the Walmart case?

&gt; Nope, I told you before that I couldnt give a flying red fuck what
&gt; its name is, or what the names of the individuals involved are either.

&gt;&gt;Keep it up, It is a tacit admission that you, as usual, are devoid of facts.

&gt; Lying again.

&gt; And you've never ever presented even a SINGLE
&gt; fact relevant to the lie that Walmart IS IN DEEP SHIT.

"/>  What was the name of that union? Oh, right you made another claim
that has no basis so your answer is another temper tantrum.

&gt;&gt; everyone mobs the store at this period.

&gt;&gt; OK, so what? What is so sacred about that time period?
&gt;&gt; Can't it be deferred until later in order to deal with the
&gt;&gt; crush? Cannot the union understand that it is better for
&gt;&gt; all concerned that the customers be kept happy?

&gt;No. The union is not in business to understand, it is in business to
&gt;(a) maintain the jobs of the union leadership, and (b) keep the union
&gt;members paid as highly as possible, which involves (b1) major &quot;campaign
&gt;contributions&quot; to legislators and other government officials.

"/> There is no doubt that at one time in history unions were
the only hope of providing workers from being exploited. No
one wants to go back to the days of child labor, long hours,
low pay, no safety regulations, and so on. The unions did a
great job in forcing necessary changes.

However, in some areas they definitely went too far, in
Australia at least. A couple of examples:

I had a friend who worked in an metal foundry, which was
run by a subdivision of a large Australian company. Their
union won a 30% wage rise for all members, and all members
were very happy for a few weeks. However, their happiness
was pretty short lived when the company found that it was
now far cheaper to import the items they had been producing
and close the foundries.

Naturally, other companies soon closed their foundries as
well. Since he was rather skilled in a particular foundry
job and had been doing it for decades, he soon found himself
on the employment scrap heap.

Companies exist to make money for stockholders, not provide
jobs. When it is cheaper to outsource any product or
service most companies will do just that. This should come
as no surprise to anyone.

Basic manufacturing economics are not difficult to
understand. Consider a product such as a household
appliance. There is a certain amount of capital cost to
tool up to produce an item, the cost of producing it, taxes,
marketing costs, etc.

As an example, lets consider that the actual cost of
manufacturing appliance &quot;X&quot; locally is $8. However, there
are a lot of overheads such as taxes, marketing, profit
margins, etc. So the company sells it to a wholesaler or
distributor for $10. They have to make a profit as well, so
they sell it to retailers for around $15. The retailer
has to consider that it might sit on his shelf for a while,
tying up his capital, so he might price it at $25.

Such markups vary widely. In slow moving items such as
jewelery, markups of 100% from wholesale to retail are
common. On the other hand, supermarkets move a lot more
product daily, so the difference between wholesale and
retail can be as low as 3% to 5% and still make a profit.

However, getting back to the manufacturing of appliance &quot;X&quot;.
Once the company has designed the product, or improved on
the design of one of their existing products, they have two
basic choices. They can manufacture locally or they can
have it manufactured overseas and import it.

If they do this, they have to consider such factors as
exchange rates, freight, import duties [if any] and
insurance on the shipment. All this is often lumped under
the heading of &quot;landed cost&quot;.

Now to tool up to produce product X locally involves capital
investment, so this has to be eventually recovered. They
have to put up with production headaches involving workers,
unions, etc. Still, we will stick with the example and
assume the basic production cost at $5.

Now assume that the find that their landed cost for the same
product, same specs, etc. is $7 or $6, and it can even be a
lot less than this.

It doesn't take a degree in business administration to
understand why a cheaper cost makes more profit, especially
since they can often sell it under their own brand.

How many cameras, radios or TV sets have been manufactured
in the USA since the sixties?

If really interested in such economic facts, check to see
the dollar value of imports and exports for the USA or any
other country.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; and that cold items might spoil, so Nilkids is also
&gt;&gt;&gt;committing the sin of wasting food?

&gt;&gt; Nope, not a sin, or even a problem. If the market management
&gt;&gt; is efficient someone will replace the items on the shelves
&gt;&gt; and in the coolers or freezers. The stock clerks usual job,
&gt;&gt; but if necessary the manager himself can do it.

&gt;&gt; If he or his employees are so incompetent that they cannot
&gt;&gt; deal with such a simple problem, I feel sorry for all
&gt;&gt; concerned.

&gt;They are forbidden to. The union can punish its members for breaking
&gt;union rules by expelling them from the union, thereby depriving them of
&gt;their livelihood.

"/> Only if there is a closed shop agreement to where all
employees are required to belong to a union. Union power is
fast waning in both the US and Australia.

Now, of course, from a logical point of view, if employers
had treated workers fairly from the start, there would have
been little or no need for unions in the first place and
they wouldn't have achieved so much power.

On the other hand, when unions did achieve fair working
conditions they could have moderated their demands, in which
case everyone could have been happy.

Unfortunately, the human race has little common sense and
both bosses and unions tend to be greedy. :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; However, basically not my problem. A retailer exists to
&gt;&gt; serve the customers. If they cannot do this in a
&gt;&gt; satisfactory manner, then perhaps they lose out to another
&gt;&gt; retailer who can somehow manage to do so.

&gt;Local supermarkets all have to hire union checkers and stock persons.

"/> Depends on your local, state, and federal laws. Unions have
lost a lot of power here in the past couple of decades.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Small stores, which the unions don't care about, made out like bandits
&gt;during the strikes, and people learned that groceries were available at
&gt;places besides supermarkets. Don't know if things are back the way they
&gt;were before the strike, but a lot of supermarkets have done major
&gt;remodeling since the strike.

&gt;&gt; Do you really think that if a clerk is promoted to a
&gt;&gt; management position that he or she insists on following
&gt;&gt; union rules?

&gt;Managers are no longer in the union and become -- by definition --
&gt;adversaries.
&gt;&gt; In my experience, most people in management work harder and
&gt;&gt; longer hours than many of their employees, and if I was in
&gt;&gt; the position of supermarket manager any employee who refused
&gt;&gt; to volunteer to help in a problem situation might not last
&gt;&gt; very long.

&gt;So you'd ask employees to contribute their own time because of a
&gt;crunch?
&gt; Most states have laws forbidding work without pay, and I think WalMart
&gt;is in deep shit for making employees work off the clock.

"/> Well, I haven't been in the US for some time now, so I can't
really comment on the laws of the 50 states. However, not
all jobs are totally unionized, and in the event of a strike
there is nothing stopping non-unionized employees from
working without extra pay when necessary.

To get back to the original point, though, it isn't so much
a question of an employee being denied extra pay, it is more
a question of obsessive union rules.

That is, if the contract says that checkout clerks are
working a eight hour day and entitled to a coffee breaks and
lunch breaks the main question is not whether they are being
paid for working time.

The main question the flexibility of those breaks, timewise.

Perhaps the best way I can answer the question is to try to
put myself in the place of a supermarket manager. I have no
idea how it actually works, but for sake of argument assume
that some checkout people get their scheduled break between
0945 and 1000, others between 1000 and 1015, others between
1015 and 1030. Others between 1030 and 1045.

Sound good enough? Now, as a manager, I have to keep
customers happy enough to keep the store in business, or we
all risk losing our jobs.

Now envision a situation where some stupid radio personality
starts a rumor that stores are running out of toilet paper,
salt, sugar, coffee, or something before 0945.

Now, as it happens, our supermarket has adequate stocks of
all of these items. [These days it probably doesn't, but it
might...]

Anyway, all of a sudden at 0945 we have an unexpected flood
of customers, some of which will go elsewhere with any
significant delays. By 1030 perhaps the radio personality
will have admitted it is an unfounded rumor, and the flow
slackens.

Do I expect all &quot;hands on deck&quot; in such a situation? You
had damn well better believe it! I want everyone to delay
their break until the problem is managable. Some staff
will be willing to delay their break or even forego their
break to deal with the crisis.

Others may be obsessive/compulsive to insist on their break
at exact specified times.

The people who are willing to help with the crisis I would
consider increasing their pay, marking them for promotion,
giving them time off when they asked for it, etc.

What of the ones who refused to help in the emergency? Ah
well, who wants to employ such people? If one of the
people who has helped comes in late, asks to leave early,
etc. their request is granted.

What of those that refused to help when needed? Ah well,
then the store rules are enforced to the bloodly letter. If
they are a minute or two late for work, their pay is docked.
If I have to direct an employee to do an employee to do an
unpleasant job, guess who gets chosen. Perhaps they
eventually choose to leave.

If not, I would review their employment application looking
for any excuse to fire them, perhaps they have lied on their ...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doesnt qualify as DEEP SHIT.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Paying 50 million dollars is not &quot;deep shit&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ancient history. And doesnt qualify as IS IN deep shit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You have personal knowledge that the claims are lies?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Plenty of time for the jurys to have decided,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that pack of union lies just presents their lies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Care to explain the guilty verdict?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just one verdict. Doesnt qualify as DEEP SHIT.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You aint presented even a SINGLE relevant fact to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Right, little boy, tell us how a $50 million award not &quot;deep shit&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Its peanuts for an operation the size of Walmart and even you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;should be able to work out that its a small part of what those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;union bludgers claim Walmart saved over that time in wages too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or do you deny that the court made that award?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, no court made that award. Even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the union bludger lies doesnt claim that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Several awards were made after lawsuits.

&gt;&gt; Easy to claim. And doesnt qualify as IS IN DEEP SHIT anyway.

&gt; If 50 million is not deep shit, what amount is? i already posted facts
&gt;but yu brain has been programmed to ignore anything that could ever show

&gt;&gt;&gt;The name of the union, please.

&gt;&gt; Go and fuck yourself. No please, thats an order.

"/> His original posts on alt.support.childfree didn't seem to
be completely unreasonable, just mistaken in ways which
would take quite a bit of research to refute.

So I put off answering same, not only from the primary
reason of lack of time but also in the secondary hope that
others would spot his obvious crap.

I don't mind putting up with people who might be genuinely
mistaken, but when he started calling me homosexual and
psychotic I lost all interest in him.

In my years on usenet, I have run across a few
&quot;intellectually challenged&quot; or &quot;psychotic&quot; individuals. I
don't think he is either, but he possibly might be a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Caught lying again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Right, little boy, tell us how a $50 million award not &quot;deep shit&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Its peanuts for an operation the size of Walmart and even you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;should be able to work out that its a small part of what those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;union bludgers claim Walmart saved over that time in wages too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or do you deny that the court made that award?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, no court made that award. Even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the union bludger lies doesnt claim that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Several awards were made after lawsuits.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Easy to claim. And doesnt qualify as IS IN DEEP SHIT anyway.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If 50 million is not deep shit,

&gt;&gt; Corse it aint if its a small fraction of what those union liars
&gt;&gt; claim they saved on wages not paid for hours worked, fuckwit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;what amount is?

&gt;&gt; I wasnt the one making the claim, crapchild.

&gt;&gt;&gt;i already posted facts

&gt;&gt; Lying again. No a single 'fact' you posted was
&gt;&gt; relevant to the lie that Walmart IS IN DEEP SHIT.

&gt;&gt;&gt;but yu brain has been programmed to ignore anything that could ever show you

&gt;&gt; Have fun explaining what I readily admit

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Go and fuck yourself. No please, thats an order.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Translation&quot; Baby Rod got caught making up facts.

&gt;&gt; Translation: the crapchild got done like a fucking dinner, as always.

&gt;&gt; No surprise that its stuck with being a sales fuckwit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Kee the cursing and name calling going.

&gt;&gt; Corse you never ever do any name calling yourself, eh crapchild ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;It is a tacit admission that you can not back up your fantasies

&gt;&gt; You havent actually presented a SHRED

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As always, when done like a fucking dinner, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Crapman desperately attempts to bullshit its way out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of its predicament and fools absolutely no one at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You aint presented even a SINGLE fact that substantiates
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the lie that walmart IS IN DEEP SHIT on that issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Keep desperately digging, you'll be out in china any day now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As usual, faced with facts ,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You aint presented even a SINGLE relevant fact to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the child can only admit defeat by misspelling my name.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Caught lying again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Right, little boy, tell us how a $50 million award not &quot;deep shit&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Its peanuts for an operation the size of Walmart and even you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;should be able to work out that its a small part of what those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;union bludgers claim Walmart saved over that time in wages too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or do you deny that the court made that award?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, no court made that award. Even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the union bludger lies doesnt claim that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Several awards were made after lawsuits.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Easy to claim. And doesnt qualify as IS IN DEEP SHIT anyway.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If 50 million is not deep shit,

&gt;&gt;&gt;Corse it aint if its a small fraction of what those union liars
&gt;&gt;&gt;claim they saved on wages not paid for hours worked, fuckwit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what amount is?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I wasnt the one making the claim, crapchild.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;i already posted facts

&gt;&gt;&gt;Lying again. No a single 'fact' you posted was
&gt;&gt;&gt;relevant to the lie that Walmart IS IN DEEP SHIT.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but yu brain has been programmed to ignore anything that could ever show you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to be in error.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Have fun explaining what I readily admit
&gt;&gt;&gt;are my brain farts, lying crapchild.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The name of the union, please.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Go and fuck yourself. No please, thats an order.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Translation&quot; Baby Rod got caught making up facts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Translation: the crapchild got done like a fucking dinner, as always.

&gt;&gt;&gt;No surprise that its stuck with being a sales fuckwit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kee the cursing and name calling going.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Corse you never ever do any name calling yourself, eh crapchild ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is a tacit admission that you can not back up your fantasies

&gt;&gt;&gt;True in spades of you, crapchild.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You havent actually presented a SHRED
&gt;&gt;&gt;of evidence that Walmart IS IN DEEP SHIT

&gt;&gt;You have yet to provide the name of the union.

&gt; You have yet to provide a SHRED of
&gt; evidence that Walmart IS IN DEEP SHIT

&gt;&gt;You have yet to tell us how much money would make it deep shit.

&gt; You have yet to provide a SHRED of
&gt; evidence that Walmart IS IN DEEP SHIT

&gt;&gt;As usual, your idea of a cite is cursing a and juvenile name calling.

&gt; Corse you never ever do anything like that yourself, eh ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Shouldnt even take that long.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The jobs aren't worth much more than minimum wage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and they're getting excellent pay PLUS benefits.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it's not as easy as it seems.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bullshit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it's not rocket science, either.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nothing like it in fact. Any monkey can do it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;funny, ive never seen a monkey scanning groceries.... :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;Best get your eyes checked. I see them every time I buy grocerys.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;when you have memorized over 100 produce codes and bulk codes,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lie.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;excuse me?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Not possible, you're completely inexcusible.

&gt;&gt;entirely possible.

&gt; Not in your case.

&gt;&gt;each variety of fruit and vegetable has its own code. in
&gt;&gt;fact, there are *at least* 100 codes for produce *alone*.

&gt; Completely and utterly irrelevant to whether any operation with
&gt; a clue requires the checkout monkeys to MEMORISE them all.

&gt;&gt;ever notice that sheet above the register at
&gt;&gt;a self-service register at the grocery store?

&gt; Yep, and any operation with a clue has those
&gt; on the checkouts used by their monkeys as well.

&gt;&gt;oh yeah, we were also responsible for walking the produce
&gt;&gt;floor to see what new items we had out that day. and to be
&gt;&gt;able to differentiate organic produce from conventional-

&gt; By eye eh ? Yeah, right.

&gt;&gt;often there would be both kinds for a single &quot;base&quot; code.

&gt; Irrelevant.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that is what i was responsible for when i was a cashier.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The operation you 'worked' for was fucked ? Your problem.

&gt;&gt;not 'fucked'.

&gt; Fraid so if they dont have lists of those
&gt; codes at the checkouts you monkeys use.

&gt;&gt;they expect us to do our jobs well.

&gt; Even a monkey should be able to manage that with a checkout.

&gt;&gt;whats wrong with that?

&gt; Nothing.

&gt;&gt;customers certainly noticed, and appreciate the
&gt;&gt;fact that we knew what the hell we were doing.

&gt; It aint rocket science, monkey.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;we had *tests* on the things....

&gt;&gt;&gt;Whoopy do.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and learned to deal with every day idiots

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Any monkey can do that.

&gt;&gt;no.

&gt; Yep.

&gt;&gt;dealing with customers effectively is a SKILL.

&gt; Bullshit. No more a SKILL than working out
&gt; how to pass the items over the scanner is.

&gt; Any monkey can do it with minimal 'training'

&gt;&gt;some people are good at developing this skill, others not so.

&gt; Any monkey can do it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(and not-so-everyday total choads),

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;get back to me on how it's &quot;not worth more than minumum wage&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Corse its not. Have fun listing work thats easier.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;since when are most jobs paid based on their ease?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Having fun thrashing that straw man ?

&gt;&gt;you brought it up.

&gt; You're lying now.

&gt;&gt;in your statement, one can infer that
&gt;&gt;&quot;easy&quot; jobs should be paid at a lower rate.

&gt; Only a stupid monkey would 'infer' anything of the sort.

&gt; No surprise that you're stuck with such a trivial 'job' that any monkey can do.

&gt; Most of the customers can do it too.

&gt;&gt;how do you define &quot;easy&quot;?

&gt; Too obvious to require defining except for a minimum wage monkey.

&gt; Thats why they are a minimum wage monkey.

&gt;&gt;physical labor involved? mental faculties needed? what?

&gt; None of that is required to be a viable checkout monkey.

&gt;&gt;saerah

&gt;&gt;TANSTAAFL

&gt; Wrong again. Plenty of charitys provide free lunches to povs etc.

&gt;&gt;CrzyBitch (3:25:06 AM): I'm a secret agent, and a princess

&gt;&gt;&gt; However, basically not my problem. A retailer exists
&gt;&gt;&gt; to serve the customers. If they cannot do this in a
&gt;&gt;&gt; satisfactory manner, then perhaps they lose out to
&gt;&gt;&gt; another retailer who can somehow manage to do so.
&gt;&gt; Local supermarkets all have to hire union checkers and stock persons.
&gt; Depends on your local, state, and federal laws. Unions
&gt; have lost a lot of power here in the past couple of decades.
&gt;&gt; Small stores, which the unions don't care about, made out like
&gt;&gt; bandits during the strikes, and people learned that groceries
&gt;&gt; were available at places besides supermarkets. Don't know if
&gt;&gt; things are back the way they were before the strike, but a lot
&gt;&gt; of supermarkets have done major remodeling since the strike.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you really think that if a clerk is promoted to a management
&gt;&gt; position that he or she insists on following union rules?
&gt;&gt; Managers are no longer in the union and
&gt;&gt; become -- by definition -- adversaries.
&gt;&gt;&gt; In my experience, most people in management work harder and
&gt;&gt;&gt; longer hours than many of their employees, and if I was in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the position of supermarket manager any employee who refused
&gt;&gt;&gt; to volunteer to help in a problem situation might not last very long.
&gt;&gt; So you'd ask employees to contribute
&gt;&gt; their own time because of a crunch?
&gt;&gt; Most states have laws forbidding work without pay, and I think
&gt;&gt; WalMart is in deep shit for making employees work off the clock.
&gt; Well, I haven't been in the US for some time now, so I can't
&gt; really comment on the laws of the 50 states. However, not
&gt; all jobs are totally unionized, and in the event of a strike
&gt; there is nothing stopping non-unionized employees from
&gt; working without extra pay when necessary.
&gt; To get back to the original point, though, it isn't so
&gt; much a question of an employee being denied extra
&gt; pay, it is more a question of obsessive union rules.

"/> Rorts, actually.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That is, if the contract says that checkout clerks
&gt; are working a eight hour day and entitled to a coffee
&gt; breaks and lunch breaks the main question is not
&gt; whether they are being paid for working time.
&gt; The main question the flexibility of those breaks, timewise.
&gt; Perhaps the best way I can answer the question is to try to
&gt; put myself in the place of a supermarket manager. I have
&gt; no idea how it actually works, but for sake of argument
&gt; assume that some checkout people get their scheduled break
&gt; between 0945 and 1000, others between 1000 and 1015,
&gt; others between 1015 and 1030. Others between 1030 and 1045.

to stick to such rigid times regardless.

&gt; Sound good enough? Now, as a manager, I have

In fact all you really have to do is ensure that your
store isnt noticeable worse than the competition.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now envision a situation where some stupid radio personality
&gt; starts a rumor that stores are running out of toilet paper,
&gt; salt, sugar, coffee, or something before 0945.
&gt; Now, as it happens, our supermarket has adequate stocks of
&gt; all of these items. [These days it probably doesn't, but it might...]
&gt; Anyway, all of a sudden at 0945 we
&gt; have an unexpected flood of customers,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; some of which will go elsewhere with any significant delays.
&gt; By 1030 perhaps the radio personality will have admitted
&gt; it is an unfounded rumor, and the flow slackens.
&gt; Do I expect all &quot;hands on deck&quot; in such a situation?
&gt; You had damn well better believe it! I want everyone
&gt; to delay their break until the problem is managable.
&gt; Some staff will be willing to delay their break or
&gt; even forego their break to deal with the crisis.
&gt; Others may be obsessive/compulsive to
&gt; insist on their break at exact specified times.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; workers and to cost the store huge amounts of money.
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a dispute between management and labor,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and the customers shouldn't have to be involved.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps the store should have employed more scab
&gt;&gt;&gt; labor. Or paid their existing employees more so that
&gt;&gt;&gt; there wouldn't have been a strike in the first place.
&gt;&gt; Customers' and scabs' cars were keyed. Some were beaten. Top pay

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As usual, faced with facts little Rod goes into the auto bot anal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mode.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As always, when done like a fucking dinner, the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of its predicament and fools absolutely no one at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You aint presented even a SINGLE fact that substantiates
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the lie that walmart IS IN DEEP SHIT on that issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Keep desperately digging, you'll be out in china any day now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As usual, faced with facts ,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You aint presented even a SINGLE relevant fact to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that IS IN DEEP SHIT lie, obsenely obese fuckwit liar.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the child can only admit defeat by misspelling my name.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Caught lying again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Right, little boy, tell us how a $50 million award not &quot;deep shit&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Its peanuts for an operation the size of Walmart and even you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;should be able to work out that its a small part of what those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;union bludgers claim Walmart saved over that time in wages too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or do you deny that the court made that award?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, no court made that award. Even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the union bludger lies doesnt claim that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Several awards were made after lawsuits.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Easy to claim. And doesnt qualify as IS IN DEEP SHIT anyway.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If 50 million is not deep shit,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Corse it aint if its a small fraction of what those union liars
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;claim they saved on wages not paid for hours worked, fuckwit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what amount is?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I wasnt the one making the claim, crapchild.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;i already posted facts

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lying again. No a single 'fact' you posted was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;relevant to the lie that Walmart IS IN DEEP SHIT.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but yu brain has been programmed to ignore anything that could ever show
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you to be in error.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Have fun explaining what I readily admit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are my brain farts, lying crapchild.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The name of the union, please.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Go and fuck yourself. No please, thats an order.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Translation&quot; Baby Rod got caught making up facts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Translation: the crapchild got done like a fucking dinner, as always.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No surprise that its stuck with being a sales fuckwit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kee the cursing and name calling going.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Corse you never ever do any name calling yourself, eh crapchild ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is a tacit admission that you can not back up your fantasies

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;True in spades of you, crapchild.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You havent actually presented a SHRED
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of evidence that Walmart IS IN DEEP SHIT

&gt;&gt;&gt;You have yet to provide the name of the union.

&gt;&gt; You have yet to provide a SHRED of

&gt;&gt;&gt;You have yet to tell us how much money would make it deep shit.

&gt;&gt; You have yet to provide a SHRED of

&gt; Never.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; So were countless other downsides like trusts and monopolys too.

&gt;&gt;The unions did a great job in forcing necessary changes.

&gt; Lie.

&gt;&gt;However, in some areas they definitely
&gt;&gt;went too far, in Australia at least.

&gt; Everywhere, actually. In fact you wont be able to cite
&gt; a single country where unions havent gone too far.

&gt;&gt;A couple of examples:

&gt;&gt;I had a friend who worked in an metal foundry, which
&gt;&gt;was run by a subdivision of a large Australian company.
&gt;&gt;Their union won a 30% wage rise for all members, and
&gt;&gt;all members were very happy for a few weeks. However,
&gt;&gt;their happiness was pretty short lived when the company
&gt;&gt;found that it was now far cheaper to import the items
&gt;&gt;they had been producing and close the foundries.

&gt; Thats happened world wide.

&gt;&gt;Naturally, other companies soon closed their foundries
&gt;&gt;as well. Since he was rather skilled in a particular
&gt;&gt;foundry job and had been doing it for decades, he
&gt;&gt;soon found himself on the employment scrap heap.

&gt; Lie. He can obviously find other work.

&gt;&gt;Companies exist to make money
&gt;&gt;for stockholders, not provide jobs.

&gt; Thats another lie.

&gt;&gt;When it is cheaper to outsource any product
&gt;&gt;or service most companies will do just that.
&gt;&gt;This should come as no surprise to anyone.

&gt; Does to stupid union goons.

&gt;&gt;Basic manufacturing economics are not difficult to understand.

&gt; Tis for the stupid union goons.

&gt;&gt;Consider a product such as a household appliance.
&gt;&gt;There is a certain amount of capital cost to tool up
&gt;&gt;to produce an item, the cost of producing it, taxes,
&gt;&gt;marketing costs, etc.

&gt; You quite sure you aint one of those rocket scientist fundys ?

&gt; Reams and reams of mindless waffle flushed where it belongs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and that cold items might spoil, so Nilkids
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is also committing the sin of wasting food?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nope, not a sin,

&gt; Wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or even a problem.

&gt; Wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If the market management is efficient someone will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;replace the items on the shelves and in the coolers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or freezers. The stock clerks usual job, but if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;necessary the manager himself can do it.

&gt; You quite sure you aint one of those rocket
&gt; scientist mindless irrational paranoids ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If he or his employees are so incompetent that they cannot
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;deal with such a simple problem, I feel sorry for all concerned.

&gt; Your problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;They are forbidden to. The union can punish its members
&gt;&gt;&gt;for breaking union rules by expelling them from the union,
&gt;&gt;&gt;thereby depriving them of their livelihood.

&gt;&gt;Only if there is a closed shop agreement to where
&gt;&gt;all employees are required to belong to a union.
&gt;&gt;Union power is fast waning in both the US and Australia.

&gt;&gt;Now, of course, from a logical point of view, if employers
&gt;&gt;had treated workers fairly from the start, there would have
&gt;&gt;been little or no need for unions in the first place

&gt; Wrong. As that example on wages you waffled about shows.

&gt;&gt;and they wouldn't have achieved so much power.

&gt; Wrong again.

&gt;&gt;On the other hand, when unions did achieve fair working
&gt;&gt;conditions they could have moderated their demands,

&gt; Then there's the real world outside your pathetic little cloud cuckooland.

&gt;&gt;in which case everyone could have been happy.

&gt; Then there's the real world outside your pathetic little cloud cuckooland.

&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, the human race has little common sense
&gt;&gt;and both bosses and unions tend to be greedy. :-)

&gt; And fools like you are can be relied on to be completely mindless.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;However, basically not my problem. A retailer exists
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to serve the customers. If they cannot do this in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;satisfactory manner, then perhaps they lose out to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;another retailer who can somehow manage to do so.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Local supermarkets all have to hire union checkers and stock persons.

&gt;&gt;Depends on your local, state, and federal laws. Unions
&gt;&gt;have lost a lot of power here in the past couple of decades.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Small stores, which the unions don't care about, made out like
&gt;&gt;&gt;bandits during the strikes, and people learned that groceries
&gt;&gt;&gt;were available at places besides supermarkets. Don't know if
&gt;&gt;&gt;things are back the way they were before the strike, but a lot
&gt;&gt;&gt;of supermarkets have done major remodeling since the strike.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Do you really think that if a clerk is promoted to a management

&gt;&gt;&gt;position that he or she insists on following union rules?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Managers are no longer in the union and
&gt;&gt;&gt;become -- by definition -- adversaries.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In my experience, most people in management work harder and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;longer hours than many of their employees, and if I was in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the position of supermarket manager any employee who refused
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to volunteer to help in a problem situation might not last very long.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So you'd ask employees to contribute
&gt;&gt;&gt;their own time because of a crunch?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Most states have laws forbidding work without pay, and I think
&gt;&gt;&gt;WalMart is in deep shit for making employees work off the clock.

&gt;&gt;Well, I haven't been in the US for some time now, so I can't
&gt;&gt;really comment on the laws of the 50 states. However, not
&gt;&gt;all jobs are totally unionized, and in the event of a strike
&gt;&gt;there is nothing stopping non-unionized employees from
&gt;&gt;working without extra pay when necessary.

&gt;&gt;To get back to the original point, though, it isn't so
&gt;&gt;much a question of an employee being denied extra
&gt;&gt;pay, it is more a question of obsessive union rules.

&gt; Rorts, actually.

&gt;&gt;That is, if the contract says that checkout clerks
&gt;&gt;are working a eight hour day and entitled to a coffee
&gt;&gt;breaks and lunch breaks the main question is not
&gt;&gt;whether they are being paid for working time.

&gt;&gt;The main question the flexibility of those breaks, timewise.

&gt;&gt;Perhaps the best way I can answer the question is to try to
&gt;&gt;put myself in the place of a supermarket manager. I have
&gt;&gt;no idea how it actually works, but for sake of argument
&gt;&gt;assume that some checkout people get their scheduled break
&gt;&gt;between 0945 and 1000, others between 1000 and 1015,
&gt;&gt;others between 1015 and 1030. Others between 1030 and 1045.

&gt; And no one self employed is stupid enough
&gt; to stick to such rigid times regardless.

&gt;&gt;Sound good enough? Now, as a manager, I have
&gt;&gt;to keep customers happy enough to keep the store
&gt;&gt;in business, or we all risk losing our jobs.

&gt; You quite sure you aint one of those rocket
&gt; scientist mindless irrational paranoids ?

&gt; In fact all you really have to do is ensure that your
&gt; store isnt noticeable worse than the competition.

&gt;&gt;Now envision a situation where some stupid radio personality
&gt;&gt;starts a rumor that stores are running out of toilet paper,
&gt;&gt;salt, sugar, coffee, or something before 0945.

&gt;&gt;Now, as it happens, our supermarket has adequate stocks of
&gt;&gt;all of these items. [These days it probably doesn't, but it might...]

&gt;&gt;Anyway, all of a sudden at 0945 we
&gt;&gt;have an unexpected flood of customers,

&gt; Just your completely silly impossible scenario. Never happens.

&gt;&gt;some of which will go elsewhere with any significant delays.
&gt;&gt;By 1030 perhaps the radio personality will have admitted
&gt;&gt;it is an unfounded rumor, and the flow slackens.

&gt;&gt;Do I expect all &quot;hands on deck&quot; in such a situation?
&gt;&gt;You had damn well better believe it! I want everyone
&gt;&gt;to delay their break until the problem is managable.
&gt;&gt;Some staff will be willing to delay their break or
&gt;&gt;even forego their break to deal with the crisis.

&gt;&gt;Others may be obsessive/compulsive to
&gt;&gt;insist on their break at exact specified times.

&gt; Shit you can waffle. Reams of your
&gt; dihorrea flushed where it belongs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;During the California grocery strike/lockouts, commie union LIE-BRAWL
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;scum encouraged a-holes to invade the grocery stores and load up carts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with items, abandon the carts, and walk out to inconvenience the &quot;scab&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;workers and to cost the store huge amounts of money.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is a dispute between management and labor,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and the customers shouldn't have to be involved.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Perhaps the store should have employed more scab
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;labor. Or paid their existing employees more so that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;there wouldn't have been a strike in the first place.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Customers' and scabs' cars were keyed. Some were beaten. Top pay
&gt;&gt;&gt;for a grocery checker was ~$18US/hour at the time. Anybody here think
&gt;&gt;&gt;it takes more than a morning to learn how to run a cash register?

&gt;&gt;Um, I would rather hope not, actually. :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;The jobs aren't worth much more than minimum wage
&gt;&gt;&gt;and they're getting excellent pay PLUS benefits.

&gt;&gt;&gt;During the strike they were paying the
&gt;&gt;&gt;scabs, including my grandson, $18/hour.

&gt;&gt;Sounds fair enough for temporary help. What were the regular
&gt;&gt;employees making per hour. Considering their other benefits, probably
&gt;&gt;less, but out of curiosity can you provide their hourly rates of pay?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In any case, though, if a store wants to stay in business,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and the employees want to stay employed, then strikes and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;lockouts are problems between the store and its employees.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Customers shouldn't have to be involved. However, if they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wish to, they can be. Everyone has free will. If they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;support the strikers, then they shouldn't be shopping at the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;store at all and will not have to suffer much inconvenience
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;by the strike.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The news mentioned that a picket-line-crossing customer was beaten up by
&gt;&gt;&gt;the strikers. My MIL, who weighs perhaps

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Customers' and scabs' cars were keyed. Some were

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at the time. Anybody here think it takes more than a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; morning to learn how to run a cash register?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shouldnt even take that long.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The jobs aren't worth much more than minimum wage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and they're getting excellent pay PLUS benefits.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's not as easy as it seems.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bullshit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's not rocket science, either.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing like it in fact. Any monkey can do it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; funny, ive never seen a monkey scanning groceries.... :)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Best get your eyes checked. I see them every time I buy grocerys.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when you have memorized over 100 produce codes and bulk codes,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lie.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; excuse me?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Not possible, you're completely inexcusible.

&gt;&gt; entirely possible.

&gt;Not in your case.

"/> well i did have those memorized at one point. not every code, but at least
100 of them i am sure of it. not sure how i can prove that to you,
though....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; each variety of fruit and vegetable has its own code. in
&gt;&gt; fact, there are *at least* 100 codes for produce *alone*.

&gt;Completely and utterly irrelevant to whether any operation with

"/> it takes less time to check someone out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; ever notice that sheet above the register at
&gt;&gt; a self-service register at the grocery store?

&gt;Yep, and any operation with a clue has those
&gt;on the checkouts used by their monkeys as well.

&gt;&gt; oh yeah, we were also responsible for walking the produce
&gt;&gt; floor to see what new items we had out that day. and to be
&gt;&gt; able to differentiate organic produce from conventional-

&gt;By eye eh ? Yeah, right.

"/> yes, by eye. sometimes they would be marked, sometimes not. stickers fall
off.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; often there would be both kinds for a single &quot;base&quot; code.

&gt;Irrelevant.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that is what i was responsible for when i was a cashier.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The operation you 'worked' for was fucked ? Your problem.

&gt;&gt; not 'fucked'.

&gt;Fraid so if they dont have lists of those
&gt;codes at the checkouts you monkeys use.

"/> we had lists. we were also supposed to memorize common codes. there were
probably twice as many codes on the sheet as i had memorized. many of them
were for seasonal produce items.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; they expect us to do our jobs well.

&gt;Even a monkey should be able to manage that with a checkout.

&gt;&gt; whats wrong with that?

&gt;Nothing.

&gt;&gt; customers certainly noticed, and appreciate the
&gt;&gt; fact that we knew what the hell we were doing.

&gt;It aint rocket science, monkey.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we had *tests* on the things....

&gt;&gt;&gt; Whoopy do.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and learned to deal with every day idiots

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any monkey can do that.

&gt;&gt; no.

&gt;Yep.

&gt;&gt; dealing with customers effectively is a SKILL.

&gt;Bullshit. No more a SKILL than working out
&gt;how to pass the items over the scanner is.

&gt;Any monkey can do it with minimal 'training'

&gt;&gt; some people are good at developing this skill, others not so.

&gt;Any monkey can do it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (and not-so-everyday total choads),

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get back to me on how it's &quot;not worth more than minumum wage&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Corse its not. Have fun listing work thats easier.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; since when are most jobs paid based on their ease?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Having fun thrashing that straw man ?

&gt;&gt; you brought it up.

&gt;You're lying now.

&gt;&gt; in your statement, one can infer that
&gt;&gt;&quot;easy&quot; jobs should be paid at a lower rate.

&gt;Only a stupid monkey would 'infer' anything of the sort.

&gt;No surprise that you're stuck with such a trivial 'job' that any monkey can
do.

"/> i am not stuck with a &quot;trivial&quot; job and even when i worked as a cashier, i
was not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Most of the customers can do it too.

&gt;&gt; how do you define &quot;easy&quot;?

&gt;Too obvious to require defining except for a minimum wage monkey.

&gt;Thats why they are a minimum wage monkey.

"/> who are we talking about here?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; physical labor involved? mental faculties needed? what?

&gt;None of that is required to be a viable checkout monkey.

"/> staying on your feet all day. lifting items 10-20 pounds on a regular basis,
sometimes even heavier items. remembering codes for departments, phone
extentions,produce and bulk items. packing bags correctly. (which,
considering how many people in a number of newsgroups ive read have
commented on how poorly most checkout clerks perform in this function, and
having done it for years, I know is a skill which requires some forethought
and organization). being gracious to peopel who often do not even look you
in the face. granted, that last one isn't really a skill but a matter of
self-control.

what tasks do you perform throughout the day that are so mentally or
physically taxing that you are so superior, huh?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Paying 50 million dollars is not &quot;deep shit&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ancient history. And doesnt qualify as IS IN deep shit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You have personal knowledge that the claims are lies?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Plenty of time for the jurys to have decided,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that pack of union lies just presents their lies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Care to explain the guilty verdict?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just one verdict. Doesnt qualify as DEEP SHIT.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Reams of your puerile shit flushed where it belongs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As usual, faced with facts little Rod goes into the auto bot anal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mode.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As always, when done like a fucking dinner, the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of its predicament and fools absolutely no one at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You aint presented even a SINGLE fact that substantiates
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the lie that walmart IS IN DEEP SHIT on that issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Keep desperately digging, you'll be out in china any day now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As usual, faced with facts ,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You aint presented even a SINGLE relevant fact to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the child can only admit defeat by misspelling my name.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Caught lying again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Right, little boy, tell us how a $50 million award not &quot;deep shit&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Its peanuts for an operation the size of Walmart and even you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;should be able to work out that its a small part of what those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;union bludgers claim Walmart saved over that time in wages too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or do you deny that the court made that award?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, no court made that award. Even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the union bludger lies doesnt claim that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Several awards were made after lawsuits.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Easy to claim. And doesnt qualify as IS IN DEEP SHIT anyway.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If 50 million is not deep shit,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Corse it aint if its a small fraction of what those union liars
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;claim they saved on wages not paid for hours worked, fuckwit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what amount is?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I wasnt the one making the claim, crapchild.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;i already posted facts

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lying again. No a single 'fact' you posted was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;relevant to the lie that Walmart IS IN DEEP SHIT.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but yu brain has been programmed to ignore anything that could ever show

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Have fun explaining what I readily admit

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No surprise that its stuck with being a sales fuckwit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kee the cursing and name calling going.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is a tacit admission that you can not back up your fantasies

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;True in spades of you, crapchild.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You have yet to tell us how much money would make it deep shit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You have yet to provide a SHRED of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;evidence that Walmart IS IN DEEP SHIT

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As usual, your idea of a cite is cursing a and juvenile name calling.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Never.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'think' again, thats a lie.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The guilty verdict is a lie?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doesnt qualify as DEEP SHIT.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;These suits must also be lies:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;http://www.sullivan-county.com/id2/wal-mart/not_paid.htm

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yep, you watch if any jury buys the lies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Paying 50 million dollars is not &quot;deep shit&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ancient history. And doesnt qualify as IS IN deep shit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You have personal knowledge that the claims are lies?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Plenty of time for the jurys to have decided,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that pack of union lies just presents their lies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Care to explain the guilty verdict?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just one verdict. Doesnt qualify as DEEP SHIT.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Reams of your puerile shit flushed where it belongs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As usual, faced with facts little Rod goes into the auto bot anal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mode.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As always, when done like a fucking dinner, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Crapman desperately attempts to bullshit its way out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of its predicament and fools absolutely no one at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You aint presented even a SINGLE fact that substantiates
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the lie that walmart IS IN DEEP SHIT on that issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Keep desperately digging, you'll be out in china any day now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As usual, faced with facts ,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You aint presented even a SINGLE relevant fact to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that IS IN DEEP SHIT lie, obsenely obese fuckwit liar.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the child can only admit defeat by misspelling my name.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Caught lying again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Right, little boy, tell us how a $50 million award not &quot;deep shit&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Its peanuts for an operation the size of Walmart and even you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;should be able to work out that its a small part of what those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;union bludgers claim Walmart saved over that time in wages too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or do you deny that the court made that award?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, no court made that award. Even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the union bludger lies doesnt claim that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Several awards were made after lawsuits.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Easy to claim. And doesnt qualify as IS IN DEEP SHIT anyway.

&gt;&gt; If 50 million is not deep shit, what amount is? i already posted facts
&gt;&gt;but yu brain has been programmed to ignore anything that could ever show
&gt;&gt;you to be in error.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The name of the union, please.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Go and fuck yourself. No please, thats an order.

&gt;&gt; Translation&quot; Baby Rod got caught making up facts. Kee the cursing and
&gt;&gt;name calling going. It is a tacit admission that you can not back up
&gt;&gt;your fantasies

&gt; His original posts on alt.support.childfree didn't seem to
&gt; be completely unreasonable, just mistaken in ways which
&gt; would take quite a bit of research to refute.

&gt; So I put off answering same, not only from the primary
&gt; reason of lack of time but also in the secondary hope that
&gt; others would spot his obvious crap.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Customers' and scabs' cars were keyed. Some were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beaten. Top pay for a grocery checker was ~$18US/hour
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at the time. Anybody here think it takes more than a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; morning to learn how to run a cash register?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shouldnt even take that long.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The jobs aren't worth much more than minimum wage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and they're getting excellent pay PLUS benefits.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's not as easy as it seems.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bullshit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's not rocket science, either.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing like it in fact. Any monkey can do it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; funny, ive never seen a monkey scanning groceries.... :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Best get your eyes checked. I see them every time I buy grocerys.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when you have memorized over 100 produce codes and bulk codes,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lie.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; excuse me?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not possible, you're completely inexcusible.

&gt;&gt;&gt; entirely possible.

&gt;&gt;Not in your case.
&gt; well i did have those memorized at one point. not every code, but at least
&gt; 100 of them i am sure of it. not sure how i can prove that to you, though....

"/> I was talking about whether you are excusible or not there.

I memorised a lot more than 100 ic part numbers, without even trying.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; each variety of fruit and vegetable has its own code. in
&gt;&gt;&gt; fact, there are *at least* 100 codes for produce *alone*.
&gt;&gt; Completely and utterly irrelevant to whether any operation with
&gt;&gt; a clue requires the checkout monkeys to MEMORISE them all.
&gt; it takes less time to check someone out.

"/> Sure, but you inevitably end up remembering the most
common ones unless you are completely brain dead.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; ever notice that sheet above the register at
&gt;&gt;&gt; a self-service register at the grocery store?

&gt;&gt;Yep, and any operation with a clue has those
&gt;&gt;on the checkouts used by their monkeys as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt; oh yeah, we were also responsible for walking the produce
&gt;&gt;&gt; floor to see what new items we had out that day. and to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; able to differentiate organic produce from conventional-
&gt;&gt; By eye eh ? Yeah, right.
&gt; yes, by eye.

"/> Not even possible.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; sometimes they would be marked, sometimes not. stickers fall off.

"/> Still not even possible without marking.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; often there would be both kinds for a single &quot;base&quot; code.
&gt;&gt; Irrelevant.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that is what i was responsible for when i was a cashier.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The operation you 'worked' for was fucked ? Your problem.
&gt;&gt;&gt; not 'fucked'.
&gt;&gt; Fraid so if they dont have lists of those
&gt;&gt; codes at the checkouts you monkeys use.
&gt; we had lists. we were also supposed to memorize common codes.

"/> That happens automatically with anyone who isnt completely brain dead.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; there were probably twice as many codes on the sheet as i had
&gt; memorized. many of them were for seasonal produce items.

"/> So it aint anything like rocket science. Any
monkey that aint completely brain dead can do it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; they expect us to do our jobs well.
&gt;&gt; Even a monkey should be able to manage that with a checkout.
&gt;&gt;&gt; whats wrong with that?
&gt;&gt; Nothing.
&gt;&gt;&gt; customers certainly noticed, and appreciate the
&gt;&gt;&gt; fact that we knew what the hell we were doing.
&gt;&gt; It aint rocket science, monkey.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we had *tests* on the things....
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whoopy do.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and learned to deal with every day idiots
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any monkey can do that.
&gt;&gt;&gt; no.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt;&gt; dealing with customers effectively is a SKILL.
&gt;&gt; Bullshit. No more a SKILL than working out
&gt;&gt; how to pass the items over the scanner is.
&gt;&gt; Any monkey can do it with minimal 'training'
&gt;&gt;&gt; some people are good at developing this skill, others not so.
&gt;&gt; Any monkey can do it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (and not-so-everyday total choads),
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That too.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get back to me on how it's &quot;not worth more than minumum wage&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Corse its not. Have fun listing work thats easier.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; since when are most jobs paid based on their ease?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Having fun thrashing that straw man ?
&gt;&gt;&gt; you brought it up.
&gt;&gt; You're lying now.
&gt;&gt;&gt; in your statement, one can infer that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;easy&quot; jobs should be paid at a lower rate.
&gt;&gt; Only a stupid monkey would 'infer' anything of the sort.
&gt;&gt; No surprise that you're stuck with such
&gt;&gt; a trivial 'job' that any monkey can do.
&gt; i am not stuck with a &quot;trivial&quot; job and even
&gt; when i worked as a cashier, i was not.

"/> Corse you were.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Most of the customers can do it too.
&gt;&gt;&gt; how do you define &quot;easy&quot;?
&gt;&gt; Too obvious to require defining except for a minimum wage monkey.
&gt;&gt; Thats why they are a minimum wage monkey.
&gt; who are we talking about here?

"/> Three guesses ?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; physical labor involved? mental faculties needed? what?

&gt;&gt; Because you don't get the &quot;sale&quot; prices without one. We all know that

You should have asked to speak to the manager and told him that this
was very disturbing, and can he please do something about it.

Always be polite with this kind of problem, it isn't the restaurant's

Funny.
I just have to add this.

A couple of weeks ago, I was in a KFC around suppertime and this is
what the 20-something woman in line ahead of me was saying on her cell
phone:

&quot;OK, I'm here. There's a lot of people here. I'm 1-2-3-4-5-6-7th in
line.
[pause]

OK. I'm looking at the menu. [looks around]. Two more people came in.
[pause]

OK, one more person left. There're 6 more people in front of
me........&quot;

It went on until the last thing I heard was, &quot;OK, I'm walking out the
door&quot;.

What ever happened to common courtesy? Don't mothers teach their
children manners any longer?

I think you are full of it to a degree. Yes, some parents do set a bad
example but, allot of parents DO still displain their children. How can
you talk about bad behavior in children when you don't have children of
your own? Yes there are certain moms and dads out there that don't make
their children behave but not all of us. You make it sound like every
parent and child is out of control. I think you are right about one
thing though. I don't think young people under the age of 27 should have
children. Their just kids their self's. The reason I say this is
because children are allot of reposablity. I had my first child when I
was 29. I was married for about 8 years when our son was born. I thought
I was ready. In some ways I was and in other ways I wasn't. I wasn't
ready for the 2 o&quot; clock feeding, no sleep ect. Unless you have children
of your own, you don't know what you are talking about and quit
listening to everybody that agrees with you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Would agree with you here, but it is also interesting to
&gt;&gt;&gt;consider why the behaviour of current generations has
&gt;&gt;&gt;deteriorated so much.

&gt;&gt;&gt;However, there are others. If we go back to the sixties in
&gt;&gt;&gt;the US we find a lot of rebellion. Some justified, some
&gt;&gt;&gt;not.

&gt;&gt;&gt;In any case, many of these rebellious people have become
&gt;&gt;&gt;parents, and many are incapable of controlling their
&gt;&gt;&gt;children.

&gt;&gt;I would agree. Even Dr. Spock recanted some of his earlier &quot;flower child&quot;
&gt;&gt;philosophy on discipline free child raising.

&gt; Recanted quite a few of his earlier recommendations, didn't
&gt; he? However by that time most of the damage had been done.

&gt; From memory, his kids didn't think much of his parenting
&gt; style either.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Parents don't always set very good examples. If you are a
&gt;&gt;&gt;child and see daddy or mommy break the speed limit and
&gt;&gt;&gt;excuse their behaviour on the grounds that they are &quot;in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;hurry and there are no cops around&quot; what does that teach
&gt;&gt;&gt;you? ....That anything is permissible if you don't get
&gt;&gt;&gt;caught.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Great role models for the kids, eh? So why be surprised if
&gt;&gt;&gt;the kids are worse than their parents and their kids might
&gt;&gt;&gt;be worse still.

&gt;&gt;I don't have kids but have had neighbors with young. There's no longer any
&gt;&gt;doubt in my mind why there are so many screwed-up people in the world. I'm
&gt;&gt;not talking poor/disadvantaged people here but a relatively upscale
&gt;&gt;neighborhood; one neighbor a major US corporation vice president, an
&gt;&gt;attorney, retired pilots.

&gt; Research indicates that there are more psychopaths around
&gt; than most people think, about 1% of the general population,
&gt; more in corporations.

&gt; Actually was listening to an interesting program this
&gt; morning on Radio National which is also Radio Australia, our
&gt; overseas broadcasting service.

&gt; Can listen to them in the internet, and listen to recorded
&gt; programs with _Real Media | Windows Media_

&gt; Was listening to a repeat broadcast of the following
&gt; program:

&gt; -----
&gt; Psychopaths in Suits
&gt; Produced by Ian Walker
&gt; You need to be a little mad to go in to management, and you
&gt; need to be a bit mad to do it well.

&gt; But, there's a thin grey line.
&gt; [excerpts]

&gt; Ian Walker: Psychopaths…we usually only know them from
&gt; Hollywood movies, as serial killers, rapists or sadists. If
&gt; they made a movie about the unravelling saga of the Enron
&gt; collapse, no-one would get killed…but the main characters
&gt; would still be as chilling and ruthless as any baddie from a
&gt; B-grade horror flick.

&gt; Psychopaths people our nightmares and literature, but we
&gt; never expect them to enter our real life.

&gt; But the psychopath is closer than you think.

&gt; Most of them function incognito in high-powered professions
&gt; like the law, politics, entertainment, the church, the
&gt; military, trade unions, the media and the arts.

&gt; All the way to the very top.

&gt; Professor Robert Hare: They look and dress the same way as
&gt; most businessmen, they may even use the same language. Some
&gt; of these people are fairly persuasive, they can manipulate,
&gt; they’re very charming, some of them even charismatic. And a
&gt; lot of people, they like them, they think they’re kind of
&gt; fun to be around, but it takes a long time before you can
&gt; figure out that something is really amiss here.

&gt; Ian Walker: This week, we find out what happens when the
&gt; psychopath goes to work… with hair-rising stories of toxic
&gt; bosses, irrational CEOs, backstabbling co-workers, serial
&gt; bullies and malignant narcissists. No-one gets killed, but
&gt; there’s plenty of blood on the carpet.

&gt; And we ask the question: is economic pressure on modern-day
&gt; workplaces and corporate culture itself helping to create a
&gt; world where psychopathic behaviour is flourishing and even
&gt; being rewarded?

&gt; Plus, stay tuned for a few tips from the experts in how to
&gt; spot a “psychopath in a suit”.
&gt; -------
&gt; The now-infamous Enron Tapes provide a good example…those
&gt; truly shocking recordings of phone conversations between the
&gt; ruthless electricity futures traders from the company. Their
&gt; skulduggery helped black out the power grid in California,
&gt; and cost the State billions of dollars.
&gt; ------
&gt; But what happens when the aberrant behaviour of our leaders
&gt; becomes malignant, maybe criminal, perhaps even
&gt; psychopathic? What are the signs? And how would we know what
&gt; to do?

&gt; Easily the best person to ask is Canada’s Robert Hare. He’s
&gt; the world’s pre-eminent expert on psychopathy and a regular
&gt; advisor to the FBI. In the ‘70s, Hare developed what’s known
&gt; as the Psychopathy Checklist, or PCL, which is used as the
&gt; international standard by police and mental health
&gt; professionals to determine who qualifies as a psychopath.
&gt; He’s spent much of his working life inside prisons, studying
&gt; hardcore criminal psychopaths, mostly murderers and serial
&gt; rapists.

&gt; More recently though, he’s shifted his focus to the
&gt; workplace and has now teamed up with Paul Babiak to help
&gt; corporations identify the psychopath at work.

&gt; Robert Hare: We estimate, on the basis of some reasonably
&gt; decent data, that about 1% of the general population will
&gt; meet our criteria for psychopathy. And in the business
&gt; world, the prevalence debatably could be somewhat higher,
&gt; dependent upon the organisation. The problem for the
&gt; organisation is that only one or two of these people can do
&gt; enormous damage, particularly if they get very high up in
&gt; the organisation.

"/> Well Margie, I take a little offense to your attitude. DH and I were 19
when I had my first and went onto to have a few more. We were married
and we made a mature decision to have kids. Our kids turned out just
fine. All have post-secondary education (1 degree, a couple have
higher) and good paying jobs as does DH (1 degree) and myself (3
degrees, 1 diploma). They have never been in trouble with the law and
they are responsible members of society. Just because you made the
choice to wait until you were over 27 does not make that the *right*
choice for others. Many decide to have kids at a younger age and quite
frankly, I'm glad we did. Our kids are now grown so we are rather young
empty nesters and we are enjoying ourselves! Oh and we are what you
would consider semi-retired even though we are well under the age of 50.

OTOH, I more than agree with you on those who never have had kids giving
advice. They know little about the actual process since they have not
experienced the daily ins and outs of it. Oh they might have read about
how to raise kids in books or perhaps even helped out with a few young
kids, but that is not the same as having the full responsibility og your
own kid. Personally, I give little credance to those types who yip off
yet have not raised kids of their own. Most of these types are full of
ideals with no experience ;) IMO, their choice was to not have kids so
don't try telling someone who does have kids how to raise them.

To keep this legit, I'm posting from mcfl. Raising kids can be frugal
or very expensive depending on your choices. We decided on raising ours
in a frugal manner, teaching them a frugal lifestyle. Our methods
worked for us but that does not in any way, shape or form imply other
methods do not work. To each their own :)

Do ALL cell phones sound like rocks to the user? Regular phones provide
a certain amount of feedback so you can sort of tell how loud you're
talking, but cells don't. I make one call per month, generally when
nobody else is around and from my own home (which is in a
zero-to-one-bar area) so I have no idea how loudly I speak...

Give her a break. She's sleep deprived, she had kid(s) rather late

Some of her ideas have a wide field of usefulness. For instance,

=======
Summer series 5: The Holy Reich
21 January 2004

[introduction extract]
Far from being a neo-pagan movement opposed to Christianity
in all its forms, Nazism had strong ideological roots in
Christianity - particularly in liberal Protestantism, which
allowed room for Nazi ideologues to develop such theories as
the one that said Jesus was an Aryan. That's the argument
being advanced by Richard Steigmann-Gall in a new book, &quot;The
Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity 1919-1945&quot;, and
this week we talk with Richard Steigmann-Gall about the
German Protestant churches and their complicity in Nazi
policies of anti-semitism, eugenics and racial purity.

Full program transcript at following URL.

"/> Yep, BTDT and usually let it go out the other ear. Personally, I tried
to keep out of others business as far as raising their kids. After all,
I may have known them quite well but still didn't know what was going on
in the household.

BTW, I can still recall a time when an mother of one of our kid's
friends called frantic because her kid hadn't come home. I guess the
kid said she was at our house. It didn't matter as we knew where our
kid was but offered to help look for the other kid. It turns out at age
13 the kid was arrested :( At age 15, the kid had her first kid.
Honesty, I wouldn't know what to say to a parent going through this.
I'm sure the parent has a large enough bat to hit themselves with. I
really feel sorry for them but secretely I'm glad it wasn't my kid. I
know that sounds a selfish but I can't help it. I did hear through the
grapevine the kid had her kid removed for neglect, then the mother took
over, then the kid got mixed up in legal issues, and now the mother has
custody of the grandkid. Sad really.

Methinks you are making up your own rules here Kent - no real difference
between talking on the phone and talking to a companion - except you can't
eavesdrop on the other half of the conversation

&gt;&gt;It's bad manners if the conversation is loud, or goes on for a prolonged
&gt;&gt;period (which it sounds like this one did, if she was &quot;documenting&quot; her
&gt;&gt;positon in line all the way through). In general, making personal phone
&gt;&gt;calls in close, crowded spaces IS considered bad manners

&gt; Is it bad manners to have the same conversation when the other person

&gt; telephone is involved make all the difference between &quot;rude&quot; and &quot;not
&gt; rude?&quot;

"/> I suspect it's just easier for some to tune out background conversation that
go on continually rather than one that runs for 20 seconds, pauses for 20
seconds, resumes for 20 seconds, pauses for 20 seconds. That constant jump
between silence and noise keeps bringing one's attention back to the
presence of the noise.
