*COMMON FEVER*

When your forehead feels hot enough to fry an egg, your body is shaking
like Jell-O and your teeth are chattering, it's hard to believe that fever
is your friend.
But it is.

A fever isn't a disease. It's a *symptom* of an infection, typically caused
by a cold or the flu. When you have a cold, for instance, your immune system
signals to your brain that it needs more body heat in order to attack
infectious cells, and your body temperature rises.

There are some tried-and-true procedures that can help bring down the fever
and make you more comfortable. Here's what doctors recommend.

Causes
Fever is caused due to the aggravation of any one or all the doshas of the
body. Fever can occur as a result of infection, because of external injury,
insect bite or poisoning. It must be kept in mind that fever can also be a
symptom of many conditions, like bronchitis, pleurisy, tuberculosis,
jaundice, malaria, measles or influenza.

Home remedies for Fever

Some general remedies that are beneficial in fever are:

- Mild sweating: this helps to digest the toxins. Lie on a bed covered
with a blanket, for 15 to 20 minutes. Drinking a hot liquid also helps.
- Take 10 grams (one-tablespoon) raisins and 10 grams (one tablespoon)
fresh ginger. Crush and put in 200-ml. water for one hour. Boil this
decoction till the water reduces to 50 ml. Strain and drink while warm.

*Dosage:* This preparation can be taken twice a day.

Holy Basil:
One of the effective home remedies for common fever is the holy basil. Make
a potion using about twelve grams of these holy basil leaves, boiling them
in half a liter of water. This should be given twice daily with half a cup
of milk, one teaspoon of sugar and a quarter teaspoon of powdered cardamom
(chhoti elaichi) to the diseased. This will help in bringing down the
temperature.

Fenugreek Seeds:
Drink tea made from fenugreek seeds twice daily. It is very beneficial as a
cleansing and soothing drink. It is specifically helpful in dissolving
mucus.

Saffron:
Another useful home treatment is tea made from saffron. Prepare this tea by
putting half a teaspoon of saffron in 30 ml of boiling water. Give a tsp of
this tea to the patient every hour till the temperature returns to normal.

Raisins:
The extract from raisins is quite helpful in the treatment of common fever.
Prepare this extract by soaking twenty-five raisins in half a cup of water
and crushing them in the same water. Strain the potion and discard the skin.
The raisin water thus prepared becomes a tonic. Adding half a teaspoon of
limejuice to the extract for enhancing its usefulness. Take this twice
daily.

Apricot:
A cup of fresh juice of apricots mixed with one teaspoon of glucose or honey
is quite good for fevers. It quenches the thirst and eliminates the waste
products from the body. It also supplies vitamins and minerals to the body.
Thus, it helps in toning up the eyes, stomach, liver, heart, and nerves.

Grapefruit:
The juice of grapefruit is valuable in all fevers. Helpful in quenching
thirst, it also removes the burning sensation produced by the fever. Half a
glass of grapefruit juice should be taken with half a glass of water.

Orange:
Another ideal food in all types of fever is orange. It provides energy,
increases urinary output, and promotes body resistance against infections.
It is especially effective when the digestive power of the body is seriously
hampered.

Home remedies for fever #1: Drink as much water as you can in order to
replace fluid loss. It will also help to bring down body  temperature.

Home remedies for fever #2:Rest as much as possible.

Home remedies for fever #3:Avoid suddenly changes in atmospheric
temperatures.

Home remedies for fever #4:Avoid eating solid foods until the fever is gone.
You can replace the foods by drinking plenty of distilled water and/or
juices.

Home remedies for fever #5:when you have fever do not take any supplement
containing either iron or zinc. Taking iron causes great tension in a body
that is fighting infection; and zinc is not absorbed by the body when you
have fever.

Home remedies for fever #6:Take cool bathes, fill a bath tub, submerge and
lay down for 5' approximately. Repeat as needed until the fever is down.

Home remedies for fever #7:If the fever does not exceed 102 degrees let it
run its course. It helps the body to fight infection and eliminate toxins.

Home remedies for fever #8:When a child has fever do not give them aspirin,
instead try to reduce the fever with cold baths.

*When to See the Doctor* It's a myth that high temperatures can 'boil your
brain,&quot;' says Thomas Rosenthal, M.D., associate professor of family medicine
at the State University of New York at Buffalo. &quot;Most adults can tolerate
five points above the normal body temperature.&quot; Brain damage doesn't happen
until your temperature reaches 107°F, which rarely happens, he says. Adults
over age 60, however, are less likely to mount an immune defense. For them,
fever may be more taxing on the heart and thus more risky. With that in
mind, contact the doctor immediately for:

- Fever above 103° in an adult.
- Fever of 101° if you're over age 60.
- Fever above 102° in a child (or if the child is vomiting or
convulsing or has a headache).
- Any fever in a baby under three months old.
- Any fever if you have a chronic illness such as diabetes, heart
disease or lung disease.
- Fever that lingers more than three days.
- Fever accompanied by a rash, severe headache, stiff neck, confusion,
back pain or painful urination.
