Some politically conservative Christians say that America is &quot;a
Christian nation,&quot; and at this time of year, with the country
saturated with Christmas imagery, it can seem that they are right. Are
they? Is America a &quot;Christian nation&quot;? Should it be?

That is an excellent question.

Probably so, what is the alternative?

Buddhism is OK, but Buddhism offers little in charitable work as the
Christians do.

&quot;Real Buddhists&quot; detach themselves from life to escape samara, begging
for their food, not handling money, not reproducing. Not very
practical for a flourishing US economy. Even if money be damned, we
can't all beg off each other. And someone has to make the electric and
process the human waste. Early Buddhists realized this problem and
Mahayana and Pure Land Buddhism was invented to get around some of
this problem.

See:

http://jesusneverexisted.org/jne/forum/index.php?topic=508.0

In addition, the Christians can defend us in war, where the Buddhists
would end up like the monks do in Burma.

Should our country be an atheist run country like China, Russia or
Burma?

I think history answers that question.

Atheists like to fantasize what the world would be like if religion
would never have been invented.

Sure Christians do bad things, so do all practitioners in other
religions. Each religion contains perfection's as well as
imperfections. It is up to the practitioner or end user to use the
tools in the right way.

This just proves the point that 'knowledge without application is
useless' and this applies to every religion known to mankind as well
as to the atheists religion of secular humanism.

The problem is not the wisdom that is defective. The problem lies with
religious practitioners who are defective in their practice of this
wisdom. The wisdom works - we don't work the wisdom.

Taoists tell us - &quot;fleas come with the dog.&quot; So we must accept that
every man made religion has some problems and defects within it.

But many of these religious practitioners also do good things. You
never see atheists taking up charitable works and feeding and clothing
the poor in any organized way as Christians do.

There may be the odd atheists philanthropists here or there, but
nothing organized like Christians charitable organizations. I wrote to
the president of American Atheists, UK Atheists, the Secular Humanism
Foundation, Sam Harris and others about this very topic...none had the
courtesy to reply.

Shows how much interest atheists really have in humanity.

No, I prefer to keep things as they are and allow freedom for ALL
religions, even with all their imperfections.

I believe religions do more good than harm. We can see that come to
fruition with the many countries that the US has defeated in war. If
we were a country that did not apply Christian principles to our
captors, millions more would have been killed.

Atheist run countries have a policy of extermination and ethnic
cleansing rather than applying charity. Atheist like to claim religion
killed so many people...well without religion in world the killings
would have been much worse in an all atheist world.

When we sperate the personalities from the principles, it makes
looking at things much easier. When I am referring to Christian
principles I speak of such things as charity, works of mercy and the
golden rule, where the emphasis is on principles and not on the
personalities of the church such as the Pope or Jesus.

For even if Jesus was just created as a fable, these foundational
Christian principles are universal truths in their own right if one
desires to live a life at peace and promote the inner peace of others
in this world.

The Christian ethic says to treat one another as we would wish to be
treated. As we give ~ so we receive. Is this a bad policy for the US
to stand behind? No one says the US has to label itself Catholic,
Lutheran or Presbyterian. But the fact still remains that as you
instill seeds of peace within others you plant the same seeds and
water these seeds within you as well.

As James Allen wrote ~ &quot;To think well of all, to be cheerful with all,
to patiently learn to find the good in all - such unselfish thoughts
are the very portals of heaven; and to dwell day by day in thoughts of
peace toward every creature will bring abounding peace to their
possessor.&quot;

As for the mix of spiritual based or atheistic persons in the US or
the world? I shudder to think what the world would be like if it was
composed solely of atheists.

See:

http://jesusneverexisted.org/jne/forum/index.php?topic=509.0

The facts show clearly that when people are devoid of religion they
generally stink as humane humans. But I also like to keep the atheists
around to remind us all to come back to earth once in while and look
for truth...especially when some of us start to kill in the name of
God.

A Hindu sage once told me -

&quot;Just as water floes downhill without effort but requires outside
forces and energy to make it move uphill. So the human consciousness
falls to its lowest levels of the senses without effort and energies
to make our consciousness gravitate to more than our base desires.&quot;

As such, religion and the search for spiritual values are the lesser
of two evils with humans, if the other choice is a life devoid of
spiritual values.

Now, spiritual values and atheists do not generally mix?

An anonymous atheist once told me:

&quot;What is spirit or spirituality V?  Without knowing what you mean by
the word, one can't know what you mean.  Why study something for which
you not only have no evidence, but not even a definition?&quot;

Yes, spiritual concepts are hard to define, just as the source of the
wind is hard to define. Since spiritual matters deal with the unseen
and the unknown, how can we define them perfectly?

If we could do that they would not be spiritual studies.

You can't see why one person is loving and kind and another person is
a fiend of perennial shame, hate and destruction. Nor can you see what
made the hate monger change into a kind and loving human.

We can describe spiritual concepts and the journey that made the
change possible, but it is impossible to put our finger on it all
exactly.

Spiritual growth is a journey that is a never ending, an imperfect
process in this life.  But just as we can see the effects of the wind,
while being blind to its source; we can most definitely see the
difference in people that incorporate spiritual values within their
lives when compared to people that live a life devoid of any spiritual
values.

&quot;No man is so wise that he may not easily err if he takes no other
counsel than his own. He that is taught only by himself has a fool for
a master.&quot; Ben Jonson

No one said we have to 'investigate it all,' but we do have to give it
some thought if we wish to be at peace.

That is the beauty of being a freethinker. We can think for ourselves.
As such, when we get a toolbox we can decide which tools to use for
the job. Some tools are used a lot, other tools are left alone for the
time being, and still others are trashed when we see they are broken
and useless.

Traditional freethinkers (atheists) do not accept me as one of their
group, since I draw from spiritual paths as well as wordily areas to
garner wisdom to live at peace.

Traditional freethinkers do not like anything that comes from
religion.

Kind of a misnomer isn't it...I'm a freethinker...but I must block out
everything that comes from religion and spiritual traditions and
whatever other prejudice I wish to inject into the equation?

See:

http://jesusneverexisted.org/jne/forum/index.php?topic=470.0

Psychologist William James once said, &quot;A great many people believe
they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.&quot;

When we limit prejudice we can open our minds to truth and peace. And
realize the truth of Blake's words that &quot;all deities reside within the
human breast.&quot;

Yes, if it is religion that an atheists need to adopt, they only have
to look as far as the religion of humanity. But just paying secular
humanism lip service will not do any good. Our talk of spiritual
values must match our actions.

See:

http://groups.google.com/group/alt.atheism/browse_frm/thread/769d7275...

It would be nice if humans acted logically and their actions only
worked to make their species flourish and promoted inner peace to all
- but they don't.

Humans need moral guidance or a moral conscience since they have a
'free will' of sorts.

Actually it is like this.

We are free to do what we want -- but are not free to want what we
want.

All our actions have consequences, and many of our actions produce
consequences that end up destroying peace. (both ours and other's
peace).

This is what separates us from the animals that run solely on
instinct.

Humans run by instinct as well as moral guidance. And religion offers
a prepackaged set of morals for humans to adhere to.

Whether this moral conscience in divinely inspired or from Nature I
don't know - that is why I am an agnostic.

But If I had to guess I would lean towards the atheistic view of
Nature based conscience, since I have not found any evidence of a God
such as the monotheists claim....but as an agnostic I keep looking.

And as I look with an open mind, I am reminded each day that there are
powers greater than myself in charge and we are all interdependent and
not independent with one another and hope one day we can all come to
realize that we all share the same breath.

To claim our nation as a christian nation would seem to suggest that
other religions are lesser in this nation.  Just because christianity
might be the most popular religion in our nation does not mean we
should claim our nation to be a christian nation it is an attack on
freedom of religion imo.  It would make this country less valued by
other countrys that do not see religion in the same way thus probably
having a negitive effect on our economy.

I can think of alot of reasons for us to not claim our nation as a
christian one but I have a hard time coming up with reasons to do it.
Especialy when it isnt a 100% christian nation.

But when that government allows mystical airy-fairy crap to influence
its descisions and laws, e.g. immoral drug laws and dopey marriage
laws, then what you claim the founding fathers didn't want, in reality
did and does happen to this very day.

Crazy people people will form crazy governments.

Dont get me wrong, I am a big fan of a constitution which limits the
power of government and which allows the citizens to rise in revolt,
which was the primary focus of the founding fathers, what I am saying
is, they just didn't get it quite right and were hypocrites in more
than one instant, so dont throw out the baby with the bath-water.

What I think most pundits mean when they say &quot;Christian Nation&quot; or
&quot;founded upon Judeo-Christian values&quot; is that the moral/cultural sense
or inclination of the nation is greatly influenced by Christian
values.  While personally I think this influence is fairly small (much
less then it should be), when compared to other nations it may seem
large.

Just look at one issue &quot;freedom of religion&quot;.  This idea while
mentioned by other cultures, is a predominately American idea.  This
idea propagated to other nations from the US.  This idea got its root
in the US because of our religious - Christian - heritage.

Sorry, it is based on Christian
princebles.

For centuries Protestants have found a convenient division between
the
first and second tables of the ten-commandment law. Roger Williams,
the
founder of Rhode Island, was the first American to associate two
concepts: the separation of church and state and the two tables of
the
law. It was Williams, not Thomas Jefferson, who coined the phrase
about
a hedge, or wall, separating the garden of the church from the
wilderness of the state.
Williams also conceived that the first four commandments, or the
first
table of the law, addressed one's obligations to worship God, while
the
last six commandments, the second table, addressed one's civil
obligations. The American Protestant concept of separation of church
and state was largely built on this distinction. Thus state law could
properly address moral issues such as adultery, stealing, and murder
because these were in the second table of the law.
However, Puritan era &quot;first table&quot; laws against blasphemy, idolatry,
and even Sunday laws fell into disfavor, not merely because of
secular
trends, but because in the Protestant conception, these obligations
pertained not to the state but to God alone.
This division between the first and second tables of the law roughly
corresponds to the distinction between legislating religion and
morality. Under the First Amendment, the state has not jurisdiction
to
address essentially religious questions, such as when, where, how, or
whom to worship. The first table of the law is out of bounds to the
state. However, the second table of the law has always been the
subject
of civil law, despite the familiar adage that &quot;you can't legislate
morality.&quot; Actually, you can, and we do. The debate is never really
about whether to legislate morality, but to what extent and from what
source.
Under the American constitutional system, the state has no charge to
order public morality according to the second table of the
ten-commandment law, but neither is the state compelled to reject the
second table. It is entirely legitimate for Americans to invoke the
commandments in public policy debate, so long as the distinction
between the first and second tables is observed. The Constitution
does
not permit the state to arbitrate religious belief and practice or to
promote specific religious ideas. This means that the same Ten
Commandments that many Americans look to for the content of public
morality may be subject to constitutional restrictions when it comes
to
state efforts to publicly display and honor them. Although many view
restricting the display of the commandments as official disrespect,
it
is far better for government to maintain a strict &quot;hands-off&quot; policy
with respect to religion than to open a Pandora's box of public
promotion of religion.

When the USA was founded most people there were Christians. Since most
political structures come to reflect their subjects, or at least their
leaders, views and philosophies, then the USA should not be a
Christian country now, since it should reflect the views and
philosophies of its subjects.

Stereotypes are common in the world of drama, where the term is often
used as a form of dramatic shorthand for &quot;stock character&quot;.
Increasingly the active use of stereotypes in drama is a prerequisite
for an audience accepting them as legitimate. The unwitting use of
stereotypes appears hackneyed to a postmodern audience who refuses to
tolerate the representation of individuals as simply the stereotype.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype

Trait ascription bias is the tendency for people to view themselves as
relatively variable in terms of personality, behavior and mood while
viewing others as much more predictable in their personal traits
across different situations. This may be because our own internal
states are much more observable and available to us than those of
others.

This attributional bias has an obvious role in the formation and
maintenance of stereotypes and prejudice, combined with the negativity
effect.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_ascription_bias

Generalization is a foundational element of logic and human reasoning.
Generalization posits the existence of a domain or set of elements, as
well as one or more common characteristics shared by those elements.
As such, it is the essential basis of all valid deductive inference.
The process of verification is necessary to determine whether a
generalization holds true for any given situation.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization

Writers and speakers can exaggerate in a number of ways.  Statements
that make sweeping generalizations tend to exaggerate and oversimplify
reality, ignoring important details.  Generalizations are often useful
in persuasion if they are worded carefully and if they are accompanied
by clarifications and evidence.  Attempting to predict people's
behaviors leads us down the road to overgeneralization.  People often
infuse stereotypes into logical reasoning, leading to overgeneralized
conclusions.

Because, by a bit over 3 to 1, Christians *are* a majority of the population
of the United States, whether anyone likes it or not.

The fact is, the very egalitarian attitude reflected in the policies
*Christians* set in place and still *personally uphold*, concerning freedom
either of religion or freedom from religion for all citizens of the United
States, is not shared by the majority of citizens who are either adherents
of religions other than Christianity or those who claim no religion.

If any camp other than Christian were to have its way in the United States,
*everyone* else would be forced to believe as they do. (Looking out at the
countries of the world as they are today and have classically always been
proves that.) That of course includes atheists and other humanists who, for
decades now have had too much influence over our judicial and educational
systems, much more than they have ever earned through virtue of their actual
population numbers.

While we Christians believe in &quot;live-and-let-live&quot;, we don't receive that
kindness in return. It seems no matter what belief system is held other than
Christianity, almost all non-Christians share a desire to wipe Christianity
off the face of the Earth... and those who believe in it as well, if we
persist in our faith.

The only thing that stops that from happening isn't the &quot;milk of human
kindness&quot; flowing in the breasts of non-Christians toward their Christian
brothers, it's simply fear of reprisal. By whom? The United States. The fact
that Christians are in the vast majority in what happens to be the most
powerful country in the world... at the moment... is a big deterrent.

The separation between church and state is important because the state
is more objective.

If you'd like an official sponsor for your original cultural roots,
that might be acceptable.

For example you could call it, the church of America and model the

Your response is ironic because this is exactly what the founding
fathers did not want.  They considered the state &quot;less objective&quot; (if
I understand how you are using the word) then individuals, and they
did not want to constrains an individuals right to worship as they
pleased.  I.E. By forcing a state religion on them.  This was one of
the biggest flaws of Europe.  Political leaders used religion for
national reasons.  This ended up corrupting religion (and religious
leaders).  It also greatly inflamed the political leaders sense of
self-worth (i.e. God made me king so I can do whatever I want).  The
founding fathers where wise enough to see that while their authority
on earth came from God, they did not have the right to presume to
speak for God.  They wisely (via the first amendment) enshrined the
right for each individual to come to God on their own terms (without
political interference).  Unlike what many think today, they did not
seek to remove God from politics only to prevent politicians from
assuming the role of God.

Ben Franklin observed that while Philadelphia had lotsa churches, of
lotsa sects, with lotsa different versions of divine text, the one
thing they all worshiped was the Almighty Dollar.

Its also curious to look at the genuine silver coin to see where it
says &quot;In God we trust&quot;, but note that it has a *Goddess* on it.
Moreover, the most representative sacred monument we have, which
stands in the New York harbor, is that same *Goddess* of Liberty.

Why hasnt it dawned on everyone that the God is all about Tyranny, and
handing down &quot;His Law&quot;, while the Goddess is all about the freedom to
fulfill your own destiny rather than some divine plan?

The USA would do well to remember the treaty of Tripoli, signed by the
president and ratified by the senate, which plainly states that &quot;The
United States is not a Christian nation&quot;. That treaty permitted the US
to make agreements with Moslem nations at much better terms than was
given to the Christian nations of Europe.

If we are to maintain our republic and the traditions of freedom, we
must stay faithful to the Almighty Dollar.

It seems a bit of a stretch to me to propose that American law is
based on the 10 commandments, even the last six of them.  How many non-
christian countries allow murder or stealing?  Those are pretty much
common sense rules.  Adultery is not illegal in America, nor is it
illegal to dishonor your parents, nor in most cases is it illegal to
lie.  Coveting is the foundation of our economy.

&gt; It seems a bit of a stretch to me to propose that American law is
&gt; based on the 10 commandments, even the last six of them.  How many non-
&gt; christian countries allow murder or stealing?  Those are pretty much
&gt; common sense rules.  Adultery is not illegal in America, nor is it
&gt; illegal to dishonor your parents, nor in most cases is it illegal to
&gt; lie.  Coveting is the foundation of our economy.-

The point is the separation of church and state
is based on the two tables of the law. Before
Rhode Isand relgion and state were intertwined.

Right, and very well said.

But, it should be noted, our Founding Fathers' main concern was prevention
of the domination by one particular *Christian* sect to the exclusion of the
other *Christian* sects; this fact is noted over and over in the writings of
the Founders. That was the common practice in Europe, and the entire reason
the first settlers came to these shores seeking freedom to worship in the
manner they chose. It was suppression of their own ancestors' denominational
religious expression that greatly influenced our Founding Fathers during the
framing of the &quot;church and state&quot; law.

You're certainly an odd fellow MG, anyway:

&quot;In the United States, the &quot;Separation of Church and State&quot; is
generally discussed as political and legal principle derived from the
First Amendment of the United States Constitution, which reads,
&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . . .&quot; The concept of
separation is commonly credited to the combination of the two clauses:
the establishment clause, generally interpreted as preventing the
government from establishing a national religion, providing tax money
in support of religion, or otherwise favoring any single religion or
religion generally, and the free exercise clause, ensuring that
private religious practices not be restricted by the government. The
effect of prohibiting direct connections between religious and
governmental institutions while protecting private religious freedom
and autonomy has been termed the &quot;separation of church and state.&quot;

State religions typically stem from the cultural roots. Since religion
is very subjective the world wide states have needed to separate
themselves in order to enact common sense laws. For example you might
like to buy something on &quot;Sunday&quot; but your religion likely demands
that you don't buy things on Sunday. I would like to sometimes buy
things on Sunday.

The whole notion of the thread/meme likely has its roots in the
cultural youth of the USA. For example in England, most peoples don't
display national flags because I guess they have less need to
reinforce their cultural identity due to age of the nation.

Honest history? I think it's important to you since you believe that
&quot;Roger Williams&quot; came up with this concept and it therefore validates
your beliefs. But the &quot;separation&quot; of &quot;church&quot; and &quot;state&quot; appears
much earlier in history in my opinion.

To answer the question, no. If anything, America would do well to
become Stoic, not Christian.
Jesus:&quot;Turn the other cheek.&quot; Epictetus:&quot;When attacked, consider what
lesson you may teach an innocent observer. If there be none, then what
you can teach your attacker. If he be unteachable, what you can teach
yourself. But in any  case, take care to preserve the condition of the
body which the divine has let you rent, and who may yet have further
use for it.&quot;

Jesus:&quot;Render unto Caesar...&quot; Epictetus:&quot;Caesar is a thief who stole
power, and you dont owe him a damn dime. If he puts a sword to your
throat, pay, but it is not a moral obligation.&quot;

St. Paul, in Philemon beseeches him to take back the slave Onesimus
kindly. Epictetus:&quot;You did not make your own body, the divine did.
Wherefore do you claim to own the body of another?&quot; He would have told
Philemon to shove a rope up his ass, and let Onesimus go free.

Christians built monumental churches. Stoics built schools.

These principles all stand in good accord with the US constitution.

V, you have provided some tough criticism of atheism and in the
dictatorial countries who enforce atheism you have a coherent
argument. If atheism alone were a full belief system then you would
have a point, however atheism is a vacuous belief system and one that
must be filled in. So for instance what was the belief system of the
atheists in power in the Soviet Union or currently in China? Atheism
alone has no answer to this level of detail.

In that religion is an old form of government and one that still is
operational (eg the middle-east) then we might portray atheism as a
belief in secular government, eacha government then being its own
'belief system'. Unless a government provides a full philosophy then
its own belief system will be incomplete. In the USA the first
colonies were religious colonies and their enforcement of religion was
serious business. And these were factious rebellious people. So we see
how the strings of social behavior pull and how maximum conformity is
in conflict with healthy diversity.

Tune around on a shortwave radio and you will be flooded with
religious programming from the USA. Travel to any third world country
and you will find Christian institutions still training the local
populations their hymns. I walked by one of these in Guatemala and
their voices were beautifully co-opted. Still the population there

V, you have provided some tough criticism of atheism and in the
dictatorial countries who enforce atheism you have a coherent
argument. If atheism alone were a full belief system then you would
have a deeply strong point, however atheism is a vacuous belief system
and one that must be filled in. So for instance what was the belief
system of the atheists in power in the Soviet Union or currently in
China? Atheism alone has no answer to this level of detail.

In that religion is an old form of government and one that still is

'belief system'. Unless a government provides a full philosophy then
its own belief system will be incomplete. In the USA the first
colonies were religious colonies and their enforcement of religion was
serious business. And these were factious rebellious people who could
not live happily under their old faction. So we see how the strings of
social behavior pull and how maximum conformity is in conflict with
healthy diversity.

Tune around on a shortwave radio and you will be flooded with
Christian programming from the USA. Travel to any third world country
and you will find Christian institutions still training the local
populations on hymns. I walked by one of these in Guatemala and
their voices were beautifully co-opted. Still the population there
holds their traditional religious practices hiking to the top of
volcanoes for worship and such nature based practices. Yet the
Christians would like to have wiped these behaviors out centuries ago.

Your respect for the Abrahamic religions is falsifiable. Current
events are the strongest evidence of three branches of the Abrahamic
religion so divided in their competition for righteousness. As the
Christian branches have been watered down by modern governmental form
the Muslims who still hold to the old ways have credence in the
competition. Such a cold analysis is what one should expect of a
freethinker so I differ with your self description which I have
included at the top of this post. Agnosticism is a weak position. You
are bowing to be socially acceptable to both sides. The agnostic
cannot have a strong belief system because he is happy to contradict
himself within his basis. I am saddened that Sagan was agnostic.
Still, I myself am happy to discuss these issues with anyone of any
belief system and upon abstracting the definition of God out
sufficiently the only thing that I have to quibble with is the
confusion over the Abrahamic definition of God. I therefor point out
that this is merely a three letter word and I will prefer to use the
word 'reality' to 'God' even under such abstract definitions.

Your prose is quite long and I am sorry I didn't get thoroughly to the
bottom but here is mine also pretty long but shorter. The one issue
which I really wish to dispute with you is the part which I quoted
above. I do not believe that the facts will support your claim.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you'd like an official sponsor for your original cultural roots,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that might be acceptable.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which would be pretty ironic.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your response is ironic because this is exactly what the founding
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fathers did not want.  They considered the state &quot;less objective&quot; (if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I understand how you are using the word) then individuals, and they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did not want to constrains an individuals right to worship as they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pleased.  I.E. By forcing a state religion on them.  This was one of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the biggest flaws of Europe.  Political leaders used religion for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; national reasons.  This ended up corrupting religion (and religious
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leaders).  It also greatly inflamed the political leaders sense of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-worth (i.e. God made me king so I can do whatever I want).  The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; founding fathers where wise enough to see that while their authority
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on earth came from God, they did not have the right to presume to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speak for God.  They wisely (via the first amendment) enshrined the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right for each individual to come to God on their own terms (without
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; political interference).  Unlike what many think today, they did not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seek to remove God from politics only to prevent politicians from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assuming the role of God.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Huh? &quot;The ****SEPARATION**** between church and state is important...&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Certainly it is important to you, but it was not important enough to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the founding fathers to put it into the constitution.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You're certainly an odd fellow MG, anyway:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;In the United States, the &quot;Separation of Church and State&quot; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generally discussed as political and legal principle derived from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First Amendment of the United States Constitution, which reads,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . . .&quot; The concept of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; separation is commonly credited to the combination of the two clauses:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the establishment clause, generally interpreted as preventing the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; government from establishing a national religion, providing tax money
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in support of religion, or otherwise favoring any single religion or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; religion generally, and the free exercise clause, ensuring that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; private religious practices not be restricted by the government. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effect of prohibiting direct connections between religious and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; governmental institutions while protecting private religious freedom
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and autonomy has been termed the &quot;separation of church and state.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HTH.-

&gt; &gt; &gt;    The question is where did the idea of
&gt; &gt; &gt;    seperation of church and state come
&gt; &gt; &gt;    from.

&gt; &gt; Why is that the question?

&gt;    It's called being honest to
&gt;    history.

&gt; &gt; &gt;  I believe Roger Williams work
&gt; &gt; &gt;    Roger Williams, The Bloody Tenent, Of Persecution for Cause of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Conscience

&gt; &gt; &gt; 1644

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions4.html

&gt; &gt; &gt;    was before the First Amendment

&gt; &gt; &gt;   and it is obvious Williams got his
&gt; &gt; &gt;   ideas from the Bible.

&gt; &gt; &gt;    Jim

&gt; &gt; &gt;    2Co 3:17 - Now the Lord is that Spirit:
&gt; &gt; &gt;                     and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
&gt; &gt; &gt;                      there is liberty.

&gt; &gt; State religions typically stem from the cultural roots. Since religion
&gt; &gt; is very subjective the world wide states have needed to separate
&gt; &gt; themselves in order to enact common sense laws. For example you might
&gt; &gt; like to buy something on &quot;Sunday&quot; but your religion likely demands
&gt; &gt; that you don't buy things on Sunday. I would like to sometimes buy
&gt; &gt; things on Sunday.

&gt; &gt; The whole notion of the thread/meme likely has its roots in the
&gt; &gt; cultural youth of the USA. For example in England, most peoples don't
&gt; &gt; display national flags because I guess they have less need to
&gt; &gt; reinforce their cultural identity due to age of the nation.-

&gt;    Do you want to erase Roger Williams and
&gt;    Christianity from history. You seem to have
&gt;    difficulty accepting facts you don't like.

As do you Jim, as do you.

&gt; V, you have provided some tough criticism of atheism and in the
&gt; dictatorial countries who enforce atheism you have a coherent
&gt; argument. If atheism alone were a full belief system then you would
&gt; have a deeply strong point, however atheism is a vacuous belief system
&gt; and one that must be filled in. So for instance what was the belief
&gt; system of the atheists in power in the Soviet Union or currently in
&gt; China? Atheism alone has no answer to this level of detail.

&gt; In that religion is an old form of government and one that still is
&gt; operational (eg the middle-east) then we might portray atheism as a
&gt; belief in secular government, each government then forming its own
&gt; 'belief system'. Unless a government provides a full philosophy then
&gt; its own belief system will be incomplete. In the USA the first
&gt; colonies were religious colonies and their enforcement of religion was
&gt; serious business. And these were factious rebellious people who could
&gt; not live happily under their old faction. So we see how the strings of
&gt; social behavior pull and how maximum conformity is in conflict with
&gt; healthy diversity.

&gt; Tune around on a shortwave radio and you will be flooded with
&gt; Christian programming from the USA. Travel to any third world country
&gt; and you will find Christian institutions still training the local
&gt; populations on hymns. I walked by one of these in Guatemala and
&gt; their voices were beautifully co-opted. Still the population there
&gt; holds their traditional religious practices hiking to the top of
&gt; volcanoes for worship and such nature based practices. Yet the
&gt; Christians would like to have wiped these behaviors out centuries ago.

&gt; Your respect for the Abrahamic religions is falsifiable. Current
&gt; events are the strongest evidence of three branches of the Abrahamic
&gt; religion so divided in their competition for righteousness. As the
&gt; Christian branches have been watered down by modern governmental form
&gt; the Muslims who still hold to the old ways have credence in the
&gt; competition. Such a cold analysis is what one should expect of a

&gt; are bowing to be socially acceptable to both sides. The agnostic
&gt; cannot have a strong belief system because he is happy to contradict
&gt; himself within his basis. I am saddened that Sagan was agnostic.

It is an historical fact that Rhode Isla was
founded by Roger Williams with religious
freedom for all.

Roger Williams was an English clergyman who, in 1636, left the
repressive atmosphere fostered by the Puritans of the Massachusetts
Bay Colony to found the first permanent European settlement in Rhode
Island. This settlement, called &quot;Providence Plantations&quot; was the first
organized colony in America to be founded on the principles of freedom
of thought and worship. The official name of Rhode Island is &quot;The
State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations&quot;. It can be traced in
this form back to the Royal Charter of 1663, granted to the Rhode
Island colonists by King Charles II of England. In the Charter, it is
the &quot;Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations&quot;.

Thanks for the education.
I wonder what Williams would make of modern times?
I really know very little about him but the free thought principle
seems strong.
I sometimes think that the protestant energy is still alive in my area
which is New Hampshire, which was part of the commonwealth of
Massachusetts.
Thank you Roger Williams for my freedom which I exercise regularly.
