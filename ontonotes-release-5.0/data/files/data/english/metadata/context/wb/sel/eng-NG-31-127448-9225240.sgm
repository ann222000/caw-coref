Raving's Guide to &quot;Congenital Thought Disorder&quot; *
===============================================

The medical perspective is based upon pathology.  ... fixing the
failure. .. curing the disease.

The handful of 'congenital thought disorders' are more essentially
strategies of awareness displacement &amp; trajectory. These are very
fundamental cognitive qualities. Because of developmental canalization
(specialization) they seem to be mutually excluding.  Once a person
gets into one pattern of spanning and traversing awareness, it rapidly
becomes a habit of a lifetime, the primary method of categorizing, of
filing, of indexing experience.

I assume that each person uses all the methods. Ignoring any one
method completely might be inviable. Yet, also we seem to favor one
method to the exclusion of all the other possibilities.

These thought styles (disorders in the medical perspective) are
evolved, functioning, effective, cognitive devices-engines-structures.
They are essential for cognition.

... being constrained to allude to them from the pathological medical
perspective causes huge problems.

More precisely, ...

- In the positive, functional sense, a person is apt to be only and
exactly one of these 'thought' types. There is no comorbidity!

- In the negative, pathological, nonfunctional sense, a person can
possess all of these disorders. Comorbidity is rife.

When medicine talks about these congenital thought disorders, it is
only perceiving the effect-outcome-consequence of something that is
not functioning.  .. A.K.A.  the crap which remains after the horse
has already bolted from the barn.

It is the classic medical error.  ... treating the symptom and not
the cause.

Because the cause is as yet unrecognized ( unappreciated ) treatment
focuses upon compensating for what is missing as opposed to fixing
(bringing to functional fruition) what ought to be functional at the
outset.  Primarily treating the secondary, follow on consequence is an
inefficient and dubious enterprise.

Here is a list of of various &quot;thought&quot; styles:

ADHD ~~~&gt; &quot;Awareness&quot; that is always finding focus.  Foreplay is
everything .  ... It's about getting there in a rush.  ... The chase.
A lifetime of learning, discovery and rediscovery.

OCD ~~~&gt; &quot;Awareness&quot; that is holding - steering - guiding focus. ...
self-directed. Winning is everything. The orgasm is everything.
Etc ...

Bipolar ~~~&gt; &quot;Awareness&quot; that is moving, tracking, searching,
surveying, sweeping, inertial, exhaustive, following  ... rolling
thunder

PDD ~~~&gt; &quot;Awareness&quot; that is coherent, fractal, pre-integrated,
virtual (equivalent everywhere, simultaneously),  totalistic.
Autistics are fully mature from a standing start .

Schizophrenia ~~~&gt; The connectivity of awareness has a tremendous
tensile strength. Crystalline thinking.  Tunneling association, the
long distance leap jump traverse across a thread of connection relies
on that tensile quality.  Schizophrenics are very together and
effective people  .. until that tyvek grisliness is overstressed and
shears.

Each of these (congenital) thought styles (disorders) is a specific
and unique method of traversing beyond the subjective limit horizon of
awareness!

.. of carrying &quot;awareness&quot; beyond the local focal awareness.

The various &quot;thought style&quot; serves as a tool for taking a broadly
swept awareness and packaging it into an agglomerated, commensurate
'whole'. This total package is very much larger space of consideration
than any single momentary experience of reality can provide. The
(congenital) &quot;thought style&quot; serves as the method by which the
momentary hyperfocused experience is connected to a lifetimes
accumulating and integrated overview.

The &quot;thought style&quot; describes the process of how a person traverses -
parses, connections of moment-by-moment &quot;awareness&quot;. There seems to be
a small handful of possibilities, with each person spending a life
primarily emphasizing, a genetically predisposed selection.

The &quot;thought personality&quot; also seems to be a lifelong formed habit.
Rather than describing awareness's method-of-traverse, the &quot;thought
personality&quot; describes the favored manner by which any-and-every
awareness is emphasized.  It describes an individual's choice of
hypersensitization. It represents what the individual most cares
about. It describes a person's specific ability. It's a description of
how the momentary awareness is shaped.

&quot;thought style&quot; and &quot;thought personality&quot; seem to act independently. I
have yet to discern any connection between  the shaping of a person's,
moment-by-moment awareness and the favored manner by which all such
momentary awareness's are traversed overall.  Knowing how a person
'thinks' specifically doesn't seem to impinge upon how all those
momentary experiences are strung together into a whole package.

Sexual dimorphism seems to provide yet another independent sculpting
agent for awareness. Males and females think differently at a very
fundamental level that directly effects awareness and is quite
distinctive. Female awareness is characterized by awareness which
initially increases in emphasis, being directly followed by a
relaxation of such emphasis. Spoken Icelandic is reputed (?) emphasize
and thence roll off the final consonant. It has a feminine quality to
it.

The male pattern of of momentary awareness is to build in emphasis and
thence cut sharply. It is as if the &quot;thought&quot; is connected at only one
end. Grunt. Fart.

Notice how the female pattern of rising and falling awareness matches
the stereotype of women preferring to reach consensus. Moreover, the
female awareness being coupled at both ends is reminiscent of 'style'.

Bisexuality seems to be distinctly different from the male/female
pattern of &quot;awareness dimorphism&quot; determined by sex. Bisexual
awareness has an emphasis which fluctuates emphasis variously at the
beginning, middle and end of the momentary experience. Bisexuals seem
to have an affinity for 'Gumbyism', the Pillsbury Dough boy, the
Michelin Man.  .. A.K.A. an overall variability in the manner of
emphasis  .. or perhaps an complete absence of male-female emphasized-
awareness dimorphism.

Perhaps, it might seem as if reducing a person's intellect down to 3
simple described attributes of &quot;awareness&quot; is pigeon holing a person,
that it is robbing the individual of that richness that characterizes
the human mind?

This is not the case whatsoever!  I have only described traits which
strongly reduce to intensely, extensively, repeated activities. Such
reduction merely amounts to describing the individual perspective that
a person habitually uses. It is a caricature of thought habit.  It is
the point of view that a person habitually adopts, it is a description
of the manner by which a person experiences life.

This 'caricature of thought habit' is not what makes a person's
intellect complex and interesting. Rather this very intense and
personal point of view, this perspective is a very precise notch
filter by which we lay down and sew together a non repeatable and
accumulating lifetime of memories and experiences. The richness is
sewn into the map that we individually build with our individual,
constant, specific, narrow and restrictive habits of awareness.

Cognition essentially involves perception, description, awareness.
These are more or less equivalent concepts.

Most important is that which we take overwhelmingly for granted and
deliberately IGNORE.

It is NOT that momentary experience of reality which is primarily
important for human intellectual ability. &quot;Awareness&quot; in the local,
momentary, immediate sense is a very limited, imprecise, volatile,
fleeting experience. ...

The feature that makes the human intellect is the appreciation,
recognition, understanding and context that we can imbue and explore
vis a vis the momentary focal experience.

Humans spend the first two decades of life constructing that
background, contextual guidance of the focal moment.  This the exactly
how we are able to boost the effectiveness of the focus. That implicit
background awareness of significance substantively contributes to the
phenomenon of consciousness.

Our cognitive ability is predominantly established by the cognizance
that we posses, regarding the focal, momentary experience's
significance over a life time's accumulation and integration of such
momentary experiences. That intelligence and complexity is
overwhelmingly dependent upon preprocessed thought. The preprocessed
intelligence is stored via location and ordering, the specifics of
what connects to what, the ordering of such, the manner by which it is
located and parsed.  The specific topology of the map by which we lay
out a lifetime of experience stores/holds the intellectual richness.
The bulk of the effort goes into the construction of this map.  Using
the reconstructed 'map', Doing look-up, using what has already been
learned is a very minor thing. This is the reason that people can
remain intelligent and effective even when they are deeply
incapacitated in the cognitive sense.

I suspect that it is essential for any person to have a specific,
constant, strongly constrained &quot;habit-of-awareness&quot;.  The activity
serves as a tool of registration, ordering and alignment. &quot;Thinking&quot;
without such a deliberately imposed constraint seems implausible.

Everyone has a very specific, narrow and constant point of view. .. a
constant reference perspective.

It is the single most valuable thing that a person can know of him
or her self.   It provides a great deal of context.

------------------------------------

Each &quot;thought style&quot; has it's advantages and limitations.  When the
adopted &quot;thought style&quot; is able to develop to mature effectiveness,
when the person finds him or her self in an environment that is well
suited for the given thought style, personality and sex, the
'Congenital Thought Disorder&quot; is not perceived. The person is
effective. There is no pathology.

That something is 'wrong', only becomes apparent

&quot;Bipolar disorder diagnoses increasing: U.S. study
Young males, adult females most commonly affected
Last Updated: Tuesday, September 4, 2007 | 3:02 PM ET
CBC News

There has been a significant increase in the number of adults and
children being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, with adult cases alone
doubling between 1994 and 2003, according to a new U.S. study.

The study, published in the September issue of Archives of General
Psychiatry, compared the increase in bipolar diagnoses among U.S.
patients 19 and under with those 20 and over from 1994 to 1995, and
through 2002 and 2003. ...

Increase could be due to diagnostic criteria

&quot;Either bipolar disorder was historically underdiagnosed in children
and adolescents and that problem has now been rectified, or bipolar
disorder is currently being overdiagnosed in this age group,&quot; reads
the report.

The authors of the study say it's critical that researchers and
clinicians reach a consensus regarding diagnostic assessment methods,
as many include symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD) in their criteria for bipolar disorder. ...

*chuckle*

I take this to imply that you aren't much of a disciple from the ADHD
school of &quot;thought style&quot;?

Only a tight arse alumni from Control Freak U. would presuppose that
it's all about holding and controlling 'focal awareness' (attention).

- How does a person find a focus at the very outset?
- How does a person discover an alternate focus if the pre-existing
one proves to be inappropriate?
- How does a person create a *new*, novel, non preexisting focus?
- How does a person alter or *break* focus once a death grip 'lock on'
has been acquired?
- How does a person &quot;learn&quot; and discover anything?

An ADHD &quot;thought style&quot; thinker learns what is required, when it's
necessary. It's a sort of 'just in time' scheduling for intellectual
process control.

Once a person finds a fruitful focus, they discard the been-there-done-
that which enabled them to arrive. It's purpose has been served and
the knowledge has lost it's relevance. It's easy to dismiss the
finding focus (&quot;cluing in&quot;) as being insignificant. It is particularly
easy to do such for a person who has no further interest in &quot;cluing
in&quot; aside for the function first arrival, a one shot, or infrequent
deal.

&quot;Cluing in&quot; is comparable to discovering something *new* about how
what you already 'know' relates to something else that you already
know. The new found contextual insight adds NOTHING to that which you
already know. Rather it's worth is based into 'cluing into' that which
is already known at some future occasion. In short, the person
improves their ability to use what they already possess.

Yeah. Another wit, said much the same thing ...

A door is what a dog is perpetually on the wrong side of.
-- Ogden Nash

Methinks that your nitwit is barking up the wrong leg!   &lt;grin&gt;

I would expect (predict  ... as in 'testable hypothesis' :))) ) that
the &quot;thought styles&quot; ( congenital thought disorders) are also present
in other animals. The differing &quot;thought styles&quot; each represent very
different, essential, fundamental cognitive, activities. They should
be expected to be ancient (? sorry, I've forgotten the appropriate
term. ) traits.

Finding focus is more or less as important as 'holding and controlling
focus'.  If a person lack the ability to do both tasks somewhat they
are in deep trouble.  Beyond that, there is nothing inherently wrong
in emphasizing one approach relative to another.  The constancy of
approach/perspective/POV/standpoint is very important.

What disgusts me about the decrepit, stone age quality of cognitive
science is that scientists are still falling into the trap of assuming
that it's mostly all about holding and controlling focal awareness.

&quot;Executive functioning&quot;, the holding and controlling of attention is
only one of multiple and essential cognitive activities. Attention is
far from being the *only* thing.

Cognitive Science is *still* incapable of propelling itself out of the
starting blocks!!!

Super yuk.

Wow.    ...  VoiceOfReason maintains a blind faith in the veracity of

Let's do a reality check.  From 'Nature' ...

News
Published online: 5 September 2007; | doi:10.1038/news070903-6
Schizophrenia genes 'favoured by evolution'
Sequences linked to brain disorder show hallmarks of natural
selection.

... The genetic data provide no clues as to the kind of advantage
that schizophrenia-linked genes might have offered. &quot;That is the big
question and we don't really have a good answer to that,&quot; admits
Crespi's colleague Steve Dorus of the University of Bath, UK. ...

http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070903/full/070903-6.html

It is suggest that there is a fitness advantage to genes associated
with schizophrenia but the specific  advantages that the association
confers remains obscure and confusing.

Roughly O.K.  eh?

One can play the game that schizophrenia *really* isn't a good thing,
only it actually turns out to be good for some as yet to be understood
cross coupled advantage.  .. cough, cough, mumble, mumble ...

Or you could simply come out and say *directly*  that schizophrenia is
successful &amp; effective phenotype.

This naturally leads to the proverbial &quot;WTF?&quot;  ....

As in ... schizophrenia is a hideous cruelty inflicted upon the
tinfoil sombrero &quot;in crowd&quot;.  There is no way in a trillion years that
those nut jobs could be legitimate intellects !!!

Well, this raving Canadian loon has provided a reasonable hypothesis
which explains the mechanism by which 5 fundamental congenital thought
disorders, each represent a unique and individual solution to one
single, formidable, overbearing predicament/problem.

Please feel free to suggest an alternate competing hypothesis.

&gt; &gt; &quot;Bipolar disorder diagnoses increasing: U.S. study
&gt; &gt; Young males, adult females most commonly affected
&gt; &gt; Last Updated: Tuesday, September 4, 2007 | 3:02 PM ET
&gt; &gt; CBC News

&gt; &gt; There has been a significant increase in the number of adults and
&gt; &gt; children being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, with adult cases alone
&gt; &gt; doubling between 1994 and 2003, according to a new U.S. study.

&gt; &gt; The study, published in the September issue of Archives of General
&gt; &gt; Psychiatry, compared the increase in bipolar diagnoses among U.S.
&gt; &gt; patients 19 and under with those 20 and over from 1994 to 1995, and
&gt; &gt; through 2002 and 2003. ...

&gt; &gt; Increase could be due to diagnostic criteria

&gt; &gt; &quot;Either bipolar disorder was historically underdiagnosed in children
&gt; &gt; and adolescents and that problem has now been rectified, or bipolar
&gt; &gt; disorder is currently being overdiagnosed in this age group,&quot; reads
&gt; &gt; the report.

&gt; &gt; The authors of the study say it's critical that researchers and
&gt; &gt; clinicians reach a consensus regarding diagnostic assessment methods,
&gt; &gt; as many include symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
&gt; &gt; (ADHD) in their criteria for bipolar disorder. ...

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Here is a list of of various &quot;thought&quot; styles:

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;ADHD ~~~&gt; &quot;Awareness&quot; that is always finding focus.  Foreplay is
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;everything .  ... It's about getting there in a rush.  ... The chase.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;A lifetime of learning, discovery and rediscovery.

&gt; &gt;&gt;This might describe the mind of a dog....

&gt; &gt; *chuckle*

&gt; &gt; I take this to imply that you aren't much of a disciple from the ADHD
&gt; &gt; school of &quot;thought style&quot;?

&gt; I'm a disciple of the &quot;Goldilocks&quot; school of thought style.

&gt; &gt; Only a tight arse alumni from Control Freak U. would presuppose that
&gt; &gt; it's all about holding and controlling 'focal awareness' (attention).

&gt; &gt; - How does a person find a focus at the very outset?
&gt; &gt; - How does a person discover an alternate focus if the pre-existing
&gt; &gt; one proves to be inappropriate?
&gt; &gt; - How does a person create a *new*, novel, non preexisting focus?
&gt; &gt; - How does a person alter or *break* focus once a death grip 'lock on'
&gt; &gt; has been acquired?
&gt; &gt; - How does a person &quot;learn&quot; and discover anything?

&gt; By balancing one's mind at the &quot;Goldilocks&quot; point of course -- not too
&gt; much ADHD, not too much Pitbull death grip, but ju...sssst the right
&gt; amount of focus.

&gt; &gt; An ADHD &quot;thought style&quot; thinker learns what is required, when it's
&gt; &gt; necessary. It's a sort of 'just in time' scheduling for intellectual
&gt; &gt; process control.

&gt; The Web is creating millions of ADHD &quot;thought style&quot; thinkers who
&gt; gleefully click on every hyperlink they see and instantly forget the
&gt; previous web page they were on, like dogs running from one room to another.
">

Nope. Each person is apt to be in possession of but a single, hard
wired, life long passion.

... Canalization of a developmental process, eh.

As for the  ... &quot;they see and instantly forget the previous web page
they were on&quot; ... bit. ...

.. yah rilly dunnah git it yet, do you.

ADHD style thinkers don't need much stinkin' memory. Easy come, easy
go. Memory can be a liability. It  tends to cramp one's style and
creativity by bunging up the awareness with too many counterproductive
constraints.  In the main, a post secondary school education fills the
young brain with an Alice in Wonderland litany of what one cannot or
ought not attempt to accomplish.

I know that education never 'intended' to be that way.  .. But  hey,
what else can one expect from a YetAnotherBuggeredUpCognitiveScience,
huh?

ADHD style thinking is all about discovering and creating
connections,. Given that &quot;connectivity&quot; is continuously being
created ... loosing connections is not troubling. Frankly, it can be
rejuvenating and invigorating.

Discovering, rediscoving, learning, relearning is the normal state of
affair. .. that which is lost will come around again. I can trust in
my ability and experience that it will be so.

Each thought style has it's own method. Each thought style has
advantage and disadvantage. Differint situations suit various styles ,
better or worse.

There is no single optimal answer. .. There is no compelling reason to
expect that such a global optimum would of necessity, exist.

Cordially,

Raving

Perhaps the genes convey advantage by themselves but when combined
result is schizophrenia? The things they give advantage for might be
completely unrelated.

Um. ...

Insofar as Dr. Subtilis is one of my heroes, dare I appeal to
Jackhammer's razor?...

As in ..
Wot'z so 'rong with the straight and obvious, ici?

In the main, the schizophrenic thought style is a successful and
effective phenotype. However, as with other phenotypes, one specific
strategy is not ideal for every situation.

Shit happens. The schizophrenic way of thought style is ill suited for
some specific situations and thus is perceived as being dysfunctional.

Of course the premise critically depends upon being able to appreciate
a &quot;successful application of the schizophrenic style of thinking&quot;

At a heuristic level, it quite easy to recognize autism, ADHD, OCD,
and BiPD as successful strategies.

Given that these &quot;thinking styles&quot; are fully described as per how they
are 'perceived to be' whilst performing in a manner of ...

... null
... nonfunctional
... dysfunctional
... pathological

...  It is not easy to imagine how they might be described when they
are functional!

Schizophrenia is all the more challenging in this regard. ...
... and by way of parallel process, indicative that schizophrenia
might truly be a 'covertly' functional phenotype.

What's the matter Desertphile?

The OP provided a broad synthesis concerning the 'origin and
development of thought processes'.

..   Maybe it's time for a siesta.
