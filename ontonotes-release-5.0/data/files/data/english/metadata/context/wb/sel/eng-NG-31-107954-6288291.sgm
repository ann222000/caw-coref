I've seen videos of bicycle messengers doing rear-tire skids, but they
were always balancing delicately, going straight, and not wearing long
robes and sandals:

Dear Phil,

Aaargh!

You're right. The /fs on the bad link seems to be a goof, possibly for
full-size. This seems to work:

I suppose this picture is as mystifying to observers as the
penny-farthing downhill where the tire flew off and the guy crashed.

This video is not a motorcycle and no person I can imagine can spin a
rear wheel as this rider does without a lubricant.  If you watch
carefully you will notice that the road appears frosty and that the
rear wheel is throwing the icy debris around.  That isn't white rubber
smoke as with a motorcycle.  This would not be possible on solid ice
nor merely a wet road.  I doubt this could even be done on smooth
concrete strewn with sand although that might work.

It takes just enough traction to be able to ride, yet slippery enough
that when leaned forward, the wheel can be made to spin.  I wonder how
often this condition arises so that someone can make a video of it.

It is conceivable but not likely that some types of tarmac topped with
simple water (the spray in the video) would be that slippery. Oily
tarmac
with water could easily be that slippery. Notice that the rider
is leaning forward to take weight off the rear wheel.

The surface is really secondary to the infotainment value of
the kid's skill on the bike. That's a pretty sweeeet move for a kid
in Dubai (?), not an easy one either. Not the most elegant-looking
thing, unlikely to cause widespread swooning among Dubai's
teenyboppers in its current form, but impressive.

It's just water.

It works, as you mostly got right, only because of the extreme weight
transfer forward (greatly unloading the rear wheel) and the fact that
the front wheel still gets enough grip on the asphalt surface to
prevent forward motion from taking over.  On smooth concrete, this
wouldn't work.  With a bike that had a much longer top tube, the rider
probably couldn't lean far enough forward to make the rear wheel load
light enough to come close to losing traction.  The trick is to stay
just short of falling over forwards.

Long ago, when I was a lot lighter and younger, I performed a similar
stunt in the faculty parking lot of my junior high after a sudden,
intense rain shower; that's how I know that it can work.  I don't
think I'd be willing to try it now, even for serious money.

Looks like sand to me. Supposedly the sand in the middle east is much
finer than the stuff we're used to, I'd imagine that a thin layer of it

As I mentioned, this appears to be common tat-mac on which fine powder
would not offer such a uniformly poor traction.  The fineness of what
is being blown off by the tire is such that it remains airborne longer
than even talcum powder, which it is not.

I think this needs to be studied more carefully to make sense.  In any
event, it is a great clip.

Dear Jobst,

Werehatrack stated that he was younger and lighter and riding around
in his junior-high school's faculty parking lot.

Parking lots are often flat, badly oil-stained, and much slipperier
after a downpour than steep California side-streets--not much water
stays on a ~30% grade.

The parking lot was certainly much flatter than Filbert, so
Werehatrack could lean forward much more effectively than you could
lean on a steep hill, thus putting less weight on his rear tire.

You've often mentioned how you have to lean forward just to keep the
front wheel from coming up on steep climbs, haven't you? Obviously
you're nowhere near as far of true forward on your climbs as the kid
sliding around in the video.

In junior high, Werehatrack was probably considerably lighter than
your ~180 pounds, putting even less weight on his rear tire.

So I believe him quite easily.

Incidentally, if someone had written the same sort of skeptical reply
to one of your posts, wouldn't you be demanding to know whether they
were calling you a liar?

Cheers,

Carl Fogel

Yes, looks like fine blowing sand across a smooth surface.

On our New Year's Ride of 2005 we stopped at Wiggie's Bar for a shot and
started the return trip in a freezing sleet. The parking lot was glazed
and I was able to do much the same, after some encouragement by younger
riders, in just that way - by leaning over the bars to purposely unload
the rear wheel.

Yes, I agree you can sense and avoid 'too far' in the case of a wet hill
climb and sense how far is 'just enough' in special conditions* when you
_desire_ wheel slip.

[*] by "special conditions" I mean, for me, literally once in a lifetime.

I can't imagine what moves you to interpret that story, You weren't

wet pavement.  The rougher the pavement the less effect the water has.

I suggest you try that, even for two pedal strokes before proposing
that one can do this.  Review the video and see where you can see

That's a part of his method but it does not work on wet or dry

That makes no difference.  Watch the smooth continuous sliding in the

I think if you were to try some of these stunts, you would see how
unbelievable they appear.  The evidence in the video does not support
the wet pavement scenario.  If you think so, please explain why.

I would expect that if I were to make such claims someone might say
so.  If you are concerned about my climbing steep streets I have only
a photo of riding up Filbert St. in sunny weather.  We had no camera

First I would need to find that color print.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; even be done on smooth concrete strewn with sand although that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; might work.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It takes just enough traction to be able to ride, yet slippery
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enough that when leaned forward, the wheel can be made to spin.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wonder how often this condition arises so that someone can make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a video of it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's just water.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It works, as you mostly got right, only because of the extreme
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weight transfer forward (greatly unloading the rear wheel) and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fact that the front wheel still gets enough grip on the asphalt
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; surface to prevent forward motion from taking over.  On smooth
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; concrete, this wouldn't work.  With a bike that had a much longer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; top tube, the rider probably couldn't lean far enough forward to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make the rear wheel load light enough to come close to losing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; traction.  The trick is to stay just short of falling over
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; forwards.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is not water!  There is no wetness on the bicycle, the rider
&gt;&gt;&gt; or spray coming off the tire as we know well from the stripe up
&gt;&gt;&gt; ones back without mud guard.  As I mentioned, the faint white dust
&gt;&gt;&gt; hovering over the road (which seems to be conventionally rough
&gt;&gt;&gt; tar-mac) is not water not white rubber smoke usually accompanying
&gt;&gt;&gt; motor vehicle &quot;donuts&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Long ago, when I was a lot lighter and younger, I performed a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; similar stunt in the faculty parking lot of my junior high after a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sudden, intense rain shower; that's how I know that it can work.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think I'd be willing to try it now, even for serious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; money.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh pshaw!  That is to much to believe without pictorial evidence
&gt;&gt;&gt; considering I've climbed steep streets (SF Filbert St. 31.5%
&gt;&gt;&gt; grade), leaning forward, in the rain, obviously without wheelspin.

&gt; http://tinyurl.com/2dywjd

&gt;&gt; Werehatrack stated that he was younger and lighter and riding around
&gt;&gt; in his junior-high school's faculty parking lot.

&gt;&gt; Parking lots are often flat, badly oil-stained, and much slipperier
&gt;&gt; after a downpour than steep California side-streets--not much water
&gt;&gt; stays on a ~30% grade.

&gt; I can't imagine what moves you to interpret that story, You weren't
&gt; there and he likened his feat to that in the video that he claims is
&gt; wet pavement.  The rougher the pavement the less effect the water has.
&gt; The whole description begs for disbelief.  Why don't you let him fill

&gt;&gt; The parking lot was certainly much flatter than Filbert, so
&gt;&gt; Werehatrack could lean forward much more effectively than you could
&gt;&gt; lean on a steep hill, thus putting less weight on his rear tire.

&gt; I suggest you try that, even for two pedal strokes before proposing
&gt; that one can do this.  Review the video and see where you can see
&gt; signs of water.  The way you go at this is reminiscent of my favorite
&gt; former metallurgist.

&gt;&gt; You've often mentioned how you have to lean forward just to keep the

Dear Phil,

Should be interesting. As I recall, you're significantly lighter and
younger than posters like Jobst, Werehatrack, and me.

In Florida, you'll have to try bleach on the rear tire or find a lot
of oily, water-covered asphalt, frost being scarce in your neck of the
woods.

I assume that you'll wear beach sandals instead of using clipless
pedals. :)

IMO the "bleach burnout" thing is misunderstood by many.

In the early days of drag racing bleach burnouts were used to clean,
warm and soften the tire to improve traction. These days with better
tires a "water box" is used primarily to clean the tire off and the
burnout to heat the tire takes place forward of the water box.

Light oil, soapy water, shuffle board wax or dance wax on the surface
might be a better starting point to reduce traction for a bicycle with
its low horsepower engine.

For added potential fun try a Google image search for "fire burnout".  A
bicycling video by the pre-Darwin Award folk might be in order ;-)

Please, no extra homework.  If you have a link, please list it.

The mechanism cannot be an oily or icy surface but rather one that has
reduced traction.  Otherwise it's an instant flop as would occur on a
frozen lake for instance.  This requires reduced traction as a frosty
surface could give, the tips of the asphalt pavement protruding to
give points of consistent traction.

At the end of the video, the rider is on the saddle and sliding
sideways, needing to put his foot down to stay upright.  That is not
because there is no weight on the wheels that are fully loaded.
Leaning forward was necessary to make sure the front wheel had better
traction than the rear.

I've known the street become extremely slippery and greasy like that in
London. The particular stretch I'm thinking of is along Richmond High
Street where the tarmac is very smooth and worn, and there are buses
passing all the time. When it rains after a long dry spell the water
and the diesel on the road form a slippery emulsion. A couple of times
I've ridden along there wondering if my rear tyre has gone flat because
the wheel was sliding out from under me, and the wheel would certainly
spin under when moving off from a standstill. I'm sure the stunt in the
video could have been performed on such a surface. It looks to me as
though there is water on the road. Not a deep puddle, but a fresh film
after a heavy rain fall. If the road had been dry for a long time and a
layer of oil had built up, a brief but heavy shower could well have
produced the sort of surface required.

&gt; &gt; Looks like sand to me.  Supposedly the sand in the middle east is
&gt; &gt; much finer than the stuff we're used to, I'd imagine that a thin
&gt; &gt; layer of it might provide the right amount of traction.

&gt; As I mentioned, this appears to be common tat-mac on which fine powder
&gt; would not offer such a uniformly poor traction.  The fineness of what
&gt; is being blown off by the tire is such that it remains airborne longer
&gt; than even talcum powder, which it is not.

&gt; I think this needs to be studied more carefully to make sense.  In any
&gt; event, it is a great clip.

The sand in the Dubai is very fine indeed. It really is
more like talc.

Dear Dave,

Several posters have suggested water, which might work. Ice or frost
are also faint possibilities.

But I can't make out any stains on the back of his white robe.

Of course, the video quality is too low to make out details.

But still I'd expect to see a mess on the white robe if water (or ice
or frost) were being spun up in all those frantic sliding, low-speed,
wheel-spinning circles.

I do see something white thrown up by the rear tire. And I see whitish
streaks on the road. But it doesn't seem to carry around, as water,
ice, or frost would be carried by a wet tire.

So I'm leaning toward bleach or some other stuff that can be easily
added and easily practiced on.

The trouble with ice or frost is that it's likely to be so rare that
practice time would be severely limited. And I expect that it would
leave a mess.

A water-covered road is much easier to find for practice, but the
water ought to leave a large, dirty stain on the white robe.

Bleach (or something like it) on a rear tire (or on the pavement)
might produce the white "smoke" and the white smears, and it would be
easy to use for practice.

(Fine sand has been suggested, which might puff up like the white
"smoke," but I can't see how the sand would leave the white smears on
the road.)

Maybe that wild cartoon-like trick is easier than it seems, but that
fellow looks as if he practiced his stunt until he was ready to take
it on the road in front of a camera. He only puts his foot down once,
at the very end.

It's a bit like magic tricks. I always guess wrong when I try to
figure them out--which never surprises magicians. It won't startle me
if we eventually learn that the stunt involves neither frost, ice,
water, bleach, sand, or any other suggestion made so far.

Cheers,

Carl Fogel

&gt; wheel-spinning circles.

&gt; I do see something white thrown up by the rear tire. And I see whitish
&gt; streaks on the road. But it doesn't seem to carry around, as water,
&gt; ice, or frost would be carried by a wet tire.

&gt; So I'm leaning toward bleach or some other stuff that can be easily
&gt; added and easily practiced on.

&gt; The trouble with ice or frost is that it's likely to be so rare that
&gt; practice time would be severely limited. And I expect that it would
&gt; leave a mess.

&gt; A water-covered road is much easier to find for practice, but the
&gt; water ought to leave a large, dirty stain on the white robe.

&gt; Bleach (or something like it) on a rear tire (or on the pavement)
&gt; might produce the white &quot;smoke&quot; and the white smears, and it would be
&gt; easy to use for practice.

&gt; (Fine sand has been suggested, which might puff up like the white
&gt; &quot;smoke,&quot; but I can't see how the sand would leave the white smears on
&gt; the road.)

I think it might be sand b/c of this:
Assuming the sand is uniformly distributed on the asphalt that we see,
it's kicked up and moved to a different spot where there is already
sand.  So the streaks are not just sand, but more and enough sand to
finally be seen on camera.

Dear Paul,

Nice point.

When I looked at the video again, I still can't make things out for
sure, but the "smear" may be to the outside of the spinning tire,
which is consistent with sand.

And fine sand is more likely than water, frost, ice, or bleach.

There are large areas in the Mid-East and North Africa where the sand
is so plentiful and incredibly fine that it gets in anything that
isn't vacuum-sealed.

Whatever the explanation is, the fellow on the bike would probably be
laughing himself at our varied explanations.

Cheers,

Carl Fogel

I didn't see any sand in the original video, only fine white dust
that, as I suggested, was possibly frost from the road that seemed to
be striped asphalt pavement, not smooth concrete that would enable
such a stunt.

Given the location sand does seem rather more likely :-)

Today it snowed and while I was moving some of my bikes from one shed
to another, I decided to have a go at this burning rubber business.
After making certain there was no one watching as I was sure it would
result in an embarassing fall, I lay down on my bull-horns like Graham
Obree on my 48x18 fixed and started pedalling on my snow dusted lawn. I
didn't get very far, but lots of wheelspin! My attempt was by no means
anywhere near the results from the kid in the video, but I am confident
that with practice, snow dusted grass would be a suitable surface to do
this trick. The moral of the story is that I think there are many
different surfaces that this can be done on.
