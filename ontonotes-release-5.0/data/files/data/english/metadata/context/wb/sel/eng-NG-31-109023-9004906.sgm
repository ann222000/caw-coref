Strange as it may seem, the zionazis were the original nazis and the
holocaust they committed against the Armenians may be what they got in
return.

The zionazi Jewish ADL tells us that there was no Armenian Holocaust,
maybe there was no Armenian or Jewish Holocaust, and we are just
writing about things that never happened. At least that is what the
zionazi Jewish ADL is telling us.

What goes around comes around.

According to Turkey, a &quot;zionazi&quot; is someone who hates Palestinians. I
don't hate Palestinians. Therefore, by his definition, I am not a

Palestinians -- or Israelis?

Only if you're too stupid to read. The day the story came out, I posted
here that I thought Foxman was absolutely wrong. Foxman is NOT the ADL,
he is only one person in it. Many other people in the ADL disagreed with
him, including the person he fired for expressing their opinion.

Labels are important on these lists and we know how quick some people

for intimidating those some people disagree with but I had no idea how
sensitive these same people can get when they are labeled, just as
they label others.

There is no way to stop people from using labels so it is best to put
enough labels on the table to satisfy everyone. One or more of these
labels fits everyone who posts to these lists and they should not be
shy about picking the labels best suits them. If all else fails, I
will pick one for the shy folks.

Please pick the label most appropriate for you:

Are you a nazi?
Are you a zionazi?
Are you an antisemite?
Are you a denier?
Are you a revisionist?
Are you a vegenazi?
Are you a holohustler?

serves at the pleasure of the board. He also doesn't have the
authority of Bush to set policy. So Sara is not writhing, but you are
making one of your simplistic arguments.

Of course Sara said no such thing. She made a quite rational comment,
that Foxman was not the ADL. From there you tried to analogize to the
powers of a US President and have now claimed her comment is identical
to saying Foxman was no more prominent that Bruno. I'm afraid if you
strain much harder you'll risk a hernia.

He has the power unless overruled by the Board. He re-hired him.

Are you a nazi?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Only if you're too stupid to read.

&gt; &gt; So you're NOT repudiating the ADL then?

&gt; Why should she, Waldope?

I asked Sara a question, Philthy - requested clarification on her
repeated obfuscation. I did not say whether she (as a Jew) should or
should not repudiate the ADL.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt; The day the story came out, I posted
&gt; &gt;&gt; here that I thought Foxman was absolutely wrong.

&gt; &gt; Surely you don't expect me to read EVERYTHING that is posted in this
&gt; &gt; NG, do you?

&gt; &gt; So you ARE repudiating the ADL's position on the Armenian Holocaust?
&gt; &gt; Right?

&gt; You mean the Aremenian genocide. The Holocaust is a specific
&gt; historical event.
">

Do I sense a bit of jealousy here, Philthy? A fear that others might
use the term &quot;Holocaust&quot; to describe events *other* that those
described in the Shoah Dogma?  That would be a shame, especially
considering the amount of time, energy and money that your Jewish pals
have invested in their propaganda campaign to have the public mind
associate that word *solely* with the 'Jewish experience' during WWII.

But no, Philthy, I mean the Armenian HOLOCAUST, an event which was
*referred to as a &quot;holocaust&quot;* some two decades prior to the time when
the events that are commonly called &quot;The Holocaust&quot; (German/Jewish)
commenced. (Not to mention the fact that Jews/crypto Jews had a strong
hand in initiating and executing the Armenian Holocaust, didn't they
Philthy?)

Once again we see Jews projecting, and  jealously guarding as their
&quot;private property&quot; that which they have perniciously purloined from
others.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; If so, good for you. The ADL's stance was not only wrong - but the
&gt; &gt; PUBLICITY it received made it BAD FOR JEWS.

&gt; Why is that Waldope?
">

Because it would be unseemly for Jews (who regularly leave their wigs,
toupees and yarmulkas stuck to the ceiling any time someone hints that
they *might* be questioning one jot or tittle of the Official Dogma of
THEIR 'holocaust') to casually run around denying the genocides
suffered by others.  It exposes them as being the self-centered,
ethnocentric hypocrites that they are.

THAT, Philthy, is why Foxman caught hell, and THAT, Philthy, is why he
and the ADL adjusted their &quot;official position&quot; on the matter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt; Foxman is NOT the ADL, he is only one person in it.
&gt; &gt; You're writhing, Sara. Foxman is the president and chief spokesman
&gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt; the ADL - much as Bush is the president and chief spokesman for the
&gt; &gt; USA.

&gt; Except that Bush is elected by the voters.

There are those that would argue otherwise - especially in the case of
w. (note the lower case).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Not just ANY board, but the board of the ADL, who appointed him as
their president and chief spokesman, didn't they?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He also doesn't have the
&gt; authority of Bush to set policy.

In that case we must assume that the policy of denying the Armenian
Holocaust was NOT that of Foxman, but that of the ADL, as I said from
the outset.

Thank you for making my case, Philthy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So Sara is not writhing, but you are

Too little too late. The hypocritical hippo is out of the sack - and
the ADL is exposed for what they are. The only bright spot for Abe and
his Apes is that the story was pretty much quashed, and didn't receive
much media attention. (Just imagine the feeding frenzy of the
Paparazzi Piranha had the likes of Mel Gibson said something similar
about the JEWISH Holocaust!)

Anyway, thanks for the hand, Philthy!

Nazi Israel even more for destroying the fledging democracy in Lebanon

I am talking about collective punishment and making a valid parallel
between Nazi Germany and Nazi Israel. One needs to condemn the German
Nazis for wiping out an entire village in retaliation for the
partisans' ambush killing of their soldiers but one needs to condemn
Nazi Israel even more for destroying the fledging democracy in Lebanon
and making 1-1/2 million people homeless for Hezbollah capturing two
of their soldiers. Ask yourself which one is worse; something that was
done 60+ years ago or something that was done just a few months ago?
Nothing I said, would an honest person interpret for blaming the
innocents for the actions of others but it is an undeniable fact, a
very sad fact that innocents always pay for the criminal conduct of
others.

Again you didn't answer: third time. Most sensible people understand
that if you don't answer by the third time, you never will.

Which means that you're fundamentally immature and dishonest.

Nevertheless, I feel compelled to allow you another opportunity to

You are correct. I made a mistake. You are correct about Cohen also

are not Jewish but try to act more Jewish than any Jew. A sorry lot
for sure. I put some names up there. Your input about them would be

You do not debate, zionazi DuffyMonkeyBoy. You cut and paste and you
deserve the same.

Why should anyone answer any zionazi questions?

As soon as you answer a zionazi's question, the zionazi comes back
asking the same question you just answered. It seems that zionazis can
do that repeatedly until anyone gullible enough to have tried to
answer a zionazi's question is exhausted.

After you get tired of going around in circles with the zionazi asking
the same question repeatedly and ignoring your responses, the zionazi
will declare victory.

That is the zionazi way.

Did anyone notice that zionazis only ask questions but never answer
them?

Have a nice zionazi day!

&gt; &gt; &gt; So you're NOT repudiating the ADL then?

&gt; &gt; Why should she, Waldope?

&gt; &gt; You mean the Aremenian genocide. The Holocaust is a specific
&gt; &gt; historical event.

&gt; Do I sense a bit of jealousy here, Philthy?

WWII, poor fool.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;That would be a shame, especially

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That may be what you mean, but you might as well be saying the German

The Holocaust refers to an historical event, and not all the Jew

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Actually stupid, it's you and I discussing it. Jews have nothing to do
your jealousy of a term for an historical event. But of course Jews
seem to dominate your pathetic life, at least when you're down in the
basement.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; If so, good for you. The ADL's stance was not only wrong - but the
&gt; &gt; &gt; PUBLICITY it received made it BAD FOR JEWS.

&gt; &gt; Why is that Waldope?

&gt; Because it would be unseemly for Jews (who regularly leave their wigs,
&gt; toupees and yarmulkas stuck to the ceiling any time someone hints that
&gt; they *might* be questioning one jot or tittle of the Official Dogma of
&gt; THEIR 'holocaust') to casually run around denying the genocides
&gt; suffered by others.  It exposes them as being the self-centered,
&gt; ethnocentric hypocrites that they are.
">

Ah, so what you claim was bad for the Jews is really just you
projecting your antisemitic nonsense onto the situation. Perhaps you
actually believe that normal episodes of policy such as this would
create in the land the same kind of unthinking, screw loose hatred you
and the Nazis are known for.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; THAT, Philthy, is why Foxman caught hell, and THAT, Philthy, is why he
&gt; and the ADL adjusted their &quot;official position&quot; on the matter.
">

No, poor little conspiracy nut, Foxman caught hell because lots of
people, Jews and non Jews, gave him hell. He was wrong.

But thanks for demonstrating that in your world the actions of one man
should somehow show the masses that an entire group of people are
indeed what your petty prejudices hold them to be. A perfect example
of the misfiring of a bigot's mind.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Foxman is NOT the ADL, he is only one person in it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; You're writhing, Sara. Foxman is the president and chief spokesman
&gt; &gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the ADL - much as Bush is the president and chief spokesman for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; USA.

&gt; &gt; Except that Bush is elected by the voters.

&gt; There are those that would argue otherwise - especially in the case of
&gt; w. (note the lower case).

There are always &quot;those&quot;, Waldope. You're a charter member.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Foxman is an appointee and
&gt; &gt; serves at the pleasure of the board.

&gt; Not just ANY board, but the board of the ADL, who appointed him as
&gt; their president and chief spokesman, didn't they?
">

So you accept that your comparison was ridiculous.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; He also doesn't have the
&gt; &gt; authority of Bush to set policy.

&gt; In that case we must assume that the policy of denying the Armenian
&gt; Holocaust was NOT that of Foxman, but that of the ADL, as I said from
&gt; the outset.
">

Which means you are probably doing nothing more than uttering whatever
comes into your head. Occasionally some of it may be right, especially
when you declare on both sides of a position. Having made an ass of
yourself leading up to this, it's probably time for you to declare
some form of victory.

You're quite the fool Waldope.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Joe Bruno&quot; (another ADL boy) is a pathetic attempt at misdirection
&gt; &gt; &gt; and a pitiful excuse.

&gt; &gt; Of course Sara said no such thing. She made a quite rational comment,
&gt; &gt; that Foxman was not the ADL.

&gt; And you helped her out by explaining that the ADL board sets the
&gt; policy, and that Foxman is merely a figurehead and spokesman - ergo,
&gt; Foxman speaks for the ADL board. Good job.

I am talking about collective punishment and making a valid parallel
between Nazi Germany and Nazi Israel. One needs to condemn the German
Nazis for wiping out an entire village in retaliation for the
partisans' ambush killing of their soldiers but one needs to condemn
Nazi Israel even more for destroying the fledging democracy in Lebanon
and making 1-1/2 million people homeless for Hezbollah capturing two
of their soldiers. Ask yourself which one is worse; something that was
done 60+ years ago or something that was done just a few months ago?
Nothing I said, would an honest person interpret for blaming the
innocents for the actions of others but it is an undeniable fact, a
very sad fact that innocents always pay for the criminal conduct of
others.

STALIN'S JEWS - Opinion from Israel, Ynetnews

http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0%2C7340%2CL-3342999%2C00.html

12-21-6  Excerpts only...

&quot;We mustn't forget that some of greatest murderers of modern times
were Jewish.

We cannot know with certainty the number of deaths Cheka was
responsible for in its various manifestations, but the number is
surely at least 20 million, including victims of the forced
collectivization, the hunger, large purges, expulsions, banishments,
executions, and mass death at Gulags.

Whole population strata were eliminated: Independent farmers, ethnic
minorities, members of the bourgeoisie, senior officers,
intellectuals, artists, labor movement activists, &quot;opposition members&quot;
who were defined completely randomly, and countless members of the
Communist party itself.

And us, the Jews? An Israeli student finishes high school without ever
hearing the name &quot;Genrikh Yagoda,&quot; the greatest Jewish murderer of the
20th Century, the GPU's deputy commander and the founder and commander
of the NKVD. Yagoda diligently implemented Stalin's collectivization
orders and is responsible for the deaths of at least 10 million
people. His Jewish deputies established and managed the Gulag system.
After Stalin no longer viewed him favorably, Yagoda was demoted and
executed, and was replaced as chief hangman in 1936 by Yezhov, the
'bloodthirsty dwarf'.&quot;

The article is significant because it appeared on a Jewish site and
the author is Jewish. If you look up the site, you will see that the
site and the author are attacked for being candid and truthful.

I am not about to let the likes of McVay, a paid purveyor of Zionazi
hate propaganda, get away with the portrayal of Jews as always the
victims and never the perpetrators because it is not true. Just as
there is an ugly side to the German and other Nazis, there is an ugly
side to Jewish and other Communists. A balanced discussion considers
all.

On alt.revisionism, we are dealings with mostly Zionazis and we should
not forget that most Jews are not like them. The author of this
article appears to be a man of conscience who wants to cope with the
ugly side of Jewish history. He will pay dearly for his candor because
the Zionazis will make sure of it. Many Jews of conscience have
irritated the Zionazis and the Zionazis list these people on their
hate site.

http://www.masada2000.org/list-A.html

This an ugly Zionazi hate site used to attack decent Jews. In spite of
my revulsion with this Zionazi hate site it gives me hope to see that
there are so many decent Jews that these Zionazis hate. Maybe there is
a way for all decent people to look at history not as a weapon against
others but as a learning experience for the future.

Have a nice vegetarian day!

&gt;&gt; &gt; Jewish Communists and Nazi Israel.

&gt;&gt; Nothing finally about it, stupid, and there is nothing about Israel
&gt;&gt; that has anything to do with Nazism you uneducated moron.

&gt; Now, that you have admitted to the horrible crimes of Stalin's
&gt; Jewish
&gt; Communists
">

Admitted no such thing, stupid. And the crimes were committed by the
Communists, who were overwhelmingly Gentile. I guess Gentiles are
evil, eh stupid!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;and Nazi Israel, what are you going to do?
">

In fact, I disputed your claim.

Are you really this much of a moron?
