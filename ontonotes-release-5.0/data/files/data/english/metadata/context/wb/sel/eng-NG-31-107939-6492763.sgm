Just purchased my first plane and have it tied down.  It has a canopy cover
but no wing covers.  Walking around the airport I only notice one other
plane with wing covers.   I would have thought wing covers would be good
protection.  During the wnter the rentals would have them to prevent frost
but I didn't take notice of the others. Now that I have to worry about this
what's the story on the pro/cons of wing covers ?

I suspect the main problem is cost.  I have a full set of Kennon
cabin, cowl, wing, and elevator covers for mine, and before I found a
reasonable hangar used the covers year-round.  I can see the
difference on the finish between covered and uncovered areas.  I still
use the wing covers in the hangar since the roof leaks.

Pros
1.  In winter, keeps the surfaces ice free.
2.  Protects from dirt and UV - paint holds up much better.
3.  Keeps rain out of the tanks and interior.
4.  Tail cover keeps birds out of the tail cone, cowl cover keeps
them out of the engine.

Cons
a.  Additional capital cost
b.  Time to uncover/recover.  Putting covers on can be a pain when
it's windy, though you can develop techniques to help.

My overall opinion is that the covers are an excellent way to protect
your investment.  Don't use nylon, though; go with the canvas covers,
as they breathe better after it rains.

Are your wings metal or fabric? Wing covers are almost a requirement
for fabric planes that live outside because the sun eats the fabric.
