The Oxford Shakespeare: Poems. 1914.

Sonnet CLIV.

THE LITTLE Love-god lying once asleep
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
The fairest votary took up that fire 5
Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
And so the general of hot desire
Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm'd.
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual, 10
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
For men diseas'd; but I, my mistress' thrall,
Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.

1609 Quarto, old-fashioned spellilng.

THe little Loue-God lying once a sleepe,

&lt;&lt;In 1623 Ben Jonson's personal library was

--------------------------------------------------------------
HOG HANG'D alludes to the story Francis Bacon
told in his APOPHTHEGMS about Sir Nicholas Bacon:

&quot;Sir Nicholas Bacon being appointed a judge for the northern circuit,
&amp; having brought his trials that came before him to such a pass, as the
passing of sentence on malefactors, he was by one of the malefactors
mightily importuned for to save his life; which, when nothing that
he had said did avail, he at length desired his mercy on account
of kindred.`Prithee,' said my lord judge, `how came that in?'

`Why, if it please you, my lord, your name is Bacon,
and mine is Hog, and in all ages Hog and Bacon have been
so near kindred, that they are not to be separated.'

`Ay, but,' replied judge Bacon, `you and I cannot be kindred,
except you be hanged; for Hog is not Bacon until it be well hanged.&quot;
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Merry Wives of Windsor Act 4, Scene 1

MISTRESS QUICKLY 'Hang-hog' is Latin for BACON, I warrant you.
----------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Quickly. Hang-hog, is latten for Bacon, I warrant you.
- Shakespeare (Folio only), Merry Wives, iv, 1.

The whole of Mistress Quickly's sentence
is a remarkable example of punning,
the Latin for 'to hang', for instance, being SUSpendere.

&quot;SUS&quot; is the Latin for a sow, pig, swine or hog,

and pendere means to hang down. 'Warrant' can be rendered in Latin
as auctor, a word which is often used by Bacon to denote an inventor
or author. Even Mistress Quickly's name is important in this context,
for 'quickly' is cito in Latin, and cito also means to summon,
call forward or name, especially in a court of law,
or to call upon a god for help.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------------------
&quot;BACON&quot; SVS &quot;NIL VERO VERIUS&quot;
&quot;OBSCURIS VERA INVOLVENS&quot;
-----------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;Inscribed on Athena's shield is a Latin motto,

&quot;OBSCURIS VERA INVOLVENS&quot;,

meaning 'TRUTH is enveloped in obscurity', which explains
the imagery on the shield-the central sun representing TRUTH
and the surrounding clouds obscurity.&gt;&gt;

---------------------------------------------------------------
VERA NIHIL VERIVS
---------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Oxford was accompanied on his journey to Italy, including Venice, by the
Englishman Nathaniel Baxter, who recalled the event in a publication he
entitled Sidneys Ourania, printed in 1606 (STC 1598), two years after
Oxford's death. Although the publication is dedicated to Philip Sidney's
sister Mary, countess of Pembroke, a poem within the volume (on sig. A3v) is
dedicated to Oxford's daughter Susan Vere, and assigns her conception to
Oxford's miraculous rescue from &quot;infamie&quot; (here, Oxford is the &quot;Prince&quot; and
also the &quot;Albanian dignitie&quot; - or British nobleman). The first three
stanzas, which are an acrostic on the de Vere motto (&quot;mot&quot; or posy), are as
follows:

To the Right Noble, and Honorable Lady Susan Vera Mongomriana.

V Aliant whilome the Prince that bare this Mot,
E Ngraued round about his golden Ring:
R Oaming in VENICE ere thou wast begot,
A Mong the Gallants of th'Italian spring.

Cupid's torch can heat up water, but water
can't put out the fire of love. /

By quatrains - roughly, but the quatrain boundaries are deliberately
overridden, as Shakespeare only occasionally does.
(1) Cupid lay asleep, with his torch beside him, while a crowd of
nymphs came past. (2) The prettiest of them stole his torch (3) and
quenched it in a nearby spring, turning it into a hot spa. (c) But
when I went there, I found water is not a cure for love.

It is a little hard to say what is the difference between this poem
and the one before, except perhaps that the one before is better!

The first two lines of 153 become the first eight of 154. Instead of
one nymph, there is now a swarm of them, one of whom is specially
singled out at this greater length. To me, this suggests a visit to
Bath by the queen and her court. (I do not know if, or when, such a
visit took place.)

She was regularly likened to Diana or a leading nymph, and her court
to Diana's nymphs and shepherds. For example, the 1603 song-book
produced in her honour, The Triumphs of Oriana, was made up of
contributions invited from all the leading madrigal composers of the
day, subject to the rule that every stanza must end with the two
lines:
&quot;Then sang the shepherds and nymphs of Diana
Long live fair Oriana!&quot;
(Incidentally, not Orry-Arner, but Or-eye-Anna to rhyme with Diana.)

There is no suggestion that the nymph is the same person as the
mistress, any more than there was in 153. So the way is open for this
leading nymph to be the queen. Might this poem have been written for
the use of some courtier?

If it is about the queen, that may be the reason for putting it in
such a significant position, the very last of the Sonnets. I feel the
need for some explanation.

The various erotic meanings editors see in different words do not seem
to hang together in such a way as to make sense, or provide any
enlightenment. I do not understand Katherine Duncan-Jones's suggestion
that the word FINIS is a reference to the Miraculous Draught of Fishes
(153 of them, John 21.11). Is it just because the letters F, I and S
are in the word FINIS and also in the word FISH?

Interesting you say three years. I remember continuing from
where someone else had to stop, then returning to the
beginning, now coming to the end.

Yes, I have taken my turn and think someone else may decide
to do the sonnets; or, if the recipe is tired, perhaps you
let it rest for a while until some yeast perks it up again.
We'll see what happens.

I do think it would be nice for HLAS if some kind of
discussion take place to get input before it takes off
again.

Yes, many thanks! Saving the life of the sonnet series is a thing many
of us must appreciate; this one more than most.

The series as a whole is now nearly six years old, of course, or
rather, 308 weeks. It was started by Julia of Mistylaw, who last
posted in August 2001. The first time we got to 154 she turned us
round and got us going again at number 1 the very next week - it
seemed a bit drastic at the time, but maybe it was good for us. I know
no news of her.

I said three years because 52 * 3 ~= 154. However, you say it might
have been even longer. I think that you should probably leave it, for
a few months perhaps, then start again at Sonnet 1.
