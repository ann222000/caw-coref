Hello All

Well, I am on a rant today, let me tell you.  A former student of mine, whom
I think very highly of, is at home this evening caring for his mother who
had a complete left breast mastectomy today.  That is not even half of what
irritates me.  She arrived at the hospital at 6:00 am and was discharged at
12:30 pm.  6 1/2 HOURS LATER!!!!!!!!!!   What are insurance companies and
Doctors thinking?  Obviously not about the patient.  Is this the norm?
Please tell me it isn't.  I did find this link for a petition to back a bill
before congress.

http://www.lifetimetv.com/breastcancer/petition/signpetition.php

I have went to it and so has Bert.  I am sure that most of you have already
been to such a site already.  I am simply outraged over this.  I'll probably
email my three congressional delegates but doubt if anything will come of
it.  All three are under investigation for corruption.

Thanks for letting me vent.

That is totally appalling, Steve.
I have never heard of such a terrible neglect of a patient.  Though
there are two friends of mine on this group who had similar extremely
short hospital stays - though not within one day, and not after the same
operation, but they were both major operations.
I do hope your friend's mother does OK.

Hey Steve:

Well the time for cancer patients stays are getting even shorter than
the past few years.

In 1994 a patient's stay was 6 days, 2002 the stay was about 22 hours
then  the patient would be dumped in a wheelchair out in the hot sun
to wait for a bus.

Your friend's mother was treated as an outpatient and that is a real
shame.  The price for a nurse to come to the home of the patient will
be the same as a physician.  It truely is a sad day when an insurance
companies runs the surgical suite and not the doctors.

I will gladly sign your petition.

Well, when signing the petition, I entered a few comments. Here's what I had
to say.

I just read an email from a friend who has a friend at home taking care of
his mom who was discharged 6.5 HOURS after her complete left mastectomy, I
work in veterinary medicine and our patients are hospitalized until proper
care can be taken of them at home. Having a large chunk of flesh with a not
inconsiderable amount of emotional involvement attached removed should merit
more than a few paltry hours in a hospital. It's not a mole or wart to be
excised; a breast is wrapped up in a woman's view of herself. And the area
of the surgery is highly mobile and very painful post-operatively and tends
to accumulate fluid, all things that should be managed by health care
professionals. No lay family member, not matter how well-intentioned and
caring, is equipped for the aftercare required. Sad that we treat our pets
with more consideration and dignity than we do our own wives, sisters and
mothers.

Steve, my heart goes out to you and your friend's family (and the
millions of others who are suffering or affected by breast cancer). I'm
praying for you all! :(

I have no idea if this is the norm ... but I'm going to find out - at
least for my home state (not sure how to check for another). To think
that it might be the norm is disgusting and appalling.  It's just one
more case of &quot;conveyor belt&quot; healthcare. For YEARS women's healthcare
has been steadily going this route. :(

Not the same thing, but I remember a few years ago when I had my son, a
woman I'd met was being sent home after the customary TWO days in the
hospital following giving birth. Her doctor didn't want her to leave -
she was hemorrhaging VERY badly. The poor woman could barely stand up
(not that standing up after giving birth is an easy proposition). But
her insurance refused to cover additional stay and she couldn't afford
the $$ to stay past her coverage.

Meanwhile, my son and I ended up staying for over a week - turns out
that we were exposed to chickenpox and had to be quarantined (but only
I ended up with CP - and even then, it was AFTER the hospital stay).
Once it became an issue other than woman's health our insurance had no
qualms paying for it. So apparently, a childhood illness rates higher
on the &quot;need&quot; scale for insurance companies than dangerous post-natal
complications.

But still, I can't imagine sending home a woman who's just had a breast
removed - ESPECIALLY if she were advanced in years. AFAIK, that would
leave more complications open and require extra care.

Now, what I'm wondering is how it would handled in Europe? Hubby, on
his trip, just sprained his knee and had to go to a local hospital - he
said UK's healthcare system REALLY kicks our butt (in fact, he's
talking about either running for office and changing things or moving
there - but then, he IS on pain-killers). Will anyone from the UK pipe
up and let us know??

If you feel seriously about this issue to respond, signing the petition is
not extremely helpful.  If you want to make a difference, send an email to
your federal congressman and senators.  Put your name and complete address
at the bottom.  Include a few SHORT remarks about why this issue is
important to you.

I have been actively involved in several &quot;marches&quot; in Washington, D.C. on
behalf of the genetic disorder my son has.  I have met with not only
congressmen and senators... but more often their health-care aides.  Meet
with them at their local offices.  If your issue has touched your life,
include a picture and a short story.  Give them a face to remember.  (In 5
years of meeting with DC politicians and their aides, we have received
appropriations especially earmarked for research for our disability in
excess of $10 million dollars.  Meeting with them face-to-face en mass does
make a difference.  Those who can't go to Washington that weekend email that
weekend.  So we get our issue in front of them hundreds (maybe thousands!!)
of times within a week.  It works!)

I have learned that a bunch of &quot;names&quot; on a petition does not carry much
water.  Elected officials listen to their constituents.  They want to be
re-elected.  So a personal message directly to the person who casts YOUR
ballot will carry far more weight.

So if this issue is important to you, spread the word around your local
community hand state and get written messages (emails) to them en mass.
Remind them that they are there to voice the opinion of their constituents.
Remind them that they are there to represent you ... and this is the message
you want them to hear and represent.

You can find contact information for your representatives here:
http://www.visi.com/juan/congress/

It's not that I don't support a petition -- it's just that I really want to
make a difference, I want to DO what will have greater impact.

Steve, awful as it is to say, I believe that this truly *is* the norm
these days. I know far too many people who are sent home to care for
themselves or to have family members care for them, when what they need
is trained medical personnel to make sure that things are going
smoothly. It's a scandal.

I think I'd start by firing the dr.  I did some nosing around and can't
find anywhere that has info on what state laws are at this time.  I know
there are some already inacted and if anyone can find a good list of
that info I'd like to see it.  A close friend is just finishing up post
bc reconstruction.  Here in CA insurance companies have to provide that
as per law.    I don't know about hospital stay length though.  I bet
there already are some laws in place. We should at least be informed
about those.
Sending well wishes to your students mom.  I do have to say for anyone
thinking socialized medicine will fix our problems to look at the
bridge that the government is in charge of keeping safe for us.
They don't do a good job at much of anything except line their pockets
it sometimes seems.

My mum had a lumpectomy, not a mastectomy, she was in hospital 8 days!!!
This was a private hospital, rather than NHS hospital in the UK, she'd
still have been in 4+ days on the NHS.

As with everything, somethings are better in the UK, some are worse,
I've lived 27 years in the UK, and only 1 in the US, with various
problems I've had at this particular time, the US system has treated me
well, we do have very good insurance, but even with less good insurance,
I likely still could have done pretty well, due to the element of
choice, something that in practice you don't get in the UK, or at least
don't get in some areas (both geographical and medical!).

On the other hand, whilst pregnancy and postnatal is underfunded and
understaffed, I'd still far rather be pregnant and have a baby in the UK
, I have American friends who've done both and prefer the UK system!

Yep, I know. Simply changing our healthcare system to socialized
wouldn't help (though, hubby would disagree - he does have that nasty
optimist streak) ... our whole system is screwed up (proud to be an
American - don't get me wrong). The powers that be would find a way to
corrupt it and fatten their bank accounts. :(

Like I said, I'm durn proud to be an American. But the heart of this
nation is the average person, not the politicians. Them, I don't
support, except for a VERY few. Mainly because they don't support US.
And as my momma used to say, you can't spell &quot;US of A&quot; without US! :(

No, Taria.  It is not a choice for everyone.  Medical insurance has
become more common as an employment perq., and now more individuals are
taking it out themselves - it is quite flexible and you can choose what
elements can be covered.  On the other hand, if you are prepared to pay
the full amount yourselves, it is open to 'everyone' - all who can
afford it, anyway.  But, the theoretical choice is there for everyone.

Having the National Health Service, as it is called, is a great boon to
the vast majority of the population.  Very few people pay privately for
their family doctor; people over a certain age, or with a life-dependant
medication, receive free prescriptions.  Children and seniors receive
free eye tests.  Children receive free dental treatment, on the whole -
though some dentists' practices are now 'private only' (there has been
quite a bit of trouble about dentists' contract terms).
Mostly, you can opt to see a specialist privately, as it is normally
quicker. However, if you have an accident on the road (or anywhere) you
are taken straight to the nearest hospital in a free ambulance, and you
are treated free.
Some specialisms have awfully long waiting lists; and there are
certainly problems.  Some medications are not funded by all Health
Authorities (eg some of the Alzheimer's and cancer treatments which are
very expensive).  In those situations, you could opt to pay for it, if
you can afford it.

Just a summary - apologies if I have omitted 'stuff'.

Yea, I guess that would be the case - each system having it's pros and
cons. But still, no one in your system gets left out, right? I mean,
the single mom who barely keeps ends at arm's length will STILL have
healthcare, right? Her baby has less chance of dying of some childhood
illness merely because she couldn't afford vaccinations, right?

My point is, I guess, that with your system, even though the choices
are limited, everyone's covered. No one's left out. I used to volunteer
at local food kitchens and you'd be surprised at how many people are
left without healthcare ... more than you think. Most are kids. :(

What's most important to me - and I guess, because I DO have good
insurance and choices I might be skewed in my priorities -  is that
single moms who can barely afford day care, much less food, can still
get healthcare for their babies. Little old ladies can still get
adequate healthcare - and not just dumped on a sidewalk after a
dangerous (and traumatizing) procedure.

Thanks Patti,  I am just curious how it all works.  The grass is always
greener, you know.   Last mammogram I had (we personally have insurance
through employment)  was in a hospital and the made me sign a paper
that informed me if I couldn't pay they would help connect me with a
program that would.  They had to offer it to me.  We are HMO in a
somewhat remote location (medically that is) which  means many of our
doctors are sub par.  I have had to make the decision to go to a doctor
of choice for cash. It wasn't easy financially at that
time but when it comes to good health not a lot is more important.
Nationalized health care is coming here.  I just don't like the idea
of not having choices.  There isn't much the government does well,
any government.

The NHS has waiting times for most things, they have been reduced, but
10 years ago or so, they were very bad, so lots of people were keen to
have private health insurance, some of them cover all things, there are
cheaper packages that exclude cancer treatment and other serious things,
but would cover things that typically have a long waiting list like hip
replacements.

Many companies provide health insurance for their employees, as it's
cheaper to do that then deal with the increased number of sick days due
to unresolved medical problems.

My parents weren't in that situation, but about 15 years ago, they saw a
good deal on insurance for the whole family and went for it, hence this
operation being in a private hospital, I think it was the first time
she'd used the insurance, obviously now her premium has gone up
significantly, but they still feel it's worth it.

I was covered on their plan until I was 21, I ended up having 2 joint
surgeries, my doctor referred me on the NHS too and when they sent
through appointment dates for initial consultation they were over a
year, and then it could have been a year or more on the surgery waiting
list.

If you opt to pay for medication, you also have to go private with the
rest of your treatment - there are moves to change this and allow people
to continue with NHS treatment but pay drug costs, but there is an
equally strong lobby against it as they don't want to start a system
where some things are free and some things are charged and see it as the
start of a slippery slope. Though with drug prices for some drugs the
way they are, I can't see how the NHS ever will be able to pay all the
costs.

Absolutely! The problem is, I can't see the NHS staying entirely free
for long, dental treatment for years has always had small fees attached
(current problems with dentists in the UK are a whole other story!) and
I can see things like that coming in in other areas. However childhood
vaccines are going to be near last on the list for having a charge
attached to them, as would anything relating to children - there is no
payment for anything relating to children and anything that could
potentially have a charge has numerous clauses giving it free to certain
people, so women get things free whilst pregnant and upto a year after
the birth.

Though it seems great that it's basically free, when you dig deeper
there are a lot of issues, physical therapy is often restricted in the
number of sessions, they also seem to use a restricted number of
techniques. If you have a rare condition that isn't life threatening,
you often can't see a specialist as if they are not in your area, your
GP has to apply for funding for you to see someone out of area, which
you won't get in many areas if it's not life threatening.

It's complex, I don't think there is any right answer, if you go to
nationalised health care, you are almost certainly going to have a
private system running along side it, because there always are people
who will pay.

Steve,
I had a mastectomy and a modified mastectomy in Sept. 2003. I had them
on a Thursday and went home Monday afternoon. I could have stayed for
another 2 days but I was feeling so good, I wanted to get home. I
don't understand some insurance companies. A woman or man needs 2 or 3
days, not counting the surgery day. I have signed this petition and
others. I hope someone does something.

Venting is good... Hope your friend is doing okay.

And there are the people like DH and myself. We are currently (since
June) without health insurance. It was costing us more than our mortgage
payment. We tried to keep up the insurance, and let the mortgage go, now
we are out on both... sigh.
Insurance costs for us is over $1000 a month. We are currently trying to
get AHCCCS (the Arizona &quot;Medicaid&quot;) but not sure we will either qualify
or be able to afford that. sigh.
So we are going without meds, and trying to cope. It isn't easy and
makes us both wish there were at least basic National health coverage
for everyone here in the states.

Depending on the insurance coverage, having this type of surgery done
on an out-patient basis and then being sent home once you are out of
recovery *IS* standard.  Not to be mean to the men here but it's men who
run the insurance companies and those particular men obviously don't
think women need better post-operative health care!  If just one of
those insurance company executives had to be treated like this after
having a breast removed (yes, men can get breast cancer), you can be
sure that the coverage would be different!
Too many insurance companies have tried to reduce coverage for
things like hysterectomies, pregnancy and other female specific health
issues only to find that the cost for treating the woman after the
complications started was much more expensive.  Fortunately, yearly
mammograms are 100% by most insurance companies.  They finally learned
that old adage about an ounce of prevention!   Don't fool yourselves,
it's the insurance companies who rule the world, NOT the politicians!!

&gt; things like hysterectomies, pregnancy and other female specific health
&gt; issues only to find that the cost for treating the woman after the
&gt; complications started was much more expensive.  Fortunately, yearly
&gt; mammograms are 100% by most insurance companies.  They finally learned
&gt; that old adage about an ounce of prevention!   Don't fool yourselves,
&gt; it's the insurance companies who rule the world, NOT the politicians!!
">

Now, that's true ... but it's the politicians who control the insurance
companies. They pass the laws and regs that ins companies have to
adhere to.

For example, after YEARS of being pushed, Jeb Bush (FL) changed the
Medicare law in FL to allow people who need major transplants to be
&quot;grandfathered in&quot; if they were on the list prior to turning 21 (that
credit goes to my SIL who pushed Jeb so hard and all the wonderful
people who supported her).

So politicians CAN affect regs and laws when it comes to healthcare.
Otherwise, what's the point of e-mailing our congressman and pitching a
blue fit over how poorly people are being treated by the ins companies?

However, AFAIK, when the laws are changed and ins companies DO have to
allow more coverage, we all pay for it. That's why insurance is so
ungodly expensive.

But then, that's how it is with ALL kinds of insurance. Because FL
lawmakers put more pressure on home insurers (rental and &quot;home&quot;) to
give better Flood coverage to policy holders IF they offer that
coverage AND because of all the crappy weather we had (hurricanes,
tornadoes, flooding, etc) last year, many ins companies have eliminated
flood insurance here.

We've had USAA for the past 12 years (if not longer) and we've been
covered under their Flood policy for the past four years(?) - but
they've stopped offering Flood ins in Fl (many companies have). But we
were &quot;grandfathered in&quot; since we already had the policies to start
with. Anyone just moving to Fl is outta luck, though.

But believe me, our rates went UP. We're paying nearly twice what we
paid last year.

Its is very hard to imagine that this would happen, my mom who five years
ago had a lumpectomy stayed over night in the hospital, but mind you it was
to have only been a day surgery thing as well. Her operation was to have
been at 11:30am, had to be at the hospital at 6am, she didn't have the
operation until 6pm. Because the operation was so late and only done at the
insistence of her Doctor at the time, ( the hospital it self wanted to
postpone the operation) that was the reason why she was able to stay over
night but none the less was out at 7am the next day.
Turns out that the type of cancer my mom had was the most aggressive and
deadly.Hers was thankfully at a barely stage one and no lymph nodes
involved. She is now 5 years cancer free. Steve I hope that your friends
mother has enough love and support behind her as my mom did. It does help.
It is horrid that a human being can be treated like this with out fear of
consequences. Health care no matter where you are is suffering because of
the bottom line. Its sad to know that a human life is not as equal to a
dollar any more. Should be the other way around in my books, life is more
important then the dollar but as &quot;They&quot; say money makes the world go round.

By the way who are &quot;They&quot; &quot;Them&quot;?

&gt; &gt; Yea, I guess that would be the case - each system having it's pros and
&gt; &gt; cons. But still, no one in your system gets left out, right? I mean,
&gt; &gt; the single mom who barely keeps ends at arm's length will STILL have
&gt; &gt; healthcare, right? Her baby has less chance of dying of some childhood
&gt; &gt; illness merely because she couldn't afford vaccinations, right?

&gt; &gt; My point is, I guess, that with your system, even though the choices
&gt; &gt; are limited, everyone's covered. No one's left out. I used to volunteer
&gt; &gt; at local food kitchens and you'd be surprised at how many people are
&gt; &gt; left without healthcare ... more than you think. Most are kids. :(

&gt; &gt; What's most important to me - and I guess, because I DO have good
&gt; &gt; insurance and choices I might be skewed in my priorities -  is that
&gt; &gt; single moms who can barely afford day care, much less food, can still
&gt; &gt; get healthcare for their babies. Little old ladies can still get
&gt; &gt; adequate healthcare - and not just dumped on a sidewalk after a
&gt; &gt; dangerous (and traumatizing) procedure.

Those ads you see are put together by marketing firms for the drug and
insurance companies contracted by the state to SUPPOSEDLY take up the slack.
There are so many rules, regulations and loop holes in the system it's
criminal. Income, assets, age, marital status and health issues are all
factored into complicated formulas for eligibility and premiums charged.
Medicaid and Medicare also have contradictory rules and regulations. All
differ from state to state.  All is not as simple as it seems on those 20

Pami -- are you old enough to remember when Reconstruction wasn't
covered by insurance??  The woman who had lost her breast had to have
the surgery authorized by a Psychiatrist for her &quot;mental health&quot;!  At
the time, I was coordinator for a Women's Re-Entry program at a local
community college.  I did Peer Counseling for a number of women who had
a single or double radical mastectomy and not one of them could have
reconstructive surgery unless they paid for it out of their pocket or
went to see a shrink and convinced &quot;him&quot; that they were about to go
postal over the whole thing.  Of course, the insurance didn't cover much
of the cost of seeing the shrink, either!!  We were caught in a Catch 22
on that one until women really started to get politically active about
the whole thing.
VBS -- the way insurance coverage is going in this country, I bet
the Insurance companies want us to feel we are lucky to have out-patient
surgery for things like breast cancer!  #(*#$^%$*%*#$%(* Insurance

I think it's much fewer than anyone might imagine, since 2000, I've had
4 surgeries, all could have been day surgeries, 3 were planned to be,
but only once did I actually get out the same day and even then, it was
still several hours after everyone else had left, they were bordering on
admitting me. Maybe it's just me that reacts badly, but it seems pretty
much everything causes pain, even a keyhole surgery with minot things
done inside, the wounds can be really sore. The one I did make it home
the same day I was back with a complication within 48hrs, though the
consultant was able to treat it without readmission.

It's worrying me a bit as I need to schedule yet another surgery, my
first one in the US and I know that I'd have to be in a terrible
condition for them to keep me in, particularly as it would mean
ambulance transfer. I'm anxious about post operative pain and also about
going to the toilet, in the past I've needed bed pans or significant
help in getting to the bathroom. I can't see why it would be any
different this time. I think it will be hard for my husband as he won't
know what is normal and fine and what is to be concerned about, so he's
likely to worry about anything symptoms I get.

&gt;I have learned that a bunch of &quot;names&quot; on a petition does not carry much

&gt;you want them to hear and represent.

Signed today, Steve.  This is an issue close to my heart, my own sainted
mother is a breast cancer survivor.  She was lucky, her insurance allowed an
overnight stay in the hospital...........for a 75-year-old woman!  I shudder
to think how fast they would have booted her out the door if she had been,
say, in her 40s.

That said, any person facing a major health issue is very lucky to have
loving and caring family or friends to assist in the aftercare.  Sending
good healing thoughts and prayers to Alaska from Arizona.

Thanks, Val.  &quot;Contracted by the State&quot; means a company like United Health
Care (a for-profit company) is part of the problem, and Medicaid itself with
its conflicting regulations is another part.  In Arizona, one has to be
literally destitute before qualifying for Medicaid.  In other words, no
house, no car, no bank account or retirement plan, no assets of any kind.
If you have any assets, you must sell them and expend the proceeds on
medical care before Medicaid will step in.

It's an ugly situation, and bound to get worse unless we all make ourselves
heard.  I honestly don't mind paying taxes when the money goes to actually
helping people, or making the world truly safer.

And I won't go any further on that subject........not into flame wars at the
moment!

&gt;&gt; As a none American, I'm hazy on things here, isn't medicaid supposed to
&gt;&gt; step in in situations like this, or is that something that varies from
&gt;&gt; state to state? Here (WA), I see quite a lot of adverts for various drug
&gt;&gt; plans relating to this, the monthly charges seem very reasonable.

&gt; Those ads you see are put together by marketing firms for the drug and
&gt; insurance companies contracted by the state to SUPPOSEDLY take up the
&gt; slack. There are so many rules, regulations and loop holes in the system
&gt; it's criminal. Income, assets, age, marital status and health issues are
&gt; all factored into complicated formulas for eligibility and premiums
&gt; charged. Medicaid and Medicare also have contradictory rules and
&gt; regulations. All differ from state to state.  All is not as simple as it
&gt; seems on those 20 second commercials.
