&gt; The Marine Corps announced today
&gt; that it had dropped charges against
&gt; Lance Cpl. Justin L. Sharratt, who was
&gt; accused of murdering three Iraqi brothers
&gt; in Haditha in November 2005.&quot;
&gt; Lt. Gen. James N. Mattis, commander
&gt; of Marine Forces Central Command,
&gt; said he dropped the charges out of a
&gt; firm belief that Sharratt acted within
&gt; Marine Corps standards when forced
&gt; to make a split-second decision while
&gt; searching a house for insurgents.

AL-JILWAH (The Revelation)
Yezidi Scripture
[{snip}]
[CHAPTER IV.]

I will not give my rights to other gods. I have allowed
the creation of four substances, four times, and four corners,
because they are necessary things for creatures. The books
of Jews, Christians, and Moslems, as those who are without,
accept in a sense, so far as they agree with and conform
to, my statutes. Whatsoever is contrary to these they have
altered; do not accept it. Three things are against me,
and I hate three things. But those who keep my secret shall
receive the fulfillment of my promises. It is my desire
that all my followers shall unite in a bond of unity, lest those
who are without prevail against them. Now, then, all ye
who have followed my commandments and my teachings, reject
all the teachings and sayings of such as are without. I have
not taught these teachings, nor do they proceed from me. O
ye that have believed in me, honor my symbol and my image,
for they remind you of me. Observe my laws and my statutes.
Obey my servants and listen to whatever they may dictate to
you of the hidden things. Do not mention my name nor my
attributes, lest ye regret it; for ye do not know what
those who are without may do.

[CHAPTER V.]

O ye that have believed in me, honor my symbol and my image,
for they remind you of me. Observe my laws and my statutes.
Obey my servants and listen to whatever they may dictate
to you of the hidden things. Receive that that is dictated,
and do not carry it before those who are without, Jews, Christians,
Moslems, and others; for they know not the nature of my
teaching. Do not give them your books, lest they alter
them without your knowledge. Learn by heart the greater part
of them, lest they be altered.

Thus endeth the book of Al-Jilwah.

Sufi Martyrs

&quot;...the stormiest and most controversial early movements
within Sufism were led by Husayn ibn Mansur Haflaj
(crucified AD 922),'Ain al-QudAt Hamaddni (crucified AD 1131),
and Shahâb al-Din Suhrawardi (crucified AD 1191).
&quot;Hamaddni's idea of successive reincarnation, and the
redemption of Lucifer, added to his other non-Islamic
preachings, qualified him for burning on a cross by the
Muslim authorities when he was 33.
Al Hallâj claimed himself to be an avatar of the divinity...
and that all creatures are ultimately the manifestations of
the same original Universal Spirit. He thus also declared
Lucifer to have been redeemed and elevated to the highest
universal station, as in Yezidism. He was subjected to
exquisite tortures before being crucified in Baghdad.
At present there is a shrine dedicated to Hallâj in the
sacred Yezidi religious center and shrine complex at Lâlish,
next to the tomb of Shaykh Adi.&quot;

&quot;The Yezidis of Kurdistan have been called many things, most
notoriously 'devil-worshippers,' a term used both by
unsympathetic neighbours and fascinated Westerners. This
sensational epithet is not only deeply offensive to the Yezidis
themselves, but quite simply wrong. Yezidism is not
devil-worship, but something far more elusive, and interesting.

This religion, which has aroused so much antagonism, is
difficult to summarize succinctly. To generalize, seven Holy
Beings are venerated, chiefly Melek Tawus, the Peacock Angel.&quot;

- The Evolution of Yezidi Religion

-=O=-

&quot;Melek Tawus is an angel who has fallen from God's grace,
and for his repentance, is restored to God's favor. While in
hell, Melek Tawus, in seven thousand years filled seven jars
with his tears of repentance which extinguished the fires
of hell, or at the last judgment will be used to do so.
Melek Tawus was banished from the sight of God because he
refused to bow down, as asked, before God's creation, Adam.
But Yezidis do not identify the fallen angel with a spirit
of &quot;evil.&quot; The act of disobedience has been forgiven by god
as a father forgives a wayward son.

For the Yezidis, the internal aspect of Tawus Melek remains
alive. They hold that Tawus Melek is as fire with two
elementary qualities: fire as light and fire to burn-and
the apparently dual aspects of the &quot;good&quot; and the &quot;evil&quot;
exist within the same Person. Every human being is a mixture
of good and evil, and every Yezidi has Tawus Melek in himself.
This is one of the meanings evoked in a 19th century report
by Haji Zain al-Abidin al-Shirwani, who, in a conversation
with a Yezidi leader concerning Tawus Melek, asked, &quot;Who is
Iblis (Satan)?&quot;

'What is the reason behind your worship of him and fear of
him?&quot; The Yezidi replied, &quot;The learned are perplexed by the
comprehension of his reality and scholars are in ignorance
from detecting an atom of the valley of his realization but
the men of knowledge said in his description, if he shows
mankind his light they would have worshipped him as god. He
is hidden but near everyone. All-knowing in regard to men
and their deeds. Satan sometimes comes to you from the walls
and other times from the roofs. Occasionally he resides in
the deepest folds of the heart and sometimes he joins your
body and goes in it like blood. And it is related in the
tradition that Satan is from the fire of glory, meaning that
his glory was created from the fire of the glory of God.'

&quot;There is a myth that Prometheus created humans by mixing
Earth and Water to create the gross body; Athena breathed
Air into it, imbuing it with a Spirit-Soul. Prometheus added
the Higher Soul, which is the Fire that He took from the
Wheel of the Sun and brought to humanity in a Narthêx (giant
fennel) stalk. (The Narthêx corresponds to Shushumna, the
esoteric spinal column of yoga philosophy, which contains the
Fiery Kundalini power.) Recall also that the Thursos, the
sacred Bacchic wand, is made from the Narthêx and holds
Promethean Fire. As implied in the myth of our Promethean
origins, the Fire in our souls is akin to the Celestial Fire
(&quot;As above, so below&quot;).&quot;

- The Elements: Fire

-=O=-

&quot;Gnostic Christians maintained that the &quot;light&quot; Lucifer
brought was true enlightenment, which He gave humanity
against God's will, as Prometheus stole the fire of heaven
to bring civilization to mankind against the will of Zeus.
God denied Adam and Eve the fruit of the tree of knowledge,
desiring to keep them ignorant; but Lucifer, in the form of
the serpent, gave them the &quot;light&quot; of wisdom.
He became the Prince of the Power of the Air (Ephesians2:2)
who threw his lightning bolts at church towers. He wielded
the trident which, in Eastern symbolism is a triple
lightning-phallus destined to fertilize the Triple Goddess.
In Tantric Hindu symbology, He is the bindu, the spark that
ignites the sacred serpent and awakens the kundalini.&quot;

&quot;Gurdjieff's choice of Beelzebub as hero of the First Series
and the principal expositor of the Teaching, surely has put
those who would take it up in a position similar to the one
the Yezidis have had to endure for many centuries. Externally,
when contacted by &quot;outsiders&quot; or as Gurdjieff sometimes
referred to them, &quot;natives,&quot; the Teaching might seem, like
that of the Yezidis to be at bottom &quot;devil worship.&quot;
They would entirely miss, for instance, the prayers scattered
through the book, let alone recognize their sacred quality.
In a world that is becoming more and more divided between a
narrow sectarian &quot;fundamentalism&quot; and a &quot;liberal&quot; scientism,
the very hint of Beelzebub as hero would bring anathema from
one camp and a condescending dismissal from the other.
That the Teaching may not be casually spoken of with either
sector, helps to protect it, making it difficult for the
student to take for granted, or worse, profane.

Gurdjieff's Beelzebub, like the Yezidis Melek Tawus is a being
fallen from nearness to God, who redeems himself and is
restored to grace. Each has fallen because in self-will,
following the dictates of his reason, he acted in disobedience
to what was higher. For the Yezidis, the &quot;Devil&quot; is everywhere,
a &quot;practitioner,&quot; in the sense of the third of the types of
school about which Gurdjieff told Ouspensky, fit for the
business of the world. In his nearness and familiarity, he is
an archetype of the returning prodigal, a model for the rest
of us who have &quot;fallen,&quot; who are much closer to &quot;devils&quot; than
&quot;angels.&quot; The &quot;Devil&quot; is also what none of us wish to look at
in ourselves, but must nevertheless see, for that &quot;looking&quot;
actualizes the possibility of redemption.&quot;

&quot;The distressing struggle of integrating the shadow side of
ourselves, of wrestling with the dark angel within, is ongoing
and never ending for those who are willing to take it on.
Jung considers it a moral task of the first magnitude, and
given the godlike power conferred upon us most notably by the
ability to unleash atomic energy, the struggle assumes an
urgency and necessity for the future survival of our humankind.
Let us hope enough of us are able and willing to enter the ring.&quot;

&quot;Historically the chief role in the formation of
Christianity was played not by the teaching of
Christ but by the teaching of Paul.
Church Christianity from the very beginning
contradicted in many respects the ideas of Christ
himself. Later, the divergence became still wider.
It is by no means a new idea that Christ, if born
on earth later, not only could not be the head of
the Christian Church, but probably would not be
able even to belong to it, and in the most brilliant
periods of the might and power of the Church
would most certainly have been declared a heretic
and burned at the stake.&quot; -- Peter D. Ouspensky

&quot;What fascinates me is the gap between the
mind and reality. Extreme boredom widens the
gap; so does fatigue. But the gap can be so
light that to all intents and purposes we are
in contact with reality. Then a sudden shock
fills the inner-being with music, and you
know that there was no contact. You were
deceived. You were in your private vacuum,
slowly suffocating to death.&quot;
