This is not a joke and i am very serious.
The FBI has been harassing and mentally torturing me for
two and half years since around Oct 01. The FBI has installed
gps tracking devices in my car, tracked me like an animal,
wire tapped my phone and has been monitoring all my web surfing
activities for 2.5yrs and completely dehumanized me.
The FBI agents have been following me 24X7X60X60 everywhere
including grocery stores, retail stores, malls, restaurants and movie
theaters. The FBI agents who were following me have at times
verbally and racially abused me in retail store and grocery store
parking lots by shouting at me inanities.
One FBI agent once tried to ram into my car from behind with a
comcast van and came within one inch of hitting me from behind.
There was no traffic altercation between us and there was no
traffic on the road. The FBI agent in the comcast van never tried
to overtake me and was very angry at me and hated me for no reason.

Some of the undercover FBI vehicles with Michigan title plates
that harassed me were UFX 210 (White SUV), PPL 587 (red car),
XRA 155 (black car), BOGEY 27 (black car). One undercover FBI agent
monitoring my websurfing called me a dumbass. His email is sfra ... @aol.com
and his EBAY id is &quot;spodekmodek&quot;.
When I send resumes to potential employers, the sadistic FBI agents
who were monitoring my email and websurfing, have been badmouthing
and assasinating my character with recruiters by sending anonymous
emails and jeopardizing my job opportunities for the last 2.5 yrs.
The FBI has been interfering in my personal life for no reason. and
forced me to live like a virtual prisoner. I cannot talk to friends,
family members and prospective employers without the fear of being over
heard and recorded. I am afraid of doing everything and anything without fear.

I am not a terrorist. I am NOT A MUSLIM. I donot have
any muslim friends. I am not a drug smuggler. I did not kill
anybody. I did not threaten to kill anybody. I dont have a
record like gottis or escobars. I do not have any prior
criminal record. Why should I suffer all this harassment and
constant loss of privacy for such an extended period of time.
I am not familiar with US legal system that much. Can somebody
tell me why the sadistic FBI has such ridiculous amount of power to
harass and mentally torture me with wire and web taps, deny me any sort
of privacy, and track me like an animal with gps devices for so long.
WHy do the FBI has the right to think they are Gods and they are
always right. WHy should my life depend on what the FBI thinks of me.
This has become a game for the FBI and they are AMUSING themselves
by ruining and wrecking my life.
****************************************************************
&quot;It is *PLAIN COMMON SENSE* any human being in this situation will
obviously look for privacy and when I do, the sadistic FBI perceives
it as if I am doing something wrong&quot;. WHY IS THE FBI SO IMMATURE TO
NOT KNOW SUCH A SIMPLE THING. Do somebody have to be a rocket
scientist to know this ? Why should I suffer if the immature FBI
mistakenly thinks I am communicating with somebody.
****************************************************************
ASSUME EVERYTHING I said is true and somebody with legal knowledge
and expertise help me out here.

99% of the responders accused me of paranoia and made fun of me in
various ways, when what I said was a 100% complete fact and truth. Now
extrapolate and imagine how bad the thought process of FBI would be,
considering the fact the immature paranoid freaks that work in FBI are
from the same pool of people born and brought up in US just like you
all guys.

Ok, here is what I did in summer of 2001. I was verbally dehumanized
by a couple of ex-friends in a neighboring state and I reacted by
leaving a couple of verbally dehumanizing messages using obscene
language in their answering machines. And I made a few phone calls to
another person using dialpad and hung up without uttering a word. I
NEVER threatened anybody. Thats the worst I did and it was the
complete truth and fact. Probably some ethnic FBI cunt who speaks my
language over acted and put her own immature spin in interpretation to
suckup to her american bosses like any other third world country pussy
would do.

If what I did was a crime, the FBI should have charged me and moved
on. Why did the FBI have so much power to install gps devices in my
car, tapped my phone and web, denied me privacy and have been mentally
torturing me for 2.5 yrs.
Why am I being held to different standards from other americans.

devices in your car? How many are there and in what parts of your car?

mean?
