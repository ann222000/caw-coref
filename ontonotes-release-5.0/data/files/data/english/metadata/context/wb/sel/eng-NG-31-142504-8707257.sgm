I think it is a great idea, Dave.   Might stimulate some good discussion on
the segments you post.

Sounds good to me.
The Vimalakrti-nrdesa sutra is a bit a bridge between the secound and
third turning sutras...
between the deconsctruction of reified concepts of languge and
immediate experience....
Like the Platform Sutra of Hui-Neng...It pokes at sectarian views and
teaches basic principles...

Sounds like some good fun....

(ye gods, batton down the hatches!!!!)

let the fun begin.....

VIMALAKIRTI NIRDESA SUTRA

Translated by Robert A. F. Thurman

1. Purification of the Buddha-Field

Reverence to all Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Aryasravakas, and
Pratyekabuddhas, in the past, the present, and the future.

Thus have I heard:

At one time the Lord Buddha was in residence in the garden of
Amrapali, in the city of Vaisali, attended by a great gathering. Of
Bhikkhus there were eight thousand, all saints. They were free from
impurities and afflictions, and all had attained self-mastery. Their
minds were entirely liberated by perfect knowledge. They were calm and
dignified, like royal elephants. They had accomplished their work,
done what they had to do, cast off their burdens, attained their
goals, and totally destroyed the bonds of existence. They all had
attained the utmost perfection of every form of mind control.

Of bodhisattvas there were thirty-two thousand, great spiritual heroes
who were universally acclaimed. They were dedicated through the
penetrating activity of their great super-knowledge's and were
sustained by the grace of the Buddha. Guardians of the city of Dharma,
they upheld the true doctrine, and their great teachings resounded
like the lion's roar throughout the ten directions.

Without having to be asked, they were the natural spiritual
benefactors of all living beings. They maintained unbroken the
succession of the Three Jewels, conquering devils and foes and
overwhelming all critics.

Their mindfulness, intelligence, realization, meditation, incantation,
and eloquence all were perfected. They had attained the intuitive
tolerance of the ultimate incomprehensibility of all things. They
turned the irreversible wheel of the Dharma. They were stamped with
the insignia of sign-less-ness. They were expert in knowing the
spiritual faculties of all living beings. They were brave with the
confidence that overawes all assemblies. They had gathered the great
stores of merit and of wisdom, and their bodies, beautiful without
ornaments, were adorned with all the auspicious signs and marks.

They were exalted in fame and glory, like the lofty summit of Mount
Sumeru. Their high resolve as hard as diamond, unbreakable in their
faith in Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, they showered forth the rain of
ambrosia that is released by the light rays of the jewel of the
Dharma, which shines everywhere.

Their voices were perfect in diction and resonance, and versatile in
speaking all languages. They had penetrated the profound principle of
relativity and had destroyed the persistence of the instinctual mental
habits underlying all convictions concerning finitude and infinitude.
They spoke fearlessly, like lions, sounding the thunder of the
magnificent teaching. Unequaled, they surpassed all measure. They were
the best captains for the voyage of discovery of the treasures of the
Dharma, the stores of merit and wisdom. They were expert in the way of
the Dharma, which is straight, peaceful, subtle, gentle, hard to see,
and difficult to realize.

They were endowed with the wisdom that is able to understand the
thoughts of living beings, as well as their comings and goings. They
had been consecrated with the anointment of the peerless gnosis
(intuitive knowledge) of the Buddha. With their high resolve, they
approached the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, and the eighteen
special qualities of the Buddha.

They had crossed the terrifying abyss of the bad migrations, and yet
they assumed reincarnation voluntarily in all migrations for the sake
of disciplining living beings. Great Kings of medicine, understanding
all the sicknesses of passions, they could apply the medicine of the
Dharma appropriately. They were inexhaustible mines of limitless
virtues, and they glorified innumerable Buddha-fields with the
splendor of these virtues. They conferred great benefit when seen,
heard, or even approached. Were one to extol them for innumerable
hundreds of thousands of myriads of aeons, one still could not exhaust
their mighty flood of virtues.

These bodhisattvas were named: Samadarsana, Asamadarsana,
Samadhivikurvitaraja, harmesvara, Dharmaketu, Prabhaketu, Prabhavyuha,
Ratnavyuha, Mahavyuha, Pratibhanakuta, Ratnakuta, Ratnapani,
Ratnamudrahasta, Nityapralambahasta, Nityotksipthasta, Nityatapta,
Nityamuditendriya, Pramodyaraja, Devaraja, Pranidhanapravesaprapta,
Prasiddhapratisamvitprapta, Gaganaganja, Ratnolkaparigrhita,
Ratnasura, Ratnapriya, Ratnasri, Indrajala, Jaliniprabha,
Niralambanadhyana, Prajnakuta, Ratnadatta, Marapramardaka, Vidyuddeva,
Vikurvanaraja, Kutanimittasamatikranta, Simhanadanadin,
Giryagrapramardiraja, Gandhahastin, Gandhakunjaranaga, Nityodyukta,
Aniksiptadhura, Pramati, Sujata, Padmasrigarbha, Padmavyuha,
Avalokitesvara, Mahasthamaprapta, Brahmajala, Ratnadandin,
Marakarmavijeta, Ksetrasamalamkara, Maniratnacchattra, Suvarnacuda,
Manicuda, Maitreya, Manjusrikumarabhuta, and so forth, with the
remainder of the thirty-two thousand.

There were also gathered there ten thousand Brahmas, at their head
Brahma Sikhin, who had come from the Ashoka universe with its four
sectors to see, venerate, and serve the Buddha and to hear the Dharma
from his own mouth. There were twelve thousand Sakras, from various
four-sector universes. And there were other powerful gods: Brahmas,
Sakras, Lokapalas, devas, nagas, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas,
kimnaras, and mahoragas. Finally, there was the fourfold community,
consisting of Bhikkhus, Bhikkhunis, laymen, and laywomen.

The Lord Buddha, thus surrounded and venerated by these multitudes of
many hundreds of thousands of living beings, sat upon a majestic lion-
throne and began to teach the Dharma. Dominating all the multitudes,
just as Sumeru, the king of mountains, looms high over the oceans, the
Lord Buddha shone, radiated, and glittered as he sat upon his
magnificent lion-throne.

Thereupon, the Licchavi bodhisattva Ratnakara, with five hundred
Licchavi youths, each holding a precious parasol made of seven
different kinds of jewels, came forth from the city of Vaisali and
presented himself at the grove of Amrapali. Each approached the
Buddha, bowed at his feet, circumambulated him clockwise seven times,
laid down his precious parasol in offering, and withdrew to one side.

As soon as all these precious parasols had been laid down, suddenly,
by the miraculous power of the Lord, they were transformed into a
single precious canopy so great that it formed a covering for this
entire billion-world galaxy. The surface of the entire billion-world
galaxy was reflected in the interior of the great precious canopy,
where the total content of this galaxy could be seen: limitless
mansions of suns, moons, and stellar bodies; the realms of the devas,
nagas, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kimnaras, and mahoragas,
as well as the realms of the four Maharajas; the king of mountains,
Mound Sumeru; Mount Himadri, Mount Mucilinda, Mount Mahamucilinda,
Mount Gandhamadana, Mount Ratnaparvata, Mount Kalaparvata, Mount
Cakravada, Mount Mahacakravada; all the great oceans, rivers, bays
torrents, streams, brooks, and springs; finally, all the villages,
suburbs, cities, capitals, provinces, and wildernesses. All this could
be clearly seen by everyone. And the voices of all the Buddhas of the
ten directions could be heard proclaiming their teachings of the
Dharma in all the worlds, the sounds reverberating in the space
beneath the great precious canopy.

At this vision of the magnificent miracle affected by the supernatural
power of the Lord Buddha, the entire host was ecstatic, enraptured,
astonished, delighted, satisfied, and filled with awe and pleasure.
They all bowed down to the Tathágata, withdrew to one side with palms
pressed together, and gazed upon him with fixed attention. The young
Licchavi Ratnakara knelt with his right knee on the ground raised his
hands; palms pressed together in salute of the Buddha, and praised him
with the following hymn:

Pure are your eyes, broad and beautiful, like the petals of a blue
lotus.

Pure is your thought, having discovered the supreme transcendence of
all trances.

Immeasurable is the ocean of your virtues, the accumulation of your
good deeds.

You affirm the path of peace.

Oh, Great Ascetic, obeisance to you!

Leader, bull of men, we behold the revelation of your miracle.

The superb and radiant fields of the Sugatas appear before us,

And your extensive spiritual teachings, that lead to immortality

Make themselves heard throughout the whole reach of space.

Dharma-King, you rule with the Dharma your supreme Dharma-kingdom,

And thereby bestow the treasures of the Dharma upon all living beings.

Expert in the deep analysis of things, you teach their ultimate
meaning.

Sovereign Lord of Dharma, obeisance to you.

All these things arise dependently, from causes,

Yet they are neither existent nor nonexistent.

Therein is neither ego, nor experiencer, nor doer,

Yet no action, good or evil, loses its effects.

Such is your teaching.

O Shakyamuni, conquering the powerful host of Mara,

You found peace, immortality, and the happiness of that supreme
enlightenment,

Which is not realized by any among the heterodox,

Though they arrest their feeling, thought and mental processes.

O Wonderful King of Dharma,

You turned the wheel of Dharma before men and gods,

With its threefold revolution, its manifold aspects,

Its purity of nature, and its extreme peace;

And thereby the Three Jewels were revealed.

Those who are well disciplined by your precious Dharma

Are free of vain imaginings and always deeply peaceful.

Supreme doctor, you put an end to birth, decay, sickness, and death.

Immeasurable Ocean of virtue, obeisance to you!

Like Mount Sumeru, you are unmoved by honor or scorn.

You love moral beings and immoral beings equally.

Poised in equanimity,

Thanks!  I was wondering about some of that.

I was also wondering about the time period, since they talk about an
&quot;Ashoka Universe.&quot; I know Ashoka was good, but didn't know he had his
own universe! :)  Know any cool historical factoids about this?

The human world is called &quot;Jambudvipa&quot; after the Jambu (&quot;rose-apple)
tree. The Ashoka universe above
mentioned is named after the Ashoka tree. Both trees are sacred in
Hindu and Buddhist teachings...

The Vimalakrti-nirdesa was written down circa 100 B.C.E. to 100 C.E.

2. Inconceivable Skill in Liberative Technique

At that time, there lived in the great city of Vaisali a certain
Licchavi, Vimalakirti by name. Having served the ancient Buddhas, he
had generated the roots of virtue by honoring them and making
offerings to them. He had attained tolerance as well as eloquence. He
played with the great super-knowledge's. He had attained the power of
incantations and the fearlessnesses. He had conquered all demons and
opponents. He had penetrated the profound way of the Dharma. He was
liberated through the transcendence of wisdom. Having integrated his
realization with skill in liberative technique, he was expert in
knowing the thoughts and actions of living beings. Knowing the
strength or weakness of their faculties, and being gifted with
unrivaled eloquence, he taught the Dharma appropriately to each.
Having applied himself energetically to the Mahayana, he understood it
and accomplished his tasks with great finesse. He lived with the
deportment of a Buddha, and his superior intelligence was as wide as
an ocean. He was praised, honored, and commended by all the Buddhas
and was respected by Indra, Brahma, and all the Lokapalas. In order to
develop living beings with his skill in liberative technique, he lived
in the great city of Vaisali.

His wealth was inexhaustible for the purpose of sustaining the poor
and the helpless. He observed a pure morality in order to protect the
immoral. He maintained tolerance and self-control in order to
reconcile beings who were angry, cruel, violent, and brutal. He blazed
with energy in order to inspire people who were lazy. He maintained
concentration, mindfulness, and meditation in order to sustain the
mentally troubled. He attained decisive wisdom in order to sustain the
foolish.

He wore the white clothes of the layman, yet lived impeccably like a
religious devotee. He lived at home, but remained aloof from the realm
of desire, the realm of pure matter, and the immaterial realm. He had
a son, a wife, and female attendants, yet always maintained
continence. He appeared to be surrounded by servants, yet lived in
solitude. He appeared to be adorned with ornaments, yet always was
endowed with the auspicious signs and marks. He seemed to eat and
drink, yet always took nourishment from the taste of meditation. He
made his appearance at the fields of sports and in the casinos, but
his aim was always to mature those people who were attached to games
and gambling. He visited the fashionable heterodox teachers, yet
always kept unswerving loyalty to the Buddha. He understood the
mundane and transcendental sciences and esoteric practices, yet always
took pleasure in the delights of the Dharma. He mixed in all crowds,
yet was respected as foremost of all.

In order to be in harmony with people, he associated with elders, with
those of middle age, and with the young, yet always spoke in harmony
with the Dharma. He engaged in all sorts of businesses, yet had no
interest in profit or possessions. To train living beings, he would
appear at crossroads and on street corners, and to protect them he
participated in government. To turn people away from the Hinayana and
to engage them in the Mahayana, he appeared among listeners and
teachers of the Dharma. To develop children, he visited all the
schools. To demonstrate the evils of desire, he even entered the
brothels. To establish drunkards in correct mindfulness, he entered
all the cabarets.

He was honored as the businessman among businessmen because he
demonstrated the priority of the Dharma. He was honored as the
landlord among landlords because he renounced the aggressiveness of
ownership. He was honored as the warrior among warriors because he
cultivated endurance, determination, and fortitude. He was honored as
the aristocrat among aristocrats because he suppressed pride, vanity,
and arrogance. He was honored as the official among officials because
he regulated the functions of government according to the Dharma. He
was honored as the prince of princes because he reversed their
attachment to royal pleasures and sovereign power. He was honored as a
eunuch in the royal harem because he taught the young ladies according
to the Dharma.

He was compatible with ordinary people because he appreciated the
excellence of ordinary merits. He was honored as the Indra among
Indra's because he showed them the temporality of their lordship. He
was honored as the Brahma among Brahmas because he showed them the
special excellence of gnosis. He was honored as the Lokapala among
Lokapalas because he fostered the development of all living beings.

Thus lived the Licchavi Vimalakirti in the great city of Vaisali,
endowed with an infinite knowledge of skill in liberative techniques.

At that time, out of this very skill in liberative technique,
Vimalakirti manifested himself as if sick. To inquire after his
health, the king, the officials, the lords, the youths, the
aristocrats, the householders, the businessmen, the town-folk, the
country-folk, and thousands of other living beings came forth from the
great city of Vaisali and called on the invalid. When they arrived,
Vimalakirti taught them the Dharma, beginning his discourse from the
actuality of the four main elements:

&quot;Friends, this body is so impermanent, fragile, unworthy of
confidence, and feeble. It is so insubstantial, perishable, short-
lived, painful, filled with diseases, and subject to changes. Thus, my
friends, as this body is only a vessel of many sicknesses, wise men do
not rely on it. This body is like a ball of foam, unable to bear any
pressure. It is like a water bubble, not remaining very long. It is
like a mirage, born from the appetites of the passions. It is like the
trunk of the plantain tree, having no core. Alas! This body is like a
machine, a nexus of bones and tendons. It is like a magical illusion,
consisting of falsifications. It is like a dream, being an unreal
vision. It is like a reflection, being the image of former actions. It
is like an echo, being dependent on conditioning. It is like a cloud,
being characterized by turbulence and dissolution. It is like a flash
of lightning, being unstable, and decaying every moment. The body is
ownerless, being the product of a variety of conditions.

&quot;This body is inert, like the earth; selfless, like water; lifeless,
like fire; impersonal, like the wind; and non-substantial, like space.
This body is unreal, being a collocation of the four main elements. It
is void, not existing as self or as self-possessed. It is inanimate,
being like grass, trees, walls, clods of earth, and hallucinations. It
is insensate, being driven like a windmill. It is filthy, being an
agglomeration of pus and excrement. It is false, being fated to be
broken and destroyed, in spite of being anointed and massaged. It is
afflicted by the four hundred and four diseases. It is like an ancient
well, constantly overwhelmed by old age. Its duration is never certain
- certain only is its end in death. This body is a combination of
aggregates, elements, and sense-media, which are comparable to
murderers, poisonous snakes, and an empty town, respectively.

Therefore, such a body should repulse you. You should despair of it
and should arouse your admiration for the body of the Tathágata.

&quot;Friends, the body of a Tathágata is the body of Dharma, born of
gnosis. The body of a Tathágata is born of the stores of merit and
wisdom. It is born of morality, of meditation, of wisdom, of the
liberations, and of the knowledge and vision of liberation. It is born
of love, compassion, joy, and impartiality. It is born of charity,
discipline, and self-control. It is born of the path of ten virtues.
It is born of patience and gentleness. It is born of the roots of
virtue planted by solid efforts. It is born of the concentrations, the
liberations, the meditations, and the absorptions. It is born of
learning, wisdom, and liberative technique. It is born of the thirty-
seven aids to enlightenment. It is born of mental quiescence and
transcendental analysis. It is born of the ten powers, the four
fearless-nesses, and the eighteen special qualities. It is born of all
the transcendences. It is born from sciences and super-knowledge's. It
is born of the abandonment of all evil qualities, and of the
collection of all good qualities. It is born of truth. It is born of
reality. It is born of conscious awareness.

&quot;Friends, the body of a Tathágata is born of innumerable good works.
Toward such a body you should turn your aspirations, and, in order to
eliminate the sicknesses of the passions of all living beings, you
should conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment.&quot;

While the Licchavi Vimalakirti thus taught the Dharma to those who had
come to inquire about his sickness, many hundreds of thousands of
living beings conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect
enlightenment.

The Buddha:

&quot;Form is like a mass of foam, it has no solidity, it is full of gaps
and holes, and
it has no substantial inner core. Feeling is like a bubble which
swiftly rises and swiftly disappears,
and it has no durable substance. Perception is like a mirage - as in a
mirage pool no water can be found.
Impulses are like the trunk of a plantain tree - when you strip off
one leaf-sheath after another no
core is found. Consciousness is like an illusion show, as when
magically created soldier conjured up
by the presenter are seen by the audience to be marching through the
streets.

The following similes are likewise traditional. Each chapter of the
third section of
Longchenpa's &quot;Finding Comfort and Ease&quot; is based on one of them.

i'm a little suspicious of this translation, to say the least. If i
had the sanskrit i could try to make
sense of it...i think i could find it online, but i got zero time
right now. The basic notion is not
to be attached to our notions of some body owned by some self as both
notions (solid thing and solid self)
are just flawed notions. Therefore one renounces such clinging to
notions and aspires to unfolding the
trikaya -dharmakaya,sambhogakaya,and nirmanakaya (gestalt of
possibility, communicative play, and
actuality - so to speak, not &quot;body&quot;) of the &quot;Tathagata&quot; -the &quot;thus-
unfolded&quot; or &quot;thus-unbound&quot;....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &quot;Friends, the body of a Tathágata is the body of Dharma, born of

">

Again...stinky translation. Refers to the &quot;dharmakaya&quot; born from
jnana.
&quot;Dharmakaya&quot; refers to a vision of possibility as opposed to being
stuck in any limited view about
ourselves or others or the world. Thurman is being silly and
translating &quot;jnana&quot; by the cognate indoeuropean
roots as &quot;gnosis&quot;. Jnana refers to awareness, so to speak before it is
reduced to &quot;awaeness  and object&quot;.
The Tibetan translation of jnana is &quot;ye.shes&quot; &quot;awareness before (a
sense of) time&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The body of a Tathágata is born of the stores of merit and
&gt; &gt; wisdom.
">

Thurman seems to be translating from the Tibetan, and with some old
english rust on the Gelug version of dharma.
&quot;Merit&quot; refers to the first five stages of the bodhisattva path -
openness/generosity, discipline, patience, exertion,
and meditation. &quot;Wisdom&quot; was a bad translation from the 1900s of
prajna - intensive examination without preconception....prajna informs
ethical activity and leads to jnana....The knot unwinds so to speak,
and then there is
unbinding &quot;nirvana&quot;...

These are the three categories of the good ol' eightfold path.

So -

&quot;if you follow the eightfold path , ethics and meditation will lead to
insight into a sense of possibility and openness

There's been some tomfoolery translating &quot;hina&quot; as well. It doesn't
just mean lesser as early translators
misused it. &quot;Hina&quot; means &quot;narrow&quot; in later mahayana. In hinayana free
ourselves from attachment and suffering,
without which we still be trying to prop ourselves up with the drama
of others, so to speak. So fisrst the narrow path, then pratimoksha,
individual liberation, then, if  there is the aspiration, the
boddhisattva path. You will find this same course of study in such
Theravadin works as Buddhaghosa's Vissudhimagga. The Prajnaparamita
sutras and  theravadin suttas are closely related as you have noticed.

Vimalakrti would only have turned away those from seeking to renounce
society who had a sense that society was quite open and workable. Part
of the bodhisattva vows - not to teach sunyata to those who are
unready, not to teach
the bodhisattva path to those who seek rest, etc....

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Friends, this body is so impermanent, fragile, unworthy of
&gt; &gt; &gt; confidence, and feeble. It is so insubstantial, perishable, short-
&gt; &gt; &gt; lived, painful, filled with diseases, and subject to changes. Thus, my
&gt; &gt; &gt; friends, as this body is only a vessel of many sicknesses, wise men do
&gt; &gt; &gt; not rely on it. This body is like a ball of foam, unable to bear any
&gt; &gt; &gt; pressure. It is like a water bubble, not remaining very long. It is
&gt; &gt; &gt; like a mirage, born from the appetites of the passions. It is like the
&gt; &gt; &gt; trunk of the plantain tree, having no core. Alas! This body is like a
&gt; &gt; &gt; machine, a nexus of bones and tendons. It is like a magical illusion,
&gt; &gt; &gt; consisting of falsifications.

&gt; &gt; This is straight from the Pali Canon:

&gt; &gt; http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.095.than.html

&gt; &gt; A teaching on the aggregates:

&gt; &gt; That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-
&gt; &gt; Gone, the Teacher, said further:

&gt; &gt; Form is like a glob of foam;
&gt; &gt; feeling, a bubble;
&gt; &gt; perception, a mirage;
&gt; &gt; fabrications, a banana tree;
&gt; &gt; consciousness, a magic trick -
&gt; &gt;         this has been taught
&gt; &gt;         by the Kinsman of the Sun.
&gt; &gt; However you observe them,
&gt; &gt; appropriately examine them,
&gt; &gt; they're empty, void
&gt; &gt;         to whoever sees them
&gt; &gt;         appropriately.

&gt; The Buddha:

&gt; &quot;Form is like a mass of foam, it has no solidity, it is full of gaps
&gt; and holes, and
&gt; it has no substantial inner core. Feeling is like a bubble which
&gt; swiftly rises and swiftly disappears,
&gt; and it has no durable substance. Perception is like a mirage - as in a
&gt; mirage pool no water can be found.
&gt; Impulses are like the trunk of a plantain tree - when you strip off
&gt; one leaf-sheath after another no
&gt; core is found. Consciousness is like an illusion show, as when
&gt; magically created soldier conjured up
&gt; by the presenter are seen by the audience to be marching through the
&gt; streets.

&gt;  - Astadasasahasrika-prajnaparamita sutra, LXXIX

&gt; The following similes are likewise traditional. Each chapter of the
&gt; third section of
&gt; Longchenpa's &quot;Finding Comfort and Ease&quot; is based on one of them.

&gt; Likewise inf the Diamond sutra we have:

&gt; star darkness candle
&gt; apparition dew-drop bubble
&gt; dream flash and cloud:
&gt; view the composite thus.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is like a dream, being an unreal
&gt; &gt; &gt; vision. It is like a reflection, being the image of former actions. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; is like an echo, being dependent on conditioning. It is like a cloud,
&gt; &gt; &gt; being characterized by turbulence and dissolution. It is like a flash
&gt; &gt; &gt; of lightning, being unstable, and decaying every moment. The body is
&gt; &gt; &gt; ownerless, being the product of a variety of conditions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;This body is inert, like the earth; selfless, like water; lifeless,
&gt; &gt; &gt; like fire; impersonal, like the wind; and non-substantial, like space.
&gt; &gt; &gt; This body is unreal, being a collocation of the four main elements. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; is void, not existing as self or as self-possessed. It is inanimate,
&gt; &gt; &gt; being like grass, trees, walls, clods of earth, and hallucinations. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; is insensate, being driven like a windmill. It is filthy, being an
&gt; &gt; &gt; agglomeration of pus and excrement. It is false, being fated to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; broken and destroyed, in spite of being anointed and massaged. It is
&gt; &gt; &gt; afflicted by the four hundred and four diseases. It is like an ancient
&gt; &gt; &gt; well, constantly overwhelmed by old age. Its duration is never certain
&gt; &gt; &gt; - certain only is its end in death. This body is a combination of
&gt; &gt; &gt; aggregates, elements, and sense-media, which are comparable to
&gt; &gt; &gt; murderers, poisonous snakes, and an empty town, respectively.

&gt; &gt; I wouldn't be suprised to find all this stuff there in the early
&gt; &gt; sutras too.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, such a body should repulse you. You should despair of it
&gt; &gt; &gt; and should arouse your admiration for the body of the Tathágata.

&gt; i'm a little suspicious of this translation, to say the least. If i
&gt; had the sanskrit i could try to make
&gt; sense of it...i think i could find it online, but i got zero time
&gt; right now. The basic notion is not
&gt; to be attached to our notions of some body owned by some self as both
&gt; notions (solid thing and solid self)
&gt; are just flawed notions. Therefore one renounces such clinging to
&gt; notions and aspires to unfolding the
&gt; trikaya -dharmakaya,sambhogakaya,and nirmanakaya (gestalt of
&gt; possibility, communicative play, and
&gt; actuality - so to speak, not &quot;body&quot;) of the &quot;Tathagata&quot; -the &quot;thus-
&gt; unfolded&quot; or &quot;thus-unbound&quot;....

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Friends, the body of a Tathágata is the body of Dharma, born of
&gt; &gt; &gt; gnosis.

&gt; Again...stinky translation. Refers to the &quot;dharmakaya&quot; born from
&gt; jnana.
&gt; &quot;Dharmakaya&quot; refers to a vision of possibility as opposed to being
&gt; stuck in any limited view about
&gt; ourselves or others or the world. Thurman is being silly and
&gt; translating &quot;jnana&quot; by the cognate indoeuropean
&gt; roots as &quot;gnosis&quot;. Jnana refers to awareness, so to speak before it is
&gt; reduced to &quot;awaeness  and object&quot;.
&gt; The Tibetan translation of jnana is &quot;ye.shes&quot; &quot;awareness before (a
&gt; sense of) time&quot;.

&gt; &gt; The body of a Tathágata is born of the stores of merit and
&gt; &gt; &gt; wisdom.

&gt; Thurman seems to be translating from the Tibetan, and with some old
&gt; english rust on the Gelug version of dharma.
&gt; &quot;Merit&quot; refers to the first five stages of the bodhisattva path -
&gt; openness/generosity, discipline, patience, exertion,
&gt; and meditation. &quot;Wisdom&quot; was a bad translation from the 1900s of
&gt; prajna - intensive examination without preconception....prajna informs
&gt; ethical activity and leads to jnana....The knot unwinds so to speak,
&gt; and then there is
&gt; unbinding &quot;nirvana&quot;...

&gt; &gt; It is born of morality, of meditation, of wisdom,

&gt; These are the three categories of the good ol' eightfold path.

&gt; So -

&gt; &quot;if you follow the eightfold path , ethics and meditation will lead to
&gt; insight into a sense of possibility and openness
&gt; free from being stuck some view or other...&quot;

&gt; &gt; Again..

&gt; &gt; &gt; of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; liberations, and of the knowledge and vision of liberation. It is born
&gt; &gt; &gt; of love, compassion, joy, and impartiality

&gt; &gt; The brahma viharas.  (I feel like i'm playing Budddhist trivial
&gt; &gt; pursuit!)

&gt; &gt; &gt;. It is born of charity,
&gt; &gt; &gt; discipline, and self-control. It is born of the path of ten virtues.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is born of patience and gentleness. It is born of the roots of
&gt; &gt; &gt; virtue planted by solid efforts. It is born of the concentrations, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; liberations, the meditations, and the absorptions. It is born of
&gt; &gt; &gt; learning, wisdom, and liberative technique. It is born of the thirty-
&gt; &gt; &gt; seven aids to enlightenment.

&gt; &gt; 4 + 4 + 4 + 5+ 5 + 7+ 8 = 37

&gt; &gt; 'Monks, although a monk who does not apply himself to the meditative
&gt; &gt; development of his mind may wish, &quot;Oh, that my mind might be free from
&gt; &gt; the taints by non-clinging!&quot;, yet his mind will not be freed. For what
&gt; &gt; reason? &quot;Because he has not developed his mind,&quot; one has to say. Not
&gt; &gt; developed it in what? In the four foundations of mindfulness, the four
&gt; &gt; right kinds of striving, the four bases of success, the five spiritual
&gt; &gt; faculties, the five spiritual powers, the seven factors of
&gt; &gt; enlightenment and the Noble Eightfold Path.'

&gt; &gt;  AN 7.67

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is born of mental quiescence and
&gt; &gt; &gt; transcendental analysis.

&gt; &quot;Mental quiescence and transcendental analysis&quot; ????
&gt; samatha-vipasyana - peacefulness and insight.
&gt; Sitting and walking meditation in other words. Post meditation
&gt; mindfulness is also thus implied.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is born of the ten powers, the four
&gt; &gt; &gt; fearless-nesses, and the eighteen special qualities. It is born of all
&gt; &gt; &gt; the transcendences. It is born from sciences and super-knowledge's. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; is born of the abandonment of all evil qualities, and of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; collection of all good qualities. It is born of truth. It is born of
&gt; &gt; &gt; reality. It is born of conscious awareness.

&gt; Lot's of lists. All refer to insights from doing sitting
&gt; &quot;meditation&quot; (just sitting and looking at yourself).

&gt; No need for any grandosity about that, and i very much doubt there was
&gt; any in the sanskrit.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Friends, the body of a Tathágata is born of innumerable good works.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Toward such a body you should turn your aspirations, and, in order to
&gt; &gt; &gt; eliminate the sicknesses of the passions of all living beings, you
&gt; &gt; &gt; should conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; While the Licchavi Vimalakirti thus taught the Dharma to those who had
&gt; &gt; &gt; come to inquire about his sickness, many hundreds of thousands of
&gt; &gt; &gt; living beings conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect
&gt; &gt; &gt; enlightenment.

&gt; &gt; Odd that he would &quot;turn people away from the Hinayana&quot; when he was so
&gt; &gt; damn well versed in it...

&gt; There's been some tomfoolery translating &quot;hina&quot; as well. It doesn't
&gt; just mean lesser as early translators
&gt; misused it. &quot;Hina&quot; means &quot;narrow&quot; in later mahayana. In hinayana free
&gt; ourselves from attachment and suffering,
&gt; without which we still be trying to prop ourselves up with the drama
&gt; of others, so to speak. So fisrst the narrow path, then pratimoksha,
&gt; individual liberation, then, if  there is the aspiration, the
&gt; boddhisattva path. You will find this same course of study in such
&gt; Theravadin works as Buddhaghosa's Vissudhimagga. The Prajnaparamita
&gt; sutras and  theravadin suttas are closely related as you have noticed.

&gt; Vimalakrti would only have turned away those from seeking to renounce
&gt; society who had a sense that society was quite open and workable. Part
&gt; of the bodhisattva vows - not to teach sunyata to those who are
&gt; unready, not to teach
&gt; the bodhisattva path to those who seek rest, etc....

I'll keep watching.   I'm enjoying the thread, Dave :-)

Dukkha translated as &quot;suffering&quot; always needs some extra explanations.   I
usually say it means dissatisfying, from undefinable dissatisfaction,
continuing through merely uncomfortable, and still continuing all the way on
up to major emotional or physical angst and total misery.    No way to put

Thanissaro Bhikkhu always uses stress, and I like to stick with that.
He says he uses it for three reasons.  The first is  that if you ask
certain people if they are suffering they will say. &quot;Nope!  I have no
suffering.&quot;  but if you ask them if they have any stress they
immediately reply, &quot;oh yes, of course I do.&quot;

The second is that stress even applies to the jhanas.  Once you've
maintained a jhanic state for awhile you can find that there is still
stress there.  It's hard to call that &quot;suffering.&quot;

The third, and my favorite, is that you can't romantacize stress.  You
can romanticize suffering as in &quot;My noble suffering.&quot;  Saying that you
have stress doesn't have that sense of admirable stoicism.  You never
hear about &quot;my noble stress.&quot;

I think the word suffering is better when applied to the &quot;whole
catastrophe&quot; which includes not just oneself but the whole of
humanity.  When I think of &quot;saving all sentient beings&quot; my compassion
is more stirred when I think of suffering than of stress.  There's
obviously a lot of it out there.

BTW, sent you an e-mail about the big relocation project. :)  Lock
your doors and windows, I'ma comin'.  Though it's still gonna take a

3. The Disciples' Reluctance to Visit Vimalakirti

Then, the Licchavi Vimalakirti thought to himself, &quot;I am sick, lying
on my bed in pain, yet the Tathágata, the saint, the perfectly
accomplished Buddha, does not consider or take pity upon me, and sends
no one to inquire after my illness.&quot;

The Lord knew this thought in the mind of Vimalakirti and said to the
venerable Shariputra, &quot;Shariputra, go to inquire after the illness of
the Licchavi Vimalakirti.&quot;

Thus having been addressed, the venerable Shariputra answered the
Buddha, &quot;Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to ask the Licchavi
Vimalakirti about his illness. Why? I remember one day, when I was
sitting at the foot of a tree in the forest, absorbed in
contemplation, the Licchavi Vimalakirti came to the foot of that tree
and said to me, 'Reverend Shariputra, this is not the way to absorb
yourself in contemplation. You should absorb yourself in contemplation
so that neither body nor mind appear anywhere in the triple world. You
should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that you can
manifest all ordinary behavior without forsaking cessation. You should
absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that you can manifest
the nature of an ordinary person without abandoning your cultivated
spiritual nature. You should absorb yourself in contemplation so that
the mind neither settles within nor moves without toward external
forms. You should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that
the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment are manifest without deviation
toward any convictions. You should absorb yourself in contemplation in
such a way that you are released in liberation without abandoning the
passions that are the province of the world.

&quot;'Reverend Shariputra, those who absorb themselves in contemplation in
such a way are declared by the Lord to be truly absorbed in
contemplation.'

&quot;Lord, when I heard this teaching, I was unable to reply and remained
silent. Therefore, I am reluctant to go to ask that good man about his
sickness.&quot;

Then, the Buddha said to the venerable Maha-Maudgalyayana,
&quot;Maudgalyayana, go to the Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his
illness.&quot; (Maha is a title that means &quot;Great&quot;)

Maudgalyayana replied, &quot;Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to the
Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his illness. Why? I remember one
day when I was teaching the Dharma to the householders in a square in
the great city of Vaisali, and the Licchavi Vimalakirti came along and
said to me, 'Reverend Maudgalyayana, that is not the way to teach the
Dharma to the householders in their white clothes. The Dharma must be
taught according to reality.

&quot;'Reverend Maudgalyayana, the Dharma is without living beings, because
it is free of the dust of living beings.

It is selfless, because it is free of the dust of desire. It is
lifeless, because it is free of birth and death. It is without
personalities, because it dispenses with past origins and future
destinies.

&quot;'The Dharma is peace and pacification, because it is free from
desire. It does not become an object, because it is free of words and
letters; it is inexpressible, and it transcends all movement of mind.

&quot;'The Dharma is omnipresent, because it is like infinite space. It is
without color, mark, or shape, because it is free of all process. It
is without the concept of &quot;mine,&quot; because it is free of the habitual
notion of possession. It is without ideation, because it is free of
mind, thought, or consciousness. It is incomparable, because it has no
antitheses. It is without presumption of conditionality, because it
does not conform to causes.

&quot;'It permeates evenly all things, because all are included in the
ultimate realm. It conforms to reality by means of the process of
nonconformity. It abides at the reality-limit, for it is utterly
without fluctuation. It is immovable, because it is independent of the
six objects of sense. It is without coming and going, for it never
stands still. It is comprised by void ness, is remarkable through sign-
less-ness, and is free of presumption and repudiation, because of wish-
less-ness. It is without establishment and rejection, without birth or
destruction. It is without any fundamental consciousness, transcending
the range of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and thought. It is without
highness and lowness. It abides without movement or activity.

&quot;'Reverend Maha-Maudgalyayana, how could there be a teaching in regard
to such a Dharma? Reverend Maha-Maudgalyayana, even the expression &quot;to
teach the Dharma&quot; is presumptuous, and those who listen to it listen
to presumption. Reverend Maudgalyayana, where there are no
presumptuous words, there is no teacher of the Dharma, no one to
listen, and no one to understand. It is as if an illusory person were
to teach the Dharma to illusory people.

&quot;'Therefore, you should teach the Dharma by keeping your mind on this.
You should be adept in regard to the spiritual faculties of living
beings. By means of the correct vision of the wisdom-eye, manifesting
the great compassion, acknowledging the benevolent activity of the
Buddha, purifying your intentions, understanding the definitive
expressions of the Dharma, you should teach the Dharma in order that
the continuity of the Three Jewels may never be interrupted.'

&quot;Lord, when Vimalakirti had discoursed thus, eight hundred
householders in the crowd conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect
enlightenment, and I myself was speechless. Therefore, Lord, I am
indeed reluctant to go to this good man to inquire about his illness.&quot;

Then, the Buddha said to the venerable Maha-Kasyapa, &quot;Maha-Kasyapa,
you go to the Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his illness.&quot;

&quot;Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to the Licchavi Vimalakirti to
inquire about his illness. Why? I remember one day, when I was in the
street of the poor begging for my food, the Licchavi Vimalakirti came
along and said to me, 'Reverend Maha-Kasyapa, to avoid the houses of
the wealthy, and to favor the houses of the poor - this is partiality
in benevolence. Reverend Maha-Kasyapa, you should dwell on the fact of
the equality of things, and you should seek alms with consideration
for all living beings at all times. You should beg your food in
awareness of the ultimate nonexistence of food. You should seek alms
for the sake of eliminating the materialism of others.

When you enter a town, you should keep in mind its actual void ness,
yet you should proceed through it in order to develop men and women.
You should enter homes as if entering the family of the Buddha. You
should accept alms by not taking anything. You should see form like a
man blind from birth, hear sounds as if they were echoes, smell scents
as if they were winds, experience tastes without any discrimination,
touch tangibles in awareness of the ultimate lack of contact in
gnosis, and know things with the consciousness of an illusory
creature. That which is without intrinsic substance and without
imparted substance does not burn. And what does not burn will not be
extinguished.

&quot;'Elder Maha-Kasyapa, if, equipoised (a state of equilibrium) in the
eight liberations without transcending the eight perversions, you can
enter the equanimity of reality by means of the equanimity of
perversion, and if you can make a gift to all living beings and an
offering to all the saints and Buddhas out of even a single measure of
alms, then you yourself may eat. Thus, when you eat, after offering,
you should be neither affected by passions nor free of passions,
neither involved in concentration nor free from concentration, neither
living in the world nor abiding in liberation.

Furthermore, those who give such alms, reverend, have neither great
merit nor small merit, neither gain nor loss. They should follow the
way of the Buddhas, not the way of the disciples. Only in this way,
Elder Maha-Kasyapa, is the practice of eating by alms meaningful.'

&quot;Lord, when I heard this teaching, I was astonished and thought:
'Reverence to all bodhisattvas! If a lay bodhisattva may be endowed
with such eloquence, who is there who would not conceive the spirit of
unexcelled, perfect enlightenment? From that time forth, I no longer
recommend the vehicles of the disciples and of the solitary sages but
recommend the Mahayana. And thus, Lord, I am reluctant to go to this
good man to inquire about his illness.&quot;

Then, the Buddha said to the venerable Subhuti, &quot;Subhuti, go to the
Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his illness.&quot;

Subhuti replied, &quot;Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to this good man
to inquire about his illness. Why? My Lord,

I remember one day, when I went to beg my food at the house of the
Licchavi Vimalakirti in the great city of Vaisali, he took my bowl and
filled it with some excellent food and said to me, 'Reverend Subhuti,
take this food if you understand the equality of all things, by means
of the equality of material objects, and if you understand the
equality of all the attributes of the Buddha, by means of the equality
of all things. Take this food if, without abandoning desire, hatred,
and folly, you can avoid association with them; if you can follow the
path of the single way without ever disturbing the egoistic views; if
you can produce the knowledge's and liberations without conquering
ignorance and the craving for existence; if, by the equality of the
five deadly sins, you reach the equality of liberation; if you are
neither liberated nor bound; if you do not see the Four Holy Truths,
yet are not the one who &quot;has not seen the truth&quot;; if you have not
attained any fruit, yet are not the one who &quot;has not attained&quot;; if you
are an ordinary person, yet have not the qualities of an ordinary
person; if you are not holy, yet are not unholy; if you are
responsible for all things, yet are free of any notion concerning
anything.

&quot;'Take this food, reverend Subhuti, if, without seeing the Buddha,
hearing the Dharma, or serving the Sangha, you undertake the religious
life under the six

&lt;Vimalakirti Sutra Part 3 snipped&gt;

On the level of polemics: Sariputta (master of Dhamma) is taught
absorbtion;

Moggalana (Master of psychic powers), is taught Dhamma;

Subhuti (Master of Emptiness), is taught non-duality (from what I can
make of it);

Anuruddha (Master of the Divine Eye), is taught about awareness (from
what I understand);

Upali (Master of Discipline), is taught about passion;

Rahula (who renounced his inheritance), is taught about renunciation
as an inner quality;

Ananda (Attendant of the Buddha) is taught about the body of a
Tahtagatha.

Okay, that was fun :)

Now, regarding the Dhamma, I really like this passage (to Subhuti):

Take this food if, without abandoning desire, hatred, and folly, you
can avoid association with them, if you can follow the path of the
single way without ever disturbing the egoistic views

and so on. It resonates with my understanding of the path factor of
&quot;Right Mindfulness&quot; (samma sati):

Come, friends, remain focused on the body in &amp; of itself -
being ardent, alert, with your minds unified, clear, concentrated, &amp;
single-minded for knowledge of the body as it actually is. (SN 47.7)

Our experience &quot;as it actually is&quot; - that is, including the three
roots (&quot;desire, hatred, folly&quot;), including self-identity views, and so

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why not continue with the translation you have? I think we'll be able
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to learn someting from it.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I will.  Just been busy.  I want to actually read these things when I
&gt;&gt; &gt; post them. I'll post later today!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This obsession with better and better translations, arguing over
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; single words, &lt;insert unkind comment about &quot;revealed&quot; religions here&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; An example: the only complete translations of the first three
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; samyuttas of the pali canon into German are very old by now, and the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; translator chose strange words for important concepts like sankhara,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sati, cetana, asava - and the conclusions some people draw from this
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; state of affairs is that they don't want to read the suttas in German
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; at all for fear of being misinformed.

&gt;&gt; &gt; There's always that wonderful translation of &quot;dukkha&quot; as &quot;Suffering&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; that turns people off to Buddhism in a heartbeat.  Especially when
&gt;&gt; &gt; it's abridged in the first noble to truth to read &quot;life is
&gt;&gt; &gt; suffering.&quot;  Ack!

&gt;&gt; &gt; Anyway I was just hoping to get a slightly better onen before I go on,
&gt;&gt; &gt; but I will go on anyway.  Just need some coffee first. :)

&gt;&gt; &gt; -DaveK

&gt;&gt; I'll keep watching.   I'm enjoying the thread, Dave :-)

&gt;&gt; Dukkha translated as &quot;suffering&quot; always needs some extra explanations.
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; usually say it means dissatisfying, from undefinable dissatisfaction,
&gt;&gt; continuing through merely uncomfortable, and still continuing all the way
&gt;&gt; on
&gt;&gt; up to major emotional or physical angst and total misery.    No way to
&gt;&gt; put
&gt;&gt; all that into a single word very well.

&gt; Thanissaro Bhikkhu always uses stress, and I like to stick with that.
&gt; He says he uses it for three reasons.  The first is  that if you ask
&gt; certain people if they are suffering they will say. &quot;Nope!  I have no
&gt; suffering.&quot;  but if you ask them if they have any stress they
&gt; immediately reply, &quot;oh yes, of course I do.&quot;

&gt; The second is that stress even applies to the jhanas.  Once you've
&gt; maintained a jhanic state for awhile you can find that there is still
&gt; stress there.  It's hard to call that &quot;suffering.&quot;

&gt; The third, and my favorite, is that you can't romantacize stress.  You
&gt; can romanticize suffering as in &quot;My noble suffering.&quot;  Saying that you
&gt; have stress doesn't have that sense of admirable stoicism.  You never
&gt; hear about &quot;my noble stress.&quot;

&gt; I think the word suffering is better when applied to the &quot;whole
&gt; catastrophe&quot; which includes not just oneself but the whole of
&gt; humanity.  When I think of &quot;saving all sentient beings&quot; my compassion
&gt; is more stirred when I think of suffering than of stress.  There's
&gt; obviously a lot of it out there.

&gt; BTW, sent you an e-mail about the big relocation project. :)  Lock
&gt; your doors and windows, I'ma comin'.  Though it's still gonna take a
&gt; couple of years...

4. The Reluctance of the Bodhisattvas

Then, the Buddha said to the bodhisattva Maitreya, &quot;Maitreya, go to
the Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his illness.&quot;

Maitreya replied, &quot;Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to that good man
to inquire about his illness. Why? Lord, I remember that one day I was
engaged in a conversation with the gods of the Tushita heaven, the god
Samtusita and his retinue, about the stage of non-regression of the
great bodhisattvas. At that time, the Licchavi Vimalakirti came there
and addressed me as follows:

&quot;'Maitreya, the Buddha has prophesied that only one more birth stands
between you and unexcelled, perfect enlightenment. What kind of birth
does this prophecy concern, Maitreya? Is it past? Is it future? Or is
it present? If it is a past birth, it is already finished. If it is a
future birth, it will never arrive. If it is a present birth, it does
not abide. For the Buddha has declared, &quot;Bhikkhus, in a single moment,
you are born, you age, you die, you transmigrate, and you are reborn.&quot;

&quot;'Then might the prophecy concern birthlessness? But birthlessness
applies to the stage of destiny for the ultimate, in which there is
neither prophecy nor attainment of perfect enlightenment.

&quot;'Therefore, Maitreya, is your reality from birth? Or is it from
cessation? Your reality as prophesied is not born and does not cease,
nor will it be born nor will it cease. Furthermore, your reality is
just the same as the reality of all living beings, the reality of all
things, and the reality of all the holy ones. If your enlightenment
can be prophesied in such a way, so can that of all living beings.
Why, because reality does not consist of duality or of diversity.
Maitreya, whenever you attain Buddhahood, which is the perfection of
enlightenment, at the same time all living beings will also attain
ultimate liberation. Why? The Tathágatas do not enter ultimate
liberation until all living beings have entered ultimate liberation.
For, since all living beings are utterly liberated, the Tathágatas see
them as having the nature of ultimate liberation.

&quot;'Therefore, Maitreya, do not fool and delude these deities! No one
abides in, or regresses from, enlightenment.

Maitreya, you should introduce these deities to the repudiation of all
discriminative constructions concerning enlightenment.

&quot;'Enlightenment is perfectly realized neither by the body nor by the
mind. Enlightenment is the eradication of all marks. Enlightenment is
free of presumptions concerning all objects. Enlightenment is free of
the functioning of all intentional thoughts. Enlightenment is the
annihilation of all convictions. Enlightenment is free from all
discriminative constructions. Enlightenment is free from all
vacillation, mentation, and agitation.

Enlightenment is not involved in any commitments. Enlightenment is the
arrival at detachment, through freedom from all habitual attitudes.
The ground of enlightenment is the ultimate realm. Enlightenment is
realization of reality. Enlightenment abides at the limit of reality.

Enlightenment is without duality, since therein are no minds and no
things. Enlightenment is equality, since it is equal to infinite
space.

&quot;'Enlightenment is un-constructed, because it is neither born nor
destroyed, neither abides nor undergoes any transformation.
Enlightenment is the complete knowledge of the thoughts, deeds, and
inclinations of all living beings. Enlightenment is not a door for the
six media of sense. Enlightenment is unadulterated, since it is free
of the passions of the instinctually driven succession of lives.
Enlightenment is neither somewhere nor nowhere, abiding in no location
or dimension. Enlightenment, not being contained in anything, does not
stand in reality. Enlightenment is merely a name and even that name is
unmoving. Enlightenment, free of abstention and undertaking, is energy-
less. There is no agitation in enlightenment, as it is utterly pure by
nature. Enlightenment is radiance, pure in essence. Enlightenment is
without subjectivity and completely without object. Enlightenment,
which penetrates the equality of all things, is undifferentiated.
Enlightenment, which is not shown by any example, is incomparable.
Enlightenment is subtle, since it is extremely difficult to realize.
Enlightenment is all-pervasive, as it has the nature of infinite
space.

Enlightenment cannot be realized, either physically or mentally. Why?
The body is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and hallucinations. And
the mind is immaterial, invisible, baseless, and unconscious.'

&quot;Lord, when Vimalakirti had discoursed thus, two hundred of the
deities in that assembly attained the tolerance of birthlessness. As
for me, Lord, I was rendered speechless. Therefore, I am reluctant to
go to that good man to inquire about his illness.&quot;

The Buddha then said to the young Licchavi Prabhavyuha, &quot;Prabhavyuha,
go to the Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his illness.&quot;

Prabhavyuha replied, &quot;Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to that good
man to inquire about his illness. Why? Lord, I remember one day, when
I was going out of the great city of Vaisali, I met the Licchavi
Vimalakirti coming in. He greeted me, and I then addressed him:
'Householder, where do you come from?' He replied, 'I come from the
seat of enlightenment.' I then inquired, 'What is meant by &quot;seat of
enlightenment&quot;?' He then spoke the following words to me, 'Noble son,
the seat of enlightenment is the seat of positive thought because it
is without artificiality. It is the seat of effort, because it
releases energetic activities. It is the seat of high resolve, because
its insight is superior. It is the seat of the great spirit of
enlightenment, because it does not neglect anything.

&quot;'It is the seat of generosity, because it has no expectation of
reward. It is the seat of morality, because it fulfills all
commitments. It is the seat of tolerance, because it is free of anger
toward any living being. It is the seat of effort, because it does not
turn back. It is the seat of meditation, because it generates fitness
of mind. It is the seat of wisdom, because it sees everything
directly.

&quot;'It is the seat of love, because it is equal to all living beings. It
is the seat of compassion, because it tolerates all injuries. It is
the seat of joy, because it is joyfully devoted to the bliss of the
Dharma. It is the seat of equanimity, because it abandons affection
and aversion.

&quot;'It is the seat of paranormal perception, because it has the six
super-knowledge's. It is the seat of liberation, because it does not
intellectualize. It is the seat of liberative technique, because it
develops living beings. It is the seat of the means of unification,
because it brings together living beings. It is the seat of learning,
because it makes practice of the essence. It is the seat of
decisiveness, because of its precise discrimination. It is the seat of
the aids to enlightenment, because it eliminates the duality of the
compounded and the uncompounded. It is the seat of truth, because it
does not deceive anyone.

&quot;'It is the seat of interdependent origination, because it proceeds
from the exhaustion of ignorance to the exhaustion of old age and
death. It is the seat of eradication of all passions, because it is
perfectly enlightened about the nature of reality. It is the seat of
all living beings, because all living beings are without intrinsic
identity. It is the seat of all things, because it is perfectly
enlightened with regard to void ness.

&quot;'It is the seat of the conquest of all devils, because it never
flinches. It is the seat of the triple world, because it is free of
involvement. It is the seat of the heroism that sounds the lion's
roar, because it is free of fear and trembling. It is the seat of the
strengths, the fearlessnesses, and all the special qualities of the
Buddha, because it is irreproachable in all respects. It is the seat
of the three knowledge's, because in it no passions remain. It is the
seat of instantaneous, total understanding of all things, because it
realizes fully the gnosis of omniscience.

&quot;'Noble son, when bodhisattvas are thus endowed with the
transcendences, the roots of virtue, the ability to develop living
beings, and the incorporation of the holy Dharma, whether they lift up
their feet or put them down, they all come from the seat of
enlightenment. They come from the qualities of the Buddha, and stand
on the qualities of the Buddha.'

&quot;Lord, when Vimalakirti had explained this teaching, five hundred gods
and men conceived the spirit of enlightenment, and I became
speechless. Therefore, Lord, I am reluctant to go to that good man to
inquire about his illness.&quot;

The Buddha then said to the bodhisattva Jagatimdhara, &quot;Jagatimdhara,
go to the Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his illness.&quot;

Jagatimdhara replied, &quot;My Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to that
good man to inquire about his illness. Why? Lord, I remember that one
day, when I was at home, the wicked Mara, disguised as Indra and
surrounded with twelve thousand heavenly maidens, approached me with
the sounds of music and singing. Having saluted me by touching my feet
with his head, he withdrew with his retinue to one side. I then,
thinking he was Sakra, the king of the gods, said to him, 'Welcome, O
Kausika! You should remain consciously aware in the midst of the
pleasures of desire. You should often think on impermanence and strive
to utilize the essential in body, life, and wealth.'

&quot;Mara then said to me, 'Good sir, accept from me these twelve thousand
divine maidens and make them your servants.'

&quot;I replied, 'O Kausika, do not offer me, who am religious and a son of
the Sakya, things which are not appropriate. It is not proper for me
to have these maidens.'

&quot;No sooner had I said these words than the Licchavi Vimalakirti came
there and said to me, 'Noble son, do not think that this is Indra!
This is not Indra but the evil Mara, who has come to ridicule you.'

&gt; 3. The Disciples' Reluctance to Visit Vimalakirti

&gt; Then, the Licchavi Vimalakirti thought to himself, &quot;I am sick, lying
&gt; on my bed in pain, yet the Tathágata, the saint, the perfectly
&gt; accomplished Buddha, does not consider or take pity upon me, and sends
&gt; no one to inquire after my illness.&quot;

&gt; and said to me, 'Reverend Shariputra, this is not the way to absorb
&gt; yourself in contemplation. You should absorb yourself in contemplation
&gt; so that neither body nor mind appear anywhere in the triple world. You
&gt; should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that you can
&gt; manifest all ordinary behavior without forsaking cessation. You should
&gt; absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that you can manifest
&gt; the nature of an ordinary person without abandoning your cultivated
&gt; spiritual nature. You should absorb yourself in contemplation so that
&gt; the mind neither settles within nor moves without toward external
&gt; forms. You should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that
&gt; the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment are manifest without deviation
&gt; toward any convictions. You should absorb yourself in contemplation in
&gt; such a way that you are released in liberation without abandoning the

&gt; &quot;'Reverend Shariputra, those who absorb themselves in contemplation in

&gt; &quot;Lord, when I heard this teaching, I was unable to reply and remained
&gt; silent. Therefore, I am reluctant to go to ask that good man about his
&gt; sickness.&quot;

&gt; Then, the Buddha said to the venerable Maha-Maudgalyayana,
&gt; &quot;Maudgalyayana, go to the Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his
&gt; illness.&quot; (Maha is a title that means &quot;Great&quot;)

&gt; Maudgalyayana replied, &quot;Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to the
&gt; Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his illness. Why? I remember one
&gt; day when I was teaching the Dharma to the householders in a square in
&gt; the great city of Vaisali, and the Licchavi Vimalakirti came along and
&gt; said to me, 'Reverend Maudgalyayana, that is not the way to teach the
&gt; Dharma to the householders in their white clothes. The Dharma must be
&gt; taught according to reality.

&gt; &quot;'Reverend Maudgalyayana, the Dharma is without living beings, because
&gt; it is free of the dust of living beings.

&gt; It is selfless, because it is free of the dust of desire. It is
&gt; lifeless, because it is free of birth and death. It is without
&gt; personalities, because it dispenses with past origins and future
&gt; destinies.

&gt; &quot;'The Dharma is peace and pacification, because it is free from
&gt; desire. It does not become an object, because it is free of words and
&gt; letters; it is inexpressible, and it transcends all movement of mind.

&gt; &quot;'The Dharma is omnipresent, because it is like infinite space. It is
&gt; without color, mark, or shape, because it is free of all process. It
&gt; is without the concept of &quot;mine,&quot; because it is free of the habitual
&gt; notion of possession. It is without ideation, because it is free of
&gt; mind, thought, or consciousness. It is incomparable, because it has no
&gt; antitheses. It is without presumption of conditionality, because it
&gt; does not conform to causes.

&gt; &quot;'It permeates evenly all things, because all are included in the
&gt; ultimate realm. It conforms to reality by means of the process of
&gt; nonconformity. It abides at the reality-limit, for it is utterly
&gt; without fluctuation. It is immovable, because it is independent of the
&gt; six objects of sense. It is without coming and going, for it never
&gt; stands still. It is comprised by void ness, is remarkable through sign-
&gt; less-ness, and is free of presumption and repudiation, because of wish-
&gt; less-ness. It is without establishment and rejection, without birth or
&gt; destruction. It is without any fundamental consciousness, transcending
&gt; the range of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and thought. It is without
&gt; highness and lowness. It abides without movement or activity.

&gt; &quot;'Reverend Maha-Maudgalyayana, how could there be a teaching in regard
&gt; to such a Dharma? Reverend Maha-Maudgalyayana, even the expression &quot;to
&gt; teach the Dharma&quot; is presumptuous, and those who listen to it listen
&gt; to presumption. Reverend Maudgalyayana, where there are no
&gt; presumptuous words, there is no teacher of the Dharma, no one to
&gt; listen, and no one to understand. It is as if an illusory person were
&gt; to teach the Dharma to illusory people.

&gt; &quot;'Therefore, you should teach the Dharma by keeping your mind on this.
&gt; You should be adept in regard to the spiritual faculties of living
&gt; beings. By means of the correct vision of the wisdom-eye, manifesting
&gt; the great compassion, acknowledging the benevolent activity of the
&gt; Buddha, purifying your intentions, understanding the definitive
&gt; expressions of the Dharma, you should teach the Dharma in order that
&gt; the continuity of the Three Jewels may never be interrupted.'

&gt; &quot;Lord, when Vimalakirti had discoursed thus, eight hundred
&gt; householders in the crowd conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect
&gt; enlightenment, and I myself was speechless. Therefore, Lord, I am
&gt; indeed reluctant to go to this good man to inquire about his illness.&quot;

&gt; Then, the Buddha said to the venerable Maha-Kasyapa, &quot;Maha-Kasyapa,
&gt; you go to the Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his illness.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to the Licchavi Vimalakirti to
&gt; inquire about his illness. Why? I remember one day, when I was in the
&gt; street of the poor begging for my food, the Licchavi Vimalakirti came
&gt; along and said to me, 'Reverend Maha-Kasyapa, to avoid the houses of
&gt; the wealthy, and to favor the houses of the poor - this is partiality
&gt; in benevolence. Reverend Maha-Kasyapa, you should dwell on the fact of
&gt; the equality of things, and you should seek alms with consideration
&gt; for all living beings at all times. You should beg your food in
&gt; awareness of the ultimate nonexistence of food. You should seek alms
&gt; for the sake of eliminating the materialism of others.

&gt; When you enter a town, you should keep in mind its actual void ness,
&gt; yet you should proceed through it in order to develop men and women.
&gt; You should enter homes as if entering the family of the Buddha. You
&gt; should accept alms by not taking anything. You should see form like a
&gt; man blind from birth, hear sounds as if they were echoes, smell scents
&gt; as if they were winds, experience tastes without any discrimination,
&gt; touch tangibles in awareness of the ultimate lack of contact in
&gt; gnosis, and know things with the consciousness of an illusory
&gt; creature. That which is without intrinsic substance and without
&gt; imparted substance does not burn. And what does not burn will not be
&gt; extinguished.

&gt; &quot;'Elder Maha-Kasyapa, if, equipoised (a state of equilibrium) in the
&gt; eight liberations without transcending the eight perversions, you can
&gt; enter the equanimity of reality by means of the equanimity of
&gt; perversion, and if you can make a gift to all living beings and an
&gt; offering to all the saints and Buddhas out of even a single measure of
&gt; alms, then you yourself may eat. Thus, when you eat, after offering,
&gt; you should be neither affected by passions nor free of passions,
&gt; neither involved in concentration nor free from concentration, neither
&gt; living in the world nor abiding in liberation.

&gt; Furthermore, those who give such alms, reverend, have neither great
&gt; merit nor small merit, neither gain nor loss. They should follow the
&gt; way of the Buddhas, not the way of the disciples. Only in this way,
&gt; Elder Maha-Kasyapa, is the practice of eating by alms meaningful.'

&gt; &quot;Lord, when I heard this teaching, I was astonished and thought:
&gt; 'Reverence to all bodhisattvas! If a lay bodhisattva may be endowed
&gt; with such eloquence, who is there who would not conceive the spirit of
&gt; unexcelled, perfect enlightenment? From that time forth, I no longer
&gt; recommend the vehicles of the disciples and of the solitary sages but
&gt; recommend the Mahayana. And thus, Lord, I am reluctant to go to this
&gt; good man to inquire about his illness.&quot;

&gt; Then, the Buddha said to the venerable Subhuti, &quot;Subhuti, go to the
&gt; Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his illness.&quot;

&gt; Subhuti replied, &quot;Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to this good man
&gt; to inquire about his illness. Why? My Lord,

&gt; I remember one day, when I went to beg my food at the house of the
&gt; Licchavi Vimalakirti in the great city of Vaisali, he took my bowl and
&gt; filled it with some excellent food and said to me, 'Reverend Subhuti,
&gt; take this food if you understand the equality of all things, by means
&gt; of the equality of material objects, and if you understand the
&gt; equality of all the attributes of the Buddha, by means of the equality
&gt; of all things. Take this food if, without abandoning desire, hatred,
&gt; and folly, you can avoid association with them; if you can follow the
&gt; path of the single way without ever disturbing the egoistic views; if
&gt; you can produce the knowledge's and liberations without conquering
&gt; ignorance and the craving for existence; if, by the equality of the
&gt; five deadly sins, you reach the equality of liberation; if you are
&gt; neither liberated nor bound; if you do not see the Four Holy Truths,
&gt; yet are not the one who &quot;has not seen the truth&quot;;

LOL!

In addition to being quite funny, if you can imagine the Monty
Pythonesque scene as each and every one of the Buddhas highest ranking
monks bows out of the simple task of inquiring as to layman
boddhisatva's health because he has taken each and every one them up a
notch and out of their comfort zone at some point along the way, this
opening piece also lays the way for the Chinese sensibility of placing
lay person's practice on equal terms with monks. It also lays the
philosophical groundwork for the Mahayana ideal of the Buddha not
living in solitary retreat with other monks but returning to dwell
interact amongst the common people. Another sensibility probably
Chinese influenced and probably related with the closer attention to
lay practice.

I'm a sucker for a good laugh so this chapter has always been my

I found myself chuckling through it too, but then I came to the end of the

&gt; such a way that you are released in liberation without abandoning the
&gt; passions that are the province of the world.

&gt; &quot;'Reverend Shariputra, those who absorb themselves in contemplation in
&gt; such a way are declared by the Lord to be truly absorbed in
&gt; contemplation.'

&gt; &quot;Lord, when I heard this teaching, I was unable to reply and remained
&gt; silent. Therefore, I am reluctant to go to ask that good man about his
&gt; sickness.&quot;

&gt; Then, the Buddha said to the venerable Maha-Maudgalyayana,
&gt; &quot;Maudgalyayana, go to the Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his
&gt; illness.&quot; (Maha is a title that means &quot;Great&quot;)

&gt; Maudgalyayana replied, &quot;Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to the
&gt; Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his illness. Why? I remember one
&gt; day when I was teaching the Dharma to the householders in a square in
&gt; the great city of Vaisali, and the Licchavi Vimalakirti came along and
&gt; said to me, 'Reverend Maudgalyayana, that is not the way to teach the
&gt; Dharma to the householders in their white clothes. The Dharma must be
&gt; taught according to reality.

&gt; &quot;'Reverend Maudgalyayana, the Dharma is without living beings, because
&gt; it is free of the dust of living beings.

&gt; It is selfless, because it is free of the dust of desire. It is
&gt; lifeless, because it is free of birth and death. It is without
&gt; personalities, because it dispenses with past origins and future
&gt; destinies.

&gt; &quot;'The Dharma is peace and pacification, because it is free from
&gt; desire. It does not become an object, because it is free of words and
&gt; letters; it is inexpressible, and it transcends all movement of mind.

&gt; &quot;'The Dharma is omnipresent, because it is like infinite space. It is
&gt; without color, mark, or shape, because it is free of all process. It
&gt; is without the concept of &quot;mine,&quot; because it is free of the habitual
&gt; notion of possession. It is without ideation, because it is free of
&gt; mind, thought, or consciousness. It is incomparable, because it has no
&gt; antitheses. It is without presumption of conditionality, because it
&gt; does not conform to causes.

&gt; &quot;'It permeates evenly all things, because all are included in the
&gt; ultimate realm. It conforms to reality by means of the process of
&gt; nonconformity. It abides at the reality-limit, for it is utterly
&gt; without fluctuation. It is immovable, because it is independent of the
&gt; six objects of sense. It is without coming and going, for it never
&gt; stands still. It is comprised by void ness, is remarkable through sign-
&gt; less-ness, and is free of presumption and repudiation, because of wish-
&gt; less-ness. It is without establishment and rejection, without birth or
&gt; destruction. It is without any fundamental consciousness, transcending
&gt; the range of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and thought. It is without
&gt; highness and lowness. It abides without movement or activity.

&gt; &quot;'Reverend Maha-Maudgalyayana, how could there be a teaching in regard
&gt; to such a Dharma? Reverend Maha-Maudgalyayana, even the expression &quot;to
&gt; teach the Dharma&quot; is presumptuous, and those who listen to it listen
&gt; to presumption. Reverend Maudgalyayana, where there are no
&gt; presumptuous words, there is no teacher of the Dharma, no one to
&gt; listen, and no one to understand. It is as if an illusory person were
&gt; to teach the Dharma to illusory people.

&gt; &quot;'Therefore, you should teach the Dharma by keeping your mind on this.
&gt; You should be adept in regard to the spiritual faculties of living
&gt; beings. By means of the correct vision of the wisdom-eye, manifesting
&gt; the great compassion, acknowledging the benevolent activity of the
&gt; Buddha, purifying your intentions, understanding the definitive
&gt; expressions of the Dharma, you should teach the Dharma in order that
&gt; the continuity of the Three Jewels may never be interrupted.'

&gt; &quot;Lord, when Vimalakirti had discoursed thus, eight hundred
&gt; householders in the crowd conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect
&gt; enlightenment, and I myself was speechless. Therefore, Lord, I am
&gt; indeed reluctant to go to this good man to inquire about his illness.&quot;

&gt; Then, the Buddha said to the venerable Maha-Kasyapa, &quot;Maha-Kasyapa,
&gt; you go to the Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his illness.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to the Licchavi Vimalakirti to
&gt; inquire about his illness. Why? I remember one day, when I was in the
&gt; street of the poor begging for my food, the Licchavi Vimalakirti came
&gt; along and said to me, 'Reverend Maha-Kasyapa, to avoid the houses of
&gt; the wealthy, and to favor the houses of the poor - this is partiality
&gt; in benevolence. Reverend Maha-Kasyapa, you should dwell on the fact of
&gt; the equality of things, and you should seek alms with consideration
&gt; for all living beings at all times. You should beg your food in
&gt; awareness of the ultimate nonexistence of food. You should seek alms
&gt; for the sake of eliminating the materialism of others.

&gt; When you enter a town, you should keep in mind its actual void ness,
&gt; yet you should proceed through it in order to develop men and women.
&gt; You should enter homes as if entering the family of the Buddha. You
&gt; should accept alms by not taking anything. You should see form like a
&gt; man blind from birth, hear sounds as if they were echoes, smell scents
&gt; as if they were winds, experience tastes without any discrimination,
&gt; touch tangibles in awareness of the ultimate lack of contact in
&gt; gnosis, and know things with the consciousness of an illusory
&gt; creature. That which is without intrinsic substance and without
&gt; imparted substance does not burn. And what does not burn will not be
&gt; extinguished.

&gt; &quot;'Elder Maha-Kasyapa, if, equipoised (a state of equilibrium) in the
&gt; eight liberations without transcending the eight perversions, you can
&gt; enter the equanimity of reality by means of the equanimity of
&gt; perversion, and if you can make a gift to all living beings and an

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. The Disciples' Reluctance to Visit Vimalakirti

&gt;&gt; &gt; (snip for space sake)

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Lord, such was my conversation with the Licchavi Vimalakirti, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; therefore I am reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; illness.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In the same way, the rest of the five hundred disciples were
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; reluctant
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to go to the Licchavi Vimalakirti, and each told the Buddha his own
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; adventure, recounting all his conversations with the Licchavi
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Vimalakirti.

&gt;&gt; &gt; LOL!

&gt;&gt; &gt; In addition to being quite funny, if you can imagine the Monty
&gt;&gt; &gt; Pythonesque

&gt; Yes!

&gt;&gt; scene as each and every one of the Buddhas highest ranking
&gt;&gt; &gt; monks bows out of the simple task of inquiring as to layman
&gt;&gt; &gt; boddhisatva's health because he has taken each and every one them up a
&gt;&gt; &gt; notch and out of their comfort zone at some point along the way, this
&gt;&gt; &gt; opening piece also lays the way for the Chinese sensibility of placing
&gt;&gt; &gt; lay person's practice on equal terms with monks. It also lays the
&gt;&gt; &gt; philosophical groundwork for the Mahayana ideal of the Buddha not
&gt;&gt; &gt; living in solitary retreat with other monks but returning to dwell
&gt;&gt; &gt; interact amongst the common people. Another sensibility probably
&gt;&gt; &gt; Chinese influenced and probably related with the closer attention to
&gt;&gt; &gt; lay practice.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm a sucker for a good laugh so this chapter has always been my
&gt;&gt; &gt; favorite.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I found myself chuckling through it too, but then I came to the end of
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; segment Dave posted.   So I got curious, and went to the link and read
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; whole thing.    This chapter was the most fun part, though there were
&gt;&gt; &gt; some
&gt;&gt; &gt; goodies further along though too.

&gt;&gt; The whole text is mined with goodies. :)

&gt; I'm enjoying going through it at this pace.  If I'd read the whole
&gt; thing I once I feel like I might have missed some of the stories
&gt; within the story. I enjoyed the bit with Mara.  Mara bits are always a
&gt; hoot.

I will still be following along as you post it in bits.   Even when I was in
school I used to do the same thing.  I'd read the entire book, rather than
chapter by chapter.

5. The Consolation of the Invalid

Then, the Buddha said to the crown prince, Manjusri, &quot;Manjusri, go to
the Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his illness.&quot;

Manjusri replied, &quot;Lord, it is difficult to attend upon the Licchavi
Vimalakirti. He is gifted with marvelous eloquence concerning the law
of the profound. He is extremely skilled in full expressions and in
the reconciliation of dichotomies. His eloquence is inexorable, and no
one can resist his imperturbable intellect. He accomplishes all the
activities of the bodhisattvas. He penetrates all the secret mysteries
of the bodhisattvas and the Buddhas. He is skilled in civilizing all
the abodes of devils. He plays with the great super-knowledge's. He is
consummate in wisdom and liberative technique. He has attained the
supreme excellence of the indivisible, non-dual sphere of the ultimate
realm. He is skilled in teaching the Dharma with its infinite
modalities within the uniform ultimate. He is skilled in granting
means of attainment in accordance with the spiritual faculties of all
living beings. He has thoroughly integrated his realization with skill
in liberative technique. He has attained decisiveness with regard to
all questions. Thus, although he cannot be withstood by someone of my
feeble defenses, still, sustained by the grace of the Buddha, I will
go to him and will converse with him as well as I can.&quot;

Thereupon, in that assembly, the bodhisattvas, the great disciples,
the Sakras, the Brahmas, the Lokapalas, and the gods and goddesses,
all had this thought: &quot;Surely the conversations of the young prince
Manjusri and that good man will result in a profound teaching of the
Dharma.&quot;

Thus, eight thousand bodhisattvas, five hundred disciples, a great
number of Sakras, Brahmas, Lokapalas, and many hundreds of thousands
of gods and goddesses, all followed the crown prince Manjusri to
listen to the Dharma. And the crown prince Manjusri, surrounded and
followed by these bodhisattvas, disciples, Sakras, Brahmas, Lokapalas,
gods, and goddesses, entered the great city of Vaisali.

Meanwhile, the Licchavi Vimalakirti thought to himself, &quot;Manjusri, the
crown prince, is coming here with numerous attendants. Now, may this
house be transformed into emptiness!&quot;

Then, magically his house became empty. Even the doorkeeper
disappeared. And, except for the invalid's couch upon which
Vimalakirti himself was lying, no bed or couch or seat could be seen
anywhere.

Then, the Licchavi Vimalakirti saw the crown prince Manjusri and
addressed him thus: &quot;Manjusri! Welcome, Manjusri! You are very
welcome! There you are, without any coming. You appear, without any
seeing. You are heard, without any hearing.&quot;

Manjusri declared, &quot;Householder, it is as you say. Who comes, finally
comes not. Who goes, finally goes not.

Why? Who comes is not known to come. Who goes is not known to go. Who
appears is finally not to be seen.

&quot;Good sir, is your condition tolerable? Is it livable? Are your
physical elements not disturbed? Is your sickness diminishing? Is it
not increasing? The Buddha asks about you - if you have slight
trouble, slight discomfort, slight sickness, if your distress is
light, if you are cared for, strong, at ease, without self-reproach,
and if you are living in touch with the supreme happiness.

&quot;Householder, whence came this sickness of yours? How long will it
continue? How does it stand? How can it be alleviated?&quot;

Vimalakirti replied, &quot;Manjusri, my sickness comes from ignorance and
the thirst for existence and it will last as long as do the sicknesses
of all living beings. Were all living beings to be free from sickness,
I also would not be sick. Why? Manjusri, for the bodhisattva, the
world consists only of living beings, and sickness is inherent in
living in the world. Were all living beings free of sickness, the
bodhisattva also would be free of sickness. For example, Manjusri,
when the only son of a merchant is sick, both his parents become sick
on account of the sickness of their son. And the parents will suffer
as long as that only son does not recover from his sickness. Just so,
Manjusri, the bodhisattva loves all living beings as if each were his
only child. He becomes sick when they are sick and is cured when they
are cured. You ask me, Manjusri, whence comes my sickness; the
sicknesses of the bodhisattvas arise from great compassion.&quot;

Manjusri: Householder, why is your house empty? Why have you no
servants?

Vimalakirti: Manjusri, all Buddha-fields are also empty.

Manjusri: What makes them empty?

Vimalakirti: They are empty because of emptiness.

Manjusri: What is &quot;empty&quot; about emptiness?

Vimalakirti: Constructions are empty, because of emptiness.

Manjusri: Can emptiness be conceptually constructed?

Vimalakirti: Even that concept is itself empty, and emptiness cannot
construct emptiness.

Manjusri: Householder, where should emptiness be sought?

Vimalakirti: Manjusri, emptiness should be sought among the sixty-two
convictions.

Manjusri: Where should the sixty-two convictions be sought?

Vimalakirti: They should be sought in the liberation of the
Tathágatas.

Manjusri: Where should the liberation of the Tathágatas be sought?

Vimalakirti: It should be sought in the prime mental activity of all
living beings. Manjusri, you ask me why I am without servants, but all
Mara's and opponents are my servants. Why? The Mara's advocate this
life of birth and death and the bodhisattva does not avoid life. The
heterodox opponents advocate convictions, and the bodhisattva is not
troubled by convictions. Therefore, all Mara's and opponents are my
servants.

Manjusri: Householder, of what sort is your sickness?

Vimalakirti: It is immaterial and invisible.

Manjusri: Is it physical or mental?

Vimalakirti: It is not physical, since the body is insubstantial in
itself. It is not mental, since the nature of the mind is like
illusion.

Manjusri: Householder, which of the four main elements is disturbed -
earth, water, fire, or air?

Vimalakirti: Manjusri, I am sick only because the elements of living
beings are disturbed by sicknesses.

Manjusri: Householder, how should a bodhisattva console another
bodhisattva who is sick?

Vimalakirti: He should tell him that the body is impermanent, but
should not exhort him to renunciation or disgust. He should tell him
that the body is miserable, but should not encourage him to find
solace in liberation;

that the body is selfless, but that living beings should be developed;
that the body is peaceful, but not to seek any ultimate calm. He
should urge him to confess his evil deeds, but not for the sake of
absolution. He should

encourage his empathy for all living beings on account of his own
sickness, his remembrance of suffering experienced from beginning-less
time, and his consciousness of working for the welfare of living
beings. He should encourage him not to be distressed, but to manifest
the roots of virtue, to maintain the primal purity and the lack of
craving, and thus to always strive to become the king of healers, who
can cure all sicknesses. Thus should a bodhisattva console a sick
bodhisattva, in such a way as to make him happy.

Manjusri asked, &quot;Noble sir, how should a sick bodhisattva control his
own mind?&quot;

Vimalakirti replied, &quot;Manjusri, a sick bodhisattva should control his
own mind with the following consideration: Sickness arises from total
involvement in the process of misunderstanding from beginning-less
time. It arises from the passions that result from unreal mental
constructions, and hence ultimately nothing is perceived which can be
said to be sick. Why? The body is the issue of the four main elements,
and in these elements there is no owner and no agent. There is no self
in this body, and except for arbitrary insistence on self, ultimately
no &quot;I&quot; which can be said to be sick can be apprehended. Therefore,
thinking &quot;I&quot; should not adhere to any self, and &quot;I&quot; should rest in the
knowledge of the root of illness,' he should abandon the conception of
himself as a personality and produce the conception of himself as a
thing, thinking, 'This body is an aggregate of many things; when it is
born, only things are born; when it ceases, only things cease; these
things have no awareness or feeling of each other; when they are born,
they do not think, &quot;I am born.&quot; When they cease, they do not think, &quot;I
cease.&quot;'

&quot;Furthermore, he should understand thoroughly the conception of
himself as a thing by cultivating the following consideration: 'Just
as in the case of the conception of &quot;self,&quot; so the conception of
&quot;thing&quot; is also a misunderstanding, and this misunderstanding is also
a grave sickness; I should free myself from this sickness and should
strive to abandon it.'

&quot;What is the elimination of this sickness? It is the elimination of
egoism and possessiveness. What is the elimination of egoism and
possessiveness? It is the freedom from dualism. What is freedom from
dualism? It is the absence of involvement with either the external or
the internal. What is absence of involvement with either external or
internal? It is non-deviation, non-fluctuation, and non-distraction
from equanimity. What is equanimity? It is the equality of everything
from self to liberation. Why because both self and liberation are
void. How can both be void? As verbal designations, they both are
void, and neither is established in reality. Therefore, one who sees
such equality makes no difference between sickness and void ness; his
sickness is itself void ness, and that sickness as void ness is itself
void.

&quot;The sick bodhisattva should recognize that sensation is ultimately
non-sensation, but he should not realize the cessation of sensation.
Although both pleasure and pain are abandoned when the Buddha-
qualities are fully accomplished, there is then no sacrifice of the
great compassion for all living beings living in the bad migrations.
Thus, recognizing in his own suffering the infinite sufferings of
these living beings, the bodhisattva

Thanks!

All the links back to the Theravada are very helpful to me since I've
been reading all that stuff over the past year.  Presenting it in
terms of a lay practitioner brings this even more to the fore.   It's
