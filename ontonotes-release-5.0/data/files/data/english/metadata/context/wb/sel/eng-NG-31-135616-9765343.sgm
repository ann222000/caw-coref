Lisa -

Two possibilities come to mind:

1. When you give the g95 command, are you in the directory where
test1.f90 is?

2. Is it possible that the file is actually named test1.f90.txt?
Notepad may have added .txt to the file name, and you may not see it
if Windows is hiding known file extensions. In My Computer go to
Tools &gt; Folder Options &gt; View and make sure 'Hide extensions for known
file types' is unchecked.

Hi Lisa,

There is a chance that your MSYS shell does not have
the current directory in its path. What happens if you try:

g95 ./test.f90

where ./ indicates that test.f90 is located in the current directory.

Arjan

Thanks to you both.  I decided to change the file name to hello.f90 as
I thought maybe &quot;test&quot; was unsuitable.  Weirdly, it worked yesterday,
but not today.  I am definitely in the right directory and have double
checked using the ls command that msys can physically see the file,
which it can.  However, the file name does have .txt after it - is
this the problem?  If so, how can I sort this out?   Alternatively, I
think maybe Arjan is correct in that msys does not have the current
directory in its path.  This seems quite likely given the error
messages.  Any advice on how to rectify this greatly appreciated.

Thanks again,

Lisa

Hi!

Not having the current directory in your path is not a problem.
I even prefer to have it this way, to make sure that I always know
which version of a progam or file is used. You can leave it like this.

Of course you can just rename your files. Either in Windows in the regular
way,
or in MSYS using the command

mv ./test.f90.txt test.f90

For the future, I can suggest to use an editor that has special
capabilities
for code development. On my Windows pc I use PSPad, which can be
freely downloaded from http://www.pspad.com/ . You have to play a bit with
the settings.

Regards,

Arjan

That's great, it's working fine now.  I'll take a look at that text
editor too as notepad really isn't very suitable!  Thanks again for
your help.  I just have to learn how to program now...:)

Hi Lisa,

Can you tell me why you have chosen to use Fortran?
Do you have a lot of Fortran code from other people to work with?
Or will you start writing your own codes from scratch?
Which types of problems do you intend to solve with Fortran?
The reason why I ask this is that Fortran programs are hard to debug.
They will ALWAYS give you an answer, but it is a tough job to find out
if the answer is really what you want... With the new g95 compiler you
can use much cleaner styles of coding. Nevertheless, it is still
very well possible to make fully functional spaghetti code with surprising
results.
In case you have no particular reason to chose Fortran, you may
consider using Pascal instead. You can get a single download (freeware
under gnu-license, so that's okay!) for Windows at:

ftp://freepascal.stack.nl/pub/fpc/dist/i386-win32-2.2.0/fpc-2.2.0.i38...

The major advantage of this bundle is the integration with a debugger.
To code in FreePascal, which is just regular Pascal, but with all the power
you may want in 2008, you start the IDE (Integrated Development
Environment)
that comes with the distribution. This is the icon that is placed on your
desktop.
This looks like an editor to work on your source files. But it is more:
It also handles all communication with the compiler for you. And the same
for
talking with the debugger (that comes with FreePascal). This means that you
can step through your program and monitor the values of variables
WHILE YOUR PROGRAM IS RUNNING! Errors are now easily located and
eliminated.
Also, the Pascal language does not allow for the dirty styles of coding
that will ruin your life
as a newbie in Fortran. And: the Freepascal IDE can show you examples
of all the syntax by pressing the F1-key while the cursor is on a keyword
in your code. This may be related to the fact that I have the original
Borland help-files on my pc, but that's for you to find out (or not).

Welcome to Fortran!

To the other g95-forum people: sorry for the seemingly disloyal posting
about Pascal
on a Fortran forum, but in this case I think it could be a good
alternative.

Regards,

Arjan

It would have been fine.

Perhaps it worked yesterday just after you renamed the file, thus
removing the .txt, but stopped working today because you touched it
with Notepad and the .txt was added again?

As long as you're using Notepad, I think you can prevent it from
adding .txt to the name by selecting 'All files' rather than 'Text
files' as the file type in the save-as dialogue box. Or something like
that. (As Arjan said, there are plenty of free alternatives to
Notepad. I use Emacs.)

My understanding is that you should _not_ put the current directory
into the path, for security reasons.

As for learning to programme, Fortran is of course the best language
to learn on :-) But if you're teaching yourself, it's a good idea to
get a book which talks about programming style, to avoid the spaghetti
code which Arjan warns about. (I like Chapman's Fortran 90/95 book.)
And always use IMPLICIT NONE but avoid GO TO.

Heresy!

I don't think debating the general merits of Fortran is on-topic for
this newsgroup, but I will say that Fortran 90 and later versions of
the language have added many features to make the language less error-
prone, such as IMPLICIT NONE, MODULEs, and INTENT.

I always compile with g95 using the options

-Wall -Wextra -Wimplicit-none -Werror=100,113,115,137,146,147,159,163 -
ftrace=full -fbounds-check -freal=nan -fmodule-private

and have found that it usually does not take me too long to catch my
errors. Here are what the warning numbers mean:

100 Unexpected end of format string in format string
102 MODULE PROCEDURE USEd is not referenced
112 Variable is set but never used
113 Variable is used but not set
115 Line is being truncated
137 Variable is never used and never set
146 Variable is set and never allocated
147 Variable is used and never allocated
157 Variable has the target attribute but is never pointed to
158 Intent(out) variable not set
159 PARAMETER is never used
163 Actual argument does not have an intent
167 PRIVATE module procedure is not invoked
