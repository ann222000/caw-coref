Medically speaking, my time in Thailand was boring. There were no
attacks, no casualties of the sort I'd seen in Vietnam. Since guys
weren't scared all the time, there was much less of the depression and
jitters amongst the troops. We did get an occasional cobra bite, which
could be exciting. The flying I did was also not as much fun: in Vietnam
I mostly flew with a squadron of spy planes, low and slow. There were
creepy guys in the back doing things I didn't have clearance to know
about; but the flying was uninteresting to the pilots, so they were glad
to turn the controls over to me. &quot;Roger, rollout one-five-zero,&quot; I'd
say, as I followed directions from the back. &quot;Roger, climb to flight
level eight thousand.&quot; Cool hardly describes what I was. Us pilots:
shit-hot as we liked to say. In Thailand, I flew on tankers. Converted
Boeing 707s, flying gas tanks, militarily known as a KC-135. I did
occasionally get to fly the things, but they were more complicated than
the old Gooney Birds of Danang, and I was just kidding myself. Aware of
the potential consequences of a gas tank with wings meeting a missile
with fangs, I tried to sign on to missions well into the south. Wrong
information got me all the way to Haiphong harbor by Hanoi once, and
when I heard the copilot call out &quot;Bandits approaching 6 O'clock,&quot; I
reached for my survival vest. (That's a story in itself: it contained
such things as a hacksaw in a rubber casing, for insertion into one's
rectum. It had a beautiful silk cloth with an American flag and a
paragraph in sixteen local languages, saying &quot;I am an American citizen.
Misfortune has befallen me. [&quot;misfortune.&quot; &quot;befallen.&quot; Who wrote that
stuff?] My government will reward you if you take me to safety.&quot; A
six-shot .38 pistol was included. Those hot shot pilots, they added a
bandoleer containing a couple hundred rounds. Me, I figured if I went
down, I'd only need one.)

Once, I got to control the fuel nozzle. From the back of the plane
protrudes a long maneuverable hose. It has little wings on it, and by
manipulating controls you can make it move up, down, left, right. Lying
on your belly, facing backwards and looking out a small window, wearing
headphones so you knew when to expect them, your eyes would pop as a
group of F-4 fighter planes would swing into view, in formation, just
yards from the back of the tanker. One by one they'd fly into position,
close enough that you could easily see the pilot, like he was across the
dinner table from you. And you'd manipulate the nozzle -- sort of a team
effort: you'd move it around a bit as the fighter jock nudged his way
into it, and the nozzle would find its way into a receptacle on the nose
of the plane. Then we'd fly together like dragonflies do, while I
transferred fuel to the fighter. The one time I did it, the pilot smiled
at me (nice blue eyes) and held up a photograph. It showed a particular
sex act that one might associate with the feat we'd just accomplished.
Prodigious equipment.

Which gets me to the meat, as it were, of the post. Routine in most
ways, my medical experience in Thailand was an occasional lesson in
tropical medicine; in particular, venereal diseases of which I'd only
heard most vaguely in medical school: syphillis, lymphogranuloma
venereum, chancroid, and, of course the clap (gonorrhea.) We did see
some malaria and plague. But today we're talking crotch. And hygiene, or
the lack thereof.

&quot;Hey doc, you treated me a month ago for the clap, and now it's back,&quot;
he said. &quot;So what do you have,&quot; I asked the airman, &quot;the drip, or the
burning, or what?&quot; (Those of you who read my book have heard this one.)
&quot;The drip,&quot; he says. &quot;OK, let's have a look.&quot; So he drops his pants to
reveal a green stain of pus on his underwear, the size of a salad plate.
&quot;Wow,&quot; I say. &quot;That's some drip!&quot; &quot;Yeah,&quot; he grin/grimaces. &quot;And that's
just since Thursday.&quot; It was Tuesday.

&quot;Congratulations. You've got the clap,&quot; I tell another. &quot;Why the hell
don't you guys wear a rubber like I warned you?&quot; I ask. (I'd descended
into lecturing all newcomers about VD.) &quot;I did, Doc. I really did.&quot; &quot;Did
you use it every time?&quot; I ask. &quot;Damn right, doc. Second time I just
turned it inside out and used it again.&quot; And of course, every day ad
nauseum I heard, &quot;Shit doc, you wouldn't take a shower with a raincoat
on, would ya?&quot; There was a persisting rumor about &quot;The Black Clap,&quot; a
variety so virulent and so resistant to treatment that anyone who got it
was spirited away to an island off the coast, never to be heard of
again. &quot;Is it true, doc?&quot; &quot;Nah,&quot; I'd say. &quot;I've been to the island, and
you got nothing to worry about.&quot;

For some reason, it fell to the Flight Surgeon's office to control the
spread of VD; that included, among other things, making inspections of
all the bars and their &quot;staff.&quot; Once a week we'd make the rounds, nurses
doing pelvic exams and testing for gonorrhea. To whom that ever made
sense I was never made aware. I was not among them. We were, of course,
offered various incentives to certify the ladies. Despite our efforts --
pathetic as they were -- the attack rate for the GIs who partook was
around 90% if they didn't use condoms, and still above 30% if they did:
not surprising, given the above examples... So I did a little experiment
with my staff of medics, who were not inclined toward abstinence. I gave
them little tubes of neomycin ointment. &quot;You didn't hear it from me,&quot; I
said as I passed the little saviors out. &quot;But you might want to see what
happens if you take a leak and then squirt some of this up your urethra
right after sex.&quot; &quot;Doc, you're a genius,&quot; I heard more than once. In
around seventy-five &quot;exposures,&quot; there wasn't a single case of the clap.
Of course I was loathe to write it up, and never did. And, in
retrospect, I was damn lucky none got a contact reaction to the stuff:
such things are not unheard of, and in the urethra, one can only imagine
what might happen. So don't try it yourself, and don't tell anyone what
I did.
