A new cage would be first on my list. I would give the bird some aloe
detox to help get the anesthesia out of his system. Make sure he is
well hydrated. Birds replace lost blood much faster than humans.
Brewer's yeast, (not baker's yeast) from the health food store, has
natural B vitamins and will help build up his reserve.

&gt; I talked to the vet and he is doing better and has a bit of food in
&gt; him now, so it sounds like the worst danger is over.  I'm going to
&gt; need to rethink a few things like his daytime cage (large open design
&gt; with 'sprial' arrangement of perches) and portable perches.  I'm
&gt; having a hard time finding information on caring for birds with one
&gt; leg.  I'm not even sure if he will want to perch anymore.  If anyone
&gt; has any tips or advice I would really appreciate it.  I'm going to
&gt; pick him up today at 3 -- I can't wait.

The Gabriel Foundation has much experience with special needs birds.
You could call them for advice.

So sorry to hear about Verdi.  I really hope he pulls through this
horrible trauma.  Even if amputation is necessary, many birds manage to
live quite well with one leg.  This also applies to cats and dogs who
lose limbs.  Animals are much better at adapting to handicaps than
humans.

If Verdi makes it -- and I pray he does -- you will have to adapt his
cage to his disability to make climbing and perching much easier for
him.  That may involve moving perches lower to the bottom of the cage,
putting flat shelf-type perches for him to sit on comfortably, lining
the cage bottom with snag-free fabric so that he can grip easier (as
opposed to newspaper which is &quot;slippery&quot;), as well as making his food
and water bowls easier for him to reach without struggling.

What you can do is Google &quot;handicapped birds&quot;, &quot;special needs birds&quot;
and/or &quot;birds with disabilities&quot;.  The sites should give you lots of
practical and helpful information in helping Verdi get used to his new
life.  I'm keeping both of you in my thoughts as you go through this
together.

&gt; Thanks for the reply.  Can you elaborate on these shelf-type perches?
&gt; I'm afraid I'm not sure what you mean.

I'll try to find some websites that will explain (hopefully with photos)
what I mean.  By the way, how is your bird doing?  Is he still at the
vet or is he home with you?  How's the little guy?

&gt; He is home with me now.  He eat some food and drank some water from
&gt; the faucet (and pooped on me) so that is good.  He's really having
&gt; trouble with the collar they put on him.  He just stumbles around on
&gt; the towel in the bottom of his cage.  I can't tell if it's just him
&gt; trying to get out of it or his new inability to walk or a little of
&gt; both.  It's gut wrenching to watch.  I know I wasn't supposed to do
&gt; it, but I briefly took it off so he could cuddle on my shoulder and
&gt; sleep a while, which he did.  When he woke he started preening and got
&gt; a bit too close to the stump so I put the collar back on.  He was so
&gt; happy and peaceful on my shoulder making his happy sounds and now he
&gt; is pissed and has his head buried in the towel in his cage chewing on
&gt; it.  It's going to be really hard keeping him in it for 2 weeks but I
&gt; guess I have no  choice.  :-(

It's good to hear that Verdi is eating and drinking ... that's a sign
that he's feeling a bit more chipper.  It's important to keep the
E-collar on him as much as you can to prevent him from picking at his
stump and causing it to bleed and/or become infected.  Taking the
E-collar off for a bit is okay to reduce his stress level, but until the
stump heals over properly, you'll have to leave it on for as long as
possible.  What does your vet say?  Is your bird on antibiotics?

As I mentioned, the cage will have to be modified so that Verdi will
have as normal a life as before.  Also, have you checked the section of
the cage where your bird's leg was caught?  If the cage is in poor
condition (broken bars, sharp edges, etc.), you should seriously
consider buying a brand-new cage.

Here are some sites that might be helpful to you:

www.avianweb.com/specialabledbirds.htm
www.avianweb.com/Kula.htm
www.finchworld.com/handicapped.html
mikeoso.homestead.com/handicap.html
www.parrotchronicles.com/marchapril2004/disabled2.htm

By using a search engine such as Google, you can type in &quot;disabled
birds&quot;, &quot;handicapped birds&quot;, &quot;splayed legs birds&quot;.  A number of websites
will pop up which you should investigate for tips/ideas/recommendations
from people who own handicapped birds.  When my celestial parrotlet,
Jellybean, was born with a spayed leg in summer 2003 I was able to find
a fair amount of information on how to accommodate her disability
allowing her to live comfortably in her cage and to get around easily.

I hope Verdi is on his way to a quick recovery and wish both of you the
very best.

&gt; One thing I'm frustrated with is finding specific products for Verdi.
&gt; Mostly I just read about success stories with handicapped birds -- it
&gt; would be nice if they recommended certain perches or cages, or showed
&gt; in detail how they constructed ramps, etc.  I feel like I don't know
&gt; what I'm doing.  If you know of any specific handicapped bird products
&gt; that I could purchase I would appreciate that as well.

Andy, over the next day or so I'll try to find some bird products for
handicapped birds on the Web.  If I see anything that I feel might be
helpful to Verdi, I'll post it.  From what you've written, it sounds
like Verdi is on his way to making a full recovery, which is wonderful
news.  I hope as each day passes, your little guy will become stronger.
