Hey!

I will be in the Provo-Orem area next week and am an avid boardgamer.
I like most anything and am always willing to learn a new game. So if
anyone has just gotten something new and can't find anyone to try it
out with or if there is a planned gaming group and you need another
player--- I'm your man.

This trip is purely vacation so my schedule is really flexible.
Twilight Imperium 3 is a favorite of mine so I am always up for that
as long as those of you not on vacation can make it work. I am
bringing some of my games with me because we have a family reunion the
following week and as I'm sure most of you can relate to...I'm the
game guy in the family.  So I will be bringing some of my favorites
and I am open to suggestions. Go to my profile on BGG (roliander) and
look at my collection and if I have something anyone has been wanting
to try before buying I would be happy to make room for it in the car.

Thanks. And hope to beat..uh... I mean meet some of you next week. ;)

regards,

Roland

Welcome!  I would try to set up a game but I'm on vacation in Portland,
Oregon right now, and headed to Newport tomorrow morning to camp in a yurt.
Ran and Ed often have pickup games and may contact you!

Hi Roland,

Glad you found your way to our google group.  As I mentioned to you
previously, my son Ben and I are eager to play Twilight Imperium 3.
I don't know if anyone else in this group has played it or has any
desire to play it but if we could get a good sized group (5 or 6
players) together I would like to give it a try.  Being a big fan of
18xx games, I am not afraid to tackle a 6 hour game every so often.
Friday night would be best for a game that long but we could try
another night if necessary.  I think we can provide the games so you
wouldn't need to pack them.

Other games that you have highly rated, that I enjoy include:
Caylus
Princes of Florence
Leonardo da Vinci
Die Macher
Notre Dame
Shogun/Wallenstien
Tichu
Power Grid
Goa
Medici

Here are some of my games I didn't see on your list that you may want to try:
Age of Empires III
Age of Steam
Railroad Tycoon
Giganten
Hacienda
Crokinole
Nexus Ops
Lost Valley

Other members of the group own these games:
Yspahan
Fury of Dracula
Pillars of the Earth
Imperial

Let us know what times work best for you.   What is your game playing
budget in terms of how many hours you have available?  Do other
members of your family plan on playing as well?

Thanks,
Mark Tyler

As I said, my time is probably the most flexible. Any of the nights
will work great for me. My wife is really cool about it (although she
thinks that me contacting people in Provo to get a gamenight organized
while I am there is the ultimate in geekiness!). As long as I can tell
her the evening that I will be playing and make sure to do all the
stuff she wants to do on the other evenings there is no problem.
Friday night sounds great but any other night that I am there will
also work.

Any of those games mentioned would be awesome. Notre Dame is my most
recent purchase and I've only played it a few times so far. Die Macher
is such an awesome game but one rarely pulled out so that would be
sweet. Same goes for Twilight Imperium. I would love to learn any of
the games you mentioned that I don't have--in particular Age of Empire
3 or Imperial (I played Antike once and thought it was meh.. but heard
Imperial was much better). I have always wanted to learn Age of Steam
and have just been waiting for at least one of the planned versions to
be published.... But whatever we do, I MUST try Crokinole. I have
always been curious about the game (just not $150 curious).

Thanks for going to the effort of putting something together (even
though I know we all look for the tiniest excuse to do a gamenight--no
arm-twisting needed). I'm just glad that I can be the cool mysterious
stranger thats making it happen-- until you actually meet me at which
point I'll simply be the mysterious stranger.

regards,

Roland

Roland, this is a very nice list of games to work with:

Notre Dame
Die Macher
Twilight Imperium III
Age of Empire III
Imperial
Age of Steam
Crokinole

I would be happy playing any one of them.  I own all of the above
games except Imperial.  We would have to recruit Ken if we were going
to play that one.

The list of players, so far, looks like this:
Roland
Ran
Casey
Mark T.
Ben (if we play TI:3)

Looks like we have room for one or two more players depending on what
game(s) we pick.  Of course we could get a second table going if there
is enough demand.

I am available any of those evenings, the 25-27, next week.   We
should probably pick a date and go with it.  If anyone has a strong
preference on which of the above games to play and what day to play,
now is the time to say.  Roland wants to try Crokinole which is a bit
a bugger to haul around, so if we meet at my house that would probably
work best.

Thanks,
Mark

Also for anyone's interest, my list of games include (though mostly
Ameritrash/adventure stuff):

Arkham Horror
Prophecy
Descent
Battlelore
Robo Rally
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
Reef Encounter (unopened, haven't ever played it yet actually)
Primordial Soup
Wings of War: Famous Aces

I'd play anything, although I have been interested in trying out TI:3 for a
while now.

Time to finalize our plans for gaming this week with Roland.  Sounds
like we have enough interest in Twilight Imperium III to make that
work.

So far we have Ran, Casey, Roland, Ben, and me which leaves room for
one more player if anyone is interested.  Let me know right away.

We can go for either Wednesday or Friday.  Even though I initially
thought Friday would be best, I am actually thinking Wednesday has
some benefits as well.  Unless Wednesday doesn't work for Ran or
Casey, let's plan on Wednesday.  How early can you guys start?  I am
thinking about 6pm.

&gt; &gt; Notre Dame
&gt; &gt; Die Macher
&gt; &gt; Twilight Imperium III
&gt; &gt; Age of Empire III
&gt; &gt; Imperial
&gt; &gt; Age of Steam
&gt; &gt; Crokinole

&gt; &gt; I would be happy playing any one of them.  I own all of the above
&gt; &gt; games except Imperial.  We would have to recruit Ken if we were going
&gt; &gt; to play that one.

&gt; &gt; The list of players, so far, looks like this:
&gt; &gt; Roland
&gt; &gt; Ran
&gt; &gt; Casey
&gt; &gt; Mark T.
&gt; &gt; Ben (if we play TI:3)

&gt; &gt; Looks like we have room for one or two more players depending on what
&gt; &gt; game(s) we pick.  Of course we could get a second table going if there
&gt; &gt; is enough demand.

&gt; &gt; I am available any of those evenings, the 25-27, next week.   We
&gt; &gt; should probably pick a date and go with it.  If anyone has a strong
&gt; &gt; preference on which of the above games to play and what day to play,
&gt; &gt; now is the time to say.  Roland wants to try Crokinole which is a bit
&gt; &gt; a bugger to haul around, so if we meet at my house that would probably
&gt; &gt; work best.

&gt; &gt; Thanks,

&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff she wants to do on the other evenings there is no problem.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Friday night sounds great but any other night that I am there will
&gt; &gt; &gt; also work.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Any of those games mentioned would be awesome. Notre Dame is my most
&gt; &gt; &gt; recent purchase and I've only played it a few times so far. Die Macher
&gt; &gt; &gt; is such an awesome game but one rarely pulled out so that would be
&gt; &gt; &gt; sweet. Same goes for Twilight Imperium. I would love to learn any of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the games you mentioned that I don't have--in particular Age of Empire
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3 or Imperial (I played Antike once and thought it was meh.. but heard
&gt; &gt; &gt; Imperial was much better). I have always wanted to learn Age of Steam
&gt; &gt; &gt; and have just been waiting for at least one of the planned versions to
&gt; &gt; &gt; be published.... But whatever we do, I MUST try Crokinole. I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; always been curious about the game (just not $150 curious).

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for going to the effort of putting something together (even
&gt; &gt; &gt; though I know we all look for the tiniest excuse to do a gamenight--no
&gt; &gt; &gt; arm-twisting needed). I'm just glad that I can be the cool mysterious
&gt; &gt; &gt; stranger thats making it happen-- until you actually meet me at which
&gt; &gt; &gt; point I'll simply be the mysterious stranger.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Roland,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Glad you found your way to our google group.  As I mentioned to you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previously, my son Ben and I are eager to play Twilight Imperium 3.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know if anyone else in this group has played it or has any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire to play it but if we could get a good sized group (5 or 6
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; players) together I would like to give it a try.  Being a big fan of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 18xx games, I am not afraid to tackle a 6 hour game every so often.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Friday night would be best for a game that long but we could try
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; another night if necessary.  I think we can provide the games so you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn't need to pack them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Other games that you have highly rated, that I enjoy include:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Caylus
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Princes of Florence
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Leonardo da Vinci
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Die Macher
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Notre Dame
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shogun/Wallenstien
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tichu
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Power Grid
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Goa
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Medici

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here are some of my games I didn't see on your list that you may want
&gt; to try:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Age of Empires III
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Age of Steam
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Railroad Tycoon
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Giganten
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hacienda
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Crokinole
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nexus Ops
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lost Valley

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Other members of the group own these games:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yspahan
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fury of Dracula
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pillars of the Earth
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Imperial

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let us know what times work best for you.   What is your game playing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; budget in terms of how many hours you have available?  Do other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; members of your family plan on playing as well?

Wednesday is fine for me. I generally leave work between 5-6, it kind of
depends on my workload. But I work in Provo, so it's not like I'm commuting
somewhere.

OK, let's plan on Wednesday at 6pm.  We will just play some Crokinole
until all players arrive for TI:3.

My address is 1724 N. 120 W.  Orem.

Here are directions to my home:

From I-15 Northbound take the #273 Lindon 1600 N exit and then go east
on 1600 N. past State Street (stay in the right lane or you may end up
turning at 400 E. unexpectedly).
Turn left (north) on 200 W.   Go past the church, turn right on 1720
N. and my home is the reddish brick house at the end of the street.

If you have any last minute questions call my cell at 592-2277.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while I am there is the ultimate in geekiness!). As long as I can
&gt; tell
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her the evening that I will be playing and make sure to do all the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff she wants to do on the other evenings there is no problem.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Friday night sounds great but any other night that I am there will
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also work.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any of those games mentioned would be awesome. Notre Dame is my most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recent purchase and I've only played it a few times so far. Die
&gt; Macher
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is such an awesome game but one rarely pulled out so that would be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweet. Same goes for Twilight Imperium. I would love to learn any of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the games you mentioned that I don't have--in particular Age of
&gt; Empire
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3 or Imperial (I played Antike once and thought it was meh.. but
&gt; heard
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Imperial was much better). I have always wanted to learn Age of
&gt; Steam
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and have just been waiting for at least one of the planned versions
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be published.... But whatever we do, I MUST try Crokinole. I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always been curious about the game (just not $150 curious).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for going to the effort of putting something together (even
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though I know we all look for the tiniest excuse to do a
&gt; gamenight--no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arm-twisting needed). I'm just glad that I can be the cool
&gt; mysterious
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stranger thats making it happen-- until you actually meet me at
&gt; which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point I'll simply be the mysterious stranger.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regards,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Roland,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Glad you found your way to our google group.  As I mentioned to
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previously, my son Ben and I are eager to play Twilight Imperium
&gt; 3.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know if anyone else in this group has played it or has any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire to play it but if we could get a good sized group (5 or 6
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; players) together I would like to give it a try.  Being a big fan
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 18xx games, I am not afraid to tackle a 6 hour game every so
&gt; often.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Friday night would be best for a game that long but we could try
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; another night if necessary.  I think we can provide the games so
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn't need to pack them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Other games that you have highly rated, that I enjoy include:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Caylus
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Princes of Florence
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Leonardo da Vinci
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Die Macher
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Notre Dame
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shogun/Wallenstien
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tichu
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Power Grid
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Goa
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Medici

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here are some of my games I didn't see on your list that you may
&gt; want
&gt; &gt; &gt; to try:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Age of Empires III
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Age of Steam
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Railroad Tycoon
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Giganten
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hacienda
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Crokinole
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nexus Ops
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lost Valley

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Other members of the group own these games:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yspahan
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fury of Dracula
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pillars of the Earth
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Imperial

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let us know what times work best for you.   What is your game
&gt; playing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; budget in terms of how many hours you have available?  Do other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; members of your family plan on playing as well?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will be in the Provo-Orem area next week and am an avid
&gt; &gt; &gt; boardgamer.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I like most anything and am always willing to learn a new game.
&gt; So
&gt; &gt; &gt; if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyone has just gotten something new and can't find anyone to
&gt; try it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out with or if there is a planned gaming group and you need
&gt; another
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; player--- I'm your man.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This trip is purely vacation so my schedule is really flexible.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Twilight Imperium 3 is a favorite of mine so I am always up for
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as long as those of you not on vacation can make it work. I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bringing some of my games with me because we have a family
&gt; reunion
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; following week and as I'm sure most of you can relate to...I'm
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; game guy in the family.  So I will be bringing some of my
&gt; favorites
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I am open to suggestions. Go to my profile on BGG
&gt; (roliander)
&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at my collection and if I have something anyone has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; wanting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to try before buying I would be happy to make room for it in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; car.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks. And hope to beat..uh... I mean meet some of you next
&gt; week.
&gt; &gt; &gt; ;)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regards,
