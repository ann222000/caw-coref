But when it comes to how to plumb a system or what materials to
use, there is nothing--at least nothing specific to sanitaion. There
is
a standard advising vented loops in all hoses connected to
below-waterline thru-hulls and advice to keep all seacocks closed
except
when in use, but that's it. When it comes to what hoses and tank
materials and how to plumb 'em, there's only collective wisdom.

Then, is the collective wisdom that the PVC hose should not be used?
The reason I ask is because the PVC hose seems very solid--even more
so than the rubber hose I took out.  The potential problem I saw is
that the PVC cuts rather easily and because of this might be more
vulnerable to accidental damage that could allow sea water into the
boat if one forgot to close the seacock.

Thanks for your very cogent and succinct answer.  Peggy, you are the
guardian angel of marine sanitation.

No. In fact, SeaLand's ultra-pricy OdorSafe is flexible PVC. Otoh,
Trident Rubber's equally pricy 101/102 is double-walled rubber.

There's flex PVC that is rated for sanitation and flex PVC that
isn't...as people who try to save money by buying the hot tub hose from
Home Depot that sells for $2/ft or less quickly discover.

However, I wouldn't worry too much about accidental damage...overheating
to make it bend tighter than it wants to bend willingly or to get it
onto a fitting is about the only way to damage any hose without actually
working at it. The only real issue is resistance to odor
permeation...and although no hose is bullet proof forever, the more
expensive ones remain the most resistant the longest...at least in
theory. I had white schedule 148 flex PVC--which IS sanitation hose, but
not one of the pricy ones--on one of my own boats for more than 7 years
without a trace of odor...used it--same how, even same brand--on the
project boat I bought and it permeated in less than 90 days. SeaLand
OdorSafe is warranted against odor permeation for 5 years...I've seen it
fail in less than a year too.

All PVC, hard and soft is a "schedule something"...sched. 40, sched. 80
etc hard PVC. 148 is the white flex PVC rated for potable water and
sanitation that's been around for a couple of decades.
