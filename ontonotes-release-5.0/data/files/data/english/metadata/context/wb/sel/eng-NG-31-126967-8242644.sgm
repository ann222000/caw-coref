Can anyone tell me why my Wii remote cursor is less responsive on my
LVM-42w2 than it is on older CRTs that I've used the Wii on? Is it a
signal processing issue? Anyone else experiencing this?

Assuming this is not a major delay, but merely a subtle delay,
I'd say that you're not sending it a 1920x1080p video image.

Right, the Wii only outputs at 480p. (or 480i, I think) Is there any
way around this or do I have to suck it up and live with the delay?

I can not imagine any way around it.  The LVM42 has to devote a
certain amount of effort/time to scaling the 480 image to 1080,
which probably results in a lag of more than one frame.  Even if
the scaling were undertaken by the Wii, there'd be a similar lag
between your use of the manual control and its response on the
screen.  I'm guessing that the only way you'd get perfect
response on the screen is with a &quot;game console&quot; that is 1080
native and fast enough to support user interaction.

I'm using AMD dual core processors to drive the W-LVM42 thru ATI
x1300 pros at native 1080.  There is no lag between
action/feedback.  Of course this perception might be tempered by
the difference in our ages;-0)
