PILLSBURY DOUGHBOY DEAD AT 71

&lt;&lt;Veteran Pillsbury spokesman Pop N. Fresh died yesterday of a severe
yeast infection. He was 71. Fresh was buried in one of the largest
funeral ceremonies in recent years. Dozens of celebrities turned out
including Mrs. Butterworth, the California Raisins, Hungry Jack, Betty
Crocker and the Hostess Twinkies. The graveside was piled high with
flours, as long time friend Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy, describing
Fresh as the man whom &quot;never knew how much he was kneaded.&quot;

Fresh rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with many
turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting most
of his dough on half-baked schemes. Still, even as a crusty old man,
he was a roll model for millions. Fresh is survived by his second
wife -- they have two children and one in the oven.
The funeral was held at 4:25 for about 20 minutes.&gt;&gt;

Waldo, 36, Presumed Dead

Waldo, 36, is missing and presumed dead. &quot;We Gave up looking for him
years ago.&quot; Said a spokesman for a local search team. &quot;In the past
we'd scour the earth, buy every time we'd find him he'd take off again.
Finally, we put his picture on a milk carton and said the hell with it.&quot;
Other reactions were mixed.&quot; It was a case of sibling rivalry,&quot; said
Carmen Sandiego a half-sister. &quot;Waldo tried to outdo me by hiding in
shopping malls and outdoor rock concerts. These had no educational
value, so it's no wonder people stopped caring.&quot;&quot;The little deadbeat
owed us for 20,000 tasseled caps, said a spokesman for the Acme Headgear
Co. &quot;Now we're filing for bankruptcy, thanks to him.&quot; A memorial service
for Waldo will be held at 11 a.m. tomorrow at an unspecified location.
Those wishing to attend will have to find it for themselves. Waldo pages

Dilbert, 43, Found Dead in Cubicle

Dilbert D. Dilbert, 43, noted office underling, interfaced with death
today. Mortal downsizing was attributed to his suffocation,
cause by lack of ventilation in his windowless cubicle.

According to company spokesman, Dilbert was found slumped over his
mouse pad. His e-mail requests for assistance had been sent to several
colleagues, but the network server, like Dilbert, was down.

Dilbert's existence was not a high company priority,&quot; the spokesman
said, &quot;His departure, for which he had no authorization, will happily
have no effect on quarterly earnings. It will, however, cause us to
reevaluate his job performance rating.&quot;

Dilbert is survived by colleagues, Dogbert, Ratbert, and Catbert,
none of whom cared to make themselves available for comment.

According to Dilbert's wishes, he will be interred in a coffin with a
corner window. Mourners are asked to send memos in lieu of flowers.

Cathy, 44, A Suicide After Killing Mother

Cathy fatally shot her mother today, then turned her handgun on herself.
She was 44. According to her father, the shoot ings, climaxed several
hours of arguing and screaming, much of it centering on Cathy's failure
to marry and produce grandchildren. &quot;It was the endless nagging that
drove her over the edge,&quot; said her father. &quot;I problably could have pre
vented it, but being a gutless wimp, it would have been out of character
for me.&quot;

Cathy's string of failed romances were well-documented. After a rocky
relationship with Irving, she grew desperate and began search- ing for a
life partner in other strips. She moved in with Dilbert, but his caring
inexperience and lack of earning potential proved disas trous. Her final
attempt at a relationship was a short-lived liaison with Sylvia. Cathy
will be buried, some distance from her mother, in a bathing suit two
sizes too small.

&quot;Far Side&quot; Cow Dead At 18

In what is described as a mercy killing, the &quot;Far Side&quot; cow was put to
death today. The retired bovine, 18, was suffering from Mad Cow disease.
&quot;We could see it coming,&quot; and FDA spokesman said. &quot;Living in a surreal
world and possessing all those human traits had given her delusions of
grandeur. But after she was put out to pasture with normal cows, she
realized she was just one more dumb ungulate in the food chain. This
drove her berserk, foaming at the udder, so we had to put her to sleep.&quot;
No immediate family members survive. However, two distant cousins,
Elsie and Clarabelle, will serve as pallbearers at the funeral,
to be held at the local slaughterhouse.

Garfield 19
A Bloating Victim

A Bloating Victim Garfield the cat, 19, died yesterday of excessive
bloating. &quot;He couldn't control his eating,&quot; said his owner Jon Arbuckle.
&quot;In the past few months his weight ballooned to over 80 pounds. He'd
waddle a couple of steps or so, then collapse from the weight.&quot; An
autopsy performed today revealed that Garfield's stomach contained a
partly digested pizza, half a chocolate donut, the remains of a carp,
three Twinkies and several body parts identified as once belonging to
Odie the dog. Following the funeral, Arbuckle intends to reassemble
Garfield's corpse and permanently attach it to the rear window of his car.

Amazing Spider-Man, 71,
Dies in Nursing Home

The Amazing Spider-Man, 71, hanged himself in the Super Heroes Nursing
Home today, according to a report on the World wide Web.

&quot;We found him dangling from his own filaments, a spokesman said.
&quot;It was the prettiest noose you'd ever want to see.&quot;

Once a leading crime fighter, Spiderman had been suffering from severe
depression following the decline in popularity of his daily comic strip.
Though he tried to scale new heights, he never enjoyed the success of
his more &quot;Ever time he saw a Superman T-shirt of a Batman lunch box he'd
sink a little deeper,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;He hit bottom with news that
Arnold Schwarzenegger had signed for Batman IV.&quot;

It was planned that Spider-Man would be laid to best in the Super Heroes
Mausoleum, but due to his lack of merchandising success he will be
interred in the small-times annex.

Beetle Bailey, 66, Dies;
Was Army's Oldest Private

Beetle Bailey, the only Army enlisted man to serve 47 years
as a private, was pronounced dead today at 1400 hours.
However, exact time of death has yet to be determined.

&quot;I found him in his bunk unconscious, which for him was normal, said
Sgt. Orville Snorkel at Camp Swampy. &quot;I tried punching him awake, but
he wouldn't come around. I figured he was faking a coma to get out of
latrine duty. I got a little concerned when rigor mortis set in, but
I figured he was faking that too. He could have been dead for a week,
for all I know.&quot;

Bailey, who joined the Army in 1950, had a long history of service
related ailments. During the Korean War he complained of acute combat
fatigue, and during the Vietnam conflict, has often hospitalized for
post-traumatic stress. Following treatment for shell shock during
the invasion of Grenada, he spent six months on sick leave in 1990,
the result of Desert Storm syndrome.

These claims of illness remain open to question. According to
Pentagon records, Bailey spent his entire Army career at Camp Swampy.

Bailey qualified for promotion to PFC on 21 occasions.
Each time he refused concerned about the strain
and pressures of added responsibility.

Befitting his rank, funeral services will be private. To honor
Bailey's death, all Army posts will fly their flags at full mast.

Just out of curiosity, Art, was your post supposed to have had
anything to do with Shakespeare? Or was it merely another
