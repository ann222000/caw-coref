Today's question is being brought to you by our very own mystery poster :)

Do you have any fruit trees or berry bushes on your property? Which ones?

Right now just blackberries.  I've been thinking of a few real fruit
trees but my mom keeps telling me how difficult they are to keep up.  I
figure if bugs get 3/4 of the fruit, I'll still have 1/4 for myself.

I don't know if rotting fruit will attract more little bugs, or if it
will lure them away from the house?

A lemon tree. Just the other day a neighbor wanted to know if the tree was
&quot;plastic&quot;  ;)

I told him &quot;no&quot;, I just watered it alot and fertilized the soil. That's why
it had so many lemons and green leaves.
