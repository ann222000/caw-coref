My eye surgeon advised me not to lift anything heavy for at least two
weeks.  That's a tough challenge because a macho guy like me enjoys
hoisting tonage--especially when there are admiring women gathered.

This morning I mulled around chatting with the members and trying my
best to avoid having to disobey the doctor's orders.  Tomorrow I will
be in full work uniform, complete with name tag.  I really look great
in the Y gear because the shirts accentuate my broad and full
shoulders--as well as my well-developed pecs.

But, as much as I would like to demonstrate my prowess, I will
overcome the natural tendency to do so.  After all, I don't want to do
anything to dislodge this bionic lens that allows me to the truth
where others fail.
