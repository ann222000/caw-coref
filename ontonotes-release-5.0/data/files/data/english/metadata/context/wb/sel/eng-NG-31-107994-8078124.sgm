Hi, when racking my mead from primary to secondary i have a few
questions.
First, Is it a good idea to take a SG reading while the &quot;proto-mead&quot;
is still in the primary?
Second, Can you taste the &quot;Proto-mead&quot; to get an idea of what is going
on flavor-wise? Maybe get some ideas of where you want your batch to
go in conjunction with other flavors and so on.
thanks

Presuming your primary is a pail, just sanitize your hydrometer
and your hands, put the hydrometer in the primary, and read it.

You should do a starting gravity reading and then just let it go.
There's no reason test do another gravity reading after this until the
batch is done.

Tasting a young made will only result in the same response of, &quot;Gee,
this tastes like rocket fuel.&quot;

Mead takes patience.  If you don't have it, then you should be making
it.

For some, it comes naturally.  For others, it takes years of practice.
For me, it means brewing more than I consume.

Whoa!  If there's a difference between what I wrote and what Phil
wrote, it is a difference in how we interpreted your question.  Phil
and I have never been in disagreement (that I can recall).

Because of the yeast nutrient, I take three hydrometer reading - two
are the OG and the FG, the other is to ballpark when it is time to add
more yeast nutrient.

Phil's correct that you are likely to get a whiff and a taste of fusel
alcohol.

That's a typo in my part.  It should've read:  &quot;Mead takes patience.
If you don't have it, then you SHOULDN'T be making it.&quot;

I don't do gravity readings until the batch is clear and ready to
bottle.  If I did it each time I racked, I'd probably lose three to
four cups of mead with each batch.  Since I generally don't bottle
until it's a year old, I do a reading when I first make the batch, and
a year later.

I take a sample and record the gravity each time I rack the mead.
So at the minimum for me, that makes 3 -- original, rack to secondary,
bottling.  But I seem to do at least two rackings on most batches,
probably because of my ale based habit of racking to the secondary
when activity has slowed rather than when it has stopped.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I taste all of the samples (which are about 8 ounces), and all but
the original tend to be sipped and enjoyed over a relaxed span of
time.  It is my as yet unproven theory that I will learn to recognize
the flavor pattern and learn to predict (somewhat) where the flavor
is going.  That (again, I hope) will help me decide whether to oak,
how long, add honey, etc.

I don't find the young mead to taste like rocket fuel, though I am
tasting it with the expectation that it is young and not yet smoothly
blended in its flavors.

Clearly, every 10 mead makers will have at least 12 opinions on the matter.

The answer to both questions, IMO, is an unqualified
YES!  I think it's rarely a bad idea to have information
about how your mead (or other fermented beverage) is
developing.  Gaining that knowledge makes it easier to
deal with something perhaps starting to go wrong in
future batches.

Not necessarily.  Those of us who believe in controlling
fermentation generally don't ever have &quot;rocket fuel&quot; during
the process.

Harsh, and IMO unnecessary.  Again, controlled, cool,
fermentation can produce mead that is drinkable when
fairly young.  Also, patience is really only needed
until one has a few batches in the pipeline-- once that
happens finised mead will be coming along periodically
so any wait, however long or short, will be mitigated.

Yes, that's something I forgot about in my original
response.  When I make mead with fruit, the primary
fermentation is generally without fruit, and I rack
onto the fruit (cherries, usually), then at a later
date, rack again to get the mead off the fruit and
let particles settle out.  I not only like to taste
the mead straight (before fruit) to see if maybe I
want to hold some unfruited mead back, but to see if
something has gone terribly wrong and I'd just be wasting
the fruit.  Then before racking off the fruit, I want
to see if maybe I want more fruit flavor, in which
case I rack onto more fruit.

So I guess the overall moral of the story is to take
absolute answers in USENET newsgroups (or anywhere) with
a grain of salt-- there's rarely one fixed answer foir
all eventualities.

Exactly.
