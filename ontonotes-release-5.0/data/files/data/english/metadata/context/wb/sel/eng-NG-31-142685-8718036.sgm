L.A. official proposes fast-food ban for city

LOS ANGELES - A city councilwoman is proposing a moratorium on fast-food
restaurants in south Los Angeles, which has more such eateries than any
other part of the county.

The ordinance proposed by Councilwoman Jan Perry would stop new fast-food
restaurants from opening in the area for up to two years while the city
establishes a long-term plan to deal with the restaurants that have been
linked to health problems.

&quot;The people don't want them, but when they don't have any other options,
they may gravitate to what's there,&quot; Perry said in Monday's Los Angeles
Times.

The ordinance is a response to suspicions that obesity and related
illnesses - including high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease - are
connected to the high-fat foods that dominate fast-food restaurant menus.

An analysis by the Times found that south Los Angeles has the county's
highest concentration of fast-food restaurants.

The area also has higher rates of obesity than the rest of the county,
according to a county Department of Public Health study that found 30
percent of adults in south Los Angeles are obese, compared with 20.9 percent
in the county overall. For children, the obesity rate was 29 percent in
south Los Angeles, compared with 23.3 percent in the county.

The only positive is that maybe a lot of them will die off due to
heart attacks and diabetes complications.  Here is a typical fatass
Mexican anchor baby running around the USA:

Mexican parents (if the dad is not in jail) see the above kid as
&quot;healthy&quot;, a &quot;strong boy&quot;.  The rest of the world just sees a typical
fatass beaner.

That is the figure for South Central, which includes independent townships
like Downey, etc., that are predominantly Hispanic. The part of the City of
Los Angeles that was referred to is more Black than of any other ethnicity.

You will not find many Black Hispanics in LA, as the percentage of Caribbean
origin Hispanics is extremely low. Nearly all LA Hispanics are Mexican,
Mexican American, Guatemalan, Salvadoran or Honduran.

You are correct, sir.  Central and South Los Angeles are being
depopulated of Blacks, Whites and Asians.  Even Orange County is going
(many parts actually are already gone).  This is the pattern for ALL
of California if the ILLEGAL invasion is allowed to persist.  Arizona
and the rest of the Southwest would quickly follow, and within 25
years the rest of the United States of America would fall.
Thankfully, America appears to be waking up - but, it may not be in
time to save California from attempting to succeed from the USA by
around 2018 (join Mexico, go Independent?, stay a state? ... it could
become a situation similar in some ways to Puerto Rico, where there is
a three-way balance of opinion).  Things have simply been allowed to
go too far with ILLEGAL &quot;immigration&quot;... Controlled immigration is one
thing - but to allow a group of &quot;reconquistas&quot; to simply break in over
a poorly maintained border and take control is quite stupid... hear
that McCain, Bush, Feinstein, Boxer, Kennedy, and Pelosi - STUPID!
