*HOW IT ALL BEGAN*

Nearly four thousand years ago, in the Sumerian town ofUr in the valley of
the river Euphrates, lived a young man named Abraham. The people of Ur had
once worshipped Allah but as time passed they forgot the true religion and
started praying to idols, statues made of wood or clay and sometimes even of
precious stones.

Even as a small child Abraham could not understand how his people, and
especially his father, could make these images with their own hands, call
them gods, and then worship them. He had always refused to join his people
when they paid respect to these statues. Instead he would leave the town and
sit alone, thinking about the heavens and the world about him. He was sure
his people were doing wrong and so alone he searched for the right way.

One clear night as he sat staring at the sky he saw a beautiful shining
star, so beautiful that he cried out: 'This must be Allah!' He looked at it
in awe for some time, until suddenly it began to fade and then it
disappeared. He turned away in disappointment saying:

I love not things that set.  (Koran vi.77)

On another night Abraham was again looking at the sky and he saw the rising
moon, so big and bright that he felt he could almost touch it. He thought to
himself:
This is my Lord.  (Koran vi.78)

But it was not long before the moon set as well. Then he said,

Unless my Lord guide me, I surely shall become one of the folk who are
astray.  (Koran vi.78)

Abraham then saw the beauty and splendor of the sunrise and decided that the
sun must be the biggest and most powerful thing in the universe. But for the
third time he was wrong, for the sun set at the end of the day. It was then
that he realized that Allah is the Most Powerful, the Creator of the stars,
the moon, the sun, the earth and of all living things. Suddenly he felt
himself totally at peace, because he knew that he had found the Truth. When
he said unto his father and his folk:

What do you worship? They said: We worship idols, and are ever devoted to
them. He said: Do they hear you when you cry? Or do they benefit or harm
you? They said: Nay, but we found our fathers acting in this manner.   He
said: See now that which you worship, you and your forefathers! Lo! They are
(all) an enemy to me, except the Lord of the Worlds. Who created me, and He
guides me, And Who feeds me and waters me. And when I sicken, then He heals
me. And Who causes me to die, then gives me life (again) And Who, I ardently
hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of Judgment.  (Koran xxvi.70-82)

One day, while all the townspeople were out, Abraham angrily smashed all the
idols with his right hand except for one, which was very large. When the
people returned they were furious. They remembered the things Abraham had
said about the idols. They had him brought forth before everyone and
demanded, 'Is it you who did this to our gods, O Abraham?'  Abraham replied,
'But this their chief did it. Ask them, if they are able to speak '   The
people exclaimed, 'You know they do not speak.'  'Do you worship what you
yourselves have carved when Allah created you and what you make?'   Abraham
continued, 'Do you worship instead of Allah that which cannot profit you at
all, nor harm you?'   (Koran xxxvii.9S--6) (Koran xxi.66)

Finally, Abraham warned them,

Serve Allah, and keep your duty unto Him; that is better for you if you did
but know. You serve instead of Allah only idols, and you only invent a lie.
Lo! Those whom you serve instead of Allah own no provision for you. So seek
your provision from Allah, and serve Him, and give thanks unto Him, (for)
unto Him you will be brought back.  (Koran xxix. 16-17)

The people of Ur decided to give Abraham the worst punishment they could
find: he was to be burnt to death. On the chosen day all the people gathered
in' the centre of the city and even the King of Ur was there. Abraham was
then placed inside a special building filled with wood. The wood was lit.
Soon the fire became so strong that the people were pushed back by the
flames. But Allah said:

O fire, be coolness and peace for Abraham.  (Koran xxi.69)

The people waited until the fire had completely died down, and it was then
that they saw Abraham still sitting there as though nothing had happened! At
that moment they were utterly confused. They were not, however, moved by the
miracle that had just happened before their very eyes. Still Abraham tried
to persuade his own dear father, who was named Azar, not to worship
powerless, un-seeing, un-hearing statues. Abraham explained that special
knowledge had come to him and implored his father,  'So follow me and I will
lead you on the right path. O my father! Don't serve the Devil.'  But Azar
would not listen. He threatened his son with stoning if he continued to
reject the gods of Ur.  He ordered Abraham to leave the city with these
words: 'Depart from me a long while.'   Abraham said, 'Peace be upon you! I
shall ask my Lord's forgiveness for you. Surely He was ever gracious to
me.'   ( Koran xix.43-7)

Imagine how terrible it must have been for him to leave his home, his family
and all that he knew, and set out across the wilderness into the unknown.
But at the same time, how could he have remained among people who did not
believe in Allah and who worshipped statues? Abraham always had a sense that
Allah cared for him and he felt Allah near him as he traveled.

At last, after a long hard journey, he arrived at a place by the
Mediterranean Sea, not far from Egypt. There he married a noble woman by the
name of Sarah and settled in the land of Palestine.

Many years passed but Abraham and his wife were not blessed with any
children. In the hope that there would be a child, and in keeping with
tradition, Sarah suggested that Abraham should marry Hagar, her Egyptian
handmaid. Soon after this took place, Hagar had a little boy named Ishmael.

Some time later Allah promised Abraham another son, but this time the mother
of the child would be his first wife, Sarah. This second son would be called
lsaac. Allah also told Abraham that from his two sons-lshmael and lsaac-two
nations and three religions would be founded and because of this he must
take Hagar and lshmael away from Palestine to a new land. These events were
an important part of Allah's plan, for the descendants of lshmael would form
a nation from which would come a great Prophet, who would guide the people
in the way of Allah. This was to be Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah,
p.b.u.h.   From the descendants of Sarah's child, lsaac, would come Moses
and Jesus.

So it was that Abraham, Hagar, and lshmael left Palestine. They traveled for
many days until finally they reached the arid valley of Bacca (later to be
called Mecca), which was on one of the great caravan routes. There was no
water in the valley and although Hagar and lshmael only had a small supply
of water left, Abraham left them there knowing Allah would take care of
them.

Soon all the water was gone. The child began to grow weak from thirst. There
were two hills nearby, one called Safa and the other Marwah. Hagar went up
one hill and looked into the distance to see if she could find any water,
but found none. So she went to the other hill and did the same. She did this
seven times. Then sadly she returned to her son, and to her great surprise
and joy she found a spring of water bubbling out of the earth near him. This
spring, near which the mother and child settled, was later called Zamzam.
The area around it became a place of rest for the caravans traveling across
the desert and in time grew into the famous trading city of Mecca.

From time to time Abraham traveled from Palestine to visit his family and he
saw Ishmael grow into a strong young man. It was during one of these visits
that Allah commanded them to rebuild the Ka'bah-the very first place where
people had worshipped Allah.

They were told exactly where and how to build it. It was to be erected by
the well of Zamzam and built in the shape of a cube. In its eastern corner
was to be placed a black stone that had fallen to earth from heaven. An
angel brought the stone to them from the nearby hill of Abu Qubays.

Abraham and Ishmael worked hard to rebuild the Ka'bah and as they did so
they prayed to Allah to send a Prophet from among their descendants.

And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House,
(Abraham prayed): 'Our Lord! Receive this from us; Thou, only Thou, art the
All-hearing, the All-knowing; Our Lord! And make us submissive unto Thee and
of our seed a nation submissive unto Thee, and show us our ways of worship,
and turn toward us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Relenting, the Merciful.
Our Lord! And raise up in their midst a messenger from among them who shall
recite unto them Thy revelations, and shall instruct them in the Scripture
and in wisdom and shall make them grow. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty,
Wise.

(Koran ii. 127-9)

When the Ka'bah was completed, Allah commanded Abraham to call mankind to
pilgrimage to His Holy House. Abraham wondered how anyone could hear his
call. Allah said, 'You call and I will bring them.'   This was how the
pilgrimage to the Ka 'bah in Mecca was established and when Muslims make the
pilgrimage today they continue to answer the age-old call of Abraham.

*THE CHILDREN OF ISHMAEL*

OVER the years Ishmael's children themselves had children. His descendants
increased and formed tribes which spread out all over Arabia. One of these
tribes was called Quraysh. Its people never moved away from Mecca and always
lived near the Ka'bah.
