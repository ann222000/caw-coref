Return of Stolen Statues Could Signal Others Will
Follow

The return of 11 stolen African statues - one of which
was in Hampton University's possession- is an
indication that more will follow, predicts
anthropologist Monica L. Udvardy.

&quot;The case of these vigango statues has highlighted
this as an international crisis,&quot; said Udvardy, an
associate professor of anthropology at the University
of Kentucky who has studied the culture of the
Mijikenda, nine tribes along the Kenyan coast. &quot;It's a
trend that will continue.&quot;

Two statues were found by Udvardy, one at Hampton
University's museum and the other at the Illinois
State Museum. They were returned to their Kenyan
owners during a June 20 festival of celebration.

The remaining nine carvings, which were almost sold at
an art gallery, were given to Peter Ogego, Kenyan
ambassador to the United States.

Udvardy said some in Kenya consider the vigango simple
wood carvings, but others in that country view them as
the incarnation of the dead and memorials to them.
Each carving is called a kigango.

&quot;They are considered to be so in touch with the people
that you are to respect them wherever they are,&quot; she
said of the carvings. &quot;They are considered inalienable
property.&quot;

Udvardy said the publicity surrounding the return of
the vigango, is generating a large interest in
returning stolen art.

To prepare for and promote an end to such theft,
Udvardy is working alongside Kelly Gingras, owner of a
gallery in Connecticut that helped return the other
nine statues, and Charles Stith, former U.S.
ambassador to Tanzania and director of Boston
University's African Presidential Archives and
Research Center.

Gingras and Stith are working on developing a bill in
Congress to provide tax cuts to collectors who return
stolen art.

Gingras, owner of the Insiders/Outsiders Gallery in
Cornwall Bridge, Conn., said the three are seeing a
large amount of enthusiasm for such returns even
without incentives.

The FBI Art Crime Team estimates the loss in stolen
art at as much as $6 billion annually. Spokesmen for
the FBI and the international police organization
Interpol said it was difficult to be more specific
because not all cases are reported.

Nonetheless, collectors are becoming more aware of the
origin of their art and are willingly seeking methods
to return it to its original owners.

One collector asked for Gingras' aid in returning six
vigango in his collection after he read about their
importance.

For such people, Gingras said, passage of a bill would
be the icing on the cake.

Gingras said she could have no part in selling vigango
statues after concluding that nobody should own the
figures other than the Mijikenda. The owner of the
nine statues agreed with Gingras and wanted to return
the figures after displaying the carvings in the
gallery to call attention to art theft.

&quot;It's amazing,&quot; she said. &quot;This story is continuing.
More will be returned.&quot;

Gingras, Udvardy and Stith are trying to push museums
and collectors with large collections of vigango to
willingly return the statues - including Hampton
University.

Gingras said Hampton returned a statue because it was
the only one identified as belonging to a Kenyan
family, but the university has others, she said.
Hampton has more than 90 remaining in its collection.

Asked what institutions such as Hampton should do with
vigangos in their possession, she said, &quot;I think they
should return them because nobody owns them but the
Gohu people,&quot; referring to a semi-secret fraternal
society within the Mijikenda.

&quot;Nobody can buy them,&quot; she said. &quot;They should return
them - all of them.&quot; Each sculpture has its unique
style and pattern.

Yuri Rodgers Milligan, Hampton University's
spokeswoman, said the statues were loaned to the
university. They were obtained legitimately and
legally, and therefore remain university property, she
said.

The National Museum of Kenya requested in February
2006 that Hampton return the statue, and in September
the university decided to loan it permanently to the
Mwakiru family, said Milligan.

&quot;We hoped that it would bring closure to the family,&quot;
she said. &quot;That's why it was returned.&quot;

The blue and white kigango was carved as a memorial to
one of the deceased brothers of Kalume Mwakiru, who
owned the vigango.

Mwakiru searched for the two wooden figures he bought
for his deceased brothers but died before they were
returned in June.

Ambassador Ogego, who received the nine vigango
statues from Gingress in a U.N. ceremony, said Hampton
and Illinois State did the right thing.

The statues are priceless in Kenyan culture, he said.

&quot;The vigangos belong to particular communities in
Kenya,&quot; Ogego said. &quot;They are used as burial sticks
for relatives. You can't find them anywhere else.&quot;

The Kenyan government, Ogego said, is looking into
confronting theft in international black market
circles.

&quot;Locals are taking them because they are goods and
they are sold for nothing,&quot; he said. &quot;We as a
government are trying to solve this problem . . . not
just vigangos - all art.&quot;

Jonathan Reyman, a curator of anthropology at the
Illinois State Museum, said it did not take 10 minutes
for the museum to move forward with returning the
kigango in its possession.

&quot;We returned it because there was no question that
this particular kigango was stolen,&quot; he said. &quot;We
learned that and of course you return stolen
property.&quot;

The museum hosted a series of events designed to
expose the public to the international issue of the
black market in art theft.

&quot;Maybe this will finally generate enough publicity
that people will stop buying them,&quot; Reyman said.
&quot;Maybe if the market dries up, the theft of the
objects will stop. The market isn't in Kenya, the
market is in Europe and America [and] elsewhere.&quot;
