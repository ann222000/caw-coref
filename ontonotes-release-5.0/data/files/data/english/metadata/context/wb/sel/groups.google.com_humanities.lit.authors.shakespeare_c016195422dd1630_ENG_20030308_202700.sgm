I'm not responsible for any of the crankery of any Dartmouth faculty,

than that -- indeed, a former professor named Benezet was actually an
OXFORDIAN! You can't get much more eccentric than that!

This is why Kathman and Webb score so high, off the scale really, on
the dogmatism scale. They must actively defend any and all challenges
to accepted thinking, be it Oxford, how planes fly, or the origins of
oil. Any challenge to orthodox thinking in any field is a challenge to
their tightly wrapped personalities, that can only crack, not bend.
Conformity, acceptance, peer approval are the important virtues for
Kathman and Webb, not innovative thinking. This is equally true by the
way, for the academics in the Oxfordian ranks, Stritmatter, Wright,
etc.

Dave Kathman is NOT an academic. I do not know for certain, but to
my knowledge, he never has been, by a conscious choice on his part. Of
course, he is a very highly regarded scholar, a circumstance that
underscores emphatically that not all scholars are academics. Perhaps
Mr. Streitz is confusing the life of a scholar with that of an academic.

You don't know about the true origins of oil? I'm shocked! I thought
your knowledge of crankery was far superior to mine. ^_^

At a guess, Dire Streitz is riffing on either Velikovsky (earth's
petroleum fell from the sky during a close encounter with Venus) or
Thomas Gold (see  ).

Velikovsky shares an important trait with the anti-Shakespeareans: an
inability to read a text as anything other than a straightforward
documentary account of something that must have actually happened.
Velikovsky assumed that ancient myths described real events in much the
same way that Streitz assumes that Shakespeare's plays describe the
actual events of his life. Velikovsky and Streitz also share an abysmal
ignorance of the field in which they found their 'explanations'
(astronomy, in Velikovsky's case; history, in Streitz's).

Another common trait of Velikovsky and Streitz is an inability to pursue
their logic to its necessary conclusion. Velikovsky assumed the truth of
the book of Exodus only inasmuch as he could leave God out of it, just as
Streitz refuses to acknowledge that by his own logic, Oxford could only
have written Hamlet after he died. It is, I think, symptomatic of their
love-hate relationship with the scholars whom they affect to despise for
their close-mindedness but desperately wish to be validated by. Neither
of them would risk associating their work with the slightest whiff of the
supernatural, and I can only suppose their reluctance stems from a belief
that real scholars always reject the supernatural.

There was a theory posited some years back that the conventional theory
of the fossil origin of petroleum might be an incorrect generalization
from coal, that petroleum might instead be the natural result of the
processes involved in the formation of the Earth, and that it might
therefore be found in geologic contexts unexpected by current theory.
As far as I know, the hypothesis was _not_ generally rejected as
outright crankery (though many geologists naturally regarded it with
suspicion), but the complete failure over the intervening years to find
petroleum in these alternate contexts has pretty much led to it being
given up as a bad job.

I assume Streitz is referring to the abiogenic theory on
the origin of oil by Cornell astrophysicist Thomas Gold:
---------------------------------------------------------

My new book, &quot;The Deep Hot Biosphere,&quot; (Copernicus, An Imprint of
Springer-Verlag, New York, ISBN 0-387-98546-8) . . .discusses most of the
items listed below.

The basic idea that a large amount of microbial life exists in the pore
spaces of the rocks down to depths of between 6 and 10 kilometers arose in
the following way: natural petroleum almost always contains elevated levels
of the chemically inert gas helium and at the same time it contains
molecules that are unquestionably of biological origin. How these two
different substances meet up in oil has long been a puzzle. If there exists
microbial life, down to all levels that can be reached by the drill, then
the biological molecules can be explained. The association with helium can
then be explained adequetely if the hydrocarbons have come up from much
deeper levels and thereby swept up the diffusely distributed helium that
exists in the rocks.

The evidence that such a deep bioshpere exists has now been strongly
supported by microbiol studies in deep bore holes.

Drilling deep into the crystalline granite of Sweden between 1986 and 1993
revealed substantial amounts of natural gas and oil. 80 barrels of oil were
pumped up from a depth between 5.2 km and 6.7 km.

Russian petroleum geologists followed this operation closely. Dr. P.N.
Kropotkin reported at a meeting in Moscow that the discovery of oil deep in
the Baltic Shield may be considered a decisive factor in the hundred year
old debate about the biogenic or abiogenic origin of oil. This discovery was
made in deep wells that were drilled in the central part of the crystalline
Baltic Shield, on the initiative of T. Gold.

Drilling into crystalline bedrock is now underway in Russia on a large
scale. More than 300 wells have been drilled to a depth of more than 5 km
and are productive, as also is the giant White Tiger field offshore Vietnam,
mostly producing also from basement rock.

The organic origin of oil is not in doubt!! It derives from fossilized
organic matter, mostly of algal origin. Those who espouse the alternative,
inorganic hypotheses are usually humoured and thought of in the same way as
we do the anti-Strats.

&gt;&gt; The origins of oil? Is this a new Streitzian crankery, or an old one
&gt;&gt; of which I was unaware? Please tell us all about the origins of oil.
&gt; I assume Streitz is referring to the abiogenic theory on
&gt; the origin of oil by Cornell astrophysicist Thomas Gold:
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------
&gt; http://people.cornell.edu/pages/tg21/&gt;
&gt; My new book, &quot;The Deep Hot Biosphere,&quot; (Copernicus, An Imprint of
&gt; Springer-Verlag, New York, ISBN 0-387-98546-8) . . .discusses most of the
&gt; items listed below.

&gt; The basic idea that a large amount of microbial life exists in the pore
&gt; spaces of the rocks down to depths of between 6 and 10 kilometers arose in
&gt; the following way: natural petroleum almost always contains elevated levels
&gt; of the chemically inert gas helium and at the same time it contains
&gt; molecules that are unquestionably of biological origin. How these two
&gt; different substances meet up in oil has long been a puzzle. If there exists
&gt; microbial life, down to all levels that can be reached by the drill, then
&gt; the biological molecules can be explained. The association with helium can
&gt; then be explained adequetely if the hydrocarbons have come up from much
&gt; deeper levels and thereby swept up the diffusely distributed helium that
&gt; exists in the rocks.

&gt; The evidence that such a deep bioshpere exists has now been strongly
&gt; supported by microbiol studies in deep bore holes.

&gt; Drilling deep into the crystalline granite of Sweden between 1986 and 1993
&gt; revealed substantial amounts of natural gas and oil. 80 barrels of oil were
&gt; pumped up from a depth between 5.2 km and 6.7 km.

&gt; Russian petroleum geologists followed this operation closely. Dr. P.N.
&gt; Kropotkin reported at a meeting in Moscow that the discovery of oil deep in
&gt; the Baltic Shield may be considered a decisive factor in the hundred year
&gt; old debate about the biogenic or abiogenic origin of oil. This discovery was
&gt; made in deep wells that were drilled in the central part of the crystalline
&gt; Baltic Shield, on the initiative of T. Gold.

&gt; Drilling into crystalline bedrock is now underway in Russia on a large
&gt; scale. More than 300 wells have been drilled to a depth of more than 5 km
&gt; and are productive, as also is the giant White Tiger field offshore Vietnam,
&gt; mostly producing also from basement rock.

"/>

I assumed so too, but I am unwilling to prejudge the matter until Mr.
Streitz explains further. Mr. Streitz, being both a complete scientific
ignoramus and an all-purpose crank, is quite capable of coming up with
some suggestion FAR more eccentric than the abiogenic theory. Let's see
what Mr. Streitz has in mind rather than putting words in his mouth --
although anyone who has painfully waded through Mr. Streitz's abysmal
prose can be forgiven for harboring a wish to put words in his mouth.

That's one at the more plausible (if speculative) end of the spectrum

&gt; Velikovsky shares an important trait with the anti-Shakespeareans: an

I recall being asked by a particularly dim-witted person, after I had
explained to him that Pushkin's _Evgenii Onegin_ (which took Pushkin
nearly a decade to write) contains a pivotal duel that strangely
prefigures Pushkin's own fatal duel, whether the duel in _Onegin_ was
largely autobiographical! Perhaps Mr. Streitz has not thought through
your objection to his method carefully enough, and hence sees no
difficulty in Oxford's having written _Hamlet_ posthumously. After all,
if Mr. Streitz is right about Oxford's paternity, then Oxford must have
been conceived posthumously, so why could he not have written his
autobiographical drama posthumously as well? Perhaps posthumous
activity ran in his family.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It is, I think, symptomatic of their

Your point is well taken. But Ken Kaplan avers that John Edward

(Perhaps he does so in the same way that Art Neuendorffer talks to
George Mason.) What was even more amusing about Ken's post, though, was
that he misspelled &quot;charlatan&quot; as &quot;charleton.&quot; Perhaps it was a
Freudian slip -- perhaps Ken was thinking of CHARLTON Ogburn.

Was the [Hamilton/Burr] duel rigged?

&lt;&lt;At dawn on the 11th of July 1804 in the field of Weehawken near the
Hudson river in the state of New York Aaron Burr vice president of the
U.S. and general Alexander Hamilton ex head of treasury and close friend
of Washington face each other in the last act of a long running feud. At
seven o'clock two shots rang, Hamilton falls mortally wounded to the
stomach. While the hostility between Burr and Hamilton is well known,
the reasons are rather obscure. It seems it all started after the
creation of the Manhattan Co(formed by Burr, Hamilton, and John B.
Church, Hamilton's stepfather). The Manhattan Co., originally a water
supply entity, was turned, quite legally, by Burr into a bank! A severe
blow to Hamilton who was heavily involved in banking. Church having made
some very unflattering remarks as to Burr's honesty was called to answer
on the field of honor, and the pistols made their first appearance.

John Church had brought back from England a magnificent pair of Wogdon
dueling pistols. Beautifully crafted, well balanced, one oddity already
appears their caliber was .56&quot; while the accepted rules of dueling at
the time stipulated a maximum caliber of .50&quot;.

Burr lost a button, Church came out untouched, honor was satisfied.

The Hamilton, Burr, Church families seemed to be a rather trigger
happy lot! In 1802 Philip son of general Hamilton picked a quarrel with
a Mr. Eckhardt. The duel took place STRANGELY in the same field his
father was to die two years later. Uncle Church's pistols were again
used. Philip died of his wounds after having according to witnesses
fired in the air. The hatred between the pair reached a new high after
the election of Thomas Jefferson who took Burr as vice president.
Allegations were made, Hamilton had to put up or shut up, the pair of
Wogdon made it's third dramatic appearence.

The 13 of July 1804 an inquest on the death of Hamilton was opened.
After two weeks Burr was sentenced for premedited murder. The rest is
History.

Or is it? The US Historical society of Richmond, Va, in an effort to
raise money decided to have replicas made of the famous pair of pistols
held by the Chase Manhattan Bank. Merril Lindsay and Walther Agnoletto
when dismantling the originals made a strange discovery. The trigger
mechanism had been modified to enable to fire with a few grams pressure
on the trigger instead of the 5 to 6kg usual in weapons of this type.
The advantages to the user are obvious, speed and accuracy!

Why did'nt Hamilton use his own pistols? They had served him well
over the years. He must have known of the advantage gained in using the
Wogdon!

One of the witnesses mentionned that, as his son, Hamilton fired
in the air. Maybe the anticipation of finishing his hated rival
proved to much, a few grams of pressure on the trigger.........&gt;&gt;

After completing his duties as Vice President in 1805, Burr entered into
a conspiracy to wrest the lands west of the Mississippi River from
Spain.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Pushkin grew more and more in debt, from Natalia's balls, supporting
her two sisters, and undertaking his brother's debts. Finally he asked
to retire in the country, or a loan and permission to publish a journal.
Though a loan and permission to publish a journal was granted, the
journal, The Contemporary, was not financially successful. Natalia's
popularity grew more as well. She grew fond of a young French royalist,
Heeckeren. He pursued her as well. Their relationship growing into an
affair, Pushkin challenged Heeckeren to a duel but then declined. He
declined because of rumors that Heeckeren was really in love with
Natalia's sister. Unexpectedly Natalia's sister and Heeckeren wed in
1837. Though he was married to her sister, Heeckeren and Natalia still
met in secret. On November 4 Pushkin wrote Heeckeren a letter accusing
him of his &quot;bastard&quot; and challenging him to a duel. The duel occurred on
January 27, 1837. Heeckeren fired first and fatally injured Pushkin. Two
day later Pushkin died. Many sympathized and mourned his death. To avoid
public display the funeral was moved to a small church WITH ADMISSION
ONLY BY TICKET. Then later during midnight, SECRETLY, his corpse was
sent to his burial. On February 6, 1837 Alexander Pushkin was buried in
Svyatye Gory Monastery beside his mother.&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), fatally wounded in a duel by his
brother-in-law and rival, left a secret, ciphered journal, which was
recently discovered and smuggled out of the USSR. There has been a lot
of speculation and mystery surrounding this journal. According to
legend, Pushkin's will stipulated that the journal not be published
until 100 years after his death. The Journal does exist and consists of
explicit confessions about intimate relationships that Pushkin had with
his wife, her two sisters, and other women, which brought him to his
tragic end. These astonishing events and reflections reveal an unknown
details of Pushkin's life - the life of a 19th century Russian Don Juan.&gt;&gt;

(translated into English from Russian) 1987,

cannot avert it, for dishonor is more terrible than death. Dishonor is a
seed I planted. Its vines strangle me. Dantes became a retribution sent by
fate for my weak character. Challenging Dantes I become like Jacob fighting
God. If I triumph, I refute God's laws and Pussy will ascend the throne in

extent that I will allow to future generations. I have to take care of N.'s
honor and of the honor of my children as long as they are alive. But I
cannot help but to impart my soul to paper; it is this incurable disease of
writing. This disease is often fatal, for contemporaries will kill me for
these revelations of my soul, for true revelation, if they find out about
it. But future generations will not be able to do anything to me or to my
great-grandchildren, because remoteness in time will turn the most
blameworthy of deeds into mere history. Unlike to the present, history is
not dangerous or offensive, but merely amusing and didactic. I do not want
to take my sins, mistakes and torments to the grave with me; they are too
substantial not to become a part of my monument. In two hundred years or so,
when censorship in Russia will surely have been abolished, first Barkov (3)
will be published and then these notes, although I cannot imagine Russia
without censorship. It means that the notes will be published in Europe, but
more probably in far-away America. It is awful to know for certain that I
will no longer be alive then, and that even my bones would be putrefied. I
look at my hand as it writes these lines and try to visualize it dead, as a
piece of my skeleton, buried in the ground. Although this fate is
undeniable, I am unable to imagine it. The trustworthiness of death is the
only indisputable truth, and despite that it is the most difficult to
comprehend, whereas we can easily and thoughtlessly accept and believe many
different lies&gt;&gt;.

in a duel on January 27, 1837. Dantes left France and came to Russia in

I could not agree with you more. It is not a question of the origin of
an idea, or the divergence of an idea from conventional thought that
is important. What is important is the truth value of the idea. In
some cases, that can be proven by experiements, etc., in other cases
it is the preponderance of evidence. &quot;Did FDR lure the Japanese to
attack Pearl Harbor?&quot; is one of those preponderance of evidence
questions, that can never be proven in a scientific manner of
replicating experiments. Same is true with the Authorship issue.

My comment is related to the apriori judgement of many
Stratfordian/Oxfordians that an idea cannot be true, because it is so
extreme. Oxfordians for several years before my book was published
argued (without seeing the evidence) that it could not be true because
it was too extreme, and also, that it should not be revealed, even if
true, because it would be negative to the Oxfordian movement.
Academics are charged with teaching the &quot;established&quot; truth, not to
much about with it. How the established truth becomes established is
another matter.

&gt;&gt; It is, I think, symptomatic of their love-hate relationship with the

&gt; Your point is well taken. But Ken Kaplan avers that John Edward

True. There are also anti-Shakespeareans (and pro-Shakespeareans, for
that matter) who claim to have communicated with the spirits of Oxford
and Shakespeare -- and Bacon, too, if I remember correctly. The belief
that real scholars always reject the supernatural is groundless (albeit
widely held): scholars and scientists are no less susceptible to such
beliefs than any other segment of the population, with the possible
exception of sleight-of-hand artists, who know a trick when they see one.

I note that Streitz has just posted to complain about people who assume
that &quot;an idea cannot be true, because it is so extreme.&quot; Personally, I
find the idea that Oxford wrote _Hamlet_ posthumously to be as plausible
as the idea that he wrote _Hamlet_ at all, and more logically consistent.
Indeed, if Oxford were composing plays after his death, it eliminates the
problem with the post-1604 dates for King Lear, The Tempest, etc. In
fact, I dare say that my Supernatural PT Theory is the most logical
Oxfordian theory ever invented.

I know what you mean; you yourself have rejected my Supernatural PT

any reason for doing so. While I freely admit that the hypothesis that
Oxford composed _Hamlet_ after his death is extreme, it is the only truly

his dwelling, where he was seen not only by his wife and the household
staff, but by three doctors, a priest, numerous friends, among them
Danzas, Arendt, Princess Vyazemskaya, Zhukovsky, Turgenev, etc. and had

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt;&lt;Pushkin grew more and more in debt, from Natalia's balls, supporting

&gt; Though a loan and permission to publish a journal was [sic] granted, the
&gt; journal, The Contemporary, was not financially successful. Natalia's
&gt; popularity grew more as well. She grew fond of a young French royalist,
&gt; Heeckeren [sic].

The hapless student has seemingly confused Georges d'Anthès, who had
an affair with Pushkin's wife, Natalya Goncharova, with his sponsor and
adoptive father, the Dutch ambassador Baron van Heeckeren. When
d'Anthès used his adoptive father's surname, which he did not do until
1836, it was in the French form de Heeckeren. Although Pushkin did try
to get van Heeckeren to fight, believing him to be behind the infamous
anonymous letters (a more likely culprit is Prince Pyotr Dolgorukov), it
was d'Anthès, not the old man van Heeckeren, who fell in love with
Pushkin's wife Natalya. (In fact, van Heeckeren was believed to be
homosexual.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He pursued her as well. Their relationship growing into an

&gt; declined because of rumors that Heeckeren was really in love with
&gt; Natalia's sister. Unexpectedly Natalia's sister and Heeckeren wed in
&gt; 1837. Though he was married to her sister, Heeckeren and Natalia still
&gt; met in secret. On November 4 Pushkin wrote Heeckeren a letter accusing
&gt; him of his &quot;bastard&quot; and challenging him to a duel. The duel occurred on
&gt; January 27, 1837. Heeckeren fired first and fatally injured Pushkin. Two
&gt; day later Pushkin died. Many sympathized and mourned his death. To avoid
&gt; public display the funeral was moved to a small church WITH ADMISSION
&gt; ONLY BY TICKET. Then later during midnight, SECRETLY, his corpse was
&gt; sent to his burial. On February 6, 1837 Alexander Pushkin was buried in
&gt; Svyatye Gory Monastery beside his mother.&gt;&gt;

Some TEN THOUSAND people came to pay their last respects and filed
past Pushkin's OPEN COFFIN while a deacon chanted and a servant

&gt;&lt;&lt;Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), fatally wounded in a duel by his

&gt; recently discovered and smuggled out of the USSR. There has been a lot
&gt; of speculation and mystery surrounding this journal. According to
&gt; legend, Pushkin's will stipulated that the journal not be published
&gt; until 100 years after his death. The Journal does exist and consists of
&gt; explicit confessions about intimate relationships that Pushkin had with
&gt; his wife, her two sisters, and other women, which brought him to his
&gt; tragic end. These astonishing events and reflections reveal an unknown
&gt; details of Pushkin's life - the life of a 19th century Russian Don Juan.&gt;&gt;

The supposed &quot;secret journal&quot; is largely pornography, and does not
even display the remotest traces of the wit that enliven Pushkin's
correspondence, his known pornographic poetry, his enciphered final
chapter of _Evgenii Onegin_ that was spread strictly by word of mouth,
etc. Those who believe the &quot;secret journal&quot; to be genuine are generally
the same people who believe the Hitler Diaries to be genuine, who
believe that the lunar landing was a hoax, who deny the Bernoulli

&gt; True. There are also anti-Shakespeareans (and pro-Shakespeareans, for
&gt; that matter) who claim to have communicated with the spirits of Oxford
&gt; and Shakespeare -- and Bacon, too, if I remember correctly. The belief

&gt; I could not agree with you more. It is not a question of the origin of
&gt; an idea, or the divergence of an idea from conventional thought that
&gt; is important. What is important is the truth value of the idea. In
&gt; some cases, that can be proven by experiements, etc., in other cases
&gt; it is the preponderance of evidence. &quot;Did FDR lure the Japanese to
&gt; attack Pearl Harbor?&quot; is one of those preponderance of evidence
&gt; questions, that can never be proven in a scientific manner of
&gt; replicating experiments. Same is true with the Authorship issue.

&gt; My comment is related to the apriori judgement of many
&gt; Stratfordian/Oxfordians that an idea cannot be true, because it is so
&gt; extreme. Oxfordians for several years before my book was published

Now that Mr. Streitz HAS presented his &quot;evidence&quot; in book form, those
Oxfordians' dismissive judgment is resoundingly vindicated. Some ideas
are too insane even for most Oxfordians, improbable though that may seem

They were being polite. &quot;Extreme&quot; is a convenient euphemism for

That seems about par for the course for what I've seen of Oxfordian

No, most academics are engaged in producing research that expands the

techniques; in short, they hope to equip their students with the ability

productive thought. That Mr. Streitz evidently never acquired this

&gt;&gt; The core problem is: where does all the carbon
&gt;&gt; come from? Most (or much) sedimentary rock
&gt;&gt; (e.g. chalk, limestone) is calcium CARBONate.
&gt;&gt; Millions of cubic miles of the stuff have been laid
&gt;&gt; down over the last few hundred million years,
&gt;&gt; taking vast amounts of carbon from the
&gt;&gt; atmosphere -- thousands (or millions?) of times
&gt;&gt; what is in it at any particular moment. So it has
&gt;&gt; clearly been constantly exuded from non-organic
&gt;&gt; sources deep below the surface.

&gt;&gt; Oil is clearly not the 'remains of vegetation', like
&gt;&gt; coal, as used to be generally thought. The
&gt;&gt; discovery over the last few years of 'extreme-
&gt;&gt; ophiles' -- bacteria (or forms of life) that exist in
&gt;&gt; apparently intensely hostile conditions -- will
&gt;&gt; probably go a long way in helping to resolve
&gt;&gt; the conundrum.

&gt; There is NO conundrum Mr. Crowley!!!!!!!!!!!
&gt; Oil is generated from ORGANIC matter and there is no conspiracy keeping
&gt; alternative hypotheses suppressed!
&gt; Read &quot;Petroleum formation and occurence&quot; by Tissot &amp; Welte (Springer-Verlag,
&gt; 1978) and if you understand this book, it will become quite clear that you
&gt; should stick to what you know! On this matter you are clearly and
&gt; spectacularly ignorant!

I don't claim to know anything in this area
(or have much interest), but I am always
suspicious of self-proclaimed 'experts'
when they avoid simple questions.

Where DID all that carbon come from?

---------------------------------------------------------------------

NODIER, CHARLES (1780-1844), French author, was born on the 29th of
April 1780 at Besancon. His father, on the outbreak of the Revolution,
was appointed mayor of Besancon and consequently chief police
magistrate; he seems to have rather lent himself as an instrument to the
tyranny of the Jacobins than to have shared their principles; but his
son was for a time an ardent citizen, and is said to have been a club
member when he could at the most have been twelve years old. In 1793
Charles [age 13] saved the life of a lady guilty of sending money to an
emigre, declaring to his father that if she were condemned he would take
his own life. He was sent to Strassburg, where he lived in he house of
Eulogius Schneider, the notorious Jacobin governor of Alsace, but a good
Greek scholar. During the Terror his father put him under the care of
Girod de Chautrans, with whom he studied English and German. He became
librarian in his native town, but his exertions n the cause of suspected
persons brought him under suspicion. An inspection of his papers by the
police, however, revealed nothing more dangerous than a dissertation on
the antennae of Insects. Entomology continued to be a favourite study
with him, but he varied it with philology and pure literature and even
political writing. For a skit on Napoleon, in 1803, he was imprisoned
for some months. In 1811 Nodier appears at Laibach as editor of a
polyglot journal, the Illyrian Telegraph, published in French, German,
Italian and Slav. On the evacuation of the Illyrian provinces he
returned to Paris, and the restoration found him a royalist, though he
retained something of republican sentiment. In 1824 he was appointed to
the librarianship of the Bibliotheque de I'Arsenal. He was elected a
member of the Academy in 1833, &amp; made a member of the Legion of Honour
in 1843, a year before his death on the 27th of January 1844. These
twenty years at the arsenal were by far the most important and fruitful
of Nodier's life. He had much of the Bohemian in his composition. But he
had the advantage of a settled home in which to collect and study rare
books; and he was able to supply a centre and rallying place to a knot
of young literary men of greater individual talent than himself-the
so-called Romanticists of 1830-and to colour their tastes and work very
decidedly with his own predilections. Victor Hugo, Alfred de. Musset and
Sainte-Beuve all acknowledged their obligations to him. He was a
passionate admirer of Goethe and of Shakespeare, and had himself
contributed to the personal literature that was one of the leading
traits of the Romantic school. His best and most characteristic work,
some of which is exquisite in its kind, consists partly of short tales
of a more or less fantastic character, partly of nondescript articles,
half bibliographic, half narrative, the nearest analogue to which in
English is to be found in some of the papers of De Quincey.&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;It is difficult to pinpoint the exact motive Dumas had in mind when he
wrote _The Count of Monte Cristo_. Dumas had embarked the D'Artagnan
romances in conjunction with Auguste Maquet starting in 1837. The plots
of the D'Artagnan romances are restricted to actual historical events
and the characters reflect actual historical personages. Their objective
was to reconstruct French National history through a series of novels
(e.g., The Three Musketeers). _The Count of Monte Cristo_ is only
loosely based in fact, and thus does not fit the category of the
D'Artagnan romances.&gt;&gt;

To the foil'd searching of mortality;

than the Stratford man writing plays BEFORE he was dead. It's a
