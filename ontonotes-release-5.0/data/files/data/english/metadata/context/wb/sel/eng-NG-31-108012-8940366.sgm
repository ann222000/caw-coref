A long long time ago in a galaxy far away there lived a stoner named
David Simmons. David was one of those folks incapable of holding a
good job, never had the girlfriend, read the science fiction books
and remained indoors while his friends played outside. He is perhaps
best known for his mullet.

Is it any wonder he happened along the Commodore 64 scene at all?
Albeit way too late, he came along when everyone had left the room,
thrown out their equipment and moved in with their lives.

David is a regular smoker of marijuana and hash. His mind is reduced
to jello hence his unusual kook farts.

David Simmons is Jazzcat on the Commodore 64. You will know him by
his long greasy hair, unusual skinny physique and the bad teeth and
unusual gap between then. David Simmons hails from Tasmania,
Australia.

Something about Australia breeds stoners and fools. Slartibartfast was
a known drug abuser who inhaled nitrous, smoked hash, and hallucinated
many times a week. His messages can still be found on the Usenet.
Slarti quit
the C64 in terror when his drug abuse past was exposed.

Then there was James Julian (James Thompson in real life) who also
went by
Jaymz Julian. This was another creepy Australian who admitted in his
Livejournal
to once pulling a knife on a friend and putting it to the friend's
throat -
the reason? Even Jaymz admits he doesn't know why he did it. Then
there
was the time Jaymz picked up his computer and smashed it up against
the
wall.

Jaymz quit the scene when he and his friends began to learn of Jaymz'
drug
abuse and anger issues. Jaymz has communicated this in an email
discovered
only recently, in which he admits that he quit due to his friends
being
involved. He also admits he knows who sent the message, although David
simmons (net kook) would try to pursuade Jaymz it was WDR. More on
that in
a moment.

As David Simmons tried to reinvent the scene, he could only produce
previews
and unfinished works. He then tried to become an editor, focusing
(yawn) again
on the PAST glory days he was never a part of.

David Simmons (Jazzcat) has a tattoo on his back. It reads,
&quot;Mein Dater&quot; which he received in a Berlin, Germany tattoo
parlor. Rumor has it that David wanted &quot;man dater&quot; but due to a
language barrier received the wrong tattoo.

David's mental capacities began to unravel when he began stalking
another C64 user named WDR. David would download each one of WDR's
releases and feel compelled to comment negatively upon it. Should WDR
remove the entry, or later on resubmit the game, David would go back
some months afterwards and try to find it. It seemed almost that David
Simmons lived for WDR.

David began whining that WDR was releasing recracks. A recrack is a
game
previously cracked by someone else. Unfortunately many of these games
original disks were lost in time or had not even worked properly when
brought home from the stores.

WDR went on a fixing spree, making almost 150-200 games playable.

David made it known that unless an original disk was used, this was
bad. Forget the fact that the world has been waiting two decades now
for working versions. David claimed that original disks of these games
were available, yet nobody had tackled the 20 year past of these
games not working properly. WDR used originals where he could,
especially
from the Norwegian tape archive. David would then show more of his
unravelling mental capacity and go off on random rants, calling these
releases &quot;recracks&quot;. Apparently the tin foil hat on David's head let
in
alien messages or something - because David was able, just by looking
at a game, to identify if it was a recrack or not. WDR took games
right from
the original tape and yet David Simmons claimed it was recracked. The
mental
capacity of David was diminishing at a rapid rate.

David then complained the games were bad. In one instance he said that
your player became stuck if you were surrounded by bad guys on each
side
of you. WDR claimed (and was subsequently correct) that by pressing
fire
and the joystick UP, that you could blast the baddies and get away.
David
was the only person, incidentally, to complain about this - everyone
else
was able to figure out how to use a joystick.

David then complained about the recracks, stating that they should
have
the intros of the cracker put on, not removed. WDR, in cases where he
did
have to use a previously cracked version, put the original crack intro
on
his version, and David still complained.

Apparently this fellows mental capacities were so bad, that in
addition to
poor oral hygeine, poor hair hygiene and poor diet, his logic process
was also diseased.

David's rage increased so much over seeing WDR's perfect versions and
going against his &quot;no recrack&quot; logic, even when it was not a recrack,
that
David put up a webpage to rant.

David then took his stalking of WDR further - by following WDR's
usenet postings. David was obviously looking up old messages in
addition
To current ones. In an absolutely hilarious case, David claimed WDR
had
blue eyes and blonde hair. That information could only have come from
a demo
named &quot;Afterlife&quot; in which Boba Fette had written the scroll text for
WDR
when WDR couldn't be reached for the final linking of the page.

David then elisted the help of another netkook named David Greiman.
Greiman had lost his webpage and ISP account to WDR because WDR had
reported Greiman's net attacks against him. Greiman would also phone
up
WDR in late hours of the night on conference calls to harass him.
Greiman now works for IBM. Such credibile sources :)

Frustrated, David had to get more information. He tried his hand at
gaining WDR's photo. All he could come up with was a red headed dude
named the Cock Mongler. It was so pathetic and hilarious that even his
friends were laughing at him. WDR even pointed out the links (many of
them)
which pointed out the red headed guy was from Alberta and nicknamed
Cock Mongler. In the end David's mental capacity had to give in, and
David
quietly removed the photo.

David then claimed that WDR lived at 3665 Arista Way in Mississauga.
He
may have been on acid at the time, but David claimed he'd had a fellow
who
had SEEN WDR at that address and would be providing more details. No
such details
ever came out, likely due to the fact that WDR had never lived in
Mississauga.
David's mental capacities were now at an all time low, as David's drug
abuse
continued.

David then tried to incite public support by mailing an alleged used
condom to
Oswald and to Stash. David had been monitoring forum messages and felt
that he
could use the ongoing debates to his advantage. When the condoms were
received,
David claimed that WDR had used a mail-forwarding service to send
them. David
Simmons erred on two parts. The first was that WDR lives in Canada and
would not
need a forwarding service. The second and more critical error was that
no photos
or infirmation had been shown publically yet. How did David know that
a mail
forwarding service was used? Likely because David Simmons had to
resort to using
one in order to try to make the letters look like they were authentic.

David Simmons even had the receivers of the condoms take scans of them
and
send them to him. It seems unlikely that anyone who received a condom
via mail
would hang on to it let alone take a photo of it. Rumor has it that
David
took the photos himself, another rumor is that the photos were staged
by those
who sent them. The most likely scenario is David used the forwarding
service and
those are the photos we see today.

Knowing WDR used to be an Ozzy fan, David's next move was to go to
Ozzyhead's
webpage and leave nasty messages in it. This would allow ozzyhead to
think, as
Oswald and Stash did, that WDR was behind it. Remember David would
spend hours
at a time looking up WDR's past. Mitch sent David some outdated photos
and David realized at long last that Cock Mongler was in fact not WDR.
Too much drugs, too much drugs :)

Jaymz Julian contributed to the stalking of WDR. Logs were saved which
show Jaymz running script after script on WDR's webpages trying to
hack it. Unfortunately for Jaymz, WDR used ASP not PHP and they were a
waste of time and effort.

Jaymz and David communicated a lot, mainly about WDR. It was quite
obsessive
and stalker like. DAvid was concerned that he was about to lose his
coveted website
due to DCMA allegations as well as the ISP fed up with David's
stalking
antics. Jazzcat/David even offered to PAY out of his own pocket and
take over the
page that Jaymz Julian was paying for. It seemed odd anyone would pay
money to
try to tell an uncaring world about opinions on recracks, old photos
and
condoms.

As David's mental functions dwindled away, he began going after WDR's
family
by visiting their webpages. Logs were kept which show this, and
members of the
family soon began receiving phone calls from David. It was not hard to
determine
who it was, for the accent gave it away as did the double-chirp when
David
hung up. American conferencees will know what this sound is compared
to the
soundless American hang up.

WDR and his wife moved to a small community island to be closer to
relatives. In the process they changed their phone number and
the phone calls from Australia stopped.

To this day David can still be found spamming the internet with his
kookfart webpage. Ironically these posts are to the same groups, even
the same THREADS that WDR is using.

In other words, the Australian drug abuser is stalking WDR online to
post messages to direct people to a webpage which labels WDR as a
stalker.
It's quite ironic but typical of David's mental processes.

WDR routinely uses a post script to make it difficult for David to
learn where WDR works. It has worked for two years, as none of WDR's
family, friends nor co-workers have ever said anything about hearing
from
David.

Interestingly enough, David who is known for his drug abuse, claims
that
WDR has red hair, is a drug user, an alcoholic and takes Paxil. It can
only
be added to the already long list of inconsistencies David's mind
dreams up.

WDR hasn't had any alcohol since 1991, and was always a social
drinker.
WDR has never taken Paxil, and never used drugs.

In a final display of proving to the world that David was indeed
stalking
WDR (that is to say, waking up every morning and spending hours of his
life looking up WDR material... can you say pwned?), David proudly
crowed
to the world that he had found information that WDR had stalked an ex
girlfriend
named Angie Legrow. Sadly he overlooked two details. He overlooked the
person
who was on the other end of the exchange was a fellow explorer friend,
and
that another thread revealed that it was all a prank played on a
person WDR
knew was stalking him - also named Dave.

You can still David looking for anything he can find on WDR, for
reasons
knowon only to David. David can claimed he'd like to see WDR charged,
yet
out of all of the claims David has made, absolutely none of them seem
to
contain any evidence. The screenshots and text pastes could have been
forged, faked or from someone else. David has much to learn about the
legal system as well as learning to say no to drugs. It has
destroyed his mind. David once wrote to Julian that he &quot;would like to
get the Google hits up&quot; for the website, meaning that David would be
once more spamming and flooding c64 sites as he had previously done.

In the end, it seems nobody cares about WDR but David :)

A tragic life destroyed by illicit narcotics which joins the ranks of
fellow Aussies as Jaymz Julian and Slartibartfarter.
