Hi, wondering if somebody could give me some more information than my
Vet was able to?
Took my 14 m.o. cavalier in this morning to get a thinning (from her
biting, I guess) patch on her back above her tail checked.  I've seen this
before in lots of dogs at the park, but have never really known what causes
it.
He questioned any recent food changes, and when I told him I changed
over about the time it tarted to happen, he basically said, &quot;That's probably
it then.  Give it ten days (back on the original food,) and if it doesn't
improve, come back and we'll talk about steroid injections.&quot;
I know I should have been way more assertive and asked questions, but
I'm kind of quiet, and now I've got no idea -
1)    What this bare patch actually IS.
2)    How change of food can produce it, or
3)    What steroids will do to help.
I'm about to jump on Google now, but if anyone here could steer me in
the direction of a good website or something, I'd be very grateful.

Your vet is suspecting skin  reactions due to food allergy sensitivity.

If the food you are on now is causing the inflammation, he wants you to
stop the food that 's causing it.

For instance, I am allergic to cashews. Cashews produce a rash on me
similar to a poison ivy rash. I quit eating cashews, and in a few weeks,
the rash goes away. Some people et much more severe reactions to foods.
The solution is to not eat those.

If your dog is allergic to the food you are now feeding, the solution is
the same. Quit feeding that food. Go back to the food you were on, and had
no problems with. If after several weeks the issues go away, you will be
able to say your dog did not do well on your current food, and put that on
the list NOT to buy.

Steroids reduce the inflammation, itching and soreness allwing it to heal
faster, providing relief.

I agree with Diddy. I have a dog with allergies and he is on a special
diet..  Also.. have you changed or added any types of treats/chews? My
guy can only have fruit/veggie treats

Do you flea treat him?? M neighbor had a collie that she and the vet
could not find any evidence of fleas but as soon as she used frontline
the hotspots would clear up

good luck

Base of tail is also a very classic flea problem chew spot, so I'd be
looking at that first.

Sometimes pets are such good groomers that finding a live flea at any moment
may turn up nothing. Doesn't mean they're not there, especially in an air
conditioned clinic where the fleas will burrow into the warmest cozy spot
away from flea combs and eyes.

Thanks everyone.  Here in Australia we have a BIG problem with fleas.
Frontline seems to have lost most of its effectiveness (the female locum Vet
I took her to last time was saying the company is holding all kinds of
conferences to reasure Vets that it is still working, despite anecdotal
evidence they're all getting that it's not.)
We are now using Advantage, but lately I've taken to combing her with a
very fine toothed 'nit' comb, and even in the first week after applying it,
I'll still usually rake out at least one of two live fleas.  I spray her
environment, wash her bedding, and do everything I can think of, so I hope
it's not a flea allergy, because I don't think I can fix it, short of never
letting her outside for a run.
Would she be likely to become suddenly allergic, even though this has
been a problem for about eighteen months?
Thanx 4 your time...

If you leave your vet's office with unanswered questions [which should
never happen, IMHO], it is probably your fault. For the vet, not knowing
the answers, and not knowing how to explain them on your level are two
different things. If he has trouble helping you understand, be patient
and ask him to be patient, too. If he just doesn't know the answers, and
isn't interested in finding out, it is time for a new vet.

We all need to be prepared, before we arrive at the vet's office. Google
ahead of time. My vet respects me because I arrived well read. We work
as a team. He is sometimes startled and impressed, and I feel good, too!

You need to have some idea...before you meet with your vet.

One of my favorite online resources is
http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp

There are many others--often affiliated with vet schools.

A. A hot spot is a localized area of skin inflammation and infection.
The infection can be superficial or deep. Other common names for this
condition include: moist dermatitis, pyotraumatic dermatitis, and acute
moist dermatitis. Broken down, &quot;pyo-&quot; refers to &quot;pus&quot;, &quot;-traumatic&quot;
refers to self-inflicted trauma of biting, licking, scratching, and so
on, and &quot;dermatitis&quot; means inflammation of the skin.

Sometimes hair can mat over the lesion, obscuring the size and degree of
the problem...There is usually an inciting factor to initiate the
extreme licking and scratching behavior. Look for fleas, mites, or other
external parasites, an insect sting or bite, allergies (food, inhalant,
contact), or injury (skin wound, scrape, etc.). Some animals have been
known to &quot;start&quot; a hot spot out of boredom or stress-related
psychological problems.

I'm not going to look up the pathology, but just think about  how foods
alter our skin. Chocolate causes problems for many people, especially
teens, I think. Diddy mentioned being very allergic to cashews.  :-(

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;    3)    What steroids will do to help.

I hope your vet mentioned that steroids [which are tough on the liver]
should be a last resort. The key ingredient in Benadryl,
diaphenhydramine, might do the trick. WalMart has an inexpensive, exact
generic match for Benadryl.  However, except in truly dire cases, I
consider addressing the cause far more important than the treatment.

Story: I met Pekingnese-mix, Sophie at the shelter, but only had a
couple of minutes to visit. She was adopted almost immediately. When she
was returned to the shelter, one week later, for snapping at the
children, I immediately adopted her. I didn't believe that was it was
her nature to attack anyone. I investigated, and found that her tummy
was raw! Even a vet had failed to spot the problem. So, everyone who had
been holding her, was hurting her.

Little by little, I healed her hot sports, and Sophie became a wonderful
pet. Having her tummy rubbed was her greatest joy! She never showed the
slightest sign of aggression.

Allergies happen even in dogs.  I can eat something for years and the next
time I eat is I get hives.........so I don't eat it again.  I've been this
way my whole life.  Dog can be the same way.

Do as the vet suggest go back to using the previous food and see if it
clears up.  If it does the dog has a food allergy to something in the new
food you are feeding it.  I had a dog who had this happen 5 times over his
life.  When it did we switched him to something else that he could eat.
Even my current dog is severly allegic to canned Alpo.  I'm not sure what
ingredient it is that causes the reaction but within hours of eating it
she's scratching and digging herself raw.

Michael,
thanks for putting so much time and effort into your reply.  It was
really helpful.  You're right - I'll be much better informed next time I
visit the Vet.
