*********************** ARTICLE START ***********************
Times sure are changing. There was a time when bullocks and horses acted as transport systems. In today's world, bullocks and horses are themselves carried from place to place on vehicles driven by engines. There was a time when all that a girl could hope for was to marry a good and sufficiently wealthy man. These days, women make their own money and only if they are so inclined do they think about marriage. There was a time when the only available insurance plan was on life. Today, anything can be insured. From diamond jewelry to pets to footballers' feet, any and everything is subject to being insured.

The most common types of insurance, of course, are motor insurance and home insurance. You can insure your car so that later on, making repairs will be relatively easier on your pocket. Moreover, several countries insist that no car should be taken out on the road without its first having got insured. Are you surprised at that rule? Well, you really should not be. After all, given the large numbers of accidents on the road, it is a good idea to get the cars insured at the very onset. Interestingly, these days, insurance providers have come up with a plan that covers third party cars. Thus, if your car rams into another, your insurance deal will take care of the other person's repair costs as well.

Getting insurance for your house is also a must. Things like fires and burglaries do not need invitation cards. They come uninvited and either burn or run away with much of your hard-earned dough. A good insurance plan will take care of these unwanted eventualities. At least you will not have to keep on worrying about how you will manage if such a thing does happen. You have insured your house after all.

Medical insurance is another common type. It makes sense to cover yourself for possible medical problems. So, if it does happen that you need to undergo an urgent operation, you will not have to postpone it because of lack of funds.

One up-coming insurance type is the travel insurance. This is a good idea for people who are traveling quite a distance away from their homes. You never know what medical problems may occur. To be stuck without sufficient money in a strange land can be terrifying.

Every day heralds the birth of yet another type of insurance. Which insurance plans would you say are the most important?
