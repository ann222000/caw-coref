Boy admits telling two stories about Jackson's alleged molestations

Michael Jackson denies accusations that he twice molested a boy in his
bedroom at Neverland Ranch.

By John Springer
Court TV
SANTA MARIA, Calif. - A boy who claims he twice saw Michael Jackson
molesting his brother in the singer's bed admitted Tuesday that he perjured
himself in the past and gave conflicting accounts of the alleged
molestation.
&quot;I don't want to mix you up. I'm just trying to find out the truth, if I
can,&quot; lead defense attorney Thomas Mesereau Jr. told the witness, now 14,
after getting the boy to admit to past lies.
Mesereau is trying to prove to jurors in Jackson's molestation and
conspiracy trial that the accuser and his siblings were manipulated by their
mother in order to set up a civil molestation lawsuit similar to one Jackson
reportedly settled with another family for $20 million in 1993.
In fact, the accuser's brother in the current case, who is identified as
&quot;James Doe&quot; in court papers, admitted that he and his family had met with
Larry Feldman, a lawyer who represented the accuser in the 1993 case.

Going over James' testimony almost line by line, Mesereau tried to poke
holes in his claim that Jackson masturbated while fondling &quot;John Doe&quot; twice
when he was 13 years old.
James told jurors Monday that he walked up a flight of stairs and was able
to see the alleged acts, both times while his brother slept, from behind a
banister.
On cross-examination, James testified that on both occasions he heard an
&quot;electric bell&quot; go off when he entered a hallway at the bottom of the
staircase, which he took to mean that Jackson wanted to be alerted when
someone approached his bedroom.
Mesereau expressed incredulity that Jackson would be caught twice molesting
a boy in his bedroom when alarms were supposedly sounding.
Mesereau also challenged James on his testimony Monday that a photograph of
adult-oriented magazines found in a suitcase in Jackson's home were the same
magazines that James claims were shown to him by Michael Jackson during
bizarre sleepover parties the singer had with boys at his Neverland Ranch.
Shown the picture again on Tuesday, James confirmed that the photograph in
evidence depicted what he saw: a young blond woman exposing her breasts on
the cover of a magazine entitled &quot;Barely Legal.&quot;
Mesereau noted that the date on the magazine in the photo was August 2003,
at least five months after James and his family stopped visiting Neverland
Ranch.
&quot;I said he showed us 'Barely Legal.' I didn't say he showed us that exact
one,&quot; James said.
The bulk of the cross-examination so far has centered on a civil lawsuit the
accuser's family filed against JCPenney over alleged abuse they suffered at
the hands of store security personnel in a parking lot.
James testified that he did not remember much about the suit, although he
acknowledged being represented by a lawyer when he gave a sworn deposition
in 2000, the same year he met Jackson.
&quot;I don't remember,&quot; James said in response to several questions.
&quot;Did someone tell you to say 'I don't remember' in response to my
questions?&quot; Mesereau asked.
&quot;No,&quot; James said. &quot;If I don't remember, I don't remember.&quot;
James did not remember saying in the deposition that his father never fought
with his mother, and that his father never hit him.
&quot;Is that true?&quot; Mesereau asked.
James said it was not.
&quot;Did someone tell you to lie in that deposition?&quot; Mesereau asked.
&quot;I don't remember,&quot; James said. &quot;It happened a long time ago.&quot;
Perhaps most important for the defense was James' acknowledgement that he
told different accounts about the molestation he claims he witnessed when
speaking to investigators and a grand jury.
On one occasion, he said his brother was wearing pajamas. Another time, he
said he was wearing just his underwear. James also said at one point that
Jackson had his hand in his brother's underwear; another time, he said he
was touching the boy on the outside of his underwear.
Testimony is set to resume Wednesday at 11:30 a.m. ET.

Lady M.,

Thanks for posting this article. This is one of the few times that the
media actually reported the TRUTH. I saw the same thing on many other
outlets. Of course, during the entire trial Mez turned virtually every
persecution witness into a defense witness by showing them to be liars.
Starr's lies were just one more nail into the coffin of the corrupt
persecutor and that is the very reason that he lost. The jury, the very
conservative jury (there were no blacks; therefore, the racists
haterflosers can't use THAT as an EXCUSE) knew that Gavin was a liar and
they also knew that the entire case was the persecutor's bullshit. That
is the very reason that every single person on the jury acquitted
Michael of 14 bogus charges. You know that it is really telling when a
jury, even with the flip-floppers Ellie and Ralph, didn't believe a
single word from the persecution. The corrupt persecutor was so
desperate, he knew that his case was weak, that he threw in three or
four bullshit misdemeanors in the hope that the jury would convict
Michael of somethin, anything. The jury didn't fall for the inept
persecutor's BS. In reality, even some who bash Michael didn't believe
that this case had any merit. I specifically remember Tattoo saying that
he didn't believe that Michael had abused Gavin. Tattoo's reasoning,
like every other intelligent person, was that the timeline didn't fit.
That one point alone was enough for anyone who wants justice to surmise
that this whole case was a conspiracy/set-up. The corrupt persecutor
didn't count on the jury being fair, intelligent and aware. The
persecutor really did think that since he had the court on his side that
the jury would fall for his lies. We all know that the jury was smarter
than the persecutor realized or hoped for. The persecutor thought that
his &quot;good ole boy&quot; tactics (that he used on every other person that he
persecuted) would work this time. The jury, the conservative jury,
showed the persecutor that they were indeed intelligent, fair and wanted
justice. No one on that jury believed that the grifters had been
kidnapped and certainly no one believed that Gavin had been molested or
that Starr had stood and watched him be molested.

Again, Lady, thanks for posting this article to remind the haterflosers
what WE (aware people) have always knows. Starr lied, Gavin lied, the
Crack Ho Mama lied and so did virtually every persecution witness that
testified. Finally, it was the inclusion of the &quot;1108&quot; perjurers that
really convinced the jury that the corrupt persecutor didn't have a real
case. His own &quot;bombshell&quot; witness-Jordan Chandler- didn't even come in
to help the persecutor with his scam. Now THAT was the most telling
thing about this set-up/ frame-up trial.

Lady,

I forgot to add that this article really shows just how inept the
persecutor was. He actually thought that a jury would believe that the
brother of the lying accuser would just stand there and watch his
brother being &quot;abuse&quot; two times and never mention it to anyone. The
really funny part is that Starr said that Gavin was asleep. Who coached
these two grifters? Most likely it was the inept persecutor and his
equally inept whore, the FIRED Court TV tabloid &quot;reporter&quot;. Can you
imagine anyone being stupid enough to coach these two grifters with
those ridiculous stories and think that a jury would believe them. Even
the persecutor's fellow prosecutors shook their heads at this pathetic
story. I guess since the persecutor had the court on his side, he
thought that ANYTHING would work. It truly is unbelievable that any
person, even someone as stupid and gullible as these haterflosers are,
would believe the bullshit that these people perpetrated. This trial
really seperated the fans from the haterflosers. WE investigated,
researched EVERY person involved, every court filing, every transcript
and knew that the Arvizzos and the persecutor were involved in this
frame-up. The haterflosers sat on their flat asses and were spoon-fed
spin by a CourtTV whore, who was later fired when her lies didn't come
true. It is mind-boggling to think that these haterflosers are too
stupid to do anything on their own. Of course, WE already know that this
trial had nothing to do with any &quot;molestation&quot; and everything to do with
acquiring the Beatles catalogue.
