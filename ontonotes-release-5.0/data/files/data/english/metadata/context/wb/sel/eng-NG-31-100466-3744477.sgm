Measuring Six Basic Styles of Love

Listed below are sample items from Hendrick and Hendrick's love scale,
which was designed  to measure the six styles of love identified by Lee
(1977, 1988). Read through the various items and think about your
current or past relationships. Which style or styles characterize
each of these relationships. According to Lee, people could experience
many different styles of love during their lives.

Eros

Pluto, Leo
Mars, Fire Element

1.   My lover and I were attracted to each other immediately after we
first met.
2.   Our lovemaking is very intense and satisfying.
3.   My lover fits my ideal standards of physical beauty/handsomeness.

Ludus

Jupiter, Fire
Mercury, Gemini

1.   I try to keep my lover a little uncertain about my commitment to
him/her.
2.   I have sometimes had to keep two of my lovers from finding out
about each other.
3.   I enjoy playing the "game of love' with a number of different
partners.

Storge

Aquarius,
Uranus, Air Element

1.   It is hard to say exactly when my lover and I fell in love. (Our
friendship merged gradually into love over time.)
2.   Love is really a deep friendship, not a mysterious, mystical
emotion.
3.   My most satisfying love relationships have developed from good
friendships.

Pragma

Earth Element
Saturn

1.   I consider what a person is going to become in life before I commit
myself to him/her.
2.   I try to plan my life carefully before choosing a lover.
3.   A main consideration in choosing a lover is how he/she reflects on
my family.

Mania

Fire, Uranus
Pluto

1.   Sometimes I get so excited about being in love that I can't sleep.
2.   When I am in love, I have trouble concentrating on anything else.
3.   If my lover ignores me for a while, I sometimes do stupid things to
get his/her attention back.

Agape

Water, Neptune
Fire

1.   I would rather suffer myself than let my lover suffer.
2.   I cannot be happy unless I place my lover's happiness before my
own.
3.   I would endure all things for the sake of my lover.

Astrological Correlations: Edmond H. Wollmann

Also there are love types, which can be correlated as well;
Love as a Triangle (Sternberg 1988) conceives of different kinds of
love being a Intimacy combination of the three basic (liking)components
of intimacy, passion, and commitment.

Romantic  Companionate love (intimacy + G / + commitment)

Passion Commitment (infatuation)(empty love)

Fatuous love (passion +commitment)

A TRIANGULAR THEORY OF LOVE
Robert Sternberg ( 1986, 1988) has proposed that love can be thought of
as a triangle, with its three corners consisting of the three components
of passion, intimacy, and commitment According to Sternberg, all kinds
of love are made up of different combinations and
proportions of these components:

Liking: the experience of intimacy without passion and commitment
(e.g., friendship)

Infatuated love: the experience of passion without intimacy and
commitment
(e.g., "puppy love")

Empty love: the experience of commitment without passion and intimacy
(e.g., stagnant marriages)

Romantic love: the experience of passion and intimacy without commitment
(e.g., extramarital affairs)

Companionate love: the experience of intimacy and commitment without
passion
(e.g., many long-term, happy marriages)

Fatuous love: the experience of passion plus commitment without intimacy
(e.g., love at first sight)

Consummate Love: the experience of intimacy, passion, and commitment
(good luck!)

Although Sternberg's theory appears to capture the richness and
diversity of the love experience, its weakness is that the scales used
to measure passion, intimacy, and commitment
don't appear to measure distinct, independent components (Hendrick &amp;
Hendrick, 1989).
Until this measurement problem is corrected, we cannot confidently
assess how useful this
theory is in helping us better understand the various love types.
"Social Psychology", Stephen L. Franzoi, Chapter 9, Intimate
relationships, page 364, Marquette University, 1996.

"Infatuation is when you think he's as sexy as Robert Redford, as smart
as Henry Kissenger, as noble as Ralph Nader, as funny as Woody Allen,
and as atheletic as Jimmy Connors.
Love is when you realize that he's as sexy as Woody Allen, as smart as
Jimmy Connors, as funny as Ralph Nader, as atheletic as Henry Kissenger,
and nothing like Robert Redford in any category-but you'll take him
anyway." (quoted by Hatfield &amp; Rapson, 1993, Social Psychology, Stephen
Franzoi)

Ed:

You mentioned that Sternberg's triangular theory of love has been criticized
because they do not appear to measure distinct, independent components
(Hendrick &amp; Hendrick, 1989).

You also mention (Franzoi, 1996)  "Until this measurement problem is
corrected, we cannot confidently assess how useful "Sternberg's" theory is
in helping us better understand the various love types."

While I agree that subjective constructs such as "Intimacy" are difficult to
define or quantify, certainly you are not trying to imply here that concepts
such as "Mars, Fire Element" have any efficacy in the academic literature,
especially when compared with Sternberg's research?  The reason I ask is
because it seems to me after reading your post that you are indeed implying
this. For example, where is the scholarship that would appear to challenge
(or support) the premise behind the "Six Basic Love Styles" in the same
manner that you use the literature to challenge the measurability of
Sternberg?

By the way, in order to have a proper academic discussion, if you do present
any positive evidence for the efficacy of Mars, Aquarius, Pluto, etc.,
please do so only with peer reviewed, academic scientific journals.
Otherwise, this discussion should move to alt.newage or alt.astrology.
where comparisons to scholars like Sternberg are not necessary to validate
the claims being insinuated.

Thank you.

I simply posted those challenges for those unfamiliar with the idea, I
do not claim my pairing of those notions with the measurement construct
to be anything other than a begining of a theory I have from my
expertise with astrology and skills in interpreting those ideas, with
what I know to be the "Lovestyles" theory.

&gt; &gt; and nothing like Robert Redford in any category-but you'll take him

It is good to know we are now past this issue since this particular reader
is well versed on Sternberg's theory, meaning that we can move the dialog
forward--hopefully you can addess the question at hand, which is how a
criticism of Sternberg is relevent to the discussion of astrology.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; You also mention (Franzoi, 1996)  &quot;Until this measurement problem is
&gt;&gt; corrected, we cannot confidently assess how useful &quot;Sternberg's&quot; theory
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; in helping us better understand the various love types.&quot;

&gt;&gt; While I agree that subjective constructs such as &quot;Intimacy&quot; are difficult
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; define or quantify, certainly you are not trying to imply here that
&gt;&gt; concepts
&gt;&gt; such as &quot;Mars, Fire Element&quot; have any efficacy in the academic
&gt;&gt; literature,
&gt;&gt; especially when compared with Sternberg's research?  The reason I ask is
&gt;&gt; because it seems to me after reading your post that you are indeed
&gt;&gt; implying
&gt;&gt; this. For example, where is the scholarship that would appear to
&gt;&gt; challenge
&gt;&gt; (or support) the premise behind the &quot;Six Basic Love Styles&quot; in the same
&gt;&gt; manner that you use the literature to challenge the measurability of
&gt;&gt; Sternberg?

&gt; I simply posted those challenges for those unfamiliar with the idea, I
&gt; do not claim my pairing of those notions with the measurement construct
&gt; to be anything other than a begining of a theory I have from my
&gt; expertise with astrology and skills in interpreting those ideas, with
&gt; what I know to be the &quot;Lovestyles&quot; theory.
">

Okay, fair enough, then the obvious question here is, why bring up criticism
of Sternberg's theory at all, if you had no intention of "pairing it" to
your astrological "lovestyles" theory? Why comment on the difficulty of
defining the three constructs with Sternberg unless you are implying the six
astrological love styles does not suffer from the same problems?

If you merely have a spiritual belief in astrology, which is perfectly fine
by me, the discussion is over because "faith" is subjectively a
self-evident, phenomenological reality.  However, if you wish to test that
faith through empirical analysis, then you should be able to back such
comments up with qualitative or quantitative analysis of the literature.

EXAMPLE
For example, over the years, Stermberg (2001) incorporated a multitude of
emirical studies with couples to test the efficacy of his theory at Yale
with collegues.  Where is your evidence (regression analysis, pearson
coefficients, p values, confidence intervals) that would suggest that
couples respond to a lovestyle survey in the similar manner according to
their astrological charts (perhaps venus sign positions, mars sign
positions, etc).
A study like this would be viturally free to conduct, and would give you
strong information as to whether or not there is any reason for anyone
(familiar or not familiar with Sternberg) including yourself to believe in
the objective reality of your claims.

position it as though it were a legitimate topic for the behavioral

Please understand that I have absolutely nothing against faith statements,

&gt;&gt; &gt; Measuring Six Basic Styles of Love

&gt;&gt; &gt; Listed below are sample items from Hendrick and Hendrick's love scale,
&gt;&gt; &gt; which was designed  to measure the six styles of love identified by Lee
&gt;&gt; &gt; (1977, 1988). Read through the various items and think about your
&gt;&gt; &gt; current or past relationships. Which style or styles characterize
&gt;&gt; &gt; each of these relationships. According to Lee, people could experience
&gt;&gt; &gt; many different styles of love during their lives.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Eros

&gt;&gt; &gt; Pluto, Leo
&gt;&gt; &gt; Mars, Fire Element

&gt;&gt; &gt; 1.   My lover and I were attracted to each other immediately after we
&gt;&gt; &gt; first met.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 2.   Our lovemaking is very intense and satisfying.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 3.   My lover fits my ideal standards of physical beauty/handsomeness.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Ludus

&gt;&gt; &gt; Jupiter, Fire
&gt;&gt; &gt; Mercury, Gemini

&gt;&gt; &gt; 1.   I try to keep my lover a little uncertain about my commitment to
&gt;&gt; &gt; him/her.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 2.   I have sometimes had to keep two of my lovers from finding out
&gt;&gt; &gt; about each other.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 3.   I enjoy playing the &quot;game of love' with a number of different
&gt;&gt; &gt; partners.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Storge

&gt;&gt; &gt; Aquarius,
&gt;&gt; &gt; Uranus, Air Element

&gt;&gt; &gt; 1.   It is hard to say exactly when my lover and I fell in love. (Our
&gt;&gt; &gt; friendship merged gradually into love over time.)
&gt;&gt; &gt; 2.   Love is really a deep friendship, not a mysterious, mystical
&gt;&gt; &gt; emotion.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 3.   My most satisfying love relationships have developed from good
&gt;&gt; &gt; friendships.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Pragma

&gt;&gt; &gt; Earth Element
&gt;&gt; &gt; Saturn

&gt;&gt; &gt; 1.   I consider what a person is going to become in life before I
&gt;&gt; &gt; commit
&gt;&gt; &gt; myself to him/her.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 2.   I try to plan my life carefully before choosing a lover.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 3.   A main consideration in choosing a lover is how he/she reflects on
&gt;&gt; &gt; my family.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Mania

&gt;&gt; &gt; Fire, Uranus
&gt;&gt; &gt; Pluto

&gt;&gt; &gt; 1.   Sometimes I get so excited about being in love that I can't sleep.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 2.   When I am in love, I have trouble concentrating on anything else.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 3.   If my lover ignores me for a while, I sometimes do stupid things
&gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt; get his/her attention back.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Agape

&gt;&gt; &gt; Water, Neptune
&gt;&gt; &gt; Fire

&gt;&gt; &gt; 1.   I would rather suffer myself than let my lover suffer.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 2.   I cannot be happy unless I place my lover's happiness before my
&gt;&gt; &gt; own.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 3.   I would endure all things for the sake of my lover.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Source: Adapted from C. Hendrick &amp; S. Hendrick, 1986.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Astrological Correlations: Edmond H. Wollmann

&gt;&gt; &gt; Also there are love types, which can be correlated as well;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Love as a Triangle (Sternberg 1988) conceives of different kinds of
&gt;&gt; &gt; love being a Intimacy combination of the three basic (liking)components
&gt;&gt; &gt; of intimacy, passion, and commitment.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Romantic  Companionate love (intimacy + G / + commitment)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Passion Commitment (infatuation)(empty love)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Fatuous love (passion +commitment)

&gt;&gt; &gt; A TRIANGULAR THEORY OF LOVE
&gt;&gt; &gt; Robert Sternberg ( 1986, 1988) has proposed that love can be thought of
&gt;&gt; &gt; as a triangle, with its three corners consisting of the three
&gt;&gt; &gt; components
&gt;&gt; &gt; of passion, intimacy, and commitment According to Sternberg, all kinds
&gt;&gt; &gt; of love are made up of different combinations and
&gt;&gt; &gt; proportions of these components:

&gt;&gt; &gt; Liking: the experience of intimacy without passion and commitment
&gt;&gt; &gt; (e.g., friendship)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Infatuated love: the experience of passion without intimacy and
&gt;&gt; &gt; commitment
&gt;&gt; &gt; (e.g., &quot;puppy love&quot;)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Empty love: the experience of commitment without passion and intimacy
&gt;&gt; &gt; (e.g., stagnant marriages)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Romantic love: the experience of passion and intimacy without
&gt;&gt; &gt; commitment
&gt;&gt; &gt; (e.g., extramarital affairs)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Companionate love: the experience of intimacy and commitment without
&gt;&gt; &gt; passion
&gt;&gt; &gt; (e.g., many long-term, happy marriages)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Fatuous love: the experience of passion plus commitment without
&gt;&gt; &gt; intimacy
&gt;&gt; &gt; (e.g., love at first sight)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Consummate Love: the experience of intimacy, passion, and commitment
&gt;&gt; &gt; (good luck!)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Although Sternberg's theory appears to capture the richness and
&gt;&gt; &gt; diversity of the love experience, its weakness is that the scales used
&gt;&gt; &gt; to measure passion, intimacy, and commitment
&gt;&gt; &gt; don't appear to measure distinct, independent components (Hendrick &amp;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Hendrick, 1989).
&gt;&gt; &gt;   Until this measurement problem is corrected, we cannot confidently
&gt;&gt; &gt; assess how useful this
&gt;&gt; &gt; theory is in helping us better understand the various love types.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Social Psychology&quot;, Stephen L. Franzoi, Chapter 9, Intimate
&gt;&gt; &gt; relationships, page 364, Marquette University, 1996.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Infatuation is when you think he's as sexy as Robert Redford, as smart
&gt;&gt; &gt; as Henry Kissenger, as noble as Ralph Nader, as funny as Woody Allen,
&gt;&gt; &gt; and as atheletic as Jimmy Connors.

I don't get the part where you say that we create our own reality, yet
yours is so miserable; all you do is complain and you seem very unhappy.

What caused this resistance to your own growth to cause all the negative

Why have you chosen on some level to put out such bad vibrations? Were
you "born into" being voted a Kook on Usenet more times than anyone else?

Or is this simply your Karma, after having killed a teenage boy?

Ed:

To answer your question, a "dispositor" is a term typically used by
followers of the astrological belief to describe the rule a given planet has
(planet "A") over a sign currently occupied by another planet (planet "B").
Hence planet A is said to effectively "dispose" planet B.

To quote you:  "The signs are like "light" and the planets the lenses that
focus that light in this solar system."

This statement about the "signs" being "like light" is a statement of
spiritual faith, which as I mentioned before, I take no quarrel with.  I am
also glad that you agree with me, and I quote you:

"No two BELIEF SYSTEMS have had a larger effect on the history of the world
than Christianity and Astrology."

Regardless of whether or not I agree with the above statement as a matter of
historical accuracy, I was nevertheless highly encouraged to see that you
are indeed not making any dangerous claims that astrological consulting, nor
chart calculations have any physical scientific efficacy, diagnostic
credibility, nor measurable applications for the behavioral sciences, but
instead are steeped in the good old tradition of a religious faith
statement. Other statements of religious faith are obvious on your site...

"Astrological signs are like light"

"Astrological signs interact with the psyche and the physical world in a
synergistic manner"

"The moon acts as a reservoir containing aspects of our consciousness we may
not be aware of."

I will not dispute belief statements at all, and some may indeed be nice
metaphors, used symbolically rather than to be taken literally (that is up
to you, not me). Likewise, I would not dispute, as a matter of faith, the
belief a person has about the resurrection of a flesh God, the virgin birth
of a flesh God, the existence of Golden Tablets given to Joseph Smith by the
angel Gabriel, the belief that life was seeded by aliens, etc. All are
equally valid religious concepts, and are subject to examination according
to comparative religious scholarship, not scientific analysis.

BUT HERE ARE THE DISTURBING PARTS!!

Although you clearly mentioned astrology as a belief system above, and give
the reader many faith statements, you contradict yourself on numerous
occasions...

"faith is not required for it [astrology] to function. It is a subject that
can be known and is operationally obvious once learned..The sciences
themselves are belief systems and constructs to explain reality."

Okay, now faith is NOT required for astrology to "function, meaning you
SHOULD be able to show me empirical support using experimental and control
group couples you're your interplanetary "Six Love styles" theory (since
Astrology functions OUTSIDE the realm of mere belief). Yet two sentences
later you contradict your statement yet again..

"We cannot believe, or not believe, in something [astrology] of which we
know nothing about."

Okay Ed, If you ("we") know nothing about astrology, then using deductive
logic, how can you be certain it is also a subject that "can be known".and
is "operationally obvious"?   Such statements are highly inconsistent.

Recap: According to you, Astrology is (A) a belief system, rising above the
need for empirical scrutiny, and simultaneously (B) Not a belief system,
that is, it is a phenomena that functions within the physical world outside
subjective phenomenology!  Logically, the reader is left (after spending a
very long time on your site), with the conclusion that you believe astrology
to be an empirical, testable reality for which a belief system or
metaphysical position is, perhaps, an optional position one may choose to
take if he or she wishes.

But if this is true, why then is the reader also told to believe that the
physical sciences ARE a belief system too!  Ed! That is the argument the
Fundamentalists use to combat the teaching of evolution. Which is it Ed, are
you espousing a religion here or not?  Wait, wait, wait...the answer arrives
to the reader upon further exploration of your site(s)..

Dubious Behavior Thus Ensues

Although it may/may not include a belief system, and even though it is AND
is not something that can be known by a person, you also claim that
astrology can be used for the purposes of professional counseling. The
nature of this "consulting" mirrors the goals of psychotherapy...

"When blended with the helping professions astrology becomes a powerful tool
of insight and a guide to remediation--psychologically--of belief
conflicts."

So now you are able to help a client resolve inner belief conflicts through
astology! What a claim! And without one single peer reviewed journal article
in support of this ability. More psychotherapy is described on your
"business" site.

"Consultations.consist of an exploration of the early environment and
parental relationship. This establishes for the client and counselor, the
belief structure base from which all further delineation must proceed."

What are the therapeutic goals of this astrological psychotherapy? The
benefits are offered as:

(1)   An understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the belief system
one has been taught.

(2)   Insight into how these belief systems have created conflict or
difficulty in the past.

(3)   How one's needs psychologically have been formed from these beliefs
and insight into fulfillment and resolution of them.

You then have a whole page dedicated to the  DSM IV (which normally would
not be posted on an astrology site), but you give your reason clearly as.

"to assist the reader in clearer understanding of the [astrological
consulting] material presented. Key points of diagnostic explainations (sic)
are highlighted with asterisks."

You choose to only give the reader cut and paste definitions for (1)
Dependent Personality Disorder (2) Obsessive~Compulsive Disorder (3)
Paranoid Personality Disorder and (4) Delusional Disorder.

The reason for selecting only these disorders among the 1000s given in the
DSM IV are unclear. Nor has the author presented any professional training
of the ability to diagnose said disorders. The reader is left to believe
that these four disorders are somehow unusually relevant to the
"art/science/religion/psychotherapy" practice of so called "astrological
consulting."  You do give a disclaimer that you offer what we call case
management referral:

"Conflicts requiring therapy or psychological treatment will be referred to
clinicians"

Ed, precisely what criteria will you use to determine when to abruptly cease
the astrological consulting session and refer the "client" to a colleague
specialist in "the helping professions." Do you have a referral relationship
with a Psychiatrist?  Do you share a practice with a Psy.D. down the hall to
whom you refer clients in those critical moments where Astrological
consulting can no longer can help them?

You are want to attack me and my knowledge of astrology. But my knowledge of
astrology is "off topic" Ed, and you want t know why?  Because all I asked
you for was some support in the professional literature for the "Six Love
Styles" theory. Instead of giving me any evidence of a quantitative
analysis, you went on the attack for reasons that are unclear...asking me to
come back when I am more educated.

But I am not telling you that you are wrong Edmond. Instead I only ask
questions that you apparently do not wish to answer or confront. If you are
going to collect money for consulting services, you had better be prepared
to supply empirical evidence of the value you present, OR, you had better go
the route of the Scientologist, whose sessions sound exactly like your
description of "Belief re-programming" that goes on in your consulting
sessions.  Think of the bright side of admitting your practice is a
religion.you can go tax exempt this way!  8^D
