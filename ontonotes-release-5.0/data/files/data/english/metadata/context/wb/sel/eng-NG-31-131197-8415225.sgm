Thusday August 23, 2007.  Well, Justin is moving into his new place  tomorrow
right after the closing and he is so excited.  My dance friend,  Lori Cheek,
did a great job as his real estate agent so if you ever need a  realtor in the
Tampa Bay area, I can vouch she did a great job for  him.   Keep your fingers
crossed that the closing goes well.  I  never believe they are over until
they are over.  I'm wondering how the  psycho cat, Kozmo, is going to take the
move.  It took him months to get  used to being here and deciding that I was an
acceptable human being but now he  is my best friend and sits on the back of
my chair -- still won't let anyone  hold him -- but he will allow me to pet him
and brush him and feed him anything  I'm eating.  He loves chicken and ice
cream and comes sliding into the  kitchen every time I'm in there.  It's so
funny.  I can hear him  running from wherever he has decided to roost that day
(and it IS a new place  every single day.  I can't tell you how many times I've
been in a panic  thinking he got out somehow and then will find him in some
strange place).   He will slide from one end of the kitchen to the other and then
does this big,  demanding YOWLLLLLLLL I WANT SOME TOO!!!  He will have a nice
porch to sit  on at Justin's house and a neighbor gave Justin a nice rocking
chair they didn't  want to use any more and Kozmo has already claimed that as
his own.  Of  course, it's wood and I wonder how long it's going to be in one
piece but so far  so good.  Lucy is going to be much happier with Kozmo goes
because she will  be out of her cage 24-7 like she was before.  She has been
very put out  about not having the run of the house but I just never trusted
Kozmo with the  bird.  Justin promised that now that he bought a house he would
start  looking for a wife!!!  We'll see but he's a great roommate and I know he
will be a great husband and father someday, too.   I would like it to  be
before I'm too old to pick up a  grandchild!!

I just wanted to say what a terrific time I had at Wow # 2 this past  weekend.
We all got to meet allot of new people and catch up with old  friends.
It’s great to know that you can look forward each year to meeting  up
with your Family Dance Friends. (what a great reunion it was)
We all  really look forward to it. A lot of laughs &amp; good times.
Cheers to Betsy  who really was a trooper in her temp wheelchair.
I will not forget the great  laughs we had at dinner Sat night (you all know
who you are).
I was  especially glad to get a chance to meet Rachel and Joey for the first
time.
How great are they. GI Joe rocked. Hey Joe, Do you have any bones in that
body?
The show was terrific and they all were really amazing dancers and
entertainers.
The group of instructors kept the momentum upbeat and moving  the whole time.
Thank you again for a great weekend, I look forward to 2008  dance reunion #

Subject: Andy Eddy's reviews
From:sandh ... @suddenlink.net

I just wanted to let Andy  Eddy (and all dance teachers that send in reviews)
know what a great job I think  he did with his dance reviews in the last
newsletter. They were short, concise,  nicely spaced, and gave me all I need to
know when I'm looking for a new dance  to teach. It was nice to know how they
went over with his classes as well. I  hope he continues to send in his reviews.

SUBJECT: JUDY CHEN'S WOW EVENT
FROM: Steve Lescarbeau

I wanted to thank Judy for inviting me to instruct at  this year's WOW event
at the very accommodating Marriott Newark Airport Hotel  from August 16 - 19.
To be in the company of such greats as Max Perry, Kathy  Hunyadi, John
Robinson, JoAnn Brady, Barry and Dari Ann Amato, Doug and Jacki  Miranda, Racheal
McEneany, Guyton Mundy, Scott Blevins, Joey Warren, and Bryan  McWherter, was
such an honor! A huge thank you goes out to all of you who took  my classes and
requested them in open dance. SOME PEOPLE was such a big hit I  had to teach it
twice. My new beginner dance ONE OF THE BOYS was taught after  CREEK ALLEY,
but we used a much more fun song than on the step sheet. Please try  ONNE OF
THE BOYS to Brad Paisley's ONLINE. We had a lot of fun doing it and even  those
who didn't take the class were on the floor in open dancing quickly  picking
it up. Great bar/club dance to teach. It was nice to put faces with some  of
the regional instructors names like Mike Cohen and Ellen Keirnan. There were
several more instructors I met, but I apologize for not being able to remember
everyone's names. I love to chat with everyone, especially instructors to see
how their classes are and what they are teaching. These dance events are fun
because of the people who go to them. As an event director myself I
understand  how hard it is to make everyone happy and pull off a successful event. I
can say  that Judy did a great job in putting together this event. I hope she
does do it  again so I can come back, even if it's as a paying guest!
No one has really  mentioned the show on Saturday night. ORDER THE VIDEO!
Mark my words this video  will be a CLASSIC for years to come. The story is about
a nighttime janitor  (Doug Miranda) names Wally who invites you into his toy
store after hours to  witness majic as some toys to come to life at night. The
toys were
MAX PERRY  &amp; KATHY HUNYADI - Ragedy Andy and Ragedy Ann
GUYTON MUNDY - Spiderman
RACHAEL MCENEANY - Cat Woman
BARRY AND DARIANN AMATO - Ken and Barbie
JACKIE MIRANDA - Tinkerbell
JOANN BRADY - Teddy Bear
JOEY WARREN -  GI Joey
BRYAN MCWHERTER - Sponge Bob Square Pants
JOHN ROBINSON - Mr.  Potato Head.
You will laugh for hours watching this show which lasted almost  an hour!
Thanks again for your support.

SUBJECT:   WHAT KAREN STURMEY IS TEACHING IN THE UK

DOG &amp; BONE KATE SALA, MUSIC TRACY LAWRENCE OR ERR  my fave all time country
music singer, what could i do but teach it. class liked  it as well. liked both
the dance and a lot said how nice the music was.
week  1 BIG LOVE ROBBIE MCGOWAN HICKIE. MUSIC GEORGE STRAIT. this was taught
while i  was on hols in june and somehow slipped through the net, played it at
our social  on saturday night and all our classes were sat down, so teaching
it to all  classes this week, they all luv it as well., very easy little dance
with a  catchy little song.
WEEK 2 BIG SPENDER last week was a 50% some did and some  didnt like it. gave
it a 2nd go this week, 39 sat down, 22 get up for the dance.  will see what
happens next week,
WEEK 3 COUNTRY GIRL ROB FOWLER MUSIC RISSI  PALMER. not sure if this music is
readily avaiable yet or not. mine is on a cdx.  big big hit in all classes.
at the social sat it was on the request list and did  fill the floor.
WEEK 4 REBEL AMORE this dance is packing the floor locally  everywhere i go
and at my own classes its very very popular.
WEEK 3 ROCK  THIS PARTY. this dance has caused me a fair bit of grief over
the last 2 weeks.  as you know our area nottinghgam is very very healthy and we
have a lot of  classes and socials. within my own classes i do have a % who do
travel around  the local circuit and further afield. rock this party is on
our dance floors  locally, and some of mine wanted to learn. it. i played the
music in all classes  the week before my first teach to see how many wanted to
learn it. in total just  34 did, so we took the route of teaching it after
classes had finished , so  those who wanted to learn it could, and those who didnt
had their normal class  the hard core dancers are happy they are dancing it
out and about,

SUBJECT:  WHAT GRAHAM AND KATHY ARE TEACHING IN THE  UK
This week we went with a dance released at MIL Event and  also taught at Big
Daves Sunday Out Paul McAdams RISE AND FALL 32 counts 2 walls  Intermediate
Nightclub 2 step no tags no restarts Music Rise and fall by Craig  David and
Sting. Really like the music and the dance a lot faster than you think  it
appears to be. Class really struggled with this dance proved to be a very  tricky
dance for some reason, maybe for the different steps involved in it.  Think we
would say this is leaning towards more Advance dance. Personally really  like
this one.
Recapped AIN'T GOT NO MONEY a really funky from Neville and  Julie only 32
counts no tags no restarts Killer on the knees if your age is  starting to show,
everyone stayed up for this one again this week. Which to be  honest thought
it would be a bit to funky for most of our class, but Graham did  video with
some styling for the older dancer, (helps you rise up a bit easier)  going
really well.
Also recapped HEY BIG SPENDER by Jo and John Kinser a fun  dance easy and
first taught at our social.
Video for Rise and Fall later as  UTube down at the moment.

In Big Dave's report from  World Masters last week he mentioned a dance
Rachael taught that was well liked  called &quot;Fuego&quot;. I just found the step sheet on
Rachael's website and was  surprised to find it was choreographed by Shane
Sparks (SYTYCD). Here's a video  I found on YouTube.

SUBJECT:  DANCES THIS WEEK
FROM:  BIG  DAVE

Just a reminder that we've  a 17th birthday party social this Bank Holiday
Monday at Hinckley - All welcome.
Our current Beginner/Improver dance is Rob's Country Girl - Cool Two Step,
great country &amp; going really well - Also did it as a quick teach for the
Intermediaties in the change-over slot from Beginners to Intermediate on Tusday  &amp;
they enjoyed it too - Recent (new) beginner dances going well also include
Sharon's Dance Tonight, My New Life, Alfie &amp; Bop The B - The classics still
rule for the beginners though - Most recently Fly Like A Bird, Live Laugh Love,
Wishful Thinking, Walkin' The Line, I Just Wanna Dance, Midnight Waltz, Jazzy
Joes &amp; King Of The Road !! :-) ...... Not really 'beginners' but my
'Improvers' can handle all these ok.
On Tuesday - Well as much as Kate's  Saturn 5 was the hit of Masters I
thought that her Silver Moon, that I saw with  Kate the week before at TSWRA, would
be more appreciated by my Tuesday crowd  &amp; they did like it - Difficult teach
though beacuse whilst the steps are  really cool there are a number of
sequences that start with a back rock &amp; so  you can easily get mixed up - We'll see
next week whether they get over this or  if it puts them off - Next week
someone asked me about Rachael's Charango - On  my to-do list so I'll do that one -
Also doing a late-bird teach of Guardian  Angel by request - The Tuesday class
is easy-intermediate thru solid  intermediate but by request I'm going to do
one late-bird higher advanced dance  each month for those that want to go the
extra mile - Not funky - Just harder  Mainline. Hit teaches recently on a
Tuesday include Sunday Morning Girl, Ride  The River, Zjozzy's, Celebration, Here
&amp; Now, Love Today, Crystal Clear  &amp; Maggie's NIMBY/CT Girl -------- Favourites
include A Gigolo, Not Like  That, Time 2 Fly &amp; Bridge Over Troubled Water
.................... Need to  check out Jo &amp; John's Hey Big Spender - Seen lots
of good feedback on that  one.
On Wednesday - T&amp;V's Follow Me Home was a hit at our Fun In The Sun  a few
weeks back &amp; quite a few dancing it at our Sunday-Out too - Another  lovely
night club which went really well with the class, as did Pau's Rise &amp;  Fall last
week - Dan's smooth funky one Let's Get Saved is a smash hit, as is  Dee's
lovely smooth Cha Cha One Heart To Many - Fuego is a smash hit too (I'm  too old &amp;
fat for these ones but I'm hanging in there !! :-) ---- Favourites  include
Burning, Guardian Angel, Give It Back &amp; Make You Wanna - We recaped  Guyton's
Time To Get Up &amp; Scott's Bidness this - Not sure about the new one  next week
yet - Cadillac Ride &amp; Drop The Heat will be the Guyton revision.
Instructors out there please support my Teaching Survey
