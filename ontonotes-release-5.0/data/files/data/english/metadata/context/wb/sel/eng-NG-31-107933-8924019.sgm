Rod ends in single shear

Folks:

First let me say that I know well that everything is supposed to be in
double shear.  Lord knows I have busted my butt to make sure
everything is in double shear.

But.

I have a portion of my aileron circuit that has a fork fitting to
provide the requisite double shear.  However the bolt hole in the
crank is seeing some misalignment and is starting to wallow the hole.
I really, really should replace the fork fitting with a rod end (i.e.
it never should have been a fork fitting to begin with, it was a spur-
of-the-moment fix that was really just a band-aid).  But the crank
being driven by the fork is going to be impossible to replace with a
two-armed crank that can nest a rod end.

So, I am faced with the possibility of using a rod end in single
shear.  I know that this is viewed as being undesirable, as the
bearing can be popped out of the eye under certain conditions.  I also
know that the traditional trick to compensate for this is to use a 970
washer (large area washer) on the outer end of the bolt holding the
rod end, such that if the bearing leaves the eye the washer prevents
the rod from departing the scene.

Now, with all of that said, here's my question: How bad is it really
to have the rod end in single shear if I do the washer trick?  It's an
aileron rod, I do not think it sees much load at all--certainly far,
far short of it's rated load.  I have seen several planes out there
with rod ends in single shear, so it can't be complete suicide . . .
right?  No?

Thank you for your thoughts.

Steve.

The single arm may not have the resistance to twisting that
the two arms do together. You'd want to compare single-arm setups with
what you have. An arm that allows twisting will eventually fail or
might allow enough aileron play to start flutter. Both are bad news.

True, nut not necessarily the whole story, Ed.

Because there is a small moment due to the off-axis pushrod, the
arm itself could flex.

If the arm is really thin metal (as possible if a sheet steel part
were used) it MIGHT be possible to excite the  aileron system -
ie: cause flutter.

I'm really not sure I understand where you're coming from, but by arms

The horns on the Dyke Delta are .100 4130.  The prototype had flown for
over 40 years.  If the horn was thin enough to deform from the rod end
being in single shear, it will bend just as much in double shear.  There
is room for twist in the rod end even with both sides captured.

My claim might need some clarifying, Ed.

The horns I have are .100.  If I add another .100 horn to the other side
to make it double shear, I don't have the same equivalent .100.  I even
have more that just doubling the single shear horn .200, because
seperating the sides would makes the horn stiffer.  The stiffness
doesn't come from the rod being in double shear. It comes from extra
structural material.  If I just wrapped the hook around to pick up the
other side of the rod end, the horn wouldn't be any stiffer, and the rod
end would still be floating on the center ball.

Seems to me I have seen bell cranks on both Pitts
Specials and Christen Eagles. They appeared to be no thicker than
.0625 and were in double shear as you describe. They must have held up
pretty good considering the stresses imposed on them in unllimited
aerobatics.

One thing I haven't seen mentioned is the length of the bell crank
arm or horns. I would assume a longer throw would require thicker
material assuming similar material.

Aerobatic planes have light control forces.  It's the tugboats that you
have to yank with both arms to perceive any movement at all that put the
most stress on the control linkages.  The Pitts, et al, all have the
weight forces precariously balance on top of the lift forces, such that
the slightest pressure sends them tumbling one way or the other.
