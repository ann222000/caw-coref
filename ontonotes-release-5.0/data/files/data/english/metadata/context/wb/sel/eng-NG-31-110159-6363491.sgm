can anyone tell me if there is a pub in city centre Liverpool with
decent cider. I'm there on a work trip for a few days next week and
couldn't find anything in the pub guide - I looked under the Cheshire
&amp; Lancs listing which I thought would've covered it - am I being
stupid &amp; looking in the wrong place?

Look under Merseyside but safe bets are Head of Steam Lime St Station, Ship &amp; Mitre Dale St, Fly in the Loaf Hardman St, Swan Wood St. Baltic Fleet Wapping (opposite Albert Dock) and the Cracke in Rice Street

I know Liverpool's in Merseyside, but I'm buggered if I can find
Merseyside listed here: http://ukcider.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Cider_Pub_Guide
I would have expected to find it under North England which is why I
inspected the Cheshire &amp; the Lancs sections and its not listed either
under the alphabetical list of counties.
But thanks for the pub names.

I've been talking to cider-seeking folks at my farmers' market beer
stalls on Merseyside recently &amp; it seems there are a few local cider
selling pubs. Ads in current Merseyale seem to mainly concur with DH
above.

*Ship &amp; Mitre, 133 Dale Street (nr Bhead Tunnel entrance &amp; flyover) -
apparently has 5 real ciders on.

*Dispensary (Cain's pub), Renshaw Street has 1 cider;
(I once asked a taxi-driver to take me to Renshaw St, &amp; he knew it
only as "Rapid Hardware Street"!)

*Baltic Fleet, Wapping has 1 real cider on, &amp; is a cracking brewpub
too.

*Lion Tavern, 67 Moorfields, nr Station - 1 cider on, plus lovely
Edwardian gem of a pub.

good luck!

The only way I could find the listing DH mentions was by doing a
separate keyword search for "Liverpool" (as Joe says, there's no
Merseyside or Liverpool link in the main pubs list).  Only 1 result
turns up which begins "No cider pubs reported in Liverpool or
Merseyside yet!" before listing as "safe bets" the pubs DH mentioned.

There's really only one reason why there's no proper listing on the wiki for
Liverpool. No one has added one yet! The wiki relies on the members to add
their knowledge - no knowledge = no wiki listing.
So hopefully when someone comes back from Liverpool they will add their
findings to the wiki. Oh and perhaps create a page for Merseyside. There was
no point having one if we'd nothing to put on it :-)
All the best

Fairy nuff. So I guess the "safe bets" were indirect recommendations
from elsewhere on the web, etc?

Next time I'm in any of the 'pool pubs I will try to get some up-to-
date info.

Another source for info, Joe, might be uk.food+drink.real-ale or the
forum on the Liverpool CAMRA site?

Apparently a few pubs tried out having some polypin cider on the bar
after the local CAMRA branch tried to drum some interest during real
cider week last year - Pilgrim, Pilgrim St, plus Dispensary &amp; Lion, &amp;
if memory serves the Cracke does do real cider too.

Well.....I must be going mad.....when I didn't see a separate listing
for Merseyside last week, I did look under lancs &amp; manchester and I
SWEAR on my life it WASN'T there.........it is now. Spooky Wiki
jiggery pokery? Never mind, I had jotted down the list supplied by DH
&amp; found my way to the Fly in the Loaf where they had Thatchers Gold
and then on to Ye Cracke where they had a Biddendens dry cider in a
cask @ 8% - very nice; so nice, in fact, I went there for my 2nd
night. I'd forgotten it had been mentioned they usually have a perry
so didn't ask and its presence wasn't obvious - anyway, I wouldn't
have chanced it - I like perry but the sorbitol doesn't like me!
Thanks for all the tips one and all.

For any noncommercial cidermakers who might be interested,  information
about the AHA National Homebrew Competition may be found via links at
http://www.beertown.org/events/nhc/index.html .   Entries must be bottled.
According to information available at that website entries are due between
April 2 and 13.  Cider judging will be done separately in one day on Sunday,
April 22 (though results won't be released until after beer and mead judging
are completed in June).   Although the name of the competition says
"National" please note that according to the site linked above international
entries are eligible.

So Joe - how did you get on? I was drinking on Dale Street last night
(for research porpoises only) - Lion Tavern had bottled Thatchers &amp;
polypin Weston's 'Scrumpy' (Old Rosie, I guess?) - which I persuaded 2
or 3 members of the Liverpool Inventors Club  to drink!

The Ship&amp;Mitre had some fantastic beers (especially Titanic 'Black
Ice') &amp; the first night of an open mic session in the newly refurbed
upstairs art deco bar, but also 2 real ciders - one advertised as
Gaythams/Raythams (possibly misspelled Gaymers?) plus Addlestone's
which I know is owned by Gaymer's but, as an inexperienced cider
drinker, was really very nice (my tastebuds / tooth-enamel can't
handle the super dry ones &amp; this was nicely appley &amp; well-balanced to
me).
