I've recently picked up an old book that had obviously been exposed to
moisture for a period of time. What is an effective way to eliminate the
musty odor? Fresh air outside? Can the cover distortion be straightened?
Weight?

TIA,
Rich

Hello Rich,

Sometimes you can never get rid of the smell but try any or all of these three
methods:

* Put the book in the freezer for a couple of weeks. That will kill any live
organisms.

* Place the book in a box with kitty litter and baking soda, 1 bag litter to 1
box soda. Cover the book with the mixture and seal the box. Let it marinate
for a couple of weeks.

* Sprinkle athlete's foot powder between the pages of the book. Seal in a box
for a couple of weeks.

It's important that you do not place the musty book in contact with any good
books because the condition will spread. First get rid of the problem if you
can. If you can't get rid of it, you might have to sell it at a yard sale
outdoors where the smell is not obvious. Price it low.

I'm a rare book dealer and have tried these methods with varying degrees of
success. You will learn never to buy such a book in the first place.

Regards,
Ellen

Rich,

I have several books like this old bibles, animal related books,
periodicals, etc. I just keep mine in a dry place away from moisture. If
you really have a problem with the smell of mildew I know sun helps to
kill the spores of the mildew but it might also damage your book in the
sense of fading it. I often just buy my books as is and leave them the
way I bought them and try my best to preserve them in their
existing condition.

Regards,
Kathleen

Ellen,

This is good advice, thank you, I do have one book that smells a bit off
and today I bought several books from the mid to late 1800's and was
caught in a major downpour and was really worried about the books having
gotten a little wet but they seem fine so far. They were in a paper bag
covered with part of the jacket I was wearing.

Regards,
Kathleen

"/> Great advice, Ellen!

Now I have a question. I have some very old sheet music which is badly
foxed. Is there anything that can be done to remove or lighten the
foxing? I thought perhaps a little rub with some baking soda, but I
don't want to damage the music anymore than it is...

RAGards,

Tracy
