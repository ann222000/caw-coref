The Virginia House of Delegate 2005 Election web blog is morphing
into a three-ring political circus with the latest celebrity post by
'not jim gilmore'...

Virginia House of Delegates 2005 Elections

'not jim gilmore' wrote: "That's 41 Pro-Virginia, 35 Anti-Virginia
and 3 fingers in the wind. With 21 seats left, everyone needs to be very
aware that we have not won this election yet."

Blue Dog question of the day: Is that a one-finger salute?

Earlier this week, celebrity bloggers, Dem House of Delegate
candidate David Englin and 'Pub anti-tax Senator Ken Cuccenilli, both
back off early commitments. The Blue Dog's congressional source, 'Dry
Throat,' alerted me to candidate David Englin and wife blogflogging 'not
larry sabato' -- Apparently, 'NLS' fibbed about these celebrity
bloggers...

Who are the web log anonymous posters -- 'not larry sabato' AND 'not
jim gilmore'? Any thoughts, or comments?

The Blue Dog's best guess for the anonymous bloggers...

Probable identity of 'not larry sabato': Washington Post writers and
Warner sycophant twins, Michael Shear and Chris Jenkins... Or RT-D
columnist Jeff 'good copy' Schapiro (But if we take him at his word, NLS
says he resides in Chesterfield County).

Probable identity of 'not jim gilmore': Delegate Gary Reese.

The Blue Dog's favorite 'Pub buddy Red Dog (who serves in the GA
House) wrote: "Delegate Reese is not that computer kind of guy so he is
not larry sabato. His style is more Shear than Schapiro...NLS is more
like a real reporter. Not jim gilmore IS probably preston bryant."

But CC guest blogger, Norm 'one mans trash' Leahy wrote: "Not Jim
Gilmore, I believe, is Preston Bryant," but posted that it could be the
'Pub court jester, Russ Potts.

Commonwealth Conservative » I’m Anti-Virginia, How ‘Bout You?

Another fellow Bacon' Bits blogger wrote, "It seems like Not Larry
Sabato has gone from premier political prognosticator to rumor monger
central in one week. Don't quite understand ...."

On the identity of 'not jim gilmore', he wrote: "I have no clue. I
think all this has taken anonymous posting too far and is giving
blogging a bad name."

The real question is this: What's the real identity of CC's John
Behan?

I confess to being the Bacon blogger quoted in the above Blue Dog
post.

I don't make any claim to be the conscience of Virginia blogging, the
policeman, or anything else, but I did suggest a blog code of ethics
some time back, an idea met with resounding silence. Now comments on
anonymous blogs are filled with ethical charges and counter-charges made
by equally anonymous posters. They matter because they reflect on real
people in the public square.

The rise of "Not X" anonymous blogs and comments, where X=someone
well-known, seems to me to be a particularly pernicious form of
anonymity. I've defended anonymous blogging in the past, but I am
rethinking my position.

Until just after the June primary, I was as big a fan of the Virginia
Delegate 2005 Elections blog as there was, but now I really feel this
blog has turned its back on what made it so compelling.

BTW, Washington Post reporter Michael Shear was asked if he is
blogging under another name, but he has not replied:

It may be useful to point out that not all anonymous bloggers are
alike. People who blog anonymously to be snarky--as opposed to people
who blog anonymous and happen once in a while to be snarky but at least
own up to their momentary snarkiness--seem a shady sort.

I don't compare myself to Publius by any stretch of the imagination,
but the consistent use of a pseudonym in place of one's real name should
be regarded differently when compared to the creation of multiple or
contradictory pseudonyms for the purpose of distancing oneself and one's
"online reputation"--whether attributable to oneself directly or merely
to one's consistently-used online pseudonym--from a snarky statement.

Oh, and back to "Not Jim Gilmore": When I first read the post, I came
to the conclusion that NJG could not possibly be a member of the Gang of
15/17/19 because his comments were so counterproductive. Not only are
the terms (i.e., "anti-Virginia") unfamiliar to those within the Gang
but they appear overtly and deliberately crafted to provoke an
oppositional response. Either NJG is tactically stupid, or NJG is a
plant to rouse the ire of the opposition.

As for NJG, the writing is very, very sloppy. I mean, extraordinarily
sloppy. I'll take NLS on his word that whomever is writing is a
delegate, but it's sloppy allright.

Personally, NLS has done a rather remarkable thing -- capitalize on
100 races people want to comment and chime in on. It all under one hood,
and NLS has received quite a bit of play for his hard work. Tracking all
those delegate races has got to be a time consuming job.

As for whom NJG might be? A delegate with nothing left to lose would
be a close start. As for NLS, I'll respect his decision to be anonymous
for no other reason than he has brought something new to the table, and
thus is credible in my eyes. His (or her) reasons for posting under a
pseudonym should be their own.

'Til something more serious happens, I'll kick back and let others
complain about NLS stealing thunder. I get the feeling that is what most
of the criticism ultimately stems from.

The web log anonymous poster is probably 'not Gay Jay Timmons'.

Just ask yourself why did George Allen hire someone lacking any
degrees and place him in such high level jobs? Does George Allen live in
a log Cabin? Actually Timmons grew up in the Log Cabin syrup home place.

Jay Timmons serves as Senior Director for Tew Cardenas' Public
Advocacy Group in Washington, DC. Serving in senior leadership positions
in government at both the state and federal level, he brings over 20
years of experience and knowledge to the firm, WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE.

Prior to joining Tew Cardenas, Jay was the senior aide to U.S.
Senator George Allen (R-VA) for 14 years. Appointed by Allen as
Executive Director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee
(NRSC) for the 2004 election cycle, he served as a valuable member of
the Senate Republican Leadership staff, advising Senators and their
senior aides WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE on policy and campaign issues.
Working in conjunction with the Bush Cheney 2004 Presidential campaign
and the White House Office of Political Affairs, Jay led successful
efforts to strengthen the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate to its
largest margin since 1928, with the GOP now holding 55 seats. WITHOUT A
COLLEGE DEGREE

Jay was Chief of Staff in Allen's Senate office prior to his NRSC
post. There he managed the office and legislative priorities of the
Senator, who served as Chairman of the U.S. Senate High Tech Task Force
and as a member of the Commerce, Small Business and Foreign Affairs
Committees, WHILE CRUSING GAY BARS.

As Allen's Chief of Staff in the Virginia Governor's Office, Jay was
the youngest in state history to hold that post, WITHOUT A QUALIFYING
COLLEGE DEGREE. In this capacity, he served as the state's Chief
Operating Officer managing the development and implementation of the
Commonwealth's $35 billion biennial budget WITHOUT WORKING FOR H & R
BLOCK. Jay oversaw the management of over 85,000 executive branch
employees, including a successful employee buyout program, which
assisted in reducing the state government workforce by 10% during his
tenure. He was also the Governor's chief liaison with members of the
General Assembly and, as the lead member of the Governor's Cabinet, he
managed and directed the day-to-day administration of the Cabinet and
state agencies, BLOCKING KNOWLEDGEABLE DELEGATES ACCESS TO THE GOVERNOR.

Jay was also Allen's Chief of Staff in the U.S. House and held senior
management posts in Allen's state and federal campaigns. He has been
involved in numerous public policy and communications roles, including:

Deputy Director of Public Affairs for the White House Conference on
Information Services during the administration of President George H.W.
Bush.

Communications Field Advisor for the Republican National Committee.

Communications Director for Congressman Alex McMillan (R-NC).

Jay has been cited in Roll Call newspaper as one of the (GAY)
fabulous 50 Movers and Shakers behind the scenes on Capitol Hill,"
citing "Know How" and "Access." He serves as a member of the Board of
Directors of the National Center for Public Policy Research(LISTED AS
ONE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE 501 C3 CLOSELY TIED TO TOM DELAY) and the
Board of Directors of Local Finance Solutions, Inc.

Areas of Practice: WITHOUT ANY DEGREE IN POLITICAL SCIENCE,
Governmental

As for being clinically insane, how about George Allen for hiring Jay
Timmons?

Way to go, Mr. Blue Dog! Keep up the good work, and maybe FoxNews
will hire you.

Friends, who are connected to Kaine's campaign, say 'not larry
sabato' true identity is a dual one -- WaPo Michael Shear and RT-D Jeff
Schapiro. But I don't think there's room enough on the web log for both
egos.

A GOP friend can't imagine those two egos working together either.
And believes it's most likely WaPo's Michael Shear. It reads more like
him, but there were hints of Chris Jenkins.

For the record, I believe Chris Jenkins is a liberal idiot. Shear is
Mark Warner's best boy and sycophant deluxe. Sorry, I'm being truthful,
not mean.

Who is Jay Timmons?

I think I fall somewhere close to the Jaded JD school of thought.

Anonymous bloggers are fine, as long as they are not going around
making personal attacks on others.

But, problems arise when they say things while cloaked with anonymity
that they would not have said with their own name.

More often than before, we are seeing anonymous bloggers say crazy
things that they surely would not have said otherwise.

The posts referenced by Steve are good examples.

For the record, I don't work for Senator Frist.

I'm a capitol hill lobbyist.

For your information, George Allen, Rudi Giuliani and John McCain are
posturing for a run for the Oval Office.

Gay Jay Timmons hasn't really helped George since the Blade outed
him. There's more and more talk about Allens' first marriage and
divorce. The divorce records are sealed and nobody seems to be able to
find out the cause for the action and what his first wife's name is. He
was divorced in the eighties and Gay Jay has been with him ever since.
Is Timmons, Allen's live in lover?

Don't ask, don't tell.

By the way, when Guilliani was Mayor of New York, he moved a
mysterious male into Gracie Mansion after the divorce. Rudi Giuliani had
sacked the "First Lady of New York" for a male Queen posing as a
"personal secretary."

Don't ask, don't tell.

If you thought the Swiftees were united just wait until 2008, that is
if McCain is still alive. Over the winter, McCain returned from London
with an attitude. The question is did he go for cell therapy or was he
having a meeting at Chatham House, or both? Winter Solstice? Not yet.
With the kind of Melanoma McCain has, it requires desperate acts by
desperate people. Even steroids wouldn't help.

Don't ask, don't tell.

I see London, I see France, I see McCain's wet underpants.

Girls notice those things.

Dry Throat is quite capable of conforming to the blog social
standards, whatever that means? Although the term of insanity is a way
of attempting to render Dry Throat incapable of making a right or wrong
comment, it only encourages and inflames an irresistible impulse to put
down the left which is always "never right."

In the case of Allen, Guilliani and McCain, the right sometimes
drifts in the left lane, asleep at the wheel.

Many anonymous bloggers are looking for conservative political
kinmanship. Most obviously gave up on the democratic party when they
started reading the Bible scriptures and then converted to the
republican party. I have found many liberal suburban parents, who are so
locked in with their educational goals for their children, that they
lose sight of who really needs to be educated, or re-educated when it
comes to the socialistic paradigm and the current state of our country.

Can a blogger use techniques that will convince another blogger of
someone's mental state?

Probably not, unless that one blogger has access to other bloggers to
support the ruse. To convince readers that Dry Throat is clinically
insane would require the effort of a number of anonymous bloggers who
know absolutely nothing about a criminal defense much less clinical
psychology.

You know, there is a weird undertone through all these political
blogs.

Isn't that American Psycho enough?

Dry Throat, we welcome your participation in the Bacon's Rebellion
blog in the discussion of politics, public policy and/or economic
development. As a Washington lobbyist, you bring insider knowledge and
interesting perspectives to bear on Virginia politics. However, this
blog is not the proper forum to spread rumor and innuendo about
politicians' sexual preferences.

I would insist upon keeping discussion of affairs, divorces, sexual
preferences, etc. out of Bacon's Rebellion unless (1) it bears upon the
job performance of a public figure, and (2) is based on hard evidence --
basically, the same criteria it would take to get such topics into a
newspaper. The musings about Allen and Giuliani that you have posted on
this blog have met neither criteria -- and the Timmons allegations are a
stretch.

Again, I reiterate that I am happy to have you participate in Bacon's
Rebellion as long as you are addressing issues pertaining to Virginia
politics and policy. I will delete future comments that violate the
no-sexual-innuendo rule.

Mr. Bacon,

Yours is usually a site that provides for excellent discussion of
relevant issues. I have however noticed a trend developing over the past
few months. Whenever steven sisson lets loose with one of his "opinions"
the floodgates seem to then be opened to irrelevance. Why do you
continue to allow such emptiness to soil your site? I don't always agree
with your opinions, but you think them through and sometimes with
additional information have accepted a differing view than your original
position. You have provided perspective that has done the same for me.
Sisson provides nothing to your publication more than the hyperbole that
is usually reserved for the supermarket checkout "news rack" where one
can find stories about elvis being married to saddam or michael jackson
being an alien from mars.

Please exercise editorial prerogative and remove sisson's meaningless
rants from your otherwise excellent publication. Please understand that
before sisson goes into his next rant over being persecuted and
threatened that I am doing neither. I am merely pointing out that when
he is included into most any discussion about most any topic, the level
of discussion is almost immediately diminished to a great degree, and
doesn't seem to recover. His sole purpose seems to be to trivialize and
belittle and bump off track any serious discussion your other
"responsible" bloggers attempt. On another level, his "facts" are almost
always wrong and when challenged regarding their veracity he runs away
into victim land. If your site were a classroom steven would be made to
sit in the hallway and stop bothering the other students.

I completely agree with Jim Bacon's 6:23 am post and Michele Meyer's
7:37 am post. Dry Throat and Blue Dog don't add meaning to discussions.
Blue Dog should get his own blog, if he wants to be read/heard. Dry
Throat should stick to hers.

Background: Blue Dog ran for state office in the Shenandoah Valley a
few years back and wasn't happy with the support he got from Mark
Warner. His bitterness over this often shows up in his posts and also
demonstrates perhaps why Warner didn't cough up the dough. There's
enough immaturity in Richmond already. Why send more?

Most of the posters here seem to know a thing or two and not to be
overly motivated by ego. Thanks for the great work!

Save for the stuff about an Allen/Timmons liaison, I've heard the
same stuff about the latter for years, from impeccable sources. And I've
been called "homophobic" by homophiliacs more times than I can count.

With that having been said, I'm trying to understand why either
Timmons (alleged) perversions or his lack of a college degree have
anything to do with the performance of his duties. I don't like the guy
for his role in the dishonesty which is and has been the modus operandi
of the Young Republican Federation of Virginia for decades, and his role
in it during his participation. But, as Jim Bacon points out, so long as
he doesn't pursue the radical homosexual agenda in his role as an Allen
operative or otherwise, I don't think that perversion is a fair point of
attack. Just as his lack of a college degree not a fair point of attack
so long as he is an effective and loyal Allen operative. I suspect if
either were to become an issue, he wouldn't be an Allen operative for
long.

And Michelle, it wasn't Elvis who was married to Saddam. It's Satan
who made the latter his boy toy (see the South Park movie).

he's the rare writer who can be funny AND insightful. And James Young,
you're right, Timmons' sexual orientation and education level aren't
urgently important.

Phew! This afternoon, I checked out of a valley hospital.

On his day off, the Blue Dog had a bicycle wreck near the City of
Lexington. Some tall, lanky bleach-blonde guy, who had a lot of press
coverage, sycophant's deluxe and Dem special ops, deliberately ran me
off the road on his way to the White House.

Hmm... Looks like the dog has been hit and 'sheared' on Bacon's road
as well.

Michelle and Jim: Apparently, the Blue Dog's readership doesn't agree
with your post -- and the politicos interview with the Blue Dog for a
reason. Understand, it's a numbers game. And jealously is an ugly thing.

Anon: Again -- Please get over it. I'm not running for elected
