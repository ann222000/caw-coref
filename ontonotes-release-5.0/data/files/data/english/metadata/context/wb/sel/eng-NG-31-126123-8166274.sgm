Here in this age we live in it seems like nearly everyone and their
brother are posting their songs on the internet.  In some cases these
are songs they wrote themselves.  I have a feeling that few of these
people have actually bothered to copyright their songs.  Is there a
real danger of being ripped off when people post their songs on the
internet to get some exposure?  Or by posting their songs do they
inherently make some legal claim of ownership?

I'm sure most of the people who do this probably don't take music that
seriously to begin with, but I can't help but be curious about it.
Thus far I've resisted the temptation to post music of my own on the
internet for the reasons listed above, but maybe I'm just missing out
on a chance to share.  I always used to say that if someone would
bother to steal one of my songs I would probably take it as a
compliment.  Now, probably not.

AFAIK:

You don't need to file for copyright. Any creative work, in the absence
of a contract or some other legal binding stuff that transfers
copyright, is automatically &quot;Copyright &lt;creation date&gt;, All rights reserved &lt;creator&gt;&quot;.

And the existence of a public forum post of it would make quite
straightforward to claim one wrote it first.

As I stated at the start, that's as far as I know, and I am no lawyer.

They do it in the hope of gaining exposure. For the most part these
are performers who are trying to break into the big time. They really
have nothing to lose by it.
Let's face it, a YouTube download is not going to be anywhere near as
good as buying a DVD.
I have bought a few DVDs based on what I have seen on the net.
I've passed on a couple too.
I have never &quot;not&quot; bought a CD or DVD because I have a downloaded copy
of it.

I suspect many are trying the self promotion to avoid turning all
their money over to recording companies.
Search Dick Dale in YouTube and find his advice video for the reasons.

If you've written something yourself and post it on the internet it seems to
me that its  then copywritten?  No other claims to its ownership could pre
date it.

Years back, someone told me that a certain way to copyright a song is
to send a copy of it certified mail, whether it be cassette, cd or
written music, to yourself with signature required, keep the package/
letter un-opened and if you record the song and release it to the
public, you have some proof that it is yours originally.

According to that and all I've heard, you don't forfeit copyright just
by posting the work publicly.

That published performance, by them, constitutes a de facto copyright.
The writer can prove, with that recording, that he performed that song,
earlier than anyone else, since derivative recordings would be later.

Copyright is automatic.  You write something, it's copyrighted.  There are
ways to register it, but it's not necessary.  The thing that's necessary is
to be able to prove that your wrote it.  The mailing thing is one way of
proving the date that you completed it.  Putting it on the net would be
another way, as long as it remained on the website indefinitely and as long
as you could prove that the website's dates are accurate.  This will only
come up if someone steals your song and you sue them.

Actually, lots of people used to do that, but I've heard of several cases
where it didn't hold up in court. That originated back in the days before
copyrights were ruled to be in place automatically upon creation of the
song, and you had to apply for a copyright. Today, that's no longer
necessary and I would assume that posting the song online would give you
proof that you had done the song before the date it was posted online. Read

Hi, I don't think that would hold up thought because it can be faked.
For example, a song &quot;thief&quot; can mail him(her)self an unsealed envelope,
then when a song comes along they want to claim right to, they just drop
a recording in and *then* seal it.

Well, here's the rub. There are certain specifics to copyright law regarding
music. Once a song is published, anyone else can do a cover version provided
they pay the appropriate royalties established by statute and fill out the
right forms. It's called a mechanical license, and it's such a routine
process you can do it over the web. The copyright holder can't stop someone
from doing a cover. See www.harryfox.com for details.

However, the copyright holder of a song has the exclusive right to first
publication. That means that if you write a song, nobody else can release a
cover version of that song until you've released your version. I think it is
safe to say that once you post on the Internet, that counts as being
published.

There are worse things that could happen to you than some record company
blowing off your band and having their preferred band cover your song.
You'll make the statutory royalty (currently 9.1 cents per copy I believe).

Another potential issue is illustrated by &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; by Bob Dylan.
A live version was recorded at a music festival. He didn't like that
version. His record company wanted to release it, and he pretty much had no
control over what they released. However, since that song had never been
released before, he was able to deny his own record company a mechanical
license.

Personally, I think the benefits clearly outweigh the potential problems
with putting up your music before your band is signed. However, if I were
ever in a situation where my band was in contract discussions/negotiations
with a record label, I would not post anything new unless I absolutely had
to. No sense relinquishing any rights you don't have to.

On a side note: That mailing yourself a letter stuff is something lawyers
like to laugh about. First, there's no guarantee that your stamp will get
canceled with a date. Second, even WikiHow tells you how to steam open an
envelope ( http://www.wikihow.com/Steam-Open-an-Envelope ). You think a judge
or jury would give your letter any weight?

Thanks for the responses, all.  I hadn't realized that the laws had
been changed way back in 1989.  Sounds great, but I'm amazed that the
people who were collecting whatever fees were involved were willing to
give them up.  Who says you can't learn anything on Usenet?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm sure most of the people who do this probably don't take music
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that seriously to begin with, but I can't help but be curious
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about it. Thus far I've resisted the temptation to post music of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; my own on the internet for the reasons listed above, but maybe I'm
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; just missing out on a chance to share.  I always used to say that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; if someone would bother to steal one of my songs I would probably
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; take it as a compliment.  Now, probably not.

&gt;&gt; &gt; AFAIK:

&gt;&gt; &gt; You don't need to file for copyright. Any creative work, in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; absence of a contract or some other legal binding stuff that
&gt;&gt; &gt; transfers copyright, is automatically &quot;Copyright &lt;creation date&gt;,
&gt;&gt; &gt; All rights reserved &lt;creator&gt;&quot;.

&gt;&gt; &gt; And the existence of a public forum post of it would make quite
&gt;&gt; &gt; straightforward to claim one wrote it first.

&gt;&gt; &gt; As I stated at the start, that's as far as I know, and I am no
&gt;&gt; &gt; lawyer.

&gt;&gt; That's my understanding of it, too.

&gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt;&gt; Andy.

&gt; Years back, someone told me that a certain way to copyright a song is
&gt; to send a copy of it certified mail, whether it be cassette, cd or
&gt; written music, to yourself with signature required, keep the package/
&gt; letter un-opened and if you record the song and release it to the
&gt; public, you have some proof that it is yours originally.

That's a poor-mans copyright :)  Unless you mail 10 to yourself, you'll
be breaking that seal every time you have to prove a song is yours....

Just take that letter, and mail it to the copyright office - it will save
you a lot of envelopes :)

Hey there - never mind all this - how do you post a song up to My
Space or wherever??

I mean - where do you put the audio clip and how do you know the link
to copy and paste?

Is it there in some menu?

If you start a site as a 'MySpace Music' site, you'll get the option to
add songs... If you look at any 'band' site, it will say 'Myspace Music'.
So, when you're on a band site, you can add their songs to your profile.

Personal sites are slightly different....

Here's one of my old band sites...

http://www.myspace.com/primeevilcouncil

You can see how it says 'Myspace Music' up top..

I thought that if you do not file for a copyright on a property that
you could only sue for back royalties and not for damages.

I forget the specifics, but that sounds close enough. In order to get all of
the statutory relief I believe you are required to file for copyright.
