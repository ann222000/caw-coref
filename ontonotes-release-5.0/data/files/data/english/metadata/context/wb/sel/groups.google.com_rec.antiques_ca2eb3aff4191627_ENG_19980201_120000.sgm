Thanks for your information. If any one is interested, I have several hours
research on the subject i.e.: Character's names and their story. Some are
very interesting.

Sorry. The Feds had some law enacted about Ivory &amp; other materials being
derived from wild life, but most of the time they can't decipher their own
laws. I don't know how we are supposed to figure it out. David

"/> Ted,
A Netsuke is a small carved figuerine made out of Ivory, wood, sometimes
soapstone ( not everyone aggrees on that ). They originated in Japan &amp; were
used at the end of the string tied about the waist to keep bags holding
personal belongings from falling off the string. They were carved in many
forms, people, animals, etc. Some were said to have had magical powers. These
figures evolved into an art form all of their own &amp; are collected by people all
over the world. ( very condensed version ) David

"/> The netsuke provided an easy way for the Japanese wearing a kimono, which
had no pockets, to carry at his girdle such objects as an inro (seal-case),
later often used for medicines, a purse, a tinder-box, a drinking gourd or
a tobacco-pouch.

A Netsuke (pronounced nêtskî) was a toggle on the girdle from which at the
end of two cords, with its several compartments held together by the ojime
(sliding bead) hung the inro. The kind of Netsuke used would depend on the
rank and needs of the wearer. They were fashioned from ivory, metal, rare
wood and other natural materials into mythological figures, sea monsters
and favourite saints.

&lt;Legality of Netsuke question which I asked&gt; moves into the area of animal
protection laws established around 1987. Bottom line, it isn't legal to bring
ivory items into the US. However, items in US before this law may be
traded/sold.
The area of Netsuka study carries with it a vast block information surrounding
Chinese/Japanese &quot;mithical&quot; characters.

"/> Ted, I once wrote a lengthy piece in r.a about netsuke and ivory in
general. Charleen saved a copy somewhere, but I lost mine ages ago.

Ronnie, fear not, true ivory will be pretty well unharmed by a hot pin.
Even so, one should always choose an inconspicuous place to test it.
There are, however, other visual tests one can try which will identify
plastic, and the hot-pin-test can be a last resort.

Wow! I just did a power search in dejanews and found a reference to the
article! It's from December '95, and follows. The actual article, which
predated the following by at least a year, has disappeared. Does anyone
have a copy? I'll re-edit it and post it on brownowl.

Cheers, Laurie.

---- cut here ----

Ok, I know I pointed people at my netsuke article, but the questions
continue to come, and to centre around real vs fake ivory, and the
difference between ivory and bone. Here's a quick run-through of the
main points, which have been cut and very briefly edited to make them
more general, from the piece I wrote for netsuke:

There are two main reasons that fake ivory abounds. Firstly, it is easy
to do, and secondly, the patina, which is the key asset or quality for
any antique, is easily to reproduce sufficiently well to fool most
people.

Faint longtitudinal stripes are a sure way to spot the fake ivories
that appeared at the turn of the century, with the stripes built into
them. The grain in genuine ivory is only visible at certain angles,
whereas simulated ivory grain is always visible and very regular. To
find the grain, hold the piece towards a light so that the stripes are
visible; slowly rotate or horizontally revolve it through 90 degrees,
and the grain should become very faint/much less pronounced or
disappear. If it doesn't, it's probably fake. This technique takes a
little perfecting, but it's worth the effort. Also, on the simulated
ivory, the stripes also tend to be wider and more regular. The colour
of these fakes is also revealing: they are not stained, and are an even
white all over - too white.

The forgeries made around 1900 are in casein (which is made from milk)
and other plastics, and sometimes have the signatures cast instead of
carved; no genuine netsuke would be signed in any other way other than
by carving. Also, when viewed from the base, the fake piece still shows
the stripes as parallel lines, whereas genuine elephant ivory shows
concentric circles or lozenges rather like tree-rings. Also, if the
piece is made of a whole tusk section, as opposed to a quarter or other
part, there should be a central nerve canal, often inset with something
such as a lacquer panel containing the signature. No genuine ivory
piece will have lines which are more-or-less parallel: just imagine,
given the tree ring analogy, how large the tusk would have to be to
have almost parallel lines even in a small piece such as a netsuke.

Another substitute for elephant ivory is walrus tusk (which is a tooth,
unlike an elephant's tusk), which can be distinguished from true ivory
by its core of granular dentine, often disguised by cross-hatching or
similar patterning. Walrus ivory is composed of different layers and so
is less stable than true ivory, and more prone to cracking. An even
cheaper, and poorer, substitute is bone. Unlike ivory, bone is provided
with a blood source, and so even in small pieces, has minute pores and
channels through which the bone is kept alive. They appear on a carving
as small brown or black spots or channels, and you need to watch for
carving or marks attempting to disguise them.

Since the mid-70s large numbers of very deceptive netsuke and other
ivory figures have been made by casting in plastic resin in a flexible
rubber mould. Taken from originals, usually of okimono (carved ivory
fissures) from the second half of the C19th and therefore highly
accurate (the moulding process is so sensitive it picks up every
characteristic of the original, including under-cutting), these are
extremely difficult to detect. After casting, they are stained in a
deep sepia, which is thinner than the proud surfaces and gives a good
impression of wear. These pieces are all-pervasive, and often have dust
in the lower nooks and crannies to simulate age; this is all part of
the faking process. Turn-of-the-century plastic fakes are lighter than
real ivory, but this has been overcome with the modern ones.

There are two main ways of detecting modern fakes. A chip on genuine
ivory shows an irregular new surface of a similar colour but of,
perhaps, a paler shade or tone. In modern resin, the chip is akin to
glass. Secondly, temperature. Ivory feels much colder than resin as it
conducts heat away from the body faster. However, the definitive and
only foolproof temperature test is burning. Hold a pin in a pair of
pliers, and heat it until it's red-hot. Then stick it in some
inconspicuous part of the carving. If it's genuine ivory, it will
barely mark the surface, and will make that distinctive burnt-teeth
smell you may know from the dentist. If it's plastic/resin, it will
plunge readily into the piece with a puff of smoke, and create a burr
round the hole. There will also be a strong smell of burning plastic.

Be aware too, that China is supplying vast numbers of &quot;hand-carved&quot;
netsuke in ivory. They make no pretence to be old, although some are
stained, or taken in by second-tier fakers who attempt to age the piece
in order to deceive the unwary. They can be found in profusion at
airport and hotel shops, fairs and small dealers, and are remarkably
cheap. Please bear in mind that as old ivory is very hard, and
therefore difficult to carve, these are always made from new ivory.
These pieces are made in such numbers that said ivory is almost always
poached, and buying these pieces only serves to continue the slaughter.

Older netsuke, those made in what is considered the golden age, between
the late C18th and mid C19th, show over a century of natural ageing and
wear. Remember that these pieces were in daily use, and such wear will
be noticeable on the raised portions of the figure or carving, and on
the cord holes or himotoshi. This wear is almost impossible to
reproduce convincingly. The patina, an important part of any antique,
builds up from constant handling and use, and exposure to the air, and
is especially difficult to reproduce. Ivory darkens as it ages, but
haphazardly. Fake pieces stained with sepia show a consistent
colouring, unrealistic and often with a nasty pink tinge.

Cheers, Laurie.
