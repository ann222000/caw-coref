I finally went back to the store where my big deal stuff lives. I
selected one small box at random (a rosewood and brass writing slope)
brought it home and placed half the contents on the scanner.

The picture is large, but you can see why I feel alomost intimidated
by this purchase...there is just SOOO much stuff , boxes and boxes
full.

http://web.ukonline.co.uk/members/jon.d2/bigdeal.jpg

The silver specs automatically unfold from the case, the central seal
is gold with a Masonic cut stone, some of the jewellery contains
precious stones. I personally love the 1799 bone love token. The round
ivory box has a silver top.

What do you like?

Jon

I particularly like the cigarette holders (especially the loose one near
the pipe), the hatpin and the cameo ring. The ring just happens to match
a necklace/earring set that I was given by a dear friend who was dying
of liver cancer.

Your elephant is cute, too. And I got a kick out of the letter opener
encouraging you to &quot;open your letters and take out your cheques.&quot; Oh,
that it were really that way!

Jon, is there really a street in London called Cheapside?

What kind of watches are those? I haven't seen many with that wide of a
case...

I love the ivory? cigarette holder, I would look so sophisticated
holding that!

Have fun, Michele

Hi Jon,

The bone apple corer's my favourite too, though the masonic fob seal
sounds interesting. Is that a cut steel fob seal off to the right? (I
can only see the face in the scan.)

Thanks for the interesting picture,

Jane

"/> The love token is an apple core remover, I think.

Just a general comment. This was NOT a sales teaser, I'm too straight
forward for this. Generally, whilst I still have a job, I don't need
tosell old things for the cash. (I met my potential new manager (post
merger) yesterday and I think we can work together, which is a big
relief) However, there are certain items I don't actually like and I
am thinking of getting rid of these by putting up a private (auction)
site for r.a. members only or maybe just Ebay if the first proves too
difficult.I will answer initial enquiries, but it is best to wait
until I reallyknow what I'm doing with everything.

At the moment, you are sharing my excitement as I get a good look at
the treasures properly for the first time.

Jon

PS Burglars, please note, these items are not kept at home, but in a
secure store

"/>  Jon,
I'm assuming that the cigarette holder in question is the cigar
shaped item in its' own case, parallel to the ivory pipe...? (based on
Tracy's description of the coloring). I don't know diddly about
cigarette holders (as is painfully obvious), but I do know that this item
is very similar in coloring to an amber necklace I got from my
great-grandmother (identified and authenticated by an estate jewelry
appraiser). The amber is not clear like one usually sees, but swirled
with lighter, opaque streaks. It always reminded me of my Mom's whipped
honey-butter spread, or less closely, of the swirled colors of
honey-colored slag glass, but finer. This opaque amber is less prized
than the clear amber (complete with petrified bugs, ick!) but is quite
neat in its own way. It should pass the rub-and-sniff test (warm amber
smells like pine pitch, if I remember correctly). I'm sure may others
here will have a more erudite explanation :-)

Looks like ivory or bone to me. Amber is more like the long cigar shaped
thing (at least on my monitor), although it's usually clear (remember
Jurassic Park?). &lt;g&gt;

Have fun, Michele

Jon, I have one very similar, although I haven't a clue where in my
house it's located at the moment. &lt;g&gt; I found mine in my Grandfather's
things, but he smoked cigars, so my guess was that my father had brought
it back from Japan during the Korean War.

Mine is brass colored inside though, with a metal link holding strap
inside for the cigs.

HTH, Michele

&gt; Jon,
&gt; I'm assuming that the cigarette holder in question is the cigar
&gt;shaped item in its' own case, parallel to the ivory pipe...? (based
on
&gt;Tracy's description of the coloring). I don't know diddly about
&gt;cigarette holders (as is painfully obvious), but I do know that this
item
&gt;is very similar in coloring to an amber necklace I got from my
&gt;great-grandmother (identified and authenticated by an estate jewelry
&gt;appraiser). The amber is not clear like one usually sees, but
swirled
&gt;with lighter, opaque streaks. It always reminded me of my Mom's
whipped
&gt;honey-butter spread, or less closely, of the swirled colors of
&gt;honey-colored slag glass, but finer. This opaque amber is less
prized
&gt;than the clear amber (complete with petrified bugs, ick!) but is
quite
&gt;neat in its own way. It should pass the rub-and-sniff test (warm
amber
&gt;smells like pine pitch, if I remember correctly). I'm sure may
others
&gt;here will have a more erudite explanation :-)

&gt;Elaine

"/> I remember somewhere that amber can cool cigarette smoke and holders
were made of this, and can also be opaque like this...

Probably bronze. The Japanese are famous for
their bronze work. And they did mixed metal work too.
But that is as much help as I can be, Jon. I have never
learned the fine points. Heck, I can't even say that I
have the basics here. But it is probably Japanese bronze.

Jon is that a lorgnette I spy? (where I grew up the closest thing I ever saw
to a lorgnette was when someone would accidentally break one of the ear bows
to their glasses. They would then hold them up to their face with the other
bow and peer through the lenses)........I love the cameo ring. I would say
that I'd love to rustle around through your drawers, but I think that would
come out sounding wrong.

You just don't spend enough time reading romantic English novels......in
those, the evil Mother-In-Law ALWAYS whips out her lorgnette, peers at the
quaking bride,looks her up and down disdainfully, then announces, in
thundering tones, that she, (the bride) is not good enough for Mummy's son.
Then quaking bride spends the rest of the book alternatly sucking up to Mom
and fighting with her husband for making them live in the same house.
You have some wonderful stuff.

and ran back, with him hot on her heels. He caught her and *ahem* had
his way with her (hey, if you think teenagers don't know about this

Charleen wrote that Northanger Abbey was a parody of gothic novels............

As I recall, it is a parody of a particular one, Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries
of Udolpho. A very popular and imitated book in its day, sadly forgotten now.
It is a gothic among gothics. Ann set her novels in the far-away, strange,
dark, foriegn counties of France and Italy, and while the time frame was
several hundred years in past, the characters tended to think and act like what
was then modern english people.

Truely a gold mine of gothic cliches, it is still a great read if you have the
proper frame of mind, which is to giggle at it. See how many pages you turn
before everyone bursts into tears over the sadness of life, or the heroine
swoons in a faint.

My favorite plot cliche was when the brave, lovely young heroine, Emily,
attempts to explore the dark secret rooms of the castle Udolpho. In one room
there is nothing but a picture, covered with cloth. When Emily takes the cloth
off..........SHE SCREAMS IN TERROR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.................THEN SHE
SWOONS IN A FAINT!!!!!!!!!............When she finally wakes up, she is in
another part of the castle, someone unknown has carried her away, and the
picture is gone. You have to wait until the end of the novel to find out what
the picture was.
After reading The Mysteries of Udolpho, you can really understand what a
bitting satire Jane wrote. She always did have a good eye for silliness.

Ah yes, there never was an average woman in any of Heinlein's books, was
there? And how all those beautiful women fell for all those old, rude
men, is beyond me. But Stranger in a Strange Land was the first novel of
his I read, and I was hooked!

Have fun, Michele

&gt; Oh, Michelle, do try Jane Austen, especially &quot;Northanger Abbey.&quot; She
is
&gt; so deliciously and cruelly precise in skewering people. Nothing at

I
&gt; like Austen. But leave &quot;Emma&quot; for after you've become addicted. Very
&gt; exasperating human being.

&gt; I also have read most everything (except the existentialists) that
you've

I read the first half of Vanity Fair in High School too, but it was just for
fun(yeah, strange kid). My problem, and I didn't realize it until years later,
when
I had a better grasp of the victorian novel, was that I got the good girl/bad
girl mixed up. I was rooting for Becky Sharp, since she was a smart,
ambitious, go-getter determine to make it in the world. Didn't understand that
was BAD. Probably a good thing.

Ah, Michele,

The first of his books I read was _Have Spacesuit Will Travel_ when I
was in 4th grade. It opened up a whole new world, and while my friends
were reading Dr. Seuss, I was traveling across the universe with
Heinlein. When I was in college I was amazed to discover he wrote books
for grown-ups (sort of). It was like running into an old and dear
friend again.

"/> Pity. I agree that Amelia is dull in her perpetual goodness and virtue
(although deliberately so; one of the points Thackeray was making is that
being virtuous can be every bit an expression of vanity as admiring
oneself in a mirror excessively) but Becky Sharp is so deliciously and
single-mindedly out for herself that it is a real treat to watch her in
action. Not for everyone, though, I suppose. I did enjoy the description
of how to live well on nothing a year.

But...I just had to respond to this...you're right about there not being

wife who was a huge influence on his writing. He believed that we are
the superior sex and capable of just about anything we set our minds to.

most of the big little books (I kept Mickey Mouse), to Toad Hall. But
along with Mickey, I still have my Tolkien with my personal flip movie.

love to see one! Those artists were certainly creative, weren't they?

been fortunate enough to find a book that has it, but did see some books
exhibited at a show a couple of years ago. You don't notice that the edges
are painted until you fan the pages ever so slightly. Then a marvelous work
of art emerges...beautiful!

Dear Husband and I compile a summer reading list for him every year, and
this year, Stranger in a Strange Land is at the top of it... :-D (It also
includes at least one of the Dumas/Three Musketeers novels. I'm all for
including an Austen novel and maybe even some Tolkien, but I'm having
trouble getting those selections past the other member of the Reading List
Committee -- he doesn't like either, and prefers more sci fi instead...)

If you like Dumas try to dig up &quot;The Black Tulip&quot;. It's a great read and goes into
that tulip craze the took place in Holland. We have a big old set of Dumas and I like
that one the best.
I don't remember which Dumas wrote it but I agree with Charleen, you can't go far
wrong.

Tina - who's in the middle of George Elliots &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot;. I'll let you know.

&gt;&gt;lugubrious. What a great word! And no offense, Charleen, but it
&gt;&gt;describes _Vanity Fair_ to a T. I never read another Thackery, and
&gt;&gt;don't intend to.

&gt; Pity. I agree that Amelia is dull in her perpetual goodness and virtue
&gt; (although deliberately so; one of the points Thackeray was making is that
&gt; being virtuous can be every bit an expression of vanity as admiring
&gt; oneself in a mirror excessively) but Becky Sharp is so deliciously and
&gt; single-mindedly out for herself that it is a real treat to watch her in
&gt; action. Not for everyone, though, I suppose. I did enjoy the description
&gt; of how to live well on nothing a year.

&gt;&gt;I did, however, thouroughly enjoy reading the 6 book set by Dumas
&gt;&gt;about the Musketeers. (I no longer have the set, but think only one
&gt;&gt;was actually titled _The Three Musketeers_.) Much better than any
&gt;&gt;movie.

&gt; Now, Dumas is just plain fun. To say you like the Musketeers series is
&gt; to say you like ice cream....what's NOT to like? :-)

&gt; Good reading, everyone!

&gt;&gt;Ahhh! Old &quot;J.R.R.&quot; was it? I had to read &quot;Fellowship of the Rings&quot; in
&gt;&gt;high school. All I remember about it were these very strange, troll-like
&gt;&gt;creatures like Bilbo Baggins and Frodo. I took advantage of that
&gt;&gt;otherwise wasted time in learning the basics of cartoon animation. Hey,
&gt;&gt;it was a very long book with wide margins. I drew little stick people in
&gt;&gt;the margins... one male, one female. When you flipped through the book,
&gt;&gt;you could see the little gal walk out, stand there like an idiot, see
&gt;&gt;the guy approach her, watch as she turned and ran with him in hot
&gt;&gt;pursuit.

&gt;Aren't flip-books great? Have you ever seen any old ones? I haven't
&gt;but I know they exist. I don't know how old the form is, but would be
&gt;interested to find out.

&gt;There's another way book margins/edges are used; a narrow strip is
&gt;painted in each edge and when you riffle the pages slightly, you can
&gt;see a picture. Does anyone know what that's called?

Nope, don't know what those are called. But as to flip-books, I
remember making my first one in fourth grade way back in 1944, and I
had a great career for a year or so, doing them for other kids. Of
course, what I was doing was running horses. Nothing so interesting
as Tracy describes. I didn't know about such things then (but I bet I
could do a helluva flip-book now).

&gt;&gt; Is this something similar to a Big little book? I remember flipping

&gt;&gt; Would love to look at it again.

&gt; At the risk of looking stupid (a recreational hazard), I'm not sure what a &quot;Big
&gt;Little Book&quot; is. The flip book I have is about 2&quot; x 3&quot;, and doesn't have anything
&gt;but the flipping movie in it (not just on the corners). I'm home on medication for
&gt;my shoulder, and don't feel like digging it out of whatever box it's in, but I think
&gt;it had Mickey and Pluto going to a picnic. Not much help, I know.

"/> The Big Little books were diminutive of dimension but thick with
pages. They used to sell them at the five-and-dime stores. I had a
ton of 'em, and like others here I wonder where they went.

But getting back to flip-books, I have a fairly recent one that was
sent out to car writers by Mitsubishi when the company rolled out its
retractable hardtop 3000GT Spyder in 1995. This is a book of photos,
and when you riffle the pages, the roadster's roof opens and folds
into the trunk, which then buttons up and makes the coupe into a sleek
convertible.
