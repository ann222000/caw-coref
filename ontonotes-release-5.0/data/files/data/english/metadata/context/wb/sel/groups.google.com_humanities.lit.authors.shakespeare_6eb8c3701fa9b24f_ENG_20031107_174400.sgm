_The True Story of the Shake-speare Publications Volume One:
Edward de Vere &amp; The Shakespeare Printers,_ by Robert Sean Brazil.

&lt;&lt;Nathaniel BUTTER, a publisher, and later a journalist is described
in Chapter 13. King Lear was one of his first publications
after establishing his press, the Pie Bull.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------------
Nathaniel BUTTER (King Lear)

1605 Q1of The London Prodigal William Shakespeare on title page.
(printed by Thomas Creede for Nathaniel BUTTER) (EKC I, 534)

1608 Q1 King Lear M. William Shak-speare (printed for Nathaniel BUTTER)

1619 Q2 King Lear, falsely dated 1608 M. William Shake-speare on title
page. (printed by William Jaggard for Nathaniel BUTTER) (EKC I, 464)

BUTTER, n. [OE. botere, BUTTER, AS. butere, fr. L. butyrum,
Gr. boy`tyron; either fr. boy`s OX, cow + tyro`s cheese]

SPENCER, n. [OF. despensier.]
One who has the care of the spence, or BUTTERy.

The Ritual Mating of the King and the Whore

&lt;&lt;The agnihotra, the sacrifice in honor of Agni, the Hindu Fire-god.
This oblation consists of throwing BUTTER balls into the fire.
The BUTTER represents the fat victims which were formerly used.
The sacrifice is performed at dawn &amp; sunset (Sandhya),
the two crepuscles of the Sun. Agni is identified with
the Sun and, more exactly, with the Fallen Sun that inflames
the earth at the world's end. In real terms, Agni symbolizes,
in this one of his seven forms, the conflagration that destroys the
world at DOOM and which consists in volcanic paroxysms of global scale.
The giant explosions rip the earth's crust, causing magmatic effusions
and throwing out volcanic bombs (debris) the size of entire mountains.
These are equated to the vajra, the Celestial Fire of DOOM that destroys
the world when the eras end. One of the forms of Agni is Angiras,
a name that means both &quot;anointed one&quot; (ang) or &quot;fiery one&quot; (agni).&gt;&gt;

the &lt;PIE&gt; Bull
---------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;The Least Successful Collector Betsy Baker played a central role in
the history of collecting. She was employed as a servant in the house
of John Warburton (1682-1759) who had amassed a fine collection of 58
first edition plays, including most of the works of Shakespeare. One day
Warburton returned home to find 55 of them charred beyond legibility.
Betsy had either burned them or used them as PIE bottoms. The remaining
three folios are now in the British Museum. The only comparable literary
figure was the maid who in 1835 burned the manuscript of the first
volume of Thomas Carlyle's &quot;The History of the French Revolution&quot;,
thinking it was wastepaper.&gt;&gt;
-- Stephen Pile, &quot;The Book of Heroic Failures&quot;

[NOTE- some 60 manuscripts of plays of this period eventually come into
the hands of a collector named John Warburton* (1682-1759). Many
are the only surviving copies of plays that had never been printed.

Unfortunately Warburton* was careless with them and his servant, Betsy
Baker*, made use of them to light her stove &amp; line the bottom of PIEs.

In the end only three survived.
The surviving plays are the work of Dekker, Ford &amp; Massinger.]
-------------------------------------------------------------
After his library fire of 1623 Ben Jonson
wrote of his loss in &quot;An Execration upon Vulcan&quot;:

Thou mightst have had me perish, piece, by piece,
to light tobacco, or save roasted geese
Singe capons, or poor pigs, dropping their eyes;
Condemn'd me to the OVENs with the PIES;
And so, have kept me dying a whole age,
Nor ravish'd all hence in a minute's rage.

[Hamlet (Quarto 1) 4.5]

Ofelia There is fennell for you, I would a giu'n you
Some violets, but they all withered, when
My father died: alas, they say the owle was
A BAKERs daughter, we see what we are,
But can not tell what we shall be.

[Hamlet (Quarto 2) 4.5]

Oph. Well good dild you, they say the Owle was a BAKERs daugh-
ter, Lord we know what we are, but know not what we may be.
God be at your table.

[Hamlet (Folio) 4.5]

Ophe. Well, God dil'd you. They say the Owle was
a BAKERs daughter. Lord, wee know what we are, but
know not what we may be. God be at your Table.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ]

&lt;&lt;The Owl was a BAKER's Daughter. According to legend, our Saviour
went into a BAKER's shop to ask for something to eat. The mistress
of the shop instantly put a cake into the oven for Him, but the
daughter said it was too large, and reduced it half. The dough,
however, swelled to an enormous size, and the daughter cried out,
&quot;Heugh! heugh! heugh!&quot; and was transformed into an owl.&gt;&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;The name BAXTER means 'bakester' or BAKER. The first BAXTERs in Angus
may have been BAKERs at the royal castle at Forfar in the thirteenth
centuary.&gt;&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Oxford was accompanied on his journey to Italy, by the Englishman
Nathaniel BAXTER, who recalled the event in a publication he entitled
_Sidneys Ourania_, printed in 1606, two years after Oxford's death.

Although the publication is dedicated to Philip Sidney's sister Mary,
countess of Pembroke, A POEM within the volume is dedicated to
Oxford's daughter Susan Vere, and assigns her conception to Oxford's
miraculous rescue from &quot;infamie&quot; (here, Oxford is the &quot;Prince&quot;
and also the &quot;Albanian dignitie&quot; - or British nobleman).

The first three stanzas, which are an acrostic on
the de Vere motto (&quot;mot&quot; or posy), are as follows:

To the Right Noble, and Honorable Lady Susan Vera Mongomriana.

V Aliant whilome the Prince that bare this Mot,
E Ngraued round about his GOLDEN RING:
R Oaming in VENICE ere thou wast begot,
A Mong the Gallants of th'Italian spRING.

N Euer omitting what might pastime bRING,
I Talian sports, and Syrens Melodie:
H Opping Helena with her warbling sting,
I Nfested th'Albanian dignitie,
L Ike as they poysoned all Italie.

V Igilant then th'eternall majestie
E Nthraled soules to free from infamie:
R EmembRING thy sacred virginitie,
I Nduced vs to make speedie repaire,
V Nto thy mother euerlasting faire,
S O did this Prince begette thee debonaire.

By way of explanation it should be noted that &quot;Hopping Helena&quot; is a
circumlocution for &quot;prostitute&quot; - perhaps based on the fact that many
Venetian courtesans were in fact
named &quot;Helena.&quot; Similarly, a Cambridge prostitute of the time (1620) was
nicknamed &quot;Jumping Judy.&quot; The &quot;sting&quot; with which this generic prostitute
infected the Albanian (BAXTER's poetic term for &quot;British&quot;) dignity or
nobility, was presumably some kind of venereal disease.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;Ben Franklin used &quot;Polly BAKER&quot; to examine the NEGATIVE way women
were treated in the eyes of the law. Ms. BAKER had several illegitimate
children and was punished for her &quot;crime,&quot; while the fathers,
many of whom were prominent citizens, suffered no such hardship.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-

&lt;&lt;The following [Nathaniel BAXTER] poem which alludes to
Susan Vere's want of an adequate dowry was recorded by
John Manningham of the Middle Temple during the year 1602-3,
when [Susan] was about 15 and Oxford was still alive&gt;&gt;

LA[DY] SUSAN VERE

NOTHING's your lott, that's more then can be told
For NOTHING is more precious then GOLD.

is an allusion to the custom of putting paper under the bottom of
