Hello

I am very new to this newsgroup, I have browsed through the conditions of
posting but I apologise if I am breaking any rules!

I have in my posession what looks like a piece of old Optical/Opticians
instrumentation (I have pictures if needed to E-mail, amd they are also
posted on alt.binaries.pictures called OPTICALPICS - posted 22/8/99

It was purchased from a car boot/auction in Brigg, UK and has the following
features.

It looks as though it has a kind of resting place for a chin. When the chin
is rested on this there is an arm with a square plate at the end which looks
like it could cover either eye.

At the back (or front!) of the machine, there are various lenses with metal
covers - the word London is inscribed on the wheel, there is also a number
of 'pins' inserted in the base of the machine.

The whole thing is made of heavy brass and solid wood and I was just
wondering if..

(a) anyone knows what it is, or what it used for...
(b) if not, could anyone point me in the direction of a newsgroup/Web site
that may help

Thankyou

"/>  Uh ... I'm not about to scavenge through binaries looking for
this thing. Please post it to some webspace and leave the URL.

"/>  Ask the OLDEST optician yuo can find. They usually recognize
things a generation or more before the equipment they trained on.
