So, a mother is complaining that 2 special police officers didn't dive into
a pond to save her 10 year-old son.  Quite vitriolic about it, too.

One obvious question.  Where was she?

&gt;&gt;So, a mother is complaining that 2 special police officers didn't dive
&gt;&gt;into

&gt;&gt;One obvious question.  Where was she?

&gt; This question has already cropped up on Arun  District Council's patch
&gt; regarding well-meaning but misguided seafront residents intervening in the
&gt; cases of children playing on the beach shingle banks during heavy seas.
&gt; Those steep shingle banks are lethal. Trying to regain ones lost footing
&gt; on wet shingle that consists of small round pebbles is next to impossible.
&gt; The next sea can bowl you over and you're done for.

&gt; There are several primary risk areas: that the children will resent
&gt; interference and may complain; that an adult, even a good swimmer, might
&gt; be putting themselves at risk.

&gt; In all cases the correct procedure is to call 999 and allow a suitably
&gt; qualified risk assessment officer to decide what emergency action is
&gt; required.

&gt; Really rough seas are a magnet for children. Whenever I've watched them on
&gt; the beach when conditions are dangerous, the question uppermost is why are
&gt; their parents allowing it?

&gt; When we wanted a beach party barbecue for my grandchildren and a few of
&gt; their friends for a jubilee celeb, ADC's permission required a qualified
&gt; lifeguard to be present. We went ahead and had the barby without ADC's
&gt; okay.

Poor Jordon didn't stand a chance, with a mother who not only gave him a
completely stupid name, but didn't even know how to spell it properly.

You might be interested in this article, which details how the police
are now expected to be parents.

http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23370777-details/Policeman...

I think that Police Support Officers, whose existence is itself symbolic
of a crisis of purpose in the forces of lawlessness and disorder, were
probably only doing the most that can be expected of them.

Yeah. Luckily she didn't go completely weird with one of those Old

How else would you spell 'Jordon' but 'Jordon'?

And is there any end to your clamorous snobbery and unpleasantness?

Children aren't dogs, and should be named something meaningful and

Well Phil, I'm with you there, and it goes without saying that I would
not make a comment like that to her face, but if we cannot use such fora
as these to elevate the particular to the abstract what else can we do
with them?

We live in an idiot society of neglectful and reckless parents who can't
even be arsed spelling their children's names properly.

It should be pointed out that this brave little boy died trying to save
the life of his eight year old stepsister. Perhaps you might have less
sympathy with this woman when you consider that she had entrusted young
Jordon with his stepsister's welfare whilst she sat on her posterior at
home. And he died doing the job she should have been doing. Jordon
didn't even die to save the life of his sister, he died saving the life
of a child his mother conceived with another man other his father.

If you can't see that Jordon's death is a tragic vignette illustrating
the fuck-up that passes for civilisation in this country, a vignette of
neglected children and infantilised, self-absorbed adults, the welfare
state and the dependency culture, then you're blind.

And similarly, I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't express alarm that
these faux-coppers get four weeks training, which doesn't include life
saving, but does include &quot;race and diversity&quot; training. What the fuck
good that does anyone, answers on a postcard.

It's come to something when you can't even leave a ten-year-old in
charge of his little sister. I mean she's not a baby. I was regularly
imposed upon by being forced to keep an eye on younger siblings. It
was considered perfectly usual.

Your problem, Calwell, is that not only do you not know your Old
Testament angels, and still insist this mother spelled her son's name
wrong, you also belong to a generation of namby-pambies, where the
care of the children could only be left to council-approved
child-minders.

It's a terrible thing that this boy died, but it's an accident of
childhood, and as such, nobody is to blame.

The days when policemen would put themselves at risk to save another
person's life are long gone, and in fact only ever existed in the
public imagination. The first rule of life-saving is: you're not much
fucking use to anybody if you drown.

Really? His post seemed to me much more like the usual tedious

However, you might share those feelings (or at least pretend to in
your usual fashion).

Look, everyday people are not symbols. They are people. The accidental
death of this little boy is both sad and pathetic (in the original
sense).
To try and turn it into your usual 'decline of the West' rant is
fatuous, and, to my mind, rather twisted (though utterly predictable
of course).

Of course the mother has made unreasonable demands in her grief (and
in the concentrated glare of media scum). Nothing can be read from
this, other than that people's judgment suffers under stress.
Anybody's would.
