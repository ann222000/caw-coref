I'm looking for &quot;nice&quot; surfaces of constant negative Gaussian curvature.
There are quite a few pictures on the web of &quot;minimal surfaces&quot;, which
have zero mean curvature. Their Gaussian curvature is generally
negative, but not necessarily constant.

As an example, I like this one, the &quot;Schwarz P-surface&quot;:

http://www.indiana.edu/~minimal/archive/triply/schwarzp/schwarzp.html

The only surface of negative Gaussian curvature that seems to pop up
everywhere on the web is the pseudosphere. But would't it be possible to
deform the Schwarz P-surface so that not its mean curvature is zero,
but its Gaussian curvature constant?

The ultimate motivation for this is that I built a model of Klein's
quartic surfaces with 24 heptagons, that looks rather like the Schwarz
P-surface:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~westy31/Geometry/KleinHoles.jpg

It would be really cool if this tiling could be viewed as a tiling of a
constant curvature surface, just like polyhedra can be viewed as tilings
of the sphere.

Surfaces of rotation are much easier to describe than general
surfaces... :)

A theorem of Hilbert guarantees no *complete* surface of constant
negative curvature can be immersed in R^3, so there's no hope of
&quot;slightly&quot; deforming the triply-periodic Schwarz surface (the right-
hand image in the URL you posted) to have constant Gaussian curvature.
Offhand, I don't know about deforming one &quot;unit&quot;.

Your (nifty) model seems to have &quot;constant polyhedral
curvature&quot; (three regular Euclidean heptagons meeting at each vertex),
but it doesn't look as if two copies can be joined like units of the
Schwarz surface so that three faces meet at each vertex. There's an
associated tiling of the hyperbolic plane, though. Don Hatch has a
large gallery of this and other tilings:

http://www.plunk.org/~hatch/HyperbolicTesselations/

Yours is in the fifth row:

http://www.plunk.org/~hatch/HyperbolicTesselations/7_3_trunc0_512x512...

(My own favorite is the 5,5 tiling, which covers Kepler's great
dodecahedron.)

Best,
Andy

P.S. Regarding the Klein quartic, do you know Silvio Levy's book The
Eightfold Way and Helaman Ferguson's sculpture of the same name?

In the Schwarz P-surface, take a &quot;unit cell&quot; and cap its boundaries with
the faces of a cube.  Now draw any body diagonal of the cube and
identify its intersections with the P-surface.  Because of the threefold
symmetry and the continuity of the curvature, the Gauss curvature must
vanish at these points.  To get constant negative Gauss curvature you'd
have to puncture the surface at the body diagonals of the cube.

Unfortunately, your model does not satisfy a periodic bonndary
condition.  To fit the protrusions of a like version of your model with
the indentations in the original, you'd have to rotate one copy by 45
degrees.  Thus you can't get a Schwarz-P like surface.

Breather surfaces in
http://3d-xplormath.org/

(Soliton solutions of Sine-Gordon equation) appear to be compositions
of several pseudospherical surfaces in

http://virtualmathmuseum.org/Surface/gallery_o.html#PseudosphericalSu ...

which are spectacular both visually and in their mathematical
formulation.
Of the three pseudospheres (central, hyper and hypo) the central one
is
rotationally symmetric and has a simple closed form, others involve
elliptic integrals or Jacobi functions to describe 3D orientation.
Kuen surface
(e,g., pl. see Mathworld) and Dini's surface also have closed form
surface
parameterizations. Dini is made by cutting central a pseudosphere
along a meridian
and twisting it physically. Mathematically one introduces an extra z
term for
twist into central pseudosphere parameterization.

Had seen the pictures of Schwartz P surfaces earlier in &quot;The Science
of Soap Films and Soap Bubbles&quot; by Cyril Isenberg, H = 0 minimal soap
bubble/film surfaces. More recently holes are also appearing in Costa
and Hermann Karcher minimal surfaces.

Hilbert's theorem stipulates every surface of constant (negative)
curvature to have a cuspidal edge. It is intuitive to expect it also.
Since product K = k1*k2 is constant, when one curvature is infinite
there appears a sharp  &quot;edge&quot; separating periodical segments in
a negatively curved semi-infinite surface. (The same logic applies
to positive Gauss curvature also). The asymptotic lines which are
edges
of regression proceed from one nappe to the other continuously, as
seen
in the central pseudosphere for z = th-tanh(th) at start of cuspidal
edge
th = 0.

To create a cuspidal edge in a physical model, each surface cell has
to be
deformed severely, from a condition of orthogonal asymptotes for
minimal surfaces H =0 , K &lt;0,  towards narrow rhombuses in isometric
deformation  at first and then by dilatation into K&lt; 0 constant
surfaces. Deformation proceeds from a variable square cell to
rhombic cells of Tschebychev Nets.  This is difficult but not
impossible in physical models. It would be also an interesting subject
for research in general differential geometrical formulation. When a
helicoid
is to be so converted, an infinite sheet has to becomes finite as an
isometric
equivalent of the hyper pseudosphere.

Just as the popular method of making minimal films is by soap-films,
a
similar method has not been suggested in literature to best of my
knowledge for K&lt; 0 constant surfaces. My own proposal is to use
fishnet stockings
that make a Chebychev Net, filaments are twisted with constant torsion
as asymptotic
lines everywhere (by virtue of Enneper-Beltrami  Theorem). We find the
such
construction in old style lobster/crab pots.

http://i7.ebayimg.com/02/i/000/99/88/7c48_1.JPG

To make physical model of Schwartz surface with const negative K, one
can start with a fishnet stocking, which is to be first draped on a
spherical mandrel employing three mutually perpendicular circle rings
inside.
They have to be drawn apart allowing the stocking to develop saddle
points everywhere.
For tiling I suggest such asymptotic lines as borders rather than the
lines of principal curvature. I studied these surfaces, finding the
topic to be of absorbing interest.

Narasimham

A slightly simpler model of &quot;constant polyhedral curvature&quot; is one
formed by 3 sets of orthogonal intersecting bars

http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/graphic1/polyhedr/hyperbol/skew6x4.gif

The surface has 6 squares at each vertex.

I also found this one, a (3,7) infinite polyhedron:

http://www.superliminal.com/geometry/infinite/3_7a.htm

It appears to be the dual of the (7,3) case. So I think (7,3) *can* fill
space in a &quot;zeolite&quot; fashion, rather like other examples such as (4,6).
I might make a 3D model.

A method I am working on myself is based on discrete Ricci Flow on
Circle packings. This is really beautiful stuff, for example, look at this:

http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~vislab/papers/RicciFlow.pdf

I'm trying to implement this in a suitable computer program, so I can
make pictures myself. Should have it working soon.

Beautiful indeed. Just for my take,is it so that line expansions/
contractions are conformally defined,or may be even intrinsically,
making mapping always possible from a surface of arbitrary Gauss
curvature to a flat plane?

So for example,any face can be made to resemble in its physical
features with any other face by a morphing that can be calculated by a
Laplace-Beltrami patch mapping matrix ?

If so,is there a Law that connects strains and Gauss curvatures that
can be stated at least approximately? Von-Karman's relations are also
relevant here.I had studied the subject to a limited extent.The first
and second forms of surface theory could be connected in elegant ways.
