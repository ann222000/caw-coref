The Oxford Shakespeare: Poems. 1914.

Sonnet CXXXVII.

THOU blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold, and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
Yet what the best is take the worst to be.
If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks, 5
Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,
Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
Why should my heart think that a several plot
Which my heart knows the wide world's common place? 10
Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,
To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
In things right true my heart and eyes have err'd,
And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.

1609 Quarto, old-fashioned spelling.

I37
THou blinde foole loue,what doost thou to mine eyes,
That they behold and see not what they see:
They know what beautie is,see where it lyes,
Yet what the best is,take the worst to be.
If eyes corrupt by ouer-partiall lookes,
Be anchord in the baye where all men ride,
Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hookes,
Whereto the iudgement of my heart is tide?
Why should my heart thinke that a seuerall plot,
Which my heart knowes the wide worlds common place?
Or mine eyes seeing this,say this is not
To put faire truth vpon so foule a face,
In things right true my heart and eyes haue erred,
And to this false plague are they now transferred.

and have moved over to a faithless pest. /

By quatrains:
(1) Why do the worst things look to me like the best? (2) Why has love
concealed her commonness from me? (3) Why can I not see the obvious,
that she is disloyal? (c) I have misplaced my trust.

The speaker's jealousy breaks out from the restraints of (e.g.) sonnet
136 and he curses himself for being a wilfully blind fool, unable to
see what is in front of him. (This implies a change in my view of the
Dark Lady sonnets, about which I hope to add a trailer to this
posting.)

Line 1. He calls Love the blind fool, but as the poem develops the
words become much more appropriate to himself. Cupid is normally
pictured blind, of course, because he strikes at random. He is not
often called a fool, so far as I remember, and so I have assumed this
refers to his jesting at the expense of his victims.

Line 6. Ships ride at anchor in the bay that was their destination.
But when the poet says 'all men' instead of 'all ships', he is leading
up to the third quatrain and its plain accusations of faithlessness.

Line 14, 'this false plague'. The speaker's mistress seems to him no
better than a disease, because of her faithlessness. But he still
cannot free himself.

This sonnet convinces me that the sexual language and accusations of
promiscuity in the Dark Lady sonnets must be taken seriously, in the
sense that the speaker intends them. So I come to the following
provisional conclusions.

These sonnets at the end of the book (127-154) are about a love
affair. That does not entitle us to say they are about an identifiable
affair between two identifiable people - identifiable now or at any
time in the past.

Each sonnet (or pair or group) is a picture of a situation or mood
that forms part of such an affair. That is different from telling the
story of the affair; there is hardly any narrative. So there is no
particular reason to think of these situations as happening
consecutively. The order may be purely literary.

There is explicit sexual content in the sonnets. So in sonnet 129
('Th'expense of spirit in a waste of shame') intercourse has taken
place (as the lawyers say) and the speaker has taken the let-down
afterwards very hard ('omne animal post coitum triste est', 'every
living creature is miserable after intercourse' says Pliny's Natural
History). I now look on 129 as a 'Dark Lady' sonnet.

It follows by contrast that sonnets 18-125 are not about a love
affair. They never could have been, because they are addressed to a
man. Sonnet 20 says that about as plainly as it could be said, short
of using words that would not be allowed. That leads to some more
elaborate conclusions.

18-125 are sonnets and so must do adequate obeisance to the sonnet
tradition. Also, they must eulogise the addressee. But very often,
though those two things are done, the situation or mood conveyed comes
from somewhere else. Going to bed in a strange inn miles from anywhere
and trying to get to sleep, travelling long days on a reluctant horse,
going out without a coat and getting caught in the rain - these are
the poetical subjects of their respective sonnets, although they are
not the official subjects. The official subject may be represented in
a metaphor, and the metaphor itself be the poetical subject.

Perhaps it is time to stop, in the hope of avoiding the plunge into
dithyrambic nonsense.

I don't see why this follows at all. Why does this group of
sonnets have to 'contrast' with the remainder in the first place? And
if there is some sort of intended contrast, perhaps it is between an
enjoyable love affair and an unenjoyable one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Homosexuality (or bisexuality) did not exist in the

True. And if the relationship depicted in Sonnets 18-125 does
not change, then that's the end of it. But they do seem to depict a
changing relationship: in one part the addressee is complimented on
his loyalty, in another he is chastised for disloyalty. So perhaps
the nature of the relationship also changes.

This is not to say that I think the relationship in Sonnets
18-125 are sexual in nature. Some times when I think about it I think
they may be, other times not. But I think it's a possibility. And I
find it interesting the way some people try to slam the door shut on
such a possible interpretation.

Sorry, getting cryptic. I mean that 127-154 are about a love affair
and therefore they have certain characteristics - the ones I listed.
18-125 do not possess those characteristics, and I use that as an
argument for saying 18-125 are not about a love affair. If, if p then
q, then, if not q then not p.

(I don't know yet if this applies all the way to 154 - we shall see.)

Maybe. I am tending to think of aspects or moods rather than a
chronological record of events. That is the reason for calling it a
picture rather than a story. But nothing can be fixed, so far!

Well, here we are at sonnet 137, second time round. 291 weeks - not
exactly rushing towards a conclusion!. I am just trying to explain the
phenomena, which include the above differences between 18-125 and
127-154.

Right, Paul, YOU would--but no poet would, or any sane person, for that matter.
Such idiotic &quot;humor&quot; would go against the tone of the poem, the matter of the
other lines in the poem, and the context of the sequence as a whole, aside from
being clumsy and plain stupid. And using the words involved in their normal way
conveys a meaning satisfactory to just about every reader of the poem who has
commented on it, so there is no point in assuming the poet turned bizarro.

I note that when Shakespeare uses sonnets in his plays, you take &quot;he&quot; to mean
&quot;he.&quot; I note also that no poet has ever written poems with gender jokes like
those you claim are here.

Always the &quot;must.&quot; And phrases like &quot;fully aware.&quot; If you knew anything about
poetry and poets and art, Paul, you'd know that often poets write poems that are
mostly over the heads of their intended readers. The poet writes for himself,
and hopes SOMEone will appreciate what he says, and that his addressee will get
the gist of it, and enough to enjoy what he's written. I speak from experience,
Paul. You speak only from a rigidnikal need to believe that sonnets written by
the demigod you must believe wrote them could only have been written to a queen,
Jesus's mother having already gone to Heaven.

&gt;good reason for continuing the tone and the
&gt;fashion) I MAY well say that she was 'pricked

&gt;&gt; That leads to some more elaborate conclusions.

&gt;&gt; 18-125 are sonnets and so must do adequate obeisance to the sonnet
&gt;&gt; tradition. Also, they must eulogise the addressee.

&gt;Does not follow.

Not from the above. But we can see it from the poems themselves.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; But very often,
&gt;&gt; though those two things are done, the situation or mood conveyed comes
&gt;&gt; from somewhere else. Going to bed in a strange inn miles from anywhere
&gt;&gt; and trying to get to sleep, travelling long days on a reluctant horse,
&gt;&gt; going out without a coat and getting caught in the rain - these are
&gt;&gt; the poetical subjects of their respective sonnets, although they are
&gt;&gt; not the official subjects. The official subject may be represented in
&gt;&gt; a metaphor, and the metaphor itself be the poetical subject.

&gt;The poet was unquestionably taking the
&gt;sonnet tradition and subverting it in ways
&gt;that amused both himself and his
&gt;addressee. That person _must_ have
&gt;been highly familiar with that tradition,
&gt;shared the poet's sense of humour and
&gt;been fully aware of what he was doing.

I don't see that these 154 sonnets were written for amusement. One or

I'd put 'seriously' into quotation marks.
Humour was always an element -- as it

I think you are liable to be seriously mis-

of humour.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; These sonnets at the end of the book (127-154) are about a love

&gt;&gt;Not necessarily so. They express attitudes
&gt;&gt;and opinions about sex and sexual matters.
&gt;&gt;That does not necessarily imply 'a love affair'

&gt; I go on to deal with that.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That does not entitle us to say they are about an identifiable
&gt;&gt;&gt; affair between two identifiable people - identifiable now or at any
&gt;&gt;&gt; time in the past.

&gt;&gt;We can eliminate a lot of people. We can
&gt;&gt;specify some (perhaps very few, and maybe
&gt;&gt;only two) who would fit.

&gt; I don't see where this is coming from. Certainly not the same place as
&gt; the previous comment. I am trying to build up a consistent position;
&gt; these objections seem to come from an inconsistent one. I am saying
&gt; these sonnets form a group, built around a love affair, which is not
&gt; necessarily (even probably?) a literally factual affair. More likely
&gt; it is built up from features based on various different people, most
&gt; of whom we have never heard of.

"/>

I don't follow you here. Like the great majority
of commentators, I see one addressee for
1-126. I see one relationship, one 'love affair',
although one that was never consummated
(nor expected to be consummated). That
very absence allows for degrees of freedom
and honesty not available -- nor relevant -- in
normal sexual relationships. In those, much
of the communication is through the sex.
These sonnets are a substitute for all that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;The question of why there is (virtually) no

&gt; That is one of the things I am doing. At present, I am suggesting the

While the poet does want to give us something
timeless, I believe that he achieves that by an
examination of the immediate and the

&gt;&gt;it -- at some time and with someone. But
&gt;&gt;possibly (probably?) NOT with the addressee.

I was trying to point out to you that the term

than you appear to grasp. Numerous courtiers

with the Queen. Are we to take their words

affairs'. That is Robert's logic -- and yours.

In none (or very few) of those proclamations
was consummation even considered.
Indeed the idea would have horrified most
of them -- especially the Queen herself.
Partly it was a resurrection of the early
Medieval notion of 'Courtly Love' (which had
no room for eroticism). Partly, the Queen
had replaced the Virgin Mary, invoking a
similar response.

Shakespeare (being who he was, and being
in such a close, yet non-sexual, relationship
with the Queen) could explore the idea of
sexuality, its absurdity in their situation and
its absurdity in general.

WHAT IS THE ANT, SIR? By Bernard Leikind

&lt;&lt;God sits in the captain's chair in the Universe's control room wearing
a virtual reality helmet. Angels waft gently from one flickering control
panel to another, adjusting the knobs and peering at computer screens.
Are they PCs or Macs? Wouldn't you like to know? They are running a
pre-creation simulation of the Universe. The knobs control the
fundamental properties of the Universe. Time has not yet been created so
nobody is in a hurry, or maybe everything is happening at once. &quot;What's
the matter with you?&quot; God snaps at one of the angels. &quot;The speed of
light is much too slow. I thought we agreed on 300,000 kilometers per
second.&quot; An angel spins a dial to a new setting and carefully adjusts
the vernier. &quot;That's much better,&quot; God says as he relaxes back into his
chair. &quot;Let me see. Didn't we agree that in order to achieve my purpose
for the Universe the fine structure constant must be precisely
1/137.036? Where are my notes? Yes. Here it is-- 1/137.036, exactly.&quot; An
angel drifts to the electromagnetic field section and carefully adjusts
a control until the display shows this peculiar number. Following God's
instructions the angels set all the other fundamental numbers. God
removes the helmet which has displayed simulations of the
Universe-to-be. &quot;It looks good to me.&quot; In a moment commemorated on
T-shirts, God gazes at a blackboard with Maxwell's equations on it, and
commands, &quot;Let there be light!&quot;

Suddenly a tiny universe appears. Expanding at breakneck speed, it thins
and cools. Galaxies form and stars flicker on. Around a minor star in an
average galaxy a planet congeals. Do you get the picture?

Fast forward about five billion years. God's plan is working. At about
the same time that the most advanced nation on Earth produces humanity's
crowning achievement--the Golden Arches-- physicist Wolfgang Pauli dies.
An angel ushers him into God's study. &quot;Wolfgang,&quot; God says, &quot;I liked
your work about the exclusion principle. You really figured out what I
was up to. And I especially admired how you deduced the existence of the
neutrino. I did my best to hide it. I gave it hardly any properties at
all. I invited you to visit me because I thought that you might have
some questions for me.&quot;

Pauli asks the question that every physicist would ask given the chance:
&quot;I always wondered why the fine structure constant is 1/137.036.&quot;

&quot;A good question.&quot; God walks to his blackboard and begins filling it
with differential equations and geometric diagrams. Finally he finishes
the proof and brushes the chalk dust from his hands and robe. God turns
to Pauli and smiles.

&quot;It's a beautiful and clever proof,&quot; Pauli declares. &quot;Certainly up to
your usual standards. But over there, on the third line from the bottom,
I believe that minus sign should be a plus sign. Let's see. That changes
the result to 1 over 32 times 42 or 1/144.&quot;

&quot;Gee willikers.&quot; God is dismayed. &quot;I wonder why no one ever noticed that
before?&quot; Reaching to the control panel, God adjusts the fine structure
constant to 1/144. &quot;At least its a round number. That .036 always
bothered me.&quot;

But suddenly the universe begins to change. Electromagnetic forces
weaken, the stars shrink and their cores heat. The higher temperatures
increase the rate of nuclear fusion, heating the stars even more.
Gradually they became more brilliant. The Earth, which has already
changed radically as chemical forces adjusted themselves to the new
value, rapidly roasts to a crisp, barren rock.

Physicists know many numbers like the fine structure constant that seem
to have a precisely set value. Even the tiniest change in any one of
these numbers would change the Universe so radically that life as we
know it could not exist. If there were only a few of these numbers, or
if they didn't have to be so precisely tuned, they wouldn't intrigue
physicists so much. But there seem to be many of them. Those inclined to
seek purpose in the Universe point to these remarkably adjusted numbers
as evidence that there must be a plan.

Quantum physics teaches us that observers contribute to the results of
measurements that they make. Since the Universe is a quantum system,
some distinguished physicists have argued that, in a sense, we create
the Universe by observing it.

These two streams of thought converge to produce the Anthropic
Principle; that the Universe somehow exists for us and that we are an
expression of its purpose. Humans, so some thinkers would have it, are
so remarkable that we must be the fruition of some grand design. Of
course, a world that contains Geraldo, the OJ trial, Mozart, the
Hillside Strangler, Rembrandt, the Bosnian war, Newt Gingrich,
Shakespeare, and Einstein seems to some a chaotic madhouse.
Seekers for purpose, like the author of Job,
often propose that God must have inscrutable goals.&gt;&gt;

&gt; MISCELLANIES UPON VARIOUS SUBJECTS.
&gt; BY JOHN AUBREY, F.RS.
&gt; http://library28.tripod.com/13-1.html

&gt; It is fit to consider the length of a Roman year.
&gt; Julius Caesar by an edict commanded that number of 365 1/4
&gt; to be observed, and therefore it is called a Julian year. Three
&gt; Julians and an half have days 1278 3/8, but Julian years 1378 3/8
&gt; are 1278 Julian years, and days 136 31/32; or almost 137 days.

&gt; Sonnet 137

&gt;&gt; THOU blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
&gt;&gt; That they behold, and see not what they see?
&gt;&gt; They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
&gt;&gt; Yet what the best is take the worst to be.
&gt;&gt; If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,
&gt;&gt; Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,
&gt;&gt; Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
&gt;&gt; Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
&gt;&gt; Why should my heart think that a several plot
&gt;&gt; Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
&gt;&gt; Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,
&gt;&gt; To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
&gt;&gt; In things right true my heart and eyes have err'd,
&gt;&gt; And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.
&gt; -------------------------------------------
&gt; Spectral lines of simple elements like hydrogen are split in a
&gt; distinct hierarchy of wide gaps, narrow gaps and then even narrower
&gt; gaps. The hierarchical splitting of these &quot;fine spectral lines&quot; is based
&gt; upon a simple ratio of 1/137 = the absolute strength of the electro
&gt; magnetic force. An electron in a hydrogen atom travels at 1/137 the
&gt; speed of light because that is the absolute strength of its electrical
&gt; attraction to the nucleus. 1/137 defines the size of atoms and just
&gt; about everything else happening in the physical universe:

What is your point, if any, Art? That Masonic conspirators knew
about the fine structure constant?! Or that the Creator belatedly set
its value at 1/137 to allude to the Sonnet above?! I'm not sure which

&gt; WHAT IS THE ANT, SIR? By Bernard Leikind

&gt;&lt;&lt;God sits in the captain's chair in the Universe's control room wearing
&gt; a virtual reality helmet. Angels waft gently from one flickering control
&gt; panel to another, adjusting the knobs and peering at computer screens.
&gt; Are they PCs or Macs? Wouldn't you like to know? They are running a
&gt; pre-creation simulation of the Universe. The knobs control the
&gt; fundamental properties of the Universe. Time has not yet been created so
&gt; nobody is in a hurry, or maybe everything is happening at once. &quot;What's
&gt; the matter with you?&quot; God snaps at one of the angels. &quot;The speed of
&gt; light is much too slow. I thought we agreed on 300,000 kilometers per
&gt; second.&quot; An angel spins a dial to a new setting and carefully adjusts
&gt; the vernier. &quot;That's much better,&quot; God says as he relaxes back into his
&gt; chair. &quot;Let me see. Didn't we agree that in order to achieve my purpose
&gt; for the Universe the fine structure constant must be precisely
&gt; 1/137.036? Where are my notes? Yes. Here it is-- 1/137.036, exactly.&quot; An
&gt; angel drifts to the electromagnetic field section and carefully adjusts
&gt; a control until the display shows this peculiar number. Following God's
&gt; instructions the angels set all the other fundamental numbers. God
&gt; removes the helmet which has displayed simulations of the
&gt; Universe-to-be. &quot;It looks good to me.&quot; In a moment commemorated on
&gt; T-shirts, God gazes at a blackboard with Maxwell's equations on it, and
&gt; commands, &quot;Let there be light!&quot;

&gt; Suddenly a tiny universe appears. Expanding at breakneck speed, it thins
&gt; and cools. Galaxies form and stars flicker on. Around a minor star in an
&gt; average galaxy a planet congeals. Do you get the picture?

&gt; Fast forward about five billion years. God's plan is working. At about
&gt; the same time that the most advanced nation on Earth produces humanity's
&gt; crowning achievement--the Golden Arches-- physicist Wolfgang Pauli dies.
&gt; An angel ushers him into God's study. &quot;Wolfgang,&quot; God says, &quot;I liked

Happy birthday, Art -- although one can't help but regret that you
chose to commemorate the occasion by making a complete ass of yourself,
citing the authority of Henry Ford concerning history. Ford exhibited
monumental incompetence in that area rivalling even your own farcical
ineptness -- that's no mean feat.

In any event, your disclosures above concerning your understanding of
the rate of aging of yourself and of the uniVERse shed a good deal of
light upon those comic temporal gaffes that have earned you an honorary
lifetime membership in the Caruana Club for Chronologically Clueless
Cretins.

Go easy on the cake, though.

Book Of The Dead - Page 8

[THE FOLLOWING] WORDS SHALL BE SAID BY THE STEWARD
OF THE KEEPER OF THE SEAL, NU, WHOSE WORD IS TRUTH

I have not defrauded the gods of their cake-offerings.
I have not carried off the fenkhu cakes [offered to] the Spirits.
I have not committed fornication.
I have not masturbated [in the sanctuaries of the god of my city].
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;The holiday of VESTA, Goddess of the hearth. The VESTAl Virgins
employ the mola salsa, the holy cake, in the celebrations of the day.
First, water is drawn by the Virgins from a sacred spring; the water may
not be set down on the ground (contact with the earth would destroy its
sacred nature), and is carried in narrow-bottomed vessels to prevent
this. The salt used in the cakes is specially made from brine brought
in a salt pan and then ground in a mortar and baked in a jar. Women
who wish to make offerings to VESTA in her temple during the VESTAlia
usually offer sacrifices of simple food, borne on a platter. When doing
so, women go barefoot. Only women (and the Pontifex Maximus) were
allowed in the temple of VESTA. Bakers and millers also honor this day,
and the various tools of their trade (millstones and the beasts of
burden used to turn them) are garlanded with violets and small loaves.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;On VESTAlia, priestesses traveled to the rivers to throw from a wooden
bridge small images of men into the waters. This was done as a sacrifice
to the ancient ones to protect the living.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;[On June 9, 1865 Dickens] saw the other first-class carriages lying at
the bottom of the river bed. With his familiar aplomb he went returned
to the teetering carriage, and took out a travelling flask of brandy as
well as his top hat. He filled his top hat with water, clambered down
the bank, and then began his work among the injured and the dead. He
found a man with a cracked skull; he gave the man some brandy, *poured*
a bit of water on his face, and laid him on the grass beside the stream.
The man said only &quot;I am gone,&quot; and then died.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;The feriae of the VESTAlia (June 9) are the focal point in the
activities of the VESTAls during June. They would offer prayers &amp; sing
songs on behalf of the state and individual households. Libations of
wine would be *poured* on the ground &amp; altars as well as into goblets
for drinking. Donkeys would be garlanded with wreaths &amp; cakes
in honor of the bakers and millers.&gt;&gt;

G.A.O.T.U. = Gâteau

Les Miserables by Victor Hugo

&quot;What are you crying about?&quot; demanded his father.
&quot;I am not hungry any more,&quot; said the child.
The father's smile became more accentuated.
&quot;One does not need to be hungry in order to eat a CAKE.&quot;
&quot;My CAKE tires me. It is stale.&quot;
&quot;Don't you want any more of it?&quot;
&quot;No.&quot;
The father pointed to the swans.
&quot;Throw it to those palmipeds.&quot;
The child hesitated. A person may not want any more of his CAKE;
but that is no reason for giving it away.
The father went on:
&quot;Be humane. You must have compassion on animals.&quot;
And, taking the CAKE from his son, he flung it into the basin.
The CAKE fell very near the edge.
The swans were far away, in the centre of the basin, and busy
with some prey. They had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche.

Two little waifs had approached the brioche
at the same time as the swans. It was floating on the water.
The smaller of them stared at the CAKE, the elder gazed after the
retreating bourgeois.

Father and son entered the labyrinth of walks which leads to the grand
flight of steps near the clump of trees on the side of the Rue Madame.
As soon as they had disappeared from view, the elder child hastily
flung himself flat on his stomach on the rounding curb of the basin,
and clinging to it with his left hand, and leaning over the water,
on the verge of falling in, he stretched out his right hand with his
stick towards the CAKE. The swans, perceiving the enemy, made haste,
and in so doing, they produced an effect of their breasts which was of
service to the little fisher; the water flowed back before the swans,
and one of these gentle concentric undulations softly floated
the brioche towards the child's wand. Just as the swans came up,
the stick touched the CAKE. The child gave it a brisk rap, drew in
the brioche, frightened away the swans, seized the CAKE, and sprang
to his feet. The CAKE was wet; but they were hungry and thirsty.
The elder broke the CAKE into two portions, a large one and a small one,
took the small one for himself, gave the large one to his brother,
and said to him: &quot;Ram that into your muzzle.&quot;
---------------------------------------------------------------
&quot;To return to the ship,&quot; Hook replied slowly through his teeth,
&quot;and cook a large rich CAKE of a jolly thickness with green sugar
on it. There can be but one room below, for there is but one
chimney. The silly moles had not the sense to see that they did
not need a door apiece. That shows they have no mother. We will
leave the CAKE on the shore of the Mermaids' Lagoon. These boys
are always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids. They
will find the CAKE and they will gobble it up, because, having no
mother, they don't know how dangerous 'tis to eat rich damp
CAKE.&quot; He burst into laughter, not hollow laughter now, but
honest laughter. &quot;Aha, they will die.&quot;
Smee had listened with growing admiration.
&quot;It's the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!&quot; he
cried, and in their exultation they danced and sang:
&quot;Avast, belay, when I appear,
By fear they're overtook;
Nought's left upon your bones when you
Have shaken claws with Hook.&quot;
They began the verse, but they never finished it, for another
sound broke in and stilled them. The was at first such a tiny
sound that a leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it, but
as it came nearer it was more distinct.
Tick tick tick tick.!
---------------------------------------------------------------
Great Expectations by Charles Dickens

&lt;&lt;The most prominent object was a long table with a table- cloth spread
on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the
clocks all stopped together. An epergne or centre- piece of some kind
was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs
that its form was quite undistinguishable; and, as I looked along the
yellow expanse out of which I remember its seeming to grow, like a black
fungus, I saw speckled-legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home
to it, and running out from it, as if some circumstance of the greatest
public importance had just transpired in the spider community. I heard
the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same occurrence were
important to their interests. But, the blackbeetles took no notice of
the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a ponderous elderly way,
as if they were short-sighted and hard of hearing, and not on terms with
one another. These crawling things had fascinated my attention and I was
watching them from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon
my shoulder. In her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which
she leaned, and she looked like the Witch of the place. `This,' said
she, pointing to the long table with her stick, `is where I will be laid
when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.' With some vague
misgiving that she might get upon the table then and there and die at
once, the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork at the Fair, I
shrank under her touch. `What do you think that is?' she asked me, again
pointing with her stick; `that, where those cobwebs are?' `I can't guess
what it is, ma'am.' `It's a great CAKE. A bride-CAKE.&gt;&gt;

Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain

Tom took something out of his pocket.
&quot;Do you remember this?&quot; said he.
Becky almost smiled.
&quot;It's our wedding-CAKE, Tom.&quot;
&quot;Yes -- I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it's all
we've got.&quot;
&quot;I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on,
Tom, the way grown-up people do with wedding-CAKE -- but it'll be our
--&quot;
She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom
divided the CAKE and Becky ate with good appetite,
while Tom ...

word (gwum), in 1Ki 17:12, the only other passage where it occurs, means
&quot;a CAKE.&quot; Hence (gwam ygal) is interpreted by Gesenius and others to
mean, hangers on at the table of the rich (literally &quot;CAKE mockers&quot;),
whose business it was, by witticisms and buffoonery to make
entertainment for the guests, and who got their dinner in return, like
the qwisokolakez, knisololakes, and the Medieval Lat. buccellarii. Then
the words would mean, &quot;Amongst the most profane.&quot; (Would not our
word loafers be analogous to these cake eaters of antiquity!)&gt;&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------
Les Miserables by Victor Hugo

&quot;What are you crying about?&quot; demanded his father.
&quot;I am not hungry any more,&quot; said the child.
The father's smile became more accentuated.
&quot;One does not need to be hungry in order to eat a CAKE.&quot;
&quot;My CAKE tires me. It is stale.&quot;
&quot;Don't you want any more of it?&quot;
&quot;No.&quot;
The father pointed to the swans.
&quot;Throw it to those palmipeds.&quot;
The child hesitated. A person may not want any more of his CAKE;
but that is no reason for giving it away.
The father went on:
&quot;Be humane. You must have compassion on animals.&quot;
And, taking the CAKE from his son, he flung it into the basin.
The CAKE fell very near the edge.
The swans were far away, in the centre of the basin, and busy
with some prey. They had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche.

Two little waifs had approached the brioche
at the same time as the swans. It was floating on the water.
The smaller of them stared at the CAKE, the elder gazed after the
retreating bourgeois.

Father and son entered the labyrinth of walks which leads to the grand
flight of steps near the clump of trees on the side of the Rue Madame.
As soon as they had disappeared from view, the elder child hastily
flung himself flat on his stomach on the rounding curb of the basin,
and clinging to it with his left hand, and leaning over the water,
on the verge of falling in, he stretched out his right hand with his
stick towards the CAKE. The swans, perceiving the enemy, made haste,
and in so doing, they produced an effect of their breasts which was of
service to the little fisher; the water flowed back before the swans,
and one of these gentle concentric undulations softly floated
the brioche towards the child's wand. Just as the swans came up,
the stick touched the CAKE. The child gave it a brisk rap, drew in
the brioche, frightened away the swans, seized the CAKE, and sprang
to his feet. The CAKE was wet; but they were hungry and thirsty.
The elder broke the CAKE into two portions, a large one and a small one,
took the small one for himself, gave the large one to his brother,
and said to him: &quot;Ram that into your muzzle.&quot;
---------------------------------------------------------------
&quot;To return to the ship,&quot; Hook replied slowly through his teeth,
&quot;and cook a large rich CAKE of a jolly thickness with green sugar
on it. There can be but one room below, for there is but one
chimney. The silly moles had not the sense to see that they did
not need a door apiece. That shows they have no mother. We will
leave the CAKE on the shore of the Mermaids' Lagoon. These boys
are always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids. They
will find the CAKE and they will gobble it up, because, having no
mother, they don't know how dangerous 'tis to eat rich damp
CAKE.&quot; He burst into laughter, not hollow laughter now, but
honest laughter. &quot;Aha, they will die.&quot;
Smee had listened with growing admiration.
&quot;It's the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!&quot; he
cried, and in their exultation they danced and sang:
&quot;Avast, belay, when I appear,
By fear they're overtook;
Nought's left upon your bones when you
Have shaken claws with Hook.&quot;
They began the verse, but they never finished it, for another
sound broke in and stilled them. The was at first such a tiny
sound that a leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it, but
as it came nearer it was more distinct.
Tick tick tick tick.!

Great Expectations by Charles Dickens

&lt;&lt;The most prominent object was a long table with a table- cloth spread
on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the
clocks all stopped together. An epergne or centre- piece of some kind
was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs
that its form was quite undistinguishable; and, as I looked along the
yellow expanse out of which I remember its seeming to grow, like a black
fungus, I saw speckled-legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home
to it, and running out from it, as if some circumstance of the greatest
public importance had just transpired in the spider community. I heard
the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same occurrence were
important to their interests. But, the blackbeetles took no notice of
the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a ponderous elderly way,
as if they were short-sighted and hard of hearing, and not on terms with
one another. These crawling things had fascinated my attention and I was
watching them from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon
my shoulder. In her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which
she leaned, and she looked like the Witch of the place. `This,' said
she, pointing to the long table with her stick, `is where I will be laid
when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.' With some vague
misgiving that she might get upon the table then and there and die at
once, the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork at the Fair, I
shrank under her touch. `What do you think that is?' she asked me, again
pointing with her stick; `that, where those cobwebs are?' `I can't guess
what it is, ma'am.' `It's a great CAKE. A bride-CAKE.&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------
Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain

Tom took something out of his pocket.
&quot;Do you remember this?&quot; said he.
Becky almost smiled.
&quot;It's our wedding-CAKE, Tom.&quot;
&quot;Yes -- I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it's all
we've got.&quot;
&quot;I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on,
Tom, the way grown-up people do with wedding-CAKE -- but it'll be our
--&quot;
She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom
divided the CAKE and Becky ate with good appetite,
while Tom nibbled at his moiety.

Ophelia They say the owl was a baker's daughter.

&lt;&lt;Jesus, in the guise of a beggar, came to a baker's shop to ask for
some food. The baker put some dough into the oven to make a loaf of
bread for the supposed beggar, but the baker's daughter, overcome with
niggardliness, decided that the gift was too great and cut the dough in
half. She was promptly turned into an owl as punishment&gt;&gt;

&quot;Lord, we know what we are (baker's daughter),
but know not what we may be (owl).&quot;

&lt;&lt;The Owl was a Baker's Daughter. According to legend, our Saviour went
into a baker's shop to ask for something to eat. The mistress of the
shop instantly put a CAKE into the oven for Him, but the daughter said
it was too large, and reduced it half. The dough, however, swelled to an
enormous size, and the daughter cried out, ?Heugh! heugh! heugh!? and
was transformed into an owl.&gt;&gt;
