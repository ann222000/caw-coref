http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality

&quot;A cult of personality or personality cult arises when a country's
leader uses mass media to create a larger-than-life public image
through unquestioning flattery and praise. The term often refers as
well to leaders who did not use such methods during their lifetime,
but are built up in the mass media by later governments. Cults of
personality are often found in dictatorships but some can be found in
some democracies as well.

A cult of personality is the same as from general hero worship in that
it is specifically built around political leaders. However, the term
cult of personality is often applied by analogy to refer to adulation
of non-political leaders; an argument could easily be made, however,
that the only notable differences to be found between the terms &quot;hero
worship,&quot; &quot;cult of personality,&quot; or even, more simply, excessive
admiration are largely in the context of the person making the
accusation.&quot;

Life Without Chiefs By Marvin Harris

Can humans exist without some people ruling and others being ruled? To
look at the modern world, you wouldn't think so. Democratic states may
have done away with emperors and kings, but they have hardly dispensed
with gross inequalities in wealth, rank, and power.

However, humanity hasn't always lived this way. For about 98 percent
of our existence as a species (and for four million years before
then), our ancestors lived in small, largely nomadic hunting-and-
gathering bands containing about 30 to 50 people apiece. It was in
this social context that human nature evolved. It has been only about
ten thousand years since people began to settle down into villages,
some of which eventually grew into cities. And it has been only in the
last two thousand years that the majority of people in the world have
not lived in hunting-and-gathering societies. This brief period of
time is not nearly sufficient for noticeable evolution to have taken
place. Thus, the few remaining foraging societies are the closest
analogues we have to the &quot;natural&quot; state of humanity.

To judge from surviving examples of hunting-and-gathering bands and
villages, our kind got along quite well for the greater part of
prehistory without so much as a paramount chief. In fact, for tens of
thousands of years, life went on without kings, queens, prime
ministers, presidents, parliaments, congresses, cabinets, governors,
and mayors--not to mention the police officers, sheriffs, marshals,
generals, lawyers, bailiffs, judges, district attorneys, court clerks,
patrol cars, paddy wagons, jails, and penitentiaries that help keep
them in power. How in the world did our ancestors ever manage to leave
home without them?

Small populations provide part of the answer. With 50 people per band
or 150 per village, everybody knew everybody else intimately. People
gave with the expectation of taking and took with the expectation of
giving. Because chance played a great role in the capture of animals,
collection of wild foodstuffs, and success of rudimentary forms of
agriculture, the individuals who had the luck of the catch on one day
needed a handout on the next. So the best way for them to provide for
their inevitable rainy day was to be generous. As expressed by
anthropologist Richard Gould, &quot;The greater the amount of risk, the
greater the extent of sharing.&quot; Reciprocity is a small society's bank.

In reciprocal exchange, people do not specify how much or exactly what
they expect to get back or when they expect to get it. That would
besmirch the quality of that transaction and make it similar to mere
barter or to buying and selling. The distinction lingers on in
societies dominated by other forms of exchange, even capitalist ones.
For we do carry out a give-and-take among close kin and friends that
is informal, uncalculating, and imbued with a spirit of generosity.
Teenagers do not pay cash for their meals at home or for the use of
the family car, wives do not bill their husbands for cooking a meal,
and friends give each other birthday gifts and Christmas presents. But
much of this is marred by the expectation that our generosity will be
acknowledged with expression of thanks.

Where reciprocity really prevails in daily life, etiquette requires
that generosity be taken for granted. As Robert Dentan discovered
during his fieldwork among the Semai of Central Malaysia, no one ever
says &quot;thank you&quot; for the meat received from another hunter. Having
struggled all day to lug the carcass of a pig home through the jungle
heat, the hunter allows his prize to be cut up into exactly equal
portions, which he then gives away to the entire group. Dentan
explains that to express gratitude for the portion received indicates
that you are the kind of ungenerous person who calculates how much you
give and take: &quot;In this context, saying 'thank you' is very rude, for
it suggests, first, that one has calculated the amount of a gift and,
second, that one did not expect the donor to be so generous.&quot; To call
attention to one's Â generosity is to indicate that others are in debt
to you and that you expect them to repay you. It is repugnant to
egalitarian peoples even to suggest that they have been treated
generously.

Canadian anthropologist Richard Lee tells how, through a revealing
incident, he learned about this aspect of reciprocity. To please the !
Kung, the &quot;bushmen&quot; of the Kalahari desert, he decided to buy a large
ox and have it slaughtered as a present. After days of searching Bantu
agricultural villages for the largest and fattest ox in the region, he
acquired what appeared to be a perfect specimen. But his friends took
him aside and assured him that he had been duped into buying an
absolutely worthless animal. &quot;Of course, we will eat it,&quot; they said,
&quot;but it won't fill us up--we will eat and go home to bed with stomachs
rumbling.&quot; Yet, when Lee's ox was slaughtered, it turned out to be
covered with a thick layer of fat. Later, his friends explained why
they had said his gift was valueless, even though they knew better
than he what lay under the animal's skin:

&quot;Yes, when a young man kills much meat he comes to think of himself as
a chief or a big man, and he thinks of the rest of us as his servants
or inferiors. We can't accept this, we refuse one who boasts, for
someday his pride will make him kill somebody. So we always speak of
his meat as worthless. This way we cool his heart and make him
gentle.&quot;

Lee watched small groups of men and women returning home every evening
with the animals and wild fruits and plants that they had killed or
collected. They shared everything equally, even with campmates who had
stayed behind and spent the day sleeping or taking care of their tools
and weapons.

&quot;Not only do families pool that day's production, but the entire camp--
residents and visitors alike--shares equally in the total quantity of
food available,&quot; Lee observed. &quot;The evening meal of any one family is
made up of portions of food from each of the other families resident.
There is a constant flow of nuts, berries, roots, and melons from one
family fireplace to another, until each person has received an
equitable portion. The following morning a different combination of
foragers moves out of camp, and when they return late in the day, the
distribution of foodstuffs is repeated.&quot;

In small, pre-state societies, it was in everybody's best interest to
maintain each other's freedom of access to the natural habitat.
Suppose a !Kung with a lust for power were to get up and tell his
campmates, &quot;From now on, all this land and everything on it belongs to
me. I'll let you use it but only with my permission and on the
condition that I get first choice of anything you capture, collect, or
grow.&quot; His campmates, thinking that he had certainly gone crazy, would
pack up their few belongings, take a long walk, make a new camp, and
resume their usual life of egalitarian reciprocity. The man who would
be king would be left by himself to exercise a useless sovereignty.

THE HEADMAN: LEADERSHIP, NOT POWER

To the extent that political leadership exists at all among band-and-
village societies, it is exercised by individuals called headmen.
These headmen, however, lack the power to compel others to obey their
orders. How can a leader be powerful and still lead?

The political power of genuine rulers depends on their ability to
expel or exterminate disobedient individuals and groups. When a
headman gives a command, however, he has no certain physical means of
punishing those who disobey. So, if he wants to stay in &quot;office,&quot; he
gives few commands. Among the Eskimo, for instance, a group will
follow an outstanding hunter and defer to his opinion with respect to
choice of hunting spots. But in all other matters, the leader's
opinion carries no more weight than any other man's. Similarly, among
the !Kung, each band has its recognized leaders, most of whom are
males. These men speak out more than others and are listened to with a
bit more deference. But they have no formal authority and can only
persuade, never command. When Lee asked the !Kung whether they had
headmen--meaning powerful Â chiefs--they told him, &quot;Of course we have
headmen! In fact, we are all headmen. Each one of us is headman over
himself.&quot;

Headmanship can be a frustrating and irksome job. Among Indian groups
such as the Mehinacu of Brazil's Zingu National Park, headmen behave
something like zealous scoutmasters on Â overnight cookouts. The first
one up in the morning, the headman tries to rouse his companions by
standing in the middle of the village plaza and shouting to them. If
something needs to be done, it is the headman who starts doing it, and
it is the headman who works harder than anyone else. He sets an
example not only for hard work but also for generosity: After a
fishing or hunting expedition, he gives away more of his catch than
anyone else does. In

All too narrow, I think.

Cult of personality is the use of a person (or people) as icons to
concepts. EG love, hate, wealth, power.. etc. They do not necessarily need
to be promoted as such.
