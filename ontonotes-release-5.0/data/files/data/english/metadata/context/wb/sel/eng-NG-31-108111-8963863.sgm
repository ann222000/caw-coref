I was casually discussing training the other day with a woman who has a very
large dog and it won't heel, causing her problems.  Although I'm hardly an
expert trainer, I can teach a dog to heel, and I offered to help.  &quot;Oh,
thanks, but no,&quot; she says, &quot;Barney trains my dog.&quot;

Barney was in the group.  The tool I use on large rowdy dogs (prong collar),
he declared, is cruel.  He uses a baseball cap.

His method:  You walk with the dog beside you on a short leash, wearing a
ball cap.  If it doesn't heel, you can quickly reach up to your head, pull
off your cap, and whack the dog with it.

I kid you not.  This is what passes for training &quot;expertise&quot; in that circle.
Sheesh.

Aside from the question of where you draw the line, I expect
that some people are a little more concerned about what else
the dog is learning in addition to how to heel.  I am - I'm
not convinced that calling something a &quot;side effect&quot; is
particularly meaningful.  If the dog learns to fear men, or
Barney, or baseball caps, or leashes, or *whatever*, that's
a training effect as well.  Keeping an open mind doesn't
mean keeping it so open your brains fall out.

Electric fencing can be pretty cheap.  Fido-shock makes
a dog-strength charger that's around $40.  A couple hundred
feet of wire, say $15-20.  Get either pound-in T posts or
some PVC pipe for posts, $1-3 each.  Only need 'em every
10-15 ft.  If using T posts, you need plastic clips for the
wire, about $4 for 25. IMO best fence for confining dogs is
a combination of physical barrier and hot wire at top and bottom.

I use elec. fence to keep dogs on my property, out of the
road and away from the livestock, and it works like a charm.

Not terribly likely, if you run it along the *inside*
of the fence.  The one at the top can be offset a bit
inward rather than directly above the top of the fence.

You can also put up small signs that say &quot;Caution -

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Me and my girlfriend have finally saved up enough money to
&gt; fence in our back yard. We have decided on 4 foot chainlink.
&gt; Even with a 6 foot privacy fence neighbors can look right over
&gt; from their decks.
&gt; We were going to try a underground fence only but after reading
&gt; up and talking to people the risks just arent worth it.  I realise
&gt; some people have had them for 15+ years but they are just a
&gt; accident waiting to happen.

&gt; We have a beagle named Pokie. Very stubborn and frustrating
&gt; but a wonderful dog.  I have posted several times about our
&gt; troubles with her.

&gt; She is picky about where she takes a dump which takes 30+
&gt; minutes on walks. I'm starting to think Pokie has ocd, which is
&gt; something I also suffer from.
&gt; Anyway back to the fence questions. I was thinking of running
&gt; the radio fence wire through the chainlink to prevent her from
&gt; digging out. When she was left in the care of a relative they
&gt; caught her red handed trying to get under a chainlink fence.
&gt; This wasnt her real home though and she might of been
&gt; nervous.

&gt; I do not plan to leave her outside at night or when we are gone.
&gt; I would like to feel safe letting her run around during the day
&gt; when I'm home. I've heard underground fences are wonderful to
&gt; keep dogs from digging under or jumping the real fence.

&gt; Do you think the underground fence would cause the dog to
&gt; be vicious? I will monitor closely to make sure kids or other
&gt; dogs are not teasing her. She has never biten anyone but about
&gt; got a hold of a guys pant leg once.

&gt; She also went nuts after the ups guy when I was walking her
&gt; but they were all in our yard and she didnt know them.

&gt; Or is there another solution for staking down the fence
&gt; or something? Also with a 4 foot fence do I have to worry
&gt; about other dogs jumping it? I've seen it happen only once
&gt;  in about 20 years. I've heard since dogs are territorial generally they
&gt; will stay out especially if there is a fence.
">

I would use a regular electric fence in addition to the chainlink, not
a
&quot;radio fence,&quot; if possible.  I realize it
might not be possible in the city.  There are pet-strength
chargers available for about $40.  It comes in a kit with
10 short plastic stakes and 100' of wire.  One brand is
Fi-shock or Fido-shock, something like that.

You can buy insulator clips for chainlink fence, and
more wire, at a home improvement or feed store (about
$5-8 for 25).

Run one wire on the inside of the fence at 4-6 inches
from the ground, and that should deter digging out.
You must keep shrubs and grass from touching the
wire, or it grounds out and doesn't shock.

I'd also think about a 6ft fence rather than 4 ft if
possible.  4 ft doesn't seem tall enough to me, even
for a Beagle.
