You need an HD recorder. Standard DVDs don't have enough capacity for
HD work. A typical 1 hour HD show ends up being 3-5 gigabytes _after_
removing 17 minutes of non-program material (commercials). Cable and
satellite companies offer HD hard disc recorders for modest fees. If
you're an OTA guy like me or Wes Newell, you can use a PC as an HD
DVR. There are many ways to do it with Linux or Windows XP and tuner
cards ranging from $20 - $200. Networking multiple computers to send
your HD programs to another machine uses the same router by LinkSys or
D-link to connect the PCs for internet / LAN use. The PCs don't need
to be the latest and greatest either. Athlon 2600 is sufficient. You
DO want a big disc drive for this as HD can fill up at &gt;8 gigs / hour.
Fry's has had 500 gig drives for $100 so its not a big deal. I've been
doing it this way for almost 3 years and now have all 3 computers with
HD tuners. Works like a tivo with no monthly fees.

All depends on what the source of the HDTV show is.

If it's from any type STB, then just run A/V ouput from the box to the
input of your dvd recorder. You can then record the show, but it won't be
in HD.

If you're talking about OTA ATSC, then you can't use your old dvd recorder
to record anything, but you could buy a new DVD recorder with a built in
digital tuner and record the HDTV show in SD just like above.

If you want to record the show in actual HD, then you'll need some kind of
HD recorder. And without knowing the source of your HD programming I
couldn't offer a suggestion.

If you want to record the show in HD so when you watch it you have all
the definition, you'll need an HD recorder.  Most likely the media in
such a recorder will be a fixed hard drive (get the largest size you
can get if you might want to hang on to some programs for a while).
BR-DVD and HD-DVD recorders are still quite expensive.

If recording in SD is acceptable, you'll need some way to get an SD
program source.  This will depends on what inputs your DVD recorder has:

1.  If it has a digital tuner, it should be able to tune the HD program
and downscale it to SD for the recording.

2.  If it has an analog tuner, you'll need to find an analog duplicate
of the program to use this.

3.  If it has A/V or S-video inputs, and if you have an STB (all should
have at least one of those as outputs), you can record it that way.

Other options include getting a digital tuner for your computer (PCI or
USB) and turning it into a media center.

There's also the silly option of a camcorder on a tripod in front of the
TV screen.  The quality will suck, but some people do it.

=====================================
If your TV has outputs that can be set to 480i, you can record in SD on your
DVD recorder.

Standard Definition, 525 line basis of NTSC. Often called 480i though
in fact it's 483. Those Pesky Computer people can't be bothered with
all the lines in the system, just the ones they want to see.

Then to record it in HD so you can watch it in HD, you'll need some sort
of HD recorder. You can build your own fairly easy using a PC, or you can
buy commercial recorders. Building your own is by far the cheapest and
most versitile route for OTA. PCI ATSC Tuner cards can be had for under
$20. Put a couple in an  $200 PC and you're there. Software is free.

Standard Definition. Non-HD, basically 480i. But it will be crystal clear
if recorded from ATSC.

Most of poor old phil's response clipped, thankfully.

The correct answer is very easy to state concisely:

There is no way to record an HD TV show on your DVD recorder, you will
have to buy an HD recorder.

If you weren't an ignorant, self centered, hypocritical blow hard, you
could have been concise.

Even if I were more concise, I would not have said what you said because
what you said is simply wrong.  An HD TV show _can_ be recoded on a DVD
recorder by having it reduced to SD or ED, depending on what the recorder
can take (I've seen one that claims it will record 480p29.97 if supplied
on the component inputs).  Among the OP's options are to record in SD.

I believe in being more complete on responses by giving all the options I
am aware of.  You either do not believe that, do not practice is, or are
just not aware of the ability to downscale HD to SD and record that.

I recorded an HDTV (in HD) show last night (So you think you can dance)
on my laptop and the 1.5 hour show took 11.1 gig! even a DL DVD can only
hold ~8 gig. Unless you have a HD Recorder OR a PC with a hard disk you
can only record SD. BTW my laptop tunner only cost `$70USD. Cheap for a
HDTV DVR and I have a DVI out on the laptop to plug into the HDMI on my
HDTV.

So now you know why the HD DVD ond the Blu Ray drives exist and why
anyone who uses a PC for HD recording says get a BIG disc drive. Fry's
has 500 gigs for $100 and 750 gig for $190. As a practical option, I
picked up a 160 gig USB drive for $50 at Fry's. Nice for temporary
archiving or transporting HD files around.
