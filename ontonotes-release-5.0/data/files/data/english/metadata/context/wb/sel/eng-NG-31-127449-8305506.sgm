My pants pockets have been ejecting coins into my La-Z-Boy recliner for
years.

Yours?

Yes. Even them. Are you suggesting I don't recline? ;)

Clutter.  I try to put things back where I got them, but I still end
up with books and miscellaneous items scattered everywhere.

Oh, and I always have a wad of $1 bills in my left pocket because I
don't bother to put them in my wallet when I get change from a
purchase.  Sometimes fives and tens get mixed in there, too.  But
that's all part of the clutter thing, I guess.

I can't hear the doorbell if I'm in the back of the flat, listening to
the radio.  I spend a lot of time doing that.  People call by and
think I'm out.

Upgrading or extending the doorbell isn't an easy option; it's the

Sounds almost like the childhood fantasy about having a magic dollar bill

I used to have that problem, so I went to the optician to buy some new
frames, but he said that I didn't need to do that. He used superglue to
fix the screws in place.
