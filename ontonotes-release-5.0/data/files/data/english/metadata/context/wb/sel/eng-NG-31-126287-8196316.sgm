'Back In The Day' when I ran my Wildcat! System, I was running the D'Bridge
front end and QuickBBS for all my EchoMail/Netmail functions.

What are folks using nowadays to compile nodelists, toss mail, send netmail,
etc.?

I've looked at BinkD but wanted to know if there was anything else available.

I've checked the FIDONet page but I can't even find a nodelist to download. :/

Thanks!

I used binkd when I ran syncronet for a short time a while ago and
didn't have any problems. I'd certainly recommend it on Linux platform.

That's one of the reasons I'm looking for something else - I'm running Synchro

&gt; I've checked the FIDONet page but I can't even find a nodelist to download.

Here is a web page that lists a bunch of software for Fidonetworking.
Towards the bottom there are some links to Fido/Internet software:

http://www.geocities.com/soldaini/fidogallery/index.html

In the Fastecho echo there was some discussion about configuring BinkD and
another (started with an I, can't remember the name) might get some ideas
in there too.

Here's a link with the nodelists (most recent was July 06, 2007 so they
are current):

I was looking at Taurus - should I check out Radius or try Taurus (which is
supposed to be based on Radius).

For a tosser, Synchronet sysops uses SBBSecho almost (?) exclusively.

&gt; I've looked at BinkD but wanted to know if there was anything else available

I use Binkd for a mailer myself, but many Windows sysops use
Argus/Radius/Taurus (see http://net229.darktech.org/fidosetup/index.html ).

&gt; I've checked the FIDONet page but I can't even find a nodelist to download.

A nodelist isn't really needed any more unless you insist on sending direct
netmail, which is often impossible.

Irex does not read a Nodelist. Irex does not compile a Nodelist. Irex
uses a Nodelist, if available, to find the addresses of Nodes and
