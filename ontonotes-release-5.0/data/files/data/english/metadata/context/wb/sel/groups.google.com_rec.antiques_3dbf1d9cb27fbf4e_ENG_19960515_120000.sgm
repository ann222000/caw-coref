That paragon of Antique Correctness (AC), the Maine Antique Digest, has
been infiltrated by insisious agents of Collectibilism.

Imagine my surprise and horror when, upon scanning my new issue of MAD
today, I came across three examples of the dreaded collectible, one
of which was literally able to limbo under the 50 year hurdle.

The first was a seemingly innocent and up-to-the-minute account of
Sotheby's Jackie O auction. Cleverly mixed in with the Louis XIV
ormolu-mounted mahogany bureau plat and cartonnier and the
silver-mounted Staffordshire salt-glaze teapot was (could you just die?)
the 1960's vintage JFK golf clubs bought by that icon of pop-culture,
Arnold Schwarzenegger!!!!!!

More blatant was the report on the art pottery auction in Michigan.
McCoy cookie jars!?! Need I say more.

The coup de grace, however, was nestled in the ad for the Showcase
Antique (note: Antique NOT Antique &amp; Collectible) Center in Sturbridge.
There, in all its kitsch, was a pennant for the Ali/Foreman fight.

That was only section &quot;A&quot; of the paper. I wept. There were at least
five sections to go. I couldn't bear to face what surely lay ahead.

If these transgressions can elude even the watchful eye of Sam
Pennington, how can we ever hope to stem the tide in R.A.M.? Is all
hope lost?

You may be fighting a losing battle on this one I'm afraid.
The sacred 50 or 100 year timeline for something to classify
as an antique seems to be going by the wayside. I would
suspect that many antique dealers deal in both antiques and
collectables since there is a demand for both and they feel
&quot;why fight the tide any longer&quot; just sell the people what they
want and whether it is or isn't an antique probably does not
matter anymore. John S.

I believe our concept of time and what is &quot;old&quot; has changed as well. Most
people living today were born after the Korean War. Furnature made in the
1940s and 1950s is often sold right along side more traditional antiques
from the last century, and many people cannot tell the difference! I am
not picking
a side here just expressing a view.

As a young (24) dealer....I never presume to call anything I sell
&quot;antique&quot; or &quot;collectible&quot;. It's ALL &quot;vintage&quot;....this lets people know
it isn't new and that I'm not guaranteeing collectibility. And, if I were
judging by some of the schlock I've seen at the shows, nothing is sacred.

We never have believed in a time cutoff for antiques. A few years ago we
had a Pez container on the cover yet!

"/> They co-exist here in S.E. Georgia. Every auction I go to is announced as and
antiques &amp; collectibles auction. The understanding I get from those that run
them is that antiques are 100 yrs or older and collectibles less than 100
years and that today there are more so collectibles, at affordable prices,
which someday will become antiques than the reverse.
