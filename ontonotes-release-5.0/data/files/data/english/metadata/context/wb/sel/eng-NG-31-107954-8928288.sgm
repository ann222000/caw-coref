I noticed that front and rear tires gradually go flat when leaving my
bicycle in storage without riding it for a long period of time. Is
this normal?

Yes, the inner tube rubber is NOT completely impermeable.

Has anybody tried filling bicycle tires with nitrogen? Auto tire
dealers are offering a nitrogen fill option claiming less leakdown due
to the larger molecules.Also less pressure variation ane less corrosion
on tubeless tire wheels due to absence of water vapor and oxygen.

http://www.wellworthproducts.com/tech-articles/12.html
has a good description.  Of course bicycle tires rarely get up to
driving speeds, usually have an inner tube separating the Nitrogen
from the tire casing.  Due to bicycle tires having much less surface
area and much much less volume topping off is needed more frequently.

So according to the above thread if you keep refilling the tire with
air and the oxygen diffuses at a higher rate,then the nitrogen
percentage increases. How does the water vapor factor into this
diffusion. Does the WV stay or go out with the oxygen or do its own
thing?

So if some auto buff sells his classic car and says it has original air
in the tires he may not be completely lying!!!

It's true, and it's why car and truck air shocks and tires are filled
with nitrogen at the factory.  Not everyone uses nitrogen for tires, but
some carmakers do, and their dealers as well.

I have no idea how much less a tire will leak when filled with nitrogen
though.  Anyone with a nitrogen tank (such as for welding) want to
experiment?

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The only place I have seen nitrogen used as a welding gas is at a local
bronze foundry.  Large sculptures are cast in pieces, and welded together
using nitrogen as a shielding gas.  If I decide to have a bicycle frame cast
in bronze, I will ask them to fill the frame with nitrogen.  If I have the
whole bicycle cast, I will have them fill the tires with nitrogen.

This may not happen rght away, though.

That's the idea, but it only works if it's true that the gas is really
diffusing through the rubber in that fashion. If it's leaking out of
small holes as someone suggested in that thread (might have been jim
beam) then it's presumably coming out just as air mixed in the normal
ratios.

But then if it is leaking out of small holes, there's not much point
filling it with nitrogen.

And if it is diffusing out oxygen-first, then Mark Hickey should be
right-- topping up with air should leave the contents of the tyre
nitrogen-rich.

A crude experiment ought to be possible. You could top up a tyre several
times, then draw off some of the air (bubble it up underwater into some
kind of jar, if I remember anything from chemistry lessons), then see if
a lighted splint goes out when inserted into the upended jar. If it does
it means there's no oxygen. If it blows up in your face it means your
tyres were filled with hydrogen and oxygen.

Dear Bill,

Just a quibble, but the solubility of the gas in the rubber inner tube
has little to do with the &quot;size&quot; of the molecule.

I keep a pressure tank of N2 and inflate my bicycle
tires with it. I have not noticed any difference
from ambient air. I do it because I am too lazy

I do not have accurate numbers. I inflate my tires to
115-120 psi with N2. After about three weeks they are
about 90 psi. As far as I know there is no difference
from pumping atmosphere into tires.

You may have noticed that toy balloons also lose pressure in a short
time.  They being thinner skinned than bicycle inner tubes are also
more permeable and go flat even faster by the same mechanism.

I'm seeing terms like solubility, permeability and diffusion and I'm

The real problem may be finding tubes that have no tiny leaks, only

The gas used to fill most helium balloons is a mixture of helium and
other (heavier) gases, the mixture of which has a specific gravity low
enough to provide sufficient buoyancy at a more economical price than
pure helium.

The helium though diffuses through the latex balloon at a higher rate
than the other gases, for whatever reason, and that's why a day-old
balloon with half the original gas volume has so much less buoyancy than
a half filled new balloon with fresh gas.

Dear William,

Nitrogen from a tank is 100% N2, diffusing through rubber at a rate of
about 10.

Air from a tire pump is 80% N2, with 20% O2 diffusing at a rate of
about 23.

So the relative deflation rates would be 10 versus 12.6, hard to
distinguish over a week or two.

CO2, however, diffuses through rubber at a rate of about 150, which
makes it easy to notice that cartridge-inflated tires go flat quickly.

As for metallic sealing, that's why more expensive children's balloons
have the shiny metal foil--even that thin metal coating keeps them
inflated much longer.

Cheers,

Carl Fogel

I think I hear not right!  Where did you see helium mentioned in what
I wrote.  Maybe the modern child never inflated a balloon my blowing
into it.  That's too bad.  Breath inflated balloons go flat much
faster than a bicycle tire and from a far lower pressure.

Lets not get permeability, solubility, diffusion and partial pressures
of gas molecules into this.  Thin rubber membranes are not gas proof.

&gt;&gt; Just a quibble, but the solubility of the gas in the rubber inner tube

&gt;&gt;  I'm seeing terms like solubility, permeability and diffusion and I'm
&gt;&gt; not sure what they all mean. But Michael Press stated that he saw no
&gt;&gt; difference between N2 and air in his experiment. At least that's a
&gt;&gt; practical test from his experience.
&gt;&gt; The real problem may be finding tubes that have no tiny leaks, only
&gt;&gt; &quot;normal&quot;  permeability, Then test with air and then with N2 and as Tom
&gt;&gt; Sherman jokingly suggested, Helium. And of course no one has mentioned
&gt;&gt; what effect temperature has on permeability(solubility, diffusion?) of
&gt;&gt; inner tubes. And don't dare to actually ride with these test tubes which
&gt;&gt; will screw up the test with potential leaks!
&gt;&gt; Did some one mention Hydrogen? A rubber bladder with some type of
&gt;&gt; metallic sealant coating ALMOST worked for the

&gt;&gt; Bill

&gt; Dear William,

&gt; Nitrogen from a tank is 100% N2, diffusing through rubber at a rate of
&gt; about 10.

&gt; Air from a tire pump is 80% N2, with 20% O2 diffusing at a rate of
&gt; about 23.

&gt; So the relative deflation rates would be 10 versus 12.6, hard to
&gt; distinguish over a week or two.

&gt; CO2, however, diffuses through rubber at a rate of about 150, which
&gt; makes it easy to notice that cartridge-inflated tires go flat quickly.

&gt; As for metallic sealing, that's why more expensive children's balloons
&gt; have the shiny metal foil--even that thin metal coating keeps them
&gt; inflated much longer.

Not to laugh, filling a tire with water works well and isn't as hard
as you think.  The only problem is that the tire is heavier.  If you
have a slow leak and nothing with which to fix it on the road, fill
the tire with water.  I've done it and it works like a charm.  Of
course you have to have a good frame fit pump (long stroke Silca) that
can be filled with water.  Make sure to let out all remaining air so
the water doesn't slosh around.

Although if it does slosh around you have the basis of a dynamical

Dear Leo,

It's the _relative_ ratio of ordinary to light wheels that makes the
difference in acceleration trivial (plus where the mass sits, meaning
close to the axle or out at the rim).

Obviously, a pair of lead wheels weighing 50 pounds would be hard to
spin up--and hard to slow down.

Given a theoretical pair of 210 cm wheels with 2.54 cm of space
inside, we have a volume of about 2 * 210 * ((2.54/2)^2 * 3.141 )cm^3
of water, or 2,128 cc's of water, about 2.2 kg, all out at the rim and
in addition to the air-inflated weight of the same wheelset.

In other words, you'd be adding a full 32 ounce water bottle to each
wheel. This 2,178 grams is about ten times the usual 200 gram savings
gained from lighter tires and rims, so it's about ten times as
noticeable--which is still not much, given that it's only about 2% of
a 100 kg rider and bicycle.

A real-world coasting test that tries to distinguish 2~4% differences
is unlikely to come up with clear answers, particularly since the
rolling resistance of the water-filled tires is likely to be
considerably larger than the air-filled tires.

Compressed air is an almost perfect spring, so the tire drag for an
inflated tire is mostly from the hysteresis of the sidewalls and
tread, which fail to spring back with the same force that they're
deformed.

A rubber inner-tube filled with water, on the other hand, is going to
be squishing a lot of water around as it rolls, and the mass of the
water will be swirling uselessly, so there will be more drag.

You can go back to the thread a few years ago where I tested the
spin-down times for a rear tire with and without a few ounces of
slime:

http://groups.google.com/group/rec.bicycles.tech/browse_frm/thread/c9...

Here's the graph of the time to spin down from the same speeds for the
tire with an air-tube, with a few ounces of slime in the tube, and
with a little extra weight on an air-tube to see the differences:

http://home.comcast.net/~carlfogel/download/slime.jpg

The heavier tube-and-tire combinations both took longer to spin down,
proving that Newton was on to something.

The slime tube and the air-tube with 80 grams of weight added may not
have been exactly the same weight, so it's unwise to draw any
conclusions except that they were pretty close.

The interesting thing was that the times for the slime-filled tube
varied less over the 20 tests than the times for the air-filled tubes.

That test, of course, had no tire-drag factor, unlike a coasting
contest. The tires just spun down against the wind drag of the spokes,
descending to a starting speed and then on down to a low cut-off
speed.

As I recall, I couldn't tell the difference between any of the tires
when cranking the rear wheel up to over 30 mph with one hand.

Cheers,

Carl Fogel

The only advantage accrued by inflating tires with N2 is
to racing cars where the pure gas has more predictable

than the variable mix emitted by an atmospheric air compressor.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; What is called for is the molecular mass not atomic mass.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; MM is what governs the diffusion rate.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; He   4.003
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Ne  20.18
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Ar  39.95
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Kr  83.80
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Xe  131.3
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Ra  226

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (Do not worry about the decimal places.)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Molecular mass of H2 is 2.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; This gives He a diffusion rate 0.7 times
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that of H2.
&gt; &gt;&gt; yeahbut, the molecular size of H2 is much larger than the atomic size of
&gt; &gt;&gt; He.  that also affects diffusion rate.

&gt; &gt; How big is the H2 molecule,

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#Molecular_size

&gt; &gt; and how big is the He atom?

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium
">

So, how big are they?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am surprised that no one has offered helium tire inflation to the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Some pro/national track teams use helium in their tubulars, but the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very small molecule (actually just an atom) combined with latex
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tubes means pressure loss is too fast to make this practical for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; road bikes used for several hours at a time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It has been alleged that the GB track team use much cheaper
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nitrogen, but paint their nitrogen cylinders to make other teams
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think they're using helium.

what's the problem michael?  wikipedia/google/the world's library of
chem text books not working for you?  or do you have some other agenda?
if the latter, quit fucking about and say what's on your mind.

The two times I had to do this, I cannot say I noticed any difference
in drag.  Or otherwise.  This was on the Moulton, which has full
suspension, so that would have masked some of the effects.
