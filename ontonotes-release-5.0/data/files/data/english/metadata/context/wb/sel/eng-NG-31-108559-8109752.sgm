Some evaporation sources need lots of current, but
have modest voltage requirements, for example
needing 400 amps, but dropping less than a volt.

I imagine one good way to get a high ac current
would be to pass a big fat wire through the center
hole of a toroidal 50 / 60Hz power transformer.

For example, AnTek makes nice low-cost toroidal
transformers, http://toroid-transformer.com/
which they sell directly or via eBay and PayPal.
http://stores.ebay.com/Antek-inc

These transformers have plenty of room inside their
center hole (1.5&quot;) to pass even several turns of big
wire, etc.

I purchased a 1kVA part, p/n AN-10265, for $100.
Using a one-turn secondary to measure the turns
ratio, I found 225 primary turns.  This means we'll
get up to 530mV with a one secondary turn, 1.06V
with two turns, or 1.6V with three turns, and we
can draw up to 1875, 938 or 625A respectively.

The question then becomes, what's the best way
to control the total output current, to obtain a
precise oven temperature.

The primary current is 1/225th of 400A or &lt;2A, doesn't seem like much of
an issue there. That's easily off-the-shelf SSR territory. I wouldn't
think an evaporator would require all that much precision of fast response.

If there's enough thermal mass maybe you can time proportion with a
cycle of a few seconds (of course you can do better than simple time
proportioning especially around the likely operating point of
~30-70%), but more likely you're looking at SCR phase control. The
time proportioning has the control advantage of power linearity. With
trigger angle you have two nonlinearities to contend with.

Win,
One precaution is that your (leakage) inductance of your secondary
circuit doesn't have to be much to limit your current. 1volt/400 amps
=2.5 mohm, so for 2.5 mohm of inductive reactance at 60 Hz you only need
about 6 microhenries to cut your current by .7. A little care with
lengths and conductor separation might be necessary.

Use a bunch of wires not just one.  This way you can spread them
around the core.

You may be able to do it on an E core using many wires too.

Do you need proportional control or would a band-bang control be good
enough?

The primary side current will be low enough that SSRs and triacs etc
can be used.
A triac would need a good snubber circuit.  You could add a little
leakage inductance to the system on purpose to make the current
waveform not have the sharp edge.  A sharp 400A current change will
almost certainly couple into however you are measuring the
temperature.

If you look around the net there are lots of people
cutting the secondaries off of microwave oven transformers
(&quot;MOTs&quot;) and rewinding the secondary for low voltage,
high current operation.  People have used everything from
welding ground wire (fat, but flexible) to flattened copper
pipe.

For welding people use solid state relays (on the primary,
obviously) with builtin settable one-shot timers.

Most of those designs also put the transformer VERY close
to the load because the IR loss is terrible.

I had numerous 2kw  toroids available and for a test set, a single,
30cm piece of 10mm^2 cable, looped through a toroid centre hole
happily gave 150Amps~ from a 0.8V~ source. Didn't need control but
this would most definitely have been by triac on the primary and by
continuous phase angle control.
Practical drawback with the big toroids is the tendency to huge inrush
currents, dependant on core magnetism from  the point in the mains
cycle where they were last switched off.
Even in my uncontrolled on/off setup I added a 'softstart' resistor
and relay, to avoid blowing fuses etc.

I once paper designed, but never built, a power controller
based on alternating half cycle control.  Every half cycle
of voltage is followed by the opposite half cycle of
voltage, with a variable, but even number, of missing half
cycles in between, with a solid state relay as the final
control element.  I think this is the smoothest variable
power output you can produce without chopping off chunks of
individual half cycles. that produces a very low DC voltage
component across the transformer.

The design I made originally, used discrete 4000 series
logic, but now that I use PICs, it could be made much simpler.

PWM the primary?

I did a little goofing around with high current, low voltage sources
many years ago*. I tried the single turn through a transformer core, but
it didn't work very well. I suspect the reason was that the single turn
suffered from high leakage inductance due to its not filling the opening
left behind by the removed secondary. The final, successful solution was
to modify a heavy duty soldering gun, which is essentially an N:1 turn
transformer.

*The project was to build a portable, easy to use current source that
power company linemen could use to verify the proper operation of some
clamp-on fault current sensors in the field. I had to generate 400A for
a fraction of a second and a soldering gun with a copper loop in place
of the tip did so quite easily.

One of those Omega 1/4 DIN (or whatever) temp controllers should work.

maybe you could control it with magnetics
either mechanically like with the old type welding transformers wich moved a

or saturate the shunt with a dc current,

&gt;&gt;&gt; have modest voltage requirements, for example
&gt;&gt;&gt; needing 400 amps, but dropping less than a volt.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I imagine one good way to get a high ac current
&gt;&gt;&gt; would be to pass a big fat wire through the center
&gt;&gt;&gt; hole of a toroidal 50 / 60Hz power transformer.

&gt;&gt;&gt; For example, AnTek makes nice low-cost toroidal
&gt;&gt;&gt; transformers, http://toroid-transformer.com/
&gt;&gt;&gt; which they sell directly or via eBay and PayPal.
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://stores.ebay.com/Antek-inc

&gt;&gt;&gt; These transformers have plenty of room inside their
&gt;&gt;&gt; center hole (1.5&quot;) to pass even several turns of big
&gt;&gt;&gt; wire, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I purchased a 1kVA part, p/n AN-10265, for $100.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Using a one-turn secondary to measure the turns
&gt;&gt;&gt; ratio, I found 225 primary turns.  This means we'll
&gt;&gt;&gt; get up to 530mV with a one secondary turn, 1.06V
&gt;&gt;&gt; with two turns, or 1.6V with three turns, and we
&gt;&gt;&gt; can draw up to 1875, 938 or 625A respectively.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The question then becomes, what's the best way
&gt;&gt;&gt; to control the total output current, to obtain a
&gt;&gt;&gt; precise oven temperature.

&gt;&gt;maybe you could control it with magnetics
&gt;&gt;either mechanically like with the old type welding transformers wich moved
&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;magnetic shunt
&gt;&gt;or saturate the shunt with a dc current,
&gt;&gt;maybe even a welder might do the job anyway.

&gt; Get him to turn the knob on a variac?

&gt;&gt;Colin =^.^=
">

Well I assume he'd get one of his students to do it.

a variac wouldnt give enough step down so youd need a transformer as well,
unless you conected the input to the tap and had 1 turn as a secondary,
thay are basically a toroidal transformer so wouldnt be to hard todo,

ofc you would need say 110v into a 240v variac and make sure you didnt turn
it to less than 50%.
that would give you a range of 50-100% maybe thats enough to control it ?

puting the thick wire for the secondary through would probably limit the
movement to 50% anyway.

I was thinking more along the lines of those magnetic cores with a large
amount of hystersys that used to be used for controlling switch mode
secondary outputs, but realised they probably only practical with dc.

&gt; The primary current is 1/225th of 400A or &lt;2A, doesn't
&gt; seem like much of an issue there. That's easily off-

I'm concerned with transformer core saturation.
Perhaps if I use the 220V primary windings, with
an SSR-phase-controlled 120V ac input.  DigiKey
offers one for $64, but doesn't have any in stock.
http://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Crydom%20PDFs/CPV%20Series...
But phase-control isn't too hard to design and make.

So, this would mean a 450:1 turns ratio, and 215mV
with one secondary turn, 530mV for two turns, 745mV
for three turns, and 1.06V for four turns.  We can
draw up to 3750, 1875, 1250, or 938A, respectively,
on the secondary.

Hmm, the 400 or 700-VA xfmrs should work fine.

I don't see why you are worried about core saturation.  With the
transformer loaded with a heavy load, the core will be a bit less
likely to saturate because of the IR losses.  If you are switching the
current on, you should be able to control when it switches and do so
at the peak of the waveform.  With the phase control, you can always
start at the late timing and move towards more on time slowly enough
to ensure no saturation.

The run from the transformer to the load will be a bit of an issue.
You need to keep its impedance near zero.  I assume this run will be
kept as short as you can.

As I suggested elsewhere, I worry a bit about the sharp edged current
step causing trouble in other parts of the system.

If the scr/triac conduction isn't perfectly symmetric, you can wind up

He does have a hefty load on this transformer.  The SCR isn't likely
to have the problem of there not being enough current to hold it on
just after it is triggered.  He will have to put an RC snubber on the
SCR to keep the dv/dt within reason.  The resistance of the snubber
will also be passing current just after the SCR fires.

This is assuming there is not mains ripple getting into the triggering
circuit.  It only ensures that it is as symmetrical as the triggering
is.  A triac running from that same trigger signal would be about as
good.

We could put a large capacitor in series to ensure no DC component.
It leads to some fun waveforms and interesting shopping trips at these
current levels, however.

I think that is a somewhat silly idea so lets do it  :)

We know that the current stops when the SCR is off.  We can use a
current transformer and restore the zero when the current stops.  I
assume we are tripping the SCR with a tranformer so we can have the
whole circuit isolated from the mains.

The current sense transformer would drive a circuit like this:

-----/\/\---------
(                  !
(                  !
(                  !
!         --/\/\---+
-GND    !         !
!         !
---/\/\-+-!-\     !   C1
(          !  &gt;----+---!!--+---!+\       To DC servo
(      GND-!+/             !   !  &gt;--+---
(                          /  -!-/   !
---GND                SW1 O  !      !
!   ------
GND

The first opamp lets us use a cheap design for the current transformer
and get a big enough signal to drive C1.

C1 is snapped to ground by SW1 when the SCR is off to reset the zero.

Just take two transformers and wire the primaries in series and the
secondaries in series bucking as the control.  It worked fine some 40
years ago to control a light bulb so a bigger one should control a
heater quite nicely.  DC in the secondaries makes the cores
saturate.

If you want to be a purist about it, you need to place a large
capacitor across the control winding.  When you feed DC into the
control some AC currents flow in the control windings.  The capacitor
keeps this out of the control circuit.

I'd appreciate a response on this.  The saturable reactor is
appealing to me because it's a linear way of dealing with an
ac-transformer power-control problem.  One thing that slows
me down is considering the two transformers needed to create
a saturable reactor - how big do they need to be?  Thinking
about this, with no DC current, they create an open circuit,
no current flows and no power is dissipated.  Alternately,
with maximum DC current the two transformers are saturated,
and simplified, look together like a length of copper wire.
So the intermediate condition provides the greatest stress.
That should be the region to evaluate.

Another issue, how much power will be involved generating
the DC-current to control say 1.0kVA?  Will it be a similar
amount, say 500W dc?  Ahem.

I was interested in Ken's idea, so sketched a

Each transformer's primary winding has to be able to
take the final max load current. So if you had a
230V/2500VA load then you would possibly use a pair of
115V/1250VA transformers.

I suspect that if the transformers were designed for
this application then they would be smaller because
more window area could be allotted to the AC side.

As a first pass, the load current, Iload = Vin/Z.

Where Z^2 = (w.(2Lp + Lleak))^2 + (2Rpri + Rload)^2.

The effective '2Lp' is the variable that is controlled
by the DC current, by varying the incremental permeability.
DC control will probably be non-linear, more or less
following the shape of the B-H loop.

I suspect that the control power will be far less than
the normal rated output power of the secondaries.

The B-H loop will show what DC field strength is required
to push the flux density into saturation. An old graph
that I have shows that a sample of 0.014&quot; Silicon Steel
required a polarising field strength of about 5 Oersteds
to reduce the incremental permeability from over 2000 to
about 100.

Polarising field strength, H = 4.pi.N.I/10.le Oersteds.

So the required N.I can be estimated.  It would seem
useful to buy unpotted toroidal transformers so that
a few turns can be wound on, to get some idea of the
turns/volt the secondaries were wound at.

A nice bit of work, there, Tony!

For quick estimates, could we guess that the DC current
would be 3 to 5 times higher than the peak AC current at
the VA rating of transformer?  Given that the DC winding
resistance of the transformers is quite low, the DC-
control requirement doesn't look too bad.  A fair amount
of DC control current, sure, but not too much voltage...

I don't think it is even as high as that Win.

If you were to leave the Pri open circuit, connect a
voltage source to the Sec, and turn it up until the
current waveform had nice wide flat tops then the
measured Ipeak could be a reasonable estimate of the
polarising DC amps needed to saturate the core.

3 to 5 times the secondary magnetising current peak
is probably much lower than 3 to 5 times the peak
secondary load current.

The control power would then be the DC amps times
the winding resistances.... but see below on what
could buggerate that low control power.

There could be a little ambush in the two-transformer
saturable reactor.  Those two series'd secondaries
may not cancel completely, so there could be a
residual AC voltage at their terminals.  I suspect
that the DC current source must have a high enough
compliance/supply voltage such that no AC current
flows in the secondaries.

The same (or worse) AC current flow could occur
with the circulating currents that would arise
from the paralleled windings in your previous post.

This is getting interesting.......

Oh bum! Wrong way round.

Drive the Sec from a resistive source until the

This depends on how you define &quot;linear&quot;.  The cores of the two
transformers don't start to saturate at low currents.

As you increase the control current the saturation starts to happen
near the end of each alternation.  The transformer in which the AC and
the control adds, saturates first.  An AC current flows in the control
winding coupling the low impedance of the saturated one over onto the
unsaturated one.  This is why I suggested a capacitor across the
windings.

As you increase the control current, the saturation point moves
towards the peak of th ewave form.  This means that the control gain
is still increasing in the early part of the range.

Once you pass the peak, the gain of the control signal starts to
decrease.  When you get to the point where the core is saturated with
no AC, the circuit is nearly fully one and the gain is very low.  As
you go above this point, you start to saturate the core that the AC is
bucking in.  This takes the leakage inductance out of the picture.

The transformers will have the I^2 * R losses due to the current.  For
this reason, I don't think you could go with a much smaller
transformer.

It would be only several times the no load current of the xformer.
The core is sized so that it doesn't saturate in the no load case.
The current for the full load case doesn't represent an increase in
the field in the core.

&gt; &gt;  For quick estimates, could we guess that the DC current
&gt; &gt;  would be 3 to 5 times higher than the peak AC current at
&gt; &gt;  the VA rating of transformer?

&gt;  I don't think it is even as high as that Win.

&gt;  If you were to leave the Pri open circuit, connect a
&gt;  voltage source to the Sec, and turn it up until the
&gt;  current waveform had nice wide flat tops then the
&gt;  measured Ipeak could be a reasonable estimate of the
&gt;  polarising DC amps needed to saturate the core.

&gt;  3 to 5 times the secondary magnetising current peak
&gt;  is probably much lower than 3 to 5 times the peak
&gt;  secondary load current.

&gt;  The control power would then be the DC amps times
&gt;  the winding resistances.... but see below on what
&gt;  could buggerate that low control power.

&gt; &gt; Given that the DC winding resistance of the transformers is quite
&gt; &gt; low, the DC- control requirement doesn't look too bad.  A fair
&gt; &gt; amount of DC control current, sure, but not too much voltage...

&gt;  There could be a little ambush in the two-transformer
&gt;  saturable reactor.  Those two series'd secondaries
&gt;  may not cancel completely, so there could be a
&gt;  residual AC voltage at their terminals.  I suspect
&gt;  that the DC current source must have a high enough
&gt;  compliance/supply voltage such that no AC current
&gt;  flows in the secondaries.
">

When they are not saturated, and if they came from a good maker, the
match should be more than good enough to keep this current quite
small.  When you start to saturate, you want a capacitor between the
windings to pass the AC that develops because one core saturates when
the other doesn't.

Interesting.  I'd have thought the opposite--for normal transformer use,
the core needs to avoid saturating on the current peaks, so to fully
saturate the core, the dc secondary current will need to be more than
the peak value in normal AC use, plus whatever safety factor was
designed into the transformer.

And Glen's point about the DC is important--Win's parallel arrangement
can be made to conduct heavily on both half cycles, but the series
arrangement can't.  It's just like a full wave centre tapped rectifier.

I breadboarded it and the control current turns out

secondary magnetising current peak at normal sec
voltage.  Idcmax is practically equal to the normal
sec full load AC current.

However there is actually a good case for designing
for a controlled Vout that only goes up to about
90% of Vin..... that last 10% requires almost double
the control power.  See below.

It needed 7.2W of control power for 80VA out (218Vrms
