We Were Right About Joe Lieberman

By Cenk Uygur
Created Jan 14 2007 - 9:12am

We we right. The people of Connecticut should have never trusted Joe
Lieberman. One third of Democratic voters in Connecticut voted for Lieberman
in the general election against Ned Lamont. And they screwed the whole
country.

We could have had a real Democrat in that seat. Or at least someone who
isn't madly in love with George Bush. I wish Joe knew how to quit him.

First, Senator Lieberman who pretended to be a concerned moderate on Iraq
during the election, and then immediately showed how extreme he is right
after the election. There was no more talk about finding the best possible
way out of Iraq. Instead, Lieberman immediately embraced escalation.

How many Democratic votes do you think Lieberman would have gotten in
Connecticut if he had been honest and told the voters that he planned to
support an escalation of the Iraq War as soon as he was elected? Not very
many. That's why he had to lie, like he always does.

If you think that's too harsh, you haven't seen the latest news. During the
2006 election, Lieberman promised to hold hearings on how the Bush
administration handled Hurricane Katrina if he was elected. He would be the
head of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. He
would be the one that would make the decision on what hearings to hold and
what documents to demand from the White House. He promised he would hold
them accountable.

Of course, as always he was lying. Instead, he has just announced that he
will hold no such hearings [1] and that he will ask for none of the
documents that could show how the administration mishandled the crisis.
Heaven forbid that he should do his job.

Any other Democrat in that position would naturally take this topic up. If
we don't know what went wrong, we can't fix it for next time. But I guess
Lieberman doesn't care. He doesn't care what happened to the people of New
Orleans. He doesn't care to find out what went wrong and how it can be
addressed. And he doesn't care if we make the same exact mistakes the next
time.

I don't get his motivation on this. We always knew he was lying about Iraq.
His pride would never allow him to support a withdrawal. Besides, he is a
true neoconservative in foreign policy. There is not one senator who is to
the right of Lieberman on foreign policy. He even makes Sam Brownback look
like a liberal [2] when it comes to warmongering.

But why screw the people of New Orleans? Is it because he is a pathological
liar, so if he said he would do the right thing, he is forced by his
condition to do the opposite? Is it because he has such a man-crush on
George Bush that he can't countenance having him hurt in any way? Does he
have some financial or political gain in keeping things covered up?

It doesn't make any sense. My best guess is that he is trying to protect the
administration so that they can be as politically healthy as possible in
order to carry out their plan for escalating the Iraq War. They are going to
need all the political capital they can get. So, Lieberman is protecting
them.

It could also be that he is trying to goad the Democrats into taking his
chairmanship away, thereby giving him an excuse to switch parties. If he
switched over to the Republican side, that would hand the Senate right back
to the Republicans. [3] And also add tremendously to their political
capital -- which they would expend on Iraq.

I despise Joe Lieberman. I loathe him with the power of a thousand white hot
suns. We knew he was going to do something like this. We knew he didn't give
a damn about the Democratic Party. We knew all he cared about was making
sure we escalated the Iraq War and never withdrew. And we knew he was lying
to everyone in Connecticut to preserve his own power.

This man claims to be a moral standard-bearer and then deceives the very
people that trusted him to protect their interests. As usual with these
religious hypocrites, he doesn't have any morals at all. The only thing that
matters to Joe Lieberman is Joe Lieberman. And oh yeah, screwing up Iraq as
much as humanly possible.

There is no excuse for giving the Bush administration a pass on Hurricane
Katrina. None. The people of Connecticut trusted him to do what he said he'd
do. This is a gross violation of that trust.

We were right, and now it is patently obvious who Joe Lieberman really is.
These are his last six years in the Senate, so he better enjoy it while it
lasts. He isn't the senator from Nebraska (actually the Republican senator
from that state is a thousand times more reasonable than Lieberman on
foreign policy). He is the senator from one of the bluest states in the
country, Connecticut. Well, at least he was.

I agree.  If I was a Democratic senator I couldn't bear to be in the same
room as him.  Nonetheless, for the next two years he has the Democrats by
the throat, because if he switches to Republican, there goes the Senate.

If I was Harry Reid I'd be trying to convince Susan Collins to switch
parties.

In any case, let's work for the Democrats to increase their majority in
2008.  Once Lieberman's vote is no longer needed, he should be stripped of
his seniority and chairmanships and shown the exit.

Of course support for Israel is a good thing.  They're the only democracy in

anything to do with Israel, except in the minds of antisemites like Fig the

Double talk from the master of babble. Support for Israel is GOOD but support
for expanding the war is BAD! That's a good one! Just who was the war designed
for in the first place? Who is the ultimate benefactor? For whom did the Zionist
neocons in Bush's administration labor night and day to serve? Who works
ceaselessly to promote another war with which to grind`America's face in the
dirt while we pour out our blood and resources for their advantage?  Who indeed!

One day, perhaps, the schizophrenic Kimmel will decide just which one of his
faces is the real one, the Israeli or the American, but I wouldn't count on it.

Fig the Bigot pretends that Bush's war in Iraq for the oil companies is

still he denies his obvious obsession with Jews.

Bush's war against Iraq was about oil and American hegemony in the Middle
East, not Israel.   You can whine about the Jews from now until Shavuot, and
it won't change the facts.  There's a reason you're known as Fig the Bigot.

Total, absolute Kimmel bullshit. The war was for Israel; the oil was the carrot
at the end of the stick. A review of what the leading Zionist neocons had to say
about the war might even penetrate Kimmel's concrete skull.

Zionist Jonah Goldberg:
“Every ten years or so, the United States needs to pick up some small crappy
little country and throw it against the wall, just to show we mean business.”

Zionist Michael Ledeen:
" First and foremost, we must bring down the terror regimes, beginning with the
Big Three: Iran, Iraq, and Syria. And then we have to come to grips with Saudi
Arabia. … Once the tyrants in Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Saudi Arabia have been
brought down, we will remain engaged. …We have to ensure the fulfillment of the
democratic revolution. … Stability is an unworthy American mission, and a
misleading concept to boot. We do not want stability in Iran, Iraq, Syria,
Lebanon, and even Saudi Arabia; we want things to change. The real issue is not
whether, but how to destabilize. Creative destruction is our middle name, both
within our society and abroad. We tear down the old order every day, from
business to science, literature, art, architecture, and cinema to politics and
the law. Our enemies have always hated this whirlwind of energy and creativity
which menaces their traditions (whatever they may be) and shames them for their
inability to keep pace. … [W]e must destroy them to advance our historic
mission."

Zionists Feith, Wurmser, and Perle in their notorious white paper outlining
Israel's road to mid East control, "A Clean break: A New Strategy for Securing
the Realm":
"Israel can shape its strategic environment, in cooperation with Turkey and
Jordan, by weakening, containing, and even rolling back Syria. This effort can
focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq—an important Israeli
strategic objective in its own right—as a means of foiling Syria’s regional
ambitions."

As Pat Buchanan so aptly wrapped it up (Yes, THAT Pat Buchanan. Deal with it):

"We charge that a cabal of polemicists and public officials seek to ensnare our
country in a series of wars that are not in America’s interests. We charge them
with colluding with Israel to ignite those wars and destroy the Oslo Accords. We
charge them with deliberately damaging U.S. relations with every state in the
Arab world that defies Israel or supports the Palestinian people’s right to a
homeland of their own. We charge that they have alienated friends and allies all
over the Islamic and Western world through their arrogance, hubris, and
bellicosity.

Not in our lifetimes has America been so isolated from old friends. Far worse,
President Bush is being lured into a trap baited for him by these neocons that
could cost him his office and cause America to forfeit years of peace won for us
by the sacrifices of two generations in the Cold War.

They charge us with anti-Semitism—i.e., a hatred of Jews for their faith,
heritage, or ancestry. False. The truth is, those hurling these charges harbor a
“passionate attachment” to a nation not our own that causes them to subordinate
the interests of their own country and to act on an assumption that, somehow,
what’s good for Israel is good for America."

Oil? That was the prize. The box it came in was made in Israel.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; We Were Right About Joe Lieberman

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; By Cenk Uygur
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Created Jan 14 2007 - 9:12am

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I despise Joe Lieberman. I loathe him with the power of a
thousand
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;white
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;hot
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; suns. We knew he was going to do something like this. We knew he
&gt; &gt;didn't
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;give
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a damn about the Democratic Party. We knew all he cared about was
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;making
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sure we escalated the Iraq War and never withdrew. And we knew he
&gt; &gt;was
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;lying
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to everyone in Connecticut to preserve his own power.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I agree.  If I was a Democratic senator I couldn't bear to be in
the
&gt; &gt;same
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;room as him.  Nonetheless, for the next two years he has the
Democrats
&gt; &gt;by
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the throat, because if he switches to Republican, there goes the
&gt; &gt;Senate.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If I was Harry Reid I'd be trying to convince Susan Collins to
switch
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;parties.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;In any case, let's work for the Democrats to increase their
majority
&gt; &gt;in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;2008.  Once Lieberman's vote is no longer needed, he should be
&gt; &gt;stripped
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;his seniority and chairmanships and shown the exit.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Uh huh.  Then you don't approve of Joe's undying support of Israel
and
&gt; &gt;its
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;plans
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to involve us in an Iran-Syria war? Or his support for an Iraq
surge?
&gt; &gt;Is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; what you're saying?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Fig the Bigot oozes in and tries to pretend that this is a &quot;Jewish&quot;
&gt; &gt;issue.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Of course support for Israel is a good thing.  They're the only
democracy
&gt; &gt;in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the Middle East, and a loyal friend of America.  And of course support
&gt; &gt;for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Bush's desire to expand his Iraq war is a bad thing, not that that has
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;anything to do with Israel, except in the minds of antisemites like
Fig
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Bigot.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Double talk from the master of babble. Support for Israel is GOOD but
&gt; &gt;support
&gt; &gt;&gt; for expanding the war is BAD! That's a good one! Just who was the war
&gt; &gt;designed
&gt; &gt;&gt; for in the first place? Who is the ultimate benefactor? For whom did
the
&gt; &gt;Zionist
&gt; &gt;&gt; neocons in Bush's administration labor night and day to serve? Who
works
&gt; &gt;&gt; ceaselessly to promote another war with which to grind`America's face
in
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;&gt; dirt while we pour out our blood and resources for their advantage?
Who
&gt; &gt;indeed!

&gt; &gt;&gt; One day, perhaps, the schizophrenic Kimmel will decide just which one
of
&gt; &gt;his
&gt; &gt;&gt; faces is the real one, the Israeli or the American, but I wouldn't
count
&gt; &gt;on it.

&gt; &gt;Fig the Bigot pretends that Bush's war in Iraq for the oil companies is
&gt; &gt;really a secret Israeli plot.  His obsession is obvious to everyone and
&gt; &gt;still he denies his obvious obsession with Jews.

&gt; &gt;Bush's war against Iraq was about oil and American hegemony in the Middle
&gt; &gt;East, not Israel.   You can whine about the Jews from now until Shavuot,
and
&gt; &gt;it won't change the facts.  There's a reason you're known as Fig the
Bigot.

&gt; Total, absolute Kimmel bullshit. The war was for Israel; the oil was the
carrot
&gt; at the end of the stick. A review of what the leading Zionist neocons had
to say
&gt; about the war might even penetrate Kimmel's concrete skull.
">

Fig the Bigot demonstrates he's obsessed with Jews and his hatred of Israel.
One can support Israel and oppose Bush and Lieberman.  Fig can't understand
this because he's consumed by his Jew hatred.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;it won't change the facts.  There's a reason you're known as Fig the
&gt; &gt;Bigot.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Total, absolute Kimmel bullshit. The war was for Israel; the oil was
the
&gt; &gt;carrot
&gt; &gt;&gt; at the end of the stick. A review of what the leading Zionist neocons
had
&gt; &gt;to say
&gt; &gt;&gt; about the war might even penetrate Kimmel's concrete skull.

&gt; Where's the rest of my post, Shmuck? Don't want too many here to read it?

&gt; &gt;Fig the Bigot demonstrates he's obsessed with Jews and his hatred of
Israel.
&gt; &gt;One can support Israel and oppose Bush and Lieberman.  Fig can't
understand
&gt; &gt;this because he's consumed by his Jew hatred.

&gt; Hey, Mordacpreventor, your baby needs changing...he shit himself again!

Fig the Bigot demonstrates that he has nothing to offer but his hatred of
Jews.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; We Were Right About Joe Lieberman

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; By Cenk Uygur
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Created Jan 14 2007 - 9:12am

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I despise Joe Lieberman. I loathe him with the power of a
&gt;&gt; &gt;thousand
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;white
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;hot
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; suns. We knew he was going to do something like this. We knew
&gt;he
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;didn't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;give
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a damn about the Democratic Party. We knew all he cared about
&gt;was
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;making
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sure we escalated the Iraq War and never withdrew. And we knew
&gt;he
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;was
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;lying
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to everyone in Connecticut to preserve his own power.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I agree.  If I was a Democratic senator I couldn't bear to be in
&gt;&gt; &gt;the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;same
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;room as him.  Nonetheless, for the next two years he has the
&gt;&gt; &gt;Democrats
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;by
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the throat, because if he switches to Republican, there goes the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Senate.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If I was Harry Reid I'd be trying to convince Susan Collins to
&gt;&gt; &gt;switch
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;parties.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;In any case, let's work for the Democrats to increase their
&gt;&gt; &gt;majority
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;2008.  Once Lieberman's vote is no longer needed, he should be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;stripped
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;his seniority and chairmanships and shown the exit.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Uh huh.  Then you don't approve of Joe's undying support of
&gt;Israel
&gt;&gt; &gt;and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;its
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;plans
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to involve us in an Iran-Syria war? Or his support for an Iraq
&gt;&gt; &gt;surge?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; what you're saying?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Fig the Bigot oozes in and tries to pretend that this is a &quot;Jewish&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;issue.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Of course support for Israel is a good thing.  They're the only
&gt;&gt; &gt;democracy
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the Middle East, and a loyal friend of America.  And of course
&gt;support
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Bush's desire to expand his Iraq war is a bad thing, not that that
&gt;has
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;anything to do with Israel, except in the minds of antisemites like
&gt;&gt; &gt;Fig
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Bigot.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Double talk from the master of babble. Support for Israel is GOOD
&gt;but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;support
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for expanding the war is BAD! That's a good one! Just who was the
&gt;war
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;designed
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for in the first place? Who is the ultimate benefactor? For whom did
&gt;&gt; &gt;the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Zionist
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; neocons in Bush's administration labor night and day to serve? Who
&gt;&gt; &gt;works
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ceaselessly to promote another war with which to grind`America's
&gt;face
&gt;&gt; &gt;in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; dirt while we pour out our blood and resources for their advantage?
&gt;&gt; &gt;Who
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;indeed!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One day, perhaps, the schizophrenic Kimmel will decide just which
&gt;one
&gt;&gt; &gt;of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;his
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; faces is the real one, the Israeli or the American, but I wouldn't
&gt;&gt; &gt;count
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;on it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Fig the Bigot pretends that Bush's war in Iraq for the oil companies
&gt;is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;really a secret Israeli plot.  His obsession is obvious to everyone
&gt;and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;still he denies his obvious obsession with Jews.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Bush's war against Iraq was about oil and American hegemony in the
&gt;Middle
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;East, not Israel.   You can whine about the Jews from now until
&gt;Shavuot,
&gt;&gt; &gt;and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;it won't change the facts.  There's a reason you're known as Fig the
&gt;&gt; &gt;Bigot.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Total, absolute Kimmel bullshit. The war was for Israel; the oil was
&gt;the
&gt;&gt; &gt;carrot
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; at the end of the stick. A review of what the leading Zionist neocons
&gt;had
&gt;&gt; &gt;to say
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about the war might even penetrate Kimmel's concrete skull.

Nothing to offer? I keep handing you the opportunity to regurgitate your AIPAC

Fig the Bigot finally admits he acts "just like an idiot."  I suppose that's
something.
