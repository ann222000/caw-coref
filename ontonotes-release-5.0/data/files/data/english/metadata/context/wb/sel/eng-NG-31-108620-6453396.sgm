Yeah, I agree with his statement. But, his wording for the Name of the
flight could have been a little more clear, Development Flight 2. But, then
again DemoFlight just shows his optimistic view point.

It will be interesting to see if they make the next flight DemoFlight 3 and
not carry a satellite on that flight as well.  It would seem to be the
prudent thing to do considering that no demo flight to date has made it to
orbit.

Or, carry his own payload, something like a boiler plate Dragon, a Mercury
sized one person capsule to test out Dragon parts. I'd start with the abort
system, because it would have been exercised twice by now. Parachute
recovery system, twice by now. Heatshield, once by now. No attitude
thrusters, life support, ... required yet for a stable Dragon (simulated
RCS failure after deorbit burn), Falcon could do the deorbit, if they get
successfully to Orbit.

Why fly another demo flight if you can get a customer to put a satellite on
it?

If the launch is free, there's almost certainly a college or amateur radio

No doubt, yes. But why didn't they call it "TestFlight 2" then? A
demonstration flight is a different thing than a test flight or a
development flight. When you test, you expect problems and errors, you
*do* the test to learn about problems, even to the extent to provoke
problems. When you do a demo, you except the thing to work and you do the
demo to demonstrate that it works, even to the extent that you try to
avoid doing things you're not sure about. Testing is engineering,
demoing is marketing.

Silly wording discussion, that. Still, when I demonstrate a software to
a client and it fails to accomplish the mission and then weasel out with
"Err, this actually was a test run and not a demo" I take flak and
rightly so. When you're overconfident and call a test run a "demo"
you'll look silly when what you're finally demonstrating is how to botch
up stage separation and a control system that can't cope with propellant
sloshing induced by the botched separation. Fine outcome for a test
flight (you've found a problem and gathered data to understand and fix
it), bad outcome for a demo (you did demonstrate the wrong thing and
have people talk about success or not).

This does *not* mean that SpaceX hasn't done a fine job so far, mind
you. They just should have used a dictionary before naming the flight.

DemoFlight 2 had a passive aluminum ring to release as a demo how to

*yawn*  spin, spin, spin.

Even if you call it a 'demo' - what was it expected to demonstrate?
The ability of Falcon to reach orbit.  It failed to do so.  The
demonstration was a failure.

Even if you call it a 'test' - what was it expected to test?  The
ability of Falcon to reach orbit.  It failed to do so.  The test was a
failure.

Even if you call it an 'operational flight'...  Well, you see the
pattern by now.

Count me firmly among those who realize the differences between (and
the usefulness of) the three types of flights - but don't piss on my
leg and claim that it is raining.  The flight was a failure.

Oh, tosh.  It significantly advanced the program goals.  It was not a

Why?  It's not like it was going to bring it back if it wasn't in the
right position.  One of the (many) goals of the test flight was to see
if the ring released properly in space.  It would in fact be dumb to
not to test this just because they didn't hit their trajectory target.

But I guess you still don't understand why they did the flight, since
you're foolishly determined in a binary manner to deem it a "failure."

DemoFlight 1 had a satellite which was somewhat ill-fated (didn't get
very far at all) but very lucky on the other hand by crashing through
the roof of a workshop shed near the launch site and landing on a
workbench there with obviously limited damage... There was talk about
repairing it and launching it again back then. Would be a nice candidate
for DemoFlight 3...

Yes, clearly so. It demonstrated how to botch staging and how to not

No. A test is only a failure if it doesn't help you to understand why
an error occured. Testing is for finding errors, not for not finding
them. If a test uncovers a problem and you get enough data to analyze
and possibly fix the problem you can't call the test failed. But it
wasn't TestFlight 2, it was DemoFlight 2...

If they would've called it a test flight there would be nothing to
talk about (except technical things). As far as tests go, it was quite a
successful one. Almost all systems worked as intended and they seem to
have got enough data to analyze the problem. That's a fine outcome for a
test flight.

The only thing you can accuse them of (besides of having a not-so-clean
staging and a not-so-clever control system of course, but it's called
rocket science for a reason) is a tiny bit over-confidence in wording,
which led to them ending up a tiny bit red-faced. That's not the end of
the world and probably not even the end of SpaceX.

And the Delta IV-H was heavily based on the Delta IV-M, which had three
successful launches.  When you can point to that sort of design heritage, at
a company with a long history of successful launch vehicles, you expect
success, so you stick a payload on top.  I think the high expectations for
the first launch were justified.

For me, the first Ariane 5 had slightly lower expectations than the Delta
IV-H because there wasn't the same level of design heritage, so it wasn't as
surprising when it failed on the first try.

Falcon I has a lot less (almost nothing) in common with prior, successful
launch vehicles than either Delta IV-H or Ariane 5.  Considering Space-X's
lack of experience and lack of hardware heritage, I always expected they'd
have a steeper learning curve than Boeing.  The first launch was a serious
disappointment because it didn't get far, but the second is very
encouraging, despite the problems and despite the fact that it didn't make
orbit.

I don't think this is a double standard.  I think it's acknowledging the
experience base of the two companies and the design heritage (or lack
thereof) in the vehicles themselves.  I think the people who are crying
double standard aren't looking at the details.  The devil is always in the
details.

Life in general has this lack of standardization.  Take sports, for
example.  A team of expensive veterans might be considered a failure
if they don't reach the championship game (think New York Yankees).
On the other hand, an expansion team might be considered a huge
success if they reach the second rounds of the playoff.

Or a student from a poor family is considered a success for getting
into a college that a more priviledged family might consider a
failure.

Or stocks - a startup might be a success for losing less money than
expected, where an older and established company can be a failure for
making huge amounts of money, but not as much as anticipated.

This is entirely expected and rational.  A inclusive definition of
success includes at least 3 factors: (1) the performance on the task
at hand,  (2) the amount of resources expended, and (3) the expected
future performance given what is known so far.  This is not some weird
waffing metric designed to disguise failure - this is the one that
people use when voting with their money (making investments) instead
of the strict definition (1) proposed by many here.  This is in spite
of (3) being a very vague criterium.

So I think declaring the Delta-IV heavy a failure while calling SpaceX-
II is success is perfectly rational and not a double standard at all.
It's just using an agueably better definition of success.

(On the other hand, I personally think the Delta-IV heavy was a
roaring success.  Its main objective was to work well enough to
convince the DOD to shut down the Titan line and move all future heavy
launches to the Delta-IV heavy.  At this it succeeded 100%.)

Ummmmm....

I don't think so.  You're seeing something that's not there.  I in
particular am not a big fan of the SpaceX approach, and never have
been.  But they clearly got a lot of useful information from that test
flight, and tremendously advanced their progress, and to
simplistically call it a "failure" is misleading in the extreme.

It actually achieved orbit. Had a real payload been aboard, the
payload would most likely have completed its mission (at the cost of
some onboard prop). Falcon 1 Demoflight failed to achieve orbit at
all.

Delta IV-Heavy is considered a failure.
Falcon 1 Demoflight 2 is considered a success.

Go figure.

Yes, sometimes double standards make sense.  Would you be happier if
it had been called "Testflight 2"?

That's nice Rand.

God, but it must suck to be you.

I imagine it's still called "Rocket Science" because when you get into
the field of large boosters, the total number of types built isn't
really that large when you come right down to it, and designing a new
one is still a mighty big challenge in which you are bound to run into
new and unexpected problems.
Considering that the whole concept is to take a tremendous amount of
chemical energy and contain it in something that directs it precisely
where needed when needed in a completely controlled manner while being
as light as possible, and one can see the size of the engineering
problems the designers and builders of a new booster are up against.

Yeah, the post desperately attempting to compare the aerospace
industry to an underdog sports team to justify calling a launch
failure a "success".

Cue the "Rocky" theme... Rocky lost the bout, but wait, he's really
the winner! "Yo, Elon!"

So long as they call it a "launch failure", they can name it what they
like.

Let me reiterate that I'm not upset because SpaceX crashed another
rocket. They're doing things on the cheap (deliberately) so setbacks
were almost unavoidable and the road to success was expected to be
bumpy. SpaceX represents a new way of thinking and an escape from the
politics of Big Aerospace. Unfortunately, SpaceX is now mimicking Big
Aerospace, launching a spin campaign to try and make everyone forget
that the Falcon 1 failed to achieve orbit like it was supposed to.  If
they've adopted Boeing-esque propoganda, what will they steal from
Boeing next... high launch costs? Long, slow launch campaigns? Theft
of proprietary data from a rival?

The expression 'close but no cigar' applies here.  The issue will be
moot if falcon's third try is a success.  In any case the
accomplishment was far greater than that of space ship one, as a
'space ship' it was only 2% successful.
