[...how this sorry little clown expects to run his bogus war, the
country and cut taxes at the same time is beyond me.]

Here's the latest desperate plea for attention from the White House:

President Bush said yesterday that he is considering a fresh plan
to cut tax rates for U.S. corporations to make them more competitive
around the world, an initiative that could further inflame a battle
with the Democratic Congress over spending and taxes and help define
the remainder of his tenure.

....The focus on economic issues on Bush's last day in Washington
before leaving town today for most of the rest of the month reflected
a White House strategy to confront Democrats on tax and spending
issues. With most of his second-term domestic legislative agenda in
tatters and his strategy in Iraq under bipartisan fire, Bush appears
eager to return to familiar issues that animated the beginning of his
presidency and might rally disaffected Republicans behind him again.

He really is like a windup doll, isn't he? No matter what's going on
in the outside world, no matter what problems we're facing, no matter
what the political situation is, you pull the cord and he says &quot;Tax
cuts!&quot; It's like he's the Manchurian President.
