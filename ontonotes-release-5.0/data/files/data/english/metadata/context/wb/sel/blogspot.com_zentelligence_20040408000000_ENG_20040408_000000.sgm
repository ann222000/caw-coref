Microsoft in Bed with Gartner?

Outside, it's a harsh blue sky and white sand day. Qatar is a
remarkable country sitting on billions of dollars worth of natural gas
and with only a few hundred thousand citizens to share the benefits.

Last night, it took longer to reach the end of the queue here in Doha
than to fly here from Bahrain. I was disappointed as Qatar has been
hailing its progress towards electronic government and this was a fine
example of what the country needs to replace.

Bahrain, Oman, Dubai and Kuwait make visas a painless process. Qatar
and Saudi Arabia are quite the reverse, culturally and practically and
why this is so I have no idea but it doesn't and shouldn't have to be
this way as all the other Gulf states are now competing on quality of
service and welcoming foreign business.

Microsoft's Mansour with Gartner's Gordon Frank

Bahrain has been transformed by last week's Formula One race. One
immediate beneficiary is the Duty Free area at the airport, which has
been expanded and boasts two F1 racing cars among the shops.

Back to Kuwait this evening and from there, on to London and Easter.
I wonder if my motorcycle is where I left it at Heathrow?

Meanwhile, four US fighter jets scream overhead the Marriot hotel as
they leave the airport towards Iraq
