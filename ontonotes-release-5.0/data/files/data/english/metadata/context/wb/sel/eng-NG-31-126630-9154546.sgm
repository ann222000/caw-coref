Bamboo is a fast growing, environmentally friendly and multipurpose
plant in the world.  With  high quality of bamboo together with
precise techniques &amp; procedures to refine bamboo charcoal, which
discovered numerous benefits effective in the maintenance of a healthy
lifestyle.

Bamboo Charcoal has tons of hexogen porous which provide an
extraordinary absorbability power.  Which there are many uses,
including air purification, relative humidity adjustment, and
electromagnetic risk reduction.  Also, it is effectively to absorb
odor, contains large million of natural inorganic compounds absorbed
from the soil during its growth, which in turn gives drinking water a
refreshing flavor.

More than that, 'Bamboo Charcoal' is being used on agriculture
industry in Asian countries, such as Taiwan, Japan... etc years ago.
Refer to a study report from Tokai University, Japan.  It states
bamboo charcoal has tended to retain the supplies fertilizers in  the
rhizosphere.  It also tended to keep the soil pH in a range that was
suitable for the growth of plants.  It is effectively for improving
the soil and promoting crop growth.

Nevertheless, Bamboo Charcoal Vinegar, it is able to anti-bacteria and
can be used as air-freshener.

Tampa Electric Company has threatened to not restore my power if my bamboo
is not cut down completely that is near the power line that feeds my house
unless I pay them nearly 5000 dollars so they can go underground

Is there anyone out there that can give me advice or tips what to about
this?

I my mind I want to plant more bamboo directly under the line that feeds 4
of my neighbor's homes and see what they do.

I do not have the money to pay them. Can anyone give me advice what to do
Thank you

That stand of bamboo is over 15 years old with 3 species I have to loose it

Go ahead and &quot;cut it down&quot; ::   it'll be back next  spring, if not before...
Is it actually on their easement ?  ?    If not you have a case, but if it
is, I'd repeat::  Cut  it down to satisfy them and it'll grow back....      Of
course it's just a way for good bureaucrats to show the power they have over
you, but sounds like your not in any position to do much aabout it..    THEY
won't even know your thumbing your nose at'em, until next  year, and  bye
then maybe they won't notice just one more fly on their  line..

Wirebender-

What specific electric lines are you talking about?  The 7KV primary
(usually the top most wire at the end of a cross arm - if your bamboo
touches this, you'll see the arcs and sparks)  0r the 220 volt (3 wires that
make it to your meter and your neighbors  - it starts usually at a pole
mounted transformer )?   or something else ?   In general, the higher the
wires, the higher the voltage.

Bamboo and power lines are a dumb and potentially deadly mix.  If you 'have'
to plant it under power lines, plant a species that will not hit the power
lines.  If you plant the big ones, you're asking for a lifetime of problems.
Remember hurricanes????

Do you have the warning in writing?  or a verbal threat from a tree trimmer
hired by TECO?

My own experience suggests you can work with them - sometimes.

While I was away several years ago, the hired tree trimmers came in my yard
and cut my B. vulgaris Vittata down to the ground - both in the easement and
outside the easement.  I wrote a short but direct letter to them and
documented all costs.  Copies to Action Lines, newspaper, etc.  We settled
for $700, and their check did not bounce.  The bamboo quickly recovered.
They screwed up when they went outside the easement.   Now when the tree
trimmers come through (about every 3 years), they talk to me first.  The
bamboo gets trimmed so it stays 6-8 ft away from their lines.  The power
stays on and the bamboo does not look too bad trimmed.

In another capacity, I've met and talked to Progress Energy's chief
forester.   PE aims for a three year trim - trees and anything else in the
easement or that may come within 6-8 ft of their power lines.

The average palm related outage on this side of the bay costs about $800+ to
restore and takes about 75 min.  PE has about 140/yr in St. Pete.   Guess
who pays?   You and me!    PE does not track bamboo caused outages.

As much as I like palms and bamboo, planting anything that will grow into
power lines is real stupid.   Visit my yard here in St. Pete and I'll give
you some excellent examples of my own screw ups.   Most of us cannot plan
ahead one year, much less 5-10 years for a little 3 gal bamboo or palm to
grow into the power lines.  (The bamboo takes even less time).

I was very lucky during our big storm year - no outages at all.  One cicuit
breaker down the  7KV line and they were out for 10 days due to tree caused
damage.

I doubt if you want to spend $5000 on a lawyer to fight it.   Try talking
nicely to them (I know it hurts at times) and negotiate.   ...and please let
us know how it is resolved.

Is there another spot you can move the Bamboo to?  We moved some 50
ft Oldhamii and some G atroviolcia in 3-4 culm clumps without too
much trouble--and it was not just across the lawn.

My experience with many species is that the higher up the culm that trim
cuts are made, the less likely THAT culm will ever grow much higher ... only
send out some lateral shoots, if that (depending on the height or % cut
off). Likewise, when new shoots grow up, they can be topped at a similar
height and that is as far as they should grow. If you do it before the new
shoot sprouts its lateral branches/foliage, it should proably be able to do
a controlled snap at a preselected node ... no sharp blades needed.
So, your bamboo should be much easier to manange than a big oak or ficus
tree, etc.

So, it should be easier to treat it like any large tree sharing space with
power lines. And nobody is almost ever expected to remove such trees. Just
trim them.

15 years they have been there.....and now they finilly are making a
new plan for your boo. I dont think so. Use that to your advantage.

I dont think they have a case if you cut the boo back 6 to 8 feet from
the lines and photogaph it as such. Now you have taken the bait away
from them! They now also have a uphill battle to prove that there was
ever was a problem.
Also make it clear to someone in (charge with the photos in hand) that
there is no boo in the lines and to stay away. Letters and email wont
do, so you might should see the man in person and shake on it.

With that said, I would like to stress I read an artical in the
orlando paper about a year ago where this guy got killed by boo in the
electric lines so be careful it must have enough water in it to jump
along the culms and to the ground.

Lets be a little more specific. What 3 boo species are growing under
the lines. That would tell me the height and how long it would take to
grow back if you cut it 6-8 feet from there lines. How long did it
take to reach the lines in the first place, not 15 years.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Roger and I, who regularly see bamboo in the chaotic wiring of
southern california which may include very upscale old neighborhoods,
as well as the hole of rural poverty in which we live, see the city
pruners come along and regularly prune &quot;Holes&quot; in the highly
flammable Eucalyptus and similar trees in which the electric lines
are embedded. and the wiring passes through these holes with some
amount of clearance.

Here is what I do not understand.
and may be in need some more information.

do you live in a place where other folks have trees which are pruned
to give clearance to the electric lines? If so, who does the pruning?
is it done by the city, or privately at the request or demand of the
power company?

Can you prune the bamboo to give a couple or three feet of clearance
to the electric lines?

the time you have had the bamboo with no complaints is sometimes
called (in legal eagle talk) &quot;Condoning&quot; . But forget that for a
moment. if you got out your camera and walked around in your
neighborhood, could you take pictures of other plantings impinging on
the electric lines? Could you take photos of plantings which shows
reasonable clearance from the electrical lines?

Did you get this in a written piece of paper from the electric company?

It's a 7kv line that runs to my transformer pole.
My boo is not directly under the line but at times its closer than 5 or 6
feet. The problem is when heavy winds will cause the boo to rub on or hang
on it. I tried several years to go underground but they wanted 1200 bucks
and I did not have the money, I asked them to put it on my bill and let me
pay for it over time, they would not let me.

BTW they said they are going to &quot;remove&quot; the bamboo. I do not like the sound
of that.

Please tell me more about this easement and what are &quot;the rules of
engagement&quot;  Do you mean they cannot cut the boo any further than 6 foot
from the line?

Wirebender-

Must be arcs and sparks night with the wind we're having this evening.  Mine
does the same thing - and usually fries/burns off the top of the culm.  The
neighbors enjoy an occasional free light show.

Any easements on your property should be clearly delineated on the property
survey.   I have a copy of the survey from when I bought this place 19 years
ago (the same one was used when I refinanced some years back).  On my
property, there's a five foot wide drain/utility easement on three sides (it
is a pentagonal shaped lot).

Who is the 'they' you are dealing with?  On this side of the bay, Progress
Energy contracts out their tree trimming work.  I've found the workers to
range from useless to co-operative - when I can communicate with them since
many are Spanish speaking.  However, the supervisor (when he can be found)
is fluent in English.

If I were you, I'd contact FL Power and talk to their forester or whatever
his title is.  Some responsible person is in charge of all that tree
trimming work.

Don't settle for a low level flunky.  Keep notes of who said what.  Be
reasonable and cooperative.  They have a battery of lawyers; you don't.
And since I'm no lawyer, I cannot advise your about the rules of engagement.
But as I heard a judge tell the litigants in a civil trial &quot;A negotiated
settlement is always better than a directed verdict.&quot;

Whatever you do, keep clear of the 7KV primary.  Even the linemen who are
well-trained treat this high voltage line with respect.

Whew, $1200 to put a 7kv primary underground sounds real cheap.

As I mentioned in an earlier post, we settled out of court for $700.  But I
was willing to take them to small claims court, and my case was
well-documented.   I think I am now on PE's 'A' list - A for Ahole but we
talk before they cut now (and I've found that if I'm nice, the trimming crew
will take care of a few other trim jobs also like a ratty sheffelera that
was too close to the lines and that I wanted to get rid of.  All they had to
do was trim it - but with a little encouragement, they took it down to
ground level which is what I wanted).

In summary, try talking directly to someone in charge at TECO; be polite but
firm.    Hope this helps a bit,

Phil
in sunny St. Pete

P.S.  If all else fails, maybe Hermine can loan you a few Patterdale
Terriers to scare off the trimming crew.

on it. I tried several years to go underground but they wanted 1200 bucks
and I did not have the money, I asked them to put it on my bill and let me
pay for it over time, they would not let me.

BTW they said they are going to &quot;remove&quot; the bamboo. I do not like the sound
of that.

Please tell me more about this easement and what are &quot;the rules of
engagement&quot;  Do you mean they cannot cut the boo any further than 6 foot
from the line?

Wirebender-

What specific electric lines are you talking about?  The 7KV primary
(usually the top most wire at the end of a cross arm - if your bamboo
touches this, you'll see the arcs and sparks)  0r the 220 volt (3 wires that

make it to your meter and your neighbors  - it starts usually at a pole
mounted transformer )?   or something else ?   In general, the higher the
wires, the higher the voltage.

Bamboo and power lines are a dumb and potentially deadly mix.  If you 'have'

to plant it under power lines, plant a species that will not hit the power
lines.  If you plant the big ones, you're asking for a lifetime of problems.

Remember hurricanes????

Do you have the warning in writing?  or a verbal threat from a tree trimmer
hired by TECO?

My own experience suggests you can work with them - sometimes.

While I was away several years ago, the hired tree trimmers came in my yard
and cut my B. vulgaris Vittata down to the ground - both in the easement and

outside the easement.  I wrote a short but direct letter to them and
documented all costs.  Copies to Action Lines, newspaper, etc.  We settled
for $700, and their check did not bounce.  The bamboo quickly recovered.
They screwed up when they went outside the easement.   Now when the tree
trimmers come through (about every 3 years), they talk to me first.  The
bamboo gets trimmed so it stays 6-8 ft away from their lines.  The power
stays on and the bamboo does not look too bad trimmed.

In another capacity, I've met and talked to Progress Energy's chief
forester.   PE aims for a three year trim - trees and anything else in the
easement or that may come within 6-8 ft of their power lines.

The average palm related outage on this side of the bay costs about $800+ to

restore and takes about 75 min.  PE has about 140/yr in St. Pete.   Guess
who pays?   You and me!    PE does not track bamboo caused outages.

As much as I like palms and bamboo, planting anything that will grow into
power lines is real stupid.   Visit my yard here in St. Pete and I'll give
you some excellent examples of my own screw ups.   Most of us cannot plan
ahead one year, much less 5-10 years for a little 3 gal bamboo or palm to
grow into the power lines.  (The bamboo takes even less time).

I was very lucky during our big storm year - no outages at all.  One cicuit
breaker down the  7KV line and they were out for 10 days due to tree caused
damage.

I doubt if you want to spend $5000 on a lawyer to fight it.   Try talking
nicely to them (I know it hurts at times) and negotiate.   ...and please let

us know how it is resolved.

DO YOU HAVE A PLOT MAP OF YOUR PROPERTY WHICH SHOWS ALL EASEMENTS.
This is not a secret, it is a matter of public record. start making
phone calls, like to the treasurers office and find out where you can
go to get a plot map of your property. they will want block and lot
number not address, but you can look that up too, ALL PUBLIC RECORD.
find out where the easement is.  you will probably find out where
your boundaries are exactly. maybe there is a surveyors office. ask
around, tell em what you need, not WHY.

nearly all property is criss-crossed with all kinds of easements.
this is not usually a source of trouble.

THEN you may have to speak to somebody in ZONING or some other agent
of the real estate department to find out exactly what easements MEAN
where you live.

myself, i think this will be permanent war unless you relocate the
bamboo. you really do not want an unsafe condition anyway.

However there WILL BE IN WRITING A THING WHICH SAYS all plantings may
come within X feet of power lines. it is not done by seat of the
plants or sniffing the wind, it is a real NUMBER SOMEWHERE.

I work for a utility in So Cal. I think you ought to call your utility and have them put you in contact with the local person in charge of that area.  You should be able to work something out.  What you work out depends solely on the temperment of the person in charge there and what they think of your attitude.  I've seen people &quot;attitude&quot; their way into substantial costs and delays where othertimes I've seen people &quot;attitude&quot; their way into substantially lower (or no) costs and faster response.

Keep in mind that if for some reason no easement was recorded on the deed they will refuse you service (legally) until such time as an easement is in place.  In this case the utility is exercising their right to access that is part of any agreement to provide service.  These rules are established by the US DOT (department of transportatoin) and/or your state public utilities commission.  These rules are generally very vague in their wording.  Here is an example from So. Cal regarding access to our facilities:

&quot;RULE 25: The Utility will, at all times, have the right of ingress to and egress from the customer's premises at all reasonable hours for any purpose reasonably connected with the furnishing of gas, including determination of priority assignments, and the exercise of any and all rights secured to it by law, or these rules.

As provided for in the rules herein contained, the Utility shall have the right to remove any and all of its property installed on the customer's premises at the termination of service.&quot;

Basically says we can go on your property any time we feel it is necessary, and you must provide us that access.

Your utility may have not noticed the problem existed before, but they are required to act on it once it is &quot;noticed&quot;.  Telling them that they have &quot;condoned&quot; this all of these years will not make them turn a blind eye to it now.  They now know about it, it has most certainly been documented and now the bueracracy must cover its backside by making this situation safe.

I managed to upset somebody today by removing a very large, ornately cut, thorny bush overgrowing our gas meter.  I pointed out to them their obligation to make sure we have safe access to our facilities, and the fact that a large thorny bush overgrowing that meter does not do anything to help that.  I recently had to tell somebody that they needed to move their air conditioner condenser that they had placed near our gas meter a few years before.  There can be no source of ignition within 3 feet of any gas meter.  They had a fit, they weren't wrong in being upset, only with whom they were upset.  They screamed at my boss who pointed out to them that they had 48 hours to move the condenser  or that we were going to remove our gas meter.  The hazard will be eliminated by one side or the other.

My point is that the utility is going to have to act in a way that it feels is the best way to remove the potential hazard.  If you are reasonable and you are dealing with a reasonable person I think you will find some middle ground.  Like trimming  the bamboo so it can not come within 6 feet of the power lines (whatever the requirement is).  Whatever you agree to, stick to it, otherwise all bets are off.

Good luck!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I would have to agree with this. the condoning thing may have some
merit if you are on the sweetest of terms with the person who shows
up, and if you manage one way or another to ask if there is not some
middle ground, since you do not want to be responsible for burning
down your city. But that surely some kind of pruning MUST be possible
because you have seen it elsewhere.

the truth I i do not see enough pruning done here, and it is a
nominal hole cut in trees to allow the wires to pass through. if you
have not seen a fire start from this arc in a windstorm, ( HAVE!) you
might not take it seriously...however, wires and landscape do manage
to co exist. IF I could work out a time payment deal i would LOVE to
see your wires underground!

I have a story. where I used to live I had a glorious grove of henon.
way way overhead were wires. one day I come home to vandalization of
my grove, canes hacked off two feet off the ground, six feet, and so
forth, the grove looks horrible, but not much has been done
percentagewise..... and I called the police. the officer arrived and
said, WHO HATES YOU ENOUGH TO DO THIS? it did not occur to him that
this was PRUNING. the next day a truck full of female convicts on
work detail pulled up in front of the house, i was lucky to hear
them, and their burly keeper, a feminine version of Ernest Borgnine.
she said the power companies required the pruning, and I began to
scream (Possibly you heard me!) that my bamboo was nowhere NEAR the
wires and I was calling her boss directly and she had best get her
vandellas back into their truck OR ELSE. The work crew LOVED the idea
that I was screaming at their boss. Her boss told her to get her
miserable ass out of my yard, and that was the last I saw of her and
the alleged pruners. even as I write this I want to punch a hole in
the wall! the wires were two and a half stories high and this was
HENON!  fifteen feet tall. everyone else had ancient Eucalyptus and
nasty fastigate evergreens with the wires EMBEDDED in the trees.

now this was not an example of a person being NICE. I realize that,
and my situation was not like yours, but you do see what can happen
if they get pissed off or demented.

Time to go up the food chain and keep going.  Always be polite with who you speak with but keep going up the food chain.  The only thing that needs to happen is the bamboo to be made safe around the powerlines.  The only thing they are allowed to do is trim it away from the power lines.  This is where you bring up the fact that the bamboo has been harmlessly growing there for 15 years and that they have indeed come out and observed your plants and nothing was done then, why now? Have Roy or some other bamboo seller give you an &quot;estimate&quot; as to what it would cost to replace the bamboo to the state it is in now and tell them that this will be the basis of your lawsuit.  I'm sure it will be somewhere in the neighborhood of $4500 ;-)

Your bamboo should never be in danger of coming in contact with the power. That is your responsibility, if they are willing to trim it away that is fine too but they need to treat your bamboo the same way that they treat trees.  Unless Florida lists your specific bamboo as a noxious weed they should not treat it any differently.  They may very well dig out all of your bamboo, document the hell out of it.  Be a real pain in the ass photographing them doing it, get names and document times and who was in charge.  Photograph each person damaging your property.  Calling the police will do no good, they'll tell you to stay out of the way and let them do their work.  I have had people here in California attempt to deny me access to our companies facilities and call the cops when I insisted on access.  The police not only told them they had to let me in, but cut the locks of the gates so that I COULD get in.  Their rights as far as access to maintain their facilities is near
absolute easement or not.

Best of luck, I really hope it works out.

There are two parts to this, the serious aspect and the comic aspect.. I can appreciate both ;-)

In general, you are required to give these people safe access on your property so that they can maintain their facilities.  To give you an idea, a few years ago I had some &quot;person&quot; sic their pit bull on me while I was trying to collect a bill.  Fortunately the dog didn't close the distance with me so I didn't have to harm the dog (would have loved to harm the owner).  I contacted animal control, the guy threatend the animal control officer who called the police who made sure the animal control officer could take custody of the dog and he took custody of the idiot.  I took custody of our meter.  When the idiot did manage to finally get his gas back on it ended up costing him several hundred dollars to us, and whatever animal control fined him as well as any criminal action that resulted from his being taken away in bracelets.  I never had to testify so I don't know the exact outcome, but the dog isn't there anymore.

Yes, rocksalt in the backside is ALWAYS funny... but comedy like that will cause you to suffer for your art when Bubba in the aptly named &quot;Pokey&quot; decides to enlighten you on another comical stereotype.... Prison Love. :p

I can feel your flustration on all this and I think everyone is just
as upset also and want answers. One reason I am so interested is
because I have 700 feet of wood fence with 4 power lines (typical
lines you see along the road, distribution lines?) set 6 feet back
from it all along the 700 feet. It is like an alley way, dirt path,
officialy an easement back there behind my fence. Now get this. About
2 years ago in my desparation, and foolishness to block the veiw of a
future development schelded to go in this summer I  planted
monsters....clone x, buddah belly, old hammii, dolichoclada, and
Bambusa tuldoides along the fence. (I could not afford or get shorter
varities of boo at the time) . Well it worked, and a wall of green is
happening but one clone x culm is already touching the bottom power
line!

The ironic thing is my dad worked 38 years for and retired from what
was then called Floida Power Corporation  . I wish he was around today
cause he would have some answers for me. After his passing he left me
a 4 peice yellow pole saw cutter  ( FPC issue !!! ) and boy is it
long, lightweight a strong. I will put it to good use I am sure.

My plan for now is to keep my boo trimmed away from the lines while
it is young and so am I, so I wont give reason to be a victim of any
private, corporate, public, government institution invading my life.

My other plan is to slowly replace the monster boos with shorter
varities yet somehow keep a wall of green as a screen in the process.
Anyone want to trade for shorter boo, let me know, I can remove,
transplant and transport.

(as we know clumpers only go to seed every 50-100 years and can't
spread unless they are dug up and moved by people). So any so called
stupid authority comes in my yard to remove it, then in small claimes
court they would have a hard time proving that my clumpers are
invasive.   therefore only require trimming, not removal. I think you
could win money on that alone.

Sorry I haven't read all of the emails on this but hopefully this helps.

I talked to my attorney and this is the advice:
1.      There is typically a 5 foot easement (sometimes 10 foot) that you
can confirm with the survey from when you purchased the property.
2.      Within this easement they have the right to gain full access the
easement area, clear the property within the easement, etc.
3.      If your vegetation grows into the easement they have the right to
cut the vegetation growing the area of the easement but not to remove the
vegetation outside the easement.

I would review the link below which is a document from TECOs website.
http://www.tampaelectric.com/residential/productsandservices/treetrim...
ntingguide/

I would check the survey to confirm the area you are talking about is in or
out of the easement.  After that write a to your contact person stating the
easement, your willingness to maintain your bamboo to keep it out of the
TECO easement and give growth/spread data about the species you are growing.
You need to document an effort to cooperate for future possible legal action
and be willing to follow through.

Send the letter in registered mail the TECO person you have been talking
with, send a copy to the highest person in TECO that you can get an address
and copy the Florida Public Service Commission that regulates the power
company (Dan Hoppe, Division of Regulatory Compliance &amp;
Consumer Assistance in charge of Bureaus: Auditing, Safety, Complaint
Resolution).  If you could get the bamboo society to write the letter it
would be better.  This is a common issue to the group.

Contact the local police and inquire about their past involvement with this
type of situation and see if they will protect you against the destruction
of your property outside of the easement, especially if you know when it is
going to happen.

If it is safe I would clear the area of the easement and the vertical
vegetation about 3 feet beyond the easement before they get there and
basically threaten the people that show up with legal action if they destroy
your property beyond the easement.  The clearing will demonstrate your
willingness to maintain the bamboo and clearly draw the line of destroying
your property.

It maybe just easier to move the bamboo!  If you do decide to fight this
after the bamboo is cut file a civil lawsuit against TECO, you do not need a
lawyer for that, although it would be a good idea.

Time to go up the food chain and keep going.  Always be polite with who you
speak with but keep going up the food chain.  The only thing that needs to
happen is the bamboo to be made safe around the powerlines.  The only thing
they are allowed to do is trim it away from the power lines.  This is where
you bring up the fact that the bamboo has been harmlessly growing there for
15 years and that they have indeed come out and observed your plants and
nothing was done then, why now? Have Roy or some other bamboo seller give
you an &quot;estimate&quot; as to what it would cost to replace the bamboo to the
state it is in now and tell them that this will be the basis of your
lawsuit.  I'm sure it will be somewhere in the neighborhood of $4500 ;-)

Your bamboo should never be in danger of coming in contact with the power.
That is your responsibility, if they are willing to trim it away that is
fine too but they need to treat your bamboo the same way that they treat
trees.  Unless Florida lists your specific bamboo as a noxious weed they
should not treat it any differently.  They may very well dig out all of your
bamboo, document the hell out of it.  Be a real pain in the ass
photographing them doing it, get names and document times and who was in
charge.  Photograph each person damaging your property.  Calling the police
will do no good, they'll tell you to stay out of the way and let them do
their work.  I have had people here in California attempt to deny me access
to our companies facilities and call the cops when I insisted on access.
The police not only told them they had to let me in, but cut the locks of
the gates so that I COULD get in.  Their rights as far as access to maintain
their facilities is near absolute easement or not.

Best of luck, I really hope it works out.

I want to thank everyone for the help in finding a way out of this. That
bamboo (3 species) has been there for 17 years, it was the first bamboo I
ever bought from Roy. Like Mr. Stager when I planted it I did not realize
what I was doing.

To answer some of your questions and keep it short here it is

&quot;The man&quot; is Luke P. Diruzza, Jr. Manager, Line Clearance &amp; Inspections
Tampa Electric Company

He says he is concerned with my Safety and my family could be killed by
touching the bamboo whiles it hanging on the line. (At the moment there is
no bamboo touching the energized line)

He says the Bamboo is an &quot;invasive species&quot; he says there is no 5 or 10 foot
easement when it comes to bamboo.

He says my bamboo is directly under his line, he said he came out and took
pictures (There are a few culms that lean over are directly under his line
but out of the ground about 5 feet away for the closest ones)

He is not going to dig up my bamboo(too costly) he is going to cut it down
completely and pour stuff on the roots to kill it.

Marlon thank you for checking with your attorney and the advice you gave. I
am going today to remove any bamboo within 5 foot of what I think is TECO's
easement it will not be that hard to do.

If its 10 foot man I am in trouble, I will lose some major culms but its
better than losing the whole grove.

This is not the whole story Bamboo people, the Trimming crew that came in
here 3 years ago butchered my Canopy oaks real bad, I am sure they did not
use prescribed pruning methods like they did in the past 25 years,  &quot;the
Man&quot;  says different, they also left many large diameter limbs 2-3 foot long
in the high grass, there so many of them that when I went to cut the grass
after repeated hits they finally destroyed my mower deck( I rebuilt it and
replaced parts on it.) I had to buy a new mower, &quot;the man&quot; says they where
fallen limbs, but I told &quot;the man&quot; you can clearly see the limbs where cut
not broke off, I am going to send him pictures to his email, He says he
never saw the limbs when he came out, so I think he lied that checked out
the grand canopy oaks his tree trimmer butchered.

Thanks again and I will keep you posted as it progresses.

Sorry I haven't read all of the emails on this but hopefully this helps.

I talked to my attorney and this is the advice:

1.      There is typically a 5 foot easement (sometimes 10 foot) that you
can confirm with the survey from when you purchased the property.

2.      Within this easement they have the right to gain full access the
easement area, clear the property within the easement, etc.

3.      If your vegetation grows into the easement they have the right to
cut the vegetation growing the area of the easement but not to remove the

Bull  Stuff::   the Law makes no such  judgement.   Whatever your owership
survey says IS the legal  limit.     You are wise to cut the culms that &quot;might'
could be &quot;leaning' over the easement..    In fact if you cut off  a number of
culms on that side and continue to do so, by cutting off the new  shoots that
come  up on that side, you will eventually MOVE the clump  further away...
And of course the clumpers are  definitely NOT invasive, so you have  THAT
on your side, should you decide  to carry  it further.   (See next Parag)
And  you CAN take them to small claims court, for very few bucks
(NO attorney's  allowed in our Texas small claims courts and every state has
similiar  rules.)     with your pictures and such, you could probably  definitly
recover the cost of your lawn mower repairs and possibly even the new  mower
(don't get greedy-- just get even)..     It might even  be enough to get &quot;the
Man&quot; fired...      They are NOT  &quot;Mr. God Almighty&quot;,   as many such folks
sseem to think.
I  ended up working for the State of Texas as few years at the
end of my working  life:: (not because I wanted to, but it was the ONLY job I
could find, at my  age, at the time... )    But major lesson I learned about
&quot;bureaucrats:: dyed in the wool, true BUREAUCRATS,   is the their true  goal in
life is to wee-wee on the leg of their fellow  man...     It sounds to me, as
if you accidently got  saddled, with one of the TRUEST bureaucrats, of our
times.       All in the name of our &quot;health and  safety' of course..   You KNOW
us common citizens are too dumb  to take care of ourselves.

Good luck and best wishes..

Wirebender-

Thanks for the update.
Ask him nicely for a reference that defines bamboo as an 'invasive species'   - then watch him fumble....

See the attached for info on trimming trees.  If you want more info on this, see a work by a Dr. Shigo - supposedly THE authority on tree trimming in way of power lines.  You can probably get a copy on an inter-library loan if Tampa Library system does not have a copy.

Either you have a 5 or 10 ft easement.  Best that you find out what it is instead of listening to some b/s from TECO.

Kinder's advice on Small Claims Court applies here in FL.  I was all set to go that route with Progress Energy until we settled out of court.  The guy that came out with the forms for me to sign had a truck full of them which tells me he was dealing with a lot of po'd customers.  Whatever you do, document it, document , document it; take lots of photos of whatever TECO does.

In general for civil cases, whoever has the best documentation wins.  So if you can't dazzlethem with brilliance, baffle them with BS.

Cheers,

Phil

We are essentially ALL potentially in your position!   I have no
desire to cause a fire by any means, let alone bad choices in
landscaping! we deal with this all the time since folks here plant
huge bamboo on there perimeters, which is where there is primitive
electrical wiring up in the air.

However it does sound to me like you are in the clutches of a power
crazed and destructive man who is using his position to make some
HAVOC and MISERY in your life. I am equally certain you do not want
to burn down your home via accidental bamboo/electric wire
contact.   And I hate to see a citizen hammered out of his civil
rights by some twelve rate hired MONSTER SADIST, which is what this
company seems to hire, given its past history.

I hope you can resolve this without poisoned earth and a destroyed landscape.

remember, CRUSH THE STATE!

&gt;Ask him nicely for a reference that defines bamboo as an 'invasive
&gt;species'   - then watch him fumble....

&gt;See the attached for info on trimming trees.  If you want more info
&gt;on this, see a work by a Dr. Shigo - supposedly THE authority on
&gt;tree trimming in way of power lines.  You can probably get a copy on
&gt;an inter-library loan if Tampa Library system does not have a copy.

&gt;Either you have a 5 or 10 ft easement.  Best that you find out what
&gt;it is instead of listening to some b/s from TECO.

&gt;Kinder's advice on Small Claims Court applies here in FL.  I was all
&gt;set to go that route with Progress Energy until we settled out of
&gt;court.  The guy that came out with the forms for me to sign had a
&gt;truck full of them which tells me he was dealing with a lot of po'd
&gt;customers.  Whatever you do, document it, document , document it;
&gt;take lots of photos of whatever TECO does.

&gt;In general for civil cases, whoever has the best documentation
&gt;wins.  So if you can't dazzlethem with brilliance, baffle them with BS.

&gt;Cheers,

Well Fellow Bamboo Lovers, TECO persons are coming out to my property
Thursday to talk to me.

&quot;The Man&quot; told me he has information for me from two sources which state
bamboo is an invasive species. One of the sources comes from the university
up in Gainesville. He is going to give me the references Thursday.

He also told me he has a 15 foot easement. He has papers to prove it.

So Folks, it looks like I am screwed both ways.they have the right to
totally eradicate a invasive species in/near their power line and now he
tells me he has a 15 foot easement which will take out about half my bamboo
but since its invasive its makes no difference

I hope I can prove that the tree trim crew butchered my oaks trees but I
feel I can't beat &quot;the man&quot;, It will be a sad day when they kill my boo,
it's been there 17 years. All that time tending it watering it mulching it,
to watch it be cut down and poisoned. Very depressing.

Phyllostachys aurea is the only bamboo listed in the Florida Exotic Pest
Plant Council's 2007 list: http://www.fleppc.org/list/07list_ctrfld.pdf . It
is listed as a Category II plant which means it's not yet considered a major
concern. This list is the one that most peope refer to in Florida for
invasive exotics.

The University of Florida has their list
http://plants.ifas.ufl.edu/photos.html and it has Bambusa spp.,
Phyllostachys meyeri, and Pseudosasa japonica specified as invasive plants
in Florida.  I looked at their &quot;data&quot; - they have photos linked from the
three types of bamboo on their list. The photos of their &quot;Bambusa&quot; look
nothing like any Bambusa I've ever seen. It looks like a temperate runner to
me. Maybe someone on this list can offer their opinoin on this mystery
&quot;Bambusa&quot;.
To me, the UF data is flawed and should carry no weight. A student couldn't
identify a subject bamboo so he called it Bambusa ssp. His name is on one of
the photos but it's difficult to read. Looks like V.Rancy or V.Raincy.
Anyway, I'll email the UF Center for Aquatic, Wetland, and Invasive Plants
and request a correction.
Hey, if you have Gigantochloa or Dendrocalamus species, you can always say
they're not on any list!

Just make sure you have that fifteen foot as he
claims. and then tell him you will make sure he
is very busy as you will be driving around the
neighborhood and making records of every place
where there iare plants of any sort encroaching
in that fifteen foot easement. have you seen the
document saying fifteen feet? HAS A LAWYER SEEN IT AND SAYD&lt; yeah?

NO offense, but what the university of Gainsville has to say on the subject is irrelevant.  He needs to show you the law stating that YOUR variety of bamboo is an invasive plant subject to removal.

Sorry you are having to deal with this.  Of course, if you have it cut in such a way that the bamboo cannot touch the wire even in a strong wind, they have no business cutting your plants down.

Bese of luck, let us know how it turns out!

Wirebender-

What does your copy of your survey say?

Let's get technical:  1.  Bamboo is not a species.  What are his references?  He could not tell you over the phone?  Sounds like BS to me.  And as Chris suggested - what law, rule, admin ruling determines what is 'invasive'?

You're screwed when you stop fighting.  We can give you only so much guidance.   What's the worst possible outcome?  TECO cuts the bamboo to ground level and applies a 'poison'.   Make TECO show you that the 'poison' is EPA approved, will have no damaging effect on groundwater, etc.,  (Do any children play in the area?  Is it safe for wildlife, etc, etc.)  Demand to see the Product Data Safety Sheet first.

..and if they do come on your property, get photos - before and after and during.   Get a Video camera and start recording  - it makes people very nervous; get names of workers.   Are they qualfied to apply the 'poison'?  - you don't want any hack dumping 'poison' on your property (even if it is their easement).  In summary, be polite and firm and make life miserable for the suckers.

HE NEEDS TO SHOW YOU THE LAW, but before he shows you the law, you
can go down to your local town house or wherever zoning stuff is
stored, and ASK SOMEBODY TO SEE WHAT THE LAWS ARE ABOUT EASEMENTS
GRANTED TO THE ELECTRIC COMPANY.  frankly at this point, you sound
like you have given up, and are depending upon this schmuck to tell
you to Ben Dover. YOU need to see the law, you do NOT need to listen
to this person's opinion about the law. maybe he is right, I DO NOT
KNOW, but i will bet this law is not strictly enforced. and you can
keep him VERY BUSY.

what is your town. I bet I can go ONLINE and find the easement law on
electrical stuff in your area.

Aye, lads, that was but the beginning of an amateur career in
courtrooms, since bogus lawsuits are the Official State Sport Of
California! And I must say, it is not easy, it is as if you must go
to law school for each CASE. lots of memorizing and you MUST be able
to think on your feet and know the choreography of the courtroom.
Apparently having purple hair and tattoos is not held against you,
DESPITE WHAT EVERYONE ELSE SAID.

But if a person assumes the VICTIM POSITION it will never even make
it to court, he may as well chop down the bamboo himself to save the
goon squad the pleasure of doing it. I am afraid we have a
pre-defeated client here. I know he is SAD, but where is the FIRE IN
HIS BELLY? I am ready to  assault his electrical workers with nothing
more than my knees, elbows and steel toed boots!

Just for the FUN of it! women who weigh about 90 lbs  or less can get
away with this sort of thing. and it is SO MUCH FUN!

I recommend the book KILL OR GET KILLED by Col Rex Applegate. not
kidding about that.
