Hey, Tweety is back in town and to celebrate her return we're going to
take a jaunt up Rte 7 on our trusty road bicycles.  Meet at the
Pontoosuc Dam at 6:30.

The route is TBD, but will likely be either straight out to 5 Corners
and back, or over Brody Mtn Rd to 43 and back 7.  It will all depend
on how everyone's feeling at the start.

Pace will be easy, with the occasional sprint for a town line.

Okay people, just a quick write-up here...

At 6:30 this fine evening, Tweety, Johnny A, New Guy Ed and I mounted our
trusty pedal-steeds and headed north for the mythical 5 Corners.  It started
out as any good ride should, with a bunch of excuses why we might not be
performing at our peak.  There was Tweety who hadn't ridden in two weeks and
was sore from chasing handsome boys around, New Guy Ed who was new to road
cycling and had never ridden with a group before, I was using it as a
recovery ride after a grueling weekend that included Kirchner Rd. (damn you
Kirchners) and a full-paced Josh practice ride.  Johnny A remained quiet
while he ran through our excuses, polishing his battle plan for the Town
Line Sprints.  John, I'm on to you.

Apparently we were all snoozing when we passed the Lanesboro Line, but as we
approached the New Ashford line I briefed New Guy Ed in the sport of Town
Line Sprints.  Despite the complexities of the sport, he seemed to grasp the
basics and unbeknownst to me even adopted his own strategy.  You see, New
Guy Ed said he would simply sit back and watch how things go to see how the
game works.  I mistakenly took that to mean he would sit back and watch to
see how things go, when in reality it meant he was going to let me get just
far enough ahead to think he was out of the picture, then destroy me in a
punishing defeat.

As Tweety made her move on the New Ashford line, I told NGE &quot;Here we go&quot; and
I booked ass.  Playing coy, NGE let me get ahead per his strategy then
executed the remainder of his plan when I was just far enough ahead to
ignore him.  NGE took the line by a good 10 yards, the son of a bitch!

All future attempts to distract and confuse him seemed to only feed my own
false sense of security.  NGE turned out to be a worthy adversary.  For the
record, his tactic seems to be to lull you into a feeling of security by
saying things like &quot;You can have this one, I don't deserve it.&quot; or &quot;I've got
nothing left, this one is yours.'  As your ego swells to the point that your
hearing is impaired, he takes the opportunity to shift up a few and drop the
hammer.  Defeat is yours.

As a humorous aside, Tweety and I were discussing the finer points of
pedaling cadence, and it's effects on performance.  I have been analyzing my
own techniques and have made a few improvements that I believe have helped
my riding.  &quot;Oh yeah, I found that 100 RPM is ideal for powering up hills,
where 85 is a good cruising cadence&quot; I said, basking in my own feeling of
self-importance.  Just then I looked over to see John pedaling effortlessly
at about 6 RPM, cruising up the hill past me.  I guess my theories have some
flaws.

All I have to say is my legs were already tired.  I was using this as a
recovery ride so I wasn't really trying.  New Guy Ed, I guess you ride okay.

Oh yeah, and Tweety narrowly escaped sudden death as yet another oblivion
behind the wheel just pulled right into the road.  But we won't talk about
such things.

Excellent ride everyone!  Is it possible to do a real recovery ride
tomorrow?  And by recover I mean don't ride full out for 15 miles.

Judge Blinky Butt is right, New Guy Ed is dangerous.? I sense a pattern developing here.? Todd convinces someone new to try us out, (remember New Guy Paul?) we're on our best behavior, and wham! they
spank us!? I asked NGE where Todd had found him.? &quot;His cubicle is across from mine.&quot; he said.? He was probably drawn to us after months of listening to Todd chuckling in his cubicle while trading emails back and forth with us.

I had just finished proposing to Johnny A (aka Janny Ulrich, for modeling his cycling style after Jan Ulrich) that we call all new males New Guy (fill in the blank with their name) until such a time as their true name shows itself when NGE pulled his first stunt.? I had done stealth riding for at least 3 miles, feigning fatigue, hanging back 100 meters, and plotting my move for securing the New Ashford town line.? As I pulled out past the boys I heard Blinky Butt say, &quot;There she goes,&quot; and he started his pursuit.? Imagine my surprise when it wasn't Blinky Butt, but NGE who screamed by me seconds later!? When my respiratory rate recovered from the stinging defeat of New Ashford I started yelling, &quot;You go home now, NGE.? You been here too long! GO HOME NEW GUY ED!!&quot;? He didn't.??

At 5 Corners we discussed the pros and cons of the Hoosic River Ride, which sounded really nice until Janny told us it costs $65.? &quot;For what?&quot; I asked.? &quot;What do we get for $65?&quot;??? &quot;The chance to ride with a nice bunch of people,&quot; Janny replied.? Cripes!? All this time we've been riding as a group and we haven't charged anyone for the pleasure of being with us.? I promptly told NGE to cough up $50.? Just Kristie called at this point to tell us that she was about to send her kids out to play in the traffic of the Coltsville intersection while she browsed in Barnes and Noble.? NGE seemed a little perturbed at this, but we assured him that that was a perfectly normal thing for our very own Anna Nicole to do, and filled him in on some of her other child abuse techniques as we? pedaled back to the damn dam.? As we debriefed after the ride who should run into the parking lot, but none other than Just Kristie.? I noticed NGE inching away from her after introductions were made.....

Unable to sleep last night, I poured over ride data while sipping a glass of
warm milk.  That milk was warmed with the tears of my own weakness.  My
mother had stopped answering the phone after the third call, which she ended
by saying &quot;I don't know what you're talking about.  All I can hear is some
whining about town lines and then incessant sobbing.  What's the matter with
you?  I don't like this crowd you've been hanging with.  Are you in a
gang?&quot;  After hours and hours of analysis, here's what I came up with (aside
from the aforementioned excuse about being tired already).

Muscles in the human body contain both fast and slow twitch fibers.  As
their name implies, slow twitch fibers are used for slow movement such as
casual rides and chit chatty runs through the woods.  The fast twitch fibers
are used during quick activities such as Town Line Sprints and swatting
horse flies with a switch a la Nancy Ogle.

Before running or riding with any of you people (I must unfortunately
include myself here), our muscle's natural composition was around 50/50,
allowing us to run long, grueling miles and to sprint to get the last cup of
coffee before that jerk who never makes coffee gets to it leaving you with a
scorched pot.  However, after months, or in some cases years of repeated
abuse, ridicule, brow-beating, debasement and downright injustice at the
hands of our running &quot;friends&quot;, the fast/slow twitch ratio that nature
calibrated for us over eons of evolution has been reduced to what I have
calculated to be 17% fast twitch, 83% slow twitch.

What this means is that we can plod along enduring verbal attacks and still
cover mileage in the double digits, but we lack that zip needed in short
sprints.  This is where New Guy ___ has the advantage.  My theory is that
without any training whatsoever, New Guy ____ could whip us all at our own
game.  But, as New Guy Paul quickly discovered (and didn't share) you can
avoid the negative effects of the debilitating abuse by limiting your
exposure.

I'd like to try this theory out, but I have a little twinge in my weak,
poorly defined calf and it would affect my performance and the resulting
test data.  Plus I stepped on a big crumb and my heel hurts.

New people sprint better than PRC veterans because they haven't been beaten
down emotionally yet.

Yet.

Speaking of that Meteor Shower.... Marco (age 7) said to me last night,
&quot;Momma, last night while I was laying here in bed, I saw outside a flash
of light go fast across the sky.  What was it???&quot;  Being the BEST MOMMA
IN THE WORLD, I replied, &quot;Well Marco, if you had been sleeping like you
were supposed to, you wouldn't have seen the the Aliens flying through
the sky.  They come to Earth to steal little boys like you from their
beds &amp; take them into outer space&quot;.  Then I tucked the little guy into
bed, after reading him a few chapters of the latest Stephen King novel.

&gt; at about 6 RPM, cruising up the hill past me.  I guess my theories have some

&gt; All I have to say is my legs were already tired.  I was using this as a

&gt; Oh yeah, and Tweety narrowly escaped sudden death as yet another oblivion

At 5 Corners we discussed the pros and cons of the Hoosic River Ride, which sounded really nice until Janny told us it costs $65.  &quot;For what?&quot; I asked.  &quot;What do we get for $65?&quot;    &quot;The chance to ride with a nice bunch of people,&quot; Janny replied.  Cripes!  All this time we've been riding as a group and we haven't charged anyone for the pleasure of being with us.  I promptly told NGE to cough up $50.  Just Kristie called at this point to tell us that she was about to send her kids out to play in the traffic of the Coltsville intersection while she browsed in Barnes and Noble.  NGE seemed a little perturbed at this, but we assured him that that was a perfectly normal thing for our very own Anna Nicole to do, and filled him in on some of her other child abuse techniques as we  pedaled back to the damn dam.  As we debriefed after the ride who should run into the parking lot, but none other than Just Kristie.  I noticed NGE inching away from her after introductions were made.....

Okay people, just a quick write-up here...

At 6:30 this fine evening, Tweety, Johnny A, New Guy Ed and I mounted our trusty pedal-steeds and headed north for the mythical 5 Corners.  It started out as any good ride should, with a bunch of excuses why we might not be performing at our peak.  There was Tweety who hadn't ridden in two weeks and was sore from chasing handsome boys around, New Guy Ed who was new to road cycling and had never ridden with a group before, I was using it as a recovery ride after a grueling weekend that included Kirchner Rd. (damn you Kirchners) and a full-paced Josh practice ride.  Johnny A remained quiet while he ran through our excuses, polishing his battle plan for the Town Line Sprints.  John, I'm on to you.

Apparently we were all snoozing when we passed the Lanesboro Line, but as we approached the New Ashford line I briefed New Guy Ed in the sport of Town Line Sprints.  Despite the complexities of the sport, he seemed to grasp the basics and unbeknownst to me even adopted his own strategy.  You see, New Guy Ed said he would simply sit back and watch how things go to see how the game works.  I mistakenly took that to mean he would sit back and watch to see how things go, when in reality it meant he was going to let me get just far enough ahead to think he was out of the picture, then destroy me in a punishing defeat.

As Tweety made her move on the New Ashford line, I told NGE &quot;Here we go&quot; and I booked ass.  Playing coy, NGE let me get ahead per his strategy then executed the remainder of his plan when I was just far enough ahead to ignore him.  NGE took the line by a good 10 yards, the son of a bitch!

All future attempts to distract and confuse him seemed to only feed my own false sense of security.  NGE turned out to be a worthy adversary.  For the record, his tactic seems to be to lull you into a feeling of security by saying things like &quot;You can have this one, I don't deserve it.&quot; or &quot;I've got nothing left, this one is yours.'  As your ego swells to the point that your hearing is impaired, he takes the opportunity to shift up a few and drop the hammer.  Defeat is yours.

Unable to sleep last night, I poured over ride data while sipping a glass of warm milk.  That milk was warmed with the tears of my own weakness.  My mother had stopped answering the phone after the third call, which she ended by saying &quot;I don't know what you're talking about.  All I can hear is some whining about town lines and then incessant sobbing.  What's the matter with you?  I don't like this crowd you've been hanging with.  Are you in a gang?&quot;  After hours and hours of analysis, here's what I came up with (aside from the aforementioned excuse about being tired already).

Muscles in the human body contain both fast and slow twitch fibers.  As their name implies, slow twitch fibers are used for slow movement such as casual rides and chit chatty runs through the woods.  The fast twitch fibers are used during quick activities such as Town Line Sprints and swatting horse flies with a switch a la Nancy Ogle.

Before running or riding with any of you people (I must unfortunately include myself here), our muscle's natural composition was around 50/50, allowing us to run long, grueling miles and to sprint to get the last cup of coffee before that jerk who never makes coffee gets to it leaving you with a scorched pot.  However, after months, or in some cases years of repeated abuse, ridicule, brow-beating, debasement and downright injustice at the hands of our running &quot;friends&quot;, the fast/slow twitch ratio that nature calibrated for us over eons of evolution has been reduced to what I have calculated to be 17% fast twitch, 83% slow twitch.

What this means is that we can plod along enduring verbal attacks and still cover mileage in the double digits, but we lack that zip needed in short sprints.  This is where New Guy ___ has the advantage.  My theory is that without any training whatsoever, New Guy ____ could whip us all at our own game.  But, as New Guy Paul quickly discovered (and didn't share) you can avoid the negative effects of the debilitating abuse by limiting your exposure.

I'd like to try this theory out, but I have a little twinge in my weak, poorly defined calf and it would affect my performance and the resulting test data.  Plus I stepped on a big crumb and my heel hurts.

Yeah I think it has something to do with my fast twitch/slow twitch ratio, but I'm not sure. I will have to consult with the Judge on this as well.

A. Do we have to watch our language around soon-to-be-mom-again-Spanky?  I
don't know the etiquette on that shit.  Dammit!
2. In my spare time, I tracked New Guy Paul down at Trader Joe's in Hadley
last weekend.  We spoke of a ride, but it never happened.  I blame my
unstructured weekend schedule for not being able to give proper notice
before I rode.  Perhaps this weekend.
0011. Paul, wanna pick a day so we can get you back to break your spirit?
Please lower your tire pressure to 8 PSI to give everyone else a sporting
chance.  You may increase your rear tire pressure to 16 PSI, but you'll have
to leave the front tire at home.  Either option is acceptable.

&gt; are used during quick activities such as Town Line Sprints and swatting
&gt; horse flies with a switch a la Nancy Ogle.

&gt; Before running or riding with any of you people (I must unfortunately
&gt; include myself here), our muscle's natural composition was around 50/50,
&gt; allowing us to run long, grueling miles and to sprint to get the last cup of
&gt; coffee before that jerk who never makes coffee gets to it leaving you with a
&gt; scorched pot.  However, after months, or in some cases years of repeated
&gt; abuse, ridicule, brow-beating, debasement and downright injustice at the
&gt; hands of our running &quot;friends&quot;, the fast/slow twitch ratio that nature
&gt; calibrated for us over eons of evolution has been reduced to what I have
&gt; calculated to be 17% fast twitch, 83% slow twitch.

&gt; What this means is that we can plod along enduring verbal attacks and
&gt; still cover mileage in the double digits, but we lack that zip needed in
&gt; short sprints.  This is where New Guy ___ has the advantage.  My theory is
&gt; that without any training whatsoever, New Guy ____ could whip us all at our
&gt; own game.  But, as New Guy Paul quickly discovered (and didn't share) you
&gt; can avoid the negative effects of the debilitating abuse by limiting your
&gt; exposure.

&gt; I'd like to try this theory out, but I have a little twinge in my weak,
&gt; poorly defined calf and it would affect my performance and the resulting
&gt; test data.  Plus I stepped on a big crumb and my heel hurts.

A. Do we have to watch our language around soon-to-be-mom-again-Spanky?? I don't know the etiquette on that shit.? Dammit!
2. In my spare time, I tracked New Guy Paul down at Trader Joe's in Hadley last weekend.? We spoke of a ride, but it never happened.? I blame my unstructured weekend schedule for not being able to give proper notice before I rode.? Perhaps this weekend.

0011. Paul, wanna pick a day so we can get you back to break your spirit?? Please lower your tire pressure to 8 PSI to give everyone else a sporting chance.? You may increase your rear tire pressure to 16 PSI, but you'll have to leave the front tire at home.? Either option is acceptable.
