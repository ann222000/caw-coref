YouTube row over social services baby threat

Ben Leapman, Home Affairs Correspondent, Sunday Telegraph
Last Updated: 4:01am BST 20/08/2007

A heavily pregnant woman is at the centre of an extraordinary legal
battle with social workers after she secretly recorded them
threatening to take away her newborn baby.

YouTube AUDIO: THE SECRET RECORDING
http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=2IaxSsD8zog

Vanessa Brookes, 34, who is due to give birth early next month,
smuggled taping equipment into a meeting with social services
officials, fearing they would try to take her baby for forced
adoption.

She recorded a social worker telling her and her husband Martin, 41,
that even though there was &quot;no immediate risk to your child from
yourselves&quot;, the council would seek a court order to place the child
in foster care.

Mother and baby would be allowed &quot;two or three days&quot; in hospital
together, but should not leave the premises until social workers came
to remove the infant. In a desperate attempt to keep their baby, the
couple have published the recorded conversation on the internet.

Calderdale council, in West Yorkshire, last night accused them of
breaching the Data Protection Act by recording its staff without their
knowledge or consent. The council said it had begun legal action to
have the recording removed from the YouTube website. Mrs Brookes said:
&quot;Even puppies and kittens aren't removed from their mothers at birth.
Social workers always record everything, so why shouldn't we record
them?&quot;

John Hemming, the Liberal Democrat MP and chairman of campaign group
Justice for Families, said: &quot;I find it very odd that a newborn baby
would be removed when there is not any allegation by the authorities
that the child is at risk. Yet this case is not unique. There are many
cases in which newborns are removed because of allegations that their
mothers may at some later stage 'emotionally abuse' the child.&quot;

The case returns the spotlight to claims that social services are
being heavy-handed in removing children from their parents, in order
to meet Government adoption targets.

The Sunday Telegraph has previously revealed cases of mothers who were
not told why their children were taken away, and cases of families
whose children were not returned even after the parents had been
cleared of wrongdoing. More than 2,000 babies aged under a year were
taken for adoption last year, almost triple the level of a decade ago.

Social services took an interest in the Brookes family after Mrs
Brookes, who is partially-sighted, was diagnosed with depression and a
personality disorder, leading to concerns that her baby might be
subjected to &quot;emotional abuse&quot;. Neighbours have complained that the
couple's household was disorderly, but neither has been accused of
abusing or harming a child.

In the recorded meeting, the social worker tells the couple: &quot;It's our
intention as a local authority that when your baby is born, we go into
court on that same day and ask for an interim court order because we
would wish to place your baby with foster carers.&quot;

He tells Mrs Brookes: &quot;I would like you and your baby to stay in
hospital until the courts have made a decision.&quot;

The social worker says the two or three days the mother has with her
baby in hospital will allow her to begin breast-feeding and that once
the infant is taken away, social services will pick up expressed
breast milk from her home and deliver it to the foster carers for
bottle-feeding.

The social worker admits to the couple that a back-up plan is being
drawn up in case the judge refuses the application for a care order.
He says: &quot;What we also have to think about is a child protection plan
that looks at you, at home, with your baby. There is no immediate risk
to your child from yourselves, that's my understanding from reading
documents.&quot;

A spokesman for Calderdale council said officials would seek a meeting
with Mr and Mrs Brookes &quot;to understand how this information came into
the public domain. We are taking action to have this item removed from
YouTube. This recording was made without the knowledge or consent of
our member of staff.

&quot;The council does not take lightly any recommendation to the court for
a child or a baby to be brought into care. The decision whether or not
to institute care proceedings is made by social workers who have to
consider the best interests of the child.&quot;

Threat to take new-born over emotional abuse

By David Harrison, Sunday Telegraph
Last Updated: 1:42am BST 26/08/2007

A pregnant woman has been told that her baby will be taken from her at
birth because she is deemed capable of &quot;emotional abuse&quot;, even though
psychiatrists treating her say there is no evidence to suggest that
she will harm her child in any way.
# Leader: Unnatural justice of secret courts
# More use of a vague reason to remove children

Social services' recommendation that the baby should be taken from
Fran Lyon, a 22-year-old charity worker who has five A-levels and a
degree in neuroscience, was based in part on a letter from a
paediatrician she has never met.
advertisement

Hexham children's services, part of Northumberland County Council,
said the decision had been made because Miss Lyon was likely to suffer
from Munchausen's Syndrome by proxy, a condition unproven by science
in which a mother will make up an illness in her child, or harm it, to
draw attention to herself.

Under the plan, a doctor will hand the newborn to a social worker,
provided there are no medical complications. Social services' request
for an emergency protection order - these are usually granted - will
be heard in secret in the family court at Hexham magistrates on the
same day.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From then on, anyone discussing the case, including Miss Lyon, will be
">

deemed to be in contempt of the court.

Miss Lyon, from Hexham, who is five months pregnant, is seeking a
judicial review of the decision about Molly, as she calls her baby.
She described it as &quot;barbaric and draconian&quot;, and said it was
&quot;scandalous&quot; that social services had not accepted submissions
supporting her case.

&quot;The paediatrician has never met me,&quot; she said. &quot;He is not a
psychiatrist and cannot possibly make assertions about my current or
future mental health. Yet his letter was the only one considered in
the case conference on August 16 which lasted just 10 minutes.&quot;

Northumberland County Council insists that two highly experienced
doctors - another consultant paediatrician and a medical consultant -
attended the case conference.

The case adds to growing concern, highlighted in a series of articles
in The Sunday Telegraph, over a huge rise in the number of babies
under a year old being taken from parents. The figure was 2,000 last
year, three times the number 10 years ago.

Critics say councils are taking more babies from parents to help them
meet adoption &quot;targets&quot;.

John Hemming, the Liberal Democrat MP and chairman of the Justice for
Families campaign group, said the case showed &quot;exactly what is wrong
with public family law&quot;.

He added: &quot;There is absolutely no evidence that Fran would harm her
child. However, a vague letter from a paediatrician who has never met
her has been used in a decision to remove her baby at birth, while
evidence from professionals treating her, that she would have no
problems has been ignored.&quot;

Mr Hemming was concerned that &quot;vague assertions&quot; of Munchausen's
Syndrome by proxy - now known as &quot;fabricated and invented illness&quot; -
had been used to remove a number of children from parents in the North-
East.

Miss Lyon came under scrutiny because she had a mental health problem
when she was 16 after being physically and emotionally abused by her
father and raped by a stranger.

She suffered eating disorders and self-harm but, after therapy,
graduated from Edinburgh University and now works for two mental
health charities, Borderline and Personality Plus.

Dr Stella Newrith, a consultant psychiatrist, who treated Miss Lyon
for her childhood trauma for a year, wrote to Northumberland social
services stating: &quot;There has never been any clinical evidence to
suggest that Fran would put herself or others at risk, and there is
certainly no evidence to suggest that she would put a child at risk of
emotional, physical or sexual harm.&quot;

Despite this support, endorsed by other psychiatrists and Miss Lyon's
GP, social services based their recommendation partly on a letter from
Dr Martin Ward Platt, a consultant paediatrician, who was unable to
attend the meeting.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
He wrote: &quot;Even in the absence of a psychological assessment, if the
">

professionals were concerned on the evidence available that Miss
Holton (as Miss Lyon was briefly known), probably does fabricate or
induce illness, there would be no option but the precautionary
principle of taking the baby into foster care at birth, pending a post-
natal forensic psychological assessment.&quot;

Miss Lyon said she was determined to fight the decision. &quot;I know I can
be a good mother to Molly. I just want the chance to prove it,&quot; she
said.

The council said the recommendation would be subject to further
assessment and review. &quot;When making such difficult decisions,
safeguarding children is our foremost priority,&quot; a spokesman said.

· A recording of social workers threatening to take a newborn into
care has been removed from the YouTube website after Calderdale
Council in West Yorkshire started legal action, claiming the Data
Protection Act was breached.

Vanessa Brookes, 34, taped social workers telling her and her husband
that they would seek to place the baby, due next month, in care, while
admitting there was &quot;no immediate risk to the child.&quot;

some muddle-headed berk seems to have decided is a fundamental human

&gt; John Hemming, the Liberal Democrat MP and chairman of the Justice for
&gt; Families campaign group, said the case showed &quot;exactly what is wrong
&gt; with public family law&quot;.

&gt; He added: &quot;There is absolutely no evidence that Fran would harm her
&gt; child. However, a vague letter from a paediatrician who has never met
&gt; her has been used in a decision to remove her baby at birth, while
&gt; evidence from professionals treating her, that she would have no
&gt; problems has been ignored.&quot;

&gt; Mr Hemming was concerned that &quot;vague assertions&quot; of Munchausen's
&gt; Syndrome by proxy - now known as &quot;fabricated and invented illness&quot; -
&gt; had been used to remove a number of children from parents in the North-
&gt; East.

Shouldn't that court-condoned baby-snatching be stopped immediately
and those responsible for it be gaoled?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Miss Lyon came under scrutiny because she had a mental health problem
&gt; when she was 16 after being physically and emotionally abused by her
&gt; father and raped by a stranger.

&gt; She suffered eating disorders and self-harm but, after therapy,
&gt; graduated from Edinburgh University and now works for two mental
&gt; health charities, Borderline and Personality Plus.

&gt; Dr Stella Newrith, a consultant psychiatrist, who treated Miss Lyon
&gt; for her childhood trauma for a year, wrote to Northumberland social
&gt; services stating: &quot;There has never been any clinical evidence to
&gt; suggest that Fran would put herself or others at risk, and there is
&gt; certainly no evidence to suggest that she would put a child at risk of
&gt; emotional, physical or sexual harm.&quot;

&gt; Despite this support, endorsed by other psychiatrists and Miss Lyon's
&gt; GP, social services based their recommendation partly on a letter from
&gt; Dr Martin Ward Platt, a consultant paediatrician, who was unable to
&gt; attend the meeting.

&gt; He wrote: &quot;Even in the absence of a psychological assessment, if the
&gt; professionals were concerned on the evidence available that Miss
&gt; Holton (as Miss Lyon was briefly known), probably does fabricate or
&gt; induce illness, there would be no option but the precautionary
&gt; principle of taking the baby into foster care at birth, pending a post-
&gt; natal forensic psychological assessment.&quot;
">

A Platt by name and, it seems, a pratt by nature, he has followed the
lead given by &quot;Sir&quot; Roy Meadows and not only provided an assessment of
someone he has never met, his assessment is that of a psychiatrist
which he patently is not.

One might wonder which was in greater need of &quot;forensic psychological
assessment&quot; - the mother or those quacks^W &quot;learned experts&quot; who would
sit in judgement of someone they have never even seen.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The council said the recommendation would be subject to further

And that makes everything hunky-dory, does it?

Why is it that these glib, smug, smarmy and thoroughly irritating
spokesmen never seem to have names?

Is that so their families are not accosted in the street and asked if
they are proud to be related to the rent-a-gob for such an evil
system?

This sort of abuse rarely ensares those educated and rich enough to fight
back. The best advice in this case (the mother-to-be is only 5 months
pregnant, I think) would be secret flight to Canada, the USA or Ireland,
three countries where the infant would be afforded nationality by jus soli
(in Ireland assuming that one parent is British ore Irish; in the other
countries regardless of their nationality). In Ireland the whole family
would have EU rights in addition to Irish ones and the threat of a referral
to the Luxembourg court might keep the Council off the case.

Such a child could not be repatriated involuntarily; and the longer the
child lives with -- and is bonded to -- his biological parents the harder it
would be for the Council to do anything even if they return.

But the strategy to use depends on facts we don't know. Publicity is good;
trying to fight the Council on their own turf in secret courts is a losing
proposition.

If you're not commenting, then why did you post?

I'd like you to explain why Meadows shredded his MBP research.
Such &quot;historical, ground breaking research&quot; usually gets
enshrined in a university library or museum, not SHREDDED!

Recently there has been a fuss in the USA about recording
Police Officers breaking the same laws they enforce on others.
A high court has ruled strongly that Government agents
in the performance of their duties have no reasonable
expectation of privacy.   The value of such recordings to
obtain better performance of government agents is compelling.
I have been making that same argument about
Child Protection caseworkers for quite some time.

Caseworkers and the lower courts often succeed
in silencing web sites and recordings like that
using the extortive nature of the situation.

The Child Protection INDUSTRY literature actually
justifies removal of children for the PURPOSE of
obtaining compliance from the parents.
In other words, they remove less for the legally
required &quot;imminent danger&quot; and more to extort
the parents into submitting to invasive demands
from the caseworkers.

But the much touted Bill Of Rights portion of our
Constitution is bypassed in Child Protection courts
using the rationale that the parent doesn't get
those rights because they are not facing jail or prison.
They only want your kids!

Most attorneys don't even get that far, and often
if they do the argument ends there.

But a good attorney would argue that the removal
or potential removal of a child is a LIBERTY INTEREST
even MORE compelling than that presented by
potential jail or prison.   Yes, a huge dose of
legal &quot;&quot;sophistry&quot;&quot; is used to basically defraud
US Citizens of rights that are protected and &quot;guaranteed&quot;.

(See caselaw US Santosky v. Kramer)
Burden of Proof standard (Preponderance 51% v Clear and Convincing
80%)
Rules of Evidence
Right to confront accuser in court
Unreasonable search and seizure
Right to a Jury trial

I used to think that our system in the USA protected
us better from BUREAUCRATIC AGENCY abuse
than yours in the UK.   Ordinary citizens in the USA
who cannot hire a legal &quot;dream team&quot; are routinely
being defrauded of &quot;&quot;guarantees&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;protections&quot;&quot;
that our system declares.

Parents with attorneys who are less than aggressive
(normal) are being ripped off ROUTINELY in our
courts that serve the Child Protection INDUSTRY.

Somebody here started going around to Police
Stations and asking for official complaint forms.

They discovered that at many Police stations
a person in charge tries to handle it verbally,
sometimes to talk the person out of filing a
complaint and in several cases they got
downright threatening to the reporter who was
asking for the complaint forms.

Mullally did work on a law suit having to do with
the LA Police.   He discovered that large numbers
of Domestic Violence charges against officers
had been dead ended within the Police stations.
A high court Judge ordered him to be silent,
under threat of prison.
He decided it was just too wrong to allow it to be
buried, made it public and did prison time.
His was the only prosecution in the whole huge case.

The FBI tried to keep a report from getting out
a few years ago.   Congress forced them to pony up.
It was a report about the incredible numbers of
agents who had committed a whole array of serious crimes.

The Police in my area actually removed completely
working squad car video recording systems.
It seems that when they catch the officers doing
something bad or wrong, the law suit payouts can
cost the city too.  I wonder if the city's insurance
underwriter advised them to remove the squad car camera
systems?

But to get back to Child Protection caseworkers,
they seem to be absolutely TERRIFIED of being
caught on tape!  Some seem incapable of opening
their mouth for more than a few minutes without
telling a lie.

I personally cross examined several caseworkers
and caught them dead to rights telling lies in court.
The court room was so severely air conditioned
that I was almost turning blue, but the caseworkers
I nailed turned pink or red on the witness stand.
Their lies were obvious and incredibly stupid!
One caseworker had abused us with the &quot;silent treatment&quot;.
Said he didn't answer e-mail questions because they
were irrational.  Confronted with the e-mails
he tried answering with a sort of filibuster, a speech
that never answered the question.  Asked again
he crumbled, admitted nothing in them was irrational.

Another caseworker said that I had sent her an
e-mail threatening that if she showed up at
my door I was going to roll her up in a rug.
(As in dead body)
Miraculously she could not explain why there
had never been any mention of this an any
of their quarterly reports on the case, or that
no copy of it had been entered into evidence.
Asked to produce it, she could not.

The Judge was very friendly to them, but even
he had to roll his eyes about that one!
(body language for &quot;Oh Brother!&quot; )

I asked the Judge if this e-mail could be
produced and said I'd like to see that e-mail.
He said &quot;I bet you would!&quot;.

I had of course never sent such an e-mail.

To me, this incident showed just how
MALICIOUS this caseworker really was.
A tape recording of her on the telephone reinforced that for the
Judge.

In Iowa, anybody can record anybody on the phone
as long as one party knows.  No warning or beep is required.

They bluff most people out of recording face to face.

I am glad to see now that US high courts have said that
government agents have no expectation of privacy
while performing their job.

Theoretically, even in states that don't have liberal
recording laws, people would have a right to
record government agents in the performance of their duty,
state recording restrictions would not apply.

But lower courts might still try to apply restrictions in error.

NEWS RELEASE
Fairfax VA. Wednesday, July 03, 2007

A complaint has been filed with the Department of Family Services for
the dismissal of CPS social worker Ms. Shannon Traore and her boss
Elizabeth Spell of the Fairfax Department of Family Services. Also
filed was a request to investigate all cases of abuse in which Ms.
Traore has been involved in.

Ms. Traore has been caught on audio tape leading two young children
aged 5 &amp; 7 years to state physical &amp; sexual abuse allegations against
their father. Using those coached testimony Ms. Traore helped kick
off
a criminal and civil campaign against the father.

When asked what happened to the tapes from the coached interviews,
Ms. Traore claims there were audio failure. Well, Did she record
subsequent interviews? No. claims Ms. Traore.  In a recovered audio
tape interview Ms Traore starts off the second interview by
suggesting
to the child to think of the reasons why she does not like going to
her dads, and how if has her dad touched her in the bikini area,
those
are bad touches, The child repeatedly states to Ms. Traore during the
interview that it was in the bath tub when she was 3 years of age and
daddy was giving the a bath. ( Dad was the sole custodian of the
children).

Ms. Traore of Fairfax County, Virginia filed a Temporary protective
order in November of 2006 used in a Juvenile court case that she
&quot;knew
or reasonably should have known were false or at the very least
questionable&quot; and that the report would mislead a Judge Clayton into
making a decision in the case, according to court records obtained by
this reporter. Read More...  How Fairfax County CPS Social Worker

In an audio tape obtained from the CPS, Social worker Ms Traore is

http://virginiachildabuse.com/jerry.html

Is Gerry Connolly Chairman, Fairfax County Board of Supervisors a
Child Abuser?  Is he a Sexual Abuser. Did he Sexually Abuse his
Daughter Caitlin Connolly?

According to Fairfax County Child Protective Services Social Worker
Ms. Shannon Traore who investigated several people for child abuse,
She has found by a preponderance of evidence among many that the
Chairman of the Board of Supervisor Mr. Gerry Connolly to have
sexually abused his daughter Caitlin Connolly. Her boss Elizebeth
Spell at CPS seems to agree with her.

Why would she find Gerry or for that matter any other prominent
citizens to be child abusers? How did the Child Protective Services
come to this conclusion? Is this Social worker a sick pervert, Is she
out of her mind? How is it possible for a prominent and outstanding
citizen of Fairfax county, a loving father of Caitlin Connolly to be
found to have sexually abused his own daughter.   Well, Gerry Connolly
had touched his daughter's genitals and her bikini area in the bath
tub when she was three years old while giving her a bath. And those
are bad touches... And our chairman becomes a pervert and a
pedophile..Parents should not be doing bad touches.... and according
to CPS social worker Ms. Shannon Traore those people are guilty of
sexually abusing their children. Parents are not allowed to touch
their children in their genital area while giving them a bath. By this
definition this Social worker becomes the thought police finding
anyone in Fairfax County to be Sexual Abusers. Her target mostly are
fathers in child custody situations.

Please listen to the following audio recording before reading

picture1 - social worker Ms. Traore used this picture as evidence to
prevent a parent from having contact with his daughter. This is the
most dammning evidence of physical abuse of the child that she could
get. - She was preventing anyone from accessing this photo as
evidence.

Picture 2 - This is the next damming picture of physical abuse.

Social Worker refused to talk with Credible Witnesses who have seen
the children on the day that she claims the children were abused.

COVER- Saving Sarah: Satan worship, sex abuse, and Dr. Martin Stein

Published October 16, 2003 in issue #0241 of The Hook

By COURTENEY STUART STU ... @READTHEHOOK.COM

The little girl's memories were vivid and horrifying: being raped by
her father at age two, watching her father and stepmother bury animals
alive in satanic rituals, and seeing babies boiling in a cauldron
while adults stirred the pot. But were they true?

The Albemarle County Department of Social Services believed enough of
them to rule against her father and put his name in the central
registry of child abusers. While the child was clearly tortured by
those memories, she wasn't the only one in pain. Today, that little
girl's father, Tom Manuel, and his wife, Kathleen, know firsthand what
hell is like, but it's not because they worship Satan. They say the
instrument of their suffering resides right here on earth and goes by
the name Dr. Martin Stein.

The trouble starts

Tom Manuel remembers exactly when his nightmare began:  three days
before he was due to pick up his then-12-year-old daughter, Sarah, for
Christmas vacation. With no warning, Tom and his new wife, Kathleen,
received a letter from his ex-wife's attorney denying them all
visitation with Sarah. For months, Tom and Kathleen-- whose son, Jack,
was then just seven months old-- fought to learn why his visits had
been terminated. In April 1994, they got a terrifying answer: Sarah
had memories of the couple participating in grotesque satanic rituals.
Even worse, she claimed her father had sexually abused her from her
earliest years.

Three-year-old Sarah, years before the trouble started.

Things hadn't always been bad between Sarah and her father, however.

Tom and Sarah's mother divorced when Sarah was four, but for two years
all three continued to reside in Charlottesville. Tom and Sarah, by
both of their accounts, continued to enjoy a close relationship and
did so for several years after the divorce, even after Sarah and her
mother moved out of town.

Sarah, now a woman finishing college in northern Virginia, says the
serious problems began after her mother remarried.

Sarah became depressed and her mother sought psychiatric treatment for
her. At age 10, Sarah was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder
and soon after was hospitalized for an emotional disturbance. Though
her mother divorced her second husband, Sarah's troubles weren't
over.

When Sarah was released from inpatient treatment at Dominion Hospital
in Falls Church, her mother, Susan Jones, switched her daughter's
treatment to Martin Stein, a well known psychiatrist who, according to
the Virginia Board of Medicine's records, has a medical degree from
Yale.

&gt; NEWS RELEASE
&gt; Fairfax VA. Wednesday, July 03, 2007

&gt; A complaint has been filed with the Department of FamilyServicesfor
&gt; the dismissal of CPSsocialworker Ms. Shannon Traore and her boss
&gt; Elizabeth Spell of the Fairfax Department of FamilyServices. Also
&gt; filed was a request to investigate all cases of abuse in which Ms.
&gt; Traore has been involved in.

&gt;  Ms. Traore has been caught on audio tape leading two young children
&gt; aged 5 &amp; 7 years to state physical &amp; sexual abuse allegations against
&gt; their father. Using those coached testimony Ms. Traore helped kick
&gt; off
&gt; a criminal and civil campaign against the father.

&gt;  When asked what happened to the tapes from the coached interviews,
&gt; Ms. Traore claims there were audio failure. Well, Did she record
&gt; subsequent interviews? No. claims Ms. Traore.  In a recovered audio
&gt; tape interview Ms Traore starts off the second interview by
&gt; suggesting
&gt; to the child to think of the reasons why she does not like going to
&gt; her dads, and how if has her dad touched her in the bikini area,
&gt; those
&gt; are bad touches, The child repeatedly states to Ms. Traore during the
&gt; interview that it was in the bath tub when she was 3 years of age and
&gt; daddy was giving the a bath. ( Dad was the sole custodian of the
&gt; children).

&gt; Ms. Traore of Fairfax County, Virginia filed a Temporary protective
&gt; order in November of 2006 used in a Juvenile court case that she
&gt; &quot;knew
&gt; or reasonably should have known were false or at the very least
&gt; questionable&quot; and that the report would mislead a Judge Clayton into
&gt; making a decision in the case, according to court records obtained by
&gt; this reporter. Read More...  How Fairfax County CPSSocialWorker
&gt; fabricated child abuse.

&gt; In an audio tape obtained from the CPS,Socialworker Ms Traore is
&gt; heard coaching and asking leading questions

&gt; http://virginiachildabuse.com/jerry.html

&gt; Is Gerry Connolly Chairman, Fairfax County Board of Supervisors a
&gt; Child Abuser?  Is he a Sexual Abuser. Did he Sexually Abuse his
&gt; Daughter Caitlin Connolly?

&gt;   According to Fairfax County Child ProtectiveServicesSocialWorker
&gt; Ms. Shannon Traore who investigated several people for child abuse,
&gt; She has found by a preponderance of evidence among many that the
&gt; Chairman of the Board of Supervisor Mr. Gerry Connolly to have
&gt; sexually abused his daughter Caitlin Connolly. Her boss Elizebeth
&gt; Spell at CPS seems to agree with her.

&gt; Why would she find Gerry or for that matter any other prominent
&gt; citizens to be child abusers? How did the Child ProtectiveServices
&gt; come to this conclusion? Is thisSocialworker a sick pervert, Is she
&gt; out of her mind? How is it possible for a prominent and outstanding
&gt; citizen of Fairfax county, a loving father of Caitlin Connolly to be
&gt; found to have sexually abused his own daughter.   Well, Gerry Connolly
&gt; had touched his daughter's genitals and her bikini area in the bath
&gt; tub when she was three years old while giving her a bath. And those
&gt; are bad touches... And our chairman becomes a pervert and a
&gt; pedophile..Parents should not be doing bad touches.... and according
&gt; to CPSsocialworker Ms. Shannon Traore those people are guilty of
&gt; sexually abusing their children. Parents are not allowed to touch
&gt; their children in their genital area while giving them a bath. By this
&gt; definition thisSocialworker becomes the thought police finding
&gt; anyone in Fairfax County to be Sexual Abusers. Her target mostly are
&gt; fathers in child custody situations.

&gt; Please listen to the following audio recording before reading
&gt; further :

&gt; Interview of a 5 year old girl by CPS worker Ms. Shannon Traore

&gt; Interview of a 7 Year old girl  by the CPS Ms.  Shannon Traore.

&gt; Continuation...... 5 year old interview by Ms. Traore.

&gt; picture1 -socialworker Ms. Traore used this picture as evidence to
&gt; prevent a parent from having contact with his daughter. This is the
&gt; most dammning evidence of physical abuse of the child that she could
&gt; get. - She was preventing anyone from accessing this photo as
&gt; evidence.

&gt; Picture 2 - This is the next damming picture of physical abuse.

&gt; SocialWorker refused to talk with Credible Witnesses who have seen
&gt; the children on the day that she claims the children were abused.

&gt; COVER- Saving Sarah: Satan worship, sex abuse, and Dr. Martin Stein

&gt; Published October 16, 2003 in issue #0241 of The Hook

&gt; By COURTENEY STUART STU ... @READTHEHOOK.COM

&gt; The little girl's memories were vivid and horrifying: being raped by
&gt; her father at age two, watching her father and stepmother bury animals
&gt; alive in satanic rituals, and seeing babies boiling in a cauldron
&gt; while adults stirred the pot. But were they true?

&gt; The Albemarle County Department ofSocialServicesbelieved enough of
&gt; them to rule against her father and put his name in the central
&gt; registry of child abusers. While the child was clearly tortured by
&gt; those memories, she wasn't the only one in pain. Today, that little
&gt; girl's father, Tom Manuel, and his wife, Kathleen, know firsthand what
&gt; hell is like, but it's not because they worship Satan. They say the
&gt; instrument of their suffering resides right here on earth and goes by
&gt; the name Dr. Martin Stein.

Guilty of child abuse! (Well, our version.)
Camilla Cavendish
For a brief time this week, until it was taken down, there was an
extraordinary posting on YouTube. It was a covert recording, made by
a
34-year-old mother, of her meeting with the social worker who wants
to
take her next baby into care.

Had it been staged, critics would have called it a caricature. A
robotic official orders the sobbing mother to stay in the hospital
until his colleagues come to remove her new baby. He refuses her
desperate pleas to be monitored with the baby at home. He explains in
the tones of a traffic warden the inconvenience of delivering her
breast milk. He then lets drop an astonishing admission: that
Calderdale Council is pursuing a court order despite there being &quot;no
immediate risk to your child from yourselves&quot;. Will he say that in
court? We will not know, of course, for the court will sit in secret.

Such a chilling drama plays to our deepest fears of state tyranny.
There is something wrong with the system. But posting a conversation
on YouTube, out of context, is not the way to right it. The council
argues that Vanessa Brookes's recording falls foul of the Data
Protection Act. Her supporters say that she is a victim of social
services and justified in publishing what is essentially her own
data.
But we do not know whether she is a victim. Who is abusing whom here?

Mrs Brookes's case is not straightforward. She is partially sighted
and has suffered bouts of depression. Two of her children have
already
been adopted. That does not prove that she is an unfit mother -
mistakes can be made - but it does explain the council's interest.
Equally, I am told that she and her husband have never been accused
of
harming any child. But this dribble of incomplete facts is
fundamentally unenlightening. All it does is illustrate the torturous
trade-offs that the system has to make, and our inability to judge
those trade-offs because it is illegal to read family court papers.

How should we treat someone like Mrs Brookes, who has troubles enough
to worry social services but has not apparently yet harmed a child?
She is one of a growing group of people who are categorised as
capable
of &quot;emotional abuse&quot;. You can see why the category exists. Ill-
treatment comes in many forms, not just cigarette burns. But in that
nebulous phrase lurks the potential for great injustice.

&quot;Emotional abuse&quot; has no strict definition in British law. Yet it now
accounts for an astounding 21 per cent of all children registered as
needing protection, up from 14 per cent in 1997. Last year 6,700
children were put on the child protection register for emotional
abuse, compared with only 2,600 for sexual abuse and 5,100 for
physical abuse. Both of the latter two categories have been falling
steadily. Meanwhile emotional abuse and &quot;neglect&quot; - which replaced
the
old notion of &quot;grave concern&quot; in 1989 - have been rising. Both are
catch-alls. But emotional abuse is especially vague. It covers
children who have not been injured, have not complained, and do not
come under &quot;emotional neglect&quot;.

The Department of Health defines emotional abuse as &quot;persistent
emotional ill-treatment . . . [which] may involve conveying to
children that they are worthless or inadequate . . . and may feature
age or developmentally inappropriate expectations being placed on
children . . . Some level of emotional abuse is involved in all types
of ill-treatment of a child, though it may occur alone&quot;.

Local authorities have printed their own, wildly differing,
interpretations. In Enfield emotional abuse includes &quot;swearing&quot;,
&quot;conditional love&quot; or &quot;discriminatory remarks&quot;. In Nottingham, it is
&quot;an ingrained pattern of interaction . . . which it is essential to
observe and understand over time&quot;. Under that definition, a baby
could
never be removed at birth. Nottingham also states that emotional
abuse
should rarely be a cause for removing a child. Meanwhile the NSPCC,
the charity that has never knowingly undersold a statistic, states in
its briefing on emotional abuse that &quot;18 per cent of children
experience humiliation and/or attacks on self-esteem&quot;. Should we put
them all in care, then?

&quot;You'll know it when you see it - except that you can't see it&quot; is no
way to make law. Abuse literature repeatedly states how often parent
and child are unaware of the damage done by their relationship
patterns. How do we weigh that damage against the trauma of the
conveyor belt of foster care? In most such situations, isn't removing
a child utterly disproportionate?

Just imagine that some social services departments were crusaders,
seeing evil parents everywhere but unable to prove conventional
abuse.
It is plausible that the number of vague allegations would rise,
backed by psychiatrists of a similar mindset who are prepared to
enter
a &quot;maybe&quot;. How else can one explain a 50 per cent rise in emotional
abuse cases in ten years? How many of those cases are utterly
marginal?

Next, imagine that the rise in these cases had left social workers
even more overstretched. They would have less time to monitor
children
at home and to keep families together. They would also have less time
for the hard-core cases. No system can ever protect every child. But
the toddler on Haringey's at-risk register who was found dead last
week with fractured ribs, a broken back and two missing fingernails
was surely more deserving of removal than those at risk of low self-
esteem.

So many cases are gut-wrenchingly complex. We need social workers to
be properly accountable. We need the family courts to be open. Mrs
Brookes is clearly not perfect, but she deserves to have clear
grounds
for the removal of her child. Right now, it looks as though around
6,000 people stand accused of abuse, or potential abuse, that no
lawyer can even define. That is an appalling vista that we must not
continue to hide from public view.

&gt; &gt; take her next baby into care.

&gt; &gt; Had it been staged, critics would have called it a caricature. A
&gt; &gt; robotic official orders the sobbing mother to stay in the hospital
&gt; &gt; until his colleagues come to remove her new baby. He refuses her
&gt; &gt; desperate pleas to be monitored with the baby at home. He explains in
&gt; &gt; the tones of a traffic warden the inconvenience of delivering her
&gt; &gt; breast milk. He then lets drop an astonishing admission: that
&gt; &gt; Calderdale Council is pursuing a court order despite there being &quot;no
&gt; &gt; immediate risk to your child from yourselves&quot;. Will he say that in
&gt; &gt; court? We will not know, of course, for the court will sit in secret.

&gt; &gt; Such a chilling drama plays to our deepest fears of state tyranny.
&gt; &gt; There is something wrong with the system. But posting a conversation
&gt; &gt; on YouTube, out of context, is not the way to right it. The council
&gt; &gt; argues that Vanessa Brookes's recording falls foul of the Data
&gt; &gt; Protection Act. Her supporters say that she is a victim of social
&gt; &gt; services and justified in publishing what is essentially her own
&gt; &gt; data.
&gt; &gt; But we do not know whether she is a victim. Who is abusing whom here?

&gt; &gt; Mrs Brookes's case is not straightforward. She is partially sighted
&gt; &gt; and has suffered bouts of depression. Two of her children have
&gt; &gt; already
&gt; &gt; been adopted. That does not prove that she is an unfit mother -
&gt; &gt; mistakes can be made - but it does explain the council's interest.
&gt; &gt; Equally, I am told that she and her husband have never been accused
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; harming any child. But this dribble of incomplete facts is
&gt; &gt; fundamentally unenlightening. All it does is illustrate the torturous
&gt; &gt; trade-offs that the system has to make, and our inability to judge
&gt; &gt; those trade-offs because it is illegal to read family court papers.

&gt; &gt; How should we treat someone like Mrs Brookes, who has troubles enough
&gt; &gt; to worry social services but has not apparently yet harmed a child?
&gt; &gt; She is one of a growing group of people who are categorised as
&gt; &gt; capable
&gt; &gt; of &quot;emotional abuse&quot;. You can see why the category exists. Ill-
&gt; &gt; treatment comes in many forms, not just cigarette burns. But in that
&gt; &gt; nebulous phrase lurks the potential for great injustice.

&gt; &gt; &quot;Emotional abuse&quot; has no strict definition in British law. Yet it now
&gt; &gt; accounts for an astounding 21 per cent of all children registered as
&gt; &gt; needing protection, up from 14 per cent in 1997. Last year 6,700
&gt; &gt; children were put on the child protection register for emotional
&gt; &gt; abuse, compared with only 2,600 for sexual abuse and 5,100 for
&gt; &gt; physical abuse. Both of the latter two categories have been falling
&gt; &gt; steadily. Meanwhile emotional abuse and &quot;neglect&quot; - which replaced
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; old notion of &quot;grave concern&quot; in 1989 - have been rising. Both are
&gt; &gt; catch-alls. But emotional abuse is especially vague. It covers
&gt; &gt; children who have not been injured, have not complained, and do not
&gt; &gt; come under &quot;emotional neglect&quot;.

&gt; &gt; The Department of Health defines emotional abuse as &quot;persistent
&gt; &gt; emotional ill-treatment . . . [which] may involve conveying to
&gt; &gt; children that they are worthless or inadequate . . . and may feature
&gt; &gt; age or developmentally inappropriate expectations being placed on
&gt; &gt; children . . . Some level of emotional abuse is involved in all types
&gt; &gt; of ill-treatment of a child, though it may occur alone&quot;.

&gt; &gt; Local authorities have printed their own, wildly differing,
&gt; &gt; interpretations. In Enfield emotional abuse includes &quot;swearing&quot;,
&gt; &gt; &quot;conditional love&quot; or &quot;discriminatory remarks&quot;. In Nottingham, it is
&gt; &gt; &quot;an ingrained pattern of interaction . . . which it is essential to
&gt; &gt; observe and understand over time&quot;. Under that definition, a baby
&gt; &gt; could
&gt; &gt; never be removed at birth. Nottingham also states that emotional
&gt; &gt; abuse
&gt; &gt; should rarely be a cause for removing a child. Meanwhile the NSPCC,
&gt; &gt; the charity that has never knowingly undersold a statistic, states in
&gt; &gt; its briefing on emotional abuse that &quot;18 per cent of children
&gt; &gt; experience humiliation and/or attacks on self-esteem&quot;. Should we put
&gt; &gt; them all in care, then?

&gt; &gt; &quot;You'll know it when you see it - except that you can't see it&quot; is no
&gt; &gt; way to make law. Abuse literature repeatedly states how often parent
&gt; &gt; and child are unaware of the damage done by their relationship
&gt; &gt; patterns. How do we weigh that damage against the trauma of the
&gt; &gt; conveyor belt of foster care? In most such situations, isn't removing
&gt; &gt; a child utterly disproportionate?

&gt; &gt; Just imagine that some social services departments were crusaders,
&gt; &gt; seeing evil parents everywhere but unable to prove conventional
&gt; &gt; abuse.
&gt; &gt; It is plausible that the number of vague allegations would rise,
&gt; &gt; backed by psychiatrists of a similar mindset who are prepared to
&gt; &gt; enter
&gt; &gt; a &quot;maybe&quot;. How else can one explain a 50 per cent rise in emotional
&gt; &gt; abuse cases in ten years? How many of those cases are utterly
&gt; &gt; marginal?

&gt; &gt; Next, imagine that the rise in these cases had left social workers
&gt; &gt; even more overstretched. They would have less time to monitor
&gt; &gt; children
&gt; &gt; at home and to keep families together. They would also have less time
&gt; &gt; for the hard-core cases. No system can ever protect every child. But
&gt; &gt; the toddler on Haringey's at-risk register who was found dead last
&gt; &gt; week with fractured ribs, a broken back and two missing fingernails
&gt; &gt; was surely more deserving of removal than those at risk of low self-
&gt; &gt; esteem.

&gt; &gt; So many cases are gut-wrenchingly complex. We need social workers to
&gt; &gt; be properly accountable. We need the family courts to be open. Mrs
&gt; &gt; Brookes is clearly not perfect, but she deserves to have clear
&gt; &gt; grounds
&gt; &gt; for the removal of her child. Right now, it looks as though around
&gt; &gt; 6,000 people stand accused of abuse, or potential abuse, that no
&gt; &gt; lawyer can even define. That is an appalling vista that we must not
&gt; &gt; continue to hide from public view.
