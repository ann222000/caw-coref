Funny thing, too. Many (but by no means all) incandescent lamps are
made in North America (lots of production has shifted to Canada and
Mexico), and another large chunk is made in Europe, mostly Hungary
almost exclusively for the North American market. If PL-type
fluorescents are mandated, that production is mostly on the Pacific
Rim (where energy has always been very costly, BTW).

More jobs to China and off-shore in general. Less energy-pig
production in North America. Happened with cars, happening with trucks
(Check out Hino, Volvo, Hyundai and so forth), lawn mowers. Cummins
makes most of its large-block stationary diesels and NG fired engines
in India... Only in this case, there is no incentive for the Chinese
factorys (with names like Philips, GE, Sylvania) should move assembly
to the US. We are nearly 100% PL in our house, as the incandescents
blow, they go. At a vague count, we have over 50 lamps-in-use. One
house. About half that in the other house. I would guess we are about
average overall for householders. But a SWAG guess would be something
like 8 residential lamps per individual.... SWAG at 300,000,000
individuals in the US, legal and not. That is 2.4 Billion Lamps.
Assume (given PL-types) a 5% annual replacement, that's 120,000,000
lamps each year. Good for a few jobs, maybe?

But where does the long-term production shift? Off-shore. And where
does the obsolete production stay? Right here.

I bought a 1/2-pound bag of 47s when Leon Fertik closed his doors...
which I just found the other day, I had forgotten all about it.
Between that and my known-stash, I think I am in pretty good shape for
the moment.

At work, we buy lightbulbs that come from a Colombian manufacturer.

The four-packs of 130 volt standard bulbs I buy for home use in the
dollar stores come from China, however.

I wonder if the Cali-fascists realize that these CFL things don't fit
all fixtures and there are certain uses for which fluorescents will
NOT work.

Ever try starting one of those fluorescent lights in freezing
temperatures?   They just don't work.

There's also quality control problems.  A lot of those lamps toss out
a putrid blue light instead of the "bright white" that is advertised.
Then there's the matter of the defective lamps where you can see the
gasses swirling around inside.....and the light flickers also -- even
in a good fixture.

There's tons more options if you look around for energy saving bulbs.
Granted, they cost more, but LEDs have a massive life and if you're
lucky you can hack the LED bulb to replace the LEDs if they burn out.

Imagine a couple of solar cells on the roof of your house, charging a
small battery bank. This bank is distributed through your house on 12v
dedicated wiring which handles all your lighting needs. Even your
computers could be ran this way.

Just can't live without 110/220 though.. ;) Unless they can run a
refrigerator on 12v.

I'm more concerned about the broadband noise that
flourescents radiate. Since I collect/restore pinball machines
as well as radios, I buy 47's in bulk. If I'm not able to get
these (very unlikely), I'll be in trouble!

They do. They are small, but they do run them. The one in our VW
camper even makes ice.... eventually. It is 3-fuel, AC/12V/Propane,
and about 1.5CF, but it is perfect for the application. If we became
more like Europeans and purchased our perishables each day, it would
be enough for most things.

As to the LED-driven lamps you suggest, they would be great for
special purposes, but I suspect that one would be driven to
distraction pretty quickly if one were to have to read by that light,
or cook, or do anything requiring accurate color recognition (such as
parsing resistors). I expect that will be cured in time... but as it
is now, it takes filaments and/or gas-discharge lamps for accurate and
(relatively) flicker-free color rendition.

A PL type lamp makes about 5W of light from about 17W of input, a
standard incandescent does about 5.5W/100W depending on several
factors.

Put another way, Incandescents at best get about 17 lumens per watt.
PL-types get about 65LPW, the best cutting-edge LEDs get about 113 LPW
with 130 LPW only a very few years out. But one has to look at the
disclaimers and catches. LED output is not diffuse, but aligned by an
internal mirror (or mirrors) in order to achieve those levels. So the
light is nearly monochromatic (very bright blue) and very the rays are
very nearly parallel. Time will tell.

Great for flashlights &amp; spotlights. Not so great (yet) for general
use.

LED s are a whole lot MORE expensive, too, and are tough to config for 120v
use.  As opposed to auto/truck use.   Many more of the traffic lights are
going to LED however.

The spiral bulbs for 120v use always fire up, and reach full brightness in 1
minute on my porch, starting from 17 degrees last night.   The 40" 48w tube
types   in my garage, they take much longer to come up to full, if ever in

Been using a LED flashlight for about ten years.  I'm not usually an
early adopter, but I got tired of replacing the little grain o' wheat
Maglite bulbs.

I've often used this puppy (two 'white' LEDs) to read by.  No problem
there.  The spectrum is limited, but many LED fixtures use mixing of
various colored units to get white, as opposed to multiple white LEDs.
This allows changing the ratio of LED units employed to get any color
desired.

LEDs are definitely the wave of the future, unless some new technology
emerges.

What about the new 'soft' white LEDs they make now, they are supposed
to be an incandescent color, not blue-white like the old ones.  The
dude that makes TZ clock boards even gives the option of putting those
leds on it.  On the diffusion aspect, what would be big deal about
making the housing they are in have diffusion properties instead of
just the bare leds all stacked up in one direction?  Like have them
all point upwards at a white surface that then indirectly lights the
room, or shine the leds thru a white transluscent material, like a
regular light bulb does with the frosted glass?

The problem still remains, as with the fluorescents, that they don't emit
a nice, even spectrum. It's just 2 to 4 peak frequencies. This limits the
number of colours that can be correctly perceived using such light. This
is also the main limiting factor in backlighted LCD screens.

There are broad spectrum LED's out now. There are even some pretty bright
ones. We have a bunch that are equivalent to either 7 watt or 15 watt bulbs.
I can send you a sample of the 7watt version, draws about a half watt, IIRC.
I could maybe send a sample of the larger one as well, but I'm not sure I
have any 120V ones of those.. mostly 250V.

Add a relay and use whatever you want.  A 120 VAC coil, and 15 or 20

Phil there are extra long life incandescent for such purposes (usually a
130-135 volt bulb) which waste some power but sound useful for your case.

HOWEVER, if a man runs a 100 watt bulb half the day it will use more than
twice the power of a 22 watt equivalent fluorescent run 24 hr. if you simply
can the photocell.

You can get so-called  "high output" fluorescent lamps; 48" tubes with Bakelite end caps
with internal connectors, instead of the familiar two pins. Work with a special ballast.
Used in outdoor applications like signs, and shopping malls, and around here, on drilling

More expensive, though, and consume more power. But constantly replacing regular fluor
tubes and ballasts blown because of extended starts at cold temperatures is expensive,
too.

And if California mandates incandescent bulbs out of the marketplace, how are they going
to replace bulbs in table lamps where the shade mounts on a spring clip to the bulb?

What a stupid idea, ban this, ban that, I hate knee jerk reactions.

It would make more sense to continue selling standard incandescent bulbs
but tax them to subsidize the sales and recycling of compact fluorescent
bulbs. That way the old bulbs could still be bought if one desired but
CFLs would be more attractively priced.

I like CFLs and use them almost exclusively, but I find it worrying how
hard it is to find a place to recycle them. Each one contains a
significant amount of mercury as well as somewhat toxic phosphor
compounds, I have no official data on this but it would not surprise me
if this outweighs the savings from an environmental standpoint when
these lamps end up in the landfill as most undoubtably do. Add to this
the very high early mortality rate of the cheap ones and it could really
add up.

&gt; gasses swirling around inside.....and the light flickers also -- even

">

The "putrid blue" light is daylight, these lamps are a bit harder to
find and generally more expensive, they are often labeled with the color
temperature which is usually 5360 or 6500 Kelvin. I like these for
outdoor lighting and task lighting but they're a bit icy for living
areas. The most common are 2700K which closely mimic the color of
incandescent but they look too yellow for my liking now. I've adapted
well to 3100K which is a warmish neutral color, sometimes slightly
pinkish but without the dirty yellow cast. 4100K is a nice clean neutral
white, but rare in compacts.

Quality is a real problem, especially with cheap Chinese CFLs, but the
usual failure mode I run into is they simply fail to light.

When it comes to standard linear fluorescents, many places are going to
the new low mercury lamps which unfortunately suck, they rarely last
anywhere near rated life, usually changing to a dim pink glow as the
mercury is depleted.

&gt; One would think that sooner or later as production increases and

&gt; LED's appear to me to be a whole lot more efficient than the stuff
&gt; they are pushing now?
">

They're improving by leaps and bounds, but they're not there yet. High
efficiency LEDs are pushing around 50 lumens per watt which is not too
great compared to the 55-100 LPW of various fluorescent technology.
Ironically, mercury vapor lamps which were villanized in the early 80s
for being inefficient are around that same 50 LPW level. An additional
problem is that most white LEDs are made with a broad spectrum yellow
emitting phosphor over a blue chip and the result is a very high color
temperature (bluish) light which fades and becomes much dimmer and more
blue as the phosphor ages.

Where LEDs really shine are applications where you want a highly
directional source of saturated color light, traffic signals for
example. You see huge efficiency gains with LED even though they are
only modestly more efficient than the bare incandescent bulb, because
rather than take an inefficient omnidirectional white source, lose some
more in the process of directing the light all in the direction you want
it, then throw away most of what's left with a color filter, you can
just directly produce only the color you want and it's already
directional so you don't have the optical losses either.

I suspect LEDs will eventually improve enough while the cost drops to
the point that they'll make decent general illumination but for the time
being they're a niche product which is nearly ideal for certain
applications but most certainly not one size fits all.

It really depends, look at the CRI rating of the fluorescents, 100 is
considered perfect and equal to sunlight. Standard old style
halophosphate tubes such as the CW and WW are about 53, inexpensive
trichromatic tubes are in the 70 range, better trichromatics including
most CFLs are in the 80s. You can get a few special mix halophosphates
such as Colortone 50 which use a true red phosphor in the mix to bump
the CRI up to 90+, at the expense of some efficiency. LCD backlight
tubes use a trichromatic mix which consists of pretty much the same
phosphors used in modern color CRTs, so the backlight alone isn't
responsible for poorer color.

Generally a 240V CFL won't light at all at 120V, but two things are at
work here. The fluorescent lamp is a constant-current device and power
is regulated by the ballast which in the case of a CFL is mounted within
the base. Reduce the input voltage and the ballast will try to
compensate to keep lamp power constant, this can do two things, either
fry the ballast, or the arc current can be insufficient to keep the
cathodes in the tube sufficiently heated and they will sputter,

That would be RDC, or recessed double contact end caps. The HO tubes are

How did this happen? I can't think of anything that would cause this. A
3 way socket simply has an extra contact which is connected to the
switch. Even if the two bottom contacts got shorted together by a poorly
designed base they both are at the same potential with the lamp on high
anyway. Sounds like the ballast may have failed by coincidence and
charred the plastic, it sounds like it didn't actually catch anything on
