INTRODUCTION
ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THIS ESSAY:
This essay examines the following four aspects of selected  policies of
contemporary and recent governments in Nigeria. First are the  expressed, implied,
spoken, and unspoken policies of Nigerian governments, 1985  - 1999. Second is
the leadership manner of the officials of these governments.  Third is the
effect on ordinary Nigerians of the policies and leadership  idiosyncrasies
(behavior patterns) of the government officials. Fourth, and  finally, is the
consequent behavior (reaction) of Nigerians in and out of the  country.
Many of the policies, programs, and behaviors of the successive  governments
or regimes in Nigeria have led to increased poverty and deprivation  among
Nigerians. Also, some of these policies, etc. have created anomic  conditions
among the citizens. In reaction to the policies, idiosyncrasies, and  situations
to which their governments have consistently exposed them, many  Nigerians
engage in criminal or deviant conduct, in and out of Nigeria.  Sometimes, the
nature of the relationship between Nigerians and their  governments cause the
citizens to be perceived as criminals by non-Nigerians.  Even those Nigerians who
do not react criminally or deviantly to the misbehavior  of their governments
feel betrayed and criminalized by the words and actions of  those governments
and their officials.
I write this essay partly from the standpoint of a  criminologist.
Criminology teaches us that criminal behavior may result from  want; that criminal
behavior may be a consequence of deprivation - material  deprivation. To fully
explain this position, I have drawn from my other  perspective as a scientific
research methodologist. In Criminological/Criminal  Justice (&quot;C/CJ&quot;) scientific
research, a hypothesis to the effect that, &quot;Poverty  causes crime,&quot; is a
reasonable statement. It is thus an acceptable and workable  hypothesis. It does not
cease to be either just because many &quot;poor&quot; persons are  not criminals. The
hypothesis holds true even if only one &quot;poor&quot; person becomes  &quot;criminal&quot; as a
result of the poverty situation.
The poverty circumstances in Nigeria do not affect just &quot;one  person.&quot; A
major part of the population is affected. According to the United  Nations
International Children's Emergency Fund (&quot;UNICEF&quot;), more than 64% of  Nigerians live
in poverty: &quot;About 48 percent of Nigeria's estimated 104 million  people live
below the poverty line, while another 16.2 percent constitute the  core
poor....&quot; Although the UNICEF reports do not define &quot;poverty,&quot; they,  however, go on
to present situations that a reasonable person would agree are  clear
indicators of poverty. According to the reports, the UNICEF representative  in
Nigeria blames the country's poverty situation on &quot;mass poverty,&quot; which he  said &quot;is
largely responsible for the rise in the level of malnutrition among  Nigerian
children.&quot; The reports show a drastic drop in the real income of  workers,
wide-spread unemployment and high child-dependency ratio. [Further, the  UNICEF
representative said]; &quot;In a situation where the majority of the adult
population are unable to meet the basic human needs and cannot live fulfilling
lives, the rights of those dependent on them are being totally marginalised.&quot;1  As
much as 75% of Nigerians have been estimated as living below the poverty
line.
I have delved into the foregoing discussion because I am  convinced that,
since political independence from Britain, the &quot;governments&quot;  that have ruled
Nigeria (particularly, 1985 - 1999) have, by their policies,  criminalized the
citizenry. These policies are aimed, consciously or  unconsciously, at the
deprivations and denials of the basic things that Nigerian  citizens need to
sustain their lives and prosper. These deprivations, coupled  with the unstable,
chaotic, and unpredictable governance of Nigeria, have  resulted in the
criminalization of the nation. This essay draws examples of such  policies wherever
they are found. However, contemporary and recent policies of  the Nigerian
governments are my primary concern. At the onset of the &quot;new  political
dispensation&quot; of General Abdulsalam Abubakar (June 1998 - May 1999),  the UNICEF
representative in Nigeria was enthusiastic.2 However, I was extremely  cautious, as
many Nigerians were,3 because civilian and military governments  alike in Nigeria
have consistently made unfulfilled promises to Nigerians and  the world at
large. They appear to start with good intentions, only to show  their true,
narrow intentions through criminalizing policies, programs, and  actions.
This essay examines three kinds of Nigerian governments'  policies, programs,
actions, and behavior patterns that criminalize the  citizenry. One kind
drives Nigerians to actual criminal behavior. The second  kind is made up of
official policies, programs, etc. that create anomic  conditions or conditions of
normlessness among Nigerians.4 The third kind causes  Nigerians to be perceived
as criminals, particularly outside the  country.

NIGERIA: BACKGROUND AND HISTORY
This subsection provides a background to the extremely diverse  Nigerian
citizenry. The diversities have, in turn, given rise to a wide range of  opposing
and conflicting interests in the politics (civilian and military) and
governance of the country. Virtually all of Nigeria's more than 100 million5
citizens are Africans. That, however, is where the similarity ends. Nigerians  differ
on, among other variables, ethnicity, religion, culture, lifestyle,
tradition, custom, indigenous government system, and indigenous justice system.  There
are approximately 250 ethnic groups in Nigeria. Three of these are the
so-called dominant or major ethnic groups. In Nigeria, differences on grounds of
religion, culture, lifestyle, tradition, custom, indigenous government, and
indigenous judicial processes are common due to the unique local practices and
the foreign influences on Nigerians.
&quot;Nigeria&quot;6 resulted from the might of Britain, which usurped the  powers and
resources in the constituent parts of the country for about a century  - 1860
to 1960. Understandably, the usurpation of the powers and resources  happened
gradually. Eventually, in 1914, the British colonial rulers were able  to
control the entire land area now called Nigeria. The control continued until
October 1, 1960, when Nigeria received political independence from Britain.
However, the British head of State continued to be the head of the Nigerian  State.
Also, the Judicial Committee of the British House of Lords continued to  be
the court of last resort for Nigerians. On October 1, 1963, Nigeria, under
Nnamdi Azikiwe, President, and Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Prime Minister, severed
these and other such ties with Britain by proclaiming Nigeria a  &quot;republic.&quot;
Since political independence on October 1, 1960, Nigerians have  been through
civilian, military; parliamentary, presidential; federal, unitary;  elected,
unelected; democratic, dictatorial; and other combinations of  governments.
Nigeria today is made up of 36 states and the &quot;federal&quot; capital  territory,
Abuja. Officially, the country is referred to as the &quot;Federal  Republic of
Nigeria.&quot; Nigeria may be a republic, but is it really a federation?  The answer to
this question will shed some light on the extent to which the  policies of the
governments in Nigeria (national, state, and local) affect the  lives of
Nigerians. With the exceptions of the two elected regimes in the  country (1960 to
1966; 1979 to 1983), successive administrations in Nigeria have  been federal
in name but unitary in practice.
Whenever a General Abdulsalam Abubakar could appoint a loyal  colleague
(usually, military colleague) to &quot;administer&quot; state A, there could not  have been a
federalism, especially considering that, in that arrangement, the  indigenes
of the state had no part whatsoever in the appointment of the  administrator.
Moreover, the General Abubakar and his hand picked loyalists (at  the state
and national levels) made laws for the entire Nigeria, not minding  that they
violated fundamental ingredients of federalism. These ingredients can  be
described in the following words: In a federation, power and authority must  be
constitutionally divided between (or among) the levels of government  (examples,
national, state, local), and no level is permitted to usurp or  arrogate to
itself the power or authority of another, except in the case of a  national
emergency. None of the incidents of usurpation by federal authorities  of the state
and local powers and authorities in Nigeria can be explained on  grounds of
national emergency.
As I write this essay, Nigeria has been politically independent  for some 39
years. Through these years, the country has experienced different  mixtures of
civilian and military leaderships. It is not quite accurate to state  that
&quot;since Nigeria's political independence, the military have ruled the  country
for 29 years, while the civilians have ruled for the remaining 10  years.&quot; The
apt description of the situation is that through these years,  Nigeria has been
ruled or led by a relatively few civilian and military  personnel. Many of
the personnel have been recycled from one point in the  country's life to
another. Through the 39 years of Nigeria's nationhood since  political independence,
every &quot;civilian&quot; government has been made up almost  entirely of Nigerian
civilians. Every one of the numerous &quot;military&quot;  administrations in the country
has also included civilian personnel in key,  powerful positions. During at
least one military administration in Nigeria  (General Yakubu Gowon's regime,
July 29, 1966 - July 29, 1975), the national  government included a civilian who
served as the deputy head of State. That  civilian deputy head of state in a
&quot;military&quot; regime was the late Obafemi  Awolowo.
Whether Nigeria is ruled by civilian or military personnel,  Nigerians seem
to always end up with a bunch of beastly, atavistic creatures,  who disguise
themselves as leaders, but whose true intention is to line their  pockets and
those of their relations and cronies with the wealth of the  citizens. Virtually
all the leaders' policies are designed to ensure the  realization of this
goal.

METHODOLOGY
This essay is based on data collected through mixed methods and  procedures.
Three main methods of data collection have been utilized; field  observations,
interviews, and archival searches. All the data have been  content-analyzed
to extract the needed information for this essay.7
In the months of December 1997 and January 1998, I spent some 25  days in
Nigeria. I had returned to Nigeria, having been away from the country  since
April 1992. I had left Nigeria in 1992 for graduate studies in the United  States
of America (&quot;USA&quot;). Before I left Nigeria in 1992, I had known about the
advance fee fraud scheme, popularly known in Nigeria as &quot;419&quot;8. While in the  USA,
I continued to learn about the scheme. I surmised that the scheme was
largely a consequence of the deprivations that most Nigerians suffered in the  hands
of their governments. I, therefore, decided that during my December 1997
through January 1998 stay in Nigeria, I would conduct field observations and
interviews to learn more about what I decided were the &quot;criminalizing policies&quot;
of the governments in Nigeria. I had also decided to collect available
archives  on the relevant policies of the governments. While in Nigeria, I did some
field  observations, interviews, and collected relevant newspaper and magazine
materials. The data collected from those exercises have helped me
tremendously  in preparing this essay.
Before the trip to Nigeria, and since I returned to the USA, I  scrupulously
followed and collected relevant items from such news organizations  as the
Panafrican News Agency (&quot;PANA&quot;), AfricaNews Online, Nigeria Page, Post  Express,
Nigeria Web, the Nigerian Vanguard newspaper, The Guardian (Nigerian),  the
American Cable News Network (&quot;CNN&quot;), American Broadcasting Corporation  (&quot;ABC&quot;),
among others. I kept a daily record of these archival sources on the
Internet. All these sources have contributed greatly to the data that form the  basis
for this essay. Additional materials were collected at the Institute of
African Studies, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, where I spent a short period of
time in the fall of 1997 at the sponsorship of my institution, Western Carolina
University.

GOVERNMENT POLICIES, CIRCUMSTANCES, AND BEHAVIOR, AND  THEIR EFFECTS ON
NIGERIANS
&quot;Policy&quot; or &quot;policies&quot; in this essay includes written,  unwritten, spoken,
unspoken, intended, unintended consequences of the words and  actions of the
governments in Nigeria and their officials. Most of the policies  and situations
(behavior patterns of government officials) addressed in this  essay are those
created by the Nigerian national (or central) government, its  agencies, and
officials. These policies, situations, and behavior patterns of  the central
government officials affect the lives of most Nigerians - in all the  36 states
in the country and outside the country.
The reality of the situation on the ground today, and for most  of Nigeria's
history since political independence, is that the country is not  really a
federation.9 As a former Nigerian military head of state has  acknowledged,
Nigeria's central government is too powerful.10 The central  government controls
virtually all human and natural resources in the country at  the expense of the
constituent states. &quot;If Nigeria is a federal state, why must  the individual
states not control their mineral resources?&quot;11 This behavior of  Nigeria's
central government has reduced the 36 states in the country to  &quot;beggarly
states.&quot;12
With its economic advantage over the state and local governments  in the
country, Nigeria's central government constantly overreaches its powers  and
authorities and deprives the state and local governments of their respective
powers and authorities. In the same manner, the policies of the central  government
and the negative behaviors of its officials permeate every aspect of  life in
Nigeria. In this essay, I have concentrated on those policies,  situations,
and behavior patterns that produce negative political and economic
consequences for Nigerians. The government policies and behaviors regarding  these two
aspects of the citizens' lives criminalize most Nigerians.
The act of governance is, primarily, about making public  policies and
implementing them for the benefit of all the members of the  relevant political
entity. That is what it should be. In most cases, it is  necessary for key
government officials to be employed full time by the State, in  order for them to
direct their full attention to the affairs of State. In  Nigeria, the governments
and their officials make public policies, not for the  benefit of all
Nigerians, but for the benefit of the privileged few.
The following part of this essay examines the main policies of  the Nigerian
governments as well as other situations created by, and the  circumstances of,
these governments and their officials. These five main  policies, situations,
circumstances, and idiosyncrasies of the contemporary and  recent Nigerian
governments and their officials have led to negative (sometimes,  criminal)
behavior by some Nigerians.

1. GOVERNMENT BY THE UNELECTED - &quot;MILITARY&quot; OR  &quot;CIVILIAN&quot;:
One of the tragedies of leadership, government, and politics in  Nigeria is
the apparent legitimization of illegitimate means of attaining power.
&quot;Illegitimate means&quot; refers to unconstitutional and other extra-legal means to  seize
and control the State powers. The country's military are, of course, the  main
culprits in this repulsive enterprise. By virtue of their endless meddling
in the country's leadership arrangement, the Nigerian military personnel have
metamorphosed into military-politicians or &quot;militicians.&quot; Not to be forgotten,
however, are the privileged, elite civilians, who have little or nothing to
lose  whether the country is ruled by civilians or the military. Indeed, these
military personnel in civilian dresses benefit, individually and
collectively,  whether Nigeria is ruled by the civilians or the military. Moreover,
whenever  the military usurp the powers of the Nigerian State, it is partly because
they  have been called upon or encouraged to do so by the civilian
politicians who  stand to gain from the prospective military regime. Even after so many
years of  the military governments' dehumanization of the Nigerian citizenry,
it is  doubtful that the country's civilian politicians &quot;have realised the
stupidity of  their actions&quot; in inviting the military to usurp the powers of the
Nigerian  State.13
A regime that results from the use of an illegitimate means of  attaining and
maintaining the Nigerian State powers is always made up of cronies  -
military and civilian. The military leaders simply recruit some civilians who  are
willing to sing the formers' praise at all costs. Nigeria then ends up with  a
&quot;government&quot; in which reasonable citizens are excluded from participation in
shaping their public policies.14 As an example, ... under Abacha [the late
Nigerian military ruler], we were all exiles. There was only a difference -
internal exiles and external exiles. Nigerians faced a period of complete social
alienation from their environment, from their potential and sometimes on many
levels, I think we the external exiles were much better off.15
The difference between General Abacha's regime and other  illegitimate
regimes in Nigeria is not in what was (and is being) done by the  different regimes.
Rather, the difference lies in the extent to which each  regime has gone in
isolating and criminalizing Nigerian citizens. Basically, the  Abacha regime
did what other illegal regimes have done, and continue to do, to  Nigerians.
Abacha was, however, a crude, crazed, beastly, atavist who was  willing to go
farther to gain and keep the powers of State in Nigeria. But note  that Abacha
could not have had the opportunity to inflict his criminalizing  policies on the
Nigerian population, except for the equally dastardly  viciousness of his
predecessor, General Ibrahim Babangida, who paved the way for  Abacha. Later in
this essay, I will discuss further the criminalizing effects on  Nigerians of
General Babangida's policies.
A government, no matter how wise its officials are, cannot  govern
effectively or efficiently if it excludes its citizens from participation  in public
affairs. That has been happening in Nigeria in most of the country's  history.
This has resulted in the forfeiture of the huge contributions  generations of
Nigerians would have made to building a (great) nation out of the  country,
hence there is left only a &quot;crippled giant&quot; called  Nigeria.16
Another disheartening situation in the Nigerian body politic is  that, almost
without exception, all the administrations that have run Nigeria  have been
made up of incapable leaders. These leaders have neither direction nor  vision
for the country. A country with Nigeria's human and material wealth is in  a
sound position to choose leaders who are honest, intelligent, and willing to
devote their time and effort to planning for a brighter future for the country.
I know of no Nigerian leader, particularly in the last 15 years, who has
thought  of where or what the country would be in the next 10 years, 20 years,
etc. It is  always about immediate, personal gains for the leader and his
cronies. This  attitude, of course, trickles down the scheme of things in the
country because,  as the Igbos of Nigeria say, mmiri si n'isi gbaruo (&quot;the water is
polluted at  the source&quot;). Since the leaders have set bad examples for all
Nigerians, the  situation leaves the average citizen with little or no legitimate
survival  option.
The single-mindedness with which the successive governments in  Nigeria have
pursued self-preservation eats away at every other aspect of the  country's
life. In its quest to hold on to Nigeria's leadership, each government  is blind
to the other pressing needs of the country and its citizens. So far in
Nigeria, the juntas of Generals Ibrahim Babangida and Sani Abacha have been the
biggest culprits in this regard. They have, without question, and even adjusting
for inflation, outspent all the other administrations in the country for
&quot;defense.&quot; Most of the arms and ammunition, of course, are bought from Europe
and the USA. Thus, the limited national funds that should be spent for the
basic  welfare (food, health, shelter, education, growth opportunities, etc.) of
all  Nigerians are instead spent for the limited purpose of preserving despots
such  as Generals Babangida and Abacha in offices. However, even the dribbling
politico-soldier (&quot;'Maradona' Babangida&quot;), who closely followed the
Machiavellian suasion (&quot;the end justifies the means&quot;) ultimately had his
criminalizing crusade against Nigerians stopped. He had failed to heed another  of the
Machiavellian pieces of advice: ... the best fortress is to be found in  the
love of the people, for although you may have fortresses they will not save  you
if you are hated by the people.17 At the end, neither General Babangida nor
General Abacha was saved by his fortress at the Dodan Barracks, Lagos or the
&quot;presidential villa,&quot; Abuja. No future criminally-minded leader of Nigeria will
be saved either.
One of the destructive consequences of an unpopular, unelected  government to
a country is instability. This instability affects every aspect of  the
country. It is, however, most visible in the areas of political leadership  and
economic development. Nigerians have faced these consequences through all of  the
country's life as an independent political entity. Two of the main
outgrowths of instability in Nigeria are the unpredictability and uncertainty  of: (a)
the life of the country as one entity, (b) the lives and future of  individual
Nigerians.
In the Nigeria of today, and for all of the country's life since  political
independence, an existing regime may be changed at any time (by force  or
extra-legal means such as coup d'etat). The uncertainty and unpredictability  of
leadership in the country result in an atmosphere in which persons who occupy
leadership positions at any point in time regard their positions as
opportunities to steal as much of the people's wealth as possible. The thievery  by the
Generals Obasanjo, Babangida, and Abacha respective cabals are  colossal.18
See also APPENDIX A. Nigerians continue to suffer from the  consequences of
unbridled greed and lack of accountability in the country's  public life. Adding
salt to the injury to average Nigerians is the fact that  erstwhile thieves of
State in Nigeria are always eager to return to power and  fatten their
leadership spoils. Former military dictators, Generals Obasanjo and  Babangida have
recently realized their objective of returning Obasanjo to the  scene of their
criminalizing policies and actions against Nigerians.19 If  Obasanjo wastes
his second opportunity to serve all Nigerians, history will  judge him twice as
harshly as his erstwhile partners in  criminalization.
It is common for elite Nigerians to clamor and lobby, covertly  and overtly,
for public offices, with the expectation that a lot of public  wealth can be
personally appropriated. The negative ambition of Nigeria's rulers  are
enhanced by the fact that successive regimes in Nigeria have not given  serious, if
any, thought to accountability in public offices. This is not  surprising
considering that illegal processes have begot most of the regimes.  Being thus
illegal, they cannot reasonably be expected to use the law to protect  the
Nigerian people.

2. THE NOTION AND ATTITUDE THAT THE NIGERIAN MILITARY ARE  SUPERIOR TO THE
LAWS OF THE COUNTRY:
Military personnel in Nigeria regard themselves as a privileged,  elite class
that should live above the rest of the population. And they live as  such.
Although the Nigerian Armed Forces were established to secure and protect  the
country and its citizens, these Forces have, through their words and  actions,
consistently placed themselves above the other Nigerians. Nigerian  Armed
Forces personnel carry this attitude with them in and out of government.  This
neo-colonial mentality persists despite the fact that the Nigerian official
justice system professes allegiance to the rule of law.
I continue to wonder why the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Mohammed  Uwais, swore
General Abdulsalam Abubakar who, in June 1998, became Nigeria's  eighth
military ruler since political independence, into office.20 Ordinarily,  being
sworn into a position or office means, at a minimum, that the person so  sworn has
attained power legally and will govern according to the laws of the  land.
Although sworn into office by the Chief Justice of Nigeria, many policies  and
acts of General Abubakar's regime sabotaged and destroyed the rule of law  and
human rights in Nigeria.
General Abubakar's regime appeared to have reduced the tense  political
environment existing in the country during the rule of his late  predecessor, Gen.
Sani Abacha. However, a United Nations (&quot;UN&quot;) human rights  report on Nigeria
concluded that the rule of law and human rights eluded  Nigerians while Gen.
Abubakar reigned.21 According to the UN's special  investigator for human
rights:

The Nigerian legal system currently does not provide  effective protection of
human rights. Rule of law is still not established in  Nigeria. The
independence and authority of the judiciary are undermined by  clauses in executive
decrees which oust the jurisdiction of the courts.22
The special investigator reported further that the rights of  individual
Nigerians to liberty and security were not protected since they could  be detained
indefinitely (without trial) under the repugnant Decree No. 2 of  1984.23 In
view of the human rights situation in Nigeria, the UN called on the  country's
authorities to take steps to protect human rights.24
A little comparative analysis is in order here. Even in full  recognition of
the national differences between the two countries, the &quot;rule of  law&quot; in
Nigeria is a far cry from what it is in the USA. The ideas that every  person is
subject to, and equal before, the law, and that no person is above the  law,
are taken very seriously in the USA. The fact that the president of the  USA,
Bill Clinton, has been the subject of a criminal inquiry by an Independent
Counsel attests to the observance of the principles of the rule of law in that
country. An American student in my &quot;Courts and Criminal Procedure&quot; class once
expressed frustration with, and despair over, the USA criminal justice system.
She asked me if I could think of anything good in that system. I pointed out
to  her that no matter how bad the system was, I believed that she should be
happy  with two main things: the openness of criminal proceedings in the USA;
and the  observance of the rule of law in the country. These two qualities
greatly impact  on &quot;due process&quot;25 in the country's official justice system.
Contrasting the  situation in the USA with what obtains in Nigeria, I reminded her
of the  importance of these issues in the machinery of justice. In Nigeria,
due process  has been largely thrown overboard due, in particular, to military
governments  and martial law.26
I prefer not to sympathize with a leader who is required to  account to the
citizens for the leader's policies and actions. After all, I know  of no modern
State in which a person is compelled to be a political leader.  Every such
person assumes the position voluntarily. In most cases, a leader  would have
overtly and spryly pursued the office. Where there is no overt or  energetic
pursuit of a leadership position, a leader who emerges would have  implicitly
sought or angled for the office.
Much has been made of the prior &quot;limited&quot; involvement in  partisan politics
of the leader of the last military junta in Nigeria, General  Abdulsalam
Abubakar.27 Not to be forgotten, however, is the fact that, as the  chief of defense
staff in the obnoxious General Sani Abacha junta, General  Abubakar had
positioned himself to inherit the leadership of Nigeria if  something happened to
Abacha. The fact that Abubakar eventually &quot;accepted&quot; (from  his fellow
generals) Nigeria's leadership should, in no way, dilute Nigerians'  demand for him to
account to them for his policies and actions in view,  particularly, of the
fact that Nigerians did not choose him for that  position.
At a minimum, it is a show of bad faith for a leader to profess  allegiance
to civilized justice only to retain a draconian &quot;safeguard&quot; that  turns the
rule of law on it's head. General Abubakar's &quot;transition to democracy&quot;  was
constantly threatened and in danger of faltering due to the persisting  unjust and
undemocratic environment in Nigeria. Decree No. 2 of 1984, which  allowed the
regime to arrest and imprison, without trial, any person in Nigeria  is
noteworthy:

... no excuse is good enough for retaining the much-  hated Decree Two in the
statute books. A transition to democracy which needs  such a decree to thrive
is merely an admission of bad faith. It follows a view  of life by people in
government [in Nigeria] who must blame ordinary people  for being
undisciplined and for submitting to extortion and powershow.28
I agree. General Abubakar made numerous unfulfilled promises to  abrogate the
Decree No. 2.29

3. THE NEO-COLONIAL POLICY OF RIDDING THE COUNTRY OF ALL  OPPOSITION:
The retention of Decree No. 2 of 1984 by General Abubakar's  regime showed
his willingness to continue the tradition of past (military)  regimes in
Nigeria, which used the obnoxious legislative piece to silence,  suppress, exile, and
get rid of their opposition. This get-rid-of-all-opposition  mentality is a
throwback to the days of British colonization of Nigeria. Since  political
independence from Britain in 1960, most regimes in Nigeria have been  neo-colonial
in character; these regimes have been doing to Nigerians what the  British
can no longer do directly.
As divisive and destructive of a society as this policy is, it  is by no
means peculiar to Nigeria. Across Africa and some other parts of the  world,
forced exile as a form of opposition control is epidemic. As I write this  essay,
the Africanist, social critic, intellectual, writer, Ngugi wa Thiong'o  (Kenyan
native), is in exile in the USA. He was forced out of Kenya by the
neo-colonial regime of Daniel Arap Moi, the Kenyan President. Ngugi wa Thiong'o  loses
a great deal in not being home, but Kenya and Africa lose more in not  having
direct benefit of all that he has to offer Africa's school children and
society.
In Nigeria, this neo-colonial senselessness came to a head with  the coming
to power of Generals Ibrahim Babangida and Sani Abacha. In addition  to the
well documented cases of mysterious disappearances and murders of  political
opponents, the cabal of Generals Babangida and Abacha presided over a  Nigeria in
which some of the country's most notable intellectuals were forced to  exile
themselves in fear for their lives. The 1986 recipient of the Nobel Prize  in
literature, Wole Soyinka, is a good example. He was forced to flee Nigeria
because of his stand against the regime of General Abacha.30 Being forced to
leave, or stay away from, one's homeland is an extreme form of criminalization.
Chinua Achebe, celebrated writer and social critic, who was on a 9-year
self-exile from Nigeria (1990 - 1999), had his books banned from schools in
Nigeria. This amounts to the criminalization of the author. Above that, however,  it
is a criminalization of the students whose education has been short-circuited
by the policy banning the books. A country (whether it is Nigeria, Kenya, or
any  other), in which the neo-colonial policy of getting rid of all
opposition  exists, has nothing more than a regime of half-idiots, rooted in a &quot;culture
of  apemanship and parrotry.&quot;31 Woe betide the country.
The police-state mentality of the Nigerian regimes since  political
independence has been particularly pronounced since 1985, when General  Ibrahim
Babangida overthrew the regime of General Muhamadu Buhari. Babangida  ruled Nigeria
with a mix of lies, trickery, deception, manipulation,  evil-mindedness, and
cheerfulness. When General Sani Abacha, Babangida's chief  of defense staff,
took over the rulership in 1993, Abacha rid himself of  Babangida's cheerfulness
and strengthened the latter's subtlety and  viciousness.
Nigerians who were &quot;free&quot; to go into, and leave from, the  country under
General Abacha's rule had very little room to be truly citizens of  Nigeria. In
December 1997 through January 1998, I visited Nigeria, and spent  over three
weeks there. I was particularly saddened by the crudity of the  Nigerian leaders.
The leaders had chosen to treat our people as criminals even  though the
leaders were the true criminals. At that time, General Sani Abacha  was the leader
of the ruling junta. General Abdulsalam Abubakar was, at the  time, General
Abacha's handpicked Chief of Defense Staff.
During the trip, I visited the Supreme Court of Nigeria in Abuja  on January
2, 1998. I met with the Court librarian, and gave the Court a copy of  my
doctoral dissertation.32 I also had on me a copy of TELL (a weekly  newsmagazine
published in Nigeria), dated January 5, 1998. The lead stories on  the magazine
were, &quot;The Abuja 'Coup',&quot; and &quot;Casualties of June 12: Who Next?&quot;33  The
librarian accepted the copy of my dissertation, but advised me that both my
dissertation and the TELL magazine were &quot;anti-government&quot; materials. She advised
that I hid the magazine copy from view. My dissertation copy, she said, would be
kept in hiding until an &quot;accommodating government&quot; came into office in
Nigeria.  As far as I know, the dissertation copy is still hidden from the Nigerian
public, even though it was written (in the USA) about Nigeria, and primarily
for  Nigerians.
It is this same grossly negative attitude of the Nigerian  regimes that cause
Nigerian scholars and intellectuals to feel criminalized by  their
governments. A quick survey of the academic community in the USA, for  example, reveals
how many of Nigeria's intellectuals have been drained from the  country. As I
write this essay, the brain drain continues. In 1997, a source  once revealed
that there were some 14,000 Nigerian medical doctors in the USA  alone. You
only need to look around at each professional gathering in North  America to
understand how many of Nigeria's best brains have been forced to  leave, or stay
away, from Nigeria by the criminalizing policies and actions of  the Nigerian
regimes. In most cases, these Nigerians are very bright academics  and
professionals, usually in their 30's. A responsible government, even of a
&quot;developed&quot; country, would do its best to tap the resources provided by such
individuals.
Successive Nigerian regimes have, over the years, turned many of  our
educated elite into passport-carrying agents of other nations, particularly  the USA,
Canada, and nations of Western Europe. Beyond some progress in the  chosen
profession, there is not much an exiled intellectual can do in a foreign  land.
In most cases, he or she lives by avoidance - avoidance of being labeled  by
Nigerian government officials as an agent of a foreign country; and avoidance
of being labeled by foreign government officials as an exporter of &quot;Nigerian
crime culture.&quot; Such is the anomic life of the Nigerian intellectual.
It is not easy, if at all possible, while residing outside the  country to
make any meaningful contribution to Nigeria. In the spring of 1997, I  prepared
and sent a research proposal summary to the Nigerian Embassy in New  York. In
the proposal, I explained my plan to conduct a scientific study of the
professional and occupational distribution and characteristics of Nigerian  citizens
in North America and Europe. In particular, I was going to study the  life
circumstances of Nigerians in Britain and the USA. I wanted to ascertain  and
analyze the extent of the contributions of Nigerians to the economies,
politics, society, etc. of the USA and Britain. The findings, I indicated, would  be
useful for the &quot;Vision 2010&quot;34 of the then General Abacha junta. I requested
the person in charge at the Embassy to let me know if I should submit a
detailed  proposal to the Nigerian government. It took a follow-up proposal and two
years  for an Embassy staff to write back and state that &quot;the Consulate does
not have  funds for sponsoring research projects.&quot; The Consulate, as the
representative of  the Nigerian government in the USA, could and should do much more
on the issue  considering the benefits that would accrue to Nigeria from such
a  project.

4. ENDLESS TRANSITIONS, AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE  NIGERIAN SOCIETY AND
ECONOMY:
Nigeria has indeed given the world a new meaning to the  expression
&quot;transition to democratically elected government.&quot; Endless transition  to elected
government has been a part of Nigeria's political history since the  country's
creation by colonial Britain. The British endlessly promised a hand  over to a
government democratically elected by the Nigerian people. The promise  remained
empty for a long time before October 1960. Since Nigeria's political
independence from Britain, the neo-colonial regimes of Generals Yakubu Gowon  (1966 -
1975), Ibrahim Babangida (1985 - 1993), and Sani Abacha (1993 - 1998)  have
been even less honest to Nigerians with their respective transitions to
democratically elected governments. General Gowon even &quot;toyed with the idea of a
military-led one-party system with a civilianized Gowon continuing as head of
state.&quot;35
Generals Babangida and Abacha each toyed with a similar idea.  Contrary to
all reasonable expectations, Babangida opted for a much longer  transition
program36 in order, as the world found out later, for him to continue  as Nigeria's
ruler indefinitely. The brashness of Abacha's desire to succeed  himself as
Nigeria's ruler is well known. That culminated in his &quot;adoption&quot; as  the only
presidential candidate by the five government-approved political  parties in
the country.37 However, before each of the trio could implement his  idea, he
was run out of office by circumstances beyond his control.
Over the years, Nigerians have learned to be suspicious of their  rulers,
especially concerning the process of handing over to an elected  government.
Thus, the transition to elected civilian government of the General  Abubakar
regime was seen as dubious. On numerous occasions, Nigerian civilian  politicians
have, in the hope of military hand over to a democratically elected,  civilian
government, invested time, money, and other resources toward achieving
political offices. These have come to naught because on countless occasions the
military have failed to live up to their promises. The supporters of these
politicians have equally invested in vain.
A consequence of this situation is a lack of commitment to the  transition
process. Another consequence is a quest to win by all means, after  all the
military (the guardians of the process) are dishonest. Thus, various  kinds of
immoral and criminal acts and omissions result from the situation. What  was the
difference among General Babangida's &quot;National Electoral Commission  (NEC),&quot;
General Abacha's &quot;National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECON),&quot; and
General Abubakar's &quot;Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)?&quot; Nothing.
Each was meant to serve the interests of the military and civilian ruling cabal
at the relevant time.
Apart from the damage to the Nigerian psyche by the empty,  deceitful
promises of the rulers, the damage to the country's economy is  staggering. The
history of misrule, incompetence, gross dishonesty, and theft of  Nigeria's
resources by Nigeria's rulers has culminated in the current condition  of a shambled
Nigerian economy. Add to that the expenses surrounding the endless  transition
programs to elected civilian governments and it becomes clear that  Nigeria's
economy has been bleeding. National resources, which should have been  spent
to improve the lives of all Nigerians, were spent on dubious transition
programs.
In a country where the rulers never account to the ruled for  public expenses
and policies, we can only hazard a guess as to the material cost  to Nigeria
of the General Babangida transition fiasco. The cost must have been  in the
equivalent of billions of dollars. Most of that cost must have been  diverted
into the private pockets of the rulers and their cronies.
General Babangida eventually stopped his transition program  before it
concluded. He refused to hand over to the elected government of  Moshood Abiola.
Instead, Babangida nullified the results of the elections with  no explanation.
That was, at best, an irresponsible, mad, dictatorial, power  show. In the
summer of 1998, the erstwhile dictator told reporters that he was  responsible for
the annulment of the June 12, 1993 elections. In his own  words,

I take the blames. We might have done something that  was seen as wrong, we
might have done other things that is[sic] conceived as  right, but in all these
I don't shift blames on anybody, I take the blames,  that is why I (was) the
chief executive. As chief executive, whatever goes  good I accept. Whatever
goes bad I take the blame for it. I delegate  authorities, I don't delegate
responsibilities.38
There has never been any reasonable question as to General  Babangida's full,
complete, and total responsibility for the annulment of the  June 12, 1993
elections in Nigeria. It is unfortunate that, in proclaiming his  responsibility
for the June 12, 1993 Presidential election debacle, General  Babangida chose
to ignore his responsibility for the criminal policies and  actions of the
gutless tyranny he midwifed (General Abacha's regime). Babangida  was (and
remains) responsible for creating Abacha and his cabal. If Babangida  had allowed
Moshood Abiola (late), the winner of the 1993 Presidential  elections, to
assume Nigeria's leadership, there would have been no Abacha, at  least not in the
manner in which Nigerians and the world knew him between  November 1993 and
June 1998. Babangida is directly responsible for Babangida's  criminalizing
policies and actions (and their consequences) against Nigerians.  Further,
Babangida is indirectly responsible for Abacha's criminalizing policies  and actions
(and their consequences) against Nigerians.
By annulling the 1993 elections, General Babangida has delayed,  by a long
time, Nigeria's evolution into a nation where every citizen would be  treated
equally within the bounds of the rule of law and justice. One question  left to
be answered is: &quot;Will Babangida at some point in his life pay for what  he has
done to Nigeria and Nigerians?&quot; The legal action by the Joint Action
Committee of Nigeria (&quot;JACON&quot;), led by its then chairman, the lawyer and civil
rights activist, Chief Gani Fawehinmi, against Babangida39 is a starting point.
Several petitions against General Babangida and his junta are also pending
before the Justice Chukwudifu Oputa Human Rights Panel set up by President
Obasanjo.
The JACON suit was brought to compel Babangida to explain the  annulment of
the elections. According to JACON, without such an explanation,  similar
programs in the country may in the future be terminated on the leader's  whim.
Hopefully, efforts such as those of JACON will force Nigeria's rulers  (civilian
and military) to realize that they cannot perpetrate evil on the  country and
get away with it. On a similar note, the arrest in London of the  former Chilean
military dictator, General Pinochet, is welcome. Hopefully, it  will make the
point to dictators everywhere that they will eventually account  for their
policies and actions, against their citizens and non-citizens  alike.40
Despite Nigeria's enormous human and material wealth, the  country is one of
the poorest in the world. According to the latest UNICEF  report, 64% of
Nigerians live in poverty, while over 16% of the poor &quot;constitute  the core
poor.&quot;41 A condition of extreme deprivation in the midst of plenty in  Nigeria is due
entirely to a history of shameless corruption and brainlessness  on the part
of the country's leaders. In Nigeria, leadership is defined as a  retinue of
common thieves and other criminals who are privileged to steal the  country and
the citizenry dry (see APPENDIX A).
The country's leaders have turned petroleum, which was God's  gift to
Nigeria, into our curse, particularly for the southeastern portion of  the country.
The 1998 gasoline pipeline explosion in the southeastern town of  Jesse
resulted in the deaths of more than 700 Nigerians.42 Most of the victims  were poor
farmers, small traders, and their children. They needed a chance at a  little
money for their daily needs. Instead, they died.
Nigeria's wealth (mostly from petroleum) has been shared among  the members
of the successive banditry regimes in the country (see APPENDIX A).  The
country continues to have a government of thieves, rather than leaders. As  the
world's 6th largest producer of oil, Nigeria should be able to satisfy its  local
demands and still export a sufficient quantity. Instead, most of the oil  from
the country is exported for the benefit of the bandits in governments,  while
ordinary Nigerians are left frantic for petroleum products. Even where the
products are available, the Nigerian regimes have insisted on irresponsible
increases in the prices of petroleum products. In December 1998, the regime of
General Abubakar, without an explanation, increased the cost of fuel by more
than about 120%.43
In the absence of honest and sound policies by the Nigerian  governments for
the management of the country's huge resources, the average  Nigerian is left
to the anomic (or confused) situation of either making a living  in any way
possible or perishing. As a local resident of Jesse community put it  in the
aftermath of the gasoline pipeline explosion and deaths:

This is a tragedy of huge proportions. Our people  have been driven by
deprivation to such a desperate search for livelihood.44
The deprivation condition affects most Nigerians. The situation  is
compounded by the cryptic devaluation of the country's currency (the  Naira).

5. THE DEVALUATION OF THE NAIRA, ADVERSE ECONOMIC  CONDITIONS, AND THE
CONSEQUENCES FOR NIGERIANS:
During his rule over Nigeria (1985 - 1993), General Babangida  implemented
his Structural Adjustment Program (&quot;SAP&quot;). The most visible aspect  of the
policy and program was the cryptic and destructive devaluation of the  Naira. That
program unleashed an inflationary trend previously unknown in  Nigeria. During
those years and since, the Naira has lost its value by more than  9,000%.
Under the General Abdulsalam Abubakar's regime, the Naira devaluation
continued.45 The hyperactivity of the resulting galloping inflation has led to  little
or no purchasing power by Nigerians operating in the country's  economy.
The infrastructural and economic bases, as well as the  political base, of
Nigeria have been debilitated by the successive regimes in  the country,
particularly those of Generals Babangida and Abacha (1985 -  1998). When I visited
Nigeria in December 1997 through January 1998, I  was horrified by the
astronomical increases in the prices of everyday household  commodities over what they
were in 1992. I found out first hand that to prepare  meals that would last a
couple of days for two persons, a lot of money was  needed. My wife and I
spent 1,405:50 Naira to make that possible. How many  Nigerian households can
afford this amount of money every few days? The answer  is: Not many. At the time
I left Nigeria in 1992, the items for the same amount  of food would have cost
no more than 100 Naira. Also during my visit, I once  took 4 people out for
some snacks and drinks. Altogether, we had 4 bottles of  beer, 6 bottles of
non-alcoholic beverage, and 10 small bowls of ugba and kpomo  (local appetizers).
The charge was 1,055 Naira. Again, at the time I left  Nigeria in 1992, I
would have had to pay no more than 80 Naira for those  items.
Not to be forgotten is the prohibitive cost of transportation in  Nigeria.
Even then, Nigeria no longer has motorable roads except in the capital  city,
Abuja. Add to these situations the other economic hardships that Nigerians  face
daily. Based on what I saw and experienced during my trip to Nigeria,  living
in the country is like living in a giant detention camp, with no means of
livelihood, no freedom, and no rights. In these criminalizing circumstances,
therefore, many Nigerians resort to criminal and other deviant means of making a
living, in and out of Nigeria. The most known deviant endeavors of some
Nigerians in recent times include robbery.46 Other deviant behaviors include
drug trafficking,47 illegal migration,48 and the advance fee fraud (popularly
called &quot;419&quot; in Nigeria).49
The &quot;419&quot; scheme is a huge blemish on Nigerians and the  government of
Nigeria. The scheme reaches many corners of the globe. In the  spring of 1998, a
fellow professor at my institution received a letter from one  &quot;Elder Michael
Nana.&quot; The letter, which was dated February 26, 1998, was mailed  in Nigeria to
Cullowhee, North Carolina, USA. The letter was entitled, &quot;REQUEST  FOR
ASSISTANCE - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.&quot; The writer claimed to be an accountant  with the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (&quot;NNPC&quot;), and to have headed an  NNPC
contract awards board. According to the letter, the author had deliberately
overvalued the cost of some contracts by over $36.5m, received the excess
amount, and needed my colleague, &quot;a reliable and reputable person,&quot; to transfer
the money into my colleague's foreign bank account. The author had no foreign
bank account because the &quot;Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws)&quot;
prohibited Nigerian civil servants from opening and/or operating such accounts.  If
my colleague transferred the funds, he would receive 25% of the transferred
sum, while 10% would be set aside for incidental expenses during the transfer.
In the meantime, though, my colleague would need to pay some money to begin
the  process and to show his commitment to the transaction. Well, my colleague
did  not fall for this.
Most of the criminal and deviant behavior of Nigerians, in and  out of
Nigeria, can be traced to the criminalizing circumstances to which the  Nigerian
governments have subjected the citizens. In particular, the prevailing,
crippling economic and political policies and actions of the Nigerian regimes  leave
Nigerians with no choice but to seek alternative (usually, illegitimate)  means
of making a living.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
The Nigeria that was inherited from Britain was an ad hoc  political entity
created to serve the imperialist ends of the British and the  West. It served
them well by enriching the West economically, politically,  socially,
culturally, religiously, etc. The Nigeria that the successive regimes  in the country
have run since political independence remains an ad hoc entity.  Nigerian
governments no longer directly serve the British colonial regime. They  now serve
the local, neo-colonial, hegemonic regimes led by the Balewas,  Ironsis,
Gowons, Mohammeds, Obasanjos, Shagaris, Buharis, Babangidas, Abachas,  and
Abubakars. In this situation, the Nigerian citizen (whether born in Degema,  Sokoto,
Maidugri, Ibadan, Abuja, or somewhere else) is being criminalized by the  people
who claim to be the country's leaders.
Sometimes in the life of a country, its citizens have to make a  crucial
decision. The decision taken has the potential of doing one of three  things: it
may make the country better, it may make the country worse, or it may  leave
the situation as it is. As I write this essay, Nigeria is at crossroads.
Fundamental decisions have to be made regarding the future and leadership of the
country. The decision has to be that of the leaders; but even more so, it has to
be the decision of the citizens. Whatever the decision, it must be one that
will  move Nigeria forward, thus making it better.
In an analysis of the crisis situation in Nigeria, Wole  Soyinka50 aptly
asks, &quot;When a nation?&quot; Since political independence from  Britain, Nigeria has
been a flag-wielding, political entity, which is far from  being a nation. To
build a nation out of Nigeria, Nigerians need an elected  leadership that
honestly, diligently, and vigorously pursues the interests of  Nigerians, not the
interests of a few. So far, none of the post-independence  regimes or leaders in
Nigeria has been willing to effect the necessary changes  in the Nigerian
society. The situation became particularly bad in Nigeria's  darkest age (1985 -
1999). Even outside this period, most of the Nigerian  leaders have been
recycled products of the same hegemonic, banditry, atavistic  ideology, which has
run Nigeria into the ground.
The main deprivations suffered by Nigerians in the hands of  successive
regimes are economic and political deprivations. Many Nigerians have  reacted to
the deprivations by engaging in criminal and other deviant behavior,  in and out
of Nigeria. The way out of this despondent quagmire is for all  Nigerians to
participate vigorously in the struggle for a true nationalist  leader who will
put Nigerian citizens first. When we succeed, we will have an  opportunity to
end the deprivations suffered by Nigerians. Then, Nigeria will be  a country
in which the citizens have a sense of belonging, a country in which  the great
human and natural resources are meticulously harnessed for the good of  all
citizens, a country in which the citizens are not exploited and criminalized
by their leaders, a country in which the rule of law, justice, and
accountability by public officials are entrenched. Then, Nigeria will become a  nation.
