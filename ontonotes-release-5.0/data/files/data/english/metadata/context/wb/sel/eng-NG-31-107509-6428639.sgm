My setup:

1.  Audio Technica AT2020 microphone.  XLR.
2.  Shure Popper Stopper
3.  M-Audio Audio Buddy mic preamp and direct box.
4.  Audacity.
5.  Record to laptop.
6.  Sennheiser HD 212Pro headphones.
7.  Libsyn for content hosting.
8.  Blogger for links to content on Libsyn and website.
9.  Word Press to create website with content hosted on Libsyn.

Does this make sense?  Am I missing something here?  I will not be
recording any music, just vocals.

Thanks for any feedback.

:-)

Matthew,

Thanks for taking the time to respond and for sharing your
expertise.  Your question is exactly why I am seeking advice.

I guess a fundamental question is why would I choose a blog as
opposed to a website?  I am not married to either idea but just
wondering what to go with first, why, and how much work would it be
to retrofit if I decide to move to the other at some time in the
future.

One thing I am not clear about is what I call the topography of the
podcast layout.

Here is my thinking:

1. I would use the blog for interaction with listeners.

2. The website would contain a menu of casts and a one or two
sentence description of each show along with some relatively static
information - background, bio.  This site would also have links to
archived shows.  The website would link to the blog and to other
blogs/sites of similar interest.

3.  The blog would have a link to the website if someone is more
curious about the show.

4.  The blog would also have a menu of shows but with just a one to
three word descriptive title for each.  The blog would also contain a
link to the archives mentioned above.

5.  I would publish each new show to both the blog and website.

As I type this it does sound overcomplicated.
What do you think?

Thanks again for your help.

Jerry

Jerry -

Just my opinion, but the only advantage I see with a blog is that you don't
need to know any of the code necessary to build a website, you can just choose
a template and get going.  I've got two podcasts and created websites for each
of them.  I'm a Webmaster, so writing the code was considerably easier than
dealing with the limitations of a template, so place that into the mix.  I
wrote a series of administrative programs that makes it very easy for me to
place information onto the websites.

And I think that that is really the most important thing - make it easy for
yourself.  If you shudder when thinking about the work required to maintain a
website, then a blog template would probably be the easiest way to go.  You
really don't want this end of things to become a chore for you - your energy is
better devoted to creating a great podcast that people want to listen to.

Cheers -

george

If your intention is to have different content on the blog that is a great
idea. So many podcasters do not have a blog that is relevant to the topic of
their podcast, and I think they are missing out on a great opportunity to
enhance their listeners experience, while getting more listeners in the
process. I think if you combine the 2, it might confuse people, and make
podcast posts harder to find, since they usually come out less frequently
than text posts. The more great content you have to offer, the more
potential readers/listeners you can attract. Not to mention that search
engines will like your site better if you have consistent and relevant
content.

To me their 3 types of people. Those who prefer audio, those who prefer
text, or those who prefer both. I prefer text, because it is easier to get
the information quickly. I listen to podcasts when I have the time. My
favorite podcast, Slice of Scifi, has a site that is updated constantly with
relevant news regarding the genre the podcast is based on, so I subscribe to
both feeds.

Another of my favorites, DIY Endeavours, is hosted by Matt Selznick, and he
has a blog as well. I subscribe to both as well.

Remember, that if you want to grab your audience to both sites, the content
must be able to coexist with each other, or you risk alienating them. Don't
have a blog about tinker toys, and them tell them to listen to your podcast
about Swedish meatball making.

Also, having a podcast on Wordpress is one of the best things you could do.
Do you use the Podpress plugin?

:-)  You hit on it.

I believe it's a "best practice" that we make our users do as little
work as possible to get and interact with our content. Because there
are so many choices for a listener, they will naturally gravitate to
those sites / podcasts that are easiest to use.

So!

With WordPress (especially with the PodPress plugin) there is no
reason to have more than one website.

WordPress uses Categories to organize your site.  It's very easy to
create a category called "Podcasts," for example, and use the feed to
that category as your podcast-only feed.  Your podcast is, in truth,
just a blog post with a media file attached -- by putting all the
podcast posts in the same category, you eliminate the need to have a
different solution for blog and podcast.   Does that make sense?

You can take a look at my personal site, which servers many purposes
-- including hosting my occasional personal podcast, Sonitotum.

This is a WordPress site.  The RSS feed for my blog (not my podcast) is
http://www.mattselznick.com/scribtotum/?feed=rss2
The RSS feed for Sonitotum (the podcast -- technically part of the blog) is
http://www.mattselznick.com/scribtotum/category/new-media/podcasts/so...

One site, with blog, podcast, static pages, and more -- and one stop
for my users.

Lots of folks on this list use a similar set-up... and I've helped
many clients set things up like this, as well.  Contact me off-list if
you'd like to contract me for direct help... and feel free to keep the
questions coming here on the list, as well!

Wordpress and Blogger are both blogging platforms.  Both provide
content via dated posts, both will let people leave comments to
interact with you, etc.  The major differences from a podcast
perspective are that Wordpress offers more podcast-friendly features
(including the Podpress plugin) and is installed on your own site,
while Blogger is simpler and you have to use their site.

It really is redundant to have both.  There's nothing Blogger can do
that Wordpress can't.

I was gonna say, that the only thing Blogger has going for it is that it is
free. Having your own Wordpress install is best.

But I still stand by my opinion that if you have more informative content
that is not in podcast format, it should be separate. If not on another
blog, at least from the podcast feed. Although, some podcatchers only see
the shows because it has the attachment. But you should give your
listeners/readers a choice. I would be hard pressed to subscribe to a
podcast if the latest show was hidden in between a bunch of blog posts.

I believe the last phrase here is incorrect (not that I'm
recommending Blogger over WP):

Wordpress is free too.  If you don't feel like doing your hosting, you
could get an account at http://wordpress.com -- it'd give you pretty
much as much for podcasting as a Blogger account would.

I view this as a matter of pure opinion.  I don't disagree with you,
but I don't think there's a right or wrong way.  I ran SF/F news on
the Escape Pod blog for a while (thanks Mur!) and nobody complained.
Nobody loved it either, and I eventually decided it wasn't worth the
effort, but I don't think it hurt the feed.

It's also pretty easy with Wordpress to keep everything in one blog
but promote category-specific feeds to keep your podcast episodes
separate.  So it's not like there's really a gain in maintaining
separate sites.

It is, but does it have Podpress? Last time I checked, it did not. But that
was some time ago.
