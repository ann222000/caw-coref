Who's happy with their computer's internal software DVD player?
Not me.  This CyberLink Power DVD garbage that came with my XP
machine is about to send me running down the halls screaming.
God how I despise it.

I need a player that will play factory original disks in the
computer's DVD drive, as well as decrypted files from the hard
drive.  If you have such a software DVD player you're happy with,
please tell me about it so I can try it.

You need a video card in orrder to be able to quickly and easily play
a commercial DVD on your computer. I don't recommend playing DVDs on
your computer, though -- the computer display is too different from a
regular TV. A computer monitor is digital while a TV is analog; a
computer monitor is non-interlaced and typically runs at 75 to 80 or
even  90 hz refresh rate, while a TV runs at a refresh rate of 29.97
interlaced frames (59.94 fields) per second with a vertical blanking
interval that contains closed captioning info etc. A computer monitor
has an entirely different color temperature from an analog TV,
sepecially if you've got an LCD monitor; and a computer monitor is
much dimmer with a far lower range of bright to dark than a typical
analog TV set.  Lastly, the analog nature of standard def TV produces
some nice aliasing
that smooths the picture pleasantly and gives a subtl egradated look
to color and contrast changes. Whereas a computer monitor will show
you all kinds of jaggies and pixelated block artifacts on near-
monocrhomatic backgrounds and near-vertical or near-horizontal lines
of sharp luma contrast.  To put it bluntly, DVDs typically look very
good on a DVD player through a standard def analog TV. They look
fairly crappy on a typical DVD player through a digital hi def TV.
They look pretty poor through a computer software DVD player on a
computer monitor. The reverse hodls true, though -- downloaded divx
files typically look much _better_ played on a computer through a
computer monitor than they do a TV. It ain't magic, it's just commons
ense -- divx files were encoded to be played on computer monitors and
are designed to be seen that way so they look best that way, while TV
shows are designed and broadcast to be played on a standard def TVs
and look best that way.

To decrypt a DVD you need freeware, easily available from the net.
DVDDecrypter or DVDFAbDecryptor or Ripit4me or Smartripper are the
obvious choices.

I have Cyberlink Power DVD and I haven't noticed any problem using it.  I
like it, in fact.  However, I *did* have a lot of difficulty trying to edit
disks with the Producer app that came with it.  My computer had no DVD
burner when I bought it.  The Cyberlink stuff came with the burner I bought
and added on.  I read all of electrohome's explanation, and I probably agree
with him, but it's mor ethan I care to worry about.

That's my .02

Thanks... but you're doing it again :)  I asked what time it is,
and you spent twenty minutes telling me how a clock works!

I just want a recommendation for a software DVD player, not a bunch
of reasons why I shouldn't be watching DVDs on my computer.  Good
grief!  And besides, I do not watch DVDs on my computer.  I test
drive them after I author them but before I burn them.  Why am I
explaining myself?

?!?!?!?!! What did that have to do with what I asked about?  You
know perfectly well I'm familiar with these decrypting tools, so
why even mention them here?

Would someone please offer an actual ANSWER?

I repeat:  If you're happy with your computer's internal software

Possibly so you could narrow the problem down.  eg.  Is it just *you* or is
it *Cyberlink*.  The fact that I am a satisfied customer *might* indicate

I have Cyberlink and I agree that it totally sucks.  Have you tried VLC?
I have it set as my default player and I've never had a problem playing
anything with it except .mov and .flv files which you do need other
software for.  VLC lets you play dvds from the drive, dvd images or if
you have the vobs in a folder, just double-click on them one at a time
or load them up in the playlist and have at it.  The best part is it is
a small program, open source and freeware with any number of options for
display and everything else a person might want.

I think Ray is bugged at me, not you, Dave.
VLC is a good media player but it won't play  DVDs. It requires
straight media streams.

Commercial DVDs are encrypted and coded by region -- you need special
software, like Cyberlink or Ravisent or or several other pieces of
software, to interface with the DVD-ROM or DVD burner and detect the
region setting and verify that your disc is playable, and then decrypt
the CSS scrambling on the DVD.

IN ohter words, becuase of the B.S. encryption (which is worthless nad
which everyone can break), commercial DVDs are very hard to play on a
computer and require very specialized software like Ravisent Cinemaste
or Freebobr

VLC and other straight media players like The Core Media Player are
designed to play unecnrypted streams of audio and video. If you rip a
VOB to your hard drive from a DVD after decrypting it and then convert
it to an MPG file, VLC will play it just fine. If you just copy a VOB
from the commercial DVD to your hard drive, VLC will play scrambled
junk.

Even if you have an unencrypted non-commercial DVD you burned yourself
on a DVD recorder, Ravisent or Freebob or Ravisnet are typically
needed to play it. The data on a DVD is arranged in a special manner
and you need a specialized program to recognize and play it.

I haven't had any particular problems with DVD player software either,
other than region coding, and the fact that the DVD player software
has to thrash and flail around on your hard drive for an ungodly
amount of time before playing a DVD. That's annoying. But because a
computer was never designed to play DVDs, it's inevitable. You need to
buffer a lot of video data before playing can start because activity
on the hard disk and keyboard &amp; mouse etc. tends to interrupt the DVD
playback function, so llts of video data has to be buffered to insuree
uninterrupted playback.

Once again I'm sure Ray will hate all this detail. But there is a
reason why a software DVD player is slower and clunkier than a
hardware DVD player. A silicon chip always works a lot faster than
software. .

Yes, it will.  I'm playing one right now.  However, your post did remind
me that I also have dvd region &amp; css free installed which does take care
of the region lock and encryption on commercial dvds.  Since I install
that pretty much automatically whenever I get a new computer I can't say
for sure how VLC handles commercial dvds if it (or something like it) is
not installed, although, according to their forums, decryption is built
directly into the program, so that actually shouldn't be an issue at all.

In other words, I can verify 100% that VLC will play commercial dvds
directly from the dvd drive as well as dvd .iso disk images (which it
can also open directly so you don't have to mount the .iso  before
playing) and mpg/vob files on the HD.  I've just tried all of them and
everything started within seconds no fuss, no bother no long wait while
it processes.

If you rip it to vob, you don't have to convert it or rename it to
mpeg/mpg for VLC to play it.  VLC will play the vob file directly
without you having to do anything except open it by clicking on it or
opening it from the open file menu.  I do this all the time so I know it
works.

Which VLC is.  I just tested it with a dvd I know was burned in a
standalone recorder and again it opened right up.  It even plays a
homemade dvd disk I have that has a video_rm as well as a video_ts
folder that I can't get any standalone dvd player to play without
converting the files to standard dvd format.

I'm not Ray, but I am the one who suggested VLC.  I recommended it
because I know what it does.  And what it does is play just about
anything you throw at it.  Including, and perhaps especially, standard
commercial and homemade dvds.

Your experience is different from mine. When I try to play a DVD
direclty from a DVD burner, VLC crashes and the process has to be

There is no doubt that different computers can have vastly different
experiences with the same programs.  Most people have no problem running
Nero for conversion and burning, but it disagrees extremely with my dvd
burner.  Luckily, with a little experimentation I've found the right
combo of freeware that does everything I require.  I'm just sorry that
the dvd function of VLC doesn't work for you since that is a big part of
its functionality.

I don't hate detail.  In fact, I appreciate the detail you went
into recently when I asked about search and rescue missions :)

Deep breath.  Here goes:  I want a good software DVD player to test
drive the navigation of my own authors before I burn them.  I also
like to test drive commercial disks I'm backing up, to explore the
structure and to run through the extra features &amp; nag screens in
order to decide what to eliminate.  I'd rather do this on the
computer than in my standalone DVD player because I'm watching some
cool movie and don't want to interrupt it three times in the course
of two hours just to test drive several different DVDs for two
minutes each.

There.  I could have said all that in my original post, I guess,
but it never occurred to me to explain all the reasons that I was
asking for what I was asking for.

Look, everyone, I apologize for getting a little bit tense.  It
tends to happen when I feel like a voice in the wilderness :)  So
let's not nobody have no hard feelings over this, please?

Whew!

VLC has no problems with PAL which makes up about 75% of what I watch.

dvd region &amp; css free is payware but worth it for me.  It's made by
dvddab.com which as far as I can tell is also dvdidle.com.  AnyDvd is
basically the same thing, some people would argue it is better but I
don't think I've ever used it so I don't know.

There are a few freeware alternatives -- you probably know about this
site, but it is always my goto place for finding this kind of software
and basically anything else related to ripping, burning, converting etc.
The forums are especially invaluable:

http://www.videohelp.com (general site)
http://www.videohelp.com/tools/sections/region-free-tools

This is going off on a bit of a tangent, but actually as far as I can
tell the region free and the anti-protection are really two different
things aren't they?  The region free really has to be associated with
the particular dvd drive/s because the region lock is built into the
hardware if I understand it correctly.  If you are daring you can
(sometimes) override it with a firmware flash, or you can get the
software that will either allow unlimited switches or just plain region
free.

The anti-protection really doesn't have to be installed at the same time
as the region free since it will by necessity be installed with your
ripper whether you use dvdshrink, dvd decrypter, dvd fab decrypter or
whatever.

Since I do mostly conversion from dvd to .avi, I tend to open the vobs
one by one using file open since they are the only thing from the
VIDEO_TS folder I'll be using, but I can also confirm that if you want
to test the structure of your authored and compiled disk prior to
burning, you can use directory open on the VIDEO_TS file and it should
open right at your menu.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Exactly.

Absolutely.  The region is a single byte that tells a player
whether or not it can play a given disk.  This is to keep disks
from one part of the world out of the market in another part of the
world.  The copy protections used are a whole different sport.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

It's built into the firmware, which is supposedly halfway between
software and hardware.  It's really just a few bytes of memory that
can be overwritten with a flash.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;(sometimes) override it with a firmware flash, or you can get the

Yep.  No daring required, really.  The manufacturers of drives
build in a limit of five times that you can change the region code.
A firmware flash resets this counter, as well as other variables.
I used firmware flashes many times when I was new, until I figured
out that I didn't need to worry over any of that, the region or
copy protection or the AnyDVD layer.

Yeah... it's starting to sound, given the way I do things, that I
don't need either one.  When I want to back up a commercial disk I
always decrypt it to my hard drive, then browse it with a software
DVD player as I've already mentioned.  At this point it's already
region and protection free, before VLC will ever see it.  I can't
remember the last time I wanted to browse a commercial disk -
regardless of region or copy protection - from the computer's DVD
drive.

Very!

I found VLC 0.8.5 which is an .exe installer, but it's about a year
old; the latest VLC 0.8.7c is a &quot;7 Zip&quot; with the .7z extension and
I don't have anything to unzip it.  I'm browsing for that now.
Ace, Arj, Rar, Tar, Zip, GZip... if you know of a download link
that doesn't require me to hunt down a 93rd #%$@*&amp; compression
format, please let me know, otherwise I'll sort it eventually.

Now that I've read a little more about it, I think I am in the same
boat.  I only put commercial dvds in my dvd drive to make back-ups and I
never use my computer screen for primary viewing.  Of course, now that I
have everything installed I'll leave it since my system is stable and
I'm always worried about upsetting the balance, but next time I probably
won't bother.

It looks like all the top mirrors are self-extracting .exe

Just a word about 7-zip since I also use it (I feel like I'm saying that
a lot in this thread!).  I downloaded it a year or so ago when someone
on one of my lists circulated the best open source freeware to replace
payware and trial ware and stuff.  It opens just about all compressed
files out there including rars and zips.  If you ever want to try it out
here it is.  It's just over 800kb.

http://www.7-zip.org/

Again on a tangent and having nothing to do with vid files, but I've
also switched over to using Foxit reader for pdfs instead of Acrobat
since Acrobat takes freaking forever to open and is a resource hog while
Foxit is tiny (under 2 mb)  and does just about everything acrobat but
with a lot less hassle.  I know finding all this new software is a big
pain, but I like using open source whenever I can and passing on the
names of good programs to others.

Ok, I'm testing it on a home-authored dvd.  It looks like I have to
initially place the cursor in the menu area (that is to say anywhere
withing the VLC window) and then I can navigate through the whole menu
up and down and side to side using the arrow keys and then enter to make
the selection.

There is both a menu button on the main window in the lower right next
to the forward and and backward chapter skip.  Pause, stop, ff, rw are
located at the top under the main menu area.  There is also a slider bar
across the bottom so you can jump right to a particular point.  The time
lapsed/time left counters are right there as well.  You have several
options for navigation.  You can use the navigation drop-down menu at
the top to go back to the menu, choose what track, chapter or title you
want to play, you can also right click on the screen and a menu will
come up with the navigation functions as well as the audio and video
functions.  You can switch back and forth between multiple audio tracks
and audio channels on the fly (you have to use the mouse to do that as
far as I can tell) as well as all sorts of video tricks that you may or
may not be interested in like forcing it to show interlaced files
deinterlaced so it won't look like crap on the computer screen.

I think submenus are no problem.  Once the cursor is initially placed in
the window, you can navigate to any button on any screen with the arrow
keys and enter.

One thing I finally figured out after going through all the rigmarole of
changing aspect ratio whenever I switched between 4:3 and 16:9 vids was
that I could just leave it at one or the other and use the aspect ratio
submenu under the video menu at the top instead.  The first setting
listed is default which looks directly at the  video file and displays
it according to how it is encoded.  If the video is encoded correctly it
shows it at the right size, if it was encoded at the wrong aspect ratio
and I can tell right away which is sometimes very useful.

Now I'm looking at a commercial dvd.  The thing is, in most cases it
seems to ignore the nag screens entirely and just open right at the main
menu.  I put the same disk in my standalone (Philips 3960 with the
region hack that I can sometimes use to skip pre-menu crap) and it opens
with the FBI warning before going to the menu.  To be extra sure, I just
tried an evil disk in my standalone (region 2 version of Cold Feet
season 3, God knows why I bought it) that has almost two minutes of
completely unskipable crap including an entire flipping commercial for
British Airways that comes up before the main menu every time I put the
disk in.  Stuck it in VLC and voila, the first and only thing that comes
up is the main menu.  No copyright notice, no this is a dvd notice, no
Granada self-congratulation and most important NO COMMERCIAL!!!

With commercial dvds played right from the dvd drive (which I hardly
ever play), the only problem I've ever encountered is if the dvd has
dvd-rom content as well as the video files.  The video files still play
fine, but the menu functions (i.e. showing the main menu first instead
of just having the first video track play) aren't as smooth as they are
with a non dvd-rom content dvd.   Obviously, the answer to that is to
rip the dvd first and reauthor with just the video content which I am
sure would take care of the problem.  Of course if you do that, you can
also get rid of all the nag stuff at the same time which I always take
great pleasure in doing.
