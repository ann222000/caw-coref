Horary Chart Data - 24 July, 2005, 00:39 AM, LT, DST, 81w57, 26n34.

Asc -- 27 Ari 01 - too late for a judging.

Lydia's sig -- Ven - 1 Leo, 5th of chart, 11th of hers - playing and/or
w friends.
Ven is VoC for the Horary, not having any major asp w a traditional,
though I confess that the future op to an Rx Ura and the future sq to an
Rx Plu, look ominous enough to attract my attn.

Mo, ruler of chart's 4th and Lydia's 10th, her public stand, is
practically VoC for a Horary, since she has ahead in course only a sq to
Plu, a non-traditional, not to be considered.

Mo had just had an op to Ven, ruler of missing girl.

Outcome - With *all the caution* and though not to be judged b/c of the
"too late" situation of chart, the Mo's past op to Ven, Lydia's ruler
(which reinforces, somehow, the chart), tells me that the "too late" is
just what it says: "too late".

I am of the opinion that she had been abducted while playing w friends,
near home, it seems.

She is in a spacious and conspicuous or central place, or in a place for
children, in the quadrant of NE and NNW from home.

Though I'm not sure that this is feasible, since I'm not in her house
asking the q, I'll still try to calculate the distance from her home (as
if the q was asked from her home and so the distance will be from her
home).

According to Jacobson, Ven being in N Decl. and in a succedent h, the
coefficient of multiplication will be 2 and so she is:
[Mar (my sig) - Ven] x 2 = (27 - 1) x 2 = 26 x 2 = 52 miles of distance
from home.

This is an epidemic, here in the US, the sexual predators and their
innocent victims. Too many in a too short time span. I am profoundly
shocked.

Yes. Interestingly, while we've always had such horror stories from time
to time, it seems that the sheer number of these incidents have
dramatically increased since the start of this year. To our shame, it's
something I believe to be unparalleled in any other country, civilized
or not.

One can only wonder if they are "born that way" or at what kind of
forces are at work in our society to so warp and twist a man's mind and
nature into the incomprehensible "need" to perform such unspeakably evil
acts.
If the latter, it's not only shocking, but symptomatic of a profoundly
disordered society that may well be in the early stages of dissolution.

-- It may sound a bit extreme and I may annoy some, for which I
apologize in advance, but w all the respect I have for my American
friends, and I do, I live w one, I do think that the American society
evolved into one which is Amoral.

Once, and I heard this very intelligent maxim from my wife, it was
Moral, maybe too much so when the Puritans ruled.Then, it turned into an
Immoral society. Now, it is Amoral.

I think it's no wonder. When everyone is entitled to speak his piece
just b/c he so wishes and he's free to do it, w/o ever thinking about
the wider implications of it, and when diversity and relativism are the
words of the day, then the personal and the local have the upper hand to
the disadvantage of the larger society.

In addition, when the personal responsibility is something which is
hushed away and swept beneath the carpet just not to offend the weaker
or the less talented, then the individual is left w/o boundaries in a
state of personal chaos regarding norms and rules and limits concerning
the broad society and him.

Add to this an unlimited porn market of selling and buying, and there
you are.

abused themselves as children. You would be surprised at how many
victims of incest I have passed paths with in my life. One of my
employees said every woman he dated for several years had been victims
of incest.  He even ended up marrying one.

I think a lot of it is just finally making it into the media linelight
and notice is being paid. There were fewer child abuse agencies/workers
in the past and a lot of times the children were simply not believed. I
think so much of it has been kept in the closet and it is finally
surfacing to the general public through some of the very public
horrendous murders.

The only way to stop these guys is to save them from the torturing
homes they were and are being raised in as children presently, IMO. It
is self-propitiating through generations from early childhood abuse.

There must be an asteroid (or configuration) that mirrors all this
child rape/murder issues coming forth into light this year more than
before. I just wonder which one? Or maybe it is Chiron at the end of
Cap to 0 Aqua opp Saturn in Leo, and with BML there maybe?

Well, while I thank you for it,  I'm afraid I don't quite grasp your
point there. I have always thought that the right and freedom of every
citizen to speak his mind - yes,  just because he wishes - can only be a
positive thing for any nation. I certainly wouldn't want to live in an
environment where I was told what to think and what to say for the
common good (I have a strong Uranus:-)
I will never understand the rationale of the so called "Patriot Act",
that says in effect that we should sacrifice important parts of our long
cherished liberty in the interests of "Homeland Security." The *more*
freedom I have, the safer I feel.
Probably what you mean is that films, tv, etc., have overstepped your
ideas of what is in society's best interests. The problem there is that
one person's "too much" is another's "not enough." In the end, one has
to exercise personal responsibility over the type of entertainment,
media, etc. he is exposed to.
I also have no problem with diversity. Our country, in particular, has a
long history of many diverse peoples and philosophies. This seems
healthy to me. As long as one is not infringing on the rights of
another, each has the right to be a nonconformist individual.  What is
the alternative - a sort of National Socialist Germany - noted for  the
folk  being unified as one? Again, who determines the "right" way to be?
No thanks, I'd rather decide that myself.
I can't see any of these things as being significantly contributory to
the dreadful maladjustment of some members of society.
However, the question remains, what *is* the cause?
Hopefully, astrological, or other research can one day identify, from
birth or childhood, those predisposed to antisocial behavior, and
special effort be made to insure that these individual's energies be
kept wholesome and moral.
BTW, it's interesting that it *is* in our current, more governmentaly
repressive era and climate of fear that the cases of child molestation/
murder etc., are more in evidence.

I agree perfectly w freedom of speech, let there be no doubt about it.
Let everyone talk his fill.

What I'm saying and aiming to, is the floating of personal ideas as
pieces of sheer geniality, W/O thinking about and giving the right
import to their place in the greater fabric of society.

For ex.: Some parents give money to their kids for doing chores in the
house, w the explanation that any worker gets paid.

Now, a family is a tight knot w a full range of mutual responsibilities
on the part of each member of this group. To pay your kids b/c they do
their part in this social fabric, is obscene.

The worst part of it, IMO, is that there will always be some who will
think of such notions as the best they had ever come upon, revolutionary
and very progressive, when in fact the opposite is true.

So, here, the blind leads the lame.

This is what I meant.

Yes, I can. I have lived in Japan for 8 out of the last 11 years &amp; I
used to hear about this kind of stuff in the news there too. In fact, I
have  seen things in Japan, that I don't think I will ever see happen in
the US.

Also, remember, I have just completed 20 years in the Navy. In that 20
years I have lived, worked, &amp; played in over 15 different countries on
five out of the seven continents.

You are correct, I cannot say that this happens everywhere, but I CAN
say that it happens everywhere that I have been. The difference is, that
most places I have been would not allow such news to reach international

I really didn't understand that paragraph, except that
you're very much against giving children money for most
reasons.

I just think there are some important things children can
learn around the handling and value of money (whether it's
allowance or earning it) that wouldn't destroy the fabric of
society. It seems way out of proportion to use the word
'obscene'.

&gt; &gt; LOL, my boys are angry because I say they should NOT get paid for
&gt; &gt; doing chores.

&gt; &gt; 1) I should not have to pay my children to listen to me when I tell
&gt; &gt; them to do something. I've never been a big fan of bribery.

&gt; &gt; 2) Since it IS family, I think they should be helping out as family,
&gt; &gt; not as &quot;workers&quot; collecting a salary. They are &quot;doing their part&quot; for
&gt; &gt; the family good and should not expect payment for it. After all, I
&gt; &gt; don't ask them to pay me for their food, their clothes, etc.

&gt; &gt; 3) LOL, finally, they should do it &quot;because I'm the Dad &amp; I say so&quot;.

IRH:
. . . and those kids will eventually appreciate their upbringing, as my
daughter does, who recently said to her kids when asked why they could not
have this, that and the other,  "do you have money to get it ??  No ?? you
don´t have any money, neither do I for that. You *want* it ?  Tja, but I´m
here for your *needs* and not for your *wants*."
Her boys are 7 and 4 1/2.  They already have understood - reluctantly, of
course.
The other day, the older "raided" her purse and hid the money. When I talked
to him and explained that this was/is food money, for "his" whole family, he
went and gave it back to his mom - of course also reluctantly :-)
Now he "is looking forward" to be able to make his own money - - so he said
:-)
All in all, children have a _right_ to get the guide lines - from us, the
parents, the elders. Guide lines they will be able to use within our
(extended) society.
Giving them what we did not have when we were young, because we believe
"they should have it better than we did" is not always such a good idea, as
the problem arises in most families who are faced with the wanting of more
and more, we ask ourselves "when and where do we set the limit" ?? When are
we not able any more to "provide" all those extra "wants", not the "needs"
?? - -

BUT - this all has not brought us back to the missing little girl Lydia and
what could possibly have happened to her.
Has anyone heard anything new ??

Be well,
I.R.Heller

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Now, a family is a tight knot w a full range of mutual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;responsibilities
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;on the part of each member of this group. To pay your kids b/c they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their part in this social fabric, is obscene.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As opposed to, say, just giving them an allowance?

&gt;&gt;-- Look, Ken, we obviously have our very deep diff's in everything
&gt;&gt;that
&gt;&gt;has something to do w common sense, no offense, but yes, as opposed to
&gt;&gt;it. Why? B/c when you give your kids an allowance, the you're
&gt;&gt;*giving*,
&gt;&gt;you're the generous parent acknowledging tehir needs as any otehr
&gt;&gt;need,
&gt;&gt;while when you pay them, God forbid, it sucks, no need to explain why,
&gt;&gt;it's self-explanatory. To me, at least.

&gt; you're very much against giving children money for most

-- First of all, I'm not. Secondly, I gave them pocket-money, as we call
it in Isr, when and how much I saw fit, but didn't pay them for doing
in-house chores. THIS IS obscene b/c it's bribery, as Todd defined it
very aptly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I just think there are some important things children can

It seems way out of proportion to use the word

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 'obscene'.

-- No, it's not, and here you prove the permissiveness of the modern
western society which brings it to it's destructive edge, and I don't
think I'm a prophet of doom.

When kids "run" the family, as is the case in so many instances which we
hear and witness, this is obscene, like when they aren't asked where had
they been, w whom, what did they do, etc., b/c parents are afraid of the
wild and histerical and angry reaction of the kid.

Paying them for cleaning and tidying, is giving in to them and bribing
them. Next time, they say "Pay or I don't play your game".

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I don't think it's an epidemic in the US. I think it happens

&gt; &gt;&gt; -- I have no proof for it, but I don't think &quot;it happens everywhere &amp;
&gt; &gt;&gt; has been for a very long time&quot;. Neither do you for your statement.
&gt; &gt;&gt; But,

&gt; &gt; Ok, you are correct. Let me amend my statement. I KNOW this sort of
&gt; &gt; thing is not &quot;unique&quot; to the US. The US is not the only place this
&gt; &gt; stuff happens and I'm &quot;pretty sure&quot; it has been happening for a long
&gt; &gt; time.

&gt; &gt;&gt; victim, sometimes alive. You cannot tell me that you heard of it
&gt; &gt;&gt; before, certainly not abroad.

&gt; &gt; Yes, I can. I have lived in Japan for 8 out of the last 11 years &amp; I
&gt; &gt; used to hear about this kind of stuff in the news there too. In fact,
&gt; &gt; I have  seen things in Japan, that I don't think I will ever see
&gt; &gt; happen in the US.

&gt; &gt; Also, remember, I have just completed 20 years in the Navy. In that 20
&gt; &gt; years I have lived, worked, &amp; played in over 15 different countries on
&gt; &gt; five out of the seven continents.

&gt; &gt; You are correct, I cannot say that this happens everywhere, but I CAN
&gt; &gt; say that it happens everywhere that I have been. The difference is,
&gt; &gt; that most places I have been would not allow such news to reach
&gt; &gt; international ears.

&gt; &gt; Todd

&gt; -- I cannot argue w what you saw and lived, but *my pt* is that it's not
&gt; so widespread abroad as in the US, and there are sociological reasons
&gt; for it, the biggest being the permissiveness of the US society in all
&gt; domains of life in the name, mainly, of personal freedom, which is
&gt; widely misinterpreted and misused.
">

The US is nowhere near as permissive as, say, the Scandinavian
countries. It isn't permissiveness that is the problem. I wish you'd
drop this particular line of thinking; it's not productive. The US is
just another Western country, and in most Western countries, child abuse
and pedophilia are on the increase, but so is our awareness of it and
desire to curb it.
