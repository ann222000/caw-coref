Time for the next logical brain-fart in the case of the anti-
christian.

Some want you to believe that the Bible was written hundreds of years
after the time Christ was to have lived.  In fact, they want you to
believe that the whole thing is fiction.  According to them, there
never was a Christ or Peter or Paul, and the whole thing was just made
up long, long after the suggested events' timeframe.

Here is one logical hiccup, though, that brings their whole house of
cards crashing down.  Hundreds of years after the time of Christ, the
church was no longer highly Jewish.  It was almost completely
Gentile.  According to Scripture, Christianity started with Christ (a
Jew), apostles (Jews) and first century Jewish believers.  Then, part
of the way through the book of Acts, Gentiles can finally get saved.
In fact, throughout the Gospels, Jesus makes some statements about
being sent ONLY to the Jews.

In fact, in the hundreds of years after Christ, Jewish groups had
become, themselves, a threat to Greek and Roman society.

So, why would a false religion choose to preach to a Gentile audience
and pick a Jew (their enemy) to be the way to Eternal Life?  Why would
they write Gospels that said Jesus was sent only to Jews, if they
wanted to attract non-Jews as converts?  Why wouldn't they pick a
Gentile figure to attract Gentile believers, and, instead, pick a
Savior of the race that the Caesars', themselves, disapproved of?

Anyone?

Quite a distortion of what "they" say, as usual.

Of course.

That was pretty much true after 100 AD simply because at that point
anyone who was Christian was defined by the Jews to THEREBY be
Gentile.

I don't believe that we know what percentage of Christians in 60-70AD
were truly "Gentiles" as opposed to converted Jews.  There were after
all a lot of Jews out in the empire.

"Greek society" had already been destroyed by the time of Jesus.
There was a Hellenized culture which used the Greek language, but it
was quite Roman by that same 100 AD.  Some "Jewish groups" were indeed
a threat to Roman society, at least in Palestine where they were
habitually revolting.  But there may have been hundreds of thousands
of Jews in Alexandria, and they never revolted there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

1. In the early days the power of the gospel was the message and not
the ethnicity of the messenger.

2. If anything it was essential that the founder of such a religion
NOT be a member of the power structure, in order to each out for the
other downtrodden.

3.  You make the hidden and false assumption that the "Gentiles" were
some kind of uniform lump of Romanness or Greekness that consider Jews
as an enemy.  Prior to Constantine, the Gentiles that existed were
almost entirely NOT those of the power structure.  Roman citizens were
a minority of the populace of the Roman empire, and even among those
were many who got that citizenship only at the end of their lives
after serving a military career.  The common people of the "Gentiles"
had no particular stake in supporting "Rome" or in opposing "Jews".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Why would
&gt;they write Gospels that said Jesus was sent only to Jews, if they
&gt;wanted to attract non-Jews as converts?
">

Maybe they wouldn't.  Maybe the early Christians were a bunch of
schismatic Jewish and Gentile groups who were initially welded
together into a unity by the schemes of Saul of Tarsus in order to
survive being persecuted both by Jerusalem and by Rome, and who, by
the time they came to writing down the various oral traditions that
had passed down, simply did the best that they could, relying on their
faith rather than a slavish commitment to literalism to produce
"Truth" from what had been spoken in the past.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Why wouldn't they pick a Gentile figure to attract Gentile believers,
">

A rather silly question.  The religion had to be started in order to
be built upon.  Lots of Gentile religions were started.  Pauline
Christianity is the only one that survived, and it did so largely by
murdering those of other religions who refused to convert.  One can
attribute this survival to the Deity, or to the ruthless
unscrupulousness of the early church leaders, or simply to good luck
and timing by one group of faithful who got to write the history books
after things turned out their way instead of some other.

Or some combination of the three.

Your strawman that someone concocted a religion out of whole cloth,
intended for Gentiles and not for Jews, has little to do with anyone's
position.  The initial religion, whatever it was, was almost certainly
originally aimed at Jews.  And it reached outside of Judaism because
it was rejected by the power structure inside Judaism.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;and, instead, pick a Savior of the race that the Caesars', themselves, disapproved of?
">

The emperors (which is what I assume you meant by Caesars - the
Julio-Claudian dynasty ended with Nero, while Christianity was still
seen by Rome as part of Judaism) did not disapprove of the Jews as a
"race"; they weren't Nazi wannebes.  They disapproved of anyone who
revolted against Rome, regardless of their ethnicity.  Jews who
revolted were never a majority of Jews, and the emperors disapproved
of non-Jews who revolted just as much as they approved of Jews who
supported the empire.

But the man on the street probably neither knew nor really cared what
the guy in Rome approved of, so long as he could keep from running
afoul of the minions of the guy in Rome who would kill him if he
didn't render unto Caesar.  And it was the man in the street who
converted to Christianity.

I guess that depends how a person relates to the Messiah.  With all
these assumptions comes many ways to relate to the Christ.  Why be
concerned about this Bible, this Jehovah god at all?  Or Paul.  The
writings are full of parables, many authors, myths, allegories,
ancient wisdom, folkore, imagery, legends, and on and on.

The Heavenly Father is bigger than "just" the jews.
There is a reason the saved are called "God's elect".
