We're almost halfway there, now.  Used to be after a collision
you saw maybe some antifreeze and headlight glass and road dirt
on the intersection.
Now... it's all colorful bits of plastic.

Many years ago a friend was involved with a place in New Jersey
called, I believe, Plastic Motors.  Their goal was to make an
internal combustion engine entirely out of plastic composites.
IIRC, they had a development model running in an Indy car with
a power band waaaaaay up the RPM curve due to the incredibly low
moving mass.

Don't know what happened to them.  Googling for plasticmotors
(with no space) turns up lots of Russian sites, for some reason.

Ehh.... I don't trust plastic. The only advantage is that it doesn't
rust.

Ever see a Trabant after a fender cracker?  Try fixing that bodywork
up.   I'd rather pull dents out of a metal car than have to struggle
with glue or JB Weld to fix up my car..

It's the major thing that makes me avoid Trabis, aside from  the
difficulty of getting parts in the USA.  It sucks, because the car
seems like a mechanically simple device -- easy for a shade tree
mechanic to tinker with on the weekends.

Give me a 1950 to 1970-something Detroit iron monster anytime.  :)

I did read that Trabi's are actually pretty good in the crash safety
department, though.

Actually, they were felt. And fairly easy to fix. Just rough up

Well, tere are two reasons for that. 1. they don't really go that

Not really.  Depending on the impact, the fiberglass composite body
parts attached to steel frame tended to crack and separate into sharp
edged sheets.  Also the car is very light (1400 lbs) and tiny with no
space to absorb the impact so its collision with a larger car was
deadly just like say a collision with Chevy Suburban and Geo Metro
would be.  The car was otherwise primitive with two cylinder, 0.6 L
(36 cu. inch), two-stroke, 25 HP engine, drum brakes on all wheels,
and no safety belts.  I doubt it would ever be allowed to be imported
into US due to safety and pollution issues although a joke used to be
that Detroit considered importing in 1960's in order to use Trabi's
body as an ash tray in cruisers.....

The military model (a convertible with metal doors) was I suppose
safer as the crew could upon impact fly to safety ;o)

Trabants are still around, I saw quite many this summer in Europe
driven by characters that would in the US most likely opt for a VW
camper (no pun intended, Peter).

Interesting neet little car . I can emagine these new plastic cars
``blowing`` off the road if you went to fast ?  Seeing some of todays
plastics i would be afraid they would go ``cheap`` and the plastic would
crumble after a it of age or warp &amp; get soft on a hot day ??
I like the idea though . If the plastic was colored it may never need
repaint . I also would hope they put a stout steel frame cage type
affair around under the body so people could stand some chance in a
crash .
HA.. they need that big wide rubber band around the whole car like
bumper cars in the fair grounds rides he he he he ... see how far they
can bounce ... then they would probably force everyone to ware a neck
brace and helmet along with seat belts :-)
Sounds fun though . At 2,500$ i would buy one or 2 and store one unused
!

You could always buy a Wartburg, the &quot;big brother&quot; of the Trabant. They
don't have plastic bodyparts, and some older Saab parts should fit as they
share the same motor and drive line design (DKW derived).

Steel frame, but plastic (fiberglass body).

They are certainly popular and plentiful for those with the cash and

There is also a number of French cars with an all-plastic body. The Matra

Forget it, unless you replace the whole engine with a non-stock one. No
way in hell it would ever pass smog inspection anywhere in the USA. I
the GDR, they had special fuel formulations available right from the

There are Germans who still swear by them as well as at them too. U2

Not exactly so, Scott.  Trabant came with a new model Trabant 1.1 in
1989 but it was too late as there was no interest in production due to
political changes - there was simply no market for new cars made in
former DDR due to a flood of cheap nad high quality used cars coming
from the west.  There was only a pre-production run made.  Trabant 1.1
had a 4-cylinder, 4-stroke, 40 HP, 1 L engine, disc brakes in the
front and the engine had a higher compression - about 9.6.

DDR generated most of their fuel from dry distillation of brown coal.
That process made excellent diesel fuel but poor gasoline.  Germans
always loved diesel engines.  Notice how many German cars with diesel
engines have been imported to the US.

Gasoline engines running on brown coal derived fuel worked reasonably
only at low compression and even excess lead could improve the octane
number only to a limit.  So East German engines developed before
1960's were mostly diesels and two-strokes.  The situation changed
when USSR completed oil pipeline in 1960's but the factories and oil
refineries needed retooling and that took time in a planned economy
system.  So Trabants persisted.

Back to the engines.  The two-stroke Trabant engine had a compression
of 7.6 and it could run on gasoline with octane number as low as 78.
Don't try it with your Porsche...

In Europe, the general rule was, if a particular car was allowed in the
year it was built in, you can get a license for it. This way, it was legal
in the Netherlands to own a street-legal 1970 Trabant, but not a 1975 one
because the emission rules changed in 1973. Nowadays, new European rules
allow any car that was legally sold in any EC country, to be owned and
driven in any other EC country, as far as I know.

That wasn't a new model, just a minor restyling. One of the very few
East-German designs that actually made it beyond the prototype stage, was
the Skoda Favorit. That's right, they sold the rights to Skoda as they
did not get the resources to build it themselves. One of the few other
examples that were actually realised, were Aero sports cars made in
cooperation with Saab of sweden. Loads of innovative or interesting
designs and protoypes never made it into production.

Reminds me of the story of the guy who went to the tailor looking for
a custom suit. The tailor took one look at him and said: I have *JUST*
the suit for you. The customer tried it on and said: But the left arm
is just a little too short. The tailor said: well, raise your left
shoulder.

It is baggy in front.
Reach back with your right hand and gather a bit in back.

The back is too long.
Bend forward a little bit.

Finally the guy walks out of the shop in his new suit. Two sweet
little old ladies are walking by, one says to the other: Poor man, so
young to be all crippled up that way.

The other says: Yes, yes, but look how nicely his suit fits...

Maarten:  WRONG  WRONG  WRONG

The story of Skoda Favorit is as it follows:

1967- Skoda decided to pursue development of a larger car with a 1.2
to 1.5 L engine.  Anticipated roll-out date was 1972.

1971 - the project was terminated as the USSR demanded monopoly in
that category for their licensed Fiat (sold as Lada or Zhiguli).
Already assembled production line was scrapped.   Skoda made a new
attempt to make a larger car, this time in cooperation with GDR
(Wartburg plant AWE Eisenach and Trabant plant Sachsenring Zwickau).
German plants would design clutch, transmission, front end, and
steering), Skoda would design the engine, and each plant would make
different bodies according their own designs.

1972 - Skoda hired Italian designers for the body.

1973 - GDR plants terminated participation.  Skoda did not have funds
for developing the entire car.  Licensing was considered for the front
end that would used Skoda engine.  Citroen refused while Fiat,
Volkswagen, and Renault insisted on their engine and/or on licensing
the entire car.  All demanded restrictions on exporting and payment in
cash rather then in manufactured cars.  Skoda decided to abandon the
project again and instead upgraded then already obsolete model 1000MB
to models 100, 105, and 120.  You may recall those as the cars were
heavily exported to EU.

1982 - Skoda came with a new project that called for developing a new
car by 1985 and roll-out in 1987.  Skoda hired Italian designer
Bertone.

1984 - Prototype completed with engine from model 120 that run on
leaded gasoline.  That was not acceptable for production due to EU
pollution restrictions approved in 1983 as the car could not be
exported.  Skoda hired Porsche and several other companies for engine
upgrading to comply with new emission regulations..

1987 - roll out.

Your information is very detailed and contains information I hadn't seen
before. However, I was talking specifically about the 1982 new
development, not about its earlier history. I don't see any conflict
between wat I seem to remember and your information. I'll look for my
source on this, then post it here.

I LOVE these &quot;top 100&quot; lists, and find it amazing that some of the most
ridiculous-looking, cheaply-built, teeny-tiny buckets-of-bolts consistently
find it to these lists, while anything with fins or chrome or creature
comforts are passed off as &quot;gaudy.&quot;  Now admittedly, that link for the
Trabant had a mix of cars, including several sports supercars, Rollers and
Bentleys, and even a 59 Cadillac, but I've got several books -- even along
the themes of &quot;Greatest American Cars&quot; -- that pooh-pooh the Lincolns,
batwing Chevys, and flathead Fords in favor of &quot;the genius&quot; of some imported
Renault putt-putt.  OTOH, in the car magazine I write for (which covers
classic car collecting and events in Florida), a Renault, Fiat, or Trabant
would only appear as a curiosity in a world where Mach I's and SS-396's
rule.  I'll keep my Thunderbird, thank you.

Oh -- for those interested, here's a website for the magazine,

http://www.cruisenewsonline.com/

and a &quot;writer's Profile&quot; for Yours Truly:

http://www.cruisenewsonline.com/TaymanProfile.html

Going back to the subject of cars being made of plastic, my &quot;other car&quot; is a
Cadillac Sedan de Ville, and a large part of the body is indeed plastic --
essentially all the outer skin in front of the windshield.

The SM (Sado Masochistic or Systeme Maserati) was a modified DS, with a
Maserati driveline, so it's not so strange that it was sold by a Maserati
dealer.
