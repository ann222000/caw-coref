My sister's-in-law school has a Bogen Challenger Model CHB 14 PA that up
until recently was working fine for them. Now it only hums. (Probably
a bad cap or tube).

Her question to me is: toss or fix?

I haven't been able to find a schematic on the web.

Thanks.

Steve.

It can be fixed, but you could probably buy a cheap SS amp for what
the repair would cost. But please don't toss it. Send it to me to be
recycled. I'll pay shipping.

We had this problem with the PA amp that powered our church's bell tower. We
replaced the Bogen all-in one PA amp with a smaller Berhinger mixer and a
standard power amp. We kept the difference in cost. I suspect the Berhinger
mixer vastly outperformed the mixer in the Bogen. For one thing, the
Berhinger knew how to spell "Phantom Power". ;-)  The resulting ensemble is
easier to trouble-shoot, lower in cost and much more flexible.

Don't ever toss it!  Whatever has happened to it is an easy fix, so
keep the faith and the old Bogen!
As someone else said, switch it for a SS state amplifier for school
use and get the Bogen into the hands of an honourable collector.
Cheers,
Roger
