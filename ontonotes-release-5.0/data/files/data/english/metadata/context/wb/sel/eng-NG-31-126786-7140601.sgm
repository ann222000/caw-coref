*********************************************************************

1. Numsa set to picket Japanese Embassy

The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) in Pretoria region plans to stage mass demonstrations on Japanese Embassy in solidarity with 410 Nissan employees who are facing retrenchments.

Numsa plans to organize buses in order to ferry thousands of Numsa members in Hlanganani region to participate in protest action on next Friday, March 23, in Brooklyn Pretoria.

Nissan management unilaterally gave workers with retrenchment packages, with effect from 1st April, 2007 and without negotiating retrenchments with the union, Hlanganani regional organizer of Numsa, David Modimoeng has said.

"We want Japanese government to intervene because we believe the Nissan in Japan has instructed this plant to further reduce the workforce. The company also indicated that it could not afford to keep these employees since it was no longer going to assemble Fiats in Roslyn plant, Pretoria.

Numsa also urged the International Metalworkers Federation in the Southern African region to pledge solidarity with Nissan retrenches.

The company has reduced the workforce from 7 500 to 1 800 in the past nine years from in 1998 up to now.

2. Another victory for SAFPU

South African Football Players Union (SAFPU) has received an award of R 236,500 against Mvela League team City Pillars.

The award was for unpaid salaries of nine players who played for City Pillars before it was sold early this year.

SAFPU said the Premier Soccer League withheld certain amount of money for the nine players after the official purchasing of team.

The players who had dispute with Pillars include Silver Shabalala, Augustine Mabuya, Xolani Makhoba, Thomas Ledikgwane, Rabbi Nkoane and Mbulelo Mckenzie.

Augustine Mabuya said he is very happy that all his monies have been paid and he will fully focus on playing football.
The former Black Leopard and Swallows left added that playing for Pillars has been a nightmare as they were not paid for month or two.

"Thanks to the union I managed to get the money and my clearance certificate so that I can play football again," said Mabuya.

Recently Augustine Mabuya has signed for P.J Stars F.C in the Mvela Golden League.

We are happy for these players that they received their money, but still we don't encourage the selling of the teams without consulting the union.

3. Big loss to soccer world

South African Football Players Union (SAFPU) was devastated to hear about the death of Orlando Pirates and National team masseur Johannes Piki 'Bra Joe' Ramokgadi.

Ramokgadi has been a loyal servant both for Pirates and the country as far as player's injuries are concerned.

'Bra' will be sorely missed by the soccer fraternity and his passing has left a massive void to his family, Pirates, and to all soccer players in the country.

We say to the family that the loss is not only on their side but to all people who love football.

He has played his part and we will remember him, may his soul rest in peace.

4. POPCRU calls for measures to straighten DCS financial management.

POPCRU has noted with dismay, albeit without surprise, that the Parliamentary Oversight Committee on Public Administration has expressed its dismay over the handling of finances in the Department of Correctional Services. We are glad that this very important Committee of Parliament has raised these serious questions relating to how this department has frivolously violated standard regulations that seeks to ensure that public funds are spent appropriately.

We have always lamented the DCS' s ineptness in terms of leadership and that corruption was reigning supreme in this department, as senior employees seemed to do as they wished with public funds. It has been our concern that procurement procedures were violated for reasons that arguably benefited those at the helm of this department. The sentiments that have since been expressed by SCOPA gives credence to the allegations we have made before, hence a lot of funds have disappeared unaccounted for and millions of rands that were meant to build correctional facilities have been diverted to payment of other projects whose procurement processes borders on corruption and notoriety. We call on SCOPA to ensure that the Department of Correctional Services brings those who have overseen these anomalies to book. It remains our firm belief that those who are responsible for this financial mess must be held accountable and that stern action must be taken against them.

5. SABS shuts down Chinese stoves factory shop

Chinese-based Tao Ying stove and heaters' manufacturer in Bloemfontein has finally closed down this week, leaving 462 anguished employees in virtual despondency.

And, now the crunch, for which an in-principle agreement still has to be signed, is whether redundant workers will be granted severance packages, equivalent to two weeks for each year employed by the company.

The South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) has ordered the company to shut down after it failed to comply with new production and safety standards set by government. The SABS refused to grant the company seven months extension after Numsa, in conjunction with the management had asked the Department of Trade and Industries to extend deadlines for the new production requirements in order to save jobs.

Government pounced on Tao Ying, producer of non-pressure stove and heaters in Botshabelo, outside Bloemfontein after concerns were raised by community organizations that the company produced dangerous paraffin stoves and heaters which destroyed more than 50 000 shacks, each year causing deaths and injuries.

The company was then forced to cease manufacturing the dangerous stoves and designed a new prototype safer paraffin stove in November last year. All the stove items produced by the company, previously without the approval of the SABS were rendered illegal to distribute or sell in the country with effect from January 1, 2007.

Numsa Free State local organizer Sechaba Malinga said the company agreed to consider offering retrenches severance packages, instead of four months lay-offs. "Only between 50 and 100 retrenched workers may expect to be re-hired after the company has resumed operations after the re-tooling and application process for the permit to sell new stoves has been concluded," he said.

The discussions around making safer stoves have been continuing for the past two years and the metal and engineering industry bargaining council has since been engaged in trying to persuade government to extend the January, 2007 deadline in order to save jobs.

6. POPCRU's stance on wage negotiations

POPCRU wishes to respond and once again amplify its stance with regard to the issue related to the wage negotiations that are currently underway. As one of the organisations that are currently involved in these negotiations, we wish to reiterate our 12% wage demand.

It is our well thought out view that the 5.3% that the Employer insists on offering our members is not only illogical, but over and above, this offer is an insult to our members who stand at the coalface of service delivery. This offer made by the Employer tends to suggest both insensitivity and double standards on the part of the Employer when taking into account that there are suggestions to the effect that public representatives may get a salary raise of up to 50%. If this is not hypocrisy, then what is it?

What rubs salt into the wound is the fact that the 5.3% that the Employer is offering is far below the inflation rate. This, coupled with the fact that the Employer wants to sign a multi term agreement with organised labour makes matters worse. We shall not be compelled into accepting any offer that seeks to undermine and downplay the contribution that our members are making in the public service and for that reason; we shall express our rejection of the 5.3% offered by the Employer with all our might as we believe that 12% is a reasonable demand.

7. COSATU condemns casualisation and victimisation of workers

The Congress of South African Trade Union (COSATU) condemns the conduct of municipalities and districts in the North West province who are continuing to victimise and dismiss all workers who have been used as casuals for more than three years and to implement their capitalist programme of privatising and outsourcing our jobs.

Both municipalities and private security companies in the North West province are pushing an anti-socialist agenda in the interests of the petty bourgeoisie, which is moving towards weakening the trade unions and the working class.

COSATU North West supported the provincial march of the municipal union (SAMWU), on 9th March 2007 to the SALGA North West Conference in Vryburg. The speaker from SALGA, who happened to be elected as Deputy Provincial Chairperson, made a commitment to SAMWU members and the people of North West that all the demands presented to SALGA will be addressed within fourteen days.

The demands include among other things:
*       Stop privatisation in the entire province,
*       End casualisation
*       Create quality and sustainable jobs now, including the permanent employment of all people who have been used as casuals by municipalities.

COSATU North West province also strongly condemns the provincial government departments that awarded tenders to a security company which is now victimising our members and threatening them not to join COSATU unions.

We call upon all employers in the North West, including government and senior politicians, to stop trying to order our members to join trade unions, which management prefers, especially unions that are not affiliated to COSATU. This must be stopped now. Workers have a right to join union of their choice

Secondly we call upon the Department of Labour, jointly with COSATU through a partnership agreement, to visit the houses of MECs, other serving government officials and those who own security companies during working hours to investigate whether their domestic workers are registered in accordance with the sectoral determination.

Our view is that government should play a major role in encouraging the enforcement of all labour legislation, and not promote anti-trade unionism for their personal gains.

The arrogance of some individual municipalities and senior leaders in government is uncalled for. There are still municipalities and provincial government who are unable to produce skill plans, an EEA plan, or an Occupational Health and Safety Plan or Policy.

Once again our members are advised not to be victimised by anybody, and to make sure that they belong to the federation or trade union of their choice.

8. Autopax agree to end strike

The dispute between Autopax and SATAWU has finally been settled. An agreement signed today in Johannesburg gives workers a 6% increment effective October 2006. It also effectively calls off the strike action that has been going on for the past two weeks.

Normal service is expected to resume tomorrow while sales and reservations divisions are open as from today on the Intercity Network which pre-books passengers coming or going to the country's major centres..

SATAWU's Deputy General Secretary Nelson Lamityi hailed the settlement a new beginning in a more constructive relationship between SATAWU and the company and thanked members of the union for their discipline throughout the 14 day strike.

Autopax CEO Christo Bester welcomed the end of the action and called on passengers to expect an even greater level of commitment and professionalism from his staff.

"The strike is behind us now and the public can now expect the same level of care from us as we have always given" he said.

The strike started on Thursday March 01, and ha cost the company millions of Rand in lost revenue.

9. COSATU asks SAB to change attitude

Cosatu welcomes the announcement that the licence to produce the Amstel brand beer in South Africa has been taken away from South African Breweries [SAB]. The SAB has consistently undermined the patriotism of South Africans, firstly by undermining the proudly South African campaign, when they were not committed to supporting the campaign and saying negative things when the group had not bothered to join as a whole. Secondly the attitude of this company to workers and workers right have left much to be desired, as they boost profits at the cost of workers. The third area that has to be worrying in respect of the attitude of SAB is the huge social cost that there beer promotion and sales have had on communities. The alcoholism and sickness that the consumption of there beer has brought about has to addressed by them and not just left to the social service of government at the cost to tax payers.

We would welcome a new bottling capacity for the Amstel brand and hope that this would set new standards in terms of corporate social responsibility and respect for SA standards.  South African Breweries have been an absolute disappointment in respect of the commitment to the National interest and should be condemned as a unpatriotic company.

We believe that SAB should urgently change their attitude to all things South African and revise the public and media relations focus. They should align there brand to the patriotism of South Africa and start to appreciate that South Africans look to see that there beer producer has values that are aligned to there own.

Across the border:

10. COSATU condemns MDC arrests

The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) deplores the fatal shooting by Zimbabwe riot police of a supporter of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) at a prayer rally in Harare's Highfield township on Sunday 11 March.

COSATU also strongly condemns the arrest of Arthur Mutambara and Morgan Tsvangirai, the leaders of the two factions of the MDC, and several of their senior officials, and of Lovemore Madhuku, the chairman of the National Constitutional Assembly. Riot police reportedly snatched them from their cars on their way to address the rally to oppose President Robert Mugabe's plans to extend presidential elections and protest against continued harassment of opposition leaders.

We demand the immediate and unconditional release of all those arrested, and echo the view of the secretary general of the Mutambara-led faction, Professor Welshman Ncube, that "this action by the police typifies the rogue nature of the regime and the complete disregard for the rule of law and respect for civil liberties."

We welcome his statement that "the decision to arrest our leaders will only serve to strengthen our resolve in the demand for a new democratic dispensation. We will not be deterred by Zanu PF machinations of stripping the people of their inalienable rights."

COSATU welcomes the unity displayed by the two MDC factions on Sunday, who, for the first time, appeared in a public event together, and hopes that this heralds the emergence of the broadest possible mass movement in support of democracy and human rights in Zimbabwe.

COSATU has already pledged solidarity action in South Africa in support of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, who plan a general strike on 3-4 April, to protest against 'slavery wages', against a backdrop of an economic catastrophe and ever more vicious attacks on human rights. We warn the Mugabe government not to try to repeat the kind of pre-emptive arrests used yesterday.

While COSATU recognises the heroic role played by the Zimbabwe government and people in the liberation of South Africa, and President Mugabe's willingness to confront the hypocrisy and aggression of the US government, that does not mean that the federation will close its eyes when his government tramples on workers' and human rights.

11. COSATU condemns invasion of ZCTU offices

The Congress of South African Trade Unions condemns in the strongest possible terms the Zimbabwe police invasion of the offices of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) on Tuesday morning, 13 March. They have locked all the officials inside and confiscated the keys.

This is a blatant and outrageous violation of trade union rights. We demand that they immediately withdraw from the offices, free all those detained and return the keys.

It is now clear that the Zimbabwe government is ruthlessly trampling on any remaining human rights.

The murder of Gift Tandare, the Youth Chairperson of the National Constitutional Assembly in the Glenview suburb in Harare, the arrest, beating and torture of Morgan Tsvangirai and other leaders of the opposition, and the refusal to allow anyone, including doctors and lawyers, to visit them, are clear proof that the government will stop at nothing to try to crush the resistance of the people.

COSATU send its deepest condolences to Gift Tandare's wife and three children.

COSATU also deplores the shamefully weak response to these latest outrages by South African government spokesperson Ronnie Mamoepe, who merely said: "We have noted the development in Zimbabwe. Matters of mutual concern are discussed within the existing diplomatic mechanism between South Africa and Zimbabwe."

Such a response is disgraceful, in the face of such massive attacks on democracy and human rights, especially coming from those who owed so much to international solidarity when South Africans were fighting for democracy and human rights against the apartheid regime.

We call upon the governments of South Africa and the rest of the continent to condemn the Zimbabwe government, demand the immediate release of those arrested and the restoration of human rights.

COSATU is mobilising its members in support of the general strike called by the ZCTU for 3 and 4 April, and calls upon all South Africans to join us and show their solidarity with the oppressed people of Zimbabwe.

ZIMBABWE AND SRI LANKA: UNIONS UNDER ATTACK

We probably don't have to tell you that the regime of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe has launched a ferocious assault on the country's trade union movement.  This morning we have launched a major online campaign to show our support for our brothers and sisters in the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions.  Please send off your message today:
http://www.labourstart.org/cgi-bin/solidarityforever/show_campaign.cg...

We've also received an urgent request for help from trade unionists in Sri Lanka, who are facing intimidation including threats of abduction.  We name six trade union leaders who are being labelled as 'terrorists' and we are calling on the country's president to ensure their safety. (One of those brothers has a highly unusual name, by the way.)  The campaign is here:
http://www.labourstart.org/cgi-bin/solidarityforever/show_campaign.cg...

Please pass this email on to your lists -- let's flood the inboxes of the governments of Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka with our messages today. Remember: it is not enough to send off your own message.  The campaign will only take off if you get other people to do as you have done and to mobilize your own union.

COSATU Weekly is your voice!

One of the COSATU Communication Unit's New Year resolutions is to make COSATU Weekly (CW) an even better vehicle for communicating with our members. But ideally this should be a two-way process. At present we publish mainly statements issued from the head offices of COSATU and its affiliates. These are of course very important and we shall continue to include these.

But we do not want to be just a head office publication. We want the CW to reflect what is happening in the workplaces, communities, branches and locals. We also want to hear the views and arguments of our members on the issues of the day. But the only people who can provide this are you, our readers.

So we are appealing to all our readers to become writers. Please send us anything you want to report, discuss or complain about and we will try to fit it all in. We hope this will provide an incentive to forward the CW to more of your comrades and to download and print copies for those without access to emails.

Please send your articles to: Kgomo ... @cosatu.org.za or fax to 011 339 5080

LOOK OUT for our Survey it will bee emailed to you today. Your participation will be appreciated.
