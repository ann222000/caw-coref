Hello,

Dell Latitude CPx.

The LCD does come on and lights the entire screen, but there is a
flicker in the screen at probably around 7-15hz. Very annoying. It
doesn't go completely dark when flickering. I have the inverter out of
the unit, but the lamps on this model are a littler harder to get to.

What is the most common point of failure? The inverter or the lamp(s)?
I'm thinking about house hold fluorescents and when they flicker,
sometimes it's the bulb, sometimes it's the ballast. Only difference
is it's a helluva lot harder to change the bulbs in a LCD screen than
a fluorescent fixture.

Thanks for any help,
Jonathan

Without trying parts, it is very difficult to tell. The ballast supply for
the lamps is a constant current type supply.  The lamps and supply should be
changed together.

I think I've only ever replaced the lamps once, usually the only problem is
the inverter.
