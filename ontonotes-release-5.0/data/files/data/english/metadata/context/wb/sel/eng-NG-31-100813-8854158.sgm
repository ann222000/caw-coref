Some people turn to joke books or funny shows on television hoping to
pick up and use jokes and slowly build their sense of humor, but they
soon find that reading through and memorizing jokes does not guarantee
they will actually be able to be funny in the end.
After all ... what use is reproducing pre-made jokes when you don't
have a compatible situation to begin with? Just telling jokes will
make you sound like a record, rather than giving the impression to
others of an interesting, funny and a witty person.
If you want to have a funny response to all situations that will arise
in day-to-day activities and also special occasions, you will need to
know more than a million jokes! Is it even possible?
Who has time to sit down and research all the possible situations that
can arise in a day and then find humorous or witty responses for
them?
You may try loads of comedy workshops and such around your place. Yes,
you will learn. In fact, you will absorb so much that before you know
it, you will become so casually witty and interesting. But such skill
comes with a price, of course. Then, there is the inconvenience of
having to actually go somewhere and spend time there. Not to mention
the high cost of such workshops and the pain of finding a good one. I
haven't yet found a good one costing less than $250 per course per
person. So, expect your wallet to be several inches and hundreds of
dollars thinner. If you don't intend to spend that much money or time
on this, and want a quick and cheap way out, this course is your wish
come true.
Alternatively, you can go the economical route and invest in a few
national best-sellers costing $15 a pop. Browsing through hundred or
so pages of this standard theory fare will typically leave you
dissatisfied. Most of what you learn will be theory with little real-
world illustration. Theory appeals as enticingly as dishwater. You
want tried and tested techniques. You want results. You want to
transform yourself to a funny person, not in the next decade, but
right now. So you finally shelve those books and sigh in melancholy.
