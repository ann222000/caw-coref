Lush is a chain of shops in the UK which says it sells hand-made
cosmetics.  I passed their shop in Guildford today and they had painted
in huge letters on their window &quot;BUM BUM FREE BUFFY WHEN YOU SPEND £15
ON NAKED PRODUCTS&quot;.

Now, I can work out the Naked Products is some sort of brand name, but
the meaning of the rest of the advert eludes me.

Could it be something to do with this?

BTW, they have a product called &quot;Buffy the Backside Slayer&quot; - it's an
exfoliating scrub for your bum.

Pff.  Reminds me of a photograph hanging in the Acme Bakery shop,
a little artisanal bakery near where I live, whereof the store is
one corner of a little brick building and the rest is full of
ovens.  Shows the entire staff, rear view, wearing nothing but
aprons.  Presumably, to obviate the heat of the ovens at some wee
hour of the morning.  I don't know if they actually work in
nothing but aprons, but you could understand it if they did.

Okay, you have first to tell me whether male people GET yeast
infections.  I suppose it's possible, but male anatomy certainly
gives a much smaller orifice through which the spores could
enter, not to mention much less of a volume within which they
could multiply.

Because the bakers in the photo were all male, you see.

Hm.  Maybe.  A little googling (I didn't want to delve into the
subject too deeply) revealed comments about, in descending order
of frequency, yeast in women's genitals, yeast in people with
compromised immune systems (location not specified), yeast in
infants (thrush, mostly about the mouth), and generalized yeast
in skinfolds here and there.

We all do know, of course, that the yeast in question is _Candida
albicans_, and neither _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ nor
_Lactobacillus sanfrancisco_.  Don't we?

Naked products are the ones that come unpackaged - the bath bombs and
similar. They're trying to promote stuff with less packaging and thus
cut down on the amount of waste.

Probably a Basil Brush reference - he would make a joke and then say
&quot;Boom Boom!&quot; as a sort of emphasis (well, it was funny at the time) -
because the product is Buffy the *Backside* Slayer and &quot;bum&quot; is what we
strange English people call a bottom.

Lush products have some wonderful names. I think my favourite is the
Gratuitous Violets soap....

One difference - Bath &amp; Body Works scents are ......kinda artificial.
They smell &quot;chemical&quot; - lush scents all small natural.
Overpowering in the close quarters of the store but natural, and not
overpowering at home.

Some years ago, when the female-type person i was then involved with
got a yeast infection, her prescription included pills for me to
take...

Reminds me of an ad that used to run in the Atlanta area for a comedy
club - excerpt from a routine by (i think) Jimmy Walker, riffing on
teevee commercials:

&quot;...and so he says 'This athlete's foot makes my feet burn', and the
dude's feet *catch* *on* *fire*!  Thank *god* the man didn't have jock

That makes sense: even if you had no symptoms, it's be important
to keep from reinfecting her.  Hope you're both much better now.

Yes, and they can spread and be nasty and annoying.

It can spread around the groin area, inner thighs and, of course, the
