Hi there Honyakers,

Has anyone got an official translation for 全国高等学校総合体育大会? This
shows up in a fiction story where a star player quits the soccer team, thus
blowing the chances for the school soccer club to go the インターハイ, which
seems to be from 'Inter-high school' but how does the rest get handled?

TIA always,

The Wiki page
( http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%A8%E5%9B%BD%E9%AB%98%E7%AD%89%E5%... )
leads to the official page ( http://www.zen-koutairen.com/f_inhigh.html )
which does not provide an official name.

How about something along the lines of the National Inter-High School
General Athletics Meet? BB

Katy, Doubt it's 'official' but found English at
http://www1.interq.or.jp/kunioki/topics/02_sports/402902.shtml as a link
from http://www1.interq.or.jp/kunioki/topics/02_sports/402901.shtml

Searching on &quot;Japan inter-high&quot; I found a number of variations in use:

All-Japan Inter-High Championships
All Japan Inter High School Athletics Meet
All Japan Inter High School Athletic Competition
All Japan Inter-High School Championships
All-Japan Inter-High School Invitational
All Japan Inter-High School Tournament
All Japan Inter-High School Meet
Japan Inter-High School Championship

In my survey, some variation on &quot;All-Japan Inter High School Championships&quot;
seems to come up most common.

I suspect there is no &quot;official&quot; name, so you can probably just use the one
that sounds best to you.

I like that the best, though I'd drop the hyphen since I'm a
dehyphenator by nature. BB

PS:  Interhigh is a term I grew up with as it was (still is?) often used in
terms like 'interhigh athletics', 'interhigh swimming carnival' etc to
denote 'inter-high school tournaments'.  (After reading an article referred
by a colleague about hyphens, I'm not sure whether to hyphenate 'interhigh'
any more &lt;g&gt;.)
Excerpt:
October 7, 2007
New York Times News of the Week in Review

&quot;Death-Knell. Or Death Knell.
By CHARLES McGRATH

THE Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, the scaled-down, two-volume
version of the mammoth 20-volume O.E.D., just got a little shorter. With
the dispatch of a waiter flicking away flyspecks, the editor, Angus
Stevenson, eliminated some 16,000 hyphens from the sixth edition, published
last month. “People are not confident about using hyphens anymore,” he
said.
“They’re not really sure what they’re for.”

The dictionary is not dropping all hyphens. The ones in certain compounds
remain (“well-being,” for example), as do those indicating a word break
at the right-hand margin - the use for which this versatile little
punctuation mark, a variation on the slash, the all-purpose medieval
punctuation, was invented in the first place.&quot;

Which one? (There are two.)

I'd be willing to forgo the hyphen in &quot;High School&quot; (although, I think that
it's actually correct (or was correct in the 20th century) since it's being
used adjectivally.

I don't think &quot;All Japan&quot; would be any good, however.

As for the other suggestions using &quot;Interhigh,&quot; I've never heard the term,
and I'm guessing most Americans haven't either. If this translation is for a
general NES audience, I would use something more complete (like my
suggestion), and add something like &quot;typically shortened to 'Inter-High,'&quot;
and use that thereafter.
