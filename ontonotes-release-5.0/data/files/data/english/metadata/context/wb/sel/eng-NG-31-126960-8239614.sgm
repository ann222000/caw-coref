The  Top 12 contestants perform tonight, and after tomorrow night's
eliminations, they will be down to the Top 10 finalists, and those are
the 10 dancers that will be going on the tour.

I was away from home this evening, and again had to record the show, so
just this minute finished watching it, and as always it was  highly
entertaining. They are are all at such a high caliber of dancing, that
it's a shame to have to lose any of them, but sadly, two will be leaving
tomorrow. Who will they be?  I would like to hear your comments on the
dance routines and who you think will go...and who were your favorites?

Jeepers, could Cat have worn a SHORTER dress tonight!? She is one tall
gal!

Did I hear right, that this is the last week, they'll be dancing as
couples? Also..the last week that the judges will critique their
routines? It's late at night and I haven't had any caffeine for several
hours, so could be I'm half asleep and don't know it, and am hearing
things?!  :-D

1. Dominic &amp; Sabra was first up and danced the Jive

This was my most favorite routine of all tonight...just so much fun, and
they have such high level energy and amazing chemistry between them, and
Dominic totally blows me away week after week..this B-Boy with no formal
training and he has just gotten better and better, and Sabra is also
just fantastic! I loved this!

2. Hok &amp; Jaime taking the stage with a Broadway number

I was very disappointed in Hok tonight, as I was last week, as he was my
favorite of the guys early on, but isn't improving that much, though
Jaime is a truly elegant dancer.

3. Pasha &amp; Sara did a Jazz routine

Not as good as last week, I didn't think, but still great and are in a
tie for 2nd place, in my book.

4. Neil &amp; Lauren doing a Contemporary dance

I liked them better last week also, though I agree with the judges, it
was a difficult routine, but just didn't seem to have it together?

5. Danny &amp; Anya performed a Fox Trot

I had no idea she hurt her ankle last week, as she sure did well
tonight. I was so glad to see Danny let his personality show tonight,
because  he is probably the best male dancer on the show...dancing at a
professional level. When I watch him the words from a song come to mind
&quot;Poetry In Motion&quot;!  They tied for 2nd place with Pasha &amp; Sara, as far
as I'm concerned.

6. Kameron &amp; Lacey with a Hip Hop routine

I like him real well, and he's very popular, as is she, but he just
isn't  up to the other guy's standards, and isn't improving each week,
as some have.

Half of the couples will be in the bottom tomorrow evening..and my
prediction is, they will be Hok &amp; Jaimie, Kameron &amp; Lacey and Neil &amp;
Lauren, but WHO will be going? I'm sad even thinking about it! :-(

You heard right.  They will now pick names out of a hat, then a dance
and the viewer votes alone will determine the elimination ala AI.

This system at least puts the best of the 20 in the final 10, so
there's less threat of a Sanjaya-type phenomenon catapulting a
controversial contestant into the final.  Cedric was an interesting
experiment, but the judges made sure he was gone before the voters
could do something crazy. It's now set up so that if someone who is
just plain cute or charismatic or has a big fan base wins, it will
also be someone who is quite talented.

I've often said that on AI, the competition really heats up once they
get down to the final 5 or so, but on SYTYCD, anyone in the top 10
could win it and I wouldn't be horrified, even though I have my
favorites.  In any AI season's top 10, there are one or two where you
wonder how they got that far, yet I don't think the same can be said
of the top 10 dancers in any season.

I think Lacey and Kameron's fan base is too strong for that, though
we're about to find out if that base is Lacey's or Kameron's and I
believe it is Lacey's.

I think it will be Hok &amp; Jamie, Danny &amp; Anya, and Neil &amp; Lauren, with
Hok and Anya going home.  I think Danny &amp; Anya, though terrific
tonight, have lost their window of opportunity for a fan base.

Once the couples break up and it's down to individual voting, I think
Jamie will go soon.  She's wonderful, but I think people will
gravitate to Sabra and Jamie will be out in the cold.  Danny will
probably be next to go, then Kameron.

That leaves Lacey, Pasha, Sabra, Dom, Neil and Lauren.

Aside:  Did you know that the assistant in the Broadway rehearsal was
Travis Wahl, last year's runner up and Danny's brother?

Last week, when you saw last year's winner Benji teach the swing
routine, you also saw his cousin (and Lacey's cousin) Heidi, who was
third place last year.

&gt; 1. Dominic &amp; Sabra was first up and danced the Jive
">

The judges were way off tonight - I don't know if this is a reverse
psychology thing, or if they just want to put the top three last week into
the bottom three tonight for the sake of stirring up controversy.

Dominic and Sabra were just all over the place with this dance - arms and
legs ungracefully thrown about and they weren't in sync at all.  The dance
was a mess and, again, the judges were way off base.  This couple have *NO*
&quot;chemistry&quot; - in fact, just going by how he acts, I would guess that Sabra
is of the wrong gender to interest Dominic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; 2. Hok &amp; Jaime taking the stage with a Broadway number

Now *this* dance was really good - they flowed across the stage and made the
moves look *SO* easy and natural.  Granted, I think Jaime is a much better
dancer, but then she's had the benefit of years of training.  Hok just blows
me away seeing a B-Boy take to other styles of dance like he's done them his
whole life.

And I hate, Hate, HATE it when the judges criticize someone unfairly and
then Cat makes the dancer *agree* with the judges or explain when he/she
wasn't very good when the dancer should *KNOW* he/she did well!  When the
audience is cheering, the dancers think they have performed well, but then
the judges critique the dance with an eye towards controversy and ratings,
and that can completely throw off a dancer's confidence.  I hope that, at
least privately, they're letting these kids know that a lot of this nonsense
actually has nothing to do with how well the dancers dance!

&gt; 3. Pasha &amp; Sara did a Jazz routine

They looked really good, the routine was very tight, and they performed the
choreography very well.  They were expressive and committed, but the
choreography could have been much better.  This kind of dancing has been
around, off and on, since the fifties (OK, so we'll give it the benefit of
being &quot;classic&quot; if somewhat stale and dated).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; 4. Neil &amp; Lauren doing a Contemporary dance

I hated this dance.  There's no doubt that Mia is a brilliant choreographer,
even sometimes showing genius, but sometimes she just tries to be too
precocious and &quot;out there&quot; (when actually this style of choreography is
pretty much old hat).  I think Neil and Lauren were done a disservice with
this dance - they really are too good to be shackled with something like
this this late in the game.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; 5. Danny &amp; Anya performed a Fox Trot

Brilliant work!  They just didn't have that much to work with, the
choreography wasn't bad, it was just a bit simplistic.  What they did,
however, was to take a lump of coal and turn it into a diamond!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; as I'm concerned.

&gt; 6. Kameron &amp; Lacey with a Hip Hop routine
">

This is the only one that I agreed with the judges about.  Lacey is *SO*
much better than Kameron that, even when she was just sitting around during
his solo, you were looking at Lacey waiting for the dance to begin again.  I
think she should be in the top two along with Danny if we're going by talent
alone - and if you add in personality, she should win it all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I like him real well, and he's very popular, as is she, but he just
&gt; isn't  up to the other guy's standards, and isn't improving each week,

">

I really hate it when people just mimic the judges opinions!  Even if you
don't know much about dance, you should let yourself *feel* whatever it is
you're feeling when you watch a dance and *THEN* decide if that was a good
feeling or not.  People should remember that this is a reality show, so the
judges don't have to be fair, or even accurate in their criticisms - all
they are required to do is to get people to watch the show (and sadly,
now-a-days, that means creating controversy over just plain showing talent
or picking the best performers).

Since voters *DO* seem to let the judges form their opinions for them, the
ones I think should be in the bottom three will not be, but at this point I
think Dominic and Sabra should go.

Hugs,

CatNipped

Yah.  On AI, I don't always agree with the judges, but it's much worse
here, cuz I really don't know what they're even talking about half the
time.  And the guest judge, Wade Robson (?), wassup with him, takes
himself waaay too seriously, don't he?  So wassup with this &quot;story&quot;
crap, this isn't the American Ballet Theater, that's like criticizing
a talking horse for getting his facts wrong, &quot;No Mr. Ed, Columbus

Oh, now, I dunno about that.  Half the reason to watch this show is to
guess who's sleeping with whom, and unless they're both gay I think
it's pretty much everyone with their own partners, at least, as a
general rule.

I liked it too, and thought the judges unfair or crazy or something.
Maybe they should go to the Olympic scoring systems where you get one
score for artistic merit and a second for technical merit.  Maybe they
should give the judges laser pointers like on the late and unlamented
&quot;Are You Hot?&quot; (still, a show ahead of its time, I think).  There were
faults in this even I could see, but the overall effect was far better
than the tone of the judges.

Danny is just amazing, I think he has the raw talent for anything.  I

Yep.  Tho I think Kameron was technically just fine, but given a solo
he didn't show off, he just danced through it.

I disagree with you a complete 100% turn on  your critique  of Dominic
and Sabra's dance routine, and also  Hok and Jaimie's!  Hok was my
favorite from the first time I saw him dance this season, and  I thought
he was inventive and interesting, but these past two weeks, he just
hasn't had &quot;it&quot; and I am highly disappointed.  There was NO &quot;flowing&quot;
across the stage by him in any part of that dance, but Jaime did her
best, and I love to watch her, as have always said she is like a
graceful butterfly.

Dominic is also a B-Boy, and had no formal training at all, as Hok has
had, and each week he has gotten better and better. My daughter and I
watch this together, and we are blown away at how MUCH he and Sabra have
stepped up their game and grown each week..they were NOT &quot;all over the
place&quot; and was nothing &quot;ungraceful&quot; about their routine. I loved it and
was my favorite of the evening and they got ALL my votes!  The Jive
isn't a graceful dance, as is a Waltz for instance...it's fun and
energetic with lots of quick moves and footwork, and I was sitting here
smiling the whole time I was watching it. He and Sabra have the MOST
chemistry of any of the couples, AAMOF.  I can guarantee without a
doubt, THEY will not be leaving tonight.

I semi-agree with you on Pasha and Sara and Danny and Anya, and also
Neil and Lauren, but I didn't &quot;hate&quot; Neil &amp; Lauren's routine..just found
it boring, and they weren't in sync for much of it.

Judy, I have to respectfully but stridently disagree here.  As a (past)
professional dancer I can attest to the *fact* that *EVERY* dance should be
graceful.  Some dances are more energetic than others, but aside from some
deliberate dissonance in the choreography of contemporary dance, all dances
should be controlled and exact movement* (with only the appearance of
uncontrolled enthusiasm when choreographed).  The Jive, like all ballroom
dances, has very stringent rules about steps, kicks, hand movements, etc.
If you re-watch their performance, and pay particular attention to their
kicks (which were too high and out of sync) and their arms (which were just
sort of &quot;thrown around&quot; and out of sync - for instance, Sabra's right arm
was thrown up higher than Dominic's) and the way they sometimes were out of
sync with the beat of the music, you will see what I'm talking about.

&gt; doubt, THEY will not be leaving tonight.

I won't argue with you there - that's the way the judges
(producers/PTB/etc.) have orchestrated it.  Viewers who are *not* dance
experts will be swayed by the things they say when they pretend to be giving
fair and expert crituques.  What I said was that *I* thought Dominic and
Sabra *should* go.

* A really good dancer must learn to have conscious control of *every*
*single* *muscle* in his/her entire body.  Even at my age I can demonstrate
that to people by showing them how I am able to move my little toe without
moving any other toe on that foot (try it, you'll see how difficult it is to
do unless you can control each muscle in your foot).

As I watched it, I was thinking how well Hok was doing in it and how

his arms and his legs are about the same length.)  I feel bad for him
that he keeps getting all the flowy interpretive numbers.  I want to see

&gt;&gt;I think Lacey and Kameron's fan base is too strong for that, though
&gt;&gt;we're about to find out if that base is Lacey's or Kameron's and I
&gt;&gt;believe it is Lacey's.

&gt; Technically, it's Benji's fanbase.
&gt; I don't think Lacey should have been put through and it's completely unfair to
&gt; the other dancers.   She will most probably win, which is basically Benji

I felt that way at the start, but I feel like she's established fans in
her own right by now and I think her dancing has rightfully earned the
spot.  But I don't think that a rule about no immediate family of the
top 20 (or 10 or winner) competing the following year would be out of
line either.

I wouldn't disagree with you on that. As for the chemistry or lack

I know!  Watching this is sometimes excrutiating for me (and at other times
sublime!) ;&gt;  Ultimately, the success or failure of a dance should, ideally,
be judged by how much the audience likes it.  However, a bad execution
should be obvious even to the untrained eye, so maybe I'm a bit off on this
one (and in all honesty I have to confess I don't care for Dominic's
personality (too swishy) or Sabra's looks (too harsh, as is Anya's for me) -
and that has nothing to do with how they dance).  I used to use DH as the

Good chemistry will give you a vicarious (sometimes voyeuristic ;&gt;) thrill
when you watch two people who have &quot;it&quot;.  It's really hard to define, but
the best example of it that I can give is Benji and Donyelle from last
year's SYTYCD.  The proof of that is the *THOUSANDS* of posts on Fox's
SYTYCD board - all speculating, mooning over, and gushing over the &quot;romance&quot;

&gt; &gt; I was away from home this evening, and again had to record the show, so
&gt; &gt; just this minute finished watching it, and as always it was  highly
&gt; &gt; entertaining. They are are all at such a high caliber of dancing, that
&gt; &gt; it's a shame to have to lose any of them, but sadly, two will be leaving
&gt; &gt; tomorrow. Who will they be?  I would like to hear your comments on the
&gt; &gt; dance routines and who you think will go...and who were your favorites?

&gt; &gt; Jeepers, could Cat have worn a SHORTER dress tonight!? She is one tall
&gt; &gt; gal!

&gt; &gt; Did I hear right, that this is the last week, they'll be dancing as
&gt; &gt; couples? Also..the last week that the judges will critique their
&gt; &gt; routines? It's late at night and I haven't had any caffeine for several
&gt; &gt; hours, so could be I'm half asleep and don't know it, and am hearing
&gt; &gt; things?!  :-D

&gt; It's their last week with their current partners.  They'll be picking
&gt; out of a hat from this point.  And the judges will still critique, but
&gt; it will be the votes than determine who goes home.  I guess.
">

well of course it will all be clear soon, but i think one other
important change ( im  pretty sure) is that we dont vote for couples
from now on- its individuals
and they eliminate the low boy and low  girl each week - this fits
in with new partners each week.

i think when it gets down to last 4, the two lowest go without
regard to boy/girl.

last year travis and benji were the finalists and they danced
together!

&gt;&gt; The  Top 12 contestants perform tonight, and after tomorrow night's
&gt;&gt; eliminations, they will be down to the Top 10 finalists, and those are
&gt;&gt; the 10 dancers that will be going on the tour.

&gt;&gt; 1. Dominic &amp; Sabra was first up and danced the Jive

&gt; The judges were way off tonight - I don't know if this is a reverse
&gt; psychology thing, or if they just want to put the top three last week into
&gt; the bottom three tonight for the sake of stirring up controversy.

&gt; Dominic and Sabra were just all over the place with this dance - arms and
&gt; legs ungracefully thrown about and they weren't in sync at all.  The dance
&gt; was a mess and, again, the judges were way off base.  This couple have
&gt; *NO* &quot;chemistry&quot; - in fact, just going by how he acts, I would guess that
&gt; Sabra is of the wrong gender to interest Dominic.
">

I didn't think it was *that* bad, but it wasn't all that good either :-)
They just don't &quot;move&quot; me at all, especially Dominic. Sabra has a cute
personality, but he just totally turns me off.
As Judy said, they do have very high energy, and I think the young
non-dancer fans are &quot;wowed&quot; by that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 2. Hok &amp; Jaime taking the stage with a Broadway number

&gt; Now *this* dance was really good - they flowed across the stage and made
&gt; the moves look *SO* easy and natural.  Granted, I think Jaime is a much
&gt; better dancer, but then she's had the benefit of years of training.  Hok
&gt; just blows me away seeing a B-Boy take to other styles of dance like he's
&gt; done them his whole life..
">

I loved the choreography, but to me, it wasn't nearly as &quot;magical&quot; as their
hummingbird number. Hok, IMO, is head and shoulders above Dominic in talent,
versatility and personality. Jamie is simply beautiful to watch. I did agree
with the judges that if you didn't know what Mr. Bojangles was about, you
wouldn't &quot;get&quot; that Hok was supposed to be an old man.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And I hate, Hate, HATE it when the judges criticize someone unfairly and
&gt; then Cat makes the dancer *agree* with the judges or explain when he/she
&gt; wasn't very good when the dancer should *KNOW* he/she did well!
">

I know! It's CRAZY.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 3. Pasha &amp; Sara did a Jazz routine

&gt; They looked really good, the routine was very tight, and they performed
&gt; the choreography very well.  They were expressive and committed, but the
&gt; choreography could have been much better.  This kind of dancing has been
&gt; around, off and on, since the fifties (OK, so we'll give it the benefit of
&gt; being &quot;classic&quot; if somewhat stale and dated).
">

Yeah, it was classic jazz...what I learned back in the dark ages :-) I liked
it but didn't love it, although it was in my top 3. I adore Pasha and have
been extremely impressed with his versatility. I hope he goes a long way in
the competition.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 4. Neil &amp; Lauren doing a Contemporary dance

&gt; I hated this dance.  There's no doubt that Mia is a brilliant
&gt; choreographer, even sometimes showing genius, but sometimes she just tries
&gt; to be too precocious and &quot;out there&quot; (when actually this style of
&gt; choreography is pretty much old hat).  I think Neil and Lauren were done a
&gt; disservice with this dance - they really are too good to be shackled with
&gt; something like this this late in the game.
">

I didn't hate the choreography, but the fact that they weren't in synch
totally ruined it for me. If it had only been for a couple of beats it would
have been one thing, but it went on long enough to be glaring and
distracting. I really like both of them a great deal as dancers and love
both of their quirky personalities.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 5. Danny &amp; Anya performed a Fox Trot

&gt; Brilliant work!  They just didn't have that much to work with, the
&gt; choreography wasn't bad, it was just a bit simplistic.  What they did,
&gt; however, was to take a lump of coal and turn it into a diamond!
">

OMG, was that a thing of beauty or what??!! I'm wondering if the
choreography was simplified because of Anya's ankle injury. In the package,
she was talking about a lot of jumps which didn't happen (at least for her).
Danny is in a totally different league than the other male dancers, but
young, non-dancers on the Fox boards can't stand him. I know the judges
won't let him go tonight even if he's in the bottom three, but I worry about
what happens after that. I'm warming up my dialing fingers :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 6. Kameron &amp; Lacey with a Hip Hop routine

&gt; This is the only one that I agreed with the judges about.  Lacey is *SO*
&gt; much better than Kameron that, even when she was just sitting around
&gt; during his solo, you were looking at Lacey waiting for the dance to begin
&gt; again.  I think she should be in the top two along with Danny if we're
&gt; going by talent alone - and if you add in personality, she should win it
&gt; all.
">

I hated this -- it was trashy IMO. Was it really hip-hop? I do like Kameron
and thing he's adorable and talented, but he isn't improving. If you watch
him and not Lacey, it's obvious. I always watch twice so I can concentrate
on one partner each time. Benji's fanbase will probably keep them out of the
B3 although they should be there tonight. Lacey is very talented, but her
personality is beginning to get on my nerves.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Half of the couples will be in the bottom tomorrow evening..and my
&gt;&gt; prediction is, they will be Hok &amp; Jaimie, Kameron &amp; Lacey and Neil &amp;
&gt;&gt; Lauren, but WHO will be going? I'm sad even thinking about it! :-(

&gt; I really hate it when people just mimic the judges opinions!  Even if you
&gt; don't know much about dance, you should let yourself *feel* whatever it is
&gt; you're feeling when you watch a dance and *THEN* decide if that was a good
&gt; feeling or not.  People should remember that this is a reality show, so
&gt; the judges don't have to be fair, or even accurate in their criticisms -
&gt; all they are required to do is to get people to watch the show (and sadly,
&gt; now-a-days, that means creating controversy over just plain showing talent
&gt; or picking the best performers).
">

But sometimes it backfires like it did with Cedric. When all the judges
basically said he needed to go, he didn't make B3 so it didn't happen.
Depending on how the 13-year-old girls vote, I wouldn't be AT ALL surprised
to see Danny &amp; Anya in the bottom 3 AGAIN, and possibly Pasha &amp; Sara. The
younger, hipper dancers have the support of the younger, hipper non-dancer
voters :-(

Regardless of who is in the bottom 3, they won't let Danny go and probably
not Pasha or Neil. Among the other 3, who knows? The girls...well, I'm kind
of on the fence about them and don't have a stand-out absolute favorite.
IOW, I don't much care who goes, but it would be a shame to lose Jamie. I
don't think they'll let Anya go because they may want her for the tour to
partner with Pasha.

The Other Jamie :-)

If Wade Robson were to give me criticism, I'd be listening big time. He's
one of the most amazing choreographers I've ever seen. It doesn't have to be
ballet to have a story. Contemporary (or &quot;modern dance&quot; as it was called
when I was dancing) can simply be an interpretation of the music, but it's
often also about the story. It was beautifully done, but I agree with the
judges that if they hadn't said in the package that Mr. Bojangles was
supposed to be an old man, you wouldn't have known it.

&gt; Heehee, I don't understand your analogy but I love it all the same.  It
&gt; made me laugh. As for the story content of any given dance, I couldn't
&gt; care less really, I just like how it looks or I don't.  And it annoys me
&gt; to  no end when the dancers seemingly get blamed for the choreography or
&gt; concept of the dance.

&gt; tzigaane
">

Generally, I agree, but if the dancers are told by the choreographer what
the concept is, they need to try and interpret it that way. All
choreographers have a vision. It's up to the dancers to advance it to the
best of their ability.

&gt;&gt; I disagree with you a complete 100% turn on  your critique  of Dominic
&gt;&gt; and Sabra's dance routine, and also  Hok and Jaimie's!  Hok was my
&gt;&gt; favorite from the first time I saw him dance this season, and  I thought
&gt;&gt; he was inventive and interesting, but these past two weeks, he just
&gt;&gt; hasn't had &quot;it&quot; and I am highly disappointed.  There was NO &quot;flowing&quot;
&gt;&gt; across the stage by him in any part of that dance, but Jaime did her
&gt;&gt; best, and I love to watch her, as have always said she is like a
&gt;&gt; graceful butterfly.

&gt;&gt; Dominic is also a B-Boy, and had no formal training at all, as Hok has
&gt;&gt; had, and each week he has gotten better and better. My daughter and I
&gt;&gt; watch this together, and we are blown away at how MUCH he and Sabra have
&gt;&gt; stepped up their game and grown each week..they were NOT &quot;all over the
&gt;&gt; place&quot; and was nothing &quot;ungraceful&quot; about their routine. I loved it and
&gt;&gt; was my favorite of the evening and they got ALL my votes!  The Jive
&gt;&gt; isn't a graceful dance, as is a Waltz for instance...it's fun and
&gt;&gt; energetic with lots of quick moves and footwork, and I was sitting here

&gt; Judy, I have to respectfully but stridently disagree here.  As a (past)
&gt; professional dancer I can attest to the *fact* that *EVERY* dance should
&gt; be graceful.  Some dances are more energetic than others, but aside from
&gt; some deliberate dissonance in the choreography of contemporary dance, all
&gt; dances should be controlled and exact movement* (with only the appearance
&gt; of uncontrolled enthusiasm when choreographed).  The Jive, like all
&gt; ballroom dances, has very stringent rules about steps, kicks, hand
&gt; movements, etc. If you re-watch their performance, and pay particular
&gt; attention to their kicks (which were too high and out of sync) and their
&gt; arms (which were just sort of &quot;thrown around&quot; and out of sync - for
&gt; instance, Sabra's right arm was thrown up higher than Dominic's) and the
&gt; way they sometimes were out of sync with the beat of the music, you will
&gt; see what I'm talking about.

&gt;&gt; smiling the whole time I was watching it. He and Sabra have the MOST
&gt;&gt; chemistry of any of the couples, AAMOF.  I can guarantee without a
&gt;&gt; doubt, THEY will not be leaving tonight.

&gt; I won't argue with you there - that's the way the judges
&gt; (producers/PTB/etc.) have orchestrated it.  Viewers who are *not* dance
&gt; experts will be swayed by the things they say when they pretend to be
&gt; giving fair and expert crituques.  What I said was that *I* thought
&gt; Dominic and Sabra *should* go.

&gt; * A really good dancer must learn to have conscious control of *every*
&gt; *single* *muscle* in his/her entire body.  Even at my age I can
&gt; demonstrate that to people by showing them how I am able to move my little
&gt; toe without moving any other toe on that foot (try it, you'll see how
&gt; difficult it is to do unless you can control each muscle in your foot).

&gt; Hugs,

&gt; CatNipped

&gt;&gt; I semi-agree with you on Pasha and Sara and Danny and Anya, and also
&gt;&gt; Neil and Lauren, but I didn't &quot;hate&quot; Neil &amp; Lauren's routine..just found
&gt;&gt; it boring, and they weren't in sync for much of it.

&gt;&gt; Judy

A  non-professional dancer chiming in to agree, CatNipped. Your comment
about the little toe exercise instantly took me back to jazz isolations in
college - GAWD some of them were hard to master!

&gt;&gt; ballroom dances, has very stringent rules about steps, kicks, hand
&gt;&gt; movements, etc. If you re-watch their performance, and pay particular
&gt;&gt; attention to their kicks (which were too high and out of sync) and their
&gt;&gt; arms (which were just sort of &quot;thrown around&quot; and out of sync - for
&gt;&gt; instance, Sabra's right arm was thrown up higher than Dominic's) and the
&gt;&gt; way they sometimes were out of sync with the beat of the music, you will
&gt;&gt; see what I'm talking about.

&gt;&gt;&gt; smiling the whole time I was watching it. He and Sabra have the MOST
&gt;&gt;&gt; chemistry of any of the couples, AAMOF.  I can guarantee without a
&gt;&gt;&gt; doubt, THEY will not be leaving tonight.

&gt;&gt; I won't argue with you there - that's the way the judges
&gt;&gt; (producers/PTB/etc.) have orchestrated it.  Viewers who are *not* dance
&gt;&gt; experts will be swayed by the things they say when they pretend to be
&gt;&gt; giving fair and expert crituques.  What I said was that *I* thought
&gt;&gt; Dominic and Sabra *should* go.

&gt;&gt; * A really good dancer must learn to have conscious control of *every*
&gt;&gt; *single* *muscle* in his/her entire body.  Even at my age I can
&gt;&gt; demonstrate that to people by showing them how I am able to move my
&gt;&gt; little toe without moving any other toe on that foot (try it, you'll see
&gt;&gt; how difficult it is to do unless you can control each muscle in your
&gt;&gt; foot).

&gt;&gt; Hugs,

&gt;&gt; CatNipped

&gt;&gt;&gt; I semi-agree with you on Pasha and Sara and Danny and Anya, and also
&gt;&gt;&gt; Neil and Lauren, but I didn't &quot;hate&quot; Neil &amp; Lauren's routine..just found
&gt;&gt;&gt; it boring, and they weren't in sync for much of it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Judy

&gt; A  non-professional dancer chiming in to agree, CatNipped. Your comment
&gt; about the little toe exercise instantly took me back to jazz isolations in
&gt; college - GAWD some of them were hard to master!

&gt; Jamie
">

Yep.  I know I always go on and on about Baryshnikov, but that man was the
epitome of dance - and his hallmark was total and complete control of his
body down to the first knuckle of his little fingers, not a move wasted or a
centimeter of flesh in the wrong place!  ;&gt;

Actually Danny reminds me a bit of Baryshnikov - he has that same ability to
king of just &quot;hang&quot; in the air in the middle of his leaps, sort of defying
gravity for a split second!

&gt;&gt;&gt; for a foxtrot?

&gt;&gt; Probably not.  Not only do voters like flash over substance, but just
&gt;&gt; going by this thread, voters allow the judges to form their opinions for
&gt;&gt; them allowing the PTB to manipulate the outcome.  This is where it

&gt;&gt;&gt; The  Top 12 contestants perform tonight, and after tomorrow night's
&gt;&gt;&gt; eliminations, they will be down to the Top 10 finalists, and those are
&gt;&gt;&gt; the 10 dancers that will be going on the tour.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Dominic &amp; Sabra was first up and danced the Jive

&gt;&gt; The judges were way off tonight - I don't know if this is a reverse
&gt;&gt; psychology thing, or if they just want to put the top three last week
&gt;&gt; into the bottom three tonight for the sake of stirring up controversy.

&gt;&gt; Dominic and Sabra were just all over the place with this dance - arms and
&gt;&gt; legs ungracefully thrown about and they weren't in sync at all.  The
&gt;&gt; dance was a mess and, again, the judges were way off base.  This couple
&gt;&gt; have *NO* &quot;chemistry&quot; - in fact, just going by how he acts, I would guess
&gt;&gt; that Sabra is of the wrong gender to interest Dominic.

&gt; I didn't think it was *that* bad, but it wasn't all that good either :-)
&gt; They just don't &quot;move&quot; me at all, especially Dominic. Sabra has a cute
&gt; personality, but he just totally turns me off.
&gt; As Judy said, they do have very high energy, and I think the young
&gt; non-dancer fans are &quot;wowed&quot; by that.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Hok &amp; Jaime taking the stage with a Broadway number

&gt;&gt; Now *this* dance was really good - they flowed across the stage and made
&gt;&gt; the moves look *SO* easy and natural.  Granted, I think Jaime is a much
&gt;&gt; better dancer, but then she's had the benefit of years of training.  Hok
&gt;&gt; just blows me away seeing a B-Boy take to other styles of dance like he's
&gt;&gt; done them his whole life..

&gt; I loved the choreography, but to me, it wasn't nearly as &quot;magical&quot; as
&gt; their hummingbird number.
">

Oh no, fer shure.  But then I haven't been so blown away by a dance since I
can't remember when as I was by the hummingbird number (Mia's park bench one
came close, but this was, you hit it exactly, &quot;MAGICAL&quot;!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Hok, IMO, is head and shoulders above Dominic in talent, versatility and
&gt; personality. Jamie is simply beautiful to watch. I did agree with the
&gt; judges that if you didn't know what Mr. Bojangles was about, you wouldn't
&gt; &quot;get&quot; that Hok was supposed to be an old man.

&gt;&gt; And I hate, Hate, HATE it when the judges criticize someone unfairly and
&gt;&gt; then Cat makes the dancer *agree* with the judges or explain when he/she
&gt;&gt; wasn't very good when the dancer should *KNOW* he/she did well!

&gt; I know! It's CRAZY.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Pasha &amp; Sara did a Jazz routine

&gt;&gt; They looked really good, the routine was very tight, and they performed
&gt;&gt; the choreography very well.  They were expressive and committed, but the
&gt;&gt; choreography could have been much better.  This kind of dancing has been
&gt;&gt; around, off and on, since the fifties (OK, so we'll give it the benefit
&gt;&gt; of being &quot;classic&quot; if somewhat stale and dated).

&gt; Yeah, it was classic jazz...what I learned back in the dark ages :-) I
&gt; liked it but didn't love it, although it was in my top 3. I adore Pasha
&gt; and have been extremely impressed with his versatility. I hope he goes a
&gt; long way in the competition.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. Neil &amp; Lauren doing a Contemporary dance

&gt;&gt; I hated this dance.  There's no doubt that Mia is a brilliant
&gt;&gt; choreographer, even sometimes showing genius, but sometimes she just
&gt;&gt; tries to be too precocious and &quot;out there&quot; (when actually this style of
&gt;&gt; choreography is pretty much old hat).  I think Neil and Lauren were done
&gt;&gt; a disservice with this dance - they really are too good to be shackled
&gt;&gt; with something like this this late in the game.

&gt; I didn't hate the choreography, but the fact that they weren't in synch
&gt; totally ruined it for me. If it had only been for a couple of beats it
&gt; would have been one thing, but it went on long enough to be glaring and
&gt; distracting. I really like both of them a great deal as dancers and love
&gt; both of their quirky personalities.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. Danny &amp; Anya performed a Fox Trot

&gt;&gt; Brilliant work!  They just didn't have that much to work with, the
&gt;&gt; choreography wasn't bad, it was just a bit simplistic.  What they did,
&gt;&gt; however, was to take a lump of coal and turn it into a diamond!

&gt; OMG, was that a thing of beauty or what??!! I'm wondering if the
&gt; choreography was simplified because of Anya's ankle injury. In the
&gt; package, she was talking about a lot of jumps which didn't happen (at
&gt; least for her). Danny is in a totally different league than the other male
&gt; dancers, but young, non-dancers on the Fox boards can't stand him. I know
&gt; the judges won't let him go tonight even if he's in the bottom three, but
&gt; I worry about what happens after that. I'm warming up my dialing fingers
&gt; :-)
">

As I wrote a lot before in this post, I think Danny is brilliant (I even
compare him to Baryshnikov - SACRILEGE!  ;&gt;).

&gt;&gt;&gt; 6. Kameron &amp; Lacey with a Hip Hop routine

&gt;&gt; This is the only one that I agreed with the judges about.  Lacey is *SO*
&gt;&gt; much better than Kameron that, even when she was just sitting around
&gt;&gt; during his solo, you were looking at Lacey waiting for the dance to begin
&gt;&gt; again.  I think she should be in the top two along with Danny if we're
&gt;&gt; going by talent alone - and if you add in personality, she should win it
&gt;&gt; all.

&gt; I hated this -- it was trashy IMO. Was it really hip-hop? I do like
&gt; Kameron and thing he's adorable and talented, but he isn't improving. If
&gt; you watch him and not Lacey, it's obvious. I always watch twice so I can
&gt; concentrate on one partner each time. Benji's fanbase will probably keep
&gt; them out of the B3 although they should be there tonight. Lacey is very
&gt; talented, but her personality is beginning to get on my nerves.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Half of the couples will be in the bottom tomorrow evening..and my
&gt;&gt;&gt; prediction is, they will be Hok &amp; Jaimie, Kameron &amp; Lacey and Neil &amp;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Lauren, but WHO will be going? I'm sad even thinking about it! :-(

&gt;&gt; I really hate it when people just mimic the judges opinions!  Even if you
&gt;&gt; don't know much about dance, you should let yourself *feel* whatever it
&gt;&gt; is you're feeling when you watch a dance and *THEN* decide if that was a
&gt;&gt; good feeling or not.  People should remember that this is a reality show,
&gt;&gt; so the judges don't have to be fair, or even accurate in their
&gt;&gt; criticisms - all they are required to do is to get people to watch the
&gt;&gt; show (and sadly, now-a-days, that means creating controversy over just
&gt;&gt; plain showing talent or picking the best performers).

&gt; But sometimes it backfires like it did with Cedric. When all the judges
&gt; basically said he needed to go, he didn't make B3 so it didn't happen.
&gt; Depending on how the 13-year-old girls vote, I wouldn't be AT ALL
&gt; surprised to see Danny &amp; Anya in the bottom 3 AGAIN, and possibly Pasha &amp;
&gt; Sara. The younger, hipper dancers have the support of the younger, hipper
&gt; non-dancer voters :-(
">

Sad, but true!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Regardless of who is in the bottom 3, they won't let Danny go and probably
&gt; not Pasha or Neil. Among the other 3, who knows? The girls...well, I'm
&gt; kind of on the fence about them and don't have a stand-out absolute
&gt; favorite. IOW, I don't much care who goes, but it would be a shame to lose
&gt; Jamie. I don't think they'll let Anya go because they may want her for the
&gt; tour to partner with Pasha.

&gt; The Other Jamie :-)

Yeah, for me the top two are Jaimie and Danny with Danny taking the lead
talent-wise but Jaimie having the edge personality-wise.

motivated to do one every week. Sadly Itoshi doesn't watch I love his

&gt;Top Chef is on Wednesdays at 10pm on Bravo TV.  They replay each episode
&gt;several times a week, and they also do 'mini-marathons' of the season so
&gt;one can catch up..

&gt;You being a cook and all, I would think you'd enjoy TC.  From what I

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yah.  On AI, I don't always agree with the judges, but it's much worse
&gt;&gt;&gt; here, cuz I really don't know what they're even talking about half the
&gt;&gt;&gt; time.  And the guest judge, Wade Robson (?), wassup with him, takes
&gt;&gt;&gt; himself waaay too seriously, don't he?  So wassup with this &quot;story&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; mouth shut from now on.&quot;  Sheesh.

&gt;&gt; If Wade Robson were to give me criticism, I'd be listening big time. He's
&gt;&gt; one of the most amazing choreographers I've ever seen. It doesn't have to
&gt;&gt; be ballet to have a story. Contemporary (or &quot;modern dance&quot; as it was
&gt;&gt; called when I was dancing) can simply be an interpretation of the music,
&gt;&gt; but it's often also about the story. It was beautifully done, but I agree
&gt;&gt; with the judges that if they hadn't said in the package that Mr.
&gt;&gt; Bojangles was supposed to be an old man, you wouldn't have known it.

&gt; Well, actually you could tell it was about an old man if you just listened

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the moves look *SO* easy and natural. Granted, I think Jaime is a much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better dancer, but then she's had the benefit of years of training. Hok
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just blows me away seeing a B-Boy take to other styles of dance like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he's done them his whole life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I disagree with you a complete 100% turn on  your critique  of Dominic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and Sabra's dance routine, and also  Hok and Jaimie's!  Hok was my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite from the first time I saw him dance this season, and  I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thought
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he was inventive and interesting, but these past two weeks, he just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hasn't had &quot;it&quot; and I am highly disappointed.  There was NO &quot;flowing&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; across the stage by him in any part of that dance, but Jaime did her
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; best, and I love to watch her, as have always said she is like a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; graceful butterfly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dominic is also a B-Boy, and had no formal training at all, as Hok has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had, and each week he has gotten better and better. My daughter and I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; watch this together, and we are blown away at how MUCH he and Sabra
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stepped up their game and grown each week..they were NOT &quot;all over the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; place&quot; and was nothing &quot;ungraceful&quot; about their routine. I loved it and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was my favorite of the evening and they got ALL my votes!  The Jive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; isn't a graceful dance, as is a Waltz for instance...it's fun and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; energetic with lots of quick moves and footwork, and I was sitting here

&gt;&gt;&gt; Judy, I have to respectfully but stridently disagree here.  As a (past)
&gt;&gt;&gt; professional dancer I can attest to the *fact* that *EVERY* dance should
&gt;&gt;&gt; be graceful.  Some dances are more energetic than others, but aside from
&gt;&gt;&gt; some deliberate dissonance in the choreography of contemporary dance,
&gt;&gt;&gt; all dances should be controlled and exact movement* (with only the
&gt;&gt;&gt; appearance of uncontrolled enthusiasm when choreographed).  The Jive,
&gt;&gt;&gt; like all ballroom dances, has very stringent rules about steps, kicks,
&gt;&gt;&gt; hand movements, etc. If you re-watch their performance, and pay
&gt;&gt;&gt; particular attention to their kicks (which were too high and out of
&gt;&gt;&gt; sync) and their arms (which were just sort of &quot;thrown around&quot; and out of
&gt;&gt;&gt; sync - for instance, Sabra's right arm was thrown up higher than
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dominic's) and the way they sometimes were out of sync with the beat of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the music, you will see what I'm talking about.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; smiling the whole time I was watching it. He and Sabra have the MOST
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chemistry of any of the couples, AAMOF.  I can guarantee without a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doubt, THEY will not be leaving tonight.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I won't argue with you there - that's the way the judges
&gt;&gt;&gt; (producers/PTB/etc.) have orchestrated it.  Viewers who are *not* dance
&gt;&gt;&gt; experts will be swayed by the things they say when they pretend to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; giving fair and expert crituques.  What I said was that *I* thought
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dominic and Sabra *should* go.

&gt;&gt;&gt; * A really good dancer must learn to have conscious control of *every*
&gt;&gt;&gt; *single* *muscle* in his/her entire body.  Even at my age I can
&gt;&gt;&gt; demonstrate that to people by showing them how I am able to move my
&gt;&gt;&gt; little toe without moving any other toe on that foot (try it, you'll see
&gt;&gt;&gt; how difficult it is to do unless you can control each muscle in your
&gt;&gt;&gt; foot).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hugs,

&gt;&gt;&gt; CatNipped

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I semi-agree with you on Pasha and Sara and Danny and Anya, and also
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Neil and Lauren, but I didn't &quot;hate&quot; Neil &amp; Lauren's routine..just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; found
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it boring, and they weren't in sync for much of it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Judy

&gt;&gt; A  non-professional dancer chiming in to agree, CatNipped. Your comment
&gt;&gt; about the little toe exercise instantly took me back to jazz isolations
&gt;&gt; in college - GAWD some of them were hard to master!

&gt;&gt; Jamie

&gt; Yep.  I know I always go on and on about Baryshnikov, but that man was the
&gt; epitome of dance - and his hallmark was total and complete control of his
&gt; body down to the first knuckle of his little fingers, not a move wasted or
&gt; a centimeter of flesh in the wrong place!  ;&gt;

&gt; Actually Danny reminds me a bit of Baryshnikov - he has that same ability
&gt; to king of just &quot;hang&quot; in the air in the middle of his leaps, sort of
&gt; defying gravity for a split second!

He impresses me the same way. The next best jumper I ever saw was Ted Kivett
of ABT back in the mid 1970s. Danny may be a close third. Too bad he has
absolutely no chance of winning now that the judges can't save him. I'm just
not sure this show is for me :-(

It's somewhat Heidi's fanbase, too, a whole family affair.  But is it
unfair to even have Benji choreograph a routine, since some people
might just vote to support that.

Wade Robeson's routines are so popular that I'm not sure any couple
doing one of his routines has ever landed in the bottom three that
week, but I could be wrong.

I wouldn't be surprised to learn that there are people who vote for
the choreographers, or who vote for certain styles of dance that they
want to show support for, or who are influenced by the musical
selection.  Tell me half of the magic of Pasha and Sara's routine
wasn't the use of &quot;The Rockefeller Skank&quot; and that Neil and Lauren
didn't suffer a bit this week from their unsual song (and the
goggles).

I think there are as many voting factions as there are on AI, but at
this stage in the game, people have locked in on their favorites and I
think many voters think Lacey is adorable in her own right and she'd
have to take a sharp decline to change that (like Donnyelle last year
- I know that spelling's not right).

Am I the only one who think Mia is really annoying and that her
choreography seems to consist of throwing limbs around in ways limbs
are not designed to move?

No, I was definitely wondering if the appeal of Hok on tour would sway
them, and I think they did consider it, because of the comment Nigel
made about basically already having a B-boy and a B-girl on tour that
were more versatile than Hok. He seems like a really great guy.

I knew Jamie wasn't going anywhere after they went on and on about her
technique, intro'd her teacher and mentioned that she taught Travis as

Jamie has been in the bottom because of her partner, not because of
her. I think she will do better now that the couples are random.

Danny, well, he's great technically, but he hasn't caught on with the
viewers. That doesn't mean that he won't have a career in dance, just
that he won't win this show. I don't think that makes the dancers who
do appeal to the voters stinky. It's not their fault he has no
