Having owned a  Pliniuis SA-100 MKIII for several weeks, I'd like to share
some observations with you. This amplifier has the following virtues:
1.  It confirms that there really is something to the notion of "high end",
combining clarity without harshness.
2. In  Class A, it betrays nothing of the bipolar components of which it is
built.
3. In my opinion, the only virtue tubes can provide over such an amplifier
is additive; the added harmonic structure of tubes may be euphonious to
some. But in my opinion, the harmonic distortion of the Plinius is so low
that the relative level of even and odd harmonics is not an issue.

With  the bias mode switch in the Class AB position, the sound changes
noticeably, sounding like a very good bipolar amplifier, yet betraying some
of the edginess that uneducated ears think of as detail. I haven't compared
it to a Krell, but those who have a problem with Krell sound might attribute
it to this factor. It does provide subjective evidence that with the current
state of the art, bipolar amplifiers cannot be completely linearized (as
heard, not measured) with bias schemes alone. The same may not be true of
MOSFETs.

With a static dissipation of 500 watts, the amplifier cannot be placed in
any kind of enclosure. To do so would drastically shorten the life of the
unit, with parts already stressed by a measured temperature of 131.5 degrees
Fahrenheit deep in the back heatsink fins. Temperature on the center of the
top plate is about 121 degrees Fahrenheit.  This is probably a very good
reason not to own a Plinius SA-250, unless you have a very large, cold room.

The amplifier is currently driven by a Hafler DH-110, an old bipolar design.
The results seem to indicate that there are probably numerous older,
inexpensive preamplifiers that are sufficiently transparent to allow the
virtues of Class A operation to shine. I cannot detect any sonic signature
from the preamp.

As always, one amplifier cannot do well with all speakers. The Plinius
sounds good with Thiel 2.3's and Spica TC-50's, as of this writing.

Her menopause gives me pause.

What amplification do you use with your phones, Paul? Are there different
criteria for selecting phone amplification as opposed for speakers? Have you
noticed a difference?

Peter you are one of the more level headed people on Usenet

their presence is not sought after or welcomed?  We have
enough nutters of our own without having casual drop ins as
well.

nice cosy little backwater until it started to suffer this
spam attack.  If these entities were even half decent human
beings they would cease all this crossposting!  There is
nothing in these posts that interests aus.hi-fi at all.
Period!

So I am sorry to disagree with you but IMO Ayn's post
(though harsh) was very appropriate.  *IF* Bob really wanted
to discuss this amp with us he would have posted to the one
group only and dealt with entirely appropriate posts
concerning it.   Namely it would be pointed out to him it is
spelt PLINIUS and hails from New Zealand ;-)  We then could
have directed him to a lovely forum called AudioEnz where
there are lots of locals busting to talk about it.

So *if* you can get Bob to stop spamming and post On Topic
stuff to aus.hi-fi we will be more than happy to welcome

He was standing up for you.  I am of the opinion it is more
effect to address the cause and the result and I wanted to
point this out to Mr. Wieck.

OK so I will take your advice.  Here goes.

Why do you deem it necessary to spam aus.hi-fi and cross
post all the garbage here?

Why when you are asked by many people to stop your spamming
you continue to do it?

Would please apply the same courtesy to aus.hi-fi as you
afford Mr. Wieck i.e. ignore us?

To pre-empt your answers here, we did not care about McCarty
before you arrived, we do not care about him now and it is
unlikely (unless collective gross stupidity overtakes all of
us) that we will care about him in the future!  It is *YOU*
that is recognised as the problem!

How is that for starters?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What amplification do you use with your phones, Paul? Are there different
&gt;criteria for selecting phone amplification as opposed for speakers? Have you
&gt;noticed a difference?
">

I use an old (1992) Marantz SR50 receiver. Why? Well, I've tried many
amps and receivers (Marantz PM80, PM8200, NAD C340, various Rotel,
Luxman etc)) and one headphone amp (the tubed Musical Fidelity X-Can
v2---unimpressive) and I find the SR50 a wonderful compromise between
sounding good and not wasting a hellish amount of power when not in
use. I bought it purely for resale, took one listen and knew I'd be
keeping it. It's one of the few amps I've heard that reproduce the
natural sweetness of acoustic instruments. Why I have no idea, since
it has no reputation and uses no special components--just a modest
frame transformer and standard 4,700 uf power caps--it just happens
to sound great with my Sennheiser HD595s. A mystery, but it's proven
to me that a good sounding amp doesn't need to have expensive
components or a huge power supply unless stressed by the speakers.
Fortunately I don't have that problem.

I also have a Marantz SR4200 5.1 home cinema amp (2002)---highly
praised by the British mags for its excellent stereo performance. It
is indeed very neutral and quite detailed, but sounds strangely "dead'
compared to the SR50--the music just doesn't breath the same way.  I
love the ability to adjust volume by remote in 1db increments (more
important than you might think) and plug everything into the digital
inputs, but the music comes first so the SR50 must stay.

&gt; He was standing up for you.  I am of the opinion it is more
&gt; effect to address the cause and the result and I wanted to
&gt; point this out to Mr. Wieck.

&gt; OK so I will take your advice.  Here goes.

&gt; Why do you deem it necessary to spam aus.hi-fi and cross
&gt; post all the garbage here?

&gt; Why when you are asked by many people to stop your spamming
&gt; you continue to do it?

&gt; Would please apply the same courtesy to aus.hi-fi as you
&gt; afford Mr. Wieck i.e. ignore us?

&gt; To pre-empt your answers here, we did not care about McCarty
&gt; before you arrived, we do not care about him now and it is
&gt; unlikely (unless collective gross stupidity overtakes all of
&gt; us) that we will care about him in the future!  It is *YOU*
&gt; that is recognised as the problem!

&gt; How is that for starters?

&gt; Regards TT
">

TT,
I appreciate your attempt to engage.  I will now attempt to give you a
forthright answer.
1. If you refer specifically to the posts I make under my own name about
Brian L. McCarty, I apologize, and will refrain from doing so, except under
circumstances where Mr. McCarty impersonates me in some way, and I feel
obliged to point  such out.

2. I have a high opinion of you OZ folks, and feel that some subjects may
have an interest without geographical bounds. From my pov, NZ and OZ are
geographically quite close. I imagine, perhaps mistakenly, that OZ folks and
NZ folks might feel a kinship for each other. So I did not think that a
compliment for the Plinius would offend. It is a marvelous piece of
equipment. It upstages anybody in the States, IMHO.

3. With respect to courtesy, I do not believe I've insulted any of you,
except a gentle poke at Ayn. It is not my habit to do so. The sole exception
is Mr. McCarty, because he is an evil person who happens to live in your
country, and participates in your forum, using a variety of aliases.  It
astounds me the tolerance you extend this evil person, who was in business
with John Howard's brother.

While I believe I've made all the posts in this thread, I think that you, as
opposed to Ayn Marx, are at least aware that many of the posts that have
occurred to aus.hi-fi in my name, or that of my dad, Sylvan Morein, are
actually forgeries. I hope you understand this, because it is obviously
impossible to defend one's self regarding acts one has not committed.

To some extent, the need I feel to remark about Brian L. McCarty in your
forum is because he lives in your country. While your group is quite small
in terms of the number of active participants, groups usually have a much
larger number of lurkers, who may profit by this information.

TT,  I am not a member of any organized religion. Nevertheless, there is in
me a very strong moral sense. Even if my actions here are unseemly to you,
it is my moral sense that causes me to do so. As I've wended my way through
life, I have encountered a number of monsters, who walk among us, but are
devoid of the conscience of even average human beings. John Steinbeck writes
at length about this in Chapter 8 of "East of Eden", where he begins,

"I believe there are monsters born in the world to human parents. Some
you can see, misshapen and horrible, with huge heads or tiny bodies; some
are born with no arms, no legs, some with three arms, some with taiils or
mouths in odd places. They are accidents and non one's fault, s used to be
thought. Once they were considered the visible punishments for concealed
sins."
"And just as there are physical monsters, can there not be mental or
psychic monsters born? The face and body may be perfect, but if a twisted
gene or a malformed egg cajn produce physical monsters, may not the same
process produce a malformed soul?"

So wrote Steinbeck in 1952. In 2001, I discovered a human monster on usenet,
but soon learned that he  extended his reach beyond it, touching people in
the real world with one intent: to cause harm. And because my religion does
not admit the concept of being passively good, I decided to combat this
monster, in company with several individuals who had been greviously harmed
by him. Perhaps I was naive; perhaps I did not realize that a human monster
cannot be vanquished, but only contained.  But for all the trouble this
effort has caused me, I am sustained by the thought that if each of us
confronted a single human monster, or at least demanded that everyone we
know act in a civilized compassionate way, the World would be a better
place.

In rec.audio.opinion, we enjoy the humorous, unflappable, and tolerant
participation of your countryman Paul Packer. I have been so impressed by
his graciousness, I imagined I would find it here. And to some extent, I
think I have. You and I are at odds over my posts regarding Mr. McCarty, and
perhaps my participation in aus.hi-fi in a more general sense, but you have
maintained an admirable civility.

Now, TT, here  is the thing. You are concerned about the annoyance of
messages popping up on your newsreader. I am concerned about a human monster
who lives in Australia, a living, breathing man who walks and talks among
you. Do you believe that you are as passionate about your complaint as I am
about my task?

Regards,
Bob Morein

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; BTW, Robert, is that really you in the picture with the gardening hat.
&gt; And if so, where did you get it?
">

It is me. It's actually an African hat. The folks at the Hat Company of
Santa Cruz, CA, told me they import them from Ghana, and that it's made of
jute. However, I recently met a missionary at the registration desk of a
hotel in Grand Junction, Colorado, who told me he has the identical hat,
obtained while in missionary service in West Africa. He gave as the source
another West African state, and another name for the fiber. It is a great
hat; I can tell you that one took me clear across the Grand Canyon, from
north rim to south rim, keeping me cool and without a touch of sunburn. I
would imagine that Australia has great bush hats as well.

Brian ripped the picture off a website I maintained as part of a film
project I ran in 2001. In the background is the historic hotel we shot in,
where Teddy Roosevelt stayed several times. The property later decayed to a
flophouse, and then rennovated into subsidized housing for the less
fortunate in life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OK.  Do you have any comments about amplifiers, Ayn?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lots, but there's no way I'm going to discuss them with a net pest such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;as yourself.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You used to be a pleasant poster once. Now you're just an old grouch.

&gt;&gt;Her menopause gives me pause.

&gt; Something's happened to her. Hell, I don't know.

&gt;&gt;What amplification do you use with your phones, Paul? Are there different
&gt;&gt;criteria for selecting phone amplification as opposed for speakers? Have
&gt;&gt;you
&gt;&gt;noticed a difference?

&gt; I use an old (1992) Marantz SR50 receiver. Why? Well, I've tried many
&gt; amps and receivers (Marantz PM80, PM8200, NAD C340, various Rotel,
&gt; Luxman etc)) and one headphone amp (the tubed Musical Fidelity X-Can
&gt; v2---unimpressive) and I find the SR50 a wonderful compromise between
&gt; sounding good and not wasting a hellish amount of power when not in
&gt; use. I bought it purely for resale, took one listen and knew I'd be
&gt; keeping it. It's one of the few amps I've heard that reproduce the
&gt; natural sweetness of acoustic instruments. Why I have no idea, since
&gt; it has no reputation and uses no special components--just a modest
&gt; frame transformer and standard 4,700 uf power caps--it just happens
&gt; to sound great with my Sennheiser HD595s. A mystery, but it's proven
&gt; to me that a good sounding amp doesn't need to have expensive
&gt; components or a huge power supply unless stressed by the speakers.
&gt; Fortunately I don't have that problem.

&gt; I also have a Marantz SR4200 5.1 home cinema amp (2002)---highly
&gt; praised by the British mags for its excellent stereo performance. It
&gt; is indeed very neutral and quite detailed, but sounds strangely &quot;dead'
&gt; compared to the SR50--the music just doesn't breath the same way.  I
&gt; love the ability to adjust volume by remote in 1db increments (more
&gt; important than you might think) and plug everything into the digital
&gt; inputs, but the music comes first so the SR50 must stay.
">

I had one of the old "classic" Superscope Marantz receivers. I make the same
sort of odd observation about it. It sounded great with phones, although it
was not up to modern snuff with speakers.

&gt; sins.&quot;
&gt;     &quot;And just as there are physical monsters, can there not be mental or
&gt; psychic monsters born? The face and body may be perfect, but if a twisted
&gt; gene or a malformed egg cajn produce physical monsters, may not the same
&gt; process produce a malformed soul?&quot;

&gt; So wrote Steinbeck in 1952. In 2001, I discovered a human monster on usenet,
&gt; but soon learned that he  extended his reach beyond it, touching people in
&gt; the real world with one intent: to cause harm. And because my religion does
&gt; not admit the concept of being passively good, I decided to combat this
&gt; monster, in company with several individuals who had been greviously harmed
&gt; by him. Perhaps I was naive; perhaps I did not realize that a human monster
&gt; cannot be vanquished, but only contained.  But for all the trouble this
&gt; effort has caused me, I am sustained by the thought that if each of us
&gt; confronted a single human monster, or at least demanded that everyone we
&gt; know act in a civilized compassionate way, the World would be a better
&gt; place.

&gt; In rec.audio.opinion, we enjoy the humorous, unflappable, and tolerant
&gt; participation of your countryman Paul Packer. I have been so impressed by
&gt; his graciousness, I imagined I would find it here. And to some extent, I
&gt; think I have. You and I are at odds over my posts regarding Mr. McCarty, and
&gt; perhaps my participation in aus.hi-fi in a more general sense, but you have
&gt; maintained an admirable civility.

&gt; Now, TT, here  is the thing. You are concerned about the annoyance of
&gt; messages popping up on your newsreader. I am concerned about a human monster
&gt; who lives in Australia, a living, breathing man who walks and talks among
&gt; you. Do you believe that you are as passionate about your complaint as I am
&gt; about my task?

&gt;: &gt;&gt; I will attempt to take your concerns into perspective,
&gt;although I cannot
&gt;: &gt;&gt; guarantee that they will inevitably come first. If
&gt;there are others who feel
&gt;: &gt;&gt; that on principle,  your group should be restricted to
&gt;Australians, I would
&gt;: &gt;&gt; like to hear from them. Perhaps you do not speak for
&gt;all?

&gt;: &gt;believe me... he does

&gt;: No, you mean he speaks for two. Unless of course you're
&gt;omniscient.

&gt;So Paul, I take it that you are serious when you say you
&gt;like to read this stuff twice?   So would you please be so
&gt;kind as to state your *real* opinion on Bob's spamming and
&gt;cross posting?

&gt;Are you for it or against it?

&gt;Perhaps I should start a new thread on a poll since Bob
&gt;would like to gauge numbers?

&gt;Cheers TT

My real opinion is that it doesn't bother me. What does bother me are
the fake posts made in Bob's name, one or two of which I've answered
seriously. I don't take sides on this issue, as I've informed McCarty
himself, but it's clear Bob feels that what he's doing is right and
necessary, and I suggest he's not going to desist no matter how much
you whinge and grumble. Personally I would save my fighting spirit for
abusive and obscene posts, such as we still get infrequently from Phil
and more frequently from bassett.

&gt;&gt; Yes, but I wouldn't be seen dead in one myself.

&gt;Paul, I felt damn silly the first time I put it on. But it protects against
&gt;skin cancer; it's worth it.

Robert, I hate to tell you this, but your 7 Phd's go for nothing when
you wear that hat, skin cancer notwithstanding.   :-)
