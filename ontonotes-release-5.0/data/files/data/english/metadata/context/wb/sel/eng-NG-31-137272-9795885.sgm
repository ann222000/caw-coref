We have recently been left with my late father in laws cymbidiums.  My
promise to care for them after his death has brought me many flower
spikes on my first try.  So...
I decided to try my hand at indoor orchids, and purchased 4 from
Safeway within the past few weeks.  I repotted them in orchid bark, in
the appropriate size containers (as shown to us at a Diablo Valley
Orchid Society show) - my question is regarding my spider type orchid-
it is starting to look droopy and I can not figure out if I am doing
anything wrong.
Repotted in orchid bark, (bark soaked overnight)
fertalized with pink orchid food
watered 1x weekly and let drain
Am I missing something?
Thank You
Michelle

Dear Michelle:

When I read letters where people say &quot;I bought an orchid a few weeks
ago and repotted,&quot; I am generally puzzled.  It is almost never
necessary to repot a plant within one year of purchase. Repotting is
to be done when necessary (when the plant has outgrown the pot or when
the potting mix has broken down, in most cases this is every two to
four years), in the proper season, and almost never when the plant is
in bloom. Repotting when the plant is in bloom, or in winter dormancy
is the worst possible time as it is least able to recover and begin
rooting. The trauma to the root system and inability to regrow roots
right now might be the cause of &quot;droopiness&quot;.

Now I am assuming that you bought these plants in bloom. If however
you bought plants from Safeway at a reduced rate because they had
passed out of bloom, that might be your problem right there. The
conditions they are forced to withstand in a supermarket (wildly
varied humidity, improper temperatures, lack of light and improper
watering) generally have them stressed out by the time they have been
there for a few weeks. So this plant may have been quite stressed by
the time you got it home, and its current condition may have little to
do with anything you have done (though what I said about when to repot
still holds true!).

On a final note, if you refer to the flowers (and not the foliage)
when you say the plant looks droopy, the plant may simply be
sacrificing the flowers as a result of the repotting. Stress of any
sort will generally shorten flower longevity.

Keep the plant out of drafts and overly strong sun for a few weeks,
try to keep the humidity up and only water when the bark is almost
dry, however long that takes (but when you water, water copiously). Do
not begin feeding until you see root growth (that would be the time to
repot by the way). I have no idea what the &quot;pink orchid food&quot; is, as
there are a huge number of products on the market, in a range of
colors (the fertilizers I use are gray/brown). I would suggest an
evenly balanced food with lots of micro nutrients (copper, iron, zinc,
molybdenum, manganese, boron, and so on) used all year. Or you can use
one higher in Nitrogen from early spring till fall, and then one
somewhat lower in nitrogen infrequently through the winter (these
should also have micronutrients).

The old growth on the plant may not necessarily plump up, but once it
starts to grow in the spring, the new growth should be plump and fine.

Sincerely,
Dennis
