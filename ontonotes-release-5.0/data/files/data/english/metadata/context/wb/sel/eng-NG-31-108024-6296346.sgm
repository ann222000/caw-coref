About 5 days ago I mixed 3/8 cup rye flour with 1/4 cup water, my first starter.  Since it's cold in the kitchen I moved
it around the house trying to keep it warm, but 60 deg is warm right now...after 2 days no sign of bubbles and the
mixture looked very thick, so I added some extra water, 1/4 cup or so and that looked better.  I put it in bed with me
that night  under the covers and next morning there were a few bubbles on the surface and it had a light yeasty smell.
But since that day it hasn't done anything and the bubbles went away.  Now it has a light sour type smell.

Should I toss it and try again...is rye flour a good way to go, I also have whole wheat an pastry flour.  I've got some
Carl's starter coming, but that will take a while so I want to give this a try.  Any suggestions?

If it smells sour and not bad, maybe feeding it could help to get it going.

It takes time, I don't think that five days is long enough - but there will
be those who disagree :-)

Dunno. Our traditional panto theatres closed years ago, in fact they were
all but one demolished and that's had a many-years refurbishment to
accommodate Opera North and other very superior shows. We took our our
children who are now in their 30s and 40s  when they were young and I took a
grandson to one at the West Yorkshire Playhouse and it was abominable and
not at all panto-like. Their Christmas shows in the last few years have been
classics and very well done but nothing like panto. I suspect that Dames
with Union Flag drawers will be non-pc, as will, probably, pretty heroines
and Dandinis with good legs.

I have a newspaper cutting from the forties, a review of one I was taken to
see. It says that the comedian (a chap who died a few years ago whose name
eludes me), had to plead with a little girl in the audience who couldn't
stop laughing, so that he could continue. It was me. I remember it too, it
was his walk! He later turned to straight acting, wish I could remember his
name. Well before The Ministry of Silly Walks.

What's all this to do with sourdough?

No, never saw him. Isn't it funny - I can remember Norman Evans, Albert
Modley - I've remembered - It was Nat Jackley! Bliss on legs.

Well, they're sort of rubbery too aren't they!
