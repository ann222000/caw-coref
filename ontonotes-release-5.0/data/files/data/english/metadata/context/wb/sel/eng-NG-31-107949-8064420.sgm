Why is there a difference in road helmets and off road helmets?  It
seems to be the visor, but why is it uncool to have a visor on a road
bike?  I have had a helmet with a visor for the past ten years and
have never been off road and only own a road bike.  But recently
someone told me I am using an off road (MTB) helmet and not a road
helmet.  Any comments?

I ride almost exclusively on the road, and my helmet has a visor.  I
don't care a whit what anyone else thinks about that, and I don't see
why you should either.
And here's hoping this doesn't turn into yet another flame thread on
the &quot;H&quot; word.

The only downside to a visor on a road bike is sometimes having to lift your
head quite a bit higher to see what's out in front of you.  It's all about
riding position.  (Aerodynamics, too, but hardly matters to mortal
cyclists.)

Wear what you want when you want how you want why you want where you want.

I think yes marketing mostly, but a visor from an upright (more
mountainbike-y) position won't get in the way of seeing the trail as
it would if you were low on the drops of your road bike, trying to see
the road. So I suspect the visor *might* *in some instances* obscure
the road. But not often and not with many people.

Cycling caps under the helmet or without a helmet (please no flames!)
can be flipped up when they might get in the way or flipped down when
useful. Visors on helmets have no such ability as far as I'm aware.

Actually, they do make helmets with adjustable visors; they slide up and
down quite easily.

Oh, see, well there you go (the last mtb helmet I saw close up was a
fixed sort of visor affair).

But then also cycling caps will always be cool.

Don't worry about it.

If you ride in the rain, a visor is a lovely
accessory to have, to avoid getting those
stinging raindrops in your eyes.

As per another current thread, it's okay to
use Time ATAC pedals on a road bike, too.
At least, /I/ won't judge ya for it.  (Combine
'em with the right pair of Carnac shoes, and
your dirty little secret will be safe.)

The main thing is: Oakleys for off-road,
Rudys for road.  Absolutely /never/ mis-match
them, or you'll never be forgiven.  Such a
faux pas is worse than wearing white underwear
after Labour day.

cheers,
Tom

Until they morphed into those hideous baseball-cap style podium hats

The real three-panel cycling caps have become cliche with the fixie
fashionistas. It may still be &quot;cool' to some but they're behind the
curve.

A &quot;Sou' wester&quot; hat or &quot;Deerslayer&quot; cap look like they'd make
versatile headgear for cycling.

A railway engineers cap is better designed for cycling than baseball
caps. I preferred the shorter visors on the dark navy-blue wool
umpire's caps for winter and that's as close as I ever came to
wearing a baseball cap after puberty.

Get a fedora or a panama for cool.

I think that's exactly backwards. I have only one helmet for both on &amp;
off road. It has a visor. The visor flips up (as did my last one). No
vision problems, &amp; I ride in a very low position. A visor is really
handy on the road for keeping rain off your glasses and sun glare off
your face and, at night, headlights out of your eyes. In the woods, a
visor is worse than useless. It blocks your overhead vision, something
you need in the trees but not on the road. I have been knocked off my
bike at least 3 times by low branches I didn't see, which was actually
the cause of replacement of my previous helmet.

Of course the last helmet I bought had stupid gratuitous air vents in
the visor which I had to cover up to make it functional. Looks like
crap, but it works.

Mostly now I don't wear a helmet off road at all, and only for group
rides (always required, not worth the hassle of non-conformity) on the road.
