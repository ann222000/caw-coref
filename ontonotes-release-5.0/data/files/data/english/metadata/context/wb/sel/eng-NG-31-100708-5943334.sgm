Bush Throws Down the Gauntlet
By Robert Parry
Created Sep 30 2006 - 10:02am
George W. Bush - breaking with an earlier Republican campaign strategy for
localizing congressional races - is nationalizing Election 2006 around his
vision of fighting "World War III" against Islamic militants and in defense
of his claim to broad presidential powers, such as the right to lock up
people he deems "enemy combatants."

In effect, Bush is gambling that the Right's powerful media apparatus,
Republican organizational advantages and the residual fear from the Sept.
11, 2001, terror attacks will trump the Democrats' abilities to convince the
American people that Bush's vision represents a dire threat to the future of
their democratic Republic.

Bush unveiled his new strategy for holding onto Republican congressional
majorities this past week by making his demand for expansive powers,
including the authority to deny habeas corpus rights to detainees, the
preeminent issue in the final days before the congressional recess.

Bush also blasted Democrats for criticizing his handling of the Iraq War.

"Five years after 9/11, the worst attack on the American homeland in our
history, the Democrats offer nothing but criticism and obstruction and
endless second-guessing," Bush told a GOP fundraising event in Birmingham,
Alabama, on Sept. 28. "The party of F.D.R. and the party of Harry Truman has
become the party of cut and run."

So, instead of what Republican strategists had described as their plan for
localizing the congressional races and "disqualifying" Democratic candidates
through attack ads that highlighted ethical lapses and "bad votes" on
hot-button issues, the final five weeks of Campaign 2006 now appear focused
on Bush's stewardship of the "war on terror."

One Democratic strategist said this revised Republican approach reflected
more necessity than desire. He said Bush simply recognized that the election
already had become "nationalized" and that he had no choice but to engage in
a spirited defense of his national security policies.

Still, despite a "nationalized" campaign, a number of key races are likely
to turn on local issues and questions about the ethics of candidates.
Ethical questions about New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez could mean a
possible Republican pick-up, while Virginia Sen. George Allen's racially
insensitive remarks could cost the GOP that seat.

Though most political observers expect Democrats to gain ground on Nov. 7,
it remains doubtful that they will win a majority in either the House or the
Senate. Analysts, however, generally believe that Democrats benefit if the
election turns into a national referendum on Bush's presidency.

What's at Stake

The big question is how many voters understand the larger implications of
Bush's vow to stay on "the offensive" against Muslim militants, whom he
calls "Islamic fascists."

Beyond battling al-Qaeda, the terrorist group behind 9/11, Bush has expanded
what he once called his "crusade" to include victory in Iraq and the
elimination of other Muslim leaders lumped in the "terrorist" camp, such as
the governments of Iran and Syria and militant movements Hezbollah in
Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine.

Bush's vision effectively sets the United States on course to wage what his
neoconservative advisers call "World War III," a battle against Islamic
militants from the Atlantic coast of north Africa to Indonesia and the
Pacific Ocean.

Yet, given the anti-Americanism sweeping the Islamic world, this war is
almost certain to pit U.S. forces against substantial numbers of the world's
one billion Muslims. That was the significance of the newly disclosed
National Intelligence Estimate, which concluded that the Iraq War has
created a new generation of jihadists ready to fight the United States.

So, when Americans go to the polls on Nov. 7, they will be voting whether to
give a green light to a widening international conflict that will surely
lead to large numbers of casualties on all sides, drain the U.S. Treasury
and require more political repression, most likely spelling the end of the
country as a democratic Republic based on the rule of law.

Those stakes were made clear in the past week by Bush's demands for
immediate congressional approval of a law granting him extraordinary powers
for detaining and punishing terror suspects, legislation that the New York
Times editorial page called "rushing off a cliff."

"Here's what happens when this irresponsible Congress railroads a profoundly
important bill to serve the mindless politics of a midterm election: The
Bush administration uses Republicans' fear of losing their majority to push
through ghastly ideas about antiterrorism that will make American troops
less safe and do lasting damage to our 217-year-old nation of laws - while
actually doing nothing to protect the nation from terrorists," the Times
editorial said.

Among the bill's flaws, the editorial cited:

--"a dangerously broad definition of 'illegal enemy combatant' [that] could
subject legal residents of the United States, as well as foreign citizens
living in their own countries, to summary arrest and indefinite detention
with no hope of appeal."

--repudiation of "a half century of international precedent by allowing Mr.
Bush to decide on his own what abusive interrogation methods he considered
permissible."

--elimination of habeas corpus for detainees "who would lose the basic right
to challenge their imprisonment."

--removal of judicial review, so "the courts would have no power to review
any aspect of this new system, except verdicts by military tribunals. ...
All Mr. Bush would have to do to lock anyone up forever is to declare him an
illegal combatant and not have a trial."

--use of coerced evidence against a defendant "if a judge considered it
reliable - already a contradiction in terms - and relevant."

--tolerance of torture through a definition that "is unacceptably narrow, a
virtual reprise of the deeply cynical memos the administration produced
after 9/11." [NYT, Sept. 28, 2006]

Nevertheless, the House and Senate - voting largely along party lines -
granted these extraordinary powers to Bush.

While some lawmakers expressed hope that the U.S. Supreme Court would again
reject the detainee legislation as unconstitutional, the political reality
is that Bush is within one vote on the nine-member court of gaining a
majority that would endorse his assertion of virtually unlimited
presidential powers.

If the Republicans retain control of the Senate, Bush might well have the
opportunity to appoint another justice to line up with Chief Justice John
Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.

Even so-called Republican "moderates" - such as Sens. Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska, John McCain of Arizona and John Warner of Virginia - made clear in
their votes on the detainee bill that they will bend to Bush's will.

Epic War

After Nov. 7 - assuming a Republican victory - there will be little to stand
in the way of Bush's vision of an epic war against Muslim militants that
goes far beyond al-Qaeda and even the Iraqi insurgency.

"As we continue to fight al-Qaeda and these Sunni extremists inspired by
their radical ideology, we also face the threat posed by Shia extremists,
who are learning from al-Qaeda, increasing their assertiveness and stepping
up their threats," Bush said in a speech on Sept. 5.

"This Shia strain of Islamic radicalism is just as dangerous, and just as
hostile to America, and just as determined to establish its brand of
hegemony across the broader Middle East," Bush continued. "And the Shia
extremists have achieved something that al-Qaeda has so far failed to do: In
1979, they took control of a major power, the nation of Iran, subjugating
its proud people to a regime of tyranny, and using that nation's resources
to fund the spread of terror and pursue their radical agenda."

Bush also cited his determination to defeat Hezbollah, a Shiite movement in
Lebanon that is now a prominent part of the elected Lebanese government and
broadly popular because its militia battled the Israeli army when it invaded
Lebanon in July.

Bush referred to Hezbollah's leader as "the terrorist Nasrallah," suggesting
the United States has joined Israel in its determination to kill Sheikh
Sayyad Hassan Nasrallah who was rated the most respected leader in the
Middle East by an August 2006 opinion poll in Egypt, which is considered one
of Washington's staunchest regional allies.

Ranked second in that Egyptian poll was Iran's president Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad, another target of the Bush administration. By contrast, Egypt's
pro-American president Hosni Mubarak wasn't even in the top 10, coming in
11th. Polls across the Middle East also have shown almost universal
disapproval of the Bush administration and its policies.

So, Bush has set the United States on course to battle not only the
stateless terrorists of al-Qaeda and the stubborn insurgents in Iraq but
Islamic political leaders who have widespread support among the Muslim
masses. How the United States would win such a war or even assemble the vast
numbers of soldiers needed is hard to comprehend.

This so-called "long war," which Bush's followers hail as "World War III,"
would mean fighting large portions of a religious movement that has the
allegiance of about one-sixth of the planet's population.

Muslims are concentrated in nations from northern Africa to East Asia, but
also include large numbers in Europe and North America.

Nevertheless, in his Sept. 5 address, Bush talked bravely about how
confident he is that the United States will win this war. "America will not
bow down to tyrants," he declared to applause.

Bush's experience over the past five years, however, suggests that his
strategy would require a full-scale transformation of the United States into
a warrior nation, committed to an endless struggle against any and all
Islamic extremists who harbor thoughts of power, no matter how

Bush has always said that the terrorists hate Americans for their
freedoms. He is now reducing those freedoms so the terrorists won't
hate America anymore.

&gt;&gt;in the way of Bush's vision of an epic war against Muslim militants that
&gt;&gt;goes far beyond al-Qaeda and even the Iraqi insurgency.

&gt;&gt;&quot;As we continue to fight al-Qaeda and these Sunni extremists inspired by
&gt;&gt;their radical ideology, we also face the threat posed by Shia extremists,
&gt;&gt;who are learning from al-Qaeda, increasing their assertiveness and
&gt;&gt;stepping
&gt;&gt;up their threats,&quot; Bush said in a speech on Sept. 5.

&gt;&gt;&quot;This Shia strain of Islamic radicalism is just as dangerous, and just as
&gt;&gt;hostile to America, and just as determined to establish its brand of
&gt;&gt;hegemony across the broader Middle East,&quot; Bush continued. &quot;And the Shia
&gt;&gt;extremists have achieved something that al-Qaeda has so far failed to do:
&gt;&gt;In
&gt;&gt;1979, they took control of a major power, the nation of Iran, subjugating
&gt;&gt;its proud people to a regime of tyranny, and using that nation's resources
&gt;&gt;to fund the spread of terror and pursue their radical agenda.&quot;

&gt;&gt;Bush also cited his determination to defeat Hezbollah, a Shiite movement
&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;Lebanon that is now a prominent part of the elected Lebanese government
&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;broadly popular because its militia battled the Israeli army when it
&gt;&gt;invaded
&gt;&gt;Lebanon in July.

&gt;&gt;Bush referred to Hezbollah's leader as &quot;the terrorist Nasrallah,&quot;
&gt;&gt;suggesting
&gt;&gt;the United States has joined Israel in its determination to kill Sheikh
&gt;&gt;Sayyad Hassan Nasrallah who was rated the most respected leader in the
&gt;&gt;Middle East by an August 2006 opinion poll in Egypt, which is considered
&gt;&gt;one
&gt;&gt;of Washington's staunchest regional allies.

&gt;&gt;Ranked second in that Egyptian poll was Iran's president Mahmoud
&gt;&gt;Ahmadinejad, another target of the Bush administration. By contrast,
&gt;&gt;Egypt's
&gt;&gt;pro-American president Hosni Mubarak wasn't even in the top 10, coming in
&gt;&gt;11th. Polls across the Middle East also have shown almost universal
&gt;&gt;disapproval of the Bush administration and its policies.

&gt;&gt;So, Bush has set the United States on course to battle not only the
&gt;&gt;stateless terrorists of al-Qaeda and the stubborn insurgents in Iraq but
&gt;&gt;Islamic political leaders who have widespread support among the Muslim
&gt;&gt;masses.

&gt;&gt; Bush has always said that the terrorists hate Americans for their

Yes it is! No other President of the United States has been so
innovative and resourceful.

You also have to appreciate the fact that Bush has lived up to his
campaign promises:

"Our enemies are innovative and resourceful...They never stop thinking
about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."
- G.W.Bush

I understand there will be a Senate commission set up to get
waterboarding accepted by the Olympic Committee. There will be slalom,
parallel slalom, giant slalom, super giant slalom, waterboardercross
and halfpipe. It's uncertain at this time if leg shackles will be
optional.

China is apparently the biggest holdout. They have complained that
they hold the rights to use water in this type of event. But, WalMart
executives expect they can win them over in time to have it included
in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

If you are interested, the CIA is running daily flights to Gitmo, all

Halliburton has been contracted to design and build the course and

&gt;&gt;&gt;Bush Throws Down the Gauntlet
&gt;&gt;&gt;By Robert Parry
&gt;&gt;&gt;Created Sep 30 2006 - 10:02am
&gt;&gt;&gt;George W. Bush - breaking with an earlier Republican campaign strategy for
&gt;&gt;&gt;localizing congressional races - is nationalizing Election 2006 around his
&gt;&gt;&gt;vision of fighting &quot;World War III&quot; against Islamic militants and in
&gt;&gt;&gt;defense
&gt;&gt;&gt;of his claim to broad presidential powers, such as the right to lock up
&gt;&gt;&gt;people he deems &quot;enemy combatants.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;In effect, Bush is gambling that the Right's powerful media apparatus,
&gt;&gt;&gt;Republican organizational advantages and the residual fear from the Sept.
&gt;&gt;&gt;11, 2001, terror attacks will trump the Democrats' abilities to convince
&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;American people that Bush's vision represents a dire threat to the future
&gt;&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;&gt;their democratic Republic.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Bush unveiled his new strategy for holding onto Republican congressional
&gt;&gt;&gt;majorities this past week by making his demand for expansive powers,
&gt;&gt;&gt;including the authority to deny habeas corpus rights to detainees, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;preeminent issue in the final days before the congressional recess.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Bush also blasted Democrats for criticizing his handling of the Iraq War.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Five years after 9/11, the worst attack on the American homeland in our
&gt;&gt;&gt;history, the Democrats offer nothing but criticism and obstruction and
&gt;&gt;&gt;endless second-guessing,&quot; Bush told a GOP fundraising event in Birmingham,
&gt;&gt;&gt;Alabama, on Sept. 28. &quot;The party of F.D.R. and the party of Harry Truman
&gt;&gt;&gt;has
&gt;&gt;&gt;become the party of cut and run.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;So, instead of what Republican strategists had described as their plan for
&gt;&gt;&gt;localizing the congressional races and &quot;disqualifying&quot; Democratic
&gt;&gt;&gt;candidates
&gt;&gt;&gt;through attack ads that highlighted ethical lapses and &quot;bad votes&quot; on
&gt;&gt;&gt;hot-button issues, the final five weeks of Campaign 2006 now appear
&gt;&gt;&gt;focused
&gt;&gt;&gt;on Bush's stewardship of the &quot;war on terror.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;One Democratic strategist said this revised Republican approach reflected
&gt;&gt;&gt;more necessity than desire. He said Bush simply recognized that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;election
&gt;&gt;&gt;already had become &quot;nationalized&quot; and that he had no choice but to engage
&gt;&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;a spirited defense of his national security policies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Still, despite a &quot;nationalized&quot; campaign, a number of key races are likely
&gt;&gt;&gt;to turn on local issues and questions about the ethics of candidates.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Ethical questions about New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez could mean a
&gt;&gt;&gt;possible Republican pick-up, while Virginia Sen. George Allen's racially
&gt;&gt;&gt;insensitive remarks could cost the GOP that seat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Though most political observers expect Democrats to gain ground on Nov. 7,
&gt;&gt;&gt;it remains doubtful that they will win a majority in either the House or
&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Senate. Analysts, however, generally believe that Democrats benefit if the
&gt;&gt;&gt;election turns into a national referendum on Bush's presidency.

&gt;&gt;&gt;What's at Stake

&gt;&gt;&gt;The big question is how many voters understand the larger implications of
&gt;&gt;&gt;Bush's vow to stay on &quot;the offensive&quot; against Muslim militants, whom he
&gt;&gt;&gt;calls &quot;Islamic fascists.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Beyond battling al-Qaeda, the terrorist group behind 9/11, Bush has
&gt;&gt;&gt;expanded
&gt;&gt;&gt;what he once called his &quot;crusade&quot; to include victory in Iraq and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;elimination of other Muslim leaders lumped in the &quot;terrorist&quot; camp, such
&gt;&gt;&gt;as
&gt;&gt;&gt;the governments of Iran and Syria and militant movements Hezbollah in
&gt;&gt;&gt;Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Bush's vision effectively sets the United States on course to wage what
&gt;&gt;&gt;his
&gt;&gt;&gt;neoconservative advisers call &quot;World War III,&quot; a battle against Islamic
&gt;&gt;&gt;militants from the Atlantic coast of north Africa to Indonesia and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Pacific Ocean.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yet, given the anti-Americanism sweeping the Islamic world, this war is
&gt;&gt;&gt;almost certain to pit U.S. forces against substantial numbers of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;world's
&gt;&gt;&gt;one billion Muslims. That was the significance of the newly disclosed
&gt;&gt;&gt;National Intelligence Estimate, which concluded that the Iraq War has
&gt;&gt;&gt;created a new generation of jihadists ready to fight the United States.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So, when Americans go to the polls on Nov. 7, they will be voting whether
&gt;&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;&gt;give a green light to a widening international conflict that will surely
&gt;&gt;&gt;lead to large numbers of casualties on all sides, drain the U.S. Treasury
&gt;&gt;&gt;and require more political repression, most likely spelling the end of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;country as a democratic Republic based on the rule of law.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Those stakes were made clear in the past week by Bush's demands for
&gt;&gt;&gt;immediate congressional approval of a law granting him extraordinary
&gt;&gt;&gt;powers
&gt;&gt;&gt;for detaining and punishing terror suspects, legislation that the New York
&gt;&gt;&gt;Times editorial page called &quot;rushing off a cliff.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Here's what happens when this irresponsible Congress railroads a
&gt;&gt;&gt;profoundly
&gt;&gt;&gt;important bill to serve the mindless politics of a midterm election: The
&gt;&gt;&gt;Bush administration uses Republicans' fear of losing their majority to
&gt;&gt;&gt;push
&gt;&gt;&gt;through ghastly ideas about antiterrorism that will make American troops
&gt;&gt;&gt;less safe and do lasting damage to our 217-year-old nation of laws - while
&gt;&gt;&gt;actually doing nothing to protect the nation from terrorists,&quot; the Times
&gt;&gt;&gt;editorial said.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Among the bill's flaws, the editorial cited:

&gt;&gt;&gt;--&quot;a dangerously broad definition of 'illegal enemy combatant' [that]
&gt;&gt;&gt;could
&gt;&gt;&gt;subject legal residents of the United States, as well as foreign citizens
&gt;&gt;&gt;living in their own countries, to summary arrest and indefinite detention
&gt;&gt;&gt;with no hope of appeal.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;--repudiation of &quot;a half century of international precedent by allowing
&gt;&gt;&gt;Mr.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Bush to decide on his own what abusive interrogation methods he considered
&gt;&gt;&gt;permissible.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;--elimination of habeas corpus for detainees &quot;who would lose the basic
&gt;&gt;&gt;right
&gt;&gt;&gt;to challenge their imprisonment.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;--removal of judicial review, so &quot;the courts would have no power to review
&gt;&gt;&gt;any aspect of this new system, except verdicts by military tribunals. ...
&gt;&gt;&gt;All Mr. Bush would have to do to lock anyone up forever is to declare him
&gt;&gt;&gt;an
&gt;&gt;&gt;illegal combatant and not have a trial.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;--use of coerced evidence against a defendant &quot;if a judge considered it
&gt;&gt;&gt;reliable - already a contradiction in terms - and relevant.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;--tolerance of torture through a definition that &quot;is unacceptably narrow,
&gt;&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;virtual reprise of the deeply cynical memos the administration produced
&gt;&gt;&gt;after 9/11.&quot; [NYT, Sept. 28, 2006]

&gt;&gt;&gt;Nevertheless, the House and Senate - voting largely along party lines -
&gt;&gt;&gt;granted these extraordinary powers to Bush.

&gt;&gt;&gt;While some lawmakers expressed hope that the U.S. Supreme Court would
&gt;&gt;&gt;again
&gt;&gt;&gt;reject the detainee legislation as unconstitutional, the political reality
&gt;&gt;&gt;is that Bush is within one vote on the nine-member court of gaining a
&gt;&gt;&gt;majority that would endorse his assertion of virtually unlimited
&gt;&gt;&gt;presidential powers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If the Republicans retain control of the Senate, Bush might well have the
&gt;&gt;&gt;opportunity to appoint another justice to line up with Chief Justice John
&gt;&gt;&gt;Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Even so-called Republican &quot;moderates&quot; - such as Sens. Chuck Hagel of
&gt;&gt;&gt;Nebraska, John McCain of Arizona and John Warner of Virginia - made clear
&gt;&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;their votes on the detainee bill that they will bend to Bush's will.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Epic War

&gt;&gt;&gt;After Nov. 7 - assuming a Republican victory - there will be little to
&gt;&gt;&gt;stand
&gt;&gt;&gt;in the way of Bush's vision of an epic war against Muslim militants that
&gt;&gt;&gt;goes far beyond al-Qaeda and even the Iraqi insurgency.

Have you read the Orwellian named "Patriot" Act? Those are what
Americans have lost. The latest outrage against freedoms is just one
word away from the US being a fascist state - "alien". But even that
one word can be circumvented by what is the definition of "enemy
combatant".

Freedoms are lost, not all at once, but bit by bit. One morning you
will wake up and say "What the fuck happened to America?".

Do you really think Bush's trashing of the Constitution is worth the
supposed "protecting America" rhetoric?
