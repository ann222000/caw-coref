Yes, I saw that this morning, it was 'there' and working fine
yesterday.  My hosts have been having spamcomment issues and it renders
weblogs.us unstable when 'they' bombard us with spamcomments.
Please do try again, I know that BB got there, she left me a comment
yesterday!
So sorry,
Noreen

Well, I got it, eventually :-)

Then Microsoft kept experiencing a problem. I persisted, however, not going
to let a bundle of electronics to get the better of me!

Thanks, I'm glad I persevered.

What I'd like to know is: is it essential for shawls to be fringed? I mde
one for a granddaughter for Christmas and didn't fringe it but since then
all the shawls I've seen have been fringed.

I never fringe a shawl as fringes get caught in things so I leave them off.

I think it is a matter or personal preference, Mary. I prefer no
fringes myself, but my DD wanted them, so I put them on her shawl.
