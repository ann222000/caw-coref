My ball-lock keg has a problem. When I remove the gas line, the gas
leaks out through the poppet. This just started happenening recently.
Any ideas on the cause and/or how I can fix this?

Thanks!
Tom

I have this happen now and then.  The next time that keg is empty,
remove the keg post and take out the poppet.  Scrub the inside of the
keg post with a small brush.  I use a nice cone shaped on that came with
my turkey baster.  This will get any crud out of the post that might be
blocking the seal.  I also scrub the O-ring on the poppet with an
ordinary washcloth.  This solves the problem 9 times out of 10 for me.
If it still leaks after that you may need to replace the poppet.

I get this from time to time.  I reattach the gas line and take it off
and the leak sometimes stop.  Beer has probably caked on the poppet,
causing it not to seal properly.  You could try using some keg lube on
the poppet as well.

Either the poppet is dirty (do you take them apart when you clean the keg?),
or the little oring on the poppet is not sitting squarely and won't seal
right.  I've had this happen before, usually taking the post apart (removing
the poppet), cleaning, and re-assembling fixes the problem.  If it still
gives you trouble you may need to replace the poppet.

John.
