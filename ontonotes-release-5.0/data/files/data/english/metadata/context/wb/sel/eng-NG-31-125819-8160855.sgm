&quot;Huq, who has withdrawn her support from the cycling event next month&quot;

Shameful. It is these &quot;Tory activists&quot; who should be ashamed.

So the biggest mass participation cycle ride in the UK gets a
children's TV presenter to help promote it, and come along on the day.
Exactly what is needed for an event like that to get media coverage.
And these Tory twits turn it into a party political feud.

For God's sake, we cannot have a country where the Tories are &quot;pro
car&quot; and Labour is &quot;anti car&quot;.
(Hmmmm... may just be a slimy attempt to ingratiate themselves with
Mrs and Mrs Middle Emgland Car Owner).

And now the poor lass won't be coming along on the day. Shame on you.

ps. Now - if she were to reconsider, and come along on a bike wearing
that dress, there would eb a lot more than 32000 people turning up...

The plot thickens:

A spokesman for the Mayor of London denied he had indulged in a
&quot;political rant&quot; and said the event was held purely to promote the
merits of cycling.

&quot;There was no party political element to Konnie Huq's involvement in
the launch, it was merely to promote the Freewheel, a fun, free event
to encourage everyday cycling in London,&quot; the spokesman said.

He added: &quot;During the press conference, the Mayor and Jenny Jones
briefly referred to Barnet's spending on cycling and the Assembly
Member for Barnet's £10,000 taxi bill - far from being the 'political
rant' Mr Coleman suggests, this was a moment of jokey banter. It was
certainly not in any way party political - no political parties were
even mentioned.&quot;

Getting rid of humps, cycle lanes and build-outs? Sounds pro-cycling to
me.

Ah, someone who is prepared to use logic and common, rather than
prejudice, in determining &quot;road safety&quot; measures.

Barnet's policies, including the removal of road humps, appear to be
delivering safer roads.  Barnet's road casualties in 2005 were 13.6%
down on their 2004 level, compared with the Outer London average of 7.5%.[1]

If the removal of &quot;safety measures&quot; coincides with a reduction in road

I put it to you that it is quite consistent that removal of safety
measures leads to increased speed of traffic which in turn deters other
road users like cyclists and pedestrians which results in a reduction in
accidents involving these vulnerable road users. So yes, removing safety
measures could coincide with a reduction in road casualties.

Whether this is what is happening in Barnet I do not know.

Cycle helmets are a good idea I think and it's ridiculous to bend
statistics to suggest that they cause accidents just because some
can't be bothered to wear one. Fine by me if they don't and land in a
coma as a result.
As for the using of cars as weapons, I don't think people
systematically use then as such, but do so out of sheer ignorance.
Similarly I can use a knife as a tool but as soon as I stop to take
care in what I do with it it turns into a potential weapon. These are
some of the reasons why the use of motorised vehicles is subject to a
load of licences and other regulation.

If that were the case, do you think it is better to lull them into a

No, as you said the ones who do so have been dealt with. But because
of the ignorance there is a lack of due care and attention and the car
turns into a possible weapon. Say a pedestrian walks without due care

Both. If someone sets out to kill someone it's obviously deliberation.
If I start throwing knives as lightswitches because I think I can this
way turn them of or on, then that is because I am ignorant of the fact
that a knife does potentially do a lot of harm in someones (walking

OK, not really a &quot;weapon&quot; then.  That word is usually used for an object
deliberately used to injure people.

Could it also be that the authority and priority that they have been
granted as drivers, leads them inadvertently to take small risks, that
999999 times in every 1000000, have no consequence, but when other
factors also conspire to act against them, such as someone breaks or
ignores the conventional &quot;rules of the road&quot;, then the 1 in a 1000000

Which country do you live in?  Do you have to pass a test to get a knife
licence?  Do you have to be of a certain age to be allowed to use a
knife?  Here in the UK no such licences exist.  I believe there is a
lower age limit on knife purchase, but they are openly available from
supermarkets, and many high street shops.  People can carry them
perfectly legally, home from the shop, and to work (think of butchers,
hunters, game keepers, woodsmen, etc.).

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ah, someone who is prepared to use logic and common, rather than
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; prejudice, in determining &quot;road safety&quot; measures.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Barnet's policies, including the removal of road humps, appear to be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; delivering safer roads.  Barnet's road casualties in 2005 were 13.6%
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; down on their 2004 level, compared with the Outer London average of 7.5%.[1]

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; [1] &lt; http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/Q4-2005-Final.pdf &gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt; So you reckon the speed bumps are to blame for road deaths? That's
&gt;&gt; &gt; ridiculous.

&gt;&gt; If the removal of &quot;safety measures&quot; coincides with a reduction in road
&gt;&gt; casualties, should we imagine the possibility of a causal relationship,
&gt;&gt; or should we just assume that it is a coincidence?

&gt;&gt; What if the introduction of &quot;safety measures&quot; coincides with a reduction
&gt;&gt; in casualties?

&gt;You were mentioning what I assume was &quot;common sense&quot;. To suggest that
&gt;safety measures cause casualties implies to me a total lack of common
&gt;sense. Further, if people thought twice before using metal cages as
&gt;weapons there'd be no need for speed bumps.
">

Barnet's ranking for road casualties per head of population among
outer London boroughs over the last four years has been pretty poor:-

2002: 14th out of 19
2003: 13th out of 19
2004: 16th out of 19
2005: 12th out of 19
2006 (first 9 months): 15th out of 19

In 2005 it improved, only to get worse again in the first nine months
of 2006.  Perhaps all those roadworks removing the speed humps managed
to slow the traffic.

It's interesting to note that London has gone without a single child
cyclist fatatlity for nearly two years.

2002: 4
2003: 3
2004: 1
2005: 0
2006 (first 9 months): 0

I do wish there was a standard on speed hump design and their marking.
The profile varies widely from some that can be ridden over smoothly to
ones that are bucking broncos to ones that are short hemicyclindrical
ridges across the road.  Then there are speed pillows which are OK if
you know they are there and ride down the side but I know of quite a few
that are unpainted or the paint warnings have worn off them.  At night
especially in the wet they are invisible and can be pretty dangerous at
any speed on a bike in the primary or secondary position.  We need a
standard design with a bike friendly profile that will not throw you off
if you don't spot them and hit them at speed.

An old tale that is often repeated, but remains an old tale.

Speed bumps are installed on roads off main roads. The ambulance can
be driven along the main roads and then down a road or two with
speed bumps. The minor delay involved is nothing compared to the
delays caused by motor traffic constipation.

I certainly don't want ambulances driven at high speed down small
residential roads. Crashing into someone using that road not only
injures them but means another ambulance must be sent out to the
first call. Like all things risks must be carefully considered in
their entirety.

Whether its an old tale or whether there is any reality behind the risk
of humps, paramedic perceptions certainly seem to result in lengthened
journey times and postponed interventions due to perceptions about humps
and avoidance of routes with humps.  Whether their is substance behind
the perceptions is another matter.

That sounds a bit callous - but I understand the rationale.  The
question then arises: Rates per what?  KSI/capita, KSI/distance
travelled, KSI/road length, KSI/hour, KSI/hour on the road, KSI/street,...

You'll agree the numbers are likely to vary quite drastically.  Which is
right?

No, I mean restore their liberty to use the streets safely.

I too think it is the Tories who should be ashamed, along with the
BBC who should have not tried to stop her promoting the event. I
hope the BBC will see the error of their ways and reverse their
stupid position, though the chances of them doing so are probably
close to zero.

I see that Mr Livingstone has written a letter
http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/debate/letters/article226758...

&quot;Sir, It is a new low for the London Assembly member for Barnet,
Brian Coleman, to complain to the BBC about a children’s TV
presenter taking part in an event to promote cycling and fitness
(“Blue Peter woman defies BBC to share platform with mayor”, August
15).

&quot;There was no party political element to Konnie Huq’s involvement in
the launch of the Hovis London Freewheel – it was merely to promote
a fun, free event to encourage cycling in London, and supporting
this event cannot in any reasonable view be regarded as party
political. Konnie Huq’s involvement has been important in
encouraging almost 21,000 Londoners to register to sign up for the
event so far. The aim is to build on the massive increase of 83 per
cent in cycling in the capital since 2000 by getting more Londoners
on their bikes.&quot;

This is something which I agree with him about.

So your preferred rates are KSI/capita.  The question still stands, in
essence.  How did you decide that KSI/capita gives a realistic measure
of something?

It certainly doesn't reflect &quot;exposure&quot; to traffic.  Would you expect
your numbers to truly reflect the comparative &quot;dangers&quot; of using the
streets in a densely populated borough with much high-rise housing and
few streets, compared to one of terraced houses with many streets, or
compared to a wealthy one with well-spaced mansions on wide uncluttered
streets?

Was it because it is easier to find the population figures than it is,
say, to get the average time spent on the streets by each person, or the
journey lengths per person?

Thank you very much:-)

After a careful and thorough study of photographs of the dress I
think cycling in it would be no problem, as it is not too tight
round the legs. However it might be best to avoid a bike with drop
handlebars, unless the objective was to give those who like women
big smiles followed by heart attacks. There is also the question of
cycling in high heels, covered at length here before.

More seriously, how dare the BBC be so stupid as to try and prevent
her from attending the cycling event and then moaning about it
afterwards. They should reverse their decision and apologise for
their mistake. However, like any large organisation, the BBC are
probably not grown-up enough to do so.

&gt;&gt;Depends if you count people dying because ambulances can't get to them

&gt; An old tale that is often repeated, but remains an old tale.

&gt; Speed bumps are installed on roads off main roads. The ambulance can

&gt; speed bumps. The minor delay involved is nothing compared to the

Not strictly true. There are speed bumps across the main A713 in
Dalmellington, for example, just 100 metres down the road from the
ambulance station.

Just so. And ambulances have good enough suspension to cope with these
things anyway.

Speed humps generally are an utterly retarded idea. All the speed humps
I've seen only really affect people in small cars (who are likely to be
slow, timid drivers in the first place). A case in point is that they
put some in a local village at the start of summer. Any mid-size car
could travel over the bumps without slowing down since most of the bump
would pass between the wheels. Only small cars had to slow down. SUVs
could totally ignore them.

They caused the most vulnerable road users (cyclists and motorcyclists)
to have to leave their normal lane position and either go through on the
white stripe or in the gutter.

I've seen a speed bump cause an accident, too. They fitted full width
diagonal speed bumps on the perimiter road of the university I was at.
Again, large vehicles like SUVs could completely ignore them, but they
were responsible for me needing new ball joints on my ancient student
budget Mini every year (I never needed to replace them until they put
the speed bumps in). Cyclists had to get right in the gutter to avoid
the speed bumps. I saw a cyclist crash when he hit some debris in the
gutter while trying to avoid the bump, and the cyclist narrowly avoided
piling head on into a parked car (instead taking the &quot;softer&quot; option of
landing in a heap in the gravel, complete with plenty of road rash).

That's before getting onto the noise and pollution issues of forcing
cars to slow down and accelerate needlessly. They take drivers and
cyclists and motorcyclists attention off other traffic, instead to deal
with the speed hump. Pinch points and other &quot;traffic aggravating&quot;
measures are also dangerous to the most vulnerable road users (such as
cyclists). As is making sight lines worse - it's just inviting cyclists
to get rear ended. Having been rear ended by a car driver who didn't see
me recently, I can first hand tell you that this hurts.

Speed bumps are a moronic idea. I was glad to see the local village saw
sense and removed the speed humps they fitted only a month after putting
them in.
