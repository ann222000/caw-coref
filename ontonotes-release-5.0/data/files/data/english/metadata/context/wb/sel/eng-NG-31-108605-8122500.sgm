As a British citizen the actions of a group of residents in Ashtead saddens
and shames me and I feel that I don't want to be regarded as belonging to
the same country as these people. Ashtead is not too far from the Defence
Medical Services Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court - this is the
location at which many of the Servicemen wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan are
sent for rehabilitation. A charity associated with the military has recently
purchased a large (by British standards) 6-bedroom property in the nearby
village of Ashtead at a price of £1.6 million. Their intention was to use
the house as accommodation for families visiting wounded relatives at
Headley Court. However, this proposal has met with outrage from the local
populace - the &quot;commercial&quot; use of the property will devalue their houses
(it was previously used as a child-care provider), the local services
couldn;t cope with the influx of people (wasn't a 6 bedroomed house designed
with this many occupants in mind?), the presence of military families will
present a heightened security risk, and so - in reality what these people
are, in British parlance, NIMBYs - Not In My Back Yard.

If anyone is interested in finding out more, this matter is being discussed
on a couple of UK military forums, namely ARRSE and Rum-Ration - links to
the relevant threads below:

If there are any UK citizens who would like to add their names to a petition
to No 10 (it'll likely be ignored, but its another means of getting the
issue noticed) can do so here:

And finally for the eBay enthusiasts, here's an auction trying to find a
commodity that is extremely rare in Ashtead:

http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item;=190133536661

I am not a fan of email chains, however, if anyone can pass on the word and
garner support for the worthy cause, please feel free to do so.

Bloody hell I will. Before I joined up I used to play around there,
because my family live even closer to the place than Ashtead. I am
effing disgusted with these people, but from my own treatment when I
demobbed, I suppose I could have expected this. As John Major once put
it, 'bastards'.
