Can I quote this poem by Edna St Vincent Millay.
'Dirge without Music

I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.
So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:
Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned
With lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.
Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.
Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.
A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,
A formula, a phrase remains, --- but the best is lost.
The answers quick &amp; keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,
They are gone. They have gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled
Is the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve.
More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.
Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave
Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;
Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.
I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.'

Beautiful poem. I've always loved it.

Time out of mind can also be found in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet:

Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;

In Tolkien's The Hobbit:

&quot;The Bagginses have lived in the neighborhood of The Hill for time out
of mind., and people considered them very respectable, not only
because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any
adventures or did anything unexpected...&quot;

Sarah Teasdale's The Voice:

The living thoughts in me
Spring from dead men and women,
Forgotten time out of mind
And many as bubbles of foam.

Herman Melville's Moby Dick:

Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the
low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the
vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the
point of their spears. Though by the repeated bloody chastisements
they have received at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of
these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the
present day, we occasionally hear of English and American vessels,
which, in those waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.

Warren Zevon's Accidentally Like A Martyr:

The days slide by
Should have done, should have done, we all sigh
Never thought I'd ever be so lonely
After such a long, long time
Time out of mind

Steely Dan's Time Out Of Mind:

Tonight when I chase the dragon
The water will change to cherry wine
And the silver will turn to gold
Time out of mind

&quot;Time out of mind&quot; seems ubiquitous, once you  look into it.
Edgar Allan Poe uses it often.

Google took me to a site of classical literature that can be read on
line:

Dear L Mossford,

Hiya.

Nice thing yuh've done hear, tho' also see Babs' post about other
possible &quot;TooM&quot; sources, and consider possibly bob came up with it by
hisSelf, not borrowing any source at least consciously. Sometimes
things stick in our minds, like &quot;pursuit of Happiness&quot;; i'm clueless
to its wherewith, but do not approve.

I don't know much, so i have my research assistant, Maya Kalpa, look
stuff up for me. She unearthed some previous posts at rdotmdotd about
millay, and i found this nice. In an innerView/article sometime ago,
Suze Rotolo saieth regarding her high school days:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
}
">

I  didn't have too many friends. I was considered too weird. My idols
were Edna St Vincent Millay and Lord Byron, poets instead of movie
stars.
{

But bob probably knew about Edna before Susan, since his high school
English teacher has said he was pretty attentive.

Or not.

That said, if you read women authors, and also are innerested in
things related to bob, here's anne waldman reading &quot;Notes on Sitting
Beside Noble Corpse Alchemical-Elegy&quot;, for Allen:

Time Out Of Mind can also be found in my prescient and prophetic work,
Desk Notes from Mrs; Havishams's Chair.

Desk Notes from Mrs. Havisham's Chair
September 27, 1995
Time Unknown
Location: In my darling little one bedroom hide-away tree house apt.,
with its rows of bamboo tree tops lining my secluded outdoor patio,
huge, lush with hanging plants...and the bright sweet oranges a-
plenty
accented by verdant leaves, dangling at arm's reach outside my two
corner bedroom windows, against the backdrop of blue sky, all at eye
level while lying down on my bed where I sought respite to dream, to
rest, and to wait, among other things, some not so pleasant. West
Hollywood between Fountain and Sunset. A few blocks west of the
Guitar
Center and wee bit further still, from the Saharan Motel. And I think
a little harder, and a little further back, and I remember Sycamore
(Sept. 27, 1992. Forgive her.)

Welcome to La Angel!

What do I want?

Who is she?

What can she give me? Somehow, someway, something...something

When in doubt...

I'm always here, always near, not waiting.
Get Smart. Know me.
Love Always and Forever,
99.

you are not my god, you are not my rod.

nothing to say, I'm just here to play. Hey look at me, I'm climbing a
tree. I swear this is true - look, I'm turning blue - instantly I can
see that you are not of me and I must explain the truth of my claim -
I'm not losing air - oh yoo hoo out there (please don't stop &amp; stare)
as I would if I could and probably should were I a kid with no lid -
but I keep myself hid. I'm gonna keep climbing, and I'm gonna keep
rhymin' (don' care about timing).

What do you want from me? I'm stuck. I'm wearing
your crown like a wedding gown but all I do is hang around!!

I am your wife, your natural life. Baby, look from
afar - yes, that's where you think you are,
and where do we end my forever friend?

I would if I could but he won't let me go. He's
big and he's strong and he's running the show.

No, babe, it's you, the glistening dew -

It's hard to accept what you haven't found yet
so let me be honest.

I hear you are true, but you're making me blue,
I want to remember the things that you do.

I want to see me as I be me

to the pounding of my thesis
the genesis of my body

Hey Phil -
How's it hangin' ya old dog? Been a while since I liked yer style -
get my point? Yer in the joint - it's all over vacuous rover.

[Appr. Sept 30, 1995]

Mr. Dylan,

I'm so shy, but I'm gonna give it another try
I'm not interested in your songs
I've listened to them for oh so long
And some of them made me cry
Harder than a thundering sky
Alright, I must admit
I had smoked a little bit
But that is not the point my sire
Oh birdie on the telephone wire

Sumthin' bout ya makes me wonder
Where ya been t'capture your plunder
I'm not even sure at all
If it need to stand up tall
(let's jes forget about him, and also that guy named Jim)

The fact of the matter is - it ain't yours
And it ain't his -

IT'S MINE and mine alone, and
I don't even need no phone
To wake it up, my holy cup, and

We don't even need to speak
(you think that this getting weak?)

You work for ME, Mr. D.

This poem is a euphemism
(it in and of itself is jism)

Don't you ever wonder why
Listening to your voice makes you cry?
And why it's called an Adam's apple?
And Howard Stern endorses Snapple?

Jesus Bob, have a little shame
Look around ya, you hide your name
And drop your head, this ain't no game!

What is that thing down there
Hiding 'low your pubic hair
No wonder people stop and stare!

Mr. D, there's a girl down south
Who has the world's largest mouth
She is the one, the infinite sun
Your victory is just begun
This is your sign, behind the time
That 'tween you and me there is no line.
Oh my Lord, you look so fine.

I know we've stalled, but y'hear my call
I really am a pristine doll.

God damn you thief - you've got my meat
Get up off your solomic seat
Pepper that, you loser cat, I am the salt
Of a vanilla malt - shlurp thru' a straw - don't
Forget to floss - remember your roots!! (hoot hoot)
Toot toot - slow train cumin' - yer in the
TOOM - eric is King, I'll give him
A ring, and He would never tell me
To sing.

Am I a dope or your greatest hope?
Tag along \ Mr. Dong

She's got everything to chew
She's a Jew, she don't need you!

She made a seder plate, of the kind
No ball can brake...

If ya wanna know about her
Ya must snort a little powder...

Wellcum here my peer, ya don' need t' fear
Jus' follow all my laws an' you'll never have t' pause

Forget about the past, we're reunited at last
You can masticate and even slam the gate

A finger on the button is for the loser mutton
Forever &quot;he&quot; is she, and we know that is me...

*****

;)

Have a good day. I have to take it REAL EASY because I didn't sleep
last night, and that's kind dangerous for a an MD, also, I have a
killer toothache in my heel, plantar fasciities, actaually, it's all
over the bottom of my feet, it's hell, and I overate last night, my
stomach hurts, so for all reasons, I will see you later, my dear dear
dearest computer friends! :)

Love,
Rachel

To my knowledge, it shd be &quot;Waldman IS&quot;. Unless she passed &amp; i missed

I've seen/heard her a few times but not lately, including at Naropa/
Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics. &quot;Dynamic&quot; probably does
not do justice to her power, but the shortComing is the language's,
not yrs.

As to being in awe, Allen never really took much note of women; in his
journals wd marginalise them as adjuncts to men. But something there
was about her that led to them COdirecting the kerouac school at
naropa.

&amp; still reading Bill Morgan's &quot;I Celebrate Myself (The Somewhat
Private Life of Allen Ginsberg)&quot;, yeh, Allen wanted to be a rockStar.
I may've disagreed with someone 'round hear aWhile back. What did i
know. I'd still recommend this book to anyone innerested, not to pay
for, but to seek at Public Library. Which book suggests that Allen on
the Rolling Thunder Tour was, as per Larry Sloman, a Glorified
Groupie. Entitled as he was. Book also contains a reasonable account
of the Kerouac cemetary scene from Renaldo &amp; Clara.

As a poet and a performer, her sense of voice, body, and rhythm is
sublime. Here's the very end of her long poem, &quot;Notes on Sitting
Beside a Noble Corpse,&quot; an elegy for Allen Ginsberg:

Allen Ginsberg will never embarrass China,
Russia, the White House, dead corrupt
presidents, Cuba, the C.I.A. Universe again

But Allen Ginsberg will ever ease the pain
of living with human song &amp; story again
that's borne on wings of perpetual prophecy -
life &amp; death's a spiral!
He's mounting the stairs now with Vajra Yogini

Full Century's brilliant Allen's gone,

Oh, no. She hasn't passed. My cousin saw and heard her last year in

How fortunate you were to have experienced Jack Kerouac School of
Disembodied Poetics. All I know about it is from books. I've been
rereading  &quot;When I Was  Cool&quot; by Sam Kashner. Anne didn't like him, or
so he thought.
