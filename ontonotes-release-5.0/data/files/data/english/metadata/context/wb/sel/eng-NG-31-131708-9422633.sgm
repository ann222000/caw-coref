Did they record this for a future HD release?  It looked phenomenal,
they setlist might not have been as long as tb2000, but they sure have
come a long way with filming they're shows.  It look crisp and clean,
and colorful, it was awesome (well except for the in between bits where
is was grain for the artisticness of it).  I was always amazed at how
grainy tb2000 was.  Live at the garden was a step up, but this looks
really nice on dvd.  Well worth my 14.99.

What did you think was good about it?  It just seemed like a typical
whiner, complaining about what he didn't get from PJ, rather than focus
on what he did get.

First he whines that the backstage stuff isn't very complete, then he
whines about there not being more songs.  Whine, whine, whine.

I'm sorry, but every single inch of this DVD is fantastic.  Who needs an
interview with Boom when you have those incredible shots of him playing
the historic organ in that gorgeous church, and the tears in his eyes
when he's done?

Here's the thing.  I am the first one to complain about hearing Alive at
every show; but I will watch Alive on that DVD over and over because it
is simply the most incredible version, audience, and the artistry of the
slow-mo bits just blows my mind.  Who will ever forget the image of Ed
on the stacks and an entire arena pumping their fists and standing even
all the way to the back.  Amazing.  And the old Italian man talking to
Mike; funny as hell, yet somehow heart-wrenching content.

Doesn't mention any of the gorgeous and innovative shots which make this
DVD so special, the raindrops in the puddle timed to the guitar picking,
the shots of Ed in the puddle in Verona, the girl singing &quot;worldwide
suicide&quot;, and I could go on.

Terrible, terrible review.

******************************************************************
And here I thought he made some pretty good points.   It's a nice DVD, mind
you.  But, naturally, I more or less agree with him.  Beautiful cinema for
sure, but...I think he's right on the song selection.  They have a ton of
material they rarely touch or promote.  Who are they marketing to?  It's as
if they're always marketing to someone who has no idea of what their shows
are like.  Personally, I'd like to see less reliance on the old chestnuts
and a little more fanning out to the fans, since that's who's buying this
thing.  Some fans are happy with it, some think it would be better if it
were different.   Oh, sorry.  I mean, some fans just whine, whine, whine.

Also, I'd like an interview with Boom.  I don't know that I neeed one; but,
I would certainly enjoy hearing what the man has to say.  He doesn't seem
like a total embarrassment or anything.   Neither does Stone, for that
matter.

For me, it's kind of nice to read a review from someone a little removed.  I
always feel that way, no matter the politics of the situation--and no matter
what we're talking about.   A different perspective is a good thing.  I am a
heathen of the worst order.

So, to reiterate, I think it was a good review.  It wasn't a perfect one;
just like this DVD isn't the most perfect DVD ever made.  The review is
different than what you'll read in many places, and I think it adds
perspective.  There are people who like Pearl Jam, but don't think that
every minute of the DVD is fantastic.  This guy is one of them.  So am I.
He didn't write anything attacking the band.  He wrote down what he thought.
Dangerous stuff, that.

I'm sure you're right.  Doesn't make it a good review... It's not a
terrible review because it's negative (I can accept valid criticisms
like the setlist being too hits oriented), it's terrible because it's
poorly written whining about what wasn't there instead of what was there.

You make a good point.

Personally, I have no use for a DVD that profiles &quot;backstage tension&quot;
between the members of the band.  The more of that you put in, the
bigger risk you run of having your movie play a lot like &quot;This Is
Spinal Tap&quot; :)

I think that what Danny CLinch was trying to do was capture what it is
that makes Pearl Jam so captivating in a live setting, and why it is
that they have endured.  Anyone who goes to a PJ show can tell you
it's exciting (except for a few people who don't get it) but it's hard
to get the same feeling if you just watch a straight-laced concert DVD
that shows them playing the songs.  Don't get me wrong, I love all of
their discs, but I have never shown TB2K, Live at the Showbox, or Live
at the Garden to any non-fan as a way to get them into the band.
Why?  Because as a fan, those DVDs serve to remind us what it's like,
but it does not capture the real excitement of a show.  To get someone
into the band, I make a mix CD, usually, or make them a copy of a
show, and that works well.

But through clever, artful editing, along with a select few moments
showing the band members in a less-formal setting, you really get a
taste of just what the band is as a live experience.  That version of
Alive is probably as good a representation of the exhilaration of
seeing them live.  Sure, in real life, Ed doesn't jump around in slow
motion, but isn't that really close to how we all remember it when the
show is done?

Yes, the setlist could have used some work, I will admit that.  I
don't need a song off of every album or anything, but some GTF, DTE,
or Save You would have been lovely.  I can think of a lot of good
songs that would have fit on there.

On the other hand, though, after looking at the setlist, I never
imagined the treats that were in store between the tracks.  Ed
soundchecking Immortality is one of the film's strongest moments, and
if I had to choose between things as they are, and giving up that
moment for a better or fully setlist, well, I would choose the latter.

I don't think it's by any means a perfect product, but I think that
it's easily the most worthy DVD they have yet released, and that's
easily good enough for me.

Oh, and, Ed and MMJ performing &quot;A Quick One...&quot; is amazing beyond
measure.

Yes!  That's exactly what he has pulled off!  And at the same time, he
showed us the excitement the band feels and shows it from their
perspective.  I love the scenes during the encore breaks, where they are
so hyped up and figuring out which songs to play, and the comments made
about the audience, etc.

Anyone who goes to a PJ show can tell you

I think Alive is the perfect song on here.  The energy in that crowd is
incredible.  Not all audiences are like that, but of course, it's so
hard to portray the excitement of being there, like you said.  And so
this dvd captures that well.

I think Danny Clinch also captured the magic that was Verona, too.  And
that's hard to do.

Of course, but we don't know what the film of those songs was.  They
chose those songs because of the spectacular footage they had, and you
know, if it's only about the music, listen to the boot.  But if it's
about visuals, go with the songs which have the best closeups, the best
jumps, the best synergy.  I can't say it enough, as sick of Alive as I
am, I wouldn't give up that song on the dvd for anything; it is that
spectacular.

This thing is pure eye candy.

You can't understand how special that song is, because I was outside
there, waiting for the fan club ticket line to open (2 hours late! and
then they didn't have them in any order, so they had to just look
through the stacks until they found your name) and that song came
pouring out of that ancient place.  And now, to see it from Ed's
perspective is magic.

Exactly how I feel.  I judge it by what it is, not what I would like it
to be.  And it's a masterpiece.  Go to Danny Clinch's website and look
at some of his photos... this dvd is a thing of beauty.

Yeah, it's great being able to jump around without a chair in your fucking
way. Not in the front though. There you'll only find the die-hards who want
to be up front and the idiots who don't know anything except for how to
push. The best place to be in GA is somewhere between the frontline and the
middle. In the back you usually have the people who like to stand still and
sway a little. But if you move forward a bit you encounter the ones who
like to dance and jump, thereby creating more space to move. If you watch
the crowd on the DVD closely, you can see how it works.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's great being able to jump around without a chair in your fucking

&gt;&gt; push. The best place to be in GA is somewhere between the frontline and the
&gt;&gt; middle. In the back you usually have the people who like to stand still and
&gt;&gt; sway a little. But if you move forward a bit you encounter the ones who
&gt;&gt; like to dance and jump, thereby creating more space to move. If you watch
&gt;&gt; the crowd on the DVD closely, you can see how it works.

I only like GA if I have a good spot, and the good thing about GA is
you can determine your own spot :). I prefer to be in the front row or
right behind it, because further to the back I can't hold on to
anything if falling is near. In London we started too much to the back
of the front, so I had to leave and moved to the side. Front of the
left side: perfect spot :). Good view of the stage, room to breathe
and move, and still surrounded by the biggest fans.
Another big advantage of being at front: you can be taken out easily
if necessary.

groetjes,
Mirella :)

Staying in the front is key.  If I managed to get a spot on the rail
each time and keep it, I could probably do GA shows every night.  But
that rarely happens for me.

I remember at Irving Plaza last year, I started out in the row right
behind the rail.  Everything was great.  Sometime during GTF I got
swept about 8 or 9 people back.  I think SOLAT is finally what did me
in.  I had bruises for the rest of the week.  At a certain point, my
feet weren't even on the ground for minutes at a time and I was just
getting batted from side to side.

Ahhh... but it was all so worth it.  Anyway, that's why I am glad that
PJ doesn't do a ton of GA shows in the states :)

Even at GA you can get seats at a pretty good spot. In Italy, with the
aggressive crowds, I was happy sometimes to have a place up safe. We
just walked to the chairs above the side of the stage, and nobody
checked there and there was plenty of space to stand and move.
My best GA experience was Düsseldorf. Started up front, about 2 rows
back, and it was very wild but everybody was in such a good spirit and
looking after each other, I felt totally safe. Only when Breath and
SOLAT were combined, it was too much, so I went more to the back. And
it was fantastic there too. All the way to the end. Spend some of my
last jumping energy on Alive.

Mirella :)
