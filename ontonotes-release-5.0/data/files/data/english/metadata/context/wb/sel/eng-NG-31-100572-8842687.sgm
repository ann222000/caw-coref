&quot;Actually, I just handed in By Schism Rent Asunder. And in another
couple of weeks, I'll be handing in By Heresies Distressed. I'm not sure
what the scheduled release date for either book will be, but they'll have
the third book in plenty of time to position at my January of 2009.

As you may have observed sometimes happens with me, single books turn
into a book plus a sequel, and that's basically what's happened here. The
bad news is that I was supposed to have the second book in the series handed
in by the end of April, so I'm running about three months late. On the other
hand, three to four months is my usual writing time for a single book, so
since I'm actually handing in two of them, I'm about on schedule in terms of
production time. The other thing that this means is that I won't have to
hand in another book for TOR until January of 2009, which means that I'll
have at least until October 2008 to work on some of the Baen projects which
have lagged behind. Hopefully (and please note that I make no guarantees
here, given what tends to happen to my life and my work schedule) what's
going to happen is that sometime in August, I'll be starting on the sequel
to Shadow of Saganami. In the meantime, Eric will have been working on the
sequel to Crown of Slaves. As soon as I finish with Saganami 2, I should be
able to go directly to work on Crown 2, which should mean (note the
qualifier) that I'll have 2 Honorverse novels finished and handed in by the
end of 2007. That should give me the first six months or so of 2008 to do
the next mainstream Honor novel, and also the sequel to Hell Hath No Fury,
which Linda is already looking over. I'd really prefer to do the sequel to
Hell Hath No Fury before I start on the next mainstream Honor novel, since
I'll just have done two complete novels set in the Honorverse and I'll
really be able to use the break before jumping into the &quot;pull it all
together&quot; novel which will fuse the events and consequences of events from
the two non-Honor novels. Simon &amp; Schuster, on the other hand, would really
prefer to see nothing but Honor novels, in an unending succession, and I'm
not sure exactly how that's going to play out. Given that Toni will be
getting a total of three Honorverse novels in a space of under one year, she
ought to be able to keep the distributors -- and hopefully you guys --
reasonably happy while I work on the next multiverse book.

That's the idea, anyway. If everything goes the way that I hope it will
(which, however, it seldom does), I should be able to finish all of this up
with a couple of months to spare. On the other hand, next year is Sharon and
my 10th anniversary. We're planning on renewing our vows, and it looks like
I'll be attending the big book exposition in London in March of 2008. That's
not positive yet, but it's what we're working towards. And if it happens,
then Sharon and I will probably head on to Ireland for at least a couple of
weeks. That's where we went on our honeymoon, so it seems like an
appropriate place to go on our 10th anniversary. I'm sure that someone is
going to complain that I ought to take my laptop with me and continue
working away. However, the love of my life would hit me smartly over the
head (over and over) with a large, heavy, and very, very hard stone if I did
any such thing. That would tend to preclude any eleventh anniversary, and,
anyway, I do hope that you folks will concede that I should get to take at
least a couple of weeks off every two or three years whether I really need
them or not.&quot;

We can certainly understand their motivation here.

Sadly, of course, that probably isn't going to be possible.
Personally, although I enjoyed the most recent novel, &quot;At All Costs&quot;,
I felt that to some extent the overall plot was stalled - to a limited
extent, it could be considered as partly a re-hash of War of Honor.

Given the plot threads in &quot;Crown of Slaves&quot;, I noted one way in which
you might be planning to get out of the corner in which you might seem
to be painted - basically, given that the battles of the last two
novels with Haven were essentially needless, and instigated by the
forces of genetic slavery, the *main* charactor, Honor Harrington,
should somehow be fighting the *main* battle. Even though her forte is
fighting a different kind of battle.

The reason the first 10 books in the series were so compelling, of
course, is that they weren't *just* full of rip-roaring space battles.
We had a very sympathetic character, who experienced personal
tragedies, and despite setbacks, achieved the rewards she earned.

A story like that has to move forwards. It can't go around in circles
without becoming a different kind of story. There are ups and downs,
but they still add up to net progress. So, such a story leads to a
natural conclusion. Another down, and then an up, is probably all that
is left before things become interminable and thus ridiculous.

If all good things must come to an end, though, how will you and Simon
and Schuster support yourselves in the style to which you have become
accustomed?

There _is_ a way to keep doing the same thing over again without
letting it become stale.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the work of a very famous and successful author - whose work,
">

though, was more archetypal but also more formulaic than yours - this
can be called the Llana of Gathol strategy.

With novels like &quot;Shadow of Saganami&quot; and &quot;Crown of Slaves&quot;, you have
told very different kinds of stories in the Honorverse. The
protagonists of those stories have appeared also in the Honor
Harrington novels.

Other people who have appeared in these novels, however, are junior
officers in the Manticore naval forces who are on the command track.
Their stories won't be exactly like Honor's story, but they can
continue on while Honor herself has gone on to what is effectively a
well-deserved retirement. (Of course, between prolong and her sense of
duty, Honor is not going to retire, but she is going to get promoted
to a desk job pretty soon.)

And there are also NCOs whose stories have crossed Honor's path. So
one can tell a story that is different, but less different, from
Honor's than those in the sidestreams.

So one can avoid attempting to prolong (pardon the expression) Honor
Harrington's own story beyond the bounds of reason, and yet continue
to produce novels with nearly the proven commercial value of the Honor
Harrington novels themselves.

There is also the possibility of Honor, as Duchess Harrington, becoming
involved in Government.  I think maybe the best best is as commander of
the combined Havenite-Manticoran fleet that shows up to kick Manpower's
ass.

There is still a lot of play left yet I think.  After all...how many

We need Mesa to meddle enough that Manticore and probably Haven have
enough reason to go after them.  In the time before War of Honor we
simply didn't have enough motivation to send an invasion fleet way
around the galaxy and risk a confrontation with the Sollies.  Once the
two sides compare notes I think they do.

My take on the next book:

Once the rest of the Andermani ships finish their Apollo refit
Harrington takes the 8th Fleet on the inverse of Beatrice and demands
peace.

The manipulation comes to light, they go looking for the cause.

There are 11 Hornblower books, of which about half are novels, and the
other half are collections of short stories, or novellas.  The eleventh
book is incomplete, as Forester died before he finished it.

DW is already well ahead.  He's got 11 novels in the main series, two
more offshoot novels that he has co-authored, and 4 collections of
shorter stories, with contributions from other writers.

&quot;We&quot; (Manticore and Haven) need proof.  Solid, incontrovertible

For considerations, When Zilwicki and Cachat return with their dope,
think they are not going to share it with Torch?  Less see, Zilwicki
daughter is the Queen, and Cachat's girlfriend is the Chief of Staff,
and people have tried to kill their respective interests.

Hmmm, the Torch Navy gets outfitted with Haven Navy hulls.

.
Originally, because perhaps of the order in which I read the books at
first, my recollection of some items was somewhat confused.

So I somewhat unfairly perceived &quot;At All Costs&quot; as a near-rehash of
&quot;War of Honor&quot;. I see now that both books had their necessary place in
the story.

Since the &quot;real&quot; conflict is that between everyone and Mesa,
originally I had suggested that perhaps the next book should have
Honor Harrington run off with Lester Tourville - and do what Anton
Zilwicki and Victor Cachat are already doing. Since she is the &quot;hero&quot;,
she should be the one fighting the main enemy.

The next book coming out in the Honorverse will be more of the *side*
story. So things are moving to the point where Haven and Manticore
will have the *one thing* that can bring peace between them after so
much bloodshed and without victory by either side... a common enemy.
And if you think Elizabeth III is angry at _Haven_... her anger at
being played for a fool will be even greater, although, to her credit,
she will have learned her lesson, and not permit her emotions to make
her decisions for her. She will expend her fury in private so as not
to lose her dignity - and then her anger shall become a cold anger,
terrifying and majestic...and which Honor's special relationship with
her treecat will give David Weber an opportunity to describe.

Honor, commanding the six hundred or so remaining Havenite
dreadnoughts, combined with the shattered remnants of Manticoran,
Grayson, and (perhaps) Andermanni navies, defend Manticore, and Haven,
against an attack *by the Solarian League* instigated by Mesa? (And
how do they do it - frame Manticore for a violation of the Eridani
Edict?)

That would certainly allow a next novel fitting well into the previous
pattern.

But while &quot;At All Costs&quot; might not be justly described as a rehash of
&quot;War of Honor&quot;, there is still a danger of repetition; and &quot;At All
Costs&quot; has another flaw given its presumed readership - it tries a bit
too hard to engage *sentiment* in the reader. (At least, though, that
is change. The naval battles are exciting, but they aren't everything.
The human story and the political intrigue are important ingredients.)

Alternatively: if peace breaks out between Manticore and Haven, people
might *blame* Elizabeth III for things coming to Beatrice - as if what
happened on Torch wouldn't fool anyone - and we have Manticore and,
for different reasons, Haven, in a position of weakness, to deal with
a smaller threat - say elements of the OFS under Mesan control?

Repeating the cycle - and having Honor experience a setback, so that
she needs to start over again, as in &quot;Flag in Exile&quot; or &quot;Echoes of
Honor&quot; - is risky. Particularly after a book like &quot;At All Costs&quot;.
There are plot threads which mean that lots of exciting things can
still happen, but so much _has_ happened to Honor that extending the
saga in *some* ways will feel like cheating the reader. David Weber
intends to avoid this, as can be seen from the series as it exists so
far; but with Honor herself, it's going to get harder and harder to
manage. But then, I may be underestimating his talent.

The Sollies aren't nearly so monolithic.  Mesa may be able to get some
factions within the Solarian League to come in on their side, but others
within the League find Mesa so repugnant that the League will tear
itself apart if they try it.  Same goes for violations of the Edict. If
a Solarian fleet working for the Mesans violates it, the League is
liable to turn on itself

&gt; &gt;Fred Burton quoted David Weber as saying:
&gt; &gt;&gt; Simon &amp; Schuster, on the other hand, would really

&gt; &gt;&gt; not sure exactly how that's going to play out.

&gt; &gt;We can certainly understand their motivation here.

&gt; &gt;Sadly, of course, that probably isn't going to be possible.
&gt; &gt;Personally, although I enjoyed the most recent novel, &quot;At All Costs&quot;,
&gt; &gt;I felt that to some extent the overall plot was stalled - to a limited
&gt; &gt;extent, it could be considered as partly a re-hash of War of Honor.

&gt; &gt;Given the plot threads in &quot;Crown of Slaves&quot;, I noted one way in which
&gt; &gt;you might be planning to get out of the corner in which you might seem
&gt; &gt;to be painted - basically, given that the battles of the last two
&gt; &gt;novels with Haven were essentially needless, and instigated by the
&gt; &gt;forces of genetic slavery, the *main* charactor, Honor Harrington,
&gt; &gt;should somehow be fighting the *main* battle. Even though her forte is
&gt; &gt;fighting a different kind of battle.

&gt; We need Mesa to meddle enough that Manticore and probably Haven have
&gt; enough reason to go after them.  In the time before War of Honor we
&gt; simply didn't have enough motivation to send an invasion fleet way
&gt; around the galaxy and risk a confrontation with the Sollies.  Once the
&gt; two sides compare notes I think they do.

&gt; My take on the next book:

&gt; Once the rest of the Andermani ships finish their Apollo refit
&gt; Harrington takes the 8th Fleet on the inverse of Beatrice and demands
&gt; peace.

&gt; The manipulation comes to light, they go looking for the cause.

No, the kind of peace that Honor will be told to dictate to Haven will
prevent Haven from ever building up more than an anti-piracy force.
Only the Republic of Haven has the resources to build a fleet to
contend with what Mesa can liberate from the disintegrating sollie
fleet, but only if Haven gets front line manty tech to build into it.

[if this bears any resemblance to anything Weber writes, it is
entirely coincidental and I claim no ownership of it]

A better story would have Victor making a back channel diplomatic
meeting with Steadholder Harrington, in her steading.  Unlike the many
manticorans who can empathise with treecats, Victor Cachat actually
thinks like one, so one of the Grayson treecats bonds with him.  The
next back channel diplomatic meeting is an attempt to get see if any
treecats will bond to Thiesmann.  All the attempts fail, but Pritchard
is adopted, instead.

Presented with unimpeachable sources of Havenite good will and honest
intentions, Elizabeth accepts that someone else is pulling the
strings.  After mysterious suicides and assassinations are compared,
Manpower and Mesa are identified as the source.  Much intrigue and
mayhem ensues.

s/caused by/triggered by/ -- something like Mesa isn't big enough to
cause the Sollies to split up by itself, but it's clear from the stories

I disagree.

Harrington shows up over Haven and demands their surrender.  The top
Haven people ask to speak with her to explain what's been really going
on.  Since she can confirm they are telling the truth she's not going
to impose the sort of peace she otherwise would demand.

I don't think Harrington would shoot at that range if she didn't need
to.  She's going to want them as deep in her missile envelope as
possible so they don't get away.  The first engagements against the
Sollies will be the easiest and she will be going for killing their
forces, not merely driving them off.

Note that &quot;killing&quot; could also mean anything that takes them out of
the war.  Ex: Locate their flagship, fire a few pods at it.  When it's
gone announce that she's demonstrated that she can kill them and in
the interest of saving lives she's willing to accept their surrender
instead.

Your comment presumes that the Manties and Haven end up having to
fight ALL of the Solarian League.  I think that that's a rather flawed
assumption, since it seems much more likely that there's a breakup
of the SL on the horizon and perhaps what we may be looking at
is Manticore and her allies (including Haven) and also perhaps a
sizable chunk of the SL fighting against the part of the SL that's
in league (pardon the pun) with Mesa.

While I assume that, for dramatic purposes, the Manty side will
once again be outnumbered, perhaps it would be as bad as just
the Manties and Haven against the whole of the SL.

Actually, I am assuming that the Solarian League will break up.  I was
disputing the idea that Manticore and Haven would have a chance against
the entire Solarian League.  Oh I do agree that David Weber will have
Manticore and Haven out-numbered by their opponents (which IMO will be
only part of the former Solarian League).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It occurs to me there's another reason:  Technology.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When Mesa is exposed it's going to come to open war and I'm sure Mesa
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will somehow manage to bring the Sollies into it on their side.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Manticore needs enough of an advantage that they can take on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sollies.  There is also the issue that the Sollies are the enforcers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Eridani and thus they don't fear it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There's been speculation on Baen's Bar that even with Mantocore's more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; advanced technology along with Haven joining the Alliance that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Solarian League would win in the long run.  However, there has been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; strong hints that the Solarian League will be breaking up.  It is very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possible that the breakup will be caused by news of Mesa's meddling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; within the Solarian League.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Sollies are going to be helpless against Apollo.  It's basically
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going to be one pod for one Sollie ship.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Note that I said &quot;long run&quot;.  Image of the Manties firing their last
&gt;&gt;&gt; Apollo missiles and there are still SLN warships in their system.  The
&gt;&gt;&gt; Solarian League only has to win one battle and Manticore is toast.

&gt;&gt; Your comment presumes that the Manties and Haven end up having to
&gt;&gt; fight ALL of the Solarian League.  I think that that's a rather flawed
&gt;&gt; assumption, since it seems much more likely that there's a breakup
&gt;&gt; of the SL on the horizon and perhaps what we may be looking at
&gt;&gt; is Manticore and her allies (including Haven) and also perhaps a
&gt;&gt; sizable chunk of the SL fighting against the part of the SL that's
&gt;&gt; in league (pardon the pun) with Mesa.

&gt;&gt; While I assume that, for dramatic purposes, the Manty side will
&gt;&gt; once again be outnumbered, perhaps it would be as bad as just
&gt;&gt; the Manties and Haven against the whole of the SL.

&gt; Actually, I am assuming that the Solarian League will break up.  I was
&gt; disputing the idea that Manticore and Haven would have a chance against
&gt; the entire Solarian League.
&gt; Oh I do agree that David Weber will have Manticore and Haven out-numbered
&gt; by their opponents (which IMO will be only part of the former Solarian
&gt; League).

Not doing so would seem to take a lot of the drama out of the story.  ;)

My guess is that the first attack will be with maybe a 3:1 tonnage
superiority.  Harrington will let it get a ways in and then annihlate
it.  Some scouts might be able to get away and report the loss but
anything close enough to see what really happened won't make it back
out so the Sollies won't really know what happened.

They'll think the Manticoran weapons turned out to be better than they
thought and the Sollie commander was guilty of major overconfidence
and blundered into a trap.  They won't realize what they are up
against.

I expect the next attack at at least 10:1 but it won't fare much
better--an Apollo SD(P) can engage at 100:1 as long as they can keep
the engagement range where they want it.  At that point they will
really be shocked, I think Manticore will Beatrice them before there
is a third attack.

It's certainly true that Manticore could be embroiled in more wars.

If Manticore and Haven both realize fully what Mesa is up to, that
doesn't mean that the Solarian Empire would share their consciousness
- so, with a few judicious assassinations, Manticore and Haven might
have to face the Solarian Empire as a common enemy.

We've already seen Honor Harrington on half-pay, serving in the
Grayson navy, and we've seen her as a prisoner of the Peeps.

Despite the new weapons that Home Fleet has, given what is left after
Haven's massive attack, it would be difficult for Manticore to hold
off the Solarians. So, since stories would be less interesting with
Honor Harrington promoted so high all they let her do was push
paper...

maybe, not in the next novel, but the one after, Manticore and Haven
surrender to the Solarians... except for a small band of rebels, led
by Honor Harrington!

That would certainly make it possible for her to have exciting
adventures that could continue on for several books. After all, even
she might find it difficult to conquer the galaxy singlehanded in a
single novel!

It won't take many wipe outs before the panic sets in. At that point
everybody will start building a defense. Doing wild research and all sorts
of stuff most of which is not productive but much of which is.

However to repeat an obvious point, Mesa or at least the super race crowd
has at least a decent idea about what the SK can do because everything says
they've been spying as much as they can and they have had a lot of military
clashes with Manticore forces to gain some first hand datat from. Anything
that shows up from them is going to have a major defense component with
advanced electronics.

Beowulf is not completely in the dark either. The SL main fleet is and so
are most of the citizens of the SL but not everybody and once people decide
to dig a lot of improvement is likely to occur fast.

The SL must fishion if the SKis to prevail.

That'd work, even if they just tossed the pods out the hatch. I wonder

You'd probably want all the SD(P)'s for the fire control, etc.  But as long
as
your enemy is well out of range of your colliers, your SD(P)'s can save
their

I'm figuring the normal load of a SD(P).  There are a hundreds of pods
and two pods will almost certainly kill anything the Sollies have.

They'll throw their fossils at Manticore and get blown out of space

Why do I get the image of Japan thinking that they could *conquer* the
US?  Manticore could win the first war but there is no way that they
could prevent the Solarian League from coming back again much stronger.
We are told that there are thousands of systems within the Solarian
League.  It would be impossible for Manticore to patrol every system in
the SL to prevent them from rebuilding.

Manticore doesn't have enough ships.  The Solarian League is *big*.
Really really *big*.  Manticore could take out some of the main worlds,
and shipyards, but that just takes out whatever central control the
League has, causing it to break up into dozens of factions.  Beatrice
worked against Haven because Haven had tight central control over its
&quot;republic.&quot;  The Solarian League is a hydra.  Cut off one head, and it
grows a dozen more, each of them bigger than Manticore and Haven
combined, and each of which is capable of building their own ships.

Try going after the shipyards, and before you're half done, the rest
will have packed up and moved, without leaving any forwarding address.
They'll have turned into dozens of Boltholes, scattered throughout the
former League's warring factions

Even if the different factions leave Manticore alone, at first, they are
all going to be going after each other, and they've all got the
technological sophistication of Manticore, combined with the resources
of Haven.  They've seen what Manticore can do, and they are all going to
be very quick to duplicate it, with the pressures of a dozen different
wars with each other pushing that development on.  When some of them do
start to turn their attention towards Manticore, they are going to be in
possession of weapons that are every bit the equal of Manticore's, and
maybe quite a bit better.

Yes and No, if somebody took out Washington DC (including everybody in
the chain of succession for the Presidency), there would be some
confusion.  However, whoever took out Washington DC would be in big
trouble *unless* they had enough troops to have 'feet on ground' every
where in the US.  If Manticore 'took out' Earth, they would be unable to
prevent somebody pulling the Solarian League together for revenge.  For
that matter, just the *act* of taking out Earth might aid whoever took
power by giving the Solarian League a 'common foe'.

The USofA is a lot more homogenous, and united, than the Solarian
League.  The League is already barely just hanging together.

&gt; &gt;&gt; It occurs to me there's another reason:  Technology.

&gt; &gt;&gt; When Mesa is exposed it's going to come to open war and I'm sure Mesa
&gt; &gt;&gt; will somehow manage to bring the Sollies into it on their side.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Manticore needs enough of an advantage that they can take on the
&gt; &gt;&gt; Sollies.  There is also the issue that the Sollies are the enforcers
&gt; &gt;&gt; of Eridani and thus they don't fear it.

&gt; &gt;There's been speculation on Baen's Bar that even with Mantocore's more
&gt; &gt;advanced technology along with Haven joining the Alliance that the
&gt; &gt;Solarian League would win in the long run.  However, there has been
&gt; &gt;strong hints that the Solarian League will be breaking up.  It is very
&gt; &gt;possible that the breakup will be caused by news of Mesa's meddling
&gt; &gt;within the Solarian League.

&gt; The Sollies are going to be helpless against Apollo.  It's basically
&gt; going to be one pod for one Sollie ship.
">

Except that the RMN does not have enough pods, nor does it have the
capacity to make enough.  The SLN is really that big.  Even with
Apollo, it takes more than one pod to take out an SD.

The truly frightening thought is that The Crippler (from &quot;With One
Stone&quot;) is a piece of solly tech.  It would not have been developed as
far as it was, if it was not good for something.  The Crippler is very
nearly useless as a an anti-ship weapon, but it simply rocks as a
point defence weapon (with a range of one million kilometers).  Using
Apollo forces the missiles to bunch up, which makes them even better
crippler targets

The sollie stealthed missile is not useful, by itself, but Manpower
has some nasty clandestine ops capabilities that may be able to get
tracking beacons onto a number of RMN vessels.

Apollo is nothing more than a recon drone with a two-way FTL link that
allows the missiles to use the launching ships' ECCM computer to
counter the target's ECM, instead of the missiles' more limited
capabilities (Not that it is spelled out anywhere, but that is the
only possibility that makes any sense).  The only tricks are making
the grav pulse generators directional and small enough.  If you do not
care about stealth and efficiency, you just jury-rig the comm link by
modulating the recon drone's drive and the return signal is by
modulating the ship's drive.  It can probably be jammed, but a home-on-
jam feature allow some missiles to still pierce RMN counter-measures.

There would be little point to telegraphing a showdown between the RMN
and SLN, if there was no doubt about the outcome.

Nope. DW has said that the older League systems had been independent
for up to a thousand years before the SL was formed. Hence
fragmentation but not total collapse.
