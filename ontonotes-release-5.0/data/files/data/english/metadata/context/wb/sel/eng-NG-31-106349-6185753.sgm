&gt; It's possible some of the others mentioned like Jay and Henry were
&gt; kneeling, but there are several sources that claim Washington did not
&gt; like to kneel.

&gt; Most of the sites are of the Christianist vein.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The Library of Congress, from the collected reports of the various
&gt; patriots, recorded on a famous historical placard the effect of that
&gt; first prayer upon Congress:

&gt; &quot;Washington was kneeling there, and Henry, Randolph, Rutledge, Lee,
&gt; and Jay, and by their side there stood, bowed in reverence, the
&gt; Puritan Patriots of New England, who at that moment had reason to
&gt; believe that an armed soldiery was wasting their humble households. It
&gt; was believed that Boston had been bombarded and destroyed.

&gt; They prayed fervently `for America, for Congress, for the Province of
&gt; Massachusetts Bay, and especially for the town of Boston,' and who can
&gt; realize the emotion with which they turned imploringly to Heaven for
&gt; Divine interposition and – `It was enough' says Mr. Adams, `to melt a
&gt; heart of stone. I saw the tears gush into the eyes of the old, grave,
&gt; Pacific Quakers of Philadelphia.'&quot;
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Many of the sites refer to a placard from the Library of Congress that
&gt; gives &quot;Washington was kneeling there....&quot; quote.

&gt; They also refer to a letter from Adams to his wife. It is true that
&gt; Adams wrote glowingly about the prayer to his wife in one letter.
&gt; http://www.masshist.org/digitaladams/aea/cfm/doc.cfm?id=L17740916ja

&gt; However, Adams never refers to Washington kneeling in any letter, and
&gt; parts of what they attribute to Adams (`It was enough' says Mr. Adams,
&gt; `to melt a heart of stone. I saw the tears gush into the eyes of the
&gt; old, grave, Pacific Quakers of Philadelphia.') are from a different
&gt; letter that was talking about a different day and wasn't even talking
&gt; about a prayer.

&gt; Well I think I tracked down the roots of this myth.

&gt; But the deeper root of the story is an older book written in 1851 by
&gt; Henry C. Watson: The Old Bell of Independence; Or, Philadelphia in
&gt; 1776. The entire book is available online at several sites as an ebook.

&gt; http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/11506
&gt; http://www.ushistory.org/libertybell/more/oldbell.htm

&gt; The book appears to be historical fiction meant for children. It's
&gt; told in the form of old heroes of the Revolution sitting around
&gt; telling stories. The chapter called &quot;STORY OF THE PRAYER&quot; has the
&gt; story verbatim as referenced in the above sites.

&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------
&gt; http://www.ushistory.org/libertybell/more/oldbell.htm#ch05

&gt; &quot;What a subject for contemplation does this picture present. The
&gt; forty-four members of the first Congress, in their Hall, all bent
&gt; before the mercy-seat, and asking Him that their enemies 'might be as
&gt; chaff before the wind.' WASHINGTON was kneeling there; and Henry and
&gt; Randolph, and Rutledge, and Lee, and Jay; and by their side there
&gt; stood, bowed in reverence, the Puritan patriots of New England, who,
&gt; at that moment, had reason to believe that an armed soldiery was
&gt; wasting their humble households. It was believed that Boston had been
&gt; bombarded and destroyed. They prayed fervently 'for America, for the
&gt; Congress, for the province of Massachusetts Bay, and especially for
&gt; the town of Boston;' and who can realize the emotion with which they
&gt; turned imploringly to Heaven for divine interposition and aid? 'It was
&gt; enough to melt a heart of stone. I saw the tears gush into the eyes of
&gt; the old, grave Quakers of Philadelphia.'&quot;
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------

&gt; If Watson relied on a source, it might be the painting that was used
&gt; in the Liberty Window at Christ Church that is referenced in the
&gt; Library of Congress exhibit on religion and which they date to 1848.
&gt; http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel04.html
&gt; http://www.restore-christian-america.org/congress.html

&gt; The painting shows the scene of the first prayer. It depicts
&gt; Washington as one of the men kneeling. The painter is Harrison
&gt; Tompkins Matteson. One site claims that &quot;Every detail was fully
&gt; researched by the artist.&quot;
&gt; http://www.mccollectibles.net/Products/FPICad.htm

&gt; Yet that same site also states &quot;Textbooks never mention how General
&gt; George Washington knelt at Valley Forge and petitioned Almighty God to
&gt; spare his men and get them through that terrible winter—yet historians
&gt; have proof it happened!&quot; We know that is false.

&gt; Unless Matteson or Watson have an earlier source for this claim, it
&gt; appears Watson was simply taking poetic license to tell the story of
&gt; the otherwise documented prayer, and now people are passing Watson's
&gt; words on as historical fact. And if Lilliback is correct about the
&gt; placard, that would include the Library of Congress as one of the
&gt; disinformers.

&gt; I do know that Watson is guilty of misquoting Adams in reference to
&gt; the prayer (&quot;I saw the tears gush&quot;), but I suppose I can't say the
&gt; rest is definitely unsourced without finding out more about the
&gt; painting or whether Watson relied on some other source, but my hunch
&gt; is &quot;Washington kneeling at the First Prayer&quot; is a myth.

&gt; Anybody know anything else about this?

Subject: Question

Jim,

Are you familiar with this?

"Another debatable aspect is whether George Washington knelt in
prayer. The better indications are that he did not kneel in church but
did kneel in private. At that period of time, it was not customary for
males to kneel in church ... However, at the first Continental
Congress, the Reverend Jacob Duche, an Episcopalian, opened the
session on September 7, 1774 with a prayer. John Adams described the
scene in a letter dated that same day and addressed to his wife. Adams
wrote, 'Washington was kneeling, and Henry,
and Randolph and Rutledge, and Lee and Jay....'

Duche did give the opening prayer on Sep. 7, 1774. Washington appears
to gave been in attendance. However, I have not been able to locate
the John Adams to Abigail Adams letter cited above.

Do you have any insights that might get me headed in the "accurate"
direction.

Thanks,

The Library of Congress from the collected reports of the various
patriots, records the effect of that first prayer upon Congress:

Washington was kneeling there, and Henry, Randolph, Rutledge, Lee, and
Jay, and by their side there stood bowed in reverence, the Puritan
Patriots of New England, who at that moment had reason to believe that
an armed soldiery was wasting their humble households. It was
believed that Boston had been bombarded and destroyed.

(Washington is # 9 in the depiction)

We factually know that it wasn't said in a letter from John Adams to
Abigail. So who was the author...if any?

http://lcweb.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel04.html

(Extract)
The Liberty Window
At its initial meeting in September 1774 Congress invited the Reverend
Jacob Duché (1738-1798), rector of Christ Church, Philadelphia, to
open its sessions with prayer. Duché ministered to Congress in an
unofficial capacity until he was elected the body's first chaplain on
July 9, 1776. He defected to the British the next year. Pictured here
in the bottom stained-glass panel is the first prayer in Congress,
delivered by Duché. The top part of this extraordinary stained glass
window depicts the role of
churchmen in compelling King John to sign the Magna Carta in 1215.
(End extract)

Please note how this great Reverend patriot defected to the British in
1777....when it looked like the British might crush the "Rebellion."

to respond to his posts. When I go looking for original source

why I wrote my letter of indictment of the Library of Congress exhibit.)
