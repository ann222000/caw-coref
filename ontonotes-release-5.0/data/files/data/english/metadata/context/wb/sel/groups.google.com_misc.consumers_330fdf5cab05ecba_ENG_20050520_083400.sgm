May 20, 2005
The Chinese Connection
By PAUL KRUGMAN

Stories about the new Treasury report condemning China's currency
policy probably had most readers going, &quot;Huh?&quot; Frankly, this is an
issue that confuses professional economists, too. But let me try to
explain what's going on.

Over the last few years China, for its own reasons, has acted as an
enabler both of U.S. fiscal irresponsibility and of a return to
Nasdaq-style speculative mania, this time in the housing market. Now
the U.S. government is finally admitting that there's a problem - but
it's asserting that the problem is China's, not ours.

And there's no sign that anyone in the administration has faced up to
an unpleasant reality: the U.S. economy has become dependent on
low-interest loans from China and other foreign governments, and it's
likely to have major problems when those loans are no longer
forthcoming.

Here's how the U.S.-China economic relationship currently works:

Money is pouring into China, both because of its rapidly rising trade
surplus and because of investments by Western and Japanese companies.
Normally, this inflow of funds would be self-correcting: both China's
trade surplus and the foreign investment pouring in would push up the
value of the yuan, China's currency, making China's exports less
competitive and shrinking its trade surplus.

But the Chinese government, unwilling to let that happen, has kept the
yuan down by shipping the incoming funds right back out again, buying
huge quantities of dollar assets - about $200 billion worth in 2004,
and possibly as much as $300 billion worth this year. This is
economically perverse: China, a poor country where capital is still
scarce by Western standards, is lending vast sums at low interest rates
to the United States.

Yet the U.S. has become dependent on this perverse behavior. Dollar
purchases by China and other foreign governments have temporarily
insulated the U.S. economy from the effects of huge budget deficits.
This money flowing in from abroad has kept U.S. interest rates low
despite the enormous government borrowing required to cover the budget
deficit.

Low interest rates, in turn, have been crucial to America's housing
boom. And soaring house prices don't just create construction jobs;
they also support consumer spending because many homeowners have
converted rising house values into cash by refinancing their mortgages.

So why is the U.S. government complaining? The Treasury report says
nothing at all about how China's currency policy affects the United
States - all it offers on the domestic side is the usual sycophantic
praise for administration policy. Instead, it focuses on the
disadvantages of Chinese policy for the Chinese themselves. Since when
is that a major U.S. concern?

In reality, of course, the administration doesn't care about the
Chinese economy. It's complaining about the yuan because of political
pressure from U.S. manufacturers, which are angry about those Chinese
trade surpluses. So it's all politics. And that's the problem: when
policy decisions are made on purely political grounds, nobody thinks
through their real-world consequences.

Here's what I think will happen if and when China changes its currency
policy, and those cheap loans are no longer available. U.S. interest
rates will rise; the housing bubble will probably burst; construction
employment and consumer spending will both fall; falling home prices
may lead to a wave of bankruptcies. And we'll suddenly wonder why
anyone thought financing the budget deficit was easy.

In other words, we've developed an addiction to Chinese dollar
purchases, and will suffer painful withdrawal symptoms when they come
to an end.

I'm not saying we should try to maintain the status quo. Addictions
must be broken, and the sooner the better. After all, one of these days
China will stop buying dollars of its own accord. And the housing
bubble will eventually burst whatever we do. Besides, in the long run,
ending our dependence on foreign dollar purchases will give us a
healthier economy. In particular, a rise in the yuan and other Asian
currencies will eventually make U.S. manufacturing, which has lost
three million jobs since 2000, more competitive.

But the negative effects of a change in Chinese currency policy will
probably be immediate, while the positive effects may take years to
materialize. And as far as I can tell, nobody in a position of power is
thinking about how we'll deal with the consequences if China actually
gives in to U.S. demands, and lets the yuan rise.

would like and not so simple as the neo-economists
would like. What Krugman gives us is the logical rational
straight forward explanation of fiat currencies in competing
sovereignties. But in this case the US has forced middle
eastern sovereignties to take dollars for oil. The alternative
is to be invaded and to have the current regimes replaced
with American puppets. As oil is needed by China and
Japan and others then they must acquire dollars to purchase
that oil. China appears to be hedging as its major supplier
of oil could/logically should be Russia. Perhaps China is
able to acquire so much American ownership BECAUSE
it is getting a supply of oil from Russia. There is also the
notion that China will have control of the US government
with all that paper they have. What is the term of their
treasuries? 6 month? 3 years, 10, 20????? How quickly
can they tank our economy?

Political economy isn't just economics.

&gt; What is it that you find in error in
&gt; what Krugman has to say? It seems to be quite
&gt; straight forward and correct

"/> Quite straightforward, indeed; Krugman implies that
government borrowing (due to deficit financing) should
be expected to raise interest rates.

And straightforwardly INcorrect; this renowned 'expert'
has, as usual, screwed the pooch, intellectually speaking.

Time again for that beloved seminar, Economic Myths 101:
The popular fallacy is that, when the Treasury issues
bonds, interest rates rise, because &quot;the gov't is
raising demand for capital&quot;. But actually, when they
borrow, capital merely transfers from one account into
another; John writes a check to the feds (to purchase
a bond), who then transfer it to Sam, which goes into
his bank account, as the beneficiary of some welfare
program. The total available capital is unchanged!

What DOES affect interest rates is any real resources
consumed by gov't spending, as macro supply shrinks,
and consumers bid up rates. I.e. interest rates act
much like prices. But that's a result of SPENDING,
not borrowing (note the distinction). The process of
borrowing is merely an accounting method, a means to
finance the spending.

That jackass Krugman (pardon the redundancy) gets
this not an iota, but instead propagates the myth,
while blathering about &quot;confused professional economists&quot;.

"/> You really have this screwed up.

Here's why.

The settling price is a matter of supply and demand.
This is true for goods and services. It is also true
for borrowed money but I will talk about that in a moment,
right now I'm talking about the goods and services alone.
The settling price doesn't depend upon the source of the
demand only on the demand. It doesn't matter if one is
willing to borrow to buy or willing to take from savings
to buy.

Spending saved or borrowed money has real financial
implications. Saved money is available on demand but
saved money can draw interest which one forgoes by spending.
Spending borrowed money costs one the interest as well as
the principle borrowed.

Before one can spend borrowed money one has to find
a lender. The lender makes a choice to save and lend
or spend the money. The choice to lend or spend doesn't
depend upon what the spender spends the money but only
on the interest earned for the lender and the goods and
services upon which the lender could have spent the money.
The interest rate is a matter of supply and demand, that
is at what interest rates will the supply of lendable money
match the demand for borrowable money.

"/> All of this is well and good but you forgot something: We be
talkin bout _new_ money created by the banking system in
response to government spending:

The absolutes:

1. The total amount of money (both circulating and not)
will include the BONDS or Treasury notes which are
just interest bearing dollars. I say this because both the
bonds/Treasuries and the clearing balances/FRN's are
obligations of the US Treasury. All of it in total is the
amount of USA fiat money -- The value of which is
backed by the output of the US economy and the
land here in the USA.

2. But most people like to refer to money as JUST the
clearing balances and the FRN's (coins too I suppose)
as _money_ leaving the other IOU's (bonds/Treasuries)
as something different. This is a either a convenience
or a slight of hand depending on the situation. These
bonds are not actually _circulating_ money and being
spent on ice cream and thus have little or no effect on
the dollar denominated price of ice cream, e.g.
dollars recaptured by bond sales do not cause
contribute to apparent inflation.

I introduce this fact of all forms of government obligation
being fiat money because it is imperative to understand
that this money is created and controlled by government
as it deficit spends. In the present system if the government
did not deficit spend and redeemed over time all of the
bonds/Treasuries while removing FRN's with taxation
then we would have no money in the system at all:

1. The redemption of a bond/Treasury by the government
(includes the FED) will create FRN's or clearing balances.

2. The sale of a bond/Treasury by government will suck up
clearing balances and FRN's.

3. The spending of these FRN's or clearing balances
(the clearing balances or FRN's sucked up by sale of
Treasury notes and bonds) will place these right
back into the swirling pool of liquid money in our
system. Ergo: If government sells bonds to get
money that it then spends immediately then there
is no change in the amount of clearing balances
and FRN's. But there are some bonds in someone's
piggy bank.

4. The collection of taxes will do the same thing as
the sale of Treasury notes or bonds in that it will
remove money from the circulating pool of liquid
spendable money. And again, if the clearing balances
and FRN's are removed with a tax and then spent
back into the pool then there is no change in the
amount of FRN's or clearing balances (the pool
of circulating money). But in this case there is
no &quot;bond&quot; lurking in someone's piggy bank.

The difference between a tax and a bond sale is that
the tax leaves no residual government obligation
and that the TOTAL amount of money (money is
a government obligation) is therefore reduced
or held constant (depends on government
spending).

------ Now then ----

Having defined what money is we can address the
issue of the Chinese Connection:

Our government is becoming more and more obligated
to the Chinese and less and less obligated to us. And
if you like the Chinese controlling the congress then
just trot right on out and vote for a Republican.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> The demand for money puts an upwards pressure on interest
rates. The demand can come from those wanting to produce
some goods and needing to fund the resources. The demand
can come from those who see the supply and consider the
interest expense as less value than the usage of the goods.
(The two are the same, it's just where in the supply
chain one looks.)

Actually, I think I do believe a reduction in the
supply of goods doesn't cause upwards pressure on
interest rates. I beleive an increase in interest
rates moves both the supply and demand curves downwards.
It seems relative utility would determine if this meant
an increase, decrease, or no change in market price.

I believe a reduction in the supply of goods actually
puts downwards pressure on interest rates because the
expressed demand for money is lower at the increased
market price for the goods.

Somebody wrote of this situation as Red China's
greatest weapon (perhaps as a joke). Much of
the US goods come from China, including lots
of things that cant be made in the US anymore.
Plus they may control US financial system.
If the yuan floated to its true value, US interest
rates might double overnight and collapse the real

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Chinese Connection
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By PAUL KRUGMAN

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Stories about the new Treasury report condemning China's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;currency policy probably had most readers going, &quot;Huh?&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Frankly, this is an issue that confuses professional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;economists, too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This money flowing in from abroad has kept U.S. interest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rates low despite the enormous government borrowing required
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to cover the budget deficit.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you, Prof. Krugman, for demonstrating, once again,
&gt;&gt;&gt; that you are in idiot, if not a clinical moron.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The &quot;enormous government borrowing required to cover
&gt;&gt;&gt; the budget deficit&quot; has very little effect on U.S interest
&gt;&gt;&gt; rates, Chinese currency inflows notwithstanding.

&gt;&gt; Perhaps you might discuss the issue as opposed to
&gt;&gt; employing the usual right wing asshole approach.
&gt;&gt; What is it that you find in error in
&gt;&gt; what Krugman has to say? It seems to be quite
&gt;&gt; straight forward and correct

&gt; Quite straightforward, indeed; Krugman implies that
&gt; government borrowing (due to deficit financing) should
&gt; be expected to raise interest rates.

&gt; And straightforwardly INcorrect; this renowned 'expert'
&gt; has, as usual, screwed the pooch, intellectually speaking.

&gt; Time again for that beloved seminar, Economic Myths 101:
&gt; The popular fallacy is that, when the Treasury issues
&gt; bonds, interest rates rise, because &quot;the gov't is
&gt; raising demand for capital&quot;. But actually, when they
&gt; borrow, capital merely transfers from one account into
&gt; another; John writes a check to the feds (to purchase
&gt; a bond), who then transfer it to Sam, which goes into
&gt; his bank account, as the beneficiary of some welfare
&gt; program. The total available capital is unchanged!

"/>  Wow, talk about someone who needs Eco 101 for himself.

There is a time component for all your transactions!
Federal bonds have a different risk value.
As federal debt competes with higher paying alternatives
for the capital available, bond yields will rise. Then after
non-participating individuals see new yields, they will
enter the market changing total capital available.

And, BTW, your assertion that government bonds are *not*
an increase in demand for capital:

If commercial demand for capital is &quot;X&quot;
and personal demand for capital is &quot;Y&quot;
and government demand for capital was &quot;Z&quot;
but now increases to &quot;Z+n&quot;

then total demand for capital goes from:

Old Total Demand = X+Y+Z
to New Total Demand = X+Y+Z+n

If total capital available is suffient at interest &quot;A%&quot;
to satisfy &quot;Old Total Demand&quot;, then interest rates must
move to &quot;A+f(n)%&quot; to attract new capital. What confuses
the simpleminded neocon is that your &quot;Sam&quot;, on welfare,
can't invest in bonds. So your &quot;total capital available&quot;
goes down until &quot;Sam&quot; spends his welfare check, giving
that money to someone who can invest.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/>  More neocon BS. If Real Resources &quot;R(0)&quot; is total

why then, prices do not rise.

&gt;&gt; You really have this screwed up.

&gt;&gt; Here's why.

&gt;&gt; The settling price is a matter of supply and demand.
&gt;&gt; This is true for goods and services. It is also true
&gt;&gt; for borrowed money but I will talk about that in a moment,
&gt;&gt; right now I'm talking about the goods and services alone.
&gt;&gt; The settling price doesn't depend upon the source of the
&gt;&gt; demand only on the demand. It doesn't matter if one is
&gt;&gt; willing to borrow to buy or willing to take from savings
&gt;&gt; to buy.

&gt;&gt; Spending saved or borrowed money has real financial
&gt;&gt; implications. Saved money is available on demand but
&gt;&gt; saved money can draw interest which one forgoes by spending.
&gt;&gt; Spending borrowed money costs one the interest as well as
&gt;&gt; the principle borrowed.

&gt;&gt; Before one can spend borrowed money one has to find
&gt;&gt; a lender. The lender makes a choice to save and lend
&gt;&gt; or spend the money. The choice to lend or spend doesn't
&gt;&gt; depend upon what the spender spends the money but only
&gt;&gt; on the interest earned for the lender and the goods and
&gt;&gt; services upon which the lender could have spent the money.
&gt;&gt; The interest rate is a matter of supply and demand, that
&gt;&gt; is at what interest rates will the supply of lendable money
&gt;&gt; match the demand for borrowable money.

&gt; All of this is well and good but you forgot something: We be
&gt; talkin bout _new_ money created by the banking system in
&gt; response to government spending:

&gt; The absolutes:

&gt; 1. The total amount of money (both circulating and not)
&gt; will include the BONDS or Treasury notes which are
&gt; just interest bearing dollars. I say this because both the
&gt; bonds/Treasuries and the clearing balances/FRN's are
&gt; obligations of the US Treasury. All of it in total is the
&gt; amount of USA fiat money -- The value of which is
&gt; backed by the output of the US economy and the
&gt; land here in the USA.

&gt; 2. But most people like to refer to money as JUST the
&gt; clearing balances and the FRN's (coins too I suppose)
&gt; as _money_ leaving the other IOU's (bonds/Treasuries)
&gt; as something different. This is a either a convenience
&gt; or a slight of hand depending on the situation. These
&gt; bonds are not actually _circulating_ money and being
&gt; spent on ice cream and thus have little or no effect on
&gt; the dollar denominated price of ice cream, e.g.
&gt; dollars recaptured by bond sales do not cause
&gt; contribute to apparent inflation.

&gt; I introduce this fact of all forms of government obligation
&gt; being fiat money because it is imperative to understand
&gt; that this money is created and controlled by government
&gt; as it deficit spends. In the present system if the government
&gt; did not deficit spend and redeemed over time all of the
&gt; bonds/Treasuries while removing FRN's with taxation
&gt; then we would have no money in the system at all:

&gt; 1. The redemption of a bond/Treasury by the government
&gt; (includes the FED) will create FRN's or clearing balances.

&gt; 2. The sale of a bond/Treasury by government will suck up
&gt; clearing balances and FRN's.

&gt; 3. The spending of these FRN's or clearing balances
&gt; (the clearing balances or FRN's sucked up by sale of
&gt; Treasury notes and bonds) will place these right
&gt; back into the swirling pool of liquid money in our
&gt; system. Ergo: If government sells bonds to get
&gt; money that it then spends immediately then there
&gt; is no change in the amount of clearing balances
&gt; and FRN's. But there are some bonds in someone's
&gt; piggy bank.

"/> But no one seems to have caught the problem here!

From whence did the money come that will be used to
buy these T-bills?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 4. The collection of taxes will do the same thing as
&gt; the sale of Treasury notes or bonds in that it will
&gt; remove money from the circulating pool of liquid
&gt; spendable money. And again, if the clearing balances
&gt; and FRN's are removed with a tax and then spent
&gt; back into the pool then there is no change in the
&gt; amount of FRN's or clearing balances (the pool
&gt; of circulating money). But in this case there is
&gt; no &quot;bond&quot; lurking in someone's piggy bank.

&gt; The difference between a tax and a bond sale is that
&gt; the tax leaves no residual government obligation
&gt; and that the TOTAL amount of money (money is
&gt; a government obligation) is therefore reduced
&gt; or held constant (depends on government
&gt; spending).

&gt; ------ Now then ----

&gt; Having defined what money is we can address the
&gt; issue of the Chinese Connection:

&gt; Our government is becoming more and more obligated
&gt; to the Chinese and less and less obligated to us. And
&gt; if you like the Chinese controlling the congress then
&gt; just trot right on out and vote for a Republican.

&gt; --
&gt;&quot;I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers
&gt; of society but the people themselves; and
&gt; if we think them not enlightened enough to
&gt; exercise their control with a wholesome
&gt; discretion, the remedy is not to take it from
&gt; them, but to inform their discretion by

"/> blah blah blah
Thanks for the elementary lecture, which misses the point completely.

The process of gov't borrowing goes:
1. Investor Irving purchases a T-bill with a check
2. The funds transfer from Irving's account to a Treasury account
3. The funds slosh around some gov't accounts for a few weeks
4. Gov't sends Welfare Wanda a check
5. Wanda deposits the check

NET RESULT: Currency transfers from one checking account to
another, with a small frictional loss. NO EFFECT ON THE BANKING
SYSTEM.

What DOES affect interest rates is SPENDING on real goods. Because
no one borrows to wallpaper their house with Andrew Jacksons,
one borrows to BUY (consume) something, which they cannot immediately
afford. The interest is the premium for getting that couch TODAY,
rather than waiting a year; the cost of present consumption.

So when the Pentagon develops a new missile, they consume steel
and land and manpower. There resources are now unavailable to
consumers, who bid up prices on the rest (duh). But some of
those consumers were financing their purchases, and now bid up
not only the face prices, but also the present consumption price,
per the demand curve.

This is the simplest explanation I can muster, which, I would
like to believe, even you can grasp (don't let me down, forbis),
making you smarter than that jackass Paul Krugman (which isn't saying
much).

&gt;&gt; Time again for that beloved seminar, Economic Myths 101:
&gt;&gt; The popular fallacy is that, when the Treasury issues
&gt;&gt; bonds, interest rates rise, because &quot;the gov't is
&gt;&gt; raising demand for capital&quot;. But actually, when they
&gt;&gt; borrow, capital merely transfers from one account into
&gt;&gt; another; John writes a check to the feds (to purchase
&gt;&gt; a bond), who then transfer it to Sam, which goes into
&gt;&gt; his bank account, as the beneficiary of some welfare
&gt;&gt; program. The total available capital is unchanged!

&gt; Wow, talk about someone who needs Eco 101 for himself.

&gt; There is a time component for all your transactions!
&gt; Federal bonds have a different risk value.
&gt; As federal debt competes with higher paying alternatives
&gt; for the capital available, bond yields will rise. Then after
&gt; non-participating individuals see new yields, they will
&gt; enter the market changing total capital available.

"/> blah blah blah
If we consider the BORROWING PROCESS ALONE (that is
the crux of this discussion), the funds splash around
from some accounts into others. Gubmit is a TRANSFER
AGENT, from investors to politically rewarded factions.

Let me (optimistically) try to simplify it for you:
if you dip a bucket into a lake, the 'demand' for
water has increased, while supply has decreased.
Now if you immediately pour the bucket BACK INTO the
lake, what, besides a bit of splashing and a few
drops of spillage, is the net effect?

Now it's time for a pop quiz:
If the supply and demand for a commodity both
increase by the same amount, the effect on price
is ________________

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And, BTW, your assertion that government bonds are *not*
&gt; an increase in demand for capital:

&gt; If commercial demand for capital is &quot;X&quot;
&gt; and personal demand for capital is &quot;Y&quot;
&gt; and government demand for capital was &quot;Z&quot;
&gt; but now increases to &quot;Z+n&quot;

&gt; then total demand for capital goes from:
&gt; Old Total Demand = X+Y+Z
&gt; to New Total Demand = X+Y+Z+n

&gt; If total capital available is suffient at interest &quot;A%&quot;
&gt; to satisfy &quot;Old Total Demand&quot;, then interest rates must
&gt; move to &quot;A+f(n)%&quot; to attract new capital.

"/> Just brilliant, Einstein.

There is only a TRANSIENT effect as the funds transfer
among the Treasury and banks.

So, if Old Total Demand = New Total Demand, and Old
Capital = New Capital, then new interest rates = ______________

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What confuses the simpleminded neocon is that your

&gt;&gt;&gt; much like prices. But that's a result of SPENDING,
&gt;&gt;&gt; not borrowing (note the distinction). The process of
&gt;&gt;&gt; borrowing is merely an accounting method, a means to
&gt;&gt;&gt; finance the spending.

&gt;&gt; You really have this screwed up.

&gt; Not a bit, it's TRIVIAL.
&gt; The problem is that you complexify unnecessarily, like a student
&gt; trying to impress the teacher.

&gt;&gt; The settling price is a matter of supply and demand.
&gt;&gt; This is true for goods and services. It is also true
&gt;&gt; for borrowed money but I will talk about that in a moment,
&gt;&gt; right now I'm talking about the goods and services alone.
&gt;&gt; The settling price doesn't depend upon the source of the
&gt;&gt; demand only on the demand. It doesn't matter if one is
&gt;&gt; willing to borrow to buy or willing to take from savings
&gt;&gt; to buy.
&gt;&gt; ...
&gt;&gt; Before one can spend borrowed money one has to find
&gt;&gt; a lender... The choice to lend or spend doesn't
&gt;&gt; depend upon what the spender spends the money but only
&gt;&gt; on the interest earned for the lender and the goods and
&gt;&gt; services upon which the lender could have spent the money.
&gt;&gt; The interest rate is a matter of supply and demand, that
&gt;&gt; is at what interest rates will the supply of lendable money
&gt;&gt; match the demand for borrowable money.

&gt; blah blah blah
&gt; Thanks for the elementary lecture, which misses the point completely.

&gt; The process of gov't borrowing goes:
&gt; 1. Investor Irving purchases a T-bill with a check
&gt; 2. The funds transfer from Irving's account to a Treasury account
&gt; 3. The funds slosh around some gov't accounts for a few weeks
&gt; 4. Gov't sends Welfare Wanda a check
&gt; 5. Wanda deposits the check

&gt; NET RESULT: Currency transfers from one checking account to
&gt; another, with a small frictional loss. NO EFFECT ON THE BANKING
&gt; SYSTEM.

"/> (snicker)

Each month the debt grows bigger and bigger. From whence
does this money being used to buy these T-bills come?
If it comes from people's bank accounts then the
amount of bonds/T-bills could never increase without totally
draining M3. Perhaps you should reflect upon this for
a while.

&gt; What DOES affect interest rates is SPENDING on real goods. Because
&gt; no one borrows to wallpaper their house with Andrew Jacksons,
&gt; one borrows to BUY (consume) something, which they cannot immediately
&gt; afford. The interest is the premium for getting that couch TODAY,
&gt; rather than waiting a year; the cost of present consumption.

&gt; So when the Pentagon develops a new missile, they consume steel
&gt; and land and manpower. There resources are now unavailable to
&gt; consumers, who bid up prices on the rest (duh). But some of
&gt; those consumers were financing their purchases, and now bid up
&gt; not only the face prices, but also the present consumption price,
&gt; per the demand curve.

&gt; This is the simplest explanation I can muster, which, I would
&gt; like to believe, even you can grasp (don't let me down, forbis),
&gt; making you smarter than that jackass Paul Krugman (which isn't saying
&gt; much).

"/> The important point that I hope to make with
all is that at this point in time and since 1973
(actually before then gradually going back to
about 1900), all new dollars have been created
from thin air by the banks and the banking
system. Money was gold, then money was
gold certificates and silver certificates. Then
there was the fractional reserve system and,
yes, that predated the Fed. Then came the
&quot;thou shalt not own gold&quot; and then in 1973
the abandonment of an international gold
standard. At this point every new dollar
is a result of bank lending, primarily to the
US government. And ALL of the money
(including the bonds and T-Bills) are an
obligation of future tax payers. The
shape of the tax system is very, very
important.
