One of my Things-To-Do-Before-I-Die has been to be either a birth
coach for someone or at the very least, just an observer in a delivery
room.  I may now get my chance, but the circumstances are different
than I ever expected.  DH's niece is due any day now and she has just
asked me to be in the delivery room with her.  I'm not that close to
her, but DH has recently gotten very close with her as he's been
helping her through some tough issues, including preparing to give her
child up for adoption.

If there's anyone that's been part of a delivery in an adoption
situation, I would appreciate any pointers on things to do/not do.
Should I gush over how adorable the baby is or should I keep him at
arm's length?  What do I do if she starts to change her mind about
adoption?  This really is the best decision for her, but I know it
certainly happens a lot once mothers see their babies.

Thanks,
Annie

It's such a sad situation.  I've never been in it myself, so I don't know.
I just think that if I started to change my mind and someone talked me out
of it, I may resent that person for the rest of my life.  OTOH, maybe I
would thank that person later for helping me come to my senses.  I just
don't know.

I haven't been there, but here's my 2 cents anyway....

Take your cues from her. She may want to distance herself, or she may
want to gush, just try to remain neutral and go with what she's doing.
Throughout the birth, focus on *her*, listen to what she needs to get
through it, hold her hand, give her comfort, physical support,
whatever is necessary - like with any birth. You can offer things like
"you're doing the best for your baby" without really encouraging
either way. I wouldn't keep him at arm's length, but I'd be careful
about gushing too much.

I have so much respect for someone who puts their child up for
adoption, it's a wonderful gift.

">

In the past couple of years, I've read a lot of blogs written by women
who have placed babies for adoption years in the past, about their
experiences and how it's affected them long-term.  It has been an
eye-opener.

Prior to this, I recognised, in a lip-service kind of way, that placing
a child for adoption must be a Hard Decision.  But until I read some of
these experiences - and put them together with my own experience of
giving birth and how hard it was to have the baby out of my sight for
even short periods of time in the days immediately after that - I didn't
realise just how profoundly, utterly, horribly soul-wrecking a decision
it was. I didn't realise how deep a mother-child bond could be and how
deep the consequences of breaking that bond could go.

I didn't realise that giving a child up for adoption isn't something you
'get over' after an appropriate grieving period.  These were women who'd
placed their children years earlier and who found themselves feeling
worse, not better, as time went by.

I didn't realise that even if a birthmother feels happy with her
decision immediately after giving her child up, that isn't some kind of
convenient final scene over which the credits roll.  I read stories of
women who felt fine at the time and couldn't have believed the grief
they were in for once the whole what-a-wonderful-decision blissful haze
wore off and the reality of *losing that child* set in.

I didn't realise that no matter how good a decision to adopt might look
on paper, that really doesn't necessarily mean that it's the right
decision for that woman.  Women have raised children successfully in all
sorts of difficult circumstances and just the fact that raising a child
is difficult doesn't mean that giving a child up becomes less difficult.
I've read stories from women who literally feel that no difficulty
they could possibly have been through would have been harder than the
pain of losing that baby.  I remember one woman talking about how
adoption didn't give her any of the things it was supposed to - freedom,
chances in life, a happy carefree youth - it took away any chance of her
having those things.

I know you could say that maybe these are just a few bitter women who
are having a hard time adjusting, but I honestly don't get that
impression.  I've realised that we underestimate the effect that
adoption can have.  We want to think about it as a happy-ending
situation where the pain is some sort of manageable Hollywood feelgood
version of pain that'll all be worth it in the end, because it's really
difficult to accept just how much damage it can potentially do to the
women for whom it's supposedly 'the best thing'.

I don't think I'm putting this very well or getting across what I've
been reading in these stories.  I'm not trying to say that adoption
should never happen, or that it's never the best decision for a woman to
make for herself.  What I'm trying to say is that it needs to be her
decision.  And, by that, I mean an informed decision made knowing as
much as possible about the consequences - not a 'decision' made because
everyone's assuring her that this is the Best Thing To Do and letting
her think that Of Course It'll Hurt but It'll Get Better With Time.

What I'm trying to explain is... after what I've read, it gives me the
chills to hear about someone assuming that giving a child up for
adoption is the 'best thing' even if a woman wants to keep that child.
*Maybe it isn't*.  I know that I don't know her circumstances and you
do, but... she knows them even better.  If she really does want to keep
her child, then, no matter how good it might look on paper for her to
give that child up for adoption, it is almost certainly not better in
reality.

So, please, please, please... Be sensitive to what your niece actually
wants, not just what you think she should want.  If she starts wanting
to change her mind, give her space and time to talk about what she wants
(which may swing back and forth).  Don't hassle her, don't pressure her,
and don't assume you know better than her what's right for her life.
Not even subtly, not even well-meaningly.  If she wants to keep her
child, why shouldn't she have as much chance as you or me to do so even
though it's difficult?

All the best,

Sarah

&gt; &quot;That which can be destroyed by the truth, should be&quot; - P. C. Hodgell
">

I read this, and had the same thoughts, but didn't know how to express
them... I think you summed them up perfectly though.

Until I had my daughter, I always wanted to be a surrogate parent. I know
that's different, and that I would have entered the pregnancy *knowing* that
the child wouldn't be mine, but having carried her for 9 months, gone
through labour, and looked at her in pure fascination, I know that there's
know way I could have ever given her up. There is an unbreakable bond there,
and I couldn't even bear to sleep for the first few nights, as the gap
seemed so huge. I just don't think I could spend the rest of my life
wondering what she was doing/thinking or what she did/didn't know about
me...Of course, other people's views may differ, but like Sarah said, she
may well change her mind, and whatever may or may not seem like the best
answer, it is of course her right to keep her baby. Whatever she decides,
she needs to be the one in control of the situation, and wished must be
respected at all times.

I hope whatever she decides, it's the right decision for *her* and that she
gets the support she needs either way.

Wow, Sarah, you've obviously thought about this a lot.

There was an article in a recent LLL newsletter about adoption and
breastfeeding. At first everyone discouraged the birth mother from
breastfeeding, saying things like it encouraged bonding and so on. But the
mother of the birth mother said "The cleaner the bond, the cleaner the
greiving", it seems the first few days, the birth mother mothered the baby
as if it was her own, nursing on demand, rooming in whilst in the hospital
(each night, one of the birth mothers parents was present to support her).
The adoptive mother had planned to breastfeed and when this didn't work out,
although it wasn't planned, the birth mother decided to pump for the baby,
only stopping when moving jobs/state made it too difficult to continue. The
story was written in hindsight, by the birth grandmother and whilst it may
not be a perfect representation of the feelings of the actual birth mother,
it did all seem as if things had gone very well and that the early bonding
had been helpful, the birth mother had a chance to get to know her baby that
she had been carrying for 9mths and as it happens to be a semi-open
adoption, there has been ongoing information sharing. Seems to me there
really are no does and don'ts, for this birth mother, how her labour choices
affected her baby was very important to her, when it's often assumed by care
providers that this is not the case and a less thinking person may have gone
along with this.

I wouldn't do anything different than you would for a woman who was going to
parent her child.  At the time that she births it, it is her child.  Whether
she places the child or not, if it's beautiful, it's beautiful.  If she
decides to parent, as "wrong" as it may be to you, it's still her choice.
If she is going to place this child for adoption, then she's going to need
to say hello so that she can properly say goodbye.

So, just help her through the labor, and don't worry about what is to come
later.  That's her decision, and for her to work through.

&gt;&gt; What do I do if she starts to change her mind about
&gt;&gt; adoption?  This really is the best decision for her, but I know it
&gt;&gt; certainly happens a lot once mothers see their babies.

&gt; In the past couple of years, I've read a lot of blogs written by women who
&gt; have placed babies for adoption years in the past, about their experiences
&gt; and how it's affected them long-term.  It has been an eye-opener.

&gt; Prior to this, I recognised, in a lip-service kind of way, that placing a
&gt; child for adoption must be a Hard Decision.  But until I read some of
&gt; these experiences - and put them together with my own experience of giving
&gt; birth and how hard it was to have the baby out of my sight for even short
&gt; periods of time in the days immediately after that - I didn't realise just
&gt; how profoundly, utterly, horribly soul-wrecking a decision it was. I
&gt; didn't realise how deep a mother-child bond could be and how deep the
&gt; consequences of breaking that bond could go.

&gt; I didn't realise that giving a child up for adoption isn't something you
&gt; 'get over' after an appropriate grieving period.  These were women who'd
&gt; placed their children years earlier and who found themselves feeling
&gt; worse, not better, as time went by.

&gt; I didn't realise that even if a birthmother feels happy with her decision
&gt; immediately after giving her child up, that isn't some kind of convenient
&gt; final scene over which the credits roll.  I read stories of women who felt
&gt; fine at the time and couldn't have believed the grief they were in for
&gt; once the whole what-a-wonderful-decision blissful haze wore off and the
&gt; reality of *losing that child* set in.

&gt; I didn't realise that no matter how good a decision to adopt might look on
&gt; paper, that really doesn't necessarily mean that it's the right decision
&gt; for that woman.  Women have raised children successfully in all sorts of
&gt; difficult circumstances and just the fact that raising a child is
&gt; difficult doesn't mean that giving a child up becomes less difficult. I've
&gt; read stories from women who literally feel that no difficulty they could
&gt; possibly have been through would have been harder than the pain of losing
&gt; that baby.  I remember one woman talking about how adoption didn't give
&gt; her any of the things it was supposed to - freedom, chances in life, a
&gt; happy carefree youth - it took away any chance of her having those things.

&gt; I know you could say that maybe these are just a few bitter women who are
&gt; having a hard time adjusting, but I honestly don't get that impression.
&gt; I've realised that we underestimate the effect that adoption can have.  We
&gt; want to think about it as a happy-ending situation where the pain is some
&gt; sort of manageable Hollywood feelgood version of pain that'll all be worth
&gt; it in the end, because it's really difficult to accept just how much
&gt; damage it can potentially do to the women for whom it's supposedly 'the
&gt; best thing'.

&gt; I don't think I'm putting this very well or getting across what I've been
&gt; reading in these stories.  I'm not trying to say that adoption should
&gt; never happen, or that it's never the best decision for a woman to make for
&gt; herself.  What I'm trying to say is that it needs to be her decision.
&gt; And, by that, I mean an informed decision made knowing as much as possible
&gt; about the consequences - not a 'decision' made because everyone's assuring
&gt; her that this is the Best Thing To Do and letting her think that Of Course
&gt; It'll Hurt but It'll Get Better With Time.

&gt; What I'm trying to explain is... after what I've read, it gives me the
&gt; chills to hear about someone assuming that giving a child up for adoption
&gt; is the 'best thing' even if a woman wants to keep that child. *Maybe it
&gt; isn't*.  I know that I don't know her circumstances and you do, but... she
&gt; knows them even better.  If she really does want to keep her child, then,
&gt; no matter how good it might look on paper for her to give that child up
&gt; for adoption, it is almost certainly not better in reality.

&gt; So, please, please, please... Be sensitive to what your niece actually
&gt; wants, not just what you think she should want.  If she starts wanting to
&gt; change her mind, give her space and time to talk about what she wants
&gt; (which may swing back and forth).  Don't hassle her, don't pressure her,
&gt; and don't assume you know better than her what's right for her life. Not
&gt; even subtly, not even well-meaningly.  If she wants to keep her child, why
&gt; shouldn't she have as much chance as you or me to do so even though it's
&gt; difficult?
">

While I know that there are lots of women out there who did not have a
"happy" adoption experiences, I know that there are lots of women out there
who had better experiences than others.  I do think that open adoptions do
help birthmothers have better experiences than the old closed system did.
It is an incredibly hard decision, and one that I'm so grateful that 2
particular women made.

But the mail point that I want to agree with and reiterate is that whatever
she decides, it has to be her decision.  No pressure, no bias, no
commentary, no pushing.  If she wavers, give her time and space to waver.
If she asks you what she should do, you should say something like -- "It's
not my decision, but whatever you decide, you have to be sure."  And perhaps
give her "permission" to go either way, if that's what she needs.  But
mostly she will just need space to really work it out on her own.

&gt; I read this, and had the same thoughts, but didn't know how to express

&gt; Until I had my daughter, I always wanted to be a surrogate parent. I know
&gt; that's different, and that I would have entered the pregnancy *knowing*
&gt; that the child wouldn't be mine, but having carried her for 9 months, gone
&gt; through labour, and looked at her in pure fascination, I know that there's
&gt; know way I could have ever given her up. There is an unbreakable bond
&gt; there, and I couldn't even bear to sleep for the first few nights, as the
&gt; gap seemed so huge. I just don't think I could spend the rest of my life
&gt; wondering what she was doing/thinking or what she did/didn't know about
&gt; me...

Ah, but if you had an open adoption -- if you met and got to know and chose
the adoptive parents, and if you were able to have an ongoing relationship
with both the adoptive parents and the child as the child grew up, you might
feel differently and better about your decision, and it might be easier to
live with, as you would know that your child was safe, loved and happy.  You
would know that your child knew your name, and who you were, and why you
chose to place them -- out of love.  If your child had a question about
something, they could call you and ask.  So you wouldn't have a lot of
unknowns, and you wouldn't have a lot of "wondering."

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Of course, other people's views may differ, but like Sarah said, she may
&gt; well change her mind, and whatever may or may not seem like the best
&gt; answer, it is of course her right to keep her baby. Whatever she decides,
&gt; she needs to be the one in control of the situation, and wished must be
&gt; respected at all times.

&gt; I hope whatever she decides, it's the right decision for *her* and that
&gt; she gets the support she needs either way.

Absolutely.  It has to be her decision, either way.  If she feels pressured
or forced to place, she will have a lot of resentment and a lot more regret.
On the same token, if she feels pressured or forced to parent, she might
feel resentment and regret as well.  So either which way, it's got to be her
decision, and her decision alone.

You're assuming everything goes well after the adoption.  What if the
family has a divorce and then a custody battle?  What if they treat your
child poorly or abusively?  What if they lose everything and end up living
in the housing projects?  What if?  You don't have "wondering," but you'd
end up beating yourself up for putting your child in that situation.

Having had my own child, I am all the more awed and filled with even
deeper respect for those women who choose to give their child to
another family. It's an awesome gift, one many of us could not do.

However there are no guarantees in life, whether a child is adopted or
stays with his birth mother.

Why don't you ask on an adoption board? While your niece may well go
on to have her own
children one day, she will be childless for a time (I'm presuming this
is her first birth).
Most people on misc.kids have children and so maybe aren't the best
placed to think of all points of view.

It is a great honour to be asked to be there for her. Maybe she has
asked you because you are not
that close to her and she feels very comfortable with that.

It could also be a good idea to raise the subject with her before the
birth so it's out in the open.
You could suggest that you were going to follow her lead, but if there
was anything specific she did or didn't want you to do perhaps she
should feel able to tell you.

I liked what Jamie said...you are there for the labour and birth and
to help the Mum so focus on that.
Every birth is a miracle.

In this case (and probably most others as well), you also have to

My neice's first child tested positive for heroin at birth and was

And why wouldn't you assume that things are going to go well.  You have to
start somewhere, and assume something, don't you?  I mean, we all assume
we're going to live to the end of the day, if we didn't, we'd never get out
of bed.  Of course when a person makes a decision of that magnitude, or any
decision for that matter, they look at the best and worst case scenario, and
based on various risk factors, assume that things are more likely to turn
out one way verses another.

I mean, what if "you" (generic you, not Toypup you) decide to keep the baby,
and then things don't go well.  You become addicted to drugs, let a guy move
in who sexually abuses the child, and hits you both.  You and the guy both
lose your jobs and then the apartment, and you become homeless.  Don't you
think you might then beat yourself up over not having made different
choices?  Well perhaps if you are a drug addict you aren't thinking of
anything but yourself and getting your next score, but you see the point.

One extreme case verses another.  When a person choses to parent, the must
assume that things are going to work out for the best, just if one choses to
place that same child for adoption.

&gt; adoption is the lesser of two evils.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, other people's views may differ, but like Sarah said, she

&gt;&gt; &gt; well change her mind, and whatever may or may not seem like the best

I belong to a forum for my adoption agency, and see stories of the good
outcomes all the time.  Lovely ongoing relationships, positive words from
adoptive parents towards their children's birthparents, and positive words
from birthparents about their choice to place, and their choice of adoptive
parents.  Below is just a snippet that was posted today... An adoptive
mother had a visit with her daughter Anna's birthmother, T.  I think Anna is
about a year old.  IAC is our agency.

"I almost forgot to say this, but when we were visiting with T she was
telling me about how IAC had contacted her to speak with a potential
birthmom who wanted to hook up with a woman who had placed before. She
relayed to me parts of the conversation she had with this potential
birthmother and was telling me about some of the questions the girl had
asked her. She said that it was interesting for her to have to think back to
how she was feeling during her pregnancy, Anna's birth, and our relationship
since. She said the girl asked her if she regretted placing Anna and she
said, "Absolutely not. My only regret is that I was not in a position where
I could have raised her myself, but that was my fault, not Anna's. I chose
Anna's parents because she was meant to be their daughter and they were
meant to be her parents." She went on to explain the kind of relationship we
have with her and her family. The girl seemed absolutely amazed, T said,
that T could feel so secure in her decision and T told her that she said,
"You will just know in your heart what the right decision is and who are the
right parents for your child. It may be you, or it may be a wonderful couple
who are longing to be parents, but whatever the answer you will know in your
heart." I thought her words were so eloquent that I just had to share them."

Another parent writes this about their daughter's birthmother K.
"My sense is that K is also very secure in her decision. Very happy for us,
very excited to hear about Ella, but also confident that she made the right
choice. She's in the process of completing her prereqs and applying to
nursing school, which she's very excited about. (I think she'll make a
terrific nurse.) I know (and I suspect she knows too) that nursing school is
probably not something she could have done -- or done very easily -- as a
single parent. We're really proud that she's really pursuing nursing school
(she had a number of months where she was sort of spinning her wheels, but
this academic year she's really focused. It's wonderful to see.) "

When Taylor was a few years old, I asked Taylor's birthmother C if she had
any regrets about placing Taylor for adoption.  She told me that she has
never regretted the decision to place Taylor, but regretted that she got
pregnant in the first place, and had to make that decision.  But she has
always been very happy with her choice to give Taylor us as her parents.
Another time, in Taylor's first year, I told C that she was an angel to us,
that she swooped in and gave us the ultimate gift, when we weren't sure if
we would ever be a family.  She said that we were the angels, that we had
swooped in and saved her when she felt lost and had no idea what she was
going to do (in terms of finding a family for her child).

So although I know for a fact that there are lots of bad adoption
situations, I also know for a fact that there are lots of good adoption
situations.  Sort of like the rest of life.  There are good people and bad.
Good marriages and bad.  Good parents and bad.

I wish your neice the best, and hope that she doesn't get pregnant again
until she has her life together and wants to start a family.

I think I'd still rather know how my child was doing, than not.  Even if the
parents went through some issues, or divorced, I'd rather continue to have a
relationship and know how my child was doing, than never know anything, good
or bad.

&gt; One of my Things-To-Do-Before-I-Die has been to be either a birth

&gt; If there's anyone that's been part of a delivery in an adoption

&gt; Should I gush over how adorable the baby is or should I keep him at

&gt; adoption?  This really is the best decision for her, but I know it
&gt; certainly happens a lot once mothers see their babies.

&gt; Thanks,

Well, I was on the other end from you in this situation.
I think it depends a lot on if it's an open or closed adoption.  If it's
open, there's the possibility of birth family being in the child's life, if
it's a closed adoption, there's really no chance for that.
I would not try to steer her one way or the other.  This is her - and only
her - decision that she must make, and she must make in the best interest of
her and her child.
For me, in an open adoption, it actually made me happy to hear my mom say
how much DS1 looked like me, and every now and then, she still will say
that, and he's 7 now.  Out of the 4, he's really the only one that looks
just like me in almost every way.  I was glad to hear that others thought
(knew! ;) lol) he was a beautiful baby and absolutely perfect.  I wanted to
spend time with him as much as I could in the hospital, as I knew he was
only my baby until the adoption papers were signed.
I would go with what the mom (your/DH's niece) goes with.  If she wants to
spend time with the baby, let her.  If she doesn't, then let her do that as
well.  If she wants friends/family around, fine, and if not, fine as well.
And also, do what you feel.  If she wants everyone to gush over the baby,
but it's a closed adoption and you don't want to get close to a baby you'll
really never see again, then also do what is most comfortable for you.  I
know my parents/brothers/couple friends and other family members wanted some
time with DS1 as well.  They were going to be (and still are) a part of  his
life.  One aunt and uncle, OTOH, didn't want to see him at all because they
felt with adoption he would not be "ours" and they feel that it's easier to
not know what you'll be missing.  They made that choice for themselves, and
that was their choice and I accepted it, as I had expect them to give me
that same respect for my wants/needs/wishes as well.

I wouldn't be the one, in your case, to be talking to her about her decision
one way or another.  Leave that to the social workers/lawyers/counsellors.
Just be there to support her in whatever ways she needs, and if she's asked
you to be there as a coach and support during the delivery, then she will
probably be asking you for help if she needs.

Ah, right, so she already has experience. I imagine she has learnt a
great deal from her first pregnancy and made
her decision on how to have her second based on that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; It is a great honour to be asked to be there for her. Maybe she has
&gt; &gt; asked you because you are not
&gt; &gt; that close to her and she feels very comfortable with that.

&gt; &gt; It could also be a good idea to raise the subject with her before the
&gt; &gt; birth so it's out in the open.
&gt; &gt; You could suggest that you were going to follow her lead, but if there
&gt; &gt; was anything specific she did or didn't want you to do perhaps she
&gt; &gt; should feel able to tell you.

&gt; She'd coming over on Saturday and may stay a few nights with us as the
&gt; day gets closer, so we'll have some time to talk.  She's also written
&gt; out a birth plan with the adoption agency, so after I read that, I'll
&gt; know a little more what she's looking for.  I do know that she does
&gt; want to hold him at least once and she doesn't want to breastfeed.
">

I think unless she specifically says something you will just do what
feels natural to you.
It is perfectly natural to be totally overwhelmed with emotion when
the baby emerges (I was my sister's birth partner, so I have some
experience) and I think you'll both just live the moment (I hope that
doesn't sound too cheesy).

&gt; &gt; I liked what Jamie said.

&gt; Me too, as always.

&gt; &gt;..you are there for the labour and birth and

&gt; Yes it is, and I'm very honored and excited to be able to be a part of

Hi Annie,

I have been a labor support provider (childbirth companion) to mothers
opting for adoption.

Whether or not the mother bonds with her baby is up to the individual
mother. Some mothers want to see and hold their babies. Others want the baby
kept at arm's length. What does your husband's neice want? Have her adoption
plans been finalized during pregnancy. The more she plans for adoption the
less likely she is to change her mind after the birth. Does she plan on
meeting the adoptive parents? Is there any communication between her and the
parents who will be adopting? Sometimes it is wonderful to have both parents
present in the delivery room so they can see their adopted child born and
bond with him/her.

So many variables to think about. What are her adoption plans?

Hugs,

Carl

&gt; but it's a closed adoption and you don't want to get close to a baby you'll
&gt; really never see again, then also do what is most comfortable for you.  I
&gt; know my parents/brothers/couple friends and other family members wanted some
&gt; time with DS1 as well.  They were going to be (and still are) a part of  his
&gt; life.  One aunt and uncle, OTOH, didn't want to see him at all because they
&gt; felt with adoption he would not be &quot;ours&quot; and they feel that it's easier to
&gt; not know what you'll be missing.  They made that choice for themselves, and
&gt; that was their choice and I accepted it, as I had expect them to give me
&gt; that same respect for my wants/needs/wishes as well.

&gt; I wouldn't be the one, in your case, to be talking to her about her decision
&gt; one way or another.  Leave that to the social workers/lawyers/counsellors.
&gt; Just be there to support her in whatever ways she needs, and if she's asked
&gt; you to be there as a coach and support during the delivery, then she will
&gt; probably be asking you for help if she needs.- Hide quoted text -

Thanks for sharing this.  Knowing that she can choose an open adoption
is the only thing that is getting her through this right now, so it's
great to hear stories of open adoptions that worked well.

&gt; Hi Annie,

&gt; I have been a labor support provider (childbirth companion) to mothers
&gt; opting for adoption.

&gt; Whether or not the mother bonds with her baby is up to the individual
&gt; mother. Some mothers want to see and hold their babies. Others want the baby
&gt; kept at arm's length. What does your husband's neice want? Have her adoption
&gt; plans been finalized during pregnancy. The more she plans for adoption the
&gt; less likely she is to change her mind after the birth. Does she plan on
&gt; meeting the adoptive parents? Is there any communication between her and the
&gt; parents who will be adopting? Sometimes it is wonderful to have both parents
&gt; present in the delivery room so they can see their adopted child born and
&gt; bond with him/her.

&gt; So many variables to think about. What are her adoption plans?

&gt; Hugs,

She's written out a birth plan with the adoption agency.  She hasn't
shared it with me yet, but my husband was there when they wrote it
up.   The key things he told me were that she wants to have an
epidural and that she wants to hold the baby right after the birth,
but probably not anymore after that.  She does not want to breastfeed
and she wants other family members to be able to come in and see the
baby if they want.

She picked the parents last week and has met with them twice.  She
seems to reallly "click" with them which I think will be helpful in
having an ongoing relationship.  They've called a couple times since
and hearing how excited they are has been helpful.  They have one
adopted child already and are willing to take a child that may have
problems due to the mother's drug use.  They live a day's drive away,
so we aren't planning on them being there for the birth.  Even if they
are here in time, she does not want them in the delivery room with
her.

I think my biggest fear is that I'll get caught up in the wonder and
beauty of the birth and she'll be trying to distance herself.  I know
I'm going to just have to keep my focus on her and where she's at
emotionally.

Well first of all, I think the fact that this isn't her first birthing
experience should help. Secondly, who is going to parent this child doesn't
change how wonderful, amazing, and miraculous his/her birth is going to be.

&gt;&gt; Well, I was on the other end from you in this situation.
&gt;&gt; I think it depends a lot on if it's an open or closed adoption.  If it's
&gt;&gt; open, there's the possibility of birth family being in the child's life,
&gt;&gt; if
&gt;&gt; it's a closed adoption, there's really no chance for that.
&gt;&gt; I would not try to steer her one way or the other.  This is her - and
&gt;&gt; only
&gt;&gt; her - decision that she must make, and she must make in the best interest
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; her and her child.
&gt;&gt; For me, in an open adoption, it actually made me happy to hear my mom say
&gt;&gt; how much DS1 looked like me, and every now and then, she still will say
&gt;&gt; that, and he's 7 now.  Out of the 4, he's really the only one that looks
&gt;&gt; just like me in almost every way.  I was glad to hear that others thought
&gt;&gt; (knew! ;) lol) he was a beautiful baby and absolutely perfect.  I wanted
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; spend time with him as much as I could in the hospital, as I knew he was
&gt;&gt; only my baby until the adoption papers were signed.
&gt;&gt; I would go with what the mom (your/DH's niece) goes with.  If she wants
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; spend time with the baby, let her.  If she doesn't, then let her do that
&gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt; well.  If she wants friends/family around, fine, and if not, fine as
&gt;&gt; well.
&gt;&gt; And also, do what you feel.  If she wants everyone to gush over the baby,
&gt;&gt; but it's a closed adoption and you don't want to get close to a baby

Actually, that's the only reason I got through it, I'm sure.
Mine worked out fantastic, and still is.  DS1 and DS2 just got together just
yesterday, actually, to play for a few hours!
Good luck with it, and really, all I would suggest is go with what you get
from her.  If you don't know, outwardly ask.  There might not be an easy way
to ask something or bring it up, but try and remember that if she's old
enough to get pregnant and mature enough to make this kind of decision based
on what is best for her and her child, then chances are she's old enough and
mature enough to answer any honest questions you might have!
