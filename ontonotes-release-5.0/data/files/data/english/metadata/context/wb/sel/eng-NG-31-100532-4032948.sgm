I own an Automatic 1.8 GXE 2000 Sentra. I have 2 issues right now. First...
the backlights for my gears (1st, 2nd, reverse, park, etc) seems to have
died. Is there a way to get to the light or do you think it could be a fuse?
Also, My horn seems to mysteriously have died on me... don't really know
anything about horns so any suggestions? Also, is it possible it could
affect the airbag too? Thanks for any info.
Daniel

The horn is a known problem.  The wire abrades on the radiator and the horn
stops working.

I think there's a TSB on this.
