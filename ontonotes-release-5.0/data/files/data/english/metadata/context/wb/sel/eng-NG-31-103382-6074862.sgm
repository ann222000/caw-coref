Information is about organizing hierarchies.
So from time to time a new object appears able to group all those
objects which
were at the top level before.
Nature does it all the time. Universe, if something, is also alike

Then the process will continue to add new instances, now with a
different top level reference
Let´s risk that "knowledge" (please take it within the context),
challenges entropy itself as is able to give order grasping energy in
system which was unavailable before its appearance

As many people does, I work online. My system has one of those
customized Google home pages.
Today for some reason, that home page does not load, and this is
affecting all my schedule. If somehow Google disappears, I would be in
serious problems

Does anybody else here, as I do, think, work, decide and bases part of
his/her day on
Google?

So here I go: I think Google is becoming a new object, this could sound
stupid I know, shoot at me, no problem..

This is not about good or bad, is about hierarchy. Could Google be such
that object?

Internet obviously is, it is not longer just the sum of its parts of
course, but is a huge piece of hardware,
What I´m saying here is different. Is about documents.
As Internet is to computers, Google is to documents, as I see

Great post Einseele.
A fine addition.

Indeed information is about hierarchy, but maybe that hierarchy is also
decided by (the rational, emotional or e.g. material conditions of) people
like e.g. you, or Sam, Souvik, or me. Moreover, it is also decided by it's
listeners - me, you, Sam, Omar, Zinnic, ... -, it's ignorers (...), and the
intentional direction it is pointed at like e.g. here : the world community
on Google. (But that can also be any kind of specialists in one particular
field, or even animals, plants or any subjects).

Suppose for instance I direct my top hierarchy information, and my very best
attention and concentration connected to it, to future children, by means of
writing a book, let's say in an attempt to warn them for the mistakes we
made today. That would be a very different matter in comparison to pointing
this same top hierarchy information to children in front of a classroom
today. Because these children in these today's classrooms might want to
ignore it for reasons of 'other interests' like their MP3-players or the
latest computer game.

The current specific space and especially the kind of top information could
be very important in our considerations of info, because they too differ a
lot. Suppose for example I would want to spread (or it should spread itself)
my top hierarchy information about a new kind of killer virus in a mental
institution, or amongst a group of mentally disabled people in an open
community (which of course would all be affected too). In that case, I would
be in great trouble getting the message through, in comparison with going
live on TV to spread the info to the general public. The killer virus itself
though would have no trouble at all 'getting the message through' anywhere !

In addition, the danger in information hierarchy is that sometimes people
chose the wrong hierarchy - like in the case of the ideas of a political
ideology -, and henceforth violently force this hierarchy upon millions of
people by killing a lot of them (Stalin).

So I believe there are many very important aspects to information and its
hierarchy, and overlooking one of them - any one, mostly the best hidden one
- may render us very ineffective.

Cheers friend.
Thanks again for the great post.

Good topic!

Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it
universally accessible and useful. - Google Corporate Information,
Company Overview, at:
http://www.google.com/corporate

Also at that page:
"Googol" is the mathematical term for a 1 followed by 100 zeros. The
term was coined by Milton Sirotta, nephew of American mathematician
Edward Kasner, and was popularized in the book, "Mathematics and the
Imagination" by Kasner and James Newman. Google's play on the term
reflects the company's mission to organize the immense amount of
information available on the web.

Google's success has made it a household word. Not only do we google
to find information, we often also store information with Google.

Many issues and concerns have been raised over the years, like the
question whether or not Google should give in to China's wishes to
restrict access to pages that contain criticism of the chinese
government. Another issue is pornography. These issues have been
discussed extensively. I'll go into more detail on a few other issues
below:

- reliability

Can we trust upon Google to keep the information we want readily
accessable over many years? My view is that Google is better than
other services, but there's critical information and you've got
concerns about this, then why not store it at other places as well? No
reason to protest about Google....

- privacy

Google recently resisted court orders demanding information about
people's search habits; does anyone have an update on those cases?

- copyright;

A court in Belgium has demanded that Google does not make available
information without the express consent of copyright holders; Google
argues that webmasters can indicate on pages whether or not they are
to be searched, but Google has nevetheless complied and Belgium has
less search access as a result. Jan, any updates on this?

- social impact

What is the impacts of Google on the world? Clearly, it's huge! Google
is literally changing the way we store, find, access and handle
information, Google is changing the way we do business, meet,
socialize, play and think! Of course, there have been many innovative
services on the Net over the years, but the grasp and depth of Google
is awesome. Any further thoughts?

Cheers!

Hello Jan and Sam
Thank you both for adding to this post

Jan: The word hierarchy as any other else has multiple representations
Hitler or Stalin and so many other monsters alike, or even on the other
end, fine people like Ghandi or Teressa, do not represent the meaning
I´m talking today
I´m focusing hierarchy as certain order which can not be decided or
controlled once is installed, like an abstraction is
For instance, a file is part of a folder which is part of higher
levels, which are part of your system, which is part of a net, which is
part of .... The opposite direction is not possible

When you write C:\windows\desktop\my documents\whatever.txt, the sign
"\" represents a path which goes through different levels in a way
"up", or "down" or whatever you prefer to represent that difference. In
that sequence you can not decide or control a different order, if you
do, then you have a different information

A letter is part of a word (even if it is a word made of one letter)
and you will not have by definition a word being part of a letter.

Or dimensions,  a two dimensional system can not contain a 3rd
dimensional object, this includes even imagination

I´m talking hierarchy here within this boundary, those monsters above
never were in a different level than you or me.

The question about Google was within this context. I mean, can any
instance be thought like a document\document. I think yes. Google
should be an earlier attempt. Sam pointed well, we search Google for
information, and que also now store that information at Google, or
worst, we let Google index the information at our own side. Our
information is part of Google, being on OUR end.

I repeat I´m not saying this is good, or bad, or "someone has to do
something.." Or "let´s fight Google, demon on Earth". Nor I´m saying
this is nice, no.

If not Google, another will. I believe this because I also think
document\document is part of the evolution. May be the Genoma can be
thought as document\document.

Great post Sam.

About the Belgian issue I have no updates. But if the result is that we have
less search possibilities ? No good. Again it's all about the money for the
happy few, and not about world benefit. Stupid Belgians.

I think Google is great, and all the other search engines too. We all
benefit from it indeed to an unimaginable extend. And I hope Google stores
everything we post here on some supercomputers with lot's of backups, for
future generations to benefit from our information likewise.

Cheers.

Pardon my ignorance, but what do you mean by "Genoma" and
"document\document"?
I am familiar with genome. I am unable to recognize any hierarchal
relationship  in document\document. Does this signify that the folder
"document" has only one file which is the folder "document " . A class
that, as  a member of itself, constitutes  the entire class (I am what
I am, I am Popeye the sailorman?).

Google is a sysem (an object?) that acts as a depository, repository
and retrieval system for information. much like banks that serve the
same functions for finance.  In democratic political systems both
systems are protected from casual inspection but neither system
includes a "poison pill" that  precludes transparency of their records
in the event of control by extremist Governments.

I said Google is an "object" just to refer something as generic, as
saying "thing". So Google is a system, a lot of people, buildings, the
screen on my computer, a software, a huge hardware, and so on, that
collection if you want, I called "object"

May be document\document, is not the happiest election, although is
correct for what I intended to say
I wanted to express a hierarchy, where the sign "\" separates one level
from another. So in this case, and just for convention, the word
document to the left is different to the right word at right.
However they look the same, and that is important to me as trying to
make the point.

They are not referring to "folders" but to the idea the one at right is
part, is included, within the one at left

A document\document should be some like saying "a document of
documents"

Is obvious to me that Google's projects has as horizon something alike.
That immense document should have its more powerful component in its
TOC. As Sam said above, we are also loading that document, using it as
a storage machine, and we also are indexing our own content, and I
think is going so deep that sooner or later, Google or any other
"object" alike will have enough gravity to become that
document\document.

And then we´ll be in front of a singularity, as I see. But I wanted to
further, and that is the reason of the word Genome here

As the volume of that document grows, why not to think a quality leap
can occur

Now let me play with the idea the genetic code is a "document", just to
kidding around.
That document is able to represent all the information available for a
species.
Once in position  rebuilds a huge "documentation"

Much more over, it also carries the "documentation" of any other
species below,

Without going deeper into this I just want to to remark something
related to volume.

the word document at the left of "\" is the same that one at the right
on purpose. Their difference is just that one of them, the left, is
higher in hierarchy, As it is an embryo compared to any other cell.

So this is the question for this thread. Can Google or any other object
alike, become a document of documents, but as an embryo is compared to
any cell

Information is about organizing hierarchies.
So from time to time a new object appears able to group all those
objects which
were at the top level before.
Nature does it all the time. Universe, if something, is also alike

[&gt;&gt; omar&gt;&gt;] the human body is also such an object from nature, right? My
question is: is it only about hierarchy?

Then the process will continue to add new instances, now with a
different top level reference
Let´s risk that "knowledge" (please take it within the context),
challenges entropy itself as is able to give order grasping energy in
system which was unavailable before its appearance

[&gt;&gt; omar&gt;&gt;] yes and no...But let's stay in topic and take this assumption
for granted...at least for a little while.

As many people does, I work online. My system has one of those
customized Google home pages.
Today for some reason, that home page does not load, and this is
affecting all my schedule. If somehow Google disappears, I would be in
serious problems

[&gt;&gt; omar&gt;&gt;] Autonomy and the choice of resources is crucial to freedom, and
freedom is crucial to "objects" in this universe.  Though google
dramatically reduces the number of elements required to reach information,
it still cancels autonomy, thus freedom. Without power, a computer,
communication infrastructure, databases on servers ect... you wont be able
to use your "outside" data storage and communication services, and these
latter will also not "create" on their own. The fact though that the
infrastructure used is more of the public sector and is so massive, offers
greater guarantees, but the basic fact mentioned above is still there.  If
google, according to your assumption, is of the same fundamental
hierarchising nature of a human being, and the human being is thus just a
bunch of organic tissues and brain scanner like detectable phenomenas, your
frustration at having a bodily dysfunction or even at death should be all
the more greater.  Logically we could then assume that your unique objective
would be to eternalize your existence (this doesn't happen with making
children since they are not you). Is that the case? dont you think some
other element is missing? What could it be?

Does anybody else here, as I do, think, work, decide and bases part of
his/her day on
Google?

So here I go: I think Google is becoming a new object, this could sound
stupid I know, shoot at me, no problem..

This is not about good or bad, is about hierarchy. Could Google be such
that object?

[&gt;&gt; omar&gt;&gt;] google does indeed represent a new generation of information
systems.  Commercially it is a success because it has been able to use
actual technology to translate into a massive free enduser service, offering
an economically meaningful access to companies interested in reaching
different consumer groups.  The formula is particularly interesting because
it allows human size commercial interactions independent from economies of
scale factors having driven the industrial revolution era till the arrival
of internet. This said, however though I personally think this is just the
beginning of something huge, Google is not a new object, in the way you
mention it, because it itself lacks autonomy and freedom of choice (the
closest words I can find to avoid Spirit or consciousness, that you may
stupidly react on as you have done in the past).  It is and will remain an
instrument, a byproduct of humanity which can change it or destroy it.  If
though you like science fiction we can, without too much efforts, imagine
another sort of matrix like universe, where Google can be seen as the
ancestor of a coming super information robot able to draw information
interactively from a huge database, constituted of each other robots
experiences in all fields of the universe. Imagine this robot reduces to the
size of a coin, implanted behind our skull .... making us the arms and legs
of the robot...and so on. But this wouldn't work, why? You know my answer.

Internet obviously is, it is not longer just the sum of its parts of
course, but is a huge piece of hardware,
What I´m saying here is different. Is about documents.
As Internet is to computers, Google is to documents, as I see
[&gt;&gt; omar&gt;&gt;] I don’t think so... a better comparaison would be to compare the
computer to internet relationship to p2p programs to documents.  Further,
Google is a commercial venture whether the internet is intrinsically not so.

Hello Einseele,
Good point. The answer to your question is *yes* I think, it can. But it can
do much more than. It can be a point in a point, a function in a function, a
dimension in a dimension, all points in one point, all functions in one
function, and all dimensions in one dimension. The possiblilites are
infinite, even in an abstract way. And abstract is only one dimension of the
Googol amount.
Good addition.

Cheers.
Jan

I said Google is an "object" just to refer something as generic, as
saying "thing". So Google is a system, a lot of people, buildings, the
screen on my computer, a software, a huge hardware, and so on, that
collection if you want, I called "object"

May be document\document, is not the happiest election, although is
correct for what I intended to say
I wanted to express a hierarchy, where the sign "\" separates one level
from another. So in this case, and just for convention, the word
document to the left is different to the right word at right.
However they look the same, and that is important to me as trying to
make the point.

They are not referring to "folders" but to the idea the one at right is
part, is included, within the one at left

A document\document should be some like saying "a document of
documents"

Is obvious to me that Google's projects has as horizon something alike.
That immense document should have its more powerful component in its
TOC. As Sam said above, we are also loading that document, using it as
a storage machine, and we also are indexing our own content, and I
think is going so deep that sooner or later, Google or any other
"object" alike will have enough gravity to become that
document\document.

And then we´ll be in front of a singularity, as I see. But I wanted to
further, and that is the reason of the word Genome here

As the volume of that document grows, why not to think a quality leap
can occur

Now let me play with the idea the genetic code is a "document", just to
kidding around.
That document is able to represent all the information available for a
species.
Once in position  rebuilds a huge "documentation"

Much more over, it also carries the "documentation" of any other
species below,

Without going deeper into this I just want to to remark something
related to volume.

the word document at the left of "\" is the same that one at the right
on purpose. Their difference is just that one of them, the left, is
higher in hierarchy, As it is an embryo compared to any other cell.

So this is the question for this thread. Can Google or any other object
alike, become a document of documents, but as an embryo is compared to
any cell

An infinity of possibilities is 'pointless'  unless it is 'reduced' to
a finite number of probabilities by analytical reason. An infinity of

are revealed by a process of  reductionism, and an approach to
'knowlege'  of the 'whole' by synthesis from the highly probable.

My is name is Milton and my net-name is Tybee.   If you Google the two
together
you will find that I have written on the net about tybee, which is one
of my favorite spots.

"Google is a system."   It is but it can be described as many types of
systems, organizations, units, and on.  It is social (possibly one of
the largest human groupings and if not now, then later in the future.)
It is technological but has no or at least limited control over how
the endusers receive it.   It is literary, pictographic etc.  As a
broad human creation, it is striving with no endpoint in sight. which
means that it could be the largest human accumulation of information.
Google is many humans striving together for the joy of knowledge.

"document/document"   How about "includer/included"?  All parts of
Google are not documents.   There are many parts, of which documents
are only one catagory.   The largest aspect is  the "ideation" or
overarching human activity that makes Google possible.

"Genome as document"   How about Genome as communication, putting the
genome with other communications that are not documents?   Traditional
usage of "document" is something in a written or printed form and it is
only one form of communication.   In its communication, the Genome may
be closer to Google than any document.

Brilliant post Zinnic ! Thank you ! Razor-sharp, true criticisms, finished
by the greatest point of all ! :-) .

Let me clarify my point specifically, in order to defend it better in
general, and/or specific (.).

One.

If we analyse a point, I believe we have to say exactly *which* point we
mean, i.e. very and deeply *specific*, as opposed to the mostly very
superficial *generality*. We have to point to and point out very clearly -
like the direction of (the point of) an arrow that flies to it's goal -
*where*, *when* and *how* we define *which* point we want to analyse, and
*who* does it *why*.

Let *me* (who) give the example of *a point at the end of a sentence*
(which), *in order to prove my aspect of infinite possibilities* (why),
specifically *here-in-this-post* (where), *now* (when), and *by means of my
computer* (how) : *.*

Intermezzo 1.

The proof here of the validity of *specific* analysis in opposite to a
general one is that this specific point I put between two '**' differs from
any other point at the end of any other sentence, because :

(1) I (who) put it there in this post just two seconds ago (when) and nobody
else, even though anybody else (like you e.g., or Einseele, or an infinite
number of people) could have come here and put it there as well, and even
though I could have waited one, two, three, . ad infinitum seconds
(infinity) before putting it there (but I didn't wait one bit) ;

(2) it's place here (where) is unique because I could have put billions, yes
an infinite amount of different words - because of neologisms too - in
thousands of different languages between my *:*-sign and the *.*-sign, and
because anybody could do exactly the same on his or her computer, but the
computers would never be the same (again) ;

(3) I could think of an infinite number of ways *how* I could have put this
*.* there, because (4) I could erase that point and put it back again in
infinite iteration of which no iteration would be the same as the one before
(because of time), and because (5) I could do an infinite number of
different things (in different ways as well) *while* (at the same moment,
simultaneously) putting that point there.

(6) Reality as we conceive it may well be specific as well as general, but
in order for us to represent it specifically and truthfully with words or
symbols, we may have to respect it's eternal and infinite quality : change
(Proposition 1). That change can only be linguistically and symbolically
respected by temporary fixing it to the specifics *who*, *where*, *when*,
*why*, *how*, etc., after which already time has moved on in such a way and
added words have taken up such bigger a place that we have to change the
specifics *when* and *where* (not to mention who was listening, why he did
that, how he perceived those words, and why to continue anyway :-)).

Two.

Any point in any analysis can be considered as a starting point of
analytical reasoning, a point of finish, or a (any) stage to a (or any)
starting point, point of finish, next point or point before. If we start
this reasoning in our given example by looking at or thinking about the
point of sentence itself, let's say naming it or pointing at it with the
word *point* or the symbol *.* - ontologically, symbolically, intentionally,
the *aboutness* ; let's call this Proposition 2 -, there is no other
possibility for further analysis but to add words to it, and we cannot
possibly know yet how many words will suffice for our complete analysis. If
we start though from the proposition that infinity always is the true
starting point - Proposition 3 - because it incorporates, constitutes and
connects all points, we can call this starting point *ad ipse* the biggest
but one reduction in comparison to the starting point of infinity. *Sub
specie infinitis*, let's say, in the words of Spinoza's *sub specie
aeternitatis*. (The biggest reduction would be annihilating it). Hence
already we see here that, before we can even consider analysing a point, we
have to define our starting point, way, method, kind, length and depth of
analysis. And in fact, ad ipse natura, those specifications are already many
additions to our original point, and these additions might not have an end
at the end, but infinity again. (And circular proof could already start
claiming victims :-)). Hence meta-ontology is lurking in the dark.

Intermezzo 2

At this point we might better take a break, in order to prevent our brain
from exploding :-). Our point has already become so complicated that we have
to start thinking : is this really useful ? But we might also start to
unravel the biggest mystery of all : infinity. So let's continue ! This may
well be the infinite test of our brain capacity.

Three.

Knowing that we have to turn back to our specific point *.* pointed to by
*Jan* above, here on google and now, for reasons of clarification of his
point of infinity, respecting reality and replying to the brilliant critique
of Zinnic, let's go into *.* again.

The goal of most points at the end of sentences is to end those sentences.
We could quickly start sounding our trumpets of triumph now and shout :
there is the finite ! Stupid *Jan* has proven himself wrong ! But of course
infinite Jan would never give up. He would ask very friendly and very
politely - as we know hem by now - : please can you read that same sentence
again, because I meant something else with it. And by saying so, his
listeners would already have crossed that barrier of the point of that
sentence with their thoughts, fighting against the fierce temptations of
infinity. There is the infinite point !

Cheers !
