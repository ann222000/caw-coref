The anti-Churchillians have gone positively gooey over the Report of the Investigative Committee of the Standing Committee on Research Misconduct at the University of Colorado at Boulder concerning Allegations of Academic Misconduct against Professor Ward Churchill. To my way of thinking the acclamation with which this unctuous 125-page elaboration of the obvious is itself a reliable indicator of how low expectations are for the degraded institution that the University of Colorado has become. That a committee of tenured professors took five months to determine that Ward Churchill is an total fraud and plagiarist, a conclusion that any semi-literate sixth-grader should have reached in about 30 minutes (including a 15 minute recess), is hardly cause for celebration.

But then our hypothetical sixth-grader wouldn't have wasted our time with pieties about "threats to academic freedom", "socially marginalized ethnic groups", "challenging established narratives" and so on. The idea that it is perfectly acceptable to have a "scholarly debate" about whether the war against Japanese aggression was part of America's "racist agenda" (p.6) wouldn't have occurred to our schoolboy, and it is doubtful whether he would have found it necessary to publicly afiliate himself with the view that the US government's racist policies have "caused the deaths of countless indigenous peoples" over the past four hundred years. (p. 7) ( Has the US government existed for four hundred years?)

And what exactly is the gravamen of the offense of " disrespecting native oral traditions" (pp. 68,81)? The implication is that evidence from this source is of higher quality than other kinds of evidence and should be treated as sacrosanct, however bogus it may be. That certain "older people" told one Professor Yellow Bird that they "generally agree" that whites deliberately spread the smallpox virus to the Mandans in 1837 (p.58) is evidence that is entitled to no weight at all. Yet the Committee believes that Churchill's notorious account of the Fort Clark episode would have been just fine if only he had cited Yellow Bird as his source.

The mountain has labored and brought forth a mouse.

Parturiunt montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. Horace Ars Poetica, 9. Perfect quote for your posting which was very good. Still, we'll be glad when he's gone.
