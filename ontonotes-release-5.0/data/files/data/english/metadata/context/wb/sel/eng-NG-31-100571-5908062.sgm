1. Introduction to this FAQ

1.1. Welcome

Welcome to the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document for the
Usenet newsgroup alt.books.david-gemmell. This document attempts to
answer common or frequently asked questions, and provide pointers to
further information about David, his books and his life.

The FAQ tries to have a standard format. Each of the main sections
(numbered 1. 2. etc.) has a brief introduction, and then contains a
number of common questions and answers. Each question starts with Q
and a number (Q1, Q3 etc.) to make them easier to search for.

The author has tried to ensure the content of this FAQ is accurate,
but sometimes mistakes are made - if you know of any information in
this FAQ which is incorrect, please contact the author so it can be
changed.  However, please also remember, this is the FAQ for a
discussion group - and discussion by its very nature can be ambiguous.

This FAQ is in no way endorsed, supported or approved by David Gemmell
or any of his publishers.

This FAQ should be present in the alt.books.david-gemmell newsgroup,
the alt.answers and news.answers newsgroups and also on the web at,

http://www.gemmellmania.co.uk/content.php?article=20

The FAQ is also available at the Internet FAQ Consortium website,
along with some 3500 other FAQ's.  You can find the site at,

http://www.faqs.org

and this specific FAQ at,

1.2. Legal Bits

This document is Copyright (c) 1999-2004 by Tony Evans, all rights
reserved.

This FAQ may be posted to any USENET newsgroup, on-line service, web
site, or BBS as long as it is posted in its entirety and includes this
copyright statement.

This FAQ may not be distributed for financial gain.

This FAQ may not be included in commercial collections or compilations
without express permission from the author.

Q1. Ok, slow down, what's Usenet?

Rather than try to describe Usenet in my own terms, why not check out
this web site, which contains lots of documentation and is essential
reading for the newcomer to Usenet.

http://www.faqs.org/usenet/index.html

The information on that web site is also posted to the usenet groups
news.answers and news.announce.newusers which are also recommended
reading for new users to Usenet.

Q2. Where can I find more information on Usenet and netiquette?

Again, the above URL contains links to some very good documents, and
the reader is urged to look at "A Primer on How to Work With the
Usenet Community" on that site at least.

---------------------------------\\----------------------------------

2. The alt.books.david-gemmell newsgroup

Q3. What can I find in alt.books.david-gemmell?

The alt.books.david-gemmell newsgroup is a place for David's fans to
hang out and chat. As a result, you'll find conversations about many
different things, differences of opinion, questions, answers, thoughts
and feelings. It's intended to be a social place.

Q4. What should I post to alt.books.david-gemmell?

Some newsgroups prefer you to keep your conversation entirely
on-topic, and give a strict list of what that means. The
alt.books.david-gemmell group is a place for David Gemmell fans to
chat and mingle, and as such, almost anything of interest to the
readers is on-topic and fine for posting. However, please use your
common sense, and observe that the following will not be tolerated,

Any binary/non-text posting of any sort. Keep binaries to the
alt.binaries hierarchy. By all means, if you've got something
relevant to show people, put it on the web and post a link in
the group.

Any HTML/non-plain text formatted posts. Usenet is a plain text
environment. Many usenet readers do so using Unix systems and/or
text only applications. If you post in HTML, many people will
NOT be able to read your post. Don't do it. Do not post in both
text and HTML and think this will be better, it isn't, it
doubles the size of your post (at least) and just annoys people.

Advertising, SPAM, chain-letters, make-money-quick schemes, etc.
postings are not welcome. Keep them out.

As long as you avoid these types of postings, your message will
probably be on-topic and welcome in alt.books.david-gemmell.

Q5. I can't find alt.books.david-gemmell on my news server, what do I
do?

You have several options,

Request that your ISP adds the group.  This is fairly easy, and
can usually be achieved by mailing a relevant contact address at
your ISP.  This is the preferred option - since it increases the
propagation of alt.books.david-gemmell and so everyone benefits!

Try using a public access news server or a pay-for-use service.

Use a web based usenet reader, such as www.deja.com or
www.remarq.com - these solutions are imperfect since the web
isn't a good forum for usenet, but they do work.

3. David Gemmell

Q6. Who is he?

David Gemmell was born in London, England, in the summer of 1948.

Expelled from school at sixteen for organising a gambling syndicate,
he became a labourer by day, and at night his six-foot-four-inch,
230-pound frame allowed him to earn extra money as a bouncer working
nightclubs in Soho.

He has also worked as a freelance journalist with

I read recently (well, maybe several weeks ago?) that Gemmell's widow,
who had helped a lot with the first book (I forget if it was research,
ideas, plot, what), was going to finish the third book.  Also, the
second one's due out in...March 2007, I think?

Sorry I don't have a reference for the third book info off-hand; I want
to say it was either a news story somewhere, or a brief article in Locus
magazine.

Cheers,
Kendall

Stella is indeed working on and will complete Fall of Kings.

The second book came out in hardback in September of last year (Shield
of Thunder), so I suspect the 2007 release is the paperback.

"2006-09-01 - Fall of Kings

Transworld are delighted to announce that David Gemmell's wife, Stella,
is going to complete FALL OF KINGS, the final novel in the Troy trilogy.

David delivered 70,000 words of FALL OF KINGS to his editor the day
before he went into hospital, taking the story up to the final siege. He
had discussed the storyline with Stella who has been deeply involved
with the research and creation of the trilogy since its inception in
2003. He left behind him a chapter by chapter plan as to how each
character should develop and how he saw the final novel ending.

David's editor at Transworld, Selina Walker, says she's in no doubt that
there is no better person than Stella to conclude this magnificent
trilogy of novels in the way David would have wanted."

(from http://www.gemmellmania.co.uk/ )

Since David died, I haven't found much emotional strength to keep
updating the FAQ, but it's been 6 months now and I'm starting to feel
more able.

Hmm, not in the U.S. -- lucky you if you have it already!  ;-)  It's
coming out in hardback in March here.  Sniff.

Ah, this is probably the press release I read a while back.  Thanks for
the refresher.

Cheers,
