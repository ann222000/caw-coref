Three dead bodies turn up at the mortuary, all with very big
smiles on their faces. The coroner calls the police to tell
them what has happened.

Coroner tells the Inspector: "First body: A Frenchman, 72,
died of heart failure while with his mistress. Hence the
enormous smile."

"Second body: Irishman, 25, won a thousand dollars on the
lottery,spent it all on whisky. Died of alcohol poisoning,
hence the smile.

The Inspector asked, "What of the third body?"

"Ah," says the coroner, "This is the most unusual one. Danny
Earl, the Redneck from Arkansas, 30, struck by lightning."

"Why is he smiling then?" inquires the Inspector.

"Thought he was having his picture taken."
