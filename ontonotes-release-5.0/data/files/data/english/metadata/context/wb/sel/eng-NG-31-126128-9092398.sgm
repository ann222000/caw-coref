Now ya'll, and please forgive this intrusion.

It's not that i'm addled; i'm marginally conversant with things
automotive &amp; weaponryd &amp; dylnad, but not highly knowledgeable.

The reason i'm asking is i'm reading a book, and the author's narrator
mentions the firearms a young man in Montana in 1948 might have; one
of 'em a .410 shotgun.

NOW, regarding &quot;From a Buick 6&quot;:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead

i'd always thought, ignorantly i suppose, that it meant a &quot;Buick 6&quot;-
cylinder with a displacement, or is it torque?, of 410 somethings (cu.
in.?), fueled by leaded gas-i-leen, based on the Car &amp; HiWay
references.

I'm now having trouble finding a spec for any Buick product suchlike.
I do find but don't unnastan some info regarding a Buick Skylark that
might fit the model. I do also find a Ford product conforming, but
only in the 66 &amp; 67 (thin wild) Mercury, obviously postdating H61.

At the same time there was a thread sometime back hear where someone
posited that, against the grain of the automotive theme, the four-ten
was a .410 gauge shotgun, loaded with lead shot (not the best, but
adequate, birdShot).

I seek clarification from those more knowledgeable, &amp; i'm sure there
are.

Vinny Gambini: Ms. Vito, it has been argued by me, the defense, that
two sets of guys met up at the Sac-O-Suds, at the same time, driving
identical metallic mint green 1964 Buick Skylark convertibles. Now,
can you tell us by what you see in this picture, if the defense's case
holds water?
[Lisa examines the picture]
Vinny Gambini: Ms. Vito, please answer the question: does the
defense's case hold water?
Mona Lisa Vito: No! The defense is wrong!
Vinny Gambini: Are you sure?
Mona Lisa Vito: I'm positive.
Vinny Gambini: How could you be so sure?
Mona Lisa Vito: Because there is no way that these tire marks were
made by a '64 Buick Skylark convertible. These marks were made by a
1963 Pontiac Tempest.
D.A. Jim Trotter: Objection, Your Honor! Can we clarify to the court
whether the witness is stating opinion or fact?
Judge Chamberlain Haller: This is your opinion?
Mona Lisa Vito: It's a fact!
Vinny Gambini: I find it hard to believe that this kind of information
could be ascertained simply by looking at a picture!
Mona Lisa Vito: Would you like me to explain?
Vinny Gambini: I would love to hear this!
Judge Chamberlain Haller: So would I.
Mona Lisa Vito: The car that made these two, equal-length tire marks
had positraction. You can't make those marks without positraction,
which was not available on the '64 Buick Skylark!
Vinny Gambini: And why not? What is positraction?
Mona Lisa Vito: It's a limited slip differential which distributes
power equally to both the right and left tires. The '64 Skylark had a
regular differential, which, anyone who's been stuck in the mud in
Alabama knows, you step on the gas, one tire spins, the other tire
does nothing.
[the jury members nod, with murmurs of &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;that's right,&quot; etc]
Vinny Gambini: Is that it?
Mona Lisa Vito: No, there's more! You see? When the left tire mark
goes up on the curb and the right tire mark stays flat and even? Well,
the '64 Skylark had a solid rear axle, so when the left tire would go
up on the curb, the right tire would tilt out and ride along its edge.
But that didn't happen here. The tire mark stayed flat and even. This
car had an independent rear suspension. Now, in the '60's, there were
only two other cars made in America that had positraction, and
independent rear suspension, and enough power to make these marks. One
was the Corvette, which could never be confused with the Buick Skylark
[*ed note: here i insert falling down laughter--rdd*]. The other had
the same body length, height, width, weight, wheel base, and wheel
track as the '64 Skylark, and that was the 1963 Pontiac Tempest.
Vinny Gambini: And because both cars were made by GM, were both cars
available in metallic mint green paint?
Mona Lisa Vito: They were!
Vinny Gambini: Thank you, Ms. Vito. No more questions. Thank you very,
very much.
[kissing her hands]
Vinny Gambini: You've been a lovely, lovely witness.

Great question Dudley.

I think he meant a .410 shotgun. The largest engine GM made in those
days for sedans, if I recall, was a 409. The next size down was a 389
while the 427 was used in the Vette and maybe other muscle cars.
Unless somebody had the cylinders bored on a 389, there is no way
someone would round a 409 up to a 410. Â Typically, the Buick 6s in
those days were 250 ci hence it is unlikely that a 6 cylinder engine
would have such high displacement as those numbers are all for V-8s.
Kind of puts the song in a different light...

Definitely a .410 shotgun loaded with bird shot. Never mind the song's
title, the song has nothing to do with a Buick but check out the woman

Assuming the song mentions only one woman and not two (&quot;graveyard woman&quot; and
&quot;junkyard woman&quot;), then one can make the leap that he's talking about a
woman who owns a car wrecking yard (sometimes called a car graveyard or
simply a junkyard). Â It would be an ideal place for a person to hide and
perhaps Dylan's persona is hiding out in a wrecked Buick in the junkyard,
hence he's writing or relating the tale &quot;From a Buick 6&quot;. Â The reference to
the &quot;four-ten all loaded with lead&quot; is definitely a reference to a shotgun.
Junkyard owners who live on the property often keep a weapon on the premises
because they are frequently visited at night by scavengers &amp; other prowlers.

Nice talkin' to you Prez.

I've come to believe the reference to &quot;From a Buick 6&quot; meant that was the
sound of he heard coming out of the car window as it passed by. Â Whoever was
driving the Buick had the radio playing loud and the sound coming out of the

.....

I guess I always heard it as a .410 shotgun. Â The 6-cylinder Buick
always got me...I didn't know there were any back then. Â But that got
me to thinking about Stephen King's &quot;From A Buick 8&quot; about a man-
eating Buick Roadmaster (8 cylinder...V) where I think he tries to get
the record straight on Brother Bob's mistake on the Buick 6, and that
of course got me thinking about lists and then I discovered this
Stephen King list of the all time great rock songs. Â Well, the 24 top
rock songs. Â Most interesting is to compare the crowd in selection #5
to the crowd in selection #1. Â Now, the people are probably pretty
much the same age, but wow--are they acting differently. Â  Personally
I'm going to have to agree with this list almost in its totality.
It's from May 2007...about 4 months back. (Note: Â From a Buick Six and
On the Road Again don't make the all time list even though King quotes
Dylan quite generously in his books as everyone here knows....&quot;frozen
traffic&quot;...eh?....right?...Right.)
