Just got my DVD.  The Wren officer is very nice - couldn't care if she
hardly fits into the story!

I love your sigs, Eugene.  They're so damned funny! ... :)

btw, one of my favourite authors/teachers, Eckhart Tolle ("The Power of
Now")  talks about this quote in his book _A New Earth_  He says that "meek"
is translatable to "humble" and that "the meek" are egoless humans who enjoy
being themselves in the present moment and acknowledge others as not being
"better" or "lesser" than themselves.  Ergo, "the meek" are those who
experience the most appreciation of life, every life forms,  and all aspects
of living on this planet.  In that sense, they "inherit the earth".

Alll is forgiven.  I was brought up on the idea that usenet is like a

I was actually curious enough to see what she had been doing lately by way
of films, or even if she was still alive.  So I did some mad googling.  She
did quite a few guest star stints on t.v. up until the '80's but since then
has been quietly retired and living outside Dublin Ireland.  She was born in
1931.

Call me curious (yellow) on this one too, wondering if there had been any
other versions.  According to imdb.com, a really great t.v. documentary was
made in 1996 on Sink the Bismarck:

"Plot summary for
Sink the Bismarck (1996) (TV)  9.3/10 Stars

Detailed and fascinating documentary telling the history of the famous
German battleship of World War II. The urgent British hunt and the German
ship's efforts to escape are described through vintage film and
recollections of both British and German veterans of the battles. Written by
Bruce Wheelock { ... @qwest.net}"

Have you seen this?  I'm wondering if it is available anywhere for viewing
or purchase.  I'm so out of the loop media wise anymore, that I imagine it
has shown up on the History Channel a kadzillion times without my knowing
it.

Not on my favourite on-line store's list (no, it's not an on-line
store anyone would know - but it's around the corner and I save on
postage by picking up the offerings when they arrive).

And no, haven't seen it either - I very seldom watch TV.  The
offerings on it are crappier and crappier.  Or I am older and more
cantankerous.  Who knows?  I find one has to sift through an awful
load of dross for the occasional nugget.

Sagan? I watched his Royal Institute Christmas lectures (aimed at
schoolkids) probably the best science series I will ever see - pure
genius.

There was an excellent (UK) channel 4 (ithink) programme on the
Bismarck episode, concerned with searching for the ships, the image of
Hood's bell and stern will always haunt me. The book that went with it
was damn good too. The description of the effect of Hoods destruction,
by a survivor still makes my toes curl...

Well, my fav DVD search site, dvdpricesearch.com, only lists the 1960
film. And, IMDB fails to have any DVD details for the 1996 version.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Call me curious (yellow) on this one too, wondering if there had been any
&gt;&gt;&gt;other versions.  According to imdb.com, a really great t.v. documentary
&gt;&gt;&gt;was made in 1996 on Sink the Bismarck:

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://imdb.com/title/tt0283597/

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Plot summary for
&gt;&gt;&gt;Sink the Bismarck (1996) (TV)  9.3/10 Stars

&gt;&gt;&gt;Detailed and fascinating documentary telling the history of the famous
&gt;&gt;&gt;German battleship of World War II. The urgent British hunt and the German
&gt;&gt;&gt;ship's efforts to escape are described through vintage film and
&gt;&gt;&gt;recollections of both British and German veterans of the battles. Written
&gt;&gt;&gt;by Bruce Wheelock { ... @qwest.net}&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Have you seen this?  I'm wondering if it is available anywhere for viewing
&gt;&gt;&gt;or purchase.  I'm so out of the loop media wise anymore, that I imagine it
&gt;&gt;&gt;has shown up on the History Channel a kadzillion times without my knowing
&gt;&gt;&gt;it.

&gt;&gt; Not on my favourite on-line store's list (no, it's not an on-line
&gt;&gt; store anyone would know - but it's around the corner and I save on
&gt;&gt; postage by picking up the offerings when they arrive).

&gt;&gt; And no, haven't seen it either - I very seldom watch TV.  The
&gt;&gt; offerings on it are crappier and crappier.  Or I am older and more
&gt;&gt; cantankerous.  Who knows?  I find one has to sift through an awful
&gt;&gt; load of dross for the occasional nugget.

&gt; I'm in agreement there.  I barely know how the remote control works; I'm not
&gt; familiar with most of the channels that I receive.  I still have &lt;cough
&gt; cough&gt; a console television set, prolly 70's vintage .

&gt;&gt;   Man masters nature not by force but by understanding. This is why
&gt;&gt; science has succeeded where magic failed: because it has looked for no
&gt;&gt; spell to cast over nature.
&gt;&gt;   Jacob Bronowski

&gt; Now, this is a guy whom IIRC, presented a good series, &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot; a
&gt; long long time ago.  I also enjoyed the Carl Sagan series in the '80's, &quot;The
&gt; Cosmos&quot;.  I guess there *was* good t.v. once upon a time.
">

Some not as long as ago as you might make out. Among relatively recent
shows that we now have on DVD include The West Wing, Lois &amp; Clark, Titus,
Babylon 5, Stargate SG-1, Boston Legal and Sports Night. If Doctor, Doctor
( With Matt Frewer ), and Becker were available, we'd have them, too.

Plus, the whole old Twilight Zone, and the good season of the 80s redux.

Cosmos can be bought on DVD, for about $80.

&gt; btw, I used to be a great fan of Sagan and so it was serendipity that I

Ouch. Well, better that more survive than less.

&gt;I love your sigs, Eugene.  They're so damned funny! ... :)

&gt;btw, one of my favourite authors/teachers, Eckhart Tolle (&quot;The Power of
&gt;Now&quot;)  talks about this quote in his book _A New Earth_  He says that &quot;meek&quot;
&gt;is translatable to &quot;humble&quot; and that &quot;the meek&quot; are egoless humans who enjoy
&gt;being themselves in the present moment and acknowledge others as not being
&gt;&quot;better&quot; or &quot;lesser&quot; than themselves.  Ergo, &quot;the meek&quot; are those who
&gt;experience the most appreciation of life, every life forms,  and all aspects
&gt;of living on this planet.  In that sense, they &quot;inherit the earth&quot;.

OTOH, one could argue that we _all_, in the end, inherit the earth (or
some little chunk of it) and nothing else.

&gt;&gt;Damned!  I still need a proofreader ...;(

&gt;&gt;I meant to write &quot;better&quot; or &quot;lesser&quot; than *others* .....

&gt;Alll is forgiven.  I was brought up on the idea that usenet is like a
&gt;pub.  We don't quibble about the odd spelling or incorrect grammatical
&gt;statement here - we write as we speak.

&gt;Except for the anally retentive amongst us, of course!

IMO posting to natter about either spelling or grammer (or even
capitalization conventions) is a step down from writing on the wall
above the urinal.

With this exception of course. Some very funny (unintentioally funny
but funny none the less) things get by the internal proofreader.

The Frogmen and Morituri. Its a Fox release.
