Leading indicators point down for GOP

By DAVID ESPO, AP Special Correspondent 48 minutes ago

It is gallows humor time for Republicans in Congress, where one lawmaker
jokes that &quot;there's talk about us going the way of the Whigs,&quot; the 19th century
political party long extinct.
&quot;That's not going to happen,&quot; Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., hastens to add, although
a little more than a year before the 2008 election, the major leading
political  indicators still point downward for a party abruptly turned out of power
in  2006.
Fundraising for Republican campaign organizations lags. That is strikingly so
in the House, where the party committee spent more than it raised in each of
the  past two months, reported only $1.6 million in the bank at the end of
August and  a debt of nearly $4 million.
Democrats reported $22.1 million in the bank and a debt of slightly more than
$3 million.
Candidate recruitment has been uneven, particularly in the Senate, where
Republicans must defend 22 of the 34 seats on the ballot next year. Democrats
boast top-tier challengers for GOP-held seats in Colorado, Virginia, New
Hampshire, Maine, Minnesota and Oregon.
Republicans have yet to put forward a prominent challenger for any
Democratic-held seat, although an announcement is expected soon in  Louisiana.
Additionally, nine Republicans in the House and three in the Senate have
announced plans to retire. Some of those leaving are in midcareer, when a
departure often signals pessimism about the prospects for regaining the  majority.
Democratic retirements total two to date — both are House members who  are
running for the Senate.
&quot;The Democrats will continue to be the majority party in the House and Senate
and Hillary Clinton will make history by being the first woman president&quot; in
2008, predicts Rep. Ray LaHood, one of three Illinois Republicans to
announce  his retirement so far.
What makes LaHood's prediction stand out is his willingness to say it
publicly.
Numerous other Republican lawmakers, aides and strategists said Democrats
appear headed for two more years in power in Congress, but they declined to say
so on the record.
Despite their difficulties, Republicans are not deep in the minority. A
switch of 16 seats would give them control of the House next year; a change of
one or two seats could deliver the Senate.
Despite the GOP's worst defeat since the Watergate era of the 1970s,
Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma said recently, &quot;We have more seats than  Ronald
Reagan had on his best day.&quot;
He added that Republicans have a better chance of winning a House majority in
2008 than they do of capturing the Senate or the White House. Sen. John
Ensign  of Nevada, chairman of the GOP senatorial committee, offered no response.
But Cole's job performance as head of the House GOP political arm is under
internal challenge. In a recent private leadership meeting, Rep. John Boehner,
R-Ohio, sought the dismissal of the group's two top campaign aides, saying
the  committee lacked aggressiveness.
Cole refused and said he would quit first before firing the staff. Boehner,
the party leader, backed down, at least temporarily, but may yet seek to
install  a senior aide at the committee. The officials who discussed the events did
so on  condition of anonymity, saying they were not authorized to discuss
private  conversations.
After a long turn in power in Congress, LaHood and other Republicans say the
change in fortunes is partly the result of historical cycles. &quot;The American
people like a change,&quot; he said.
At the same time, President Bush's approval is stuck in the mid-30s and the
Iraq war remains unpopular with the public.
Nor have the ethics woes that plagued the party in last year's elections
abated. Corruption investigations swirl around Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens and
California Rep. John Doolittle. To the particular distress of party leaders,  Idaho
Sen. Larry Craig pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct last summer in an
airport men's room sex sting operation and has yet to make good on an earlier
pledge to resign.
Stevens and Doolittle deny all wrongdoing, as does Craig, who has asked a
Minnesota judge to permit him to withdraw his guilty plea.
Polls, too, chart the decline of the Republicans.
A recent Gallup poll reported that 59 percent of those surveyed have an
unfavorable impression of the Republican Party. By a margin of 47-42 percent,
they said Democrats will do a better job of protecting against terrorism and
military threats. Asked which party would better maintain prosperity, the
majority preferred the Democrats, 54-34.
Despite their woes, numerous Republicans say they may have weathered the
worst of it.
The race for the 2008 presidential nomination may sort itself out as early as
February, they say, giving the party a new face months before the elections.

&quot;Whoever it is, it won't be George W. Bush,&quot; said Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind. &quot;I
deeply admire the president, but many Americans have a somewhat unmovable
impression of the president at this point,&quot; he added.
Others predict Clinton will win her party's nomination for the White House
and say her polarizing effect on the voters will benefit GOP candidates in
swing  areas currently held by Democrats.
&quot;A Clinton candidacy would help energize Republicans to go out and vote in
down-ballot races,&quot; said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster working in House
and  Senate campaigns. &quot;It will help the Republican case for divided
government.&quot;
Pence also said the military situation in Iraq is improving, and that a
looming spending struggle between Bush and the Democrats should help reassure
conservative voters who have become disaffected.
But efforts to draw clear distinctions with the Democrats can cut both ways.
Senate Republicans from New Hampshire, Maine, Oregon and Minnesota, who face
particularly tough races in 2008, all voted in recent days for a children's
health care bill that Bush has pledged to veto.
&quot;I just do not understand his decision, and I think it would be terrible,&quot;
said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. She faces a challenge from Rep. Tom Allen,
D-Maine.

which begins, `The Democrats ...')
