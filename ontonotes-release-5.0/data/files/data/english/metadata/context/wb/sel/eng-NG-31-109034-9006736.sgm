Ba'athist Triumvirs: Everybody Go Home! [1]

That's the order that echoed through the streets at the fever-pitch
demonstrations at noon on September 10, 1951 in the streets of Cairo,
Alexandria, and throughout Egypt. The failure of a succession of
governments, brawls and encounters with British troops, and a
disastrous King's Government led General Mohammed Naguib to deliver
the following message to the King on the night of September 9:

&quot;In view of what the country has suffered in the recent past, the
complete vacuity prevailing in all corners as a result of your bad
behavior, your toying with the constitution, and your disdain for the
wants of the people, no one rests assured of life, livelihood, and
honor. Egypt's reputation among the peoples of the world has been
debased as a result of your excesses in these areas to the extent that
traitors and bribe-takers find protection beneath your shadow in
addition to security, excessive wealth, and many extravagances at the
expense of the hungry and impoverished people. You manifested this
during and after the Palestine War in the corrupt arms scandals and
your open interference in the courts to try to falsify the facts of
the case, thus shaking faith in justice. Therefore, the army,
representing the power of the people, has empowered me to demand that
Your Majesty abdicate the throne to His Highness Crown Prince Emir
Ahmed Fuad, provided that this is accomplished at the fixed time of 12
o'clock noon tomorrow, and that you depart the country before 6
o'clock in the evening of the same day. The army places upon Your
Majesty the burden of everything that may result from your failure to
abdicate according to the wishes of the people.&quot;

Perhaps underwhelmingly, the King readily abdicated in favor of his
son, Fuad II. [2] Farouq then slipped out of the Summer Palace in
Alexandria to Cyprus, and thence, Malta, and into a longstanding exile
in the Cotswolds.

The Officers' Council for Arab Rebirth, having gained a majority of
the Officers' Board, established control of major traffic circles and
squares in Cairo, while Ba'athist cadets captured the Citadel, and Air
Force officers hand over the airfields. For a coup, it is smooth as
silk, and nearly bloodless. For more detail, see Laila Abu Lughod's
landmark study: &quot;A Velvet Revolution: Ba'athism on the Nile.&quot;

Amid gunsmoke and fires, Col. Rustum, General Naguib, and others
debated the form of the new national government. While some argued for
the deposition Fuad II and creation a 'Restored Arab Republic of
Egypt' or a 'Free Socialist Republic of Egypt' in line with sleek,
modernist thinking, they did not succeed. Instead, the will and charm
of Col. Ahmed Rustum prevailed and the monarchy survived-perhaps
because King Fuad II has shown such great affection for the Arab hero,
though Rustum believed at the time that while the monarchy was corrupt
and 'a rotten instrument of the British King,' he also believed that
the people of Egypt were not yet 'dialectically prepared for a 'total'
or 'complete' revolution' which would bring them to a rebirth, and
thus a period of revolutionary transition is required, though no such
statement was made publicly at the time.

Contemporaneously, all political parties were encouraged to apply for
licenses, registering the names and residences of their leadership and
top members. While the Muslim Brotherhood, the Communist Party of
Egypt, Wafd, and the newly-minted Ba'athist Party registered at,
elections were then suspended for at least three years. During that
time, Mohammed Naguib to served as Prime Minister, Naguib as Deputy MP
and Interior Minister, and both served on a tripartite panel with
Naguib and Badawi to try 'autocrats, kleptocrats, and enemies of the
Arab people'-essentially the ancien regime, though Fuad II served as a
figurehead and a rubber stamp, he was able to intervene occasionally.
Fundamentally, that meant the liquidation and expulsion of only the
worst pro-British collaborators, save those who agree to stay and
serve to 'profitable in the service of the interests of the Egyptian
people and the Arab Nation.' Such that only a tiny amount of capital
flight went abroad.

Likewise, Rustum's Greco-Italian wife, who converted and took the name
Khadija, takes prominence as a sort of 'first lady' of Egypt as the
King is unmarried, and serves to reassure the Coptic, Greek, Armenian,
Italian, and Jewish communities. Though her husband's cold
technocratic fascism was yet to reveal itself in full, it was
certainly felt throughout the country.

The emergence of the Naguib government helped push Clement Atlee out
of office by October 1, while the Truman Administration drifted,
concentrating on Korea and Iran-a third world crisis only served to
frustrate and irritate Dean Acheson. Czechoslovakia and the PRC were
relatively warm to the Naguib government, and the USSR tentatively
extended congratulations on 'revolution' based on the rhetoric of the
new regime. In all cases, Rustum treaded lightly, attempting to tack
between the West and the Communist Bloc, knowing full well which side
the Egyptians are mad at, which side might supply economic/military
aid, and which side he needs to supply cash to build the Aswan High
Dam.

All of this was marked with pomp and parades hardly out of step with a
California Farmer's Harvest Festival, despite a prominence of goose-
stepping and jackboots-the resplendent military parades carry a strong
whiff of May Day in the USSR, as does the idea of the Ba'athist
International, which met in Cairo in April 1952.

In retrospect, it was a landmark moment, a veritable who's who of
early Ba'athism. At the time, the pomp and circumstance at the Citadel
far outranged the number of attendants, or their collective-the
prominence. As King Fuad II looked on from his apartments, Rustum and
Prime Minister Naguib addressed the assembled Ba'athists from under
the French clock, broken since its donation in the 1840's.

Socialist high command in Syria. [3] In addition, three military
officers attend the conference Col. Adnan al-Maliki and his fanboys,
Mustafa Tlass and Hafiz al-Assad. In other words, one martyr and two
future Presidents of the Ba'athist Republic of Syria.

descended by way of Spanish Falangism-attend alongside the Jumblatts,
representing the Progressive Socialist Alliance as well as the Druze,
whose mutual enmity declined and whose alliance is sometimes dated
from this era.

The contingents from Iraq, Yemen, and Jordan were less than notable at
this time. Iraq was in the waning days of its monarchy, while Yemen
was still a colony, and Jordan's Ba'athist Party was years away from
being established.

Nonetheless, everyone went home happy, save the Syrians, who faced
three more years of tumult before taking power.

For Rustum, the conference was a success. While the Syrians held the
lead as theoreticans of Ba'athism, he was able to have himself elected
Secretary General of the Ba'athist International, the popular heart,
if not the brain or soul, of Ba'athism. After that, his second
invitation to Anthony Eden regarding the Suez Canal was accepted, a
date set for November 1952....

Thoughts?

[1] Mad trivia points for anyone who gets this.

[2] OTL, Fuad was born last of Farouq's children, and was three years
old in 1952. In the ATL, Fuad was his firstborn. As a male teenager,
he shifts attitudes toward the monarchy, and with a serious fascist
fetish, he is easier to keep up, despite the tumbledown reputation of
the monarchy. Whether this will endure, well....

[3] Al-Hawrani briefly established an Arab Socialist Party in Syria in
1952; the Ba'athists joined it, and soon overtook it in OTL. Here,
they accept the invite.

If the unaligned movement really gets to Israel (it was that close in
OTL it's going to lead to all kind of really odd cold war politics.
Israel is odd in many ways. But one of them is that it seems to be one
of the few places where giant amounts of first world aid seemed to
work. Unless I'm wrong about the percentage of GDP reparations,
Israeli bond flows and U.S loan guarantees have made up over time. But
my point is that it's not just that Israel has even odder
relationships with her neighbors then everyone else in the region (one
day I'd love to find out how much Jordan and Israel have really
cooperated for instance), but that the dynamics of the whole region is
very different of the Arab world gets a little richer then it did and
Israel develops a little slower. One would assume deeper involvement
in the non-aligned movement might do that. Of course I might be off a
bit (i.e. involvement in these things has no substantive effect on
Israeli economic policy, a richer Arab world just buys bigger guns
etc.) and certainly I don't have insight into Middle Eastern Economic
development.

It's rather different than almost anywhere else that received First

traditions of corruption and other handicaps that tend to make that
sort of thing rather more difficult in Cairo or Zaire.

Quite; one of the disadvantages that Israel's neighbor's have is that
oil revenue gets sucked up by the war machine, creating a negative
feedback loop that prevents the state from developing in vital ways
while taking on additional costs by having either full (Egypt, Iraq)
or partial (Syria, Jordan) state-directed/controlled economies.
Compound that with creepy police state fun, and whamo, breeding
grounds for terrorists.

So, can we get an equally dictatorial Middle East that doesn't do the
same sort of thing? Or can we produce a mega-Ba'athist bloc that
merely...intensifies the worst aspects of Syria, Egypt, Iraq, and
Jordan?

Let's find out!

A revolution in one country, a revolution in many countries! Ba'athist
Youth Groups, colored shirts, marches and parades (Everybody loves a
parade!)....

The nukes may be flashy but there are more to the Franco-Israeli
alliance than nukes. Most of the advanced gear of the Israely army up to
the 6 days war and a big share after the 6 days war was French made. And
the US and Britain were not exactly forthcoming with things like first
line fighter aircraft for Israel at the time. If Israel alianates France
sometime in the mid 50s it's air force for starters will be in a world
of hurt by 1967.

It may not have a 1967 per so but probably will have something similar
given the Arab opinion of Israel. At some point that Baath leaders will
have to deliver and there were constant irritants before 1967 to make
things worse. And whatever the quality issues of the Arab armies if
Israel could not count on air superiority its prospects in a war would
get highly problematic.

The Israeli AF in June 1967 had all of half a dozen fighters that were
not French made and these were British Meteors obsolate already by 1950.
The rest of the air force was exclusively armed with French made
Ouragans, Mystere IVs, Super Mysteres, Vatours and Mirage IIIs. The US
was quite leery up to 1967 to sell modern fighter aircraft to Israel.
Britain ditto and come to that didn't really have a plane to match
Mirage III.

Under such circumstances why exactly would Israel want to alienate its
closest ally at the time? What does it gain from doing so?

Oddly enough, the though of Ba'athist pressure on neighboring states
(i.e. Ba'athism expanding to Jordan and maybe Yemen in TTL.) made me
think about the idea of a Ba'athist party in *Israel*. Is there any
way that we can tweek the Ba'athist beliefs far enough to end up with
a Pan-Semite party in Israel as part of Ba'athism?

(I'm not sure it would be that much farther from traditional Ba'athism
than say Albanian communism is from Soviet)

Probably not. Ba'athism is left-flavored Fascism that is Arab
Supranationalist. OTOH, if there's a war like OTL's 1967, somewhere
down the road the Knesset might find itself seating the Ba'athist
Party of Palestine to counterweigh the Muslim Brotherhood and others--
it might become relatively popular among the Christian Arabs of
Israel, etc.

I wonder if such a party would be allowed in the Knesset. Apparently
amendment no. 9 to the Basic Law was not passed until 1985. One would
assume the emergence of such a party would spark a similar amendment.
Wikipedia alleged a group called al-Ard sought to run a &quot;United Arab
list&quot; but this was prevented (in 1965).

I'm not sure who Israeli-Arabs actually vote for; I tend to assume
they lean left, and used to lean more left in the 1950s.

For what it's worth Wikipedia has a list of all Arab members of the
Knesset and their affiliations. Fortunately the information is
verifiable from the Knesset website. It also has highly amusing
summaries of Israeli political gamesmanship (see for example:
http://www.knesset.gov.il/history/eng/eng_hist16_s.htm ).

Here's &quot;Amendment 9&quot; (from http://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/basic2_eng.htm):

Basic Law: The Knesset (Amendment No. 9)*

1. In the Basic Law: The Knesset**, the following section shall be
inserted after section 7:

&quot;Prevention of participation of candidates' list

7A. A candidates' list shall not participate in elections to the
Knesset if its objects or actions, expressly or by implication,
include one of the following:

(1) negation of the existence of the State of Israel as the state of
the Jewish people;

(2) negation of the democratic character of the State;

(3) incitement to racism.&quot;

* Passed by the Knesset on the 13th Av, 5745 (31st July, 1985) and
published in Sefer Ha-Chukkim No. 1155 of the 20th Av, 5745 (7th
August, 1985), p. 196; the Bill and an Explanatory Note were published
in Hatza'ot Chok No. 1728 of 5745, p. 193.
** Sefer Ha-Chukkim of 5718, p. 69 - LSI vol. XII p. 85; Sefer Ha-
Chukkim of 5741, p. 168-LSI vol. XXXV, p. 192.

ObOTL: Are there many lists that can meet the requirements of clause 1
and clause 3 simultaneously?  Or are the words in the clauses read very
broadly?

ObAH: It's hard to change the basic law ('Constitution') of Australia.
It needs the support of a majority of Australian voters and a majority
of voters in a majority of states.  But 1967 was a notable year for
referenda getting up in the Brown and Pleasant Land.  Let us say that
something not unlike Section 7A of the Basic Law gets levered into the
Constitution.

What are the consequences?  Clearly, clause 3 means all political
parties are going to have to drop the White Australia Policy like a hot
potato.

Just as importantly, all the minor revolutionary parties are going to
have to change the objects clause of their constitutions or be banned
under clause 2.  Is the Democratic Revolutionary People's Party going to
drop the second word of their name?  I think not!  Free from the
constraints of contesting bourgeois elections they are free to
concentrate on achieving power by other means.  Come the 1969 election
there are fewer minor parties to distract the less ept component of the
electorate into an informal vote.  In a tight election this means the
ALP wins.

The impact on the Australian film industry is that it is Gough Whitlam
and not John Gorton who is pouring out the taxpayer's largesse on Bruce
Beresford and Phillip Adams during the period 1969-71.  David Williams
never writes the play _Don's Party_ also aborting the film based on this
entertainment.  Even if we haven't rippled away the Australian Democrats
party they've lost one of their OTL nicknames.

To put it simply &quot;it depends. &quot;It depends on how the Israeli Supreme
Court has read it (IMO the Israeli SCC has done a good job with these
things, and there are many. YMMV). I also depends on how you view the
Israeli political parties, since every other party will essentially
imply their opponents violate all 3 (if you think American attack ads
are nasty, Israeli attack ads are far nastier).

I think the change, (ironically enough) was to ban the Kahanists. More
ironically parties on the right that are allowed to sit  (i.e. they
are cleaned up heirs of Kahane) and which probably violate (2) and (3)
(I'm thinking largely of the secular nationalists to the right of
Likud) like to crow that the various Arab parties violate (1) and
should be banned. The Arab parties have probably complained about
their opponents on the right. But all of them are in the Knesset.

ITTL things are rather different. AFAIK Israeli Arab politics were,
from what it looks, all about patronage and &quot;cooperation&quot; (patronage)
in the 50s and 60s, coupled by the fact that some rather egregious
violations on Arab citizens civil rights ensured things did not get
out of hand (all could vote, but their civil liberties were quite
restricted; curfews, police surveillance, movement restrictions etc.).
All the restrictions were lifted in 1966, however (why then, I'm not
sure; I do know there was a gradual shift away from restrictions over
time, starting in cities, and then ending in the 60s with lifting of
restrictions in majority Arab areas), but the emergence of wholly Arab
focused parties did not really emerge until the mid 1970s and later
and today radical (and perfectly moderate) Arab politics are an
important factor. I suppose the mobilization lag is because while
living in Israel created Arab communities that discarded older
patronage centric approaches to politics, old habits die hard. I
should note something similar happened with Jews of North African and
Middle Eastern descent too--they began as tied to Labour and then over
time left. Still I have never seen numbers on the effect of the Arab
vote. It's unlikely to be decisive in the 1950s and 60s (I think the
proportion of the population that is Arab-Israeli has increased over
time) due to the factors I've noted. That being said, I understand
Arab voters &quot;staying home&quot; was seen as what cost Shimon Peres his
chance for PM after Rabin's assassination. Certainly when I was in
Israel in 2000 there were lots of Labour Party posters in Acre, for
instance, which has a large Arab community. Where the Arab vote sits
now is complex (given the wackiness of Israeli politics, or if you
prefer, the emergence of a centerist coalition), but again in the ATL
in the 1950s I have no doubt the Arab community leadership was
accomodationist, and those in Israel seem unlikely to stray just yet.
It probably helped that the less cooperative leadership were those who
actively resisted the emergence of the State and as such were highly
likely to have vacated or were vacated (note that I have no wish to
spark an ugly discussion on population shifts, forcible or otherwise
in 1948-49). Those most likely to incline towards revolution would be
in Jordan, in Syria, in Lebanon, or in Gaza.

If my view is broadly correct the accomodationists are unlikely to be
swept away by &quot;successful&quot; Baath in Israel, at least not yet, though
it may lead to some marginally increased radicalization.

I do think, however, the Israeli courts would be more pliant in the
1950s and 1960s. Israel, AFAIK, has always had a fairly vigorous
judiciary, but I doubt they would be nearly as bold as the Israeli
courts have been in the last decade or so. In particular the
increasing shift by the court to &quot;constitutionalize&quot; the Basic Law.

The likelihood of such legislation eliminating smaller parties that
some might say &quot;Aren't Democratic&quot; seems odd; Israel has always had a
vigorous Communist party (even now it has a couple seats), and it was
far more vigorous in the period of TTL (I think Mapam didn't break
with Stalin until after 1953).

I can't imagine Australia (where I understand there's no entrenched
rights guarantees) would interpret such a clause so broadly.

I mean it hasn't outlawed parties who aim to:

Make Israel no longer a Jewish state
or
Kick out Israeli Arabs

Admittedly that took a split Israeli SCC decision.

It's constitutionality elsewhere, however, would be rather
interesting. It might, for example, be upheld in Canada, as part of
some kind of extension of hate speech legislation, since that has
survived challenge in the courts.
