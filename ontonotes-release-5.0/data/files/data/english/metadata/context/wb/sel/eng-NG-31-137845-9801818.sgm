Candles Shapes and Figures

Adam and Eve  Candles: These are human figure candles that come in a
variety of  colors. They can be used for anything from love (Pink) to
gaining a  new job (Green). Just use your imagination and the
information in  this site.

Altar Candles: The Altar Candles are used to represent  the Deities or
Powers with which you wish to communicate. This is a  method of
honoring them and their presence while tapping into their  energy.

Two Altar Candles are placed on the altar, one to the  left side
and one to the right. The candles must always be taller and  longer
burning than any others on the altar. They must be lit first  and
extinguished last. Which of the Altar Candles is lit first  depends on
the type of Magick you are performing.

Color not  withstanding, the right candle represents male energy
while the left  represents female energy. Colors will vary from system
to system and  from Deity to Deity.

Astral Candles: These are &quot;Personal Candles&quot;  of colors and shapes you
feel right for you or another person. They  are not to be confused
with Zodiac Candles (listed later) that are  affixed to you by birth sign.

Astrological Candles: See Zodiac  Candles.

Cat Candle: the Cat Candles are used for luck,  jinx-breaking, and
hexing, depending on the oils and energies placed  into the candle.
They are usually are found in three basic  colors:

* Black: used to banish bad luck and bring good luck.  Gamblers
should alter burning times between seven and eleven minutes  per night.
* Red: generally used for gaining the love of another by  feminine
(feline) guile.
* Green: can be used to obtain money of a  transient nature or to
heal a sick pet.

Compass Candle: A  Compass or Directional Candle is employed to help
you determine a  specific direction to take in life. It is usually a
taper that drips  freely when lit.

After assigning each of the four quarters a  direction that you
believe you would like your life to proceed in,  observe the candle
closely. The wax will drip in the direction that  is best for you to
take, not necessarily the one you might want, but  you will be told
what is best based on your present  abilities.

Cross or Crucifix Candle: Sometimes referred to as the  &quot;Flora&quot; or
&quot;Floral Cross&quot; Candle, this comes in a variety of colors.  It is
generally burnt for protection and banishing. It can be used  to
represent angels which are called in to protect the home. One  angel
for each day of the week in the appropriate  color.

Dehexing Candle: The best colors of Dehexing Candles are  Gray, Silver,
Black and bi-colored Reversible Candles.

*  Black: Absorbs anything coming to you.
* Gray: neutralizes anything  coming to you.
* Silver: reflects the incoming energy back to the  sender. The
curse, jinx or crossing that was meant for you now rests  on the
sender. With the gray color, your energy must remain  neutral.
* Reversible Color: is usually found in a combination of Red  and
Black, with the Black absorbing the incoming energy and the  Red
concentrating it, adding any tidbits of your making, and  returning it
to the sender with interest.

Devil Candle: This  ominous candle is used to banish a jinxed or
crossed condition in the  home or place of employment, or about one's
person. It is commonly  used to exorcise someone of undesirable habits,
energies, and  entities. Mainly used in conjunction with the Psalms. It
can be used  to create a jinx, hex, or crossed condition.

Devotional Candle:  Devotional Candles, a from of Novena Candle, are
usually those found  in picturesque, heat resistant glass containers.
The pictures on the  glass are usually of various Saints or Loas while
a prayer is  normally inscribed on the reverse.

Double/Triple Action Candle:  Double Action Candles have two colors.
They are usually referred to  as dual action or dual purpose candles.
Exemplified by the Red and  Black Reversible candle mentioned above.

Triple Action Candles  have one more color than the double action
ones, hence one more  action in combination. As an example, a typical
triple action  combination would be Red (passion), White (protection)t
and  Green (money).

Floating Wick Candle: This candle merely exchanges  the wax body for
one of fragrant oils. A floating wick is suspended  in the oil that
lies within a decorative holder. These not only are  beautiful at
social gatherings, but you can remove remove stale  cooking or smoke
odors as well. You can energize the oil body as you  would a wax body,
but you must do so through the glass as the oil has  no solid structure.

Glass Oil Candle: Though similar to the  Floating Wick Candle by virtue
of using oil instead of wax in a  (glass) container, the Glass Oil
Candle's wick does not float. It is  suspended into the oil body from a
separate metal or glass fixture.  The Glass Oil Candle comes in a
variety of shapes, sizes, and colors,  and is extremely useful in
Magick as a Perpetual Flame or Altar  Candle. The fragrant oils can be
exchanged to match the Magick you  are performing. The thick glass is
usually safe and heat  resistant.

The container usually has a small opening where new  oil can be
added without extinguishing the flame. As many of the  containers are
transparent, it is easy to see when the oil needs  replacing.

As an Altar Candle for a magickal act, use the glass  tapers. A
neutral yet high vibrational oil in a thick crystal taper  burns long
after your Magick is complete.

When using the Glass  Oil Candle in a magickal act, always imbue
the container first with  your will. Do not anoint the container
however. Instead, with your  will, imbue the oil meant to go into the
container. In this way, the  container has stored energy and power
along with the oil.

Hand  of Glory Candle: The Hand of Glory Candle and spell dates well
into  the early Middle Ages. According to Anna Riva in Candle  Burning
Magick, the spell was attributed to Albertus Magnus. Whether  Magnus
was the originator of this work or was simply passing on even  older
folk lore is not known.

The real danger of not  understanding the &quot;whys&quot; or &quot;hows&quot; of
Magick is well depicted with  this legend. It also illustrates the real
need for you to master the  basics and then build upon them for your
own understanding of  Magick.

There are several legends on how to obtain and use the  Hand of
Glory. Generally, the hand of a hanged thief or some  successful
criminal (at least until he was hanged) was taken, then  processed and
dipped into hot wax. The hand was then set afire so  that the light
from it would render its carrier invisible, along with  paralyzing
anyone seeing it.

Before you start digging around  in your local graveyard, let's
examine the thoughts behind this  magickal legend.

First, the taking of the hand of an executed  man, once a thief,
now a spirit and invisible to mortal eyes, was  believed to bestow his
invisibility trait to the  possessor.

Second, the legend is so incomplete that the exact  &quot;facts&quot; cannot
be ascertained. You can do much better with Creative  Visualization or
Candle Magick and leave the hands with the  owners.

With Creative Visualization, you can cloak yourself in a  cloud of
mist using the energy from the solar plexus. This raises the  bodily
vibrations tot he point of invisibility. I use this method on  our car
when a traffic cop is getting ready to pounce. Remember  though to lift
the veil before driving off or you may find yourself  in frequent auto
accidents!

With Candle Magick, you can  control the mind of those you wish to
be invisible to by using image  candles. By willing others not to see
you, you can come and go as you  please.

Combining the two methods for a more theatrical approach,  obtain
some graveyard dust. Create a white, wax image candle of  yourself,
including the dust within the wax. Conjure your Magick  around your
will and your desire to become invisible to others. As  you burn the
candle, envision yourself surrounded by a white cottony  substance.
This takes a lot of concentration, since anytime you lose  your
concentration, you drop the veil and again will be  visible.

The Guardian Flame Candle: There are many magicians who  will only
light a ritual candle with the &quot;Sacred Flame&quot; that has been  dedicated
to a Deity. This flame stands as a guardian in the home or  temple. The
glass Oil Candle is excellent for his  purpose.

Household Candle: An all-purpose candle used for  Magick.

Invocation Candle: An Altar Candle used to invoke a  specific Deity.
The Seven-Day Novena Candle is frequently used as an  Invocation Candle
as it is tall and will normally outlast other  candles on the altar.

Jumbo Candle: A larger, thicker version of  the Household Candle.

Knob Candle: this candle has seven small  knobs, one atop another, and
stand approximately seven inches high.  One knob can be burnt each day
while concentrating on what you desire  to manifest into your life. A
separate oil is used for each knob or  an all purpose oil can be used
on all seven knobs, the choice is  yours.

The Black Seven Knob Candle provides an excellent way to  banish
undesirable energies from your home and the surrounding area.  Burn one
knob each day, starting on the Full Moon and working until  the New
Moon for best results. Use a Green Seven Knob Candle or a  White Seven
Knob Candle to build a protective wall around your home  and those you
love.

Mummy Candle: Traditionally, this candle  is used to acquire success
and power. We prefer to use to ward off  illness, dangerous situations,
or the specter of  death.

Novelty Candle: Any candle that is not housed in glass and  has a shape
other than cylindrical. Some examples of the Novelty  Candle are the
Cat Candle, the Skull Candle, the Seven Knob Candle,  and the Adam and
Eve Candles.

Novena Candle: generally, this  is a seven- to twelve-day,
glass-enclosed candle. Frequently it is  inscribed with pictures of
various Saints along with prayers or  chants on the reverse.

Seven-Day Novena: This long-burning candle  is housed within a
thick, heat resistant glass, and comes in three  varieties: Plain
Novena, the Spiritual Novena, and the Specialty  Novena. Each comes
unscented and in a variety of colored wax and  glass casings.

* Plain Novena: This is an unmarked Seven-Day  Candle found in a
variety of colors.
* Spiritual Novena: This  candle comes with various depictions of
Saints or Holy Personages on  the glass container along with specific
prayers or petitions to that  Saint. The scene in which the Saint is
depicted is usually a clue as  to the Saint's power and use.
* Specialty Novena: This candle is made  of specific colors and
sports specific designs on the glass  container. It is named for the
various actions it is to perform, and  is often confused with the
Novelty Candle. Remember, Novelty Candles  do not come in glass
containers and are not cylindrically shaped.  Their names include Lucky
13, Controlling, Double Action, Reversible  and many others.

Offertory Candle: This is the name for the main  candle that offers
your desires, goals, or wishes out to the Universe  for manifestation.
It is also known as a Purpose  Candle.

Phallus Candle: A candle in the shape of the male organ,  it can be
used for anything dealing with male sexuality, sterility,  or impotence.

Protection Candle: A candle of any shape and size.  The color here is
what counts. Burn a White candle or a Saint Candle  whenever doing
destructive Magick (banishing disease, for example) to  protect
yourself from harm. Also use Silver if you are doing  destructive
Magick against another person who also knows  Magick.

Should your Magick return unexpectedly, neutralize it  with a Gray
Candle.

Some Novena Candles are considered  Protection Candles. San
Capistrano to keep away enemies; Saint  Anthony for a job; Saint Jude
for court problems; Sacred Heart fro  Marriage; Santa Clara for drug
and addiction problems; Saint Michael  for general protection. Whenever
using the Saints, always write down  your desire nine times on
parchment and tape it to the candle  bottom.

Using the Saints is not hard as the prayers are usually  inscribe
right into the candle containers.

Rebirthing Candle:  A candle, with three or more days of burning time,
that is used to  guide the dead across to peace and rest.

Skull Candle: This  candle, shaped in the form of a human skull, comes
in several colors,  the most common of which are Black, White, Red,  and
Green.

Traditionally, the Green Skull Candle is used to  make someone who
is gullible easier to separate fro his or her money.  It can be used to
heal mental or physical disorder of the mind, brain  or cranium. We
have used the Green Skull Candle to aid in memory  retention fro College.

A Friend of ours had a brain tumor and  asked for help. As the
Black Skull is normally used to cause great  harm, suffering and pain,
we focused that destructive power and  directed it toward the tumor. It
stopped enlarging and then could be  removed safely by surgery. We then
used the Green Skull on a waxing  Moon to promote health and healing.

The Red Skull could be used  to force someone physically to move
away or to make him or her fall  out of love with another person. Of
course, the reverse could also be  attempted depending on the Moon Cycle.

The White Skull Candle is  the best one to use to bend someone to
your will, contrary to our  chart, as the Yellow Skull is very hard to
find. This is a very good  reason to learn to make your own candles.

Skull Candles of the  appropriate colors can be of great aid to
activists who must deal  with bureaucracies. The large entities can be
equated to headless  monsters that feed off the life energies of their
employees. By using  the Skull Candle to represent the thought form of
the bureaucracy,  you can tap this thought form's energy and thus
control much of what  happens to it. By making the thought form feed
upon itself, you can  destroy it or allow it to restructure.

Snake or Bust Away Candle:  This candle is used to break free or &quot;bust
away&quot; from evil. It is  used to break free of undesirable conditions,
situations or  habits.

Specialty Candle: The same as the Specialty Novena Candle  mentioned
previously. As the use of Novena and Specialty Candles  varies a bit
from my own method of candle Magick, the colors, oils,  and traditional
meanings will vary slightly from what has been told  to you here in
this site. As Anna Riva has a wonderful book entitled  Devotions to the
Saints, further reference is not required  here.

Vigil Candle: Any candle will suffice when burnt not only  for a long
period of time for another's benefit but also to  peacefully
demonstrate for a cause or action.

Witch Candle:  Traditionally used as an extremely potent love candle,
the idea of  being to &quot;bewitch&quot; your intended.

Yoni Candle: The female  counterpart of the Phallus Candle. Shaped like
a Vulva, this candle  is used in sex Magick, safe birthing, and most
anything dealing with  women and their sexuality.

Zodiac or Astrological Candle: This  candle is used to represent each
of the twelve signs of the Zodiac.  It is specifically colored,
scented, and adorned with the information  pertinent to the individual
sign. Its use, normally in conjunction  with other candles, is to
represent your goal or target. The Zodiac  Candle would be placed on
the altar and then moved closer to the  target candle to simulate the
merging of the  two.
