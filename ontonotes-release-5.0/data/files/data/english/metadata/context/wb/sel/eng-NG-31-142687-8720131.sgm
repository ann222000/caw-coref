...for the U.S. economy to implode. It ain't going to happen anytime soon.

At least in the opinion of Canadian financial and investment expert Brian
Acker.
Mr. Acker of Acker-Finlay Corp stated on Canada's BNN TV channel last
Thursday that the U.S. is &quot;cheap&quot;,
meaning that its financial assets, stocks, bonds, financial paper, real
estate etc. is
a bargain. And the stock market has nowhere to go but up.

Dismissing the U.S. national debt, he mentioned that it is mainly owed
internally. That
foreign obligations amount to about 35% of GDP which is historically low.
And many other
industrial nations can only envy the U.S. position.

What's that you commies ask about the federal deficit? Well, it is only
about $169 billion,
which compared  with a $16 trillion dollar GDP is practically just a
rounding error.
It is chump change.  And this U.S. deficit is declining rapidly.

So the Democrats and their leftist media can criticize the Bush economy all
they want.
But this criticism is simply bullshit.

We Bush lovers are the only true capitalists and patriots.   That's why
we'd like to get him in public washroom and perform oral sex on him.

When do you think that Bush will drive up the debt so he can hand out more
tax cuts for the elite, idle rich?

Larry Kudlow, Rush and Bill Kristol issued a joint statement today saying
that anyone who doesn't drool at the prospect of giving Bush a blow job is
an Anarchist, a Marxist, a Liberal and an Autarchist.

They're calling for them to be abducted and shipped off to one of our
government torture prisons.

Long Live Führer Bush!   Death to the communists who oppose him!

The comptroller general of the US says things look grave. In fact, he
says we should learn from the fall of Rome (in his most recent
interviews).  His suggestions are sobering.

If you can't find the original article I have a copy of it on my site.

US Comptroller General: Learn from Fall of Rome
Financial Times
By Jeremy Grant in Washington
Published: August 14 2007 00:06 | Last updated: August 14 2007 00:06

David Walker, comptroller general of the US, issued the unusually
downbeat assessment of his country's future in a report that lays out
what he called &quot;chilling long-term simulations&quot;.

These include &quot;dramatic&quot; tax rises, slashed government services and the
large-scale dumping by foreign governments of holdings of US debt.

&lt;snip&gt;

The fiscal imbalance meant the US was &quot;on a path toward an explosion of
debt&quot;.

A new study asserts that roughly 600,000 Iraqis have died from violence
since the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003, a figure many times higher than
any previous estimate.

&lt;Only&gt;.  LOL!  And then after you remove such little budget items as,
I don't know, THE WAR.  Then again, considering that Bush had it up to
a half-trillion at one time, I guess you could see that as an
improvement.  After all, he's only inflated the debt by about 50%
during his reign so far.

Because of the budget mess, the US infrastructure is crumbling like an
Oreo in sulfuric acid.  Half the military units stateside aren't
combat-ready, law enforcement and education are seeing huge cutbacks,

The idiot didn't even get his numbers right.  It's 13 trillion.  ANd
the combined debt (consumer, state, federal, corporate) is around 20
trillion at last count.  Think about it, retard.  Everyone in the
United States could donate every cent of what they made in a year (in
the form of income and products) and they still wouldn't be able to
get out of debt.  Healthy?  Yeah, right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

121 billion chump change.  Yeah, right. It's better than 10% of their
entire government's operating budget, moron.  And debt servicing
charges (which I don't think are counted..can you say fudgit budget),
are up to around 20-25% of their total budget.  That's money being
flushed down the toilet, Lambourne.

It's only declining because Bush put it through the roof.  And because

The situation reminds me of the old Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis comedy
team. Jerry was the comic and the big star and Dean was the straight
man. That's what's going on now with spending. The Republicans are
running up huge deficits in their effort to &quot;starve the beast&quot; and
they're telling us there really is such a thing as a free lunch and
the Democrats are supposed to play the straight man and either cut
spending or raise taxes to balance the budget.

That's a losing game for the Democrats. The best strategy for the
Democrats is to run up the deficit some more. Increasing veterans
benefits is a good place to start. Giving the middle class a huge tax
cut would be another great idea. When Dean Martin quit playing the
straight man, no one hardly ever heard of Jerry Lewis again. There's a
lesson in that.

Is that the same Brian Acker who, on www.bnn.ca , told viewers to avoid
buying US securities because the dollar keeps going down relative to the
Canadian loonie?

Let's do an analysis to see if the US stock market is a good buy for
Canadians:

On 1/20/2001  1 USD = 1.49 CAD

Today               1 USD = 1.0638 CAD   Therefore, the USD devalued 28.6%
relative to CAD

On 1/20/2001  S&amp;P 500 = 1342.54
Today              S&amp;P 500 = 1473.99   gain = 9.79%

Therefore any Canadian that invested into the US stock market the day Pres.
Bush was inaugurated made $97.90 on a $1000 investment in an S&amp;P fund, but
lost $286 because the US dollar was devalued.  In other words, a Canadian
would be about $190 in the red by investing in US stocks during the last 6.5
years.

If you want to make money in investing, buy foreign companies because we
have no idea how much these morons in DC will further devalue the greenback.

One more thing... anyone that compares the national debt with GDP is an
idiot.  That was the argument Reagan used, only to lead us to the worst
recession since the 1930s.  The two figures have nothing to do with each
other.  It's like saying our national debt is small because the government
is allowed rob everyone and every business to pay it back.  Total bullcrap
argument and anyone who repeats this crap is a moron educated in a red
state.

The national debt is on its way to getting tripled by the Bush
Administration and has resulted in a massive devaluation of the US dollar.
If you don't believe me, look at the price you're paying for gasoline.

You can learn a lot about the economy from farmer's markets so why not
watch both?

For example, fresh corn is about 5x higher than it was last year. To me
that says farmers are dealing with massive inflation probably from
higher fuel costs.  There are no middle men hiding that inflation, no
government statisticians, no big corporations raising prices in one area
to make up for losses in other areas, etc.

It's a pure market.  The corn is more expensive but nothing tastes better.
