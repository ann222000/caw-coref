Sit-And-Go Challenge - Part I
Brett Chen

August 20th, 2005
As my first two articles dictate, I mostly play no-limit cash games.
However, this week I am going to deviate from my normal topic and
write an article or two about Sit-n-Goes (SNGs) because I am
currently in the middle of a SNG challenge. For those of you who are
unfamiliar with what they are, SNGs are simply a ten person
tournament with the top three spots getting paid. Generally, first
is 50% of the prize pool, second is 30%, and third is 20%. If the
tournament is a nine-handed tournament like it is on FullTilt, first
is 45%, second is 35%, and third is 15%. There are many ways to
approach a SNG and in this article, I will discuss some early game
strategy (I will save late game strategy for next week) as well as
my progress in my SNG challenge.

First, I would like to describe what exactly is my &quot;SNG challenge.&quot;
What I am doing is simply playing 1,000 SNGs at a certain buy-in and
recording my stats. To begin, I have chosen to play at the $50+5 SNG
level. Because I am not exactly a SNG specialist, I want to see how
I do at this level before moving up to maybe the $200+15 SNG level.
Now you may be asking, what stats do you record? I record my total
winnings, winnings per SNG, hourly wage, return-of-investment (ROI),
in-the-money (ITM), total invested, total returned, and time
invested. This may seem like a lot at first, but they're all crucial
to determining how you're doing in the challenge. To speed up the
process, I play four tables at a time which helps in early game
strategy.

There are many ways to approach early game strategy in SNGs: tight-
aggressive (TAG), loose-aggressive (LAG), or sitting out. Yes,
believe it or not, some players just sit out the first two levels of
a SNG (sort of like Hellmuth in tournaments) because they believe
the play is so bad that they're rather let the fish kill each other.
I do not advocate this third strategy because there's simply too
many dead chips out there to let them go to waste. You can double up
quite often in the early stages with big hands or tricky hands. What
I mean by tricky hands are hands like 8 7 suited or pocket threes.
Many times, in the beginning of a tournament, opponents will have
the tendency to overplay their hands due to the high blind to stack
ratio. In other words, players have to risk a small % of their stack
with their hands. This causes many TAG to overplay their A K or AA
because they believe they must bet strong to get people out. While
this is true, it is really a double edged sword.

First, I will discuss how to play big hands against opponents. When
holding a hand like J J or A K in early game, I would recommend
raising four-to-five times the blind and playing a post-flop game.
Do NOT try a min-raise strategy. This helps you get value out of
your hands while also preventing yourself from losing too many chips
incase the flop comes bad. Think back to my first article about
playing carefully. The same strategy applies in early game SNGs
because of the blind to stack ratio. I have also seen many players
raise ten or fifteen times the BB with a hand like A A. I think this
is a big mistake as well because you are only going to win the
blinds most of the time unless some donkey decides to gamble with 8
7s. I really believe raising four or five times with aces is good
enough. You get action, but you limit hands entering the pot as
well. The point is you cannot be afraid to take a flop with the best
starting hand in Hold 'Em as many players seem to be.

Now how do you play against opponents who have big hands? Early on
in SNGs, I like to get in with hands cheaply if possible. Hands like
J Ts, 9 8s, 8 7s, and any pocket pair I will try to go in with. If
my opponent picks up a big hand and puts in a big raise, I simply
fold and lose 15-30 chips depending on the blinds. However, many
times opponents will make a mistake by raising too little with their
big hands (the min-raise strategy) or raise out of position. This
allows me to go in cheaply or outplay them post-flop. There have
been countless times where an opponent mini-raises with aces on the
button and I get in cheaply with 8 7s and the flop has come 8 7 x or
T 9 6. I lead into them on the flop, they make a strong raise, I
push and I double up; or if they're smart they fold but still lose
half their stack. It is also important to realize your opponent will
not have A A K K QQ J J or TT every time they raise. Many times they
will be holding anything from A K to A Ts. This means if the flop
comes lowball or medium, you can win the pot with a pot-sized bet.

To sum things up, it's important to play your big hands carefully
but at the same time, be unafraid to let players in. Do not try and
bluff your stack off with A K just because you raised pre-flop.
Also, try to look for good spots to double up off donkeys. Get in
cheaply if you can with hands that are able to flop strong and try
to get your chips in there. Many times, you will be able to double
up within the first two levels.

When people ask &quot;Should I play TAG or LAG?&quot;, I would recommend TAG
early on with a mix of tricky hands if possible. Look for good spots
to double up but also protect your stack by not playing too many
hands. Hands like Q Jo or K To can be folded without much thought.
There's no need to go in with those hands because it is too easy to
get into trouble against a bigger hand like A Q or A K. Next week, I
will discuss how my SNG strategy changes once the blinds hit 25-50.
In late SNG, my strategy changes from TAG to LAG. There is a reason
why I recommend LAG play later on in SNGs which I will also discuss.

For now, I will leave you all with my current stats in my SNG
challenge. I will have updates from time to time in the upcoming
weeks. I have a couple of things to say before I type my stats out.
Currently, I am in the middle of a big downswing so my stats are
deflated. I have experienced a great deal of bubble busting in my
last 50 SNGs which has frustrated me a bit. I have decided to take
this week off from my SNG challenge to try and clear my mind.
Hopefully things will turn around. Now here are my stats:

Total Winnings: $2,260
Winnings/SNG: $9.50
Hourly Wage: $56.97
ROI: 17.27%
ITM: 35.71%

Total Invested: $13,090
Total Returned: $15,350

Time Invested: 39.67

Total: 238
1st 37
2nd 26
3rd 22
4th 29
5th 26
6th 27
7th 22
8th 16
9th 25
10th 8

I am relatively happy that I have more firsts than any other place,
however, I am very unsatisfied with my ROI %. After my first 180
SNGs, my ROI was at a ridiculous 33%. Of course, I never expected to
maintain this phenomenol percentage, but in my personal opinion, 17%
is just too low. At the beginning of my SNG challenge, I set a goal
for myself to maintain a 20-22% ROI which I did until my last 50
SNGs. However, I am confident that after my short break, things will
turn around.
