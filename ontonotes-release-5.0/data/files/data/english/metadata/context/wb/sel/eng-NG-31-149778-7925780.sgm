BibleGod  vs Krishna

Put Jehovah and Krishna parallel with each other. The former, &quot;from
the clouds and darkness of Sinai,&quot; said to the Jews:

&quot;Thou shalt have no other gods before me. . . . Thou shalt not bow
down thyself to them nor serve them; for I, the Lord thy God, am a
jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children
unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.&quot;

Contrast this with the words of Krishna [Bhagwad Gita Ch 9] &quot;I am the
same to all mankind. They who honestly serve other gods, involuntarily
worship me. I am he who partaketh of all worship, and I am the reward
of all worshippers.&quot;

Compare these passages. The first, a dungeon where crawl the things
begot of jealous slime; the other, great as the domed firmament inlaid
with suns. . . .

The &quot;first&quot; is the god who haunted Calvin's fancy, when he added to
his doctrine of predestination that of Hell being paved with the
skulls of unbaptized infants. The beliefs and dogmas of church are far
more blasphemous in the ideas they imply than those of the benighted
Heathen.

The second is a God whose refuge is available to all, including
christians only if they honestly serve their Jesus.

The first is ready to punish many generations for the perceived sins
of one generation, the other has no such threats.

The first will reward those who dash the babies on the rocks, the
other SHALL protect the babies even in the womb, and SHALL punish
those who kill the babies, born or unborn.

The Bible God *is* on a par with Krishna.  Both are totally fictional.

I agree the Krishna myth and the Hindu religion are nicer than most
Old Testament myths and religion.
You picked a strange forum to discuss it though :-}
