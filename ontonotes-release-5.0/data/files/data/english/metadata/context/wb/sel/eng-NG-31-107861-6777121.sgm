nterest Rates, Loan Program Flexibility and Affordability in
Philippine Real Estate Markets will drive Condotel Investment sales to
new heights in 2007

Lowering interest rates have been a driving force in the rate of
appreciation and the lure of real estate as an investment in the
Philippines.

The Philippines registered a net 11.5% real estate appreciation during
2006, the highest in South East Asia and preconstruction appreciation
rates are much higher in 30% per annum range. The current trend in
lowering interest rates make marginal real estate deals look
attractive. Low rates help marginal home buyers buy larger homes or
enter the market, increasing demand. There is a direct correlation
between the cost of money and the value of high leverage real estate.
Many second homes and investment real estate are now being purchased
with cheap and easy money from lenders and affordable no
prequalification short payment terms offered by developers.
Pacific Concord Properties Inc., a Philippine real estate developer
of the Lancaster Brand of condotels in Metro Manila is now offering
its buyers and Foreign Nationals, Equity Loans for the Lancaster
Suites Tower I Condotel units

Banco De Oro (BDO) a commercial Bank in Metro Manila has just approved
a buyer's financing or mortgage plans for Lancaster Suites Tower I
Manila Condotel units. Beth Collingz, PLC International Marketing
Director stated that "The new financing scheme, a first providing
Philippine Mortgages to Foreign Nationals residing overseas for the
purchase of Condotel units in the Philippines, is now available to
unit owners (Filipinos, Filipino-Americans and Foreign Nationals
alike) whom are looking to purchase a Condo Hotel Suite or refinance
their investments through BDO's Home Loan"

Lancaster Tower I Buyers can take advantage of this offer to free up
some cash as well as to finance the fit-out of their units in the
condotel pool or their business set up requirements in their
commercial units or purchase preconstruction units in the new
Lancaster Atrium Manila Condotels. "Many of my previous clients whom
have purchased units in Lancaster Suites Tower I are now set to cash
in on their equity by availing of the new 15 year financing option to
be able to reinvest in new units at Lancaster Atrium which is
currently on preconstruction selling"

Better yet, "we are currently working on terms to release a
preconstruction loan package this spring 2007 for buyers of the new
Condotel development by the company; Lancaster - The Atrium that will
provide PCPI's clients the option to purchase condotel suites at
preconstruction prices and finance the purchase over 15-20 year

payment plan"..... said Collingz

Philippine Immigration policy and the dollar's real value may turn out
to be more important to general home values than interest rates. If
foreign investors feel at home in the Philippines, they will likely
take up more permanent residence here in larger numbers as the general
cost of living is a lot less expensive than in the United States or
Europe. Even if the dollar continues to devalue, our real estate is a
bargain that cannot be passed up by the world's boomers.
