Hi,

I read from an article of the democratic debate about the candidates
hilliary, obama, et al are waffling on the issue of 2013 of a
solution. It seems before they will do anything, they want another
second term first. I thought a president was elected to a second term
by accomplishments in the first term?

A second point that really bothers me is this &quot;...I have inherited the
problem from the last administration, and cannot expect to solve it in
my first time,&quot; aka hillary clinton. Well, I heard that excuse before
when I used to be a full Packer fan. In 1974, Bart Star was hired as
coach of the Packers, and the same excuse was used. Also, in that
year, my father was an executive at Walker Manufacturing in Racine,
WI, and they had a 2% dip in sales. But, everyone forgot that from
when he came on in 1968, he saved the company from bankruptcy. Well, a
Packer fan at Walker used then Packer management, and did a legal
trick that denied him his pension, one day before it was due. While
Bart Star was able to have 9 successive losing years, and stay on as
coach. Suffice to say, that since 1974, I have not been a Packer fan,
and completely stopped watching them on TV or even reading about them
in the papers. In good conscious, I cannot support professional
football until they clean up, i.e. Michael Vick should be barred for
life, and other matters.

The moral of the story is that those who are popular don't need to
produce. So, when someone says they inherited a problem, it means that
they won't produce, I cannot vote for something like that.

It seems that Hilliary and the other democrats now want the same
fridge benefits bart star had as head coach of the packer, no goals
and objectives, no achievements, elect us because we are popular. NO!

Winning in Iraq is their goal.  They were just pandering to the anti-war
crowd for money.  They got the money, now on to the general election, and
then victory in Iraq.

We can continue to occupy Iraq indefinitely and pretend that we have not

the pretense of success and profitability.  This is called pandering to

The  Chinese model is worth comparing with.

AsiaTimes Online letters http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Letters.html :

The rest of the developing world is watching closely the China
leadership model to see what they can learn from it (Let us now praise
Hu Jintao [Jul 27]). The two-party (or multi-party) adversarial
Western system certainly will not work for them. In this system the
opposing parties do their worst to demonize and destroy their rivals
from within and from without. You can follow the current US
presidential debates for a first-hand example. In a developing
country, to lose can literally be fatal to the candidate and for his
followers. What has never been raised in any discussion so far is the
fate for the outgoing leader. Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin retired
peacefully and on schedule, with honor and their legacy a base from
which the successor builds on to progress further. More important,
their families and supporters have been left unmolested after their
leader departed. One must realize that the fate of the kith and kin of
an outgoing leader is of paramount importance in the path to a smooth
transition of power. China's example shows that a leader need not
cling to power until death or through a coup. And a leader's political
supporters and kin need not scramble for personal power bases or
personal fortunes that can survive the demise of their leader. In the
current Chinese system the mechanism for a smooth political transition
makes possible to plan for rational leadership succession. This allows
the search for the next national leader who will have popular support
of the power elite as well as the support of those senior public
service heads. This person can then be groomed and tested for the
ultimate leadership position. To arrive to this exalted status of
crown prince in waiting would have to have proven performance as a
political functionary and in senior public service positions. This
person will unlikely be able to acquire this record until at least
into his mid-40s to early 50s. Another eight to 10 years of grooming
in the Politburo and he's 60, an age of wisdom, of benign temperament
yet healthy enough for another 10 years to endure the rigors of
office. Then he must retire. This age means he won't have the physical
strength to stay on even if he wants to. A leader's function is to
provide the stability and the continuity for each member of the
leadership team to pool their talents and to function as a team for
the governance of China. A practically guaranteed 10-year term under a
designated leader gives enough time and stability to formulate,
develop, implement programs and realize tangible results. Hu Jintao
fits this profile. I don't know if this is what Deng Xiaoping planned,
but that was what he set up by example, not by law. His successors
will find it very difficult to break those precedents. China has a
government that is dynamic and works spectacularly. We have peace,
stability and prosperity in the country. Why would anyone want to copy
the chaotic political system of the West?
Kelvin Mok (Jul 27, '07)

Michael Chang's article [Let us now praise Hu Jintao] and Kelvin Mok's
letter [both Jul 27] are spot on. The East and the West have different
models because of history and their route to development. The West was
fortunate to be able to develop in an era when many actions that were
blatantly wrong, discriminatory and corrupt were actively implemented.
Now that they have attained developed status, they expect developing
countries to have their lofty ideals, which are hemorrhaging their
societies. These developing societies should learn from the West but
absorb only those policies and practices that are possible and
relevant to themselves.

if the chinese model is so attractive why do you live in BC , why don't you
trundle your ass back to the eastern paradise you so extoll.
a one party state is a corrupt state.
the CHICOM party's days are numbered as the chinese populace becomes better

I must have hit a very sensitive spot somewhere.  Good.  It will set
you on the path to examine alternative solutions for the malaise that
has descended upon Western civilization and her institutions.  Tune in
to any PBS forum, talk show and special report on American and western
institutions and on governance.  Its often a litany of woes of which
the original question in this thread is a typical example.  And if you
had followed this newsgroup over as short a period as the last three
years you would have noticed a fundamental change in the attitudes of
the participants to one that is a lot less arrogant a lot less sure
that you have all the answers to the world's ills.  I have no pretense
about changing you around to my side.  But I shall continue giving you
those little nudges when I sense you are moving in the right direction
and away from the old attitudes that sent you into Iraq and many other
foreign misadventures..

the west is centuries beyond the east in civilization. but as eastern
people see more of the west they want what we have.
the repressive authoritarian systems of the east will be replaced. the
sentiment that got people into tianamen sq is still there just below the
surface.
if  china is so wonderful why did so many hong kongese decamp for british
columbia when the reds took over.
