I went to Fry's Electronics yesterday to turn in a monitor for fixing.  I
had to get a "manager" to search the files for my sales invoice.

This "manager" was 18 years old.  We spent a bit of time together getting
the records out of the computer database.

In that time, he told me had just bought a new RX8, which cost him $650 per
month.  And he was paying $300 per month insurance.

I told him to buy a beater and invest the difference, and in a few years
he'd have a lot of money.

All I got was a blank stare.

$950 a month to drive a car that will depreciate to 50% of value in less
than five years?

I guess I don't get it.

I just bought an '06 Dodge Cummins 2500 Quadcab for $35,800, but I paid
cash.  I don't pay interest, I earn it.  I got to take a hefty deduction on
this year's taxes for the vehicle, reducing my tax obligation by about
$9,000.

I don't understand why people don't do the math and see how much interest
they are paying, how top heavy they are in their loan, and how much money
they are just tossing out the window.

To drive a new car.  Probably still living with mom and dad, too.  Must be a
short penis thing.

Sheesh is right.  I pay only a little more than he does in insurance on
my fast car for a whole year.

My beater is worth less than what he spends in two months on his
payment and insurance costs.

A beater has so many advantages, and so few drawbacks.

Yeah, if I had $900/month to do nothing with but invest with no eye
toward anything but having a pile of money on the other end, I sure as
hell wouldn't buy a frickin' car.  Of course, with a mortgage,
retirement investing and college fund input, $900/month is a laugher -
but at the other end there'll be real assets.  In the meantime, I'll
just keep buying 100k-mile Audis and run them 'til they die.  Fifteen
years and counting on that strategy...

There is something to be said for a new car.  And a used one.

I bought my first new car this past year, and I am 58.  A new Dodge truck
for $36k, and I paid cash.  I love it.

But, I also have had beaters that died on me.  You pull to the shoulder,
pull the plates, shoot it, and walk away.  Or some slight variation from the
theme.

Point is, there is no separation anxiety involved.

Now, with the new one, it would be different, but I know that new one will
be here after I'm gone, and my son and SIL will put it to good use
terrorizing deer and turkey and the like.

But the $3-5k you threw away in depreciation - was that worth the love?
That kind of money can buy a lot of love, just ask Aunt Judy.

Ah.  Well, I've never had the "pleasure".  I did have a fuel pump die
on me out in the middle of BFE.  But, since I knew that it was close to
time for that, I had one in the trunk.  Obviously, you can't carry
spares for everything, but after fifteen years, I have a good idea of
what to carry, and what not to carry.

The reliability angle is something I find quite oversold on new cars.
A used car, well maintained, will be exceedingly reliable.

It also helps to buy a used car that was a good example to begin with.

I've known people who were in and out of the shop with new cars all the
time (and not for fiddly little wind-noise-and-rattle issues either).
Most of them had bought a newly introduced or greatly "upgraded" model,
but some models or even entire makes never did seem to systematically
get it right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Ah-yup.  Some individual cars (and again, some combinations of make,
model, year, and equipment) are just doomed to be garage queens.

By and large, I think a new(ish) car *is* going to be more reliable
than a used one -- you just have to be honest with yourself about how
much of the decision is based on a smokescreen of FUD, and also about
your self-sufficiency in things mechanical, the sensitivity of your job
and lifestyle to schedule delays, etc.

And as mentioned earlier, the art of driving a succession of beaters
also includes a keen sense of when it has ceased being highly
economical transportation and become a parts donor.

Agreed, completely.

The components on cars, especially the auxillary stuff, all has a
finite lifespan.  Alternators, starters, fuel pumps, window motors,
switches, etc, will all last a long time, but not infinitely.  :)

For example, the life span of a Bosch or VDO fuel pump for an Audi is
anywhere from about 100k miles up to 200k miles.  I have one Audi that
has the original fuel pump still going at 210k miles.  Obviously,
there's a part that's sitting on my shelf waiting for warmer weather
and an empty gas tank.

Of course, Murphy's Law states the thing will fail directly after
pulling out of the gas station, and during the coldest day of the year.
:)

In any case, this knowledge helps reduce this from a "I'm stranded,
call a tow truck" to a "hey, I've got a couple of hours this Saturday -
I'm gonna replace the fuel pump."  (On these cars, this is not a big
job.  On one GM pickup I know of, the gas tank has to be removed, and
the part from the stealership costs $450.  Ouch.)

It's a change of mindset, I think, and also due to the fact I have
wrenches, and I don't mind swinging them myself.

IMHO the lifespan of those components on an older car seems to be
longer than the ones on newer cars.  e.g. compare and contrast the old
reliable Delco 10SI and 12SI alternators with the new CS series.  The
older parts were likely more user-serviceable as well.  There seems to
be a trend towards making parts into unitized plastic sealed packages;
so that if, say, a window motor on your new car fails you have to go to
the dealership and buy a new motor.  Whereas on an older car you could
spread it out on a workbench, find a worn out brush or whatever, file
one from the hardware store to fit, and reassemble having only spend a
few cents and your labor time.

Hell, on my Studebaker, a fuel pump REBUILD KIT is about $20.  No need
to ever buy a new fuel pump.  And if it ever does fail completely in
BFE I can go to my FLAPS and buy a universal electric pump and some
wire and get home.

There's a lot to be said for utmost simplicity.

Well, sure.  If I rode a bike everywhere, I'd never have downtime, LOL.

Everything's a trade-off.  And in the used car biz, when you trade
simplicity for convenience, you know exactly what you're getting.
Well, that and the knowledge that you actually *can* rebuilt the fuel
pump, alternator, starter, etc.

I also submit that most people who are weighing the risks vs. benefits
of a used car are talking about a '95 Toyota, not a '61 Studie.

Those of us willing to commute and/or drive cross-country in an
antique/classic or other *hobby* car, and have the skills and
resourcefulness to  wrench it ourselves when it breaks, are great fun
to shoot the bull with, but not at all representative of mainstream
consumers.  Most people wouldn't know from a motor brush if the doctor
had to  remove it from their nose.

I think they sell themselves short and lose a chance at enjoyable and
useful skills by not at least learning what the technology looks like
with the inspection plates off,  but in modern USAmerican consumer
culture rather than our more steampunky and/or agrarian roots, or some
Pirsigean utopia, I'm afraid that's how it is...

(Then again, there are also plenty of people to whom you just want to
say, "Put the tool down and back slowly away from the [car | outlet |
garbage disposal] and nobody will get hurt"...)

It's a '55, actually :)

But I think my assertion holds true for less extreme values of "old
car."  I had a long string of mid-80's Volkswagens that I flat out
loved... I'm still trying to remember why I sold the Scirocco.  I think
it was because I'd bought a new car, which I later ended up selling when
issues with my then-current job left me with less income than I'd
planned on.  But anyway, I did several component-level repairs on these
VW's and a contemporary BMW, including disassembling dash switches to
clean contacts/replace bulbs, at least one point where I swapped a stalk
from a busted turn signal switch to a good working switch with the wrong
stalk (no cruise control) to pass an inspection.  I don't know that I
would feel comfortable doing stuff like that with a brand new car; they
are just too complex.

I guess I must have had a unique upbringing...  my family has always
been frugal; my dad kept the only car *he* ever bought new, a '67
Cutlass, until I was already in school... so it was over 10 years old
and had over 300K miles when it went to the Big Parking Lot In The Sky.
That was the GOOD car... the beater cars were a '59 Chevy (which,
honestly, I don't remember - so it must have been replaced sometime in
the mid-70s) followed by a '64 Valiant.  Obviously these were taken to a
mechanic only when all home repairs had failed to produce the desired
result...

Certainly.  And even if you never, ever use the knowledge, just having a

I doubt it.

Not only that, nobody outside of a very select few would say anything
but "why in the hell would you do something like that?"

Finally, the costs are not even close to comparable.  Car, donor
motor/tranny/work involved wouldn't even touch what a new Vette would
cost.  Not even close.

And the end result would not have 'Vette performance, either.  And FWD
to boot.

Yeah.  I hate that.  Last time I took my car in, I told them exactly
what was wrong, and how to test for it.

I didn't have the tools or the time to do the work, but no, I get a big
song and dance, and finally, after they played the "throw parts at it
until something sticks", the part I said was faulty was actually, and
the replaced it.

I had to talk to the owner of the place for an hour to only get charged
for the work that I said was required in the first place.  Fuckers.

I'm starting to bash my head against that wall.

I am typing this from my laptop in the garage as I'm attempting to
disassemble the Corrado.  I suspect, although I will need to run a
compression test to be sure, that I might be looking at a very intricate
piece of German scrap.  Why?  Because that noise that I heard that I
kept telling her to get checked out was apparently the supercharger
turning itself into metal shavings.

No mechanic could hear it.

Just like no mechanic can feel the vibration from the Porsche that is
driving me apeshit.

Someone PLEASE point me towards a mechanic that doesn't completely suck
ass before I go on a killing spree.  I don't mind paying, I don't care
what it costs (so long as it's less than what a replacement vehicle
would cost) I just don't want to turn any more wrenches, and I want my
shit fixed, and I want it fixed right, and I don't want to bring it back
and have you ask me in a condescending manner if I'm sure there's a
problem with my car.

I am just a little bit pissed right now, not least because I can't
physically remove the supercharger from the car because of a stripped
bolt head that is likely going to require removal of the radiator to
drill out which makes me even less happy - and I'll be damn near
homicidal if I end up pulling it only to find that the car is toast.

Yep. They never 'feel' it. I remember once when I knew the toe-in was
off. I brought the car in to have the alignment taken care of. Guy thinks
I am crazy when he adjusts it just a tiny bit.

I have these stripped head bolt extractors. They are like sockets, one
end has teeth to dig into the stripped bolt head and the other end has a
hex for a wrench. From sears. Had them for some time with no need to
use them. Since I got them I haven't had a bolt head strip on me. I think
they must work ;)

Ahhh, crap.  Yeah, the G60 clearances are so small that even the
smallest amount of play can cause the "impeller" to touch the scroll.

Yeah, before you do any removal of anything, you might as well do a
leakdown test as well as the static test.

If the bits of scroll and impeller got into the cylinders, that motor
is essentially done.  You might actually be able to pick up a used VR6
and harness cheaper than fixing the 1.8SC you've got going.

I've heard that G-Laders have to be rebuilt once every 80k or so to
keep them from imploding.

Shameless plug:  the K24 turbos on the UrS-car Audis, even if they
self-destruct (which is never, because they are very reliable) have 8
feet of plumbing to catch any and all metal bits that may find their
way into the intake tract.  This includes an intercooler with many
narrow passages.

Not stock.  Faster.  Different.

Pick your adjective.

Now, if you converted it to RWD, and then gave it 350HP or so, then
you'd in a 'Vette's performance envelope.  But that would cost money on
the scope of....

...a new 'Vette.

Sorta like buying a Mustang and improving it's handling, braking and HP
to get it to within the performence envelope of a Corvette.  (I think
that point has been made somewhere before...)

So you're supposed to stop making modifications when you get sufficently
close to the performance of a more costly vehicle then?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Neither. I don't accept the premise that one who modifies a vehicle, to
whatever lengths is trying to make 'corvette' or anything else out of a
particular car.

You mentioned dropping in a V8 and going to RWD. Some people do that with
a ford focus. They do it for fun, to be different. Same with a
turbocharged mustang, it's done to be different. Same as I would if I got
my hands on an aussie twin turbo I6 to drop into my maverick. It's not to
make a friggin corvette out of it, it's to be different from everybody
else or at the very least to make a better whatever it was to start with.

I read an article where a guy spent a great deal of time puting a jaguar
V12 into a corvair. He took it a step further though... he made the car
look and sound bare bones stock from the outside. To the point of mocking
up the wheels so as to have the OEM hubcabs on them or fabricated
replicas there of that fit whatever wheels he had on it.

Not everybody aspires to have a corvette or an SUV or whatever. Most
people who modify a car are looking for just what you said, a better,
different, not stock version of whatever they started with. Not trying to
find some cheaper way to corvette or whatver car's performance.

It's never cheaper unless the 'goal' car is very close to the start car
and the goal car suffers from dealer/manufacturer mark up.

&gt; On one GM pickup I know of, [to get at the fuel pump]

">

I think that's pretty common for, at least, late model GM pickups and
pickup-derived vehicles.  Learned that when the fuel pump on my wife's
'95 GMC van packed it in at the far point of a long vacation trip
(with the tank nearly full, natch).  I didn't have the logistical
wherewithal to do the job myself, but fortunately had a friend's
recommendation of a good nearby garage, as well as a credit card
without too much smoke coming out.

I recently read an outside-the-box (or actually under-the-box)
suggestion that it might  be easier to remove the truck bed than to
drop the tank, but haven't had occasion to try it out.

That's another thing kids can learn from doing their  own mechanical
work:  that sometimes there are acceptable, or even better, ways of
doing things than the official ones -- how to see them, how to analyze
them for merits and drawbacks and hidden gotchas, etc. are very useful
life skills as well as ways to get your car back on the road.  Ideally
you end up with expert skills combined with "beginner's mind" -- a
heck of a combination!

Of course, although there are great educational and pragmatic and
financial reasons for working on one's own car (at leat to the point
of popping the hood and giving the problem a chance to be simple and
stupid, some of us are just unsatisfied with experiencing the
technical world from a  user standpoint.  *Those* are, I'd imagine,
your proto-mechanics and -engineers.
