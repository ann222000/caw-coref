Under the political hegemony of the ruling CPI (M), Christian Congress, and
the Muslim League in Kerala....

- Under the political hegemony and open patronage of the ruling
CPI(M), Christian Congress, and the Muslim League, the organized criminal
gangs fully backed and financed by Pakistan ISI and smugglers from the
Middle-East, illicit money launderers and Jihadis have multiplied
their wealth and power in Kerala. The criminal organisations, mostly from
the Middle-East launder money into Kerala and this has brought about a
massive, ugly, and ever-expanding phenomenon of increasing criminalization.

- 'This increased criminal activity in Kerala is based on a continuing
symbiotic relationship between criminal gangs, government agencies and
politicians. Their ability to bribe and corrupt political leaders, law
enforcement agencies and media persons is enormous. Crime syndicates
operating in Kerala have established safe heavens in Dubai and Karachi where
the governments are hostile to the Indian democratic tradition.'

- The long established pattern and tradition of public peace and
tranquility and overall communal and social harmony in Kerala is
now undergoing
a violent change on account of the lawless anti-national forces being
let loose in a deliberate manner by the ruling CPI(M)-led government.

- Kerala is witnessing an unprecedented rise in the rates of crime and
violence during the last three or four years. There is a steadily
rising upward trend in major categories of crime like rape, armed decoity,
robbery, aggravated assault, larceny, homicide, kidnapping, drug trafficking
and contract murder.

- There is an increasing incidence of politically motivated murder,
violent crime and terrorist bombing. The actual incidence of crime
against women and children is higher than the number of recorded crimes
reported to the police.

- There is continued and extended political patronage of the CPI (M)
and its allies in the government to black money launderers, illegal
drug traffickers, flesh traders and explosive marketers. Drunken and
often violent hooliganism has become a standard feature of night life in
most towns and cities. 'There is a standard black market in Kerala for
illegal drugs, illicit liquor, explosives and counterfeit money. Criminal
gangs and loan sharks prowl the streets and they settle disputes with
violence, kidnapping and murder.'

- More and more Hindu activists belonging to the RSS and the VHP are
getting killed by CPI (M) activists almost everyday operating in
continuous criminal collusion with Islamic fanatics belonging to different
Muslim political outfits. Murdering and beheading of several innocent Hindus
and Hindu activists has become a regular feature in recent years.

*Excerpts:*
=================================
To cite a few specific instances in this context: On 3 May, 2003, in a
coastal area in Calicut city called Marad, a large gang of criminal and
fundamentalist Muslim fishermen hacked to death in a brutal manner eight
Hindu fishermen. Around 140 terrorist Muslims were arrested and are
undergoing trial. Much to the discomfiture of major political parties in the
State, the Joseph Commission, which was set up to inquire into the
circumstances that led to the second Marad killings in May 2003, has in a
way, turned the spotlight on the facts and circumstances of the 2002
killings. The report emphasises that the January 2002 incident was the
result of political interests and other vested interests that developed
following a minor altercation between two men belonging to the different
communities, which flared up into a major communal incident resulting in the
death of five people, injury to several others and damage to several houses.
The delay in filing charge-sheets in that case was subsequently utilised by
'Muslim fundamentalists, terrorists and other forces' to capitalise on the
grievance of relatives of three Muslims killed and to use it as a cause for
vengeance against Hindus of Marad as a whole. The inquiry by the State Crime
Branch CID (CB-CID) into the May 2003 incident had failed to unravel the
'larger conspiracy' and the sources of the large cache of arms and
ammunition unearthed subsequently in the area and of the sizable funds used
in the planning and execution of the murders.

The commission's main recommendation is a further inquiry, involving the
Intelligence Bureau (IB), the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) into the 'larger conspiracy'
involving fundamentalist and other forces, and into the source of the
explosives and funds that the CB-CID 'failed or refused' to investigate --
an act that the commission described as 'quite suspicious and disturbing.'
It has also indicated the urgent need to inquire into the involvement of
Inter-State Muslim terrorist groups and the involvement of foreign terrorist
agencies like the ISI.

The panel has concluded that the incident was a sequel to the largely
politically motivated murder of five persons in the village in January 2002
and a fallout of the then Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF)
government's 'unjustified delay' in the prosecution of those accused of the
crime. The whole truth behind the revenge killings at the coastal village of
Marad in Kozhikode district in May 2003, the worst communal incident in the
recent history of Kerala, is unlikely to be revealed soon, if at all.

The commission report is also critical of the role of the civil
administration, the State police and the Crime Branch. It says that despite
clear evidence that there was a 'long-drawn conspiracy' and that the
objective of the assailants was not merely to kill certain persons but 'to
create bigger havoc and ignite large-scale riot', the CB-CID team stuck to
its simple theory of revenge killings. The question as to whether other
forces were involved in the massacre 'was not even an issue for the Crime
Branch team,' the report says. The Joseph Commission has also strongly
indicted the civil administration for being lethargic and failing to take
timely, preventive and remedial action after the 2002 incident even though
intelligence reports had indicated that there was the possibility of
violence again at Marad and that stockpiling of weapons by both sides was
taking place, mostly in Muslim-dominated areas. The panel has also found
evidence of detailed intelligence reports suggesting that efforts of
government-initiated peace committees were not yielding the desired results,
that fundamentalist elements were active in the area and that the people
feared an imminent bout of communal revenge attacks. It has drawn attention
to the report of one of the officers of the State Special Branch that 'a
person nicknamed 'FM' (Finance Minister) who came to Kozhikode from the Gulf
countries on 2 May, 2003 was the source of the money behind the massacre',
that two Cabinet Ministers of the State had 'unimaginable connections' with
the 'FM'.

The CPI (M) coalition government slept over this recommendation of the
District and Sessions Judge for making a reference to the CBI and other
Central agencies. At long last the government of Kerala accepted the
recommendation of the District and Sessions Judge Thomas P Joseph and
requested the government of India to direct the CBI to enquire into the
matter. All the Muslim terrorist groups in Kerala have now brought political
pressure on the UPA government to stall all further action in the matter.
Under pressure from the UPA government, just in order to keep his job at any
cost, the Director of the CBI has chosen to ignore the considered
recommendation of the Joseph Commission and later duly seconded by the
government of Kerala. The functioning of the CBI during the last two decades
has been professionally so disgraceful that it has indeed become a monument
of national shame and dishonor. It functions as an exclusively elitist
executive arm of the Congress Party for settling all its political scores
with its political enemies, known and unknown.
