This AM I went out early 6:00 AM to look at our street.  Ten feet away
from our house I saw a vulture hopping about trying to fly.  First
thought an isolated broken wing perhaps.  Further down the driveway
about 40 yards I came across about 30 vultures exhibiting the same
behave.  Looking about I saw another 30 doing the same.
My neighbor¹s large pines are a favorite roost for this guys.  Looking
up I saw maybe 20 in their normal positions.  I think the Ice/ sleet
grounded the majority of our local vultures.  Never saw anything like
this here in over 50 years but the vultures have only been here like
this for ~25.

I guess vultures are quite sensitive to the additional weight of wet or
damp wings!! I frequently see large numbers sitting on their roosts
early in the morning when we have have had a heavy "dew", with their
wings spread to their full width. I have always  just assumed they were
waiting for their wings to dry. It's almost impossible to get them to
try for a "take off" until a half an hour or so in the morning sun in
this position!!
