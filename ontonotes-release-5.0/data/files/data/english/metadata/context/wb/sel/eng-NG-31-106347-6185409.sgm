I have just transplanted a small spruce from the woods out behind my house,
to my side yard.  The tree is about 15 inches tall, (smallish).  Can I put a
Jobe-spike in the hole now, or should I wait awhile, until the transplant
"shock" wears off?

If you're in an area where below freezing temps occur, don't do anything
that would encourage new growth. Leave it alone until spring.

You want to help it overcome the transplant shock without encouraging
new upper plant growth.  Use a weak miracle grow mix followed by a root
stimulator fertilizer. (low 1st number with high second number, like
2-20-6).

I would suggest you can use them, but I would put only a few and only
like a foot away from the root ball.  That should encourage root growth out
of the existing root ball into the surrounding soil.  You don't want to
shock it with a lot of fertilizer now.

I was surprised to find that searching for "fertilizing new trees" at Google
produced anything at all, but it did.

Forget the job spike it's no better than commom garden fertilizer
broadcast on the surface.
However consider that what you want to do is like asking a heart
transplant patient to eat a thanksgiving meal and run a marathon right
after surgery.
A better idea would be a few inches of shredded leaves as mulch and
careful attention to watering.
If you must fertilize it, wait til next year.
