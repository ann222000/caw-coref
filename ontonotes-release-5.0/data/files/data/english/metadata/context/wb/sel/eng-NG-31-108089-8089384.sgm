Your &quot;understanding&quot; is a bit scary. One way I look at your
understanding the situation is that you agree with Russell's
frustration and are okay with his actions. On the other hand, ya might
be agreeing with a way that the feller deals with the ghosts of past
bullies.

Either way. It ain't right

Nope, not right at all. Much worse than pretending to fly across the
