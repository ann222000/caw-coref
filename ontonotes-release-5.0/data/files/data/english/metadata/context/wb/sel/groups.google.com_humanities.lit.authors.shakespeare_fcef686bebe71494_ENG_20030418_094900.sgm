Introductory Notes.

Perhaps as a natural continuation of the renunciation of the
previous sonnet, or perhaps independently of it, the poet here
reflects on his woeful state. He is like a patient in a fever who
has been declared by the physician to be past cure. All his thoughts
and words are like those of madmen, and everything is uttered at
random, without any coherence. His fever lends him words, and
although he cannot explain his infatuation, he feels it to be wrong,
and yet he is compelled to continue drinking and eating the same
noxious food which brought on his disease in the first place. Hence
there is no escape for him, and he sees himself trapped in the black
vortex of hell in which his mistress resides, and there is no
release from the darkness.

Line Notes.

1. 'My love is as a fever longing still,' [My love = my passion for
you, my infatuation.
longing still = constantly desiring, incessantly eager. fever - A
term often associated with love which Shakespeare has already used
in connection with his aberrant behaviour when he appeared to have
deserted the youth and distracted himself with other loves: 'How
have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted/ In the distraction
of this madding fever!' 119.

Medically a fever was 'an vnnaturall heate grounded in the hearte
and lyuer'. (OED cites this from 1547). Given the uncertain
knowledge of the time, it could be applied to almost any illness.
The usual treatment would be blood letting, which was supposed to
reduce the inner pressures and temperature:

DUM. I would forget her; but a fever she
Reigns in my blood and will remembered be.
BIR. A fever in your blood! why, then incision
Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision! LLL.IV.3.91-4.

Since fever brought on ravings, there was a widespread belief that
the sick persons always irrationally desired the thing which was no
good for them. They might wish for fruit or drinks for example,
which the physician would consider to be unsuitable and damaging to
the health. Hence the prescription (line 6) could be, as well as
medicine, a prohibition against the consumption of these supposedly
undesirable foods. Compare: '...................and your affections
are/ A sick man's appetite, who desires most that/ Which would
increase his evil.' COR.I.1.173-5.]

2. 'For that which longer nurseth the disease;' [longer = for a
longer time. The proximity of longing and longer makes it seem as if
the patient longs to prolong his illness. that which etc. = the
unsuitable food or drink which caused the disease initially.
nurseth = nurses. The word is ambiguous, for it suggests two
opposites, 'brings back to health', and 'tends carefully, so that it
(the illness) stays'.]

3. 'Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,' [Feeding on -
i.e. his love is feeding on the forbidden fruit. which doth
preserve the ill = which causes the illness to remain.]

4. 'The uncertain sickly appetite to please.' [(In order to)
satisfy my wavering, distempered desires. appetite = desire for
food. But, in the context of a diseased love, it signifies lust,
carnal desire. OED.3 gives: 'one of those instinctive cravings which
secure the preservation of the individual and the race'.
Shakespeare's use of the word is often rather stronger and more
specific than OED indicates, as the following three extracts show:

Behold yond simpering dame,
Whose face between her forks presages snow;
That minces virtue, and does shake the head
To hear of pleasure's name;
The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't
With a more riotous appetite. KL.IV.6.118-23.

Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
And bestial appetite in change of lust; R3.III.5.80-1.

There is no woman's sides
Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
So big, to hold so much; they lack retention
Alas, their love may be called appetite,
No motion of the liver, but the palate,
That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt; TN.II.4.92-8.

The subject of the line is 'my love, which is like a fever' (line
1). Note that the word order is inverted - 'in order to please the
sickly appetite'.]

5. 'My reason, the physician to my love,' [My reason - one of the
faculties of the soul. Its presence here, as also the feeding
metaphors, help to tie this poem in with the previous one. the
physician = the doctor. The two words were used by Shakespeare
without distinction. Shakespeare's daughter Susanna married the
physician John Hall in 1607.]

6. 'Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,' [prescriptions =
rules of good health, the regimen given as a means of curing a
disease, proscriptions (i.e. orders to avoid certain things). In
more recent use the word came to mean 'the medicine (which had been
written down by the doctor)'. kept = observed, obeyed. As in 'to
keep one's promise'.]

7. 'Hath left me, and I desperate now approve' [Hath left me - i.e.
my reason has left me. I desperate = I, having become desperate;
in desperation, I etc. approve = demonstrate, show by my
experience, give proof that.]

8. 'Desire is death, which physic did except.' [A line of uncertain
meaning which is variously glossed. 'Desire, such as I experience
it, will bring my death, although the appropriate medicine would
have averted it'. 'Any desire which militates against good medical
practice brings death to the patient'. 'Sexual desire shortens
life, but medicine can allay the effects of it'. 'Sexual desire
under certain conditions which would cause physicians to forbid it,
will prove fatal'. The difficulty is partly in the word 'except',
but also in the compression of 'desire is death'. 'except' probably
means here 'took exception to'. (See SB.p.518-9). There was a belief
that every orgasm shortened one's life by a day. There may also be a
reference to venereal disease in 'desire is death'. It was
widespread and often fatal. See the note below to line 13.]

9. 'Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,' [An echo of the
proverb 'Past cure past care', meaning that when curative remedies
have been exhausted to no effect, there is no point in worrying any
further, but also equivalent to the more humdrum 'Don't cry over
spilt milk'. Shakespeare has inverted it by saying 'Reason is past
care i.e. beyond hope, therefore I am past cure'.]

10. 'And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;' [And frantic mad = and
I am frantically mad; I have become frantic. Note that Q's spelling
of 'mad' as 'madde' allows a confusion with made. Thus 'I have been
made frantic by my love for you'. The spelling of 'mad' in the
following line is conventional. evermore unrest = unrest which is
incessant and endless. Evermore seems here to have an adverbial
force, but if taken as two words, 'ever more', it could mean unrest,
disquiet, which is continually increasing.]

11. 'My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,' [There is a
feverish quality to these two lines, in keeping with the theme of
fever introduced at the start. He no longer knows what he is saying
or if his thoughts have any meaning. my discourse = my speech; my
reasoning, my faculty of reasoned speech. As in: 'O, God! a beast,
that wants discourse of reason,/ Would have mourned longer'
Ham.I.2.150-1. where wants = lacks. as madmen's are - i.e. my
speech is like madmen's speech.]

12. 'At random from the truth vainly expressed;' [random - Q's
randon was a variant of the time, based on the French word meaning
'headlong, in a violent rush'. at random from the truth = wide of
the truth, straying erratically and irrationally from the truth,
furiously rushing from the truth. vainly expressed = spoken to no
purpose, spoken with foolhardiness.]

13. 'For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,' [The
couplet explains how he has strayed at random from the truth, for he
has sworn that his beloved is something which she is not, that she
is fair and beautiful, when she in fact is dark and benighted. The
most disturbing aspect of these concluding lines is that they are so
brutal and unforgiving. The epithets have both physical and moral
significance, for he seems determined to prove that she was not
beautiful either in soul or body. There was indeed a tradition
within the sonneteering world at the time that the beloved was not
always as fair as Petrarch's fairest Laura. But it was essentially a
playful tradition, in that there was a determination to find
something different to look at. Robert Tofte, for example, in 1597,
declares

&quot;My mistress seems but brown&quot;, say you to me.
'Tis very true, and I confess the same.
..................
This is the cause: for brown and pitiful
I left a fair, but yet a faithless Trull. Laura III.31.

But Shakespeare's sonnet breaks off from that tradition, for it
heaps vilification on the beloved as if she were a tart. For Tofte
the faithless Trull was the one he had left, not the one he was busy
praising at the moment. Whereas here the poet loves, or pretends to
love, what he finds dark, black, bestial, and morally unfathomable.

It is tempting to ask whether or not this is his madness speaking,
whether or not he is as guiltless as we might assume, whether or not
the man who left to his wife the second best bed night not have been
a swine with women. For it is not impossible that the writer who
gave the world some of the finest women ever created in fiction
should be unable to form a satisfactory relationship with them in
his life. The harsh judgement which here he levies upon his
mistress, as he does also, but less vitriolically, in 131,137 and
152, does not seem to have caused too much disturbance, even among
female critics, who, one would expect, might be more sensitive to
these possibilities. (KDJ and HV for example both comment on this
sonnet unecstatically and with little sense of discomfort at its
content, except perhaps by excusing it as mad ravings).

Yet it is surely appropriate to ask for whom the sonnet was
intended. Was it one of the sugared sonnets among his private
friends, was it intended for his mistress, or was it for the wider
world, the public who might read eventually the full sequence? All
these possibilities fill one with a sense of unease, and however
much one might wish to praise the poem for its unfailing honesty,
one wonders whether that is really a sufficient justification for
its cruelty.

Alternatively we could perhaps look for a mundane explanation, and
see this as the meanderings of someone who is suffering from a bad
dose of the pox. The closing line, with its suggestions of hell and
darkness, is, as always, suggestive of the female hell, the vagina,
which burns with the flame of venereal disease, as in Timon of
Athen's outburst:

...............................................be whores still;
And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,
Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;
Let your close fire predominate his smoke,
And be no turncoats: Tim.IV.3.139-43.

The essential condition for cure of the illness was obviously
abstention from intercourse, which the poet does not seem to be able
to manage, and the physician despairs of him. Apart from that,
treatment was possible by 'suffumigation with cinnabar in a
meat-pickling vat', an experience not likely to be very pleasant.
The patient was at the same time kept on a low diet. After such a
cure anyone might well feel dejected and low and be capable of
writing a sour sonnet or two about his mistress.]

14. 'Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.' [See note above.
The blackness of hell and the darkness of night, and vice versa,
were proverbial attributes.]
