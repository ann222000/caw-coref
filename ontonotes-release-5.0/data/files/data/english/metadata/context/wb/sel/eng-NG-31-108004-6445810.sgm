One of the worst American shows to hit these shores just has to be "Ugly
Betty!!!"  Does ANYONE actually watch this?  Ten minutes was more than
enough for me!

I love it.  The writing's smart and sympathetic.  They fully flesh out
characters while still keeping the campy, rompy fun.  I think it's one
of the better written shows I've seen in a long while.

It starts here this week, or maybe next week. It's on the same
channel that just had the tennis, so I've seen it advertised
a lot. Don't know if I'll watch it.

Well, I did give it ten minutes, just to be fair! Definitely not for us,
Gill!!!

I`ve been watching that awful but addictive "Big Brother" (my favourite
won - a beautiful and sweet "Bollywood" actress called Shilpa Shetty and my
second favourite came second (Germaine - or is it with a "J" Jackson)  Two
lovely, kind and well mannered people, who really showed the other (mostly)
morons up.  I was thoroughly ashamed of most of our own home-grown girls who
were in it.

Is that the show that was in all the papers because of some sort of racial
incident between some of the contestants and the Bollywood actress?  That
doesn't sound like entertainment to me, but I don't watch it so I don't

It's great - absolutely spot on writing - and for those of you who know
your Tudor history, you'll recognize the necklace that Betty wears
(Think one of Henry VIII's wives).

There are lots of quick things that if you aren't paying attention
you'll miss - like the Spanish/South American soap operas playing on the
television in the background, or the sly references to '70s shows like
Dallas or Dynasty.

Betty character is kind, smart, sympathetic. The show just won at least
one award at the Golden Globes. It's certainly a lot more intelligent
than most of the dreck that's on right now.

It's a conflation of Bombay and Hollywood.   Bombay (now properly
called Mumbai) has the world's largest film industry.

That racial controversy was in the papers here in Oz too.  I refuse to
watch the local version of Big Brother, though there was no getting
away from that "turkey slapping" (don't ask) incident last year.   How
a bunch of moronic clowns sitting around bitching about each other
could be considered watchable television I can't imagine.

I won't be watching Ugly Betty either.

Yes, I suppose I'm a GOM.

That`s the one, but the "Racial" aspect was very much exaggerated.  It was
unpleasant, yes, but was more one really nasty and two "Sheep" like silly
girls who followed her lead in bullying another very sweet and beautiful
Indian girl.  I think that the "beautiful" bit had most to do with it - they
were just plain jealous.  It really wasn`t deliberately racist - and she won
in the end, which, thankfully, demonstrated how the rest of the country
felt!

Some of it`s entertaining, but I think that the main interest (to grownups
at least) is seeing how people react to that particularly weird situation of
living together with complete strangers in a confined space, with every move
watched. The two who came out best as far as personality was concerned were
the Indian girl and Jermaine Jackson, both of whom remained kind, humorous
and dignified for the whole period.

I don't watch very much TV nowadays, there is usually something better
to do.  When I do watch TV the only way I can do so (apart from BBC1 and
BBC2) is to record it then play it back so that I can zip through the
frequent advertisements.  And I've noticed a tendency to meld the
adverts into the programmes so it's difficult to know where one ends and
the other begins.

&gt; It's great - absolutely spot on writing - and for those of you who know
&gt; your Tudor history, you'll recognize the necklace that Betty wears
&gt; (Think one of Henry VIII's wives).

&gt; There are lots of quick things that if you aren't paying attention
&gt; you'll miss - like the Spanish/South American soap operas playing on the
&gt; television in the background, or the sly references to '70s shows like
&gt; Dallas or Dynasty.

&gt; Betty character is kind, smart, sympathetic. The show just won at least
&gt; one award at the Golden Globes. It's certainly a lot more intelligent
&gt; than most of the dreck that's on right now.

&gt; I don't watch very much TV nowadays, there is usually something better to
&gt; do.  When I do watch TV the only way I can do so (apart from BBC1 and
&gt; BBC2) is to record it then play it back so that I can zip through the
&gt; frequent advertisements.  And I've noticed a tendency to meld the adverts
&gt; into the programmes so it's difficult to know where one ends and the other
&gt; begins.

That`s what I do - we have a TiVo, qhich is great for that.  But aren`t
there some really odd adverts around?  Sometimes you don`t have a clue as to

What I saw of it I couldn`t even watch it once, let alone twice.  Now Tudor
history is one of my passions and to have someone wearing a copy of a Tudor
necklace isn`t far short of sacrilege! ;-))

If something doesn`t grab me in the first ten minutes I don`t think it worth
persevering with it - sorry.  Hated the characters - well, as far as they
registered.  But then I loathed "Friends" too, and that got loads of awards,
didn`t it?  I can`t really recall an American comedy that I enjoyed,
although I`m sure that there must have been some.  Still. let`s face it, I`m
into classics, dramas, detective series, war, nature (David Attenborough is
my hero!) and mysteries (preferably ghosty ones! the sort where you don`t
actually see anything - not those nasty, silly, exploding heads covered in
slime ones).

Yup - it's actually pretty funny - a satire - but I think you have to get
through it to get it - the first time can be trying.  In 10 minutes you
can't get the whole plot, characters, etc.  It's definitely got a moral in
there - but if you just get 10 min of annoying shallow characters at first
it would be strange at best.

OK - now I'm really laughing.  You could actually sit and watch that total

talking about the racism and what had erupted on the British version of Big
Brother.  Now that's a waste of airwaves with no redeeming anything - just
my opinion  - of course.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Is that the show that was in all the papers because of some sort of
&gt;&gt;&gt; racial incident between some of the contestants and the Bollywood
&gt;&gt;&gt; actress?  That doesn't sound like entertainment to me, but I don't watch
&gt;&gt;&gt; it so I don't really know anything but what I've read in the newspapers.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Lucille

&gt;&gt; OK, I read Bollywood in the newspapers.............what in the world is

&gt; I think that's the name of the Indian movie industry, a takeoff on
&gt; Hollywood.

&gt; L
">

Exactly.  The movie industry in India is huge - IIRC - actually they produce
more films than the US.  And it is based in Mumbai (formerly Bombay) hence
the name Bollywood.

There are some really good Bollywood movies that are being shown here, at
least on cable - and some really, really bad ones.

I really liked Monsoon Wedding - which is very realistic and shows a wedding
in an upper class household in parallel with the lives of the working class
people.  Very interesting - if you're at all interested in the ins and outs
of the rituals, celebrations around an Indian (hindu) wedding.  Also, there
is a film made in Toronto about 2 years ago called "Bollywood, Hollywood" -
which is kind of a send-up, but good.  The latest bad thing on cable is
"Bride and Prejudice" or some such title - it's a modern version of Pride
and Prejudice and I really recommend drinking while watching it -  Ny Indian
friends and I were hysterical at how bad but funny this was.

All good points.  But, I did forget - Talk Soup - a hilarious weekly recap
that completely makes fun of the entertainment industry, and reality shows.
I love the reality show clip of the week. It's on E, and I'm astounded that

LOL - I do really understand that.  When we had been working about a year or
two, a friend from grad school was getting married in Hampton Roads area of
VA.  It's pretty southern there - the Navy shipyards, and NASA Langley in
the vicinity.  So, he works at NASA Langley, and the wedding is full of
really, really, really geekie colleagues - plus friends of both.  This
wedding even included "slam dancing" .  So, all the geeks were doing the
"what do you do where do you work" think - especially with XDH -and we'd
explain how we knew Mark, etc.  Finally, after getting tired of being kind
of snubbed - a bunch of them were talking with us - and being kind of
condescending to me - when xDH explained that I'd also gone to school with
Mark - we were all in the same dept.  At which point they looked at me and
said "oh - so what do you do ?..."  (these are all guys who do computational
stuff, and I'm primarily an experimentalist) .  To which I respond "I blow
things up " .  There is silence, and then they all laugh - hah, hah .  Then
DH - looking very serious "No, that's what she does - really BIG things -
like the size of Saturn V rockets at least" .  Suddenly they all looked
really nervous, and kind of shuffled away.  It was pretty funny.

Once, my instrumentation guy had miscalculated something in our
firing/loading for a shock tube test.  We were doing a test that I thought
was stupid, as did my colleagues - but the sponsor had insisted and so we
came up with a scheme that might work.  Anyhow - the senior guy who ran the
instrumentation section was out, and the younger guy - about my age, was
going to handle this shot.  So, I trust him.  We do all this rigging and
stuff to kluge together the experiment.  Imagine a cube about 8'x10'x12'
blocking the end of a large air gun (this is a shock tube).  We completely
blocked the muzzle end - as we wanted to put a certain type of load on the
door end of the cube.  It was attached on to the muzzle with a collar, and
huge cables with turnbuckles (how I got my back injury at work) like 7/8"
cables each at about 8000# tension. Up on a platform of railroad ties so it
all matched up.  Big day comes - my chief tech and I go out in the field
parallel to the set-up - so we can see.  Sirens, lights - warning.  Then
BOOM.  Then, suddenly, pieces of the interior structural members (from
inside the wall sandwich panels) are flying thru the air - right at us -
we're running and laughing - despite nearly getting speared by some very
sharp wreckage.  When the dust clears - we head over - the "cube" is still
there - kind of.  We can't find the door.  At all. Think like a submarine
door. Finally - tech Bob and I are lying on the ground looking up - and
there is the door - with the end wall it was in rolled around it and halfway
down the side - like opening a sardine can.  I couldn't stop laughing.  I
was hysterical.  Really.  The whole thing was a stupid thing - we'd tried to
do the best.  So, we go to call the sponsor - and one of the other engineers
is talking to them - and the sponsor wants to know if I can get them some
good sized samples - cored thru - like a foot square panel.  One of the guys
explains that I'm kind of "choked up" and that's why I'm not on the phone.
Finally I take the phone and say "no - think twisted airplane wreckage - no
big flat surfaces left" and burst out laughing again.  It was exhilarating.
Oh, the punch line - the instrumentation tech when calculating the charge to
load the shock tube with forgot that we were completely blocking the muzzle
- so instead of a shock wave at a specific duration, it was more like 3
times the duration - which made a standing wave.  What a hoot.  Honestly - I
laughed for days.  There were tears running down my face at the site.  And
the high speed film from the interior - it's great - running along and then
- kablooie.

Don't get too excited about taxpayers dollars - it was just one of those
things.  But, everytime I see some of those pix - it cracks me up.  It had
been a very tedious relationship with the sponsor, and it just seemed like
karma when this large thing just went kablooie.  Especially the bits of
fiberglass, and armor, and what all - raining down around us - as we ran for
our lives.  DH thinks I should just try to get a job with Mythbusters.

&gt;&gt; Rosemary

&gt;&gt;&gt;Still. let`s face it, I`m
&gt;&gt;&gt;into classics, dramas, detective series, war, nature (David Attenborough
&gt;&gt;&gt;is
&gt;&gt;&gt;my hero!) and mysteries (preferably ghosty ones! the sort where you don`t
&gt;&gt;&gt;actually see anything - not those nasty, silly, exploding heads covered
&gt;&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;slime ones).

&gt;&gt;&gt;Pat

&gt; Sports Night.  Best overall comedy for my money.

&gt; Never could get into any of the so-called 'classic' comedies.  Just always
&gt; seemed dumb to me - even as a kid - because if they ever stopped to use
&gt; their brain for even a split second, none of this stuff would ever happen
&gt; to them.

&gt; I do enjoy Malcolm In the Middle sometimes.

I still love "The Two Ronnies".  They played a lot of those over Christmas.
Present day comedians rather leave me cold, on the whole.

My dad used to like "My Favorite Martian" and I've found that it still
makes me laugh when I catch an episode.  I think because it was a
"nicer" time to watch TV.  I just don't like the shows where the humor
is derived from kids being brats, people being made fun of or people
just plain old being mean to each other.  Even those funniest home
video shows always seem to have some poor guy being  hit in the
"utensils", only to have the audience break out in laughter.  A little
bit of that goes a long way and it seems like TV tends to take that
one extra step that keeps me from thinking it's funny anymore.  Oh,
one of the newer shows DH &amp; I discovered after it went into
syndication was "Home Improvement".  I was VERY grateful for that show
when DH was out of work for almost two years.  I knew for sure that he
would laugh at least once during the day.  My all time favorite,
though, has to be I Love Lucy.  I especially love the show where her
fake nose catches on fire when Ricky brings William Holden "home" to
the apartment.  To this day, I can't watch a William Holden movie,
even a serious one, without remembering Lucy's nose and him watching
her eat the spaghetti earlier in the show. :-)))))

Ah, good one.  But, I do think they've gone over the top with Larry not
living any place.  Even our most brilliant mathematician type friends
haven't gone that out of control - except for when they're needing
therapy....

DH likes it because "Charlie" played the lead elf in the Santa Clause 1 -2
movies which we saw on cable - so he always thinks of him as the elf.

I must admit that I don`t usually watch them - but the "Celebrity" ones are
more interesting - just to see if the ones you used to like are as nice as
you imagined (generally they`re not!) and, conversely, the ones you hated
often turn out to be much nicer as themselves.  Note I put "Celebrity" in
inverted commas.

Sorry, but Ugly Betty is the US derivation of spanish-speaking tv
novelas that have been airing for years.  I believe there are at least
half a dozen versions of Ugly Betty out there, all over the world.
Don't blame the US for Ugly Betty--we're just babes in the wood on this one!
