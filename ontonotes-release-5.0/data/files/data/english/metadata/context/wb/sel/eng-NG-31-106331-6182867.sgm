I wanted to start a thread where this idea could be fleshed out some
more.  Kev mentioned this phenomenon on another thread, but I realized
it was off topic for that thread and so I moved it here.

I have noticed that on most other groups, and occasionally on here,
contributors become very brave in what they say and how they say it to
people.  They would probably never act that way in person, but their
anonymity gives them an unbridled courage.

The arguments that are drawn up by these so called Supermen are
anything but rational.  They always end up attacking the person by
slandering them.  This often appears to be innocent at first blush,
but when one analyzes the attackers argument more closely you realize
no rational argument was made against the merits of the victims post,
only against the victim's character.  In philosophy we simply call
this an ad hominem argument, which is classified as a logical
fallacy.  Yet that hasn't deterred internet bloggers, posters,
authors, Minds Eye Junkies etc.  On the contrary this is by far the
most popular way of arguing, especially when the victim's argument was
an unpopular one to begin with.

Thankfully this is one of the most civil groups I have participated in
and that is not as much of a problem here.  However I see it creep in
at times, even in my own responses.  It's not as obvious as "you suck
you crazy Nazi!"  But sometimes we dismiss arguments without really
getting at the merits of what they are saying [I am without an example
at the moment, I hope you know what I mean].

I'm glad though that we have found a name for this phenomenon because
now we can call people on it.  I hope we can make it a long standing
rule of this group that we don't allow the "Internet Superman
Complex."  If it shows up we call em on it.

Much of this post has just been a rant because I'm in a ranting mood,
but I'd like to hear how you all feel about this idea.  Why do people
do it?  Have you found it a convincing way of arguing?  Doesn't it
show a lack of a desire to really get at the truth of the matter?  Let
me know what you think about it.

I'm confused, KC.

Are you suggesting that unreasoned emotional responses are the
exception rather than the rule with social interaction in general? And
that the disintermediated environment exacerbates rather than reflects
this?

I for one am pleased for the right mix of reason and passion on this
forum.

I agree that the anonymity provided by the Internet is a big factor in
people adopting positions where they argue for the sake of an argument. I
think a lot of it is boredom; there's no real desire to expand their
understanding and develop their thinking. They take on more extreme
positions than they otherwise would and strut and posture in such a way that
they never would if you met them in person. Ad hominem attacks are a part of
this for sure.

I deliberately do not post anonymously and I'd like to say you'd get the
same response out of me if you met me face-to-face. You'll be able to ask
Pottsie whether that's the case or not after I meet him in May. :)

That said, I do think ad hominem has merit. Not popular idea, I know. I've
mentioned before that, if done right, ad hominem can get to the crux of the
person; the source of their ideas and where they came from. I think this is
useful in determining the truth of some things. Ideas do not exist in
isolation, except for in the bubble of the philosophy class room.

Ideas may not "exist" in isolation, but can we not isolate them?
Isn't the whole point of argument to isolate someone's argument, show
logical inconsistencies, and then provide a better alternative?  The
only possible advtantage I can see in using ad hominem attacks is as a
rhetorical device.  But even then I wonder who your trying to
convince.  It seems that only small minded people will be convinced by
such tactics.

I like where this conversation is going though.  I really didn't think
that someone would actually come out and defend ad hominem attacks, so
this may be a very interesting conversation indeed.  Please tell me
more.

Paradox,
I think you misunderstood the point of my post.  By no means would I
ever suggest that we are obligated to dispassionately argue our case.
On the other hand I think it is always wrong (at least in a setting
like this) to attack someone's character.  Even if that person is a
truely bad person, or a truely misguided person, I don't think
attacking them personally is going to solve anything.  If their
reasoning is bad then show it.
So by all means, passionately argue your position.   Just don't do it
at the expense of someone else's reputation (whether they deserve it
or not).

(Pottsie)

Just an idea, but I will throw my idea into the ring.

I, to a certain extent and possibly because my ideas
are not mainstream, am often a target of ad hominem
attacks.  At times, the person who engaged in these
attacks will realize what they have done and
apologize, either publicly or privately.  Yet, more
often than not the individual continues to correspond
in a negative fashion.

The reason they do this, I believe, is that they are
so insecure in their own ideas, and their ability to
think, that they cannot rationally dispute the ideas
of the person they are responding to. (That is not to
say that these people can't think, but they only lack
the self-confidence in who they are to know that their
ideas are worthwhile.  They want YOU to think that
they are intelligent, when they don't believe it
themselves.)

One of the things I've noticed about the
Supermen(women) is that they generally do not respond
with agreement when clearly shown to be wrong.

A while back, I made the statement that The Soviet
Union had historically repressed religion....and was
categorically told that I was an idiot and would be
laughed at by any Russian who was in the know.  I
responded with an article from Wikipedia, which
outlined specific examples of religious repression,
and while the responder responded to OTHER ideas in
the post that they disagreed with, to date, there has
been no comment to the extent that they were wrong
about the religious repression issue.

This individual is clearly an intelligent individual,
but I have NEVER witnessed one iota of flexibility in
the possibility that she could be mistaken...not just
in responses to me, but to others as well.

Ian, the Chrises (both DC and CC), Paradox, and a few
others often disagree with me, but in general are
polite, or make some indication that their response is
in good humor through a ;P or ;), or some other
notation.

Perhaps it is stooping to the lowest common
denominator, but I will not tolerate an attack on my
intelligence, and will fire back in like kind.  I left
the Atheist vs Christian forum because there is
absolutely no redeeming virtues on that list.  The
atheists there do not listen in the least, and view
themselves as Lions vs. Christians.  When I see it
creeping in on THIS forum, I will fight it to the
fullest extent possible, because THIS forum, for the
most part, is interesting and challenging.

I've said on a number of occasions that I post on this
list to challenge myself intelllectually on my
beliefs, and I get to do that in talking with MOST
people on this list.  When it becomes degraded into a
"You're a @#$%#! idiot!" conversation, the only way to
fight it is to join it, because to ignore it
encourages more of it, and to try to reason with them
is impossible.  To me the only way is to call them on
it and hope that they will go away.

Namaste

Pottsie

My contention is that these battles of logic can sometimes be so
disconnected from our human reality that they become meaningless. You end up
arguing about, well, piffle! You argue about the intricacies of arguing and
you don't solve anything. Ad hominem, by contrast, is all about the
personbehind the arguments, essential human nature, and the etymology
of a
person's knowledge, prejudices, and understanding. (I am deliberately
excluding outright insults, which never have a place.)

Here's an example:

Someone may say: "I know God exists because I feel his love in my heart". To
which ad hominem is the perfect solution because you're compelled to attack
their upbringing, education, psychological disposition, etc. Ad hominem
gives interesting answers that a logical attack on the statement in
isolation would not give you.

It certainly is derided in some polite philosophical circles. Nietzsche was
a master at it of course, and delighted in attacking everyone from Socrates,
Plato, Darwin, Wagner, Shoepenhaur, Jesus, St. Paul, etc, etc, etc, etc.

I understood you, KC; i apologise that i wasn't clearer in my
response.

What i was suggesting was that unreasoned emotional responses (direct
communicative assaults on personality, character, style, form,
personal beliefs, integrity,...etc) appear to be the human default
interaction mode (why this might be the case is a broad and
fascinating area of behavioural psychology), and appears to be vital
in maintaining the relational identity of Self.

The fact that an individual might feel less inhibited in expressing
the need to maintain this relational identity within a
disintermediated forum does not amount to a qualitative dispositional
shift. On the contary, the forum might enable the expression of "true"
behaviours, as distinct from behaviours subject to the inherent
controls of social convention.

The ability to evaluate the merit or value of an intellectual
proposition is an "acquired" disposition. To argue for or against a
proposition with conviction is a desirable indicator of quality of
character and mind, i agree. Further, the occasional "flame out" has
much value, both for the individuals concerned, as well as for forum
members; we all find occasional releases of emotional energy
cathartic.

It's all in the mix.
