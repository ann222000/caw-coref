<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the discovery that presidential hopeful Barack Obama is descended
">

from white slave owners to the realisation that the majority of black
Americans have European ancestors, a boom in 'recreational genetics'
is forcing America to redefine its roots. Paul Harris pieces together
the DNA jigsaw of what it really means to be born in the USA.

Al Sharpton walked into a South Carolina pine forest just outside the
sleepy southern town of Edgefield and stopped at a cluster of
toothlike unmarked gravestones. This was the former plantation on
which a few generations ago his ancestors had worked, lived, loved and
died, owned as property by white masters. 'You must assume that it's
family here,' Sharpton said, referring to the abandoned slave
graveyard.

A few weeks previously Reverend Sharpton, one of America's most
outspoken black civil rights leaders, had not known of the cemetery's
existence. But researchers had explored his genealogy and broken the
news to him. Sharpton's story had an astonishing twist: the
genealogists discovered that his ancestors had once been owned by the
ancestors of Strom Thurmond, the Senator and former segregationist who
once ran for president on a racist platform. The phrase 'ironic
coincidence' did not begin to cover it.

Dozens of reporters tagged along when Sharpton first visited the
Edgefield woods, yet it was clear he was genuinely stunned by what he
called 'the greatest shock' of his life. 'It profoundly affected him,'
said Tony Burroughs, a genealogist who worked on the project.

Sharpton was not alone. America has embarked on an amazing journey to
explore its own past. Millions of Americans of every creed and colour
are exploring their family histories in a genealogy boom that is
redefining who they are and what it means to be American. The internet
has allowed people to find obscure information at the click of a mouse
that was previously locked away on dusty library shelves. They are
also using modern DNA techniques to research their racial history,
creating a multi-million dollar industry of consumer genetics. Like
Sharpton, many are making shocking discoveries. They are finding
slaves and slave-owners. Far from being a nation of different races,
many are finding they have mixed pasts. Blacks are discovering they
have white blood, whites are finding black relatives. Native Americans
are growing in numbers, not because of a high birth rate, but because
many Americans are discovering unknown native ancestors written in
their DNA.

And it is impacting right up to the highest in the land. Just after
the Sharpton story broke, other genealogists revealed they had
discovered presidential hopeful Barack Obama's family - through his
white mother - had also once owned slaves. Just like the Thurmonds.
That means the man who hopes to become America's first black president
could be the direct descendant not of black slaves, but of white slave-
owners. Literally, nothing is now as black and white as it once
seemed. America has embarked on an identity revolution.

Last year, Professor Peter Fine at Florida Atlantic University had an
idea for an art class. He would gather a group of students to produce
work around their idea of their racial identity. But as part of the
class he asked them to take a DNA test that would break down their
racial background. His bet was that most of the class - of whom the
majority saw themselves as whites of European descent - had no real
idea who they were.

He was right. Of 13 students, only one turned out to be completely
European. The rest displayed a mixture of European, Native American,
African and Asian genes. The one black student turned out to be 21 per
cent white. Fine himself - who admits to looking like a corn-fed
stereotype of a white Midwesterner - discovered he was a quarter
Native American. 'I honestly think these tests could have a large
effect on American consciousness of who we are. If Americans recognise
themselves as a mixed group of people, that could really change
things,' he said.

Fine has a point. For centuries, America has been less a racial
melting pot and more a stew, where different communities bump up
against each other, but keep mostly to themselves. Yet, as millions of
Americans take DNA tests, they are discovering a surprising truth:
America's strict racial lines are, in fact, blurred. One-third of
white Americans, according to some tests, will possess between two and
20 per cent African genes. The majority of black Americans have some
European ancestors.

For a few hundred dollars, Americans can radically alter the way they
think of themselves through a new industry that has been dubbed
'recreational genetics'. Dozens of companies now offer DNA tests,
ranging from the basic - breaking down a person's racial profile into
broad categories such as European or Native American - to more
detailed ones which claim to identify specific regions or tribes of
the world. All a consumer usually has to do is take a swab from inside
their cheek to provide a cell sample and then wait for the post.

It has led to some bizarre developments. One American discovered
Jewish genes in his DNA and is now seeking to get Israeli citizenship.
Some white college applicants, upon discovering they have African or
Asian or Native American DNA, have applied for scholarships aimed at
minorities. A black woman discovered 10 per cent British DNA in her
test and has now identified the Scottish slave owners who used to own
her ancestors. She has contacted their modern descendants - owners of
a large fortune - and wants them to take tests, too.

Some researchers will go to extremes to get samples from others.
People have stalked newly discovered relatives, even going through
rubbish to snatch DNA samples if they refuse to volunteer them. Some
have even plucked hair from newly deceased relatives. For the
celebrity-minded, DNA profiles of descendants of famous historical
figures have been released on the internet, including Thomas
Jefferson, General Robert E Lee, Marie Antoinette and Genghis Khan.
One website plans to add others soon, including DNA profiles of people
related to Columbus and Billy the Kid.

DNA research is having a transforming effect on millions of lives.
That is what happened with Issac Carter, 33, one of Fine's students.
He is black but his family history told of a Native American ancestor,
while his tests showed he was a lot whiter than he thought and had no
Native American blood at all. 'My history has been all jumbled up,' he
said. In fact, the whole world of Native Americans has been thrown
into turmoil. Many tribes, some of whom have become rich on the back
of casino gambling, are now flooded with calls from people suddenly
claiming to have discovered their Native American background.

A country known for its racial faultlines has discovered a new sense
of fluidity. The identities emerging are complex and multi-faceted.
Take another of Fine's students, Shannon O'Brien. Hailing from small-
town Ohio with a name like O'Brien, her identity as a white American
should be secure. But O'Brien's mother is Mexican and she has dark
hair and skin. Many people assume she is Hispanic. Yet she has never
felt any great affinity with a Hispanic identity and speaks no
Spanish. 'People used to tell me that I should change my name to make
it more Hispanic,' she said. But, after her test results came in, she
was identified as 61 per cent European, 26 per cent Native American
and 13 per cent African. Does any racial label quite cover the
complexity of that? 'I have my identity in my own mind,' O'Brien said.
'It is not just what people think when they see me. It is not so
simple any more.'

But the one group for whom DNA tests have really stoked a sense of
turmoil is black Americans. In America's long history of immigration,
they are the people who have no 'old country' to look back to. Slavery
rendered mute any tangible links to Africa beyond having black skin.
It left a cultural legacy that is easy to downplay if you are not a
black American, but hard to overestimate if you are.

Issac Carter's experiences with DNA in Professor Fine's class have
spurred him on to further exploration. He plans to take a more
detailed test that could identify markers in his DNA that hint at
specific regions or tribes in Africa. 'I want to reclaim my history,'
Carter said. 'My wife is Indian. She speaks her native language. She
knows where her family is from. I want to know my history, too.' If
the tests link him to somewhere specific in Africa, Carter intends to
visit and even study the local language. 'We now have the ability to
reconnect,' he added.

He is not alone. Scientists are scouring America and Africa collecting
DNA and trying to find common genetic markers that allow links to be
made between black Americans and African tribes. One of the most
prominent is the Roots Project, run by Boston scientist Dr Bruce
Jackson. He has collected DNA samples from 10,000 black Americans and
is comparing them to DNA excavated from slave burial grounds in
America and back to specific African tribes.

The idea of being able to make such links has a powerful attraction
for even the most high-profile black Americans. Last year a TV show
called African American Lives, hosted by Harvard Professor Henry Louis
Gates Jr, explored the genealogy and DNA of nine black Americans,
including Oprah Winfrey, comedian Chris Tucker and actress Whoopi
Goldberg. It ended up drawing links back to Africa, even taking Tucker
to Angola, from where, the tests seemed to indicate, his ancestors
hailed. The show has had a profound effect on many black Americans,
popularising the tests.

Yet experts say the science is far from perfect. They point out that
beyond a few generations any human is descended from a huge pool of
ancestors. The fact that a great-great-great-great-grandparent was
from Ghana does not make one Ghanaian. The science is also largely
reliant upon statistical analysis and not always exact DNA markers.
Professor Troy Duster, of New York University, calls some DNA
advocates 'pied pipers' for making claims that their science cannot
back up and playing up to a popular feeling that anything involving
genetics is 100 per cent accurate. 'There is a cultural feeling that
DNA evidence is sacrosanct. But a kind of false precision is rampant
right now,' says Duster.

But such a debate only highlights how complex race has become in
America. It is not just a matter of skin colour any more; it is also
about how society perceives you. O'Brien's reflection may scream
Hispanic, but that is not her choice of identity. And Professor Fine
may be a quarter Native American, but he admits his pale complexion
means he will always be seen as white: 'I know I still have all the
privileges of being white in America.'

Greater knowledge can pose troubling questions. While hosting African
American Lives, Professor Gates, one of America's most eminent black
scholars, was stunned to find he was half European. He had more
ancestors in France and Ireland than in Africa. Such discoveries
unsettle even the greatest mind. In the show, Gates lamented what this
meant to a proud black American. 'I have the blues,' he said, and then
asked: 'Can I still have the blues?'

Genealogy is now the second most common hobby in America (after
gardening). Genealogy websites are the second most commonly visited on
the internet (after pornography). It is big business. The ancestry.com
website has a database of five billion records and attracts four
million visitors a month. The biggest player is the Utah-based Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, better known as the Mormons.

The Mormon dominance of the booming genealogy industry is little
known. The church puts a religious duty on its members to search out
their family trees. 'We believe that families are eternal in nature.
Death is not the end of a family relationship. We will see a great
gathering. We will be reunited beyond the veil of death,' said Paul
Nauta, a Mormon spokesman on family history research. The doctrinal
need is simple: Mormons believe the dead can be converted and have
their souls saved. Thus Mormons scour the earth for genealogical
records for any human being, which makes their church the best
resource for millions of people researching their family histories.

The greatest source of genealogical knowledge in the world is the
Family History Library in Salt Lake City, Utah. It is a huge complex
that attracts tens of thousands of visitors every year. But it is just
the centre of a global empire. The Mormons have set up subsidiary
Family History Centers across the world. There are 4,000 in 88
countries, from Sydney to Singapore and London to Lima. They also have
200 camera teams roaming the earth, transferring records on to
microfilm. They take in births, marriages, wills, deaths, property
deeds, legal documents and military records. On any given day there
are Mormon film crews working in 45 countries. For the ambition of the
church is huge: to make all genealogical records of every human life
available on the internet. 'Still less than one per cent of the world
records are accessible on the internet. So far we have just the tip of
the iceberg,' says Nauta.

It is the internet more than anything else that has enabled millions
of Americans to find their family histories, forging links abroad and
giving US citizens, many of whom are self-conscious about their
country's youth, a link to older nations and longer histories. Nauta,
for example, has traced his family back to a village in Italy. Now he
visits every two years. But others make less happy discoveries,
especially around America's greatest historical scar: slavery.

That is where Barack Obama's past came back to haunt him. Obama is
seen as black by most Americans. Yet that skin colour comes from his
Kenyan father, who met his white mother, from Kansas, at college. That
prompted some leading black commentators to claim that Obama is not a
real black American (or not black enough). This, in turn, led a group
of genealogists to trace Obama's mother's family back to before the
Civil War - and they found that some were slave-owners. That is how -
if he wins the 2008 race - America's first ever black president will
be the direct descendant of white slave-owners.

It is, ironically, an experience that many white Americans are having.
In the wake of the Obama news, Chicago journalist Mark Brown asked his
mother about his own background. He had assumed his family, most of
whom hailed from Missouri and Kentucky hill country, had been too poor
to own slaves. Not so. Soon he was looking at dusty documents that
bore the name of his great-great-great-grandfather and also the black
slaves he owned. 'It was a little difficult to process at first. I see
there is a part my family played in this,' Brown said. There was more,
too. One slave was listed as: 'One negro boy named Tom, about 17 years
old, of yellow complexion.' That skin colour most likely meant that
Tom was fathered by a white man. As Tom was owned by Mark Brown's
family, he was probably related to Brown. As would be his modern
descendants. Brown had discovered a personal family link to America's
greatest shame, but also possibly a whole new branch of relatives -
who were black. He now has a choice that is intriguing and agonising.
'People are suggesting I should try to trace the slaves and find them.
But I am worried about opening a can of worms, opening it for a whole
family,' he said.

Of course, it is black Americans who have to face the deepest traumas.
Most blacks joining the genealogy boom expect to find a slave
ancestor. But when it happens the experience can be upsetting. They
must face the reality of descending from chattel slaves, living in
bondage, and being beaten and brutalised at the hands of white
masters. 'These were our ancestors. That is kind of rough to take,'
said genealogist Tony Burroughs. It can also question the whole notion
of black identity in America.

Allen McClain has been researching his family history for 20 years. It
has been difficult, as he rapidly came up against the wall obstructing
all black genealogy: the Civil War. Probing before that often means
looking for ancestors in the wills and property deeds of white
families - ancestors who were legally the property of others, with a
value of a few hundred dollars, listed there alongside pigs, cows and
bushels of corn. McClain, a 42-year-old Air Force veteran who now
lives in Baltimore, traced his family back to rural North Carolina,
where he found his first direct slave ancestor. Martha Eaton was his
great-great-great-grandmother. She was found in the will of a white
slave-owning family, listed alongside the rest of their estate.
McClain felt 'very emotional' looking at these documents. 'This was a
commodity,' he said, his voice growing a little soft. 'I thought, how
could you? This is someone's life.'

But it is not just slavery that confronts black Americans delving into
their past. Emancipation after the Civil War barely began to address
their forefathers' problems. After the war, the South imposed a system
of brutal segregation known as Jim Crow Laws. Blacks were kept as
virtual peons by rural share-cropping, and denied the vote. Obedience
was enforced by lynching.

So when Brooklyn-born Jennifer Stokes began to trace her family into
the South of her parents' birth, she came across the shock of her
family's treatment by their fellow American citizens just 100 or so
years ago. Her family's oral history had long contained an ancestor
who had been lynched in South Carolina. Now she was able to read about
it in an 1895 newspaper. Her great-great-great-uncle, William Stokes,
had been hung and his body riddled with bullets. The 'excuse' for such
a brutal crime was a common one in a South obsessed with its white
manhood. He had been accused of sexually assaulting a white woman.
Throughout the description of his murder, the article referred to
Stokes dismissively as 'Bill'. 'It was very raw. It made it more real.
It's one thing to hear about it and another to read it,' Stokes said.

Making such history personal has spelled out how the full story of
black Americans is still not acknowledged by white America. The common
American vision of settlers and hard-working immigrants still holds
sway in popular culture. Yet it is a version of history that excludes
not only what happened to Native Americans, but also how America's
military and economic might was built on the back of black slaves.
Stokes bristles at the word 'slave' being used to describe her
ancestors. 'They were enslaved. I prefer that word,' she said. 'They
were forced to be slaves. It was a system. It was not who they were.'
She says it again, her voice firm and brooking no discussion: 'They
were enslaved.'

It is no wonder some black Americans emerge from the experience of
looking for their ancestors wondering what their role in America
really is. Lisa Salley is a successful engineer whose work has taken
her all over the world. She has also traced many of her family's roots
to the town of Smoaks and the surrounding countryside in South
Carolina. Now, Lisa is driven by a mission to tell her family story
for the next generation. 'I didn't want my nieces and nephews to
define themselves via MTV,' she said. 'I wanted to preserve our story
before it is lost.' Her work has united disparate strands of family
and she is planning a huge reunion in Smoaks next summer. But she has
found slave ancestors, and mulattos, too - usually the result of rape
by white masters. She has found evidence of her family being split up
on the whims of their white owners. It has left Salley with a sense
that she does not really belong in the land of her birth. 'I have no
intention of retiring in the US. Going other places there was a
general acceptance of me just based on my professional qualifications.
I have never felt that in America,' she said.

But amid all the horror of exploring slavery, there are positive
aspects at play. No matter what colour your skin, the search for an
ancestor pays tribute to a life forgotten: a life every bit as
valuable as anyone else's. For many black Americans, the moment of
discovering a slave ancestor has a sweetness to it. A vindication,
too. 'I call it a genealogy high,' said McClain. 'It makes it all
worth it.'

The great southern writer William Faulkner once wrote: 'The past is
not dead. In fact, it's not even past.' Nothing illustrates that more
in America than the identity revolutions being inspired by genealogy
and DNA research. They show that actions and people hidden in the past
- even to the point of being encoded in someone's genes - can
profoundly shape the present. Even change it. On one hand they can
expose divisions and remind us of the cruelty of history. One
complaint of many blacks researching their family histories is that
white families still often refuse to help them. Native Americans often
complain they are swamped by 'American Indian Princess syndrome',
because every white person wants native DNA in their past. In a world
of minority grants, scholarships and Indian gambling rights, any
debate over DNA and race could easily also become an argument over
resources.

But just as often there are happier moments that show how rigid ideas
of race and identity are beginning to melt in America. Salley had one
of those moments. In researching her family she discovered a slave
ancestor who had children with her white master, Thomas Kinsey. She
then traced the Kinseys to their modern descendants and got in touch.
She met up with an elderly white woman, Myrtle Linder. Though she was
white and Salley was black, the two women were likely distant cousins.
Linder was feisty, still chopping wood in her own backyard despite her
advanced years. Salley recognised the same independent spirit she felt
in herself. 'I thought: &quot;Now these are my people, too,&quot;' she laughed.
And they were. The two women became firm friends. After all, they were
family. Skin colour did not matter. It is individual moments like this
that can slowly change a nation.
