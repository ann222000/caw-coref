I don't remember any dialogue with you.

And people who blather in banal metaphors like "the Light" irritate me.

And "metaphysics" is bad philosophy and worse science, and wasn't even
considered a subject by Aristotle, who coined the term, more or less by
mistake, since the grab-bag of mostly bad questions he barfed up after his

Look, I'm not against religion in general - there are good religious
people in much the same way as there are good non-religious people -
but:

Indiscriminate use of the definite article makes it sound as if things
are rather more fixed than they are.

"The modern mentality"
"The existence"
"The environment"

Uh, there's only one (modern mentality, existence, environment)?
That's something of a surprise to me. I thought the universe was huge
and quite capable of supporting multiple mentalities, existences and
environments, but clearly I was wrong as there's only one of each.

"The contemporary human beings" - makes it sound like he's writing
some kind of future history and Olaf Stapledon is a rather tedious
stylistic model, n'est ce pas?

"All the men" - so the women aren't doing this too - is it a kind of
boy's night out or something?

"Going on like blind ones" - is this a rather fantasy-fiction way of
saying "stumbling around as if we're blind"? Or does he mean that
blind people tend to talk a lot?

"Embracing one another as at random" - well if it's "as at random"
then our embracing each other is like it's random, but not really. So
if it's not really random then what is it and why didn't he just say
that in the first place.

And as for "The Light illuminating all the environment has been
extinguished" - well no it hasn't. OK it's snowing today, but if the
Sun wasn't shining any more I would definitely see a great deal less
than I currently can.

Sorry Dave, but Acrux - who I'm sure has the best of intentions - is
just spouting pseudo-Biblical bollocks.

metaphysics: Metaphysics is the part of philosophy concerned with the
most basic issues, for example, reality, existence, personhood, and
freedom versus determinism. Metaphysics was originally referred to by
Aristotle as "first philosophy."

Very fundamental and abstract issues relating to existence in general
(like the nature of reality and the existence of God) and human
existence in particular (such as free will) are taken up in the part
of philosophy called metaphysics. The ancient Greek philosopher
Aristotle called this branch of philosophy "first philosophy," and
that's a good way to think about it. Metaphysics concentrates on the
first or most fundamental questions we encounter when we begin
studying the most basic issues of life.*

*"Metaphysics" comes from two ancient Greek words, meta "after," and
physika "physics." In light of contemporary usage, where
"metaphysical" usually means "abstract" or "abstruse," you might think
that "metaphysics" takes its name from the fact that it studies highly
abstract issues "beyond the physical realm." While such questions are
"metaphysical," the word is actually a historical accident. The Greek
philosopher Aristotle gave a series of lectures dealing with the most
basic questions in philosophy; as I mentioned, he called this "first
philosophy." The treatise containing these lectures was never given a
title, but after Aristotle's death his students traditionally filed it
after Aristotle's lectures on nature, which the philosopher called
"the physics." Thus, Metaphysics meant something more like "the scroll
filed after The Physics" than "lectures on transcendental questions."
That is why the best way to understand metaphysics is to remember that
Aristotle called it "first philosophy," that is, think of it as the
part of philosophy that asks the "first" or most basic questions.

So far, we've looked at a variety of basic aspects of human life-
freedom, morality, political obligation. But as fundamental as those
topics are, we can get even more basic. In this chapter we get down to
rock bottom as we explore one of the most fundamental issues in
metaphysics-the nature of reality.

Virtually every major thinker tangles with the questions, "What is
real? What is the nature of existence?" Obviously, you must have
answers to such questions before you can build any philosophical
system. And since this book aims to equip you with the intellectual
tools needed to come up with your own answers to philosophical
questions, this chapter introduces you to some basic ways to think
about the nature of reality. We begin with a general discussion about
the problem of understanding reality, then we proceed to the
investigations on this question by the first ancient Greek
philosophers. They were the first group of thinkers to systematically
attack the problem, and their questions, answers, assumptions, and
criticisms of each other are particularly instructive for anyone
gearing up to tackle the issue for the first time, as you are. Thus,
as interesting as this phase of philosophy is from a historical
viewpoint, you should concentrate on the contributions these first
philosophers make in terms of both their methodology and the
legitimacy of the ideas they suggest.

Discovering philosophy / Thomas I. White. --Brief ed.

#####################################

Traditionally, metaphysics refers to the branch of philosophy that
attempts to understand the fundamental nature of all reality, whether
visible or invisible. It seeks a description so basic, so essentially
simple, so all-inclusive that it applies to everything, whether divine
or human or anything else. It attempts to tell what anything must be
like in order to be at all.

To call one a metaphysician in this traditional, philosophical sense
indicates nothing more than his or her interest in attempting to
discover what underlies everything.

http://www.websyte.com/alan/metamul.htm

A metalanguage is still a language, and a meta-theory a theory. Meta-
mathematics is a branch of mathematics. Is metaphysics a branch of
physics? "Meta" in Greek means over, and --- since when you jump over
something you find yourself behind or after it --- it is also
understood as behind and after. The word "metaphysics" is said to
originate from the mere fact that the corresponding part of
Aristotle's work was positioned right after the part called "physics".
But it is not unlikely that the term won a ready acceptance as
denoting this part of philosophy because it conveyed the purpose of
metaphysics, which is to reach beyond nature (physis) as we perceive
it, and to discover the "true nature" of things, their ultimate
essence and the reason for being.

Such a theory would obviously be priceless for judging and
constructing more specific physical theories.

http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/METAPHI.html

This is Aristotle's definition (peri tou ontos ê on) -- Met., VI, 1026
a, 31). In this definition metaphysics is placed in the genus
"science". As a science, it has, in common with other sciences, this
characteristic that it seeks a knowledge of things in their causes.
What is peculiar to metaphysics is the difference "of being as being".

I've been reading some very interesting log accounts of the Maori natives of
New Zealand back when europeans first came across them in their whaling and
science expeditions.  I had known the Maori practiced cannabalism, but not
until you have read some of the 'up close and personal' accounts of exactly
what cannabalism is, does it sink in as to the horror of the practice.

We watch movies today, such as the SAW movies or Tarentino's HOSTEL, and we
may feel a bit sick at the gore, but always with a kind of 'safety' knowing
that such 'worlds' exist only the fantasies of Hollywood producers.

Ah...but then to realize that history shows us human practices that make
such movies pale in comparison.

Evil?  The log entries depict these natives 'disembowling' fellow humans by
the hundreds [mostly fellow warring tribes]...cutting them up, where legs
and arms and torso's would be strewn about, hung up to dry in the sun.
Apparently our buttocks have a lot of fat in them, which they rendered into
oil and coated large steaks to preserve the meat while they dried into jerky
like segments.  Something about the 'left' eyeball that was mystical to
them...where they popped them out and ate raw.  There is no way to describe
the horror in a few sentences here, except to go read yourself of the
accounts.  But this only half the subject of this post.

One modern critique I read suggested that this 'disdain' of such 'cultural
practices' by europeans was a 'kind of colonialism'.  We looked upon such
practice with horror and it did not take long that concerted efforts were
being mounted to stamp out such practice by the horrible europeans and their
vile Christianity [sic].

I find this 'view' that such disdain of cannabalism as something 'in error'
in the 'invading' europeans to polynesian indigenous lands as a profound
example of what is so wrong with liberalism and academia today.  I have
argued some time that objectivism has produced what I term 'super
rationality'...which is really just a positive lean on the idea of
ALIENATION.

Hmm...perhaps we should look at the word 'ALIENATION'.  ALIEN...as in
foreign...not of.  Humanity has an evolutional vector based upon an
emotionality whereupon 'right and wrong' are defined.  It matters little
that the universe see or understand our BIAS to this world, but only that we
recognize it in ourselves as our ONLY rightful pathway as a creature [if we
are to make anything of this world worthwhile to US].  The more we identify
with the universe as a 'viewpoint', the more we alienate ourselves from
'right and wrong' and we invite what otherwise might be considered as 'evil'
[or surely the advocacy of great human suffering whatever we call it] to
become our bedfellows...and thusly, we find we can produce academians who
look down with disdain upon 'invading europeans' who were so horrible as to
'change' the innocent carefree habits of Native Maori away from their time
honored practices of eating one another [and us if we got caught].

Evolutionary progress, the idea that there is a largest-scale trend in
evolution of organisms and that the trend is good

Scientific progress, the idea that science increases its problem
solving ability through the application of some scientific method

Economic progress, history of economy

Social progress, process in which societies or individuals become
better

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress

Social progress is defined as a progress of society, which makes the
society better in the general view of those who cause it. The concept
of social progress was introduced in the early, 19th century social
theories, especially those of social evolutionists like August Comte
and Herbert Spencer. It was present in the Enlightenment's
philosophies of history.

At the time that special interest groups conceived the notion of
social progress, it was considered to be extremely radical. The reason
is that before that time, people viewed the social order as
unchangeable and immutable, often divinely ordained. In other words,
ultimately gods had created the social system, and that system as well
as the place people had in that system was eternal, constant and
permanent (but cyclical, like the seasons). Nothing really changed,
and the more it changed, the more it stayed the same; the emphasis was
on seeing the constant, eternal aspects in human life. This
interpretation of society was very conservative, because even if
change occurred, this was merely a superficial aspect of an underlying
social order which was eternal. In turn, this way of seeing things was
based on a way of life in which very little changed (except
seasonally, as with the weather, or the stages of a man's life).
People stuck to their station in life, not having or expecting the
option or chance of moving out of it to a different station in life.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_progress

Throughout much of history, people acquired rights and
responsibilities through their membership in a group - a family,
indigenous nation, religion, class, community, or state. Most
societies have had traditions similar to the "golden rule" of "Do unto
others as you would have them do unto you." The Hindu Vedas, the
Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, the Bible, the Quran (Koran), and the
Analects of Confucius are five of the oldest written sources which
address questions of people's duties, rights, and responsibilities. In
addition, the Inca and Aztec codes of conduct and justice and an
Iroquois Constitution were Native American sources that existed well
before the 18th century. In fact, all societies, whether in oral or
written tradition, have had systems of propriety and justice as well
as ways of tending to the health and welfare of their members.

http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/edumat/hreduseries/hereandnow/Part-1/sho...

The idea of 'human rights' is not universal - it is essentially the
product of 17th and 18th century European thought. Even the idea of
'rights' does not necessarily exist in every society or advanced
civilisation. Rights are not the same thing as standards of behaviour
punishable or required by rules, which can be fundamentally unfair to
individuals, or used to oppress minority interests.

The earliest rules about standards of behaviour among people dealt
with prescribing or prohibiting conduct that experience proved was
likely to lead to conflict. There were great lawmakers - the Roman,
Justinian, for one, who published his great Codex of various laws in
the early 6th century -who tried to establish a cohesive schemes of
rights and duties. The great religions of the world - Judaism,
Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, and others - have all
sought to establish comprehensive, coherent moral codes of conduct
based on divine law. All contain profound ideas on the dignity of the
human being , and are concerned with the duties and obligations of man
to his fellow human beings, to nature and indeed to God and the whole
of creation.

But until the 17th century such attempts to establish a framework for
such rules, laws and codes, whether in social, legal, secular or
theological debate, emphasised duties and privileges that arose from
peoples' status or relationships, rather than abstract rights that,
philosophically, preceded or underlay those relations or laws.

Then, attention moved from social responsibilities to the individual's
needs and participation. It was seen as fundamental to the well-being
of society, under the influence of philosophers such as Grotius,
Hobbes and Locke, Then, these rights were called 'natural' rights, or
'the rights of man'. These natural or moral rights became part of the
political agenda. They spread as the economic frontiers came down.

One of the first, and most important, battles was about politics.
Could 'natural rights' be handed over to rulers? People in their
'natural' condition have unlimited freedom. If they choose to be
ruled, they surrender either all, or some at least of this 'natural
right' to their king or government, in exchange for civil society and
peace. If they could surrender 'all', then people could be subjected
to absolute government authority, and be under an absolute duty to
obey. If only some could be surrendered, then the question is what
part of those freedoms do we give up?

Human rights is a concept that has been constantly evolving throughout
human history. They been intricately tied to the laws, customs and
religions throughout the ages. One of the first examples of a
codification of laws that contain references to individual rights is
the tablet of Hammurabi. The tablet was created by the Sumerian king
Hammurabi about 4000 years ago. While considered barbaric by today's
standards, the system of 282 laws created a precedent for a legal
system . This kind of precedent and legally binding document protects
the people from arbitrary persecution and punishment. The problems
with Hammurabi's code were mostly due to its cause and effect nature,
it held no protection on more abstract ideas such as race, religion,
beliefs, and individual freedoms.

It was in ancient Greece where the concept of human rights began to
take a greater meaning than the prevention of arbitrary persecution.
Human rights became synonymous with natural rights, rights that spring
from natural law. According to the Greek tradition of Socrates and
Plato, natural law is law that reflects the natural order of the
universe, essentially the will of the gods who control nature. A
classic example of this occurs in Greek literature, when Creon
reproaches Antigone for defying his command to not bury her dead
brother, and she replies that she acted under the laws of the gods.
This idea of natural rights continued

&gt;&gt; I've been reading some very interesting log accounts of the Maori natives
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; New Zealand back when europeans first came across them in their whaling
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; science expeditions.  I had known the Maori practiced cannabalism, but
&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt; until you have read some of the 'up close and personal' accounts of
&gt;&gt; exactly
&gt;&gt; what cannabalism is, does it sink in as to the horror of the practice.

&gt;&gt; We watch movies today, such as the SAW movies or Tarentino's HOSTEL, and
&gt;&gt; we
&gt;&gt; may feel a bit sick at the gore, but always with a kind of 'safety'
&gt;&gt; knowing
&gt;&gt; that such 'worlds' exist only the fantasies of Hollywood producers.

&gt;&gt; Ah...but then to realize that history shows us human practices that make
&gt;&gt; such movies pale in comparison.

&gt;&gt; Evil?  The log entries depict these natives 'disembowling' fellow humans
&gt;&gt; by
&gt;&gt; the hundreds [mostly fellow warring tribes]...cutting them up, where legs
&gt;&gt; and arms and torso's would be strewn about, hung up to dry in the sun.
&gt;&gt; Apparently our buttocks have a lot of fat in them, which they rendered
&gt;&gt; into
&gt;&gt; oil and coated large steaks to preserve the meat while they dried into
&gt;&gt; jerky
&gt;&gt; like segments.  Something about the 'left' eyeball that was mystical to
&gt;&gt; them...where they popped them out and ate raw.  There is no way to
&gt;&gt; describe
&gt;&gt; the horror in a few sentences here, except to go read yourself of the
&gt;&gt; accounts.  But this only half the subject of this post.

&gt;&gt; One modern critique I read suggested that this 'disdain' of such
&gt;&gt; 'cultural
&gt;&gt; practices' by europeans was a 'kind of colonialism'.  We looked upon such
&gt;&gt; practice with horror and it did not take long that concerted efforts were
&gt;&gt; being mounted to stamp out such practice by the horrible europeans and
&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt; vile Christianity [sic].

&gt; Social progress, process in which societies or individuals become
&gt; better

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress

&gt; Social progress is defined as a progress of society, which makes the
&gt; society better in the general view of those who cause it. The concept
&gt; of social progress was introduced in the early, 19th century social
&gt; theories, especially those of social evolutionists like August Comte
&gt; and Herbert Spencer. It was present in the Enlightenment's
&gt; philosophies of history.

&gt; At the time that special interest groups conceived the notion of
&gt; social progress, it was considered to be extremely radical. The reason
&gt; is that before that time, people viewed the social order as
&gt; unchangeable and immutable, often divinely ordained. In other words,
&gt; ultimately gods had created the social system, and that system as well
&gt; as the place people had in that system was eternal, constant and
&gt; permanent (but cyclical, like the seasons). Nothing really changed,
&gt; and the more it changed, the more it stayed the same; the emphasis was
&gt; on seeing the constant, eternal aspects in human life. This
&gt; interpretation of society was very conservative, because even if
&gt; change occurred, this was merely a superficial aspect of an underlying
&gt; social order which was eternal. In turn, this way of seeing things was
&gt; based on a way of life in which very little changed (except
&gt; seasonally, as with the weather, or the stages of a man's life).
&gt; People stuck to their station in life, not having or expecting the
&gt; option or chance of moving out of it to a different station in life.

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_progress

&gt; Throughout much of history, people acquired rights and
&gt; responsibilities through their membership in a group - a family,
&gt; indigenous nation, religion, class, community, or state. Most
&gt; societies have had traditions similar to the &quot;golden rule&quot; of &quot;Do unto
&gt; others as you would have them do unto you.&quot; The Hindu Vedas, the
&gt; Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, the Bible, the Quran (Koran), and the
&gt; Analects of Confucius are five of the oldest written sources which
&gt; address questions of people's duties, rights, and responsibilities. In
&gt; addition, the Inca and Aztec codes of conduct and justice and an
&gt; Iroquois Constitution were Native American sources that existed well
&gt; before the 18th century. In fact, all societies, whether in oral or
&gt; written tradition, have had systems of propriety and justice as well
&gt; as ways of tending to the health and welfare of their members.

&gt; The idea of 'human rights' is not universal - it is essentially the
&gt; product of 17th and 18th century European thought. Even the idea of
&gt; 'rights' does not necessarily exist in every society or advanced
&gt; civilisation. Rights are not the same thing as standards of behaviour
&gt; punishable or required by rules, which can be fundamentally unfair to
&gt; individuals, or used to oppress minority interests.

&gt; The earliest rules about standards of behaviour among people dealt
&gt; with prescribing or prohibiting conduct that experience proved was
&gt; likely to lead to conflict. There were great lawmakers - the Roman,
&gt; Justinian, for one, who published his great Codex of various laws in
&gt; the early 6th century -who tried to establish a cohesive schemes of
&gt; rights and duties. The great religions of the world - Judaism,
&gt; Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, and others - have all
&gt; sought to establish comprehensive, coherent moral codes of conduct
&gt; based on divine law. All contain profound ideas on the dignity of the
&gt; human being , and are concerned with the duties and obligations of man
&gt; to his fellow human beings, to nature and indeed to God and the whole
&gt; of creation.

&gt; But until the 17th century such attempts to establish a framework for
&gt; such rules, laws and codes, whether in social, legal, secular or

&gt; Ha...we are talking about cannabalism here [as a cultural practice, not the

&gt; simply some things so horrible to us that no degree of 'reason' can disavow

What if these moral neurological structures were merely adaptions to a
paleolithic hunter/gatherer reality? That way we can have fMRI
evidence for these moral structures in action without the necessity of
eith God or Evolution. Time rolls on and progress continues, old
arguments are stripped naked. Well maybe that goes to far.

-----------------------------

Innate censors and motivators exist in the brain that deeply and
unconsciously affect our ethical premises; from these roots, morality
evolved as instinct. If that perception is correct, science may soon
be in a position to investigate the very origin and meaning of human
values, from which all ethical pronouncements and much of political
practice flow.

Philosophers themselves, most of whom lack an evolutionary
perspective, have not devoted much time to the problem. They examine
the precepts of ethical systems with reference to their consequences
and not their origins. Like everyone else, philosophers measure their
personal emotional responses to various alternatives as though
consulting a hidden oracle.

That oracle resides in the deep emotional centers of the brain, most
probably within the limbic system, a complex array of neurons and
hormone-secreting cells located just beneath the "thinking" portion of
the cerebral cortex. Human emotional responses and the more general
ethical practices based on them have been programmed to a substantial
degree by natural selection over thousands of generations...

...Which of the censors and motivators should be obeyed and which ones
might be better curtailed or sublimated? These guides are the very
core of humanity...To chart our destiny means that we must shift from
automatic control based on our biological properties to precise
steering based on biological knowledge.

...A society that chooses to ignore the existence of the innate
epigenetic rules will nevertheless continue to navigate by them and at
each moment of decision yield to their dictates by default. Economic
policy, moral tenets, the practices of child rearing, and alomost
every other social activity will be guided by inner feelings whose
origins are beyond comprehension. Such a society cannot effectively
challenge the ancient hereditary oracle dwelling within the epigenetic
rules. It will continue to live by the "conscience" of its members and
by "God's will." Such an archaic procedure just might, by, fantastic
good fortune, lead in the most direct and untroubled manner to a
stable and wholly benevolent world. More likely, it will perpetuate
conflict, and continue to drag humanity relentlessly along what is at
best a tortuous and agonizing path.

On the other hand, the deep scientific study of the innate epigenetic
rules will call the oracle to account and translate its commands into
precise language that can be understood and debated. People who know
human nature in this way are more likely to agree on universal goals
within the constraints of that nature and recognize absolute ethical
truths, if such can be shown to exist.
