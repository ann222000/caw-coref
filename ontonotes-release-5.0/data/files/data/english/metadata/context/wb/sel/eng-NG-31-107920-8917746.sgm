Gut feeling sayd he won't and LH will. I agree it's close but LH seems to be
quite in charge of his emotions whereas FA seems to lose it... One error in
difficult circumstances means nothing. They all make errors here and there.
LH has made astonishingly few for a seasoned driver let alone a rookie!

Been sayin Alonso will win all year. At some point that experience
must kick in to play. However, I dont think anyone seriously thought
Kimi would be in the hunt by the last race, and if Alonso and
Hamilton............

I dont think Mclaren will regret anything. Hamilton has far exceeded
expectation, and with luck they'll have the cheapest No1 driver for
years. Im not even sure that in the long term they'll regret hiring
Alonso. He certainly helped prove Hamilton's worth.

More to the point, Hamilton can only loose the WDC, while Alonso can
only win it. There for Alonso should be more relaxed.

If I were to place my oh so huge 50p bet, it would be on Alonso.

Yeah but if Alonso wins he's tainted, if he loses he's tainted and
derided, but if Hamilton wins he's the second coming, if he loses he's
still the rookie who spanked the world champion up and down the
pitlane..  So Alonso is in a lose-lose whereas hamilton is in a win-win.

I hear ya, but.....

Not sure Alonso and his fans will see it that way.

Even if one hates Alonso and lurves Hamilton, we all have to conceed
that its been a bloody awfull year for Alonso too. Sure some / a lot
of its his own making, but its still been tough. To win in a team that
must now hate him, and against a supprise very fast team mate is a
feat in its self. I dont like the guy one little bit, but if he does
win, he would deserve a fair amount of (very grudging) respect.

I've also felt that recently, but it's never quite clear what
advantages he's gained, after all Hamilton's been twice dragged into
disciplinary hearings just before crucial parts of the season.  The
police visit on the morning of a race in Italy was pure theatrics
designed to put the frightners on the team, whether Alonso would bear
that better than Hamilton I'm not sure, but the bulk of the off-track
pressure intruding into the game has been against hamilton and helped
Alonso.  Also in another team he really would be finding monkey
wrenches in the cockpit or three tyres on his car so he's reaping the
benefit of an honest team which he hasn't deserved, so again he's
picked up an &quot;advantage&quot; of sorts there.  It's a balancing act but I
feel he's had the cards fall more in his favour than Hamilton has
despite his best efforts to fuck it all up.

I suppose historically LH is breaking the mould (not the green stuff); so
don't expect this statistic to hold up for much. I think he sees it the
other way; there are two behind him who will have to do much better than him
in different degrees to win; so far he has done better than both of them -
hence his lead. A 1st or 2nd place would mean he's WDC. 3rd, 4th and 5th
places will likely not be too bad either - depending on KR (with Massa to
help hopefully not nasty) and FA. Whatever, it's certainly going to be an
interesting fianale. BE could not have engineered it better.

Ron still has many ways of pissing in Alonso's puddle, unless Lewis has no
chance of winning the WDC and the only way to stop Kimi winning is for
Alonso to finish then I don't think he has a prayer. Even Bernie wants Lewis
to win so I don't think a software glitch or a problem during a pitstop
would matter, Lewis only has Kimi to worry about, and I think he is shrewd
enough to realise that.

means he would have to take a massive pay cut to go anywhere else,
apart from, er, Toyota.

After the last race he says everything will be equal from Mclaren.
This seems to be how he works. He made unforced errors earlier in the
season and called them bad luck.

Equality in the team and his own success seem to go hand in hand. OTOH
how would Schumacher have coped with this.

Alonso has also said Hamilton would be a worthy champion.

Disingenuous?

As James Allen has pointed out, the reaction to Schumacher and
Hamilton from the pit-lane has been next-to identical. A sport cannot
destroy its best competitors in too many areas and survive.

&gt; &gt; Yeah but if Alonso wins he's tainted, if he loses he's tainted and
&gt; &gt; derided, but if Hamilton wins he's the second coming, if he loses
&gt; &gt; he's still the rookie who spanked the world champion up and down the
&gt; &gt; pitlane..  So Alonso is in a lose-lose whereas hamilton is in a
&gt; &gt; win-win.

&gt; No matter what - Hamilton is a disengenuous little prat.

You do rather less well and not only is there no reason for you not to
be frank and honest but you don't have a hundred journalists trying to
trip you up or twist your words.

You might as well say &quot;Nah, nah, na-nah, nah&quot; for all the sense you
make lately.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Just a gut feeling but I think Alonso will win the WDC and Macca
&gt;&gt; &gt; will
&gt;&gt; &gt; regret Hamilton's cock up in China for a long time.....

&gt;&gt; Been sayin Alonso will win all year. At some point that experience
&gt;&gt; must kick in to play. However, I dont think anyone seriously
&gt;&gt; thought
&gt;&gt; Kimi would be in the hunt by the last race, and if Alonso and
&gt;&gt; Hamilton............

&gt;&gt; I dont think Mclaren will regret anything. Hamilton has far
&gt;&gt; exceeded
&gt;&gt; expectation, and with luck they'll have the cheapest No1 driver for
&gt;&gt; years. Im not even sure that in the long term they'll regret hiring
&gt;&gt; Alonso. He certainly helped prove Hamilton's worth.

&gt; And if he wins the championship, he'll stay. Given Mclaren signed
&gt; him
&gt; for 3 years they would presumably be quite happy. Paying for Alonso
&gt; twice is beyond most other teams and he's not going to Ferrari,
&gt; which
&gt; means he would have to take a massive pay cut to go anywhere else,
&gt; apart from, er, Toyota.

I dunno. I felt a wile ago that he would end up staying. But that was
during a 'quiet' period, where he seemed to shut up and drive. But
then he started up again, which isnt wise if he is going to stay. Of
course, if they leave negociation for a month or two, feelings might
mellow.

And this is where he failed big time. He over drove instead of being
patient. He then got paranoid. I think, looking back in a few years
time, Alonso may have a few regrets, regardless of wether or not he
wins this year. He must know he could of handled things far better.

Yeah, I wonder. My guess is that Schumacher has a stronger personality
that Alonso. And might have been quicker, faster. I also think he
might not have made the driving mistake Alonso did, so he would have
been under less pressure, points wise. Dunno. Would have been
interesting.

I hope he believes that.

But he doesn't want equality. He wants to be the favoured number one.

Schumacher made many mistakes under pressure too. At his peak, he may
well have been &quot;quicker, faster&quot; but, even then, I think Hamilton
would have been difficult for him to cope with. And if he'd had any
idea of how good Hamilton is, he'd never have been in the same team...

Did you not hear the teeth grinding together when he said it...?
