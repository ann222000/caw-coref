Here's some of the violent quotes from the Koran, the words of Satan
(aka Allah):

O Prophet! Make war on the unbelievers and the hypocrites. Be harsh
with them. Their ultimate abode is hell, a hapless journey's end. -
9:73

O believers, take not Jews and Christians as friends; they are friends
of each other. Those of you who make them his friends is one of them.
God does not guide an unjust people. - 5:54

Allah will humble the unbelievers. Allah and His apostle are free from
obligations to idol-worshipers. Proclaim a woeful punishment to the
unbelievers. - 9:2-3

When the sacred months are over, slay the idolaters wherever you find
them. Arrest them, besiege them, and lie in ambush everywhere for
them. - 9:5

Whether unarmed or well-equipped, march on and fight for the cause of
Allah, with your wealth and your persons. - 9:41

Muhammad is Allah's apostle. Those who follow him are ruthless to the
unbelievers but merciful to one another. Through them, Allah seeks to
enrage the unbelievers. - 48:29

Some violent quotes from Christianity's book of murder, the Bible

Genesis

# Because God liked Abel's animal sacrifice more than Cain's vegetables,
Cain kills his brother Abel in a fit of religious jealousy. 4:8

# God is angry. He decides to destroy all humans, beasts, creeping
things, fowls, and &quot;all flesh wherein there is breath of life.&quot; He plans
to drown them all. 6:7, 17

# God repeats his intention to kill &quot;every living substance ... from off
the face of the earth.&quot; But why does God kill all the innocent animals?
What had they done to deserve his wrath? It seems God never gets his
fill of tormenting animals. 7:4

# God drowns everything that breathes air. From newborn babies to koala
bears -- all creatures great and small, the Lord God drowned them all.
7:21-23

# God tells Abram to kill some animals for him. The needless slaughter
makes God feel better. 15:9-10

# Hagar conceives, making Sarai jealous. Abram tells Sarai to do to
Hagar whatever she wants. &quot;And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she
fled.&quot; 16:6

# Lot refuses to give up his angels to the perverted mob, offering his
two &quot;virgin daughters&quot; instead. He tells the bunch of angel rapers to
&quot;do unto them [his daughters] as is good in your eyes.&quot; This is the same
man that is called &quot;just&quot; and &quot;righteous&quot; in 2 Peter 2:7-8. 19:7-8

# God kills everyone (men, women, children, infants, newborns) in Sodom
and Gomorrah by raining &quot;fire and brimstone from the Lord out of
heaven.&quot; Well, almost everyone -- he spares the &quot;just and righteous&quot; Lot
and his family. 19:24

# Lot's nameless wife looks back, and God turns her into a pillar of
salt. 19:26

# God threatens to kill Abimelech and his people for believing Abe's
lie. 20:3-7

# Sarai tells Abraham to &quot;cast out this bondwoman and her son.&quot; God
commands him to &quot;hearken unto her voice.&quot; So Abraham abandons Hagar and
Ishmael, casting them out into the wilderness to die. 21:10-14

# God orders Abraham to kill Isaac as a burnt offering. Abraham shows
his love for God by his willingness to murder his son. But finally, just
before Isaac's throat is slit, God provides a goat to kill instead. 22:2-13

# Abraham shows his willingness to kill his son for God. Only an evil
God would ask a father to do that; only a bad father would be willing to
do it. 22:10

# Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, is &quot;defiled&quot; by a man who seems to love
her dearly. Her brothers trick all of the men of the town and kill them
(after first having them all circumcised), and then take their wives and
children captive. 34:1-31

# &quot;The terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them.&quot; 35:5

# &quot;And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and
the Lord slew him.&quot; What did Er do to elicit God's wrath? The Bible
doesn't say. Maybe he picked up some sticks on Saturday. 38:7

# After God killed Er, Judah tells Onan to &quot;go in unto they brother's
wife.&quot; But &quot;Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and ... when he
went in unto his brother's wife ... he spilled it on the ground.... And
the thing which he did displeased the Lord; wherefore he slew him also.&quot;
This lovely Bible story is seldom read in Sunday School, but it is the
basis of many Christian doctrines, including the condemnation of both
masturbation and birth control. 38:8-10

# After Judah pays Tamar for her services, he is told that she &quot;played
the harlot&quot; and &quot;is with child by whoredom.&quot; When Judah hears this, he
says, &quot;Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.&quot; 38:24

# Joseph interprets the baker's dream. He says that the pharaoh will cut
off the baker's head, and hang his headless body on a tree for the birds
to eat. 40:19

Exodus

# Moses murders an Egyptian after making sure that no one is looking.

# God threatens to kill the Pharaoh's firstborn son. 4:23

# God decides to kill Moses because his son had not yet been
circumcised. 4:24-26

can kill Egyptians with his armies. 7:4

so cruel and unjust? 7:5, 17

# God tells Moses and Aaron to smite the river and turn it into blood.
7:17-24

# The fifth plague: all cattle in Egypt die. 9:2-6

# &quot;For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and
upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there
is none like me in all the earth.&quot; Who else but the biblical god could
be so cruel? 9:14

# The seventh plague is hail. &quot;And the hail smote throughout the land of
Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast.&quot; 9:22-25

# These verses clearly show that the mass murder of innocent children by
God was premeditated. 11:4-6 (see 12:29-30)

# God will kill the Egyptian children to show that he puts &quot;a difference
between the Egyptians and Israel.&quot; 11:7

# God explains to Moses that he intends to &quot;smite all the firstborn in
the land of Egypt, both man and beast. 12:12

# After God has sufficiently hardened the Pharaoh's heart, he kills all
the firstborn Egyptian children. When he was finished &quot;there was not a
house where there was not one dead.&quot; Finally, he runs out of little
babies to kill, so he slaughters the firstborn cattle, too. 12:29

# To commemorate the divine massacre of the Egyptian children, Moses
instructs the Israelites to &quot;sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the
matrix&quot; -- all the males, that is. God has no use for dead, burnt female
bodies. 13:2, 12, 15

army in the sea 14:4-28

# Like the great and powerful Wizard of Oz, nobody can see God and live.
19:21

# God gives instructions for killing and burning animals. He says that
if we will make such &quot;burnt offerings,&quot; he will bless us for it. What
kind of mind would be pleased by the killing and burning of innocent
animals? 20:24

# A child who hits or curses his parents must be executed. 21:15, 17

# An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. 21:24-25

ox shall be stoned, and his owner shall be put to death.&quot;. 21:29

# If an ox gores a slave, the owner of the ox must pay the owner of the
slave 30 shekels of silver, and &quot;the ox shall be stoned.&quot; 21:32

# &quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&quot; Thousands of innocent women
have suffered excruciating deaths because of this verse. 22:18

# &quot;Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.&quot; Is it
really necessary to kill such people? Couldn't we just send them to
counseling or something? 22:19

# &quot;He who sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be
utterly destroyed.&quot; If this commandment is obeyed, then the four billion
people who do not believe in the biblical god must be killed. 22:20

# If you make God angry enough, he will kill you and your family with
his own sword. 22:24

# &quot;The firstborn of thy sons thou shalt give unto me.&quot; (As a burnt
offering?) 22:29

# God promises to &quot;send his fear before the Israelites&quot; and to kill
everyone that they encounter when they enter the promised land. 23:27

# Moses has some animals killed and their dead bodies burned for God.
Then he sprinkles their blood on the altar and on the people. This makes
God happy. 24:5-8

# Get some animals, kill them, chop up their bodies, wave body parts in
the air, burn the carcasses, and sprinkle the blood all around -- in
precisely the way God tells you. It may well make you sick, but it makes
God feel good. 29:11-37

How about the two lambs you are supposed to offer each day? 29:36-39

people.&quot; 30:33

&quot;consume them. 32:10

their tribe that were &quot;on the Lord's side&quot;) to kill &quot;every man his
neighbor.&quot; &quot;And there fell of the people that day about 3000 men.&quot; 32:27-28

# But God wasn't satisfied with the slaughter of the 3000, so he killed
some more people with a plague. 32:35

the glory of God. 34:20

# Whoever works, or even kindles a fire, on the Sabbath &quot;shall be put to
death.&quot; 35:2-3
Leviticus

# God gives detailed instructions for performing ritualistic animal
sacrifices. such bloody rituals must be important to God, judging from
the number of times that he repeats their instructions. Indeed the
entire first nine chapters of Leviticus can be summarized as follows:
Get an animal, kill it, sprinkle the blood around, cut the dead animal
into pieces, and burn it for a &quot;sweet savor unto the Lord.&quot; Chapters 1 - 9

# &quot;Flay the burnt offering; cut it into pieces.&quot; 1:6

seven times before the Lord.&quot; 4:6, 4:17

# &quot;The bullock shall be killed before the Lord.&quot; 4:14

# &quot;Kill it and pour out the blood.&quot; 4:24-25

a sweet savour unto the Lord.&quot; 4:29-31

# Slay it for a sin offering, put the blood on your finger, and pour out
the blood at the bottom of the altar. 4:33-34

# Wringing off the heads of pigeons for God. 5:8-9

# Kill the sin offering before the Lord. &quot;It is most holy.&quot; 6:25

# The holy law of trespass offering: Find an animal; kill it; sprinkle
the blood around; offer God the fat, rump, kidneys, and caul; burn and
eat it in the holy place, for &quot;it is most holy.&quot; 7:1-6

# The priest must sprinkle the blood of the peace offerings. 7:14

or blood -- these are for God. (And he doesn't like to share!) 7:18-27

# God gives instructions for &quot;wave offerings&quot; and &quot;heave offerings.&quot; He
says these offerings are to be made perpetually &quot;by a statute for ever.&quot;
Have you made your heave offering today? 7:30-36

# Moses does it all for God. First he kills an animal; wipes the blood
on Aaron's ears, thumbs, and big toes. Then he sprinkles blood round
about and waves the guts before the Lord. Finally he burns the whole
mess for &quot;a sweet savour before the Lord.&quot; 8:14-32

# More killing, sprinkling of blood, waiving animal parts, and burning
carcasses &quot;before the Lord.&quot; 9:2-21

offering before the Lord. 9:8-21

&quot;there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died
before the Lord.&quot; 10:1-3

&quot;all the people.&quot; 10:6-9

# After a woman gives birth, a priest must kill a lamb, pigeon, or dove
as a sin offering. This is because having children is sinful and God
likes it when things are killed for him. 12:6-8

# God's law for lepers: Get two birds. Kill one. Dip the live bird in
the blood of the dead one. Sprinkle the blood on the leper seven times,
and then let the blood-soaked bird fly off. Next find a lamb and kill
it. Wipe some of its blood on the patient's right ear, thumb, and big
toe. Sprinkle seven times with oil and wipe some of the oil on his right
ear, thumb and big toe. Repeat. Finally kill a couple doves and offer
one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. 14:2-32

Some violent quotes from Christianity's book of murder, the Bible

Numbers

# God shows his hospitality with the admonition: &quot;The stranger that
cometh nigh shall be put to death.&quot; 1:51, 3:10, 3:38

# Two of Aaron's sons are killed by God for &quot;offering strange fire
before the Lord.&quot; 3:4

# Don't touch or &quot;go in to see when the holy things are covered.&quot; God
kills people who touch or look at covered holy things. 4:15, 20

# God tells the people to expel from camp &quot;every leper, every one that
hath an issue, and whoever is defiled by the dead.&quot; So by God's
instructions, the sick are abandoned and left to suffer and die alone. 5:1-4

# &quot;And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord: and the Lord
heard it.&quot; (He had his hearing aid on.) He then burned the complainers
alive. That'll teach them. 11:1

# &quot;And wile the flesh [of the quails] was yet between their teeth, ere
it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and
the Lord smote the people with a very great plague. &quot;The Bible isn't too
clear about what these poor folks did to upset God so much; all it says
is that they had &quot;lusted.&quot; 11:33

# Miriam and Aaron (Moses' brother and sister) criticize Moses for
marrying an Ethiopian woman and thus breaking the law of God. But God
makes it clear that his rules don't apply to his favorites, and he
strikes Miriam with leprosy. Notice that only Miriam is punished, though
both she and Aaron complained. 12:1, 9-10

# More plagues and pestilence sent by God. God repeats one of his
favorite promises: &quot;your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness.&quot;
14:12, 29, 14:32-37

# God punishes the children for the failings of their great-great
grandfathers. 14:18

# God killed those that murmured against him with a plague. 14:36-37

# God gives more instructions for the ritualistic killing of animals.
The smell of burning flesh is &quot;a sweet savour unto the Lord.&quot; 15:3,
13-14, 24

# The Israelites find a man picking up sticks on the sabbath. God
commands them to kill him by throwing rocks at him. 15:32-36

# Because of a dispute between Korah and Moses, God has the ground open
up and swallow Korah, Dathan, and Abiram &quot;and their wives, and their
sons, and their little children.&quot; Then, just for the hell of it, God has
a fire burn to death 250 &quot;men that offered incense.&quot; 16:20-35

# After God killed Korah, his family, and 250 innocent bystanders, the
people complained saying, &quot;ye have killed the people of the Lord.&quot; So
God, who doesn't take kindly to criticism, sends a plague on the people.
And &quot;they that died in the plague were 14,700.&quot; 16:41-50

# God threatens to kill those who murmur. To which the people reply,
&quot;Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish .... Shall we be consumed with
dying?&quot; 17:12-13

# Stay away from holy things and places -- like churches. God might have
to kill you if you get too close.18:3, 22, 32

# God shows us how to make new friends by saying : &quot;The stranger that
cometh nigh shall be put to death.&quot; 18:7

# God describes once again the procedure for ritualistic animal
sacrifices. such rituals must be extremely important to God, since he
makes their performance a &quot;statute&quot; and &quot;covenant&quot; forever. 18:17-19

# The purification of the unclean. These absurd rituals, cruel
sacrifices, and unjust punishments are vitally important to God. They
are to be &quot;a perpetual statute&quot; for all humankind. 19:1-22

# &quot;And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the
Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities.&quot; This
verse demonstrates the power of prayer: If you ask God, he will destroy
entire cities for you. 21:3

# God sends &quot;fiery serpents&quot; to bite his chosen people, and many of them
die. 21:6

# God delivers the Amorites into Moses' hands. (You're in God hands with
Moses.) So Moses does the usual thing, killing everyone &quot;until their was
none left alive.&quot; 21:34-35

# God's people will kill like a lion and then &quot;drink the blood of the
slain.&quot; 23:24

# God, who is as strong as a unicorn, will eat up the nations, break
their bones, and then pierce them through with his arrows. What a guy! 24:8

# After the people &quot;commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab,&quot; Moses
has them all killed. Then God tells Moses to hang their dead bodies up
in front of him; God says that this will satisfy him. 25:1-5

# When one of the Israelite men brings home a foreign woman, &quot;Phinehas
(Aaron's grandson) sees them and throws a spear &quot;through the man .. and
the woman through her belly.&quot; This act pleases God so much that &quot;the
plague was stayed from the children of Israel.&quot; But not before 24,000
had died. 25:6-9

# For impaling the interracial couple, God rewards Phinehas and his sons
with the everlasting priesthood. 25:10-13

# God tells Moses how to care for his neighbors by saying: &quot;Vex the
Midianites, and smite them.&quot; 25:16-17

# The ground swallow Korah and his companions and a fire consumes 250
men. 26:10

# &quot;And Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before the
Lord.&quot; When you go camping avoid making any unusual fires. 26:61

# In these chapters, God provides ridiculously detailed instructions for
the ritualistic sacrifice of animals. The burning of their dead bodies
smells great to God. Eleven times in these two chapters God says that
they are to him a &quot;sweet savour.&quot; 28 - 29

# Under God's direction, Moses' army defeats the Midianites. They kill
all the adult males, but take the women and children captive. When Moses
learns that they left some live, he angrily says: &quot;Have you saved all
the women alive? Kill every male among the little ones, and kill every
woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children,
that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.&quot;
So they went back and did as Moses (and presumably God) instructed,
killing everyone except for the virgins. In this way they got 32,000
virgins -- Wow! (Even God gets some of the booty -- including the
virgins.) 31:1-54

# God killed all the Egyptian firstborn. 33:4

# God tells Moses to exterminate the residents of Canaan and destroy all
of their religious symbols and possessions. 33:50-52

# But if the Israelites don't kill them all, then God will make them
pricks in their eyes and thorns in their sides. And he will do unto the
Israelites as he planned to do to the inhabitants of Canaan. 33:55-56

# &quot;The revenger of blood&quot; must murder the murderer just as soon as he
sees him. 35:19, 21

# When a murder is committed the blood pollutes the land. The only way
to cleanse it is to spill more blood by killing the killer. 35:30, 33

Some violent quotes from Christianity's book of murder, the Bible

Joshua

# &quot;And the city shall be accursed ... and all that therein, to the Lord:
only Rahab the harlot shall live.&quot; God explains that Rahab is to be
spared since she hid Joshua's spies and lied to those who were searching
for them (2:4-5). But why was everyone else killed? Some of them were
probably liars too. 6:17

# &quot;And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and
woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the
sword.&quot; 6:21

# After killing everyone, &quot;they burnt the city with fire, and all that
was therein.&quot; Only the valuables (silver, gold, brass, and iron) did
they keep to &quot;put into the treasury of the house of the Lord.&quot; 6:24

# Joshua says that those who try to rebuild Jericho will be accursed by
God, and will have to sacrifice both their oldest and their youngest
sons in its construction. Well, Jericho still exists today, and is often
considered to be the world's oldest, continuously occupied city. 6:26

# God tells Joshua to kill whoever tood &quot;the accursed thing.&quot; 7:10-12

# If you happen to see &quot;the accursed thing,&quot; don't touch it. If you do,
you, your family, and all of your animals must be burned. 7:15

# &quot;And Joshua ... took Achan ... and his sons, and his daughters, and
his oxen, and his sheep... And all of Israel stoned them with stones,
and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.&quot; This
is because Achan &quot;took of the accursed thing&quot; -- whatever that means.
But why would God require that Achan's sons and daughters (and even his
animals) be stoned to death along with him? The Bible doesn't say. But
it does tell us that &quot;the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger&quot;
when Achan, his children, and his animals were stoned to death and their
dead bodies burned. 7:24-26

# &quot;When ye have taken the city [Ai] ... ye shall set the city on fire:
according to the commandment of the LORD. 8:8

# Joshua and his army, per God's instructions, slaughter &quot;all the
inhabitants of Ai.&quot; 8:22-26

# Joshua hangs the king of Ai on a tree until evening. 8:29

# After Joshua kills all the inhabitants of Ai, burns their city, and
hangs their king on a tree, he kills some animals and burns them as a
&quot;peace offering&quot; to his warlike God. 8:31

# God curses the Gibeonites to be slaves of the Jews forever. 9:21-27

# God slaughters the Amorites and even chases them &quot;along the way&quot; as
they try to escape. Then he sends down huge hailstones and kills even
more of them. 10:10-11

# In a divine type of daylight savings time, God makes the sun stand
still so that Joshua can get all his killing done before dark. 10:12-13

# God tells Joshua to &quot;pursue after your enemies and smite the hindmost
of them.&quot; (Kick their butts.) Don't let any of them escape &quot;for the Lord
your God hath delivered them into your hand.&quot; 10:19

# Joshua tells his captains to &quot;put your feet upon the necks of these
kings.&quot; He says, &quot;thus shall the Lord do to all of your enemies.&quot; Then
Joshua kills the kings and hangs them on trees. 10:24-26

# Joshua, at God's command, kills everyone and everything that he can
find (including babies and little children)-- or, as the Bible puts it,
he &quot;utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord commanded.&quot; 10:28-32

# God delivers the Hazorites into Joshua's hand, and he knows just what
to do with them: he smites them all with (you guessed it) the edge of
the sword until &quot;there was not any left to breathe.&quot; 11:6-17

# &quot;And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their
horses.&quot; 11:9

# &quot;For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come
against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly.&quot; Notice
that God hardens their hearts so that he can have an excuse to kill
them. 11:20

# Caleb offers to give his daughter to whoever conquers the city of
Debir. Caleb's nephew wins the contest and is given his cousin for a
prize. 15:16-17

# &quot;Did not Achan son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing,
and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel?&quot; To find out see
Joshua 7:1-26. 22:20

# God is jealous and will never forgive you for your sins. &quot;He will turn
and do you hurt, and consume you.&quot; 24:19-20

Some violent quotes from Christianity's book of murder, the Bible

Judges

# God appoints Judah to succeed Joshua. The Lord delivers his foes into

Adonibezek and &quot;cut off his thumbs and great toes.&quot; Nice guys. 1:2-6

destroyed it ... And the Lord was with Judah.&quot; (You can tell by the
number of innocent people he killed.) 1:17, 19

# The Israelite spies killed everyone in Bethel, except for the man (and
his family) who showed them how to enter the city. 1:25

# Ehud delivers a &quot;message from God&quot; to the king of Moab. God's message
consists of a knife thrust so deeply into the king's belly that it could
not be extracted, &quot;and the dirt came out.&quot; Just another lovely Bible
story. 3:15-22

# God &quot;delivers&quot; more folks into the hands of his chosen people. &quot;And
they slew of Moab ... about 10,000 men ... and their escaped not a man.&quot;
3:28-29

# Shamgar kills 600 Philistines with an ox goad. Praise God. 3:31

Jabin's captain), saying &quot;turn in my Lord ... fear not.&quot; Then after
giving him a glass of milk and tucking him in, she drives a tent stake
through his head. &quot;So God subdued on that day Jabin.&quot; 4:17-23

# For murdering her guest while he slept, Jael is &quot;blessed above women.&quot;
(Hail Jael, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among
women....?) 5:24-26

# &quot;So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord.&quot; (Let them all have their
temples pierced by blessed women.) 5:31

forces all the enemy soldiers to kill each other, killing 120,000. 7:22,
8:10

# Two princes are killed and their heads are brought to Gideon. 7:25

# For refusing to feed him and his army, Gideon tears the flesh off the
elders of Succoth and kills the men of the city. 8:7, 16

# Gideon orders his son to kill two kings, but he refuses. So Gideon has
to do it himself since his son isn't &quot;man&quot; enough to do it. 8:20

# Abimelech kills 69 brothers &quot;upon one stone.&quot; (He was trying to get in
the Guinness Book of World Records.) 9:5

# God sends evil spirits that cause humans to deal treacherously with
each other. 9:23-24

# God smites Sihon and all his people and gives their land to Israel. 11:21

# &quot;Whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will
we [the Israelites] possess.&quot; 11:24

# When &quot;the spirit of the Lord&quot; comes upon Jephthah, he makes a deal
with God: If God will help him kill the Ammonites, then he (Jephthah)
will offer to God as a burnt offering whatever comes out of his house to
greet him. God keeps his end of the deal by providing Jephthah with &quot;a
very great slaughter.&quot; But when Jephthah returns, his nameless daughter
comes out to greet him (who'd he expect, his wife?). Well, a deal's a
deal, so he delivers her to God as a burnt offering -- after letting her
spend a couple of months going up and down on the mountains bewailing
her virginity. 11:29-39

# 42,000 men are killed because someone mispronounces &quot;shibboleth.&quot; 12:6

# Samson rips up a young lion when &quot;the spirit of the Lord came mightily
upon him.&quot; Later, when going to &quot;take&quot; his Philistine wife he notices a
swarm of bees and honey in the lion's carcass (a Divine miracle -- or
just rotting flesh and maggots?). 14:5-8

# &quot;And the spirit of the Lord came upon him [Samson], and he ... slew
thirty men.&quot; (Samson might have been a decent person if he could have
kept the spirit of the Lord off him.) 14:19

# Samson catches 300 foxes, ties their tails together, and sets them on
fire; the Philistines burn Samson's ex-wife and father-in-law; and
Samson smites them &quot;hip and thigh with a great slaughter.&quot; 15:4-8

# &quot;The spirit of the Lord came mightily upon&quot; Samson and &quot;he found a new
jawbone of an ass ... and took it, and slew 1000 men therewith.&quot; 15:14-15

# Samson, with God's help, kills himself and 3000 Philistine men and
women by causing a roof to collapse, setting an example for Bible-based
terrorism. 16:27-30

# The Danites massacre the &quot;quiet and secure&quot; people of Laish. 18:27

# After taking in a traveling Levite, the host offers his virgin
daughter and his guest's concubine to a mob of perverts (who want to
have sex with his guest). The mob refuses the daughter, but accepts the
concubine and they &quot;abuse her all night.&quot; The next morning she crawls
back to the doorstep and dies. The Levite puts her dead body on an ass
and takes her home. Then he chops her body up into twelve pieces and
sends them to each of the twelve tribes of Israel 19:22-30

22,000 men were killed by the Benjamites. 20:18, 21

of the concubine.) 20:48

1 Samuel

# &quot;The Lord killeth ...&quot; -- every chance he gets. 2:6, 2:25

# &quot;The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven
shall he thunder upon them.&quot; If God doesn't like you, he'll send a
thunderstorm your way to break your body into little pieces. 2:10

# God will kill those who sin against him. 2:25

# If you piss him off, God will cut off your arm, consume your eyes,
grieve your heart, and kill your sons and grandfathers. 2:31-34

3:12-13

# God smites the people of Ashdod with hemorrhoids &quot;in their secret
parts.&quot; 5:6-12

# God kills 50,070 men for looking into the ark. &quot;And the people
lamented, because the Lord had smitten many of the people with a great
slaughter.&quot; 6:19

# &quot;I make a covenant with your, that I may thrust out all your right
eyes.&quot; Deals like this can only be found in the Bible. 11:2

# &quot;And the spirit of God came upon Saul ... and he took a yoke of oxen,
and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coast of
Israel.&quot; People do the darnedest things when the spirit of God comes
upon them! 11:6-7

# &quot;Saul ... slew the Ammorites unto the heat of the day.&quot; Then he took a
little break. After all, killing is hard work. 11:11

# God delivers the Philistines into Jonathan's hand. And his very &quot;first
slaughter ... was about twenty men.&quot; Not bad for a first slaughter. 14:12

# Under God's influence, the Philistines killed each other. 14:20

# But later, Saul and his army kill all of those who had not already
been killed. 14:36

# God orders Saul to kill all of the Amalekites: men, women, infants,
sucklings, ox, sheep, camels, and asses. Why? Because God remembers what
Amalek did hundreds of years ago. 15:2-3

# Saul killed everyone but Agag (the king) and the best of the animals.
But still God was furious with Saul for not killing everything as he had
been told to do. He said, &quot;it repenteth me that I have set Saul up to be
king.&quot; 15:7-26

# Saul is rebuked by Samuel for &quot;doing evil in the sight of the Lord&quot; by
failing to kill all of the Amalekites. 15:18-19

# Because Saul didn't kill everyone as God commanded, God changes his
mind about him being king. 15:23-26

# To please God, Samuel hacks Agag in pieces &quot;before the Lord&quot; [I bet
God enjoyed that!] -- after Agag pleads with him saying, &quot;surely the
bitterness of death has past.&quot; 15:32-34

# After God rejects Saul for refusing to kill indiscriminately, he sends
Samuel to find another king. David is chosen and anointed by Samuel, and
&quot;the spirit of the Lord came upon him from that day forward.&quot; 16:13

# The evil spirit from the Lord
&quot;But the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul [since he was not
murderous enough for God], and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled
him.&quot; But if God is good, then how could he have an evil spirit?
16:14-16, 23

# David kills Goliath with his sling, beheads him, and carries the head
back to Jerusalem. 17:51-57

# David and Saul have a contest to see who can kill the most people for
God, and the women act as cheerleaders saying, &quot;Saul has killed his
thousands, and David his tens of thousands.&quot; 18:6-7, 21:11, 29:5

# David kills 200 Philistines and brings their foreskins to Saul to buy
his first wife (Saul's daughter Michal). Saul had only asked for 100
foreskins, but David was feeling generous. 18:25-27

# &quot;David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a
great slaughter.&quot; 19:8

# Saul kills 85 priests of Nob and all men, women, children, and animals
in the city of Nob. 22:18-19

# &quot;David inquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go and smite these
Philistines? And the Lord said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines
... So David smote them with a great slaughter.&quot; 23:2-5

# David vows to kill &quot;any that pisseth against the wall.&quot; 25:22, 34

# &quot;And it came to pass about ten days after, that the Lord smote Nabal,
that he died.&quot; This was convenient for David who then took his property
and his wife, Abigail. 25:38

# &quot;And David smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive.&quot; (No
wonder God liked David so much!) 27:8-11

# Saul visits a woman with a &quot;familiar spirit&quot; and she brings Samuel
back from the dead. Samuel once again explains that God is angry at Saul
for not killing all of the Amalekites. He says God is going to deliver
all of Israel into the hands of the Philistines. (Since Saul refused to
slaughter innocent people, God will slaughter the Israelites. Fair is
fair.) 28:8-19

# David spends the day killing more of those pesky Amalekites. They are
completely wiped out again. (See 1 Sam.15:7-8, 20 and 27:8-9 for the
last two times that they were exterminated.) 30:17
2 Samuel

# David tells one of his &quot;young men&quot; to kill the Amalekite messenger who
claimed to have mercifully killed Saul at Saul's own request. 1:15

# Joab and Abner watch as the young men &quot;play&quot; a cruel game. &quot;And they
caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his
fellow side, so they fell down together.&quot; 2:14

# Abner smites Asahel &quot;under the fifth rib.&quot; 2:23
(It seems that in 2 Samuel this is the preferred place to get smitten.
3:27, 4:6, 20:10)

# When Joab (David's captain) kills Abner (by smiting him under the
fifth rib of course), David says that he and his kingdom are not
responsible. The blame, he says, lays with Joab. So David curses Joab,
his family, and their descendants forever. Let them all be plagued with
venereal diseases and leprosy, starve to death, commit suicide, or lean
on staves. (The Revised Standard Version translates &quot;leaneth on a staff&quot;
as &quot;holds a spindle,&quot; apparently meaning effeminate -- real men don't
spin or weave.) 3:27-29

# Some of David's men kill Saul's son (by smiting him under the fifth
rib, of course) and bring his head to David, thinking that he'll be
pleased. But he wasn't. David has the assassins killed, their hands and
feet chopped off, and their bodies hung up (for decorations?) over the
pool in Hebron. 4:6-7

# Whoever kills the lame and the blind will be David's &quot;chief and
captain.&quot; 5:8

# &quot;David ... grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.&quot; 5:10

# David asks God if he should kill some more Philistines. God says yes,
and he'll even help. So David and God &quot;smote the Philistines&quot; again.
5:19, 25

# Uzzah tries to keep the ark from falling off the cart, and God kills
him for it. I guess it was God's way of saying Thanks. 6:6-7

# David kills two thirds of the Moabites and makes the rest slaves. He
also cripples the captured horses. 8:2-4

# &quot;David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men ... and the
Lord preserved David withersoever he went.&quot; 8:5-6, 14

# David tells Joab (his captain) to send Bathsheba's husband (Uriah) to
&quot;the forefront of the hottest battle ... that he may be smitten and
die.&quot; In this way, David gets another wife. 11:15, 11:17, 11:27

# To punish David for having Uriah killed, God kills Bathsheba's baby
boy. 12:14-18

# David saws, hacks, and burns to death all the inhabitants of several
cities. Maybe this is what is meant by &quot;the tender mercies of David&quot;
(Acts 13:34). 12:31

# Absalom has his servants kill his brother for raping his sister. (This
chapter, which includes incest, rape, murder, should be rated NC-17.)
13:28-29

# Poor Absalom gets his head caught in an oak tree, and before he can
get free, Joab thrusts three darts through his heart. 18:14

# Amasa is viciously slaughtered by Joab, who &quot;shed out his bowels to
the ground ... And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway.&quot;
20:10, 12

# &quot;And they cut off the head of Sheba ... and cast it out to Joab.&quot; 20:21-22

# A famine is sent on David's kingdom for three years. When David asks
God why, God answers: &quot;It is for Saul, and his bloody house, because he
slew the Gibeonites. &quot;So God sent a famine to punish a kingdom for
something that a former king had done. 21:1

# To appease God and end the famine that was caused by his predecessor
(Saul), David agrees to have seven of Saul's sons killed and hung up
&quot;unto the Lord.&quot; 21:6-9

# &quot;He teacheth my hands to war.&quot; Might as well learn from an expert. 22:35

# &quot;Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies.&quot; 22:41

# The chief of David's captains killed with his own spear 800 guys at

# God offers David a choice of punishments for having conducted the
census: 1) seven years of famine ( 1 Chr.21:1 says three years), 2)
three months fleeing from enemies, or 3) three days of pestilence. David
can't decide, so God chooses for him and sends a pestilence, killing
70,000 men (and probably around 200,000 women and children). 24:13

Exactly.  That's why I used the word &quot;murder&quot; because the Koran tells
Muslims to kill all non-Muslims, because it is part of the duty of
being a Muslim.  Too bad Jack is far too ignorant to recognize the
context.

Thanks Salad

I'd love to hear any example of the Bible teaching ignorance or
hatred, if what you say is valid.

And I'd love to hear how Sharia Law poses less of a threat to freedom
than the Christianity that has been the foundation of America for 231
years.

And where oh where did 'human dignity' come from?
