We have a seven year old male cat who has always had a very enthusiastic and
non-fussy appetite. Until two months ago, he happily tore into any type of
food we put down for him - dry or wet.

Not long after we moved house, he started to refuse the dry food he had
always loved. We switched to wet food, and although he happily ate it for a
few weeks, he is now refusing this as well.

While he was still eating dry food, he went through a brief spell (5 - 7
days) of drinking a ton of water. We attributed this to the arrival of the
warmer weather. It didn't last for long, and with the switch to wet food,
his water consumption normalized.

I have had a few weak moments where I've ended up putting down salmon, ham
or chicken for him. He eats this very quickly and without complaint.

We checked all of our cat foods against the list of brands that were
involved by the Menu Foods recall, and none of them were on it.

He stayed in a cat kennel last week while we were on holiday, and the owner
said that although he had a few fussy moments with the food, he had eaten
everything by next meal time.

Other than his fussy appetite, he is an extremely healthy and happy cat. No
vomiting, no diarrhea, no weight loss, no nothing.

So does anybody have advice as to why our big guy has suddenly become such a
picky eater?

Hubbie suggests he's being manipulative because he knows that if he doesn't
eat his normal food, I'll eventually give in and feed him something nicer
such as chicken or ham.

A sign of diabetes, very common with cats. They need insulin just like
humans if that is the case.

Have you tried warming his food, a quick microwave zap, to release the
smell and flavour? It sometimes helps. Has anything changed about his food
bowl or its environment? I have had a cat that disliked a new plastic bowl
and eventually refused to eat from it. We thought at the time that he was
objecting to the food, but when we went back to his old battered stainless
steel bowl he was happy again and ate normally.

If it continues a vet visit would be wise to eliminate tumours etc.

There is always that.

You know the old saying, 'Dogs have masters, cats have staff.'

He has experienced a couple of significant changes recently. We moved house,
and are able to let him out in our new garden, so he's chewing grass and
rolling around in the dirt again. Also, a cat from next door occasionally
sneaks in to our house and steals the food from his bowl. Our cat has seen
this happen, and we did wonder if her presence was putting him off, but this
hasn't stopped him from eating good stuff from the bowl - only the normal
cat food.

Thanks for the suggestion about warming the food - I will give that a try.

&gt; Is he losing weight? Skip that. Even then, I would go to the vet to do a
&gt; complete checkup including blood analysis.

I just wanted to second this.  First rule out physical causes for any
change in appetite or behavior with the vet.  Hopefully it's just
something as simple as getting used to his new environment.

Try giving him a hard treat, and watch him while he eats it.  Does he
hesitate, take a long time about finishing it, or seem to favor one
side of his mouth?  My cat was doing this, and it turned out she had a
very painful cavity, but gave no other sign of discomfort - animals
can be so long-suffering.  Our vet pulled the tooth, and now she's
right as rain.

This brought back a memory.

I had four cats who ate hard food &amp; one of them was slowly losing
weight.  Took him to the vet.  One of his upper fangs was loose &amp;
causing pain when he tried to eat. I bought soft food to 'fatten him up'
before dental work.

When I served the soft food, he wolfed down the whole can.  I felt so
guilty that he had been starving.

I know how you feel, Khan.  I admit I got a bit choked up when the vet
said what it was and I realized she'd been in pain for awhile and I
hadn't seen it.  He told me not to be too hard on myself, as so many
animals ARE long-suffering and don't &quot;complain&quot; like a human can.
Myself, I can't handle pain well and all and whine long and loud when
something's wrong! &lt;g&gt;  One more reason not to have kids...the whole
idea of pregnancy and childbirth appalls me!

Well, at least we take our pets to the vet.  Many people pay no
attention to signs like that at all, and their pets suffer for it.

Take your furry fella to the vet and have his blood sugar checked.  He
might well be diabetic.

Well he's decided this week that he's not into water, okay with wet food but
still not much interested in dry food.

I crunched up some dry food into powder and mixed it into the wet, and he
slurped it all up quite happily. This makes me think more about the teeth
problem theory, so we'll have those looked at as well.

Thanks everyone for the suggestions and advice!
