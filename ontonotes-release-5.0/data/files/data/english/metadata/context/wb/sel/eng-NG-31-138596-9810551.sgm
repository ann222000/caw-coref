Britain could do more to help immigrants, says study

Sam Jones
Monday October 15, 2007

Guardian

The UK lags behind many other European Union countries when it comes
to helping migrants integrate into society and participate in
politics, a study claims today.
The report, released by the British Council and the Migration Policy
Group, found that although the UK has strong anti-discrimination laws
and a good record of allowing migrants to stay in the country, it
could do more to reunite families and help migrants find work.

The Migrant Integration Policy Index, which studied 25 EU members and
three non-EU countries, also noted that the UK had failed to
anticipate the upsurge in immigration caused by EU enlargement.

&quot;This old country of immigration has seen new unprecedented waves of
labour migration in the past few years,&quot; it said. &quot;Larger numbers than
predicted arrived from the new EU member states after their accession
in May 2004, with inadequate preparation for their integration.&quot;

The UK came ninth overall in the study, three places above France and
five above Germany. Sweden was top, followed by Portugal, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Finland, Canada, Italy and Norway.

While the UK came fifth for legal definitions of discrimination and
racism, the study revealed a gap between theory and practice, with the
country placed 11th among the original 15 EU nations when it came to
enforcement. It found that although migrants who suffer discrimination
are given financial help to fight their cases, they still have to go
through long processes to resolve grievances.

The report put the UK 15th out of the 28 for political participation,
pointing out that neither &quot;migrants [nor] their associations are
structurally consulted by government at any level&quot;.

It also said more could be done to help migrants break into the labour
market. &quot;Although the state helps them to get their skills and
qualifications recognised it does not set national policy targets to
further integration or allow migrants equal access to training and
study grants.&quot;

British policies on reuniting families and keeping them together could
also be improved, the report said: &quot;The conditions for a sponsor
include proof of income and accommodation, through a long and
expensive procedure ... family members have the same rights as their
sponsor to education and employment, but not to social assistance and
housing.&quot;

And the study uncovered some seemingly contradictory views. Despite
noting that &quot;Britons increasingly rank immigration and race as their
top policy concerns&quot;, it said that more than two-thirds found
diversity enriching.

Intellectual Bankruptcy of the African Elite

By

Chika Onyeani

Afrst ... @aol.com

?

Snippet: &quot;The African elite has been a
total failure; they cannot raise their heads in the community of
scholars or the intelligentsia.? They want to continue to sit at the
head of the totem pole, being spoon-fed, rather than at the head of the
battle line leading the masses of Black people throughout the world.?
That they have not been able to understand that the total Black race is
under economic slavery is a testament to their half-education and
illiteracy.

?

A community cannot survive when its so-called educated citizens are
morally and intellectually bankrupt and decrepit.? You cannot have a
community whose intelligentsia are mere parasites of other cultures.....It is any wonder then that we go to school and still come out illiterates.&quot;

In a highly provocative piece culled from his book,? Capitalist Nigger:
The Road to Success, pp. 97-119, Chika Onyeani concludes that the
African educated elite is a failure, an individual who is not useful to
the society, either in Africa or even as migrants.

Africans are not a forceful people, neither are they aggressive to the
point of a fight to the finish.? We are not resolute in our commitment
to a goal and lack the devil-may-care doggedness needed to scale a
Mount Everest or the Himalayas.? We are easily influenced and
distracted in pursuit of a? quest to reach a set goal and to be the
best that are destined for us.? Intellectually, we are bankrupt and
decrepit.? We have a very short attention span, and have a very short
burst of energy which easily extinguishes in the face of impediment.

?

We prefer to be parasites of a culture which we had no hand in
creating, a Caucasion culture which took them years to perfect, and
which we cannot easily emulate in its basic tenets? -? a predisposition
to make wars not only on themselves but more so on others for
intimidation and supremacy.? Unlike his Caucasian counterpart, the
African is a compassionate fool, easily influenced to hospitality of
known enemies because of their acts of deceitful intentions.

?

The balkanization of Africa by the six Caucasian nations, Britain,
France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Germany, resulted in the creation of
disparate and at best, baseless boundaries, countries without
geographic significance.? The fig ht to gain independence, was not so
much the aggressive pursuit of the goal of independence by African
leaders, as the realization by the Europeans that they had looted all
that they needed to loot from Africa.? The leaders of Africa who
benefited from the handout of independence to African countries had no
concept of the ideals of rulership they were inheriting other than
their desire to displace the Europeans in their oppression of masses of
the people and their opulent lifestyles with the resources of the
people.

These leaders' vision was in stark contrast to that of Nelson Mandela
and Kenyatta, the Kenyan Mau Mau leader, Kwame Nkrumah, Mwalimu
Nyerere, and Nnamdi Azikiwe, all of whom were ready to give up their
lives in pursuit of the freedom of their people.? They understood what
it was to be independent and free and were ready to give their lives to
attain that goal.? The lack of commitment to the real meaning of
freedom and independence by those African leaders who &quot;won&quot;
independence for their respective countries from their former colonial
masters has done more to impugn the intelligence of the Blackman and
raise more questions about his ability to govern himself.

Today, Africa is worse off than when it gained independence from the
former colonial masters.? The standard of living of the masses has
decreased steadily since gaining independence to the extent that now
there is more malnutrition, more diseases, less provision of essential
services, such as good roads, clean drinking water, good health care
provision and less freedom to express one's views.? The promise of
independence has hardly been fulfilled.

?

Africa has incurred more debt, yet has nothing to show for it. The
debts incurred were used more for grandiose projects than for services
to benefit the people, such as the late Houphuet-Boigny's $1 billion to
build the so-called biggest and best known Cathedral in his remote
village in Yarmousoukro in the Ivory Coast.? That is $1 billion to
build a Cathedral that is now not being utilized by the people, a large
amount of money gone down the drain. Was it necessary to build such a
Cathedral and deny the people essential services?

The issue in this portion of the book is not so much to show that the
leaders have not provided the leadership which would make us proud and
show that we can stand on equal footing with the rest of the world, but
rather to show the intellectual bankruptcy of the so-called African
elite.? The elite, rather than the majority of the crude African
leadership, stand out as the single group which has damaged Africa most
because of their quest for an easy life of luxury.? This is the group
that took over the baton from the former colonial rulers. They took
over the opulent life lived by the oppressors. Rather than eliminate
the excesses of the Caucasian masters, the elite saw their takeover as
an opportunity to double the pain of the masses of the people. Their
claim to the throne vacated by the Caucasians was that they had gone to
school, an education in which practical learning was not a requirement.

?

The elite inherited the European's position; he inherited his huge
offices; he inherited his more than 10 messengers; he inherited his sex
on demand from his numerous secretaries; he inherited his disrespect of
his subordinates; he inherited more than three cars; he inherited his
huge houses with several servants and drivers.? He inherited his demand
for unquestioned authority and obedience.? He was pampered beyond human
endurance by the masses who expected to see a difference from Caucasian
behavior.? Instead they found that their behavior, in most cases, was
more tyrannical than their Caucasian predecessors.? But the elite's
excesses would not be allowed to go on forever unchallenged;
unfortunately, the challenge came from the wrong quarters - the
military.

One by one, African governments were taken over by military men of
questionable character? -? immoral and illiterates such as Idi Amin of
Uganda, Emperor Bokassa of the Central African Republic, Sergeant Doe
of Liberia, Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, Sani Abacha of Nigeria.? Jammeh
of the Gambia is the latest in a line of idiots who seized power
because they possessed the gun, and then quickly seized the ballot box
in a corrupt election to declare themselves democractically elected.

?

The greatest sin of the African elite is not opening their mouths to
challenge these despots.? They feared for their opulent lifestyles.?
They feared losing their presents of money stolen from the masses for
their prostitutes; they feared being deprived of air conditioned homes
when the masses are out in the streets without electricity; they feared
their swimming pools not being filled with water when the average man
could not even get a clean drinking water and had to depend on polluted
and infected streams to get his water; they did not want to be deprived
of attending Clubs and drinking free drinks at the expense of the
masses; they did not want to be deprived of trotting around the globe.

The Europeans, on the other hand, decided to let these buffoons be
perceived as having taken over, and they exercised, and continue to
exercise, power over these puppets in any major decision making.

Unfortunately for the African elite, the buffoonery called the African
military had their own ideas of personal enrichment and aggrandizement.

?

The elite was the first to congratulate any military idiot who seized
power and protest how their predecessors had corrupted the country and
looted its treasury.? They danced to the tune of the new dictator in
the hope that they would be spared their opulent lifestyle.? But the
military being who they are, preferred to spend the country's largess
and money on their string of loose women rather than on the comfort? of
the elite and the provision of essential services to the masses of the
people.? They cut off their privileges and curtailed their attempts to
question why their lifestyles were being scrapped.? Those who attempted
to question the military, were quickly jailed or executed to send a
message of intimidation to others never to attempt such a &quot;disrespect
of constituted authority.&quot;? At the first sign of a contraction of their
lifestyle, most of the elite packed up and fled Africa, to the United
States and Canada, and others to European nations.

Today, there are about 2.5 million Africans in the United States of
America.? The majority are the elites who fled and the new elites who
are planning to return to an extravagant life of abundance.? Hence, the
African immigrant group has been declared by the U.S. Census Bureau as
the most educated immigrant group in America.? But beyond the fact that
he is highly educated, the African immigrant, unlike his Indian,
Chinese and other immigrant counterparts, has not had any visible
impact on America.? Most are still caught up in their loss of opulent
lifestyles in Africa, and have not been able to assimilate into a
society which does not recognize whether you are a &quot;prince,&quot; a &quot;chief,&quot;
a &quot;commoner,&quot; son or daughter of wealthy parents, but only recognizes
what you have accomplished by yourself.

There is this nauseating nostalgia about &quot;life back home, where I had
seven servants, who washed and ironed my clothes, where I did not know
where the kitchen was situated in my own house, where I had five
drivers for my five cars, where I could have as many women as I wanted,
where I rubbed shoulders with powers that be, where everybody called me
Sir/Madam, where people understood that I was a very important person

Who are the African Elites Chika Onyeani is talking about? Is he one of
them? He writes, &quot;The so-called educated African in America is tragically
damaged psychologically between his concept of his own importance and the
reality of American life. Many have been living in a dream world of
returning home to grandeur, and avoid being assimilated in the American
society until their coffin has to be sent back to their homeland, without
accomplishing anything: avoidance of participation in the American way of
life, which is looked on as inferior, and the reality of not having made any
contributions to a continent which is beckoning for people with ideas to
return to contribute to the economic development of the area.&quot;

Could it be that he is suffering from the same psychological trauma he is
talking about? There is an African proverb which states that, &quot;when you
point a finger at others the rest four points at you. Don't Onyeani realize
he is part of the problem? Can't he realize he is a Capitalist Nigger? Only
recently he was gripping over how Nigerian politicians ignore people of his
ilk when they rush to welcome them in Washington D.C. and New York. Oga
which one you dey?

He also states, &quot;The leaders of Africa who benefited from the handout of
independence to African countries had no concept of the ideals of rulership
they were inheriting other than their desire to displace the Europeans in
their oppression of masses of the people and their opulent lifestyles with
the resources of the people.&quot;

But he goes on to praise the same leaders is vilifying. Hear him: &quot;These
leaders' vision was in stark contrast to that of Nelson Mandela and
Kenyatta, the Kenyan Mau Mau leader, Kwame Nkrumah, Mwalimu Nyerere, and
Nnamdi Azikiwe, all of whom were ready to give up their lives in pursuit of
the freedom of their people.  They understood what it was to be independent
and free and were ready to give their lives to attain that goal.  The lack
of commitment to the real meaning of freedom and independence by those
African leaders who &quot;won&quot; independence for their respective countries from
their former colonial masters has done more to impugn the intelligence of
the Blackman and raise more questions about his ability to govern himself.&quot;

Where is the consistency in Chika Oyeani's argument?

Onyeani  gives a  psycho-sociological  explanation of what he considers  Black intellectual bankruptcy. But this chap,
James Watson, peddles the old racist dogma about  an alleged innate,  genetic, biological inferiority of Blacks.

Historians of Africa and the African diaspora  ever so often come across these outrageous claims  from colonial administrators and
apartheid theorists and  sympathizers - folks like Thomas Carlyle, Trollope, Wagner;  Verwoerd, Malan-  and a  whole long list of proto- Nazis,  that
Watson's view is hardly shocking - even from a Noble Laureate.  Read some of the world history text books and geography texts closely
and you will find similar views neatly packaged therein.

What worries me most today is not the view of another racist but the assassination of my favorite singer, the South African reggae star Lucky Dube.
May his soul rest in peace.

Dear All:

Whether one agrees with the Nobel laureate's remarks or not, his assertions
about black intelligence are flat out racist and offensive, especially to
black people the world over and, Africans in particular; his comments should
been seen as such.  In the days since these remarks were made public, Dr.
Watson has gone back and forth between saying his comments were taken out of
context and defending his rights as a scientist to tackle even controversial
issues.  All I can say to him is -- too bad, you have been caught. That
aside, the one good thing that could come out of Dr. Watson's ignorant
remarks is that his comments with ignite an important debate among African
elite and intelligentsia. If such a debate were to take place, it could form
the foundation for making Africa and its people count in the long run. This
debate, I believe is already taking place.  I would hope we can all stay on
this subject longer because of its importance and viciously attack on our
very identity.
So far my observations of various African discussion groups reveal that
reactions have taken rather argumentative direction as opposed to
constructive debate. I agree with much of Mr. Chika Onyeani's analysis on
the African elite in the sense that we have up to this point not
collectively used our know-how to challenge the leadership morass in
Africa.  Our leaders have failed us in every leadership category and yet the
intelligentsia many instances rolled over or colluded with corrupt leaders;
in the worst case scenario, they have opted to flee to the relative safety
of the West. As I read Mr. Onyeani's analysis, I found myself agreeing with
his critique of the African elite in the Diaspora, who on the surface has
the qualifications but lack the conviction and ability to work together as a
group to impact their respective communities.  Mr. Onyeani's reference to
Indians and Chinese in immigrant communities in the United States as success
stories should be a source of inspiration to the African community.  If we
can only emulate their example, we can easily turn the corner.  I would like
to add one thing that Mr. Onyeani did not mention about the Chinese and the
Indians, the money is the motivation behind their drive to succeed. There is
nothing wrong in trying to make money, its is the love of money which I
believe Mr. Onyeani was referring to that is bad.  He is equally correct
about our preoccupation and nostalgia about the good life we have left
behind in Africa.  The question is: If that life was so good, why are we
here?  As disgusting as these ostentatious claims are, some of us have
trained ourselves to believe in them.  It is difficult to find two or three
Africans agree on anything. A few weeks back there was a posting on this
forum that showed the irreverent put down of Nigerians by other Africans.
Africans are very good at gossiping.

The assault on our race by Dr. Watson should ignite a debate within our
community both in the Diaspora and on the African continent.  Those of us
with the ability and influence of making Dr. Watson's comments widely
publicized on the African continent should not hesitate to do so.  Our
leadership should be made to react to these comments. May be this too could
have a positive effect on how they govern i.e., it could make more judicious
in the way their prioritize the policy objectives and goals. This is the 21
Century for crying out loud! Shall we as a people continue to be defined by
others?  Let us not engage in arguments and finger pointing.  Rather, let
this be a debate with the end result of persuading first the elite that it
is their duty to help set direction for intellectual and social development
on the African continent through their contribution; and second, provide a
sounding board for the leadership in Africa to begin a process of
responsiveness to the people needs and aspirations of its people.

It is true that sub Saharan African countries by many indications have
gotten worse than they were at independence. This cannot be a proud record.
The West is comfortable but we cannot feel too comfortable to renege on our
responsibilities as Africans.  Can we afford to remain on self imposed
exile?  This is what it means to ignore what is going on in Africa. I have
had discussions with Africans who have given up on Africa.  Their
contribution is to send money back home. We should not forget that the
&quot;West&quot; is not home especially those of us who were born on the African
continent.  Remember this familiar question that always makes us
uncomfortable: &quot;Where are you from originally?&quot;

Stay optimistic!

There are groups of individuals who feel they solidly belong to the
Afrlican intellectual class, for which I have never considered myself
one.  However, if you erroneously classify me in that group, then I
have no qualms in agreeing with me that I am one of the problems.
Rather than my 'ilk' griping about Nigerian politicians ignoring me, I
was actually addressing the question of the enormous amount of funds
that Africans in the Diaspora remit back home every year without being
given the same respect that our leaders accord to the G-8 countries.
In that article, I had mentioned the figure of $35 billion, which the
United Nations corrected yesterday to the sum of $39 billion, which it
acknowledged was on the conservative side.

Yesterday, on my radio program, &quot;StraightTalk with Chika Onyeani on the
AllAfricaRadio,&quot; I had Dr. Ron Daniels, president and founder of the
Institute of the Black World, to discuss the question as to whether
&quot;Africans are inferior and less intelligent than whites.&quot;  In the final
analysis, my belief is that we Africans are as usual going to holler
and adduce all kinds of our previous 'greatness' to sweep this question
under the carpet.  The question is why do we continue to underperform
against all other races?  I believe that should be your correct
discourse rather than my griping about being ignored.  Thank you.

The balkanization of Africa by the six Caucasian nations, Britain,

Spain, Italy, Portugal and Germany, resulted in the creation of
disparate and
at best, baseless boundaries, countries without geographic
significance.�
The fig ht to gain independence, was not so much the aggressive pursuit
of the
goal of independence by African leaders, as the realization by the
Europeans
that they had looted all that they needed to loot from Africa.�
The leaders of Africa who benefited from the
handout of independence to African countries had no concept of the
ideals of
rulership they were inheriting other than their desire to displace the
Europeans in their oppression of masses of the people and their opulent
lifestyles with the resources of the people.

These leaders' vision was in stark contrast to that of Nelson Mandela
and
Kenyatta, the Kenyan Mau Mau leader, Kwame Nkrumah, Mwalimu Nyerere,
and Nnamdi
Azikiwe, all of whom were ready to give up their lives in pursuit of the

African
leaders who &quot;won&quot; independence for their respective countries from
their former colonial masters has done more to impugn the intelligence
of the
Blackman and raise more questions about his ability to govern himself.

Today, Africa is worse off than when it gained
independence from the former colonial masters.� The standard of living
of
the masses has decreased steadily since gaining independence to the
extent that
now there is more malnutrition, more diseases, less provision of
essential
services, such as good roads, clean drinking water, good health care
provision
and less freedom to express one's views.� The promise of independence
has
hardly been fulfilled.

�

Africa has incurred more debt, yet has nothing
to show for it. The debts incurred were used more for grandiose
projects than
for services to benefit the people, such as the late Houphuet-Boigny's
$1
billion to build the so-called biggest and best known Cathedral in his
remote
village in Yarmousoukro in the Ivory
Coast.� That is $1 billion to build a
Cathedral that is now not being utilized by the people, a large amount
of money
gone down the drain. Was it necessary to build such a Cathedral and
deny the
people essential services?

The issue in this portion of the book is not so much to show that the
leaders
have not provided the leadership which would make us proud and show
that we can
stand on equal footing with the rest of the world, but rather to show
the
intellectual bankruptcy of the so-called African elite.� The elite,
rather
than the majority of the crude African leadership, stand out as the
single
group which has damaged Africa most because of
their quest for an easy life of luxury.� This is the group that took
over
the baton from the former colonial rulers. They took over the opulent
life
lived by the oppressors. Rather than eliminate the excesses of the
Caucasian
masters, the elite saw their takeover as an opportunity to double the
pain of
the masses of the people. Their claim to the throne vacated by the
Caucasians
was that they had gone to school, an education in which practical
learning was
not a requirement.
