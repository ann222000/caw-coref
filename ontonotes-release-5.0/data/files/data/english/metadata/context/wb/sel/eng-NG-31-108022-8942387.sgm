Sauce for Coconut Shrimp
I love the coconut shrimp I get in a local Chinese restaurant.  It is not
fried, it is just in a delicious, creamy sauce.

Homemade Root Beer
When I was young we made our own root beer for a school party.  The cool
part was using dry ice to give a fog effect, like witches brew.  I can't
find any root beer recipes that call for dry ice.  Can anyone help?

I am looking for a whole wheat bread that uses cottage and honey in this

Hope it can be found.
Thanks a lot and good luck
