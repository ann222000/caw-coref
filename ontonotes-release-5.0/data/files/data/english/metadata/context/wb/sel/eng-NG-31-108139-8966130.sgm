Hi, I just got my new (used) HF rig, and I strung up a half wave dipole
for 10 meters using 28.4 mhz in my calculations. Several hours later I
am getting an SWR reading of 2:1 at 28.4mhz. Is that pretty good or
should I try to do better?

I appreciate any opinions.

if the radio is happily putting out its rated power then don't touch it,
keep operating!  remember, too low an swr can kill you!

What are you feeding your dipole with? Coax or ladder line ?I found that if
you use 450 ohm ladder line for your feed the length of the feed line can
cause you problems . What kind of rig are you using ? BTW welcome to the

Go up and down in frequency a few hundred KC and see what the swr is in
several places.   Depending on the feedline and length it should probably be
lower at some frequency near 28.4.

Try transmitting up and down the band to see where your lowest swr is.
Then you can shorten or lengthen the antenna a bit to get a low swr in
the 28.4 mhz range. If you can't quite get it to 1:1, coiling the coax
at the feedpoint, 4 or 5 turns about 6 inches in diameter can get you
pretty close to 1:1.

2:1 isn't bad, but you're probably not getting full power output if
your rig is solid state.

It's probably too long, but check it at 28 &amp; 29 Mhz. If the SWR at 28 is
better, it is too long; if the SWR at 29 is better, it is too short.
Assuming you are using 50 Ohm coax, no reason you can't get it below 1.5:1.

Frank, your analysis ignores the fact that the PA may deliver other than
its rated power into the actual load, it could be higher or lower power,
but in radios that incorporate VSWR protection of the PA, it is most
likely to be lower, and at 3:1, substantially lower.

VSWR protection helps protect radios operated by operators with the view
that 'anything works'.

To me, 2:1 seems a bit poor for such a simple antenna and probably
readily capable of improvement to 1.5:1 or better. More importantly, the
OP might expand their knowledge in the process.

The original description was scant on information about the
configuration, and I guess that sometimes, knowing how to describe the
configuration / problem is the first step of knowing how to solve it.

Others have identified missing elements of the description, the use or
otherwise of a balun is relevant in indicating the extent to which common
mode feed line current plays a part in determining the load presented to
the feedline.

Frank, I know that you know this, but I want to comment to the
group...
Assuming the transmitter does not fold back, the 11% reflected power
will not change the signal strength... The reflected 11% will be 88%
radiated on the return trip (minus any line losses) and 88% of that on
the next round trip, etc...  So, in the end the decrease in
transmitted power is only a fraction of 1% for feedlines with low
losses to start with...  W2DU's very readable book REFLECTIONS, would
be a good place to start for those who are a bit hazy on transmission
lines, reflections, conjugate mirrors, etc....

Now, if we take transmitter foldback into consideration, we will need
a lot of information about the various rigs before we can even begin
to discuss how much a 2:1 SWR will change radiated power...
Personally, for a situation where there is SWR on the line, I prefer a
DX100B - it's pi-net could not care less and will still put out full
power into 2 or 3 to 1...  As well as some more modern rigs such as
TS-830, etc...  Tubes have a lot going for them... The Omni series of
solid state rigs from Ten Tec also do not fold back under 2:1, though
3:1 does have some effect...

That will only be true IF the Tx output stage has an infinite SWR looking
back in to it, AND the reflection is in phase with the forward signal. In
practice this will not happen. In fact the re-reflected signal may be
180degrees out of phase and so diminish the signal by its total value. The
real story is that a much smaller proportion of the reflected signal will be
re-reflected and the phase will depend on the system in use.

In reality the impedance of a transistor o/p stage looking back in will not
be too far away from 50 ohms due to the broadband matching networks.Some
transmitters that I have worked on even had a spec on the impedance looking
back in, a real pain to measure under full power conditions.

Foldback on transistor amps is to prevent RF voltages rising high

My homebrew Field Day rig monitors only the &quot;forward power&quot; with a
single directional coupler and adjusts the output level to keep the
&quot;forward power&quot; constant. That rig delivers 83% of the power into a
2.38:1 SWR load as it does into a 1:1 SWR. This represents a 0.8 dB
power reduction. Big deal.

But my 25 year old Icom 730 delivers a full 100 watts to the output
regardless of the SWR up until it starts shutting down at around 3:1.
For example, with a 2.38:1 SWR, the &quot;forward power&quot; is 120 watts and the
&quot;reverse power&quot; is 20 watts. Aren't modern rigs able to do this, or have
they gone to the simpler system like I use in my homebrew rig?

Roy,

Modern rigs often employ a range of protective devices that influence the
power delivered to the load.

Many of the modern Icom HF radios control:
- 'maximum output power' using either the forward output of a directional
coupler or a non directional sample of output;
- VSWR protection to limit maximum reflected power indicated by the
directional coupler, typically to a value that is equivalent to the
reflected power at rated output and specified maximum VSWR (eg 11W for a
transmitter rated at 100W and max VSWR=2:1);
- maximum collector current.

The actual power delivered to a severely mismatched load is affected by
all of these. It is likely for such a radio that with a 5 ohm load, the
radio will level 'reflected' power to 11W, 'forward' power would be
16.5W, output power would be 5.5W.

Depending on the way in which maximum output power is detected /
controlled, it is indeed possible to get more than rated output power, so
mismatch doesn't necessarily result in lower radiated power (despite
popular opinion).

Egad, here we go again.

Foldback has nothing to do with &quot;reflected power&quot;. It's simply that a
mismatch results in higher voltage or current at the output which could
damage the output device or circuitry. That's why foldback is used.

And, for that matter, &quot;reflected power&quot; isn't radiated *or* absorbed by
the transmitter. The transmitter produces power which is sent to the
antenna. All the power produced by the transmitter arrives at the
antenna less whatever is lost as heat in the transmission line. There
are no waves of average power bouncing back and forth on a transmission
line. Mathematically separating the power moving down the line into
&quot;forward&quot; and &quot;reverse&quot; components doesn't mean that waves of average
power actually exist.

If the source is connected to a transmission line, the
mismatch results from a virtual impedance other than the
one for which the transmitter was designed. The virtual
impedance seen by the source is (Vfor+Vref)/(Ifor+Iref)
where Vfor is the forward voltage phasor and Vref is the
reflected voltage phasor. |Vfor|*|Ifor|=Pfor and
|Vref|*|Iref|=Pref  If it were not for reflections,
the source would see Z0.

DEVIATIONS AWAY FROM Z0 ARE *CAUSED* BY REFLECTIONS!
Deviations away from the design impedance are what
causes foldback.

One way for that to be true is for reflected energy waves
to contain zero energy but any rational person knows that
cannot be true. Reflected waves consist of an E-field and
an H-field whose ratio is Z0. ExB is watts. Watts are the
unit of power.

Do you really think that the EM waves bouncing back from
your mirror into your eyeballs while you shave contain
ExB = zero watts?

Roy, I have been involved with the evaluation and repair of FM and TV
broadcast antenna systems where the initial problem was a failure in the
antenna, which then produced a high mismatch between it and the main
transmission line.

The allegedly non-existent nodes along the transmission line for this

insulators of 3-1/8&quot; OD (and larger) rigid transmission line, at

It depends upon one's definition of &quot;power&quot;. A purist
will argue that it is not power until it is dissipated
and steady state reflected power is not dissipated
until power is removed from the source.

The question is: Are the ExB watts associated with a
reflected energy wave defined as &quot;power&quot; or not.

Hi Richard

I recognize that you address your question to Roy, so forgive  me for
breaking in.
It seems clear that the power is generated at the &quot;source&quot; and disipated
at the &quot;load&quot; and that between the source and the load, only disipative
components will exist.
I would ask &quot;what component along the transmission line between the source
and load can *inrease* power?&quot;.

As for the melting of condutors at 1/2 wave intervals, I attribute that to
high current density related to a low impedance at that point.   The damage
may actually be related to the high impedance on the line which caused the
voltage to rise too high.

Waves of voltage, yes [1].

Waves of current, yes [1].

Waves of average power, no.

History repeats itself in this discussion, so someone is sure to come up
with that snappy line about: &quot;Feel the dummy load on the reflected power
port of a broadcast TX! If there's no such thing as reflected power, how
come that load gets hot?&quot;

That's sloppy thinking. You are not looking directly at the main
transmission line - you're looking at the output of a directional
coupler that has been &lt;inserted into&gt; that line. Without the coupler,
there's nowhere to connect that load.

That coupler is a transducer. It samples signals from the main line, and
then it does things to them.

A directional coupler does NOT sample waves of power from the main line.
It samples the voltage and current on the main line, adds the reflected
components in phase, and delivers them to the output port labeled
'Reflected'. Connect a dummy load there, and sure enough it will get
hot... but that's only through the action of the coupler.

The challenge is still on the mat from several  previous rounds: can
anyone provide a fully detailed description of the operation of a
directional coupler, circulator or similar device, based ONLY on waves
of forward and reflected power? It can be done easily using forward and
reflected waves of voltage and/or current, but that approach is
off-limits for this challenge. Believers in waves of power shouldn't
need it.

[1]  Real hams can blow their own holes in the side of the coax - we
don't need no broadcast TX  :-)

Because that impedance is virtual, it is a *result*
and not a *cause*. The *cause* of the melting is the
in-phase addition of the forward current and reflected
current whose phasor sum is a maximum at points 1/2 WL
apart. Denying that reflected energy exists will not
keep the wire from melting.

The low virtual impedance mentioned above is the
*result* of:

Z = (Vfor+Vref)/(Ifor+Iref)

at the points where the two voltages are out of phase
and the two currents are in phase.

It worked. I like the word power. Ronald W.P. King uses it in
&quot;Transmission Lines, Antennas and Wave Guides&quot; on page 245 for example:
&quot;Important properties of transmission circuits (wave guides) of all
types include the following:
1. Low power loss (a) due to heating the conductors and dielectrics of
the circuit itself, and (b) due to radiation.
2. Sufficient power capacity. This implies sufficient spacing of
conductors and adequate dielectric strength of insulating media to
prevent spark discharge; it presupposes conductors with enough surface
to carry large high-frequency currents.
3. An adequate frequency range and a useful frequency response.
4. Physical availability.
5. Special features such as rotational symmetry for swivel points,

Richard, what would be the dimensions of flowing power?
Wouldn't power flowing past a point be watts/sec or
joules/sec/sec? Have you ever heard of such?

Wave energy flows. The power in the wave is measured at
a fixed point, i.e. the measurement point is NOT moving.

A Bird wattmeter is indirectly measuring the power in joules/sec
*at a fixed point* on the transmission line. The joules are flowing
past a fixed point but the joules/sec power exists at the
measurement point which is NOT moving.

Reflected energy is the energy flowing in the reflected wave.
Reflected power is a measure of that energy flowing past a
fixed point, i.e. the power itself is NOT moving.

&quot;Waves of Average Power&quot; is an oxymoron since waves move
and power doesn't. Be aware that &quot;Waves of Average Power&quot;
is an expression designed to sucker the unsuspected into
a losing argument.

&gt; transmission line.

&gt; The allegedly non-existent nodes along the transmission line for this

&gt; Teflon insulators of 3-1/8&quot; OD (and larger) rigid transmission line, at
&gt; 1/2-wavelength intervals over a considerable length of that line.

&gt; What other phenomenon do you believe caused such a result?
">

Let's suppose for a moment that the holes were melted by reflecting
waves of average power. Why do they repeat every half wavelength? Do the
waves of average power have a phase angle such that they reinforce
periodically? As an engineer, you of course know that the average of a
periodic function is the integral of that function taken over one
period, divided by the period. How then can average power have a phase
angle? Or do the waves not have a phase angle but rather change
amplitude as they travel? If so, what is the mechanism by which they do?
Can you write the equations showing the power at each point along the
line and how it can be greater at half wavelength intervals?

In contrast, the existence of traveling and standing waves of voltage
and current have long been established. You can find a rigorous analysis
of their behavior in a vast number of textbooks. Given the load and
transmission line impedances, you can very quickly calculate, even by
hand and without the use of a computer, the current and voltage at any
point along the line. Unless the line is perfectly matched, there will
be repeating points of high current and of high voltage. Depending on
the nature of the conductor and insulator, either or both of these can
cause localized heating. In the example you gave, the damage is almost
certainly caused by high current rather than high voltage. If you'll
provide me with the impedance of the load and the impedance and velocity
factor of the cable, I'll show that the high current points fall at the
points where the damage occurred. If you tell me the transmitter power
output, I'll also tell you what the current was at those points. Can you
do the same for your theory of power nodes resulting from bouncing waves
of average power? Anyone else having a basic understanding of
transmission line operation can explain your cable damage without any
necessity to imagine bouncing waves of average power.

If you insist on believing that the damage was caused by traveling waves
of average power, please provide an explanation of how these waves
interact to create more power at some points than others. Because power
is the rate of transfer or dissipation of energy, the power into any
point has to equal the sum of the power dissipated at that point and the
power leaving that point, unless that point contains some mechanism to
store energy. Your analysis has to be consistent with this in order to
avoid violating the law of conservation of energy.

I can provide a detailed mathematical quantitative analysis of the
nature of traveling voltage and current waves which explain the
phenomenon you cite. I'm looking forward to your corresponding
mathematical explanation of the phenomenon using traveling average power
waves.

Cecil,

I did not say anything that denied that EM waves contain energy.

Where this entire controversy always gets hung up is the difference
between the traveling wave model where the waves go back and forth over
the entire length of the transmission line, and the standing wave model.
In the traveling wave model it is necessary for the wave energy to
traverse back and forth along the entire line. This leads to the
condition where energy is flowing in both directions at the same time at
any given point in the line. In the standing wave model the energy
simply sloshes back and forth within a single half-wave loop. No energy
collisions; no problems at all.

As I have said many times, these are mathematical representations, not
physical &quot;reality&quot;. Neither is more correct than the other. No physical
measurement can tell the difference. But it is often useful to use the
most convenient model that does not carry unwanted artifacts and other
baggage.

Oh, by the way, it is not possible to measure energy at a point. Energy
has an extrinsic, not intrinsic, character. It would be educational to
read any good physics text to understand what energy really means and
how conservation of energy laws are constructed.

Roy,

If a transmitter produces r-f power, and a load connected to that
transmitter via a transmission line dissipates any of that r-f power, then
would you not agree that such an r-f transmission line conducts at least
whatever r-f power is dissipated by that load?

And if such a transmission line can conduct power in one direction
(incident), it can also conduct power equally well in the opposite direction
(reflected), until the net result of incident + reflected causes line
failure.

When the Zo of a transmission line matches the Zo of a load at its far end,
then that far-end Z absorbs nearly 100% of the power delivered there by that
transmission line.

If those impedances are not matched, a reflection is generated that may lead
to the real-world, destructive and periodic effects on the transmission line
that I reported from personal experience, earlier in this thread.

Of course.

No.

This occurs whether or not there's an impedance match. If I connect my
transmitter to a 50 ohm dummy load via a half wavelength 300 ohm line,
all the transmitter's power (less the line loss) is conveyed via the
transmission line to the load. This is in spite of a 6:1 mismatch at the
load.

In my example, as at any time the load and line aren't matched, there
will be standing waves of voltage and current on the line, which can
lead to line failure. In the example you gave, it was almost certainly
the high current points which caused it. If you'll pick up any
transmission line text, you'll be able to quickly see exactly what happened.

You still haven't explained how these imagined power waves cause
periodic effects. Please re-read my last posting -- is it some kind of
phase angle associated with the power waves, or is there some mechanism
by which they vary with position along the line? I'm looking forward to
your mathematical description of what you think is happening. You can
find mine in any textbook on transmission lines. If you'd like, I can
recommend a half dozen or more.

&gt; Hi, I just got my new (used) HF rig, and I strung up a half wave dipole

&gt; I appreciate any opinions.

Jim,

whatever the in and outs as discussed in this thread, if you cut and
resonate at 28.4, have the dipole at a decent height, feed it with
50 ohm coax you should get better than 2:1. Do you know what the
actual resonant frequency of the dipole + feeder is?

As an example I have a ten metre dipole in my loft, some 25 feet
above ground. It resonates at 28.44 at the end of approx 10 metres
of 50 ohm coax, the SWR is 1.4:1 . The bandwidth at 2:1 is 28.25
-28.63. At 2.5:1 it is 28.160-28.760. This is before the ATU, after
the ATU the TX sees from 1:1 to 1.4:1 over the whole of ten metres.

The guy is looking for answers to his problem and you lot just want

Next time the OP has an aerial question he's unlikely to come here :(

You didn't mention the balun, it is significant.
