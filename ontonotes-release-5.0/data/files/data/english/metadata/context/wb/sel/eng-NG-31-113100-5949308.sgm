Greetings,
A friend has asked me if I knew a site dedicated to the
etymology of surnames and I came up blank, so I am looking
for help.

The particular name she is interested in is: Snow, or Snowball.
I pointed her to dictionary.com for the word "snow" rather
than the name, where one sees:

[Origin: bef. 900; (n.) ME; OE snāw; c. D sneeuw, G Schnee,
ON snǣr, Goth snaiws, L nix (gen. nivis), Gk níps
(acc. nípha), OCS sněgŭ; (v.) ME snowen, deriv. of the n.;
r. ME snewen, OE snīwan; c. OHG snīwan (G schneien), MLG,
MD snīen]

:however she believes (hopes?) it is (exclusively) British.

URLs, references gratefully accepted.
&lt;ciao&gt;

Googling for "etymology" and "surnames" turns up several sites, e.g.,

http://surnames.behindthename.com/
http://mizian.com.ne.kr/englishwiz/library/names/etymology_of_last_na...

but none of the ones I looked at had anything to say about "Snow".

The Oxford Dictionary of English Surnames has both.

For "Snow," it has citations starting in 1221, and says "From Old
English 'snaw', snow, a nickname for someone with white hair.

For "Snowball," citations begin 1301 Robert Snawbal. From "OE snaw,
Middle English snow and ME ball, 'a white streak, a bald place," a
nickname for one with a snow-white patch of hair, or, possibly, with a
whitish bald spot amid jetblack hair."

I've always had an unquantified impression that "Snow"/"Snowy" is
commoner as a nickname in Australia than in the Br Is. If the impression
is right, why?

Instant reaction: Why not?

Nicknames vary by time and place as do given names. They are subject
to fashion.

I don't recall having come across many "Snowy"s in the UK, but I
think they all had the surname "White".

Since my ISP gave up on Usenet, I have used the free Italian
NNTP server at aioe.org. They are 'fussy' to say the least.
One of their rules is that every posting must have a

Do you not realize that "the others" might have liked to see answers to
your question? Or that 27 of them might have responded and been looking
forward to a discussion? and that posters rarely notice the array of
crosspostings and limited followups, since they're sometimes shown in
out-of-the-way places?

No, it isn't; they have different uses. "They" is indefinite singular,
but decidedly odd when used for a specific person of unknown sex..

A similar situation arises when I read the following remarks

# Why would it occur if not in a place that desperately

Again, if we didn't have Daniels's word that typos are
unheard of in sci.lang, we might jump to the conclusion that
'lable' is a typo for 'label.'  As things stand, we must
infer that there is a word 'lable' that is so far not to be
found in recent dictionaries.

Of course, there is also the possibility that Daniels is not
well-educated enough to know how to spell 'label.'  If that
is true, then 'lable' is merely a misspelling and need not
be considered a typo.

I like the idea of "theranews", but am in doubt as to its primary focus.
Is it there to give us the latest wildlife gen, or to promote a
hypothesis of the origin of the Atlantis legend? (I doubt if it's a
service provided by The Royal Artillery Old Comrades Association, or
anything to do with the fine arts establishment.)

From a good dictionary:

eisegesis /VIsI"dZi:sIs/ n.L19.
The interpretation of a (scriptural) text in a way
that is biased by one’s own ideas.

Is Antonio Marquesis implying that commenting on obvious
typos implies bias by one's own ideas?

I wonder if António Marquesis is another one of those guys
who pick up and use fancy looking words without bothering to
find out what they mean.

Also:

glyph /glIf/ n.L18.
1 Archit. An ornamental groove or channel, usu.
vertical. L18.
2 A sculptured character or symbol. E19.

From there to "glyph worth" seems a forbiddingly long jump.
(See above.)

Speaking of typos, I wonder if Antonio Marquesis's
"priviledge" above is a typo or a pathetic display of
ignorance of English spelling.

"A glyph worth of careful eisegesis"?  Do you really believe

to say "worthy", but it doesn't matter much so long as your

I could understand "a dollar's worth" or even, at a huge
stretch of the imagination, "a glyph's worth", but "a glyph
worth"?  No.

common of a word. Probably, you thought I intended 'exegesis' and didn't
even know how to spell it. Wisely, you checked it against a dictionary.
Not so wisely, your limited your understanding of the word to what
connotations you think the words used in the definition 'should' have.

Eisegesis is the attempt to interpret something in a way that meets the
agent's own expectations. Attempting to explain perceived irregularities
in other person's texts as confirmation of your own dislike for that
person is exactly that.

Bias is the particular orientation of something, usually but not
necessarily taken as skewed from a 'neutral' direction.

From the above, naturally, related meanings have developped in
different contexts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Though I'll agree it's somewhat of a rustic definition.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I wonder if António Marquesis is another one of those guys
&gt;&gt;&gt; who pick up and use fancy looking words without bothering to
&gt;&gt;&gt; find out what they mean.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Also:

&gt;&gt;&gt;     glyph /glIf/ n.L18.
&gt;&gt;&gt;     1 Archit. An ornamental groove or channel, usu.
&gt;&gt;&gt;     vertical. L18.
&gt;&gt;&gt;     2 A sculptured character or symbol. E19.

&gt;&gt;&gt; From there to &quot;glyph worth&quot; seems a forbiddingly long jump.
&gt;&gt;&gt; (See above.)
&gt;&gt; If you were a knowledgable person, you'd know 'worth' goes more closely
&gt;&gt; with the following 'of' than with the preceding 'glyph'.

&gt; &quot;A glyph worth of careful eisegesis&quot;?  Do you really believe
&gt; that's comprehensible English?
">

Of course it is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I suppose you may have meant
&gt; to say &quot;worthy&quot;, but it doesn't matter much so long as your
&gt; use of &quot;glyph&quot; is completely inappropriate.
">

And just why is it inapropriate, let alone completely? I thought you'd
be aware that letters are glyphs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I could understand &quot;a dollar's worth&quot; or even, at a huge
&gt; stretch of the imagination, &quot;a glyph's worth&quot;, but &quot;a glyph
&gt; worth&quot;?  No.
">

Of course not. What could 'a glyph's worth' even mean in this context?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Anyway, it seems inconceivable to me that anyone could
&gt; construe simply needling someone about a typo to be
&gt; eisegesis, no matter how far the definition of the word is
&gt; stretched.
">

I've seen very little of you, but the effort you put into producing
unsavoury I-touch-no-one-and-no-one-touches-me prose is quite patent.
Honestly, it's no fun when you're 12 but people will tolerate you. After
that, they usually tend to ignore you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Think of it this way, now you have some idea of what eisegesis and glyph
&gt;&gt; mean.

&gt; I have some idea all right, and I'll try not to be confused
&gt; by any recollection of what you seem to think they mean.
">

...and as if to confirm the above, the kuningam got to give the exact
same reply to this single point, only his has 'expunge' and the clauses
don't jar so much, so I guess he gets the prize.

&gt;&gt; You two could always go for a theranews free $3.95 account. It works.
&gt; You are perhaps referring to teranews? This is the outfit that enables

Alternatively, and perhaps a bit less tainted, Newsguy

a month or $39.95 for a whole year.  I use them only for
binary groups, which my primary news provider doesn't offer,
but they have excellent propagation and retention.

My primary news provider is &lt; http://news.individual.net/ &gt;;
they cost ¤10 a year for excellent coverage of non-binary
newsgroups; they're run out of Freie Universität Berlin.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Greetings,
&gt;&gt;&gt;       A friend has asked me if I knew a site dedicated to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;       etymology of surnames and I came up blank, so I am looking
&gt;&gt;&gt;       for help.

&gt;&gt;&gt;       The particular name she is interested in is: Snow, or Snowball.
&gt;&gt; The Oxford Dictionary of English Surnames has both.

&gt;&gt; For &quot;Snow,&quot; it has citations starting in 1221, and says &quot;From Old
&gt;&gt; English 'snaw', snow, a nickname for someone with white hair.

&gt;&gt; For &quot;Snowball,&quot; citations begin 1301 Robert Snawbal. From &quot;OE snaw,
&gt;&gt; Middle English snow and ME ball, 'a white streak, a bald place,&quot; a
&gt;&gt; nickname for one with a snow-white patch of hair, or, possibly, with a
&gt;&gt; whitish bald spot amid jetblack hair.&quot;

&gt;    Thank you Donna, that is good to know, and will, I am sure,
&gt;    satisfy her query.

The UK magazine Your Family Tree, December 2006 issue, had a bonus CD
which contains a reproduction of Henry Harrison's Surnames of the United
Kingdom published in 1912.

Might be of interest to you.
