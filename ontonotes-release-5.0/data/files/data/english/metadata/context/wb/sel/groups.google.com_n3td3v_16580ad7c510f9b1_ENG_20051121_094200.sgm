So my question is pretty simple. You have all these major companies such
as google/earthlink/sprint/etc. building wifi networks. Lets say I want
to collect peoples information so I setup an AP with the same ssid as
google's ap so people connect to it and I log all of their traffic. Most
people won't check beyond the ssid to look at the mac address but even
that could be spoofed. Is there anyway to verify a certain ap beyond
mac/ssid, will there be in the future? How do these companies plan to
mitigate this threat or are they just going to hope consumers are smart
enough to figure it out?

traffic? Gets you the _exact_ same information.

And why worry about Google, etc., when Starbucks and airports have
been doing this for _years_?

Lastly, most consumers are smart enough to know to use encryption
(the little pad-lock in their browser). Some aren't. Changing the
WiFi architecture is not going to save those who aren't.

"/> I have to disagree that most consumers are smart
enough to use encryption. Most consumers are dumb as a
brick when it comes to the internet and especially
security. Take a look at the average AOL user and
you'll see what I'm saying.

Starbucks and t-mobile is a little bit different as
these networks aren't concentrated. As we companies
start covering entire cities I believe you could start
seeing this as becoming a regular problem.

demonstrated many times, even us techies havent got our heads around encryption
yet.

One of the technologies first employed in Vietnam (I may be wrong, my

You could see this type of &quot;physical&quot; electronic warfare also employed
in Iraq with the US Gov't bombing the center of GSM-blocking signal
generators.

Locating where a transmission comes from, supposing it comes from a
centralized source, is rather easy.

Missiles for your local ISP to use? I find this rather amusing and a
clear path to take.
Locating these fake AP's will be easy, at least for the foreseeable
future until the Bad Guys start employing ANCIENT tricks to start
evading.... There are other risks and the future will show them as bad
or imperfect implementations and designs will show up... for now I don't
see anyone bothering beyond the goals of interest or fun. That will
change to profit very soon, though, as the technology takes off.

With wireless encryption you could setup your &quot;fake&quot;

sniff the traffic on the end.

"/> I am always careful when I write &quot;ALL&quot;, &quot;EVERY*&quot; or &quot;VERY&quot;, however, it
is very simple. Point is that like with everything else, the Bad Guys
learn and have a fountain of knowledge called recent Internet history to
learn from.

Employing different evasion techniques can indeed be a problem and this
will turn into a very disturbing war of cop and thief, never ending and
always advancing.. yet, it does allow for an active hand in combating
these individuals if operational teams will be ready and equipped to
answer the call when the time comes, instead of after it's already an
epidemic.

Further, just one solution is never enough... strong security, security
policy and intrusion detection systems for the real systems and AP's are
going to be essential.

Once again I fear these things will not be invested upon until they are
useless and a money-drain.

But aside to all that I must once again bow before your wisdom and
humble my opinion to &quot;yeah, it's not that simple&quot;.

any old AP or traditional WISP, perhaps one with open SSID, which may
or may not be true.

As far as open SSID is concerned, as you probably already know,
there's nothing much other than VPN client from a machine you trust
to some place you trust that is going to help you. Such is the
nature of the beast.

As far as other abuse prevention voodoo and other operation and
implementation specifics, I somehow doubt anyone will spill their
guts here. One path to find a few of the answers is to discuss this
very subject with the equipment vendors in this space, which
shouldn't infringe on any proprietary information of the operators.

This is still a very much evolving technology as well, so, expect
fairly rapid developments to address needs as they emerge.

you protect the data end-to-end.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So my question is pretty simple. You have all these major companies such as

&gt;&gt;&gt; ap so people connect to it and I log all of their traffic. Most people
&gt;&gt;&gt; won't check beyond the ssid to look at the mac address but even that could
&gt;&gt;&gt; be spoofed. Is there anyway to verify a certain ap beyond mac/ssid, will
&gt;&gt;&gt; there be in the future? How do these companies plan to mitigate this threat
&gt;&gt;&gt; or are they just going to hope consumers are smart enough to figure it out?

&gt;&gt; Why would you even need to set up an AP? Why not just sit and sniff traffic?

&gt;&gt; Lastly, most consumers are smart enough to know to use encryption (the little
&gt;&gt; pad-lock in their browser). Some aren't. Changing the WiFi architecture is
&gt;&gt; not going to save those who aren't.

&gt; 'most consumers' .. cmon, less than one percent.. seriously.. ymmv tho, eg at
&gt; airports you stand a higher chance of sniffing a vpn connection but as has been
&gt; demonstrated many times, even us techies havent got our heads around encryption
&gt; yet.

"/> That's right. Remember all they need to do is sniff wireless traffic for
dns request for &quot;paypal.com&quot; and then send a UDP packet back as an answer
(from closer location - might even be on the wireless network) that has
faked its origin as if it came from dns server the user asked and has some
other address for paypal.

The good news is that if SSL is used (dns request is due to user going to
https://www.paypal ...) then it will not properly work because they can
not fake SSL cert for paypal from verisign, so some kind of warning about
cert being self-signed and not issued by known provider would probably be
displayed, but many users will ignore such warnings.

But lets know imagine different situation and instead of paypal, lets
imagine user doing ssh to shell.mywork.com. Now lets imagine that dns
request has been sniffed and instead of getting real address for
shell.mywork.com, you get an address for wireless ip address of someone
else nearby that has redirecting ssh server. That special ssh server
would provide its own cert pretending to be shell.mywork.com and would
internally do proxy to another ssh session that is actually going to
real shell.mywork.com. Ho do you like this scenario?

So just in case do remember that when you ssh from insecure wireless
network node (even on NANOG conference) that you do it to the server
that you already previously did ssh to (and so have public key in
.ssh/known_hosts) and dont just assume that because its ssh you're safe.

The answer to that is no, this is a threat we live with currently. We have

You can say that consumers are stupid, and won't figure this out, and that
may be true; however when it's starts to cost them losts money, they will
sit-up take notice and buy tools to solve this problem for them, just like
they do with any other security threat that goes beyond being an anoyance.

"/> The problem is &quot;vigilance&quot;, especially as applied to non-security aware
users. Here's a quick test: pick a bunch of smart, non-geek computer
users and ask them what a certificate is and what a certificate
authority is. Then inquire what they'd do when the web page they were
looking at had some text similar to what I posted yesterday.

You're absolutely right that sufficient vigilance -- coupled with good
user interfaces -- should be adequate. Note my qualifiers:
&quot;sufficient&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;should be&quot;. Demonstrably, they're not. (A few
years ago, a company I know of deployed a browser+Java-based expense
voucher application. The login screen said &quot;when you're asked if this
applet should have extra permissions, just click yes, even though the
pop-up warns that that could be dangerous&quot;. A security-clueful person
I know complained about the bad habits this was instilling. The answer
he got back was &quot;we've checked it out; this application really is ok&quot;.
Talk about unclear on the concept...

That said, ssh (which you cited in another post) does a better job. It
gives a very big warning that stresses the danger. By contrast,
Firefox (and I think IE, though I'd have to find a Windows machine to
test that) tells you that various forms of certificate problems are
unlikely. The big thing ssh does is that it keeps a history -- it
binds the warning to your previous history. That's a much better
strategy than relying on ~80 CAs you've never heard of.

other PCs that appear to be looking for an access point. I've been

"/> I have in fact done this (well something similar). On a train from
Boston to New York I turned on my wireless card in ad-hoc mode, setup a
DHCP server and setup my phone for GPRS. Bingo, I had four other people
get addresses from me and presumably &quot;do stuff&quot; I didn't sniff their
traffic though. Good 'ole Windows (which they were presumably running, I
wasn't) was happy to go from infrastructure mode to ad-hoc mode and
associate with me.

There is a fundamental security dilemma here. Years ago the original
designers of Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) had the notion that users
couldn't be trusted, so the idea was that there would be one root CA and
it would only issue certificates to people who proved who they were.
Software would only trust this one CA. In this fashion, if the software
said &quot;This came from Jeff Schiller, of MIT&quot; by golly that is where it
came from. No end-user preferences to get wrong, no dialog boxes to
click away unread. I even remember arguments along the lines of if a
signature verification failed, the message would be discarded and the
user not permitted to read the &quot;damaged&quot; message.

The dilemma is that when you build such a system, the guy who is the
root always turns out to be a reptile (or is eaten by a reptile who
takes her place).

Oh, I am quite aware of the BGP RP-Sec work and many people have heard
my opinion on this topic, including some on this mailing list. But I'll
re-iterate.

Hierarchical relationships breed &quot;reptiles&quot; because of the inherent
asymmetric business relationship that results. The &quot;leaves&quot; *must* do
business with the root, but the root does *not* have to do business with
the &quot;leaves.&quot; This results in the root calling the shots, for its own
benefit and profit.

Frankly, I am quite impressed with the address registries. For the most
part they are the exception. I believe this is because they are still
run by or heavily influenced by the &quot;wide eyed academics&quot; (as I have
been accused of being) who believe in the Internet Dream... (you know
who you are!). However there is also a &quot;check and balance&quot; in that if
the registries become unreasonable, people will think about ignoring
them, and they have to know this, if not explicitly, implicitly.

However, I fear creating yet another hierarchy which must work for the
Internet to work. One based on a PKI would not have to be reasonable, as
the &quot;leaves&quot; would have a harder time ignoring it. Piss off the
hierarchy, and forget about being routed.

I would much prefer an arrangement where the PKI for BGP was controlled
by the providers. So an institution would have its &quot;certificate&quot; signed
by its upstream (or one of its upstream) providers. In such a
transaction the balance of power is much more symmetric and therefore
likely to be reasonable.

The providers could cross-certificate to build a &quot;root free&quot; (as in
&quot;default free&quot; zone) mesh (aka &quot;Web of Trust.&quot;).

a different certificate in signing updates to provider A than in
signing updates to provider B, then the validation can be quite
complex.

Any trust relationship model would have to deal with
(a) Provider independent space
(b) Multi-homed organizations, with and without AS's
(c) Organizations that are mobile - they might change their attachment
point frequently or abruptly.

Authorities exist for some number resources - e.g., those registries
hand out addresses - should that be validated by the web of trust?
(The authority says the address is allocated to A but I've got an
update showing the address originating from B validated by my best
peer's three best peers' peers) (Sometimes authorities are needed
- if you were buying a car from Joe Doe, would you prefer a title
signed by the DMV or the testimony of your favorite body shops
that Joe Doe has been their customer for this car for awhile now.)
That authority extends downward through sub-allocations in a tree,
not a mesh. (But the web of trust might be useful for those current
special cases that don't devolve from the existing registries, aka
legacy space, until that situation can be fixed.)

"/> not exactly. there are two trusts here. i have to accept that
asns as incompetent at configuration as i are attesting to prefixes
and paths or i won't be able to get to a large part of the net.

but this is orthogonal to my trust in their competence to attest to
the identity of other asns by cross-signing others' certs. i could
have a business relationship with an asn whose routing competence i
question.

the bottom line is which would i trust more in the latter sense, an
asn cert signed by an external hierarchy or a cert signed by one or
more of 70x, 1239, 2914, ...?

it seems more natural if the identity trust is congruent with the
trust of business relationships. a similar reason for my prefering
sbgp-like architectures, the attestation model is congruent with
the routing model.

it turns out most folk have a business relationsip with an rir.
but some don't, e.g. jis. and those who do not have become very
worried about their ability to route on the internet being at the
mercy of organizations some of which have specifically said that
legacy cert renewal would be tied directly to the isp or entity
paying the rir as if they had gotten the legacy address space from
the rir (i think i have sensed some backing off from this rather
extreme position). but the point is that some folk are not happy
with their identity being controlled by an external party with no
skin in the game with whom they would otherwise have no
relationship.

[ before you say it, i have suggested that a pseudo-rir be created
for legacy asns and prefixes ]

in particular, i have a business relationship with 1239 and 2914,
but no business relationship with ripe. should i trust ripe's
signing the identity of anja's asn more or less than 666 signing it
and 666's identity being attested to by 1239 and 701, the latter
likely being cross-signed by 1239 and 2914?

"/> Web of trust metrics for PGP have been discussed in several papers (don't
think it was ever for BGP). One of the problems is that it requires some
central server that has access to list to all relationships and is able to
quickly calculate trust metric from you to somebody else. Reliance on such
central service can be a bit of a problem i.e. a single central point for
attack, etc. (This is not say that RIR signed do not present some similar
issues as they would have to distribute revocation data, but those can go
as CRLs and at not necessarily queried for every path calculation like it
would be with central server).

You can also just distribute all the relationship certs but then amount
of data you have to distribute is going to be huge and each end-node
would have to calculate the metrics (which calculation is going to be on
the order of trying to use Dijkstra SPF with 50,000+ nodes in single OSPF
area - never tried anything close but I don't think such network would
converge quickly) where as single server can at least cache the previous
results although I think the problem would still be there (it can work at
least it appears to be possible with PGP).

Right. The idea was to lock down things which were in the legacy space,
unless people were prepared to undergo the full scrutiny of having them
transferred into an RIR (basically dampen the rash of hijackings), give
ARIN a clear way around the free-services-to-legacy-holders issue, and
give legacy holders a way around the threat-of-ARIN-trying-to-charge-
them issue. Seemed like a good idea to a lot of ARIN folks at the time,
and it was starting to get some headway, when the RIPE and APNIC folks
realized that it would deprive them of the future possiblity of reclaiming
legacy space, which they promptly nabbed using the extraordinarily
ill-considered ERX policy, which just took the problem and multiplied it
by five. Basically irreversibly.

So as nice an idea as it was, I'm not sure it has legs in this post-ERX
world.

&gt;&gt; That said, I think the problem is that we need an algebra of trust

&gt;&gt; trust a
&gt;&gt; certficate. You don't want to accept something if it's a twisty loop
&gt;&gt; of subsidiaries or allied evil ASs vouching for each other. OTOH,
&gt;&gt; there are some situations where we know that absolute trust is
&gt;&gt; indicated -- say, 701 signing 702's certificate, or an upstream
&gt;&gt; signing the address certificate for a customer.

&gt;&gt; And it's not just honesty, it's competence you're assessing -- we've
&gt;&gt; all seen problems when major ISPs didn't get their filters
&gt;&gt; straight.

&gt; not exactly. there are two trusts here. i have to accept that

Pushback comes to mind ;-)

As much as they enjoy sharing brew sessions, I don't think I've often
seen or heard of 701 and 2914 ever having to point out downstream
misbehavior to each other. And I *think* they both have sticks that
are big enough that they never have to be waved. So if we can assume
that this is true of the other folks of &quot;similar&quot; size, then which
are the large parts of the net you can't or won't be able to reach?
Or are your peers not prepared to own responsibility for their
announcements? And if not, why not? And I refuse to accept the
reasoning that seems to have smothered pushback - Networks don't have
to deploy new code or equipment or capabilities to control internal
or downstream announcements.

To save some resulting noise on the list; Pointing to the example of
spam is mostly a red herring. Today's spam is mostly generated by the
hundreds of thousands of compromised machines that originate most of
it, which creates its own difficult problems for the geeks who work
at that layer. Nonetheless, to a large extent enforced responsibilty
has worked for spam. The problem has changed. Paths and prefixes are
a lot different to the current spam problem.

NOTE: This is *not* an invitation to start a thread on spam or the
botnets that enable them. It doesn't belong on this list, so take it
elsewhere.

As another thought: - Love 'em or hate 'em, the PSTN doesn't have
this problem. Is there anything helpful to learn from there, ignoring
the perennial layer9 discussion ratholes?

"/> uh, i really do not follow what you are saying. the point is that
the trust model for attestation of identity need not be the same
trust model for the attestation of prefix ownership or of as-path.

in operation, this means that there could be isp- (or ufo-)centric
isp identity certification (a la web of trust, for example) which
could have a very separate cert chain from that of address space
allocation, which, aside from the legacy issue, could come via the
rirs.

"/> sorry to be slow/cryptic.

My issue is that if ISPs a) only announce networks that they know
(for different values of know - but hopefully based on some kind of
trust in the RIR's data) they are authorized to announce, and b) took
responsibility for the behavior of the paths or prefixes they
announce, and the bits that are originated in those paths or
prefixes, and took action to stop the bad behavior, the issue of
trust paths might not be so critical.

I am not arguing in any way with your views or thoughts related to
trust models. I was merely drifting back to the original issue of
rogue players in the path, and suggesting that there is an
alternative method of mitigating the problems caused by those players
that doesn't require protocol work. Ignore the deviation in the thread.

config problems, but rather intentional attacks on the routing

rife and a major pita. but i suspect that the most agregious
will be dealt with by direct approaches to the security issues,
e.g. ip address ownership, as-path intent, etc.

"/> Uh, PSTN does have this problem too. If you are part of SS7 you can totally
fake call origination information. This has been and still is abused for
criminal-malicous activities and 'billing-optimization'. Remember the lawsuit
of SBC et al against WCOM regarding termination charge misrepresentation?

In the actual PSTN routing of a call the destination information is not
authenticated either. The national regulators run registries where the
carrier-owner of each number block is registered. Very much like in the
RIR system. Depends on country a bit though. In some it's more strict

According to what I understand, there have to be two certificates per
entity:

one is the CA-bit enabled certificate, used to sign subsidiary
certificates about resources being given to other people to use.

the other is a self-signed NON-CA certificate, used to sign
route assertions you are attesting to yourself: you make this
cert using the CA cert you get from your logical parent.

can *enforce* a contract that prohibits a downstream from reselling
connectivity, at least if the resold connectivity includes a BGP
announcement -- the ISP would simply decline to sign a CA certificate
for its customer, thereby depriving it of the ability to delegate
portions of its address space. (N.B. Certificates include usage
fields that say what the cert is good for.)

permission to certain use of a resource under your control. If you look
at it the only difference is:
- To authorize reallocations you sign request based on another entity's
ORG object,
- To authorize announcement you sign request based on another entity's
ASN object (can be your own ASN).

But in general ASN object is also basically a type of ORG with extra data
(i.e. ASN# and ASN name), so I don't see why you can't use one cert (if
somebody does not list AS# for their org I guess they can't route
independently).

the test APNIC resource certificates are using an interim self-signed
CA, and will be moving to a hardware-token secured CA shortly. The
hardware is the same as our identity certificates used in MyAPNIC, but
a different trust anchor and CA identity will be used for resource

certificate is just a binding of a public key to an identity. But
there's far more complexity, much of it actually necessary, to real
X.509 certificates, or the PKIX working group wouldn't have churned
out 32 RFCs...

One thing important here is the usage fields. For example, I just went
to  https://www.microsoft.com  and looked at its cert. Under &quot;Certificate
Key Usage&quot;, it says &quot;Signing&quot; and &quot;Key Encipherment&quot;. There's another
field, &quot;Extended Key Usage&quot;, that Firefox can't decode. There are
other certificates, issued by Microsoft, that are identified as
code-signing certificates.

Here, we need several forms. One is just for communicating with the
RIR(s); that's a pretty ordinary identity cert. We need an AS cert (at
least for some proposals); that coudl be an identity cert, but with a name
of a special form. We need prefix ownership certs; these need a special
field identifying the prefix owned. (See RFC 3779, which also
describes AS certificates). We need the latter in CA form, for
delegation. There are probably a few more, depending on just how we
decide to secure BGP.

The purpose of all of these distinctions is to permit control over how
certificates are used, without relying on special-format names.

&gt;&gt;&gt; if it is not common across registries, and if my certs do not
&gt;&gt;&gt; work across registries, then something is very very broken,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and a major pita at the isps', aka your members', expense.

&gt;&gt; If you want to see member-certificates which gate access to
&gt;&gt; RIR/NIR specific services common across all registries, I think
&gt;&gt; you want to get that onto an RIR meeting agenda Randy.

&gt;i have been whining about the problems of cross-registry operation
&gt;for over a decade, formally, informally, presos, ... i have had it
&gt;on every rir's meeting agenda (except lacnic) for many years. do i
&gt;need to iterate for every ort of service the registries provide?

&gt;we are the registries' customers. many of us, especially the ones
&gt;who pay the registries the most, have to deal with multiple
&gt;registries. can the registries please get over the inter-registry
&gt;rivalry and make life more reasonable for us, the paying members?

&gt;&gt; We currently have no cross-certification activity in member identity.

&gt;where as before i was merely inclined, this has just made me an
&gt;extremely strong proponent of the isp web of trust identity model.

"/> I think the problem is both easier and harder than painted. First, you
need a business agreement that you will accept each others' assertions
of member identities, aka certificates. Second, you have to agree on a
common format and meaning for certain fields, including thinks like
CRLs.

I'm not sure if I think the technical specs or the business agreement
are the hard parts...

"/> I thought I'd mentioned earlier that we may want two different forms of
prefix cert, with with CA and one without. The one without goes in the
routers; the one with CA is used to issue certs to downstreams.

Rationale for the two certs: if a router is badly 0wned, someone can
steal its private key and use it for address hijacking. But that sort
of gross abuse of an entire prefix is likely to be noticed. A CA cert
can be used to issue certs for longer prefixes, i.e., target one
customer, rather than an entire ISP.

"/> Any version? No. That version, particularly its fixed representation as an
unchanged string of binary digits? Probably, but maybe not.. But that's
because Microsoft can copyright long strings of binary digits as software
and sell you a restricted license to use it.

Note that small integers, unlike software, aren't easy to copyright,
trademark, or &quot;own&quot; in any of the other traditional senses.

Back in the early 1990s, I proposed to number my machines that I planned to
attach to the Internet with small integers chosen from a small range.
Conveniently, at the time, there was an organization that helped, at no
charge to the end users, to make sure that no two people chose the same
numbers, and so I allowed them to help make sure there was no conflict.

Since that time, I've arranged to have those numbers listed in one or more
BGP announcements on the global Internet.

And, over that time, nobody else that I've noticed has also tried to use and
announce the same numbers... I suppose if that sort of thing happened a lot,
the Internet would be much less stable and useful (and filled with lawyers,
no doubt, arguing over their proposed &quot;solutions&quot; to the problem), so it is
nice that nobody has chosen to do so.

If there ever comes a time when there's an actual shortage of unique numbers
that are routable, I suspect things will get more Interesting.

"/> Of course they would pay the normal membership fee.
In ARIN, this fee is roughly related to the size of the
address space holding, but only roughly. It is a flat
fee for the annual membership subscription and it covers
all the whois listings, changes to whois entries,
in-addr.arpa hosting, ip6.arpa hosting, and new address
allocations for the whole year.

The fee is not directly related to the address holding,
i.e. ARIN members do not pay a fee for the addresses
which are allocated to them. The subscription fee is
higher for larger allocations because larger organizations
use more services more often. The holder of a class C only
pays $1250 per year which seems a reasonable business
expense for supporting the RIRs. And the holder of a
class B would pay only $9,000 and a class A holder would
pay the maximum rate of $18,000.

It's hard to imagine an organization who can afford to run
a network using BGP to announce a class C block and not
be able to afford $1250 per year.

"/> Not at all. Past services are anything that was received
for free in the past. Future services are anything that
is received as a normal paid member of ARIN. The ARIN
membership fee is determined by the size of the address
allocation that was received in the past, but it is not
a payment for past services.

Why is this so hard for people to understand?

If I received a copy of Windows 3.1 for free then I
can use it forever without paying. But if I want
to get a copy of Windows XP, then I must pay the
normal fee for Windows XP. Microsoft will not charge
me an additional fee over and above the normal fee
that everyone else pays for XP.

Many people registered .com domain names for free.
Then one day, there was an annual fee. However,
nobody was charged an annual fee for the PAST YEARS
in which they had had free use of their .com domain
name. The level of the playing field was raised, but
it remained a level playing field.

While I think $1250/year for a /24 of space seems a bit high, I see no reason that legacy allocations should remain free. Perhaps $100/year (like an ASN is) would be reasonable for small legacy allocations. This is especially important for end users who have these allocations as they would most likely be free from their upstream provider.

That being said, if it is larger than a few /24s I see no reason to not have the regular rates apply. If you have a /16 and can't afford the fee, you can't possibly afford to fill it with machines and should simply be allowed to swap down to a smaller allocation. Such a scheme would be in the best interest of all as it would all for some reclamation of numbering resources.

Charging something also seems as though it would help with the IP hording problem that is going on with legacy allocations. It would also help to &quot;automatically&quot; expire allocations which are not in use as users would be less willing to pay for resources they are not using.

If we consider non-operators e.g. medium sized commercial or NGOs ...

APNIC have a mechanism in-place, but most of the denizens of the
Swamp are suspicious that if we were to sign an agreement
with APNIC, we'd be giving up some of our historical rights
and exposing ourselves to the risk of reclamation.

Annual account fee (historical resource maintenance) $100.00
http://www.apnic.net/docs/policy/historical-maintain-guide.html
http://www.apnic.net/member/feesinfo.html#non_mem_fee

Until (and if) an ipv6 multi-homed transition is possible,
medium sized organizations here in Oz will continue to use a
mixture of PA and PI space to isolate us from dependence on a
single carrier.
In a country as large as the US, but sparsely populated except for
scattered cities, each with millions of people,
reliable and cost effective service delivery requires that we retain
direct control of routing policy i.e. have our own chunks of PI space,
though having one or more ASs is not necessary.

"/> Sometimes I think you are right about this and sometimes I think you
are wrong about this. It just may be that you are thinking only
about the &quot;right&quot; half, but &quot;operation&quot; of the registry to some means
the policy process too.

Where I see this as &quot;wrong&quot; is: There are five distinct RIRs for a
reason, to be attuned to local needs. The domain name industry has
one &quot;RIR&quot; asserting authority and we see the political fallout of
that. Having the five RIRs locked together would certainly benefit
(usually the larger) organizations that deal across RIR boundaries,
most likely (and I say that without certainty or accusation) to the
detriment of smaller organizations tuned to the needs within one RIR.

I think it's very important that we keep the policy processes - the
decision making part, and even discussion - separate. Yes, that
means it takes a long time to get a &quot;global&quot; (effectively, one
involving IANA) policy through.

On the other hand, you are &quot;right&quot; when it comes to the technical
services rendered and the interfaces used. That's because the use of
the data is global, no doubt about that. A student sending mail from
Africa to Asia will traverse two or three RIR area networks, just to
show how 1 consumer can cause a cross-RIR event.

One of the dynamics I see happening now is that the RIRs are
independently developing some advanced services. RIPE into DNSSEC,
APNIC into certificates, LACNIC into IRIS and unifying the RIR WhoIs
data. These advancements happen locally much faster than globally,
as is true with any innovation. &quot;Failed&quot; attempts at advancement will
be easier to recover from too. Eventually we want these services to
be global, but in development I expect differences.

on what service interfaces we would like to see in an open,
reviewable arena. ARIN has this for policies, but the path towards

After reading this thread well after it has ended...why does it seem
that a lot of folks equate &quot;trust&quot; with &quot;paying money?&quot;

Trust isn't about who can pay what but maintaining a system that
conveys trust does *cost* money.

The RIRs are not-for-profit themselves. That doesn't mean
service-for-no-fee. I don't see that an RIR has any obligation to
speak on behalf of (in this case, issue certificates for) any other
organization that holds IP space and has not established any
arrangement with the RIR. On the other hand, any such organization
cannot expect an RIR to do something for them for free.

If the ISP industry wants there to be certificates for the so-called
swamp space (badly enough), what would stop them from subsidizing the
the work?
