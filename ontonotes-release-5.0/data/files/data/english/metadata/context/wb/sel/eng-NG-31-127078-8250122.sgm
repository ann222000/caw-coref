Health Care Crisis Squeezes Working Families
by Lisa Baertlein

Volunteer firefighter Cindy Holland has no medical insurance, and her
husband's health benefits as a full-time paramedic do not extend to
family members, so she and their three children go without.

The hard-working Northern California family makes too much money to
qualify for public health insurance but too little to afford a private
policy, caught in a Catch 22 that puts many U.S. workers at risk of
financial ruin.

While many industrialized countries provide care for all, the United
States covers only the elderly and the poor. Some 45 million, or 15
percent, of people in the world's richest nation lacked health
insurance in 2005, up 3 percent on the previous year.

That number is widely believed to be higher today as healthcare costs
skyrocket, employers slash worker benefits and insurers gut coverage
and cherry-pick the healthiest customers.

President George W. Bush and governors of states like California have
taken on the task of finding ways to provide health coverage, but it's
not soon enough for families like the Hollands.

'ROLLING THE DICE'

John Holland, like most Americans, gets his health insurance through
his job as a paramedic with a private ambulance company, which pays
half the expense.

When Cindy, 36, shopped for coverage for herself and their children,
she found it would cost about $1,000 a month, excluding dental
insurance.

&quot;It would kill us financially to do the insurance - if we want to keep
a roof over our head and food in my kids. You end up rolling the
dice,&quot; said Cindy, a California native who works a pair of part-time
jobs on top of firefighting.

As a two-parent family, the Hollands could earn just over $60,000 and
still be eligible for Healthy Families, a children's health insurance
program financed by state and federal funds.

But that would require John to stop working overtime, which he does in
order to pay old medical bills and other expenses.

Meanwhile, Cindy wrestles with the idea of applying for public
benefits.

&quot;I wasn't raised to do that,&quot; she said. &quot;It's almost embarrassing that
you're not covered. There is this stereotype that you're an illegal
alien sitting on your butt and not working.&quot;

[of COURSE you were not raise to do that..we were ALL raised by being
brainwashed
to believe these stigmas with the outcome that we don't get the
benefits we
are ENTITLED to as long time tax-payers we give, but when it's time
for us to receive,
they want us to be too ashamed to get back some of what we have a
legal right to -ED]

These days, the family heads to one of the many Wal-Mart in-store
health clinics springing up around the country, where doctor visits
cost $39.

&quot;We went from one extreme to the other,&quot; said Cindy, who when she was
pregnant with triplets had good insurance through John's prior job.
Surgery and follow-up care to save the lives of two of them - one died
in the womb - cost just $200.

THE BIG SQUEEZE

More and more, America's uninsured - and increasingly its insured
population - can't win. And the prospects are grim as U.S. healthcare
spending is projected to double to $4 trillion by 2015.

Mexico-born Maria Morales, 53, is a single mom and legal U.S. resident
who is a full-time caregiver to her severely disabled son. They are
both covered under public programs.

Lately, though, she worries about her 16-year-old, a U.S. citizen who
suffers from fainting and dizzy spells and was mistakenly cut from
public coverage.

It took her nine months and help from Los Angeles' Venice Family
Clinic, the nation's largest free clinic, to get him reinstated.
Meanwhile, a recommended trip to the neurologist had to be delayed.

&quot;I find myself with a big surprise that life is so hard in the United
States. I'm a resident, just imagine how difficult it is for people
who are undocumented,&quot; she said.

Jeremy Smola, 33, already knows the devastating toll an illness can
take on people living in what many immigrants see as a &quot;Land of
Opportunity.&quot;

Five years ago, he had no insurance and was diagnosed with a goiter.
He finally had it removed three years later, when he had a job with
health benefits.

Even with insurance coverage, Smola had $15,000 in uncovered medical
bills. He declared bankruptcy, and, like about half of the people who
do, cited medical expenses as a key reason.

After years of pursuing a music career, Smola plans to join the &quot;real
work force&quot; and find a job with benefits.

&quot;I'm at an age where if I start a family, you have to have it. You can
lose everything if you break a leg and can't work for six months,&quot;
said Smola, who performed with the unsightly goiter on his neck as he
searched for a job with benefits.

Jonathan Cohn, author of the new book &quot;Sick&quot; about the broken U.S.
healthcare system, said America's wasteful and inadequate safety net
is eroding at a rapid pace, but thinks improvement is possible.

&quot;Most people have a sense that an enlightened society does not do this
to its citizens,&quot; Cohn said. &quot;We've solved this for the elderly (with
Medicare). Every other country in the developed world has solved
this.&quot;

As an interesting side note, since the article references people
residing in California, in many parts of California (though not JUST
California) you need insurance to access many parts of PUBLIC health.
This little tidbit right here plays very specifically into how I, a
former well paid IT professional who just happened to get sick between
jobs, managed to end up on SSDI. In case you're wondering how exactly,
it's because having a disability determination from the Social
Security Administration is typically necessary to get Medi-Cal if you
don't have minor children and my illness required treatment by
specialties that are only available to those WITH insurance - even
through public health.

After California, we moved to Washington in hopes my husband would
find work. Like California, many specialties of PUBLIC health require
insurance. But the real problem was that Medicaid in some specialties
here is so bad that I finally just told DSHS what to do with their
Medicaid. Why? Because when my Medicare kicked in, many of the
specialist Medicare docs (many of whom will now see me for whatever
the fancy billing term is that means they take what Medicare pays and
don't expect me to make my copays) absolutely would NOT take a patient
who had any form of Medicaid. I'm finally getting surgery next month,
that I've needed since July of 2005 - but couldn't get because of the
Medicaid mess.

These are not the sorts of situations that civilized nations force
upon their citizens.

I am a 53 year old woman who is not insured, because the only work I
can get is part time for now. I'm supposed to take three different
medicines, but can only afford one. After a recent accident, where I
was not injured badly, I needed to get a followup with an
ophthalmologist. All of the doctors I called to set up an appointment
called me back and told me to go to a clinic because then I would be
able to arrange for a payment plan with a clinic. That's what I have
to do to get healthcare-and I can only hope that I can keep up with my
payments, because I wouldn't be able to use the bankruptcy law to help
me (Neocon forbid!). It reeks! Single payer universal health-we need
it. NOW!

What Lisa, the writer, doesn't include in her report is that many
doctors refuse to handle Medicare, and Medicaid. And the problem is
growing. Everyone in America is at risk when it comes to health
coverage and the poor don't always get the best help. Try filling your
prescription even if your are on Medicare or Medicaid because these
new insurance companies that Bush has given free range don't include
all medicines.

&quot;If&quot; having health insurance is important to an individual, then one would
think that regardless of how much it costs to have health insurance, that
they would make the necessary sacrifices in their life in order to have
health insurance.  I would think and hope that since food is not only
important, but critical to being able to live, that if you are having
difficulty meeting your financial obligations, that at the very top of your
list of priorities would be putting food on the table....so to speak.  So,
it really boils down to the &quot;choices&quot; we make about what is important and
what is not as important, and what is not important at all.....
