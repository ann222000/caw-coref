WASHINGTON, March 5 (UPI) -- A friend getting ready for beach season
has just gone back onto the Atkins Diet. How so last century. Hasn't
she heard of the Zone? The GI diet? A mutual acquaintance swears by
the Ornish regime.

Haven't we been there, done Atkins? And wasn't it unhealthy for us,
anyway?

If we think along either of these lines, we shouldn't. A new Stanford
University study finds the Atkins diet is most effective for reducing
weight in women.

Study leader Christopher Gardner, a professor of medicine at Stanford
University's Disease Prevention Research Center in California, told
Britain's Sunday Times, "So many people have been asking questions
about diets for years. We think it's time to give them some answers."

When his study is published this week, it will show of the four
regimes under review, the Atkins diet resulted in the greatest weight
loss -- with no indication of undesirable side-effects.

Launched in 1972 by the late Dr. Robert Atkins with his best-selling
book "Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution," the Atkins diet cuts carbohydrates
like bread and sugar and boosts consumption of proteins like meat and
cheese.

The Ornish Diet was devised by a doctor treating heart disease. It
advocates eliminating blockages to the heart through a high-fiber, low-
fat vegetarian diet that was also found to reduce a patient's weight.

The Zone controls the balance of insulin and eicosanoids, neither too
much nor too little, by balancing protein and carbohydrates. In this
good "zone," fat loss is increased while the risk of cardiovascular
disease is decreased.

The GI diet is based on specific foods that release glucose in a slow
and manageable fashion into the bloodstream.

These diets have come into prominence as the Atkins diet lost
popularity, mainly due to concerns from nutritionists. Cutting out
carbohydrates by eliminating fruit, vegetables, nuts, grains and
cereal, might, some studies claimed, deprive the body of protective
nutrients and lead to a risk of osteoporosis, some cancers and heart
disease.

Gardner's study took 311 premenopausal women and divided them into
four groups. Each was put onto a different diet for one year: the
Atkins, the Zone, the Ornish and LEARN, which is the U.S. government's
recommendation of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet.

The 77 women in the Atkins group lost an average of 10 pounds --
around twice as much as those on the Ornish and LEARN diets -- while
those on the Zone lost an average of 3.5 pounds.

The reduction of body mass index, triglycerides and blood pressure in
the Atkins group was also higher than among the women of the other
groups. These are all indicators of improved health.

The head of nutrition and health research at Britain's Medical
Research Council, Susan Jebb, told the Sunday Times she believes
Atkins is successful because the diet allows high intakes of meat and
fat, and thus was easier to follow than more austere regimes.

Mothers looking for some way to tackle their children's overweight may
be glad to hear of the approval for Atkins.

A recent study in the journal Pediatrics suggests childhood obesity
that begins as young as 3 years old can result in the early onset of
puberty, sometimes as early as 9 years old.

Not only are girls who reach puberty earlier than the standard age of
10 or more at greater risk of certain cancers including breast cancer,
they are more likely to start drinking alcohol and have sexual
intercourse earlier, too.

The Atkins diet would allow young girls to eat the kind of food that
won't separate them from their peers -- cheeseburgers, for instance,
but without the bun.

Locusts hold key to ideal diet

Louise Hall

March 4, 2007

THE eating habits of locusts and caterpillars might hold the key to
discovering the perfect diet, researchers say.

At the University of Sydney, obesity experts are conducting a three-
year trial that aims to prove people keep eating until they have
satisfied their appetite for protein.

The study will involve groups of volunteers kept in laboratory
conditions for a week at a time and fed carefully manipulated diets.

The project's chief investigator, Professor Stephen Simpson, said the
study will test his "protein leverage hypothesis" that high-protein
diets, such as the CSIRO Total Wellbeing and Atkins, work not because
they cut out carbohydrates but because they are high in protein.

The theory follows the observation that insects such as locusts move
in swarms to areas providing enough protein for their diet.

Humans don't move, they eat more.

"If you eat a diet with a high proportion of fat and carbohydrates -
the typical modern Western diet - you will keep eating until you get
the amount of protein the body needs before you feel full," Professor
Simpson said. "And that means you will grossly overeat."

The researchers will soon begin recruiting volunteers - 24 lean and 24
obese - who will live in a special unit at Royal Prince Alfred
Hospital for three periods of one week.

Monitored 24 hours a day by research staff, the volunteers will be
given a low, medium or high protein diet and the amount they eat and
their weight will be measured.

"In the week they eat a high-protein diet they should eat fewer
calories," co-researcher Professor Ian Caterson said.

The issue of protein being good or not so good isn't the issue at all.

The evident issue is that PROTEIN IS AN APPETITE REGULATOR.

They drew the inference from protein consumption behaviors in insects
MOVE TO WHERE THERE IS MORE PROTEIN, and a statement about protein
consumption behavior in humans. EAT MORE WHERE YOU ARE.

It isn't about protein being "good" at all, but about consumption patterns.

Supposedly, one is to tie the first story on the evident superiority of
the Atkins diet to the second study on the consumption of protein as an
appetite regulator.

Thus, you presumably have better appetite control with a
"Atkins/Protein" diet and you have better weight loss.

Hrm. So, there's weight loss and then there's weight loss.

If we accept that muscle burns calories, and therefore can cause your
body to eat your ass, then, some questions come up. Like how do I
build muscle? and How do I preserve the muscle I have, since
generally, my weight loss effort will tend to leach some of the good
(LBM) along with the riff raff (fat).

Since we are diligent study readers, we know that protein consumption
is protective of LBM. In fact, this is why, with the proper mix of
protein, you can actually build LBM on a LC diet, while it's very hard
to on a low fat diet.

So, what do we know. We know that protein is vital to the protection
of LBM, and indeed the increase of LBM. We know that LBM burns fat
off, so more LBM is better for weight loss (in a practical sense. We
know the scale reads a pound of fat the same as a pound of muscle).
Therefore, protein is good, beyond the "appetite control" function.

And don't get me started on the metabolic advantages of protein.

&gt; WASHINGTON, March 5 (UPI) -- A friend getting ready for beach season
&gt; has just gone back onto the Atkins Diet. How so last century. Hasn't
&gt; she heard of the Zone? The GI diet? A mutual acquaintance swears by
&gt; the Ornish regime.

&gt; Haven't we been there, done Atkins? And wasn't it unhealthy for us,
&gt; anyway?

&gt; If we think along either of these lines, we shouldn't. A new Stanford
&gt; University study finds the Atkins diet is most effective for reducing
&gt; weight in women.

&gt; Study leader Christopher Gardner, a professor of medicine at Stanford
&gt; University's Disease Prevention Research Center in California, told
&gt; Britain's Sunday Times, &quot;So many people have been asking questions
&gt; about diets for years. We think it's time to give them some answers.&quot;

&gt; When his study is published this week, it will show of the four
&gt; regimes under review, the Atkins diet resulted in the greatest weight
&gt; loss -- with no indication of undesirable side-effects.

&gt; Launched in 1972 by the late Dr. Robert Atkins with his best-selling
&gt; book &quot;Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution,&quot; the Atkins diet cuts carbohydrates
&gt; like bread and sugar and boosts consumption of proteins like meat and
&gt; cheese.

&gt; The Ornish Diet was devised by a doctor treating heart disease. It
&gt; advocates eliminating blockages to the heart through a high-fiber, low-
&gt; fat vegetarian diet that was also found to reduce a patient's weight.

&gt; The Zone controls the balance of insulin and eicosanoids, neither too
&gt; much nor too little, by balancing protein and carbohydrates. In this
&gt; good &quot;zone,&quot; fat loss is increased while the risk of cardiovascular
&gt; disease is decreased.

&gt; The GI diet is based on specific foods that release glucose in a slow
&gt; and manageable fashion into the bloodstream.

&gt; These diets have come into prominence as the Atkins diet lost
&gt; popularity, mainly due to concerns from nutritionists. Cutting out
&gt; carbohydrates by eliminating fruit, vegetables, nuts, grains and
&gt; cereal, might, some studies claimed, deprive the body of protective
&gt; nutrients and lead to a risk of osteoporosis, some cancers and heart
&gt; disease.

&gt; Gardner's study took 311 premenopausal women and divided them into
&gt; four groups. Each was put onto a different diet for one year: the
&gt; Atkins, the Zone, the Ornish and LEARN, which is the U.S. government's
&gt; recommendation of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet.

&gt; The 77 women in the Atkins group lost an average of 10 pounds --
&gt; around twice as much as those on the Ornish and LEARN diets -- while
&gt; those on the Zone lost an average of 3.5 pounds.

&gt; The reduction of body mass index, triglycerides and blood pressure in
&gt; the Atkins group was also higher than among the women of the other
&gt; groups. These are all indicators of improved health.

&gt; The head of nutrition and health research at Britain's Medical
&gt; Research Council, Susan Jebb, told the Sunday Times she believes
&gt; Atkins is successful because the diet allows high intakes of meat and
&gt; fat, and thus was easier to follow than more austere regimes.

&gt; Mothers looking for some way to tackle their children's overweight may
&gt; be glad to hear of the approval for Atkins.

&gt; A recent study in the journal Pediatrics suggests childhood obesity
&gt; that begins as young as 3 years old can result in the early onset of

&gt; Not only are girls who reach puberty earlier than the standard age of

&gt; they are more likely to start drinking alcohol and have sexual
&gt; intercourse earlier, too.

&gt; Locusts hold key to ideal diet

&gt; Louise Hall

&gt; March 4, 2007

&gt; THE eating habits of locusts and caterpillars might hold the key to
&gt; discovering the perfect diet, researchers say.

&gt; At the University of Sydney, obesity experts are conducting a three-
&gt; year trial that aims to prove people keep eating until they have
&gt; satisfied their appetite for protein.

&gt; The study will involve groups of volunteers kept in laboratory
&gt; conditions for a week at a time and fed carefully manipulated diets.

&gt; The project's chief investigator, Professor Stephen Simpson, said the
&gt; study will test his &quot;protein leverage hypothesis&quot; that high-protein
&gt; diets, such as the CSIRO Total Wellbeing and Atkins, work not because
&gt; they cut out carbohydrates but because they are high in protein.

&gt; The theory follows the observation that insects such as locusts move
&gt; in swarms to areas providing enough protein for their diet.

&gt; Humans don't move, they eat more.

&gt; &quot;If you eat a diet with a high proportion of fat and carbohydrates -
&gt; the typical modern Western diet - you will keep eating until you get
&gt; the amount of protein the body needs before you feel full,&quot; Professor
&gt; Simpson said. &quot;And that means you will grossly overeat.&quot;

&gt; The researchers will soon begin recruiting volunteers - 24 lean and 24
&gt; obese - who will live in a special unit at Royal Prince Alfred
&gt; Hospital for three periods of one week.

&gt; Monitored 24 hours a day by research staff, the volunteers will be
&gt; given a low, medium or high protein diet and the amount they eat and
&gt; their weight will be measured.

&gt; &quot;In the week they eat a high-protein diet they should eat fewer
&gt; calories,&quot; co-researcher Professor Ian Caterson said.

&gt; generally, my weight loss effort will tend to leach some of the good
&gt; (LBM) along with the riff raff (fat).

&gt; Since we are diligent study readers, we know that protein consumption
&gt; is protective of LBM. In fact, this is why, with the proper mix of
&gt; protein, you can actually build LBM on a LC diet, while it's very hard
&gt; to on a low fat diet.

&gt; So, what do we know. We know that protein is vital to the protection
&gt; of LBM, and indeed the increase of LBM. We know that LBM burns fat
&gt; off, so more LBM is better for weight loss (in a practical sense. We
&gt; know the scale reads a pound of fat the same as a pound of muscle).
&gt; Therefore, protein is good, beyond the &quot;appetite control&quot; function.

&gt; And don't get me started on the metabolic advantages of protein.

Weight or "resistance" training.

Aerobics have little to do with muscle building.

In aerobics your metabolism is back to your normal or even a little lower
within 20 minutes of stopping (typically 5 minutes)
In weight or resistance training your metabolism stays within 50% of the
increase for 6 hours.

&gt; &gt;&gt;If we think along either of these lines, we shouldn't. A new Stanford

&gt; &gt;&gt;weight in women.

&gt; &gt; Another short term study.  Nice.  Time for longer term ones please.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Launched in 1972 by the late Dr. Robert Atkins with his best-selling
&gt; &gt;&gt;book &quot;Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution,&quot; the Atkins diet cuts carbohydrates
&gt; &gt;&gt;like bread and sugar and boosts consumption of proteins like meat and
&gt; &gt;&gt;cheese.
&gt; &gt;&gt;...
&gt; &gt;&gt;These diets have come into prominence as the Atkins diet lost
&gt; &gt;&gt;popularity, mainly due to concerns from nutritionists. Cutting out
&gt; &gt;&gt;carbohydrates by eliminating fruit, vegetables, nuts, grains and
&gt; &gt;&gt;cereal, might, some studies claimed, deprive the body of protective
&gt; &gt;&gt;nutrients and lead to a risk of osteoporosis, some cancers and heart
&gt; &gt;&gt;disease.

&gt; &gt; Just once I want to read about a study that's actually about doing
&gt; &gt; what the directions say for Atkins and not this made up crap about
&gt; &gt; eliminating veggies and such!

Well, now, that's a nice tangent.

Couple things:

1- If I want the muscle, I gotta lift the weight, no argument there.
If I want people to see the muscle, I have to lose some weight, and
aerobic exercise can be very useful for that piece of the equation.

2- What you state "metabolism back to normal or lower within 20 mins
of stop" is generally true. But I can beat it and so can you. Do
Intervals (not the kind the bike program offers) and do them hard. You
can keep your metabolism fired for quite a bit of time.

3- If we want to maximize for fat loss, why don't we do our resistance
work in circuits. We can get our heart beating like cardio, and get a
weight workout in. Oh yeah, and we can lift more stuff in a shorter
amount of time. I like the concept.

Weight or resistance training should ALWAYS take the same amount of time.
EXAMPLE
Pick a weight that you can lift 15 times slowly (five seconds up (out), five
seconds down (in)) over a period of 120 to 150 seconds. (one arm, two arms,
leg, legs, whatever.)  Faster is only modified aerobics.

Example; 15 lb free-weight in each hand. (or 5lb or 8 or 10 or 20, I do
30lb)
Rest both hands on shoulders.
Push one up to extended arm over a period of slow count of five, lower at a
slow count of five.
Do the same with the other hand / arm.
That's one time
Repeat the set 14 more times.

Now, with a different probable weight curl each arm in the same manner.

Deep knee bends, leg lifts etc etc.

The same can be done with machines.

If you can last more than 15 (more than 16) times, increase the weight.  If
you can't do 15, reduce the weight.
Work the arms overhead, spread, push , legs, etc etc.
Total time, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Cardio is about increasing heart rate. Resistance training is NOT about
increased heart rate even thought the heart rate does go up but nowhere near
that of cardio.

Suppose my Maintenance of carbs is 100 grams and my daily Calorie intake
is 2000 Calories. My carb Dalorie count is about 400 Cals and then my
percentage of carbs is 400/2000 or 20 percent.

So if my protein intake is 100 grams or 400 calories, then it would be
also 20% of the daily calories for 60% fat, 20% protein and 20% carbs.
[60%+20%+20$=100%]

If the protein intake is raised to 200 grams or 800 Calories, then the
ratios would be 40% fat, 40% protein and 20% carbs.

If the protein is raised to 400 grams or  1200 calories then for the
2000 calorie diet one gets a ratio of 20% fat, 60% protein and 20% carbs.

It would take a mantenance level of nearly 200 grams of carbs with a
2000 Cal diet to get the carb count up to 40%, and I believe that is an
uncommonly high Carb count for maintenance.

In other words, the claim that an Atkins person will end up about like
the Zone at 30% fat, 30% protein and 40% Carbs doesn't seem realistic.

I can imagine a Zone guy wanting to argue that "When all is said and
done, eveybody ends up about like the Zone plan in the maintenance stages."

I can actually belive that a Zone guy would go ahead and argue exactly
that, anyway.

Facts don't matter that much, this is religion --- oops, I mean dietary.

I wrote up a thread on this topic on my free site:

http://groups.msn.com/TheScientificDebateForum-/

A key point is that there is no Atkins Diet, because the effects on
the body from a diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids will be much
different from a diet rich in unsaturated fatty acids (and low in
PUFAs), because saturated fatty acids resist free radical "attack,"
whereas PUFAs succumb readily.  The molecular-level evidence is now
clear, and the rest is just suggestive, at best.  There are plenty of
scientific citations on my site, so you can read the evidence for
yourself.  And you can always do a www.pubmed.com search, especially
after you familiarize yourself with the important terms and phrases,
such as "in vivo lipid peroxidaiton."

&gt;I wrote up a thread on this topic on my free site:

&gt; http://groups.msn.com/TheScientificDebateForum-/

&gt; A key point is that there is no Atkins Diet, because the effects on
&gt; the body from a diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids will be much
&gt; different from a diet rich in unsaturated fatty acids (and low in
&gt; PUFAs), because saturated fatty acids resist free radical &quot;attack,&quot;
&gt; whereas PUFAs succumb readily.  The molecular-level evidence is now
&gt; clear, and the rest is just suggestive, at best.  There are plenty of
&gt; scientific citations on my site, so you can read the evidence for
&gt; yourself.  And you can always do a www.pubmed.com search, especially
&gt; after you familiarize yourself with the important terms and phrases,
&gt; such as &quot;in vivo lipid peroxidaiton.&quot;

You think the first few weeks of body training are the Atkins diet.  WRONG

The difficulty is that people eat too many calories and exercise too little.

I suspect the %carbs has risen over the years, at least in the US. It's hard
to see how it could be otherwise, since the US government takes tax revenues
and uses a lot of them to produce unimaginable amounts of high fructose corn
syrup at give-away prices. A fast-food chain would be nuts not to be looking
for every way possible to use the gift from the taxpayers to induce more and
more consumption of a product they can get virtually for free and sell for
real money.

One reason the portion sizes have gone up is that inducing people to eat
more enables the chains to make more profit. Mostly, the profit comes from
the "value added" to the products of number 2 field corn, which US farm
policy produces for the chains at almost no cost to them. These products are
carbs.

Obesity is more a problem at lower economic levels, due to

poptarts I would still be hungry.  Fatty foods don't leave you hungry
either so some choose to equate the problems with simple sugars to all
carb foods.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Other outcomes of low carb compared to low fat/higher carb give low carb
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the prize for longevity, CVD risk reduction, cancer prevention,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;particularly breast, ovarian, prostate and colon cancers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Even better reduce calories and lose weight.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Again, you have trivialized the problem. If that were easy, there would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;no problem at all.

&gt;&gt;You call eating less calories for the avg person easy?  Eating real
&gt;&gt;foods makes it impossible for me to consume more than 2500 calories a
&gt;&gt;day.  With exercise I am probably only getting 1500 a day.

&gt;Again, &quot;real foods&quot; are a great way to reduce caloric intake.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The preservation of lean body mass is a big point in favor of low carb.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I run 30 miles a week and eat plenty of carbs.  Something I could not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;do eating low carb because I tried it.  My muscles had no energy like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2 logs without a match.  You can be skinny but without exercise you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will be flabby and doughy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;People differ. What works for you will not work for everyone.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I suspect the %carbs has risen over the years, at least in the US. It's hard
&gt;&gt;&gt;to see how it could be otherwise, since the US government takes tax revenues
&gt;&gt;&gt;and uses a lot of them to produce unimaginable amounts of high fructose corn
&gt;&gt;&gt;syrup at give-away prices. A fast-food chain would be nuts not to be looking
&gt;&gt;&gt;for every way possible to use the gift from the taxpayers to induce more and
&gt;&gt;&gt;more consumption of a product they can get virtually for free and sell for
&gt;&gt;&gt;real money.

&gt;&gt;Well look at the fattest states like West Virginia.  What do they eat
&gt;&gt;in West Virginia?  Well gravy is considered a beverage.  Carbs are
&gt;&gt;hardly the problem there.

&gt;I think carbs are a big part of the problem there. It's not a wealthy state.
&gt;People are influenced by what the government chooses to provide at way below
&gt;real production costs: corn and corn products.
">

I think you are reaching here.  The fact is real food does cost more
as years ago the avg family spent 24% of their income on food it is
much lower now because people choose low price garbage.  I guess I
choose to have a more modest lifestyle and not look like a complete
mess with fancy clothes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;One reason the portion sizes have gone up is that inducing people to eat
&gt;&gt;&gt;more enables the chains to make more profit. Mostly, the profit comes from
&gt;&gt;&gt;the &quot;value added&quot; to the products of number 2 field corn, which US farm
&gt;&gt;&gt;policy produces for the chains at almost no cost to them. These products are
&gt;&gt;&gt;carbs.

&gt;&gt;People eat more that is the problem.

&gt;You are treating it as a primal cause that came from nowhere.
">

The problem is real foods don't care if you don't get hungry again in
3 hours.  Other plants and animals would probably prefer you don't get
hungry for a few days.  Poptarts etc are designed to leave you hungry
in a few hours so you will buy more of their garbage.  Anything low
carb tends to be real food because it leaves you less hungry.  So
people start to think all carbs are bad which is wrong.

The primal cause that encourages eating is no differen't than it was
decades ago when obesity rates were much less.  It is not due to more
carbs but more food.  Simple sugars allow you to eat more which causes
you to ingest more calories and become fat.  I suppose I could force
myself to eat tons of brown rice or beef or nuts so I was always
uncomfortably full and I would gain the same amount of weight if I got
those calories from simple sugars.  Simple sugars just makes it a lot
easier because they digest so easily.

: Study leader Christopher Gardner, a professor of medicine at Stanford
: University's Disease Prevention Research Center in California, told
: Britain's Sunday Times, "So many people have been asking questions
: about diets for years. We think it's time to give them some answers."
:
: When his study is published this week, it will show of the four
: regimes under review, the Atkins diet resulted in the greatest weight
: loss -- with no indication of undesirable side-effects.

There was allmost an equal study about one year ago which lasted also for
one year. In that study the low-carb diet did not produce greatest weight
loss. It was concluded that the commitment to follow any diet is what
counts.

I suspect that in this newer study those following the Atkins diet did get
particularly good instructions. The success is largely influenced by the
dietary advice given by the nutritionists in a study.

Generally speaking, I also suspect most people get particularly bad
instructions if they are just said "eat less calories" and given a typical
menu that is dull and boring. I guess they need a good chef more than a
dietician ;-)

Also, community support is key. Generally you find it (on the Internet,
friends, and so on) for popular diet books rather than for "official
diets".

Besides, popular diet books writers might be bad dieticians, perhaps, but
good motivational writers!

Differences in instructions given to diet groups is the most obvious reason

I agree. Nowadays people on low-carb diets get particularly good community

Differences in instructions? Please elaborate. Surely different diets
need different instructions. Different studies produce different
results for a number of reasons such as different populations,
variability in the adherence to the diet, variability in the diets,
different methods used, and chance, just to mention few.

The other study you refer to was published two years ago. What makes
you think that differences in instructions did not affect one way or
other then, if you think that they did now?

That they make the usual idiotic, ignorant statement that the brain

prefers ketones.  Once ketones are available, the brain needs may 40-60
grams of glucose per day, from protein.  What you quote is an excellent
