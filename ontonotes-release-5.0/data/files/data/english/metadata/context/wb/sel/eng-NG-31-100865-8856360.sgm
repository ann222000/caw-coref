&quot;I don't know how big you are, kiddo, so this may
not be as easy for you as it is for me, but use
a little &quot;knee action,&quot; that is, as the dog goes
charging by you, just give the dog a little bop
with your knee and shin.  Yep, really lean into it.

Even knock her over, if you can, but make sure to
make her think twice about rushing past you again -
- which is exactly what you want her to do.

Don't bother with scolding her, she'll get the message.

If it happens again, just REPEAT the knee action.

When she steps on your toes, just pick up your foot
abruptly and nudge her with your knee.  Again, no
scolding is necessary here, so you don't have to
worry about her &quot;over-reacting.&quot;

I don't think this is necessarily a lack of respect
for you, just a lack of training.  That is, she just
needs *more* of it.&quot;

&quot;My objective is always to find a way that WORKS.
And if it is DANGEROUS behavior that I'm trying
to modify, behavior than can get the dog KILLED,
I will resort to ANYTHING to save him.

A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G.

Okay.  Call me a cruel, inhumane, abusive bastard
if you want to, but it doesn't affect me at all.
When you've saved the lives of as many dogs as I
have, you'll learn that that's the only thing that
really matters.  Saving lives and making dogs become

On a cold day in Hell, Fri, 24 Jan 1997 12:53:10

Teaching a puppy to stop biting and nipping people is
probably the very easiest thing you will ever do as a dog
trainer.  Don't make such a big deal out of it.

It's E-A-S-Y, but it won't be done in just one or
two  lessons.  You must be C-O-N-S-I-S-T-E-N-T.

And P-A-T-I-E-N-T.

Whenever your puppy bites or nips you (or anyone else
in your family), do any one of the following:

1.) At the same time you say &quot;NO BITE!&quot;  in a firm voice,
gently but firmly tap your puppy on its nose with your index
finger.

2.) At the same time you say &quot;NO BITE!&quot; in a firm voice,
gently but firmly grasp your puppy's lower jaw with your
right hand (if you are right handed), your right thumb stuck
down and under her tongue, your other fingers wrapped
under her jaw, and gently but firmly shake her jaw back
and forth a couple of times.

3.) At the same time you say &quot;NO BITE!&quot; in a firm voice,
gently place a couple of fingers into her mouth, trying to
touch the back of her tongue with them, initiating a gag
reflex.

Immediately after doing any one of the above, stop
playing with her for at least 15-20 minutes and completely
IGNORE her.  Do not even make eye contact!

I promise you, Phil, that if you will be consistent in
the application of the above, your puppy will soon stop
nipping and biting people. Just how soon this occurs
depends upon the puppy, how well you execute the above,
and how C-O-N-S-I-S-T-E-N-T you are.

And no one should be allowed to play with the puppy
who is not capable of doing  any of the above.   Not
until she has first learned not to nip and bite people.

&quot;At the very FIRST nip, tap your puppy on his nose with
your index finger, sharply, but not very hard, your face in
his face, and say &quot;NO BITE!&quot; in a firm but not loud voice.&quot;

&quot;With your index finger, tap the puppy on her nose firmly,
but not harshly, then, at the very same time, and nose to
nose with her, tell your puppy in a firm but not loud voice,
&quot;NO BITE!&quot;

&quot;At the same time you say &quot;NO BITE!&quot; in a firm voice,
gently but firmly tap your puppy on its nose with your
index finger.&quot;

BUT NEVER HIT YOUR DOG~!

Swatting a dog on the nose is always the
wrong thing to do.

IMO, the *fastest* way to curb a mouthy puppy's
desire to bite  hands (especially if other methods
have failed, because you don't want this habit to
become reinforced by too much success), etc., is
to take  advantage of the pup's gag reflex:

Slowly reach over and around the pup's shoulder
(while you're sitting  on the floor), coming up to
the pup's mouth from underneath it with  your
right hand (that way he can't see your finger or
your hand), and  stick your index finger into the
pup's mouth, at the very rear, then  down the
pup's throat, and gently place some downward
pressure on the  back of the tongue, until he starts
to gag. Use your left arm to hold  him close to you,
while you're doing this.

Trust me, it's easier to  demonstrate this technique
than to explain it, but it's fail-proof.

He'll quickly put 2 and 2 together.  Biting hands = gag.

From: diddy

Date: 2002-05-31 14:49:22 PST

Actually, I borrowed the vets office kitten once for a
couple days for school education on pet care and safe
handling as well as responsible pet ownership.

I kept the kitten over night in a crate within a crate
and yet my dog (yes,  Angelic Danny, as well as Taya
and Toby tore that kittne to threads from between the
crate bars. (apparently he stuck his paws through the
crate to bat at the dogs. I was out doing yard work
and rushed in to find the little kittens pieces and
parts being torn through by ALL the dogs.

I called my girl friend to come get my dogs. I screamed
displeasure, and stalked out with the kitten. Danny, et
al spent 3 days in a kennel until I finally felt like I
could interact with them without doing bodily harm. All
three dogs were never touched, but knew they had done
something so unspeakable that I wouldn't associate with
them and they got banished.

To this day, Taya (mom and Dad's dog) and Danny
will not look at a cat. When confronted with one,
Danny wees himself and cowers hiding behind me
for help.

I'm not saying this would work this way with all dogs,
But mom and dad now have a house cat, and she has
never been harmed by any of the dogs. Danny is there
all the time, unsupervised, and has no interest in harming
the cat.

as a punishment and can produce extensive and
persistent aggression (Azrin et al, 1966).&quot;

&quot;The IMBECILITY of some of the claims for

developing imitative speech in two severly

&quot;It is NO WONDER that the marked changes in
deviant behavior of children can be achieved
through brief, simple educative routines with
their mothers which modify the mother's social
behaviors shaping the child (Whaler, 1966).

Some clinics have reported ELIMINATION of the
need for child THERAPY through changing the
clinical emphasis from clinical to parental
HANDLING of the child (Szrynski 1965).

A large number of cases improved sufficiently
after preliminary contact with parents that NO
treatment of children was required, and almost
ALL cases SHOWE a remarkably shortened
period for therapy.

Quite severe cases of anorexia nervosa have been
treated in one to five months by simply REPLACING
the parents temporarily with EFFUSIVELY LOVING

I guess if I felt Danny was threatened, it's the way
I would react. There would be none left standing
to deal with the threat just in case.

If someone hurt him, I would not let borders or
continents stop me from pursuing justice.

Then again, I always feed Danny INSIDE. If
someone is feeding his dog outside, his own
dog might not mean THAT much to him.

If he was feeding his dog outside though, many
dogs are food aggressive, and that could most
certainly spark a dog aggression thing.

(and if the dog was penned quietly outside, what
was it doing in his yard?)

I shot a neighbors dog one night for chasing my
horses and called him to help me find it. I would
do the same for threatening my dog.

My husband shot a dog that had been tearing up
trash up and down our road for years making an
unbelievable mess.

When we finally killed the culprit, the whole road
cheered. Animal control had never been able in
years to catch this critter. (we think it was feral it
was certainly unkempt enough to have been....
and it had been shot at by MANY of the neighbors,
but it never frightened it off enough to keep it from

Two nights ago, Reka started acting frantic about 11pm.
I let her out. It's coyote breeding season, and she is
fascinated by them. I assumed she wanted to go out and
listen to them howling. I brought her in, and she spent
the night franticly and desperately demanding to go out.

After about 4am, I finally put her in the barn, locked
securely in a horse stall for the night.

She came in by morning, and had a normal active, playful
day. Last night, at 11pm, She franticly DEMANDED to go
out. I let her out, and brought her in. At midnight, she
DEMANDED to be let out. I let her out, but I went out
to the barn and got a crate, and decided she could
spend the rest of the night in the crate. We were NOT
going to do a repeat of the previous night AGAIN.

At 3am, she whined so loudly, I then decided not to
allow her to set a precedence of this type of behavior.
So I took her crate out to the heated gun shop and
decided to let her act out her bad behavior in peace,
and send a message that her obnoxious behavior
was not going to be tolerated.

This morning at 6am, I went out, and she had vomited
(normal looking dog food) and defecated in her crate
(not normal for Reka, but then, She normally didn't
sleep in a crate, NEVER gets corrected (she never does
anything to GET corrected for) and was probably nerves
from the outside experience, plus reprimand and solitary
confinement.)

I let her in the house while I cleaned the cage. Hoping
I had made my point. She acted healthy and normal, and
playful and chipper. But then I noticed a spot of blood on
the bathroom linoleum and in the bathtub. I was the last to
take a bath, so I knew REKA was the last in the tub.

That blood didnt come from me, so it HAD to come from
Reka. Thinking about her nearing the end of her heat cycle,
I still didnt think a lot about it. I thought her obnoxious
behavior the past couple nights WAS her heat cycle..
and corresponding coyote breeding season.

Then while feeding her breakfast, I saw the whole story.
She had blood (fresh) streaming from her RECTUM. UhOh.

I had her at the vets office this morning before he
opened. He just said her intestines were all bunched
up with huge air pockets.

Was there any chance that she ate strings of carpets? I
said, last Thursday we took a plastic tarp out of the yard
that we had over the grill to protect it from the weather
because she was chewing it. That would explain
EVERYTHING.

The  strings are binding and bunching up her intestines,
cutting her internally and tying her intestines in knots as
it works its way through.

Reka is in a very critical situation. She is going to
require extensive and expensive surgery that I cant
afford. I will manage.

Even with the surgery, her condition will be critical
for awhile. Scary thoughts. I would never have
treated her the way I did last night, if I had even a
clue that she was sick. I feel so badly.

Regarding this cat in the snare. It went nuts. It
leaped, and tangled itself, and most certainly
strangulated it's intestines. It had the snare
pulled tight down to the diameter of a dime (just
large enough to encircle the spine) around the waist
area. This cats snarled, and attacked. Trying to
extricate this cat was exceedingly difficult, not to
mention dangerous. Because I feared damage to the
intestines and death of the gut, I imagined
this cat was not likely to survive.

It would have been much simpler to dispatch the
unfortunate cat and take out the dead body. Instead,
this cat wore a collar. it deserved a chance, and
the owner deserved closure. (no id on the collar) .

It escaped, just as I released it and it couldn't be
taken to the vet for examination. I will probably
never know if this particular cat survives the
experience or not.

People in the area were aware that trapping was
being done and apparently still let their cats run
free, both endangered by the traps and by the
coyotes being targeted that are causing a problem
with their cat population.

Had that cat not been wearing a collar, I would not
have tried to release this hostile cat. Releasing it
may not have been a kindness, but then... cats
weren't supposed to be attracted to this type of
trap, in this position, and then they weren't
supposed to go ape, to get themselves in this

If you are upset I advise you to keep your dogs at home.

As i repeated before, the time Danny and Taya got loose,
for all the dangers they faced out there, cars, disease,
coyotes, etc, the most immediate danger they were in,
was being shot.

This is why I immediately started canvassing the area
with full color door to door handouts emblazoned with
REWARD. DO NOT SHOOT these dogs across the top.

I knew every second they were loose, they were in grave
danger of being shot. At that time, Our dog pound was
on 20/20 for being one of the worst in the country (it's
not now, it's a modern model facility) i WANTED my
dogs there.

It meant they weren't out there being shot.

They would throw dogs in  pens of 10-20 dogs, In spite
of the dirt and filth, if they got there, I had a chance of
recovery.

Roaming in this area is a very bad thing,
and people WILL shoot dogs.

Happens all the time.

If you like your dog, you keep it home.

A persons personal animals are more valueable to
them than your animal you don't think enough of to
keep at home.

(They were taught NEVER EVER to step on a road.... No foot
EVER touches the road!) Danny lost a tracking test once, because
the test crossed a seldom used gravel road. When he reached the
road, a car just happened to go by. He refused to cross the road,
and when I took him by the collar and nudged him, I was
Disqualified for aiding the dog. Danny simply will NOT cross a
road.. when he was intact, not EVEN for a bitch in season.

Now you have a dog that...

WHOOOOPS!

Whoops, Danny And Taya run away from
unsecured yard and imbecile owner BUT
CAREFULLY AVOID CROSSIN A ROAD.

Will they survive life out in the wilderness
out amongst diddler's coyote traps?

Will they get mistaken for coyotes and sold
to the highest bidder at the fur auction?

Or will they live again to do a help dummy diddy
do a demonstration on safe and responsible pet
ownership in the kitchen with the vet's office kitten?

You'd think her SEARCH AND RESCUE dog could
find his own way back to his own HOWES, provided
they ain't gotta CROSS A ROAD AGAIN gettin back???

&gt; as well as service dog trained, CDX, etc.

But IT can't find ITS way back to his own HOWES?

&gt; He does all the things that service dogs do

Like run HOWET on his people and not return?

&gt; from opening doors, turning on lights, getting

You FORGOT MURDERIN the vet's office kitty kat

gettin locked in a box in an HOWEtbuilding to muffle
his CRYING till he was SHITTIN BLOOD and went
in for intestinal obstruction surgery.

close, the whole experience was not among my

I needed to redirect his energies. He used escape for
entertainment. Once I gave him very many jobs to do,
and taught him LOTS of positive job skills to redirect
his energies.  Once he found positive alternatives, he
finally forgot his negative behaviors which were severely
entrenched by the time I got him.

The first 6 months were awful for both of us.

All the &quot;awful&quot;-ness was caused by diddy. Just as all

He trashed my horse stall.

He then got a new horse stall, wore a E-collar,
I electrified the perimeter of the stall and we
were finally able to contain him while we worked
on his escape problems.

Once he learned that I was more determined to
defeat him, he finally subdued. But escaping, to
him was a game.

Both of us had a throughly miserable time during
the stand off. The dog is actually now a very good
citizen. He just had to meet someone more determined,
and stubborn and willing to go the distance to do what it
took, before he would stop.

Like I said, I thought he and I were going

&gt; Do we have a report from today yet? I read the one
&gt; where he's a bit better....
">

His prognosis is really poor, even though his vital
signs are still good. he can walk to go out to potty,
but he's so painful he didn't want to. he's miserable
but drugged to the gills. He met me with a meekly
wagging tail. his face is swollen and his legs are
swollen, because he does not have the body protein
to assimilate the fluids.

When they did the surgery, his intestines were all
stuck together in one big adhesion.  His intestines
were even stuck to his bladder, and they pulled them
all apart, but they wanted to glue themselves back
almost immediately. if they do that, he will die. And
this is what they were trying to do during the surgery.

I asked him if this is the case, why didn't we just put
him down? I don't want him hurting like this, if he's
not going to survive it anyway.   He said &quot;no,  beca....&quot;
and I didn't hear the rest, the room got all green and
hazy and I had to sit down on the floor before I passed
out. So I really don't know why we are fighting to save
him if his prognosis is so poor.  I told the vet to stop
talking.

He has peritonitis , no penetrations were evident from
the chicken bones, but we are assuming it was related
to the chicken wings. But he is also showing bone
anomalies similar to those dogs with a viral infection.
Viral infections can also cause abdominal adhesions.
so there were biopsies sent off for culture and testing.

He's also a low birthweight puppy, and my vet  has
suspected there was a viral infection going on since
birth, even before he was born, because of lack of
bone development on the xrays. when he looked at
the prenatal xrays, he felt this litter was in trouble.

when they were low birthweight, he has been working
on that hunch, and he's been treating this pup from the
beginning as a suspect viral issue with an immune
mediated response.

his breeder calls my vet an idiot.

The massive adhesions he found also increased his
suspicions that this was not just the chicken bones
but an ongoing problem.

he wanted to do the biopsy and i told him NO.  (he
tends to test and test as if my dogs were lab rats) I
need this dog fixed, and regardless of the cause, the
treatment is the same. he says he needs to know and
is paying for the test himself. he says this information
may be critical to his sister (who is not exhibiting any
problems btw) so he can suspect whatever he wants,
but i think he's looking for zebras, when he's actually
looking at a horse.

The lab work he is doing will confirm his hunch. it's
his dime. If he's right, Della (his sister) will also need
to know. if he's wrong, it hasn't hurt anything, and it
didn't cost me a dime.

If he had a small pinhole leak from the bones, it could
also have set up the massive peritonitis. Frankly, he ate
the chicken wing, and was sick the next day. Sometimes
a horse is just a horse.

He started telling me how they handled the adhesion
binding and why he shouldn't be given up on, and
why he thought he had a chance, but I honestly didn't
hear it, and asked him to stop talking, because the fear
of losing my little guy was just so overwhelming, that
I couldn't take any more. the room was spinning, I was
about to wretch and pass out.

I never heard what he had done to prevent that. He was
about to give me the good news, but I never heard it. The
bad news was so bad, I just wasn't in condition to
assimilate any more.

This little guy was very similar to his Dad. They even
keep calling him Danny in the clinic, because he looks
just like him. He's been a remarkable puppy, and shows
endless talent.

We tried out for Ohio Task force one a couple weeks
ago, and he was the youngest one there by eight months!

And he did the best job of anyone. I was soooooo proud
of him. I was  very proud of his performance. he's been
a delight to train with no  apparent fears, tons of courage,
biddability, and desire to please.

I decided not to follow that route because orientation
tapes renewed old memories that reminded me even
if I could (which I had doubts) do the work, I was not
willing to put my dog at risk to the hazards that Task
force One dogs are subject to.

He takes his tasks willingly and seriously .. he's a lot
like his dad. He's a very talented tracking dog, a
wonderful gentleman, consummate clown, noble
companion, loyal friend, and helpful assistant.

It's hard to believe that you can get so attached so fast.
He feels to everyone who meets him as a continuum of
his father, with the stability of his mother. He runs out
to the road, gets the newspaper and brings it in as one
of his favorite tasks. He looks for jobs he can do, and
picks up all the dog pans after eating, and hands them
to me, just like his dad did. He's constantly on the prowl
looking for something he can do where he can help.

He fills all the places that his dad used to be. No he
won't replace his dad, but he's filled the huge gaping
chasm that his dad left, and eased the hurt, and created
joy.

He also has his joyful moments. He likes to ride in the
car, and adjusts the air vents to blow in his face. He
hasn't learned to turn the cold control knobs yet, or he
would turn the car into a mobile igloo. He has learned
to operate door knobs, and nothing is out of his reach
unless crated.

Leaving the house for a few minutes and coming in to
his surprises such as finding bras dangling from ceiling
fans, and his projects strewn from one end of the house
to the other, or finding him all wrapped up in venetian
blinds as he tried to follow my progress outside, reminds
me he is NOT his dad, and is his ownunique personality.

Although I might look at his antics with discernment,
afterwards, it's good for a chuckle.

He's a puppy after all, and needs to be contained
when he's not being supervised.
