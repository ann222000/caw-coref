Rep. Romanoff Reporting - Sept. 12, 2007 - Lame Duck

Dear Dianne,

Maybe it's time I grew a beard.

Two-and-a-half years into my term, I've been having a hard time persuading anyone that I'm really the speaker of the House.  &quot;Are you kidding?&quot; one person recently asked me.  &quot;I was expecting someone a lot older,&quot; said another.  &quot;You don't seem that important,&quot; sniffed a third.

I could carry a gavel but I'd rather not have to use it.

SUNDAY IN THE PARK

Do you live in House District 6?  Are you willing to move?  Do you like to eat?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, you're invited to a potluck picnic on Sunday, Sept. 16, from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., at Cook Park (Monaco and Mexico), Shelter #1.  Soft drinks will be provided; please bring a dish to share.

The unmistakably Democratic organizers also suggest bringing reusable plates and utensils &quot;to cut down on landfill waste&quot; - now there's an appetizing thought.

HOW I SPENT MY SUMMER VACATION

Do kids still have to write essays like that?  I'd flunk.

Fortunately, the Rocky Mountain News and the Denver Post provided rough drafts.  Click here, here and here to follow the visits my colleagues and I recently made to some of Colorado's poorest school districts.

That so many of Colorado's schools are in substandard condition is not news.  The State Auditor released a report to that effect in 2003, and advocacy groups such as Great Education Colorado and Children's Voices have been pushing for improvements for years.  In 2000, Colorado settled the Giardino lawsuit, agreeing to invest $190 million in the most critical school-construction projects; the state has not yet completed payment.

What's missing now is a statewide assessment of our schools' capital needs, as well as the development of a strategy for meeting them.  Those are among our next steps.

FALL FORWARD

Three major panels are preparing recommendations this fall, just in time for next year's legislative session:

(1)  The legislature created a Blue Ribbon Commission for Health Care Reform last year to study models for expanding health care coverage, especially for the underinsured and uninsured, and for decreasing health care costs for Colorado residents.  The Commission's 27 members - appointed by legislative leaders from both parties and by Govs. Owens and Ritter - have been meeting for the past 10 months.  They narrowed an initial list of 31 proposals to four and are currently developing a fifth.  The Commission will host 14 community meetings next month; click here for the schedule.  The Commission's final report is due on January 31, 2008.

(2)  Gov. Ritter announced the formation of a Transportation Finance and Implementation Panel in March.  Its 32 members are scheduled to recommend transportation project priorities and strategies to fund those projects in November.  Click here for the panel's schedule.

(3)  Gov. Ritter appointed a P-20 Education Coordinating Council in June.  Its mission: &quot;to ensure Colorado's educational systems from pre-school to grade 20 are seamless, are aligned along an 'education highway' and are meeting the needs of today's employers.&quot;  The Council consists of 32 members and five subcommittees - on Dropout Prevention and Recovery, P-3, Data and Accountability, Preparation and Transitions, and Educator Recruitment, Preparation and Retention.  The Council's first set of recommendations is expected in November.

And while we're on the subject, several other committees are crafting legislative recommendations.  Click on the links below to learn more about each, or click here for an overview of these interim committees.

Health Care Task Force

Long-Term Care Health Care Services and Support to Persons with Developmental Disabilities Committee

Mental Illness in the Criminal Justice System

Police Officers and Firefighters Pension Reform Commission

Severance Tax and Federal Mineral Lease Revenue Allocation

Transportation Legislation Review Committee

Water Resources Review Committee

All of the committees' meetings are open to the public.

Have a good week - and for those celebrating a new year, a happy and healthy 5768!

Sincerely, Andrew

&gt; &gt;coverage, especially for the underinsured and uninsured, and for
&gt; decreasing
&gt; &gt;health care costs for Colorado residents.  The Commission's 27 members -
&gt; &gt;appointed by legislative leaders from both parties and by Govs. Owens and
&gt; &gt;Ritter - have been meeting for the past 10 months.  They narrowed an
&gt; initial
&gt; &gt;list of 31 proposals to four and are currently developing a fifth.  The
&gt; &gt;Commission will host 14 community meetings next month; click here for the
&gt; &gt;schedule.  The Commission's final report is due on January 31, 2008.

&gt; &gt;                  (2)  Gov. Ritter announced the formation of a
&gt; &gt;Transportation Finance and Implementation Panel in March.  Its 32 members
&gt; are
&gt; &gt;scheduled to recommend transportation project priorities and strategies to
&gt; &gt;fund those projects in November.  Click here for the panel's schedule.

&gt; &gt;                  (3)  Gov. Ritter appointed a P-20 Education Coordinating
&gt; &gt;Council in June.  Its mission: &quot;to ensure Colorado's educational systems
&gt; from
&gt; &gt;pre-school to grade 20 are seamless, are aligned along an 'education
&gt; highway'
&gt; &gt;and are meeting the needs of today's employers.&quot;  The Council consists of
&gt; 32
&gt; &gt;members and five subcommittees - on Dropout Prevention and Recovery, P-3,
&gt; &gt;Data and Accountability, Preparation and Transitions, and Educator
&gt; &gt;Recruitment, Preparation and Retention.  The Council's first set of
&gt; &gt;recommendations is expected in November.

&gt; &gt;                  And while we're on the subject, several other committees
&gt; &gt;are crafting legislative recommendations.  Click on the links below to
