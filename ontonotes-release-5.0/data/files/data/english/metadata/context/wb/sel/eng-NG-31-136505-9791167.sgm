GLENN BECK PROGRAM
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT   GLENN: I want to play this segment from television last night, in case you didn't hear it. And then I'd like to hear how you feel about it. I'd like -- I would really like to hear from people talking me down from the tree. I would like to hear from people who say that this is not exactly why we find ourself in a situation to where I'd like to take out a frickin' quill pen and write the Declaration of Independence. I would really like to hear from you, and you tell me how I misread the arrogance of this congressman last night.

Last night I did a special, an hour-long special. It's our first in a series that is coming. And don't miss a single episode of radio or television next week because I'm going to start to uncover the stuff that -- because I can't take it anymore. Start to uncover the stuff that I think is really going on. I'm sorry, but I no longer believe that the people in Washington have our best interests at heart when it comes to the border. I don't believe that any of them -- well, I can't say any of them. I can't believe the majority of them are actually trying to solve this problem. It is a combination of arrogance, it is a combination of ignorance, apathy on their part, not ours.

There is Rasmussen -- I talked to Scott Rasmussen a couple of days ago. He is going to release a poll early next week. Let me spoil this for you, for him. He will be on the program to give us the poll numbers themselves, but there is no disconnect between the Republicans. The Republicans are not split on illegal immigration. When you poll Republicans in the country, they are not split. There is a split in the Democratic party. There is a sharp divide in the Democratic voters on illegal immigration, not in the Republicans. The Republicans are in lock step, fix the border. The majority of Democrats are also saying fix the border. It's a small minority of Democratic voters that don't want the border fixed. So where is this real divide in America? We're not divided on the border, at least in America. We're divided from our leadership. Our leadership is no longer answering to us on this and they think they have the power. They think they have the answer. I want you to listen.

Last night I had -- I had people on the program that it's taken me a couple of weeks to convince a couple of these people to actually come on the air with me. I was on the air the night before last, or I was on a conference call the night before last begging a guy, please come on; I'll protect, I will protect your identity; no one will know. &quot;I can't, I can't, I can't. Glenn, I'll get nailed by the Government because the Government doesn't want you to know this stuff, and if they don't nail me, I live down at the border. They will kill me.&quot; And he didn't mean the Government. He meant Mexicans.

There is -- I'm sitting there and I'm putting this on the air and people are risking their life to speak out. A sheriff who is on the border in Laredo, Texas. Can you imagine? By the way, just across the river if you are the sheriff of Laredo, you have a life expectancy of 25 hours. Just across the border where everything is great, the sheriff is fighting crime. 70 people have been kidnapped from his city. He's doing everything he can. If you saw him on television, you could see he's not working in a state-of-the-art sheriff's office. We put a truck down there in front of the sheriff's office and so we brought a live shot in from there. A few minutes later I had some people who had family members kidnapped. 70, 70 Americans have been kidnapped and killed in the last two years. That's more than the Iranians took in 1979. And yet we've made calls to family member after family member after family member. Most of them won't come on television because they will say to you --
they will cry on the phone and say, &quot;I can't, I've got other children, I've got to protect the rest of my family, I can't leave here. You don't know what it's like here.&quot; These are Americans in an American city.

So I have the share-a-thon and we're -- the congressman talks about how great it is that we're going to give $1.5 billion and we're going to give helicopters and we're going to give state-of-the-art eavesdropping equipment to the Mexican military. Earlier in the program I showed you a Mexican ID, a Mexican military ID. I didn't show you last night -- can't be cleared yet -- the night vision film of the Mexican military 60 miles past our border. I couldn't show you, because it hasn't been cleared yet, the heads that were rolled into a nightclub and left on a nightclub floor because people oppose these gangs. I talked to a sheriff who stood down the Mexican military as the Mexican military took their 50 caliber machine guns and turned them around and pointed them at the U.S. sheriff to protect the drug cartels and the drug runners. And this sheriff is saying, I need help, I need help. And the congressman is saying, well, we're giving that help to Mexico because we can trust
Mexico. We're not going to put troops down on the border. We don't need troops. We'll give the money to Mexico. And here's what happened, and I want your response on this. You tell me how I misread this. Listen to this.

GLENN: Sheriff, I want to change the subject here and I'm sorry. I've got to go to the hostages. Can you please --

SHERIFF: I need to say one -- I need to say one thing, Glenn.

GLENN: Okay.

SHERIFF: I want to ask the congressman who is he representing, President Calderon or his district here in Laredo, Texas where we haven't received any resources at the local level to be able to combat the problems on the border.

CONGRESSMAN CUELLAR: Well, first of all, let me say this, Mr. Sheriff. What we're looking at is you have got more money than you've ever gotten in the past and we've got to keep in mind that the border will be patrolled by the border patrol and by the federal agencies. We will work with the local law enforcement and we represent, but your job is to be a county sheriff, not a U.S. congressman, which is a big difference. My job is to look at the big picture. Your job is to look at the smaller picture, and I will do my job as long as you do your job.

GLENN: Boy, congressman, I don't think I have ever --

SHERIFF: I'd like to find out how much money has the congressman allocated to our county. How much money have you allocated for border security for Webb County or from the counties from Brownsville all the way to California? How much money have they allocated for border security? Nothing. They've allocated money --

GLENN: I've got to get to the hostages, guys. I have to tell you, Congressman, shame on you for that response. That was the most belittling responsive ever heard. Shame on you.

CONGRESSMAN CUELLAR: Well, let me --

GLENN: No, sir, I'm going to change the subject now. You've had your peace. Let's talk about the 70 people that have been kidnapped now.

GLENN: Stop. In that same interview he just said -- I said, why aren't we putting our military on the border. We have 70 Americans that have been kidnapped. Why aren't we putting our military on the border? He said, well, we're just not going to do that, that's just out of the question.

Now let me go to another guy. Now, this guy is a conservative. Let me go to this guy who we had on. This is from the Heritage Foundation about giving Mexico $1.5 billion in military aid, in training, in operations, in helicopters. It's mind boggling. Listen to what this guy said.

VOICE: Well, you know, Glenn this is not your father's Mexico. Mexico is grown up. Mexico is an emerging market and a dynamic globalized economy. There is a strong vibrant middle class that wants to do better. They are sick of the corrupt politicians and --

GLENN: Stop. I can't take it anymore. I'm sorry. It's a vibrant economy? It's not my father's Mexico? You're right. It's not my father's Mexico. In my father's Mexico, I felt comfortable going down. This is just the Mexico that is allowing people to behead people. This is the one where the military is actively engaged with drug cartels. This is the Mexico that the -- shoot, the Department of State -- I'm trying to remember what this guy's name is -- the attorney general in Mexico has said they have lost control of many of the states of Mexico to the drug cartels. This is the Mexico, as I had a sheriff present on the TV show last night, that is literally feeding people that stand in the way of these drug cartels to lions, 19 miles south of our border. This is the Mexico that makes Escape from New York look pleasant. This is the Mexico that our State Department has warned Americans: You know what, be very careful if you go down to Mexico. This is the Mexico that I can no
longer travel to Puerto Vallarta and feel comfortable if I'm just an average American. This is the Mexico that now has the drug cartels so weaponized. They have grenade launchers, rocket launchers, they have -- you know when you're pulled over by a cop and they have a little computer there? In Mexico they now have these SUVs and they pull up into America that they can access people's property taxes to find out exactly how much you make, to get some idea. They're called drive-by kidnappings. They pull you in off the street. They check the tax records. If you're worth anything, they do a quicky kidnapping and call and extort the money from your family: &quot;We need $10,000 and we need it right now. Great, put it into this bank account, good. They watch it in the car, they get the money transferred. When the money is there, they kick your relative out of the car.&quot; Drive-by kidnappings. That ain't my father's Mexico. You're right. But we're being sold this load of goods that
they're a good neighbor. Really? Tell me what the hell Mexico has done for us lately. Tell me what Mexico has done. Here's what Mexico has done. They've taken their citizens and they have printed brochures how to get across our border and then they have taken their citizens, the poorest of the poor, and they have shipped them to us because we're the second largest bankroll in their country. Their people shipping money back that they are making here under the table illegally is the second largest source of income in all of Mexico. Only, only beaten by oil. And why are they doing it? Because they can't handle their own corruption, they can't handle their own problems, they can't handle their own economy and they're taking the poorest of the poor and they're helping them. Can you imagine if we did that to Canada? Oh, how sweet things would be if we didn't have to worry about all of the healthcare problems, all of the problems of the poorest of the poor. If we could just give
them maps to Canada and help them across the border into Canada where they could get on Canada's socialized healthcare. Then we wouldn't have to worry about it. That's exactly what Mexico is doing to us. You tell me how they're a good neighbor. I'm sorry, but I have had it up to here with this Mexico garbage, and the more I look into it, the more dismayed I am because we're being sold out for the -- excuse me. I almost swore, and I don't swear. We're being sold out for the gosh darn almighty dollar. We are being sold out by global corporations and politicians and internationalists. There's no frickin' reason why we've got a damn near border war going on and nobody wants to solve it. There's no reason for it.

Don't tell me that I'm based in hatred in Mexicans because that's not true. I have more compassion for the poor of Mexico than everybody else who's fighting against border security. Why? Because what we are doing to the poorest of the poor in Mexico by having them live here in the shadows is nothing less than modern day slavery.

When I read an article in the Westchester Times -- I'm sorry, the Westchester magazine, Westchester County is where the Clintons live. It's in New York. It's one of the wealthiest counties in all of America. When I read an article about illegal immigration, where they talk about how important it is for our economy, where they talk about just here in Westchester, there are restaurants that you eat at all the time and if you shut down the illegal immigrants, if you just ship them all home, there would be nobody to bus your tables. There would be nobody to go chop the onions. And then without any kind of look at the morality of it, they just talked about what it's like for these illegal aliens to live here: &quot;They're working so hard and you know how they have to live?&quot; Now, remember this is one of the wealthiest counties in the country. So imagine the average salary for an illegal alien, for an illegal alien is $15,000, in the richest county. So you know just to live in this
part of the country, if you are a family of four and you live in New York City, the average family of four has to make $150,000 to live, not live well, to live. These people make $15,000 a year. They are living -- they are literally renting a bed. There are people, there are dirtbag people that will rent beds to them and they only have it for eight hours. They rent that bed out 24 hours a day in eight hour shifts. When their eight hours are up, get your butt out of bed. Can you imagine living your life like that? And without any kind of ties to morality. This magazine was going on about your onions and the price of your food and who would bus your table. This is slavery, man. I'll pay more. It's wrong! And how is it the conservatives are losing that battle? How is it the conservatives, they look like hate mongers. To say it's wrong to have people live in the shadows, it is wrong to have companies get rich on the back of people who can't speak English, have no shot at the
American dream because they're living in the shadows. They came here across the border illegally because their own government won't take care of them down in Mexico and their own government is encouraging them to come here. Meanwhile, their own government is in bed with drug cartels where I can get 500 kilos of crystal meth from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico without any problem the next morning, 500 kilos. And we're going to give them listening devices. We're going to give them black helicopters. We're going to give them state-of-the-art technology and here's the best part. We're going to give them computer programs so they can access more information, but the United States government has insisted that all those databases remain in English. The only time this country has ever demanded that anything is in English is now, while we give them $1.5 billion? I don't think so. Phone calls coming up in just a second. Here is our -- I'm sorry. I'm pissed off beyond belief.    END TRANSCRIPT
