FAQ

A simple list of questions that people asked us about the
Satanic Brethren follows. This also means it's never finished,
because there are milliards of different people and therefor
milliards of different questions. Of all these questions we
choose the most frequently asked questions and add them on
this list.

1.1: Are you affiliated with the CoS, FCoS, ToS etc. ?

No we are not affiliated with any group or organization. The
Satanic Brethren Is not part of any other organization. The
SB does not discriminate people on the fact that they are a
member of any other Satanic group or org.

1.2: But I read something different on the SKO website...

We are, since January 2002, not a part of the Satanic
Kindred Organization any longer.

1.3: But the CoS and the FCoS are at war.....right?

They compete yes. The SB tries to stay out of their
business. We have members from many orgs. What we do demand
is respect for each other no matter what group your in.

1.4: Rumors say that you and the True Satanist Horde are at
war as well...

No, we had our differences in the past. But after a good
talk between the SB and The TSH council we agreed that this
was getting us nowhere. This behavior was also the opposite
of our goals. Namely to strengthen the ties between the
Dutch Satanic Organizations. Most of the troubles were based
on miscommunications and rumors, this is something we should
never follow. Satanist strive for conclusions based on the
truth, the truth how they see it, after a throughout
investigation instead of being led by rumors.

2.1: Where are those orgies they are all talking about?

-sigh- Lets repeat this again: Satanists don't do orgies! At
least not in this group. The meetings are just for members
only. If you do want to find any sexual site I suggest you
go to a search engine and try the word &quot;sex&quot;.

2.2: How about privacy?

We respect the privacy of our members, and most of them go
under a nickname. Not every member is on our profile site
because of privacy reasons. Information like phone numbers,
addresses, applications, etc will not be given to a third
party and we suggest to always keep that information to
yourself and not hand out any numbers or addresses on the
Messageboard or guestbook.

2.3: How do I get a title?

You don't. The titles that June and Xarian have, are because
they are the founders. The SB does not hand out any titles.
We do have positions like &quot;webmaster&quot; and &quot;photographer&quot;,
there are only three persons with this &quot;job&quot;. The SB doesn't
have any elite position, we are all the same. Satanists are
all leaders, and leading a group of leaders will only result
in difficulties, one of the reasons why there are so many
small Satanic groups out there.

3.1: I have to write an essay on Satanism. Can you guys get
me some information?

Yes that's a possibility, but you have to take the time to
browse and read this website first. There's a lot of
information on it. So if we get any questions regarding
Satanism and the answers are right on this website, we are
not gonna answer it for you. If you do have any questions
after reading all of this you can always send an email to:
magistra-j ... @satanisme.nl

3.2: You'll all burn in HELL!

These kinds of emails, messages, guestbook entries, etc will
be simply deleted. But if you do want to convert us, go
ahead. We always appreciate a good laugh.

3.3: My book or videoreview is not on the site!

That's possible. We only publish those who have anything to
do with Satanism, the occult or any other religious theme.
If not, it won't be placed on this site. Of course we could
do a report on every movie there is, but if we wanted to do
that we would make a site about movies.

3.4: You guys all play AD&amp;D right?

Nice joke. Some Christians are trying to make every nice
(kids)game look Satanic. Well no. Role-playing, Magic the
Gathering, AD&amp;D, Pokemon en everything else that has
anything to do with this is entertainment and a game.
Nothing more then that! Some people don't even know these
games, but anything that has to do with demons or weird
creatures is probably demonic and there for Satanic...

this first part of this FAQ was created by
Magistra June &amp; Rev Xarian.

=========================================================

4.1: How many Satanic Organizations are there?

A lot. Some years ago, approximately around 1980, a lot of
satanic organizations were founded. But through time a lot
of them didn't make it, and some new ones were formed. It's
very difficult to keep updated on them. Here you'll find
more information on some Satanic organizations.

4.2: Which organization is the best?

It depends on your expectations. Some people are just happy
being a member; others want meetings and group rituals.
Every organization has it's own policy, and attracts
different kinds of people. If you want to join an
organization find out which one is best for you.

4.3: Why are there so many different organizations?

Difference on opinions. Every human being is different, so
the interpretation on Satanism is also different. They
always have the same base though, like Crowley's laws, or
the statements, etc. And because they all interpret it
differently you get split ups, and peoples that form their
own group because they feel another group doesn't have
enough to offer for instance. Their are also a lot of small
groups that are part of a larger organization like Grotto's
of The CoS, the Covens of the FCoS and SKO's Sanctions.

5.1: Where can I get the Satanic Bible?

Many people think the book is illegal and very hard to get.
That's not true, you can order the book very easily at
amazon.com

5.2: How do I find Satanic jewelry?

A lot of people are asking this question. There are some
online shops that specialize in jewelry, but a nice
pentagram or Baphomet is hard to find. You give it a good
search and I'm sure you'll find something.
