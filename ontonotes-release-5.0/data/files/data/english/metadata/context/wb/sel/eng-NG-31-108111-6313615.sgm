Saw Riley today, very pleased to see he's inside during the winter and has
put on a good amount of weight.  Not pleased to see he's confined to a crate
in the dark cold basement for 23 and a half hours a day and doesn't have any
blankets or padding in his crate (know that I know this, he won't be without
one much longer).  If anyone knows anyone who wants a great 4 year old Weim,
please let me know.  He deserves better and I will drive him almost anywhere
to get a good home.  THANKS.

I remember you posting about Riley's situation.  It sounds like things
have gone from bad to worse.  I wish you good luck in finding him a home
or becoming able to take him yourself.  I gotta believe he must look
forward to your visits!!

Oh, man, this sucks for Riley.  From what I know about Weims, they really
need to be with their people.

Have you considered working through a Weim rescue to find him a home?  Will
the owners give him up?

yes, they certainly do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I called a Weim rescue but was told they have too many to place and can't
help out.  They told me to neuter him and then try to return him to the
breeder.  If he didn't get neutered first, he'd be used as breeding stock.
I am not in a position to pay for him to get neutered and I know the owners
won't do it themselves.  I did not contact the breeder to see if he'd want
Riley back (since he's not neutered) though maybe I should let them know
he's available if they ever get a people calling them about an older dog.

I wish I could have him, he's a great dog, not phased by his situation in
the least.  Unfortunately, I am hunting for a place of my own and will most
likely be renting.  I am having a tough time getting a place to agree to two
(non to low shedding) small dogs and if I add Riley to the mix, I will most
certainly not be able to find a place I can afford.

As for finding him another home, I keep trying to spread the word.  I even
stopped a couple on the streets the other day because they were walking a
Weim.  I've seen them out a lot so it seems like they would be a good home
but they weren't interested (well only the wife wasn't interested).  My out
of state cousins are also trying to find Riley a home and I am hoping soon
we will have a good  one lined up.

So it sounds like he came from a less than stellar breeder if there is a

It can't hurt to ask them.

Where are you located (in what state)?  There may be Wiem rescues in
neighboring states who are able to help.  I worked with a Mastiff rescue
in Indy for a dog that some woman here (in Louisville) was trying to give
away on Freecycle.  The local rescues were not in a position to help, but
Indy Mastiff rescue ended up taking him into foster care (thank
goodness!).  If you go to the Weim breed club website, they seem to have
a central rescue contact for surrenders:
http://www.weimclubamerica.org/rescue/rescue/surrender.html

If the owners won't give him up, though, that doesn't leave you or poor
Riley with any options.

unfortunately I can't afford even that.  I had to go part time at work in
August so I could watch my nephew everyday (without pay) while his parents
worked and went back to school.  Now even the few hours I work get cut a lot
because of delays and closings (I work in, but not for, a school district).
Add to that a few days of missed work due to food poisoning (thanks to Peter
Pan peanut butter) and I am lucky I made my car payment last month.
Actually, that wouldn't have even happened except that my parents loaned me
the money I needed for that (and for some grad school tests and application
fees).  So, any money I get has to go to the bills and paying my parents
back.  If I had to find money to pay for the neutering, it would have to
come from a loan from my parents and even though they help me when I need it
or when they can, I don't think the dog getting neutered would rate high on
the list of reasons to loan/give me money, especially since he isn't even my
dog.

That's outrageous.  Your regular vet is ripping people off and
potentially discouraging people from having their animals neutered.  I
can have speuters and dentals done on at least two 70 lb animals for
that amount of money at my vet (regular charges, not rescue discount).

&gt;Their costs are high for a number of reasons: if you don't squawk and
&gt;pay them, they donate a lot of time and money to various clinics around
&gt;town. If you do squawk, they will often accommodate you with a lower
&gt;price. If you tell them you can't afford them, they'll send you off to
&gt;a good, safe, cheap place.

&gt;It's an interesting way of doing business, but they've been upfront about it.

That sounds like the way things are done down in Mexico.

Go to a restaurant down there and ask to see the menu.

If you're a gringo, you'll get one version of it.  The hamburgers will
be, say, $6.00.

If you're a Mexican, but not from that area, you'll get another
version of it, somewhat cheaper than the gringo version.  The
hamburgers will only be $3.00.

If you're a local Mexican, you'll get a third version of it, and it'll
be the cheapest of all.  The hamburgers will be $.95, including a beer
chaser.

The same crap happens a lot in France, too.

Yes, thanks for asking.  It was a couple of weeks ago and the worst thing

Yes, maybe that's it.

I don't think I've ever seen a rescue site with so much discussion about how
they've been burned by other humane orgs and people.  Weird.

Plus, some perfectly good adopters cannot put up a 6 ft fence because they
aren't allowed to due to HOAs or zoning, and the dog gets plenty of exercise
on a leash.  They don't have to adopt to fenceless people if they don't want
to, but it seems awfully restrictive to me.

&gt; Saw Riley today, very pleased to see he's inside during the winter and has
&gt; put on a good amount of weight.  Not pleased to see he's confined to a
&gt; crate in the dark cold basement for 23 and a half hours a day and doesn't
&gt; have any blankets or padding in his crate (now that I know this, he won't
&gt; be without one much longer).  If anyone knows anyone who wants a great 4
&gt; year old Weim, please let me know.  He deserves better and I will drive
&gt; him almost anywhere to get a good home.  THANKS.

More on the Riley situation.......

I called and emailed a dozen non-specific shelters and rescues.  Many were
willing to help place Riley!!  The Weim rescue that has a fee for help,
offered to work with me so I don't have to pay the fee!  They also don't
care if he's neutered or not so that's not a problem.  I also talked to his
owners today to see what the chances of them agreeing to him getting a new
home and one says YES YES YES get him out of here and the other says
NO:(    Since neither spend time with him or take care of him, I am hoping I
can be enough of a pain that they change their minds.  Wish me luck.

I sincerely wish you the best of luck with this.

Maybe the Yes owner will be able to convince the other one.

There are plenty of rescues that choose to go this route.  I own a Dane, but
can't adopt from the local Dane rescue because I choose to not fence in my
yard.  The Rottweiler rescue lady mentioned the other day that one of her
dogs went to someone who had adopted two Danes from Dane rescue before,
moved some place where she didn't have a fence, went back to Dane rescue
after her dogs passed away, and was turned down because she no longer had a
fence.  That's just insane.

It is insane to insist on an adoptive owner or even one purchasing a
purebred dog to have a fenced in yard.  I know because I demanded that
prospective owners of my Doberman litter have a fence.  Guess what 2 of
the 8 got killed by cars.  The owners had a fenced in yard.  At least I
didn't sell to the guy who wanted to know if you could feed em gunpowder
and make em mean?  Some people just suck!!!!
Good luck with Riley.  I feel so bad for him.  He has not had much of
a chance at life.
