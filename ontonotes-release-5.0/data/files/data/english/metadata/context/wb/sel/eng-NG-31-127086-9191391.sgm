I am livid.  I had been telling this story on the er pain scale post
but now I am switchin' it to here.
Sooooo, I have myofascial pain disease &amp; fms (15yrs) &amp; I just had to
have my gallbladder out along w/an umbilical hernia repair.
The Surgeon Told my Husb. after the surgery cuz I was goin' into mp
flare that he (&amp; most) drs. &quot;don't believe in that stuff&quot;.  !!!  Bad
enuff?  noooooooooo...so the surgeon refused to give me anything more
than percocet &amp; then I finally convinced (thru a really good er
doc)them to give me the dilaudid that worked IV.  Well...it helps more
but w/the flare I am still in such severe pain that they had to put in
a urinary cath. cuz I can't pee when I hurt this much.  I don't know
why the dilaudid isn't doin' the trick...but I am still paralyzed w/
pain around belly to backbone.  So I tried to get them to change the
drug...not even to something stronger but something Different!!!!
Welll, I was supposed to have a dr.(pcp) appt. yesterday but I
cancelled it because the wind was blowing 80mph &amp; it was dangerous out
there &amp; I had meds &amp; thought I could get through till my dr appt on
Thurs.  But noooooooooo.  Sooooo they all believed I went to my appt.,
even the dr it was with!!!  It's all because they are believing their
friggin' COMPUTERS &amp; PAPERWORK!!!  So, tomorrow I am going to the doc
&amp; asking for a copy proving I physically saw him as he claimed &amp; told
the er so.  Sooooo, then I have to go to the hosp. w/it &amp; have them
change their pprwrk.  cuz that is the only way to go thru this.  O, &amp;

Lori,

I am so sorry you have to endure this kind of &quot;medical care&quot; and &quot;pain
management&quot;. I've been there and done that too, and still go thru the
same old crap concerning getting meds that really work to keep my pain
at a level where I can function. (As in, cook a simple meal, do a little
housework and sleep a full night of quality sleep, etc)

I have no magic answer for you, but please know you are not alone. And
yes, you have been &quot;abused&quot;. You and everyone else suffering from
chronic pain in most cases go thru this crap more than any humane
medical system should allow.
It just plain sucks :( I wish I could offer you more than a few words to
let you know you are not alone. I'll keep you in my thoughts though. I
hope that you and I and everyone else fighting for meds to give us
something closer to &quot;quality of life&quot; than we have now.

Hang in there Lori. I do understand your frustration and anger, as do
most people here. This usenet forum gives me more support than I get any
place else. I am lucky, as I have caring people who help me fight my way
thru the system and that is a good thing. But i come here to read and
sometimes post cuz I know everyone here really understands the crap we
go thru on a day to day basis.

~bearla

Lori, feel free to send me an email if you'd like. I will reply. I don't
have any answers, but I'm a good &quot;listener&quot; and I will happily do all I
can to help you thru your bad days :) Damn...i wish I had a magic wand.
Oh, and if I were queen of the world no body would ever go without
quality care for chronic pain. Also chocolate would be free for everyone
:)

Dear Lori,

Hi ya, Luv. I hope you're hanging tough and knowing you like I do I am sure
you are. Any hospital visit requires 72 hours of hounding your pain doc, or
whoever is Rxing the meds, until they think they will go insane, if they
hear your name again. It's no time to be polite and accept the line &quot;they
have fine quality trained anesthesiologists at the hospital and they'll fix
you up post op&quot;. That translates to &quot;the children they have dealing with
your pain are still wiping placenta off their noses.&quot; 3 hours to get a
Demerol injection that takes and hour to work and only lasts just short of
two hours, if at all, while the floor nurses (with apologies to the nurses
in attendance. You can only do what the docs are willing to move on) look at
the latest &quot;Land's End' of some other such catalogue, waiting to run out for
their cigarette break.
YOU have to take it upon yourself, on top of all the other worries, like
getting your gallbladder yanked out, and praying to God for a bowel
movement, so you can get the hell out of there, to arrange your own post op
pain care, Cause Dr Placentahead will see to it Percoset is your only choice
and you'll be sent home with a total of 5 tablets, expecting you hold your
guts in with one hand and pay off the cabbie with the other to make your
post op doc appointment.
I bolted two days early on my back surgery as I could treat my post op pain
better at home. They still charged for the additional two days for the
medication infuser.$12 for two Tylenol. Just cause they were robbing my
insurance company blind was no reason to sit there and let it happen.
Leaving against medical advice, do to incompetent post op pain control. I
could hobble to the elevator and that was good enough for me. Pardon me, I
digress.
This should have been planned, my love, right down to the point where you
relay your doubt in the competency of the medical staff when it comes to
pain management for you. It may work fine for Jane Q. Public, but the usual
steps are not for you. And now that wonderful winter has returned, can 3
feet of snow be far behind? Or 3 degrees below zero with 40mph winds?
Prepare for the worst, even expect it. Our fearless leader, King George the
2nd, suggests everyone have a 3 day emergency supply of all our prescription
medications on hand for the next terrorist attack. That and duct tape and
plastic sheeting to wrap the dead in, to take them to a government approved
crematory facility. But you should have 3 days ahead, and planned 3 days
ahead with your doctor. Don't depend on the smocks in the hospital to do
anything but trip over their umbilical cords.

Wishing you ultra fast, no more pain recovery--og

Yep,
Even tho I did as much planning as I could under emergency since I
have been trying to find a new doc (&amp; made the mistake of saying &quot;&amp; if
there are any w/hearts for chronic pain&quot;, all the new doc searches I
did in smalltown,Wa refuse to take cp'ers.  It's a viscious circle but
tomorrow I fight on for us all.
I am seeing the original pcp doc who claims I physically was in his
office Mon. (I wasn't) &amp; will ask him for a copy of proof that he
physically saw &amp; examined me.  All he did was phone in a 'script for
percocet, which now I can't take anyway cuz of my liver.  Anywhooooo,
I am Sooooooo Thankful to you all!!!  Payback in support will come
when I heal.
Love,

Apparently King George II hasn't been to many of the present-day pain
mismanagement docs who count pills and refuse to give any extras for
any reason.  If you accidentally call in for your refill script 3 days
early they call and give you what for and suggest you come in for a
pill count...maybe His Highness would be so kind as to tell the docs
this critical information.

Dear Lori,

You coulda knocked me over with a feather, if they actually filled a faxed
Rx for a class 2 medication. Vicodin or Norco yea, but Percoset??!? Somebody
just stomped all over Federal prescribing rules, as class 2's require paper
in hand to fill. And Washington State is in the major leagues when it comes
to assholiness about Rx's. Of course there are exceptions to every rule, but
a faxed Rx  for Percoset in Washington state is like getting ice water from
Satan himself. Tell him the Friday night card game is out until he brings
cash, his credit is no longer any good. Whatelse do you expect from the
Devil?

feel better soon--og

&gt;&gt; &gt; why the dilaudid isn't doin' the trick...but I am still paralyzed w/
&gt;&gt; &gt; pain around belly to backbone.  So I tried to get them to change the
&gt;&gt; &gt; drug...not even to something stronger but something Different!!!!
&gt;&gt; &gt; Welll, I was supposed to have a dr.(pcp) appt. yesterday but I
&gt;&gt; &gt; cancelled it because the wind was blowing 80mph &amp; it was dangerous out
&gt;&gt; &gt; there &amp; I had meds &amp; thought I could get through till my dr appt on
&gt;&gt; &gt; Thurs.  But noooooooooo.  Sooooo they all believed I went to my appt.,
&gt;&gt; &gt; even the dr it was with!!!  It's all because they are believing their
&gt;&gt; &gt; friggin' COMPUTERS &amp; PAPERWORK!!!  So, tomorrow I am going to the doc
&gt;&gt; &gt; &amp; asking for a copy proving I physically saw him as he claimed &amp; told
&gt;&gt; &gt; the er so.  Sooooo, then I have to go to the hosp. w/it &amp; have them
&gt;&gt; &gt; change their pprwrk.  cuz that is the only way to go thru this.  O, &amp;
&gt;&gt; &gt; my drs' nurse said &quot;I am not going to allow you to threaten me w/Fed.
&gt;&gt; &gt; law&quot;.  okkkkkkk??!!!!  well, I gotta take a deep breath &amp; that hurts

&gt; &gt;&gt; hear your name again. It's no time to be polite and accept the line &quot;they

&gt; &gt;&gt; the latest &quot;Land's End' of some other such catalogue, waiting to run out
&gt; &gt;&gt; for
&gt; &gt;&gt; their cigarette break.
&gt; &gt;&gt; YOU have to take it upon yourself, on top of all the other worries, like
&gt; &gt;&gt; getting your gallbladder yanked out, and praying to God for a bowel
&gt; &gt;&gt; movement, so you can get the hell out of there, to arrange your own post
&gt; &gt;&gt; op
&gt; &gt;&gt; pain care, Cause Dr Placentahead will see to it Percoset is your only

&gt; &gt;&gt; and you'll be sent home with a total of 5 tablets, expecting you hold
&gt; &gt;&gt; your
&gt; &gt;&gt; guts in with one hand and pay off the cabbie with the other to make your
&gt; &gt;&gt; post op doc appointment.
&gt; &gt;&gt; I bolted two days early on my back surgery as I could treat my post op
&gt; &gt;&gt; pain
&gt; &gt;&gt; better at home. They still charged for the additional two days for the
&gt; &gt;&gt; medication infuser.$12 for two Tylenol. Just cause they were robbing my
&gt; &gt;&gt; insurance company blind was no reason to sit there and let it happen.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Leaving against medical advice, do to incompetent post op pain control. I
&gt; &gt;&gt; could hobble to the elevator and that was good enough for me. Pardon me,
&gt; &gt;&gt; I

&gt; &gt;&gt; This should have been planned, my love, right down to the point where you
&gt; &gt;&gt; relay your doubt in the competency of the medical staff when it comes to
&gt; &gt;&gt; pain management for you. It may work fine for Jane Q. Public, but the

&gt; &gt;&gt; Prepare for the worst, even expect it. Our fearless leader, King George

Dear Lori,

It tears me up to see you in such pain. My late Mom had her gallbladder done
and she was so sensitive to any drugs that she saw it through with Tylenol.
I must have been left on the doorstep by gypsies, cause that sure doesn't
run in my genes. I wish I could donate a pint of blood to you. There would
be enough medication in there to hold you for a week.
Hang in there. At least this is something time should heal, incompetent pain
control aside,

Hang tough--og

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Dear Lori,

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hi ya, Luv. I hope you're hanging tough and knowing you like I do I am
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sure
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you are. Any hospital visit requires 72 hours of hounding your pain doc,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; whoever is Rxing the meds, until they think they will go insane, if they
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hear your name again. It's no time to be polite and accept the line &quot;they
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; have fine quality trained anesthesiologists at the hospital and they'll
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; fix
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you up post op&quot;. That translates to &quot;the children they have dealing with
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; your pain are still wiping placenta off their noses.&quot; 3 hours to get a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Demerol injection that takes and hour to work and only lasts just short
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; two hours, if at all, while the floor nurses (with apologies to the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; nurses
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in attendance. You can only do what the docs are willing to move on) look
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; at
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the latest &quot;Land's End' of some other such catalogue, waiting to run out
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; for
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; their cigarette break.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; YOU have to take it upon yourself, on top of all the other worries, like
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; getting your gallbladder yanked out, and praying to God for a bowel
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; movement, so you can get the hell out of there, to arrange your own post
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; op
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain care, Cause Dr Placentahead will see to it Percoset is your only
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; choice
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and you'll be sent home with a total of 5 tablets, expecting you hold
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; your
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; guts in with one hand and pay off the cabbie with the other to make your
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; post op doc appointment.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I bolted two days early on my back surgery as I could treat my post op
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; better at home. They still charged for the additional two days for the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; medication infuser.$12 for two Tylenol. Just cause they were robbing my
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; insurance company blind was no reason to sit there and let it happen.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Leaving against medical advice, do to incompetent post op pain control. I
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; could hobble to the elevator and that was good enough for me. Pardon me,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; digress.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; This should have been planned, my love, right down to the point where you
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; relay your doubt in the competency of the medical staff when it comes to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain management for you. It may work fine for Jane Q. Public, but the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; usual
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; steps are not for you. And now that wonderful winter has returned, can 3
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; feet of snow be far behind? Or 3 degrees below zero with 40mph winds?
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Prepare for the worst, even expect it. Our fearless leader, King George
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd, suggests everyone have a 3 day emergency supply of all our
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; prescription
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; medications on hand for the next terrorist attack. That and duct tape and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; plastic sheeting to wrap the dead in, to take them to a government
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; approved
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; crematory facility. But you should have 3 days ahead, and planned 3 days
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ahead with your doctor. Don't depend on the smocks in the hospital to do
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; anything but trip over their umbilical cords.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Wishing you ultra fast, no more pain recovery--og

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I am livid.  I had been telling this story on the er pain scale post
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; but now I am switchin' it to here.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sooooo, I have myofascial pain disease &amp; fms (15yrs) &amp; I just had to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have my gallbladder out along w/an umbilical hernia repair.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The Surgeon Told my Husb. after the surgery cuz I was goin' into mp
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; flare that he (&amp; most) drs. &quot;don't believe in that stuff&quot;.  !!!  Bad
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; enuff?  noooooooooo...so the surgeon refused to give me anything more
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; than percocet &amp; then I finally convinced (thru a really good er
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; doc)them to give me the dilaudid that worked IV.  Well...it helps more
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; but w/the flare I am still in such severe pain that they had to put in
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a urinary cath. cuz I can't pee when I hurt this much.  I don't know
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; why the dilaudid isn't doin' the trick...but I am still paralyzed w/
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pain around belly to backbone.  So I tried to get them to change the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; drug...not even to something stronger but something Different!!!!
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Welll, I was supposed to have a dr.(pcp) appt. yesterday but I
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cancelled it because the wind was blowing 80mph &amp; it was dangerous out
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there &amp; I had meds &amp; thought I could get through till my dr appt on
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thurs.  But noooooooooo.  Sooooo they all believed I went to my appt.,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; even the dr it was with!!!  It's all because they are believing their
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; friggin' COMPUTERS &amp; PAPERWORK!!!  So, tomorrow I am going to the doc
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &amp; asking for a copy proving I physically saw him as he claimed &amp; told
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the er so.  Sooooo, then I have to go to the hosp. w/it &amp; have them
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; change their pprwrk.  cuz that is the only way to go thru this.  O, &amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; my drs' nurse said &quot;I am not going to allow you to threaten me w/Fed.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; law&quot;.  okkkkkkk??!!!!  well, I gotta take a deep breath &amp; that hurts
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; so will check back later.

TY as always (((((((OG))))))))))!!!
Hey I really ended up in a GOOD place!!!  &amp; it Will help others down
the line!
The DR ADMITTED he was WRONG!!!!  He is going to correct my paperwork
at the er &amp; speak w/the dr &amp; nurse involved.  I'm happy when anyone
admits wrongdoing &amp; all I had to say was I SUFFERED &amp; don't want
anyone else to.  The problem is communication devices...all anyone had
to do was pick up the phone &amp; not have anyone else filter!!!  The
medical conglom. Madrona is to blame &amp; they had their quality control
person come &amp; interview me so that particular formal complaint is
made.  When I'm well I do intend on talking to the er nurse tho...I
need to do that personally.
Soooooooo, the outcome is good tho I went to hell &amp; am trying to climb
out of the mfp flare.  I think for some reason the morphine (60mg)day
IS working better on my gut thru back &amp; bone pain...who knows why?!
At least now I have a chance to recover &amp; am doin' it!
TY to all &amp; yes ((((Angself))), I will email ya right now!  I thought
I did b4 but it's been a bad circus.
Kindly,

&gt; Dear Lori,

&gt; It tears me up to see you in such pain. My late Mom had her gallbladder done
&gt; and she was so sensitive to any drugs that she saw it through with Tylenol.
&gt; I must have been left on the doorstep by gypsies, cause that sure doesn't
&gt; run in my genes. I wish I could donate a pint of blood to you. There would

&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Lori,

&gt; &gt; &gt; You coulda knocked me over with a feather, if they actually filled a faxed
&gt; &gt; &gt; Rx for a class 2 medication. Vicodin or Norco yea, but Percoset??!? Somebody
&gt; &gt; &gt; just stomped all over Federal prescribing rules, as class 2's require paper
&gt; &gt; &gt; in hand to fill. And Washington State is in the major leagues when it comes
&gt; &gt; &gt; to assholiness about Rx's. Of course there are exceptions to every rule, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; a faxed Rx  for Percoset in Washington state is like getting ice water from
&gt; &gt; &gt; Satan himself. Tell him the Friday night card game is out until he brings
&gt; &gt; &gt; cash, his credit is no longer any good. Whatelse do you expect from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Devil?

&gt; &gt; &gt; feel better soon--og

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yep,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even tho I did as much planning as I could under emergency since I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have been trying to find a new doc (&amp; made the mistake of saying &quot;&amp; if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are any w/hearts for chronic pain&quot;, all the new doc searches I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did in smalltown,Wa refuse to take cp'ers.  It's a viscious circle but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow I fight on for us all.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am seeing the original pcp doc who claims I physically was in his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; office Mon. (I wasn't) &amp; will ask him for a copy of proof that he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physically saw &amp; examined me.  All he did was phone in a 'script for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; percocet, which now I can't take anyway cuz of my liver.  Anywhooooo,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am Sooooooo Thankful to you all!!!  Payback in support will come
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when I heal.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Love,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Dear Lori,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hi ya, Luv. I hope you're hanging tough and knowing you like I do I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sure
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you are. Any hospital visit requires 72 hours of hounding your pain doc,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; whoever is Rxing the meds, until they think they will go insane, if they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hear your name again. It's no time to be polite and accept the line &quot;they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; have fine quality trained anesthesiologists at the hospital and they'll
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; fix
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you up post op&quot;. That translates to &quot;the children they have dealing with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; your pain are still wiping placenta off their noses.&quot; 3 hours to get a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Demerol injection that takes and hour to work and only lasts just short
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; two hours, if at all, while the floor nurses (with apologies to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; nurses
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in attendance. You can only do what the docs are willing to move on) look
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the latest &quot;Land's End' of some other such catalogue, waiting to run out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; their cigarette break.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; YOU have to take it upon yourself, on top of all the other worries, like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; getting your gallbladder yanked out, and praying to God for a bowel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; movement, so you can get the hell out of there, to arrange your own post
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; op
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain care, Cause Dr Placentahead will see to it Percoset is your only
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; choice
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and you'll be sent home with a total of 5 tablets, expecting you hold
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; guts in with one hand and pay off the cabbie with the other to make your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; post op doc appointment.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I bolted two days early on my back surgery as I could treat my post op
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; better at home. They still charged for the additional two days for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; medication infuser.$12 for two Tylenol. Just cause they were robbing my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; insurance company blind was no reason to sit there and let it happen.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Leaving against medical advice, do to incompetent post op pain control. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; could hobble to the elevator and that was good enough for me. Pardon me,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; digress.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; This should have been planned, my love, right down to the point where you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; relay your doubt in the competency of the medical staff when it comes to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain management for you. It may work fine for Jane Q. Public, but the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; usual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; steps are not for you. And now that wonderful winter has returned, can 3
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; feet of snow be far behind? Or 3 degrees below zero with 40mph winds?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Prepare for the worst, even expect it. Our fearless leader, King George
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd, suggests everyone have a 3 day emergency supply of all our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; prescription
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; medications on hand for the next terrorist attack. That and duct tape and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; plastic sheeting to wrap the dead in, to take them to a government
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; approved
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; crematory facility. But you should have 3 days ahead, and planned 3 days
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ahead with your doctor. Don't depend on the smocks in the hospital to do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; anything but trip over their umbilical cords.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Wishing you ultra fast, no more pain recovery--og

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I am livid.  I had been telling this story on the er pain scale post
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; but now I am switchin' it to here.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sooooo, I have myofascial pain disease &amp; fms (15yrs) &amp; I just had to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have my gallbladder out along w/an umbilical hernia repair.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The Surgeon Told my Husb. after the surgery cuz I was goin' into mp
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; flare that he (&amp; most) drs. &quot;don't believe in that stuff&quot;.  !!!  Bad
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; enuff?  noooooooooo...so the surgeon refused to give me anything more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; than percocet &amp; then I finally convinced (thru a really good er
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; doc)them to give me the dilaudid that worked IV.  Well...it helps more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; but w/the flare I am still in such severe pain that they had to put in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a urinary cath. cuz I can't pee when I hurt this much.  I don't know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; why the dilaudid isn't doin' the trick...but I am still paralyzed w/
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pain around belly to backbone.  So I tried to get them to change the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; drug...not even to something stronger but something Different!!!!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Welll, I was supposed to have a dr.(pcp) appt. yesterday but I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cancelled it because the wind was blowing 80mph &amp; it was dangerous out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there &amp; I had meds &amp; thought I could get through till my dr appt on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thurs.  But noooooooooo.  Sooooo they all believed I went to my appt.,
