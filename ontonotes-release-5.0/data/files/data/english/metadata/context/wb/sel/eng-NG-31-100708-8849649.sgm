Vietnam By Dummies (Prof. G.W. Bush Lecturing)

By Stephen Pizzo
Created Aug 23 2007 - 9:31am

President Bush finally got something right by comparing the US war in Iraq
with the disastrous US war in Vietnam. After five years of denying there
were any similarities at all, Bush lectured us on the lessons he says we
should have learned from that war and apply them to Iraq.

So far so good. Trouble is the lesson Bush suggested we should learn from
our failure in Vietnam four decades ago goes something like this:

We cut and ran in Vietnam. We let our allies down. We allowed a rag tag
group of insurgents to win against the great American military. And that's
why we're in the mess we're in today. Our enemies today, another group of
rag tag insurgents called al-Qaeda - have been emboldened by our retreat
from Vietnam.

Therefore, Bush posits, we must stay the course in Iraq, no matter how bleak
the situation becomes. Because, to do otherwise would be to reinforce our
enemy's belief that the US lacks staying power and has no stomach for taking
casualties. That in turn will encourage them to cause trouble throughout the
region and to even launch attacks against the American homeland itself... or
as Bush claims, if we don't fight them in Iraq, we'll have to fight them
right here in the US of A.

Of course no well-read (or sane) person would draw such lessons from
Vietnam. In fact, had Bush and Congress had heeded the real lessons of
Vietnam they would have scoffed at the idea of putting tens of thousands of
US combat troops on the ground in the heart of the Middle East.

(Note: Few will also miss the bitter irony of being lectured on &quot;the lessons
of Vietnam&quot; by a guy who spent that war hiding out in the Texas Air National
Guard, drinking beer and malingering by skipping out on monthly drills. [It
was good to be the son of a powerful Texas congressman.])

Those of us who lived through the Vietnam era, or have since studied
declassified documents from the Johnson and Nixon administrations, have
walked away with much different lessons:

Super-power status is meaningless against a enemy fighting on and for their
own land and willing to incur and take unlimited casualties.

1.. Puppet governments set up under foreign occupying forces are viewed by
their own people as illegitimate and therefore cannot govern.
2.. The hurdle for an occupying army is very high - they need to win. The
hurdle for an indigenous insurgency is much more achievable - they simply
need to not lose.
3.. When the vast majority of Americans cease to support a foreign war,
that war is lost - period.
4.. Retreat from Vietnam did not result in a &quot;domino effect,&quot; in the
region, as threatened.
5.. When we retreated from Vietnam the Viet Cong did not &quot;follow us home.&quot;
6.. Our retreat from Vietnam did not result in permanent estrangement,
just the opposite.
7.. The only Vietnamese who &quot;followed us home,&quot; were refugees who have
since become among some of the most highly educated and successful American
citizens.
George W. Bush learned none of the real lessons of the Vietnam War. Because
Bush and his Neo-con co-dependents insulated themselves from the those
lessons by soaking their gray matter in the Kool-Aid of denial - that it was
the &quot;liberal media&quot; and &quot;liberals in Congress,&quot; that cut the ground from
under our troops. In other words, as far as Bush et al are concerned, we
didn't lose in Vietnam, we cut and ran before the job was done. They surely
believe to this day that, had we only stuck with it a few more months,
surged a few more times, that we would have won. The light was right there
they say, at the end of that tunnel -- a tunnel that never itself seemed to
have not end.

And if you believe that, then I have a war in the Middle East to sell ya.

We've gone through so many iterations of the Bush doctrine with Iraq that
I've lost the thread. But this appears to be a whole new version of the Bush
doctrine: Never give up. Never admit defeat no matter how many soldiers are
dying each week (especially since none of them are related to you.) Keep
fighting.... no matter the cost in treasure or to our nation's soul.
Because, as long as we keep fighting no one can say we lost. No one can say
we cut and ran.

It's not a new idea. In fact it's just a reworked version of the military
doctrine of another George --

George Custer.

Selective memory.

The lesson of Veitnam, was what Ho Chi Minh predicted would happen.  All
they had to do was inflict enough pain for a long enough period of time, and
the US would lose their stomach for the fight.  That happened, we did lose
our stomach for the fight...we cut and ran from a fight that was within our
reach to win....

Every time we do not have the stomach for a fight, we reinforce the idea
that Ho Chi Minh had, and we certainly do not detract from the idea.

To even imply that the lesson of Vietnam was that there was no way we could
have won, is misinpreting what actually was the case.  First and foremost,
the United States, for whatever reason, did not conduct the war in Vietnam,
like they conducted the Second World War.  Second, like the Korean War, the
United States &quot;allowed&quot; countries to support the North Vietnamese in
fighting against the US.  That was not the case in the Second World War.
Third, all you had to do was study how the campaign was conducted against
Germany and Japan, to see that we certainly did not conduct the war with
North Vietnam in the same manner as we conducted the war against Germany and
Japan.  Finally, the US had North Vietnam begging for relief, when Operation
Linebacker was in its final stages.  And we gave them that relief.  Would
Roosevelt or Truman provided Germany or Japan with that way out?  Did Truman
continue to bomb Japan, until they surrendered?  Would he have accepted
anything less that total surrender, as a condition to stop the bombing?  Did
the US (Nixon in this case) insist on total surrender....no he did not.
Could he have gotten them to surrender, if he had said, not peace
overtures....we are going to continue the bombing of your country until you
are willing to unconditionally surrender?  The answer is obviously yes.

No one can say that the Domino Theory was wrong.  The only way you can say
that the Domino Theory was wrong is if we did not intervene in that area of
the world, and the &quot;dominos&quot; did not fall.  But, we did intervene, changing
the future in that region of the world.  And besides that, the &quot;dominos&quot; did
start to fall, as predicted, it just was not successful.  Cambodia did fall
to the Khmer Rouge.  Vietnam did invade and occupy Laos.

The Vietnam War was never about &quot;them&quot; following us home.  On the other had
we cannot say the same thing about Iraq.  Radical Islam does want to attack
us.  If they get another base of operation like they did in Afghanistan, it
is likely they will use that base of operations to organize, plan and train
people to attack us.  And the big difference between Afghanistan and Iraq,
is Afghanistan was a poor country and Iraq is a rich country....imagine what
they can do with some of that money that Iraq has.

Not enough stomach in this instance means that Americans did not
desire to engage in atrocity and genocide in the effort to shove a
political system down the throats of the Vietnamese, which would
never have emerged victorious in a fair democratic election.

Not enough stomach in the case of the War Upon Iraq means that
Americans cannot comprehend how a war, predicated upon deceits and
outright lies, has done anything other than to greatly increase
the number of unnecessary deaths in the battle against the
country's true enemies, al Qaeda, whose leadership was allowed to
walk away from Tora Bora in December 2001, because Dubya Dim
desired to assuage his deep-seated Oedipal Neurosis, enabling him
to finally show his mom that he was better than his daddy, so he
turned America's military force away from the righteous fight:
taking the Qaeda dogs to ground, then and there.

Mr. Bush let our enemies walk-away, just as he has walked-away
from accepting the personal resonsibility, and the effects flowing
from it, for the multitude of personal miserable failures that
litter the landscape of his past.

George Walksaway Bush, The President of Lowered Expectations

&quot;I'm the master of low expectations.
I think we accomplished what I hoped we would accomplish,
but I don't think we necessarily exceeded expectations.
I think 'met expectations' is a better way to put it.&quot;
