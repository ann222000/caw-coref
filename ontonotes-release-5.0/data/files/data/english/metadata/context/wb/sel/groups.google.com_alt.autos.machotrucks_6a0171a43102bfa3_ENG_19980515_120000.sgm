Anyone out there put 225/75/15's on a 4x2 s-10 blazer years 86-90. If so
do they rub against the chassis or wheel well

I put 235/75/15's on 15x8's on my '85 and it only rubs a little when I turn it all the way really hard and sometimes if I have it turned just right on a big enough bump it'll do it.... also, I had to bend the metal just behind the wheel back slightly... nothing a rubber mallet won't take care of (...and nobody will ever notice...)
