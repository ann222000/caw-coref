Nothing in the universe loose from a common surface -- such as Earth's
surface -- has any velocity or motion of its own except the speed of light
in vacuum. So how can it be dependent upon the velocity, or the motion, of
the source when the velocity of the source could be any number of differing
relative velocities and the motion any number of differing relative motions?
No specific or absolute velocity exists. No specific or absolute motion
exists. Just relative velocity, and just relative motion.

You base your house of cards on not realizing that we on our level are
made up of sub-atomic, atomic and molecular structures and infrastructure,
that a planet is not a unitary structure of structures; that a solar system,
too, is not a unitary structure of structures; that a galaxy, too, is not a
unitary structure of structures; and that on each level of structure, each
unitary structure is [apparently], or seemingly, an independent source
entity for the propagation of light. But the beginning statement, and the
question to you, rises and lowers [vertically] to apply at every
[horizontal] level as if all were one.

If you were right, the entire universe would be nothing but chaotic blur
or smear. It's only that regarding the foundation, the remotest point, line,
and flat, from any local: The universally inclusive / exclusive Planck
surface / horizon, thus 'non-locality' itself and the only originating
source of c, the speed of light in vacuum (&quot;...as if all were one&quot;). You are
trying to deal in spacing and timing when that source is spaceless and
timeless (both exclusive and inclusive of all space and all time, all
position and all velocity.... Inclusion of all [is] exclusion of all, and
vice-versa -- in case you didn't know. Being inside of all [is] being
outside of all, and vice-versa -- in case you didn't know).  ((Uni-))

Randy Randy giving a small quotation and referring to the original
source where everybody can find the rest of the text is NOT
intellectual dishonesty. Anyway, our interpretations of honesty/
dishonesty are not very important; let us see whether you understand
Divine Albert's thoughts. Consider the following text devised by a
great hypnotist in Einstein criminal cult called Clifford Will:

http://admin.wadsworth.com/resource_uploads/static_resources/05344933...
Clifford Will, &quot;THE RENAISSANCE OF GENERAL RELATIVITY&quot;: &quot;The first
glimmerings of the black hole idea date to the 18th century, in the
writings of a British amateur astronomer, the Reverend John Michell.
Reasoning on the basis of the corpuscular theory that light would be
attracted by gravity, he noted that the speed of light emitted from
the surface of a massive body would be reduced by the time the light
was very far from the source. (Michell of course did not know special
relativity.)&quot;

So Randy Randy Master Clifford Will considers a place &quot;very far from
the source&quot; where the gravitational field is virtually zero, that is,
in Divine Albert's words, &quot;we are able to disregard the influences of
gravitational fields&quot;. And Master Clifford Will seems to suspect that
Michell was right - apart from Divine Albert, many other hypnotists
have confirmed that the speed of light does vary with the
gravitational potential. However Master Clifford Will knows that,
since the field is virtually zero, the observer there is INERTIAL and
since this inertial observer measures a speed of light lower than
c=300000km/s, Einstein criminal cult is in danger. So Master Clifford
Will introduces an extremely silly but efficient (in Einstein zombie
world) red herring: Michell did not know special relativity.

Two simple questions Randy Randy:

1. Is it true that &quot;the speed of light emitted from the surface of a
massive body would be reduced by the time the light was very far from
the source&quot;? Yes? No?

2. If Divine Albert could somehow meet John Michell and tell him about
his special relativity, would John Michell stop claiming that &quot;the
speed of light emitted from the surface of a massive body would be
reduced by the time the light was very far from the source&quot;? Yes? No?

Difficult questions aren't they Randy Randy. Even your masters cannot
answer them for the moment. Have you noticed your masters have been
silent for the last few months? There have been bursts of conscience
in Einstein criminal cult related to the fact that the speed of light
varies with the gravitational potential:

http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExperts/ae13.cfm
&quot;So, it is absolutely true that the speed of light is _not_ constant
in a gravitational field [which, by the equivalence principle, applies
as well to accelerating (non-inertial) frames of reference]. If this
were not so, there would be no bending of light by the gravitational
field of stars....Indeed, this is exactly how Einstein did the
calculation in: 'On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of
Light,' Annalen der Physik, 35, 1911. which predated the full formal
development of general relativity by about four years. This paper is
widely available in English. You can find a copy beginning on page 99
of the Dover book 'The Principle of Relativity.' You will find in
section 3 of that paper, Einstein's derivation of the (variable) speed
of light in a gravitational potential, eqn (3). The result is,
c' = c0 ( 1 + V / c^2 )
where V is the gravitational potential relative to the point where the
speed of light c0 is measured.&quot;

http://www.blazelabs.com/f-g-gcont.asp &quot;The first confirmation of a
long range variation in the speed of light travelling in space came in
1964. Irwin Shapiro, it seems, was the first to make use of a
previously forgotten facet of general relativity theory -- that the
speed of light is reduced when it passes through a gravitational
field....Faced with this evidence, Einstein stated:&quot;In the second
place our result shows that, according to the general theory of
relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in
vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental assumptions in the
special theory of relativity and to which we have already frequently
referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. A curvature of rays of
light can only take place when the velocity of propagation of light
varies with position.&quot;......Today we find that since the Special
Theory of Relativity unfortunately became part of the so called
mainstream science, it is considered a sacrilege to even suggest that
the speed of light be anything other than a constant. This is somewhat
surprising since even Einstein himself suggested in a paper &quot;On the
Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light,&quot; Annalen der
Physik, 35, 1911, that the speed of light might vary with the
gravitational potential. Indeed, the variation of the speed of light
in a vacuum or space is explicitly shown in Einstein's calculation for
the angle at which light should bend upon the influence of gravity.
One can find his calculation in his paper. The result is c'=c(1+V/c^2)
where V is the gravitational potential relative to the point where the
measurement is taken. 1+V/c^2 is also known as the GRAVITATIONAL
REDSHIFT FACTOR.&quot;

Let us hope one day your masters will inform the world about the
fundamental questions that are torturing them every night:

1. Since the gravitational redshift is obviously the result of the
variability of the speed of light in a gravitational field, in
accordance with the equation
frequency = (speed of light)/(wavelength),
why do we, hypnotists in Einstein criminal cult, continue to destroy
human rationality by explaining the gravitational redshift in terms of
gravitational time dilation?

2. Since the speed of light varies with the gravitational potential,
why don't we, hypnotists in Einstein criminal cult, apply Einstein's
equivalence principle and show that, in the absence of a gravitational
field, the speed of light varies with v, the relative speed of the
light source and the observer, in accordance with the equation c'=c+v,
where c is the initial speed of the photons relative to the light
source?

&gt;&gt; So Randy Randy Master Clifford Will considers a place &quot;very far from
&gt;&gt; the source&quot; where the gravitational field is virtually zero, that is,
&gt;&gt; in Divine Albert's words, &quot;we are able to disregard the influences of
&gt;&gt; gravitational fields&quot;. And Master Clifford Will seems to suspect that
&gt;&gt; Michell was right - apart from Divine Albert, many other hypnotists
&gt;&gt; have confirmed that the speed of light does vary with the
&gt;&gt; gravitational potential. However Master Clifford Will knows that,
&gt;&gt; since the field is virtually zero, the observer there is INERTIAL and
&gt;&gt; since this inertial observer measures a speed of light lower than
&gt;&gt; c=300000km/s, Einstein criminal cult is in danger. So Master Clifford
&gt;&gt; Will introduces an extremely silly but efficient (in Einstein zombie
&gt;&gt; world) red herring: Michell did not know special relativity.

&gt;&gt; Two simple questions Randy Randy:

&gt;&gt; 1. Is it true that &quot;the speed of light emitted from the surface of a
&gt;&gt; massive body would be reduced by the time the light was very far from
&gt;&gt; the source&quot;? Yes? No?

&gt;&gt; 2. If Divine Albert could somehow meet John Michell and tell him about
&gt;&gt; his special relativity, would John Michell stop claiming that &quot;the
&gt;&gt; speed of light emitted from the surface of a massive body would be
&gt;&gt; reduced by the time the light was very far from the source&quot;? Yes? No?

&gt; Difficult questions aren't they Randy Randy. Even your masters cannot
&gt; answer them for the moment. Have you noticed your masters have been
&gt; silent for the last few months? There have been bursts of conscience
&gt; in Einstein criminal cult related to the fact that the speed of light
&gt; varies with the gravitational potential:

&gt; http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExperts/ae13.cfm
&gt; &quot;So, it is absolutely true that the speed of light is _not_ constant
&gt; in a gravitational field [which, by the equivalence principle, applies
&gt; as well to accelerating (non-inertial) frames of reference]. If this
&gt; were not so, there would be no bending of light by the gravitational
&gt; field of stars....Indeed, this is exactly how Einstein did the
&gt; calculation in: 'On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of
&gt; Light,' Annalen der Physik, 35, 1911. which predated the full formal
&gt; development of general relativity by about four years. This paper is
&gt; widely available in English. You can find a copy beginning on page 99
&gt; of the Dover book 'The Principle of Relativity.' You will find in
&gt; section 3 of that paper, Einstein's derivation of the (variable) speed
&gt; of light in a gravitational potential, eqn (3). The result is,
&gt; c' = c0 ( 1 + V / c^2 )
&gt; where V is the gravitational potential relative to the point where the
&gt; speed of light c0 is measured.&quot;

&gt; http://www.blazelabs.com/f-g-gcont.asp &quot;The first confirmation of a
&gt; long range variation in the speed of light travelling in space came in
&gt; 1964. Irwin Shapiro, it seems, was the first to make use of a
&gt; previously forgotten facet of general relativity theory -- that the
&gt; speed of light is reduced when it passes through a gravitational
&gt; field....Faced with this evidence, Einstein stated:&quot;In the second
&gt; place our result shows that, according to the general theory of
&gt; relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in
&gt; vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental assumptions in the
&gt; special theory of relativity and to which we have already frequently
&gt; referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. A curvature of rays of
&gt; light can only take place when the velocity of propagation of light
&gt; varies with position.&quot;......Today we find that since the Special
&gt; Theory of Relativity unfortunately became part of the so called
&gt; mainstream science, it is considered a sacrilege to even suggest that
&gt; the speed of light be anything other than a constant. This is somewhat
&gt; surprising since even Einstein himself suggested in a paper &quot;On the
&gt; Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light,&quot; Annalen der
&gt; Physik, 35, 1911, that the speed of light might vary with the
&gt; gravitational potential. Indeed, the variation of the speed of light
&gt; in a vacuum or space is explicitly shown in Einstein's calculation for
&gt; the angle at which light should bend upon the influence of gravity.
&gt; One can find his calculation in his paper. The result is c'=c(1+V/c^2)
&gt; where V is the gravitational potential relative to the point where the
&gt; measurement is taken. 1+V/c^2 is also known as the GRAVITATIONAL
&gt; REDSHIFT FACTOR.&quot;

&gt; Let us hope one day your masters will inform the world about the
&gt; fundamental questions that are torturing them every night:

&gt; 1. Since the gravitational redshift is obviously the result of the
&gt; variability of the speed of light in a gravitational field, in
&gt; accordance with the equation
&gt; frequency = (speed of light)/(wavelength),
&gt; why do we, hypnotists in Einstein criminal cult, continue to destroy
&gt; human rationality by explaining the gravitational redshift in terms of
&gt; gravitational time dilation?

&gt; 2. Since the speed of light varies with the gravitational potential,
&gt; why don't we, hypnotists in Einstein criminal cult, apply Einstein's
&gt; equivalence principle and show that, in the absence of a gravitational
&gt; field, the speed of light varies with v, the relative speed of the
&gt; light source and the observer, in accordance with the equation c'=c+v,
&gt; where c is the initial speed of the photons relative to the light
&gt; source?

&gt; Pentcho Valev
">

The relative velocity of the light source is [invariably] varyingly
relative to external observers, or external somethings, never internal to
the light source. The light source will never have any velocity of its own.
It will never have any position of its own, either. That too will invariably
be varyingly relative to external observers, or external somethings.

Even a light source's integral space and time, shape and form, even age in
time, are never truly its own, these being continuously adjusted and
re-adjusted in state by countless external elements and events, including
the more distant external elements and events from an ever bigger picture
via the domino effect. The galaxy's gravitational field reach is inclusive
of the Earth, for example. If its gravity were to vary -- or be variable --
even the slightest, Sol and this solar system, thus this Earth, would
sympathetically &quot;feel&quot; it to whatever degree of that variance and go into
some kind of change of state however slight.

: &gt;&gt;
: &gt;
http://admin.wadsworth.com/resource_uploads/static_resources/05344933...
: &gt;&gt; Clifford Will, &quot;THE RENAISSANCE OF GENERAL RELATIVITY&quot;: &quot;The first
: &gt;&gt; glimmerings of the black hole idea date to the 18th century, in the
: &gt;&gt; writings of a British amateur astronomer, the Reverend John Michell.

&gt; : &gt; surprising since even Einstein himself suggested in a paper &quot;On the
&gt; : &gt; Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light,&quot; Annalen der
&gt; : &gt; Physik, 35, 1911, that the speed of light might vary with the
&gt; : &gt; gravitational potential. Indeed, the variation of the speed of light
&gt; : &gt; in a vacuum or space is explicitly shown in Einstein's calculation for
&gt; : &gt; the angle at which light should bend upon the influence of gravity.
&gt; : &gt; One can find his calculation in his paper. The result is c'=c(1+V/c^2)
&gt; : &gt; where V is the gravitational potential relative to the point where the
&gt; : &gt; measurement is taken. 1+V/c^2 is also known as the GRAVITATIONAL
&gt; : &gt; REDSHIFT FACTOR.&quot;
&gt; : &gt;
&gt; : &gt; Let us hope one day your masters will inform the world about the
&gt; : &gt; fundamental questions that are torturing them every night:
&gt; : &gt;
&gt; : &gt; 1. Since the gravitational redshift is obviously the result of the
&gt; : &gt; variability of the speed of light in a gravitational field, in
&gt; : &gt; accordance with the equation
&gt; : &gt; frequency = (speed of light)/(wavelength),
&gt; : &gt; why do we, hypnotists in Einstein criminal cult, continue to destroy
&gt; : &gt; human rationality by explaining the gravitational redshift in terms of
&gt; : &gt; gravitational time dilation?
&gt; : &gt;
&gt; : &gt; 2. Since the speed of light varies with the gravitational potential,
&gt; : &gt; why don't we, hypnotists in Einstein criminal cult, apply Einstein's
&gt; : &gt; equivalence principle and show that, in the absence of a gravitational
&gt; : &gt; field, the speed of light varies with v, the relative speed of the
&gt; : &gt; light source and the observer, in accordance with the equation c'=c+v,
&gt; : &gt; where c is the initial speed of the photons relative to the light
&gt; : &gt; source?
&gt; : &gt;
&gt; : &gt; Pentcho Valev
&gt; :
&gt; :  The relative velocity of the light source is [invariably] varyingly
&gt; : relative to external observers, or external somethings, never internal
&gt; to
&gt; : the light source. The light source will never have any velocity of its
&gt; own.
&gt; : It will never have any position of its own, either. That too will
&gt; invariably
&gt; : be varyingly relative to external observers, or external somethings.
&gt; :
&gt; :  Even a light source's integral space and time, shape and form, even age
&gt; in
&gt; : time, are never truly its own, these being continuously adjusted and
&gt; : re-adjusted in state by countless external elements and events,
&gt; including
&gt; : the more distant external elements and events from an ever bigger
&gt; picture
&gt; : via the domino effect. The galaxy's gravitational field reach is
&gt; inclusive
&gt; : of the Earth, for example. If its gravity were to vary -- or be
&gt; variable --

: &gt; : &gt;&gt; Randy Randy giving a small quotation and referring to the original

: &gt; : &gt;&gt; intellectual dishonesty. Anyway, our interpretations of honesty/
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; dishonesty are not very important; let us see whether you
understand
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; Divine Albert's thoughts. Consider the following text devised by a
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; great hypnotist in Einstein criminal cult called Clifford Will:
: &gt; : &gt;&gt;
: &gt; : &gt;
: &gt;
http://admin.wadsworth.com/resource_uploads/static_resources/05344933...
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; Clifford Will, &quot;THE RENAISSANCE OF GENERAL RELATIVITY&quot;: &quot;The first
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; glimmerings of the black hole idea date to the 18th century, in the
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; writings of a British amateur astronomer, the Reverend John
Michell.
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; Reasoning on the basis of the corpuscular theory that light would
be
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; attracted by gravity, he noted that the speed of light emitted from
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; the surface of a massive body would be reduced by the time the
light
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; was very far from the source. (Michell of course did not know
special
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; relativity.)&quot;
: &gt; : &gt;&gt;
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; So Randy Randy Master Clifford Will considers a place &quot;very far
from
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; the source&quot; where the gravitational field is virtually zero, that
is,
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; in Divine Albert's words, &quot;we are able to disregard the influences
of
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; gravitational fields&quot;. And Master Clifford Will seems to suspect
that
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; Michell was right - apart from Divine Albert, many other hypnotists
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; have confirmed that the speed of light does vary with the
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; gravitational potential. However Master Clifford Will knows that,
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; since the field is virtually zero, the observer there is INERTIAL
and
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; since this inertial observer measures a speed of light lower than
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; c=300000km/s, Einstein criminal cult is in danger. So Master
Clifford
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; Will introduces an extremely silly but efficient (in Einstein
zombie
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; world) red herring: Michell did not know special relativity.
: &gt; : &gt;&gt;
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; Two simple questions Randy Randy:
: &gt; : &gt;&gt;
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; 1. Is it true that &quot;the speed of light emitted from the surface of
a
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; massive body would be reduced by the time the light was very far
from
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; the source&quot;? Yes? No?
: &gt; : &gt;&gt;
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; 2. If Divine Albert could somehow meet John Michell and tell him
: &gt; about
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; his special relativity, would John Michell stop claiming that &quot;the
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; speed of light emitted from the surface of a massive body would be
: &gt; : &gt;&gt; reduced by the time the light was very far from the source&quot;? Yes?
No?
: &gt; : &gt;
: &gt; : &gt; Difficult questions aren't they Randy Randy. Even your masters
cannot
: &gt; : &gt; answer them for the moment. Have you noticed your masters have been
: &gt; : &gt; silent for the last few months? There have been bursts of conscience
: &gt; : &gt; in Einstein criminal cult related to the fact that the speed of
light
: &gt; : &gt; varies with the gravitational potential:
: &gt; : &gt;
: &gt; : &gt; http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExperts/ae13.cfm
: &gt; : &gt; &quot;So, it is absolutely true that the speed of light is _not_ constant
: &gt; : &gt; in a gravitational field [which, by the equivalence principle,
applies
: &gt; : &gt; as well to accelerating (non-inertial) frames of reference]. If this
: &gt; : &gt; were not so, there would be no bending of light by the gravitational
: &gt; : &gt; field of stars....Indeed, this is exactly how Einstein did the
: &gt; : &gt; calculation in: 'On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation
of
: &gt; : &gt; Light,' Annalen der Physik, 35, 1911. which predated the full formal
: &gt; : &gt; development of general relativity by about four years. This paper is
: &gt; : &gt; widely available in English. You can find a copy beginning on page
99
: &gt; : &gt; of the Dover book 'The Principle of Relativity.' You will find in
: &gt; : &gt; section 3 of that paper, Einstein's derivation of the (variable)
speed
: &gt; : &gt; of light in a gravitational potential, eqn (3). The result is,
: &gt; : &gt; c' = c0 ( 1 + V / c^2 )
: &gt; : &gt; where V is the gravitational potential relative to the point where
the
: &gt; : &gt; speed of light c0 is measured.&quot;
: &gt; : &gt;
: &gt; : &gt; http://www.blazelabs.com/f-g-gcont.asp &quot;The first confirmation of a
: &gt; : &gt; long range variation in the speed of light travelling in space came
in
: &gt; : &gt; 1964. Irwin Shapiro, it seems, was the first to make use of a
: &gt; : &gt; previously forgotten facet of general relativity theory -- that the
: &gt; : &gt; speed of light is reduced when it passes through a gravitational
: &gt; : &gt; field....Faced with this evidence, Einstein stated:&quot;In the second
: &gt; : &gt; place our result shows that, according to the general theory of
: &gt; : &gt; relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in
: &gt; : &gt; vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental assumptions in
the
: &gt; : &gt; special theory of relativity and to which we have already frequently
: &gt; : &gt; referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. A curvature of rays
of
: &gt; : &gt; light can only take place when the velocity of propagation of light
: &gt; : &gt; varies with position.&quot;......Today we find that since the Special
: &gt; : &gt; Theory of Relativity unfortunately became part of the so called
: &gt; : &gt; mainstream science, it is considered a sacrilege to even suggest
that
: &gt; : &gt; the speed of light be anything other than a constant. This is
somewhat
: &gt; : &gt; surprising since even Einstein himself suggested in a paper &quot;On the
: &gt; : &gt; Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light,&quot; Annalen der
: &gt; : &gt; Physik, 35, 1911, that the speed of light might vary with the
: &gt; : &gt; gravitational potential. Indeed, the variation of the speed of light
: &gt; : &gt; in a vacuum or space is explicitly shown in Einstein's calculation
for
: &gt; : &gt; the angle at which light should bend upon the influence of gravity.
: &gt; : &gt; One can find his calculation in his paper. The result is
c'=c(1+V/c^2)
: &gt; : &gt; where V is the gravitational potential relative to the point where
the
: &gt; : &gt; measurement is taken. 1+V/c^2 is also known as the GRAVITATIONAL
: &gt; : &gt; REDSHIFT FACTOR.&quot;
: &gt; : &gt;
: &gt; : &gt; Let us hope one day your masters will inform the world about the
: &gt; : &gt; fundamental questions that are torturing them every night:

&gt; : &gt; : &gt; field of stars....Indeed, this is exactly how Einstein did the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; calculation in: 'On the Influence of Gravitation on the
&gt; Propagation
&gt; of
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; Light,' Annalen der Physik, 35, 1911. which predated the full
&gt; formal
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; development of general relativity by about four years. This paper
&gt; is
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; widely available in English. You can find a copy beginning on page
&gt; 99
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; of the Dover book 'The Principle of Relativity.' You will find in
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; section 3 of that paper, Einstein's derivation of the (variable)
&gt; speed
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; of light in a gravitational potential, eqn (3). The result is,
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; c' = c0 ( 1 + V / c^2 )
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; where V is the gravitational potential relative to the point where
&gt; the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; speed of light c0 is measured.&quot;
&gt; : &gt; : &gt;
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; http://www.blazelabs.com/f-g-gcont.asp &quot;The first confirmation of
&gt; a
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; long range variation in the speed of light travelling in space
&gt; came
&gt; in
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; 1964. Irwin Shapiro, it seems, was the first to make use of a
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; previously forgotten facet of general relativity theory -- that
&gt; the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; speed of light is reduced when it passes through a gravitational
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; field....Faced with this evidence, Einstein stated:&quot;In the second
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; place our result shows that, according to the general theory of
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental assumptions in
&gt; the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; special theory of relativity and to which we have already
&gt; frequently
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. A curvature of rays
&gt; of
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; light can only take place when the velocity of propagation of
&gt; light
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; varies with position.&quot;......Today we find that since the Special
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; Theory of Relativity unfortunately became part of the so called
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; mainstream science, it is considered a sacrilege to even suggest
&gt; that
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; the speed of light be anything other than a constant. This is
&gt; somewhat
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; surprising since even Einstein himself suggested in a paper &quot;On
&gt; the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light,&quot; Annalen der
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; Physik, 35, 1911, that the speed of light might vary with the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; gravitational potential. Indeed, the variation of the speed of
&gt; light
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; in a vacuum or space is explicitly shown in Einstein's calculation
&gt; for
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; the angle at which light should bend upon the influence of
&gt; gravity.
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; One can find his calculation in his paper. The result is
&gt; c'=c(1+V/c^2)
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; where V is the gravitational potential relative to the point where
&gt; the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; measurement is taken. 1+V/c^2 is also known as the GRAVITATIONAL
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; REDSHIFT FACTOR.&quot;
&gt; : &gt; : &gt;
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; Let us hope one day your masters will inform the world about the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; fundamental questions that are torturing them every night:
&gt; : &gt; : &gt;
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; 1. Since the gravitational redshift is obviously the result of the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; variability of the speed of light in a gravitational field, in
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; accordance with the equation
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; frequency = (speed of light)/(wavelength),
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; why do we, hypnotists in Einstein criminal cult, continue to
&gt; destroy
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; human rationality by explaining the gravitational redshift in
&gt; terms
&gt; of
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; gravitational time dilation?
&gt; : &gt; : &gt;
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; 2. Since the speed of light varies with the gravitational
&gt; potential,
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; why don't we, hypnotists in Einstein criminal cult, apply
&gt; Einstein's
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; equivalence principle and show that, in the absence of a
&gt; gravitational
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; field, the speed of light varies with v, the relative speed of the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; light source and the observer, in accordance with the equation
&gt; c'=c+v,
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; where c is the initial speed of the photons relative to the light
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; source?

honesty/
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; dishonesty are not very important; let us see whether you
: &gt; understand
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; Divine Albert's thoughts. Consider the following text devised
by
: &gt; a
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; great hypnotist in Einstein criminal cult called Clifford Will:
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt;
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;
: &gt; : &gt;
: &gt;
http://admin.wadsworth.com/resource_uploads/static_resources/05344933...
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; Clifford Will, &quot;THE RENAISSANCE OF GENERAL RELATIVITY&quot;: &quot;The
: &gt; first
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; glimmerings of the black hole idea date to the 18th century, in
: &gt; the
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; writings of a British amateur astronomer, the Reverend John
: &gt; Michell.
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; Reasoning on the basis of the corpuscular theory that light
would
: &gt; be
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; attracted by gravity, he noted that the speed of light emitted
: &gt; from
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; the surface of a massive body would be reduced by the time the
: &gt; light
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; was very far from the source. (Michell of course did not know
: &gt; special
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; relativity.)&quot;
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt;
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; So Randy Randy Master Clifford Will considers a place &quot;very far
: &gt; from
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; the source&quot; where the gravitational field is virtually zero,
that
: &gt; is,
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; in Divine Albert's words, &quot;we are able to disregard the
: &gt; influences
: &gt; of
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; gravitational fields&quot;. And Master Clifford Will seems to
suspect
: &gt; that
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; Michell was right - apart from Divine Albert, many other
: &gt; hypnotists
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; have confirmed that the speed of light does vary with the
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; gravitational potential. However Master Clifford Will knows
that,
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; since the field is virtually zero, the observer there is
INERTIAL
: &gt; and
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; since this inertial observer measures a speed of light lower
than
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; c=300000km/s, Einstein criminal cult is in danger. So Master
: &gt; Clifford
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; Will introduces an extremely silly but efficient (in Einstein
: &gt; zombie
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; world) red herring: Michell did not know special relativity.
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt;
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; Two simple questions Randy Randy:
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt;
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; 1. Is it true that &quot;the speed of light emitted from the surface
: &gt; of
: &gt; a
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; massive body would be reduced by the time the light was very
far
: &gt; from
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; the source&quot;? Yes? No?
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt;
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; 2. If Divine Albert could somehow meet John Michell and tell
him
: &gt; : &gt; about
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; his special relativity, would John Michell stop claiming that
: &gt; &quot;the
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; speed of light emitted from the surface of a massive body would
: &gt; be
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; reduced by the time the light was very far from the source&quot;?
Yes?
: &gt; No?
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; Difficult questions aren't they Randy Randy. Even your masters
: &gt; cannot
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; answer them for the moment. Have you noticed your masters have
: &gt; been
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; silent for the last few months? There have been bursts of
: &gt; conscience
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; in Einstein criminal cult related to the fact that the speed of
: &gt; light
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; varies with the gravitational potential:
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt;
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExperts/ae13.cfm
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; &quot;So, it is absolutely true that the speed of light is _not_
: &gt; constant
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; in a gravitational field [which, by the equivalence principle,
: &gt; applies
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; as well to accelerating (non-inertial) frames of reference]. If
: &gt; this
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; were not so, there would be no bending of light by the
: &gt; gravitational
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; field of stars....Indeed, this is exactly how Einstein did the
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; calculation in: 'On the Influence of Gravitation on the

&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; &gt; Oh wait, there were... gee, Pentcho is being intellectually

&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt;
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;... in reality this is not the case. We can only conclude

&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; &gt; the special theory of relativity cannot claim an unlimited

&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; dishonesty are not very important; let us see whether you
&gt; : &gt; understand
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; Divine Albert's thoughts. Consider the following text devised
&gt; by
&gt; : &gt; a
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; great hypnotist in Einstein criminal cult called Clifford
&gt; Will:

&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; Clifford Will, &quot;THE RENAISSANCE OF GENERAL RELATIVITY&quot;: &quot;The
&gt; : &gt; first
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; glimmerings of the black hole idea date to the 18th century,
&gt; in
&gt; : &gt; the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; writings of a British amateur astronomer, the Reverend John
&gt; : &gt; Michell.
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; Reasoning on the basis of the corpuscular theory that light
&gt; would
&gt; : &gt; be
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; attracted by gravity, he noted that the speed of light
&gt; emitted
&gt; : &gt; from
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; the surface of a massive body would be reduced by the time
&gt; the
&gt; : &gt; light
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; was very far from the source. (Michell of course did not know
&gt; : &gt; special
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; relativity.)&quot;
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt;
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; So Randy Randy Master Clifford Will considers a place &quot;very
&gt; far
&gt; : &gt; from
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; the source&quot; where the gravitational field is virtually zero,
&gt; that
&gt; : &gt; is,
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; in Divine Albert's words, &quot;we are able to disregard the
&gt; : &gt; influences
&gt; : &gt; of
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; gravitational fields&quot;. And Master Clifford Will seems to
&gt; suspect
&gt; : &gt; that
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; Michell was right - apart from Divine Albert, many other
&gt; : &gt; hypnotists
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; have confirmed that the speed of light does vary with the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; gravitational potential. However Master Clifford Will knows
&gt; that,
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; since the field is virtually zero, the observer there is
&gt; INERTIAL
&gt; : &gt; and
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; since this inertial observer measures a speed of light lower
&gt; than
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; c=300000km/s, Einstein criminal cult is in danger. So Master
&gt; : &gt; Clifford
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; Will introduces an extremely silly but efficient (in Einstein
&gt; : &gt; zombie
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; world) red herring: Michell did not know special relativity.
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt;
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; Two simple questions Randy Randy:
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt;
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; 1. Is it true that &quot;the speed of light emitted from the
&gt; surface
&gt; : &gt; of
&gt; : &gt; a
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; massive body would be reduced by the time the light was very
&gt; far
&gt; : &gt; from
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; the source&quot;? Yes? No?
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt;
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; 2. If Divine Albert could somehow meet John Michell and tell
&gt; him
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; about
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; his special relativity, would John Michell stop claiming that
&gt; : &gt; &quot;the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; speed of light emitted from the surface of a massive body
&gt; would
&gt; : &gt; be
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;&gt; reduced by the time the light was very far from the source&quot;?
&gt; Yes?
&gt; : &gt; No?
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; Difficult questions aren't they Randy Randy. Even your masters
&gt; : &gt; cannot
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; answer them for the moment. Have you noticed your masters have
&gt; : &gt; been
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; silent for the last few months? There have been bursts of
&gt; : &gt; conscience
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; in Einstein criminal cult related to the fact that the speed
&gt; of
&gt; : &gt; light
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; varies with the gravitational potential:
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExperts/ae13.cfm
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; &quot;So, it is absolutely true that the speed of light is _not_
&gt; : &gt; constant
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; in a gravitational field [which, by the equivalence principle,
&gt; : &gt; applies
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; as well to accelerating (non-inertial) frames of reference].
&gt; If
&gt; : &gt; this
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; were not so, there would be no bending of light by the
&gt; : &gt; gravitational
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; field of stars....Indeed, this is exactly how Einstein did the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; calculation in: 'On the Influence of Gravitation on the
&gt; : &gt; Propagation
&gt; : &gt; of
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; Light,' Annalen der Physik, 35, 1911. which predated the full
&gt; : &gt; formal
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; development of general relativity by about four years. This
&gt; paper
&gt; : &gt; is
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; widely available in English. You can find a copy beginning on
&gt; page
&gt; : &gt; 99
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; of the Dover book 'The Principle of Relativity.' You will find
&gt; in
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; section 3 of that paper, Einstein's derivation of the
&gt; (variable)
&gt; : &gt; speed
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; of light in a gravitational potential, eqn (3). The result is,
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; c' = c0 ( 1 + V / c^2 )
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; where V is the gravitational potential relative to the point
&gt; where
&gt; : &gt; the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; speed of light c0 is measured.&quot;
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; http://www.blazelabs.com/f-g-gcont.asp &quot;The first confirmation
&gt; of
&gt; : &gt; a
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; long range variation in the speed of light travelling in space
&gt; : &gt; came
&gt; : &gt; in
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; 1964. Irwin Shapiro, it seems, was the first to make use of a
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; previously forgotten facet of general relativity theory --
&gt; that
&gt; : &gt; the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; speed of light is reduced when it passes through a
&gt; gravitational
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; field....Faced with this evidence, Einstein stated:&quot;In the
&gt; second
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; place our result shows that, according to the general theory
&gt; of
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocity of light
&gt; in
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental
&gt; assumptions
&gt; in
&gt; : &gt; the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; special theory of relativity and to which we have already
&gt; : &gt; frequently
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. A curvature of
&gt; rays
&gt; : &gt; of
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; light can only take place when the velocity of propagation of
&gt; : &gt; light
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; varies with position.&quot;......Today we find that since the
&gt; Special
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; Theory of Relativity unfortunately became part of the so
&gt; called
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; mainstream science, it is considered a sacrilege to even
&gt; suggest
&gt; : &gt; that
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; the speed of light be anything other than a constant. This is
&gt; : &gt; somewhat
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; surprising since even Einstein himself suggested in a paper
&gt; &quot;On
&gt; : &gt; the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light,&quot; Annalen
&gt; der
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; Physik, 35, 1911, that the speed of light might vary with the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; gravitational potential. Indeed, the variation of the speed of
&gt; : &gt; light
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; in a vacuum or space is explicitly shown in Einstein's
&gt; calculation
&gt; : &gt; for
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; the angle at which light should bend upon the influence of
&gt; : &gt; gravity.
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; One can find his calculation in his paper. The result is
&gt; : &gt; c'=c(1+V/c^2)
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; where V is the gravitational potential relative to the point
&gt; where
&gt; : &gt; the
&gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; measurement is taken. 1+V/c^2 is also known as the
&gt; GRAVITATIONAL

: &gt; : &gt; Propagation
: &gt; : &gt; of
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; Light,' Annalen der Physik, 35, 1911. which predated the
full
: &gt; : &gt; formal
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; development of general relativity by about four years. This
: &gt; paper
: &gt; : &gt; is
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; widely available in English. You can find a copy beginning
on
: &gt; page
: &gt; : &gt; 99
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; of the Dover book 'The Principle of Relativity.' You will
find
: &gt; in
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; section 3 of that paper, Einstein's derivation of the
: &gt; (variable)
: &gt; : &gt; speed
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; of light in a gravitational potential, eqn (3). The result
is,
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; c' = c0 ( 1 + V / c^2 )
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; where V is the gravitational potential relative to the point
: &gt; where
: &gt; : &gt; the
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; speed of light c0 is measured.&quot;
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt;
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; http://www.blazelabs.com/f-g-gcont.asp &quot;The first
confirmation
: &gt; of
: &gt; : &gt; a
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; long range variation in the speed of light travelling in
space
: &gt; : &gt; came
: &gt; : &gt; in
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; 1964. Irwin Shapiro, it seems, was the first to make use of
a
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; previously forgotten facet of general relativity theory --
: &gt; that
: &gt; : &gt; the
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; speed of light is reduced when it passes through a
: &gt; gravitational
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; field....Faced with this evidence, Einstein stated:&quot;In the
: &gt; second
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; place our result shows that, according to the general theory
: &gt; of
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocity of
light
: &gt; in
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental
: &gt; assumptions
: &gt; in
: &gt; : &gt; the
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; special theory of relativity and to which we have already
: &gt; : &gt; frequently
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. A curvature
of
: &gt; rays
: &gt; : &gt; of
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; light can only take place when the velocity of propagation
of
: &gt; : &gt; light
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; varies with position.&quot;......Today we find that since the
: &gt; Special
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; Theory of Relativity unfortunately became part of the so
: &gt; called
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; mainstream science, it is considered a sacrilege to even
: &gt; suggest
: &gt; : &gt; that
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; the speed of light be anything other than a constant. This
is
: &gt; : &gt; somewhat
: &gt; : &gt; : &gt; : &gt; surprising since even Einstein himself suggested in a paper
: &gt; &quot;On
: &gt; : &gt; the
