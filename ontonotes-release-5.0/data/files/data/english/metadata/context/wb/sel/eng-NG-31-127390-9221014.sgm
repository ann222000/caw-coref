Ever seen anyone with frizzy eyelashes? No, because straight hair is
more primitive in Hominids and mammals. Central Africans have frizzy-
curly body and head hair but the eyelashes remain straight.

Frizzy hair is recently derived due to lice in tropical inland, see
Papuans.

what about pubic hair?  And I guess the LCA would have the primitive
hair style and so that must have been some combination or permutation
of what we see in hss, trog and bonobo.

Still interested to know what you learned in your naturist days?

The coarse hair of the facial beard, the axillary underarm hair and
pubic hair is referred to as coarse hair, it is straight but kinked,
not curly, in all post-pubescent humans. It served/s as hydrodynamic
and thermoinsulative infill of the body voids and gaps (where
subcutaneous fat could not exist) during swimming/diving and probably
secondarily as apocrine gland scent dispersal material.

In the case of fathers during the diving/backfloating phase, the beard
probably supplemented the head hair as something an infant could cling
to while the mother was diving beneath and the father backfloating
above. Chimpanzees never went through this phase, so their hair
patterns differ significantly from humans.

Frizzy (curly) eyelashes have a severe adverse effect on survival since they

Cj, all eyelashes have a slight curl, East Asians have the least curl,
Central Africans probably have the most curl, but no people have
frizzy (super curly) eyelashes, for obvious reasons.

Lice eggs need to be well attached, frizzy hair prevents that.

It's evolution, natural selection against lice carrying pathogens
(typhus).

Frizzy hair is clearly derived from the ancestral straight hair common
to other mammals.  Most likely in the last 150,000 years, perhaps in
the last  20,000 years.

Straight haired Hs did not have frizzy haired ancestors IMO.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Chimpanzees never went through this phase, so their hair
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; patterns differ significantly from humans.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Define humans in this case.

&gt; &gt; All Homo post HP split.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; what about pubic hair?  And I guess the LCA would have the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; primitive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hair style and so that must have been some combination or permutation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of what we see in hss, trog and bonobo.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still interested to know what you learned in your naturist days?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Naturist days? I have no idea what you are talking about Charles.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he certainly wasn't referring to your days out in the bush
&gt; &gt; &gt; making dugouts, with a butted handaxe, from a rotten log.

&gt; &gt; How would I know? I don't know where he got that.- Hide quoted text -

&gt;   As a naturalist, I wanted to determine how and why human species
&gt; diverged from their close mammalian kin. I have done that with
&gt; perseverance, and with the knowledge and guidance of many, here and
&gt; elsewhere. Thank you.
&gt; DD

&gt; thanks anyway.... is DD still posting here?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ever seen anyone with frizzy eyelashes? No, because straight hair is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more primitive in Hominids and mammals. Central Africans have frizzy-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; curly body and head hair but the eyelashes remain straight.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frizzy hair is recently derived due to lice in tropical inland, see
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Papuans.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The coarse hair of the facial beard, the axillary underarm hair and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pubic hair is referred to as coarse hair, it is straight but kinked,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not curly, in all post-pubescent humans. It served/s as hydrodynamic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and thermoinsulative infill of the body voids and gaps (where
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subcutaneous fat could not exist) during swimming/diving and probably
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; secondarily as apocrine gland scent dispersal material.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cite your source for that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Go swimming and cite yourself.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the case of fathers during the diving/backfloating phase,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There wasn't any diving/backfloating phase, you made that up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Fallacies are your business, not mine.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the beard
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably supplemented the head hair as something an infant could cling
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to while the mother was diving beneath and the father backfloating
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; above.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think so....

&gt; &gt; &gt; You don't think, you regurgitate.
