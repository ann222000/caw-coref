This sort of fits with the loose leash walking thread.

Five month old Maybe is far from good on leash - she bounces,
she's interested in all things shiny, she irrepressible in a
good way.

She doesn't even understand what a leash is, no matter how
many times she encounters its end when doing a vigorous
bounce.  She's C+ on recall (Something Shiny! sometimes gets
in the way.).

Loose leash walking is low priority to me, though it will
happen eventually.  That said, how do y'all feel about working
with a driven dog?  Curb, control, contain, use it, lose it?

I'm dealing with a different set of compulsivenesses than
you are, but I really can't walk a dog that's trying to hang
itself.  I also haven't found that training the dog to walk

in harness, so I like to do some leash training even if I'm
not expecting a lot of precision.  My dogs run the gamut
from chooses-to-heel to pulls-too-much.

I remembering how many of the BC agility competitors used their leashes to
tug with the dogs while waiting for their turn.  Of course these dogs also
compete in obedience and have a perfect heel that they can turn on.  But I
think that having a dog like that means you want a dog with that special
drive and means that you should take special care to nurture it.

I intended loose leash walking as a metaphor to working with
or against a dog's instinct to, say, be inquistive or show
some other form of individuality.

I see handlers place restrictions upon their dog, sometimes
confusing them, like &quot;Here's the ball!  Sit, stay!  Here's
the ball!  Stay!  OK, get it!&quot;  I see stuff like this often
in agility.

The object is to get the dog to submit and there's some
folklore around ear-biting.  If you've seen &quot;Snow Dogs&quot; you

Some sort of ill-conceived positive punishment thing I could
perhaps wrap my brain around, but the submission thing
harkens to enforced alpha/pack leadership and I donut get it.

I tend to not watch dog movies; those I've seen piss me off.
If it shows up on TV I'll give it a try.  I believe Snow Dogs

I try and control/channel drive.  However, due to the size of my dogs and
all of my old injuries they have to learn loose leash walking pretty darn
early.  And they can turn on a pretty, heads up, animated heel when doing
formal obedience.

Seconded.  I have three extremely drive-y dogs.  You have to find an
activity to channel it.  For mine, flyball is their &quot;use it&quot;.
Over-the-top enthusiasm and drive are not only tolerated but encouraged.
Flyball is the rock and roll of dog sports.

I have to admit though that it was kind of embarrassing that my BCs and
a teammate's cattle dog X were carrying on flyball-style, screaming and
wailing about the unfairness of having to wait their turns to try dock
diving.

The retrievers were all staring at them...  &quot;So do you guys have, like,
Tourette's or something?&quot;

We need to work on that.

I am not sure if this is what you meant but Cali loves to tug.  I gave her
jobs, take off my socks when told (she does it for other's without being
told though too) and open the closet door.  If she was bigger, she could
open the fridge or freezer for me, or some dresser drawers.

Heh.  I'm on record as generally liking Millan, though I'm not
a groupie and I cringe at some of his stuff and I've corrected
some people who've misinterpreted his good stuff.  I don't
watch his show, though, at least this week.

Currently, I love all of the dogs who pass through here and
mine are behaving well (though Maybe is too damn smart).
Right now ('struth) I'm working Maybe on my version of gee and
haw.  Have I mentioned recently how smart she is?

That's exactly the reason for my post.  I like my new dog's

I think that I'd have to work hard to dampen Maybe's spirit,
so it's not an issue, I guess, since I'm aware of the
possibility.

But I see people who shut their dog down with over-use of
whatever &quot;control&quot; means to them or who over-emphasize drive
without respect to social skills.

Just ruminating.
