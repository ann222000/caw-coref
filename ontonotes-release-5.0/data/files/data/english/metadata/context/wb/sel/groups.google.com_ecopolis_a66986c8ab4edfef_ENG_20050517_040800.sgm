Wind farms are nothing new to some parts of the United States, where
tall, white wind turbines with their giant propellers tower over the
landscape, generating electricity with every sweep of their blades.

Now these windmills may be coming to an ocean near you, but not without
significant public debate and navigation of a &quot;hodgepodge&quot; of
regulations, according to recent University of Delaware research.

Willett Kempton and Jeremy Firestone, in the Marine Policy Program at
the UD College of Marine Studies, have been examining public reaction
to the Cape Cod Wind Project, the first proposed offshore wind farm in
the United States. While prior surveys show public opinion is divided
over the project, Kempton and Firestone's research has uncovered some
of the reasons - deeply held values and beliefs about the ocean that
will continue to fuel the debate, as coastal states grapple with the
pros and cons of installing windmills in the sea.

The policy scientists' study, &quot;The Offshore Wind Power Debate: Views
from Cape Cod,&quot; recently was published in the journal Coastal
Management. The article is co-authored by graduate students Jonathan
Lilley, Tracy Rouleau and Phillip Whitaker.

The Cape Cod Wind Project, proposed in 2001 for Nantucket Sound, just
outside Massachusetts state waters, would include the installation of
130 wind turbines, each 40 stories tall, that collectively would
generate enough electricity for most of Cape Cod. These wind turbines
would cover a 24-square-mile area of seafloor within view of the
shoreline.

To better understand public opposition to, and support for, offshore
wind development, Kempton, Firestone, and their graduate students
intensively interviewed 24 Cape Cod residents, made on-site
observations, and reviewed local press coverage of the proposed
project, as well as reviewed the results of three public surveys.

&quot;In terms of the opposition, the most emotionally felt argument, and we
suspect the most motivating one against the project, is that it would
intrude on a very special place and the creatures that live there,&quot;
Kempton says. &quot;Similar findings have been made about the importance of
the landscape in land-based wind projects,&quot; he notes. &quot;Our data suggest
that these feelings also relate to the seascape. There appears to be
something special about the ocean, a feeling that for many people
underpins their opposition to the project.&quot;

Some arguments pro and con were based on incomplete information.
Kempton said that some interviewees questioned the motives for building
wind farms in the ocean versus on land, believing that it was a way for
a developer to save money on land purchases. In fact, it is more
expensive to build at sea, but the wind is stronger there. Others
opposed the project because they felt it was being built in &quot;their
territory&quot;; many supporters and opponents expected an opportunity to
vote on it. In fact, the project would be in federal waters and local
hearings are required, but no votes will be taken.

Those in favor of the offshore wind power project pointed to the
non-polluting benefits of wind power compared to coal-burning and
nuclear power plants. Some mentioned successful wind-energy projects in
other countries, particularly in Europe. Other supporters felt that the
project would increase U.S. energy independence and security.

&quot;At the time of our interviews in late 2003, U.S. soldiers were engaged
in Iraq, and the destruction of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11,
2001, was still on people's minds,&quot; Kempton notes. &quot;Many informants saw
those current events as related to oil and oil security and thus to the
wind proposal even though we did not ask about these topics at all.&quot;

In analyzing public opinion about the Cape Cod Wind Project, the UD
policy scientists identified several issues that they feel are missing
from the current debate and merit discussion.

&quot;Several basic value questions and trade-offs underlie this debate,&quot;
Kempton says. &quot;There's the value of protecting the ocean and keeping it
free from human intrusion, the value of cleaner air and less human
infirmity and mortality, and the value of traditions like sailing and
fishing in New England. There's the issue of whether there is a right
to a local seascape that residents assumed would be there forever, and
the trade-off between proceeding now with an imperfect process to start
a clean industry versus first establishing proper procedures and
regulations for it.

&quot;Even more globally,&quot; Kempton notes, &quot;the public needs to decide
whether Cape Cod is willing to absorb the negatives of wind development
now in order to set an example for mitigating climate change, a
potentially far larger threat but one they can't solve alone. We
suggest that the debate would have a better chance for true engagement,
perhaps even resolution, if these values and missing issues were aired
and debated more explicitly.&quot;

In a related study, written by Firestone and Kempton, with graduate
students Andrew Krueger and Christen Loper, the authors point out the
need for a new legal and policy framework for dealing with offshore
wind developments and other new ocean uses. Their research was
published in the current issue of the Cornell Journal of Law and Public
Policy and almost simultaneously reprinted in the Environmental Law
Reporter.

&quot;Currently in the United States, any attempt to develop new uses of the
ocean such as wave energy, tidal energy, aquaculture, and others
requires the government to spin together a hodgepodge of laws that were
enacted prior to the development of these technologies and
applications,&quot; Firestone says.

&quot;While public debate over offshore wind power is likely to be centered
on environmental and aesthetic issues, the government's present
offshore framework places the decision in the hands of the Army Corps
of Engineers, which is a regulatory agency whose primary focus is
navigation and national security, thus mismatching public concerns with
regulatory priorities,&quot; he adds.

Firestone says that a restructuring of ocean agencies at the federal
level is critically needed in order to effectively deal with the policy
issues associated with new economic uses of the ocean.

&quot;Congress should consider consolidating the current two 'masters of the
sea,' the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the
Minerals Management Service, either into an agency within an existing
cabinet department or into a new cabinet-level Department of the
Oceans,&quot; he says.

&quot;With the recent policy attention the ocean has garnered in the past
two years due to the release of reports by the U.S. Commission on Ocean
Policy and the Pew Oceans Commission, a policy window has opened,&quot;
Firestone notes. &quot;In order to fulfill the promise of offshore
development while protecting the marine environment, it's imperative
that Congress devise an offshore regulatory regime that provides for
the sustainable use, conservation, protection, and management of the
marine environment in a transparent and equitable fashion.&quot;

Kempton, with Richard Garvine, Maxwell P. and Mildred H. Harrington
Professor of Physical Ocean Science and Engineering, Firestone, and
other faculty at the University of Delaware have begun offering an
advanced graduate seminar, &quot;Offshore Wind Power: Science, Engineering,
and Policy,&quot; believed to be the first of its kind in the country.

The scientists also have established a Web site on offshore wind power,
with links to their recent research articles, wind maps, and other
resources, at  .
