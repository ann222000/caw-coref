lifespan still increasing?

Greetings, all,

In his blockbuster book, &quot;Natural Cures 'They' Don't Want You to Know
About&quot;, Kevin Trudeau casts some doubt on the reliability of US lifespan
statistics. He says the stats have been falsified.

According to the official numbers, the average lifespan in the US is
currently 78 years, and is still increasing, although not nearly as quickly
as before. In fact, in the last few years, the lifespan has been going up
only incrementally.

Meanwhile, we all know that there's an obesity epidemic, the diabetes
epidemic, the cancer rates are going up, the allergy rates are up
dramatically, and all sorts of degenerative diseases are increasing.
Considering all this, why would the average lifespan be still rising? Seems
like a mystery to me...

Don't the obese people generally have a shorter lifespan?

In any case, this is what Trudeau says,

&quot;I hear a lot about the alleged fact that we are living longer than ever
before. This is categorically not true. ... The statistics on life span are
fraudulent and false. ... I have to tell you, every time somebody says that
we are living longer than ever before I want to scream. Again, I want you to
know that it's a lie. The government wants you to believe this because they
want you to believe that drugs and surgery are doing a wonderful job,
keeping in mind that the majority of money that is going in the pockets of
politicians all around the world is from the pharmaceutical industry. ...
The bottom line is people are not living longer than ever before. It is a
false statistic.&quot; (Kevin Trudeau, &quot;Natural Cures 'They' Don't Want You to
Know About&quot;, Alliance Publishing, 2004, pages 116-117)

But unfortunately, Trudeau doesn't offer any substantiation for his claims,
and neither does he offer any estimate as to what the true lifespan in the
US might actually be at this time.

So has anyone looked into this matter before? Any further info would be
appreciated.

Best regards,

Yuri.

I have heard that it has actually declined in the U.S. in the past few
years.  But even if this is true, there are many factors that can
contribute--epidemics, immigration, etc.
Of course, if you are going to posit that life expectancy at birth has
not increased, the burden of proof is on Trudeau.  So, where does he get
his figures?

&gt; There are two issues here.

&gt; As to lifespan... Be sure you understand exactly what lifespan data
&gt; says. In this case, your logic may be correct, but the effect has not
&gt; yet affected the lifespan of those now dying. It may affect later
&gt; statistics.

Maybe, might be...

But, actually, these trends are not exactly new, so they should already be
showing up in the stats.

Steve,

This would certainly make sense. After all, the government obviously keeps
lying about lots of other things, so why would they tell us the truth about
life expectancy?

Or maybe things like Vioxx? They say it killed as many as 100,000!

Maybe he got some inside scoop somewhere? But, in any case, there should be
some ways to double check on the govt life stats. Just like this economist
guy found a way to double check on the govt economic stats...

I was just wondering if anyone has tried doing this before, but so far
wasn't able to turn up much on the Net.

Oh, this thing again?  It blames every death from bedsores on the

I can't comment on the bedsore stats other than to say
it is rather commen event. I recall a LPN taking me on your
rounds back in the day, She had about 20 patients in which
she packed gauze into the bed sores. And before she packed
the gauze, she took the old gauze out which is a sight
you'll remember. All the folks were completely immobile and seem out
of it
due to dementia (?) or stroke.

Nurses are trained to move their charges every three hours
to prevent bed sores.
Nice in theory, but some the extreme
elderly nurse home clients and med surg ward clients
are frozen in place such a new position is just
about impossible. The bean counters and regulators
should try their hands at it for a month.

Further, the elderly are more prone to bedsores as tissue repair
has slowed due a lack of enough of IGF-1.

Greetings, all,

I tried to look on the Net for any websites that might be sceptical about
the official lifespan stats. Well, I didn't find much.

Here's one website I found. It's by Carrie Taranova, and I don't necessarily
agree with some of the other things she says there. Besides medical info,
she also has lots of political stuff.

Among other things, she claims that today's real lifespan is 54 years old!
Well, I don't think it's _that_ low! :(

Her comments about average lifespan are mostly asides scattered around in
her various articles,

[quote]

http://home1.gte.net/carriet/ChangedReplacedAmendments.htm

Some of us are old enough to remember what some freedom was like.  It was
wonderful !  That is why people of old lived longer than the short lives we
have today under all this pressure, stress, strange GE foods ad all those
dangerous additives and vaccinations and drugs, etc.,  and threats we are
under constantly from this so-called &quot;government&quot; !  Yes !  WE do NOT live
as long as the 'powers that be' have their media tell us we do !  OUR
today's real lifespan is 54 and going down every 10 years !  All you have to
do is pay attention to the deaths reported on the news, and those are just a
few !   That is just another deception and lie we have been fed to cover
over what they are doing to our health !  See my other web site pages to see
about this in detail.  We will never have any Bob Hope's or George Burns' in
our last three generations !  The only long-livers come from the old time
generations !  Once they are gone - you will never see it again to have
anyone live to see 100 or even 90 !

We are raised on government-controlled GE foods that kill you, so never
expect this sickly society to get any better.  This Corporation will never
let you know that we are the most drugged and unhealthy people on the planet
!  That the drug companies run this nation and have everyone on at least
three or more &quot;necessary&quot; drugs for life - and they begin drugging us when
we are in elementary school or even before !!   We are even having LIVE
VIRUS sprays put on our foods (the e-coli lettuce/spinach was NOT what you
were told it was from !  The Salmonella was next - both two of the six LIVE
Viruses in that FDA approved spray !)  Those who get my newsletter (Freedom
Report) know about this.  I sent out the report months before it happened on
this - BEFORE the E-coli happened !

[end quote]

As far as Americans being &quot;the most drugged&quot; people on the planet, I think
this is verifiably true. In re Americans being the most unhealthy people on
the planet, probably not true, but close enough AFAIAC.

I also agree with her about those &quot;strange GE foods&quot;, and vaccines.

And here's another quote,

[quote]

http://home1.gte.net/carriet/WorldGovernmentControl.htm

Our real average life span is 54 in the past 15 years and getting shorter
every 10 years !!  Don't believe the government propaganda they have their
media put out for you to feed on that we are living longer today !  It's a
big LIE !!!  They also tell us to believe that WE ARE HEALTHIER TODAY THAN
EVER BEFORE, AS THE LINE TO THE DRUG STORES AND DOCTORS OFFICES GET LONGER
DAILY !  AMERICA IS THE MOST UNHEALTHIEST NATION ON EARTH !!

Do you think that all these extra 'fat people' we suddenly have now is an
accident ???  Or that it 'just happened' ???

Think again !!!

[end quote]

Here's some more,

[quote]

http://home1.gte.net/carriet/GE_Foods.htm

We are continuously told by the government's mouthpiece (the media) how we
are living longer, and we are 'more healthy' than ever before.  This LIE is
being believed by the gullible public.  Our average life span today (this is
2005 now) and for the past decade has been 54 years.  How the long list of
notable people who have dropped dead at this age (and younger like Reggie
White at 43) should be enough to SHOW people how we have been lied to, for
as many of those we know, there are thousands dropping dead (usually from
heart conditions) that we don't know .

Yet this LIE is still being allowed to be put out there without on one word
of objection or correction by anyone from the public to these media
mouthpieces !  This shows how brainwashed we have become !!

Aspartame - Nutri-Sweet -  (and Splenda is just as bad ! don't fall for the
hype of 'safety' on this so-called 'natural' product !) is well known for
causing the type of heart condition that John Ritter died from !  This is
not even mentioning all the brain damage this artificial sweetener causes !
So does all the MSG in ALL our foods, listed under all kinds of phony names,
cause brain cell damage !  These things are the reason we have Alzheimer's
and Parkinson's !!!  The Aluminum factor is just a part of it;  this is the
MEAT of it !

[end quote]

Any comments?

Yuri.

For Starfield, we get this,

&gt;&gt;&gt;the hospitals have nothing to do with this?

&gt;&gt; hospitals.

No need:  here's a nice discussion of why Lazarou's paper is
worthless:

http: www.gao.gov/new.items/he00053t.pdf

Recently, Lazarou, Pomeranz, and Corey attempted to synthesize
available data on fatalities from adverse drug events (excluding
cases of medication error).  To derive their estimate of 106,000
fatal adverse drug reactions in the United States in 1994, they
drew on data from 16 studies of adverse drug reactions published
between 1964 and 1995.  The studies cumulatively looked at 78
deaths, but only two of the studies had more than 10 deaths.
Moreover, the 4 studies published after 1976 included a total
of 5 deaths, compared with 73 in the 12 earlier studies.
Consequently, the projection of fatal adverse drug reactions in
1994 is based predominately on data from 20 years earlier, when
the use of pharmaceuticals was quite different.  In addition,
deaths were too few to arrive at a stable mortality estimate --
as even a small change in the number of deaths reported in the
studies would lead to substantial changes in the number of deaths
extrapolated to the national population.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  Moreover, the 4 studies published after 1976 included a total
&gt;&gt;&gt;  of 5 deaths, compared with 73 in the 12 earlier studies.
&gt;&gt;&gt;  Consequently, the projection of fatal adverse drug reactions in
&gt;&gt;&gt;  1994 is based predominately on data from 20 years earlier,

&gt;&gt;And thus, the true results should be much greater now!

&gt;&gt;&gt;  when the use of pharmaceuticals was quite different.

&gt;&gt;How was it different?

&gt; A lot of them didn't work as well, for one thing.

Says who?

Did they work as well as Vioxx?

&gt; I'm sorry that you're innumerate and don't understand why Lazarou et

I'm sure that if you had a real argument, you wouldn't have had to resort to
personal attacks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In addition,
&gt;&gt;&gt;  deaths were too few to arrive at a stable mortality estimate --
&gt;&gt;&gt;  as even a small change in the number of deaths reported in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;  studies would lead to substantial changes in the number of deaths
&gt;&gt;&gt;  extrapolated to the national population.

&gt;&gt;Yes, it would be a great thing to arrive at a &quot;stable mortality estimate&quot;.
&gt;&gt;So where is this &quot;stable mortality estimate&quot;? Do you have it, David?

&gt;&gt;If not, then Lazarou et al's results are the best estimate available
&gt;&gt;today.
&gt;&gt;If you have a better estimate, please present it here.

&gt; The point, you poor sap,

Ad hominem noted.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; is that you can't make any sort of estimate
&gt; based on the weensy amount of data they tried to use.  The numbers
&gt; were too small.

Obviously, Lazarou et al's article was good enough for JAMA. And you still
have no positive contribution to make...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;It is clear that your attitude is entirely negative; you're in a big hurry
&gt;&gt;to dismiss Lazarou et al's results, while offering nothing in return.
&gt;&gt;Thus,
&gt;&gt;you're trying to sweep this very serious problem under the rug.

&gt; The point is that, without data, we we don't know whether it's a
&gt; serious problem or not.

Any serious medical practitioner knows that adverse drug events are a very
serious problem. Why would you want to deny the obvious?
