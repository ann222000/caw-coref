THE THIRD EYE :

As far as love is concerned, you are too QUICK. You easily fall in love
with someone and leave him/her right away when you get bored.
2) Since you are scared of being cheated by the others or not wanting to be
disappointed again, you, therefore seem to be contented with your
unrequited love.
3) It takes you a long time and big effort before falling in love with
someone. But, once you are in love, you will love him/her with all your
heart, sincerely and forever
4) It is hard for you to get deeply involved with someone. Most of your
relationships are just more than friends but less than lovers.
