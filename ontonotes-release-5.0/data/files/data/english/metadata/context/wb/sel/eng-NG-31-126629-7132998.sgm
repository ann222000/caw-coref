been doing some thinking, and i was thinking aobut maybe using the new
tank i'll be getting(between 55-75g), and putting a few convicts in
there (there will be more in a few weeks im sure:P) and one jack
dempsey. would this be a bad idea? i want some larger fish, but also
fish i could breed, but not have only one species in a tank

also, i'd use a tank divider when the convicts breed, so there wouldn't
be any clashes between the JD and the convicts.

Since you're asking for opinions, I don't think what you're suggesting
is really sustainable.  The environment for these fish, which also
looks good and will serve as a home to fry, will be rocks and caves,
and that's not easy to put a divider into (and getting the fish to
cooperate, you go left, you go right ;~)

You might want to stock with a pair or Convicts and let the chips fall
where they may.  In a 75g, the Convicts won't bother other fish outside
of their immediate territorial boundaries, especially if they have
caves and/or many tank-mates.

Good tank mates might be a Firemouth, Rainbow cichlid, Severum etc, or
turn up the heat and include a JD but skip the Severum (the others
should be able to hide in caves if you have done this well).

Alternately, get 5 Electric Blue Jack Dempseys (good resale value) and
let them multiply in a well rocked 50-75G.  When you have too many
fish, pull most of the rocks, the parents, the rest of the rocks and
then the fry for sale (keeping the best of the litter).  In a 75g, you
might not even need to sequester the males away from the alpha JD, but
don't count it ;~)

Anyways, just my opinion, and everyone has one.

i'm not sure if im looking at the same fish as you, but i just rad up
on "blue JD" and apprently they produce infertile offspring. they also
cost about $30 each apparently.

Exactly, if they were easy to breed (ie: Convicts) then they would have
little commercial value.  They are color morphs (there are also Golds,
but I've never laid eyes on one personally).  They are not hybrids and
are (afaik) completely fertile.

has a pretty good description.
I don't think it's that difficult if you wanted to pursue this in a
low-key hobby approach, rather than in a hard-core breeder approach.
Whether it's regular JDs or culling for Blues, after a few years, you
still have tank(s) of JDs, but in the latter case, you have an
achievement and the sales profits will probably cover all your
operating costs.  You don't have to immediately decide if you will get
more tanks for line-breeding, but if you do, it could help finance
these new tanks ;~)

My understanding is that the Blues are smaller and less aggressive,
which is a bonus considering the pugnacious disposition of the regular
JD.

yup it's understandable, the easier a fish is to breed the cheaper it
is. I had already thought about breeding, and selling (not on a big
scale, just to a couple friends, or maybe put an add in the classified
when i run out of room) this woudl definately help cover costs. I found
another article on Blues, and the fact that they are more docile than
regular JD's is what caught my attention. they're also a bit smaller,
which might mean i could fit in another in the tank. but it would be a
JD only tank then if that were the case.
