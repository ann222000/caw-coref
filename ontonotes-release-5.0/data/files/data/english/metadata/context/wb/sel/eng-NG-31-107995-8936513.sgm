Hello all,

I was opening my trunk today at work, and my key snapped off on me in
the lock.  Since the spare was a half-hour away, and my wife's car is
out of commission right now, I had to figure out a way to get my car
started.

So, I managed to fish out the broken key with a piece of shim stock
and some careful wiggling.  I didn't want to have it welded, as I was
afraid it would either bust again in the ignition, or deform it so
that it would no longer work, so I made a new one.

The good news is that the new one works just as good as the original,
no sticking or wiggling required.  The bad news is that the key has a
computer chip installed in the plastic, so it costs about $40 to get a
professional replacement made, instead of $2 at the hardware store
like any sensible, normal key.

As it stands now, I may not *need* a replacement.  I got the metal key
back into the plastic casing and epoxied it in place, then dipped it
in wrench dip to cover the cracks where I busted it open to do the
job.  It doesn't look like a factory job, but repaired plastic rarely
does.  If it bothers me later, I can always made a new tab out of some
rare hardwood and make it look like I wanted to customize it on
purpose- it wouldn't be tough for me, and might even be kind of slick.

The thing that is worrying me is that every key I've ever seen (or at
least, any key I've ever noticed) is made from brass.  I didn't have
brass, and the laser cutter wouldn't have cut the blank even if I did.
So, the replacement is laser cut, milled (the slots) and hand ground
(the teeth) 304 stainless steel.  Every thing is within .001-.002&quot; of
the original, with the possible exception of the teeth.

But, I assume there is a reason why brass is the common key material,
and stainless steel is not.  I don't know what that reason is, and it
could be important.  If it's just because brass is less expensive and
easier to machine (I haven't priced out brass lately, so I have no
idea about the former) then there's no problem, and I can just use my
hand-made key and save myself $40.

But if there is another reason, perhaps related to contraction and
expansion that would cause it to quit working in certain weather or
low resistance to metal fatigue, $40 now would be much better than
getting stranded or paying a locksmith's fee plus the $40 I thought I
was saving later.

Normally I'd just pony up to have a new one made, but I've already
*got* this one because I had to make it to get home, and I can think
of better uses for my money than buying stuff I don't need.

Anyone ever done this, or have any input on why a stainless steel key
might be worse (or better?) than a brass one?

My off-the-top-of-my-head guess would be, as you suggested, that brass is
easier to machine.  I doubt the hardware store key-cutting machines would
last very long cutting stainless.

Differences in thermal expansion/conductivity would be minimal and
irrelevant.

Not sure if it is a dumb question, but could a stainless key &quot;wear out&quot; the
lock faster. The few locks I've pulled apart or repaired have had brassy
looking pins. Having said that I have seen the odd house lock key and better
quality &quot;secure lock&quot; keys that appeared to be stainless.

Also, I would guess that having a soft metal key would cause less wear to
the internal lock parts than a harder material key.

Most keys are brass, some are chrome nickel plated to give that
shiny look.
The only problem I can see when it comes to substituting stainless
is &quot;excessive&quot; wear on the lock mechanism.  That is only an issue if you
are planning to keep the car and may have to replace the lock down the
road.

It's so the key will wear before the lock tumbler pins and lock body
do. Replacing the key is cheaper than rekeying a lock.

Get the new key made or create one from brass yourself. It's cheaper
than having the entire ignition lock replaced by a locksmith or
dealership (especially at dealership prices!)

I don't know what it's for on a Ford, but my old lady's Buick has the
VATS (Vehicle Anti-Theft System) key.

She lost one, so we have only one with the VATS chip, and a new one is
over $100 from the dealer.  Not even the lock shops around here carry it
in stock, because there are 8 different resistors to stock.  So.....

Did a little fiddling under the dash (taking care not to deploy the
airbags&lt;G&gt;) and cut into the VATS line from the lock.  There I soldered a
&quot;dummy&quot; resistor to match the key (680 ohm, in this case).  Now, any
brass key (well... any that fits) starts the car.

I think your type of lock uses stamped steel wafers rather than split pins.
Making the key the wear item would make sense.

&quot;[L]iberals are afraid to state what they truly believe in, for to do so
would result in even less votes than they currently receive. Their
methodology is to lie about their real agenda in the hopes of regaining
power, at which point they will do whatever they damn well please. The
problem is they have concealed and obfuscated for so long that, as a group,
they themselves are no longer sure of their goals. They are a collection of
wild-eyed splinter groups, all holding a grab-bag of dreams and wishes. Some
want a Socialist, secular-humanist state, others the repeal of the Second
Amendment. Some want same sex/different species marriage, others want voting
rights for trees, fish, coal and bugs. Some want cradle to grave care and
complete subservience to the government nanny state, others want a culture
that walks in lockstep and speaks only with intonations of political
correctness. I view the American liberals in much the same way I view the
competing factions of Islamic
fundamentalists. The latter hate each other to the core, and only join
forces to attack the US or Israel. The former hate themselves to the core,
and only join forces to attack George Bush and conservatives.&quot; --Ron Marr

Normally when a new key is cut, there is not any special attention
paid to the surface finish of the surface that contacts the pins.  The
keys are brass and the surface finish quickly improves.  With a
stainless key, I would stone those surfaces smooth.  If you do that

The chip is still there- I cracked open the case, removed the metal
key inside, made the new one as an exact duplicate, and then
reinserted it into the plastic case.

Looks like the majority vote is for the brass key so that I don't need
to replace the ignition lock later.  Sounds plausible to me, and I
might try recoding a blank myself- $15 sounds a whole lot better than
$40, and I've been wanting a hideout spare anyhow, and the stainless
one will work very well for that- If I knock the plastic back off, it
becomes a key that will open the trunk and doors, but won't start the
car.  Perfect for one to hide under the trunk or something.

&gt; brass, and the laser cutter wouldn't have cut the blank even if I did.
&gt; So, the replacement is laser cut, milled (the slots) and hand ground
&gt; (the teeth) 304 stainless steel.  Every thing is within .001-.002&quot; of
&gt; the original, with the possible exception of the teeth.

&gt; But, I assume there is a reason why brass is the common key material,
&gt; and stainless steel is not.  I don't know what that reason is, and it
&gt; could be important.  If it's just because brass is less expensive and
&gt; easier to machine (I haven't priced out brass lately, so I have no
&gt; idea about the former) then there's no problem, and I can just use my
&gt; hand-made key and save myself $40.

&gt; But if there is another reason, perhaps related to contraction and

&gt; Normally I'd just pony up to have a new one made, but I've already
&gt; *got* this one because I had to make it to get home, and I can think

&gt; Anyone ever done this, or have any input on why a stainless steel key

I suggest not using a magnetic key holder. They're both too easy to

You can't hide keys in the new taillights nowadays. They're bolted in

Wear and tear.  Brass key melts, wears, chips, .....  The socket (lock)
is steel and doesn't melt, wears (since brass is soft) ....

So the steel on steel - you might have some wear down the way.
You have one heck of a backup - ID in it and all.   Buy a everyday one.

&gt; Hello all,

&gt; I was opening my trunk today at work, and my key snapped off on me in
&gt; the lock.  Since the spare was a half-hour away, and my wife's car is
&gt; out of commission right now, I had to figure out a way to get my car
&gt; started.

&gt; So, I managed to fish out the broken key with a piece of shim stock
&gt; and some careful wiggling.  I didn't want to have it welded, as I was
&gt; afraid it would either bust again in the ignition, or deform it so
&gt; that it would no longer work, so I made a new one.

&gt; The good news is that the new one works just as good as the original,

&gt; like any sensible, normal key.

&gt; As it stands now, I may not *need* a replacement.  I got the metal key
&gt; back into the plastic casing and epoxied it in place, then dipped it
&gt; in wrench dip to cover the cracks where I busted it open to do the
&gt; job.  It doesn't look like a factory job, but repaired plastic rarely
&gt; does.  If it bothers me later, I can always made a new tab out of some
&gt; rare hardwood and make it look like I wanted to customize it on
&gt; purpose- it wouldn't be tough for me, and might even be kind of slick.

&gt; The thing that is worrying me is that every key I've ever seen (or at

The new chip keys are often too long to fit in the usual sized
magnetic key holders.  Even when you grind the loop off them.

I put a magnetic key holder under my Mazda pickup and it lived in a
secure spot for almost 10 yrs, and I used it regularly....sigh

The new Ranger with its chipped key, was far more problematic.  I put
a magnetic keyholder (with a couple old keys inside and a chunk of
fishing line knotted through it) in about 10 different places over a
period of 4 month..only to find it hanging within a day or two.

I finally manufactured a camoflauged secure spot, and installed it
with nuts and bolts, to put a key holder in.  After a month..the key
holder was still in place..so I stuck actual keys in it.  So far..so
good.

&quot;[L]iberals are afraid to state what they truly believe in, for to do so
would result in even less votes than they currently receive. Their
methodology is to lie about their real agenda in the hopes of regaining
power, at which point they will do whatever they damn well please. The
problem is they have concealed and obfuscated for so long that, as a group,
they themselves are no longer sure of their goals. They are a collection of
wild-eyed splinter groups, all holding a grab-bag of dreams and wishes. Some
want a Socialist, secular-humanist state, others the repeal of the Second
Amendment. Some want same sex/different species marriage, others want voting
rights for trees, fish, coal and bugs. Some want cradle to grave care and
complete subservience to the government nanny state, others want a culture
that walks in lockstep and speaks only with intonations of political
correctness. I view the American liberals in much the same way I view the
competing factions of Islamic
fundamentalists. The latter hate each other to the core, and only join
forces to attack the US or Israel. The former hate themselves to the core,
and only join forces to attack George Bush and conservatives.&quot; --Ron Marr

Put a spare door key in your wallet and hide the ignition
key somewhere inside the car/truck. I don't think you need
the chip for opening the door (shrug, could be wrong).

I just used a thin piece of leather cut to the size of a
credit card. Make a couple small slits across it about 1/2
inch long to loop over the key. Some crappy ASCII art:

+=======+
| xx xx |
| xx xx |
| __ __ |
| __ __ |
|  x  x |
|  x  x |
+=======+

The &quot;x's&quot; are the key and the underlines are the slits.
Works good for two keys.

The main reason for brass keys is ease of cutting the blanks on a key
machine or punch. Stainless would be a real bear to cut.
Also if you look at a machine cut key you will find that the edge of the
cut is rough. That is due to the cutting machines burr cutter. With the
soft brass that edge isn't a big deal since it will wear on the pins in
the lock and not just chew them down. As long as the cuts you made are
nice and smooth your key is likely going to do less damage than the
normal brass blank.

The chip in most of the keys is an RF chip just like the ones used in
stores inventory control systems. They tell the computer that you have
the proper key (most of them only need to be held near the column for
the transponder to read the chip) The ones that have a built in resistor
for contacts in the switch (GM and some Fords) do the same thing
mechanically.

You can have a none chip key copy of your chipped key, and it will
open the door.  Hide a chipped spare somewhere in the vehicle, and
then even if you lose the outside spare, you are only out a couple
bucks, rather than the full price of the chipped key.

Which is what I have done.

wild-eyed splinter groups, all holding a grab-bag of dreams and wishes. Some
want a Socialist, secular-humanist state, others the repeal of the Second
Amendment. Some want same sex/different species marriage, others want voting
rights for trees, fish, coal and bugs. Some want cradle to grave care and
complete subservience to the government nanny state, others want a culture
that walks in lockstep and speaks only with intonations of political
correctness. I view the American liberals in much the same way I view the
competing factions of Islamic
fundamentalists. The latter hate each other to the core, and only join
forces to attack the US or Israel. The former hate themselves to the core,
and only join forces to attack George Bush and conservatives.&quot; --Ron Marr
