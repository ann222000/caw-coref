So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down the new day,
Nothing gold can stay.

C: Art Project

Give students binder paper to brainstorm ideas and come up with a rough

draft for there poem. Have them write about Halloween and fall. A
good suggested length for the poem is 6 lines. Once they complete
their poem have them cut out black and orange construction paper and
color a surrounding for their poem. (You can laminate it and have the

students use it as a placemat!)

(It is also a good idea to write your own Fall/Halloween poem to use as

an example for your class)
