Folks,

Yesterday I spent nearly 2 hours trying to get through many inches of
repeated text and finally gave up!

- PLEASE - PLEASE - PLEASE:

1. Change Subject lines, and
2. Trim your posts

Lots of good information otherwise is lost!!

A few days ago, under 'pinkeye', there were 24 posts and most had
nothing to do with pinkeye; under 'acclimating goats farm to farm' were
various topics; etc. ... :-(

Thanks!!
