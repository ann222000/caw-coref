_Chapter 1_

&quot;What kind of a client invites his smugglers to dinner?&quot; Wash asked, swinging
back in his pilot's chair, a laugh in his voice.

&quot;Oh, you remember Sir Warwick Harrow,&quot; Mal said, stepping back from the
communicator as it fizzled to static. &quot;Interesting sort of a fellow. Got us
some cows eight months or so back, if you recall. Also got me a mighty fine
collection of stab wounds last time we were arranging business.&quot; He folded his
arms and leaned back against the lockers.

&quot;Ah.&quot; Wash's chin lifted knowingly and he flicked a finger to point it at Mal.
&quot;Check. That one. The cows, I definitely remember.&quot;

&quot;And the stab wounds.&quot;

&quot;As if we could forget.&quot; Wash frowned. &quot;So he's got, what, more cows for us? I
thought after last time we weren't doing that any more.&quot;

&quot;Sad to say, we need the money. We're still hurting from Icarus and our last
job didn't begin to start covering. So. Back to some good old-fashioned crime
for a while.&quot; Mal clapped his hands together and pushed off from the locker,
galvanising himself to action. He flashed a tight smile. &quot;Best find me my
favourite date... can't wait to see her light up when I tell her she's an
excuse to be wearing that cake of hers again. Hope you got a suit packed
somewhere,&quot; he added, heading down the steps to the main part of the ship.

&quot;Wait! Wha - ?&quot;

Mal turned on the top step. &quot;Man said 'bring the crew along'. Guess that means
you and Zoe both get chance to show off your fancy table manners. Come on, Wash -
compared to Kaylee and my own self, why, the two of you are positively
cultured. Shouldn't be any great trial. And the food has to be better'n what
we've been eating here these past weeks, you can't deny.&quot;

&quot;Well, that's true,&quot; Wash allowed.

&quot;See if Inara can't lend Zoe a slinky dress.&quot; Mal tossed the suggestion over
his shoulder halfway down the steps.

Book, Jayne and Inara were in the dining area. &quot;What's this I'm hearing about
real food and Zoe wearin' a slinky dress?&quot; Jayne asked - overeagerly - as he
walked in.

&quot;Got a client. Warwick Harrow. We know him - &quot;

Jayne was nodding already. &quot;Fellow with the cows. Thought we wasn't doing them
again?&quot;

&quot;Well, we are,&quot; Mal emphasized, annoyed. &quot;Man's a good client and we can use
the money. Just have to get used to the place smelling a mite fresh for a few
weeks, is all.&quot;

Inara wrinkled her nose. &quot;And the talk of fine food and dresses? You'll forgive
me if that makes me start feeling concerned, in light of what happened last
time. The last thing I want from this stopover is to be helping you back to
*Serenity* while you're bleeding all over me again.&quot;

&quot;Absolutely no swordfights,&quot; Mal promised. &quot;Just a quiet dinner 'tween friends
and partners in crime and misdemeanours.&quot;

Inara practically choked on a sip of her drink as she caught up. &quot;Sir Warwick
Harrow invited you to *dinner*?&quot; she asked with a substantial amount of plain
disbelief.

&quot;And why not?&quot; he challenged. &quot;Got along plenty well enough in the past.
Business partners, you might say.&quot; He hooked his thumbs in his suspender straps
and smirked at her. &quot;Oh, I can well imagine what you might say, Inara, 'bout
him being some lofty Lord and ourselves mere lowly 'petty crooks', but... man's
got a job for us. Told us he'd iron out all the fine details over dinner.
Tonight. Guess that's just the way his kind of gent is used to doing business.&quot;
The ship wobbled slightly as she entered atmosphere and Mal looked up out of
the small windows in the ceiling at the colour of the sky. &quot;Believe it's in the
region of four in the afternoon right now, so there'll be a bit of space lag.
No matter.&quot;

&quot;I'll get myself ready,&quot; Jayne said, rising eagerly.

Mal stared him down, eyebrows raised. &quot;You'll be staying right here.&quot;

Jayne made a long noise of disappointment in the back of his throat. &quot;That
ain't fair, Mal.&quot;

&quot;Since when was 'fair' ever an issue on my boat? Harrow might've said to bring
the crew but I ain't stupid and I'm reckoning what we got here is more'n he's
figuring to contend with. Seeing as how we've to do business with the fellow,
I'm taking those crew technically qualify as crew and can manage rudimentary
table manners - and don't look at me like that. Folks who're spoilin' to get
taken out someplace nice public shouldn't ought to be those exercising their
body's less savoury functions around the mealtable on a regular basis.&quot;

Book, behind the counter in the background, suppressed a laugh. Jayne sulked,
slumping back down in his chair to another mumble of, &quot;Ain't fair.&quot;

Mal turned to Inara. Corner of her mouth had turned up, amused. &quot;Inara, I - &quot;

&quot;I have a client,&quot; she said quickly.

&quot;Well. That's nice for all of us, then. Whole lot of us making some profit out
of this trip dirtside. Exactly what I like to see. Long as it ain't our old
friend Ath, leastways. But as I was about to say, if you can spare the time
'fore you leave to get Miss Kaylee and our first mate spruced up and decked out
fine...&quot; He frowned, breaking off, and studied her face closely while he asked,
&quot;It's not Atherton, is it?&quot;

&quot;Mal... Since, thanks to your intervention, Atherton Wing threatened to
mutilate me if he ever saw me again, I'd consider it unlikely I'll be accepting
any proposals to spend intimate time with the man for the near future.&quot;

&quot;Uh.&quot; Mal drew his chin up and jerked it in somewhat of a nod, trying to exude
'satisfied'. &quot;Good. That'd be all right then... So who is your client?&quot;

&quot;It's *private*,&quot; she stressed.

&quot;Right.&quot; Awkwardly, he looked round 'til he remembered something he ought do
and focused his attention on Book. &quot;Shepherd, I'm afraid...&quot;

&quot;That's quite all right,&quot; the preacher reassured with a smile. &quot;I know I don't
really qualify as one of your crew.&quot;

Mal grunted. &quot;Need you here to stop Simon and Jayne killing each other. Reckon
you can pull it off?&quot;

&quot;Mal...&quot; Jayne grumbled.

&quot;Might take more than a few prayers,&quot; Book allowed, throwing Jayne a
conciliatory look that soothed the merc's pride. &quot;We'll all be fine,&quot; he
concluded. &quot;But... if I had *your* past record with the society of this planet,
captain? I'd be worrying about my own skin.&quot;

***

&quot;Sure you're gonna stay in that thing, 'little' Kaylee?&quot; Jayne asked, with a
laugh that could definitely be described as 'lascivious'.

She punched him on the arm. &quot;Hey! Ain't my fault the other one got ruined. This
is... it looks okay.&quot; Her eyes beseeched Inara for backup.

&quot;You look adorable,&quot; the companion said, glaring at Jayne.

&quot;What... happened to the other one?&quot; Simon dared to ask. He felt, as always,
removed from the preparations taking place around him. Those who were going to
dinner were readying themselves to leave; the captain in a dinner jacket and a
vest that were by now looking rather tired, bloodstains and some careful
mending still visible upon close inspection; Kaylee squeezed into one of
Inara's old dresses, which strained to accommodate her curves.

Kaylee pulled a sad face. &quot;Poor thing got caught when a circuit board I was
working on sparked off. Looks fine all hung up there in my room, but it's got
these burnt brown speckles up one side you don't see - no good anymore for
wearing. Still, it ain't like it's an easy thing to sit down in anyway.&quot; She
smoothed her hand down the gold fabric. It had red trimmings so dark they were
almost a rusty brown. She looked pretty. And... 'voluptuous', Simon decided,
was probably the word.

&quot;Just... don't breathe out too hard,&quot; Inara advised, wincing slightly. &quot;And try
not to eat too much.&quot;

&quot;Futile words if ever I did hear any,&quot; Mal commented, and softened his own
words with a flash of a broad smile.

&quot;You'll be fine,&quot; Book said.

Simon took a breath. &quot;You look very nice,&quot; he told her. It probably came out
somewhat... 'stiffly', as she'd say.

&quot;Thank you, Simon.&quot; She rewarded him with a grin, and looked at Mal with
intent. &quot;Can't he come? He's got the right get-up if any of us do.&quot;

The puppy-dog eyes were a formidable weapon in Kaylee's arsenal, but somehow
the captain resisted. &quot;Can't leave the boat on Persephone. Him and his sister
both. You know that. Law here knows of them too well.&quot;

&quot;It ain't fair.&quot;

&quot;I hear that word again tonight and there won't be nobody going to any fancy
dinners.&quot; Mal settled his gaze on Simon more with an air of rote as he said,
&quot;No leaving the ship.&quot; Of course, the captain understood that the last thing
he'd want was to increase River's danger of recapture.

Thinking of her was all the reminder his brain needed to focus on her
whereabouts; instinct by now long ingrained. She was standing by Kaylee, the
expression on her face intent as she looked down. As he watched, River reached
out and touched her fingertips to Kaylee's gold dress - so lightly Kaylee
didn't even notice - and frowned down at her own, which was somebody's discard
and sagged in the places it was too big, as though she was remembering when
fine clothes had been the stuff of everyday. They had nothing of hers anymore,
all left at home or at the Academy. He'd brought her out naked in a box. With
all that had been going on with her otherwise, it was the first time it really
occurred to him that might sadden her.

Simon edged forward quickly, caught her hand and squeezed it, and he pulled her
back so she wasn't crowding Kaylee quite so much. &quot;Next time we have money,&quot; he
promised.

&quot;It's only a skin,&quot; River said dourly, frowning at him, her eyes half-hidden by
lowered lashes. &quot;You can shed it. Holds you together... shapes and fits.&quot;

He wasn't sure if that observation meant she didn't want a new dress.

&quot;You know, you're right,&quot; Mal observed, who Simon hadn't even realised was
paying attention to the exchange. &quot;Girl needs clothes bad. Make sure we see to
it, next amenable planet she's okay to leave the boat.&quot;

&quot;Y-yes. Thank you.&quot;

Wash and Zoe chose that moment to make their entrance, hand in hand down the
steps. Mal's jaw worked a moment before he accused, &quot;You've been holding out on
us.&quot;

The two of them looked the part far more than Mal or Kaylee. It seemed that at
some point in their travels they'd picked up well-tailored clothes that could
have been made for just such an occasion; Wash in a suit that flattered his
build, Zoe in a long green dress that clung to her figure and was simply
astonishing, on a woman Simon was used to seeing in work clothes stained with
sweat and dust.

Still, it was Kaylee in ill-fitting gold that his eyes returned to. He even
found himself resenting Mal the opportunity to wear her on his arm.

&quot;Where'd you get the threads,&quot; Jayne asked Zoe, after he'd finished picking his
jaw up off the floor.

&quot;Wouldn't you like to know.&quot;

&quot;Well... yeah.&quot; His eyes narrowed on Wash.

&quot;My husband don't bend under pressure.&quot; Zoe's elbow dug into his side.

Wash shifted and announced, robotically, &quot;I will never talk. There isn't
anything you can threaten me with that rivals what will happen if I do.&quot;

&quot;See?&quot; Zoe said.

River dragged her hand from Simon's and walked away, making almost a dance of
ascending the steps to the rhythm of a slow, invisible tune - and he hesitated,
torn between following her and staying around to see the dinner-goers off. So
he missed whatever it was that Jayne said next, only turned around in the midst
of everyone laughing with, as usual, little idea as to the nature of the
joke.

&quot;Time to go,&quot; said the captain, clapping his hands and rubbing them together.
&quot;Wouldn't want to keep a bona-fide lord waiting, now, would we?&quot;

&quot;Take care, captain,&quot; Book said, mischief in his eyes, and Inara opened her
mouth to add to that.

Mal said, &quot;When are you people gonna let that drop?&quot; He held out his arm to
Kaylee, who surreptitiously checked out his rear profile, scrunched up her
mouth in thought a moment, then nodded approval before she accepted, all of
which went entirely over the captain's head due to the fact he was still
glaring at Inara. &quot;I'm letting this one defend her own honour if it turns out
she needs to. Such as it is.&quot; His smirk disappeared into a half-laugh,
half-gasp as she vengefully prodded him in the ribs.

&quot;Just don't come back full of holes, and we'll be happy,&quot; Inara said dryly.

Simon looked around vaguely, feeling an expectation he say something and
having, as usual, little to contribute. &quot;Good luck with the business deal,&quot; he
settled on.

Mal laid out a grateful open palm toward him in a 'see?' gesture. &quot;Least
someone cares to take seriously the key point behind all this inanity.&quot;

Wash and Zoe hung decoratively onto each other, an air of excitement creeping
through despite the compulsory nature of the occasion. Jayne had remembered
that he was sulking, and applied himself to it again with determination, but
Simon joined Book and Inara in seeing the party off as they headed down the
ramp.

Kaylee swung on Mal's arm like he was a piece of street furniture, inclining
herself backward to wave coquettishly to Simon as she was all but hauled
away.

***

&quot;Ain't it keen?&quot; Kaylee said excitedly, practically bouncing in her seat.
&quot;Little thing's half spaceship and half ground car. I ain't never been in one
before, but I read up on them on the cortex.&quot; She leaned forward and tapped the
chauffeur on the shoulder. &quot;Say, how high've you taken this sweetie? I hear
they can't break atmo, but with a couple modifications you can near skim the
upper atmosphere.&quot;

&quot;Kaylee.&quot; Mal caught her shoulders and drew her back to her seat with a muted
laugh. &quot;Let the man do his job. I ain't too keen on finding out how these
things feel hitting the dirt.&quot;

Wash, not completely without interest himself, held his wife's hand in his lap
and said to no-one in particular, &quot;Looks to have a decent manoeuvrability to
her,&quot; and subsided, aware of Zoe rolling her eyes in his peripheral vision.

&quot;Persephone looks real pretty from up here,&quot; she said, with a certain
determination. &quot;You don't get to see all this coming in the landing paths over
the docks.&quot;

&quot;Man must have some money to afford the flight permit,&quot; Wash agreed. &quot;Most
folks'd buy something like this and never fly it more than ground- or
low-level. Overpopulated rock like Persephone doesn't much like crowding its
skies. Permit costs more than the neat little ship.&quot; And he was aware of Zoe
rolling her eyes again, and shooting them imploringly over his head and
Kaylee's to the captain.

Mal remarked, &quot;I'm getting to thinking that maybe Jayne wouldn't have prettied
up so bad after all as a date. 'Course, he wouldn't have fit into any of
Inara's frocks...&quot;

&quot;I know you don't mean that, cap'n,&quot; Kaylee said sweetly, standing up in her
seat - making the whole mini-ship wobble in the air - to plant a kiss on his
brow.

&quot;Kaylee - &quot; They all spoke in unison, and the transport wobbled again as
everyone reached across the pull her back down.

&quot;All of you behave,&quot; Mal said. &quot;Wouldn't be much of a thanks to Harrow for
having us chauffeured from the docks, now, if we crashed his dinky hovering toy
car.&quot;

Which did the trick well enough, even if it perhaps didn't make a lifelong
friend out of the chauffeur. The man offered with a certain sour inflection,
&quot;It may be of interest to you, sir, that we're coming in over Sir Warwick's
estates now.&quot;

Wash leaned over Zoe to join her looking out the window. The ground below
ceased abruptly to be the busy industrial clamour of Persephone's main
spacefaring metropolis, ceding to an expanse of green at the line of a high
wall that became clearer as they lost height. Fields dotted with livestock -
speckled cattle, the fluffy white blobs of sheep, and a few distant brown
smears that might be horses. An avenue of trees led inwards to the main house,
and close by, a flat grey area that could only be a landing pad.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Kaylee said. &quot;That's a whole big chunk of prime land cut out the middle
of the city. I've even walked down that street there, and never knew all this
was just over the wall...&quot; She smiled up at Mal. &quot;Few more weeks of cows is
looking more shiny all the time. Ain't that right, cap'n?&quot;

&quot;I got no objection to cattle.&quot; Mal was staring back in the direction of the
wall as they came in to land. &quot;Mighty big wall. I'm thinking this place has
itself some major security and defences, too.&quot; Wash turned to him a puzzled
look. He was sounding, of all things, nervous.

Kaylee also caught it. &quot;Oh, but Sir Warwick's one of our favourite customers,
right? Apart from you getting stabbed last time, I mean. Got nothing to be
worrying 'bout stuff like security for.&quot;

&quot;Captain's just allergic to the smell of this much money,&quot; Zoe observed. &quot;It'll
pass. Let the fine beverages come out, and it'll pass real quick.&quot;

Wash joined in the laughter, though it did strike him - just a little, at the
back of his mind - that it wasn't often all of them got this high on life
without getting kicked in the tail, state of their luck. &quot;There's the man
himself,&quot; he said, pointing out to the edge of the landing pad as the engine's
soft purr died to silence, recognising mainly the red sash from the second-hand
descriptions. The man himself was squat and maybe a bit sour looking, and
didn't seem too much like a fancy lord.

Mal figured out how to unlock the hatch that swung up the whole of the roof
from the inside, confounding the chauffeur just as he was coming around, and
jumped down oblivious to the set of steps that hadn't yet been set in place.
Wash suppressed a smile. The captain was a fish out of water in these environs
if ever there was one. Still, he made a graceful enough show of picking up and
lifting Kaylee down after him, leaving Wash and Zoe to wait patiently for the
chauffeur and the steps while he strode out toward the squat man wearing the
sash.

Who in turn approached to meet him half-way, where their hands clasped easily
in greeting. So... maybe the captain wasn't doing so badly after all.

&quot;Captain Reynolds.&quot; The sour man cracked a smile that had a lot of cunning but
a measure of warmth, and Wash squinted, surprised by what he was seeing,
detecting a certain likeness of spirit between the two men.

&quot;Sir Warwick.&quot; Mal even managed to tip his head slightly in a deferential
greeting without a note of rebellion. &quot;How're you doing? Sure is a fine place
you got here... and mighty good of you to invite all of us over, too, might I
say... My engineer Kaylee here, you've already met...&quot; He set his hands on her
shoulders, presenting her, then turned and beckoned Zoe and Wash closer. &quot;This
here's my first mate, Zoe.&quot; Harrow took her hand and bowed deeply to kiss it,
thus proving the powerful innate magic of the Green Slinky Dress, picked up in
the more profitable times just after the raid on Ariel and saved for nights in
out of sight of the rest of the crew, and most particularly out of sight of
Jayne. &quot;And my pilot Wash.&quot;

Wash inclined his head awkwardly, darting a worried glance sideways to Zoe,
where she stroked her fingers over the hand that had been kissed, a flattered
smile on her face. And... yes, he couldn't help but feel the Green Slinky Dress
had powers too dangerous and potent to be loosed on the unsuspecting world at
large. He'd been dead set against it, he would say, if it came to violence.
He'd all but begged her to borrow something from Inara instead.

&quot;Now we're all introduced,&quot; Harrow said, with a slightly arch, gruff amusement
Wash suspected was a permanent part of his persona, &quot;Let me show you inside.
Everything's ready and waiting.&quot;

&quot;Lead on,&quot; said Mal, with an easy grin.

***

It wasn't the noise. Really, that was too dull to hear until right up close. It
was the vibration, like the noise was reverberating right the way around
*Serenity*'s hull and making the air buzz inside his eardrums. Jayne scowled at
the door, listening to the faint hammering and pondering on the situation for
all of a minute 'fore he yanked it back, sidestepped, brought his hand down on
a descending arm, tugged and threw, and slammed the door back closed again. He
leaned on it and glowered down at Badger, while outside Badger's flunkies
started hammering with fists and gun butts and other things somewhat less
effective 'gainst *Serenity*'s tough skin even than the wrench. Speaking of
which...

Jayne took a couple of steps to bring his foot down on the item in question
before Badger could reach it. &quot;Now, this here's an interesting situation,&quot; he
observed.

Badger looked up and pulled a quick face, then collected himself, picked up
that self from the floor and brushed it down; took off his hat to straighten it
out and then jammed it back onto his head as he stood straight. He set his jaw
and faced off against Jayne as though he was about a foot taller, not to
mention wider, than the skinny rat-bastard he was. &quot;Want to speak to that
captain of yours. Ah-ah - you're going to tell me he ain't here. Know how I
know that?&quot; He tapped the side of his head with an index finger. &quot;'Cause Badger
knows when his so-called business colleagues have been going behind his back,
that's how.&quot;

&quot;Huh,&quot; Jayne grunted, rolling his head to one side.

Badger's expression turned mighty sour. &quot;Warwick Harrow,&quot; he snapped. &quot;That's
my deal. I set it up, didn't I? Arranged the introductions. Now your Captain
Reynolds is trying to cut me out. I hear things, see? Got contacts. I know he's
set up some meeting with Harrow himself, to which I ain't invited.&quot;

&quot;You ain't the only one.&quot; Jayne snorted, drew back his leg and kicked the
wrench into a corner, out of sight among a mess of crates. It was echoed by
another crash quick after, and he frowned uneasily at the door.

&quot;Oh, and that - &quot; Badger turned aside and flipped his hat a few times in the
air. Nonchalantly. &quot;Suggest you let my people in before they start trying to
blast down that door.&quot;

Weighing how pissed Mal would be about Badger's people getting themselves cosy
on board his ship again against yet more bodywork repairs pulled up a clear
winner. Jayne snorted but hauled open the door. A couple of scruffy henchmen
fell through.

&quot;That's grand.&quot; The hat stopped its dance in the air, retreating to his head
accompanied by a satisfied nod. &quot;Now we can talk civil. Where's that pretty
first mate?&quot;

&quot;She ain't here, neither. I'm in rutting charge. You got a piece to speak,
speak it to me.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot; A mocking challenge to the word. &quot;So why don't you tell me how it is
that your captain's trying to cut me out of this perfectly smooth deal we got
going with Harrow?&quot;

Jayne shrugged. &quot;I dunno. Ain't like he ever tells any of us anything anyway.&quot;

Badger rolled his eyes. &quot;What gorram use are you, then?&quot;

&quot;Generally, I kills things.&quot; He flexed his arm with a smirk, ignoring the
flunkies' guns as they levelled. &quot;Cap'n won't be back 'til late. Got a dinner
date. Took those as had rutting table manners.&quot; He smiled, showing his teeth.
&quot;Y'can wait if that's what you want. Sure Mal's just itching to have that chat
with you, anyhow.&quot;

A laugh bubbled down from somewhere overhead. Jayne turned sharply and looked
up to see River sitting on the top steps leading down from the near walkway,
her knees bent up, the oversize dress stretched tight over them, with its end
flopping down long past her feet.

&quot;Just what you think you're laughing at?&quot;

The girl said earnestly, &quot;Don't worry. You wouldn't get the joke.&quot;

Which apparently made it Badger's cue to laugh. Fellow was looking all sorts of
interested in River. As she turned her eyes to his and curled her lips into a
smile, his laugh dried up and he pulled off his hat, fingers squeezing around
its brim, crushing it against his chest as he gave an awkward little bow.
&quot;Remember you, girly,&quot; he said, sounding hoarse all of a sudden. &quot;Didn't expect
to be seeing you again. Thought you was just a passenger on this wreck.&quot;

&quot;We're all passengers,&quot; River said with something of a wicked gleam. Her accent
had changed to match his, and Jayne remembered last time. An odd thing, but
then they hadn't known the half of what they did now, 'bout what the government
had made her capable of. &quot;Just there's some as knows it better than others.
Some knows what journey they're on and some don't. I'm thinking I know which
you be.&quot; She leaned her head forward keenly and winked.

&quot;Oh, no.&quot; Badger had got himself one hell of a nervous stammer there. &quot;Won't
catch me out like that this time. I know you ain't from the Colony.&quot;

&quot;You don't know where I'm from, though,&quot; she said, in her own voice. &quot;You don't
know which is real, or... you can't be sure.&quot; She stood, flattening out her
dress with tugs of fists clawed tight, and it seemed as though Badger wasn't
the only one harbouring a little tension. She slowly made her way down the
steps, that smile furtively creeping around the edge of her expression,
manifesting in odd glimpses and flashes.

&quot;Uh-uh,&quot; Jayne muttered under his breath. &quot;Ruttin' crazy girl...&quot; Where was the
useless gorram doctor when ever he was needed to keep his insane sib in check?
Hell, where was the gorram preacher? Far as he was concerned, only one he
didn't want to have here dealing with this situation was Jayne Cobb.

&quot;Pleasure to meet you,&quot; River said in Badger's accent, holding out her hand.

Badger didn't seem to know what to do with his hat. Fumbling, he stuck it on
his head. When he took River's hand and leaned down to touch his lips to it, he
had to clutch at the hat to stop it tumbling right off. Embarrassed, he
straightened, smiled determinedly, hand still holding his hat in place,
'parently forgotten in the moment. &quot;A pleasure.&quot; Jayne snorted and got a
sideways glare for his trouble. &quot;A real pleasure, miss.&quot;

River was still staring quizzically at her hand. She lifted it up and examined
it at all angles in the light. When she brought it down again, it was to reach
for Badger. Jayne winced and could only watch out of one eye, wishing he'd
closed both, as the crazy girl returned the favour. &quot;Awww... she's gonna have
to disinfect that mouth somethin' diabolical,&quot; he groaned.

&quot;Will you shut up?&quot; Badger swung around on him. &quot;We're having us a moment
here.&quot; He turned back to River, who had her hand to her lips - hell, maybe the
girl was gonna puke. Jayne backed off a way. &quot;What's your name, love?&quot;

&quot;Wouldn't you like to know,&quot; she responded, conspiratorial.

He chuckled. &quot;Woman of mystery, eh?&quot;

&quot;A few.&quot; She was speaking normal again. Badger was pretty lucky to have caught
her on a less-crazy day. 'Course, if she was screaming, throwing things and
cutting folks up, it might put paid to a few of those sexual fantasies. Or
maybe not. Never could be sure what was gonna float a fellow's boat.

&quot;Well, they call me Badger.&quot; The man pointed at himself. &quot;Not my real name,
'course. There's not so many as knows *that*. But I'll tell you what - anytime
you want to share yours, I'll start considerin' showing mine.&quot; He grinned.

&quot;Think I'm coming all over tearful, the two of you findin' each other has moved
me so,&quot; Jayne sneered. &quot;Hell, she's stark crazy, you're a ruttin' lowlife
snake... prob'ly a match made in Heaven.&quot;

&quot;I told you to quit butting in,&quot; Badger began irritably, then seemed to notice
his men still hanging around getting the whole show, and pulled on his lapels
with a sudden rush to reclaim his businesslike air, such as it was. He tipped
his head to River and said to Jayne, &quot;Your captain's over at Harrow's right
now, is he?&quot;

Getting rid of the fellow and packing the crazy girl back off to her brother to
be decontaminated seemed a hella good idea to Jayne right them. &quot;That's
right.&quot;

Badger nodded. &quot;Good. Then I'm thinking we'll go join them. Since we're all of
us here those who've been *unfairly left out of proceedings*.&quot; He looked around
them all and smiled smugly.

&quot;Join them?&quot; Jayne started to ask. And: &quot;...'We'?&quot;

&quot;That would be the pronoun I used.&quot; His jerked his head and the flunkies
levelled their guns. Jayne thought about the nearest gun, which happened to be
in his boot, and didn't reach for it.

&quot;Sure. Fine by me. Hell, I wanted to go to begin with.&quot; He eyed between Badger
and the flunkies and River, and said to the latter, &quot;You - get,&quot; pointing back
up the stairs. &quot;Go pester your gorram brother.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no...&quot; The hand that patted his shoulder almost earned itself a handful of
broken fingers 'fore the flunkies came to attention again. &quot;What you're not
getting here - when I say 'we', I'm thinking the lady deserves an escort to a
fine dinner much as any of us.&quot; He let go of Jayne's shoulder to hold out his
arm for River.

Jayne held his breath, waiting on River doing something crazy, or at the very
least telling the man where to get off, and maybe if they were real lucky
combining the two and stabbing him through the eye with the nearest sharp
instrument. 'Stead, the girl just asked, &quot;We're going to the party?&quot;

Badger's smug smile near split his face in two. &quot;Yes, we are.&quot;

Damn crazy girl took his arm and accepted his escort cool as could be.

_Chapter 2_

&quot;...So my point, Captain Reynolds, is that I will not conduct my affairs like a
criminal, no matter that they may... bend the law a little. If we are to be
continuing this arrangement, I see no reason it can't be conducted as any
honest business, in civilised fashion.&quot; Sir Warwick halted several feet from
the big, secure gate to look enquiringly at Mal, awaiting his response.

The captain had his head to the ground and his lips moving fractionally, for
the briefest of moments, as they'd sometimes do when he was considering. He
raised his head, and quirked his mouth into a smile. &quot;I'll freely admit, it
ain't the way we're used to doing things - heck, that part you can probably
tell - but I'm coming 'round to your point of view fast, Sir Warwick. Hell of a
spread you put on, and I doubt it'll get you any objection from me and
mine.&quot;

Kaylee managed to hold back a cheer and quick burst of applause, telling
herself that was prob'ly the very nice wines and the after-dinner liquors
talking. Cap'n hadn't hit anyone this time, so she could see it was her own
clear duty not to do anything to embarrass them likewise. Falling over would
probably count, she figured, and hung dutifully onto the captain's arm.

&quot;You say you'll be on Persephone another two days for re-supplying?&quot; Sir
Warwick asked, clasping his hand to Mal's elbow, and the captain nodded. &quot;Then
I'll have my goods over to your ship the day after tomorrow, and I hope we can
do business again, Captain Reynolds.&quot;

&quot;'Mal'. And we surely will, Sir Warwick.&quot; The two men shook hands warmly.

&quot;Are you sure you want to make your way back on foot?&quot; their host asked,
gesturing to a uniformed security man who stood by to open the gate - it slid
aside real smooth and silent, proof that someone was keeping its mechanisms in
tidy shape. &quot;I can always have Edward bring the car back around.&quot;

Mal shook his head, wearing a contented little smile and maybe a bit too
oblivious to how the rest of them might not feel so much like a long walk
across town in the fading light with the food and drink still settling on them.
&quot;No. Ain't far - 'sides, little Kaylee here already near assaulted your driver
on the way in, and that was sober. Best we walk.&quot;

&quot;Hey! Mean ol' tyrant...&quot; But Mal was grinning, and it was hard to be angry
with the captain when he truly was happy, it being such a rare occurrence and
all.

A round of parting nods exchanged, and then the gate was sliding closed behind
them, cutting from view Sir Warwick and his pretty home and pretty chunk of the
world, leaving them standing on a boring old street feeling out of place in
their finery. Kaylee was aware of Inara's gold dress straining its seams. That
warning about not eating too much hadn't held too much sway. Still, how could
it have, with the dried up protein mixes they'd been living off the past weeks?
Things were tighter than they'd been in a long time - since the time right
before Simon first came on board, maybe.

But they were looking up.

Poor Simon, she thought, crestfallen again at the reminder. Left on *Serenity*
to dine on the same old same old...

&quot;We need more clients like that one,&quot; Zoe announced as they began to walk
slowly down the street, hugging her arms over her chest to ward off the cold of
Persephone's approaching night.

Wash relinquished her arm a moment while he took off his jacket and draped it
across her shoulders. She smiled at him and they held each other close as they
continued walking, and Wash backed her up after a moment, prodding Mal with,
&quot;She's right, you know, captain. Few more like him and we'd be on our way.
Living in the lap of luxury... Now, just where do we find 'em?&quot;

&quot;Worth a few more swordfights even, I'd say,&quot; Zoe remarked with a wicked gleam
of humour.

&quot;If you're volunteerin' to be the one stuck full of holes next time,&quot; Mal said
amicably.

&quot;Oh, but you do the whole gallantry thing so *nice*.&quot; Kaylee swung on his arm.
&quot;And besides, it gives Inara another excuse to fuss over you, you know...&quot; Her
laughter died in her throat as she felt him tense. She might not have noticed
if she hadn't been clinging to him so; the only outward sign he gave was a
slight tightening of the lines around his mouth.

&quot;I'm sure Inara has better things to do,&quot; he only said. And quieter, almost a
mutter, &quot;Paying clients, f'r example.&quot;

Kaylee punched his arm. &quot;Now that's just mean. Would have thought, seeing as
how she saved all our bacon not so long since, you'd find it even in your stony
old heart to stop bein' so mean 'bout how she earns her livin'.&quot;

&quot;I am not being mean,&quot; he protested; acres of wounded innocence. &quot;Just making a
statement of fact, is all. Inara's got better things to be doing than doctoring
me, an' I got better things to be doing than getting stuck full of holes to
need doctoring in the first place, and besides... Haven't I told you enough,
that ain't *happening* again. Once. There was *one* swordfight. Not like I've
ever made a habit of them nor ever will. Why is it everyone's so mad to be
making an issue out of this?&quot;

&quot;Well, as social faux pas' go, it was a fairly spectacular one, Mal, &quot; Wash put
in, commiserating. &quot;I - &quot;

But the cap'n was squinting off into the distance, over toward a group of folks
who'd just rounded a corner and were headed right their way.

Kaylee did a double-take. &quot;Is that Jayne? Thought he weren't meant to come to
join us.&quot;

&quot;So it is.&quot; Mal dropped her arm and let his hand drift to the gun he wore at
his hip, fine clothes or no. &quot;Looks like... that's Badger with him? Hell.&quot; His
steps sped up, and Kaylee necessarily got dragged along too, since she couldn't
keep her balance alone. Behind her, Zoe and Wash had separated, though Zoe was
smoothing her hands down her empty sides in frustration and looking as though
she sore missed a gun of her own.

&quot;Badger,&quot; Mal greeted loudly as they closed in. &quot;Needed to talk to you - &quot; He
broke off, a cough catching at the back of his throat.

Kaylee blinked a moment, 'fore she saw what he'd seen too.

She hadn't noticed at once because the woman on Badger's arm didn't hold
herself like River and didn't walk like River, a haughty confidence replacing
that fuzzy distance and distraction the girl always had about her.

&quot;What the *niao shi de guay* is going on here?&quot; the captain demanded angrily,
encapsulating the situation with his own particular brand of poetry.

***

One moment he was all set to haul Badger from whatever lame-brained, paranoid
conclusion he'd gone and jumped to, the next a complete change of gear... his
glare went straight to Jayne. &quot;She don't leave the boat on Persephone.&quot; He
jabbed a finger toward River.

&quot;Ah. Captain Reynolds - &quot; Badger began, smug.

River, swinging on the runt's arm in a fashion almost aping Kaylee, overrode
him with a laugh and a smile. Her voice fair bubbled as she said, &quot;I'm coming
to the party. Look, I found an escort.&quot;

Mal ditched Kaylee on Wash's arm, figuring this here might be a situation to
call on his full attention. &quot;Dinner's finished, girl, and I can't say much for
your taste - &quot; He turned back on Jayne. &quot;*What*... is River doing with Badger?&quot;
He hushed his voice, to no particular end. &quot;This some *feng le* game?&quot;

Jayne shuddered. &quot;I sure hope so.&quot;

&quot;Oy,&quot; Badger said, slapping at Mal's hand as he reached to pull River away. The
move was backed by the swing of guns at either side. &quot;Forget the gorram girl,
Reynolds? She wanted to come... and it ain't no wonder, you keepin' her
practically a prisoner in that tatty rustbucket. Reckon you could afford to
ease up that military discipline o' yours on your crew, 'sarge'.&quot;

&quot;Badger, you're an idiot. You have no idea - &quot;

&quot;And you're a gorram sneak. Thought you was above all that - a man of honour,
right? - I did. Now you're going behind my back, trying to cut me out of a deal
you wouldn't have been able to get near if it hadn't been for me.&quot;

&quot;We've just been fine-tuning a few de - no, forget the damn deal.&quot; River there
was standing in the middle of the gorram street while they were jawing. &quot;We
have to - &quot;

&quot;Not a chance. Fine-tuning? Likely bloody story. I'm guessing you found
yourself another buyer out on one of them gorram moons at the arse end of the
border that you like so much.&quot;

Mal was keenly aware of tempers getting no better and two guns still on him. He
and Jayne were no closer to being in a position to draw without getting shot.
River was still laughing on Badger's arm. &quot;We were having *dinner*, Badger. You
weren't invited on account of how Sir Warwick can't stand you. We ain't trying
to cut you out of anything. You'll get your cut. *Dong ma*?&quot;

&quot;That's a...&quot; Badger made a swift survey of the faces watching - of Kaylee,
Wash and Zoe in their pretty formal dress, Kaylee barely standing - and his
eyes widened slightly 'fore his anger did a quick turnabout. &quot;You're having
*dinner* with Sir Warwick now?&quot;

&quot;Seem to recall it was your doing in seeing to it I had me a *social calendar*
in the first place.&quot; He glowered at River, who smiled innocently back, and
wondered how gorram much did it take to get the point across to a girl supposed
to be able to read minds that she wasn't precisely helping a situation. &quot;I'll
admit to a certain amount of surprise my own self, but I guess that's just the
way the fellow's accustomed to doin' business, and who am I to argue with that?
Hell, you getting me into that fancy ball probably gave him all kinds of
twisted a first impression from the get-go. I barely recognise me like this.&quot;
He tugged at a black lapel.

Going by Badger's face, the pint-sized crime lord was about ready to combust,
but a flurry of conflicting expressions came up at the last with forced
amiability. &quot;Fine,&quot; he said carefully. &quot;That's why I brought you into this,
after all. Deal with Harrow. Good idea of mine. Knew he'd take a shine to you.
Just you... make sure and keep me updated, all right? No more
misunderstandings.&quot; A swift gesture saw the guns relaxed.

Mal had no intention of following suit just yet. &quot;Hope you're not thinking of
absconding with any of my crew,&quot; he said, looking pointedly at River.

&quot;Wouldn't dream of it,&quot; Badger said. &quot;Mind, it does strike me I promised the
lady dinner. Wouldn't do to disappoint. I can be a gentleman, too, see?&quot;

Kaylee drew in a breath. Zoe stepped forward. &quot;You're going to have to live
with a little disappointment yourself. She isn't going with you... Come on,
River, honey.&quot; She held out her hand. River's smile finally faded as she stared
down at it wordlessly.

&quot;Now, hold up a moment here. What kind of a man do you take me for?&quot; Badger
growled. &quot;I haven't been coercing this pretty thing in anything. I told you,
she wanted to come. I ain't tried to get her to do anything unwilling.&quot;

&quot;Runt's speakin' truth, Mal&quot; Jayne muttered. &quot;You think I'd stand by watching,
otherwise?&quot;

&quot;...See? Even your ape agrees with me.&quot;

&quot;It isn't that simple, Badger.&quot; Zoe didn't retreat the hand. &quot;She can be...&quot;
She hesitated, seeing fury in River's eyes. &quot;It's not safe for her to be
outside the ship. And she gets confused, sometimes.&quot;

&quot;Girl's stark starin' nuts on a good day,&quot; Jayne saw fit to translate. &quot;You
don't want her. Got me a fine few scars from her more ornery-crazy days.&quot;

&quot;Mind that turning a blade on Jayne might be generally thought of as an
indication of perfect sanity in some circles,&quot; Mal said, &quot;But one thing he's
got straight - she's not going with you. Need to get the girl back to the boat. *
Now*. Way before now. Zoe - &quot;
