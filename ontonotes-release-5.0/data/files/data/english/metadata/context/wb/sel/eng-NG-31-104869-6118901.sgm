Ex-offenders can be saved from life of crime, prison

No one need be scared of Thomas Bevel anymore. He's caged up on Florida's Death Row for killing two people.

--------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------
What is scary, though, is that it took an act of violence for him to find a sense of peace. What's more scary is that there are probably others out there like him.
Bevel told the Times-Union, which has been picking apart Duval County's dubious distinction as the state's murder capital, that since he has been on Death Row, he now has 14 real friends. Said they're like a family. Said he never felt that in the neighborhood that was supposed to nurture him.
That says a lot.
It says that too many young black men are finding their comfort zone in prison when they ought to be finding it in their communities. Says that the lack of legitimate opportunities, along with a dearth of social capital, are causing too many of them to give up their power to build a wholesome life - and to give in to impulses that will ultimately lead to death.
But Mimi Silbert has been trying to counteract the forces that are turning out more Bevels. She's been doing this, in fact, for more than three decades.
Success with ex-offenders
In 1971, Silbert and an ex-convict started the Delancey Street Foundation in San Francisco. The foundation, which is fashioned like a kibbutz - an Israeli collective farm - is a place where former convicts live in a housing complex and run businesses so that they can get a grasp on what it means to be part of a real community and the power that lies in being able to build it up rather than batter it down.
The centerpiece of it all is the Delancey Street Restaurant, which is staffed entirely by ex-convicts and which has become a culinary fixture in the Bay Area.
There, former criminals find their strength in the power to create. Not to hurt or kill.
"People say that power corrupts, but nothing corrupts more than powerlessness," Silbert, a former prison psychologist, told me.
"If you can't use your energy to create, you'll use it to destroy. Our average resident is a serious repeat felon. We have people now who have been third generation drug users, and people who have been involved in gangs and have been violent...
"There's huge amounts of powerlessness in the world they live in, so much so that they really can't stop and feel, or else they'll be eaten alive."
Around 14,000 ex-convicts have graduated from Delancey Street, which has been lauded by prestigious organizations such as the Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation - the private sector continuation of the 1968 National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders. Delancey Street is serving around 500 ex-offenders in San Francisco.
"In the community where we are, crime is down," Silbert said.
No government funding
One-third of Delancey Street's residents are black, one-third are Latino and one-third are white. Twenty percent are women. Most stay for four years, she said.
And Silbert is doing it without government help. Profits from the businesses, she said, pay the bills.
She likes it that way.
"We put the burden on making the place happen on the people with the problems, so that they eventually find their place," Silbert said. "That way, they begin to believe they own what they're doing. They built the buildings and the restaurant, and they did it all by working together."
Delancey Street also has projects in Los Angeles and New Mexico, and Silbert is working to expand it to other areas. Many of its graduates have started their own businesses. One was even elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.
It's an idea whose time should have come a long time ago.
Threats don't work
First, it's clear that the threat of tougher sentences does little to snuff out new crops of criminals. Many of them will get out. When they do, they've adapted to life on the inside, and are still clueless about what to do once they're on the outside - and facing a gauntlet of employment and social adjustment issues.
Then they'll get themselves locked up for good like Bevel did - by killing someone. But the key to saving victims is by doing more to show ex-convicts how to save themselves, Silbert said.
"If you locked your kid in his room for 10 years, with all his favorite toys and his buddies, and with no responsibility, he becomes really good at being in his room. If you let him out, chances are you'll wind up sending him right back to his room ...
"So what happens is that they get really good at prison. It's very hard to let go of what you're comfortable with."
Yet, in spite of Delancey Street's successes, it troubles me that when it comes to helping ex-offenders fit in, someone has to create a whole new community for that to happen. But at the same time, I thought about how if such a community inspires ex-convicts to find their place - and their peace - in the community instead of in prison, then it must be a good thing.
A good thing worth trying here.
