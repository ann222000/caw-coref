Is a Constitutional Amendment necessary ?

First, a history check.  The Roman  Republic lasted 500 years because
the people
trusted and believed in its institutions.  There were two executive
branches:  the
Consulate (two patricians) and the Censorship  (two former consuls).
One year  of office as a consul was required in order to be appointed
to the office of
Censor for 18 months.  Among the censor's duties were: to maintain the
decennial census
for Army manpower needs; to supervise all public buildings and lands;
to screen candidates
for the Senate, and to bar those who were corrupt or &quot;addicted to
luxury.&quot;

Russia today is perhaps five years away from  a one party state, a
North Korean type of
personality cult, and a KGb-style, all pervasive security system.
Remember, it took only 8
years to go from Yeltsin freedoms (speech, press, religion, assembly)
to the lawless
State Duma election of December 2.  President Putin  wanted his new
bolsheviks to
separate into liberal and conservative camps, and it did not happen.
He gained nothing by
squeezing the fringe element, and now the chief national institution
has lost  its credibility !

The State Duma is now more corrupt than before.  The majority party
seeks to feather
its nest with a constitutional amendment  to change  the term limits
and allow
them to expand their collective worship of the new Lenin.  It is not
certain that Mr. Putin
likes the way things are going.  It is not certain that Mr. Putin
wants to extinguish  all
independent thought. A person who has the patience to teach Western
diplomats how to
use their laptops may see the educational value in a different sort of
amendment.

In most contemporary  societies  there is a natural tension between
forces of change and
forces  for the status quo.  When there is no tension, there is no
progress. [DPRK].
When societal tension causes disorder and destruction, there is no
progress.[IRAQ] .
Where social stress is resolved peacefully thru law and legal
institutions, we have both
social and material progress.

Russia has historically chosen central authority over independent
thought.  Russia has tried
many times to preserve freedom of expression thru literature and the
legal code, and the
nation has always returned to absolutism.  There remains the option to
institutionalise a
permanent opposition to the state by turning the environmentalist
movement into a
censorship. Because of global warming, there is no environmental
movement in any
country which can now be called anti-patriotic.  An amendment which
establishes  an
environmental directorate and which automatically appoints a 2-term
President  to the 4 years
command of  an autonomous ministry  will have an unpredictable effect
on Russia.

&quot;Autonomous ministry,&quot;   means an NGO Directorate which has its own
tax authority,
its own tax base, its own energy base and its own security service
(green uniform) as well
as a legal department to defend the certified NGO's  against  state
prosecutors in both
the governates and the Federation.  To defend  not  1937 &quot;show trials&quot;
where the witnesses are
beaten before taking the stand, but to defend in televised court
proceedings in which the viewer can see clearly whether the witness is
tortured, doped, or bribed.   This autonomous ministry does not
breach
sovereignty because the State reserves the right to regulate foreign
contributions to any group in Russia.

Televised  court proceedings  either at the governate court or the
Federation court, when there is
tension between the State and the NGO directorate,  will have a
profound educational effect on the nation.  Today's young  pioneers
will finally learn respect for the law in the proceedings they
observe.
