Very good. And as Mick suggests, equally welcome.

About the only thing that might add to this would be pictures of the
transformer at various stages in the process.

One thing to add about Coal Tar Pitch vs. Bitumen (which, technically,
is not &quot;pitch&quot;) is that it should _NEVER_ be heated (or poured, if
possible) inside any living area. Bitumen should be treated similarly
but has much worse shrinkage characteristics than coal tar, is less
stable in the very long run but is considerably less toxic (When hot.
Both are fine when cold). So, you pays you money, you takes you
chances. In the US, CTP is hard to find as it requires special
handling when used in roofing. But ask at any roofing supply for a
piece from a broken tube, you might get lucky.

Lots of outgassing on first-heating as well... .

It's a very good article. It reminds me of the paper Al Bereskin
wrote fifty years ago on building a 50 watt amplifier, but Bereskin
had photos-good ones.

However, I have honestly never had the serious need or urge to wind
power transformers because surplus ones are so cheap and adaptable to
all uses for homebuilt projects and commercial ones cheaper than you
could wind if you buy in any quantity at all.

There are three wind houses that will do EI lam power transformers in
10 quantity for not a whole lot more than it would cost me to buy wire
and lams. They also have toroids with prewound 120/240 bifilar
primaries they will put any secondary on you want within reason for
ten bucks a part Gorman charge plus wire plus the premade part-the
cost for example on a 300 VA part might be  $75 or so.

Nonetheless it's good reading. My only question is that of using tars
for potting-aren't there waxes now that are a lot less flammable,
smelly, and giving better protection?

I was able to buy about 10Kg of roof pitch from a guy here who repairs
roofs with pitch for a nominal fee of $20, and I'm still using it 10
years later.

Pitch was used for potting for many radio OPTs in the past.

I heat mine to melt it on a primus stove in the yard, definately not
inside the shed!

Its smoky and smelly, and probably toxic, but not as toxic as so many
other far more
dangerous modern chemicals which might have no smell at all.

I did once rewind a large tranny, then I potted it, but used pvc coated
wires,
and the pitch poured into the pot around the tranny melted the pvc
around the wires, and caused a short,
so I had to heat the pot and remove the pitch, and oh what a horrible
messy job that was.
The pitch sure wants to stay where it is onces is solidified.
Shrinkage didn't seen to be a problem at all. Certainly not if you pour
in around a tranny
to 1/4 full, wait for it to cool and harden, then pour is up to 1/2, and
so on.

So now after well varnishing the bobbin using Wattyl 7008,
I also rub in some hi-temp silicone sealant where pitch will touch
wires,
then use high temp sleeving, so no worries about pitch melting anything.

I have also use Wattyl 7008 two pack polyurethane for potting, but this
does shrink,
and no good used alone, and it heats as it cures, so I have added 50% in
volume of coarse
washed river sand to make a concrete. Once its poured in, and compacted
into place,
the sand sinks and sand has to be added at the top. Its also another
horrible messy
smelly process. And once the cure occurs, this concrete is impossible to
remove from a pot.

To remove the tranny, the potted tranny has to be placed in a fire in a
20L can with slots to place the wood around the can,
and also out in the yard in case it explodes, with pressure inside fron
gasses trying to get around the blob
of hard to shift potting mix. But I have not had one explode yet.
In the fire everything is heated until all plastics are vapourized and
burnt off, including
off the wire and the bobbin itself, and next day you pull the tranny
apart real easy to get the core
material for re-use, and place the remains of winding wire into the
re-cycling bin.

Hi RATs!

Patrick, when you talk about doing this audio stuff, you bring cheer
to my old heart. It is an honest joy to build it and get it right.

You sometimes complain about this and that, but, as a handmade
engineer I can tell you dark tales of meetings with people who went to
school where Dubya did. Those cretins could freeze your mind, and did,
at every opportunity. Yes, we audio nerds are often pains in the
seating area, but, there are even more disgusting animals at large on
this planet.Keep the good news flowing, I may never recover enough to
use it, but, it is great to read ;)

And next time you torch a tranny, think of being in a meeting with
those numbskulls staring at the table. You are living a life many of
us forgot about decades ago. And which may yet survive ;)

Good on ya!

Happy Ears!
Al

Puttin on tha agorny,
Puttin on tha style,
That's wot all the young folks,
Are doin all the while....

That was the first folk song I learnt,
written about 1855, during a gold rush in the USA.

Next was Tom Paxton's 'Little Boxes'...

Little boxes, Little boxes,
Little boxes on the hillside,
There'es a yellar one anda bloo one
And a green one and a red one
And they all looked just the same.

Then at about age 18 I thought about how I was going to fit into
the mess I saw around me everywhere,
and knowing I had to be slave to attitudes.

Fuck it, I thought, its all too much BS.

I did give in to BS when I married, and in fact I fell into the dreadful
trap
of believing my own BS, but when the missus became much more
BS affected by the BS going on around her after only 12 months and left,
i just opened the door like a gentleman.
I just thought, &quot;Goodbye BS&quot; and continued on earnestly not allowing BS
to affect me,
while mainly sheilas I met ranted that I was a &quot;minimalist&quot;.
The word that came so easy to me was &quot;No&quot;.
&quot;No, I won't buy that for you,&quot; I'd say, &quot;if ya want it, you
work and save up fer it&quot;. Usually this forced ppl to work out if they
really wanted it or not.
And so so much time was wasted during the youth of many young women I
knew wondering WTF
they wanted. They sure did want a lot, but just what it was, I didn't
much know,
and nor did anyone else, not themselves, so they all wandered around
dumb, really, and spent money
on such things as travel, and on horribilities of many kinds during
their &quot;liberations&quot;. All BS.

My attitude was quite socially poisonous for many....

I figured that wages were determined by the desperation of those
enslaved
to a culture of affluenza, where everything must be expensive,
especially
when raising youngans, and if I didn't breed, I'd get by on a whole lot
less income than those
who did, and who needed to be hooked on spending and BS. Wages were not
any higher because you had kids
or demanded a richer lifestyle.
I wasn't going to breed if it meant vast expense and BS. So I simply
didn't.
I wouldn't breed if I had to eat BS. I sure didn't need a Rolls Royce
either.
It's turned out I did everyone a favour by not breeding, because the
world
now needs more poeple like an overcrowded rat's nest needs more rats.

Occasionally, I will make a bad smell in my backyard while I go into
&quot;old fashioned activities mode&quot;. I have a yard I have paid for in full.

Those who might complain might travel hundreds of km consuming vast
quantities
of hydrocarbons in the SUV, and were they to complain, I would remind
them
of the frugality of my petrol usage in a tiny 1986 Ford Laser...but....I
pick my times to make a smell,
and never have had a complaint yet. I am usually far too polite to ever
mention
the effects of their offspring, and those of their grand children who
will hasten the
greenhouse effects, and wouldn't things been nicer if they'd kept
their one eyed snake away from a female when it mattered....and...if
only........
Anyway, i don't have to tell anyone to shaddup.

And I never watch TV, the real gateway to BS.

Patrick Turner.

No idea.

Plenty of potting compounds are available though from Farnell and other
suppliers.
Some has been especially designed to not produce heat as it cures, then
when it does cure
its a good heat conductor, and sticks like the proverbial to a blanket,
and does not shrink,
and isn't brittle. Such stuff is better than roof pitch, but +30dB
higher in price.
Removing such stuff later to retrieve a core is difficult.

Coal Tar Pitch is inert when cold, has excellent shrinkage
characteristics, resists most environmental chemicals, ozone, moderate
(anything a tube will generate in common use) heat and is cheap
relative to other materials dedicated to this application. That it is
toxic when liquid is also very real.

Coal tar has a dielectric constant of 2.0 - 3.0 (Teflon PTFE is 2.0,
Cocaine is 3.1). Air is 1.00004, a vacuum is 1.0.

Altogether a not-so-shabby material if handled with the care it
deserves. And one that is more readily reversed than many.

The pong when its hot and liquid tells me its toxic.

But guys working on the roads for years don't seem to mind.
The beer and cigarettes generally kill them before the tar fumes.

The occasional tarring experience required by cycling healthy solderers
who make the odd potted tranny probably doesn't shorten lifespan
greatly.

You comment &quot;Trying to get triple insulated winding wire is almost
impossible so making copies of McIntosh OPT is difficult.&quot;

I've recently had this site pointed out to me: http://wires.co.uk who do
DCC wire in various gauges. Would this be what you are on about? They
also do a hell of a lot of other wires - export to .au land may cos a bit
though!

Interesting. Bentonite is also used in wine making as a clearing agent.
It is sold in the form of a greyish/brown powder which turns into a
watery clay substance when dissolved.

Come to think of it, Chinese wines are something of an

Bentonite is used in the construction of farm ponds or &quot;tanks&quot; as they
are known in Texas.  It's a clay-like substance that is broadcast as
powder or granules onto ponds and settles into the crevices to produce a
waterproof bottom.  It's also used in the landfill industry to seal the
cells where trash is buried (stored).  It's used in oil/gas drilling as
a lubricant and drilling mud.

Yes. that it a good description of the way it is used in wine making.  As a
clearing agent, it gradually sinks to the bottom over a period of some 48
hrs,
taking with it the impurities which can make the wine cloudy.

You guys will never become makers of fine drinkable plonks,
the likes of which are made in Astraya, and France.

Forget Benton Ite. He's no good.

Whatcha want when you have just crushed all the grapes under the merry
feet of
many Italian Ladies, is a virgin.

Not single one of the Ladies is a virgin, but definately she who had
bredalot,
with at least 6 kids.

The Ladies Feet offset the wine's delicate molecular structures and
removes hope and purity from its taste,
and leaving it cloudy.

The trick is in the timing, and virgin quality.

Fresh young virgins who have waited a jolly long time before Roger
Arrival definately possess the most potent
treatment for the grapes when fermentation is just beggining.
The phase of the moon must of course be Full, and directly overhead, and
the virgin
instructed wisely by the Ladies of Feet. While feeling confident and
empowered the virgin
is introduced to the Plank.

The Plank shold be a suitable lump or fine Oak timber, 12&quot; x 5&quot;, and
spanning the vat.

The girl should be practised in walking the plank, and drinking adequate
quantities of last years's finest vintages,
but not to an extent that she be pissed to the eyeballs.

She is instructed to walk to the middle of the plank, in the moonlight,
naked as Nature Herself,
then stop, and sit down upon it, and in a fine proud position
she will aim her little pisser downwards, and let go with a generous
golden stream of Fine Virgin Pee.

This vintage will be at least equal or better than the previous years.

Patrick Turner.

Wikipedia covers all these bases and then some, albeit simply....
[A simple google search elaborates]
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentonite
&lt;excerpt&gt;
&quot;Bentonite can be used in cement, adhesives, ceramic bodies, cosmetics and cat
litter. Fuller's earth, an ancient dry cleaning substance, is finely ground
bentonite, typically used for purifying transformer oil. Bentonite, in small
percentages, is used as an ingredient in commercially designed clay bodies and
ceramic glazes. Bentonite clay is also used in pyrotechnics to make end plugs
and rocket nozzles, and can also be used as a therapeutic face pack for the
treatment of acne/oily skin.

The ionic surface of bentonite has a useful property in making a sticky
coating on sand grains. When a small proportion of finely ground bentonite
clay is added to hard sand and wetted, the clay binds the sand particles into
a moldable aggregate known as green sand used for making molds in sand
casting. Some river deltas naturally deposit just such a blend of such clay
silt and sand, creating a natural source of excellent molding sand that was
critical to ancient metalworking technology. Modern chemical processes to
modify the ionic surface of bentonite greatly intensify this stickiness,
resulting in remarkably dough-like yet strong casting sand mixes that stand up
to molten metal temperatures.&quot;
&lt;/excerpt&gt;

The last sentence might sensibly relate to Chinese transformer potting... IMO.

Actually, that's obviously wrong ... perhaps more toward the ceramic in the
first sentence. But has anybody seen any samples of said potting mix?

And where did the cat litter chinese whisper originate... ? Where will it end?

Anyway, congrats on the good work.

We know. Sad innit:-(( Even cheap wine here is expensive.
But we do produce remarkably good Vodka, Absolut, and Finlandia.

Hmm.  I have read a lot of wine making books, and been practicing
the noble art for some fiteen years, and now, only now, someone tells
me how it should *really* be done:-)

Now I am off the to the timber yard to get the plank, then the
supermarket to get 20 kilos of grapes . Anything I've forgotten?
