MAYA AND AESTHETICS IN KASHMIR SHAIVISM

VIRENDRA QAZI
C-II/2284, VASANT KUNJ,
NEW DELHI - 110 070 [INDIA]

PHONE NO. 26892972

During full moonlit night, devotees of Swami Vivekanand
were gazing at the resplendent sky from the yatch in the
mid sea.   They invited Swam'ji, who was inside, to share
their joy at the fascinating sight.

Swamiji remarked, &quot;If God's creation, His Maya Shakti is so
fantastic, can we ever surmise   His glory and  His
greatness&quot;!

This message, indeed, should permeate all of us.   We
should endeavour to think - whether we think this way? The
simple and frank answer is - no.  Perhaps, we face
insurmountable problems at individual, social and still
higher levels,   totally making us to lose our confidence.
That is why we call the world a great paradox, a maze,
beyond any body's comprehension.

We take the help of God to escape the stark realities of
the World.   We hold  Him high with due eulogy, but we have
unkind words for His Creation - the manifested World,
called MAYA.   We call it illusion, deluding, transitory,
etc.  Still, we have to reconcile with this situation.

As an endeavor to understand this puzzle, we can take
recourse to and seek guidance from our ancient philosophy
of Kashmir Shaivism.   This universal philosophy focuses on
relation between God, Nature and Man, which transcends all
the barriers of time, place and diverse human cultures. At
individual level it provides the complete analysis of human
personality and all the aspects of life are integrated and
taken in totality.

To understand Maya as per Kashmir Shaivism first we have to
seek the nature of Ultimate Reality called PARAM SHIVA who
manifests the total Bliss and Who is all complete in
Himself.   From Him emanates everything. He is beyond
description, beyond all manifestation, beyond limitation of
form, time and space.  He is eternal, infinite, all
pervading, all knowing and all powerful.   In fact, this
reality is ineffable and beyond all descriptions.

PARAM SHIVA AND HIS UNIVERSAL MANIFESTATION.

This manifested material world called Maya is part of the
great process of universal manifestation which we can call
&quot;evolution&quot; and &quot;involution&quot;.    Kashmir Shaivism
postulates 36 categories or &quot;tattvas&quot; to explain the
process of cosmic evolution.  Let us keenly focus our
attention to this process of universal evolution or
universal experience, i.e. from God hood to Maya Shakti
which is the veiling or obscuring force of nature leading
to various psycho - physical elements and finally the Panch
Mahabhutas - five great gross elements : Earth, Water,
Fire, Air and Ether.

SHIVA TATTVA

The first outward manifestation of the divine creative
energy in the process of cosmic evolution is called Shiva -
Tattva.   It is the initial creative movement of
Paramasiva. It is the static aspect of consciousness or
like support of all things in the manifest world.  It is
like the bed of a river or the canvas of a painting.   It
can never be seen, it can only be known by its effects.  In
this condition, the emphasis is on the subject without any
awareness of the existence of the object.

SHAKTI TATTVA

Since the Shiva Tattva represents the passive aspect of the
pure consciousness, it is dependent upon the active or
dynamic aspect to bring it into being.   This is called
Shakti Tattva.  Shakti is the active or kinetic aspect of
consciousness.

This Shakti Tattva or cosmic energy represents the force
that produces a strain or stress on the surface of the
Universal consciousness.   It is said to have three
principal forms to account for the three fundamental
psychological steps that precede every action.  Technically
the first one is called ICHCHA SHAKTI, the power of feeling
oneself as supremely able and of an Absolutely irresistible
will.   Second one is the JNANA SHAKTI, the power of
knowledge or knowing of consciousness.  The KRIYA SHAKTI is
the power of supreme action, creating or assuming any and
every form.   One follows the other in logical succession.

Page 4

Just as an artist pours out his delight in a poem, picture
or song, even so the Supreme pours out his delight in this
manifestation called Shakti.   When Shakti is predominant,
supreme bliss is experienced.  Mahesvarananda puts is
beautifully in Maharthamanjari.   &quot;He (i.e. Shiva) Himself
full of joy enhanced by the honey of the three corners of
His heart, viz ICCHA, JHANA AND KRIYA, raising up His face
to gaze at His own splender is called Shakti&quot;.

MAYA AND FIVE KANCUKAS (COVERINGS)

Now let us come to evolution of material universe.   The
power of consciousness to separate and divide is called
Maya Shakti.   This is the power to perceive differences.
The term &quot;Maya&quot; means illusion.   Here it is used to refer
to the veiling or obscuring force of nature which creates a
sense of differentiation.   As such, it makes universal
consciousness which is unity, appear as duality and
multiplicity.

The category of Maya is postulated to account for the
manifestation of &quot;form&quot; out of &quot;Formless&quot;, the finite out
of infinite.   So Maya is considered not as a separate
reality, but as the gross power of consciousness and is
referred to as Maya Shakti.  Maya is defined as the
limiting principle which reduces the universal powers of
consciousness and produces the state of limited experience.
It divides and disperses divine unity of the God head and
brings into existance the mind and matter.

Page 5

The products of Maya are the five kancukas or coverings
which are KALAA (limitation of authorship or efficacy)
VIDYA (limited knowledge), RAGA (from all satisfaction to
feeling of interest and desire) KAALA (from eternity to
limitation in respect of time i.e. past, present and
future) NIYATI (limitation in respect of cause and effect).

PURUSHA AND PRAKRITI

The result of Maya and its five coverings as referred above
are PURUSHA and PRAKRITI.   Here the dual world of mind and
matter is permanently established.  In order words,
although the Lord is absolutely free, He puts on Maya and
her coverings (five cloaks), forgets His true nature,
limits His power and reduces Himself to an individual soul
which is called Purusha and its objective manifestation
PRAKRITI.

BUDDHI, AHAMKARA AND MANAS

Now, let us come to the tattvas of mental operation i.e.
BUDDHI, AHAMKARA AND MANAS.  Buddhi is the ascertaining
intelligence which can be external i.e. a jar perceived
through eye or internal, like images built out of the
impression left on mind.   Ahamkara is the product of
buddhi.  It is the I - making principle and the power of
self - appropriation.  Manas is the product of ahankara. It
co-operates with the senses in building up perceptions, and
by itself, it builds images and concepts.

Page 6

We are continuing to focus on the cosmic manifestations.
The products of AHAMKARA are five powers of sense
perception or JNANENDRIYAS, five powers of action or
KARMENDRIYAS and five primary elements of perception or
TANMANTRAS.   The process of inevolution is complete
finally with panch Mahabutas as referred earlier.

Frankly, very important position is given to Ahankara.   In
fact, it is the product of SHAKTI through the intermediate
Prakriti which obviously is a mode of the Divine Energy.
Rajas gunas is prominent here and other gunas are in
subdued form.   One can understand significance of Ahankara
by the story of the Buddha Bhikshu Upasena.  As he tried to
over come this tattva by his &quot;sadhana&quot;, his body got
scattered because there was no Ahankara up-holding it.

It is Important to understand that, according to Kashmir
Shaivism, this analysis of all phenomena into thirty-six
tattavas has been worked out as a tool of understanding for
the ever-active and inquiring mind and as a form for
contemplative meditation.   At higher sadhana the number of
tattvas may get reduced.  Finally a highly advanced Shiva
Yogin may see only the Shiva Tattva in the whole of
creation.

DOCTRINE OF THE FOUR STAGES IN THE MANIFESTATION OF SPEECH.

To understand the manifestation of Maya Shakti from the
level of Param Shiva, it is important to consider the
process and stages in the manifestation of speech.
Bharatrhari, the originator of the philosophy

Page 7

of Sanskrit grammer, says in his Vakyapadiya: &quot;The
eternally existent Brahman, being the changeless essence of
speech appears in the form of the phenominal substance out
of which the process of universal existence proceeds&quot;.
The authors of Kashmir Shaivism have explained in detail
the concept of SABDABRAHMAN.

Speech is not only the means to convey one's ideas to
others, it is also a way to understand things personally.
When we choose to convey ideas to others, we generally use
spoken language, known as VAIKHARI.  A finer form of speech
that serves as the medium for thinking and understanding,
through which a person forms definite and indefinite ideas
about words and their meanings, is the mental speech called
MADHYAMA.   It is an internal reflection of manifestation
of awareness taking the form of ideas.  There is a still
finer level of speech, far subtler in character and resides
in the inner-most part of our being.   It is called
PASYANTI.  It is known as the &quot;be-holding speech&quot; because
through its medium enlightened people can behold all
objective existence within themselves.   Beyond this is
PARAVAC the supreme speech or the transcendental speech.
This consists of pure awareness of the self.   It is also
called PARAVANI.

This doctrine can also be understood by the example of an
artist's creation from the grossest to the finest level.
His tangible creation like a painting etc. can be VAIKHARI
and the images formed mentally, where his creation shines
within him in the form of MADHYAMA.   Before even this
exists a subtle creative urge like a stir, or restlessness
or inward flutter which is PASYANTI.   Finally, at  the
most

Page 8

subtle level, the original seed of the artistic creation
lies in the inner most center which is shining as PARAVAC,
the Supreme speech.

MAYA AND WORLD

For centuries Indian philosophers have been debating
whether this world is real or an illusion.   Many schools
of philosophy have interpreted the nature of Maya in
various ways.  As explained, Kashmir Shaivism maintains
Maya is based nether on the imagination nor any finite
being nor on any flux of mind.   Maya is Siva-Mayi: Divine
and perfectly real.  The universe is not mithya.   The
universe is Siva-rupa and therefore real.   It is a display
of the glory of the Divine.

Having recognized Maya as creation of God, we should accept
the world in totality.   No problem of society, state,
nation and individual is to be ignored.  A person cannot
succeed in any aim of life if he shuts his eyes towards
these problems.   Besides, there should be greater
understanding of others views based on sense of
accommodation.   This will develop correct perception and
contribute to furthering of human understanding.   Verily
it can be called practical Shaivism. AESTHETICS.

After a detailed analysis of Maya Shakti as per Kashmir
Shaivism let us come to development of aesthetic principles
in religious rituals.   In fact, in Indian thought
aesthetics has always played an important role in the
development of various schools of philosophy.    Frankly,
we   do

Page 9

not see God at some distant disciplinarian ruler of the
universe.   He is thought of as an intimate and   loving
master who is extremely beautiful and lovable.

Even in ancient times Indus Valley people worshiped their
deities with dance.   Vedic fire altars were constructed
according to aesthetic norms.   Rigvedic poetry, sung in
praise of various forces of nature, personified as gods
with human like forms, is rich in aesthetic valve.   Music
and song are still a central part  of the spiritual
practice among Vaisnava devotees.   Cave paintings at Elora
and Ajanta testify to the importance attached to beautiful
religious images in india during the Buddhist age.
Ancient temples and images at places like Khajuraho display
a highly developed aesthetics sense in the art of stone
carving.

Kashmir Shaivism is a philosophy that embraces life in its
totality.   Unlike puritanical systems it does not shy away
from the pleasant and aesthetically pleasing aspects of
life as somehow being unspiritual.   On the contrary, great
importance has been placed on the aesthetic quality of
spiritual practice in Kashmir Shaivism.   In fact,
recognizing and celebrating the aesthetic aspect of the
Absolute is one of the central principles of this
philosophy.

In this way, the aesthetic outlook of Indian philosophers
and thelogins reached its full expansion in the Tantric
system of sadhana or spiritual practice.   It is indeed
difficult to find any Tantric deity who does not posses
some powerful aesthetic charm for the devotee.

Page 10

Kashmir Shaivism is propagated a spiritual path that
focused on the simultaneous attainment of enjoyment
(bhukti), and liberation (mukti).   It accepted both of
them as the goal of human life, and developed philosophies
and methods that could be followed equally by both monks
and householders.   It did not approve of any form of
forcible control or repression of the mind, emotions, and
senses, but rather emphasized that such practices could
create adverse reactions that might simply deepen a
practitioner's bondage.

MUSIC

In aesthetics music has a very special role. The power of
music is highly appreciated in Kashmir Shaivism.   It is
included as an important aid to spiritual attainment and
forms an important sadhana in the process of spiritual
growth.  In the process of universal manifestation
explained earlier, ETHER (Akasa) is the finest of the
categories of physical objects (Panch Mahabutas).
Similarly, sound is the finest of the five specific sense
perceptions (tanmatras).  Thus sound or music is most
effective in subduing body - consciousness and arousing the
dormant blissfulness of pure consciousness.

As per Vijnanabhairava, the pleasure aroused by song and
music is accepted as a means to enter into the state of
pure and blissful consciousness.

Page 11

&quot;Yogins, experiencing their oneness with some
incomparable pleasure aroused by the experience of objects
like sweet songs etc. and fixing their mental attentiveness
on it, find unity with the Absolute Lord through a practice
of absorption in this kind of phenomenon (Vijnanabhairava,
73)&quot;

The great scholar Abhinavgupta always used to keep a vina
by his side and would occasionally play it.   He must have
found vina as powerful aid in the practice of withdrawing
his awareness from the world around him and focusing within
on the purer consciousness of the Self.

THE CAUTION

Concluding, it would be pertinent to add a word of caution.
A practitioner should not fall into a web of sensual
enjoyments and thereby lose sight of the higher spiritual
goals of life. In fact whenever there is something of real
merit and truth available, there are usually false forms of
it being offered by hypocrites who may try to deceive
people by ostentitious displays of Tantrism and through
misleading information about these practices.   False gurus
existed even in ancient times.

CONCLUSION

Finally all of the blissful and beautiful aspects of the
God are present in each and every person and living thing,
but they remain dormant because they are hidden behind the
mask of maya.   In other words, we are all blinded to this
inner bliss and beauty by our limited sense of who we are,
and by the habit of directing so much of our attention out

Page 12

into the world.  We pursue the outer object in an attempt
to rediscover the blissful state, not realizing that the
source of bliss is within and need not be attached to an
outer stimulus or some outer source at all.   This inner
beauty can be discovered and contacted at will through
simply turning our attention within and through the various
practices of Trika yoga.
