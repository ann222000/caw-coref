'04 Malibu Maxx V-6 (with 52K Miles) with floor shifter and button shift on
shifter handle. A few weeks ago the following started:
When shifting from D overdrive to D, the transmission will downshift to
second on it's own when lifting throttle. When throttle is reapplied it
shifts back to 3rd.
If I press the shift button down once while in D, it does not downshift to
2nd as it should (yes, I'm going slow enough.) If I slow down more and move
it down one more time it does not down shift to 1st gear as it should at low
speeds.
If I'm driving along in D overdrive and lift throttle and then reapply
throttle (As is frequent in 40 mph traffic) the tach momentary goes up
several hundred RPM and then settles back down where it was. It did not do
this before at moderate throttle pressure.

The dealer says the car is showing no codes of any type.

Any ideas?

The last condition you describe is normal TCC operation. When you lift, TCC
disengages, when you get back on the gas, it reapplies after several
seconds.
