When Imam Husain (AS) was born, Allah sent down the angel Jibrail (AS) to
congratulate the family.On the way down from the heavens angel Jibrail (AS)
passed an island, on which the angel Fitrus was sent to by Allah because he
had been punished on account of Tark e Awla. Fitrus had also had his wings
taken away by Allah.When Fitrus saw Jibrail (AS) he asked him where he was
going. Jibrail (AS) told him that he was going to congratulate the Holy
Prophet (SAW) and his family on the birth of Imam Husain (AS).Fitrus asked
if he could also go with him. Jibrail (AS) agreed with the permission of
Allah and so carried him down to earth.When the angels reached the Holy
Prophet (SAW) and congratulated him and his family, the Prophet (SAW) told
Fitrus to go to Imam Husain (AS).

When Fitrus touched Imam Husain's (AS) cradle his wings were given back to
him by Allah, who had forgiven him.

If you want something it is better to ask through our Imam's (AS) as they
are closer to Allah than we are.
