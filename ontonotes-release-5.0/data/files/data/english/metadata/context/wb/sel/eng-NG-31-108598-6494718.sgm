let us define free will as the ability to respond to stimuli with choice
in a manner that is not determined by any factor but itself

let us also define free will as the ability to have any response in with
the same criteria above, under conditions of no stimuli

those who believe in emergent behavior, believe all of our responses are
predetermined by biological means, in fact they believe all of our urges
and desires result from biology

these two theories are in conflict

I, for one, believe I have free will and that NOTHING determines my
choices but myself, I am not saying we do not have conditioned responses
to stimuli, but we choose based on will alone, what are conditioning is

the implication of free will is that no determined system, like biology,
which is determined by the rules of physics, can result in a free will

what follows is that we are not biology, but psychology, that has a
relationship to biology

this also means that are psychology cannot result from any evolution or
physically determined process of creation

it means, psychology is separate from biology in the sense of life after
death

and in the relationship of psychology to biology, it means there must be
an intermediate, since we do not consciously interact with our central
nervous system, yet the will exhibits times of domain over the body

those who believe in behavior that emerges from biology, emergent
behavior, believe a mysterious subconscious mediates the relationship
between the conscious and the central nervous system

but a free will would negate a subsconscious, in that the conscious will
makes the choices, not the subconscious

this leads to a disconnect in reality, if reality requires an
intermediate, the subconscious, that does not exist, there is a hole in
reality, and what we percieve is not reality at all, but an illusion or
dream, that is driven into us based onn our motives and emotions, by
higher intelligence

"Free will" may be treated similar to "consciousness",
as is treated in this Edge contribution :

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;NICHOLAS HUMPHREY
&gt;Psychologist, London School of Economics; Author, The Mind Made Flesh

&gt;I believe that human consciousness is a conjuring trick, designed to fool us into thinking we are in the presence of an
&gt;inexplicable mystery. Who is the conjuror and why is s/he doing it? The conjuror is natural selection, and the purpose has been to
&gt;bolster human self-confidence and self-importance-so as to increase the value we each place on our own and others' lives.

&gt;If this is right, it provides a simple explanation for why we, as scientists or laymen, find the &quot;hard problem&quot; of consciousness
&gt;just so hard. Nature has meant it to be hard. Indeed &quot;mysterian&quot; philosophers-from Colin McGinn to the Pope-who bow down before the
&gt;apparent miracle and declare that it's impossible in principle to understand how consciousness could arise in a material brain, are
&gt;responding exactly as Nature hoped they would, with shock and awe.

&gt;Can I prove it? It's difficult to prove any adaptationist account of why humans experience things the way they do. But here there
&gt;is an added catch. The Catch-22 is that, just to the extent that Nature has succeeded in putting consciousness beyond the reach of
&gt;rational explanation, she must have undermined the very possibility of showing that this is what she's done.

&gt;But nothing's perfect. There may be a loophole. While it may seem-and even be-impossible for us to explain how a brain process
&gt;could have the quality of consciousness, it may not be at all impossible to explain how a brain process could (be designed to) give
&gt;rise to the impression of having this quality. (Consider: we could never explain why 2 + 2 = 5, but we might relatively easily be
&gt;able to explain why someone should be under the illusion that 2 + 2 = 5).

&gt;Do I want to prove it? That's a difficult one. If the belief that consciousness is a mystery is a source of human hope, there may
&gt;be a real danger that exposing the trick could send us all to hell.

How is the choice determined by itself? You seem to be saying that

I cannot imagine a brain under no stimuli. No memories, no prior

As far as I can tell, you have only offered a series of unrelated

You have not yet supported them, explained them, or shown how one

society, etc, then why can evolution *not have produced it?

Perhaps free will is the illusion. The self seems to be. I really do

You believe in a lot of things that aren't true because your conditioning is
built into the language you use to think. We talk as if we had free will
because there is nothing to say about the real world which is beyond words.
Language is useful to organise groups of people to cooperate. For instance
planning and running a hunting party. Except for these practical things
language is just a game we engage in for amusement. I amuse myself writing

That's not a very productive way of defining free will, as the
defintion itself excludes it from investigation, by defining it as
something outside the physical realm.

The only thing this definition tells us, is that you have a religious
understanding of free will.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The cental word here is BELIEVE. You don't have any evidence for this
point of view, you just apriori choose to belive that this is how it
is.
That however was clear already from the way you defined free will.

A more productive way of defining free will could be, the subjective
experience feeling that you are making choices,

For my own part I think that a satisfactory explanation to
consiousness  will never be given. Sure, we will be able to pinpoint
the location of specific thoughts and decissions in the brain with
still better accuracy.
But you cant't have an explanation of a subjectiv experience, although
we may be able to explain how this experience arises.

Sorry I don't get this disconnect you talk about.

Can you speak to me in more plain English? I like your ideas that we
have free will, but no one in everyday life speaks like "Let us assume
that bla bla bla".

I just find formality hard to read, and to be honest it detracts from
your message by making it more boring,w hich is a shame as you are
talking about an interesting subject.

Anyhow, I agree we have free will...

My take is that biology affects our decisions. And that biology can
even affect what kind of soul chooses to reincarnate in a body. Kind
of like a driver's tastes affects what car he's gonna buy. But we
still have free will even if biology affects us.

I still don't get the disconnect...

My free will can affect anything. Not just my body but the world
around me. It's just a few trillion times tighter integrated into my
body. And even then, only into certain parts of my body.

Unfortunately, that is because I've inherited a body created by evil
souls, as I live on a planet of evil. Earth is the planet of evil you
know. On other dimensions, there is no war, no lies, no misery or
fear, and the creatures don't eat each other, although there are
things to eat, such as fruits and drinks or other things given to eat
instead of taken.

I think it should be possible to create a "soul attachment material",
sort of like a velcro patch for the soul, to allow souls to
reincarnate into robots... Of course, they'd have to WANT to
reincarnate there, or else they'd arrive, be like "oh wow this feels
funny.... but kinda boring, OK lets go now", and leave! If you wanted
someone to reincarnate into a robot you'd have to make it worthwhile
reincarnating there.

No, I communicated very well with my Thai wife using hugs, holding hands and

We only needed a few words of each other's language, mainly related to food
or money ie the material side of life. The spiritual/sexual (they are the
same thing) stuff needs no words. Free will is an illusion,

So you admit that your inventions are nothing but words and don't exist in

In other words they don't work and have no practical applications.
An idea has to be earthed to manifest in the real world. That is your
disconnect from reality.
You live in an imaginary world of your own and that is insanity.

All the evidence thus far points to the fact that humans do not
have "free will" and that we live in a clock-work universe where
effect always follows cause. There has never been an observation
on the not sub-atomic level that has been otherwise.

So the ball is still in your court: you must first show that "free
will" exists before you can start saying what its properties are.

We do have choice to a degree - but our choices in any given situation
are mostly limited. So our so-called "free will" is not truly free
(unrestricted) in that respect. Depends on your personality and a lot of

What about the possibility that were merely are our central nervous
system.  Then the central nervous system could have free will insofar
as it does everything it wants.  And what your nervous system wants is
based on physical contraints.  You are talking as if you and your
central nervous system and you were two different things. When you
refer to yourself you are refering to a soul(or soul like entity)
rather than a organism.  Thus your argument is:  Since I am a soul
there must be a soul.  And sure, maybe you are a soul.  But your
argument is not going to convince anyone because its conclusion is
contained in the premise.   Just out of curiosity:  What is your faith?

How about if you free will can only influence [determine] about a

Not necessarily if these neural activities evolved by chance and

- Cogency and competition

An inductive argument thus always runs the risk of failing to preserve
truth, that is, of leading to error. What makes the risk of error
worth taking is the chance of accepting a hypothesis which is true
instead of some competing hypothesis which is false. We may obtain an
improved account of inductive cogency by noting the importance of the
concept of competition among hypotheses as &amp; feature of induction.
Whether it is reasonable to accept a statement as true depends on what
other statements it competes with, as well as on the probability of
the statement on the evidence.

Let us consider an inductive argument that once led philosophers and
scientists to the conclusion that the universe was designed by some
agent. To appreciate the inductive reasoning leading to this
conclusion, recall that before the theory of evolution was conceived,
the existence of human beings constituted a fundamental intellectual
problem. Even if one had theories of matter adequate to account for
many features of the physical universe, the existence of human beings
remained puzzling. The existence of animals presented a striking
contrast to inert matter, but, although some philosophers were willing
to look upon animals as complex physical mechanisms, to draw the same
conclusion concerning human beings was repugnant. Perhaps the
principal reason for this aversion was the existence of conscious
thought and rational cogitation. A philosopher who willingly rejected
the idea that lower animals think and reason could not very well deny
that he himself was thinking and reasoning while engaged in those very
activities. So the existence of humans, thinking and reasoning beings,
constituted a problematic phenomenon indeed. Naturally, the question
arose how to explain it.

We can frame this question by asking what hypothesis it would be
reasonable to accept as true by induction from the evidence. To some
thinkers, there seemed to be only two competing hypotheses. One was
that human beings came to exist as a sheer matter of cosmic chance or
accident. The other was that human beings came to exist as a result of
some design or plan. Hence, as these thinkers considered the matter,
the following two hypotheses were the competitors for acceptance in
this context:

1. Human beings came to exist by chance.

2. Human beings came to exist by design.

Not surprisingly, given that these were the hypotheses from which to
choose, the second rather than the first was considered more probable
on the evidence. It seemed extremely unlikely that anything so
remarkably intricate and complex as a human being should come to exist
by chance. Indeed, the intricate and complex organization of human
beings appeared strikingly analogous to the intricate and complex
characteristics of objects designed by human beings. This argument by
analogy, which we shall consider again later (Chapter Five), was
inductive, of course, but it was also based on a rather limited set of
alternative hypotheses. With competition limited in this way, it is
not at all surprising that some of the most acute and critical
thinkers of the past regarded hypothesis (2) as the one to be
inductively inferred from the evidence.

Now, the astute reader may have noticed that, strictly speaking, a
person who considers hypotheses (1) and (2) should, to be completely
judicious, consider one other hypothesis as well, namely, the
hypothesis that neither (1) nor (2) is correct. Thus, we could also
consider the following negative hypothesis:

3. Human beings came to exist by something other than chance or
design.

The omission of this hypothesis from the competition was justified
because of its uninformative nature. It offers no explanation at all
of the observed phenomena. Though it may well be true, if one is
seeking a hypothesis to explain the existence of man, hypothesis (3)
does not compete for that role.

A much smaller proportion of philosophers and scientists would today
consider cogent the inductive inference of hypothesis (2) from the
evidence. But one reason for this is that today we do not consider
these two hypotheses to be the only competing alternatives. There is
of course the evolutionary hypothesis

4. Human beings came to exist by evolution.

Here it is most important not to confound the informative hypothesis
(4) with the uninformative hypothesis (3). Hypothesis (3) is logically
implied by (4), but the justification of (3) depends entirely on the
cogency of inductive argument in favor of (4). Once the evolutionary
hypothesis was conceived, the competition included not only (1) and
(2) but also (4). Since many scientists and philosophers, perhaps
most, would consider hypothesis (4) to be the most probable of the
competing three, they consider the induction of that hypothesis from
the evidence to be cogent.

It is important to notice the difference between hypothesis (3) and
hypothesis (4). The former is negative and does not explain the
phenomenon in question, the existence of human beings. The latter, by
contrast, offers a very sophisticated and comprehensive theory, the
theory of evolution, as an explanation for that phenomenon. For that
reason, a person who would not consider hypothesis (3) as a competitor

In order for a case to be considered scientific, it has to be confirmed
by peer review, and the evidence on which it is based must be replicable
by all. Thus, the very fact that the case is scientific implies that it
is *not* based on mere subjective experience of individual scientists.

Nothing has always existed. A quantum fluctuation in nothing gave rise to
the big bang and then the space/time continuum. As there is no time in this
primal nothing or emptyness there can be no causality.
Words fail us; maths can help a bit but the equations are symetrical with
respect to time and thus effect can precede cause. Verbal thought cannot
deal with quantum wierdness but the fact is that it works and can be used by
those of us not limited to thinking in words and numbers.

Well, you're mistaken on two counts. First, not all events have known causes.
All *effects* follow causes, of course, but that is merely a tautology, since
we must know an event's cause before we call it an "effect." But any claim
that all events have causes is gratuitous, and indeed false.

Secondly, there is no conflict between causality and free will in the first
place. Free will is simply the thesis that human behavior (and the behavior
of many animals) is not predictable from factors external to the acting
agent. It is usually caused by internal factors, however, e.g., desires,
goals, beliefs, etc. And if it not predictable based on those external
factors, then claiming that it is "caused" by them is also gratuitous.

where does a soul that has existed for all time that begets causes, deny
that effects must have causes except for origins that in ALL explanations

There is a third alternative. I am not compelled to type this neither do I

I do it spontaneously because this is what I'm doing now.
Zen Buddhists call this non-doing, Taoists call it going with the flow.
Tibetan Buddhists call it Pure Buddha Activity.
My refuge name in Tibetan is Karma Namdag which means absolutely pure Buddha
activity.
By destroying such illusions as free will, the existence of an ego or a self
