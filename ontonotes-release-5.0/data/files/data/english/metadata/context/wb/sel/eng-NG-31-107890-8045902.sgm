This might be just a hair OT (forgive me), but I'm curious to know if any of
you have had experience running a jukebox.  Not the technical part, but as a
business model.  Jukeboxes that play 45's (what I prefer) run anywhere from
$1,000 to about $6,500, depending on what you want.  I've had friends tell
me that the quarters add up fast, but I've never heard anything specific.

I've been tinkering with the idea of purchasing one, and placing it in a
50's style restaurant that's owned by my in-laws.  Basically I'd like it to
pay for itself, and ideally it would be nice to use the proceeds to sponsor
a car cruise at that location.

Any thoughts?

Well, I would do the math... lets say 50 cents a song, 3 minutes per song,
that's 20 songs an hour,, that's 10 bucks per hour, lets say 12 hours the
dinner is open..

that's $120 per day MAX.... divided into $6500 that would be 54 days
payback... but that's at max usage... I would guess you could, depending one
the location estimate about 20% usage (real world)... so that would be about
541 days to pay it off....

just a guess...

Many, many years ago I worked for as a &quot;mechanic&quot; for an amusement machine
company (1976). We had to pay about $1500 to place our machines, and the
take on all but the cigarette machines was split 50/50 with the owner of
the establishment where the machine was.

You have to realize, it was not just jukeboxes. A shuffleboard could cost
quite a of dough -- and not make money. Maintainance is also a factor, as
is the idiot who puts a Canadian quarter into a machine, it gets snagged
by the coin rejector magnets and someone is going out to clear it at 2AM.
Don't even get me started on the pinball machines.

Actually that's not a bad place to start.  Then again I'm thinking 25 cents
a song, which cuts it in half (leaving the dynamics out for the moment --
lower price would mean more plays).  There's also a wide range of units --
on one end of the spectrum, there are places that still have the
now-discontinued Wurlitzer 1015 &quot;One More Time&quot; 45 player, brand new and
still in the crate, for $6,500.  At the other end are the used, more boring
70's-style rectangular boxes, that go for around $1,000.  I don't know what
I'd buy until I see it, so for number's sake let's go with $3,000, cutting
it down the middle.  The restaurant is indeed open at least 12 hours, so
we're still in that 541 day ballpark.  So the big unknown variable is -- how
often will it be played?  Probably very little for breakfast, some for
lunch, more at the dinner hour or later.  Does anybody have a &quot;real life&quot;
expected percentage?

Hopefully maintenance would not be a factor, although the cheaper you go the
more likely it may need service -- and associated downtime.  License fees
are minimal, and based on usage.  The biggest deal there is that someone
needs to keep track of the meters.

I suppose there's one more factor -- which helps if things don't work as
well as planned.  There's not much depreciation in these things, and it can
be sold to retrieve your investment.

I don't know - Gary, even Bob's math might be a bit &quot;hypothetical&quot;. It
depends on the crowd at the restaurant, and many other factors. A place I
frequent - has a Juke Box and though it is played, it sure isn't as much as
you and Bob predict - yours might be.

Good luck!

Like the guy that was a Mechanic for them said 50% for the Diner Owner
and 50% to the guy that owned the Juke...

Consider this... your looking at a payback on the cost of the machine..
considering that as you stated.. the machine doesn't depreciate unless
someone kicks the front of it in... so what you really need to think about
is....

If I leave this 6500 bucks in the bank it will pay me $357.50 per year
at 5.5% ... so as long as the machine is still worth the 6500 bucks
and you get clear 400 bucks a year then its a good investment...

Keep in mind that a brand new 6500 machine will depreciate some... where
the nice condition 1K box that works everytime and looks decent will
still be worth 1K if you sell it..

Make it a Quarter Machine... and 5 plays for a Buck...

If you put a jukebox in a commercial establishment you MUST buy a
copyright license from the Jukebox License Office every year. I think
the license fee now is around $600 for a single machine. Some
localities will also require you to buy a &quot;city&quot; license in addition
to the copyright license. The Jukebox copyright license suppossedly
pays off ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC so their cronies will leave you alone.

If your looking for a reliable, rugged, good looking, and sounds great
then look around for a good used Antique Apparatus &quot;Bubbler 45&quot;. It
has all the looks of a Wurlitzer, but the reliability, ruggedness, and
great sound system of a Rowe.

What Mike describes is very similar to what I saw as a manager in the
F&amp;B industry. I was never privy to placement fees but the divvy is on
target. The establishment's cut covers the expense of occupied square
footage as well electricity. The vendor is responsible for
maintenance, insurance etc. Prompt service is most important. When a
machine is down no one is making any money.

Back in the eighties the route man came on Monday, Thursday and Friday
afternoons. Thursday was our busiest night and the take from 2 pinball
machines, 8 video games and a pool table ran between 350 and 450
dollars. The machines grossed about a thousand dollars a week all at a
quarter a pop.

I've been out of the business for 14 years now so I can't speak
knowledgeably about today's marketplace.

I don't know how it would work now, back then a deal would be negotiated
-- in a diner or restaraunt usually a juke and a cigarette machine or two.
Once the deal was cut the payment was made. All amusement companies did
this. I would go to the place once the deal was in place, talk to the owner
and we would figure out if any additional speakers for the juke had to be
installed. Once a week, the coinbox on the juke and games (if any) would
get emptied, counted out in the presence of the establishment owner and
split. Obviously some locations made moremoney than others.

The license is $600?  Is this a one-time fee or what?  I thought the license
was a much smaller fee, based on the records played and paid every month.
Also, the restaurant is already paying a fee for playing background music; I
don't know if this is taken into consideration.  I'll have to ask BMI
directly.

I can't speak for the $600 fee for the Copyright or whatever it was to play
the records, but I do know as someone else stated - some towns/cities have
&quot;Amusement&quot; taxes. Some areas &quot;may&quot; include Jukes, some may not. Here, I
usually collect said taxes or at least issue the stamps for the machines -
once payment is sent in. We do a $25 a year tax on all individual machines.
4 machines, whatever type - they pay $100. &quot;Usually&quot; they're reimbursed (so
I was told) by the Machine owner - but the &quot;Establishment&quot; usually has to
pay it upfront - before they've seen the machine owner. Of course - the tax
in other areas could be significantly lower OR higher.

One place I am familiar with (a club) is charging $1 for 5 songs. &quot;IT&quot; isn't
in the area I cover. The one that is, I don't frequent other than to collect
from, so I have no idea how well it does or how much they charge to play it.
It is in a diner/bar.

Along with all the other posters - DO weigh all options, talk to some
machine vendors, local government officials, etc.... before plopping down
your cash.
On a &quot;different&quot; note but pointing out what happens when you do NOT check
all avenues, we had a man here open a shop up without checking into
regulations. He spent a few thousand, and now - either has to close it up OR
&quot;hope&quot; the Zoning board gives him a Variance. As it was, the building he set
up in, was set to be condemned by the Code Enforcement officer. He &quot;could&quot;
move the shop to his home, next door if need be - IF granted a variance.

ALWAYS check out ALL avenues before chasing a dream - so you can make sure
that dream doesn't turn into a nightmare.

Gary,
For a few years I had pinball machines and video games
out on location to help support my collecting habit.

It was a fun hobby business, and the quarters did add up
fast. At times though, it was a hassle. Vandalism was a
big problem. Maintenance took a lot more time than I
thought it would. The machines I had out (about 10)
were at laundromats a friend owned, so he covered the
insurance. When he sold them, this became an issue.
You *need* liability insurance. You'd be amazed how
unbelievably stupid people are. At one point, I saw small
kids jumping up and down on the topglass of my pins!
Parents were right there and did nothing. Amazing they
didn't get hurt. Of course, I would've gotten sued if they
did. Thats why I stopped doing this as a business.

Jukes can be a maintenance headache. Anything mechanical
is. Keep in mind you'll need to rotate records from time to
time. Victory Glass is a good resource for parts BTW.

I would figure out all the fees first . I believe if the artist is still
alive you have to pay royalty fees on the music . I was told by a guy
who did this if you put the machine in a public place you have to pay
fee stuff . If the machine is placed at private partys , wedings ,
bithdays ect.. you dont have to pay fees .

I would get hold of a mid 80`s jukebox that looks nice and try it first
I have 9 of these newer jukes that play 45`s , some of them have
dollar bill slots .  I have one all done working fine 650$

&gt; The license is $600?  Is this a one-time fee or what?  I thought the license

The jukebox copyright license is a seperate license from your 'live'
music and other music licenses. Here's the link to the jukebox
copyright information:

http://www.jukeboxlicense.com/

It is a yearly fee and yes they do send out 'inspectors' (cronies,
enforcers, etc.) to check on if you have a current license on your
machine. Doesn't matter if you're in the sticks or a big city either.
And it also doesn't matter if the jukebox is on free play or not.
You're still publicly performing copyrighted music.

It doesn't matter if you already pay a license for background music.
The jukebox is licensed seperately. Here in Washington state we have
to also pay sales tax on both the gross revenue and on our cut
('double dip' tax).

People will seldom touch one in a restaurant setting unless you have the
controllers at each booth so that diners can select the songs in
sit-down mode. This is not surprising since the first thing that people
want to do in a sit-down establishment is......sit down. Even so, I
would guess about three years to get payback. Most themed restaurants
probably have them mostly for the cool factor in the first few years of
ownership.

The lone exception is a restaurant (usually pizza) that has a game room.
A box seems to go pretty regularly in those places during
dinnertime, because people are out of their seats to play games anyway.

Don't forget the tax implications. I would think that a $6500 machine
would almost certainly be classified as a business asset that would be
depreciable tax-wise over a period of several years. I'm not an
accountant, but I seem to remember someone telling me that this type of
thing depreciates over a period of something like seven years. $6500 / 7
= $928.57 tax write off for the business per year for seven years
(AGAIN-I AM NOT AN ACCOUNTANT SO YOU WILL NEED TO CHECK WITH ONE TO SEE
IF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE AT ALL!).

If a competent accountant says that such a thing applies to your
business, and the business is long-term (i.e. a going, successful
concern reasonably certain to survive longer than seven years) then this
might take some of the &quot;sting&quot; out of the expense of purchasing one of
these for a business.

&gt;&gt; If you put a jukebox in a commercial establishment you MUST buy a
&gt;&gt; copyright license from the Jukebox License Office every year. I think
&gt;&gt; the license fee now is around $600 for a single machine. Some
&gt;&gt; localities will also require you to buy a &quot;city&quot; license in addition
&gt;&gt; to the copyright license. The Jukebox copyright license suppossedly
&gt;&gt; pays off ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC so their cronies will leave you alone.

$600.00 for a Juke license seems VERY high....If it really is that high,
it's a complete rip-off, no owner of a juke would ever make money on it
if the fees were that high.

BTW the job of enforcing the rules regarding the playing of music in an
establishment falls on the shoulders of young college students doing
low-(or perhaps no) paying intern-type work. I know someone who was
hired for the summer delivering all these letters to businesses who were
playing music (usually freely available over-the-air radio stations or
music CDs, not from a Muzak-type service), demanding payment for &quot;public
performance&quot; of music. The hostility he was met with was incredible-he
quit after a week after one employee at a sandwich shop hurled a giant
boom-box at him and threatened him with death if he ever appeared in the
place again for any reason. (I can't say that I blame the employee-the
whole thing seems like a shake-down to me)

I had a co-worker who had a DJ business on the side. He used to
subscribe to a service that sent him all these special CDs that had all
the current hits on them that were specially licensed for playback in
public for profit. Considering the number of CDs he got every month and
the all-killer-no-filler content on them, the monthly subscription cost
was very reasonable-considerably less than what one would pay for the
same for personal use from ITunes. Not once in his seven years in that
business was he ever audited by anyone to make sure he was playing only
what he was licensed to play. That's what makes me suspect that the
$600.00 fee quoted earlier for a juke license seems more that a little high.

*****SOAPBOX ON*******

IMO, these fees are an excellent example of an industry shooting itself
in the foot. The people who are playing these tunes in public are
exposing potential purchasers to same. In 99% of all businesses that I
have ever frequented, the presence of background music has had NO
bearing whatsoever on my decision to purchase from that vendor. Perhaps
those in the music business had best consider that no one outside of
their industry needs their product to live-what would happen to the
industry if no one decided to play it at all?

&gt; I can't speak for the $600 fee for the Copyright or whatever it was to play

&gt; &quot;Amusement&quot; taxes. Some areas &quot;may&quot; include Jukes, some may not. Here, I
&gt; usually collect said taxes or at least issue the stamps for the machines -
&gt; once payment is sent in. We do a $25 a year tax on all individual machines.
&gt; 4 machines, whatever type - they pay $100. &quot;Usually&quot; they're reimbursed (so
&gt; I was told) by the Machine owner - but the &quot;Establishment&quot; usually has to
&gt; pay it upfront - before they've seen the machine owner. Of course - the tax
&gt; in other areas could be significantly lower OR higher.
">

I would venture to guess that most larger cities have such a levy on
amusement devices. I remember back in the early 1970s a bowling alley in
my neighborhood was gutted and converted into an arcade. It was a huge
operation of its type, with dozens of pinball machines. Behind the
counter where the owners sat and gave change they had the wall papered
with these city-issued certificates, one for each machine in the place.
IIRC, they were $25.00 apiece-not chump change back in those days. Later
on, when video games exploded onto the market, they raised the cost of
each certificate to fifty bucks a pop. Keep in mind that this was over
and above the yearly cost of a business license, and business taxes as well.

There are some localities that are reluctant to even have these things
within their borders at all. Ownership and operation of a lot of these
devices was so married to organized crime in the old days that the taint
still lingers.

Soda machines are a unique case, because new ones are essentially giant,
lit-up banners advertising the product as well as dispensing it. Take a
look at one that's outside at night-you can see the logo from 100 feet
easily in most cases. Add that to the fact that they can exist in venues
where other forms of advertising would be prohibited, and you have
something that is potentially quite lucrative.

How lucrative? Well, Pepsi recently agreed to pay our school system $2.2
million for the exclusive rights to place their branded machines on the
k-12 campuses. Our school district really isn't even that large- I can't
imagine that there would be more than about 100 machines involved. The
deal is controversial because there are many who have questioned the
wisdom of having coin-op things dispensing empty-calorie food items on
campuses, but I think you get the idea....$2.2 million is not chump
change and Pepsi actually competed with Coke to see who could pay the
district the most for those rights. Big business, indeed.

No, this doesn't sound right to me either.  That link went to some &quot;jukebox
license&quot; page, where supposedly you can fill out some form and send them
money to make you &quot;legal&quot;, with the reminder that scouts are watching to
bite your head off if you're non-compliant.  I had trouble navigating the
website (things have been slow the past couple days) and so I never did find
a price or payment schedule, but I suspect the guys who run this website
might be the crooks -- selling you a license for a high price and pocketing
the change.  Why pay a third party when you can deal directly with BMI or
ASCAP?

By the way, since I DJ for various car shows, I investigated the proper
licensing for doing such.  Would you believe there is no such thing as a
Mobile DJ license?  Zip, zero, nada.  I can play all the records I want, or
CD's, or even downloads, for the public and there's no license required.Why?
As it was explained to me, a restaurant or similar business that hosts such
a show has this music incorporated into the license they already have.  If I
were to play at an event such as a wedding, it is considered a private party
and thus does not need a license.

Who gave me this information?  The horse's mouth -- BMI.  I have the letter
here.

You really need to make more of an attempt to read that site, rather than dismiss it
as a group of &quot;crooks&quot;.

Reason for buying through them: http://www.jukeboxlicense.com/history.htm

&quot;In 1989, The United States joined an international copyright treaty named the Berne
Convention. One aspect of the Berne Convention is to offer &quot;negotiated&quot; licenses as
opposed to &quot;compulsory&quot; licenses. Consequently, ASCAP, BMI and SESAC negotiated a
license with the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA), the largest trade
association representing jukebox operators.
The result of these negotiations was the 1990 creation of the Jukebox License Office
(JLO) and the Jukebox License Agreement, which is administered by the JLO. This
agreement provides jukebox operators total access to all songs in the ASCAP, BMI and
SESAC repertories. The Jukebox License Agreement is a single, economical, music
license that provides the authorization required under the U.S. Copyright Law (Title
17) to publicly play virtually every copyrighted song on a coin-operated jukebox. &quot;

Gary,

From the ASCAP website:

&quot; 5. Aren't musicians, entertainers and DJ's responsible for obtaining
permission for music they perform?

Some people mistakenly assume that musicians and entertainers must
obtain licenses to perform copyrighted music or that businesses where
music is performed can shift their responsibility to musicians or
entertainers. The law says all who participate in, or are responsible
for, performances of music are legally responsible. Since it is the
business owner who obtains the ultimate benefit from the performance,
it is the business owner who obtains the license. Music license fees
are one of the many costs of doing business. &quot;

So, you may be off the hook, but the music that you play may be exposing
the sponsor of the event to liability. There are so many different types
of performance licenses (ASCAP alone has over a hundred different
license types) that a it is virtually impossible to say in a blanket
statement that a sponsor's existing license will cover your activities
in every case. I would say that the chances are slim that you would get
busted for spinning a few tunes, but I wouldn't completely discount the
possibility either.

That's somewhat consistent with what BMI told me.

Now that I'm looking for that letter, I can't find it.  In any case, they
simply do not have a license for a mobile DJ.  The music played at a public
event such as this is covered under the license that the host business
already has (assuming it has one -- but that's the business owner's
responsibility).  Now -- I'm sure this isn't written in any policy book, but
I suppose that technically if a special event, with music, is held at some
location (a local show at a private airport comes to mind) where there is
normally no music license required, I suppose the airport or other land
owner might technically be liable.  But, when they have no need or
responsibility to have a music license anyway, and since there is no license
required or offered for the mobile DJ, I seriously doubt that the music
police will be scouting around like Roscoe P. Coltrane, trying to enforce
something that for all practical purposes doesn't exist in the first place.
Of course if the event were held there every day it would be a different
matter, and the host would be responsible for obtaining a license.

ASCAP/BMI are greedy buggers (and yes, my netcast does pay royalties through
our license with Live365).  I've seen some sickening court cases where bar
owners were sued for royalties because they had a RADIO on in the bar. The
station pays royalties based upon cume. That should cover ALL their
listeners, including incidental ones. They're trying to bleed everyone all
the way down the line. What's next? Billing every household based upon the
average number of radios per household? I have no problem with the artist
getting paid for his/her/their work, or even the record companies making a
little profit.. but it seems that anymore they're doing their best to
duplicate the US government tax system (first tax the corporation
(sometimes), then tax the management (sometimes), then tax the workers, then
tax the businesses that the workers patronize.

This all reminds me of my favorite Wizard of Id strip:

that. Then,  you tax the guy that I gave it to. After a few transactions,
you have it all back.

Okay, it's starting to make sense.  It appears the JLO is a legitimate
outfit for licensing (indeed there are rogue outfits who scare you into
purchasing a license or policy through them, when the same policy is
obtainable directly for less).  From the information on the BMI website, it
appears (but is unclear) that the JLO license is only needed if a
coin-operated jukebox is the sole source of music in the establishment.  If
it is free, and/or if there is other music, the jukebox is licensed through
BMI -- and it is assumed the JLO license is not required.  This makes sense,
as a music license is already in place, so why is there a need to pay $400
to shut off the Muzak for two minutes and play a record?

I wrote BMI a note, asking to clarify.

In any case, this is what you'll read on the BMI website:

If you do not charge admission and have a coin-operated jukebox, then you
can call the Jukebox License Office (JLO) to get a license for your
performances. BMI encourages jukebox operators/owners to obtain a Jukebox
License Agreement from the JLO if a jukebox is the only medium by which you
play music. You must ensure that a (JLO) registration certificate is
displayed in the title strip holder of each jukebox that you operate.

As a jukebox music user, you will need a BMI Music Performance Agreement:

a.. if you charge admission;
b.. if your jukebox is activated in any way other than through coin
operation;
c.. if music is played through any medium other than jukebox (e.g., tape,
CD, record player or live performances).
If you would like more information, you may call the JLO at 800-955-5853
with any questions you may have. Or call BMI at 1-877-264-2139.

To me the idea of licensing the radio seems a bit over the edge, except for
the fact that the restaurant/bar is using the music as an
attraction/enhancement to help the business make money.  Yes, the radio
station pays its fees which covers it's privilege to play music to the
listening audience, but if the intended purpose of the radio music is to
help a business make money, then the business would pay for the privilege of
playing music -- regardless of whether they play CD's, Muzak, tapes, or
radio.  It would be similar to the concept of sitting by the radio with a
tape recorder, copying some favorites, and putting them on a CD for sale.

ASCAP/BMI does not have the need to enter your home and ask for a music
license, simply because you pay the license when you purchase the records.
Of course the download hysteria has put a monkey wrench into that because
there are now a bunch of free copies being floated around.  But you must
admit that even that gets a pass, for the most part, because it's so hard to
enforce.  However if you stick thousands of songs on your computer and make
them available for download, look out.

BMI and ASCAP (why we're stuck with two of them is beyond me) are basically
agents which represent the music industry -- or to better phrase it,
individual artists.  The original concept is simple -- if you write a song,
you have a copyright.  I can't perform your song at a concert, charging $50
a ticket, without your permission.  A gentlemen's agreement would be for me
to pay you a good portion of that money, simply because the money was made
in part because you wrote the song.  However if I don't, you would probably
try and hire a lawyer to get some of that money.  Since you could never
possibly monitor every concert hall, radio station, etc., to enforce your
right to collect money whenever your song is being played for profit, you
hire a lawyer, or a big group of lawyers, to do this for you.  This is what
BMI and ASCAP do for you.  Basically by registering with them, you have a
means by which your song is being monitored, with your rights enforced, and
they collect money based on your song's frequency of being used and pay you
for it.

That's the simple part.  The complicated part is the fact that there are so
many mediums by which profits are made with music, that the licenses, with
associated fee collections, have to be set up for each and every way the
music is used.  If your song is used in a TV show, there's a license for it.
If it is sung at a concert, there is a license.  If records are sold,
there's a license.  If a radio station plays it, there's a license, and all
of these licenses are different from each other, in the interest of being as
fair as possible.

There's really no greed factor, other than the right to collect, just as you
have the right to collect money for soda pop if you run a convenience store.
The problem is when the general public hears music everywhere they go,
having little or no knowledge of how it got there in the first place, and
assuming it's free.

They can't pull that crap anymore. read the following, from the ASCAP site:

&quot;How does the &quot;Fairness in Music Licensing Amendment&quot; change the
copyright law?
Up to now, the U.S. Copyright Law required that most businesses using
radio or TV broadcasts as a source of music in a public place obtain
permission to use that music from the owners of the copyright. Of
course, ASCAP collects these fees on behalf of songwriters, composers
and music publishers, and distributes them based on performances. The
new law expands the existing exemption for only this type of music use
for certain kinds of businesses.

What exactly does the new law exempt from licensing fees?
Businesses that perform music only from licensed radio, television,
cable and satellite sources, that do not re-transmit beyond their
establishments, and do not charge admission, are exempted as follows:

* All restaurants, bars and grills that are smaller than 3,750
gross square feet, and all other retail establishments that are smaller
than 2,000 gross square feet, are exempt from paying license fees to
songwriters, composers and music publishers, but only for their use of
radio and TV music.

* Businesses whose square footage exceeds the amounts listed also
qualify for the exemption if they use six or fewer speakers with no more
than four speakers in any one room or use audiovisual equipment
consisting of no more than four TV's, with no more than one TV in each
room, and no TV having a diagonal screen size greater than 55 inches,
together with the same speaker restrictions.&quot;

Those exemptions are pretty broad....It's clear that the restaurant and
retail lobbies had some influence in getting this exemption passed. The
scenario I mentioned in an earlier posting-My music-industry intern
friend having a boom box thrown at him for delivering copyright dunning
letters to businesses-would not happen for a radio playing in a retail
business today unless the establishment was huge.

They're trying to bleed everyone all

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; the way down the line. What's next? Billing every household based upon the
&gt; average number of radios per household?

Don't think they haven't thought of it. Years ago, some member of
congress tried to insert a provision in an innocuous funding bill that
would have raised the prices of blank tapes to match the retail cost of
commercially produced music tapes. The ruse was soon discovered and the
privision was removed.

Shortly thereafter, an underground poster surfaced that was rumored to
have been produced by one or more of the companies that manufactured
blank tape. It showed a stuffed-shirt man in a suit and tie being hung
by a noose made out of blank recording tape. The caption read &quot;Home
taping is killing the record companies.......and it's about f*****g

The real problem as I see it is that the industry grossly overvalues
their product. They spend huge sums on lawyers and PR guys trying to
convince the public that every flash-in-the-pan song by an artist that
was famous for exactly fifteen minutes is worth millions and millions of
dollars forever. 'Taint so. Frankly, the notion of the worst disco hit
ever recorded fetching the same amount for a public performance as the
best Beatles song is pretty absurd.

Actually this has been proposed over and over again, and if I'm not
mistaken, something like this has indeed been passed in Canada.  Of course,
Canada and many European countries require you to purchase an annual license
to watch TV or listen to the radio, which is rather absurd -- I don't think
the artists get a penny of this, it goes to the government -- as if they did
anything for the music industry.

Paying royalties for blank tape is totally absurd, for a host of reasons.
First off, you're forced to pay a royalty for a medium only, containing no
copyrighted material -- it's like taxing a pencil and paper.  Second, if
you're using the tape to make a recording of your OWN music, you're
essentially forced to pay your competitor -- and he does not have to pay
YOU.  Third, there is no provision whatsoever for determining which artists
benefit most from a sale of blank tape.  Unlike a jukebox, radio station, or
record store who divides royalties based on the popularity of the various
recordings, proceeds from tapes are divided according to percenatges based
on the others.  In other words, if you buy a tape to record an obscure copy
of Dicky Doo &amp; The Don'ts, the royalties will be divided up based on overall
record sales.  I suppose the biggest beneficiary would be whoever holds the
rights to Bing Crosby material, as Der Bingle is still the all-time champion
of the most records ever sold.  Last but not least, this royalty still does
not provide a license to copy and sell this material -- so what good is it?
It is essentially a tax on nothing.

Actually I think the real problem is even more subtle than that.  I think
the industry has found itself in a strange situation where new music has
DROPPED in value, and the record producers are trying to cover up the
problem by blaming it on the misuse of new technology, when in fact the
material itself is far less appealing.  If record sales are down because of
download piracy, can you explain why concert attendance is also way down?
Can you explain why the top-40 radio format now lags behind oldies, talk
radio, and even country?  Fact is, most of you reading this cannot name
three current bands; there are no Beatles, Elvis, or Petula Clark
replacements to inspire sales.  So it seems as though the licensing guys are
trying to keep collecting royalties by getting &quot;blood from a turnip&quot;,
raising the stakes for recordings that nobody wants.

Minor correction on the above, Gary....
You are no longer required to purchase an annual license to watch TV or
listen
to the radio in Canada, although at one time (in the forties and earlier, I
think) that
was true.
And yes, the music industry did manage to get a surcharge on blank media
such as
cassette tapes in Canada... but it was only a few cents IIRC.  The music
industry
has managed to get their hands on a lot of other money in this country as
well,
that for many people probably justifies all the ripping and burning they can
do.
Cheers,
Nelson

&gt; &gt; They can't pull that crap anymore. read the following, from the ASCAP
&gt; &gt; site:

&gt; &gt;     * All restaurants, bars and grills that are smaller than 3,750 gross
&gt; &gt; square feet, and all other retail establishments that are smaller than
&gt; &gt; 2,000 gross square feet, are exempt from paying license fees to

&gt; Thank you for sharing that.

&gt; &gt; Don't think they haven't thought of it. Years ago, some member of congress
&gt; &gt; tried to insert a provision in an innocuous funding bill that would have
&gt; &gt; raised the prices of blank tapes to match the retail cost of commercially
&gt; &gt; produced music tapes. The ruse was soon discovered and the privision was
&gt; &gt; removed.

&gt; Actually this has been proposed over and over again, and if I'm not
&gt; mistaken, something like this has indeed been passed in Canada.  Of course,
&gt; Canada and many European countries require you to purchase an annual license
&gt; to watch TV or listen to the radio, which is rather absurd -- I don't think
&gt; the artists get a penny of this, it goes to the government -- as if they did
&gt; anything for the music industry.

&gt; Paying royalties for blank tape is totally absurd, for a host of reasons.
&gt; First off, you're forced to pay a royalty for a medium only, containing no
&gt; copyrighted material -- it's like taxing a pencil and paper.  Second, if
&gt; you're using the tape to make a recording of your OWN music, you're
&gt; essentially forced to pay your competitor -- and he does not have to pay
&gt; YOU.  Third, there is no provision whatsoever for determining which artists
&gt; benefit most from a sale of blank tape.  Unlike a jukebox, radio station, or
&gt; record store who divides royalties based on the popularity of the various
&gt; recordings, proceeds from tapes are divided according to percenatges based
&gt; on the others.  In other words, if you buy a tape to record an obscure copy
&gt; of Dicky Doo &amp; The Don'ts, the royalties will be divided up based on overall
&gt; record sales.  I suppose the biggest beneficiary would be whoever holds the
&gt; rights to Bing Crosby material, as Der Bingle is still the all-time champion
&gt; of the most records ever sold.  Last but not least, this royalty still does
&gt; not provide a license to copy and sell this material -- so what good is it?
&gt; It is essentially a tax on nothing.

&gt; &gt; The real problem as I see it is that the industry grossly overvalues their
&gt; &gt; product. They spend huge sums on lawyers and PR guys trying to convince
&gt; &gt; the public that every flash-in-the-pan song by an artist that was famous
&gt; &gt; for exactly fifteen minutes is worth millions and millions of

&gt; Actually I think the real problem is even more subtle than that.  I think
&gt; the industry has found itself in a strange situation where new music has
&gt; DROPPED in value, and the record producers are trying to cover up the
&gt; problem by blaming it on the misuse of new technology, when in fact the
&gt; material itself is far less appealing.  If record sales are down because of
&gt; download piracy, can you explain why concert attendance is also way down?
&gt; Can you explain why the top-40 radio format now lags behind oldies, talk
&gt; radio, and even country?  Fact is, most of you reading this cannot name
&gt; three current bands; there are no Beatles, Elvis, or Petula Clark
&gt; replacements to inspire sales.  So it seems as though the licensing guys are
&gt; trying to keep collecting royalties by getting &quot;blood from a turnip&quot;,
&gt; raising the stakes for recordings that nobody wants.

No one uses blank tapes any more, they use CD-Rs. In Canada, consumers
are getting ripped off by the music industry to the tune of 21 cents per
CD (i.e. a 100-pack of CDs costs a minimum of $21.00 even if they are
given away free).

Around here, I can get blank CDs from several retailers for as little as
8 cents apiece. If I lived in Canada, the cost would essentially
quadruple, with 3/4 of it going to the music industry.....That is
completely insane. If I were subject to such a levy, I would make it a
point to download music and burn it to CDs all day, every day, even
stuff I would never actually listen to....If the music industry gets
revenue from the notion that I might be a crook, I might as well be one.

Fortunately for the music industry, I live in the USA where no such levy
is in effect, and the vast majority of new music isn't worth copying
illegally.

Scott,

There are discs still for sale in the US that have a heavy 'copyright tax'
on them. They are the specifically manufactured &quot;audio discs&quot; which cost
some humongous amount more than standard blank CD-ROM discs, and supposedly
are the only discs that can be used in home audio CD players (I think the
manufacturers of such players quietly moved away from machines that could
only used preformatted discs, since everyone was using computers to burn
them anyway).

Are you the one that has the excess of 160V electrolytics?

I'm aware of a tax on car radios at least into the early '60's in Canada.
I've owned more than one car radio with a Canadian tax stamp on it.

I use any blank tape I can find. I'm still finding chrome even.
