The movie Titanic is a story of star-crossed lovers as seen in Romeo
and Juliet

The movie JFK has as its theme the tragedy of assasination and the
disruption of legitimacy by powerful and ambitious men who believe
themselves above corruption, but are willing to corrupt institutions
(Rome in Shakespeare, American democracy in JFK) because like Brutus,
they believe they know best what's good for a Republic

In Citizen Kane, Kane, like Lear, throws his life away because of self-
will. Lear does so to get "love" from his daughters: Kane does so to
show that Charlie Gettys, his enemy, is a dishonorable criminal. Lear
learns through suffering but Kane does not except, perhaps, at the end

Tolstoy's War and Peace has elements of the late romances (Winter's
Tale, Cymbeline and Pericles) in that characters learn wisdom by being
overmastered by time and space and chance events

His Anna Karenina bears comparision to Cleopatra, as does Gustav
Flaubert's Madame Bovary in that all three heroines are self-willed
like Lear. Neither Karenina nor Bovary learn wisdom except implicitly.
Bovary is mourned by her husband as we the audience mourn Cleopatra.

Oliver Stone's film Nixon shows the downfall of the great in the
manner of high tragedy and Othello. In both, a man is led to his doom
by false beliefs: Othello by his belief that Desdemona was unfaithful,
Nixon by his belief that the President is above the Constitution.
However, Nixon was unlike Othello a flawed man even before he became
President.

You are going to have to do your own homework. These are just
pointers.

Sorry. I do not accept your praise, Mr. Houlsby, and I shall now self-
rate my own post to cancel your five stars.

This is because BEFORE you praise anything I contribute, I must have
from you:

(1) An apology for the posts directed at me describing my
contributions, as a serious enquirer and contributor on the subject of
Shakespeare who teaches Shakespeare, as a "troll"

(2) An apology from you to all the people in this newsgroup whom you
have harmed by exposing them to mental pain and suffering and
potential corporate and government surveillance, by calling them
"trolls", a Fascistic adjective that describes people attempting to
participate in THE HUMAN COMMUNITY as not worthy of fair and equal
treatment.

I'm quite serious. I require you to examine all your posts whilst
making a list of each and every person you have insulted. Then, you
must post an apology to the community that lists the people you have
harmed and describes the harm done to each person.

Then, the community will monitor your conduct and report violations
which I in turn will monitor.

During this period you may post anything you like except insult syntax
of the form "you are an x", where x is ANYTHING OTHER than a
synonymous phrase to "full member of the human community fully
entitled to respect and recognition except as shall be determined by
the due process of the laws of his nation".

When I judge that period to be ended, you may then praise me.

I cannot change my own rating, it appears, to a zero or anything else.
Therefore, be it known that I reject this rating from Mr. Houlsby as
coming from a person who would deny people in the HLAS community their
human right as speakers by unilaterally calling them "trolls", a
Fascist technique.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; literature and modern culture, including films and music. choose 3
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; literary works, 1 must be a novel or short story, the other 2 must be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; poetry or film. write a lengthy paper supporting and illustrating the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hypothesis of the continuing influence of shakespeare's themes on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other forms of literature.    your goal is to prove that the stories/
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plots/major themes keep reoccuring, even though the character's names
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may change. your parameters are find at least 3 sources to reinforce
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your opinion and you must include validation of your argumentin the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; form of quotesbut they must be properly cited.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The movie Titanic is a story of star-crossed lovers as seen in Romeo
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Juliet

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The movie JFK has as its theme the tragedy of assasination and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disruption of legitimacy by powerful and ambitious men who believe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves above corruption, but are willing to corrupt institutions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Rome in Shakespeare, American democracy in JFK) because like Brutus,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they believe they know best what's good for a Republic

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Citizen Kane, Kane, like Lear, throws his life away because of self-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will. Lear does so to get &quot;love&quot; from his daughters: Kane does so to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; show that Charlie Gettys, his enemy, is a dishonorable criminal. Lear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learns through suffering but Kane does not except, perhaps, at the end

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tolstoy's War and Peace has elements of the late romances (Winter's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tale, Cymbeline and Pericles) in that characters learn wisdom by being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overmastered by time and space and chance events

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His Anna Karenina bears comparision to Cleopatra, as does Gustav
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Flaubert's Madame Bovary in that all three heroines are self-willed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like Lear. Neither Karenina nor Bovary learn wisdom except implicitly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bovary is mourned by her husband as we the audience mourn Cleopatra.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oliver Stone's film Nixon shows the downfall of the great in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manner of high tragedy and Othello. In both, a man is led to his doom
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by false beliefs: Othello by his belief that Desdemona was unfaithful,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nixon by his belief that the President is above the Constitution.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, Nixon was unlike Othello a flawed man even before he became
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; President.

In the Usenet world have you heard the word flame or flamer? This
little article is for education and not to scare you because Usenet
has unlimited advantages with some trash that comes with. Ever been to
a message board and made a post about a controversial topic only to
have someone slam you in their reply? That my friend is a FLAMER. Some
can be polite and some can be downright nasty with nothing on their
mind then just tick you off. The fun part is that flamers is an issue
that won't go away any time soon so we just deal with these people the
best way that we can. If you happen to post something controversial
then your chances of getting flamed increases. You'll get flamers from
all over the world who try to prove you wrong, or steer you in their
direction. My advice is NEVER give in and stay the course. Flamers
come in all shapes and sizes but they all have one motive, to ruin
your day. Again don't let them. Some flamers are known to ignore
warnings, and break forum rules. They do things like having backup
usernames, emails, and IP addresses so that they can get back into
newsgroups that they have been banned from. Just a reminder that this
is to educate you about flamers incase you run into these folks. You
handle these people and you have unlimited possibilities you can have

Newsgroup Flamers

What are newsgroup flamers?

Usenet flamers are basically people who subscribe to a Usenet
newsgroup with the aim of posting provocative and slanderous articles,
often referred to as "flamebait", that will elicit angry responses
from other Usenet users. This sort of behavior often results in a full
blown argument, called a "flame war". A flame war is what a newsgroup
flamer wants.

Usenet flamers are usually called trolls. A troll's disruptive
behavior is often called "trolling". The term first appeared on
Usenet, but has been used in IRC chat rooms and on Internet discussion
boards and email lists.

Usenet flamers or trolls often try to play the role of Devil's
Advocate in Usenet discussion groups, especially discussion groups
dedicated to the discussion of religion, philosophy and politics. Of
course, a sincere provocateur will introduce him or her self, but
Usenet flamers tend to hide behind the mask of anonymity.

How to recognize Usenet flamers

A Usenet flamer is easy to spot. A Usenet flamer:
1. Shows no understanding of Usenet etiquette or Netiquette
2. Posts long "off topic" articles
3. Complains that newsgroup discussion is "off topic" and rudely
demands that everything stay "on topic".
4. Denounces the beliefs of other newsgroup subscribers.
5. Makes provocative statements that never get to the source of a
discussion but are purely aimed at raising havoc.
6. Attacks other newsgroup subscribers.

How to deal with Usenet flamers

The behavior of a Usenet flamer or troll is problematic, because most
newsgroup subscribers just want to participate in good discussion and
file-sharing and flamers are simply disruptive. Always think before
you respond to any provocative comment or file by a person you don't
know in your discussion group. The best advice is to simply ignore
Usenet flamers. If you have any real concerns about the activity of a
Usenet flamer, you may also contact your Usenet Service Provider's
support team.

I'm afraid that the very name "flamer" was invented by uncultured
system administrators who care more about machinery than people, and
for this reason the very word implies a mutuality and symmettry which
does not exist in most cases. "Flamer" creates a mental picture of two
people of equal status with equal responsibility for the "real"
crime...which is the "crime" of filling up servers which in the 1980s,
when the term originated, were of low capacity.

The word needs to be retired and replaced by "online electronic
bullying" because that is what it is.

It is a male attempt by bullying to re-assert a control over
conversations by white males and their fellow-travelers and suck ups,
because technical people of low culture and with few social skills are
threatened by the way in which electronic communication empowers non-
metropolitan voices to be heard.

I reject the FAQ definition of "flaming".

That would intellectualise and make "rational" his conduct. I prefer
an explanation which takes into account his emotions.

He's realized I am a serious poster with something to contribute who
won't take any shit from a punk like him, and as a psychotic he has
(absent the ability to control his anger at moments of stress to be
sure) the ability most of the time to change, and to psychotically
flatter men he thinks more powerful than him, associating himself
(while being in fact completely ignorant of the newsgroup topic) with
the thought leaders of the group.

He seeks their alliance in a coalition of people he regards as having
a power he does not feel as an individual who will then turn upon any
subalterned voices and enforce the standards of an ISOLATED community,
isolated that is from the larger world in which he feels threatened:

He liked the post so much because he thought he understood it. It
didn't challenge him, instead it mentioned movies he's seen and books
he's examined at Borders.

Whereas any truly original statements which, God forbid, advance this

&gt; Newsgroup Flamers

&gt; What are newsgroup flamers?

&gt; Usenet flamers are basically people who subscribe to a Usenet
&gt; newsgroup with the aim of posting provocative and slanderous articles,
&gt; often referred to as &quot;flamebait&quot;, that will elicit angry responses
&gt; from other Usenet users. This sort of behavior often results in a full
&gt; blown argument, called a &quot;flame war&quot;. A flame war is what a newsgroup
&gt; flamer wants.

&gt; Usenet flamers are usually called trolls. A troll's disruptive
&gt; behavior is often called &quot;trolling&quot;. The term first appeared on
&gt; Usenet, but has been used in IRC chat rooms and on Internet discussion
&gt; boards and email lists.

&gt; Usenet flamers or trolls often try to play the role of Devil's
&gt; Advocate in Usenet discussion groups, especially discussion groups
&gt; dedicated to the discussion of religion, philosophy and politics. Of
&gt; course, a sincere provocateur will introduce him or her self, but
&gt; Usenet flamers tend to hide behind the mask of anonymity.

&gt; How to recognize Usenet flamers

&gt; A Usenet flamer is easy to spot. A Usenet flamer:
&gt; 1. Shows no understanding of Usenet etiquette or Netiquette
&gt; 2. Posts long &quot;off topic&quot; articles
&gt; 3. Complains that newsgroup discussion is &quot;off topic&quot; and rudely
&gt; demands that everything stay &quot;on topic&quot;.
&gt; 4. Denounces the beliefs of other newsgroup subscribers.
&gt; 5. Makes provocative statements that never get to the source of a
&gt; discussion but are purely aimed at raising havoc.
&gt; 6. Attacks other newsgroup subscribers.

&gt; How to deal with Usenet flamers

&gt; The behavior of a Usenet flamer or troll is problematic, because most
&gt; newsgroup subscribers just want to participate in good discussion and
&gt; file-sharing and flamers are simply disruptive. Always think before
&gt; you respond to any provocative comment or file by a person you don't
&gt; know in your discussion group. The best advice is to simply ignore
&gt; Usenet flamers. If you have any real concerns about the activity of a
&gt; Usenet flamer, you may also contact your Usenet Service Provider's
&gt; support team.

&gt; I'm afraid that the very name &quot;flamer&quot; was invented by uncultured
&gt; system administrators who care more about machinery than people, and
&gt; for this reason the very word implies a mutuality and symmettry which
&gt; does not exist in most cases. &quot;Flamer&quot; creates a mental picture of two
&gt; people of equal status with equal responsibility for the &quot;real&quot;
&gt; crime...which is the &quot;crime&quot; of filling up servers which in the 1980s,
&gt; when the term originated, were of low capacity.

&gt; The word needs to be retired and replaced by &quot;online electronic
&gt; bullying&quot; because that is what it is.

&gt; It is a male attempt by bullying to re-assert a control over
&gt; conversations by white males and their fellow-travelers and suck ups,
&gt; because technical people of low culture and with few social skills are
&gt; threatened by the way in which electronic communication empowers non-
&gt; metropolitan voices to be heard.

&gt; I reject the FAQ definition of &quot;flaming&quot;.

This is nothing more than the homophobia which is a strong indicator

Actually, several of my friends are gay, but I'm not.

I didn't mean "couple" in the romantic sense, BTW, you're projecting

You're consistent in being wrong, at least.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Nice to see that you identify with Nilges.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Funny how trolls support each other.-

&gt; &gt; In the Usenet world have you heard the word flame or flamer?

&gt; Yes.

&gt; &gt; This
&gt; &gt; little article is for education and not to scare you because Usenet
&gt; &gt; has unlimited advantages with some trash that comes with. Ever been to
&gt; &gt; a message board and made a post about a controversial topic only to
&gt; &gt; have someone slam you in their reply? That my friend is a FLAMER. Some
&gt; &gt; can be polite and some can be downright nasty with nothing on their
&gt; &gt; mind then just tick you off. The fun part is that flamers is an issue
&gt; &gt; that won't go away any time soon so we just deal with these people the
&gt; &gt; best way that we can. If you happen to post something controversial
&gt; &gt; then your chances of getting flamed increases. You'll get flamers from
&gt; &gt; all over the world who try to prove you wrong, or steer you in their
&gt; &gt; direction. My advice is NEVER give in and stay the course. Flamers
&gt; &gt; come in all shapes and sizes but they all have one motive, to ruin
&gt; &gt; your day. Again don't let them. Some flamers are known to ignore
&gt; &gt; warnings, and break forum rules. They do things like having backup
&gt; &gt; usernames, emails, and IP addresses so that they can get back into
&gt; &gt; newsgroups that they have been banned from. Just a reminder that this
&gt; &gt; is to educate you about flamers incase you run into these folks. You
&gt; &gt; handle these people and you have unlimited possibilities you can have
&gt; &gt; Usenet.com.

&gt; &gt; Newsgroup Flamers

&gt; &gt; What are newsgroup flamers?

&gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are basically people who subscribe to a Usenet
&gt; &gt; newsgroup with the aim of posting provocative and slanderous articles,
&gt; &gt; often referred to as &quot;flamebait&quot;, that will elicit angry responses
&gt; &gt; from other Usenet users. This sort of behavior often results in a full
&gt; &gt; blown argument, called a &quot;flame war&quot;. A flame war is what a newsgroup
&gt; &gt; flamer wants.

&gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are usually called trolls. A troll's disruptive
&gt; &gt; behavior is often called &quot;trolling&quot;. The term first appeared on
&gt; &gt; Usenet, but has been used in IRC chat rooms and on Internet discussion
&gt; &gt; boards and email lists.

&gt; &gt; Usenet flamers or trolls often try to play the role of Devil's
&gt; &gt; Advocate in Usenet discussion groups, especially discussion groups
&gt; &gt; dedicated to the discussion of religion, philosophy and politics. Of
&gt; &gt; course, a sincere provocateur will introduce him or her self, but
&gt; &gt; Usenet flamers tend to hide behind the mask of anonymity.

&gt; &gt; How to recognize Usenet flamers

&gt; &gt; A Usenet flamer is easy to spot. A Usenet flamer:
&gt; &gt; 1. Shows no understanding of Usenet etiquette or Netiquette
&gt; &gt; 2. Posts long &quot;off topic&quot; articles
&gt; &gt; 3. Complains that newsgroup discussion is &quot;off topic&quot; and rudely
&gt; &gt; demands that everything stay &quot;on topic&quot;.
&gt; &gt; 4. Denounces the beliefs of other newsgroup subscribers.
&gt; &gt; 5. Makes provocative statements that never get to the source of a
&gt; &gt; discussion but are purely aimed at raising havoc.
&gt; &gt; 6. Attacks other newsgroup subscribers.

&gt; &gt; How to deal with Usenet flamers

&gt; &gt; The behavior of a Usenet flamer or troll is problematic, because most
&gt; &gt; newsgroup subscribers just want to participate in good discussion and
&gt; &gt; file-sharing and flamers are simply disruptive. Always think before
&gt; &gt; you respond to any provocative comment or file by a person you don't
&gt; &gt; know in your discussion group. The best advice is to simply ignore
&gt; &gt; Usenet flamers. If you have any real concerns about the activity of a
&gt; &gt; Usenet flamer, you may also contact your Usenet Service Provider's
&gt; &gt; support team.

Sure you did. Psychotic bullies, such as the President of the United
States, the Vice President of the United States, and you, know
everything they need to know because they've learned, typically from a
physically, sexually or both physically and sexually abusive father,
never to be weak, never to admit weakness, because if you do you end
up on the floor of the kitchen weeping and bleeding like an animal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plots/major themes keep reoccuring, even though the character's names
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may change. your parameters are find at least 3 sources to reinforce

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; form of quotesbut they must be properly cited.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The movie Titanic is a story of star-crossed lovers as seen in Romeo
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Juliet

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The movie JFK has as its theme the tragedy of assasination and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disruption of legitimacy by powerful and ambitious men who believe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves above corruption, but are willing to corrupt institutions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Rome in Shakespeare, American democracy in JFK) because like Brutus,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they believe they know best what's good for a Republic

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Citizen Kane, Kane, like Lear, throws his life away because of self-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will. Lear does so to get &quot;love&quot; from his daughters: Kane does so to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; show that Charlie Gettys, his enemy, is a dishonorable criminal. Lear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learns through suffering but Kane does not except, perhaps, at the end

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tolstoy's War and Peace has elements of the late romances (Winter's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tale, Cymbeline and Pericles) in that characters learn wisdom by being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overmastered by time and space and chance events

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His Anna Karenina bears comparision to Cleopatra, as does Gustav
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Flaubert's Madame Bovary in that all three heroines are self-willed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like Lear. Neither Karenina nor Bovary learn wisdom except implicitly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bovary is mourned by her husband as we the audience mourn Cleopatra.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oliver Stone's film Nixon shows the downfall of the great in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manner of high tragedy and Othello. In both, a man is led to his doom
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by false beliefs: Othello by his belief that Desdemona was unfaithful,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nixon by his belief that the President is above the Constitution.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, Nixon was unlike Othello a flawed man even before he became
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; President.

&gt; &gt; This is because BEFORE you praise anything I contribute, I must have

&gt; &gt; (1) An apology for the posts directed at me describing my

&gt; &gt; Shakespeare who teaches Shakespeare, as a &quot;troll&quot;

&gt; &gt; (2) An apology from you to all the people in this newsgroup whom you
&gt; &gt; have harmed by exposing them to mental pain and suffering and
&gt; &gt; potential corporate and government surveillance, by calling them
&gt; &gt; &quot;trolls&quot;, a Fascistic adjective that describes people attempting to
&gt; &gt; participate in THE HUMAN COMMUNITY as not worthy of fair and equal

&gt; &gt; I'm quite serious. I require you to examine all your posts whilst
&gt; &gt; making a list of each and every person you have insulted. Then, you
&gt; &gt; must post an apology to the community that lists the people you have
&gt; &gt; harmed and describes the harm done to each person.

&gt; &gt; Then, the community will monitor your conduct and report violations
&gt; &gt; which I in turn will monitor.

&gt; &gt; During this period you may post anything you like except insult syntax

&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Posts long &quot;off topic&quot; articles
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Complains that newsgroup discussion is &quot;off topic&quot; and rudely
&gt; &gt; &gt; demands that everything stay &quot;on topic&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Denounces the beliefs of other newsgroup subscribers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Makes provocative statements that never get to the source of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; discussion but are purely aimed at raising havoc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Attacks other newsgroup subscribers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; How to deal with Usenet flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; The behavior of a Usenet flamer or troll is problematic, because most
&gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroup subscribers just want to participate in good discussion and
&gt; &gt; &gt; file-sharing and flamers are simply disruptive. Always think before
&gt; &gt; &gt; you respond to any provocative comment or file by a person you don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; know in your discussion group. The best advice is to simply ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers. If you have any real concerns about the activity of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamer, you may also contact your Usenet Service Provider's
&gt; &gt; &gt; support team.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The movie Titanic is a story of star-crossed lovers as seen in Romeo
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Juliet

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The movie JFK has as its theme the tragedy of assasination and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disruption of legitimacy by powerful and ambitious men who believe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves above corruption, but are willing to corrupt institutions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Rome in Shakespeare, American democracy in JFK) because like Brutus,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they believe they know best what's good for a Republic

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Citizen Kane, Kane, like Lear, throws his life away because of self-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will. Lear does so to get &quot;love&quot; from his daughters: Kane does so to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; show that Charlie Gettys, his enemy, is a dishonorable criminal. Lear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learns through suffering but Kane does not except, perhaps, at the end

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tolstoy's War and Peace has elements of the late romances (Winter's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tale, Cymbeline and Pericles) in that characters learn wisdom by being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overmastered by time and space and chance events

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His Anna Karenina bears comparision to Cleopatra, as does Gustav
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Flaubert's Madame Bovary in that all three heroines are self-willed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like Lear. Neither Karenina nor Bovary learn wisdom except implicitly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bovary is mourned by her husband as we the audience mourn Cleopatra.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oliver Stone's film Nixon shows the downfall of the great in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manner of high tragedy and Othello. In both, a man is led to his doom
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by false beliefs: Othello by his belief that Desdemona was unfaithful,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nixon by his belief that the President is above the Constitution.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, Nixon was unlike Othello a flawed man even before he became

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; despised ignoramus, nugatory.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice to see that you identify with Nilges.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Funny how trolls support each other.-

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the Usenet world have you heard the word flame or flamer?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little article is for education and not to scare you because Usenet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has unlimited advantages with some trash that comes with. Ever been to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a message board and made a post about a controversial topic only to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have someone slam you in their reply? That my friend is a FLAMER. Some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can be polite and some can be downright nasty with nothing on their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind then just tick you off. The fun part is that flamers is an issue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that won't go away any time soon so we just deal with these people the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best way that we can. If you happen to post something controversial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then your chances of getting flamed increases. You'll get flamers from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all over the world who try to prove you wrong, or steer you in their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; direction. My advice is NEVER give in and stay the course. Flamers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come in all shapes and sizes but they all have one motive, to ruin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your day. Again don't let them. Some flamers are known to ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warnings, and break forum rules. They do things like having backup
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usernames, emails, and IP addresses so that they can get back into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroups that they have been banned from. Just a reminder that this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to educate you about flamers incase you run into these folks. You
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; handle these people and you have unlimited possibilities you can have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet.com.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Newsgroup Flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What are newsgroup flamers?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are basically people who subscribe to a Usenet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroup with the aim of posting provocative and slanderous articles,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; often referred to as &quot;flamebait&quot;, that will elicit angry responses
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from other Usenet users. This sort of behavior often results in a full
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blown argument, called a &quot;flame war&quot;. A flame war is what a newsgroup
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flamer wants.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are usually called trolls. A troll's disruptive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behavior is often called &quot;trolling&quot;. The term first appeared on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet, but has been used in IRC chat rooms and on Internet discussion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boards and email lists.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers or trolls often try to play the role of Devil's

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The behavior of a Usenet flamer or troll is problematic, because most

Oh, and you are proud of being a psychotic bully...

You elected Bush for two reasons. You didn't vote, and your type
usually chills in Florida to escape bills, notices, demands for
payment of back child support, warrants, writs, restraining orders and
prison, so your not voting caused the election of Bush in 2000.

And he most perfectly "represents" you, for he is stupid, incurious
and a complete bully who likes to harm people.

But you weren't smart enough to pick a rich wealthy father.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice to see that you identify with Nilges.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Funny how trolls support each other.-

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the Usenet world have you heard the word flame or flamer?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little article is for education and not to scare you because Usenet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has unlimited advantages with some trash that comes with. Ever been to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a message board and made a post about a controversial topic only to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have someone slam you in their reply? That my friend is a FLAMER. Some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can be polite and some can be downright nasty with nothing on their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind then just tick you off. The fun part is that flamers is an issue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that won't go away any time soon so we just deal with these people the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best way that we can. If you happen to post something controversial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then your chances of getting flamed increases. You'll get flamers from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all over the world who try to prove you wrong, or steer you in their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; direction. My advice is NEVER give in and stay the course. Flamers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come in all shapes and sizes but they all have one motive, to ruin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your day. Again don't let them. Some flamers are known to ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warnings, and break forum rules. They do things like having backup
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usernames, emails, and IP addresses so that they can get back into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroups that they have been banned from. Just a reminder that this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to educate you about flamers incase you run into these folks. You
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; handle these people and you have unlimited possibilities you can have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet.com.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Newsgroup Flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What are newsgroup flamers?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are basically people who subscribe to a Usenet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroup with the aim of posting provocative and slanderous articles,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; often referred to as &quot;flamebait&quot;, that will elicit angry responses
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from other Usenet users. This sort of behavior often results in a full
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blown argument, called a &quot;flame war&quot;. A flame war is what a newsgroup
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flamer wants.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are usually called trolls. A troll's disruptive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behavior is often called &quot;trolling&quot;. The term first appeared on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet, but has been used in IRC chat rooms and on Internet discussion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boards and email lists.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers or trolls often try to play the role of Devil's

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; system of punishment and reward. Too bad B.F. Trollsby's system of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; punishment is the equivalent of bashing people over the head with a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; padded feather duster and his rewards, given that he is a much
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; despised ignoramus, nugatory.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice to see that you identify with Nilges.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Funny how trolls support each other.-

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the Usenet world have you heard the word flame or flamer?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little article is for education and not to scare you because Usenet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has unlimited advantages with some trash that comes with. Ever been to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a message board and made a post about a controversial topic only to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have someone slam you in their reply? That my friend is a FLAMER. Some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can be polite and some can be downright nasty with nothing on their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind then just tick you off. The fun part is that flamers is an issue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that won't go away any time soon so we just deal with these people the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best way that we can. If you happen to post something controversial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then your chances of getting flamed increases. You'll get flamers from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all over the world who try to prove you wrong, or steer you in their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; direction. My advice is NEVER give in and stay the course. Flamers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come in all shapes and sizes but they all have one motive, to ruin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your day. Again don't let them. Some flamers are known to ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warnings, and break forum rules. They do things like having backup
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usernames, emails, and IP addresses so that they can get back into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroups that they have been banned from. Just a reminder that this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to educate you about flamers incase you run into these folks. You
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; handle these people and you have unlimited possibilities you can have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet.com.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Newsgroup Flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What are newsgroup flamers?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are basically people who subscribe to a Usenet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroup with the aim of posting provocative and slanderous articles,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; often referred to as &quot;flamebait&quot;, that will elicit angry responses
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from other Usenet users. This sort of behavior often results in a full
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blown argument, called a &quot;flame war&quot;. A flame war is what a newsgroup
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flamer wants.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are usually called trolls. A troll's disruptive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behavior is often called &quot;trolling&quot;. The term first appeared on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet, but has been used in IRC chat rooms and on Internet discussion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boards and email lists.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers or trolls often try to play the role of Devil's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Advocate in Usenet discussion groups, especially discussion groups
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dedicated to the discussion of religion, philosophy and politics. Of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course, a sincere provocateur will introduce him or her self, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers tend to hide behind the mask of anonymity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How to recognize Usenet flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Usenet flamer is easy to spot. A Usenet flamer:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Shows no understanding of Usenet etiquette or Netiquette
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Posts long &quot;off topic&quot; articles
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Complains that newsgroup discussion is &quot;off topic&quot; and rudely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; demands that everything stay &quot;on topic&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Denounces the beliefs of other newsgroup subscribers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Makes provocative statements that never get to the source of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion but are purely aimed at raising havoc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Attacks other newsgroup subscribers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How to deal with Usenet flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The behavior of a Usenet flamer or troll is problematic, because most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroup subscribers just want to participate in good discussion and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; file-sharing and flamers are simply disruptive. Always think before
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you respond to any provocative comment or file by a person you don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know in your discussion group. The best advice is to simply ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers. If you have any real concerns about the activity of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamer, you may also contact your Usenet Service Provider's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; support team.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I already knew all that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure you did. Psychotic bullies, such as the President of the United
&gt; &gt; &gt; States,

&gt; &gt; Dubya's probably not smart enough to be a psychotic bully.

&gt; &gt; &gt; the Vice President of the United States, and you, know
&gt; &gt; &gt; everything they need to know because they've learned, typically from a
&gt; &gt; &gt; physically, sexually or both physically and sexually abusive father,
&gt; &gt; &gt; never to be weak, never to admit weakness, because if you do you end
&gt; &gt; &gt; up on the floor of the kitchen weeping and bleeding like an animal.

&gt; &gt; Aha... now we're getting to it. Like I said, you need professional
&gt; &gt; psychiatric help, dude.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Newsgroup Flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What are newsgroup flamers?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are basically people who subscribe to a Usenet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroup with the aim of posting provocative and slanderous articles,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; often referred to as &quot;flamebait&quot;, that will elicit angry responses
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from other Usenet users. This sort of behavior often results in a full
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blown argument, called a &quot;flame war&quot;. A flame war is what a newsgroup
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flamer wants.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are usually called trolls. A troll's disruptive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behavior is often called &quot;trolling&quot;. The term first appeared on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet, but has been used in IRC chat rooms and on Internet discussion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boards and email lists.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers or trolls often try to play the role of Devil's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Advocate in Usenet discussion groups, especially discussion groups
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dedicated to the discussion of religion, philosophy and politics. Of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course, a sincere provocateur will introduce him or her self, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers tend to hide behind the mask of anonymity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How to recognize Usenet flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Usenet flamer is easy to spot. A Usenet flamer:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Shows no understanding of Usenet etiquette or Netiquette
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Posts long &quot;off topic&quot; articles
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Complains that newsgroup discussion is &quot;off topic&quot; and rudely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; demands that everything stay &quot;on topic&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Denounces the beliefs of other newsgroup subscribers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Makes provocative statements that never get to the source of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion but are purely aimed at raising havoc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Attacks other newsgroup subscribers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How to deal with Usenet flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The behavior of a Usenet flamer or troll is problematic, because most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroup subscribers just want to participate in good discussion and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; file-sharing and flamers are simply disruptive. Always think before
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you respond to any provocative comment or file by a person you don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know in your discussion group. The best advice is to simply ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers. If you have any real concerns about the activity of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamer, you may also contact your Usenet Service Provider's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; support team.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I already knew all that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sure you did. Psychotic bullies, such as the President of the United

&gt; &gt; &gt; Dubya's probably not smart enough to be a psychotic bully.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Vice President of the United States, and you, know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything they need to know because they've learned, typically from a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physically, sexually or both physically and sexually abusive father,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never to be weak, never to admit weakness, because if you do you end
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up on the floor of the kitchen weeping and bleeding like an animal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Aha... now we're getting to it. Like I said, you need professional

You have what I have already described as an authoritarian personality
disorder. This is a person who grovels to authority and in
compensation bullies and abuses people he thinks can't strike back
(you made a mistake in my case, and your conduct has been reported to
Google).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Funny how trolls support each other.-

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the Usenet world have you heard the word flame or flamer?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little article is for education and not to scare you because Usenet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has unlimited advantages with some trash that comes with. Ever been to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a message board and made a post about a controversial topic only to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have someone slam you in their reply? That my friend is a FLAMER. Some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can be polite and some can be downright nasty with nothing on their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind then just tick you off. The fun part is that flamers is an issue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that won't go away any time soon so we just deal with these people the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best way that we can. If you happen to post something controversial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then your chances of getting flamed increases. You'll get flamers from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all over the world who try to prove you wrong, or steer you in their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; direction. My advice is NEVER give in and stay the course. Flamers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come in all shapes and sizes but they all have one motive, to ruin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your day. Again don't let them. Some flamers are known to ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warnings, and break forum rules. They do things like having backup
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usernames, emails, and IP addresses so that they can get back into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroups that they have been banned from. Just a reminder that this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to educate you about flamers incase you run into these folks. You
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; handle these people and you have unlimited possibilities you can have

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; despised ignoramus, nugatory.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice to see that you identify with Nilges.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Funny how trolls support each other.-

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the Usenet world have you heard the word flame or flamer?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little article is for education and not to scare you because Usenet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has unlimited advantages with some trash that comes with. Ever been to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a message board and made a post about a controversial topic only to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have someone slam you in their reply? That my friend is a FLAMER. Some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can be polite and some can be downright nasty with nothing on their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind then just tick you off. The fun part is that flamers is an issue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that won't go away any time soon so we just deal with these people the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best way that we can. If you happen to post something controversial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then your chances of getting flamed increases. You'll get flamers from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all over the world who try to prove you wrong, or steer you in their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; direction. My advice is NEVER give in and stay the course. Flamers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come in all shapes and sizes but they all have one motive, to ruin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your day. Again don't let them. Some flamers are known to ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warnings, and break forum rules. They do things like having backup
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usernames, emails, and IP addresses so that they can get back into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroups that they have been banned from. Just a reminder that this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to educate you about flamers incase you run into these folks. You
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; handle these people and you have unlimited possibilities you can have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet.com.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Newsgroup Flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What are newsgroup flamers?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are basically people who subscribe to a Usenet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroup with the aim of posting provocative and slanderous articles,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; often referred to as &quot;flamebait&quot;, that will elicit angry responses
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from other Usenet users. This sort of behavior often results in a full
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blown argument, called a &quot;flame war&quot;. A flame war is what a newsgroup
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flamer wants.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are usually called trolls. A troll's disruptive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behavior is often called &quot;trolling&quot;. The term first appeared on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet, but has been used in IRC chat rooms and on Internet discussion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boards and email lists.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers or trolls often try to play the role of Devil's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Advocate in Usenet discussion groups, especially discussion groups
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dedicated to the discussion of religion, philosophy and politics. Of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course, a sincere provocateur will introduce him or her self, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers tend to hide behind the mask of anonymity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How to recognize Usenet flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Usenet flamer is easy to spot. A Usenet flamer:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Shows no understanding of Usenet etiquette or Netiquette
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Posts long &quot;off topic&quot; articles
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Complains that newsgroup discussion is &quot;off topic&quot; and rudely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; demands that everything stay &quot;on topic&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Denounces the beliefs of other newsgroup subscribers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Makes provocative statements that never get to the source of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion but are purely aimed at raising havoc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Attacks other newsgroup subscribers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How to deal with Usenet flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The behavior of a Usenet flamer or troll is problematic, because most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroup subscribers just want to participate in good discussion and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; file-sharing and flamers are simply disruptive. Always think before
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you respond to any provocative comment or file by a person you don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know in your discussion group. The best advice is to simply ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers. If you have any real concerns about the activity of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamer, you may also contact your Usenet Service Provider's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; support team.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I already knew all that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sure you did. Psychotic bullies, such as the President of the United
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; States,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dubya's probably not smart enough to be a psychotic bully.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Vice President of the United States, and you, know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything they need to know because they've learned, typically from a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physically, sexually or both physically and sexually abusive father,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never to be weak, never to admit weakness, because if you do you end
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up on the floor of the kitchen weeping and bleeding like an animal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aha... now we're getting to it. Like I said, you need professional
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; psychiatric help, dude.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Transference is a strong symptom of your problems, not mine.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What problems are those, fuck you?

&gt; &gt; You have what I have already described as an authoritarian personality
&gt; &gt; disorder.

&gt; Projecting again. Wrong again.

&gt; &gt; This is a person who grovels to authority and in
&gt; &gt; compensation bullies and abuses people he thinks can't strike back
&gt; &gt; (you made a mistake in my case, and your conduct has been reported to
&gt; &gt; Google).

&gt; Google's finding out about it was my intention. Maybe they'll sort out
&gt; the trolls here, and save me the trouble.- Hide quoted text -

If you manage a Fascist takeover of Google, all we "trolls" have to do
is rejoin under new names, or else set up a Mark Houlsby mockery site.
We'll let you post, of course. We need a laugh.

You Fascist little thug, you're fifty years out of date, because you
are trying the Fascist gesture of taking over the most advanced media.
This worked when your kind could invade radio stations and beat people
up. It has NEVER worked on the internet, and you are a pathetic fool.

You're missing the point. If Google takes care of the trolls here
(this means you) then I shan't need to do it any longer. They can
check IP addresses, and also monitor the content of posts.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then your chances of getting flamed increases. You'll get flamers from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all over the world who try to prove you wrong, or steer you in their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; direction. My advice is NEVER give in and stay the course. Flamers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come in all shapes and sizes but they all have one motive, to ruin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your day. Again don't let them. Some flamers are known to ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warnings, and break forum rules. They do things like having backup
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usernames, emails, and IP addresses so that they can get back into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroups that they have been banned from. Just a reminder that this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to educate you about flamers incase you run into these folks. You
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; handle these people and you have unlimited possibilities you can have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet.com.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Newsgroup Flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What are newsgroup flamers?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are basically people who subscribe to a Usenet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroup with the aim of posting provocative and slanderous articles,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; often referred to as &quot;flamebait&quot;, that will elicit angry responses
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from other Usenet users. This sort of behavior often results in a full
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blown argument, called a &quot;flame war&quot;. A flame war is what a newsgroup
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flamer wants.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are usually called trolls. A troll's disruptive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behavior is often called &quot;trolling&quot;. The term first appeared on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet, but has been used in IRC chat rooms and on Internet discussion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boards and email lists.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers or trolls often try to play the role of Devil's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Advocate in Usenet discussion groups, especially discussion groups
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dedicated to the discussion of religion, philosophy and politics. Of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course, a sincere provocateur will introduce him or her self, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers tend to hide behind the mask of anonymity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How to recognize Usenet flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Usenet flamer is easy to spot. A Usenet flamer:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Shows no understanding of Usenet etiquette or Netiquette
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Posts long &quot;off topic&quot; articles
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Complains that newsgroup discussion is &quot;off topic&quot; and rudely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; demands that everything stay &quot;on topic&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Denounces the beliefs of other newsgroup subscribers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Makes provocative statements that never get to the source of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion but are purely aimed at raising havoc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Attacks other newsgroup subscribers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How to deal with Usenet flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The behavior of a Usenet flamer or troll is problematic, because most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroup subscribers just want to participate in good discussion and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; file-sharing and flamers are simply disruptive. Always think before
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you respond to any provocative comment or file by a person you don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know in your discussion group. The best advice is to simply ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers. If you have any real concerns about the activity of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamer, you may also contact your Usenet Service Provider's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; support team.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I already knew all that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sure you did. Psychotic bullies, such as the President of the United
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; States,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dubya's probably not smart enough to be a psychotic bully.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Vice President of the United States, and you, know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything they need to know because they've learned, typically from a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physically, sexually or both physically and sexually abusive father,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never to be weak, never to admit weakness, because if you do you end
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up on the floor of the kitchen weeping and bleeding like an animal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aha... now we're getting to it. Like I said, you need professional
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; psychiatric help, dude.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disorder.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Projecting again. Wrong again.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a person who grovels to authority and in

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (you made a mistake in my case, and your conduct has been reported to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Google).

&gt; &gt; &gt; Google's finding out about it was my intention. Maybe they'll sort out
&gt; &gt; &gt; the trolls here, and save me the trouble.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; If you manage a Fascist takeover of Google, all we &quot;trolls&quot; have to do
&gt; &gt; is rejoin under new names, or else set up a Mark Houlsby mockery site.

&gt; You're missing the point. If Google takes care of the trolls here

You're astonishingly ignorant out how things work here, for someone
who wants to be in charge.

Google does not have the resources or the will to monitor usenet which
has traditionally been open to all posts EXCEPT illegal posts
including posts that can be grounds for a civil lawsuit for stalking
and libel, which I think your posts are. My report will trigger some
sort of investigation and follow up, and it won't go well for you, in
all probability, when your post volume is linked to the content in
which you tell people to "shut the fuck up". The admin will notice a
cyclical pattern in which you initiate bullying and may call you to
account.

I wouldn't say you "troll", but this is only because the verb was
invented, and taken from the language of abuse of the homeless in
Santa Cruz, CA, by system admins with authoritarian personality
disorders who lived in a cyberculture of normalized deviance and
normalized bullying. They didn't want to draw attention to bullying
because in their political subconscious they knew that their

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all over the world who try to prove you wrong, or steer you in their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; direction. My advice is NEVER give in and stay the course. Flamers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come in all shapes and sizes but they all have one motive, to ruin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your day. Again don't let them. Some flamers are known to ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warnings, and break forum rules. They do things like having backup
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usernames, emails, and IP addresses so that they can get back into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroups that they have been banned from. Just a reminder that this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to educate you about flamers incase you run into these folks. You
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; handle these people and you have unlimited possibilities you can have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet.com.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Newsgroup Flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What are newsgroup flamers?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are basically people who subscribe to a Usenet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroup with the aim of posting provocative and slanderous articles,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; often referred to as &quot;flamebait&quot;, that will elicit angry responses
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from other Usenet users. This sort of behavior often results in a full
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blown argument, called a &quot;flame war&quot;. A flame war is what a newsgroup
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flamer wants.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are usually called trolls. A troll's disruptive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behavior is often called &quot;trolling&quot;. The term first appeared on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet, but has been used in IRC chat rooms and on Internet discussion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boards and email lists.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers or trolls often try to play the role of Devil's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Advocate in Usenet discussion groups, especially discussion groups
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dedicated to the discussion of religion, philosophy and politics. Of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course, a sincere provocateur will introduce him or her self, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers tend to hide behind the mask of anonymity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How to recognize Usenet flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Usenet flamer is easy to spot. A Usenet flamer:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Shows no understanding of Usenet etiquette or Netiquette
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Posts long &quot;off topic&quot; articles
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Complains that newsgroup discussion is &quot;off topic&quot; and rudely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; demands that everything stay &quot;on topic&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Denounces the beliefs of other newsgroup subscribers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Makes provocative statements that never get to the source of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion but are purely aimed at raising havoc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Attacks other newsgroup subscribers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How to deal with Usenet flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The behavior of a Usenet flamer or troll is problematic, because most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroup subscribers just want to participate in good discussion and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; file-sharing and flamers are simply disruptive. Always think before
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you respond to any provocative comment or file by a person you don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know in your discussion group. The best advice is to simply ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers. If you have any real concerns about the activity of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamer, you may also contact your Usenet Service Provider's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; support team.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I already knew all that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sure you did. Psychotic bullies, such as the President of the United
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; States,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dubya's probably not smart enough to be a psychotic bully.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Vice President of the United States, and you, know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything they need to know because they've learned, typically from a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physically, sexually or both physically and sexually abusive father,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never to be weak, never to admit weakness, because if you do you end
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up on the floor of the kitchen weeping and bleeding like an animal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aha... now we're getting to it. Like I said, you need professional
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; psychiatric help, dude.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Transference is a strong symptom of your problems, not mine.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What problems are those, fuck you?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You have what I have already described as an authoritarian personality
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disorder.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Projecting again. Wrong again.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a person who grovels to authority and in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compensation bullies and abuses people he thinks can't strike back
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (you made a mistake in my case, and your conduct has been reported to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Google).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Google's finding out about it was my intention. Maybe they'll sort out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the trolls here, and save me the trouble.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you manage a Fascist takeover of Google, all we &quot;trolls&quot; have to do
&gt; &gt; &gt; is rejoin under new names, or else set up a Mark Houlsby mockery site.
&gt; &gt; &gt; We'll let you post, of course. We need a laugh.

&gt; &gt; You're missing the point. If Google takes care of the trolls here
&gt; &gt; (this means you) then I shan't need to do it any longer. They can
&gt; &gt; check IP addresses, and also monitor the content of posts.

&gt; You're astonishingly ignorant out how things work here, for someone
&gt; who wants to be in charge.

&gt; Google does not have the resources or the will to monitor usenet which
&gt; has traditionally been open to all posts EXCEPT illegal posts
&gt; including posts that can be grounds for a civil lawsuit for stalking
&gt; and libel, which I think your posts are. My report will trigger some
&gt; sort of investigation and follow up, and it won't go well for you, in
&gt; all probability, when your post volume is linked to the content in
&gt; which you tell people to &quot;shut the fuck up&quot;. The admin will notice a
&gt; cyclical pattern in which you initiate bullying and may call you to
&gt; account.

&gt; I wouldn't say you &quot;troll&quot;, but this is only because the verb was
&gt; invented, and taken from the language of abuse of the homeless in
&gt; Santa Cruz,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Trollsby is an obvious adherent of B.F. Skinner's crude behaviourism.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He thinks he can control the behaviour of others by instituting a

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; padded feather duster and his rewards, given that he is a much
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; despised ignoramus, nugatory.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice to see that you identify with Nilges.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Funny how trolls support each other.-

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the Usenet world have you heard the word flame or flamer?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little article is for education and not to scare you because Usenet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has unlimited advantages with some trash that comes with. Ever been to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a message board and made a post about a controversial topic only to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have someone slam you in their reply? That my friend is a FLAMER. Some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can be polite and some can be downright nasty with nothing on their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind then just tick you off. The fun part is that flamers is an issue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that won't go away any time soon so we just deal with these people the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best way that we can. If you happen to post something controversial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then your chances of getting flamed increases. You'll get flamers from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all over the world who try to prove you wrong, or steer you in their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; direction. My advice is NEVER give in and stay the course. Flamers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come in all shapes and sizes but they all have one motive, to ruin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your day. Again don't let them. Some flamers are known to ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warnings, and break forum rules. They do things like having backup
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usernames, emails, and IP addresses so that they can get back into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroups that they have been banned from. Just a reminder that this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to educate you about flamers incase you run into these folks. You
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; handle these people and you have unlimited possibilities you can have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet.com.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Newsgroup Flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What are newsgroup flamers?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are basically people who subscribe to a Usenet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroup with the aim of posting provocative and slanderous articles,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; often referred to as &quot;flamebait&quot;, that will elicit angry responses
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from other Usenet users. This sort of behavior often results in a full
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blown argument, called a &quot;flame war&quot;. A flame war is what a newsgroup
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flamer wants.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers are usually called trolls. A troll's disruptive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behavior is often called &quot;trolling&quot;. The term first appeared on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet, but has been used in IRC chat rooms and on Internet discussion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boards and email lists.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers or trolls often try to play the role of Devil's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Advocate in Usenet discussion groups, especially discussion groups
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dedicated to the discussion of religion, philosophy and politics. Of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course, a sincere provocateur will introduce him or her self, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers tend to hide behind the mask of anonymity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How to recognize Usenet flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Usenet flamer is easy to spot. A Usenet flamer:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Shows no understanding of Usenet etiquette or Netiquette
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Posts long &quot;off topic&quot; articles
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Complains that newsgroup discussion is &quot;off topic&quot; and rudely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; demands that everything stay &quot;on topic&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Denounces the beliefs of other newsgroup subscribers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Makes provocative statements that never get to the source of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion but are purely aimed at raising havoc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Attacks other newsgroup subscribers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How to deal with Usenet flamers

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The behavior of a Usenet flamer or troll is problematic, because most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newsgroup subscribers just want to participate in good discussion and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; file-sharing and flamers are simply disruptive. Always think before
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you respond to any provocative comment or file by a person you don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know in your discussion group. The best advice is to simply ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamers. If you have any real concerns about the activity of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usenet flamer, you may also contact your Usenet Service Provider's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; support team.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I already knew all that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sure you did. Psychotic bullies, such as the President of the United
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; States,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dubya's probably not smart enough to be a psychotic bully.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Vice President of the United States, and you, know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything they need to know because they've learned, typically from a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physically, sexually or both physically and sexually abusive father,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never to be weak, never to admit weakness, because if you do you end
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up on the floor of the kitchen weeping and bleeding like an animal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aha... now we're getting to it. Like I said, you need professional
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; psychiatric help, dude.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Transference is a strong symptom of your problems, not mine.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What problems are those, fuck you?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You have what I have already described as an authoritarian personality
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disorder.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Projecting again. Wrong again.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a person who grovels to authority and in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compensation bullies and abuses people he thinks can't strike back
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (you made a mistake in my case, and your conduct has been reported to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Google).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Google's finding out about it was my intention. Maybe they'll sort out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the trolls here, and save me the trouble.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you manage a Fascist takeover of Google, all we &quot;trolls&quot; have to do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is rejoin under new names, or else set up a Mark Houlsby mockery site.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We'll let you post, of course. We need a laugh.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You're missing the point. If Google takes care of the trolls here
&gt; &gt; &gt; (this means you) then I shan't need to do it any longer. They can
&gt; &gt; &gt; check IP addresses, and also monitor the content of posts.

&gt; &gt; You're astonishingly ignorant out how things work here, for someone
&gt; &gt; who wants to be in charge.

&gt; &gt; Google does not have the resources or the will to monitor usenet which
&gt; &gt; has traditionally been open to all posts EXCEPT illegal posts
&gt; &gt; including posts that can be grounds for a civil lawsuit for stalking
&gt; &gt; and libel, which I think your posts are. My report will trigger some

Sorry that the responses are prolix, and because few people have my
ability to write, they look on superficial examination rather
obsessive, and their dignified syntax on only a slightly closer
investigation seems otiose for the "matter at hand", which is for the
typical downsized usenet user the triviality of life in the middle.

The reason for the apparent otioseness and obsessive quality is that
IF I'm right, if we see here a genesis of Fascism and a new Holocaust,
then this is an important matter, and "Bush haters" who don't vote and
seek deliberately to take over usenet need to be carpet bombed.

Jim, these reductions to ironic infancy (where Fascism is the
nightmare of childhood) are caused by the refusal of good people to
use language with self-esteem, including saying just as much as is
necessary to show you've done your homework on why this clown's
behavior bugs the shit out of you.
