A Speed Limit for Massive Particles?

Particles with mass can not be accelerated to the speed of light.  This much
we accept.

Let's take the case of a moon sized object and an observer in a rocket who
is stationary with respect to that object.  Having nothing better to do, the
rocket observer gives the moon a push, all the way up to 0.999c with respect
to the initial unaccelerated frame.

But after this acceleration event another rocketeer shows up and claims that
the moon has not accelerated at all, that it is stationary.  He now
accelerates the moon up to 0.999c with respect to his previously stationary
frame (let this all be in the same direction).

This scenario can be repeated ad nausium.  Each time the moon is accelerated
it is a little faster with respect to that initial stationary frame.

Einstein saw this one coming - he recons that anyone can count themselves to
be stationary.  This means, by extension, that any object can count some
other frame as stationary.  This means that the speed limit of a moon sized
object can be inferred by calculating the fastest frame that can be measured
from that moon's surface.  That is because the other object could be
stationary and the moon could be moving at a great velocity.

Thus one can *measure* the maximum speed of an object like a moon by the
speed of the fastest object that can be measured from the surface of that
moon.

Why the surface?  Gravitational time dilation may effect the measurement of
a space object's speed (though I personally count a gravitational length
contraction of space objects as measured from the surface of an object, not
everyone seems to concur.  The 1919 measurement of light curling around the
sun should be sufficient to prove this effect from a purely optical
perspective ie the light begins to diverge before it passes by the sun so
that from the surface of, say, a neutron star, the width of space objects
would appear to be far less because the light from the edges of that object
would have deviated inward (assuming the object is, say, a moon, the disc of
the moon would have a smaller circumference).  But that is all off the topic
of this thread...)

On the speed limit question, there should be another way that a speed limit
can be established.  Gravitational time dilation on an Earth sized object is
measurable.  I assume that time dilation can not be greater than infinite ie
photon emitted from that object and detected by a space observer (or never
detected, as the case may be) can not have a frequency lower than zero or a
wavelength greater than infinite.  As the frequency of a beam of light
emitted from a planet's surface is already lower, then the maximum speed of
the Earth must be lower than, say, a speck of dust that has a much lower
gravitational time dilation.

In essence I am suggesting that the combination of time dilation caused by
gravity and time dilation caused by the relative motion of the object must
be mathematically summed in some way and the combination of the two will be
greater than the time dilation caused by the object's relative motion alone.

Thus the speed limit can be calculated for, say, the Earth or the moon and
that speed limit must be lower for the moon than a dust particle and lower
for the Earth than the moon.

Using this addition logic we come to Black Holes where time dilation is
already off the scale (or gamma etc etc - I am just using time dilation as
an example of relativistic changes).  Thus a black hole can not be
accelerated - it can not move from its current spatial location - it stays
put.  Said in another way - regardless of the mass of a black hole, it would
take an infinite amount of energy to move it nowhere.

In other words a Black Hole can not acquire relativistic time dilation
caused by its relative motion.  Thus all observers must be moving relative
to the local Black Hole.

Obviously I have saved ink by framing conjecture and intuitive reasoning in
a "this is so" format ie I have omitted the apologies for thinking until
here.  Please read the above as a set of questions rather than proposed
answers.

It would be a boring experience. You would get a maxi stomach ache.

The black hole would bore a hole through you as it fell toward the center
of the earth. The tidal forces it exerted would be small, to begin with,
but enough to kill cells near its path. (and probably you)

Each time it got too close to a particle it would 'eat it', giving off some
rather nasty radiation in the process.

I doubt that you would relish the experience, or survive it.

It would then oscillate back and forth through the earth as it ate the
earth.

That would be the intuitive first approximation.  However, time dilation is
already at maximum for a stationary Black Hole.  How is the additional time
dilation caused by the motion of the Black Hole summed to its intrinsic time
dilation?  Does time run backward?  For light speed, where time dilation is
also at maximum, the speed can not be increased by emitting light from a
moving body.  A similar phenomena may apply to Black Holes, but with the
apparent motion being the illusion.

Distal motion may be an illusion.  How, for instance, are you going to
determine which of two Black Holes is moving?  As you approach a Black Hole,
everything you can measure indicates that it is unmoveable and so must be
stationary.

This illusion is already known for light.  The speed of light is c as
measured from any inertial frame.  I am saying that a complementary
phenomena is that of the Black hole - that the speed of a Black Hole is zero
as measured from any inertial frame.

We might ask "but all light can not have the same speed!!"  That is the
classical (Newtonian) conclusion.  Why do we assume that the same classical
three dimensional space model will apply to Black Holes?

A clock on the moon runs slower than an equivalent space based clock.  This
we know.  If you now accelerate the moon up to some great speed, the moon
clock will appear to have slowed relative to the space based clock.

Are you saying that the moon in motion is excused from relativistic time
dilation because it already has gravitational time dilation??

Or is the motional and gravitational time dilation somehow separate?  Do we
need to have two clocks on the surface of the moon?

Please, this is not rocket science.  The two forms of time dilation must
both contribute to the total time dilation as read on a clock on the surface
of the moon when the moon is in motion.

We can think of it in a classical thought experiment.  Consider an object
emitting a signal once per second.  Now, this object is moving away from us
at some great velocity.  Each successive signal has further to travel and so
the signal will be detected at greater than one second intervals.  This is
the Doppler Effect.

Now we consider the time dilation caused by the objects relative motion
(relativistic time dilation).  This means that a clock on the fast moving
object is running slower.  We now have two cases of measured time dilation -
the Doppler effect and time dilation.  This is called Relativistic time
dilation.

Now we add a third component - the mass of the object also contributes to
time dilation.  Even when the object is stationary with respect to the
observer the 1s signal as emitted is greater than 1s as detected by the
space observer.  As the object moves away we have Doppler effect and as it
approaches great speed the relativistic time dilation will also become
measurable (though it is present at any speed).

What I am saying is that the speed limit for the object must be where the
redshift becomes infinite which is going to be below the speed of light.

For an approaching object we have the blue shift caused by the Doppler
Effect but red shift caused by relativistic time dilation (caused by the
objects relative speed) and gravitational time dilation.

Schwarzschild's calculation says that time dilation is off the scale.

The Schwarzschild radius is r=2GM/c^2
Gravitational Time dilation is gamma=(1-2GM/c^2r)^.5

Thus we can substitute r in the gravitational time dilation equation for
2GM/c^2 if the object is a Black Hole
we get gamma=(1-1)^.5=0  A gamma of 1 indicates no time dilation.

That is implied when you say that a black hole can not be accelerated.

When you say it can not move from its current spacial location, you also
imply some 'absolute' set of coordinates.

Picture a body that is ready to become a black hole, as soon as another
gram of matter is added. This body is moving at .5 c wrt the earth.

We add 1 gram of matter and the body collapses into a black hole.
By your logic, it must suddenly stop moving, like a car that has dropped
its motor.  Oh, but you say that the car doesn't stop moving instantly
because it has inertia.

So too with the black hole.

It does not matter to those OUTSIDE the black hole. From the outside, it
should (and apparently does) act much like any other mass.

As for 'from the inside', there are indications that our universe is a
black hole (as seen from the outside), so you KNOW what things are like
inside a black hole.

What happens crossing the event horizon? That is something that we can
never know unless we cross an event horizon, and then we can not report

Imagine an inertial frame tied to the center of our galaxy, which probably
contains a giant black hole.
Imagine another inertial frame tied to the center of another galaxy (pick
one, almost any one as most seem to contain black holes).

By your logic, neither of those inertial frames can move with respect to
the other. But galaxies are in relative motion with respect to each other.
There seems to be a contradiction somewhere. Perhaps your assumptions are
wrong. Perhaps one CAN measure the motion of a black hole as long as one is
outside of the black hole.

The classsical three dimensional space model will not apply as we cross the

of physics still apply.

Gravity must cross the boundry, otherwise the black hole would completely
disappear as soon as it came into existance.

Inertia must because it is tied to gravity.

Once you have the 'handles' of gravity and inertia, to use to contact the
black hole, it must obey the same laws of physics, with respect to those
properties as must any other mass.

&gt;&gt; &gt; In essence I am suggesting that the combination of time
&gt;&gt; &gt; dilation caused by gravity and time dilation caused by
&gt;&gt; &gt; the relative motion of the object must be mathematically
&gt;&gt; &gt; summed in some way and the combination of the two
&gt;&gt; &gt; will be greater than the time dilation caused by the
&gt;&gt; &gt; object's relative motion alone.

&gt;&gt; Contributions to spacetime curvature come from two
&gt;&gt; terms, mass and energy.  The gravitational mass of
&gt;&gt; the &quot;moon&quot; in your example is unaffected either by its
&gt;&gt; motion, or the motion of other objects.

&gt; A clock on the moon runs slower than an equivalent
&gt; space based clock.  This we know.  If you now
&gt; accelerate the moon up to some great speed, the moon
&gt; clock will appear to have slowed relative to the space
&gt; based clock.
...
&gt; What I am saying is that the speed limit for the object
&gt; must be where the redshift becomes infinite which is
&gt; going to be below the speed of light.

No.  The speed limit is where you run out of energy to accelerate
either yourself or the object.  We have driven electrons in
excess of 0.99999c.  We have bounced photons off of these, to get
*very large* boosts in photon energy.

The formula you cite describes what an external observer sees.
Since outbound light is "stuck" at the EH, any events that occur
there essentially never make it out into the Universe at large.
It has nothing to do with observers crossing the event horizon,

You may think you know that, but the rest of us do not.

What we do know is that SIGNALS from one clock to the other display a
difference in frequency, but there is no definitive way to assign the
change to the signals or to the clock (as you implicitly do). Indeed,
one can self-consistently consider this either a change in the frequency
of the signals, or a change in the tick rate of the clock, or any
combination. This is in essence the freedom to select any coordinate
system, because to ascribe the observed frequency difference to clock or
signals one must assign simultaneity all along the signal path....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The situation is very much more complicated than your overly simplistic

"Time dilation" has nothing directly to do with speed limits. Moreover,
the "time dilation" of SR is for a SPECIFIC PHYSICAL SITUATION which is
different from the situations you are considering. There is no simple
way to discuss "time dilation" except for that specific situation (hence
my quotation marks).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; time dilation within
&gt; the event horizin can not increase further because it already at maximum.
">

"Time dilation within the event horizon" has no meaning whatsoever
(implicitly you are considering "time dilation" relative to coordinates
far away). You cannot discuss "time dilation" when the observer cannot
observe the other clock, and the external observer cannot observe any
clock at or inside the horizon.

You can consider it the other way around -- consider the blueshift of
signals from an external clock to an infalling clock that falls inside
the horizon. This blueshift remains finite everywhere within the black
hole, until the infalling clock is destroyed near the central singularity.

Note my change from "time dilation" to BLUESHIFT -- the former
is a relationship between a clock and a coordinate system; the
latter is a relationship between signals from one clock and
another clock. This way I don't need to worry about what local
coordinates to use. Blueshift of signals can be directly
measured by a single clock (+ detector); "time dilation"
cannot.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

This is overly simplistic -- "time dilation" is NOT an intrinsic
property of an object, it is a RELATIONSHIP between a clock and A
COORDINATE SYSTEM (not another clock). Using approximately inertial
distant coordinates in which the black hole is at rest, consider the
locus where the "time dilation" has some specific finite value (say
ratio of frequencies = 10) -- this locus will be a sphere surrounding
the black hole's horizon (I assume a Schwarzschild black hole). In
distant approximately inertial coordinates in which the black hole is
moving uniformly, that locus will not be a sphere; moreover, the
difference in synchronization between these and the previous coordinates
imply that in this frame when one considers a locus with that same time
dilation but SIMULTANEOUS in these second coordinates, the locus is
deformed still more. Note that to consider "time dilation" due to motion
one must consider the simultaneity in the second coordinates. You have
not considered the effects of the difference in simultaneity between
these sets of coordinates -- that's one reason why "time dilation" is
not "additive" as you implicitly assume (other reasons are that other
components of the metric become important in such coordinates, and the
metric components are no longer independent of time).

IOW: when the second observer looks at the locus having that "time
dilation" she finds a DIFFERENT locus than the first observer, because
simultaneity in her coordinates is DIFFERENT from simultaneity in the
first coordinates.

This is just plain false. Moreover, it is self INconsistent (there can
be only one universal speed, and c is already universal). And there are
no inertial coordinates that cover a universe containing a black hole....

Indeed, there are not even APPROXIMATELY inertial coordinates
that include any region where the "time dilation" due to
the gravitation of the black hole is significant. There are
only APPROXIMATELY inertial coordinates in regions far from
the horizon, and all the "time dilations" you consider must be
negligible for the coordinates to be APPROXIMATELY inertial.

In short, your whole program of attempting to make conclusions based on
"time dilation" is nonsense. To properly consider the situations you
attempt to discuss requires one to compute the metric components in the
various coordinate systems....

A space observer compared to a clock on the surface of the Black Hole.  A

Who is moving - the observer or the Black Hole??  In the case of a passing
beam of light we always know it is the beam of light that is moving because
light speed is not possible for massive bodies.  But apart from light,
either the observer or the object observed could be moving, but no-one can
pronounce from on high, having seen the answer in some burning bush, that
one or the other is necessarily stationary with respect to the other.

The only caveat to my re-jigging of the common-or-garden variety of the
twins paradox is where one object accelerates (say object B), say one object
turns around and heads in the opposite direction.  We can still not say
whether object B was stationary before it turned or after it turned or
neither before or after (eg only object A is stationary with respect to B
and B is never stationary with respect to object A).

If it is possible for a black hole to have inertial motion, which seems
reasonably plausible, acceleration is something else.  When an object
accelerates the time dilation on one part of the object, say the leading
edge, does not necessarily match the other, say the trailing edge.

If you were to push a black hole, would the event horizon deform and how
would this be modelled?  It is not as simple as one might think.

&gt; So too with the black hole.
">

You can't simply add a bit of matter to an object to form a Black Hole.

You are forgetting General Relativity.  Think of the rubber sheet model.
When an object moves, it is like a steel ball rolling across the sheet - the
sheet deforms.

Consider a bowling ball sitting in the middle of the sheet.  Now a small
ball rolls past it, deforming the sheet as it goes.  As it passes the
bowling ball, the sheet around the larger ball is ever so slightly lowered
on the side of the smaller ball and the bowling ball moves toward it.  In
principle, in a darkish corner of the universe, a sun sized (dark) object
will move slightly toward a single passing photon.

Now we take the Black Hole.  It deforms the sheet so much that it does not
move when a photon passes by.  This is because the sides of the rubber sheet
are perfectly vertical.  So when an object passes by the ball representing
the Black Hole it might go down a little lower in the sheet, but it does not
move in the direction of the massive object passing by - not one millimetre,
even if the other object was also a black hole.

The steepness of the sheet, or of spacetime near a Black Hole, is often
given as an analogue of GR.  Here is a more classical reason to consider the
stationary status of the Black Hole.  As time dilation is infinite on the
Surface (or equivalent for Black Holes) of the Black Hole is infinite/zero
(infinite interval between events, frequency of events is zero relative to
any clock not in the same inertial frame) it takes an infinite amount of
time for the Black Hole to move toward a passing massive object.

As for absolute spatial coordinates - a lack of absolute spatial coordinates
never stopped a photon from passing an observer at the speed of light.  The
same argument can be made for the Black Hole.  The black hole is not
stationary relative to some absolute spatial coordinate, but is stationary
relative to whatever frame you care to measure it from (just as the speed of
light is c as measured from any inertial frame).

As for acceleration we only need to think of the rubber sheet model once
more and the way the sheet deforms when an object accelerates.  For a Black
Hole the sides of the sheet are vertical and can not deform into a shape
typical of an accelerating object ie a little steeper at the front, a little
shallower at the rear (in SR, clocks on an accelerating rod will slow at
different rates with the clock on the leading edge running slower than the
clock on the trailing edge).

Thus a Black Hole is stationary with respect to all inertial frames and a
Black Hole can not accelerate.  But Black Holes are not stationary with
respect to some absolute spatial coordinate just as photons do not travel at
c with respect to some absolute stationary frame.  The speed that two Black
Holes may have relative to each other is similar in nature to the 2*c one
may measure for the speed difference of two photons travelling in opposite
directions.  Consider two objects travelling at fractionally lower than c
and in the opposite direction - measured from either object the other object
is travelling at less than c with respect to it.

&gt; It does not matter to those OUTSIDE the black hole. From the outside, it

&gt; As for 'from the inside', there are indications that our universe is a
&gt; black hole (as seen from the outside), so you KNOW what things are like
&gt; inside a black hole.
">

That is a Schwarzschild radius, not a singularity.

But you raise an interesting point.  If the universe were infinite then at
any point in the universe you would be on the event horizon of a
Schwarzschild radius.  Consider any direction you like (pretending, for a
moment, that our universe is infinite).  The matter in the direction you are
looking will form a Schwarzschild Black Hole with a centre at distance
r=(3c^2/8Gdpi)^.5  Thus the more dense the matter in that direction the
shorter the distance to the centre (of the BH).  But this is going to be
true in any direction you care to look - you'll see a Schwarzschild Back
Hole.

Now consider what you see from the event horizon of a low density
Schwarzschild Black Hole when you look from the event horizon toward the
centre.  We know that time dilation increases as you get closer to the black
hole centre.  So light will be progressively more redshifted.

Now, in an infinite universe there is a Schwarzschild radius in whatever
direction you look so light will be red shifted with greater distance in any
direction you care to look.  Say, isn't that EXACTLY what we see in our
universe?  Must be a coincidence?

Note that a General Relativistic modelling of the above would show that
space is expanding in any direction you look (just as space expands as you
look from the event horizon toward the centre of a Black Hole of any kind).

&gt; You may think you know that, but the rest of us do not.

&gt; What we do know is that SIGNALS from one clock to the other display a

&gt; one can self-consistently consider this either a change in the frequency

Clocks on Earth run slower than space based clocks.  How many references
would you like?
You don't like the idea that clocks can accumulate asynchrony eg two clocks
placed on the moon and in one space.  The two clocks on the moon are
synchronised (with each other only).  I shift one clock from the moon and
compare it to the space based clock.  The space based clock and the clock
shifted from the moon are now run at the same rate ie they both measure the
same length for an hour though they may show different time (they were not
synchronised when one of the clocks was on the moon.)

Now, if you are correct then when we move the second clock from the moon and
transport it to the space based clock the two moon clocks should show the
same time.  I say the clock left on the moon longer will display an earlier
time than the first moon clock.

How many references would you like to the correctness of this scenario???
It is my understanding that space based clocks used for GPS must have clocks
that run slower in order to match Earth bound clocks.  If you were right
then they would need only a single correction (to compensate for the
transportation to their position) and not a continual adjustment (by running
slower).

You've tried to explain away this phenomena before - engineers aren't
listening - they just adjust the clocks and be done with it.
The correction is 45,900 nanoseconds (ns) per day (not a once off correction
but PER DAY).

&gt; &quot;Time dilation within the event horizon&quot; has no meaning whatsoever
&gt; (implicitly you are considering &quot;time dilation&quot; relative to coordinates
&gt; far away). You cannot discuss &quot;time dilation&quot; when the observer cannot

&gt; clock at or inside the horizon.

Black Holes can evaporate, therefore clocks that were inside the event
horizon can, in principle, be compared to space based clocks.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You can consider it the other way around -- consider the blueshift of
&gt; signals from an external clock to an infalling clock that falls inside
&gt; the horizon. This blueshift remains finite everywhere within the black
&gt; hole, until the infalling clock is destroyed near the central singularity.

&gt; Note my change from &quot;time dilation&quot; to BLUESHIFT -- the former
&gt; is a relationship between a clock and a coordinate system; the
&gt; latter is a relationship between signals from one clock and
&gt; another clock. This way I don't need to worry about what local
&gt; coordinates to use. Blueshift of signals can be directly
&gt; measured by a single clock (+ detector); &quot;time dilation&quot;
&gt; cannot.
">

Time dilation CAN be measured here on Earth and IS measured here on Earth.
Red/Blue shift fits nicely into the snapshot of space/time that is modelled
by GR.  GR does not cope with gravitational time dilation because there is
no geodesic to consider - the clocks just sit around and tick.  Therefore GR
is an inadequate modelling tool when it comes to considering gravitational
time dilation, a phenomena *measurable here on Earth*.

Indeed, you have outlined several times the inadequacy of GR in this regard
which is why you prefer the red/blue shifted signals which can be modelled
with the General Relativistic snapshot-of-spacetime.  If I leave a clock for
half an hour on the moon and then bring it back to my space clock for
comparison GR is completely lost and has no way of modelling that component
of time dilation acquired while the clock was stationary on the surface of
the moon.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; time dilation is
&gt; &gt; already at maximum for a stationary Black Hole.  How is the additional
time
&gt; &gt; dilation caused by the motion of the Black Hole summed to its intrinsic
time
&gt; &gt; dilation?

&gt; This is overly simplistic -- &quot;time dilation&quot; is NOT an intrinsic
&gt; property of an object, it is a RELATIONSHIP between a clock and A
&gt; COORDINATE SYSTEM (not another clock).
">

It is not helpful to think of red/blue shift when the clock being considered
is frozen by all who measure it except those sharing exactly the same
inertial and gravitational frame.  Relative to a space observer, when one
second passes on a Black Hole clock an infinite amount of time passes on a
space based clock.  It is simpler to just declare the black hole clock
frozen.  This is not something that happens only when you draw a geodesic
across your spacetime diagram (so to speak).  It is a permanent condition.
In the life of the universe (assuming around 15 billion years) a clock in a
Black Hole of the same age has yet to accumulate one second, or even one
nanosecond.  I don't care if you don't like it or if you can't model it in
GR.  It is the way it is.  One could also note that a clock carried along by
a beam of light that has been in transit for the entire age of the universe
is also yet to accumulate a single nanosecond.

It is not an intrinsic property of the clocks or the frame, but of the
relative difference between two frames (as you say).  In the case of the
Black hole or the photon it is any other frame ie the clocks do not tick
relative to any other frame including any other Black Hole or photon - not
in the life of this universe.

&gt; distant approximately inertial coordinates in which the black hole is
&gt; moving uniformly, that locus will not be a sphere; moreover, the
&gt; difference in synchronization between these and the previous coordinates
&gt; imply that in this frame when one considers a locus with that same time
&gt; dilation but SIMULTANEOUS in these second coordinates, the locus is
&gt; deformed still more. Note that to consider &quot;time dilation&quot; due to motion
&gt; one must consider the simultaneity in the second coordinates. You have
&gt; not considered the effects of the difference in simultaneity between
&gt; these sets of coordinates -- that's one reason why &quot;time dilation&quot; is
&gt; not &quot;additive&quot; as you implicitly assume (other reasons are that other
&gt; components of the metric become important in such coordinates, and the
&gt; metric components are no longer independent of time).
">

Considering an SR model - rods and clocks - consider a rod moving away from
the observer.  Assume a regular signal emitted from the rod.  As the rod
moves away, each successive signal has further to travel, so the signal is
'red shifted'.  If the rod is massive, then gravitational time dilation
(measured here on Earth as being 45,900 nanoseconds at the height of a GPS
satellite as compared to a clock on the surface) means that the signal is
already redshifted before it is emitted.

Back to the 'light' rod, we note that the motion of the rod will cause time
dilation so that the signal will be time dilated (relative to the stationary
observer) at the time it is emitted.  So we have additive time dilation
between simple Doppler effect and relativistic time dilation (the two
together give us relativistic Doppler effect) and between gravitational time
dilation and simple Doppler effect.  What I am asking is how the
gravitational time dilation of a massive object is considered with the time
dilation of a rod in motion ie a massive object in motion.

You have explained that it isn't simple, but have not shown any examples of
the two forms of time dilation being resolved.  How red shifted would the
light emitted from an Earth sized planet travelling at .9c away from an
observer be relative to a near massless rod travelling at the same speed and
direction?

Sorry, I seemed to have gone way over your head.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Using this addition logic we come to Black Holes
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; where time dilation is already off the scale (or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; gamma etc etc - I am just using time dilation as
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; an example of relativistic changes).

&gt; &gt;&gt; It is not &quot;off the scale&quot;.  An infaller (that left from
&gt; &gt;&gt; infinity) will see the Universe distorted, Doppler
&gt; &gt;&gt; shifted due to his motion, but not &quot;infinitely blue
&gt; &gt;&gt; shifted&quot; as he crosses the event horizon.

&gt; &gt; Schwarzschild's calculation says that time dilation
&gt; &gt; is off the scale.

&gt; &gt; The Schwarzschild radius is r=2GM/c^2
&gt; &gt; Gravitational Time dilation is gamma=(1-2GM/c^2r)^.5

&gt; &gt; Thus we can substitute r in the gravitational time
&gt; &gt; dilation equation for 2GM/c^2 if the object is a
&gt; &gt; Black Hole we get gamma=(1-1)^.5=0  A gamma of
&gt; &gt; 1 indicates no time dilation.

&gt; The formula you cite describes what an external observer sees.
&gt; Since outbound light is &quot;stuck&quot; at the EH, any events that occur
&gt; there essentially never make it out into the Universe at large.
&gt; It has nothing to do with observers crossing the event horizon,
&gt; or &quot;time rate&quot; at the horizon.
&gt; http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/schw.shtml
">

If Black Holes can evaporate, which current theory says they can, then the
events inside a Black Hole can, in principle, be observed later on eg as
recorded by a clock.

Or are you saying that if we can't see it then it doesn't count?  The whole
of string theory deals with objects that can never be observed, even in
principle, so you must think then entire field is irrelevant?

The Schwarzschild radius is a formula for calculating the radius of a black
hole for any given mass or density of matter.  We are more or less inside a
Schwarzschild radius (if the universe is finite) or on the event horizon of
many (if the universe is infinite).

You seem to want to reject any or my ideas in favour of conventional wisdom,
even though you seem to have only a tenuous grasp on relativity.

There are several ways of looking at the outbound light.  One is to consider
that it is stuck.  But relative to a space observer a clock inside a Black
Hole's event horizon never ticks - it is frozen (relatively).  So light is
never emitted.

Time dilation seems to worry a lot of people.  When time stops (relatively)
at the black hole or the speed of light they want to deny that reality by
saying that you can't go that fast or 'who cares what happens inside a black
hole if light never escapes'.  The depth of this immaturity is boundless.
Thank goodness the likes of Feynman and Gellman never allowed such
boundaries to daunt them - when quarks were formulated they thought that
they could never be observed - by your measure they should have left them
alone.  Or perhaps it is OK to look at quarks as long as time dilation is
not involved?  Grow up.

Time dilation indicates relativistic changes - it is not the change per se.
It is merely convenient to consider one changeable parameter that is common
throughout the universe and across both GR and SR and Quantum Physics etc.
Wherever there is time dilation there is relativistic changes and these
always occur for a reason (except for the uniform expansion of space-time
and the creation of the universe in seven days by some bored bearded
vagrant).

You can't push a rope, you have to pull it.

Pushing implies a physical contact which would be rather dangerous.
There are not many ways to 'push' a black hole that I can imagine.

The only push I can think of is 'like charges repel'. So you would need to
pump a lot of electrons (or positrons) into the black hole and then bring a
similarly charged large (low mass) electrode near.

Charged body interactions, as with mass interactions are most simply
modeled as point objects containing all the mass or charge.

Perhaps 'expanding in any direction' is the result of 'center of the black

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Using this addition logic we come to Black Holes

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; an example of relativistic changes).

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It is not &quot;off the scale&quot;.  An infaller (that left from
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; infinity) will see the Universe distorted, Doppler
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; shifted due to his motion, but not &quot;infinitely blue
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; shifted&quot; as he crosses the event horizon.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Schwarzschild's calculation says that time dilation
&gt;&gt; &gt; is off the scale.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The Schwarzschild radius is r=2GM/c^2
&gt;&gt; &gt; Gravitational Time dilation is gamma=(1-2GM/c^2r)^.5

&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus we can substitute r in the gravitational time
&gt;&gt; &gt; dilation equation for 2GM/c^2 if the object is a
&gt;&gt; &gt; Black Hole we get gamma=(1-1)^.5=0  A gamma of
&gt;&gt; &gt; 1 indicates no time dilation.

&gt;&gt; The formula you cite describes what an external

I NEVER said anything like that at all. I merely point out that your

coordinate choice (or equivalent).

Please note: what is ACTUALLY MEASURED is a difference in elapsed proper
time for the two clocks, between a specified pair of events; in
particular, RATES are not compared. To make a claim about their rates
requires to to make ASSUMPTIONS about simultaneity between the two
clocks, and such assumptions can be made is many different ways, leading
to different answers.

There is no question about the difference in elapsed proper times; there
is great ambiguity about a putative difference in rates. &lt;shrug&gt;

Hmmm. In GR, which is the only theoretical context in which black holes
are well defined, they do not and cannot "evaporate". There is a
rigorous theorem in GR that the area of all event horizons cannot decrease.

There is a semi-classical (i.e. semi-quantum) theoretical context in
which Hawking radiation can cause a black hole to evaporate after a
rather enormous time. But this is not at all a complete theory, and we
have no idea whether or not your claim here is valid. Indeed, it seems
highly unlikely as the evaporation of a solar-mass black hole takes
billions of times longer than the current age of the universe.... It
could certainly be the case that by the time the black hole finally
evaporates, all objects formerly inside its horizon have already been
destroyed....

Completely wrong. GR is THE ONLY way we use to model this. And the model

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

This is not "inadequacy of GR", it is inadequacy OF YOUR
COORDINATE-DEPENDENT CLAIMS. As I have said before, by shifting to
red/blueshift I can avoid coordinate dependencies and make statements
about quantities that can be directly measured.

You must keep track of what is (or can be) measured by what apparatus: a
single clock (plus collocated detector) can measure the red/blue shift
of a signal from a distant source, as long as the emitted frequency is
known. That apparatus cannot measure "time dilation". Two clocks that
meet, separate, and meet again can measure their elapsed proper times
between meetings. That apparatus cannot measure "time dilation".

To measure "time dilation" inherently requires a set of SYNCHRONIZED
clocks at rest in a given coordinate system [#], and assistants
pre-positioned with them along the trajectory of the clock whose "time
dilation" is to be measured; the reports of the assistants must be
gathered AFTER the clock passes by, and its time dilation can then be
computed from their reports. A similar set-up is required to measure the
tick rate of a moving clock.

[#] In most cases this must be inertial to be useful. And, of
course, you must CHOOSE the method of clock synchronization.

NONE of your scenarios remotely resemble this latter situation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Again, this is completely false. Repeating falsehoods does not make them

No, not a pair of events (transportation of the clock to the massive body;
transportation of the clock from the massive body to the space based clock)
but three events - the previous two plus an interval where the clock on the
massive body is left on the massive body for some length of time.  If the
interval representing the period of transportation of the clock is small,
say 1 hour, and the interval in which the clock is on the surface is long,
say one year, then it is clear that the rate at which the space based clock
and the clock on the massive body run are quite different AT THE SAME TIME
ie simultaneously.  The establishment of simultaneity is your objection, but
you seem to ignore the extended period in which the clock is stationary on
the surface of the massive body.

You have argued against the concept of clocks running slower on the surface
of a massive body before.  Simply placing the onus on me to frame a thought
experiment in GR terms is denial of the obvious.  In the scenario I
outlined, the clock on the surface of the massive body MUST be running
slower relative to the space based clock.  If the interval in which the
clock is on the massive body is very small, then simultaneity may be an
issue, but if it is very large then it is clear that whilst the clock is on
the massive body it must be running slower (relative to the space based
clock).

I am not aware of different formulation arriving at different answers except
where the clock that it is transported to the surface of the massive body is
immediately transported back to the space based clock and the intervals
measured by the clocks compared.  Where the transported clock is left on the
surface of the massive body for, say, ten years, then only the standard
formula for gravitational time dilation can be applied - General Relativity
can not model such a thought experiment, which is a real experiment
performed many times here on Earth (but if GR can, then please outline the
method).

And then there is the Schwarzschild Black Hole - no need for anything to be

matter moved toward the event horizon then such a Black Hole would no longer
have sufficient mass to be a Black Hole and the matter could escape, say in
a low density Schwarzschild Radius of around the size of our visible
universe.

Destroying real clocks has never prevented them being sent to near the speed

Time dilation increases with the mass of the massive object.  Using this

A clock on the surface of a planet is not in motion relative to the space

establish the asynchrony between clocks let each clock emit a signal at 1s

1s and the Earth based observer will note that the signal from the space

Red/blueshift of a signal beamed from Earth to a space observer or visa
versa does not tell one which component of the signal is responsible for the
frequency shift ie it could be the curvature of space between emitter and
absorber or the slower/quicker clock at the emitter or the absorber.  To
measure gravitational time dilation we need to measure only the rate of the
clock at the surface and not the red/blueshift caused by curvature of space
between the emitter and absorber.  This can be done by emitting a pulse
train from the Earth bound clock.  As long as the space observer is not
moving relative to the Earth bound clock then the interval between pulses is
all that is needed to determine the time dilation - the curvature of space
between the two is irrelevant unless the curvature is so great that signals
are never received.

Simultaneity is not a required component of such measurement.  The clocks do
not have to be synchronised - they only need to be of the same type.

How does GR do with such simple scenarios.

&gt; &gt; As I said. the fact that the method you choose is simple,
&gt; &gt; straightforward, and common, in no way implies you did not need to
&gt; &gt; select it in order to make your claim.

&gt; The method is simple and has been oft repeated by me (again below)

&gt; &gt; &gt; You don't like the idea that clocks can accumulate asynchrony eg two
&gt; clocks
&gt; &gt; &gt; placed on the moon and in one space.

&gt; &gt; I NEVER said anything like that at all. I merely point out that your
&gt; &gt; claims about clocks &quot;ticking at different rates&quot; are not independent of
&gt; &gt; coordinate choice (or equivalent).

&gt; &gt; Please note: what is ACTUALLY MEASURED is a difference in elapsed proper
&gt; &gt; time for the two clocks, between a specified pair of events; in
&gt; &gt; particular, RATES are not compared. To make a claim about their rates
&gt; &gt; requires to to make ASSUMPTIONS about simultaneity between the two
&gt; &gt; clocks, and such assumptions can be made is many different ways, leading
&gt; &gt; to different answers.

&gt; No, not a pair of events (transportation of the clock to the massive body;
&gt; transportation of the clock from the massive body to the space based
clock)
&gt; but three events - the previous two plus an interval where the clock on
the
&gt; massive body is left on the massive body for some length of time.  If the
&gt; interval representing the period of transportation of the clock is small,
&gt; say 1 hour, and the interval in which the clock is on the surface is long,
&gt; say one year, then it is clear that the rate at which the space based
clock
&gt; and the clock on the massive body run are quite different AT THE SAME TIME
&gt; ie simultaneously.  The establishment of simultaneity is your objection,
but
&gt; you seem to ignore the extended period in which the clock is stationary on
&gt; the surface of the massive body.

&gt; &gt; There is no question about the difference in elapsed proper times; there
&gt; &gt; is great ambiguity about a putative difference in rates. &lt;shrug&gt;

&gt; You have argued against the concept of clocks running slower on the
surface
&gt; of a massive body before.  Simply placing the onus on me to frame a
thought
&gt; experiment in GR terms is denial of the obvious.  In the scenario I
&gt; outlined, the clock on the surface of the massive body MUST be running
&gt; slower relative to the space based clock.  If the interval in which the
&gt; clock is on the massive body is very small, then simultaneity may be an
&gt; issue, but if it is very large then it is clear that whilst the clock is
on
&gt; the massive body it must be running slower (relative to the space based
&gt; clock).

&gt; I am not aware of different formulation arriving at different answers
except
&gt; where the clock that it is transported to the surface of the massive body
is
&gt; immediately transported back to the space based clock and the intervals
&gt; measured by the clocks compared.  Where the transported clock is left on
the
&gt; surface of the massive body for, say, ten years, then only the standard
&gt; formula for gravitational time dilation can be applied - General
Relativity
&gt; can not model such a thought experiment, which is a real experiment
&gt; performed many times here on Earth (but if GR can, then please outline the
&gt; method).

&gt; &gt; &gt; Black Holes can evaporate, therefore clocks that were inside the event
&gt; &gt; &gt; horizon can, in principle, be compared to space based clocks.

&gt; &gt; Hmmm. In GR, which is the only theoretical context in which black holes
&gt; &gt; are well defined, they do not and cannot &quot;evaporate&quot;. There is a
&gt; &gt; rigorous theorem in GR that the area of all event horizons cannot
&gt; decrease.

&gt; &gt; There is a semi-classical (i.e. semi-quantum) theoretical context in
&gt; &gt; which Hawking radiation can cause a black hole to evaporate after a
&gt; &gt; rather enormous time. But this is not at all a complete theory, and we
&gt; &gt; have no idea whether or not your claim here is valid. Indeed, it seems
&gt; &gt; highly unlikely as the evaporation of a solar-mass black hole takes
&gt; &gt; billions of times longer than the current age of the universe.... It
&gt; &gt; could certainly be the case that by the time the black hole finally
&gt; &gt; evaporates, all objects formerly inside its horizon have already been
&gt; &gt; destroyed....

&gt; And then there is the Schwarzschild Black Hole - no need for anything to
be
&gt; destroyed, and matter can escape such a Black Hole eg if a large body of
&gt; matter moved toward the event horizon then such a Black Hole would no
longer
&gt; have sufficient mass to be a Black Hole and the matter could escape, say
in
&gt; a low density Schwarzschild Radius of around the size of our visible
&gt; universe.

&gt; Destroying real clocks has never prevented them being sent to near the
speed
&gt; of light or into hot suns or whatever, so I don't think that is a valid
&gt; argument with respect to thought experiments.  Einstein's clocks would
have
&gt; been destroyed many times over, but that certainly did not prevent him.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Time dilation CAN be measured here on Earth and IS measured here on
&gt; Earth.

&gt; &gt; Sure. But not inside a black hole. &lt;shrug&gt;

&gt; Time dilation increases with the mass of the massive object.  Using this
&gt; formula, simple gravitational time dilation, we find that a clock should
&gt; stop in a Black Hole, whether that BH is formed by a collapsing star and
has
&gt; a singularity at its centre or whether the BH is a Schwarzschild radius
and
&gt; contains galaxies that in turn contain habitable planets.

&gt; &gt; &gt; GR does not cope with gravitational time dilation

&gt; &gt; Nonsense. Indeed, GR is the only sensible way we have of discussing it.

&gt; What is the GR formulation for calculating the difference in rate of a
clock
&gt; on the surface of the Earth compared to one at the height of GPS
satellite?
&gt; Note that the Earth based atomic clocks are never transported into space.
&gt; How would you establish simultaneity for such a calculation?

&gt; &gt; &gt; because there is
&gt; &gt; &gt; no geodesic to consider - the clocks just sit around and tick.

&gt; &gt; GR has no limitation to geodesics, and can compute elapsed proper times
&gt; &gt; for clocks in any sort of motion that is allowable (i.e. timelike
&gt; &gt; trajectories).

&gt; A clock on the surface of a planet is not in motion relative to the space
&gt; based clock with which we are making our comparisons.  No motion, no GR?
To
&gt; establish the asynchrony between clocks let each clock emit a signal at 1s
&gt; intervals.  The space based clock observer will note that the signals
&gt; arriving from the Earth bound clock are received at intervals of less than
&gt; 1s and the Earth based observer will note that the signal from the space
&gt; based clock arrive at less than 1s intervals.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed, you have outlined several times the inadequacy of GR in this
&gt; regard
&gt; &gt; &gt; which is why you prefer the red/blue shifted signals

&gt; &gt; This is not &quot;inadequacy of GR&quot;, it is inadequacy OF YOUR
&gt; &gt; COORDINATE-DEPENDENT CLAIMS. As I have said before, by shifting to
&gt; &gt; red/blueshift I can avoid coordinate dependencies and make statements
&gt; &gt; about quantities that can be directly measured.

&gt; Red/blueshift of a signal beamed from Earth to a space observer or visa
&gt; versa does not tell one which component of the signal is responsible for
the
&gt; frequency shift ie it could be the curvature of space between emitter and
&gt; absorber or the slower/quicker clock at the emitter or the absorber.  To
&gt; measure gravitational time dilation we need to measure only the rate of
the
&gt; clock at the surface and not the red/blueshift caused by curvature of
space
&gt; between the emitter and absorber.  This can be done by emitting a pulse
&gt; train from the Earth bound clock.  As long as the space observer is not
&gt; moving relative to the Earth bound clock then the interval between pulses
is
&gt; all that is needed to determine the time dilation - the curvature of space
&gt; between the two is irrelevant unless the curvature is so great that
signals
&gt; are never received.

&gt; Simultaneity is not a required component of such measurement.  The clocks
do
&gt; not have to be synchronised - they only need to be of the same type.

&gt; How does GR do with such simple scenarios.

&gt; &gt; You must keep track of what is (or can be) measured by what apparatus: a
&gt; &gt; single clock (plus collocated detector) can measure the red/blue shift
&gt; &gt; of a signal from a distant source, as long as the emitted frequency is
&gt; &gt; known. That apparatus cannot measure &quot;time dilation&quot;. Two clocks that
&gt; &gt; meet, separate, and meet again can measure their elapsed proper times
&gt; &gt; between meetings. That apparatus cannot measure &quot;time dilation&quot;.

&gt; &gt; To measure &quot;time dilation&quot; inherently requires a set of SYNCHRONIZED
&gt; &gt; clocks at rest in a given coordinate system [#], and assistants
&gt; &gt; pre-positioned with them along the trajectory of the clock whose &quot;time
&gt; &gt; dilation&quot; is to be measured; the reports of the assistants must be
&gt; &gt; gathered AFTER the clock passes by, and its time dilation can then be
&gt; &gt; computed from their reports. A similar set-up is required to

&gt; &gt; Now we take the Black Hole.  It deforms the sheet so much that it does

&gt; &gt; This is because the sides of the

&gt; Incorrect. The sides approach 'vertical' as they approach the Schwarzchild

&gt; Neither mass, inertia, charge, nor angular momentum are lost when an
object

&gt; &gt; So when an object passes by the

&gt; &gt; sheet, but it does not move in the direction of the massive object
&gt; &gt; passing by - not one millimetre, even if the other object was also a
&gt; &gt; black hole.

&gt; Your model is broken.
">

Why?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; The steepness of the sheet, or of spacetime near a Black Hole, is often
&gt; &gt; given as an analogue of GR.  Here is a more classical reason to consider
&gt; &gt; the stationary status of the Black Hole.  As time dilation is infinite
&gt; &gt; on the Surface (or equivalent for Black Holes) of the Black Hole is
&gt; &gt; infinite/zero (infinite interval between events, frequency of events is
&gt; &gt; zero relative to any clock not in the same inertial frame) it takes an
&gt; &gt; infinite amount of time for the Black Hole to move toward a passing
&gt; &gt; massive object.

&gt; Demonstrably incorrect. The black hole at the center of our galaxy did NOT
&gt; stop its motion when it formed.
">

Stop with respect to what?  Inertial motion is a relative quantity, not an
absolute.  If an object deforms space as much as a Black Hole does then
everything else is in motion relative to it just as light is at c relative
to any inertial frame.  Note that the object that emits light is not
stationary with respect to the photon as judged by some other frame even
though the light emitted darts off at c.

As there is no absolute frame, then there can be more than one stationary
point relative to other frames just as there can be more than one direction
of the speed of light relative to other frames.  Now we say that the speed
of light is c from any frame, but we also note that two photons can be
moving in opposite directions which gives us a total of 2*c.  Well, if we do
the math for two objects near the speed of light moving in opposite
directions we find that the speeds don't add up trivially and that the speed
of one object as measured from the other is never more than c, and so, by
extension, we can speculate that even from a photon frame we would never
measure the speed of a photon travelling in the opposite direction as
greater than c.

Now we consider the Black Hole.  From  a near Black Hole (just requiring
that teaspoon full of matter you mentioned earlier) every bit of matter in
space as viewed from this frame appears to be moving at just below the speed
of light.  As the object (say, a neutron star) is spherical, we can observe
moving objects in any direction.  We note that the direction of the fast
moving space objects rules out all but a tiny motion for the neutron star.
That is because there is no way that any of the observed objects could be
stationary with respect to the neutron star.  This apparent motion is caused
by the time dilation of the observer on the Neutron star.  Note that due to
the mass of the neutron star there will be a lot of matter heading straight
for it.  How can you count yourself moving with respect to all of that
infalling matter?  The greater the time dilation of the surface observer the
greater the speed and volume of the infalling matter.

For the Black Hole, (a Schwarzschild variety, where habitable planets can
survive :) the infall would be at the speed of light.  If you were in the
centre of such a Schwarzschild radius you would note the speed of objects to
be moving toward you at ever greater speed with distance, like the observed
red shift of our universe but in reverse.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; As for absolute spatial coordinates - a lack of absolute spatial
&gt; &gt; coordinates never stopped a photon from passing an observer at the speed
&gt; &gt; of light.

&gt; Correct.

&gt; &gt; The same argument can be made for the Black Hole.

&gt; If you do, you proceed contrary to evidence.
">

'Stationary' is a relative thing.  One may note that two Black Holes may be
moving with respect to each other in the same way that two photons appear to
be moving away from each other at 2c.  But we know that nothing moves at
greater than c relative to any inertial frame.  Note that if you get close
enough to a Black Hole you will find that you are moving at the speed of
light relative to it and any other Black Hole you can see.

Yes, Black holes seem to be moving relative to each other.  Yes, a photon
may appear to be travelling at up to 2*c relative to another photon.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; The black
&gt; &gt; hole is not stationary relative to some absolute spatial coordinate, but
&gt; &gt; is stationary relative to whatever frame you care to measure it from
&gt; &gt; (just as the speed of light is c as measured from any inertial frame).

&gt; Stop and think. That means that nothing can ever approach a black hole.
">

Huh??  It means that *everything* is moving relative to a Black hole!!!

Nothing can approach the speed of light.  The Black Hole phenomena is
opposite - nothing can escape it.

If you measure something as stationary then it means that you must be
moving.  I did not say that a Black Hole shares everyone else's frame -
quite the opposite.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I can not move toward something that has zero relative velocity with
&gt; respect to me. If I take a step in its direction, it MUST 'take a step
away
&gt; from me' because it MUST maintain zero relative velocity WRT me at all
&gt; times.

&gt; Do you see why your concept is not tenable?
">

Sorry, I obviously didn't make myself clear previously.  When there is a
differential speed between two frames, yours and someone else's, you can
always count yourself as stationary and the other as moving and do all your
relativistic calculations from that perspective.  Or you could choose to
count the other frame as stationary and yours as the moving frame (so your
clocks are running slower rather than their clocks).

We do not have this freedom when considering a photon - we can not count the
photon as stationary and our frame as the one moving at the speed of light.
For all other motion we do have that freedom.

Now, what I am saying is that there is another limitation - the Black Hole.
Sure we can count our frame as the one that is moving and the Black Hole as
stationary, but what I am saying is that we do not have the freedom to
assume the reverse ie that the Black Hole is moving and that we are
stationary with respect to it.

The same is true from any third person observer - the Black Hole must always
be the stationary frame relative to the other frame observer.  We do the
same with the speed of light - the speed of light is always in motion and
the other frame relatively stationary with respect to it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; But you raise an interesting point.  If the universe were infinite then
&gt; &gt; at any point in the universe you would be on the event horizon of a
&gt; &gt; Schwarzschild radius.  Consider any direction you like (pretending, for
&gt; &gt; a moment, that our universe is infinite).  The matter in the direction
&gt; &gt; you are looking will form a Schwarzschild Black Hole with a centre at
&gt; &gt; distance r=(3c^2/8Gdpi)^.5  Thus the more dense the matter in that
&gt; &gt; direction the shorter the distance to the centre (of the BH).  But this
&gt; &gt; is going to be true in any direction you care to look - you'll see a
&gt; &gt; Schwarzschild Back Hole.

&gt; &gt; Now consider what you see from the event horizon of a low density
&gt; &gt; Schwarzschild Black Hole when you look from the event horizon toward the
&gt; &gt; centre.  We know that time dilation increases as you get closer to the
&gt; &gt; black hole centre.  So light will be progressively more redshifted.

&gt; &gt; Now, in an infinite universe there is a Schwarzschild radius in whatever
&gt; &gt; direction you look so light will be red shifted with greater distance in
&gt; &gt; any direction you care to look.  Say, isn't that EXACTLY what we see in
&gt; &gt; our universe?  Must be a coincidence?

&gt; Maybe not.

&gt; &gt; Note that a General Relativistic modelling of the above would show that
&gt; &gt; space is expanding in any direction you look (just as space expands as
&gt; &gt; you look from the event horizon toward the centre of a Black Hole of any
&gt; &gt; kind). Say, isn't that EXACTLY what we see in our universe?  Must be a
&gt; &gt; coincidence?

&gt; Perhaps 'expanding in any direction' is the result of 'center of the black
&gt; hole is in any direction'. It doesn't much matter as the 'black hole we
are
&gt; at the center of' is the light radius of the visable universe that we see.
">

I think you'll find that we are not at the centre of a Black Hole.  Rather,
we are at the event horizon of a Black Hole in any direction.  In an
infinite universe the bulk of matter is going to be away from the observer
in any direction.  In a finite universe you are within the bulk of matter.
Thus in an infinite universe an inverted Schwarzschild radius forms.  From
the centre of a regular low density Schwarzschild radius you would note an
increased blue shift with distance and matter would appear to be approaching
one (infilling) at ever greater speed with distance.

But if the bulk of the mass is far away, as with an infinite universe, the
Schwarzschild radius is effectively inverted so that the event horizon
becomes a point and the centre becomes a shell.  That's slightly weird, but
nothing as weird as "the universe was the size of a pea after starting from
a quantum fluctuation and then, for no reason, inflated etc" or "And on the
seventh day he rested".

Messages can get awfully long.  The reply is contextual ie the next one in
the thread.  Others can always look back to the previous message.  But for
short ones like this message there is no problem in keeping it all :)

Yes, the only way I can think of moving a Black Hole is to poke a massive
object in front of it (relative to the direction you want the Black Hole to
move) and hope that it will follow.  I don't think this would happen.  I
think the Black Hole would stay put.

Let's consider the quantum angle - any boson of gravity would have to move
at greater than the speed of light to communicate force between the two
objects.

Thus I don't think you can accelerate a Black Hole.  Whilst you may consider
the Black Hole to be moving, when you get up close it will appear to be
stationary.  The phenomena must be similar to that of light.  Whilst I
measure the speed of light to be c, by accelerating to 0.99c I find that
light is still darting off at c!!  As you get close to a Black Hole,
everything seems to be moving at close to the speed of light relative to the
Black Hole (including the observer - you just can't slow down!!).  Thus you
would have to conclude that it is the Black Hole that is most likely to be
stationary with respect to these rapidly moving objects.

The other thing to consider is the collision of a star size object with a
Black Hole.  One would think that the momentum of the star would knock the
Black Hole along.  But all infalling matter reaches the speed of light, so
the momentum that the star had before it reaches the event horizon counts
for nothing.  Indeed, I would speculate that excess momentum that any object
has as it falls toward the event horizon is radiated off as energy.

The basic Black Hole can be calculated directly from Gravitational Time

Schwarzschild was the first to solve Einstein's field equations for a
non-rotating body, and the Schwarzschild radius can be derived from those
equations.  I hardly think that that is a coincidence...

The second equation merely established the radius for any given density of
matter.

Of course those equations are valid - the whole debate over 'closed' or
'open' universe can be expressed in the equation - if the density of the
universe is known one can calculate the size that the universe must be in
order to be closed ie a closed universe IS a Schwarzschild Black Hole,
though you obviously didn't know that...

The debate over the closed-open universe has now been decided in favour of
an open universe as the rate of expansion is accelerating.  By coincidence,
if the universe was infinite then we would be looking into a Schwarzschild
radius in every direction - the apparent 'expansion' would be accelerating
in that model as well - another amazing coincidence!!! (and no need for
made-up concepts such as cold dark matter and dark energy and whatever else

That is relevant only in a historical context. The only relativity
theories used are the ones published in 1905 [SR] and 1916 [GR]. His
previous attempts at understanding gravity are not relevant in the
21st century as anything other than teaching examples.

Black holes were never named as such until John Wheeler in the 1960s,
and the physical concept applied to relativity was not investigated
until 1928 or so by Oppenheimer.

Minkowski gave special relativity its' metric formulation in 1907. It
was not and is not a theory of gravitation. Learn before you spew.

Why? GR reduces to Newtonian gravity in the limit of weak fields.

It is impossible for a timelike path to pass beyond the event horizon
of a Schwarzschild black hole [I'm ignoring complexities introduced by
rotating/charged black holes]. In classical mechanics, a particle that
is accelerating hard enough can escape the black hole.

Regardless of what you think, it is a coincidence - nothing more.

That supposition loses your earlier assertion that the black hole represented
an object with zero motion wrt the univers around it AND is logically
unsupportable.

Let us suppose that we consider the black holes [nonexistant] iFoR to be
congruent with that FoR based upon the black holes center of gravity.

Let us consider any other iFoR that is in motion wrt the BHiFoR.
You will have to show that ANY such iFoR can not exist in order to support
your original supposition. But there is no reason to suppose that any iFoR
has special properties (in the absence of a BH). How does centering an iFoR
upon the center of a BH suddenly invalidiate ALL other iFoR's in the
universe?

The amount of spatial curvature involved when considering your car analogies
is negligible.

When a massive object moves through space it distorts space in a particular
way relative to the motion of the observer ie if the observer is commoving
then spatial curvature around the object must be symmetrical.  If the
observer is moving at great speed or the massive object observed is moving
at great speed then we would expect to measure a different curvature at the
leading edge as compared to the lagging edge of the object.

This breaks down when the curvature involves the speed of light ie that
object will be accelerated to the speed of light as they pass over the event
horizon.  This represents maximum curvature.  So the leading and lagging
edges are always symmetrical.  An observer, therefore, will always conclude,
based on that evidence, that the Black Hole must be stationary.  This may be
contradicted by evidence that a distant Black Hole appears to be moving with
respect to the locally observed Black Hole.

Similar contradictions are found and resolved in SR with regard to light
speed, so I don't see them as an insurmountable problem.

In your car analogy, there is the equivalent of absolute space given by the
road you and the other car are on.  Both you and the other car must be
moving - you can not easily choose to consider yourself to be stationary and
the road to be moving as is the case in a space based thought experiment.

If you were observing a Neutron star coming toward you and it turned into a
Black Hole, then all of your calculations and observations would lead you to
conclude that the Black Hole is stationary and that you must be the one that
is moving.

You seem to be assuming that the Black Hole must stop relative to some
absolute frame, which is not what I am claiming (though I may not have made
that clear in earlier messages).  Light always travels at c, which implies
an absolute frame that light must be travelling at c with respect to.  But
light only travels at c relative to any inertial frame, not with respect to
some absolute frame.  The BH is the same (as I am proposing) in that any
observer would conclude that a Black Hole must be stationary with respect to
them.  But this, paradoxically, is the same for any observer regardless of
their inertial frame.

Note that the main thrust of your objection could also be made about the
assertion that light travels at c with regard to any inertial frame - one
can merely point to the universe and ask how a beam of light could possibly
be travelling at c relative to all those other objects.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Black Holes were first proposed in the 19th century and have been
&gt; &gt; formulated
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without GR eg the Schwarzschild Radius is calculated by the simple
&gt; &gt; formula:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; r=2Gm/c^2=(3c^2/8Gdpi)^.5 (for a given mass or a given density)

&gt; &gt; &gt; A coincidence - assuming that second equation has any meaning
&gt; &gt; &gt; whatsoever. The 20th century concept of the black hole is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; relativistic concept. Nonrelativistic treatments are unviable and will
&gt; &gt; &gt; be mocked as such.

&gt; &gt; The basic Black Hole can be calculated directly from Gravitational Time
&gt; &gt; Dilation.  Einstein came up with this concept nearly a decade ahead of
&gt; &gt; General Relativity, in 1907 when he was first considering accelerating
&gt; &gt; frames.

&gt; That is relevant only in a historical context. The only relativity
&gt; theories used are the ones published in 1905 [SR] and 1916 [GR]. His
&gt; previous attempts at understanding gravity are not relevant in the
&gt; 21st century as anything other than teaching examples.

Minkowski's ideas are still very much in use.  Non-Reimann space-time, the
'light cone', 'space-time contuum', 'world line', 'spacelike vector',
'timelike vector' and other terms and concepts are all down to Minkowski
(published in 1908).

&gt; Black holes were never named as such until John Wheeler in the 1960s,
&gt; and the physical concept applied to relativity was not investigated

&gt; Minkowski gave special relativity its' metric formulation in 1907. It
&gt; was not and is not a theory of gravitation. Learn before you spew.

&gt; &gt; Schwarzschild was the first to solve Einstein's field equations for a
&gt; &gt; non-rotating body, and the Schwarzschild radius can be derived from
those
&gt; &gt; equations.  I hardly think that that is a coincidence...

&gt; Why? GR reduces to Newtonian gravity in the limit of weak fields.

&gt; It is impossible for a timelike path to pass beyond the event horizon
&gt; of a Schwarzschild black hole [I'm ignoring complexities introduced by
&gt; rotating/charged black holes]. In classical mechanics, a particle that
&gt; is accelerating hard enough can escape the black hole.

&gt; Regardless of what you think, it is a coincidence - nothing more.

&gt; &gt; The second equation merely established the radius for any given density
of
&gt; &gt; matter.

&gt; ...which is wrong. Classical calculations are worthless when
&gt; discussing strong fields.

&gt; &gt; Of course those equations are valid - the whole debate over 'closed' or
&gt; &gt; 'open' universe can be expressed in the equation - if the density of the
&gt; &gt; universe is known one can calculate the size that the universe must be
in
&gt; &gt; order to be closed ie a closed universe IS a Schwarzschild Black Hole,
&gt; &gt; though you obviously didn't know that...

&gt; I know about it, but what I don't know is why classical calculations
&gt; have any bearing on general relativity in strong fields.

&gt; &gt; The debate over the closed-open universe has now been decided in favour
of
&gt; &gt; an open universe as the rate of expansion is accelerating.  By
coincidence,
&gt; &gt; if the universe was infinite then we would be looking into a
Schwarzschild
&gt; &gt; radius in every direction - the apparent 'expansion' would be
accelerating
&gt; &gt; in that model as well - another amazing coincidence!!! (and no need for
&gt; &gt; made-up concepts such as cold dark matter and dark energy and whatever
else
&gt; &gt; has to be dreamt up to make GR fit the preconceived notion of an
immaculate
&gt; &gt; conception of the universe).

&gt; Aww, argument from ignorance...how cute.

&gt; The lambda-CDM model with 6 parameters which incorporates dark matter
&gt; and dark energy is a very good fit to WMAP and Sloan sky survery data.
&gt; Isn't that odd?
">

It's shoehorned in.  Next year we'll have new CMBR satellites and better
space telescopes are on the way.

But considering the data already available and the power of super computers,
it is only a question of trial and error to find a formulation that fits
data.  Cosmological models have, in general, performed poorly as predictive
tool eg the expansion of the universe is accelerating against all
prediction, the ripples in the CMBR were less than one thousandth of the
nearest prediction (at the time of the COBE satellite), and no doubt models
will have to be adjusted to fit the new data that will emerge in the next
few years - maybe they will have to invent some more mystical forces to help
models fit data.

It is interesting that Lambda CDM is getting the fine details of the theory
right when the basic assumption, the occurrence of a Big Bang and the
radiation of the CMBR shortly after, is now in doubt.

The data from the weak lens effect is still controversial - there is still
the question of why there is dark matter haloes without galaxies and
galaxies without dark matter haloes, or even if such anomalies actually

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I suppose one could claim that all calculations involving gravity
fall

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the realm General Relativity.  But a Black Hole can be modelled in
three

that

various
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; altitudes etc.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Salad O' words. Nothing you said has any real meaning.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Minkowski modelled gravity in his formulation using special
relativity
&gt; &gt; only.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You are confused. Special relativity is explicitly non-gravitational.

&gt; &gt; Then General Relativity must have been invented by Minkowski, who
modeled
&gt; &gt; spacetime that in turn included gravity.

&gt; Must have? Interesting.

&gt; Einstein is credited with the development of the field equations with
&gt; assistance from Hilbert and Minkowski.

&gt; &gt; All the text books say that Einstein came up with GR in 1915-16.  So
what do
&gt; &gt; we call his gravitational theory which began in 1907 with the
realisation of
&gt; &gt; gravitational time dilation??  And *I* am confused?  Perhaps history is
&gt; &gt; confused - be sure to have a hand in its revision so that it may better
&gt; &gt; comply with your preconseption of it...

&gt; Minkowski gave special relativity its' metric formulation in 1907. It
&gt; was not and is not a theory of gravitation. Learn before you spew.

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This was years before General Relativity.  Schwarzschild's radius
&gt; &gt; appears to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be an extension of Special relativity - I don't see how you would
work
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; backward from GR to Schwarzschild's calculation, though feel free to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enlighten me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Crack open a textbook on relativity rather than spewing nonsense in
&gt; &gt; &gt; both question and statement form.

&gt; &gt; I suggest you do the same - look up 'Minkowski' and 'Gravitational time'
&gt; &gt; dilation, both of which came into the picture well before General
&gt; &gt; Relativity.

&gt; Minkowski gave special relativity its' metric formulation in 1907. It

&gt; Then you should be able to either produce the derivation or a resource

Since you like quoting Wikipedia you won't mind me following suit:-
In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild obtained an exact solution to Einstein's field
equations for the gravitational field outside a non-rotating, spherically
symmetric body (see Schwarzschild metric). The solution contained a term of
the form 1 / (2M ? r); the value of r making this term singular has come to
be known as the Schwarzschild radius. The physical significance of this
singularity, and whether this singularity could ever occur in nature, was
debated for many decades, and a general acceptance of the possibility of a
black hole did not occur until after World War II.

your sweeping statements regarding SR and GR turn out to be your opinions
and do not gel with the historical facts.

Speaking of history, traditionally it is the kooks who make sweeping
generalisations and the scientists who point to specific facts.  You have

Dark energy is an example of shoehorning - the only evidence for Dark Energy
is that without it, the Lambda CDM model wouldn't be within a bulls roar of
the observed universe.  As Dark Energy has never been detected and can not
be replicated in the laboratory, one can say whatever one likes about it.
Indeed, if someone comes up with a model of the universe and it fails by a
factor of 10^120, as the closest model did when the expansion of the
universe was discovered to be accelerating, you can just make some dark
stuff and mould that into your model until it all fits together.

Please, you don't seriously think the Lambda CDM will last more than a few
years, do you??  You can't just go around making up theories of Dark Matter
and Energy and expect the entire science community to swallow it forever
without checking to see if there is any validity in these made up ideas??

Dark matter has not been detected, as many advocates are claiming.  IF Dark
Matter exists then we would expect to see certain things, some of which have
and some of which haven't been detected - the jury is still very much out
and non-dark matter models of galaxy rotation (for instance) are still being
published.

Lambda CDM may seem solid to younger science watchers who have seen nothing
but the Lambda CDM model, but to those of us who didn't come down in the
last shower we have seen many of these 'solid' models come and go, and there
is no reason to think that this one will last any longer than any other.
For instance how long did Guth's version of inflation last?  Not long.  But
no-one seems to mention that.  Indeed it took Linde's reformulation to get
it off the ground at all.

As long as you have a made-up entity called dark energy which, as it can't

assigns are those which will make the model fit the data.  Thus I am
underwhelmed by the fit.

In the old days, tribal people and later, religionists, made up histories of

Another wild generalisation.  Historically, new data such as the failure to
detect the decay of protons or the unforseen low amplitude of the ripples in
the CMBR or the accelerating expansion of the universe have seen one model
of the Big Bang superseded by an array of contenders from which one or two
take centre stage until the next contradictory data set.  Having seen
cosmological models come and go over the past thirty years had led me to
expect, by experience, that that process is far from ended and that further
models will emerge when newer data sets disagree with current models.

But you seem to think that this process has suddenly ended.  You may well be
right - Lambda CDM may well be the final model (with adjustments and
perfections into the future, of course), and Dark Matter and Dark Energy may
well be just as currently predicted.  That part you can see, as can I, and
we concur that the Lambda CDM model could be the one.  But equally, the
model may collapse in a heap tomorrow, as so many have done before.  This I
have seen numerous times and can see no reason why the Lambda CDM model is
immune from such a sticky end.  But you can not see it at all.  Indeed, you
seem to be insulted by the very idea that anyone would question it and so
assume that they could not possibly have understood the model for if they
did they would agree with you.

Let's wait and see.  I hope, for your sake, that the Lambda CDM model does
well.

That's two mysteries, the lensing and shadow effect, which will be resolved
next year with the new CMBR satellite.  And no, one or two mysteries do not
destroy a model as large, complex and elaborate as Lambda CDM and I'm sorry
if I gave you that impression.  What I am pointing out is that the Lambda
CDM model is not a done deal as you seem to imply - there are still issues
to resolve (such as the ones I have raised), observations to be made,
experiments to be done, new data on the way.  To think that the Lambda CDM
model is necessarily going to continue to perform well is very naive - sure
you can hope that it does, even have faith that it will, but understand that
it may also fail and an alternative formulation may take its place.  This is
happened before and I doubt that we have seen the last change of model.

&gt; &gt; is no reason to think that this one will last any longer than any other.
&gt; &gt; For instance how long did Guth's version of inflation last?  Not long.  But
&gt; &gt; no-one seems to mention that.  Indeed it took Linde's reformulation to get
&gt; &gt; it off the ground at all.

&gt; http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr2/map_bibliography.cfm

&gt; Why don't you have at it, since you are so goddamn sure?
&gt; Or, better yet, why not read the paper which explains why the L-CDM
&gt; model is accepted?

&gt; http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr2/pub_papers/threeyear/para ...

&gt; Oh, no. That would be too hard - it is much easier for you to sit back
&gt; and blather about stuff you know nothing about like the inflationary
&gt; model for cosmology. It is the DOMINANT explanation for the large
&gt; scale isotropy of the CMBR and is a central idea in the L-CDM model.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But considering the data already available and the power of super
&gt; &gt; computers,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is only a question of trial and error to find a formulation that fits
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; data.  Cosmological models have, in general, performed poorly as
&gt; &gt; predictive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tool eg the expansion of the universe is accelerating against all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prediction, the ripples in the CMBR were less than one thousandth of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nearest prediction (at the time of the COBE satellite), and no doubt
&gt; &gt; models
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will have to be adjusted to fit the new data that will emerge in the
&gt; &gt; next
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; few years - maybe they will have to invent some more mystical forces to
&gt; &gt; help
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; models fit data.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll say it in caps because you aren't quite &quot;getting it&quot;: THE MODEL
&gt; &gt; &gt; IS A SIX PARAMETER FIT FOR THE ENTIRE LARGE SCALE STRUCTURE OF THE
&gt; &gt; &gt; WHOLE GODDAMN UNIVERSE.

&gt; &gt; As long as you have a made-up entity called dark energy which, as it can't
&gt; &gt; be detected, can be assigned any properties one wants.  The properties one
&gt; &gt; assigns are those which will make the model fit the data.  Thus I am
&gt; &gt; underwhelmed by the fit.

&gt; You haven't even looked at the implications for cosmology paper which
&gt; put severe constrains on the allowable dark energy density and
&gt; observations that put constraints on its' equation of state.

&gt; Small wonder you are underwhelmed - you don't even know the basiscs.

&gt; &gt; In the old days, tribal people and later, religionists, made up histories of
&gt; &gt; the universe and theories about just about everything else.  They made their
&gt; &gt; models fit by inventing an unseen realm to which they could assign whatever
&gt; &gt; properties they needed to make their model fit the data.  These darker
&gt; &gt; realms have entered science in the form of dark energy.  Should we give
&gt; &gt; credit to the middle ages view that stars and planets are pushed around the
&gt; &gt; sky by unseen angels?  It is no less credible, or testable, than the made up
&gt; &gt; Dark Energy theory.

&gt; Oh yes, cosmology is JUST LIKE RELIGION.

&gt; Remind me, when was the last time the Vatican sent up a probe to see
&gt; if their theory of God matches observation?

&gt; &gt; At the very least we should be calling the model a hypothesis and point out
&gt; &gt; that it is extremely tentative.  You are trying to sell it as if it is a
&gt; &gt; done and dusted model that is tested and proved accurate.  It is not.

&gt; It is called what it is - a model. It is _NOT_ tentative and I NEVER
&gt; said it is the final model or that it is the best model there can be -
&gt; it is simply the best model we have ever had.

&gt; &gt; I suppose you are a strong supporter of supersymmetry and string theory as
&gt; &gt; well - sorry, I just don't have your faith.  Perhaps I should learn to pray
&gt; &gt; more?

&gt; Perhaps you should get an education so you don't stupidly compare two
&gt; theories that don't make testable predictions with a model of
&gt; cosmology that is empirically supported by many years of observational
&gt; data.

&gt; &gt; &gt; At any rate I don't even know why the hell you are referencing COBE
&gt; &gt; &gt; when WMAP is measuring differences in the background that are of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; order of microkelvins. COBE was 20 years ago. Get with the times.

&gt; &gt; COBE destroyed a range of models that failed to predict the amplitude of the
&gt; &gt; ripples to within three orders of magnitude (the best fit).  I was
&gt; &gt; mentioning a historical point.

&gt; Did you even know about WMAP before I told you about it? Did you think
&gt; WMAP was launching next year?

&gt; &gt; Please, you don't seriously think the Lambda CDM will last more than a
few
&gt; &gt; years, do you??  You can't just go around making up theories of Dark
Matter
&gt; &gt; and Energy and expect the entire science community to swallow it forever
&gt; &gt; without checking to see if there is any validity in these made up
ideas??

&gt; Yea, thank god science has folks like you. What would science do
&gt; without people to tell scientists how stupid they are?!

&gt; Do you _REALLY_ think the entire scientific community is as stupid as
&gt; you make them sound? Do you think it is at ALL possible, given that
&gt; you don't actually understand much about the field, that you are
&gt; ignorant of something rather important? Like perhaps the bullet
&gt; cluster results and weak lensing surveys of galaxies that have put
&gt; actual numbers on the amount of dark matter?

I never said scientists were stupid.  I have been canvassing the
alternatives (generally) and suggesting other possible avenues that might be
explored.  The speed limits mentioned at the head of this thread would not
invalidate any current theory that I am aware of.

The dark matter survey is very tentative eg

In the case of the Big Bang theory, you are quite right with "I think that

Ever."  For all actual science, conclusions are often challenged.  Note how

"Additionally, the work may help to explain a long-standing discrepancy
between theory and observation. The leading modern cosmological model,
Lambda Cold Dark Matter ([lambda]CDM), predicts that many more small
galaxies surround massive galaxies like the Milky Way and Andromeda than are
currently observed. This mismatch, which is often referred to as the
"missing satellites problem," has been traditionally regarded as one of the
toughest challenges to the [lambda]CDM paradigm. Kazantzidis' work suggests
that the process by which small galaxies are stripped of their luminous
matter is common, and implies that the "missing" galaxies could exist in the
form of dark matter-dominated satellites."

I thought the Lambda CDM was near enough proved.  It seems there are not
only challenges for the 'paradigm', but a hierarchy with the above being
"one of the toughest challenges."

On the subject of the paper you mention - I think this quote sums up the
general tone - there are more back exits through which to flee than an
illegal brothel.  Should counter data show up there will be plenty of exits
for the drafters of this paper...In other words, they have not committed
themselves to the Lambda CDM, merely pointed out that it is the only game in
town at present and the data they have gathered can be shoehorned into the
model:

"A. SZ Marginalization, Priors, and Likelihood Approximations
In this Appendix we discuss the affect that various analysis choices have on
the estimated
cosmological parameters, focusing on the six parameter ?CDM model"

that is, free to choose parameters that best fit preconceptions.

I agree that the Lambda CDM is the only Big Bang game in town at present and
it sets a high standard, but your rosy optimism is over the top - you seem
to rule out the likelihood of future models and the possible downfall of the
Lambda CDM - I point out that history has a way of repeating itself.

Schwarzschild Radius is not down to Schwarzschild?  Maybe it is, maybe it
isn't.  The point is that if enough mass accumulates than the escape
velcoity will eventually equal the speed of light eg

V(escape)=(2GM/(r+h))^.5
solving for mass and from the surface of the object (h=0) we have
r=2GM/V^2
for the speed of light escape velocity we have
r=2GM/c^2
which is the calculation for the Schwarzschild Radius I gave above.  Which
according to you is 'classical'.  But you either don't know or won't say
what the non-classical equation is.

You aren't even right classically. The mass contained within a sphere

I find it odd that folks keep saying "show the math" when they
themselves are wildly ignorant of the math. The very notion that your
escape velocity calculation is a classical calculation from a theory
that is vastly different from relativity and thus not applicable
escapes you.

The mass required to prop up a hole of a given radius R is M = 4pi
rho(r)*r^2 dr, integrated from 0 to R. Except that isn't the actual
mass - there is a significant amount of binding energy. The proper
mass is in fact M* = 4pi int[rho(r)*r^2/sqrt(1-2Gm(r)/r) dr, 0...R]
where m(r) = 4pi int[rho(r')r'^2 dr',0...r].

The difference M* - M is the binding energy, something that does not
exist classically because binding energy does not gravitate in
classical mechanics.

[snip remaining]

Either you are ignorant or you are stupid. I have repeatedly pointed
out that you are using a Newtonian calculation in a relativistic
regime.

Is there no simple calculation for gravitational time dilation, usually

OK, you *say* that your calculation yields a different mass.  So let's
compare some actual numbers and see where we stand.

The critical density to make the universe recollapse (from 1990s models) is

As you understand your own math with such fluency, you should have no
trouble coming up with a figure from your own formula.

Maybe it was before your time but there was a lot of talk about the required
mass to close the universe, and the calculation to determine that mass for a
given radius just happens to be the same as the one I gave.  But then not
everyone is a general relativist? Or perhaps the equation often given is
only an approximation?  So you can give us the definitive number ie the
radius of a Schwarzschild Black Hole given a density as quoted above.  I
can't wait.  Really!!

Yes, it is what people say when they don't like the implications of
mathematically precise results.  There was an interesting debate about the
age of the Earth in the mid 19th century and 'coincidence' was often
quoted - those who thought the Earth must be older than 6,000 years and came
up with data on strata were told by other scientists (yes, way back then
many scientists believed the bible was correct).  It was a coincidence that
strata seemed to indicate an ancient age. The alternative explanation was
that the great biblical flood drowned many species, and when the flood
subsided the heavier animals eg dinosaurs, sank to the bottom and the
lighter animals, eg mammals, floated to the top - hence the strata!!

It is no coincidence.  In your rush to deny anything that isn't in your text
book you have become confused.

I can see that they are different, but don't know what numbers your math

which I have evaluated and given the results.  If I present results that
disagree with what you believe to be correct then you will claim that I have
not understood or manipulated the math correctly, which is why I asked you
to do it.  Pity you are incapable (apparently).

So, what you are saying is that you can quote equations from a text book but
you can't apply them yourself?  You need me to help you out?

I asked for your assessment of your own equations and you failed.  I can
only conclude that you do not have the math skills you claim to have.

A 1000 nm photon would have energy h*c/lambda, and
therefore mass 2h/(lambda*c) = 4.4204 * 10^-36 kg according
to Newton (m = 2E/v^2).  Einstein states rest mass of a
