Was Mikhail dealt a deathly blow from the sonic fence, but was able to
rejuvenate? If so, perhaps when he was first met Jane (was her name
Jane?) told him to shoot her knowing she would return to life. Has
anyone with good language skills translated what was said? Where is it
found?

Perhaps only those who were involved in the life extension project of
Mittleberg have a chance to recover from serious wounds, ala lost
experience.

There are likely several factions of &quot;others&quot; apart from Ben's group.
The Dharma Initiative was one faction (now supposedly all dead), Ben's
group, Rousseau's people may be another group (and we may yet discover
more of her people... there is her daughter), Naomi's people may be
another faction, and Penny's people may be another faction. This could
explain why only some people have extraordinary healing powers.

What are some examples of extraordinary healing on the Island?

Ben's rapid recovery
John's walking
Jin's fertility
Mikhail recovery from sonic fence
people surviving the plane crash

Um, is that it? Perhaps there is some genetic reason for some to heal
and others not.

There is a big difference between rejuvenation and returning from the
dead.  You went from talking about to 'returning to life' to taking
about 'rapid healing'. Yes, we have seen rapid and/or extroardinary
healing, but its a leap to go from that to outright resurrection,
espeically when we have seen literally dozens of deaths on the island.
MAYBE there is something different about some people, but I'll wait
for the show to demonstrate that, rather than making these huge
leaps.  The show itself made a point of saying that Mikhail did NOT
return from the dead, that the fence was set on stun. A laughably lame
explanation to be sure, but thats not enough evidence to suggest that
he really WAS dead.

I think you're talking about Bea Klugh.  Here is the translation of
the Russian dialogue, from http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Enter_77 :

Klugh: Mikhail. Mikhail! You know what to do.
Mikhail: We still have another way [out].
Klugh: We cannot risk it. You know the conditions.
Mikhail: There is another way.
Klugh: They captured us. We will not let them to get into the
territory.
Klugh: You know what to do. That's an order.
Mikhail: We still have another way!
Klugh (in English): Just do it, Mikhail.
Mikhail: Forgive me. (shoots)

I was thinking about the wormhole / time travel theory, and I wonder
how a dead body would be affected if brought to an earlier time (prior
to death).  If Christian's body was on flight 815, and the plane
entered a wormhole into the past, would he be &quot;revived&quot;?  Would Locke,
Rose, and Jin be &quot;healed&quot; if they time-traveled to a point prior to
the beginning of their health problems?  But this wouldn't explain
Emily Linus' appearance, since she was apparently never brought to the
island, nor would it explain why Yemi's body initially decayed, even
though he *seemed* to appear alive later.

I do like the possibility of a wormhole with two &quot;mouths,&quot; one in the
Pacific and one in the Atlantic.  An Atlantic &quot;mouth&quot; would explain
how the Beechcraft reached the island, and would also tie in with the
foot statue and the possible presence of an Atlantis-type society on
the island.  This theory may have been hinted at with things like the
cave-in (two entrances) and the blast door map quote &quot;A mouse does not
rely on just one hole.&quot;  I also like Hurley's description of the golf
course: &quot;It's 2 holes, for now. 3 par, and no waiting.&quot;

I keep thinking about the poor Marshall.  It seems he could have
healed if the shrapnel was removed...and he wasn't shot....and then
strangled (er whatever Jack did).

I do hope there's something about being burned (like Colleen) versus
being buried in regards to the dead.   It just seems like there's
something off there.  The dead Dharma folk were put in the earth, but
not covered up.  There was something about the look Juliette gave when
Hurley told her about how they buried Ethan.  There's something
there.   I thought about that again when they said we should ask if
Nikki and Paolo are really dead.

We have seen bodies burned, buried, at the bottom of a pond, in trees,
in a van, in a cave and in an open pit and NONE of these people have
come back to life.  The Others sure take it hard when one of their
people dies, if that person was likely to come back from the dead.  I
am going to go with the preponderance of evidence over a look on

special about burial, it doesn't apply to him and he is the prime

need a whole lot more evidence before I go down the resurrection path.

I wouldn't say buried in a pond, at the bottom of a pond, submerged in
the pond, but not buried.  All your examples, no one was covered with
dirt.   Covered by a vehicle and water, but not dirt. Hmmm, okay, the
two in the cave, you could say they're covered by dirt, but they're
still not exactly buried. Ethan's burial was a bit ominous with how
they focused on the bit of his hand showing. (and included one of
Hurley's greatest lines ever - &quot; I know how this ends, it ends with
you and me crying and running through the jungle&quot;  Love it!)
I don't know if there is resurrection on the island, but I think those
who have been buried... something's up with that.  Maybe the 'whatever
it is' will be different for Nikki and Paolo since they were alive
when buried, but something's going to happen with that. It just has
to!
Why wouldn't they cover up the mass grave?  Why throw those folks in a
pit yet set Colleen ablaze and send her off?
I just get a  feeling there's more to it and hope it's something
that's brought up.

many people as this show does, there is going to be some variety in
the method of body disposal.  I also think its odd that the one person
who MAY have come back to life (I don't think so but for the sake of
argument) is Mikhail who was NOT buried.   I honestly don't think
there is anything different about the people who were buried.   If
there is something going on, its severely under-clued.

The mass grave was left open as a symbol so Ben could intimidate
people, IMO.   As in, &quot;you're next if you step out of line, I'll just
chuck you on the pile&quot;.

Also of all the other people who were buried... Boone, Shannon, Libby,
the chick who drowned, etc... there was nothing hinted at that their
burial was anything other than interring a body in the ground. the big
deal about Nikki and Paolo is that they were buried ALIVE, a nasty way
to go, for sure.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; anyone with good language skills translated what was said? Where is it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; found?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What about the DOZENS of other people we have seen die on the Island?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;From the 40 people in the open Dharma grave, to the plane crash
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; victims, to the survivors that met various deaths and the Others who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have been killed.   Henry Gale, Rousseau's shipmates, Adam and Eve.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why have none of these dozens of other people not returned from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dead?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps only those who were involved in the life extension project of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mittleberg have a chance to recover from serious wounds, ala lost
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are likely several factions of &quot;others&quot; apart from Ben's group.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Dharma Initiative was one faction (now supposedly all dead), Ben's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; group, Rousseau's people may be another group (and we may yet discover
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more of her people... there is her daughter), Naomi's people may be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; another faction, and Penny's people may be another faction. This could
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explain why only some people have extraordinary healing powers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What are some examples of extraordinary healing on the Island?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ben's rapid recovery
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; John's walking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jin's fertility
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mikhail recovery from sonic fence
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people surviving the plane crash

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Um, is that it? Perhaps there is some genetic reason for some to heal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and others not.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I keep thinking about the poor Marshall.  It seems he could have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; healed if the shrapnel was removed...and he wasn't shot....and then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; strangled (er whatever Jack did).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do hope there's something about being burned (like Colleen) versus
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being buried in regards to the dead.   It just seems like there's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something off there.  The dead Dharma folk were put in the earth, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not covered up.  There was something about the look Juliette gave when
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hurley told her about how they buried Ethan.  There's something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there.   I thought about that again when they said we should ask if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nikki and Paolo are really dead.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; We have seen bodies burned, buried, at the bottom of a pond, in trees,
&gt; &gt; &gt; in a van, in a cave and in an open pit and NONE of these people have
&gt; &gt; &gt; come back to life.  The Others sure take it hard when one of their
&gt; &gt; &gt; people dies, if that person was likely to come back from the dead.  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; am going to go with the preponderance of evidence over a look on
&gt; &gt; &gt; Juliette's face.  Mikhail wasn't buried, so even if there is something
&gt; &gt; &gt; special about burial, it doesn't apply to him and he is the prime
&gt; &gt; &gt; evidence that MAYBE people can come back from the dead. I'm going to
&gt; &gt; &gt; need a whole lot more evidence before I go down the resurrection path.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt; I wouldn't say buried in a pond, at the bottom of a pond, submerged in
&gt; &gt; the pond, but not buried.  All your examples, no one was covered with
&gt; &gt; dirt.   Covered by a vehicle and water, but not dirt. Hmmm, okay, the
&gt; &gt; two in the cave, you could say they're covered by dirt, but they're
&gt; &gt; still not exactly buried. Ethan's burial was a bit ominous with how
&gt; &gt; they focused on the bit of his hand showing. (and included one of
&gt; &gt; Hurley's greatest lines ever - &quot; I know how this ends, it ends with
&gt; &gt; you and me crying and running through the jungle&quot;  Love it!)
&gt; &gt; I don't know if there is resurrection on the island, but I think those
&gt; &gt; who have been buried... something's up with that.  Maybe the 'whatever
&gt; &gt; it is' will be different for Nikki and Paolo since they were alive
&gt; &gt; when buried, but something's going to happen with that. It just has
&gt; &gt; to!
&gt; &gt; Why wouldn't they cover up the mass grave?  Why throw those folks in a
&gt; &gt; pit yet set Colleen ablaze and send her off?
&gt; &gt; I just get a  feeling there's more to it and hope it's something
&gt; &gt; that's brought up.- Hide quoted text -

I have to laugh that you suggest I'm reading too much into it.
Compared with some of the other folks on these boards I'm barely
paying attention to anything on the show.   :o)

Again, it's just a feeling I have that I hope comes to fruition.
With how Locke said that nothing stays buried on the island and the
writers saying we should ask if Nikki and Paolo are really dead, I
just think there's something to it.

My theory is that he was supposed to live (fake injury), but that Kate
double crossed him by getting Sawyer to shoot him.  The gun might've
been loaded with a blank round, but Sawyer didn't know that, and at
that range it injured the Marshal fatally.

Whatever they were after, the Marshal and Kate were supposed to share,

people have buried and none of them have come back from the dead.  I'm

As a female I'm forced to say &quot;Aw, that would be so sweet!&quot;.

Now back to reality.   While that would make a lot of people happy,
with the big evil on it's way to the island, Sawyer being all
conflicted about killing Locke's dad and a limited number of episodes
left, I don't know that a wedding would be that important right now.
It would make a nice token of affection, but I think the diamonds
would be for something more important than cementing a relationship,
especially since Sawyer knows Kate has feelings for Jack.
If anything, the diamonds will probably be needed for the big Worm
Hole Destroying Machine or the Island Time Ship Starting Mechanism
Whatchamahoosits they may need in season 6.

Sure, the markings and the stories are there.  Are the bodies, and are
they the SAME bodies?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

What I saw was their bodies shrouded, then the dog stealing the
shroud, then a pair of bodies going into the ground.  How do we know
that between the time the bodies were shrouded and when the dog pulled
it off, or a later time after they were shrouded again, that no switch
was made?

Speaking of dead bodies, isn't it interesting that so many bones, down
to fingers, were reportedly (by Kate) found to have been broken on
Scott's body?  Could Scott have had an identical twin who died and was
a tissue donor?  Damon's written at least one frozen corpse story.
When Boone fell asleep on sentry duty, was anyone else awake, or was
everyone drugged asleep?  Just throwing some possibilities out.

You mean the episode had just one point, and that somehow the remark
above is incompatible with it?  What do you think that point was?

So you missed the shot of Nikki opening her eyes just as the dirt was
being shoveled on top of her?  That was *the* most important moment,
as it drove home the fact that she and Paulo were being buried alive,
but couldn't move to stop it.

Here are two screencaps of Nikki and Paulo in the grave.  Note the
diamonds scattered over Nikki's body in the first shot:

&gt; &gt; Well there seemed to be burial 'humps' and Hurley did point out to
&gt; &gt; Juliette where they buried Ethan.

&gt; Sure, the markings and the stories are there.  Are the bodies, and are
&gt; they the SAME bodies?

&gt; &gt; We do know Nikki and Paolo were buried.

&gt; Speaking of dead bodies, isn't it interesting that so many bones, down
&gt; to fingers, were reportedly (by Kate) found to have been broken on
&gt; Scott's body?  Could Scott have had an identical twin who died and was
&gt; a tissue donor?  Damon's written at least one frozen corpse story.
&gt; When Boone fell asleep on sentry duty, was anyone else awake, or was
&gt; everyone drugged asleep?  Just throwing some possibilities out.

Please throw them out, they belong in the garbage...
