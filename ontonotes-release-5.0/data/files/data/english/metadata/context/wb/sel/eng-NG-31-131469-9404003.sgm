By request......&quot;kelvin L&quot;&gt;I just wonder do you have &quot;Summer
Blue&quot;,if do would you mind share it&lt;

Here is the Norway's Gay Themed Short Film by Frank Mosvold
entitled &quot;Summer Blues&quot;....
The language is Norweigan but! I have included an external English
Subtitle that you can use
with whatever media player you prefer. If you don't know how to use
an external subtitle
with your preferred media player just google it to find out--

I ripped this DVD setting the XVID codec's quanitizer to (1) for
highest quality hence the
rather large file size/high bitrate.

Enjoy :)
