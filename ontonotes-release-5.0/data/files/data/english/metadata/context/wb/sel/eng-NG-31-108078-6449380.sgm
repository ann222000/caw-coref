Folks:

Two 2 x 4 grid sections have been completed.  The
2 x 4 L-girders made earlier were joined by short L-girders into a
grid.  After finding that the first, which
had yellow glue and wood screws at all joints, made
distressing cracking noises when 'tested', I switched
to Liquid Nails for the small-area joints, and started
using drywall screws at all joints, having run out
of wood screws.  Both units seem extremely rigid
against bending and racking stresses; twisting is
decent but not perfect.  There has to be a way
to make a light model RR frame that won't twist!
Maybe I could try some 1 x 2 cross-bridging...

Having put aside the question of legs, I am now
pondering my options for topping these units.  I
want a flat top, lightweight yet rigid, cheap to
build, with all fasteners from below, and of course
/quiet/.  What does everybody think about:

-1/4" plywood or masonite glue-laminated to 2"
foam- the board holds the screws; the foam provides
rigidity, and can be sculpted.  Track would be
laid on cork roadbed.  Cost, probably .75
per square foot.  I could also use just foam, at
.50 per square foot, but would have to glue this,
which I'm trying to avoid.

-3/8" or 1/2" plywood or waferboard with
1/2" Homasote glue-laminated to it.  Track would
be directly laid on the Homasote.  Not so easy
to sculpt, perhaps, and a bit more expensive,
at $1 per square foot, but perhaps quieter and
stronger?  Certainly it would hold nails better.

For this section of board, since it's going to
be a flattish industrial area with a number of
spurs, I'm not going to bother with open-grid
work.  If I use the Homasote-plywood method
I may well space the board out 1" or so, though.

Has anybody some suggestions or favored
methods I might try here?

Cordially yours:

Have you considered building triangles into your structure?  They're the
best geometric shape for keeping things in place.

Get good plywood if you're going as thin as 1/4".  If you're thinking of
moving the module (for shows or moving every couple years) stop no
shorter than 1/2" cabinet grade.  "I need your help to move this" is a
lot easier than "I've got to fix this huge crack down the middle of the
road."

Build slow, and take the time to reevaluate your work if you're not sure
about it.  That way, you've only got a module or two to fix, rather than
a whole layout.

I made the decision to finish (but not superdetail) each module of mine
before I went on to the next module.  As a result, I've always got
something different to do and space to try something new.

Use deeper but thinner sections of timber - even use plywood in place of
timber.

In the below, I suggest using baltic birch rather than regular wood or
other plywood because it is much stronger, has twice or more number of
plys, and its outer layer won't shred like soft plywood (bitter
experience here with Home Depot plywood).  You will need to find baltic
birch at a hardwood supplier.  1/2" is stronger than 3/4" regular plywood
or dimensional wood.

Next time consider using 1/2" baltic birch plywood for the frame,
fastening it with Tite-bond yellow glue and airgun brads.  Incredibly
strong and true.

You do not need the plywood if you do below.
1) Make sure that you get flat 2" foam.  I got some that wasn't.
2) Nest the foam inside the frame, either all 2" or less and glue it with
Tite-bond also.  Knife cut, foam cutter, or sand the foam so it just fits
inside and doens't distort the frame.
3) A 2" triangle or square of 1/2" baltic birch in the corners will
strengthen the corners and provide a ledge so the foam is all at the same
depth.

You could nest it only 1" deep if you wanted a stream to wander through.
If the module is just flat, consider gluing and bradding 1/4" baltic
birch to the top and adding a 1" brace every 18" or so to prevent any
sagging.

Racking or twisting resistance is a function of the depth of the
framework. It pays to use the lightest possible beams, so the above is a
good suggestion. The same method is used in so-called engineered floor
joist systems.

Trevor Marshall (IIRC) published an article in RMC in which he described
building 4" deep frames made of 1/4" or 3/8" plywood. He used hot glue,
screws and 1x1 blocks in the corners, adding diagonals to triangulate
the whole frame. He first cut large holes (ca. 2" diameter) in the
beams. The holes lightened the framework, and also provided passages for
the wiring. The frames were 4ft to 6ft in length an up to 2ft wide. IIRC
the lumberyard ripped the plywood sheets for him. He wrote that the net
cost about the same as for the usual frame made of 1" dimensional
lumber, and a good deal lighter, despite the extra bracing.

A lot of work IMO, but probably justified for portable module sections,
or in preparation for the moves that seem inevitable in one's
career-building years.

A bricklayer friend has given me cutoffs of black extruded styrofoam
insulation panels 15-5/8" wide by 3" or 3-1/2" thick. Very light, very
rigid, won't rack, period. I will be gluing two of these side by side to
make a "frame" 31-1/4" wide by about 48" long, as base for a portable N
scale exhibition layout. Two pieces of 1/4" ply glued to the bottom will
help hold the pieces together, reducing strain on the center joint.
(Just an oval of track with passing siding and a couple of spurs,
looping round a bay, tunneling through a headland, and crossing the
harbour mouth on a bascule bridge. I want an excuse to build a lighthouse.)

GP (and others),

What I did was the following... I went to the lumber yard and bought some
good one side 3/4" plywood.  I had them cut it into strips that were three
and four inches wide by the length of the material.  I estimated how many of
each I would need.

I had a pretty detailed plan that I worked off of for the frame.  I
carefully used thin long nails and wood glue to build the framework; I used
the three inch strips on their edge.  I tried to consider section joints and
having some longer strips for added strength &amp; rigidity.  I made smaller
sections in the garage then assembled them in my train room due to doorway
considerations.

Once I had the entire frame completed on the floor in my train room, I added
the four inch strips on the outside so that the bottoms were even with the
framework.  This made the framework recessed an inch inside of the outside
framing.  I also added some simple metal 90° angles in strategic corners for
extra strength &amp; rigidity.  Now comes the hard part... I raised the entire
grid up on some boxes that looked like milk crates to attach the legs.  I
was careful to keep the tops of the legs level with the tops of the
framework.  I attached the 2x4 legs with wood screws &amp; bracing.

Next, I laid sheets of 1/4" luan plywood on the framework.  Where necessary,
I simply marked them from below to fit then cut them out.  I used wood glue
and an electric brad gun to secure the plywood to the framework.  When the
framework was completely covered, I did the same ting with 3/4" blue foam
insulation board.  I tried to stagger the joints for extra strength.  After
the parts were cut to fit, I glued them in place with Liquid Nails that was
compatible with foam.  The 3/4" foam and 1/4" plywood made up the extra inch
so that when I was done, the deck of the layout was even with the boards I
used on the outside of the layout.

My layout kind of looks like a big capital "E" and it is strong enough that
a relatively light tap on the one end can be felt all the way around to the
other end.  The layout is in a climate-controlled area (heat &amp; A/C) but I
have not seen any issues with moisture causing warping or anything along
those lines.  The boards on edge give you plenty of space to run wiring in
such a way that it doesn't hang down in the way.  All in all, I'm pretty
satisfied with the way it turned out.

What I would do differently would probably only be to use 1/2" plywood
instead of the 3/4"  There isn't a whole lot of difference in price, but it
would be lighter and probably about as strong.  But the 3/4" foam glued to
the 1/4" plywood seems to be plenty strong.

By the way, cork roadbed is glued to the foam; track is glued to the cork
roadbed.  That makes it pretty quiet.  If you use any kine of nails that run
into the plywood, that will allow the sound to resonate from the bottom of
the layout like one large speaker.  The only problem with this track-laying
technique is that you need to be pretty sure where you want your track to be
laid; the glue isn't easy to remove from the track and nearly impossible to
remove from the foam &amp; cork roadbed.

If anyone wants a more detailed description, please contact me outside of
the group &amp; I'll try to explain in more detail what I did.

&gt; Next, I laid sheets of 1/4&quot; luan plywood on the framework.  Where necessary,
&gt; I simply marked them from below to fit then cut them out.  I used wood glue
&gt; and an electric brad gun to secure the plywood to the framework.  When the
&gt; framework was completely covered, I did the same ting with 3/4&quot; blue foam
&gt; insulation board.  I tried to stagger the joints for extra strength.  After
&gt; the parts were cut to fit, I glued them in place with Liquid Nails that was
&gt; compatible with foam.  The 3/4&quot; foam and 1/4&quot; plywood made up the extra inch
&gt; so that when I was done, the deck of the layout was even with the boards I
&gt; used on the outside of the layout.

&gt; My layout kind of looks like a big capital &quot;E&quot; and it is strong enough that
&gt; a relatively light tap on the one end can be felt all the way around to the
&gt; other end.  The layout is in a climate-controlled area (heat &amp; A/C) but I
&gt; have not seen any issues with moisture causing warping or anything along

&gt; would be lighter and probably about as strong.  But the 3/4&quot; foam glued to
&gt; the 1/4&quot; plywood seems to be plenty strong.

&gt; roadbed.  That makes it pretty quiet.  If you use any kine of nails that run
&gt; into the plywood, that will allow the sound to resonate from the bottom of
&gt; the layout like one large speaker.  The only problem with this track-laying

&gt; remove from the foam &amp; cork roadbed.

I would go with the 1/2" plywood sides to the frame rather than 3/4" or
even lighter. (we've been metric in NZ for the last 30 years) I've used
9mm ply.
For the top surface I use 9mm Chipboard (coarse MDF) plus 12mm Pinex
(compressed soft fiber) and on the outside faces I use 3mm or 5mm brown
Hardboard. 3mm where the edge stops at baseboard level and 5mm where it
forms the backscene and boxes in the structure'

My reasoning is that the trackbed needs mass to dampen train noise.
Where the track rises or falls within the baseboard I make sure the
corners in particular are gussetted with the 9mm chipboard and also
areas between tracks that aren't required to be open for access are
filled.
I think the depth of the sideframes is important for rigidity but the
thickness needs only be sufficient to stop them buckling from weight
(people leaning on layout) so possibly a single 1/4" thickness might do
the job.
I keep meaning to try making the backscene the rear frame structure, but
baseboard construction always seems to be hurried as I always seem to be
focussed on the layout to come. ;-)

The other two factors I now try to keep to are total weight (moveable by
two people, one being my wife) and baseboard (module) size small enough
to fit through a standard doorway.

One I built was so precise that it jammed going through the doorway
because I hadn't taken account of the vinyl to carpet floor covering
transition.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Folks:

&gt;&gt; &gt; Two 2 x 4 grid sections have been completed.  The
&gt;&gt; &gt; 2 x 4 L-girders made earlier were joined by short L-girders into a
&gt;&gt; &gt; grid.  After finding that the first, which
&gt;&gt; &gt; had yellow glue and wood screws at all joints, made
&gt;&gt; &gt; distressing cracking noises when 'tested', I switched
&gt;&gt; &gt; to Liquid Nails for the small-area joints, and started
&gt;&gt; &gt; using drywall screws at all joints, having run out
&gt;&gt; &gt; of wood screws.  Both units seem extremely rigid
&gt;&gt; &gt; against bending and racking stresses; twisting is
&gt;&gt; &gt; decent but not perfect.  There has to be a way
&gt;&gt; &gt; to make a light model RR frame that won't twist!
&gt;&gt; &gt; Maybe I could try some 1 x 2 cross-bridging...

&gt;&gt; &gt; Having put aside the question of legs, I am now
&gt;&gt; &gt; pondering my options for topping these units.  I
&gt;&gt; &gt; want a flat top, lightweight yet rigid, cheap to
&gt;&gt; &gt; build, with all fasteners from below, and of course
&gt;&gt; &gt; /quiet/.  What does everybody think about:

&gt;&gt; &gt; -1/4&quot; plywood or masonite glue-laminated to 2&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; foam- the board holds the screws; the foam provides
&gt;&gt; &gt; rigidity, and can be sculpted.  Track would be
&gt;&gt; &gt; laid on cork roadbed.  Cost, probably .75
&gt;&gt; &gt; per square foot.  I could also use just foam, at
&gt;&gt; &gt; .50 per square foot, but would have to glue this,
&gt;&gt; &gt; which I'm trying to avoid.

&gt;&gt; &gt; -3/8&quot; or 1/2&quot; plywood or waferboard with
&gt;&gt; &gt; 1/2&quot; Homasote glue-laminated to it.  Track would
&gt;&gt; &gt; be directly laid on the Homasote.  Not so easy
&gt;&gt; &gt; to sculpt, perhaps, and a bit more expensive,
&gt;&gt; &gt; at $1 per square foot, but perhaps quieter and
&gt;&gt; &gt; stronger?  Certainly it would hold nails better.

&gt;&gt; &gt; For this section of board, since it's going to
&gt;&gt; &gt; be a flattish industrial area with a number of
&gt;&gt; &gt; spurs, I'm not going to bother with open-grid
&gt;&gt; &gt; work.  If I use the Homasote-plywood method
&gt;&gt; &gt; I may well space the board out 1&quot; or so, though.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Has anybody some suggestions or favored
&gt;&gt; &gt; methods I might try here?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Cordially yours:
&gt;&gt; &gt; Gerard P.
&gt;&gt; &gt; President, a box of track and some grids.

&gt;&gt; GP (and others),

&gt;&gt; What I did was the following... I went to the lumber yard and bought some
&gt;&gt; good one side 3/4&quot; plywood.  I had them cut it into strips that were
&gt;&gt; three
&gt;&gt; and four inches wide by the length of the material.  I estimated how many
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; each I would need.

&gt;&gt; I had a pretty detailed plan that I worked off of for the frame.  I
&gt;&gt; carefully used thin long nails and wood glue to build the framework; I
&gt;&gt; used
&gt;&gt; the three inch strips on their edge.  I tried to consider section joints
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; having some longer strips for added strength &amp; rigidity.  I made smaller
&gt;&gt; sections in the garage then assembled them in my train room due to
&gt;&gt; doorway
&gt;&gt; considerations.

&gt;&gt; Once I had the entire frame completed on the floor in my train room, I
&gt;&gt; added
&gt;&gt; the four inch strips on the outside so that the bottoms were even with
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; framework.  This made the framework recessed an inch inside of the
&gt;&gt; outside
&gt;&gt; framing.  I also added some simple metal 90° angles in strategic corners
&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; extra strength &amp; rigidity.  Now comes the hard part... I raised the
&gt;&gt; entire
&gt;&gt; grid up on some boxes that looked like milk crates to attach the legs.  I
&gt;&gt; was careful to keep the tops of the legs level with the tops of the
&gt;&gt; framework.  I attached the 2x4 legs with wood screws &amp; bracing.

&gt;&gt; Next, I laid sheets of 1/4&quot; luan plywood on the framework.  Where
&gt;&gt; necessary,
&gt;&gt; I simply marked them from below to fit then cut them out.  I used wood
&gt;&gt; glue
&gt;&gt; and an electric brad gun to secure the plywood to the framework.  When
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; framework was completely covered, I did the same ting with 3/4&quot; blue foam
&gt;&gt; insulation board.  I tried to stagger the joints for extra strength.
&gt;&gt; After
&gt;&gt; the parts were cut to fit, I glued them in place with Liquid Nails that
&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt; compatible with foam.  The 3/4&quot; foam and 1/4&quot; plywood made up the extra
&gt;&gt; inch
&gt;&gt; so that when I was done, the deck of the layout was even with the boards

&gt;&gt; used on the outside of the layout.

DM:

This sounds like as detailed a description as one could want, and
seems
like it would make a very light, rigid structure...I like it.  I
especially like the
notion of getting the strips cut on the lumberyard's panel saw -- I
don't have
a table saw myself, but if I did that this method would be completely
practical.  I'll probably stick with built-up L-girders for now, since
I have
piles of 1x3's and 1x2's to use up.

I would imagine that you could remove track pretty easily by slipping
a hack
saw blade under it...perhaps you could glue the cork only at
intervals, making
this easier.

My brother once built himself a 4 x 6 model railroad from plywood...he
hand-
ripped it into 3" strips, too. :-)

I'd think you could make Steve C's engineered-beam design by just
gluing some
1x2's to one side of the plywood strip.  I'm not sure about them,
though, for a
grid-type layout, though they might work for girder framing if braced
well...it
seems that with the thin web they'd twist quite easily along their
long axis.

Liquid nails and Robertson screws are good stuff, I find.  Whoever
mentioned
that Lowe's doesn't carry such screws in certain places is quite
right, by the
way.  Ours only has Phillips and star drive, in the big cartons.  I
didn't look in
the 89 cent bags.

Triangles are indeed being built into the design...I have 45 deg.
braces at the
corners.  One grid uses 1 x 3, the other 1 x 2.  The smaller wood
seems fine.

&gt; Trevor Marshall (IIRC) published an article in RMC in which he described

&gt; screws and 1x1 blocks in the corners, adding diagonals to triangulate
&gt; the whole frame. He first cut large holes (ca. 2&quot; diameter) in the
&gt; beams. The holes lightened the framework, and also provided passages for
&gt; the wiring. The frames were 4ft to 6ft in length an up to 2ft wide. IIRC
&gt; the lumberyard ripped the plywood sheets for him. He wrote that the net
&gt; cost about the same as for the usual frame made of 1&quot; dimensional
&gt; lumber, and a good deal lighter, despite the extra bracing.

&gt; A lot of work IMO, but probably justified for portable module sections,

&gt; A bricklayer friend has given me cutoffs of black extruded styrofoam

Hmm.  I read Marshall's article a while back.  It seemed like a good
system
for a solid top (I can't recall if such was his layout).  I do wonder
how well it
would work out with open-grid framing.  Probably the 3/8" ply would
flex too
much.

Seems like his holes should have been about 1-5/16".  ISTR that a beam
isn't
greatly weakened by crosswise holes that take up no more than the
central
third.  Of course any horizontal drilling would make it less rigid in
the horizontal
direction...a 2" hole through a 4" beam would cut strength in this
direction in
half (in the vertical direction the effect would be much less).

I've seen this thick styrofoam, and it is indeed rigid stuff.  What's

Well, no, it wouldn't actually. The resistance to flexing is in the
geometry of the frame, not the size of the members. Marshall's frame is
a full 4" deep. Every cell is a triangle, none a rectangle. That's what
makes it rigid. Compared to a 1x3" beam, the 4" beam is about 2-1/2
times more resistant to vertical bending. The triangular braces increase
resistance to sideways tipping, which would result in twisting of the
whole frame. The result is a very rigid frame, much more rigid than a
1x3 frame even though the beams are much thinner.

However, you're right that a skin on the top and bottom would increase
rigidity even more. It would prevent almost all sideways tipping of the
beams. IIRC, Marshall did put a 1/8" or 1/4" skin on the bottom of his
frames. As for open grid framing: the risers and roadbed of an open grid
system would actually add to the stiffness of the frame.

You can remove a good deal more than 1/3rd of the material. The plywood
spars used in WW2 fighters had holes about 2/3rds the depth of the
spars. And consider a truss: it's a beam with triangular holes in it.
Most of the beam has been removed. Or consider an I beam: that's a solid
beam with most of its material removed, too.

Most of the resistance to bending/flexing is near the edges of a beam.
The further apart those edges are, the stronger the beam is. I forget
the formulas, but IIRC a beam that's twice as deep has four times the
bending resistance. **

No, regular wall insulation, installed between the studs. Or glued to
the concrete block walls. Easier and much more pleasant to install than
fiber glass batts, and a higher R value, too. Up here, we believe in
keeping the heat inside in winter and outside in summer. :-)
