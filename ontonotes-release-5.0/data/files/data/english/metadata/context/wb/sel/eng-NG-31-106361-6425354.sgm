How do makers of implanted medical devices react when one of their
products starts breaking?

One answer can be found in the case of a hernia repair device made by
a subsidiary of C. R. Bard Inc. In late 2005, the company sent out a
recall, urging doctors to stop using some versions of the product
because a plastic component could break and cut through a patient’s
internal organs and tissue.

At the time, Bard executives said they knew about some serious
injuries potentially caused by the device, which is known as the Kugel
patch. Since then, the Food and Drug Administration has received
reports of more than 80 injuries and other problems possibly related
to it, including several fatalities.

Bard officials said recently in a statement that they had not recalled
the product sooner because complaints about failures were too few and
unrelated to raise any alarms. The company also said that both it and
the subsidiary, Davol Inc., had reacted responsibly.

But when F.D.A. officials inspected Davol in early 2006, they
apparently found other reasons that company officials and the agency
might not have been alerted earlier. For example, inspectors reported
“discrepancies” and “inconsistencies” in how Davol tracked and
analyzed device-related complaints.

And, in several instances, Davol also did not accurately report the
possible severity of complaints to the agency, a copy of an inspection
report obtained by The New York Times under the Freedom of Information
Act shows.

Bard officials, who declined to be interviewed, said in a statement
that they have since addressed the agency’s concerns, and agency
officials said they are monitoring the company’s progress.

Still, at a time when the use of implanted medical devices is growing
sharply, the episode of the hernia patch is an example of what some
experts say is a far wider problem: that some major manufacturers,
while contending that they carefully monitor product safety, are not
as rigorous as they should be.

Harold Pellerite, a consultant to the medical device industry who
worked for two decades at the F.D.A., said he was surprised to
discover how little attention many companies pay to the issue.

“Firms take the opposite approach of what the F.D.A. expects,” said
Mr. Pellerite, who works for Quintiles Consulting in Rockville, Md.

Davol is not the only company where agency inspectors have found
problems with how a manufacturer tracks and reports possible device
failures.

Another case in point: a liquid plastic material called Enteryx once
sold by Boston Scientific as a treatment for patients with severe acid
reflux. The company learned after a patient’s death in mid-2004 that
some doctors, trying to inject the product at a specific site in the
base of the esophagus, could miss and cause damage to other organs,
including the heart.

But when agency inspectors went to Boston Scientific in mid-2005, they
could find no evidence that the device maker was adequately tracking
reports from doctors about that precise problem, a warning issued last
year by the agency shows. Soon after the inspection, the company
recalled Enteryx, which may have caused dozens of injuries, and
perhaps some deaths.

In a statement, Boston Scientific, which was also warned by the agency
in that same letter about systematic failures in its product-safety
review, said it had since overhauled its procedures.

“We have greatly improved the methods we use to analyze complaints and
complaint trends,” the company said.

Under F.D.A. rules, producers are required to have systems in place to
collect and analyze any complaints they receive from doctors and
hospitals about their devices. They are also required to send to the
agency any report indicating that a device’s failure may have
contributed to a patient’s death or injury.

But the agency gives device makers significant leeway about how to set
up such systems, including what guidelines to use to help them
determine when to issue product alerts to doctors or to issue a
recall. In addition, a company can decide not to forward a complaint
to the agency if it decides after an internal review that its product
was not at fault.

One result, said several experts like Mr. Pellerite, is that companies
tend to give themselves the benefit of any doubt.

Not long ago, one group of producers, makers of implanted heart
devices, agreed to adopt guidelines about how doctors should be
alerted to potential product hazards after a controversy involving the
Guidant Corporation. But the broader industry has not followed suit,
even though seemingly innocuous devices like the hernia patch can
cause as much, if not more, havoc in patients.

Kenneth W. Goodman, a co-director of the ethics program at the
University of Miami who also served as an adviser to Guidant, said he
believed that companies needed to do so because the potential stakes
involving implanted medical devices are so high.

“If a doctor holds a device in their hand that might fail and you know
about it, then the doctor needs to know about it,” Mr. Goodman said.

Chris Lavanchy, a director at ECRI Inc., a firm that evaluates medical
devices, said that companies were concerned that sending up a flare
too early might jeopardize sales when there was no reason for concern.

“As a producer, you want to feel justified there is a real problem
before undertaking a recall,” Mr. Lavanchy said.

In the case of the Kugel patch, both Bard and the F.D.A. have urged
doctors not to remove the device unless a patient starts experiencing
abdominal pain or a fever, which may be a sign that a fractured device
has cut tissue or is causing a peritonitis-like infection.

The recalled large Kugel patches were used frequently to treat
abdominal hernias. The small and medium-size versions were not
affected. (The Kugel patch is just one of several types of devices
used to repair hernias.)

Cynthia J. Wilson, who works for a health care system in Milwaukee,
said that she had to undergo emergency bowel surgery in 2004 to repair
a hole caused by a dislocated patch.

“I went to the hospital for two weeks and my friends were praying for
me,” said Ms. Wilson, who has filed a lawsuit against Bard.

The company declined to say how many lawsuits involving the device had
been filed or whether it had settled any of them.

The Kugel patch is made of two pieces of mesh that surround a flexible
plastic ring. To implant it, a doctor folds a patch, places it at the
site of the hernia, which is a spot where an organ pops through
internal tissue that has become weak or torn.

The released ring then springs back into its original shape,
flattening the patch. The meshlike material then serves as a substrate
that allows internal tissue to grow and resolve the hernia.

Davol, which is based in Cranston, R.I., makes the patch in various
sizes and shapes. And it was not long after it introduced the largest
units in 2002, F.D.A. records show, that company officials began to
receive a small but disproportionately high number of complaints about
broken rings in those “extra large” versions of the device.

Some of those complaints, agency records indicate, suggested that
serious injuries like the one experienced by Ms. Wilson might be
occurring.

Bard officials said that the initial numbers were small given the
number of patches sold, and the problems cited were too random to form
a troubling pattern.

But in mid-2005, Bard said, Davol received 10 complaints about ring
breaks over a three-month period starting that June. Six of those
reports, including one involving a possible fatality, came from
Germany, half of them from the same doctor there.

Bard said that Davol officials initially had concluded, based on their
review, that the ring breaks were occurring because doctors were
improperly folding the patch while implanting it.

As a result, Davol halted production in August 2005 of the extra-large
patches, began to hold training sessions for doctors in Germany and
started work on revising its instructions to doctors elsewhere about
how to implant the device, Bard said.

But the company kept distributing the patch and doctors kept
implanting it. That allowed the problem to continue because Davol’s
assessment proved wrong.

In early December 2005, tests run by the company on a failed patch
“suggested for the first time that the source of the ring break was
caused by a failure at the ring weld,” according to Bard.

Davol soon recalled the extra-large versions of the patch and, several
weeks later, expanded that recall to include large versions of the
device. It was after that initial patch recall that F.D.A. officials
went to Davol’s headquarters in early 2006 to do an inspection.

What they found there, their report indicates, was a range of
problems, including flaws in the system used by Davol to track
complaints.

For example, while Davol had purchased a new tracking system in 2004,
that program was incompatible with the earlier one it had been using,
resulting in significant “discrepancies” in how problems were recorded
and reviewed, agency inspectors reported.

Davol officials disagreed, that same report shows, saying they
cross-checked complaints by hand. But inspectors also reported that
company officials had also understated in several reports to the
agency the potential severity of device-related injuries, including
three reports involving injuries and one report involving a possible
device-related death.

In a statement, Bard said that it had not submitted those reports to
mislead the agency but said that the company had incorrectly
categorized the complaints based on the information it had at
