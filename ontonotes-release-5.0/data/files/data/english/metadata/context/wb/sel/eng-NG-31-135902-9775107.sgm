I believe this joystick is an early joystick made for the Apple II
series but I am unsure and have had no luck finding anything on
Google.

On the front is says MJI MFG Mt. View California
On the PCB inside the joystick it says Joy-Stick Controller M&amp;R
Enterprises (c) 1979.

TIA for any replys and help!

Here are photos.

More than likely it's for the Apple.  M&amp;R Enterprises had several
products out for the Apple II back then.  Most notably the
Sup'r'Terminal card, and the Sup'r'Mod video modulator.  On the 16 pin
pads on the joystick, is there an empty socket on the frontside?
Never heard of MJI though....

The cable would have been the best indicator, but with two analog axes
and two buttons it certainly seems in the right neighborhood.  Maybe
someone else has seen it before.

Yes, it's an Apple II joystick.

As Silicon Sam noted, M&amp;R is a very early provider of aftermarket
products for the Apple II.

As much as I hate to make blanket statements like this, I'm pretty
sure the PC didn't even *have* a joystick port in 1979, because,
according to Wikipedia, IBM released the IBM-PC on August 12, 1981. No
way to have a peripheral to predate its intended host by a couple of
years. Most of the time. ;-)

Back in the day, IBM and Apple were one of the few computers to use
trim pots for the X-Y positioning.  IBM and Apple used different
resistor values for their pots, which is why the joysticks were not
compatible.  Some manufacturers made joysticks with a switch that
would toggle between the two.  Obviously there would be a cable
adapter too.  Others such as Atari used plain switches for directional
control.  It's pretty obvious from the second photo that this stick
has pots for the controls.

Yes I have it listed on e-bay. If I am not sure about an item I take
the time to poke around, ask questions and do some research to make
sure that I am not misrepresenting what I am selling.
