Due to the arrival of a baby last year my B&amp;W 601 S3's on stands need to
go....

Obviously I am thinking along the lines of the Bose acoustimas 5 however i
have read mixed reviews. The speakers will be connected to a NAD 302BEE.

I'm looking more for small form factor rather than size and my budget will
run to approx £400

Any ideas on options and thoughts on the Bose units?

TIA

Neil

All BOSE stuff is overpriced rubbish.

If you can build or otherwise get cabinets I'd recommend a single unit
like Jordan JX92S.

http://www.ejjordan.co.uk/drivers/jx92.html

Very simple, very good. I use a good substitute myself, the Monacor
SPH-130AL. Small form factor.

Why would the Bose be any more child-proof than the B&amp;Ws?  And they
aren't THAT big.  Are you sure the Boss isn't just playing power
games: &quot;There's no room for YOUR toys any more...&quot;?  :-)

I've heard the Bose.  Overpriced and mediocre fashion objects.  If you
aren't to be allowed good speakers, get something really small and
cheap.   You can have your 601s back after the divorce :-)

Basically that - the 601s are off to the den that is luckily bigger than the
family room!

Just after small form factor and *reasonable* sound.

Thanks for the other ideas but really I'm after an out of the bose solution
and maybe my question should have been - 'I'm after small speakers that don't
pose a child risk and are the bose units, though overpriced, that bad an
option?'

I have thought of wall mounting my speakers bit personally I think wall
mounted speakers look a tad naff.

Rubbish.

Without hesitation I would suggest AVI Neutrons (or whatever the current
incarnation is called). There are some NuNeutrons on Ebay right now at
£220 - not cosmetically perfect but a steal at the price. Nothing to do
with me I hasten to add. My (old) Neutrons are not for sale.

Get something half decent from Richer Sounds and save £300. They'll still sound
better than Bose.

**Wouldn't it be kinda fun to be sued by Bose? I mean, you go to court to
prove that the words uttered (on the Usenet) are correct. It is up to Bose
to prove you wrong. You could wheel out a $199.00 Chinese sat/sub system and
make the jury do a DBT on it and a $2,000.00 Bose system. Do a frequency
response run on the Bose and demonstrate exactly how bad the thing is. Then
you could force them to reveal their profit/loss statements for the court.
Then we could start looing at the issue of retail price maintenance and how
it may apply to Bose products. Of course, it'll never happen, but we can
only dream. Bose has far too much to lose to bother litigating against
people who speak the truth about their products on the Usenet. They only go
for targets who can *really* hurt them.

I would suggest just about *anything* along the lines of a small front-
ported reflex box, wall mounted. Even if they roll off at 200Hz you can
always stick a small sub in a corner. It won't sound too horrid and you
still have your 601s anyway; it's not as if you have to get rid of them.

I got a pair of Acoustic Solutions speakers, ostensibly as an upgrade for
my computer system, but they are actually usable with a medium size sub -
and very cheap.

I'm afraid that with little ones around you will have to learn to live
with either large floorstanders or small wall-mounts.

I'd second the recommendation for a small set of 'bookshelf' speakers
mounted on a solid shelf or wall-mount.

In our kitchen I just have a set of small Tannoy Mercurys [retired from
the main hi-fi] sitting on the window ledge. Which is as secure and
solid as any wall-mounting. Even with the rear-facing ports, the sound
is fine.

Funny how you ask a simple question and it suddenly goes off at a wild
Tangent and no-one replies to the original query!

Someone did give the right advice though - go to Richer Sounds and - if
possible - have a listen. From personal experience Tangent, Gale,
Tannoy, and (personal preference) KEF are all pretty good, as are
Mourdant Short, Mission, and Monitor Audio.

Also have a look at Superfi - they do a much wider range than Richers
and are price competitive.

My ESL63's have seen three children growing up with nothing other than a
bit of jam smeared on them, so why do the speakers have to go?.

If your worried about the nipper pulling them over can't you put some
sort of retaining strap on them like we do in radio studios to stop
idiots knocking them off the speaker stands?.

Keith, I thought you said you had Phil killfiled.

So I'm confused again. But somewhat entertained.

BTW, I wish I had some money! I'd buy one of your spare valve amps! Maybe one
day.

Alas, a problem in the UK (as distinct from other juristictions like the
USA) is that it may not matter that what you said was &quot;correct&quot;. As has
been explained in 'Private Eye&quot; many times; under the UK (or more strictly,
England and Wales) libel laws, what will primarily be judged is, were the
statements &quot;damaging&quot;, not, were they &quot;correct&quot;. You also have to stump up
a lot in costs with the hope that you *might* get them back. But may not be
able to pay them beforehand, so have problems as a result of being unable
to do so.

Note also that at least one person has been using the UK libel laws
recently to impede publication of infomation they object to in the *USA*.
At least one USA-published book has apparently been pulped and withdrawn as
a result.

The Australian laws probably make more sense. But in the UK, laws are
generally made by rich lawyers, for rich lawyers, and for the clients who
pay their fees.

Slainte,

Jim

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just after small form factor and *reasonable* sound.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **No point considering Bose then. Bose can only satisfy one of those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; requirements.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **There are literally hundreds of options available, which, at worst,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perform no worse than Bose, at far lower cost. Think: 20% of the cost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and you'll be close to the mark. Bose really are THAT over-priced.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You should always look at the people behind a company and that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; company's activities in the market place.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Dr Amar Bose is one of the wealthiest individuals in the US.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Bose is a private company. It's profit and loss figures are available
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only to the US tax department.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Bose products are rarely available at *genuine* discount prices.

&gt;&gt;&gt; ** There is a Wiki on the Bose Corporation:

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose_Corporation

&gt;&gt;&gt; The parts about  &quot; Cold Fusion Research &quot;  and suing &quot; Consumer Reports
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot; magazine for publishing a bad review are entertaining.

&gt;&gt; **Wouldn't it be kinda fun to be sued by Bose? I mean, you go to court to
&gt;&gt; prove that the words uttered (on the Usenet) are correct. It is up to
&gt;&gt; Bose to prove you wrong. You could wheel out a $199.00 Chinese sat/sub
&gt;&gt; system and make the jury do a DBT on it and a $2,000.00 Bose system. Do a
&gt;&gt; frequency response run on the Bose and demonstrate exactly how bad the
&gt;&gt; thing is. Then you could force them to reveal their profit/loss
&gt;&gt; statements for the court. Then we could start looing at the issue of
&gt;&gt; retail price maintenance and how it may apply to Bose products. Of
&gt;&gt; course, it'll never happen, but we can only dream. Bose has far too much
&gt;&gt; to lose to bother litigating against people who speak the truth about
&gt;&gt; their products on the Usenet. They only go for targets who can *really*
&gt;&gt; hurt them.

&gt; OK, this goes deeper than I suspected! What happened - you applied for a
&gt; job with Bose at some point and they told you to piss off....??
">

**Why would I want to work for Bose? Bose is a company which is the precise
antithesis of high fidelity. Bose is just a (very good) marketing company
that happens to produce a range of audio/visual equipment. If they made
hamburgers, they'd be just as successful. If you want to see what else gets
up my nose about Bose, just read some of their patents sometime. They've
been granted patents for work done by Prof. Bailey and KEF, amongst others.
It is testimony to the clever patent lawyers employed by Bose and the dumb
US Patent Office that they were granted patents for their compound
enclosures and transmission line (aka: Acoustic Waveguide) enclosures.

It always makes me smile when I see people like Bose (Bill Gates et al)
being bashed by the little people for their success. AFAIAA, there
aren't many successful companies/brands that haven't had to be a bit
smart and pull a few strokes, somewhere along the line. One of the
biggest in terms of global sales that comes to mind will be that of
Suzuki whose huge success in two-stokes a few years back can be directly
attributed to their successful poaching of a certain, famous engineer
and designer from an Eastern European manufacturer - effectively
consigning that manufacturer to certain doom! (Names elude me atm, but
it is early in the week - MZ??)

My experience of Bose is limited to to almost certainly having Bose
speakers in a number of cars in the past and a nicle 'slimline' 4 way AV
centre speaker which employed the Bose form of backhorn loading and
which sounded really quite good. In fact, I wish I had it back again,
having noticed shitty/muffled dialogue with a lot of movies these days,
I'm now faced with the prospect of heaving a bloody great B&amp;W centre
speaker into the equation somehow - having got away with no centre
speaker for a while!

&gt;&gt; can purchase a Bose product and obtain a second Bose product for 'free'.

&gt;&gt; **I am. Bose are rarely available at genuine discount prices.

&gt; So what? Neither were (are?) BMW car in the UK and Volvo was in trouble

**Nope. Disgust.

The esteem I hold Bose in is pretty much on par with McDonalds. Both

**Nope. Bose hung his hat on a completely discredited theory about bouncing
sound all over the room. He marketed it cleverly and made a bundle. Since
that time, he has been knocking off other people's work (KEF, Prof Bailey,
et al), calling it by a new name, patenting the stuff and making yet more
cash from gullible consumers.

&gt;&gt; Compare him with Ray Kurzweil.  Who, had he been better with money,

&gt;&gt; rescue his company financially so he can continue making his

**Bill Gates is quite a different creature to Amar Bose. Whilst they're both
clearly excellent and talented businessmen and know how to market a product,
that is where the similarity ends. Gates has been responsible for some
genuine innovation in the software biz. Gates also knows when to dump a
concept, in favour of something which is better/more saleable/whatever. Bose
still clings to his stupid 901 concept, despite sales figures which barely
rate a mention.

Confused by this - even my brother-in-law (a Yank with the same name as
me, but spelt differently) is one of the thousands bleating about being
ripped off by Bill Gates in the past and suddenly the amazingly wealthy
Dr Bose' 'successful company' has sales figures 'barely worth a
mention'?
