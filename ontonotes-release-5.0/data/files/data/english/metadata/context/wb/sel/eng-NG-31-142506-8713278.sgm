Ethanol, schmethanol

Everyone seems to think that ethanol is a good way to make cars greener.
Everyone is wrong...

SOMETIMES you do things simply because you know how to. People have
known how to make ethanol since the dawn of civilisation, if not
before. Take some sugary liquid. Add yeast. Wait. They have also known
for a thousand years how to get that ethanol out of the formerly sugary
liquid and into a more or less pure form. You heat it up, catch the
vapour that emanates, and cool that vapour down until it liquefies.

The result burns. And when Henry Ford was experimenting with car
engines a century ago, he tried ethanol out as a fuel. But he rejected
it and for good reason. The amount of heat you get from burning a litre
of ethanol is a third less than that from a litre of petrol. What is
more, it absorbs water from the atmosphere. Unless it is mixed with
some other fuel, such as petrol, the result is corrosion that can wreck
an engine's seals in a couple of years. So why is ethanol suddenly back
in fashion? That is the question many biotechnologists in America have
recently asked themselves.

The obvious answer is that, being derived from plants, ethanol is green.
The carbon dioxide produced by burning it was recently in the
atmosphere. Putting that CO2 back into the air can therefore have no
adverse effect on the climate. But although that is true, the real
reason ethanol has become the preferred green substitute for petrol is
that people know how to make it that, and the subsidies now available to
America's maize farmers to produce the necessary feedstock. Yet such
things do not stop ethanol from being a lousy fuel. To solve that, the
biotechnologists argue, you need to make a better fuel that is equally
green. Which is what they are trying to do.

Designer petrol

The first step on the road has been butanol. This is also a type of
alcohol that can be made by fermenting sugar (though the fermentation is
done by a species of bacterium rather than by yeast), and it has some
advantages over ethanol. It has more carbon atoms in its molecules
(four, instead of two), which means more energy per litrethough it is
still only 85% as rich as petrol. It also has a lower tendency to
absorb water from the atmosphere.

A joint venture between DuPont, a large American chemical company, and
BP, a British energy firm, has worked out how to industrialise the
process of making biobutanol, as the chemical is commonly known when it
is the product of fermentation. Although BP plans to start selling the
stuff in the next few weeks (mixed with petrol, to start with), the
truth is that butanol is not all that much better than ethanol. The
interesting activity is elsewhere.

One route might be to go for yet-larger (and thus energy-richer) alcohol
molecules. Any simple alcohol is composed of a number of carbon and
hydrogen atoms (like a hydrocarbon such as petrol) together with a
single oxygen atom. In practice, this game of topping up the carbon
content to make a better fuel stops with octanol (eight carbon atoms)
as anything bigger tends to freeze at temperatures that might be
encountered in winter. But living things are familiar with alcohols.
Their enzymes are geared up to cope with them. This makes the
biotechnologists' task that much easier.

The idea of engineering enzymes to make octanol was what first brought
Codexis, a small biotechnology firm based in Redwood City, California,
into the field. Codexis's technology works with pharmaceutical
precisionindeed, one of its main commercial products is the enzyme
system for making the chemical precursor to Lipitor, a
cholesterol-lowering drug that is marketed by Pfizer. Codexis controls
most of the important patents for what is known as molecular evolution.
This designs enzymes in the way that normal evolution designs
organisms. It creates lots of variations on a theme, throws away the
ones it does not want, and shuffles the rest in a process akin to sex.
It then repeats the process on the survivors until something useful
emergesthough, unlike natural evolution, there is a bit of intelligent
design in the process, too. The result, according to Codexis's boss,
Alan Shaw, is enzymes that can perform chemical transformations unknown
in nature.

Dr Shaw, however, is no longer so interested in octanol as a biofuel.
Like two other, nearby firms, he is now focusing Codexis's attention on
molecules even more chemically similar to petrol. The twist that Codexis
brings is that unlike petrol, of which each batch from the refinery is
chemically different from the others (because the crude oil from which
it is derived is an arbitrary mixture of hydrocarbon molecules),
biopetrol could be turned out exactly the same, again and again, and
thus designed to have the optimal mixture of properties required of a
motor fuel.

Exactly which molecules Codexis is most interested in these days, Dr
Shaw is not yet willing to say. But Amyris Biotechnologies, which is
also based in California, in Emeryville, and which also started by
dabbling in drugs (in its case an antimalarial medicine called
artemisinin), is slightly more forthcoming. Under the guidance of its
founder Jay Keasling, it has been working on a type of isoprenoid (a
class of chemicals that include rubber).

Unlike Codexis, which deals in purified enzymes, Amyris employs a
technique called synthetic biology, which turns living organisms into
chemical reactors by assembling novel biochemical pathways within them.
Dr Keasling and his colleagues scour the world for suitable enzymes,
tweak them to make them work better, then sew the genes for the tweaked
enzymes into a bacterium that thus turns out the desired product. That
was how they produced artemisinin, which is also an isoprenoid.

Isoprenoids have the advantage that, like alcohols, they are part of the
natural biochemistry of many organisms. Enzymes to handle them are thus
easy to come by. They have the additional advantage that some are pure
hydrocarbons, like petrol. With a little judicious searching, Amyris
thinks it has come up with isoprenoids that have the right
characteristics to substitute for petrol.

The third Californian firm in the business, LS9 of San Carlos, is
cutting to the chase. If petrol is what is wanted, petrol is what will
be delivered. And diesel, too, although in this case the product is
actually biodiesel, which is in some ways superior to the
petroleum-based stuff.

LS9 also uses synthetic biology, but it has concentrated on controlling
the pathways that make fatty acids. Like alcohols, fatty acids are
molecules that have lots of hydrogen and carbon atoms, and a small
amount of oxygen (in their case two oxygen atoms, rather than one).
Plant oils consist of fatty acids combined with glyceroland these fatty
acids (for example, those from palm oil) are the main raw material for
the biodiesel already sold today.

LS9 has used its technology to turn microbes into factories for fatty
acids containing between eight and 20 carbon atomsthe optimal number for
biodiesel. But it also plans to make what it calls biocrude. In this
case the fatty acids would have 18-30 carbon atoms, and the final stage
of the synthetic pathway would clip off the oxygen atoms to create pure
hydrocarbons. This biocrude could be fed directly into existing oil
refineries, without any need to modify them.

These firms, however, have one other competitor. His name is Craig
Venter. Dr Venter, a veteran of biotechnological scraps ranging from
gene patenting to the private human-genome project, has been interested
in bioenergy for a long time. To start with, it was hydrogen that
caught his eye, then methaneboth of which are natural bacterial
products. But now that eye is shifting towards liquid fuels. His
company, modestly named Synthetic Genomics (and based, unlike the
others, on the east side of America, in Rockville, Maryland), is
reluctant to discuss details, but Dr Venter, too, is taken with the
pharmaceutical analogy. Indeed, he goes as far as to posit the idea of
clinical trials for biofuelspresumably pitting one against another,
perhaps with petroleum-based products acting as the control, and
without the drivers knowing which was which.

Whether biofuels will ever be competitive with fossil fuels remains to
be seen. That will depend on a mixture of economics and politics. But
the political rush to back ethanol, just because it is green and people
have heard of it, is a mistake. Let a thousand flowers bloom, and see
which one wins Dr Venter's Grand Prix.
