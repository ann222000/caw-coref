to blind the
reprobate, and sufficient clearness to condemn them and make them
inexcusable. Saint Augustine, Montaigne, Sebond.

The genealogy of Jesus Christ in the Old Testament is intermingled with so
many others that are useless that it cannot be distinguished. If Moses had
kept only the record of the ancestors of Christ, that might have been too
plain. If he had not noted that of Jesus Christ, it might not have been
sufficiently plain. But, after all, whoever looks closely sees that of Jesus

Those who ordained these sacrifices knew their uselessness; those who have
declared their uselessness, have not ceased to practise them.

If God had permitted only one religion, it has been too easily known; but
when we look at it closely, we clearly discern the truth amidst this
confusion.

reason, he would say nothing clearly which was directly against reason.

Thus all the very apparent weaknesses are strength. Example; the two
genealogies in Saint Matthew and Saint Luke. What can be clearer than that

humble pride.

582. We make an idol of truth itself; for truth apart from charity is not
God, but His image and idol, which we must neither love nor worship; and
