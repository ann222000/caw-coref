I wouldn't claim that HGW or JNH are especially &quot;innovative&quot;, and JNH
isn't
really a &quot;new&quot; composer; he's been on my radar screen for about
fifteen years
now. I'm not terribly familiar with Beltrami. Kaczmarek also doesn't
seem all
that innovative to me, although he certainly is a fresh voice in my
ears. The only
Bates score I've heard is 300, and I'm not sure that one really
counts, since
the score apparently owes more than a little to earlier work of Eliott
Goldenthal.

I was just giving examples of possibilities... nothing is written in

Bates stealing from Goldenthal, seeing (hearing) that the 300 sounds
pretty new to me.  Beltrami did some marvelous stuff for Mimic, btw.

Wow.

I only sat through TITUS once... I liked the opening with the soldiers
being drenched naked... but can't remember the music other than the
rather in appropriate contemporary stuff used during a banquet scene.
It wasn't a very perky film, and it wasn't a perky play.

Tyler Bates must be hiding under the bed right now.  Never the less,
his music for 300 works... no matter where it came from... and the
average human being (meaning none of us) isn't going to give a fig.

I guess Goldenthal and his attorneys got a cut of the pie.

Hey Three-eyes, you won't be banned.  I get frustrated by the
lack of memorable themes that the Great Silver Age
and Golden Age composers wrote.  Below is a long piece
that I wrote at another board several years ago.

I'm sick of going to movies and not hearing even ONE clearly
articulated,
well-developed theme.  (Of course, I'd like to hear two or three in a
single score.)
Guess you lucky people get to read (if interested) my rant.  It seemed
like every-
one gasped in horror when the rumor was printed that the producers of
Planet of the
Apes wanted Elfman to add an heroic theme to his score.  I kept
thinking why
not?  Why not have an heroic theme for the main character to
underscore his
rugged individualism in the face of Ape oppression, or when he rallied
the humans
to fight?  Why not use a theme similar to say Goldsmith's main theme
in
The 13th Warrior? (This was based on previews.)  Then I saw the movie,
and he
wasn't nearly as heroic as I had thought he would be.  Still, maybe
some type
of heroic theme may have emotionally manipulated me into caring a
little more
about him and others.  (Sorry, I thought the movie was lame.)  The
underscore was
serviceable and had a few repeated short motifs (a motif does NOT a
theme make),
but I didn't feel it explored any new territory nor produced anything
memorable.   I
watched Instinct the other night and felt it was a much more effective
score.  I guess
what I'm getting at is that I think it's time for MORE filmscores to
return to the use of a
notable, distinguished theme or themes.  Not for  ALL movies, but at
least some.

I'd like to ask board members these questions.  1.  How many truly
[b]memorable,[/b]
well-respected soundtracks LACK a discernible, melodic theme?    I can
think of a
few that were truly groundbreaking in their emotional resonance, and
given the
nature of their films' subjects, worked well without a melodic theme.
Two are Goldsmith's
Alien and POTA.  Shore is also an expert at subtly capturing horror
without melodic themes.
(Seven, Silence of the Lambs.)  Still I hope he is more thematic in
Lord of the Rings.
(Don't equate melodic theme with &quot;slowness&quot; or love.  Action scores
like Conan, Robo
Cop, Rambo, Jaws, Indiana Jones, etc. have melodic themes.)  2.  Do
you repeatedly
listen to non thematic, non melodic scores?  Or do you revisit
thematic scores more often?
(I just can't get that involved in 74 minutes of random notes that
never coalesce into
some type of unified pattern at least a few times during the score.)
When I think about
]5 star memorable scores, they have fully developed themes. (Ben Hur,
Conan, Mag Seven,
To Kill a Mockingbird, Best Years of Our Lives, GWTW, etc.)  I find
myself returning to
those types of scores more often.  3.  When you look over the lists of
first soundtracks most
of you purchased, they all seem thematic, not just 74 minutes of
arbitrary notes that may or
may not dovetail with the visuals. (Look at how many people were
brought into film score
adoration due to Star Wars?)

I'm not bemoaning ALL current scores.  I practically wore out Dinosaur
and Mission to Mars
last year, but again they had several interesting themes.  And I'm not
knocking synth or
acoustical scores.  Some have melodies.  I'm not screaming for a
return to the Golden Age
type scores either.  Regardless of the controversies over composers
like Zimmer and
Horner, they can both write themes that are appealing.  I'm just
frustrated and tired of
finding so little interest in this year's soundtracks.  (Don't yell at
me;maybe I'm having
a hormonal moment.)

IMHO, it is a discernible, melodic, well-developed theme that gives a
movie its emotional
underpinning, its center, its ability to be noteworthy, and I'm am
hoping that
some composers will return to thematic compositions instead of scoring
movies with
strings zigging north, woodwinds zagging south, brass zipping east,
and percussion
zippidty-do-dahing into the west.  I want the twain to meet

After reading the above which was written four years ago, the only
thing I would change is
my attitude towards some themeless scores.  I don't think solid atonal
or dissonant scores
are composed randomly. And Shore didn't disappoint me in LOTR.  He
wrote many themes.

I will add that I think I'll that memorable themes (Or hummable ones)
provide us with as
much recall to a movie as actually watching it.  I hear Gladiator's
theme in a preview,
and I recall the movie.  I hear Rudy's themes in trailers, and it is
instant recall.
Maybe it is all about recall, aural  permanent imprinting, and lasting
impressions
that a memorable theme creates

I totally agree.  We do imprint on themes just as we do on scenes.  I
can hear the first 3 notes of Rozsa's Ben-Hur overture and I know
instantly what it is!  Same with the first 3 notes of Newman's HTWWW
main title theme.  This just doesn't happen anymore, does it?

I have tried to watch the Peter Jackson King Kong 4 times and cannot
make it through.  I couldn't tell you if there is music in it or not
because, even though I have a 5.1 surround system, it just becomes a
giant blob of noise.

And the special effects nowadays?  For me, its &quot;ho-hum, CGI again!&quot;

Yep you are right, but there is a lovely

Another memorable theme is Tiomkin's

Okay.  You are old fashioned.  But there ARE great scores.  What Shore
did for the 3 LOTR films is genius.  JNH has shown incredible range in
a wide variety of films.  And I didn't start collecting Kaczmarek
after seeing Finding Neverland becayse I had a lot of extra money to
burn.  The music is out there... an it is grand and it is beautiful.
Take Miss Potter for example.  An unexpected little gem.  So... your

Peter Jackson's King Kong IS an indulgent ho-hum of a film... but
James Newton Howard DID create some beautiful music for it.  Track 7
on the disc in which the ship is tossed around (inexplicably in the
film, albeit) just outside the island is INCREDIBLE music... and the
gentle 'love theme' from the movie is simply beautiful.  But yes, it
is just a blatant CGI mess... which the Lord of the Rings is too, when
you think about it.  Sky Captian and the World of Tomorrow (which has
a rousing old fashion action score) is CGI, but it fully encorporates
the actors into that non reality whereas most of these films are just
actors walking through cartoon sets filled with cartoon monsters.

Often the only saving grace IS the score.  And we do have some very
good people writing very good scores today, new talent.  Things
change.  The days of Korngold, Rosza, and Goldsmith are gone... but
then even Goldsmith flexed his creative muscle and tried new and
different things... and was often shot down for them.  He didn't
always write 'pretty themed' music....

I agree that film music nowadays seems much more concerned with
atmospherics than with melody, and that's a problem. But I just don't
get the hatred CGI effects seem to inspire -- it's just another way of
creating impossible things onscreen. I don't get what's so inherently
preferable in, say, the stop-motion work of Ray Harryhausen over the
effects of the WETA artists. Neither looks more &quot;real&quot; to me than the
other.

ALL movies are artifice. Every single one, whether the artifice is
created

In silence think:  minor second.....pause.....minor second....pause...m2 m2
m2 m2:  Jaws...even kids know this.

It may be the greatest example of how a motive (the above is repeated in
Close Encounters at the end of the ship conversation sequence before the
door opens) is so powerful.  Another is Psycho.....also minor seconds
(homophonic instead of monophonic).

Also, everyone seems so forgiving....except to moi.....I find it an
interesting prejudice!!!!  And very hypocritical if not debasing.

The Wind and the Lion has only ONE mat painting.... the rest of the
film was done on location... no CGI.

You can tell the difference.

Years from now people will look back at this period and remark upon
the obvious CGI work.

Blade Runner was all mat paintings and miniatures... and was
masterful.

I can see what you you are trying to get at with the Harryhausen
comparison, but there was something more acceptable about that work in
its day... today's sophisticated audience is more critical and less
forgiving of what is obviously COMPUTER EVOKED.

And some films work very well with an atmospheric score, such as The
Andromeda Strain (have you seen THAT one?) or Smilla's Sense of
Snow... films done some 20-30 years apart.  Bernard Herrmann was a
very atmospheric composer as well as one that could write a 'theme'.
He was also VERY innovative in his orchestrations...

That wasn't a film that required a great deal of effects work anyway.
It
was a historical adventure/drama -- shot, by the way, not in the
mountains
of Northern Africa, but in Spain. It's still artifice.

What you're doing here, though, is remembering the hits and forgetting
the misses -- all the films from around the Bladerunner time (early
80s)
that had awful special effects which stood out like a sore thumb. One
film done well back then does not conclusively demonstrate that
effects
were so much more convincing back then than they are now. Masterful
films are getting made using CGI effects now, probably at roughly the

Why the caps? Would they be equally forgiving of herky-jerky stop-

Well yes. There are always exceptions to every generalization -- just

there are to the &quot;GAHHH, CGI!!!&quot; response. All the CGI stuff in the

films is masterful because of the story; all the CGI stuff in King

Yes it does.  It means they use to make good films without the
EXCESSIVE use of an effect that now is glaringly obvious.  Alien had
no CGI.  ALIENS even created a monster queen that was so effective you
thought they hired her out of central casting.  Today you look at the

I saw Stardust today.  Very slow for about
40 minutes; then you get sucked into a lovely
fantasy, kind of a Cinderella story.  LLan Eshken's
music was very noticeable...and very loud.  No
extended melodies or themes, but great motifs.
Loved his action music.  I will be watching this

Maybe to you. I thought that Kong in the movie was wonderfully done,
as
well done as Gollum. Other stuff got overwhelming, but that wasn't a
function
of it being CGI as it was just too much indulgent action and gore.
Again, I
suspect that you're blaming the way they did the effects for your
dislike of
the movie, when the more likely problem was that the film wasn't that
great.

And again, that Alien had no CGI means nothing. The reason it had no
CGI was because they didn't have CGI back then. (And Aliens wasn't
really
all that effective, for me. To me it was just another ugly beastie,
nothing
to write home about.) If they'd had CGI in 1979, Alien would have had
lots
of it. They didn't, so it's all models and matte shots. The idea that
effects
were somehow infinitely more convincing back in the day or models and
matte shots simply doesn't withstand scrutiny.

I am offended!  You debase this news group!  I happen to be a card
carrying member of MIRS (inc.) and I support their cause and anti-CGI
attitude.  Men In Rubber Suits have been put out of business ever
since this computer effects became popular and it is a travesty!
Travesty, I say!  And I am sorry YOU did not like Alien or Blade
Runner which have become iconic films in the passing years.  I don't
like The Matrix.

And I am priddier than you, too.

So there.

Me either, although it did take me several viewings of The Matrix
before
I realized how empty it is. As for the other two, I don't see what's
so
iconic about Alien -- they've been making &quot;Things that go bump in
the night&quot; movies since way before 1979, and all Alien really brought
to the table was an SFnal setting and some interesting looking
splatter.
And Bladerunner's iconic status springs from its admittedly stunning
visuals, but the story's not terribly involving. (I will probably give
it
another chance this winter when Director's Cut Number Nine comes
out.)
