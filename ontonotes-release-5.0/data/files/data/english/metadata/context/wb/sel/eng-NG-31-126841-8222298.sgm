Ship of fools
Johann Hari sets sail with America's swashbuckling neocons
The Iraq war has been an amazing success, global warming is  just a myth –
and as for Guantanamo Bay, it's practically a holiday camp... The  annual cruise
organised by the 'National Review', mouthpiece of right-wing  America, is a
parallel universe populated by  straight-talking, gun-toting, God-fearing
Republicans.
By Johann Hari
Published: 13 July 2007

I am standing waist-deep in the Pacific Ocean, both chilling and burning,
indulging in the polite chit-chat beloved by vacationing Americans. A sweet
elderly lady from Los Angeles is sitting on the rocks nearby, telling me
dreamily about her son. &quot;Is he your only child?&quot; I ask. &quot;Yes,&quot; she says. &quot;Do you
have a child back in England?&quot; she asks. No, I say. Her face darkens. &quot;You'd
better start,&quot; she says. &quot;The Muslims are breeding. Soon, they'll have the whole
of Europe.&quot;
I am getting used to these moments – when gentle holiday geniality bleeds
into... what? I lie on the beach with Hillary-Ann, a chatty, scatty 35-year-old
Californian designer. As she explains the perils of Republican dating, my
mind  drifts, watching the gentle tide. When I hear her say, &quot; Of course, we need
to  execute some of these people,&quot; I wake up. Who do we need to execute? She
runs  her fingers through the sand lazily. &quot;A few of these prominent liberals
who are  trying to demoralise the country,&quot; she says. &quot;Just take a couple of
these  anti-war people off to the gas chamber for treason to show, if you try
to bring  down America at a time of war, that's what you'll get.&quot; She squints
at the sun  and smiles. &quot; Then things'll change.&quot;
I am travelling on a bright white cruise ship with two restaurants, five
bars, a casino – and 500 readers of the National Review. Here, the Iraq war has
been &quot;an amazing success&quot;. Global warming is not happening. The solitary black
person claims, &quot;If the Ku Klux Klan supports equal rights, then God bless
them.&quot;  And I have nowhere to run.
From time to time, National Review – the bible of American conservatism –
organises a cruise for its readers. I paid $1,200 to join them. The rules I
imposed on myself were simple: If any of the conservative cruisers asked who I
was, I answered honestly, telling them I was a journalist. Mostly, I just
tried  to blend in – and find out what American conservatives say when they think
the  rest of us aren't listening.
I. From sweet to suicide bomber
I arrive at the dockside in San Diego on Saturday afternoon and stare up at
the Oosterdam, our home for the next seven days. Filipino boat hands are
loading  trunks into the hull and wealthy white folk are gliding onto its polished
boards  with pale sun parasols dangling off their arms.
The Reviewers have been told to gather for a cocktail reception on the Lido,
near the very top of the ship. I arrive to find a tableau from Gone With the
Wind, washed in a thousand shades of grey. Southern belles – aged and pinched
–  are flirting with old conservative warriors. The etiquette here is
different  from anything I have ever seen. It takes me 15 minutes to realise what is
wrong  with this scene. There are no big hugs, no warm kisses. This is a place
of  starchy handshakes. Men approach each other with stiffened spines,
puffed-out  chests and crunching handshakes. Women are greeted with a single kiss on
the  cheek. Anything more would be French.
I adjust and stiffly greet the first man I see. He is a judge, with the
craggy self-important charm that slowly consumes any judge. He is from Canada,  he
declares (a little more apologetically), and is the founding president of
&quot;Canadians Against Suicide Bombing&quot;. Would there be many members of &quot;Canadians
for Suicide Bombing?&quot; I ask. Dismayed, he suggests that yes, there would.
A bell rings somewhere, and we are all beckoned to dinner. We have been
assigned random seats, which will change each night. We will, the publicity pack
promises, each dine with at least one National Review speaker during our trip.

To my left, I find a middle-aged Floridian with a neat beard. To my right are
two elderly New Yorkers who look and sound like late-era Dorothy Parkers,
minus  the alcohol poisoning. They live on Park Avenue, they explain in precise
Northern tones. &quot;You must live near the UN building,&quot; the Floridian says to
one  of the New York ladies after the entree is served. Yes, she responds,
shaking  her head wearily. &quot;They should suicide-bomb that place,&quot; he says. They
all  chuckle gently. How did that happen? How do you go from sweet to
suicide-bomb in  six seconds?
The conversation ebbs back to friendly chit-chat. So, you're a European, one
of the Park Avenue ladies says, before offering witty commentaries on the
cities  she's visited. Her companion adds, &quot;I went to Paris, and it was so
lovely.&quot; Her  face darkens: &quot;But then you think – it's surrounded by Muslims.&quot; The
first lady  nods: &quot;They're out there, and they're coming.&quot; Emboldened, the
bearded Floridian  wags a finger and says, &quot;Down the line, we're not going to bail
out the French  again.&quot; He mimes picking up a phone and shouts into it, &quot;I
can't hear you,  Jacques! What's that? The Muslims are doing what to you? I
can't hear you!&quot;
Now that this barrier has been broken – everyone agrees the Muslims are
devouring the French, and everyone agrees it's funny – the usual suspects are
quickly rounded up. Jimmy Carter is &quot;almost a traitor&quot;. John McCain is &quot;crazy&quot;
because of &quot;all that torture&quot;. One of the Park Avenue ladies declares that she
gets on her knees every day to &quot; thank God for Fox News&quot;. As the wine reaches
the Floridian, he announces, &quot;This cruise is the best money I ever spent.&quot;
They rush through the Rush-list of liberals who hate America, who want her to
fail, and I ask them – why are liberals like this? What's their motivation?
They  stutter to a halt and there is a long, puzzled silence. &quot; It's a good
question,&quot;  one of them, Martha, says finally. I have asked them to peer into
the minds of  cartoons and they are suddenly, reluctantly confronted with the
hollowness of  their creation. &quot;There have always been intellectuals who want to
tell people  how to live,&quot; Martha adds, to an almost visible sense of relief.
That's it – the  intellectuals! They are not like us. Dave changes the
subject, to wash away this  moment of cognitive dissonance. &quot;The liberals don't
believe in the constitution.  They don't believe in what the founders wanted – a
strong executive,&quot; he  announces, to nods. A Filipino waiter offers him a
top-up of his wine, and he  mock-whispers to me, &quot;They all look the same! Can you
tell them apart?&quot; I stare  out to sea. How long would it take me to drown?
II. &quot;We're doing an excellent job killing them.&quot;
The Vista Lounge is a Vegas-style showroom, with glistening gold edges and
the desperate optimism of an ageing Cha-Cha girl. Today, the scenery has been
cleared away – &quot;I always sit at the front in these shows to see if the girls
are  really pretty and on this ship they are ug-lee,&quot; I hear a Reviewer mutter –
and  our performers are the assorted purveyors of conservative show tunes,
from  Podhoretz to Steyn. The first of the trip's seminars is a discussion
intended to  exhume the conservative corpse and discover its cause of death on the
black,  black night of 7 November, 2006, when the treacherous Democrats took
control of  the US Congress.
There is something strange about this discussion, and it takes me a few
moments to realise exactly what it is. All the tropes that conservatives usually
deny in public – that Iraq is another Vietnam, that Bush is fighting a class
war  on behalf of the rich – are embraced on this shining ship in the middle of
the  ocean. Yes, they concede, we are fighting another Vietnam; and this time
we  won't let the weak-kneed liberals lose it. &quot;It's customary to say we lost
the  Vietnam war, but who's 'we'?&quot; the writer Dinesh D'Souza asks angrily.
&quot;The left  won by demanding America's humiliation.&quot; On this ship, there are no
Viet Cong,  no three million dead. There is only liberal treachery. Yes,
D'Souza says, in a  swift shift to domestic politics, &quot;of course&quot; Republican
politics is &quot;about  class. Republicans are the party of winners, Democrats are the
party of losers.&quot;
The panel nods, but it doesn't want to stray from Iraq. Robert Bork, Ronald
Reagan's one-time nominee to the Supreme Court, mumbles from beneath
low-hanging  jowls: &quot;The coverage of this war is unbelievable. Even Fox News is
unbelievable.  You'd think we're the only ones dying. Enemy casualties aren't
covered. We're  doing an excellent job killing them.&quot;
Then, with a judder, the panel runs momentarily aground. Rich Lowry, the
preppy, handsome 38-year-old editor of National Review, says, &quot;The American
public isn't concluding we're losing in Iraq for any irrational reason. They're
looking at the cold, hard facts.&quot; The Vista Lounge is, as one, perplexed. Lowry
continues, &quot;I wish it was true that, because we're a superpower, we can't
lose.  But it's not.&quot;
No one argues with him. They just look away, in the same manner that people
avoid glancing at a crazy person yelling at a bus stop. Then they return to
hyperbole and accusations of treachery against people like their editor. The
ageing historian Bernard Lewis – who was deputed to stiffen Dick Cheney's spine
in the run-up to the war – declares, &quot;The election in the US is being seen
by  [the bin Ladenists] as a victory on a par with the collapse of the Soviet
Union.  We should be prepared for whatever comes next.&quot; This is why the guests
paid up  to $6,000. This is what they came for. They give him a wheezing,
stooping  ovation and break for coffee.
A fracture-line in the lumbering certainty of American conservatism is
opening right before my eyes. Following the break, Norman Podhoretz and William
Buckley – two of the grand old men of the Grand Old Party – begin to feud.
Podhoretz will not stop speaking – &quot;I have lots of ex-friends on the left; it
looks like I'm going to have some ex-friends on the right, too,&quot; he rants –and
Buckley says to the chair, &quot; Just take the mike, there's no other way.&quot; He
says  it with a smile, but with heavy eyes.
Podhoretz and Buckley now inhabit opposite poles of post-September 11
American conservatism, and they stare at wholly different Iraqs. Podhoretz is  the
Brooklyn-born, street-fighting kid who travelled through a long phase of
left-liberalism to a pugilistic belief in America's power to redeem the world,  one
bomb at a time. Today, he is a bristling grey ball of aggression, here to
declare that the Iraq war has been &quot;an amazing success.&quot; He waves his fist and
declaims: &quot;There were WMD, and they were shipped to Syria ... This picture of
a  country in total chaos with no security is false. It has been a triumph. It
couldn't have gone better.&quot; He wants more wars, and fast. He is &quot;certain&quot;
Bush  will bomb Iran, and &quot; thank God&quot; for that.
Buckley is an urbane old reactionary, drunk on doubts. He founded the
National Review in 1955 – when conservatism was viewed in polite society as a
mental affliction – and he has always been sceptical of appeals to &quot; the  people,&quot;
preferring the eternal top-down certainties of Catholicism. He united  with
Podhoretz in mutual hatred of Godless Communism, but, slouching into his
eighties, he possesses a world view that is ill-suited for the fight to bring
democracy to the Muslim world. He was a ghostly presence on the cruise at first,
appearing only briefly to shake a few hands. But now he has emerged, and he is
fighting.
&quot;Aren't you embarrassed by the absence of these weapons?&quot; Buckley snaps at
Podhoretz. He has just explained that he supported the war reluctantly, because
Dick Cheney convinced him Saddam Hussein had WMD primed to be fired. &quot;No,&quot;
Podhoretz replies. &quot;As I say, they were shipped to Syria. During Gulf War I,
the  entire Iraqi air force was hidden in the deserts in Iran.&quot; He says he is
&quot;heartbroken&quot; by this &quot; rise of defeatism on the right.&quot; He adds, apropos of
nothing, &quot;There was nobody better than Don Rumsfeld. This defeatist talk only
contributes to the impression we are losing, when I think we're winning.&quot; The
audience cheers Podhoretz. The nuanced doubts of Bill Buckley leave them
confused. Doesn't he sound like the liberal media? Later, over dinner, a
tablemate from Denver calls Buckley &quot;a coward&quot;. His wife nods and says, &quot;  Buckley's
an old man,&quot; tapping her head with her finger to suggest dementia.
I decide to track down Buckley and Podhoretz separately and ask them for
interviews. Buckley is sitting forlornly in his cabin, scribbling in a notebook.
In 2005, at an event celebrating National Review's 50th birthday, President
Bush  described today's American conservatives as &quot;Bill's children&quot;. I ask him
if he  feels like a parent whose kids grew up to be serial killers. He smiles
slightly,  and his blue eyes appear to twinkle. Then he sighs, &quot;The answer is
no. Because  what animated the conservative core for 40 years was the Soviet
menace, plus the  rise of dogmatic socialism. That's pretty well gone.&quot;
This does not feel like an optimistic defence of his brood, but it's a theme
he returns to repeatedly: the great battles of his life are already won.
Still,  he ruminates over what his old friend Ronald Reagan would have made of
Iraq. &quot;I  think the prudent Reagan would have figured here, and the prudent
Reagan would  have shunned a commitment of the kind that we are now engaged in... I
think he  would have attempted to find some sort of assurance that any
exposure by the  United States would be exposure to a challenge the dimensions of
which we could  predict.&quot; Lest liberals be too eager to adopt the Gipper as one
of their own,  Buckley agrees approvingly that Reagan's approach would have
been to &quot;find a  local strongman&quot; to rule Iraq.
A few floors away, Podhoretz tells me he is losing his voice, &quot;which will
make some people very happy&quot;. Then he croaks out the standard-issue Wolfowitz
line about how, after September 11, the United States had to introduce
democracy  to the Middle East in order to change the political culture that produced
the  mass murderers. For somebody who declares democracy to be his goal, he is
remarkably blasé about the fact that 80 per cent of Iraqis want US troops to
leave their country, according to the latest polls. &quot;I don't much care,&quot; he
says, batting the question away. He goes on to insist that &quot;nobody was
tortured  in Abu Ghraib or Guantanamo&quot; and that Bush is &quot;a hero&quot;. He is, like most
people  on this cruise, certain the administration will attack Iran.
Podhoretz excitedly talks himself into a beautiful web of words, vindicating
his every position. He fumes at Buckley, George Will and the other apostate
conservatives who refuse to see sense. He announces victory. And for a moment,
here in the Mexican breeze, it is as though a thousand miles away Baghdad is
not  bleeding. He starts hacking and coughing painfully. I offer to go to the
ship  infirmary and get him some throat sweets, and – locked in eternal
fighter-mode –  he looks thrown, as though this is an especially cunning punch. Is
this random  act of kindness designed to imbalance him? &quot; I'm fine,&quot; he says,
glancing  contemptuously at the Bill Buckley book I am carrying. &quot;I'll keep on
shouting  through the soreness.&quot;
III. The Ghosts of Conservatism Past
The ghosts of Conservatism past are wandering this ship. From the pool, I see
John O'Sullivan, a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher. And one morning on
the  deck I discover Kenneth Starr, looking like he has stepped out of a
long-forgotten 1990s news bulletin waving Monica's stained blue dress. His face  is
round and unlined, like an immense, contented baby. As I stare at him, all my
repressed bewilderment rises, and I ask – Mr Starr, do you feel ashamed
that, as  Osama bin Laden plotted to murder American citizens, you brought the
American  government to a stand-still over a few consensual blow jobs? Do you
ever lie  awake at night wondering if a few more memos on national security would
have  reached the President's desk if he wasn't spending half his time
dealing with  your sexual McCarthyism?
He smiles through his teeth and – in his soft somnambulant voice – says in
perfect legalese, &quot;I am entirely at rest with the process. The House of
Representatives worked its will, the Senate worked its will, the Chief Justice  of
the United States presided. The constitutional process worked admirably.&quot;
It's an oddly meek defence, and the more I challenge him, the more legalistic
he becomes. Every answer is a variant on &quot;it's not my fault&quot; . First, he
says  Clinton should have settled early on in Jones vs Clinton. Then he blames
Jimmy  Carter. &quot;This critique really should be addressed to the now-departed,
moribund  independent counsel provisions. The Ethics and Government [provisions]
ushered  in during President Carter's administration has an extraordinarily
low threshold  for launching a special prosecutor...&quot;
Enough – I see another, more intriguing ghost. Ward Connerly is the only
black person in the National Review posse, a 67-year-old Louisiana-born
businessman, best known for leading conservative campaigns against affirmative  action
for black people. Earlier, I heard him saying the Republican Party has  been
&quot;too preoccupied with... not ticking off the blacks&quot;, and a cooing white
couple wandered away smiling, &quot;If he can say it, we can say it.&quot; What must it be
like to be a black man shilling for a magazine that declared at the height of
the civil rights movement that black people &quot;tend to revert to savagery&quot;, and
should be given the vote only &quot;when they stop eating each other&quot;?
I drag him into the bar, where he declines alcohol. He tells me plainly about
his childhood – his mother died when he was four, and he was raised by his
grandparents – but he never really becomes animated until I ask him if it is
true he once said, &quot;If the KKK supports equal rights, then God bless them.&quot; He
leans forward, his palms open. There are, he says, &quot; those who condemn the
Klan  based on their past without seeing the human side of it, because they
don't want  to be in the wrong, politically correct camp, you know... Members of
the Ku Klux  Klan are human beings, American citizens – they go to a place to
eat, nobody  asks them 'Are you a Klansmember?', before we serve you here.
They go to buy  groceries, nobody asks, 'Are you a Klansmember?' They go to vote
for Governor,  nobody asks 'Do you know that that person is a Klansmember?'
Only in the context  of race do they ask that. And I'm supposed to instantly
say, 'Oh my God, they  are Klansmen? Geez, I don't want their support.'&quot;
This empathy for Klansmen first bubbled into the public domain this year when
Connerly was leading an anti-affirmative action campaign in Michigan. The
KKK  came out in support of him – and he didn't decline it. I ask if he really
thinks  it is possible the KKK made this move because they have become
converted to the  cause of racial equality. &quot;I think that the reasoning that a Klan
member goes  through is – blacks are getting benefits that I'm not getting. It's
reverse  discrimination. To me it's all discrimination. But the Klansmen is
going through  the reasoning that this is benefiting blacks, they are getting
things that I  don't get... A white man doesn't have a chance in this country.&quot;

He becomes incredibly impassioned imagining how they feel, ventriloquising
them with a shaking fist – &quot;The Mexicans are getting these benefits, the
coloureds or niggers, whatever they are saying, are getting these benefits, and  I
as a white man am losing my country.&quot;
But when I ask him to empathise with the black victims of Hurricane Katrina,
he offers none of this vim. No, all Katrina showed was &quot;the dysfunctionality
that is evident in many black neighbourhoods,&quot; he says flatly, and that has
to  be &quot;tackled by black people, not the government. &quot; Ward, do you ever worry
you  are siding with people who would have denied you a vote – or would hang
you by a  rope from a tree?
&quot;I don't gather strength from what others think – no at all,&quot; he says.
&quot;Whether they are in favour or opposed. I can walk down these halls and, say, a
hundred people say, 'Oh we just adore you', and I'll be polite and I'll say
'thank you', but it doesn't register or have any effect on me.&quot; There is a
gaggle of Reviewers waiting to tell him how refreshing it is to &quot;finally&quot; hear a
black person &quot;speaking like this&quot;. I leave him to their white, white garlands.
IV. &quot;You're going to get fascists rising up, aren't you? Why hasn't that
happened already?&quot;
The nautical counter-revolution has docked in the perfectly-yellow sands of
Puerto Vallarta in Mexico, and the Reviewers are clambering overboard into the
Latino world they want to wall off behind a thousand-mile fence. They carry
notebooks from the scribblings they made during the seminar teaching them
&quot;How  To Shop in Mexico&quot;. Over breakfast, I forgot myself and said I was
considering  setting out to find a local street kid who would show me round the
barrios – the  real Mexico. They gaped. &quot;Do you want to die?&quot; one asked.
The Reviewers confine their Mexican jaunt to covered markets and walled-off
private fortresses like the private Nikki Beach. Here, as ever, they want
Mexico  to be a dispenser of cheap consumer goods and lush sands – not a place
populated  by (uck) Mexicans. Dinesh D'Souza announced as we entered Mexican seas
what he  calls &quot;D'Souza's law of immigration&quot;: &quot; The quality of an immigrant
is inversely  proportional to the distance travelled to get to the United
States.&quot;
In other words: Latinos suck.
I return for dinner with my special National Review guest: Kate O'Beirne.
She's an impossibly tall blonde with the voice of a 1930s screwball star and the
arguments of a 1890s Victorian patriarch. She inveighs against feminism and
&quot;women who make the world worse&quot; in quick quips.
As I enter the onboard restaurant she is sitting among adoring Reviewers with
her husband Jim, who announces that he is Donald Rumsfeld's personnel
director.  &quot;People keep asking what I'm doing here, with him being fired and all,&quot;
he says.  &quot;But the cruise has been arranged for a long time.&quot;
The familiar routine of the dinners – first the getting-to-know-you
chit-chat, then some light conversational fascism – is accelerating. Tonight  there is
explicit praise for a fascist dictator before the entree has arrived. I  drop
into the conversation the news that there are moves in Germany to have
Donald Rumsfeld extradited to face torture charges.
A red-faced man who looks like an egg with a moustache glued on grumbles, &quot;
If the Germans think they can take responsibility for the world, I don't care
about German courts. Bomb them.&quot; I begin to witter on about the Pinochet
precedent, and Kate snaps, &quot;Treating Don Rumsfeld like Pinochet is disgusting.&quot;
Egg Man pounds his fist on the table: &quot; Treating Pinochet like that is
disgusting. Pinochet is a hero. He saved Chile.&quot;
&quot;Exactly,&quot; adds Jim. &quot;And he privatised social security.&quot;
The table nods solemnly and then they march into the conversation – the
billion-strong swarm of swarthy Muslims who are poised to take over the world.
Jim leans forward and says, &quot;When I see these football supporters from England,
I think – these guys aren't going to be told by PC elites to be nice to
Muslims.  You're going to get fascists rising up, aren't you? Why isn't that
happening  already?&quot; Before I can answer, he is conquering the Middle East from his
table,  from behind a crème brûlée.
&quot;The civilised countries should invade all the oil-owning places in the
Middle East and run them properly. We won't take the money ourselves, but we'll
manage it so the money isn't going to terrorists.&quot;
The idea that Europe is being &quot;taken over&quot; by Muslims is the unifying theme
of this cruise. Some people go on singles cruises. Some go on ballroom dancing
cruises. This is the &quot;The Muslims Are Coming&quot; cruise – drinks included.
Because  everyone thinks it. Everyone knows it. Everyone dreams it. And the man
responsible is sitting only a few tables down: Mark Steyn.
He is wearing sunglasses on top of his head and a bright, bright shirt that
fits the image of the disk jockey he once was. Sitting in this sea of grey, it
has an odd effect – he looks like a pimp inexplicably hanging out with the
apostles of colostomy conservatism.
Steyn's thesis in his new book, America Alone, is simple: The &quot;European
races&quot; i.e., white people – &quot;are too self-absorbed to breed,&quot; but the Muslims  are
multiplying quickly. The inevitable result will be &quot; large-scale evacuation
operations circa 2015&quot; as Europe is ceded to al Qaeda and &quot;Greater France
remorselessly evolve[s] into Greater Bosnia.&quot;
He offers a light smearing of dubious demographic figures – he needs to turn
20 million European Muslims into more than 150 million in nine years, which
is a  lot of humping.
But facts, figures, and doubt are not on the itinerary of this cruise. With
one or two exceptions, the passengers discuss &quot;the Muslims&quot; as a homogenous,
sharia-seeking block – already with near-total control of Europe. Over the
week,  I am asked nine times – I counted – when I am fleeing Europe's
encroaching  Muslim population for the safety of the United States of America.
At one of the seminars, a panelist says anti-Americanism comes from both
directions in a grasping pincer movement – &quot;The Muslims condemn us for being
decadent; the Europeans condemn us for not being decadent enough.&quot; Midge Decter,
Norman Podhoretz's wife, yells, &quot;The Muslims are right, the Europeans are
wrong!&quot; And, instantly, Jay Nordlinger, National Review's managing editor and
the panel's chair, says, &quot; I'm afraid a lot of the Europeans are Muslim,
Midge.&quot;
The audience cheers. Somebody shouts, &quot;You tell 'em, Jay!&quot; He tells 'em.
Decter tells 'em. Steyn tells 'em.
On this cruise, everyone tells 'em – and, thanks to my European passport,
tells me.
V. From cruise to cruise missiles?
I am back in the docks of San Diego watching these tireless champions of the
overdog filter past and say their starchy, formal goodbyes. As Bernard Lewis
disappears onto the horizon, I wonder about the connections between this
cruise  and the cruise missiles fired half a world away.
I spot the old lady from the sea looking for her suitcase, and stop to tell
her I may have found a solution to her political worries about both Muslims
and  stem-cells.
&quot;Couldn't they just do experiments on Muslim stem-cells?&quot; I ask. &quot; Hey –
that's a great idea!&quot; she laughs, and vanishes. Hillary-Ann stops to say she is
definitely going on the next National Review cruise, to Alaska. &quot;Perfect!&quot; I
yell, finally losing my mind.
&quot;You can drill it as you go!&quot; She puts her arms around me and says very
sweetly, &quot;We need you on every cruise.&quot;
As I turn my back on the ship for the last time, the Judge I met on my first
night places his arm affectionately on my shoulder. &quot;We have written off
Britain  to the Muslims,&quot; he says. &quot;Come to America.&quot;
