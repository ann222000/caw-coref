I'm hoping someone reads this note who may know the formula used to create
Heywood Wakefield's classic Blonde finish. I know there are small shops
around the country that handle this kind of thing, but the nearest shop for
that kind of thing is 400+ miles away. If you know what it might be, please
email me at Jeff_ ... @yahoo.com.

Thanks

fully intend to keep. All reposnse will be kept in confidence.
