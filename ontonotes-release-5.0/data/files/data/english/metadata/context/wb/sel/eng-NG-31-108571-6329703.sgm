I have a Garmin SP330 glass-mounted "near" the top of the windshield.
Its view is probably restricted to 15 degrees behind me.

While driving north on I95 from Richmond to Dumfries, I lost signal.
Putting the unit on the forward dash helped lots.  I attributed this
to either the poor southerly view or to being near Quantico and DC.

2 days later, driving south on I95, I had no signal until near
Richmond.  Moving to the dash didn't help.  The unit came to life
around Richmond.  There is no technical screen, but the cell phone bar
style graph showed 0 bars from Dumfries, then to 3 (of 5) just south
of Richmond.  Some 20 miles into North Carolina, I got back to the
usual solid green for 5 bars.

Is the answer an external antenna?  Is  there some reason that I am
seeing apparent weak signal problems otherwise?  I have had the same
thing happen twice before, in South Carolina, when driving almost
directly south.

Thanks in advance,

George

I don't have or use a c330 but it sounds like you're having an issue
with signal masking.  Are any of the windows in the car tinted or UV
shielded?  That can be an issue.

An external antenna would certainly be of some help and the advantage of
being to move it around and find a "sweet spot" for will get around a
lot of issues.

On the magnetic mounted antennas (most of them are) I have put them on
the car roof above my head and just back from the windshield trim.  Then
the coax can dropped down along the door jam a ways, across the back of
the dash, and to the receiver (on the dash assumed).

A couple of pieces of tape will hold the coax in place if needed and the
rubber seals won't hurt the coax.  Try to avoid any sharp bends in the
coax of course.

I use a GA 25BNC Remote Antenna with my GPS-V.  That model has a BNC
connector but there is also the GA 25MCX Remote Antenna with MCX
connector.  Take your choice from GPSCentral.ca for ~$32 Canadian.  It
makes a huge difference when traveling by car.  It is magnetic so I just
plop it on the roof between the sunroof and windshield and run the co-ax
through the forward space with the open door.  The cable is quite thin
so there is no harm to either door seals or cable.

I even use it in the pocket of a Tilley-like hat when hiking.  As well
as greatly improving reception, I can then put the GPS in a pocket
instead of holding it.
