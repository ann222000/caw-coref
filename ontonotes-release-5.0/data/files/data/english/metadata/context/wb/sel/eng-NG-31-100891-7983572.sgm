Art and Tar are used to getting their pics taken so their photos are
clearer.

Doowie, Fhean and Behn only arrived yesterday and these are their first
photos and the first time in the bath, they were quite nervous so I diffused
the flash. Poor Doowie really didn't like the bath.

Behn is the smallest and fastest, I'm amazed he stayed still long enough for
me to get his photo.

Fhean (the rex) is the most handlable of the three young ones, Ben is very
fast and Doowey is
still pretty shy, with Doowey being a Dumbo and a bit shy the poor guy often
looks so sad.
They haven't quite worked out fingers from food yet, LOL. None of them are
biters they just genuinely get a bit mixed up.

Ah, do all dumbo rats look that sad?

I had friends over today who visit everyweek. They always bring a treat for
Art and Tar,
next week they will bring treats for all 5.
Art and Tar get to run about the living room while my friends visit and love
the extra attention.
Fhean has a new habit, when I pick him up he runs straight up to my mouth
and digs until I open it.

Last night I decided playtime with the young ones would no longer be in the
bath, it's just not safe,
Doowie jumps up the side of the bath to get out, Behn runs up my arm and
Fhean is the most amazing jumper,
he stands in the middle of the bath and springs into the air.
Playtime for the little ones is now in the hall with towels blocking the
gaps under the doors (Behn is tiny)

Young ratties are so full of life. I've got three that are now 3.5
months old. I love their natural spring and hop in their step. :)
Next Monday, I'm bringing home 2 4 week old babies. I can't wait!!
