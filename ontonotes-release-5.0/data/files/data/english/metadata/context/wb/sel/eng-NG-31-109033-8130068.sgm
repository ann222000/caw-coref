What's so inherently bad about overhanging main gun designs (I presume this
means the gun overhangs the hull)? I've read on wikipedia that the Germans
didn't like to have overhanging main guns but why?

On another note did the Germans ever consider fitting the semi-automatic 7.5
cm Rheinmetall-Borsig KwK 42 (L/70) to the Pz. IV's? I know it's a longer
gun than even the 7.5 cm KwK 40 L/48 but if it isn't substantially heavier
why couldn't they just retain the huge muzzle brake and add a larger mantlet
(so that the longer barrel would fit)?

Having a gun barrel overhanging the front of the tank by a large
amount makes it hard to traverse in urban or forested environments,
and can also result in excessive wearing of the front track wheels.
There are several instances during WWII where Shermans were able to
approach Panthers from the side or rear to point blank range because
the German tank could not traverse their turret around to fire at the
US tank due to trees or buildings.

The Panther's gun was much heavier than the L48 used in the PzKw IVH
and later models, and probably wouldn't fit within the lower turret of
the Pz IV either.  Compare the Panther's turret to the PzKw IV; the
latter tank's turret is much flatter than the Panther's, no doubt due
to the gun.

They did if you count the PzJgr IV with the Panther gun.

If you're talking about the Pz IV tank, my guess is they may have thought
about it but realized that the L/70 gun weighed more (how much more I don't
know).  The recoil strokes of the L/48 and L/70 guns must've been pretty
close to the same because both the Pz IV (all models) and the Pz V had the
same diameter turret ring (165 cm) so the turret on the IV would not have
had to have been enlarged.   A heavier gun would've placed more stress on
the mantlet so they would've had to enlarge/strengthen the mantlet to take
the added weight not only of the gun but the larger trunnions.  Added weight
would've placed more stress on the powertrain and suspension (not to mention
increasing the ground pressure--thus maneuverability)  so they both would've
had to have been strengthened (a larger engine and transmission would've
probably necessitated lengthening/widening the hull). Every improvement (in
this case, increasing gun length) has a ripple effect.

As far as overhang goes, the IVH had an overhang of 113 cm whereas all
Panther models had an overhang of 198 cm.  The further the gun sticks out
the more weight (albeit not that much) is placed on the front of the tank --
this added weight affects not only the drive sprockets and transmission but
also the center of gravity and thus maneuverability.  The PzJgr IV with the
L/70 gun was very nose heavy making it very difficult to steer, especially
on rough terrain.

I hope this helps.

Thanks for the info John.

So, basically, the issue is that the PzKw IV had a thinner turret than the
Panther?

Couldn't they offset the heavier gun w/some sort of counterweight like the
later
Shermans had?

My other post hasn't shown yet, but others have hit most of the
points.

That KwK 42 was nearly as heavy as the US M3 90mm,
heavier than the US 76mm, 3&quot; or UK 17pdr.
Mk IV had a narrower turret ring 62&quot; vs 69&quot; for the M4 series

need room for the loader to swing rounds into the breech,
and for the tube to recoil, unless you go with the fixed recoil
that quickly would damage the turret ring

the Mk IV chassis was getting overloaded with the L48 gun
as it was, widening it defeats the purpose, adds in even more weight
for a bigger hull, and might as well make a whole new tank,
and call it Panther than continue to work with the hard to mass
produce Mk IV with the sponsons pushed out over the trackruns.

Leaving the hull alone and moving the heavy gun forward,
beyond the turret ring like the  US TDs and Soviets did,
means a lot of counterweight.
The M10 had huge cast weights bolted to the rear, nearly two
tons, while the better designed M36 ended up with the bustle
being 4&quot; thick around the ready ammo

so my guess that the L70 would add 3 tons to the Mk IV,
plus the weight of the wider 'ostfront' tracks to keep ground pressure
reasonable, and need to be geared down like the Brümbar, as
the weight would be similar, to stay somewhat reliable
mechanically. Still would be slow firing, the Firefly lost half of
the ROF going from the 75mm to 17pdr in the original small
M4 turret. Not sounding like much advantage of the Panther.

The US had started to use concentric recoil setups that took up
less interior space with the T26 and M24. The Nazis didn't get
the bugs worked out of theirs before the war ended. Besides
less space, it was lighter, allowed bigger guns to be fitted
where they couldn't have been before. So that the T26 turret
wasn't much larger than the T23 on the M4A3, but could
mount the 90mm without cramping the loader with the
Pershing

Wouldn't the fact the semi-automatic 7.5 cm Rheinmetall-Borsig KwK 42 (L/70)
was semi-automatic increase the
firing rate over the 7.5 cm KwK 40 L/48?

Thanks for the analysis Mike.

Not really, all the US tank guns were semi-automatic, ejecting the
case on firing. the 75 and 76mm were 20 rpm, 3&quot; 15, 17 pdr 10
and 90mm 8 rounds per minute.

The size and weight of the round, followed by the location of the
ready
rounds, determined the ROF, as long as the loader didn't tire:
not as much with the ejection.

The 3&quot; round was only a couple inches longer, and a few pound
more than the 76mm, but 5rpm less.

Long, heavy rounds just were harder to swing around in a turret.
the M4 was extra roomy with the 75mm

Part of the reason the M4 burned when hit, was large amounts
of ammo in readyrack, around the turret basket.

It was not 'semi-automatic' in the sense of being self-loading as in a
semi-automatic rifle. It had a semi-automatic breech, which means that
the breech closed and was ready to fire when the round was inserted.
But the loader still had to physically choose the round called for by
the tank commander, turn and present it to the breech, and shove it in
to complete the loading cycle (when the cartridge rim tripped a cam
that activated the closing of the breech).

Which is exactly the same mechanism as the 7.5cm KwK 40.  :)

So the problem - in addition to the ones already touched on about
weight, balance, recoil stroke distance, and so on, was that there
wasn't sufficient room for the loader to operate with the longer,
heavier rounds, in the smaller Panzer IV turret, even if somehow the
piece could have been shoehorned in.
