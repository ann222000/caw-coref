Another Elian? Custody fight gears up

By LAURA WIDES-MUNOZ, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 12 minutes ago

A Cuban father allowed his young daughter to emigrate legally to the United
States with her mother to find a better life. But months later, the mother has
become incapable of caring for the girl and the father wants to take the
child  home.
It would seem a simple case, especially since the mother agrees her daughter
should return to Cuba.
Yet on the eve of the trial, a judge has warned that it could &quot;inflame the
community,&quot; where the battle over Elian Gonzalez nearly eight years ago divided
the city and became an international incident.
Testimony is to begin Monday over whether 32-year-old Cuban farmer Rafael
Izquierdo can regain custody of his 4-year-old daughter — whose name is being
kept secret — or whether she should remain with a wealthy Cuban-American and
his  wife who want to adopt her.
Until now, unlike Elian's case, this custody battle has moved quietly through
family court.
But on Thursday, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Jerri B. Cohen reluctantly lifted a
gag order at the request of the girl's foster father, Joe Cubas, 46, a
former  sports agent who has represented the New York Mets' Orlando &quot;El Duque&quot;
Hernandez  and several other ballplayers who defected from Cuba. Cubas said he
asked that  it be lifted because he said he was getting many questions about the
case.
The judge warned that allowing the parties to speak to the media &quot;could have
the possibility to inflame the community.&quot;
&quot;It's going to explode,&quot; Cohen said. &quot;I know that as sure as I sit here. I
can't prevent that.&quot;
Still, civic leaders, many of whom fought hard to keep Elian from returning
to Cuba, say they don't believe this case will spark similar reactions. The
facts are different and neither the U.S. government nor the Cuban-exile
community, burned by its negative portrayal during the Elian case, have a desire  to
repeat the past.
Elian, then 5, was found floating at sea on an inner tube on Thanksgiving Day
1999, after his mother drowned with others attempting to defect to the U.S.
The  boy's Miami relatives and many Cuban exiles insisted that Elian remain in
this  country, but immigration officials ruled in favor of his father, who
wanted him  returned to Cuba. A standoff ended only when armed federal agents
raided the  Little Havana home of Elian's uncle to seize the boy and send him to
Cuba.
In the current case, both parents are in Miami and have agreed to participate
in the U.S. legal system — and both say the girl should go with her father.
&quot;The reaction in the community has been incredibly mature up to this point,
and I'm sure it will remain this way,&quot; said Carlos Saladrigas, head of the
Cuba  Study Group, a nonpartisan group of business and civic leaders formed after
the  Elian case to promote democracy in Cuba through moderate channels.
The case began in 2004 when the girl's mother, Elena Perez, won the visa
lottery to come to the U.S. with her son and daughter, each of whom has a
different father. Both fathers agreed to let their children go with her.
But after Perez was hospitalized in December 2005 following a suicide
attempt, the children were put in foster care and ended up with the Cubas  family.
Perez agreed to let them adopt her son, now 13, but not her  daughter.
Izquierdo said he wants to take his daughter back to his family home in the
central Cuban village of Cabaiguan, where he and his wife have a 7-year-old
daughter.
&quot;Her room is ready with and her bed and her little toys,&quot; he said  Thursday.
Perez agrees. &quot;Now that she's not going to her mother, she should go to her
father,&quot; she said of her daughter. &quot;Those are the two best people in the world
to be at the side of a child.&quot;
An independent guardian appointed for the girl favors leaving her girl with
Cubas. Several top attorneys for the Florida Department of Children &amp;
Families also appear to favor Cubas.
Cubas said the girl, who calls him &quot;Papi,&quot; shouldn't be separated from her
brother and doesn't want to go back to Cuba.
&quot;I don't believe this is a matter of where their better life could be
provided,&quot; he said. &quot;It is our belief, as is the wishes of the children, that  they
remain together and that's why we're here.&quot;
Cubas drew critics in the late 1990s who said he helped top Cuba ball players
leave the island. In 2005, his sports agent certification was suspended
following accusations by one defector that Cubas took his immigration documents
and refused to return them. He has denied the allegations.
Perez and Saladrigas said the community's fear in both the Elian case and
this one was that the fathers had been pressured to bring their children back by
the Castro government.
&quot;The concern is whether they are speaking from their heart or being coerced,
and there is no clear answer to that. You will never know,&quot; Saladrigas said.
&quot;If  it wouldn't be for that it would be a no-brainer.&quot;
