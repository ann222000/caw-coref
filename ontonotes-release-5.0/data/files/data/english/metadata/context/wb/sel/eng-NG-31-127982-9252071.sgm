Hi

My wife and I are off to Edinburgh next week for a few days.

Can anyone recommend a decent Traditional folk club in the city -
preferably in the area between Holyroodhouse and the Castle?

I realize it could be a tall order, but by &quot;Traditional&quot; I mean
ideally BRITISH generally as opposed to non-stop bagpipe airs and long
laments about Bonny Prince Charlie - ducking hastily behind monitor in
case I have offended any Scots out there!!!!!             8^)

The Royal Oak, Infirmary Street. Hosts the Wee Folk Club downstairs at
weekends, has nightly residents/sessions, ranges from blues and pub
acoustic to Scots, Irish, American, English - anything. Generally, the
resident is happy to let visitors muck in.

Sandy Bells, Greyfriars: incredibly range of different mainly
instrumental sessions. Much Scots, of course, but also world music,
unusual groupings. Jack Campin's Sunday session 4-7pm is interesting,
just as likely to get a Balkan or Scandinavian tune set as an Scots one.

Many others of course, just pick up a free copy of the Gig Guide, which
you can find at my third recommendation - The Tass, on the Royal Mile.
Quite a bit of live cover-song music as well as Scots and other folk,
but generally well done (example, cover song stuff with double bass and
guitar well arranged). Joining in aspect sometimes absent.

Shame you're not going to be there in December when we old folkies will be
having a second get-together at the Waverley as the first one went so well!

Hi

Thanks for the info.

It looks as though The Tass is the most convenient.  As near as I can
tell from a street map, we are staying literally no more than 100yds
from The Tass.

If you are asking for a place where you might hear mostly English or
Welsh traditional stuff without doing it yourself, you might be in
for a long wait.

You might also be in for a long wait before hearing anything about
Bonny Prince Charlie - the only ones I hear regularly are &quot;My Bonny
Moorhen&quot; (which I suspect even you might not have a problem with) and
Brian MacNeill's &quot;Strong Women Rule Us All&quot; (party piece for several
session regulars; for my taste it's far too bloody long and prosy
like most of MacNeill's stuff, but a lament it ain't).

On the other hand: bagpipe tunes, and tunes not far removed from
being playable on the bagpipes, are the core of the Scottish
instrumental repertoire.  Why wouldn't you be curious to hear how
people up here play them?

Jack, was that a Deger or a Fagerstrom that you bought a while back?
I've just noticed that Fagerstrom have a new &quot;technopipe&quot; that seems to
be getting good reviews from a few places.

Which one did you buy and what do you think after however long it has
been?

Stephen (on topic for bagpipes anyway)

Mine's a Deger.  The extra features I would like:

- user-programmable tuning of the scale (you only get a
choice of Highland pipe chanter or equally tempered)

- a mode where all fingers down would silence the chanter,
as with a simple end-stopped pipe

- an end to that horrendous noise you get on plugging it into
an amp when powered off

- better support for dry fingers!  (gold contacts?)

I'm using it mainly to get in shape for when I get a closed-
fingering Border pipe set, and to noodle away discreetly in
public.  It works okay for that.

This popped into my head while playing the Deger on a train in
Slovakia a few days ago.  I wrote it down on a train ticket
which didn't have much blank space, so it's short:

I'm sure it's very much like lots of other tunes but I can't
think exactly what.

How are you getting on with the Turkish clarinet?

I'm not :-( I like playing it. But I'm awful. I haven't had the time (or
energy) to find a teacher (and for this instrument I really do think I
need some instruction). Also, the finger stretch is just that bit too
far. I can do it, but it is not comfortable and because you need to use
your finger tips you can't use the technique you'd use for a bagpipe or
a low D whistle.

Currently its packed away whilst various bits of the house are getting
decorated (and that is dragging on), so I haven't played it for a while.
The low Bb it can produce is a fabulous sound. (Well I think its a Bb).
Hopefully when I next play it I can find a suitable teacher near
Ely/Cambridge.

Cor. I hadn't heard anything of them for ages, but they were very very good
20 years ago. I'd be suprised if they weren't still.

I wonder if a neck-strap might help, a la saxophone ? You have a lot more

The spacing is about the same as for a Boehm flute and easier than
any tenor recorder.  I wonder if you have unusually shaped hands,
e.g. a longer or shorter than usual thumb? - if so, taping something
under the thumbrest might get you a better position.

My hands are utterly average, I never have a problem with any normal
instrument.  They even work with a standard size fujara, which at
first glance seems designed for King Kong, and I've just found a
garklein I can play.

B natural.  Makes a neat booming drone underneath a B minor reel like
The Ale is Dear.

I had to give up playing the penny whistle because of my RSI.

A loop of string or elastic with a hook on the end to dangle the bell
off a music stand or the back of a chair would take more weight.  The
bulge where the bell screws into the lower keyed joint will stop the

Would also be more helpful for posture (a neck strap will take more weight
if you hunch over so it's vertical, which is not a good idea for breathing).
It's not always convenient to be tied to a music-stand, though ...
