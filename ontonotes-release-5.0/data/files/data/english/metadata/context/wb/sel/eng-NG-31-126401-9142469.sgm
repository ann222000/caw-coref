Hi all

I am running Abit Kr7a with AMD 1700 CPU and 1 GB Memory. I use
photoshop and Adobe premier occasionally.  Now I want to upgrade to
something better, but using my ATA drives for the moment. Is it
possible to use these drives on SATA header?  I like to stick to ATA
though as I can not afford SATA hard drives right now, but I would
switch to SATA ultimately.  I have to buy a new SATA  DVD writer if I
have to use my hard drives utilizing the 1 ATA header being provided
by the Mobo manufactures now a days.

I   want  stable  Mobo with an option of upgrading to upcoming Intel
45nm CPU and DDR3 option when the prices fall. Like to start with
Intel CPU(?) in the price range of £50 - 60. I intend to upgrade when
more powerful CPUs/DDR3 mem become affordable, FSB1333 or better. Lots
of PCI slots. On board VGA card, would save me money initially, IEEE
header and LAN headers, 2 would be great.

Do I have to buy a compatible PSU, what wattage would that be.

Up till now I have not over clocked my computer, but I am thinking to
do
it now to get max. out of my CPU before upgrade.  I think that is
reasonable.

I think I do not have any option but to invest in a pricey
motherboard.

Thanks for your suggestions.

IEEE header?  Which IEEE spec?

There are many fine P35-based boards out there.  Some names to look
for are Abit, DFI, Gigabyte, and ASUS, in no particular order.  Some
of those are your 50-60GBP range.  Give it a few more weeks for the
X38 boards to really flood the market and you'll save even more.  Many
folks have been very pleased achieving 50% overclocks with the E4300
(~60GBP) on P35 boards. Re power supplies there are too many unknowns
here for a netnews answer.  Check out one of the many power supply
requirement calculators all over the intrawebs.

To run Photoshop well you definately want a dual core CPU and at least 2
gigs of ram.

Though I'm sure the upcomming Intel 45nm will be a good one...
I doubt if you'd want to skimp on the video card and go with on-board.

Personally I'd go for a better video card and maybe a little bit less of a
CPU

Most any dual core CPU will probably do a good job.

As far as using ATA drives on an SATA header...though I'm sure there are
adaptors...
you prob be better off getting a mobo with both ATA and SATA headers

I photoshop, create digital music, burn dvd's and edit my own website
on my custom built Gigabyte P35-DS3R E6420 (OC'd to 3.2ghz on air with
intel's hs) with 2gb's of Crucial Ballistix Ram and a 320gb Seagate
Barracuda 7200.10 HDD.

Cost me about... $1000 or so to build this PC (back in August) not
including monitor.

I wouldn't play the waiting game because the only perfect time to
build a PC is *now*. DDR3 and NM is going to be awhile before the tech
becomes affordable and by then the motherboards that handle them will
be even less expensive.

SATA HDD's are not expensive. $80 or less gets you a 320gb Seagate
Barracuda 7200.10.

Vista and my E6420 (2.13ghz) chip and my Gigabyte motherboard work
flawlessly with no speed issues or anything. You really don't need nm
or quad cores at this stage for what you need (photoshop).
