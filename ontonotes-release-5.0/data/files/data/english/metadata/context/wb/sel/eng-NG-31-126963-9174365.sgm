I have a bassman135 and today, something happened with it that has
never happened before. I was playing it pretty hard, and all of the
sudden, no sound. Power lamp still on, just no sound. I turned it off,
and waited a minute, then turned it back on again, and it was
working.

My schematic shows a thermal fuse &quot;on some models.&quot; Could it be that
the thermal fuse tripped and then reset itself? It seems that if that
were the case, I'd see the power lamp go off. Any ideas?

Thanks.

Not necessarily... you can put a thermal interruptor anywhere
in the circuit, perhaps this one is after the pilot light.

Try putting a fan on the amp and see if the problem goes
away. Â You might need a re-bias or new final tubes.
