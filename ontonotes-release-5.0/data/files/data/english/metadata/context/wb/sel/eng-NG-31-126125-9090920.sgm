Socrates taught his students that the pursuit of truth can only begin once
they start to question and analyze every belief that they ever held dear. If
a certain belief passes the tests of evidence, deduction, and logic, it
should be kept. If it doesn't, the belief should not only be discarded, but
the thinker must also then question why he was led to believe the erroneous

Why did you not join the Canadian military, so that you could stand side by
side with the British as they protect the CIA poppy fields in Afghanistan

If people all over the world didn't like to get high on drugs, the
Afghans wouldn't be farming poppies.  They don't have a lot of ways to
make money--a landlocked country with little mineral wealth.  How many

should be kept. If it doesn't, the belief should not only be discarded, but
the thinker must also then question why he was led to believe the erroneous

&gt; &gt; Now to get rid of the trash that calls itself Top Poster as it

&gt; TopPoaster disgraces himself pretty well every time he says anything.

Afghanistan has a excellent agricultural resources and a long history of
trading in diverse agricultural produce. Poppy cultivation had been a minor
activity before the UN ban on Heroin was adopted by it's member states under
heavy pressure from the US. After that, the price of Opium refined products
increased nearly 1000 times. People blame the farmers but they don't earn
that much more from the crop, most of the money goes to local gangs,
cheiftans etc. who're keen on getting the most out of their territory and
sometimes use violent means of persuasion to get the crop grown.
