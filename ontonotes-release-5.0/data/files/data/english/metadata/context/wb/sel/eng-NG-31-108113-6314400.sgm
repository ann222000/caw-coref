In December I took my 9 year-old Jack Russell bitch to the vet to have a
raised area on her lower belly looked at that looked a little unusual.
It was about the size of a dime and a little pink.  My vet said that at
her age I could expect things like the small fatty tumor on her breast
bone area, but that the other looked questionable and if I were her,
she would have it removed just to be safe.  We made the appointment for
January.

Yesterday I brought her in early and handed her over signing some
paperwork prior to leaving.  They called me twice before and after the
operation on my cell phone.  The first call was about a problem with
the blood screening machine, but they said not to worry since she has
always been a healthy dog and seemed fine.  The second call was
regarding her teeth that they were cleaning after the tumor was removed
since she was asleep already.  When I got back in the early afternoon
the Tech said she did fine and she was ready to go home.  I then asked
if they needed to give me anything to keep her from licking her belly.
She looked at me funny and said that she couldn't possibly reach it.
Right then I knew something was wrong!

She brought my dog out to me and we discovered that they operated on
the wrong area!  She claimed that they operated on the area that I
indicated with a green marker on my dog.  Well, I didn't mark her
anywhere!  The Receptionist piped in and said to the Tech, "since we
had so many patients arriving I didn't ask her or have her make any
marks on her dog."  Needless to say I was a little upset.  I was trying
not to upset my pup since she could hear me and I'm not one to make a
big scene, but I couldn't help but cry with a 2 inch hole in my dog
that I didn't anticipate!

The Vet came out and apologized and said if I gave her 10 minutes she
could work on the other site.  I went ahead and let her take it off
since it was a true concern to me for the last three weeks.  Fifteen
minutes later they came to get me and handed her over to take her
home.

After spending the night by her side trying to comfort her I'm
wondering if I made the right decision.  This was the first time I have
ever had any operation on any of my dogs, but I now realize that I
SHOULD HAVE marked the area to be removed.  What should I do now?

Thanks for your advice.

Did the vet offer to reduce or cancel the cost of the operation? I
suggest you raise this with them, as this is clearly their mistake and
your dog's well-being has been affected by unnecessary surgery. They
should be offering you a full apology and some sort of financial
renumeration, like dismissing the surgery cost or offering you a year's
worth of free vet check-ups.

I'm not in favor of litigation so I cannot tell you that you should run
out and sue them. It might occur to you to do so, but in the long run,
suing someone does very little good and takes much time, money, and
energy. And the truism that the lawyer is the only one who makes money
is correct.

If your vet will not "make good" with you and act in a resonsible and
dignifed manner, find another vet and move your dog's health records
over to them.

Sorry, one other thought. Did your vet perform a needle biopsy before
recommending surgery? Most vets like to know what they're dealing with
*before* they make a dog submit to surgery. In my case, my little dog
has fatty lipomas all over the place...my vet uses a needle to take a
small cell sample to peer at under the microscope. In every case, the
cells have been benign and my vet has said leave the lumps be...not
worth the risk to the dog to do surgery on a benign lump.

Unfortunately, it's not always possible to get a conclusive answer
from a FNA.

For future reference, that is where I would have said, "No thanks
and never mind, I'm on my way to pick her up."  No way am I letting
my dog be anesthetized without a blood panel.  And I'd be leery of a
vet who was that off-hand about it.

I should think so!  I've never been asked to mark up my dog prior to
surgery.  I don't know how common that is, but it would make me very
uncomfortable with my vet if I were ever asked to do so.

That really sucks.  I don't know what I would have done, had I been
put on the spot like that.  Ideally, though, I think it would be
best to cut your losses and go to another vet.  I wouldn't want to
give them a chance to screw up again.

I can't even begin to advise you on what you *should* do, but if it
were me, I would find a new vet, and I'd make it clear to the old
vet why I was changing practices.  I wouldn't bother trying to sue,
if that's your question, mostly because I doubt it would be worth
the time and effort.

Good point.  My Boxer is starting to get lumpy in her old(er) age.
Based on needle biopsy, I decided *not* to have the big lump on her
butt removed, as it's a plain old fatty tumor, and isn't bothering
her in the least.  I don't think it's worth putting her under for
that, though if she has to be anesthetized for something else, then
I may have it removed.

In the meantime, I sing the Lumpy Old, Grey Old, Leaky Old Dog song
to her.  It helps to laugh at that sort of thing, I think.

Harriet's had some inconclusive ones.  Hrmf.  But, the newest lump

The short answer is that I'd seriously get a new vet.

The longer answer involves (unfortunately) many experiences with veterinary
surgeries and also involves my STILL not being anywhere NEAR qualified to
tell my vet where exactly to perform surgical procedures.

Aw!  Poor thing.  Did they bother him or get in the way of him being
petted?  Harriet doesn't seem to notice hers.  I poke at it
regularly ("Just checking!"), and I don't mind petting her lump, but
I always wonder if some dogs get shafted because people think the
lumps are icky.

The nekkid factor is a plus and a minus.  On the plus side, it's
obvious when she gets a new lump.  On the minus side, I've had
strangers stop me and ask me what the hell is wrong with my dog.
"She's lumpy, dumbass," just doesn't seem to satisfy them, for some
reason.

........Life is always a series of lessons.  It's dark inside a dog so you

dogs have hair and you can't write on them very easily.   And I think it's a

vet's office is so busy it's like an assembly line, well, that's just
another bad indication.

If you decide to leave, ask for copies of all your records, labs and clinic
notes.  Hope your pup mends up OK.

The client should have signed an authorization form upon patient admission
that clearly outlines the procedures to be done. If procedures are
authorized after this time by phone, then they should have been witnessed by
a second practice staff member.

As for dentals, we'll do dentals after some procedures, but never in the OR.
The primary procedure will be completed first in the OR, then after closure
and protection of the area, the patient is moved to a special area where the
dental is performed and the airborne bacteria is reduced.

And yes, if surgery was performed erroneously, there should be a refund and
profound apology. And lots of documentation.

I would be switching vets and insist on some sort of discount on the bill
for this botched up mess.

Any vet that would operate on an area that they are to be removing a tumor
or growth from and operate when there is nothing there to be removed is
incompetent.

I've read the other responses, but I'm having trouble wrapping my mind

Does this mean they did the surgery without anesthesia?

Good point. I was wondering about that as well. If it could be removed
without anesthesia, then why put the dog under the first time? If it was
too invasive for local, then what the hell was that doc doing by removing
it in 15 minutes????

This was at the University of Missouri (!!!). The FNA showed some
spindle cells and I'm not sure what else. I got told, in the strongest
possible terms, that an amputation needed to happen and that if I didn't
amputate the cancer would come back and would kill my dog. The ONLY
responsible thing to do was whack her leg off. At this point, Viva was
less than 3 years old. I said no, absolutely not. The surgeon then came
into it, pulled in by the combative specialist, and said okay, he'd
remove the tendon; but it was very clear that they were not happy with
me. If I didn't have a really strong personality of my own Viva would
have lost her entire leg for NOTHING. It was just scar tissue. NO cancer
at all.

They kept telling me "but she can still be a great pet!" Well gee, she's
been a great pet for the last 7 years with ALL FOUR LEGS. The vet who
tried to bully me did not have the grace to even call me to tell me she
was wrong, much less apologize. I got the pathology from a student.

There have been many issues, all of which have been attempted to be
addressed, so far without success. It's at the point where now I will
now only go to the University  of MO if it's a true emergency and I will
not recommend them, nor will I voluntarily ever use them. I'd rather
drive 2 hours to St. Louis than use the veterinary teaching hospital in
my own back yard.

1. A friend who was told her dog had cancer in the hip when he needed
his hip replacement fixed. He didn't.

2. A friend who had a dog with chips in the elbow (very small, slight
Elbow Dysplasia) was operated on, they opened the joint, gave her NO
antibiotics, and a tremendous joint infection ensued, the dog was
completely crippled for life.

3. A friend who had spinal surgery on her dog last year. Big price tag,
was promised all sorts of recovery. Refused to give her antibiotics for
the dog post-surgery. The dog caught kennel cough from the vet school.
They refused to believe she had kennel cough. This dog almost died and
was coughing and screaming from pain from the spinal surgery.

These were all committed dog people, not pet people. I could go on but I
won't. Students change constantly, the owner is treated like a dope with
a wallet, you aren't even allowed to be with your dog for a simple shot
much less something like being stitched. Hopefully someday the powers
that be at the top will realize there's a big stinking problem in small
animal.

(and for anyone reading who actually lives near here--large animal is
completely different than small animal and is an incredible place).

&lt;snip stories that sound sadly familiar&gt;

Yeah. That sounds a lot like the Animal Medical Center here in NYC.
Touted as the regions best, but case after case of the same sort of
thing you describe. They're the ones that screwed up Finn's hip during
CHR, refused antibiotics, then, once they acknowledged the (now severe)
infection, they refused to culture it, even though it had very likely
moved close to the bone. Instead of a culture, they decided to go back
in (charging us for it, of course) and remove some of the xtra hardware-
the surgeon had left so many nails and loose wires, it looked like a
medieval torture device on the Xrays. Yup, that's a good plan: take an
area with what turns out to be an antibiotic resistant infection (one I
later discovered is found primarily on unwashed human skin) and then go
directly to the site and dig into the bones some more.

The infection spread to his bones. He never got rid of it. He ended up
losing the hip, and four years later,he finally succumbed to the
infection. He was a strong boy with a brave heart. But by the end, the
infection they gave him, and subsequently refused to treat, was causing
internal rupturing.

This jackass surgeon got written up in some big NY Magazine for being
one of the best in NYC. Yeah right. I've since heard of many more dogs
he's butchered. Last I heard, he got courted into taking a position out
west somewhere.

Yup, just got curious and googled. Working at a big hospital in San
Diego now. Barf.

Sorry about the ranty tangent. Hadn't thought about that in a while.
Your experiences reminded me of how much heartbreak that asshole cost
me, and has cost so many other dog owners I've since come across.

And I also know what you mean about getting nothing dealt with. After
the first few admissions that they "screwed up", they spent the next
year covering each other's butts. Its hard to make a point, when they
are so busy trying to keep their teflon coating while burying their
heads a bit deeper into the next guy's butt.

Good thing I'm not bitter.

Thank you all for your support and advice.  I'm not even close to hiring
an lawyer since I'm so against unneeded litigation!  Right now my pup is
doing well, although a bit sore, but if things were not as well I would
do everything I could to protect other animals from the same outcome.
All of the procedures were done under a local and the vet ended up
taking the blood panel to the local hospital prior to surgery along
with the other surgery patients that morning (which makes me feel
better).

My husband and I spoke with the vet who has a long relationship with
his family for more than twenty years.  My father-in-law, a
Cardiologist, assured me that it was probably best to have the fatty
tumor removed, although I still feel angry about the whole ordeal.

They might feel okay, but honestly I don't know if I'll ever darken
their doorway with my dog.  I've learned a hard lesson and now I'll
take the same precautions we humans are now having to undertake.
Hearing your stories and opinions definitely make a difference.

Thank you again, and I pray for good health for all!
Ginny

Your stories bring back some really bad memories.  We were fostering a
rescue, a young, apparently healthy, female BC.  A home was found for
her but she would have to be flown there.  During her veterinary exam a
heart problem was detected.  I don't remember what it was (I've tried to
forget the whole awful ordeal), but it could be repaired surgically.

The examining vet offered to refer us to a cardiac surgeon here in St.
Louis, but my mother, who worships at the altar of the all-mighty
teaching hospital, would have none of it.  It had to be the University
of Missouri.

Long story short, they called us to say she'd come through it fine and
that the surgery had been a success.  Two hours later we got another
telling us they'd found her dead in her cage.

Well it's weird. Even when directly confronted, the Dean just waved
stuff away. That dean is now gone, and the interim Dean is actually a
pretty good guy. Whether things will change though remains to be seen.
And should I mention that some of the people who are complaining are
also VERY high up at the University, including one PhD researcher who
has a dual appointment at the vet school, and the Manager of the entire
vet school. When concerns are dismissed from people like this there's a
deep, endemic problem.

Most of us in the local dog community, you know, the people who are
actually willing to spend really big bucks on our dogs, now not only
don't go there, we actively try to prevent others from doing so. You'd
think they'd realize this is a problem...

Absolutely, positively, NOT. I have argued till blue in the face. Nope.
Nada. I don't know why they even have exam rooms, because actual
treatment goes on in the back, behind closed doors somewhere.

Last summer Cala jumped in a pond after a bumper and got caught on
something that ripped a V shaped tear in her skin by the rib cage. More
ugly than serious, but it needed stitching and it was a Sunday. And most
vets in this area no longer have their own Emergency--you must to go the
University. MUVTH flat refused to allow me to be with Cala when she was
stitched. I threw a huge, ugly, nasty fit. They refused. Either they
took her to the back, or I could have her back unstitched. Those were
the only options. I gave in with very bad grace, but it was just another
nail in the coffin.

Fortunately not all places are like this. Several of my friends have
been going to a great place in St. Louis called Veterinary Medical
Associates. They do a *super* job and by all reports are the antithesis
of the Univ of MO. A few years ago my friend's springer got hit by a
truck. Long story, it happened at a show, the truck was going maybe 5
miles per hour and it was one of those "crap just sometimes happens"
things. It shattered her pelvis. the Univ wanted to fuse things. She
took the dog to St. Louis. I forget how many pins it took and it was an
incredibly complex operation, but the dog not only recovered, she was
able to compete in agility for years after.

They're not all like that.  I've used the same vet for the past 22 years
and she and her partners are wonderful.  You are part and parcel of the
decision making process and your dog's treatment and care.  Post-op
patients are continually supervised.

During one visit on a very busy day the assisting vet tech was wearing a
chest pack.  A squiff of grey brown hair was visible at the top and it
emitted a continual low-pitched rumbling.  When I inquired I was told
that the grumpy lump was an elderly toy poodle who'd had dental work
done and was taking her own sweet time waking up and needed watching.

And my sister's vet allowed her and our mother to assist during her
dog's c-section; they were the designated puppyrubbers.

That is just incredibly suspicious.

Makes you wonder what they think they have to do to the dogs in order to
make them compliant.

Having volunteered/interned at more than a coupld of big vet centers in

Well, I posted about him here and in behavior often enough that you kind
of did know him :-)

He was a half American Show lines, half Czech Sch lines dog with drive
like crazy, a ridiculously fear reactive temperament, and a broken body
that couldn't possibly keep up with either. He was exhausting and tough,
but I loved him like crazy. I rescued him from a macho Sch ego breeder
who was going to let him die of Parvo at 5 months old. Our first two
weeks together were spent with him in intensive care at the vet's.

Finn taught me world's about fear and stress issues....and taught me
patience (I often failed), and creativity in training (the old style
methods I had been taught only ever made him worse), and love no matter
what....both giving and receiving.

I swear he held on for those last couple of months longer than he should
so I could catch up and get ready to do what I needed to do to say
goodbye and help him get peace. He really held on for me. God, I haven't
cried about him for a while now....but I'm bawling like a baby. He was
pure spirit and pure love....with some obnoxious issues thrown in just
so I didn't get too carried away :-)

Annie's body and temperament couldn't be more opposite of everything he
was. But anything I accomplish with her is a testimony to who he was,
what he gave me, and what he taught me. And to her spirit....which is
one way they're similar.

prevented the prothesis from actually staying in place- which in turn
caused the second surgery to fix it, wich is when he got the
infection....yadda yadda.

That's good to hear. Hopefully he'll take responsibility for his
department in a way that counts.

&gt; Whether things will change though remains to be seen.
&gt; And should I mention that some of the people who are complaining are
&gt; also VERY high up at the University, including one PhD researcher who
&gt; has a dual appointment at the vet school, and the Manager of the
entire
&gt; vet school. When concerns are dismissed from people like this there's
a
&gt; deep, endemic problem.

Right after Finn went through his multiple screwed up surgeries (4 in
total), I found out that the head of AMC had a house in the country
where he kept a few horses. Those horses were found to have been living
in their own filth for so long that their hooves were rotting and they
had sores going up their legs.

Yeah, when it comes to big institutions like that, endemic problems are
far too easy to ignore. There are too many administrators getting
positions via connections, and not enough checks and balances built in.
Not letting owners be present to advocate for their pets only makes
things that much harder.

&gt; Most of us in the local dog community, you know, the people who are
&gt; actually willing to spend really big bucks on our dogs, now not only
&gt; don't go there, we actively try to prevent others from doing so. You'd
&gt; think they'd realize this is a problem...
">

You know, you'd thihnk that would make a difference. Unfortunately,
around here, I find that there are always enough regular, not-in-the-
know pet owners to keep AMC in business. Ever since the "Big Change
Over" at AMC, the care and concern for animals has taken a back seat to
money and hierarchy. Word has been spreading like wildfire among dog
people....but they're pulling in more money than ever.

I really hope you guys have more luck than we've had here.

I am really thankful for the veterinary practice that we go to.  They're
open 7 days a week, have early/late hours during the weekdays, aren't overly
pricey, respectful and good with both the dogs and the humans.  The only
time I didn't go to the back (when they did have to take the dogs back
there) was when Khan had his teeth pulled, and even then, I could watch
through the glass door to see what they were doing.  When I have requested,
the vet has always allowed me to the back, even if I couldn't be with the
dog (during Khan's laser surgery for lump removals, for example).

She has mentioned however, that there are certain owners who are requested
to wait outside.  She said that some dogs do significantly worse in the
presence of their owners and that the 'Poor Baby'-ing can make them nervous
and uncooperative.

It certainly doesn't hurt that the staff is generous with compliments about
the dogs' good behavior, and generous with the cookies too (they even ask
first).
