Also, I am willing to locate ROI, NI, Scotland &amp; Wales on a world map if you
can do the same with Indiana, Kentucky, and Missouri. In the meantime, here is
another story about the origin of the word Hoosier:

In early pioneer days in Indiana were pretty rough, and men would get into some
wild barroom brawls. They would often do the Mike Tyson manuver. At the end
of a fight, the bartender would calmly pick up a bit of mangled flesh from the
floor and ask the crowd....... WHO'S EAR?

Your very welcome

.... is he HE or really as SHE? - that's another one of our wee in

Indiana ... wants me now .... near Terre Haute

Kentucky ... make good fried chicken ...near Louisville, that's on the
border with Indiana.

Missouri ... full of donkeys ... there's really not much in Missouri is
there?:) near Jefferson City ... or I suppose Springfield.

Now tell me where Kells is in Ireland, btw I bet, you've been to Knock??

Enjoy yourself at the meet. :)

In this country we call the cross between a male horse and a female
donkey, a hinney. The offspring of a male donkey and female horse is
called a mule. All mules are sterile, and most hinneys are sterile.

As to the difference between the male and female offspring, I can think
of a number of things that are different. :-)

It would be interesting to get pair of fertile hinneys (or mules?), boy

Nope, I just double checked with the Mule breeders association and
that's the right way around, Ronnie.

I think there are already ninnies being bred in another species. :-)
