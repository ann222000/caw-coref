So as we await with bated breath Steve Worek's fan edit of Moonraker,
I thought I'd come up with a little appetizer in the meantime.

Licence to Kill, in my book, has got to be one of the most
underachieving Bond films in the series.  Actually, it's always struck
me more as a standard detective film than any sort of grand Bond
adventure.  Its shortcomings are plenty and one of them includes
sloppy editing, of which the series has suffered too much from
beginning with DAF.  Anyway, with LTK I speak particularly of the PCS
lead-in to the title song and the truck chase at the end.  So, just to
prove a point, I took the liberty of restructuring the PCS into how it
should've been done, minus the needless fat.  What took the original
24:05 to do, from UA logo onward, I managed to accomplish in 11:12
[about 13 minutes if you include the complete theme song] with much
better effect.  No longer is there that idiotic feel-good, Disney-
like, taking-care-of-business-while-rushing-to-the-wedding nonsense.
Now we just get straight to the point of what the film is supposed to
be about punctuated by the film's title when it appears, which in this
case actually &quot;justifies,&quot; so to speak, Bond's reaction and his
mission, before the song comes in, unlike in the original, where there
is a total disconnect between what goes on in the PCS and the film's
title.

Anyway, scrutinize it to no end with a downloadable copy of it here:

http://www.snapdrive.net/qs/2d21614f7d2b

The 162 MB avi file is zipped into 140 MB.  Who knows how long it'll
be up there, so get it while you can.

Note: It might be a good idea to refresh your memory of the original
LTK PCS by watching that first before the re-edited version.  Take it
as far as 24 minutes, till when the young cop tells Bond that it was
likely a chainsaw, which Colombians like to use on informants, then
compare all that with my 11 minutes worth.

Next up: the reworked truck chase - that'll be a fun one.

Is there still logical story progression in this edit, or is it more like
your GoldenEye PCS where two cars just drove along a piece or road for
seemingly no reason?

Just download the damn thing and see for yourself.  If it'll make you
feel any better, there are no two cars driving down a road for no

The LTK PCS that I saw in theaters and on the DVD ended with Bond
going into the church with Felix for Felix's wedding, with the
parachutes draped behind them like the train of a wedding gown.  The
killing of Della and maiming of Felix came after the credits and the
escape of Sanchez.

Did you see a different cut?

That was my point.  The escape, reception, home invasion, and Bond's
discovery of the crime were not meant to be in the PCS.  The original
PCS stands on its own, and I think it is one of the better efforts.
In fact, IMHO, both of the Dalton PCS's were excellent.

--- Ok, I know where you misunderstood.  My meaning was that what took
the original 24 minutes to do, pre- and post-title song, I managed to
compress into 11 minutes, pre- and post-title song, with the bulk of
those 11 minutes, 9 of them, coming from the post-song part of the
original for the revamped PCS.  The problem with the original PCS is
that what happens in it isn't at all integral to the overall plot of
the film, it can all be neatly summarized in a revamped version.  So
if it all can be neatly summarized in a revamped version, then what's
the point of seeing the opening shot of the plane and radar, when that
doesn't even figure anywhere else in the rest of the movie, and the
trip to the wedding along with the sidetracking of that trip to the
wedding by going after Sanchez when it would've been impossible to
accomplish what they did and still make it to the wedding on time?  It
was all nothing more than goofy tomfoolery of a PCS that wrapped up
with a happy ending and then led into the song and, disconnectedly,
the title Licence to Kill.  Like, dumb or what?

A hallmark of a really good Bond PCS is to introduce some element of
threat that establishes either an intriguing teaser [or micro-mini-
Bond adventure in itself separate from the rest of the film] or a
raison d'etre for the rest of the film.  Getting to the church on time
does not establish either, which makes the LTK PCS ridiculous as a
Bond opener, turning it into more of a Disney idea of a Bond PCS.  Not
only that, but the focus isn't even on Sanchez as a threat in the
original PCS, but on getting to the church on time with Bond and
Leiter acting more like Laurel &amp; Hardy; whereas, in how I have it
revamped, the focus is clearly on Sanchez and the looming threat he'll
obviously be for Bond in the rest of the film.  In mine, he certainly
comes across as more of a villainous presence and not just some two-
bit lawbreaker who gets caught, ends up in jail, has meaningless
conversations, yada-yada-yada, all while there's a wedding supposed to
happen somewhere.

While the PCS in TLD was indisputably more effective, in the sense of
being a micro-mini-Bond adventure that ranks among the best in the
series, the original PCS in LTK is perhaps one of the most poorly, if
not poorest, conceived ones of them all.

Anyway, go ahead and download the revamp and see for yourself as to
which works best. It's sure to be a collector's item!

I think I'll watch it first without having seen LTK's opening for five

WQ,

I'm still downloading but, having read the thread so far, I notice
that you're getting some grief already, apparently without anyone
having watched your cut.

I suppose you could have phrased your initial post a little more
kindly, since some people like the film as it is.  But I come not to
hassle you, but to thank you -- for the effort; for giving me what is,
in essence, some fresh Bond to watch; and for finding a way to get the
160 MB onto my PC.

I'll let you know later what I think of the re-edit!  :-)

Dave

&gt;&gt;&gt;24:05 to do, from UA logo onward, I managed to accomplish in 11:12
&gt;&gt;&gt;[about 13 minutes if you include the complete theme song]...

&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, scrutinize it to no end with a downloadable copy of it here:

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.snapdrive.net/qs/2d21614f7d2b

&gt;&gt;I'm downloading now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The 162 MB avi file is zipped into 140 MB.  Who knows how long it'll
&gt;&gt;&gt;be up there, so get it while you can.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Note: It might be a good idea to refresh your memory of the original
&gt;&gt;&gt;LTK PCS by watching that first before the re-edited version...

&gt;&gt;Somehow, I don't think that's a fair test, at least not for the first
&gt;&gt;viewing.

&gt;&gt;I think I'll watch it first without having seen LTK's opening for five
&gt;&gt;or however many years it's been.  After all, that would be the &quot;true&quot;
&gt;&gt;experience of watching this cut -- not watching it immediately after
&gt;&gt;having already seen the shots in it already.

&gt;&gt;I'm very much looking forward to it!  :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;Take it
&gt;&gt;&gt;as far as 24 minutes, till when the young cop tells Bond that it was
&gt;&gt;&gt;likely a chainsaw, which Colombians like to use on informants, then
&gt;&gt;&gt;compare all that with my 11 minutes worth.

&gt;&gt;Hmm, okay.  I see.  You've put post-credits stuff into the PCS.
&gt;&gt;Similar to what one might do with FYEO.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Next up: the reworked truck chase - that'll be a fun one.

&gt;&gt;Really?  I never felt bored during that bit.  If anything, I'd wonder
&gt;&gt;how much Wayne Newton one could remove.

&gt;&gt;Anyway, looking forward to this.  I'm 9% downloaded already  :-)

&gt; I'm still downloading but, having read the thread so far, I notice

Okay, I just watched it.

In a word:  Nahhh.

In more words: I think that overhauls like this have to happen at the
script level, not once the thing has already been shot.

IMO, the pre-credit sequences tend to be single events.  Sure, there
are some minor exceptions.  Goldfinger and DAF come to mind, but,
outside of TWINE (which was an unplanned oddity), there is still a lot
less story-telling in the average PCS than you're covering in yours.

Plus, outside of FRWL maybe, how often do the PCSes set out to take
you so far into the plot that you're fully aware of the stakes at hand
(as is your goal here)?

I don't recall, watching yours, if you've even conveyed that the guy's
name is Felix Leiter, that he works for the CIA.  I think you might
have included a line or two about how our tuxedoed men have just
brought down a guy named &quot;Sanchez,&quot; but I don't know if it's enough to
introduce the threat of the guy we're about to see being transported.

I think Milton Krest must have had some kind of introduction in the
original film, didn't he?

I suppose I'm taking a lot of paragraphs to say what Kent already
said.  But I tried to write my thoughts before I let his influence me
too much.

One additional problem: I'm pretty sure that the opening didn't bore
me when I first saw this film in the theater.  Re-watching it, the
helcopter-plane-parachute scene felt a little soft, but it was still
fine, and it also took some time to introduce our two heroes as
friends.

It seems like your edit loses too much (especially characters and
plot) without really correcting any complaint I had in the first
place.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So as we await with bated breath Steve Worek's fan edit of Moonraker,
&gt; I thought I'd come up with a little appetizer in the meantime.

&gt; Licence to Kill, in my book, has got to be one of the most
&gt; underachieving Bond films in the series.  Actually, it's always struck
&gt; me more as a standard detective film than any sort of grand Bond
&gt; adventure.  Its shortcomings are plenty and one of them includes
&gt; sloppy editing, of which the series has suffered too much from
&gt; beginning with DAF.  Anyway, with LTK I speak particularly of the PCS
&gt; lead-in to the title song and the truck chase at the end.  So, just to
&gt; prove a point, I took the liberty of restructuring the PCS into how it
&gt; should've been done, minus the needless fat.  What took the original
&gt; 24:05 to do, from UA logo onward, I managed to accomplish in 11:12
&gt; [about 13 minutes if you include the complete theme song] with much
&gt; better effect.  No longer is there that idiotic feel-good, Disney-
&gt; like, taking-care-of-business-while-rushing-to-the-wedding nonsense.
&gt; Now we just get straight to the point of what the film is supposed to
&gt; be about punctuated by the film's title when it appears, which in this
&gt; case actually &quot;justifies,&quot; so to speak, Bond's reaction and his
&gt; mission, before the song comes in, unlike in the original, where there
&gt; is a total disconnect between what goes on in the PCS and the film's
&gt; title.

&gt; Anyway, scrutinize it to no end with a downloadable copy of it here:

meets him in his office and says to him, &quot;Switch that thing off,

first scene, we pretty well know that he's Felix.  And if he's Felix
and he's talking about some creep named Sanchez and Ed comes along to
say that he's taking Sanchez to Quantico, then we can safely assume
that this is the same Felix working with the CIA.

&gt; I think Milton Krest must have had some kind of introduction in the

--- There's a shot of Krest in mine without an intro, but that
couldn't be helped because of the whole scene used.  Obviously, if I
had written or directed the film Krest wouldn't've been in that scene,
but because I can only work with what I have and that scene was
needed, there are moments when you have to forget about the original
film and who's who and imagine this re-edit as being the &quot;real
thing&quot;.  In that way, the appearance of Krest probably wouldn't even
cross your mind much, just as the appearance of the two henchmen
standing next to Felix before he's going to be fed to the shark.  It's
a minor quibble.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It seems like your edit loses too much (especially characters and

&gt; place.
">

--- The characters and plot are all there. The original is really all
about the wedding and the nuisance of having to get Sanchez while
trying to get to the church on time.  Everything that appeared in the
original really didn't have to be shown.  In mine, we know Sanchez got
caught, so that didn't have to be shown, we know Felix is getting
married, so the process of having to get to the church didn't have to
be shown, the scene when Sanchez intrudes on the girl and her lover
seemed kind of pointless in the PCS, yet in following the theme song
in mine, it really gets the movie and his threat going.  As I said
earlier about what makes a good Bond PCS:

A hallmark of a really good Bond PCS is to introduce some element of
threat that establishes either an intriguing teaser [or micro-mini-
Bond adventure in itself separate from the rest of the film] or a
raison d'etre for the rest of the film.

In this case, mine plays out as a raison d'etre for the rest of the
film and Bond's enraged reaction to having just found Felix all cut up
before the title song is also more connected to the film's title than
happily landing at the church grounds on time.

As for Kent's critique:

&quot;Perhaps not bad overall, but too frantic, too hard to place the
timeframes of events and generally hard to follow given there's no
introduction of, or context for, any of the side characters who seem
to be standing around for no reason?&quot;

It's interesting he would say that he found it &quot;too frantic&quot; since my
PCS is the exact same sequence of events as in the original film,
where it appeared after the PCS, so it must've been just as &quot;too
frantic&quot; there as well.  In fact, it would've been more frantic if I
hadn't cut out two scenes, one of Sanchez being taken from the jail to
the truck for transport in front of a yelling crowd [pointless scene,
who really cares?] and Sanchez giving the other CIA agent Ed $2
million for helping him escape [but that's mentioned in my PCS when Ed
says it himself that 2 million would've been a hell of a lot of money
to turn down, so why be redundant by having the first scene in when it
works better and with more economy in the second?].

As for context, the original PCS had no context for the movie that
wasn't already within the movie.  My PCS gets the movie started, not
starts with a stall.  And the chronology of what happens explains all
that is needed to know:

1. Bond meets Felix, talk about Sanchez, Ed shows up and says he's
taking Sanchez to Quantico, then it's time to cut the wedding cake
2. The wedding cake is cut, followed by the poolside party reception
when Bond is given a torch lighter as a gift, which he'll get to use
later in the film
3. Sanchez is being transported across the water, an escape is made
with the help of Ed
4. It's night now, wedding's over, Bond leaves Felix and Della, after
which Sanchez' henchmen turn up to spoil Felix and Della's fun
5. Felix is taken to Sanchez' warehouse where he learns Ed turned on
him and then he becomes a tasty leg for a shark
6. Bond learns of Sanchez' escape just as he's about to take a flight
out and heads back to Felix's place, where he finds Della dead and
Felix still barely alive
7. Bond gets pissed after reading the note on Felix's body, cue in
song and title - Licence to Kill.

The context is all there, exactly as in the original, only moved
forward to become the PCS to replace the original one which basically
doesn't add anything more to that, making the original needless
fat.

As for &quot;timeframes&quot; Kent was talking about, I don't know what he's
referring to again, because the timeframes of the PCS is lifted
directly from the film itself as is.  Not my problem if he's
chronologically challenged.

Personally, if I had done the movie myself, I would've had an entirely
different PCS that would've been more along the lines of TLD's, which
fell into the mini-Bond adventure separate from the film category.
But as an exercise in working with what I had to work with, and the
limitations of that, from my p.o.v. the PCS I crafted suits me just
fine.  I also find that Bond seems more engaged in my PCS than in the
original where he's asked, if not ordered by Felix, to just stand back
and do nothing most of the time, until the final moments when Bond
breaks loose and hooks the tail end of Sanchez' plane.

The original PCS seems to be more about Felix than Bond, whereas in
mine, as much as Felix appears, the final shot of an angered Bond and
its connection to the title makes it more of a Bond PCS.  Not a great
one by any means, but more so, I find, than with the original.

That may be a new, higher standard for the PCSes that has evolved
since the original &quot;classic&quot; Bond films.

If we take a few films that a lot of fans like -- the first four and
FYEO -- I find that only FRWL has a PCS that hints at what the plot of
the movie might be.  (I'm cheating a bit by omitting OHMSS and TSWLM.
:-)

Anyway, you did a nice bit of work here, but I still think it's work
that should have been done to the script, rather than in editing.  And
you certainly were stuck with a challenge since you didn't even get
the original raw footage to work with!

For example, isn't your opening shot an interior shot of one or two
guys walking into a room?  Obviously, if these changes had been made
at the script level, we'd have an opening shot worthy of a Bond movie
-- maybe one that takes us from an aerial shot of Florida down to
Felix's home.  (I'm thinking of GF here.)

Speaking of not having the correct shot...  Did anyone see the Ridley
Scott's director's cut of Blade Runner?  Did he really not have a
better closing shot than the inside of a door as two people walk out
through it?

I actually don't think you need to defend your work, point by point.
It was an impressive bit of work -- even moreso given that you were
stuck only with the footage from the movie, a severe limitation.  No
reshoots allowed, no chance to add an extra line via ADR, etc.

Actually, I don't think anyone's questioning the quality of your work.
Given your goal, you did a great job.  The topic is mostly &quot;How bad
was the beginning of LTK?&quot; (which didn't bother me) and &quot;Would it be
improved, and by how much, by making changes X, Y and Z?&quot;

I'll try to duck out of the thread now, but, again...  nice work!

outdoors first as Bond walked away from a group of babes, to at least

available.  Again, I could only work with what I had and the rest is

--- The original cut actually continued from that point.  As I recall,
Ford continues to narrate [the original film had Ford's narration
throughout it] on the meaning of it all as he was flying across a
bright treed landscape, in contrast to the darkness of the city he
inhabited.  I forget what he said in it but it had something to do
with finding himself and I think he ended up with the girl, but you
didn't see her in the final scene.  I don't think you even saw Ford,
it was just the camera's p.o.v. of flying over the landscape as he
narrated his understanding of things.  When I saw the original in the
theater on its release, it didn't strike me as something that
should've been cut out, so I'm not sure why it was.  I even liked the
narration, it fit the film with Ford's dry style and really added to
the world-weary mood, so I don't even know why that was cut out too.

&gt; Actually, I don't think anyone's questioning the quality of your work.
&gt; Given your goal, you did a great job.  The topic is mostly &quot;How bad
&gt; was the beginning of LTK?&quot; (which didn't bother me) and &quot;Would it be
&gt; improved, and by how much, by making changes X, Y and Z?&quot;

--- So you're saying that getting to the church on time is a better,
or just as good,  lead-in to the Licence to Kill title than Bond's
pissed-off revenge reaction shot?  Personally, I think if you have a
title like Licence to Kill, you make good use of it to amplify it, not
throw it away on something as disconnected as a wedding.  But then,
that's just me.

Pace and sequence are two different things.  It was the pace that was too
frantic, not the sequence.

To improve your cut I reckon you need to add some padding so the main plot
doesn't race forward (frantically) at 100 miles an hour.  Maybe 10 or so
minutes of side plot and character development would do it......

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Your problem is you don't know the difference between timeframes and
chronology.  I never said anything about chronology.

You changed the timeframe in which the events take place by cutting 24
minutes of film down to 11.  This then speeds up the time in which the
events seem to occur.

--- The movie has a running time of 2 hours 13 min.  If the PCS and
truck chase [that one's coming soon!] had been re-edited to my briefer
versions, the film would still clock in at nearly 2 hours, or about 1
hour 57 min.  There's enough length to the body of the film without
having to give it even more length at the beginning of it with &quot;some
padding.&quot; Ironically, though, my PCS does come in at about a minute
longer than the original one.

But that aside, the main plot really doesn't begin until after the
song.  The point of my PCS was to take everything that was after the
song and bring it before it so that Bond's reaction of wanting to
avenge Felix's maiming leads into the title Licence to Kill, thus
making a direct connection between that reaction and the title and
givng weight to the actual theme of the film, and then the main plot
of following up on that revenge appears after the song.  There's your
real timeframes.  And as I mentioned before, the original PCS really
adds nothing that's integral to the film which isn't already captured
in my PCS, so the &quot;padding&quot; then only becomes needless &quot;fat&quot;.

The problem with the way you're looking at it is that you're not
detaching yourself from the original film.  You're still thinking of
the original PCS as being necessary and that's conflicting with the
way you see my PCS.  If the film had been originally released with my
PCS and you had never seen the original, chances are pretty good you
wouldn't even have given it a second thought as to its pacing and
timeframes and would've went right along with it just fine. I'm
getting along with it just fine and don't even miss the original PCS a
bit, thanks to my being able to detach myself from the original -
which is what makes for a great editor.

--- No timeframes were changed, because nothing happened in the
original PCS that needed to be in the film in the first place.  Study
that original PCS and what follows it after the song, make notes as
you go along, and if you're any good at spotting redundancies and
useless bits, you'd see that there's not one thing in the original PCS
that really needs to be in the film, except for when Sanchez punishes
the girl, which I moved to right after the song where it delivers more
of a punch and also sustains the cruelty level of Sanchez that's first
seen in the PCS.  Everything else is useless.  Did we need to see the
radar plane?  No.  It didn't advance the plot any.  Did we need to see
Bond and Felix rushing to a wedding?  No.  The wedding reception scene
in my PCS is enough to let you know that a wedding has taken place.
Did we have to see Sanchez fleeing from Bond, Felix and the Coast
Guard?  No.  We already know in my PCS he got captured the first time,
all we need to see is his escape from that capture, that's the
important scene that really gets things going.

But if you really want to talk about timeframes, then the original
basically has two of them: pre-wedding in the PCS and post-wedding
after the song.  And in eliminating the pre-wedding stuff, nothing is
really lost.  We still know what the story is in my PCS with Felix
getting married and Sanchez being a threat, and the Disney-like get-me-
to-the-church comedy skit is replaced by a leaner, meaner, terser time-
for-revenge lead-in to the song and film title.  You either like your
Bond Disney or deadly.  I'll take mine deadly, thank you.
