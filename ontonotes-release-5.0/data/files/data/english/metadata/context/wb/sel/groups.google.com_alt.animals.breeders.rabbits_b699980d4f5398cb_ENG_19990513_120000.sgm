In this week's newly redesigned Slate ( www.slate.com ), the People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), the controversial animal rights
group, launches one of the first online attack ads aimed at Al Gore's
support of Animal testing.
http://www.slate.com/Advertorial/99-05-05/Advertorial.asp  'The
foolishness of politicians is always good for a laugh. But when elected
officials start destroying more than their reputations, things stop
being funny.' So writes Politically Incorrect host Bill Maher in a
recent letter to Al Gore supporters. Rock legend Paul McCartney
personally implores the Vice resident to respond to 'compassionate
people everywhere' and restructure his 'high production volume (HPV)
chemical-testing program' that will condemn millions of animals to
painful and needless deaths.
