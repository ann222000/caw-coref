Property owners held liable for consumption of tenants.

The supply of water and electricity, here in S.Africa is NOT like the
N. American utility company model . It's charges are bundled together
with the land taxes by the municipal monopoly supplier.

The legislation is based on a 1937 municipal ordinance, apparently
originated from the British colonial system law.

This ordinance, was recently challenged, in a class action, under
the new constitution, which has a bill of rights etc.

The judgment [CCT 1/04] extract reads:
"...This judgment holds that the owner of property is, in effect,
obliged to ensure that certain consumption charges owing to the
municipality in connection with a property are paid before that
property can be validly transferred....
The purpose of s 118(1) is to furnish a form of security to
municipalities for the payment of amounts due in respect of the
consumption of water and electricity (consumption charges).
.....Municipalities are obliged to provide water and electricity to
the residents in their area as a matter of public duty."

"This judgment" Refers to the lower court judgment which confirmed
that the existing ordinance, allows the municipal authorities to veto
any property transfer until consumption charges are settled.
The rational is explained in the other two sentences.

The constitutional court class action litigants claimed that it was
unconstitutional to charge the property owner for services which he
had not received. The Court rejected that and upheld the 1937
ordinance that the owner was responsible for the tenant's consumption.

Obviously with owners being predominantly 'white' and tenants
'black' the decision was in the black-majority-government interests.

Apart from that, the 3rd sentence above of the Court: "public duty"
gives an indication of how [especially water] is considered as a kind
of sacred commodity.  Ie. the normal law of 'man buys horse' doesn't
apply.  It's like primary education, drugs, insurance: certain standards
must be kept ?

I think the constitutional Court ruling was wrong, because, confirming
the abnormal/sacred nature of water and electricity, the law is that
no one may resell these commodities.

Corresponding to the principle that 'one cannot grant/transfer greater
rights than what one possesses' - which Roman law principle is
accepted here - I feel that since the commodity cannot be traded,
so also the responsibility cannot be transfered to a non-consumer.

Q-  If the tenants transfers the obligation to pay to the owner,
then is there not supposed to be a corresponding right transfered
to the owner ?

Q-  What is this corresponding right ?

Q- Are there other similar laws where a person has to accept
responsibility like a parent/guardian for other person's acts ?

Obviously I'm referring to situations where the tenant signs for
and pays a deposit for water & electricity supplies, and then later
is allowed, by the municipality, to fall into arreas in excess of the
deposit.

The reason that the matter[s] escalated into a class action in the
constitutional court, is that after the 'liberation movement' gained
political power, the municipal authorities have gone into a
nation-wide billing chaos situation, with massive amounts
owed by tenants to the municipal authorities.   A futile cinderella
like belief that such problems, although caused by physical realities
can be solved by the Courts, is held by many old-timers who
expect previous standards to be upheld.

Q- Since in the '70s parts of New York were reported to be
abandoned, as has now become common in S.Africa, was
a similar mechanism as described above, at work in NY then ?

Thanks for any feedback,

A key reason the courts rejected that claim was that it obviously, and
trivially, begs the question whether the property owner who has opted
to rent out his property to tenants "had not received" the commodities
and services in question.

The legislation to which you refer merely in this respect says to the
landowner who choose to rent to tenants:

"You will be deemed to have 'received' these utilities /
services upon their delivery to your property and use by
tenants you have selected and have chosen to rent to
although it is of course open to you to compute and to
charge and collect from your tenants a sum for rent
that will make you whole for the sums that are payable
for such water and related utilities that the government
provides at your request to your property to enable you
lawfully to lease out the premises for your economic
benefit."

Whether deliberately or not, I don't know; but this latter asserted
factoid is a diversionary misstatement from what is a seriously
contested political (and in part constitutional) and economic
phenomena in your country which, in fact, have very much to do with
efforts in to resell such commodites/serives -- i.e., efforts (as in
some other parts of Africa and elsewhere) to "privatize" water
(despite, in So. Africa, constitutional protections in this
connection) and related governmental goods/services.

But even if one were to posit arguendo that you are correct to say
that it would not be lawful in So. Africa for anyone to resell these
commodities/services, this does not have anything to do with the
related question under the So. African (and like) constitution(s)
whether a person who chooses to use his property for commercially rent
generating purposes may reasonably be deemed to have "received"
utility services at his property which would not be needed nor used if
the property were not occupied by his tenants.

Ordinances of the sort to which you refer are not premised for their
constitutional and other legitimacy on and at the same time do not
violate the principle you here posit.

They (quite simply) underscore a principle that one would think any
actually practical and sensible landowner who decides to lease his
property to tenants would know and (in his own self-interest) avail
himself of; and yet the allocation of risk in this respect ordinarily
would be minimal, since if  the landowner who wants to avoid the lien
to which you refer may operate his business of renting his property
accordingly by, at the least, seeing to it that the rent he charges
covers these utilities charges and that he acts in actually timely
fashion to collect the rent unlike, as you earlier indicated you chose
to do, being, as you were, in effect a passive "rentier" (or, in your
case, apparently, an almost completely "absentee landlord" who
exacerbated his indifference to his own self interest by hiring an
also indifferent and incompetent person as his property's
custodian/manager and who then did not bother to see to it that the
rent collections his property's manager agreed to make were indeed
current and otherwise adequate to cover these charges).

But other than in general to bemoan the passing of Apartheid, you
certainly have never reported any state of facts about your past
ownership of the real property to which you referred many times in the
past that showed that you could not (if you had actually chosen to do
so) managed your property in a way that might easily have avoided the
accrual of unpaid municipal services for which you opted.

Are you suggesting seriously and in good faith that the actually
diligent landlowner/landlord who proceeds in timely fashion and on the
basis of good record-keeping, etc., to monitor (and, as appropriate,
to respond to including by timely/record-backed negotiation or, if
necessary, appropriate litigation to insure proper billings for
utilities services) as meanwhile obtaining rent from or the eviction
by reason of rent nonpayment by a tenant in arrears is without any
remedy in these respects?

Do you seriously believe that notions of "rights" in these contexts
can have any meaning you nonetheless assert but without regard to a
stable governmental structure that includes courts or other means to
enforce private/commercial contracts (like residential leases) by
providing an infrastructure which include courts in which landlords
may seek the state enforceable eviction of tenants who don't pay their
agreed/lease-required rent?

You begin your present posting/query by (again) noting that, in your
country, water and related utility charges are bundled together with
the land taxes by the municipal monopoly supplier.

And just as it would be open to you to challenge a tax bill that
charged you on the basis of land twice as large in area or a building
thereon twice as large as the building you owned, you may (if you
acted in timely and adequately record-backed fashion) challenge (and,
if need be, sue with respect to) bills for water of [2#]
litres/gallons if only [#] litres/gallons were used at your building

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Having earlier said that you have been a landlord of residential real
property you rented to tenants, are you suggesting that you are
entirely unaware of whatever are the relevant municipality's housing
maintenance and related building and fire safety, etc., laws which
impose obligations of compliance on landlord/owners even if (and, for
that matter, perhaps especially if) rented to and occupied by tenants?

Are there not laws in your area of your country comparable to those
that predominate throughout the U.S. to the effect that the owner of a
motor vehicle who allows another to drive it on public roads will be
held liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by that
other person even if the vehicle's owner is not in the vehicle at the
damage causing time?

Or laws comparable to others also long prevalent in the U.S. to the
effect that a private sector employer is required to withhold and turn
over (pay) to the government income taxes in respect of his employees
and shall be held personally responsible therefor if the employer
(and, for that matter, certain  "responsible persons" individually who
are affiliated with a corporate employer) if they fail to do so?
Etc., etc.
