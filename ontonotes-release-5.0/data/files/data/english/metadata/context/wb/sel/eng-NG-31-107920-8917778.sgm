...and smashes into Lewis cause he can't beat him.  Think of Damon Hill
smashing into Schuey back in '95.

Kimi winning the championship on the last race would be priceless.

Fuck it feels strange to be genuinely cheering for Ferrari.

IF Alonso smashes into Hamilton, Massa can win at home. 8 points for
second place would be enough for Kimi.

That would be nice way to show Dennis middle finger.

He's been shooting himself in the foot for most of the year. I reckon

I still think that the ultimate hypothetical &quot;middle finger&quot; given by a driver
to management would have been when Eddie Irvine had a shot in 1999 of winning
Ferrari's first DWC in 20-years following Schumacher breaking a leg at
Silverstone, and would have taken the coveted number 1 on the car to Jaguar the
following season.

There was one key race when Eddie pulled into the Ferrari pits and the team
only had 3 tires to put on the car!  Ferrari making a mistake!  Impossible!

Ferrari appeared to hand the crown to Häkkinen that year because the
circumstances weren't acceptable.  Häkkinen ended up with 76 points to Irvine's
74 in 1999!

Perhaps you should see that one again.

Damon deliberately smashing Schuey is a pretty strange idea, especially since
Hill had the line and Schuey appeared to have an obvious handling problem after
contact with the wall seconds earlier.

It was a few times in 95 as I recall.  Funny stuff.

As for '94, Schuey did it on purpose, forever tainting his achievements.

The perfect end would be seeing a Ferrari blowing up in the pits and burning
all the red cheats in there,,, That would be worth recording for all time!
(a fitting end to a team that has constantly screwed F1 with open support
from the FIA)

What a fantastic screensaver too.

Don't forget Jerez where Villeneuve intentionally positioned his car so
that Schumacher would ram him!
