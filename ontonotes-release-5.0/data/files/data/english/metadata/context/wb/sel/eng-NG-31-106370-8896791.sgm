The Public Relations Industry's
Secret War on Activists&quot;The 20th century has been characterized by

All Lynn Tylczak wanted to do was keep a few kids from being poisoned.
A housewife in Oregon, her imagination was captured by a PBS
documentary about a technique used in Europe to prevent children from
accidentally swallowing household poisons. Common antifreeze, for
example, is made of ethylene glycol, whose sweet taste and smell
belies its highly poisonous nature. As little as two teaspoons can
cause death or blindness. About 700 children under the age of six are
exposed to antifreeze each year, and it is the leading cause of
accidental animal poisoning affecting both pets and wild animals.(2)

European antifreeze makers poison-proof their products by adding the
&quot;bitterant&quot; denatonium benzoate. Two cents worth makes a gallon of
antifreeze taste so vile that kids spit it out the instant it touches
their mouth.

Tylczak launched a one-woman crusade, the &quot;Poison Proof Project&quot; to
persuade antifreeze makers to add bitterant. Her storymade the New
York Times and Oprah Winfrey, prompting a swiftbacklash from
antifreeze makers.

She remembers one company's PR representative threatening that he
could pay someone $2,000 to have her shot if she didn't back off.

When Tylczak began pushing for legislation to require bitterant,
another PR firm was sent into the breach: National Grassroots and
Communications, which specializes in &quot;passing and defeating
legislation at the federal and state level.&quot;  Tylczak had never even
heard of the firm until its CEO, Pamela Whitney, made the mistake of
bragging about her exploits at a PR trade seminar. &quot;The key to winning
anything is opposition research,&quot; she said.&quot;We set up an operation
where we posed as representatives of the estate of an older lady who
had died and wanted to leave quite a bit of money to an organization
that helped both children and animals. We went in and met with
[Tylczak] and said, 'We want to bequeath $100,000 to an organization;
you're one of three that we are targeting to look at. Give us all of
your financial records..., all of your game plan for the following
year, and the states you want to target and how you expect to win.
We'll get back to you.&quot;' (3)

Whitney claimed that the records she received contained two
bombshells:  ThePoison Proof Project's tax-exempt status had lapsed,
and it had taken funding from bitterant manufacturers. &quot;Without
leaving any fingerprints or any traces,&quot; Whitney boasted, &quot;we then got
word through the local media and killed the bill in all the states.&quot;
(4) 1. isolate the radicals; 2.&quot;cultivate&quot; the idealists and &quot;educate&quot;
them into becoming realists; then 3. co-opt the realists

When the story got back to Tylczak, she noted that only $100 of the
$50,000 in family savings spent on the campaign came from bitterant
makers. &quot;She's got a very foolish client,&quot; Tylczak said. &quot;Her story
has got more bullshit than a cattle ranch.&quot;  In fact,she noted, her
bill requiring bitterant did pass in Oregon.

What did the PR industry accomplish in its battle against Lynn
Tylczak? Were news stories or legislation killed because ofWhitney's
intervention? In this and other cases, the degree of success PR firms
have in manipulating public opinion and policy is almost imposssible
to determine. By design, the PR industry carefully conceals many of
its activities. &quot;Persuasion, by its definition, is subtle,&quot; says one
PR executive. &quot;The best PR ends up looking like news.You never know
when a PR agency is being effective; you'll just find your views
slowly shifting.&quot; (5) Using money provided by its special interest
clients -- usually large corporations, business associations and
governments -- the PR industry has vast power to direct and control
thought and policy. It can mobilize private detectives, lawyers, and
spies; influence editorial and news decisions; broadcast faxes;
generate letters; launch phony &quot;grassroots&quot;campaigns; and use
high-tech information systems such as satellite feeds and internet
sites.

Activist groups and concerned individuals often fail to recognize the
techniques and assess the impact of PR campaigns. And indeed, with its
$10 billion-a-year bankroll and its array of complex, sophisticated
persuasive weaponry, the PR industry can often out maneuver,
overpower, and outlast true citizen reformers. Identifying the
techniques of the industry and understanding how they work are the
first steps in fighting back.

Spies for Hire

In 1990, David Steinman's book Diet for a Poisoned Planet, was
scheduled for publication. Based on five years of research, it
detailed evidence that hundreds of carcinogens, pesticides, and other
toxins contaminate the US food chain. It documented, for example, that
&quot;raisins had 110 industrial chemical and pesticide residues in 16
samples,&quot; and recommended buying only organically grown varieties. (6)
Diet for a Poisoned Planet enabled readers to make safer food choices.
But before they could use the information, they had to know about the
book so that they could buy and read it. In the weeks after it came
out, Steinman's publisher scheduled the usual round of media reviews
and interviews, not suspecting that the California Raisin Advisory
Board (CALRAB) had already launched a campaign to ensure that
Steinman's book would be dead on arrival.

The stakes were high. In 1986, CAL RAB had scored big with a series of
clever TV commercials using the &quot;California Dancing Raisins&quot; that
pushed up raisin sales by 17 percent. Steinman's book threatened to
trip up the careful PR choreography.

To kill the Steinman book, CALRAB hired Ketchum PR Worldwide, whose
$50 million a year in net fees made it the country's sixth largest
public relations company.  Months before the publication of Diet for a
Poisoned Planet, Ketchum sought to &quot;obtain [a] copy of [the] book
galleys or manuscript and publisher's tour schedule,&quot; wrote senior
vice-president Betsy Gullickson in a secret September 7, 1990 memo
outlining the PR firm's plan to &quot;manage the crisis.&quot; All
documents...are confidential. Make sure that everything -- even notes
to yourself -- are so stamped. ...Remember that we have a shredder;
give documents to Lynette for shredding. All conversations are
confidential, too. Please be careful talking in the halls, in
elevators, in restaurants, etc. All suppliers must sign
confidentiality agreements. If you are faxing documents to the client,
another office or to anyone else, call them to let them know that a
fax is coming. If you are expecting a fax, you or your Account
Coordinator should stand by the machine and wait for it. (7)

Gullickson's memo outlined a plan to assign &quot;broad areas of
responsibility,&quot; such as &quot;intelligence/information gathering,&quot; to
specific Ketchum employees and to Gary Obenauf of CALRAB.  She
recommended that spokespeople &quot;conduct one-on-one briefings/interviews
with the trade and general consumer media in the markets most acutely
interested in the issue .... [Ketchum] is currently attempting to get
a tour schedule so that we can 'shadow' Steinman's appearances; best
scenario: we will have our spokesman in town prior to or in
conjunction with Steinman's appearances.&quot; (8)

After an informant involved with the book's marketing campaign passed
Ketchum a list of Steinman's talk show bookings, Ketchum employees
called each show.  The PR firm then made a list of key media to
receive low-key phone inquiries. They tried to depict Steinman as an
off-the-wall extremist without credibility, or argued that it was only
fair that the other side be presented. A number of programs canceled
or failed to air interviews.  In the end, an important contribution to
the public debate over health, the environment, and food safety fell
victim to a PR campaign designed to prevent it from ever reaching the
marketplace of ideas. (9)

Divide and Conquer

Ronald Duchin, senior vice president of another PR spy firm --
Mongoven, Biscoe,and Duchin -- would probably have labeled Steinman
and Tylczak radicals. A graduate of the US Army War College, Duchin
worked as a special assistant to the secretary of defense and director
of public affairs for the Veterans of Foreign Wars before becoming a
flack. Activists, he explained, fall into four categories: radicals,
opportunists, idealists, and realists.  He follows a three-step
strategy to neutralize them: 1) isolate the radicals; 2) &quot;cultivate&quot;
the idealists and &quot;educate&quot; them into becoming realists; then 3)
co-opt the realists into agreeing with industry.
According to Duchin, radical activists:
want to change the system; have underlying socio/political motives
[and] see multinational corporationsas inherently evil....These
organizations do not trust the...federal, state and local governments
to protect them and to safeguard the environment. They believe,
rather,that individuals and local groups should have direct power over
industry.... I would categorize their justice and political
empowerment.
Idealists are also &quot;hard to deal with.&quot;  They &quot;want a perfect world
and find it easy to brand any product or practice which can be shown
to mar that perfection as evil.  Because of their intrinsic altruism,
however, and because they have nothing perceptible to be gained by
holding their position, they are easily believed by both the media and
the public, and sometimes even

If folks hadn't been paying attention all these years, they might even
buy a bit of Ilena's claims.  But there's the archives, the wonderful
archives.

All one need do, is search the archives, and witness for themselves,
who it was, and when they did it, that brought all the parties to
alt.support.breast-implant newsgroup, that had absolutely nothing to
do with breast implants.

Yep folks, it's always been Ilena Rosenthal, the non-implanted, self-
embedded, &quot;advocate&quot; for women harmed by breast implants, that
infiltrated our midst to abuse the victims, divide, distract, while
she self-promoted.

One by one, those who Ilena Rosenthal proclaims as the &quot;rag-tag&quot;
posse' began showing up here on this board.  The history of Ilena's
imposing her-self in the midst of non-related newsgroups, doing war,
and then bringing them back here to continue her battles, is long and
arduous. . .AND it's ALL very well documented in the archives of this
newsgroup, and the newsgroups of other non-related interests.

Simply plug in &quot;Ilena Rosenthal&quot; into Google Groups, and wait for your
computer to nearly go nutz.

Who is Coleah Penley Ayers?. . .She is a woman harmed by breast
implants.

Who am I?. . .I am a woman harmed by breast implants.

Most of the &quot;shit pages&quot; that Ilena Rosenthal has posted on her non-
profit webspace, are devoted to breast implanted women, she proclaims
to be advocating for.

Many of these women, would not even know the other folks that are not,
if it weren't for Ilena Rosenthal bringing them back to this
newsgroup, to continue her INSANE battles.

The one common denominator among all the parties who have Ilena
Rosenthal &quot;shit pages&quot; devoted to them, is the fact that they are so
much in agreement, that Ilena Rosenthal is an abusive, self- serving,
self-promoting, divisive, disruptive force in the universe.

Many more believe that Ilena Rosenthal is nothing more than an
infiltrator, and a PR nightmare bomb, doing the bidding of the implant
manufacturers, and the plastic surgeons.

One thing for certain, the archives and evidence clearly show her
conversations and her flirtateous invites to share her bath time, with
the President of McGhan.  And her deliberate seeking out of Nate
Schactman, Bristol Meyer Squibb attorney, while they were in Judge
Pointer's courtroom.  While there, private information about a breast
implant victim was shared, and Ilena Rosenthal took that information
to this Newsgroup, and shared it over the internet.

For many verifiable facts surrounding Ilena Rosenthal's infiltration
of the breast implant victim community, please visit:

http://www.ilena-rosenthal.com

Read where she was tossed off Trash Talk.  Read where the FDA removed
her as a resource, because of her &quot;shit pages.&quot;  Read where she was
blocked from Wikipedia.

Most every newsgroup that Ilena Rosenthal has sat her intrusive
presence into, has an archive that bears witness to the carnage she
imposes on people.

Read 'em and weap!

To kill the Steinman book, CALRAB hired Ketchum PR Worldwide, whose
$50 million a year in net fees made it the country's sixth largest
public relations company.  Months before the publication of Diet for a
Poisoned Planet, Ketchum sought to &quot;obtain [a] copy of [the] book
galleys or manuscript and publisher's tour schedule,&quot; wrote senior
vice-president Betsy Gullickson in a secret September 7, 1990 memo
outlining the PR firm's plan to &quot;manage the crisis.&quot; All
documents...are confidential. Make sure that everything -- even notes
to yourself -- are so stamped. ...Remember that we have a shredder;
give documents to Lynette for shredding. All conversations are
confidential, too. Please be careful talking in the halls, in
elevators, in restaurants, etc. All suppliers must sign
confidentiality agreements. If you are faxing documents to the client,
another office or to anyone else, call them to let them know that a
fax is coming. If you are expecting a fax, you or your Account
Coordinator should stand by the machine and wait for it. (7)

Gullickson's memo outlined a plan to assign &quot;broad areas of
responsibility,&quot; such as &quot;intelligence/information gathering,&quot; to
specific Ketchum employees and to Gary Obenauf of CALRAB.  She
recommended that spokespeople &quot;conduct one-on-one briefings/interviews
with the trade and general consumer media in the markets most acutely
interested in the issue .... [Ketchum] is currently attempting to get
a tour schedule so that we can 'shadow' Steinman's appearances; best
scenario: we will have our spokesman in town prior to or in
conjunction with Steinman's appearances.&quot; (8)

After an informant involved with the book's marketing campaign passed
Ketchum a list of Steinman's talk show bookings, Ketchum employees
called each show.  The PR firm then made a list of key media to
receive low-key phone inquiries. They tried to depict Steinman as an
off-the-wall extremist without credibility, or argued that it was only
fair that the other side be presented. A number of programs canceled
or failed to air interviews.  In the end, an important contribution to
the public debate over health, the environment, and food safety fell
victim to a PR campaign designed to prevent it from ever reaching the
marketplace of ideas. (9)

Divide and Conquer

Ronald Duchin, senior vice president of another PR spy firm --
Mongoven, Biscoe,and Duchin -- would probably have labeled Steinman
and Tylczak radicals. A graduate of the US Army War College, Duchin
worked as a special assistant to the secretary of defense and director
of public affairs for the Veterans of Foreign Wars before becoming a
flack. Activists, he explained, fall into four categories: radicals,
opportunists, idealists, and realists.  He follows a three-step
strategy to neutralize them: 1) isolate the radicals; 2) &quot;cultivate&quot;
the idealists and &quot;educate&quot; them into becoming realists; then 3)
co-opt the realists into agreeing with industry.
According to Duchin, radical activists:
want to change the system; have underlying socio/political motives
[and] see multinational corporationsas inherently evil....These
organizations do not trust the...federal, state and local governments
to protect them and to safeguard the environment. They believe,
rather,that individuals and local groups should have direct power over
industry.... I would categorize their justice and political
empowerment.
Idealists are also &quot;hard to deal with.&quot;  They &quot;want a perfect world
and find it easy to brand any product or practice which can be shown
to mar that perfection as evil.  Because of their intrinsic altruism,

Deforming Consent:
The Public Relations Industry's
Secret War on Activists&quot;The 20th century has been characterized by
three developments of great political importance: the growth of
democracy, the growth of corporate power, and the growth of corporate
propaganda as a means of protecting corporate power against
democracy.&quot; -- Alex Carey

by
John Stauber and
Sheldon Rampton

All Lynn Tylczak wanted to do was keep a few kids from being poisoned.
A housewife in Oregon, her imagination was captured by a PBS
documentary about a technique used in Europe to prevent children from
accidentally swallowing household poisons. Common antifreeze, for
example, is made of ethylene glycol, whose sweet taste and smell
belies its highly poisonous nature. As little as two teaspoons can
cause death or blindness. About 700 children under the age of six are
exposed to antifreeze each year, and it is the leading cause of
accidental animal poisoning affecting both pets and wild animals.(2)

European antifreeze makers poison-proof their products by adding the
&quot;bitterant&quot; denatonium benzoate. Two cents worth makes a gallon of
antifreeze taste so vile that kids spit it out the instant it touches
their mouth.

Tylczak launched a one-woman crusade, the &quot;Poison Proof Project&quot; to
persuade antifreeze makers to add bitterant. Her storymade the New
York Times and Oprah Winfrey, prompting a swiftbacklash from
antifreeze makers.

She remembers one company's PR representative threatening that he
could pay someone $2,000 to have her shot if she didn't back off.

When Tylczak began pushing for legislation to require bitterant,
another PR firm was sent into the breach: National Grassroots and
Communications, which specializes in &quot;passing and defeating
legislation at the federal and state level.&quot;  Tylczak had never even
heard of the firm until its CEO, Pamela Whitney, made the mistake of
bragging about her exploits at a PR trade seminar. &quot;The key to winning
anything is opposition research,&quot; she said.&quot;We set up an operation
where we posed as representatives of the estate of an older lady who
had died and wanted to leave quite a bit of money to an organization
that helped both children and animals. We went in and met with
[Tylczak] and said, 'We want to bequeath $100,000 to an organization;
you're one of three that we are targeting to look at. Give us all of
your financial records..., all of your game plan for the following
year, and the states you want to target and how you expect to win.
We'll get back to you.&quot;' (3)

Whitney claimed that the records she received contained two
bombshells:  ThePoison Proof Project's tax-exempt status had lapsed,
and it had taken funding from bitterant manufacturers. &quot;Without
leaving any fingerprints or any traces,&quot; Whitney boasted, &quot;we then got
word through the local media and killed the bill in all the states.&quot;
(4) 1. isolate the radicals; 2.&quot;cultivate&quot; the idealists and &quot;educate&quot;
them into becoming realists; then 3. co-opt the realists

When the story got back to Tylczak, she noted that only $100 of the
$50,000 in family savings spent on the campaign came from bitterant
makers. &quot;She's got a very foolish client,&quot; Tylczak said. &quot;Her story
has got more bullshit than a cattle ranch.&quot;  In fact,she noted, her
bill requiring bitterant did pass in Oregon.

What did the PR industry accomplish in its battle against Lynn
Tylczak? Were news stories or legislation killed because ofWhitney's
intervention? In this and other cases, the degree of success PR firms
have in manipulating public opinion and policy is almost imposssible
to determine. By design, the PR industry carefully conceals many of
its activities. &quot;Persuasion, by its definition, is subtle,&quot; says one
PR executive. &quot;The best PR ends up looking like news.You never know
when a PR agency is being effective; you'll just find your views
slowly shifting.&quot; (5) Using money provided by its special interest
clients -- usually large corporations, business associations and
governments -- the PR industry has vast power to direct and control
thought and policy. It can mobilize private detectives, lawyers, and
spies; influence editorial and news decisions; broadcast faxes;
generate letters; launch phony &quot;grassroots&quot;campaigns; and use
high-tech information systems such as satellite feeds and internet
sites.

Activist groups and concerned individuals often fail to recognize the
techniques and assess the impact of PR campaigns. And indeed, with its
$10 billion-a-year bankroll and its array of complex, sophisticated
persuasive weaponry, the PR industry can often out maneuver,
overpower, and outlast true citizen reformers. Identifying the
techniques of the industry and understanding how they work are the
first steps in fighting back.

Spies for Hire

In 1990, David Steinman's book Diet for a Poisoned Planet, was
scheduled for publication. Based on five years of research, it
detailed evidence that hundreds of carcinogens, pesticides, and other
toxins contaminate the US food chain. It documented, for example, that
&quot;raisins had 110 industrial chemical and pesticide residues in 16
samples,&quot; and recommended buying only organically grown varieties. (6)
Diet for a Poisoned Planet enabled readers to make safer food choices.
But before they could use the information, they had to know about the
book so that they could buy and read it. In the weeks after it came
out, Steinman's publisher scheduled the usual round of media reviews
and interviews, not suspecting that the California Raisin Advisory
Board (CALRAB) had already launched a campaign to ensure that
Steinman's book would be dead on arrival.

The stakes were high. In 1986, CAL RAB had scored big with a series of
clever TV commercials using the &quot;California Dancing Raisins&quot; that
pushed up raisin sales by 17 percent. Steinman's book threatened to
trip up the careful PR choreography.

To kill the Steinman book, CALRAB hired Ketchum PR Worldwide, whose
$50 million a year in net fees made it the country's sixth largest
public relations company.  Months before the publication of Diet for a
Poisoned Planet, Ketchum sought to &quot;obtain [a] copy of [the] book
galleys or manuscript and publisher's tour schedule,&quot; wrote senior
vice-president Betsy Gullickson in a secret September 7, 1990 memo
outlining the PR firm's plan to &quot;manage the crisis.&quot; All
documents...are confidential. Make sure that everything -- even notes
to yourself -- are so stamped. ...Remember that we have a shredder;
give documents to Lynette for shredding. All conversations are
confidential, too. Please be careful talking in the halls, in
elevators, in restaurants, etc. All suppliers must sign
confidentiality agreements. If you are faxing documents to the client,
another office or to anyone else, call them to let them know that a
fax is coming. If you are expecting a fax, you or your Account
Coordinator should stand by the machine and wait for it. (7)

Gullickson's memo outlined a plan to assign &quot;broad areas of
responsibility,&quot; such as &quot;intelligence/information gathering,&quot; to
specific Ketchum employees and to Gary Obenauf of CALRAB.  She
recommended that spokespeople &quot;conduct one-on-one briefings/interviews
with the trade and general consumer media in the markets most acutely
interested in the issue .... [Ketchum] is currently attempting to get
a tour schedule so that we can 'shadow' Steinman's appearances; best
scenario: we will have our spokesman in town prior to or in
conjunction with Steinman's appearances.&quot; (8)

After an informant involved with the book's marketing campaign passed
Ketchum a list of Steinman's talk show bookings, Ketchum employees
called each show.  The PR firm then made a list of key media to
receive low-key phone inquiries. They tried to depict Steinman as an
off-the-wall extremist without credibility, or argued that it was only
fair that the other side be presented. A number of programs canceled
or failed to air interviews.  In the end, an important contribution to
the public debate over health, the environment, and food safety fell
victim to a PR campaign designed to prevent it from ever reaching the
marketplace of ideas. (9)

Divide and Conquer

Ronald Duchin, senior vice president of another PR spy firm --
Mongoven, Biscoe,and Duchin -- would probably have labeled Steinman
and Tylczak radicals. A graduate of the US Army War College, Duchin
worked as a special assistant to the secretary of defense and director

opportunists, idealists, and realists.  He follows a three-step

LOL
I carry weight.
Whoopie.
As I said before, my fat content serves in that it prevents me from
looking...ah...MUCH older than I really am.
I also attribute that to my liftime of abstaining from the sun (nasty for
redheads, fair complexion)
I think you're just jealous because I'm not hitting retirement age yet so
all you can think of to 'insult' me is my weight.
Sad.
My weight doesn't bother me.
It is, however, another one of those 'hitting below the belt' Irene-isms...
I have thyroid disease.
First Im a pervert because I was sexually abused, now I'm a heiffer because
of an illness?
Gosh, can you find ANYTHING else you'd like to attack me about...I
mean...personal things?
Go for it.
Just more fodder for the archives!

Deforming Consent:
The Public Relations Industry's
Secret War on Activists&quot;The 20th century has been characterized by
three developments of great political importance: the growth of
democracy, the growth of corporate power, and the growth of corporate
propaganda as a means of protecting corporate power against
democracy.&quot; -- Alex Carey

by
John Stauber and
Sheldon Rampton

All Lynn Tylczak wanted to do was keep a few kids from being poisoned.
A housewife in Oregon, her imagination was captured by a PBS
documentary about a technique used in Europe to prevent children from
accidentally swallowing household poisons. Common antifreeze, for
example, is made of ethylene glycol, whose sweet taste and smell
belies its highly poisonous nature. As little as two teaspoons can
cause death or blindness. About 700 children under the age of six are
exposed to antifreeze each year, and it is the leading cause of
accidental animal poisoning affecting both pets and wild animals.(2)

European antifreeze makers poison-proof their products by adding the
&quot;bitterant&quot; denatonium benzoate. Two cents worth makes a gallon of
antifreeze taste so vile that kids spit it out the instant it touches
their mouth.

Tylczak launched a one-woman crusade, the &quot;Poison Proof Project&quot; to
persuade antifreeze makers to add bitterant. Her storymade the New
York Times and Oprah Winfrey, prompting a swiftbacklash from
antifreeze makers.

She remembers one company's PR representative threatening that he
could pay someone $2,000 to have her shot if she didn't back off.

When Tylczak began pushing for legislation to require bitterant,
another PR firm was sent into the breach: National Grassroots and
Communications, which specializes in &quot;passing and defeating
legislation at the federal and state level.&quot;  Tylczak had never even
heard of the firm until its CEO, Pamela Whitney, made the mistake of
bragging about her exploits at a PR trade seminar. &quot;The key to winning
anything is opposition research,&quot; she said.&quot;We set up an operation
where we posed as representatives of the estate of an older lady who
had died and wanted to leave quite a bit of money to an organization
that helped both children and animals. We went in and met with
[Tylczak] and said, 'We want to bequeath $100,000 to an organization;
you're one of three that we are targeting to look at. Give us all of
your financial records..., all of your game plan for the following
year, and the states you want to target and how you expect to win.
We'll get back to you.&quot;' (3)

Whitney claimed that the records she received contained two
bombshells:  ThePoison Proof Project's tax-exempt status had lapsed,
and it had taken funding from bitterant manufacturers. &quot;Without
leaving any fingerprints or any traces,&quot; Whitney boasted, &quot;we then got
word through the local media and killed the bill in all the states.&quot;
(4) 1. isolate the radicals; 2.&quot;cultivate&quot; the idealists and &quot;educate&quot;
them into becoming realists; then 3. co-opt the realists

When the story got back to Tylczak, she noted that only $100 of the
$50,000 in family savings spent on the campaign came from bitterant
makers. &quot;She's got a very foolish client,&quot; Tylczak said. &quot;Her story
has got more bullshit than a cattle ranch.&quot;  In fact,she noted, her
bill requiring bitterant did pass in Oregon.

What did the PR industry accomplish in its battle against Lynn
Tylczak? Were news stories or legislation killed because ofWhitney's
intervention? In this and other cases, the degree of success PR firms
have in manipulating public opinion and policy is almost imposssible
to determine. By design, the PR industry carefully conceals many of
its activities. &quot;Persuasion, by its definition, is subtle,&quot; says one
PR executive. &quot;The best PR ends up looking like news.You never know
when a PR agency is being effective; you'll just find your views
slowly shifting.&quot; (5) Using money provided by its special interest
clients -- usually large corporations, business associations and
governments -- the PR industry has vast power to direct and control
thought and policy. It can mobilize private detectives, lawyers, and
spies; influence editorial and news decisions; broadcast faxes;
generate letters; launch phony &quot;grassroots&quot;campaigns; and use
high-tech information systems such as satellite feeds and internet
sites.

Activist groups and concerned individuals often fail to recognize the
techniques and assess the impact of PR campaigns. And indeed, with its
$10 billion-a-year bankroll and its array of complex, sophisticated
persuasive weaponry, the PR industry can often out maneuver,
overpower, and outlast true citizen reformers. Identifying the
techniques of the industry and understanding how they work are the
first steps in fighting back.

Spies for Hire

In 1990, David Steinman's book Diet for a Poisoned Planet, was
scheduled for publication. Based on five years of research, it
detailed evidence that hundreds of carcinogens, pesticides, and other
toxins contaminate the US food chain. It documented, for example, that
&quot;raisins had 110 industrial chemical and pesticide residues in 16
samples,&quot; and recommended buying only organically grown varieties. (6)
Diet for a Poisoned Planet enabled readers to make safer food choices.
But before they could use the information, they had to know about the
book so that they could buy and read it. In the weeks after it came
out, Steinman's publisher scheduled the usual round of media reviews
and interviews, not suspecting that the California Raisin Advisory
Board (CALRAB) had already launched a campaign to ensure that
Steinman's book would be dead on arrival.

The stakes were high. In 1986, CAL RAB had scored big with a series of
clever TV commercials using the &quot;California Dancing Raisins&quot; that
pushed up raisin sales by 17 percent. Steinman's book threatened to
trip up the careful PR choreography.

To kill the Steinman book, CALRAB hired Ketchum PR Worldwide, whose
$50 million a year in net fees made it the country's sixth largest
public relations company.  Months before the publication of Diet for a
Poisoned Planet, Ketchum sought to &quot;obtain [a] copy of [the] book
galleys or manuscript and publisher's tour schedule,&quot; wrote senior
vice-president Betsy Gullickson in a secret September 7, 1990 memo
outlining the PR firm's plan to &quot;manage the crisis.&quot; All
documents...are confidential. Make sure that everything -- even notes
to yourself -- are so stamped. ...Remember that we have a shredder;
give documents to Lynette for shredding. All conversations are
confidential, too. Please be careful talking in the halls, in
elevators, in restaurants, etc. All suppliers must sign
confidentiality agreements. If you are faxing documents to the client,
another office or to anyone else, call them to let them know that a
fax is coming. If you are expecting a fax, you or your Account
Coordinator should stand by the machine and wait for it. (7)

Gullickson's memo outlined a plan to assign &quot;broad areas of
responsibility,&quot; such as &quot;intelligence/information gathering,&quot; to
specific Ketchum employees and to Gary Obenauf of CALRAB.  She
recommended that spokespeople &quot;conduct one-on-one briefings/interviews
with the trade and general consumer media in the markets most acutely
interested in the issue .... [Ketchum] is currently attempting to get
a tour schedule so that we can 'shadow' Steinman's appearances; best
scenario: we will have our spokesman in town prior to or in
conjunction with Steinman's appearances.&quot; (8)

After an informant involved with the book's marketing campaign passed
Ketchum a list of Steinman's talk show bookings, Ketchum employees
called each show.  The PR firm then made a list of key media to
receive low-key phone inquiries. They tried to depict Steinman as an
off-the-wall extremist without credibility, or argued that it was only
fair that the other side be presented. A number of programs canceled
or failed to air interviews.  In the end, an important contribution to
the public debate over health, the environment, and food safety fell
victim to a PR campaign designed to prevent it from ever reaching the
marketplace of ideas. (9)

Divide and Conquer

Ronald Duchin, senior vice president of another PR spy firm --
Mongoven, Biscoe,and Duchin -- would probably have labeled Steinman
and Tylczak radicals. A graduate of the US Army War College, Duchin
worked as a special assistant to the secretary of defense and director
of public affairs for the Veterans of Foreign Wars before becoming a
flack. Activists, he explained, fall into four categories: radicals,
opportunists, idealists, and realists.  He follows a three-step
strategy to neutralize them: 1) isolate the radicals; 2) &quot;cultivate&quot;
the idealists and &quot;educate&quot; them into becoming realists; then 3)
co-opt the realists into agreeing with industry.
According to Duchin, radical activists:
want to change the system; have underlying socio/political motives
[and] see multinational corporationsas inherently evil....These
organizations do not trust the...federal, state and local governments
to protect them and to safeguard the environment. They believe,
rather,that individuals and local groups should have direct power over
industry.... I would categorize their justice and political
empowerment.
Idealists are also &quot;hard to deal with.&quot;  They &quot;want a perfect world
and find it easy to brand any product or practice which can be shown
to mar that perfection as evil.  Because of their intrinsic altruism,
however, and because they have nothing perceptible to be gained by
holding their position, they are easily believed by both the media and
the public, and sometimes even
...

&gt; Deforming Consent:
&gt; The Public Relations Industry's
&gt; Secret War on Activists&quot;The 20th century has been characterized by
&gt; three developments of great political importance: the growth of
&gt; democracy, the growth of corporate power, and the growth of corporate
&gt; propaganda as a means of protecting corporate power against
&gt; democracy.&quot; -- Alex Carey

&gt; by
&gt; John Stauber and
&gt; Sheldon Rampton

&gt; All Lynn Tylczak wanted to do was keep a few kids from being poisoned.
&gt; A housewife in Oregon, her imagination was captured by a PBS
&gt; documentary about a technique used in Europe to prevent children from
&gt; accidentally swallowing household poisons. Common antifreeze, for
&gt; example, is made of ethylene glycol, whose sweet taste and smell
&gt; belies its highly poisonous nature. As little as two teaspoons can
&gt; cause death or blindness. About 700 children under the age of six are
&gt; exposed to antifreeze each year, and it is the leading cause of
&gt; accidental animal poisoning affecting both pets and wild animals.(2)

&gt; European antifreeze makers poison-proof their products by adding the
&gt; &quot;bitterant&quot; denatonium benzoate. Two cents worth makes a gallon of
&gt; antifreeze taste so vile that kids spit it out the instant it touches
&gt; their mouth.

&gt; Tylczak launched a one-woman crusade, the &quot;Poison Proof Project&quot; to
&gt; persuade antifreeze makers to add bitterant. Her storymade the New
&gt; York Times and Oprah Winfrey, prompting a swiftbacklash from
&gt; antifreeze makers.

&gt; She remembers one company's PR representative threatening that he
&gt; could pay someone $2,000 to have her shot if she didn't back off.

&gt; When Tylczak began pushing for legislation to require bitterant,
&gt; another PR firm was sent into the breach: National Grassroots and
&gt; Communications, which specializes in &quot;passing and defeating
&gt; legislation at the federal and state level.&quot;  Tylczak had never even
&gt; heard of the firm until its CEO, Pamela Whitney, made the mistake of
&gt; bragging about her exploits at a PR trade seminar. &quot;The key to winning
&gt; anything is opposition research,&quot; she said.&quot;We set up an operation
&gt; where we posed as representatives of the estate of an older lady who
&gt; had died and wanted to leave quite a bit of money to an organization
&gt; that helped both children and animals. We went in and met with
&gt; [Tylczak] and said, 'We want to bequeath $100,000 to an organization;
&gt; you're one of three that we are targeting to look at. Give us all of
&gt; your financial records..., all of your game plan for the following
&gt; year, and the states you want to target and how you expect to win.
&gt; We'll get back to you.&quot;' (3)

&gt; Whitney claimed that the records she received contained two
&gt; bombshells:  ThePoison Proof Project's tax-exempt status had lapsed,
&gt; and it had taken funding from bitterant manufacturers. &quot;Without
&gt; leaving any fingerprints or any traces,&quot; Whitney boasted, &quot;we then got
&gt; word through the local media and killed the bill in all the states.&quot;
&gt; (4) 1. isolate the radicals; 2.&quot;cultivate&quot; the idealists and &quot;educate&quot;
&gt; them into becoming realists; then 3. co-opt the realists

&gt; When the story got back to Tylczak, she noted that only $100 of the
&gt; $50,000 in family savings spent on the campaign came from bitterant
&gt; makers. &quot;She's got a very foolish client,&quot; Tylczak said. &quot;Her story
&gt; has got more bullshit than a cattle ranch.&quot;  In fact,she noted, her
&gt; bill requiring bitterant did pass in Oregon.

&gt; What did the PR industry accomplish in its battle against Lynn
&gt; Tylczak? Were news stories or legislation killed because ofWhitney's
&gt; intervention? In this and other cases, the degree of success PR firms
&gt; have in manipulating public opinion and policy is almost imposssible
&gt; to determine. By design, the PR industry carefully conceals many of
&gt; its activities. &quot;Persuasion, by its definition, is subtle,&quot; says one
&gt; PR executive. &quot;The best PR ends up looking like news.You never know
&gt; when a PR agency is being effective; you'll just find your views
&gt; slowly shifting.&quot; (5) Using money provided by its special interest
&gt; clients -- usually large corporations, business associations and
&gt; governments -- the PR industry has vast power to direct and control
&gt; thought and policy. It can mobilize private detectives, lawyers, and
&gt; spies; influence editorial and news decisions; broadcast faxes;
&gt; generate letters; launch phony &quot;grassroots&quot;campaigns; and use
&gt; high-tech information systems such as satellite feeds and internet
&gt; sites.

&gt; Activist groups and concerned individuals often fail to recognize the
&gt; techniques and assess the impact of PR campaigns. And indeed, with its
&gt; $10 billion-a-year bankroll and its array of complex, sophisticated
&gt; persuasive weaponry, the PR industry can often out maneuver,
&gt; overpower, and outlast true citizen reformers. Identifying the
&gt; techniques of the industry and understanding how they work are the
&gt; first steps in fighting back.

&gt; Spies for Hire

&gt; In 1990, David Steinman's book Diet for a Poisoned Planet, was
&gt; scheduled for publication. Based on five years of research, it
&gt; detailed evidence that hundreds of carcinogens, pesticides, and other
&gt; toxins contaminate the US food chain. It documented, for example, that
&gt; &quot;raisins had 110 industrial chemical and pesticide residues in 16
&gt; samples,&quot; and recommended buying only organically grown varieties. (6)
&gt; Diet for a Poisoned Planet enabled readers to make safer food choices.
&gt; But before they could use the information, they had to know about the
&gt; book so that they could buy and read it. In the weeks after it came
&gt; out, Steinman's publisher scheduled the usual round of media reviews
&gt; and interviews, not suspecting that the California Raisin Advisory
&gt; Board (CALRAB) had already launched a campaign to ensure that
&gt; Steinman's book would be dead on arrival.

&gt; The stakes were high. In 1986, CAL RAB had scored big with a series of
&gt; clever TV commercials using the &quot;California Dancing Raisins&quot; that
&gt; pushed up raisin sales by 17 percent. Steinman's book threatened to
&gt; trip up the careful PR choreography.

&gt; To kill the Steinman book, CALRAB hired Ketchum PR Worldwide, whose
&gt; $50 million a year in net fees made it the country's sixth largest
&gt; public relations company.  Months before the publication of Diet for a
&gt; Poisoned Planet, Ketchum sought to &quot;obtain [a] copy of [the] book
&gt; galleys or manuscript and publisher's tour schedule,&quot; wrote senior
&gt; vice-president Betsy Gullickson in a secret September 7, 1990 memo
&gt; outlining the PR firm's plan to &quot;manage the crisis.&quot; All
&gt; documents...are confidential. Make sure that everything -- even notes
&gt; to yourself -- are so stamped. ...Remember that we have a shredder;
&gt; give documents to Lynette for shredding. All conversations are
&gt; confidential, too. Please be careful talking in the halls, in
&gt; elevators, in restaurants, etc. All suppliers must sign
&gt; confidentiality agreements. If you are faxing documents to the client,
&gt; another office or to anyone else, call them to let them know that a
&gt; fax is coming. If you are expecting a fax, you or your Account
&gt; Coordinator should stand by the machine and wait for it. (7)

&gt; Gullickson's memo outlined a plan to assign &quot;broad areas of
&gt; responsibility,&quot; such as &quot;intelligence/information gathering,&quot; to
&gt; specific Ketchum employees and to Gary Obenauf of CALRAB.  She
&gt; recommended that spokespeople &quot;conduct one-on-one briefings/interviews
&gt; with the trade and general consumer media in the markets most acutely
&gt; interested in the issue .... [Ketchum] is currently attempting to get
&gt; a tour schedule so that we can 'shadow' Steinman's appearances; best
&gt; scenario: we will have our spokesman in town prior to or in
&gt; conjunction with Steinman's appearances.&quot; (8)

&gt; After an informant involved with the book's marketing campaign passed
&gt; Ketchum a list of Steinman's talk show bookings, Ketchum employees
&gt; called each show.  The PR firm then made a list of key media to
&gt; receive low-key phone inquiries. They tried to depict Steinman as an
&gt; off-the-wall extremist without credibility, or argued that it was only
&gt; fair that the other side be presented. A number of programs canceled
&gt; or failed to air interviews.  In the end, an important contribution to
&gt; the public debate over health, the environment, and food safety fell
&gt; victim to a PR campaign designed to prevent it from ever reaching the
&gt; marketplace of ideas. (9)

&gt; Divide and Conquer

&gt; Ronald Duchin, senior vice president of another PR spy firm --
&gt; Mongoven, Biscoe,and Duchin -- would probably have labeled Steinman
&gt; and Tylczak radicals. A graduate of the US Army War College, Duchin
&gt; worked as a special assistant to the secretary of defense and director
&gt; of public affairs for the Veterans of Foreign Wars before becoming a
&gt; flack. Activists, he explained, fall into four categories: radicals,
&gt; opportunists, idealists, and realists.  He follows a three-step
&gt; strategy to neutralize them: 1) isolate the radicals; 2) &quot;cultivate&quot;
&gt; the idealists and &quot;educate&quot; them into becoming realists; then 3)
&gt; co-opt the realists into agreeing with industry.
&gt; According to Duchin, radical activists:
&gt; want to change the system; have underlying socio/political motives
&gt; [and] see multinational corporationsas inherently evil....These
&gt; organizations do not trust the...federal, state and local governments
&gt; to protect them and to safeguard the environment. They believe,
&gt; rather,that individuals and local groups should have direct power over

I will repost a few articles for you, enough to get you started.

http://www.iowacourts.state.ia.us/ESAWebApp/DefaultFrame
Greg  S  Hanson
DOB 05/22/1959
Linn  County
IN THE IOWA DISTRICT COURT OF LINN COUNTY
JUVENILE DIVISION
IN THE INTEREST OF                      NO. JVJV-12345
CHILD A. LASTNAME
DOB: 00-00-99                           MOTION TO CLARIFY
MINOR CHILD                             MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM
INAPPROPRIATE SERVICES
COMES NOW,  Suzy Q. Mother, Pro Se, seeking relief from inappropriate
and inquisitive services.
The Iowa Department of Human Services (DHS) has IMPOSED a Service
Plan
onto us rather than allowing us ACTIVE participation in the FORMATION
of the Service Plan.  We have complained about this for MOST of the
last 11 months, and have been laughed off by Judas of DHS, Deb of LSS
and ignored by Juvenile Court.   Greg showed the quote from the US
DHHS Caseworker handbook to Deb, outside of our house, using the
trunk
of the car as a work surface.   We have seen no sign that she passed
this information to Judas.   Deb characterized this in writing as if
it was aberrant behavior and avoidance of personal issues.  Judas has
been informed of this by way of SEVERAL documents, yet shown no sign
of truly understanding their significance.  The Iowa DHS computer
blank FORM was apparently recently modified to make a clear statement
about this point, with boxed in text for emphasis, so it must be
important to SOMEBODY at DHS, perhaps due to a consent decree.
On January 99th, in court, I (Suzy Q. Mother) was asked by the judge
what MORE services would help, but got the &quot;stone wall&quot; treatment
regarding removal of inappropriate services.  It clearly seemed to be
a &quot;closed issue&quot; with the Judge.  Something is wrong with that.  This
flies in the face of the concept of &quot;Active Participation in the
Formation of Service Plan&quot;.  Federal Case law says &quot;opportunity
to object after formation is NOT a substitute for ACTIVE
participation
in the FORMATION of the Service Plan&quot;.  This is a Federal
regulation and it's in the Iowa caseworker manual too.
Services DHS is attempting to IMPOSE upon our family turned out upon
further investigation to be contaminated beyond belief with putrid
INPUT.  The words &quot;fishing expedition&quot; come to mind.
Domestic Violence Victim Counseling
Never mind that there has been no Domestic Violence in the 3 years
that Greg has been with us.  Domestic Violence counselor pushed for
disclosure of some dark truth that simply doesn't exist.  After
Judas's telephonic INPUT, the counselor, Linda Vance, badgered me
saying &quot;You know that Greg pushed Child's head under
water.&quot; (Actually
it was head under SHOWER SPRAY!  twisted by DHS.)  It was clear after
only a few minutes on the phone that she intended to assume the role
of Torquemada (Spanish Inquisition) to elicit information about
nonexistant domestic abuse.
Psychological Evaluation
Greg went to see Doctor DHSISGOODFORME for one hour, for a
Psychological Evaluation, knowing what had been INPUT was a laundry
list of 4 points.  The list was:
needs to be the victim
domestic violence
controlling
anger management issues
It seemed odd that 10 hours were set aside with the scheduler for
anger management before there was even a diagnosis.  The list raised
some concerns about violations of 5th amendment rights, but it was
small enough that Greg went.  Then after one hour, Dr.DHSISGOODFORME
didn't think he had enough to &quot;go on&quot; and asked for a release to get
more documentary background from DHS.  This took 2 or three months,
and this INPUT was an inch thick stack of documents, including
misstatements, perjury and parroted comments like &quot;it is reported&quot;
presented as de-facto evidence.   We STILL have not gotten the huge
number of factual, typographical, non-sequitir and other incorrect
statements stricken from the records.  The time will come for this.
The &quot;laundry list&quot; four points were not all present in the STACK of
input, and new, more attitudinal and subjective
concerns were added.  There are definate problems of EPISTEMOLOGY
with
this.
Greg called up Dr.DHSISGOODFORME and asked about the ethics of using
such a large amount of INPUT and the potential for it to TAINT the
impartiality of a Psychological Evaluation.   Dr. DHSISGOODFORME
could
not explain how this INPUT would not creep into the subjective parts
of the Psychological Evaluation.  Greg asked about how the
hypotheticals about behavior in a family setting posed in the INPUT
could be evaluated outside of the family setting.   Not many answers
were forthcoming, and Greg clearly felt like he was being
&quot;railroaded&quot;
by the stacked&quot; Psychological Evaluation.  Several large issues in
The
Bill of Rights jelled at this point. ( 4, 5, 6, 9 and 14)
Sex Abuse Exam Done based only on DHS Perjury
Child had already undergone a sex abuse physical and a video tape
interview at the CPC, despite the fact that NOBODY, not even the
hostile accuser had alleged any sexual abuse.  The only justification
for the sex abuse physical was PERJURY by Judas of DHS about Greg's
past.   This same PERJURY was used at the top of Judas and Maggie's
Affidavit to justify the court removal order after two weeks of
extortive &quot;Family Preservation&quot; used purely as witch hunt.
My first idiot attorney supposedly filed a motion for a HEARING about
the CPC exam, because justification was based on false and even
perjurous information.   The motion was denied by a Juvenile Court
Judge with no explanation.
The CPC physical reported the grandmothers concerns, and reported an
internal bump that had gone away, IF it ever really existed.  The
bump
was reported as being from a swing set accident.  We never owned a
swing set, and this injury was apparently concealed from us IF it
really ever existed.  We have concerns that Child may have been
brainwashed into not reporting an accident that took place on the
grandparents' swing set.  The grandmother was never authorized to
intrude into Child's medical care in any way, yet her words are
written down there in the physical report, and they are non-
sequiturs.
This woman has been on Prozac for 8 (EIGHT) years and does not take
her Prozac reliably, which is particularly risky.  Great and reliable
witness eh?  A mental case?  (Has Wallis vs. Escondido or Spencer
written all over it!)
The video tape interview was done by Jennifer Torquemada (Now
Jennifer
Blah) at the CPC, even though she apparently had NO CERTIFICATION for
her job as an Evidenciary Interviewer.   If she did, she would know
more about how suggestable a 7 year old is, and how unreliable their
testimony is.   This is where &quot;head pushed under water&quot; began rather
than &quot;head pushed under shower spray&quot;.
Jennifer also directed me to cooperate with DHS, and said that I
&quot;would have to make some tough choices&quot; implying that I needed to get
rid of Greg to satisfy DHS.
She reported a lot of information that SHE did not gather.  Hyperbole
like &quot;It is reported that&quot; (blah blah) is used several times in her
report.  This is clearly an artifact of her interaction with the
other
members of the &quot;Child Protection Team&quot;, specifically the DHS Child
Protective caseworkers.  This contaminates the neutrality, and adds a
bogus aire of legitimacy to fictitious and factitious garbage.
Maggie Wickedwitch even fed Jennifer questions to ask from the other
side of the one way glass.
I (Suzy Q. Mother) was denied my right to have legal counsel present
at questioning that took place there.   My first idiot attorney said
he would not be allowed, which I know was not true.  I went there
specifically to hold my 7 year old daughters' hand through the
invasive sex abuse physical.   Instead I was fending off an &quot;ambush
interview&quot; by a hostile group during that time.
Employment
The Service Plan directs Greg to find employment.  There has been no
explanation or justification of this.  We consider this to be up to
us
jointly, as a family, and object to being micromanaged by busybodies
at DHS who have no RIGHT to direct, order or extort such a thing.
Maggie, Judas, et alia seem to have a bias against stay at home men.
Mercy Hospital recently taught a class for stay at home Parents, MALE
or FEMALE. It is gradually becoming main stream.  Greg studied
Computer Science and Electronics Technology and worked quite
ambitiously before becoming a &quot;Soccer Dad&quot;.  Greg brought more EARNED
SAVINGS into our family when he moved in, than Rob paid in child
support in the year 2000.  Greg owes no CHILD SUPPORT.   Clearly DHS
targeted the WRONG MAN.  Shouldn't they have ordered the deadbeat
bio-dad to WORK??  Do

&gt;&gt; &gt;Greggor has a criminal history of beating women. He is a founded child

&gt;yourself or better yet ask greg, I thinks he kind of likes talking
&gt;about it. There was his exwife who he has admitted to being convicted
&gt;of abusing, her children who he was investigated for abusing, his

&gt;Greg  S  Hanson
&gt; DOB 05/22/1959
&gt;Linn  County
&gt;IN THE IOWA DISTRICT COURT OF LINN COUNTY
&gt;                              JUVENILE DIVISION
&gt;IN THE INTEREST OF                      NO. JVJV-12345
&gt;CHILD A. LASTNAME
&gt;DOB: 00-00-99                           MOTION TO CLARIFY
&gt;MINOR CHILD                             MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM
&gt;                                        INAPPROPRIATE SERVICES
&gt;COMES NOW,  Suzy Q. Mother, Pro Se, seeking relief from inappropriate
&gt;and inquisitive services.
&gt;The Iowa Department of Human Services (DHS) has IMPOSED a Service
&gt;Plan
&gt;onto us rather than allowing us ACTIVE participation in the FORMATION
&gt;of the Service Plan.  We have complained about this for MOST of the
&gt;last 11 months, and have been laughed off by Judas of DHS, Deb of LSS
&gt;and ignored by Juvenile Court.   Greg showed the quote from the US
&gt;DHHS Caseworker handbook to Deb, outside of our house, using the
&gt;trunk
&gt;of the car as a work surface.   We have seen no sign that she passed
&gt;this information to Judas.   Deb characterized this in writing as if
&gt;it was aberrant behavior and avoidance of personal issues.  Judas has
&gt;been informed of this by way of SEVERAL documents, yet shown no sign
&gt;of truly understanding their significance.  The Iowa DHS computer
&gt;blank FORM was apparently recently modified to make a clear statement
&gt;about this point, with boxed in text for emphasis, so it must be
&gt;important to SOMEBODY at DHS, perhaps due to a consent decree.
&gt;On January 99th, in court, I (Suzy Q. Mother) was asked by the judge
&gt;what MORE services would help, but got the &quot;stone wall&quot; treatment
&gt;regarding removal of inappropriate services.  It clearly seemed to be
&gt;a &quot;closed issue&quot; with the Judge.  Something is wrong with that.  This
&gt;flies in the face of the concept of &quot;Active Participation in the
&gt;Formation of Service Plan&quot;.  Federal Case law says &quot;opportunity
&gt;to object after formation is NOT a substitute for ACTIVE
&gt;participation
&gt;in the FORMATION of the Service Plan&quot;.  This is a Federal
&gt;regulation and it's in the Iowa caseworker manual too.
&gt;Services DHS is attempting to IMPOSE upon our family turned out upon
&gt;further investigation to be contaminated beyond belief with putrid
&gt;INPUT.  The words &quot;fishing expedition&quot; come to mind.
&gt;Domestic Violence Victim Counseling
&gt;Never mind that there has been no Domestic Violence in the 3 years
&gt;that Greg has been with us.  Domestic Violence counselor pushed for
&gt;disclosure of some dark truth that simply doesn't exist.  After
&gt;Judas's telephonic INPUT, the counselor, Linda Vance, badgered me
&gt;saying &quot;You know that Greg pushed Child's head under
&gt;water.&quot; (Actually
&gt;it was head under SHOWER SPRAY!  twisted by DHS.)  It was clear after
&gt;only a few minutes on the phone that she intended to assume the role
&gt;of Torquemada (Spanish Inquisition) to elicit information about
&gt;nonexistant domestic abuse.
&gt;Psychological Evaluation
&gt;Greg went to see Doctor DHSISGOODFORME for one hour, for a
&gt;Psychological Evaluation, knowing what had been INPUT was a laundry
&gt;list of 4 points.  The list was:
&gt;needs to be the victim
&gt;domestic violence
&gt;controlling
&gt;anger management issues
&gt;It seemed odd that 10 hours were set aside with the scheduler for
&gt;anger management before there was even a diagnosis.  The list raised
&gt;some concerns about violations of 5th amendment rights, but it was
&gt;small enough that Greg went.  Then after one hour, Dr.DHSISGOODFORME
&gt;didn't think he had enough to &quot;go on&quot; and asked for a release to get
&gt;more documentary background from DHS.  This took 2 or three months,
&gt;and this INPUT was an inch thick stack of documents, including
&gt;misstatements, perjury and parroted comments like &quot;it is reported&quot;
&gt;presented as de-facto evidence.   We STILL have not gotten the huge
&gt;number of factual, typographical, non-sequitir and other incorrect
&gt;statements stricken from the records.  The time will come for this.
&gt;The &quot;laundry list&quot; four points were not all present in the STACK of
&gt;input, and new, more attitudinal and subjective
&gt;concerns were added.  There are definate problems of EPISTEMOLOGY
&gt;with
&gt;this.
&gt;Greg called up Dr.DHSISGOODFORME and asked about the ethics of using
&gt;such a large amount of INPUT and the potential for it to TAINT the
&gt;impartiality of a Psychological Evaluation.   Dr. DHSISGOODFORME
&gt;could
&gt;not explain how this INPUT would not creep into the subjective parts
&gt;of the Psychological Evaluation.  Greg asked about how the
&gt;hypotheticals about behavior in a family setting posed in the INPUT
&gt;could be evaluated outside of the family setting.   Not many answers
&gt;were forthcoming, and Greg clearly felt like he was being
&gt;&quot;railroaded&quot;
&gt;by the stacked&quot; Psychological Evaluation.  Several large issues in
&gt;The
&gt;Bill of Rights jelled at this point. ( 4, 5, 6, 9 and 14)
&gt;Sex Abuse Exam Done based only on DHS Perjury
&gt;Child had already undergone a sex abuse physical and a video tape
&gt;interview at the CPC, despite the fact that NOBODY, not even the
&gt;hostile accuser had alleged any sexual abuse.  The only justification
&gt;for the sex abuse physical was PERJURY by Judas of DHS about Greg's
&gt;past.   This same PERJURY was used at the top of Judas and Maggie's
&gt;Affidavit to justify the court removal order after two weeks of
&gt;extortive &quot;Family Preservation&quot; used purely as witch hunt.
&gt;My first idiot attorney supposedly filed a motion for a HEARING about
&gt;the CPC exam, because justification was based on false and even
&gt;perjurous information.   The motion was denied by a Juvenile Court
&gt;Judge with no explanation.
&gt;The CPC physical reported the grandmothers concerns, and reported an
&gt;internal bump that had gone away, IF it ever really existed.  The
&gt;bump
&gt;was reported as being from a swing set accident.  We never owned a
&gt;swing set, and this injury was apparently concealed from us IF it
&gt;really ever existed.  We have concerns that Child may have been
&gt;brainwashed into not reporting an accident that took place on the
&gt;grandparents' swing set.  The grandmother was never authorized to
&gt;intrude into Child's medical care in any way, yet her words are
&gt;written down there in the physical report, and they are non-
&gt;sequiturs.
&gt; This woman has been on Prozac for 8 (EIGHT) years and does not take
&gt;her Prozac reliably, which is particularly risky.  Great and reliable
&gt;witness eh?  A mental case?  (Has Wallis vs. Escondido or Spencer
&gt;written all over it!)
&gt;The video tape interview was done by Jennifer Torquemada (Now
&gt;Jennifer
&gt;Blah) at the CPC, even though she apparently had NO CERTIFICATION for
&gt;her job as an Evidenciary Interviewer.   If she did, she would know
&gt;more about how suggestable a 7 year old is, and how unreliable their
&gt;testimony is.   This is where &quot;head pushed under water&quot; began rather
&gt;than &quot;head pushed under shower spray&quot;.
&gt;Jennifer also directed me to cooperate with DHS, and said that I
&gt;&quot;would have to make some tough choices&quot; implying that I needed to get
&gt;rid of Greg to satisfy DHS.
&gt;She reported a lot of information that SHE did not gather.  Hyperbole
&gt;like &quot;It is reported that&quot; (blah blah) is used several times in her
&gt;report.  This is clearly an artifact of her interaction with the
&gt;other
&gt;members of the &quot;Child Protection Team&quot;, specifically the DHS Child
&gt;Protective caseworkers.  This contaminates the neutrality, and adds a
&gt;bogus aire of legitimacy to fictitious and factitious garbage.
&gt;Maggie Wickedwitch even fed Jennifer questions to ask from the other

&gt; Note to Greg:

&gt;         Yes, Greg, I do have access.  And it's all public information,
&gt; lest you be worried I violated any laws, rules or regulations to
&gt; access it.
&gt;         You aren't worth breaking the law.  However, you can take
&gt; pride in knowing you have become important enough for me to verify the
&gt; claims.

&gt; &gt;Did time for abusing his mentally ill wife.

&gt;         Arrested, tried and convicted.  He even did some time for it.

&gt; &gt;And cost his girlfriend the custody of her seven year old daughter in
&gt; &gt;February of 2001... and the mother hasn't had custody since.

&gt; &gt;Next February will be SEVEN YEARS the mother was without her little
&gt; &gt;girl.

&gt;         All because of HIS founded abuse, though the mom isn't 100%
&gt; blameless.  She should have known what was going on and done something
&gt; to stop it.
">

The child was removed after a report was made to the authorities that
greg locked the little girl out of her own home in February of 2001
with no shoes, socks or coat.

The small home was filled with. as greg describes it, &quot;boxes of
household items, electronic parts, tools, raw speakers, nuts, bolts,
televisions, wires and cables, spare phones, computer parts, books and
magazines, etc. not terribly disorganized, just too much VOLUME of
stuff in the single wide mobile home we got out of. Put simply, if we
had a GARAGE, most would have been there.&quot;

These were greg's belongings. He moved in with the little girl's
mother two years earlier. And quit his job to be a 24/7 babysitter
while the mother went to work.

What he admitted to after the removal was spanking the little girl and
going into the bathroom after she finished showering to &quot;hand her a
towel.&quot; He also admitted to forcing the little girl to take cold
showers as punishment for wetting her pants.

ALL done WITH the permission of the MOTHER, greg claims.

greg also posted a very special Motion that was written by him and his
girlfriend that was submitted to the Family Court WITHOUT the
knowledge of their attorney.

Would you like me to repost it?

It's VERY enlightening.

I don't believe it's copyrighted so don't worry about that.

If it IS copyrighted I'll post it as educational material.

Them HIVES eating you up today ?

It would appear from the 'bad mouthing', insane innuendos and arrogant
outright false public statements that you spew about me, that perhaps
you think your behavior makes you superior in some way.

I'm not the first, or the only person you have perpetuated this type
of behavior against.  There were dozens and dozens before me whom you
plopped on your personal hate list which you refer to as your &quot;Mine
Enemies&quot;.

Some of your 'Mine Enemies' received their very own shit-list webpages
(here's a current list of all the people you hate):
http://www.ilena-rosenthal.com/ilenawebpages.html

Many, many others got shit-list anchor links to one page or another of
your blithering.
So if having a long laundry list of self-appointed enemies makes you
feel superior, have at it.  It's all yours.

I have a 5-star Google rating, but I guess your 1-star rating makes
you proud of your  superiority.  It's all yours.

I don't know if it takes superiority to be kicked off, banned and
dumped by people and places, but you have a history of it.  It's all
yours.:
http://www.ilena-rosenthal.com/1suspensions.html

Obviously boasting about international travel and living in 'paradise'
foreign countries displays your superiority.  It's all yours.  And so
is the $53,000 of unpaid Judgments.

I don't have the IRS slapping me with &quot;got you&quot; Tax Liens either.
It's all yours.

Yes Ilena Rosenthal....you are obviously one far superior human being
on the face of this planet.  How silly of common folk to doubt
it......

&gt; So if having a long laundry list of self-appointed enemies makes you

&gt; I have a 5-star Google rating, but I guess your 1-star rating makes

&gt; Obviously boasting about international travel and living in 'paradise'

&gt; I don't have the IRS slapping me with &quot;got you&quot; Tax Liens either.

And then I challenged CPS to produce the credible evidence that I
abused of neglected anyone.

And they had no evidence of anything.

So ALL five findings were reversed.

In fact THEIR court appointed expert wrote in her report to the Judge

MY CPS record is free of any findings that I did anything
inappropriate.

Inferior!  Oh my!  I should think that someone like you, with such a hearty
personality, would NEVER feel inferior to anyone else!
How about I bring some dye, and we do your hair?  (so far I've talked two of
my friends into doing so and they never went back to their original
colors...they say being a redhead is SOOOOO much more fun, and that someone
really messed up with that Blondes have more fun thing)
