Ellen Datlow gave me permission to post this from the HWA message
board. She also asked me to make sure understood that this only covers
stories published in 2007. Anything published in 2006 is no longer
eligible.

January 2007

I co-edit the World Fantasy Award winning anthology series The Year's
Best Fantasy and Horror (St. Martin's Press) with Kelly Link &amp; Gavin
Grant. We are now reading for the 21st volume, which will include all
material published in 2007.

I am looking for stories from all branches of horror: from the
traditional-supernatural to the borderline, including high-tech sf
horror, supernatural stories, psychological horror, dark thrillers, or
anything else that might qualify. If in doubt, send it. This is a
reprint anthology so I am only reading material published in or about
to be published in 2007. Submission deadline for stories is December
15th 2007. Anything sent after this deadline will reach me too late.
If a magazine, anthology, or collection you're in or you edit is
coming out by December 31st, you can send me galleys or manuscripts so
that I can judge the stories in time. No email submissions. I strongly
suggest that authors check with their publishers that they are sending
review copies out to me as I don't have time or energy to nag
publishers to get me material. I  request it once (maybe twice) and
that's it.

There are summations of "the year in horror," and "the year in
fantasy" in the front of each volume. These include novels,
nonfiction, art books, and in my section, "odds and ends"-- material
that doesn't fit anywhere else but that I feel might interest the
horror reader. But I have to be aware of this material in order to
mention it. The deadline for this section is January 30th, 2008.

PMB 391
511 Avenue of the Americas
New York, NY 10011-8436

Kelly Link &amp; Gavin Grant
176 Prospect Avenue
Northampton, MA 01060

Kelly &amp; Gavin cover fantasy and I cover horror. If you consider
something both, send a copy to each of us. We do not confer on our
choices.

****I do not want to receive manuscripts from authors of stories from
venues that it's likely I already receive regularly (like Interzone,
The Third Alternative, Cemetery Dance, Subterranean, Postscripts,
Weird Tales, F&amp;SF, etc) or from anthologies and collections, unless I
don't have or can't get that anthology or collection. What I would
prefer is if you contact your publisher and ask him/her to send me the
magazine or book.

And please do not send a SASE. If  I choose a story you will be
informed. If you want to confirm that I've received something, enclose
a self-addressed-stamped postcard and I will let you know the date it
arrived. For stories that appear on the web, please send me (or have
the publisher send me) print-outs of your story.

Changing the subject for a moment......Kevin, didn't you tell everyone
you were about to die from cancer, two years ago? If that was true,
then you seem to be experiencing a truly miraculous recovery.

If I'd received and seen the subsequently award-winning story in 2005
I would have chosen it for that year's YBFH. Since the book only made
it into my hands (and most anyone else's hands) after December 31st,
2005, I had no problem considering it for the next year--in 2006-- as
I've occasionally done with other stories over the twenty years I've
been co-editing the series.

So your alleged lesbian relationship with her had nothing to do with it? I
certainly am not making any accusations, as I have no personal knowledge of
what has been rumored. In fact, some stories just pop up on the internet
without any basis in fact at all.

On the other hand, I like lesbian literature, and I completely support you
if you felt that your own intimacy with an author did not preclude you from
making an editorial decision. Bravo! Your confidence in your own integrity
is an inspiration to others.

It's still bending the rules though, isn't it?

I doubt if it would be an issue if you didn't know the Rodens so
well.

Sorry Ellen, but I think this sort of thing undermines your integrity,
as it would undermine anyone else's. Rules are rules, and if you state
that a story should be published in one year to qualify for inclusion
the next you should stick to it and not fudge the boundaries when your
friends are involved.

This reminds me of Ramsey Campbell's defence that it wasn't unethical
of him to devote his entire All Hallows column last Spring to
massively plugging Joe Hill's debut collection. RC argued that he was
innocent of nepotism because he had championned other writers before.
Sorry, but that kind of nonsense only fools the gullible. We realists
know that favouritism and string-pulling is as rife in the world of
fantasy genre fiction as anywhere else, so it is really quite
insulting when you seek to claim the moral high ground by pretending
that bias wasn't shown.

You know I have no axe to grind here because you did indeed feature
one of RO's stories in your last book (though I was very slightly
miffed at not receiving a reciprocal gratis copy but that's by-the-by;
other publishers always seem to act with less courtesy than you). No,
I just believe that BR's story was far too poor to have been included
in the first place. In fact the only praise that has been bestowed
upon the tale came from ingrates and business associates; elsewhere it
was distinctly mild.

It's Ramsey's column he can write about whatever he bloody well

the column to discussing what a useless wanker you are, I could do

You believe many things, Hoppy... Most of them simply aren't true. The
most accurate you have been was when you stated "I am not a writer,
editor, or publisher."

Now why don't you do something useful like turning your "satire beam"

shitting on the statuary.

As John says, "the rules are my rules." Several years ago I took a
story by someone I'd never spoken to or heard of before--the next year
after the story was originally published.  Because I missed it the
year it was published--and I didn't feel that my readers would have a
problem with that. None did. As none had a problem with me choosing
Barbara Roden's story when I did.

Chris,
If you like I can email you a list of every magazine, collection,
anthology, novel, and every other book I receive to review for YBFH.
If I reciprocated in kind by giving away copies of YBFH to every
publisher/editor who sent me their books, the print run would be gone
before the book went into the stores. It just doesn't work that way.
And if you'll recall, I bought Reggie's first book because I didn't
receive a review copy.

&gt; &gt; You believe many things, Hoppy... Most of them simply aren't true. The
&gt; &gt; most accurate you have been was when you stated &quot;I am not a writer,
&gt; &gt; editor, or publisher.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Now why don't you do something useful like turning your &quot;satire beam&quot;

Sorry, but I object to being involved in a discussion with the odious
and foul-mouthed Pelan. I'll answer once more and then leave the two
of you to play good cop bad cop. However, I should point out that your
association with a serial liar doesn't exactly enhance your
reputation. You are aware that Seattle PD were considering impounding
his computer because of his unpleasant stalking behaviour, aren't you?
And that the legal advisor at his former ISP terminated his old
account and threatened him with litigation should he ever repeat the
false claims me made about owning shares in their company?

As for the Rodens and *that* short story....well, I was reliably
informed by one of their former regulars that his / her services as a
reviewer were ruthlessly dispensed with after he / she had the cheek
to give Barbara Roden's story a lukewarm review. Mr Roden actually had
the arrogance to write to the reviewer demanding they account for the
unfavourable notice.

I haven't read many of your anthologies or essays. I'm judging you
mostly by what I see, my own experiences, and the company you keep.
And do you know, for all the concerns I've raised about nepotism on
the genre - whether it be linked to awards bodies, 'best of year'
anthologies, lifetime presidencies or official societies - not once
has anyone within i.e. profiting from the genre ever conceded the
merest slither of ground.

You expect the gullible punter - sorry, I mean discerning reader - to
believe that you are all extremely principled professionals who would
never, ever stoop to favouring a crony or friend. Which is odd, you
see, because it's pretty much accepted by the rest of the world that
nepotism exists in almost every aspect of commerce.

How lucky we are that our unregulated, self-Policed genre is so
squeaky clean that all charges of favouritism can be so confidently
kicked into touch.

CB
PS. For what it's worth, I believe that the majority of your
selections are based upon the quality of the individual tales, but
that a minority aren't. I also believe that you conduct youself with
greater professionalism than the Pelans and Rodens or this world.

I'd normally refrain from commenting on Barker's garbage, but here his
version and actual reality are so far removed that it's unbelievable.

I know the reviewer he's referring to, and I have absolutely no
hesitation in noting that this particular reviewer had been dropped
from our reviewing panel at least two years before the events to which
Barker erroneously - once again erroneously - refers. From memory,
this reviewer's review of ACQUAINTED WITH THE NIGHT made no mention at
all of Barbara's story, and at no point was the reviewer contacted by
either of us about this review, because there was no reason to do so.
However, we had decided some years before NIGHT was even published
that we no longer wished to use this reviewer in ALL HALLOWS, and the
reasons why were communicated to him at that time in an honest but
polite manner.

If he wants me to name names, I'll name names, and if he wants me to
say whythis particular reviewer was considered unsuitable, I'll do
that too. If the reviewer in question has given an alternative account
either of why he is no longer commissioned to write reviews for ALL
HALLOWS, or any incident surrounding the particular review being
referred to here, then he is lying; possibly out of spite, as a way of
'getting back' at us, and knowing that with CB he has a receptive
vehicle, CB always being on the lookout for scurrilous tidbits with

Well, there are few people better acquainted with lying than Mr Roden.
After all, he lied to James Doig about a comment a third party had
told him very recently. Then there's the small matter of a former
solicitor / bookdealing friend of mine offering to provide me with a
statement which said that in his view Roden had 'seriously' libelled
me on another matter. Oh, and let's not forget that Roden would have
the world believe that he did not originally use All Hallows to puff
his own Ashtree publications (whoch he blatantly did), and nor did he
and his wife approve of Ramsey Campbell puffing the work of new crony
on the block Joe Hill this time last year.

I believe that Christopher and Barbara Roden are unpleasant and
manipulative individuals who have acted unprofessionally in their
roles as owners of the Ghost Story Society &amp; Ashtree Press, editors of
All Hallows and other anthologies, and as awards judges. In addition
to events which have happened, there is ample supporting proof of this
on usenet and in other discussion groups. As they are wholly reliant
upon income from their genre work, this should come as little
surprise. Furthermore, their respective attempts at fiction writing
are pitiful, and it is a testament to just how corrupt this genre that
is that other parties - all cronies and sycophants - have queued up to
flatter them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ellen

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's still bending the rules though, isn't it?

&gt; &gt; &gt; You stupid toad, it's Ellen's anthology. She makes the rules. It has
&gt; &gt; &gt; been explained to you before that the book did not receive general
&gt; &gt; &gt; distribution in 2005. Please try to pay attention.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I doubt if it would be an issue if you didn't know the Rodens so well.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's not an issue to anyone except you, and that's only because you
&gt; &gt; &gt; are a jealous failure.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry Ellen, but I think this sort of thing undermines your integrity, as it would undermine anyone else's. Rules are rules, and if you state  that a story should be published in one year to qualify for inclusion the next you should stick to it and not fudge the boundaries when your friends are involved.

&gt; &gt; &gt; When doing a &quot;year's best&quot; or even a &quot;century's best&quot;; one looks for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the fair way to handle things.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This reminds me of Ramsey Campbell's defence that it wasn't unethical  of him to devote his entire All Hallows column last Spring to massively plugging Joe Hill's debut collection. RC argued that he was innocent of nepotism because he had championned other writers before.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, but that kind of nonsense only fools the gullible.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's Ramsey's column he can write about whatever he bloody well
&gt; &gt; &gt; pleases. If I chose to devote my entire column in Cemetery Dance to
&gt; &gt; &gt; one book I could certainly do so. If I chose to devote a portion of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the column to discussing what a useless wanker you are, I could do
&gt; &gt; &gt; that... However, I wouldn't give you any publicity; even if it's of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the negative variety.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We envious failures and sad little wankers know that favouritism and string-pulling is as rife in the world of  fantasy genre fiction as anywhere else,

&gt; &gt; &gt; There, fixed it for you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;so it is really quite insulting when you seek to claim the moral high ground by pretending that bias wasn't shown.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think the term you want insread of &quot;bias&quot; is either &quot;sound
&gt; &gt; &gt; judgement&quot; or &quot;fair play&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You know I have no axe to grind here

&gt; &gt; &gt; HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Damn it, you broke my irony meter.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;No, I just believe that BR's story was far too poor to have been included in the first place. In fact the only praise that has been bestowed upon the tale came from ingrates and business associates; elsewhere it  was distinctly mild.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CB

&gt; &gt; &gt; Which would explain the award nominations. the universal praise for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the story, and the invitations to Ms. Roden from various anthologists
&gt; &gt; &gt; to write new stories for forthcoming books?

&gt; &gt; &gt; You believe many things, Hoppy... Most of them simply aren't true. The

While that certainly is one way to look at it, there is another:

Imagine you are in the park trying to enjoy a game of chess and a
friendly debate with a friend, when a shabby lunatic stands up on a
park bench and engages in a mad monologue about how foul and nasty the
people who share "his" park really are. He shouts it at the top of his
lungs and it's obvious that everyone else around you is disturbed by
his speech. Were he doing this on the lawn in front of your house, you
could have him arrested for trespassing, even stalking, and get a
restraining order against him, but since he is doing it in a public
setting, the police cannot stop him, and the best they might be able
to do is arrest him on disturbing the peace, which being a very minor
crime would mean he would be right back the next day. Considering
this, would you go up to him and argue with him? Would you try to
chase him off? Would you mock him and call him a lunatic? Would you do
ANYTHING to call attention to yourself? Or would you instead ignore
him, may be temporarily retreat to another part of the park to get
some peace until he stops ranting and goes away?

In my opinion, dealing with the Barking Toad is more like dealing with
a crazy, homeless person in the park than an irritating toad on your
porch. Only here on usenet it's easier to ignore him: if you don't
read his posts he won't disturb you. Otherwise, by responding to him
you call attention to yourself and encourage him to direct his rage
and hate at you. As you say, no one believes him, so what do you care
what he says about you?

The irony is that Chris Roden was himself personally responsible for
spotting O'Brien's fake email address. Furthermore, John Pelan knows
very well that O'Brien is a liar because they both lied about
receiving communications from an independent legal counsel who has
denied sending them.

There we have it: O'Brien affects allegiance with Roden and Pelan in
his 'quest' to demonise yours truly even though they both know he is a
craven liar who is even prepared to lie about being at death's door to
try and win internet sympathy.

O'Brien, you have nothing in this world. You have no writing talent,
no real friends, no partner, no children, and most pitiable of all, no
integrity. The only thing you do have is cancer, and even that's
fake.

I would urge you to pursue one of two honourable paths. Either change

He would probably say that it was never proven that the Patricia
O'Brien who had that email address four years before Susan Anton (and
she's a psychiatrist, not an oncologist) was my mother. Unless you
want to try to argue that my mother is the only person in the whole
world named Patricia O'Brien. Unfortunately, that would not be
correct. There are a dozen women in the Metro Denver area alone named
Patricia O'Brien, and at least several hundred in the country at

My statement had nothing to do with what you might or might not say. I
used his taunt as an opportunity to point out, again, that in the
absence of definitive proof, it is irrational to argue that
correlation equals causation.

Though in fact, logically speaking, whether anyone believes that woman
was my mother is a completely separate issue from whether it was
proven she was my mother. Barky likes to pretend that it is a matter
of proven fact, but it is not. As a reasonable person, I would think
that you would agree with that, regardless of whatever else you may or

legal documents which never existed, you lied about seeing the word

Any fool with half a brain would have realised that I mixed the two of
you up.

Having said that, any fool with half a brain wouldn't make the bizarre
claim that I owned up to authoring the Encylopedia Dramatica entry for
usenet's version of Walter Mitty. Clearly it was written by someone in
the US familiar with American language and internet abbreviations.
Yes, I may have contributed one segment, but the authorship of the
whole and indeed the original is attributable to others.

O'Brien has become notorious as the classic example of a humiliated
internet poster resorting to increasingly desperate ruses to try and
retain dignity. He's been caught out lying more times than the boy who
cried wolf. After all, how many people lie about being at death's door
with cancer, and then invent sock puppets who pose as oncologists
using their mum's own email address?

The reason why O'Brien has fallen quiet in the last year or so is that
he's keeping a low profile, hoping the humilitions he exposed himself
to will blow over. He made an utter fool of himself in ahc before
popping up here in abgf to scrape friendship with the apelike Pelan,
whereupon he was quickly branded a liar by at least half a dozen
people ref the Isomedia issue and then the fake cancer claim.

The problem with the internet - and this is a serious issue here - is
that people like you, Pelan and O'Brien make it a deeply unattractive
place for the vast majority of people because of your unpleasant
behaviour. The bottom line is is that if you find it that difficult to
tell the truth or respect the alternative views of others you should
employ civilised counter-argument or else go do something else.

I'm not going to become enmeshed in your childish games anymore which
is why this will probably be my last comment in this ridiculously
childish thread. Suffice to say that O'Brien and Pelan *are* liars who
will always nurture a grudge against me for having exposed them as
such.

Take a look at O'Brien's posts. Almost all are ego-boosting boasts.

Yes, he didn't say "Ellen Datlow is my friend", but he used your call
for submissions as a platform for implying it.

I could run around the internet asking people for permission to tell
other people about their work but at least I would have the sense to
know it for what it is: 'sucking up' or 'kissing ass'.

Of course, if you've offically hired O'Brien as a PR representative
then I take it all back. But somehow I don't think so.

Once you have each relieved yourselves inside of the anus of one another,

This reminds me of the awful philosophy which is often trotted out by
lazy armchair philosophers; to wit, all that one needs do to solve
*any* dispute or knotty psychological problem is to "get laid".
Tritely it was the conclusion to the film that Kubrick wasn't able to
complete himself, EYES WIDE SHUT (I say 'tritely', I could easily say
'ironically' given Tom Cruise's reputation as a closet homosexual).

Alas not all of us are burping, farting, grunting beasts. Some of us
actually do hold strong opinions which are based upon such trifles as
principles, issues or beliefs.

Of course, I speak for myself here. However, it would be remiss of me
to deny that I do believe that John Pelan probably does spend a rather
large chunk of his time burping, farting and grunting. Anyone who has
seen his picture or read his unpleasant posts would surely acknowledge
that.

But to return to the image you conjure up....well, I could easily
imagine Pelan - a self-confessed fan of sweaty male wrestling and
gratuitous horror porn - secretly fantasising about such a scenario;
O'Brien is probably sexless, prefering instead to conduct a love
affair with the most important person in his life (himself); as for
me, whilst I like camp humour and admire gay people for their general
open-mindedness, I am alas crippled by the horribly unfashionable
condition of heterosexuality, which renders me physically attracted to
the opposite sex only. It is true I conjectured about the 'other way'
during my teens, but that turned out in retrospect not be to the
crisis I thought it was, merely a conscious attempt to prove to myself
that I was not a discriminator. The shortest chapter in THE DICE MAN
was enough to deter me from pursuing a line of enquiry in which I had
no real interest.

So please, less of the unpleasant projective imagery. It's a damp
squib in my case.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messages in usenet. What do you have to say about that?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you really want to go down this path? First, I've said all I have

&gt; &gt; &gt; You're the one getting hot under the collar, Cook. I simply lob in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; occasional grenade whenever people like O'Brien or Pelan become
&gt; &gt; &gt; tiresome. It might suit your twisted agenda to think of this as some
&gt; &gt; &gt; some sort of weird ongoing Smersh-style campaign to overthrow the
&gt; &gt; &gt; supernatural genre but I'm afraid that's just not the case.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you think that O'Brien's inane series of &quot;Course Work Updates&quot; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;My Good Friend Ellen Has Given Me Permission To Mention Her Name&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; posts are not tiresome then fair enough, but I believe they are, and I
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't exactly see a long line of people queuing up to socialise with
&gt; &gt; &gt; him.

&gt; &gt; &gt; When I see a howling cad I reserve the right to say so, especially
&gt; &gt; &gt; when he has trespassed into a genre he knows little about.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; Take a look at O'Brien's posts. Almost all are ego-boosting boasts.

&gt; Yes, he didn't say &quot;Ellen Datlow is my friend&quot;, but he used your call
&gt; for submissions as a platform for implying it.

&gt; I could run around the internet asking people for permission to tell
&gt; other people about their work but at least I would have the sense to
&gt; know it for what it is: 'sucking up' or 'kissing ass'.

&gt; Of course, if you've offically hired O'Brien as a PR representative
&gt; then I take it all back. But somehow I don't think so.

Perhaps the only way for you to be accepted and initiated into the inner
circle of the Ghost Writers Society is to pucker up your rosy red and let
the boys all take their turn. You don't have to like it or want it, just
show them that you are a good sport.

Once they have all relieved themselves in your respective orifices, they
will take a step back and reflect on things. You will be re-evaluated. Like
any Catholic martyr who is suddenly set on the short list for Beatification,
the accolades will begin issuing from sundry places from whence you never
realized were full of admiration for you. You will suddenly find yourself as
a finalist for various dubious awards.

If you can connect with a wealthy "mentor," then the world will be your
oyster. You name the famous writer, and most of them were supported at one
time or another by a hard-working spouse or gay benefactor. It is not a
question of buggery, but a show of humility on your part. Be a sport,
swallow a load.

Do you mind posting some nude photos of yourself, as I am having some
difficulty envisioning your lesbian antics of last year. A little
photographic inspiration would do wonders.

I would like to thank Zarok for bringing this up, as I guess he has his
finger on the pulse of the Ghost Writers Society. Us mere readers would
never know or understand the behind the scenes activities if not for certain
writers who pull back the curtain and give us a peek!

Barky is simply engaging in melodrama, and rather bad melodrama at

furtherance of some nefarious plot.

Does that make you Nell Fenwick?

My, my. You just can't seem to bring yourself to tell the truth
lately, can you, Chris? On Monday you're loudly proclaiming that you
know nothing at all about the arcane and impenetrable procedures
necessary to edit such an article. ("Sure I did Kevin. I spent several
weeks learning all of that acronym jingle just so I could post that
one entry. My whole life revolves around you.") On Tuesday you're
suddenly backpedaling, admitting you *may* have co-authored it. Allow
me to be blunt. There is no *may* about this, so quit trying to weasel
out of your culpability here. Even a cursory perusal of the history
page for this article shows that you are clearly Mr Wraxall, one of
its three major authors. No one else in the entire universe gives a
rat's ass about "The John Pelan Share Scandal" (*eye roll*); no one
else would drone on about the pernicious Ghost Story Society and the
Horror Writer's Association (and John's affiliation with the latter
organization); and no else is quite so much in love with the word
"crony" as are you. My Lord, in one of your early edits you made the
same silly error that you committed in one of your old Usenet posts:
mistakenly referring to John's Web site as www.midnighthouse.com . Let
us face facts. Your claim to "have no idea who wrote this" article is
not merely disingenuous; it's a big fat -- what's that word you like
to toss around so frequently? ahh, yes -- **lie**.

Let us dissect this situation a bit further, shall we? You set up an
account with this rather silly Web site (Encyclopedia Dramatica) in
order to anonymously attack two people you personally dislike. Not
content with that, you then post the article link in this forum and,
while claiming to know nothing of its author, oh-so reluctantly
comment on how "accurate" it is (i.e., agrees with your own personal
assessment -- what a shocking surprise). There's a label for this kind
of behavior, Chris. It's another term you're overly fond of hurling
about -- sock puppetry. Well, congratulations, Chris!! Your relentless
search for the elusive sock puppet has at last reached a successful
conclusion. ("We have met the enemy and he is us.")

As I have noted on previous occasions, Chris, if you weren't such a
nasty twerp, I would be tempted to consider you somewhat -- dear me,
now what's that new word you're infatuated with today? oh, yes --
pathetic.

Yrs,

Michael
