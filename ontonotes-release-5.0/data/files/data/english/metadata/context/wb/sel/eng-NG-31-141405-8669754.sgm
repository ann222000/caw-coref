Has anyone made the switch to LED bulbs at home or office?

Fixing to start a remodeling project and wonder if it's time
to make the jump. I get really annoyed with the buzzing out
of fluorescent fixtures. Is there any buzz with LED - new or old?

Is there anyone to justify a $100 lightbulb?
Will the green factor leave me warm and fuzzy enough to forget
about the big empty space in my wallet?

Tried to, bu at least up to last June, cost-per-lumen was simply too much.
Both off-the-shelf lamps (white) and a customer's-seller kit (for which
I created the PWM driver). In the latter case, also RGB.

No, the PWM I used is at around 200Hz and anyway it should not buzz due
to low powers :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Exactly. IMO, no: I'm going for solar photovoltaic panels, though: it's
quite incentivated now in Italy.

I've some Chinese-built and marketed lamps for somewhat cheaper, but in
that case it's
the provided light which is too little, even if the cost is so cheaper
that they almost reach the 1:1 cost ratio.
I mean, in this latter case, price may be affordable but you simply need
to place *many* of those lamps (cheaper and older leds are used).

LED costs are still falling nicely. BUT the efficiency of LED lamps is
still only comparable to the best of other technologies whose initial
capital costs is cheaper. Halogen can be very competitive. The bulb
life is &lt;&lt; LED but bulb cost is &lt; LED.

CFL bulbs, which are fluorescents in a different form factor,
generate their own high frequency so are  buzz free. You can now buy
100+ Watt CFL bulbs - about 500 Watt incandescent equivalent.
Marvellously bright. I have a number :-).

Fluorescent tube format can use HF electronic ballasts for silent
operation. Given the distortions of the invisible hand it may be
cheaper to buy CFL bulbs of suitable size and use their electronics to
power tube fluorescents, depending on how many you have to do and how
you value your labour.

LEDs are essentially DC and can be PWMd at above audible frequencies
with ease.

Dimming:    LEDs are easily dimmable (but it should be done with PWM
applied to the LED and not smoothed DC) whereas CFL are usually not
(as their internal controllers are simple and not intended to be
accessible) and fluorescent controllers need to be dimmer rated.

I don't know if it is actually done, but it could also do proper power
factor correction, to almost eliminate losses elsewhere in the system due to
poor power factor.

The 100+ Watt CFLs are getting distinctly non-tiny.
Grabs tape measure.
The 105 Watt CFL in my dining room has 4 U loops with a 440mm path
length each. As all 4 loops are in series that's a tube length of
about 1800 mm or just under 7 feet (!!!!). That's a lonnnng
fluorescent.

Tube diameter is about 15mm

These monsters are quite a shock at first encounter. Far larger than
the average CFL. Go in either a bayonet or Edison screw socket as per
usual but put quite a strain on fittings that support the bulb by the
socket.

My son says they are evil because they make your brain think it's
still daylight and you tend to keep working :-). I'm making a light
fixture for photography with 4 of these in it (&quot;bright white&quot;
version). Equivalent to about 2000 Watts of incandescent lighting.
Lovely. Colour temperature is a bit &quot;non standard&quot; but good enough for
many purposes.

Also depends on colour balance setting of the camera. Fluorescents
generally have a discontinuous spectrum and can't be colour perfectly,
but it's quite acceptable to most people.

&quot;Render correctly&quot; is often enough very much in the brain of the

That is what I was wanting to look for - to see if any gaps became apparent.
I guess it wouldn't as otherwise it would become obvious to normal eyesight,
and fluorescents do get used for movie filming (saw an advert done this way,

The old Flurrescents did &quot;buzz&quot;, the newer ones don't. Another good
option are CFLs, they don't buzz either and are far cheaper then LED.

I have had spotty results with CFL bulbs. I have several fans with
fixtures for 3 40w standard bulbs
which hang down at 30degree angles from the horizontal. I have tried CFL
bulbs there several times;
most are not working after 30 days. I don't know why. But elsewhere in
the house, they are fine, and
work perfectly. Maybe its the angle...?

They also work perfectly in solar-power inverter systems, too.

Go figure.

I find the &quot;better&quot; bulbs either aren't as restrictive with orientation,

and that was outdoors, in an enclosed fixture, made by a manufacturer I
wouldn't have rated highly before the bulb went.

Another big annoyance to me is turn on time. Unfortunately this doesn't
appear to ever be mentioned. As a result I shy away from the cheapest
bulbs. I find Phillips Marathon bulbs to be superb. They last a long
time, are quick to reach max brightness, turn on pretty much as fast as
a regular bulb, and have a good colour temp (to my eyes). That said, my
utility gave me two free CFLs. They are no name, and certainly the
cheapest they could find, but they also turn on instantly.

Anyone who's worn tinted sunglasses will understand that. Years ago when
I was into downhill skiing I used to wear ski-goggles that were heavilly
tinted yellow, probably to make trees stand out or something. In any
case after a few minutes wearing them everything seemed normal, until
I'd take them off, and everything seemed impossibly blue till my brain
adjusted.

Yellow is supposed to increase the contrast in snow, by reducing the blue

I do not know about LEDs but I switched all the bulbs to FL three years ago
(there is one left that I never use). No noise and I will never look back. LEDs
will be interesting when they will compete with FLs in TCO.

There are FL ballasts for tube style fluorescent lights that make no noise and
are dimmable.

Do your bulbs turn on instantly when installed into a 2-bulb fixture
with only one switch?

I got a couple of CFLs for my Kitchen  Ceiling light. Now, it takes over
a second for them both to illuminate. Maybe they are cheaper than yours,
or maybe the delay is due to both of them being used together.

Unfortunately &quot;cheap&quot; isn't a good guage in my experience. It's better
to aim for brand. Sometimes the cheapest are actually much better then
those more expensive. Took a while to find a brand that was consistantly
good, and it was Phillips. TTYL

&quot;Instant on&quot; seems quite variable in CFLs.  Most get brighter
during their initial few minutes of on times, and some start
out quite noticeably dimmer than &quot;full brightness&quot; or take a
few seconds to turn on at all.

I've been surprisingly happy with Ikea as a provider of CFLs.
They're also one of the few manufacturers who actually bothers
to design lamps to USE CFLs...

Has anyone made the switch to LED bulbs at home or office?

I found LED lighting a very good complementary technology for reducing and
improving home lighting. But I wouldn't say it is already competitive enough
to fully substitute older technologies.

CFL and Fluorescent both get reduced lifetime if the are installed in places
where ON/OFF is frequent, so my approach is to use LED in those places. In
other places, I got very good results with LEDs installed in such a way
that, thanks to indirect light, you reduce the need to switch more powerful
bulbs, and to me it is even more pleasant. If it is time to read for
instance, then it is time to switch the CFL on.

Doing creative LED installations (e.g.12V) is much easier than with standard
220v installs, as you are not limited AFAIK by regulatory mandates on where
a 12V may go.

my 2 cents

I am wondering when other light sources will be available.

I have at my solering place two 70W metal halogen (gas discharge technology) -relatively large spotlights.
They are just wonderful!
Shines like two 200&quot; &quot;common&quot; halogen, but much less heat and lower electricity bill.
Unfortunately theese are not very stabl ein light putputs (flicker a bit) as the electronical supply systems are really hard to get to buy.
They are used in fashion stores, etc.

Really strange that this technology is not pushed more - it use much less power than normal flourescent tubes and bulbs.

I also have read about microwave pumped sulfur gas lamps.  Microwaves heat sulfur inside a glass ball untiul it becomes a bright shining plasma.  1kW in a small box.  Problemis that they can not be made small, but they were tested some years ago in Stockholm in  a tunnel where light guides conveyed the light and leaked it out here and there.
Maybe we could have a light center in our house and only fiber optics to the lamps.

There are even more technologies under way.

To me it is just a wonder people are not aware...

...And loose less power to heat than old inductor type.

Philips generally know how to make quality product OR know how to

FWIW when Australian Consumer tested CFLs relatively recently, Philips
had the most output per Watt input of any and were up to twice as

I've got nearly all CFL's, whatever it is they sell at Costco, and in
the past six months two of them have failed with arcing at the base and
heavy smoke.  Both times someone was around to notice and get them off
quickly but I wonder if they'd have exposed a flame if left on.  Also
very hot of course.

Phillips sounds pretty good.

Did you report the failure to Costco or your local fire chief?
They can't get a device banned if they don't know about the problem.

Certain models of LG fridges have a capacitor on the compressor board that
catches fire, and thereby sets the house on fire. It took many such fires before
Toronto fire department took notice. Even with the formal evidence, LG dragged
their feet in issuing a recall, and they weren't very thorough about it either.

I have a footprint in one of my eagle libraries for a SD card connector...but I couldn't identify the mfg or anything on it (nothing in the description) so I figured I'd go use an ALPS that I can at least purchase.  But the data sheet has pin number assignements...but no signal names...so I figure they all must be a standard pinout?

There are many different configuration of connectors for the SD cards.
The standard card is 24mm wide and quite difficult to found if you
need MMC/SD compatible card. Sparkfun has a chinese one indeed. The
miniSD has 20mm wide and is the most common connector available
everywhere.
On Digikey has a Molex 3 in one card (19 pin or so) for MMC, SD and SM.

The Costco here sells Feit brand. IIRC they were about $8US per 4-pack after
a subsidy by the local electric utility. It seems like all of the local
retailers also carry almost exclusively Feit.

I bought several packages of the 32 watt model at Costco about 2 years ago,
installed about 20 of them and have had about 6 failures. Only one of them
produced smoke. Most of them seem to run hot enough to produce discoloration
of the plastic base that houses the electronics. All of them produced nearly
full brightness within a few seconds when new, but now most start out dim
and take about 2 minutes.

Philips does sound better!

While it MAY be a case of differences between product lines, the LG brand CD-R drives
I had a few years ago would NOT reliably read audio disks at anything other than
1x speed. They would just 'hang' at higher speeds. Made ripping a CD a PITA.
Finally changed the drives for cheap AOpen's and Acers' and had no more problems.
I have heard of DOA LG LCD monitors (I know a dealer quite well and his tech HATES
the LG failure rates), so I too avoid LG as a matter of policy.
And their washer/driers are flimsily built (I bothered to look just to be 'diligent').

Yes, you did.  :P  You get the source code to all of their toolchain
when you buy their package, so therefore, it's open source.

Now, whether you can share that source code with other people once you
have purchased it, that is another story.  :D  I doubt that this is
the case, and therefore the license would not be compatible with the
GPL (Linux's open source license).

You got it right - they got it wrong.

Many tool vendors license the source to you, it's not
&quot;open&quot;.

Back in 1998 when Eric Raymond and Richard Stallman
had their fight, it was about &quot;open source&quot; rather
than &quot;freedom&quot;. Nine years later we end up with both
having been watered down considerably.

Cheerful regards,

I think the problem is that the word 'free' in English is overloaded
with two meanings: liberty and price.  It causes confusion when
talking about charging money for Free software.

There is nothing wrong with charging money for open source software,
ie software you get the source code for, rather than just a binary
blob.  However, for it to be Free software (in the GNU Public License
sense of the word), you need the freedom to be able to redistribute it
however you see fit.

Which of course will drive the price to zero or near zero.

Not really.  We are quite willing to pay RedHat and similar quite some
large number of dollars to get software that some one is supposedly
taking care of, modifying as they deem necessary, and perhaps even doing
work that we would like to have done, and I'm pretty sure here are lots
of companies in the same boat.  &quot;Open source software&quot; is only &quot;free&quot; if
you have &quot;free resources&quot; to apply to its support, and for something the
size of an operating system, that's a substantial amount of support that
would cost a substantial amount of money spent &quot;not obviously in pursuit
of the company mission.&quot;  (a large company, after all, is capable of
spending a large amount of money on a large &quot;IT&quot; department that does
little more than act as a first-responder and negotiator for software
that is already &quot;supported&quot; by the vendor.)

RMS always said that programmers would make their living providing
&quot;support&quot;; perhaps it's no accident that gnu software can be such a
pain in the ass...

The cost of the source, not the total cost of ownership, of course.

FreeRTOS supports dsPIC/PIC24 and is under modified GPL which
allows you to use it under freely without the limitation of GPL under
certain condition . You can also get commercial license option
(OpenRTOS and SafeRTOS).

Hi,

I need to wind some coils for some low frequency work (120kHz to 180kHz)
along the lines of the LF RFID tags.  As I understand the theory of
using the transmitted carrier to power the tag, the more turns the
better and the coil should be an air wound coil without a ferrite or
iron core (in order to have lots of turns).

One of the Microchip app notes also states that 1mH is about max that
can be easily achieved for an air wound coil.  I also have a physical
size limitation of about 20mm diameter and 5mm thickness.

With 32g wire I calculate I need about 270 turns to do this so I'm
looking for some sort of plastic coil form that so I don't have to
manufacture 12 of them. Or, perhaps even a source of 1mH coils that fit
the criteria.

The task of the coil is to form a resonant tank that develops a voltage
and current high enough to turn on an NPN transistor which pulls the
reset line of the micro-processor low.  Once the excitation field has
been removed, the processor resets and does its' thing and then goes
back to sleep.

Thanks

John Dammeyer
