I am interested in an AR-15 in 7.62x51. Any suggestions as to which
company makes a decent one? Reliability, accuracy and relatively
inexpensive mags, in that order, are the criteria I am going by at the
moment.

Obviously, something that doesn't beat itself to death after a few
thousand rounds would be good too.

It's called an AR-10.  You can't feed a loaded 7.62x51 cartridge though
an AR-15 lower's magazine well and the bolt of an AR-15 upper  doesn't
cycle far enough to handle that long of cartridge.  Ok, it could be cut
and sectioned but is that worth the effort? Even if you did it wouldn't
be an AR-15 except for the serial number.  You can get as much range (or
more) as a 7.62x51  with the 6.5 Grendel cartridge using am AR-15 lower
(and perhaps a 243 WSSM or 257 WSSM as is done by Olympic Arms)  but of
course those aren't 7.62x51.

You're talking about the AR-10, the rifle that was scaled down from the
308 (7.62x51) to the 223 (5.56x45). I know that's not 100% accurate and
that the civilian calibers are minutely different from their military
counterparts, but for all practical purposes they're exchangable.

As for the AR-10, the German company Oberland Arms is making the OA-10,
which is match grade, albeit at a match grade price, using modified G3
magazines.

Sounds to me like you want the AR-10. Check out Armalite.

The market is very fluid in semi-auto .308's.  The one stable
manufacturer, in my opinion , would be Armalite with their AR-10.  I
have had no dissatisfied customers with any of their variations.

An AR-15 doesn't have the action length to handle the 7.62x51/.308
You're looking for an AR-10

First off, it is an AR-10 if it is 7.62 x 51 (or just call it .308).

The one I own is ArmaLite in an A2 style.

Reliability is not the best.  It jams very often (spent round doesn't eject
and trys to feed with new round), almost 1 per magazine.  The jams are
regardless of ammo, magazine or number of rounds in the magazine.  I've used
factory .308, reloaded some of my own and even mil surp.  It all jams in
mine.
Accuracy is superb.  I wouldn't hesitate to use it for hunting.  I am also
planning on using it for competition shooting in local events once I get the
jamming to stop.
Magazines are expensive.

I will probably buy another, but from DPMS in an A4 (flat top and
stainless).  Their up front prices on the gun are better and the mags are
less expensive as well.  I am not sure how the parts will interchange, if at
all.  I know they don't use the same magazines so I will assume the uppers
and lowers will not match up, but can not certain.

That would be an AR-10 or SR-25, depending on maker.  Google away.
You're looking at at least a couple of grand anyway and a bunch of
expensive mags and accessories, no matter who makes it.

Their own, or the one that fits Knights Armament SR-25. Commonly available
in the $30 range. KA charges significantly more for theirs. The DPMS mags
are steel, and extremely rugged. I bought mine when they first came out, and
paid for the privilege ($59 a piece). At the time, KA was charging $120. At
the time, DPMS was shipping only the 10 rd plastic mags, so there was no
other choice. Now they ship standard with the steel 20's

In the past you would be strictly speacking about an AR10.  But
technology being what it is and depending on how deep your pocketsm,
there is a company that has a unique modular lower.  The user is able
to swap out the mag well, bolt and barrel and convert their AR type
firearm to shoot 308 (7.62 x 51).

The company is called MGI Hydra QCB Modular/Multi-Caliber AR Weapons
System.

What is really nice is say you're set up for .223 and you are shooting
at 200 yards.  Now you move back to the 500 yard mark but want to shoot
something a little heavier (6.5 Grendel or 458 SOCOM), you can swap out
the barrel (not upper) and the bolt and your good to go.  The barrel
doesn't have to be from MGI with the expection of going to the .308.
You have to purchase their 308 barrel setup as no one else sells that
setup for an AR15 type rifle.

At the last gun show I meet with one of the reps from MGI.  They were
working on mag wells for Glock and some other handgun magazines so that
officers had the option of shooting a short or long arm with the same
magazines.

I believe a starting package (.223) was $1,800.  Addtional mag wells,
bolts and barrels were less then the price of a new upper.  Oh and you
don't have to use their upper but you lose the functionality of having
to just replace the barrel and bolt.
