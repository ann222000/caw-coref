A Hawaii woodpecker and a California woodpecker were arguing about
which place had the toughest trees. The Hawaii woodpecker said Hawaii
had a tree that no woodpecker could peck.

The California woodpecker accepted his challenge and promptly pecked a
hole in the tree with no problem. The Hawaiian woodpecker was amazed.

The California woodpecker then challenged the Hawaiian woodpecker to
peck a tree in California that was absolutely im-peckable (a term
woodpeckers like to use). The Hawaiian woodpecker expressed
confidence, said he could do it and accepted the challenge.

So the two flew to California where the Hawaii woodpecker successfully
pecked the so-called impeckable tree with no problem.

Both woodpeckers were terribly confused. How is it that the
Californian woodpecker was able to peck the Hawaiian tree and the
Hawaiian woodpecker was able to peck the Californian tree, yet neither
was able to peck the tree in their own state?

After much woodpecker-pondering, they both came to the same
conclusion: Â Apparently your pecker is harder when you're away from
home.
