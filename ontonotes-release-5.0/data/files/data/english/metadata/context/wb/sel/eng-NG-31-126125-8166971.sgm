Kylie Minogue's 'Doctor Who' return?

Thursday, 9th August 2007, 12:19

LIFE STYLE EXTRA (UK) - Kylie Minogue wants to return to 'Doctor Who'
permanently as the Doctor's new assistant.

The Australian pop sensation - and former 'Neighbours' star - plays a
waitress on the Titanic in this year's 'Doctor Who' Christmas special
and has wowed everyone on set.

Kylie said: &quot;If they want me back I will be there like a shot.&quot;

And producers of the BBC show - which is filmed in South Wales - are
just as keen for Kylie to join the cast full time.

An insider told Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper: &quot;Kylie just
sizzles in her scenes. It's going to be one of the best episodes
ever.&quot;

Kylie has grown very close to co-star David Tennant - who plays the
time-travelling Doctor - during filming.

The Scottish actor was left devastated after his mother, Helen
McDonald, lost her battle with cancer and the 'Spinning Around' singer
- who beat breast cancer - has been offering him support.

A source said: &quot;Kylie was really sympathetic. She knows how terrible
cancer is and took a lot of care to comfort David.&quot;

If Kylie does become the Doctor's new assistant she will be following
in the footsteps of comedian Catherine Tate, who had a cameo in last
year's Christmas special and has now been signed up to star as the
Doctor's assistant for a full 13-week series next spring.

Could you maybe try discussing Doctor Who occasionally, rather than simply
making
allegations about Yads' supposed sexual preferences? The joke is wearing
thin.

As for Kylie becoming a permanent companion, no thanks. Although I will wait
til I see the next Christmas special.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;A source said: &quot;Kylie was really sympathetic. She knows how terrible
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;cancer is and took a lot of care to comfort David.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If Kylie does become the Doctor's new assistant she will be following
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;in the footsteps of comedian Catherine Tate, who had a cameo in last
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;year's Christmas special and has now been signed up to star as the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Doctor's assistant for a full 13-week series next spring.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Kylie as the next companion??  YES!!!!!!

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Kylie Minogue's 'Doctor Who' return?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Thursday, 9th August 2007, 12:19

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;LIFE STYLE EXTRA (UK) - Kylie Minogue wants to return to 'Doctor Who'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;permanently as the Doctor's new assistant.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;The Australian pop sensation - and former 'Neighbours' star - plays a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;waitress on the Titanic in this year's 'Doctor Who' Christmas special
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;and has wowed everyone on set.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Kylie said: &quot;If they want me back I will be there like a shot.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;And producers of the BBC show - which is filmed in South Wales - are
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;just as keen for Kylie to join the cast full time.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;An insider told Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper: &quot;Kylie just
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;sizzles in her scenes. It's going to be one of the best episodes
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;ever.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Kylie has grown very close to co-star David Tennant - who plays the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;time-travelling Doctor - during filming.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;The Scottish actor was left devastated after his mother, Helen
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;McDonald, lost her battle with cancer and the 'Spinning Around' singer
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;- who beat breast cancer - has been offering him support.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;A source said: &quot;Kylie was really sympathetic. She knows how terrible
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;cancer is and took a lot of care to comfort David.&quot;

Socrates taught his students that the pursuit of truth can only begin once
they start to question and analyze every belief that they ever held dear. If
a certain belief passes the tests of evidence, deduction, and logic, it
should be kept. If it doesn't, the belief should not only be discarded, but
the thinker must also then question why he was led to believe the erroneous
