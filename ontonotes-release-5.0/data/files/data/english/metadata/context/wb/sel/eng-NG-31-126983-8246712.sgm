Got an email from an editor who will shortly publish --for a nice
payday-- a nonfiction piece by me about MTR.

As you know, better than anyone, probably, the first line of my
&quot;writer's bio&quot; statement is &quot;Bob Sloan is a working writer who doesn't
have, and isn't pursuing an MFA.&quot;

Regarding the bio, the editor wrote, &quot;I love the opening line.&quot;

So much for your ignorant notion that might hurt me. . .

Hey!

Given your track record of puffing it appears you have pulled off
the MFA thing again. Just like you did when you were interviewed online.
Perhaps that overnight stay on post minded land and a ten minute airplane
ride looking at mining in process will pay off for you.  You have come a
long way since 2005 when that became an &quot;issue&quot; for you.  I do hope you have
sufficient integrity to state the matter as policy disagreement rather than
the over the top descriptors such as holocost.    Too much to hope for,

Your MFA story is quite an interesting one.    One could believe that the
real reason for that is somewhat transparent effort to mask you lack of a
BA.
.   That is clearly established as a likely reason when you couldn't
remember when you graduated.  That is here:

&quot;I am not familiar with French outlining formats,
and so will just give
you some general tips, from my perspective.  For
the record, I was an
English major at Purdue University (class of '72)
and am quite familiar
with Frost's work.&quot;

&quot;No, the item was to have a degree from Purdue 1970
English with and
&quot;emphasis on&quot; creative writing.  I agree the
group alias is a joke.
Oh I do have the degree.&quot;

&quot;When did you ask?  (BA, English, Purdue U, 1971, a
smattering of
graduate courses until I figured out I neither
want nor need an MFA.)&quot;

The link to the individual messages to these quotes is here:

http://groups.google.com/group/alt.language.urdu.poetry/msg/55c313a02...

You have nuked the 1970 and 1972 entries, however I have a copy including
header.

But recently when you were interviewed online you took that
individual through the weeds  whining on that it was all very subjective and
really was all about the love of writing and an MFA got in the way of that.
However, in 1999 you  blamed being rejected by a Prof in  (two) MFA programs
because you were a pornographer:  Perhaps you should have helped Adams
understand you better by detailing your &quot;erotica&quot; career.   A little later
you saw the light and
applied for another MFA program whining that you were ten years behind in
your goals (you probably underestimated the time).   In that piece you waxed
longingly for the benefits of an MFA.  You said,  &quot; I ain't got any of that,
and while I can cite publication in some hard
to crack print venues --the current issue of &quot;Wind&quot; magazine has a story
I workshopped in afo-- I've wished a number of times I had the money to
go get an MFA.  Be one of those &quot;older student&quot; types..&quot;

Your online interview excuse:

&quot;It's all subjective. I think the first prerequisite is understanding the
primary responsibility of an author is to tell the story. &quot;Story&quot; is what
writing's all about. Harry Crews said it best when he counseled, &quot;If you
want to send a message, go to Western Union. If you want to preach, find a
pulpit. If you want to advocate social reform, stand for public office. But
if you want to write fiction, tell a story.&quot;

The balance of your excuse:

SA     You told me, somewhat proudly, that you do not have and are not
pursuing an MFA. A lot of people think a fine art degree is a prerequisite
for an author. What do you think the prerequisites are?

BS     It's all subjective. I think the first prerequisite is understanding
the primary responsibility of an author is to tell the story. &quot;Story&quot; is
what writing's all about. Harry Crews said it best when he counseled, &quot;If
you want to send a message, go to Western Union. If you want to preach, find
a pulpit. If you want to advocate social reform, stand for public office.
But if you want to write fiction, tell a story.&quot;

The second prerequisite is a love of language, an appreciation of the power
of words, and a desire to master that power, so far as your talent and
understanding allow.

The third prerequisite is a willingness to allow that desire to take center
stage in your life, no matter what else you find yourself doing with most of
your time.

MFA programs smother more writers than they empower. The current &quot;hot
ticket&quot; is one of those low residency programs where people get the MFA
without actually living on a campus, or being a student as it's typically
defined. People spend a hellacious amount of money in those things, and seem
to come out the other end no better at writing than when the process
started. They could have taken that money and spent two weeks on the
Trans-Siberian Express, or ridden a tramp steamer to a few ports in Latin
America. They could have gone someplace they'd never been, checked into a
bed and breakfast and said to a few people, &quot;Tell me about yourself.&quot;

Perhaps most editors pay a little more attention to a submission from
someone holding an MFA, but good writing will find its way into print
whatever a writer's academic history (or academic lack).

And of course, someone who has an MFA can probably find a job teaching
someplace, but that's not necessarily a good thing. The writers I most
admire, no matter what century they lived in, weren't career academics.
Larry Brown was a fireman. Jim Harrison was a day laborer. Mark Twain
piloted steamboats. Jack London prospected and fished and any number of
other things. I know some people who once upon a time had all it took to be
good, maybe even great writers. Then they went to college and basically
never left. They don't know anyone who isn't an academic, and the stunted
work they produce shows that limited perspective.

http://www.eclectica.org/v11n1/adams.html

Your New Orleans whine:

&quot;Twenty years later, seemed like every school with an English Department
had a writing program.  In that first M.F.A. program I always had the
feeling I'd torpedoed myself when I casually mentioned I was supporting
my writing habit by selling &quot;erotica&quot; to the men's mags.  Didn't matter
I was paying for computers and postage and printers and all the rest of
it with checks from Larry Flynt.  Didn't matter afterward what I wrote,
the professors hated it, and I got labeled a &quot;pornographer&quot; pretty
quick&quot;

Your third rant about a fellowhsip MFA program:I didn't know this until
years later, but I was in the first batch of
undergrads selected for a spanking new writing program at Purdue U, back
in '67.  A dozen or so began, and probably half of us finished.  I
suspect the saving grace of the program was the professors, most of them
sporting brand new PhDs and not at all sure what one did to &quot;teach
writing&quot; sort of felt their way through the process with their
students.

Years later, when I had Uncle Sugar's Steel Yachting and Carousing Club
(aka the Navy) paying for it I was in two different M.F.A. programs,
neither of which I finished.  I found a world of changes, and after
talking to a few undergrads at both the institutions in question, I
found myself thinking I'd lucked out by being in the program I was in
when I was in it.

In that old undergrad program, which was started when there were almost
no such undergrad level courses offered, we were encouraged to write any

explain why, at length, but it'd all fly over your pointy little head.

&gt; However, in 1999 you  blamed being rejected by a Prof in  (two) MFA programs

I was in two MFA programs in New Orleans.

Neither seemed, then or now, worth the time, expense, and effort
required to complete the degree.

I was never &quot;rejected&quot; by a professor in either program.  The guy at
Tulane who was my &quot;portfolio advisor&quot; was a Canadian who hated all
things American, and most especially all things uniformed and
American.  I was in the Navy at the time and tired of his enmity real
fast.

&gt; your goals (you probably underestimated the time).   In that piece you waxed
&gt; longingly for the benefits of an MFA.  You said,  &quot; I ain't got any of that,
&gt; and while I can cite publication in some hard

I have, on occasion wished I had an MFA.

Not enough to go out and get one though.

As noted, they're expensive and time consuming.

The only required work for an MFA, FlintNose, in the event you don't
know, is to write a publishable novel.  I've already done that
twice.

&gt; &quot;It's all subjective. I think the first prerequisite is understanding the
&gt; primary responsibility of an author is to tell the story. &quot;Story&quot; is what
&gt; writing's all about. Harry Crews said it best when he counseled, &quot;If you
&gt; want to send a message, go to Western Union. If you want to preach, find a
&gt; pulpit. If you want to advocate social reform, stand for public office. But
&gt; if you want to write fiction, tell a story.&quot;

That, and what follows, PebblePalate, isn't an excuse, it's my
personal take on the state of American literature.

You got anything to say about that?  It's flattering to think you'd
clip-n-paste so much of my own notions, but it's be interesting,
maybe, to read your own ideas.

Especially since they'd be based on profound ignorance about the state
of litbiz at the moment.

You're good at clip-n-paste, RockWithLips, but none of what you've c-n-
p'd is as good --or as funny-- as this:

I got to Googling around tonight, and discovered an odd thing.

On Apr 13, 2003 Mallrock was typing in a thread that had morphed to
discussing hillbilly accents. Describing his family constellation,
Mallrock wrote he had one brother:

&quot;Both of my parents were mountaineers (one Eastern KY and one WV) and
they, my brother, and I all did not have mountain accents.&quot;

Note he did not write &quot;brothers.&quot;

You can read the whole post at http://tinyurl.com/pojhw It's msg #8

Now, on Nov 9, 2002, in another posting, Mallrock wrote, &quot;My brother
died in 1989, which was prior to these blood thinning drugs being
commonly sued for this purpose.&quot;

That entire thread is at http://tinyurl.com/oyyvs and it's msg #4

So lemme get this straight. . .

FlintLips said his brother Mallrock died in the recent past, and
Mallrock said _his_ only brother died in 1989. . .

What the. . .??!!??

Is PebblePalate posting from beyond the grave or what?

Just wondering is all. . .

Now _that's_ good cut-n-paste.
