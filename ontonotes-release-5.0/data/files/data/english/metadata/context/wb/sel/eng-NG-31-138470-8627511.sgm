Crew,

Yesterday,  I attended the funeral of a dear friend.  It was a long ways
from our home;  the funeral was near Clearfield, Pa.  (That's in &quot;the
wilds&quot; of north western Pa.)

In the cemetery I observed a genealogist's dream come true:  The stones
(both in the &quot;old&quot; and the &quot;new&quot; sections of the cemetery) had the
following:

1.  On the &quot;front&quot; side of the stones were the names and pertinent dates
for the deceased............as well as the maiden names of the females.

2.  On the &quot;back&quot; side of the stones....the surname was also embossed in
bold/large letters. (Surely makes it easy to locate the grave of a party
of interest!)

(Some exceptions to this custom were noted.  But.....this tradition
seems to be the &quot;norm&quot; in this area.)

I've never before observed this sort of thing.  And so,  I inquired
about it with the officiating pastor.  He responded by saying something
to the effect.....&quot;doesn't everybody do it this way&quot;?  I noted that this
has been the custom in this area for many generations..............the
same tradition was observed on stones dating back to the 1800's.

My.......wouldn't it simplify &quot;kin hunting&quot;  if everybody
did...indeed......do it this way!!??

Dave????

p.s.  I also noted another thing that I've never seen before:  On a
stone adjacent to the burial site of my friend was the name of the
deceased as well as the name of his dog and a deptiction of a dog.  (Do
you suppose this man had his dog buried with  him??!  The pastor didn't
seem to know much about this burial site.)
