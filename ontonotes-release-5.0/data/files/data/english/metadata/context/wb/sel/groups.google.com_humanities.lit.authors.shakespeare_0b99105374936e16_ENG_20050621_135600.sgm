Shakespeare &amp; the Bible are the best possible investment you can make.

As the renaissance rises and postmodernism fades, a deep knowledge of
Shakespeare &amp; the Bible will be necessary to succeed in NY publishing,
academia, and Hollywood.

Join the renaissance!!!

If modernism is the reaction against established principles in art,
architecture, literature, etc., (&quot;Genre of art and literature that
makes a self-conscious break with previous genres&quot;), and
post-modernism is presumably a similar reaction against modernism
(&quot;Genre of art and literature and especially architecture in reaction
against principles and practices of established modernism&quot;), it all
seems to be Alice in Wonderland world without foundations,
underpinnings, etc.. Is this why philosophy now seeks to define
itself in literary terms?

But belles lettres since WW II is mostly crap, too. We are in the age
of the anti-hero, have seen the Last Picture Show, etc.. As moral
relativists we believe in success in a material culture that defines
itself, prescribing values for citizens, feeling good, etc.. Maybe
science fiction chronicles our condition today, like Brave New World.

Evidently, your complaints about the human condition are analogous to
the theme of h.l.a.s. in that you are looking for identity of someone
that makes sense of a mystery? Possibly that's what Shakespeare was
doing, too, and his art is of several lenses presenting perspectives
on being. If so, the existential-type of philosophy seems better than
your neo-classicism motivated by pessimism, which leaves you only with
a rear-view mirror. bookburn

Actually the classics are eternal.

The past is prologue.

Studying Shakespeare and the Bible are the best ways to learn about
tomorrow.

I've come not to appease, but to appall,
To pass judgement and differentiate,
Imagination's sword drawn, standing tall,
I've come to seal the postmodernist's fate.
Not with criticism but with poetry,
I don't fight the fog, but I light the light,
To mark the boundary between rocks and sea,
To mark the Truth in this postmodern night.
I've come not to attack, but to defend,
A generation's sacred heritage,
Though you deny us, you won't put an end,
To the honest poet's beautiful rage.
I've come to exalt, raise, and resurrect,
To honor, love, pray, forgive, and protect.

Hello Bookburn,

The renaissance is rising!!!

There's something I saw in the mountain mist,
That too I perceived in the thundering wave,
But then when I felt it, when we first kissed,
I knew it was something I had to save.
Nature's noble rapture, changing seasons,
Beauty owns the blossoms and falling leaves,
But man walks alone in owning reasons,
Reflected in all is what he believes.
I passed it last night, riding the warm wind,
I was out late, rebelling against time,
Against the wind I had set out to find,
Words to anchor eternity in rhyme.
O' Captain my Captain, hark, it's in me,
This thundering soul, creating to be free.
--Becket Knottingham

On a bright blue, blustery February day, I'm standing on top of Kill
Devil Hill, looking out over towards Cape Point, Hatteras, witnessing
from afar the eternal battle being performed by two opposing oceans.
Just off Cape Point the northbound Gulf Stream and the cold currents
hailing from the Arctic meet head on, sending white spray over
one-hundred feet into the air. Over the years these conflicting
currents have been depositing sand off Hatteras, and the resulting
diamond-shaped sand bar has come to be known as the Diamond Shoals,
it's fang-like shifting sand bars pushing seaward to snare the unwary
mariner. While the shoals are the largest and most formidable hazard,
the entire Carolina coast is marked by such eternally shifting,
submerged features, and thus long ago sailors were inspired to call it,
&quot;The Graveyard of the Atlantic.&quot; And as I look out over the clashing
currents, which are indiscernible but for the mist they throw
one-hundred feet into the air, I am reminded of how it are those
invisible inner conflicts between the polar opposites of our souls from
which the visible art departs, aspiring towards the heavens. Art is the
eternal piece of us striving to be free, and thus all generations seek
a renaissance, so as to join Edmund Burke's community of eternal souls.

I found out about Cape Point from a book my girlfriend gave me for
Christmas entitled, THE GRAVEYARD OF THE ATLANTIC. The book narrates
the stories of the numerous shipwrecks off the Carolina coast. She'd
also given me a poetry anthology, which is a cool one, because it's
small and there aren't any of those tedious introductions to the
poems-- there're only the poet's words. In it I finally found that one
Robert Frost poem about making your avocation your vocation, and that's
exactly what the WWW's allowing us to do-- to make our passion our
profession.

This past Christmas Eve day, I arrived back home in Northern snowbound
Ohio, and I unwrapped the present. Books make awesome presents, as
they're great to read when you find yourself missing the person who
gave them to you. My folks and my sister and her husband had all gone
to sleep, and I stayed up alone, sitting infront of the fading fire,
going back and forth between the two books in the blinking of the
Christmas-tree lights, reading Frost and Longfellow, then about the
North Carolina pirates, then Emerson and Shakespeare, and then about
the brave Carolina coast guards, one of whom had had inscribed on his
tombstone, &quot;Today the sea and sky are contending to see who's the
mightiest-- there will certainly be ships in distress. A voice shall
beckon us forth, and her name is duty. We must venture out, and pray
that we hear her sister calling us back.&quot; And late that night, staring
into the dying coals, I by and by became aware of the link between the
two books-- the poetry anthology and THE GRAVEYARD OF THE ATLANTIC,
that existed within my soul. For out upon the ocean, in my mind's eye,
I perceived a three-masted frigate. Her cargo was the poetry of the
Great Books, and she was sailing through a treacherous era which was
fast becoming a graveyard for the Western intellect. And in the stark
silence that is the hallmark of Christmas Eve, I discerned the
forgotten Truth's call of distress.

I just want to save the dying publishing industry &amp; Hollywood with some
classic storytelling:   !!!

DOTHAN, Ala. (AP) - Shares of Movie Gallery Inc., the nation's
second-biggest video-rental chain, fell on Wednesday after the company
forecast sluggish sales for the next few months, blaming a slowdown at
movie theaters and weakness in the release schedule for upcoming home
videos.Its shares tumbled fell $5.05, or 15 percent, to close at $27.84
in late Wednesday trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, where it was
among the top percentage losers. The stock has surged nearly 56 percent
so far this year, and is up about 23 percent since late March, when
Blockbuster, the nation's largest video-rental chain, ended a hostile
bid to acquire Hollywood Entertainment. Movie Gallery completed its
$1.2 billion acquisition of Hollywood Entertainment in April.

It is oft stated that the internet has been revolutionizing the
world's economy, and as a medium of the printed word, it makes sense
that the internet would allow entrepreneurial poets to revolutionize
literature. The simple purpose of all businesses is to serve the people
with some life-enhancing entity, and we felt that with the shortage of
rhyming, metered poetry and the scarcity of profound novels and rich
literature with strong plots and noble characters, we could quickly
corner the market and make a decent living by publishing and promoting
such timeless entities. We could marry our passions to our professions,
make our avocations our vocations, and serve the world with a
renaissance.

Basic research in physics had lead to quantum mechanics, which when
applied to the silicon lattice lead to the engineering of the
fundamental component of the modern economy--the transistor. The
organization of transistors lead to the integrated circuit, the
grouping of integrated circuits led to computers, and the need to
govern computer operations ushered in the development of software. As
local computers were networked together via standardized hardware and
software, the internet was born. Then came the whole development of
content and commerce sites, including internet portals and shopping
destinations, and behold, jollyroger.com entered its own unique time
and place in the entrepreneurial progression of technology, as the
flagship of the WWW RenaissanceTM. And now the center of innovation has
progressed beyond the software and to the soul, and the latest
innovation is a classical oasis wherein the timeless aesthetic truths
are buoyed by science and technology. The internet is the ocean, our
serve is our hull, we stand at the helm with our programming abilities,
but that higher purpose is governed by our vision, and we fly the flag
of classical poetry. Innovation hath moved from Sand Hill Road in San
Franscisco to Boone, North Carolina--from the medium to the message,
from Silicon Valley to Poetry Mountain.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From physics, which has its roots in philosophy and religion, to

quantum mechanics, to the transistor, to the integrated circuit, to
hardware, to software, to the internet, to culture, to poetry. And all
of a sudden, the &quot;New New&quot; thing, the latest innovation in technology,
is the world's classical portal. For the first time in all of history,
there exists a corner upon this watery globe, accessible from all
latitudes, devoted to the higher ideals and eternal truths that keep us
free. The eternal is forever new, and thus while so often forgotten or
obscured in humanity's daily pursuits, the eternal marks both the
beginning and end of all innovations. Religion, science, then
technology, and on the web poetry's been set free.

And what better time than this for technology to allow traditional
poets to triumph in the literary arena? The infrastructure to support
contemporary classical literature had been eroded by the postmodern
ideology and its diverse manifestations throughout the greater culture.
Science and technology, which enabled the mass media based on sound and
video, amplified the more superficial, Dionysian, idolatrous aspects of
mankind, and when coupled with the postmodern theories which were
fostered by the misapplication of science to the soul, the written Word
was assaulted on all fronts. People read less in the popular culture,
and reading meant less within the academy. And yet, they still had this
marvelous potential and will to know their eternal soul. Hence the
cynicism and irony and apathy which afflicts this generation, which
shall never be satiated by the fleeting Dionysian alone--we long for
the eternal, and eternity is only known by thoughts, and thoughts are
only known by words. The deconstruction and desecration hath cleared
the field of our imaginations for a renaissance.

At first glance, it may seem ironic that as creative writing workshops
proliferated, the quality and profundity of the literature declined,
but upon closer scrutiny, this makes sense. To begin with, creative
writing cannot be taught, and thus the classes were most often lead by
dishonest hucksters and politicians. And the students who majored in
it, who were by definition blind to the irony, went on to become the
postmodern agents, editors, and literary government officials so as to
subsidize their ambitions. For it was generally the narrow-minded and
dull-witted who actually believed that creative writing was to be
learned from a fringe feminist rather than divinely inspired upon the
open ocean of human endeavor, and thus the postmodern conformers
flattered the feminist politician-poets, and they received the key
recommendations which landed them jobs in the presently sinking
literary industry.

While modern marketing gurus are promoting the fragmentation of
literary demographics and publishing and promoting more superficial,
celebrity-oriented work, we have shoved off in the opposite direction
with the vision of serving everyone with the timeless truths. Our goal
has never been to be all things to all people--but it has been to be
the best to everyone.

Throughout jollyroger.com's formative years, we gave agents and editors
ample opportunities to join us in venturing forth aboard the flagship
of the WWW Renaissance, and while some stated that they were delighted
in what we were doing, and while we signed with a couple prominent
agencies, we could find no editors at prominent houses who had the
courage, nor foresight, to sign their souls aboard. Many of them are
just now learning how to check their email. Because of indifference,
ignorance, and arrogance, they simply refused to believe that the good
people were ready for a renaissance, and as technophobe humanists, they
failed to see the vast potential of the internet to deliver this
cultural commodity. Because they sought to serve their egos rather than
the people, they foresook both their duty and their profitability. And
they left the WWW Renaissance for the physicists and poets.

It is no secret that a rather large contingent had boarded
postmodernism's sinking literary ships believing that God was dead, and
it has always been the tyrannical tendency of the postmodernist to
project their prejudices upon all things. Fresh out of creative writing
class, with their ambitions overshadowing their talents, many had gone
into the literary business for the sole purpose of negation--to tear
down that which was greater than themselves, for that was the trade
that they had been taught in postmodern academia. They were interested
in neither art nor commerce, but only in power, nihilism, and empty
prestige. And while the latter traits may work fine on a college
campus, where nobody takes anything too seriously except for their own
opinions, but out here, where eternity's wind blows, opinions do not
matter. Only the Truth can survive. Petty politics is no match for
honesty married to technology, and for &quot;Oak planks of reason, riveted
with rhyme, designed to voyage across all of time.&quot;

There is a just symmetry underlying all existence, and the result of
the postmodern establishment's prejudices and apprehensions has been
that they have missed the boat--the WWW RenaissanceTM has been ours to
define and defend, to build and promote upon this wondrous new medium.
As is so often the case, the postmodernists' prejudices became their
prison. Only in their degraded, deconstructed context could they
pretend to be poets, but a poet is only as good as the higher Truths
that they pen. Neither wit, wisdom, nor poetry can be bought by
politics, nor pedantry, nor money.

In a free country, freedom belongs to the open minds and the free
spirits. The nihilism and pedantical politics, which is substituted for
the rhyming truth in the modern academy, cannot survive in the free
market. Only words which serve the noble heart and soul--the sublime
sentiments of the good, honest people of the world--ever survive in the
form of classics.

Reflecting upon the nature of our classical portal, it is easy to see
what the internet has done. It has removed the middlemen from standing
in-between the Greats and the people. And by middlemen I mean the
postmodern agents, editors, professors, reviewers, critics, and MBA's
who are taught to focus on the bottom line while ignoring the higher
ideals. As Chuck D. of Public Enemy said,

The majors are going to have to share the marketplace with the
public and with the artist. The Internet won't wipe them out, but no
longer will the majors make a 300 percent profit on CDs; no longer will
middlemen determine what the price of a CD will be or how the public
will view an artist. Because of the Internet, artists will bypass
retail, marketing, and promotional outlets and go directly to the
public. The middlemen and retail outfits will have to adjust.

For the Greats were the world's greatest communicators, and as J.D.
Salinger said about The Catcher in The Rye, they need no middlemen
critics--they market themselves, they publish themselves, they promote
themselves, and they signify themselves. There is nothing more intimate
than reading words, for when ye pick up a Great Book, nobody and
nothing stand between yer soul and the author's. Perhaps the most
beautiful thing about the Constitution and the Declaration of
Independence were that they were written for the people, and one
doesn't have to go to Princeton, nor Harvard, nor Yale to understand
their sublime eloquence. One doesn't have to become a lawyer nor earn a
Ph.D. in public policy. All one has to do is read them, think about
them, and talk about them. A republic's freedom is staked upon an
educated people; and what better way to educate oneself than to read
the Greats, and what better way to inspire others to read them than a
renaissance?

There are few greater sins than standing between children and their
potential, and that is what the aging postmodern liberals are best at.
For only in a darkened context can ...
