I have a set of shorty headers on an '88 350 in my truck (the 65 GMC)
Right now they just barely clear the sides of the tranny ( I actually had to
put in a smaller shift modulator because the stock one was touching the
header ) :-O

Anyways...
Is there any way to spread the headers out. I plan to put in a 700R4 and I
assume I am going to need a lil more room...

P.S. The way I spread them to start with was by putting one of those really
scrawny lil floor jacks in between the header and the tranny and just slowly
cranking, but I dunno if I wanna keep doing that. :-)

My son had the same problem with his '66 Chevy truck, when the one header
was too close to the engine that the starter wouldn't fit right. What we
did, right or wrong, but it worked great, was to take the header off, grind
the factory welds off from each tube at the flange, and once the flange was
free from all the tubes, we ground the proper angle we needed on each tube,
the re-welded each tube back onto the flange. It sounds scarier than it
really is, if you have the right gear and want to &quot;do it right&quot;.

WOW!

I wish I had the &quot;right gear&quot;... anyone think that this is a bad idea for
any reason? Sounds great to me!

Now I am gealous because I wish I could do that.... :-)

"/> No, its a good idea and basicly how it is done.
Summit racing even sells custon header kits with a flanges,
colectors and several pre-bent tudes and you weld it up
anyway you need too.. this saves the &quot;cutting your header&quot; step :)

The header is not &quot;tuned&quot; anymore. The primaries are staggered specifically
to maximize scavenging from one cylinder to the other. You can get a cheap
set of block huggers. There are only a few companies that make headers for
this vehicle. You cant go to a swapped and get any old set of headers for
any old small block Chevy. There are things to consider like port shape
(oval or D), spark plug orientation (angle or straight), primary tube
diameter for torque (1 1/2, 1 5/8, 1 3/4 ect). When you buy the proper
headers for the heads and vehicle then there are no problems like this. For
example on my 65, with aluminum angle plug heads and d shape ports there was
only one header made that would work in that chassis, hooker supercomp. The
other choice is to make your own, but its not as simple as just cut and weld
as it may seem, it take some math to figure orientation, direction, velocity
and pulse timing along with vacuum created by the passing gasses.

If you aren't looking for performance then switch back to manifolds and save
the headache. But if you mess with how the header manufacture tuned the
headers, then you will end up with poor performance and unequal power
causing much other problems as one side will be running efficiently and the
side you mess with will not.

Thanks GreaseMonkey....

How would one determine which set is the best when you have a number of
variables to take into consideration... such as:
Engine
Plug orientation
Tranny
Vehicle
engine mounts
....?

I did look around, and Kragens told me that these would be a perfect fit,
but you dont really know until you try..

One thing to do is call the manufacture, or get their catalog which will lay
this all out for you. I get PAW catalogs which have all these variables and
more. These where the only headers available with the 1 5/8 primaries.
Hedman had a set but they were 1 1/2. On something as unique as these
applications I hardly trust the guys at the discount auto parts stores, I
havn't found them to be really knowledgeable.

Thanks again...

Any reccomendations for manufacturers to contact?

If it helps,
I have a small block 350 (I am almost certain that the block is an '88, and
I think that it is a 4-bolt main, if that makes a difference)
non-angled plugs (I'm not sure what that would really be called)

Plugs are in a o==oo==o configuration...
of course its in a 65 GMC...

Price is not as much of an obstacle as it used to be :-)

The only thing that matters is the heads, sparkplugs. If the spark plugs go
straight in from the side then they are not angles if they where any you
looked at them from the top it would look like \ /\ / versus I II I. The
port location is pretty much the same its just the shape of the port, most
where just ovals.

P.A.W headers pxh-7114, some clutch linkage might be required for standards,
if you have a exhaust mounted alternator you need a special bracket. Non
angle plug heads, 1 1/2 primaries 3&quot; collectors. They say from 66 to 87,
well the body style didn't change till 67, and the frame never changed till
73. $79.95

Hedman headers 69260. Non angle plug heads. 1 1/2 primaries, 3&quot; collector.
$122.95

Hooker competition headers HOO-2452 non angle plug heads, 1 5/8 primaries
2.5 collector. $154.95 I recommend these for your application, the larger
primaries will enhance torque and power over the 1 1/2 inch primaries, and
the 2.5 collectors will be fine, run a 2.25 exhaust all the way out.

Hooker Super competition HOO-2801. Fit angle plug heads, special A/C
bracket required . $379.95. These ones I use, they are slightly longer
than the competitions and fit my heads. I know for sure there is absolutely
no interference problems with this and a auto.

There you got'em

Call P.A.W at 818-678-3000

Taking a .050&quot; or so off of a pipe to get it to move a little won't
affect anything on headers. If you really sit down and look at the
length of the pipes, most of them aren't all that accurately sized at
all.
The other thing that can be done is to put the header under stress and
warm up the pipes near the engine one by one to a red heat and that
will cause them to flex a bit and take a new shape. You can do this
in several stages to get even more movement of the pipe down at the
tranny. Insure that the angle doesn't change tho or you may have some
interesting problems hooking up the rest of the exhaust system.
