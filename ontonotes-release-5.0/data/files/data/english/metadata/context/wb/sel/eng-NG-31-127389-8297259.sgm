I kid you not...what I found in the thrift store this morning among the
books:

title: &quot;How to cure yourself of positive thinking&quot;

by: Donald G. Smith

My copy was a paperback, copyrighted 1976, 1978 by Doanld G. Smith, and
the First Pocket Books, under the Kangaroo label, printed 1978,

ISBN 0671814230

And, it has an afterword by (Dr.) Laurence J. Peter, co-author of &quot;The
Peter Principle&quot;

For anyone who cares, I found it on Amazon.com as a used book, and for
whatever reason the hardback price was $ 0.84 and the mass market
paperback was $ 8.99. It did not show up by ISBN (I've had that happen
before) but by going to advanced search and put in the exact title and the
exact author name. I got my copy for 25 cents.

(There are other booksellers including half.com and alibris if you can't
find a copy on Amazon).

On the back of my copy is this quote:

&quot;What? You're still hung up on positive thinking? Are you fed up with the
Pollyanna claptrap of positive thinkers? Are you sick of eing told to make
lists, love your job, get involved, go along with the times......&quot;

In the front is a saying:

&quot;He who would distinguish the true from the false must have an adequate
idea of what is true and false&quot;
Spinoza

here is the &quot;Contents:

1. Good is the absence of bad
2. The negative myth
3. The semantics of the enemy
4. Resisting change
5. Dynamic negativism
6. Delusion and Fallacies
7. Tranquility
8. Pragmatic negativism
9. Everybody sing
10. Its hard to be negative

Had an postscript
afterward
index (which also has some funny entries, including comments on Norman
vincent peal, lots of defective thinking, etc).

Another book it reminds me of is &quot;The B.S. Factor&quot; by Arthur Herzog
from a similar era. BMJ would love this book. I've read some of it.
Then there is &quot;Growing up absurd&quot; by Paul Goodman

I'll have to look for it.

You may remember that poem/essay &quot;Desiderata&quot;, which was popular in the
late '60s/early '70s.  A lot of people adopted what it said as personal
philosophies and I admit to being one of them, though I was 18 at the time.

Soon afterwards came the spoof &quot;Deteriorata&quot;:

On the other hand, considering what real life is like, perhaps it wasn't a
send-up....

I've read some of it.

I'm underwhelmed by the proof, but that's my mathematical
training.  Unfortunately all it shows is that someone else
believes Dave is wrong and was able to get a book published
on the subject.  But it does provide a source to quote,
which is a good contribution.

My ex-boss was a rabid fan of anything and everything that he produced,

I wonder how many of those Roman emperors were really smart or just
greedy-selfish jerks, some 1/3+ of which got assassinated or poisoned or
backstabbed anywhere from 1-2 days after being appointed on up to months
to 1-2 years later.

Oh, yeah, another book on empires said that half of the kings died of
unnatural causes (i.e. by their replacements or confederates).

Well said. I'm sure you didn't expect a formal mathematical proof, but
given the source, did you really expect anything more than this? Maybe
if it had been billed as &quot;I just found an interesting book disagreeing

Yeah, I know. You were looking for something on the level of Godel's
Theorem, with thousands of pages of appendices, hundreds of thousands of
data points, at least 25 PhD level authors, 3 or more Nobel Prizes among
them, $2 billion budget, ten year program, 200 inch telescope time, and a
real, honest-to-goodness stuffed Loch Ness Monster, and King Kong
(captured and pickled). Right?

;-)

Unfortunately all it shows is that someone else

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Earlier this evening I read the postscript where the author talks about
people's response to his book, and his appearance on such things as radio
talk shows. The way he reports it, lots of people appreciated what he was
telling people but there were &quot;fundamentalists&quot; who sent him hate letters,
too (I'm not surprised).

But it does provide a source to quote,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

1. Have at it!
2. If I see any more &quot;kindred spirit&quot; stuff, I'll dump it on SRC for y'all
to see, share, commiserate upon, etc., etc.
3. Quite a bit of the text (I read the whole book earlier) suggests that
&quot;positive attitude&quot; was being pushed pretty heavily even back
then. Nothing in the book is high level intellectual, and the
author came accross to me as being more like an &quot;Ann Landers&quot;
&quot;practical advice about social situations&quot; kind of thing and his
view about all this stuff is, I'm sorry to say, that it is quite a
bit of touchy-feelie, PC, warm-fuzzy superficial phoney crap.
4. There seems to be a wee bit of &quot;extension&quot; into the present with this
since www.despair.com is, IIRC, a modern day version of &quot;negative
attitude&quot; management advice and I've posted the &quot;demotivationals&quot;
several times (again below, too, FWIW), but the guys who came up
with them really do sell a &quot;party line&quot; line of thinking on this
stuff and they seem to get _some_ business.
5. And, FWIW, FYI, I had to work for two years with a superficial,
self-promoting, blowhard, manipulative, cheating, duplicitous
phoney back some 30 years ago and I didn't like it. There were
dozens of people around me and we all saw the same thing and we
all talked about it. Most had a dim view of the guy but their
level of outspokeness was variable. Some were really bothered by
the guy. As it turned out, the guy did do me a couple of pretty
big favors, and in the end, I did him a couple of pretty big
favors right back so I don't think either one of us owes the other
anything. And, I'm sure that a ton of this kind of quid pro quo
goes on in real life all over the world (biographies
and biographical histories often have substantial details on this)
as the &quot;high rollers&quot; play high and higher stakes with each other
and underlings haven't the faintest idea what is going on but they
are all really just playing the role of cannon fodder. I wrestle
continuously with the question of how the fight between good and
evil will end or will it just break even or even how could we
measure it (perhaps we can't and never will). All I know is that
there are a lot of authors who wrote books that attempted to
expose, correct, stop, reduce, etc., a lot of bad things or
otherwise attempted to try to make the world a better place to
live in the future. I am in favor of that. And, I wish more people
would care; too many just don't.

Demotivationals:

Underacheivement - The tallest blade of grass is the first to be cut by the
lawnmower.

Trouble - Luck can't last a lifetime unless you die young.

Stupidity - Quitters never win, winners never quit, but those who never
win and never quit are idiots.

Procrastination - Hard work often pays off after time, but laziness always
pays off now.

Problems - No matter how great and destructive your problems may
seem now, remember, you've probably only seen the tip of them.

Pessimism - Every dark cloud has a silver lining, but lightning kills
hundreds of people each year who are trying to find it.

Mistakes - It could be that the purpose of your life is only to serve as a
warning to others.

Misfortune - While good fortune often eludes you, this kind never misses.

Mediocrity - It takes a lot less time and most people won't notice the
difference until its too late.

Losing - If at first you don't succeed, failure may be your style.

Ineptitude - If you can't learn to do something well, learn to enjoy doing it
poorly.

Idiocy - Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups.

Humiliation - The harder you try, the dumber you look.

Futility - You'll always miss 100% of the shots you don't take, and,
statistically speaking, 99% of the shots you do.

Failure - When your best just isn't good enough.

Doubt - In the battle between you and the world, bet on the world.

Despair - Its always darkest just before it goes pitch black.

Defeat - For every winner, there are dozens of losers. Odds are you're
one of them.

Conformity - When people are free to do as they please, they usually
imitate each other.

Burnout - Attitudes are contageous. Mine might kill you.

Adversity - That which does not kill me postpones the inevitable.

Of course, without mentioning anyone's name in specific (hint, hint),
anyone can go into the archives and find one author of posts here who

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wasn't a send-up....

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, I just finished my book. And, I agree with 98% of it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, there is Scott Adams' book &quot;Seven Years of Highly Deffective
&gt;&gt;&gt; People&quot; meant, surely, to be a spoof on Steve Covey's book &quot;Seven

Maybe you or maybe you didn't see the &quot;Scecrets to get out of any crisis&quot;
advice, either? (below) And, I didn't write them, either:

----
(source unknown, but believed to be in the public domain):

&quot;Some Thoughts To Get You Through Any Crisis&quot;

1. Indecision is the key to flexibility
2. Happiness is merely the remission of pain
3. The facts, although interesting, are irrelevant.
4. Sometimes too much to drink is not enough.
5. Nostalgia isn't what it used to be.
6. There is absolutely no substitute for genuine lack of preparation.
7. You can't tell which way the train went by looking at the track.
8. The careful application of terror is also a form of communication.
9. Someone who thinks logically is a nice contrast to the real world.
10. Things are more like they are today than they ever have been before.
11. Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.
12. Anything worth fighting for is worth fighting dirty for.
13. Friends may come and go, but enemies accumulate.
14. I have seen the truth and it makes no sense.
15. Suicide is the most sincere form of self-criticism.
16. If you think that there is good in everybody, you haven't met
everybody.
17. All things being equal, fat people use more soap.
18. If you can smile when things go wrong, you have someone in mind to
blame.
19. One-seventh of your life is spent on Monday.
20. By the time you can make ends meet, they move the ends.
21. Not one shred of evidence supports the notion that life is serious.
22. The more you run over a dead cat, the flatter it gets.
23. There is always one more imbecile than you counted on.
24. This is as bad as it can get, but don't bet on it.
25. Never wrestle with a pig. You both get all dirty, and the pig likes
it.
26. You can observer a lot just by watching.
27. Three correct guesses in a row and you qualify to be an expert.
28. If you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there.

It depends on whether you are buying or selling. I find lots of very nice
books for cheap. This morning, at another thrift store, I bought several
hardbacks for 25 cents each. One will be a gift to someone at my local
bank. One is a scholarly work on recent history/economics in Guatemala
(complete with photos, graphs, tables of data, going back 150 years, and
involving a major trade with foreigne countries including imperialist
USA), another book is on early history (looks like a college textbook) and
I may read it. One is a fairly recent scholarly book on the famous indian,
Sitting Bull, and the dealings and wars between his tribes and the US govt
(many photos, maps, lists, many refernces &amp; sources). And, a couple more.
One is another &quot;anit-Dave&quot; book on management which compares Machiavelli
to a modern manager's job (I may look more closely at that book, too).

Of course, it can be profitable to find such books for 25 cents to buy
and, say, $5-10 or more to sell on Amazon.com.

But, yes, there are a lot of books on Amazon for very cheap, too.

Famous fiction authors (Clancy, Danielle Steele, etc) come out with a new
book and all of the hungry hoards clammor to get the latest book (like the
iPod herd, the iPhone herds), and buy it at $25-30. What is happening, is
that a lot of these people buy the book at the high price, read it as
quickly as possible, then re-sell it on Amazon to get as much money back
as possible and recycle that money into a new purchase. If you wait months
after a new book comes out, you can buy a used copy for very cheap. And,
if you go to www.booksalefinder.com , you can find the book sales where the
books are usually $1 for hardbacks, all kinds.

Jared Diamond's famous books (Guns..., collapse...) are now down to around
$5 (+/- $1) as used on Amazon, if you want to read either one.

It is good that it

It is also a fact that about 98-99% of all books end up being almost
worthless after 1-5 years, roughly, and at book sales I go to, almost no
one is interested in any fiction, and there are many tables of books in
beautiful condition, with fine dust jackets, and almost no one wants them.

an escape and for pleasure).

There may be details that will explain this if one looks. Rare, interest,
value, author signature, etc. Some books on Amazon are priced too high,
too. You have to also look at sales rank which is also available if you
click around. Very low sales rank (i.e. very high number) prices are
usually unreliable or too high or both.

Rare books are a specialty: its a very small buyer market and the prices
can be very high to tens of thousands of dollars for the right book and I
think these guys are slightly nuts. Most of them don't even read the book.
Some consider the book as an investment, only but the technical knowledge
goes way beyond my interest. I saw, but did not touch, a book from the
1500s that was worth $12,000. The oldest book I ever touched was 300
years old and the pages felt very different from anything in any book I
ever touched and if I wanted to buy it, cost $200 and I actually thought
about it.

It's not that the main concepts change but that entire course outlines can
be made completely dependent upon specific editions of a textbook,
particularly if, say, software was part of the process.  Often, this means

Personally, I seldom had any objections if a student used an earlier

that old textbooks become all dinged, abused and beaten up after many

Theoretically, that's true, provided that those curricula are written by
those who either teach the material or those who will be affected by it (e.

less say about it now because the educationists need to get involved and
add their warm-and-cuddly stuff.

At the university level, the textbook market dynamics is quite
different than at the high school level (and lower).

At the k-12 school level, the market is largely driven the curriculum
changes done by various large jurisdictions.  (ie.  Hardly anybody
else buys new high school textbooks, besides school boards and some
private schools).  At the college/university level, the market is
driven by the 2nd handed textbook market eating into the sales of new
copies of textbooks.

Did this particular undergraduate control theory course require the
use of complex analysis (ie.  Cauchy's theorem, residues, contour
integration, etc ...) ?

Over the years I've noticed there were two distinct types of
undergraduate control theory courses.  One was a course which didn't
require complex analysis, and the other type was a more advanced
course which did use complex analysis extensively.  The former was
typically done at the undergraduate level, while the latter was done
at the graduate level.

The undergrad control theory course I took was the more advanced one
which extensively used complex analysis, though it was also cross-
listed as an undergraduate course.  (Technically it was probably a
graduate course, that the incoming graduate students typically
enrolled in).  The catch was the more advanced course required as a
prerequisite, some previous knowledge of the mathematics like Laplace
+ Fourier transforms, complex analysis, partial differential
equations, etc ...  The professor just assumed we already knew the
math, and didn't bother to go over it again.

In contrast, the undergraduate control theory course that the vast
majority of engineering folks took, didn't require any previous
knowledge of things like Laplace transforms and didn't really use much
(if any) complex analysis.  I heard they typically spent the first few
weeks covering the math stuff like Laplace + Fourier transforms,
though they didn't cover anything which involved PDE's.  Back when I
was an undergrad, most engineers took this particular control theory
course in their sophomore year, typically before any of them even took
the partial differential equations course. (The PDE's course had a
section on Laplace + Fourier transforms).

Maybe this was the first stage of watering down the controls theory
course?  Over the years I've noticed many older undergraduate control
theory textbooks from the early 1960's and before, actually used
complex analysis and PDE's extensively.  Peeking through several older
university course calendars from the 1960's and earlier, I noticed the
undergraduate control theory courses at many places did require some
use of complex analysis and PDE's.

The engineering physics folks had to take the more advanced control
theory course which extensively used complex analysis, in our junior
year.   At the time it was only offered once each school year, where
coincidently the engineering physics folks had already taken the
mandatory courses on complex analysis and partial differential
equations the previous term.

The more advanced control theory course I took in undergrad, didn't

I found out about that a number of years ago when I changed books for the
dynamics course I taught.  I submitted the information before the summer
break and, since the course started in the new year, thought that there was
more than enough time for the bookstore to place the order and get any
problems sorted out.  Just before the course was to start, I got an urgent
call from the bookstore that the text was out of print--some six months
after we submitted our booklist.  Fortunately, the publisher granted
permission to allow the book to be photocopied, but the print shop had to
cut up my copy for that.

I was less than impressed.

Two Bear Stearns hedge funds collapse

Bear Stearns late yesterday informed investors in two battered hedge
funds that their investments have become practically worthless. The
firm's higher-risk Enhanced Leverage Fund, vested heavily in subprime
mortgage assets, has effectively lost all of its value, but the more
conservative High-Grade fund is also down 91 percent. Bear Stearns
shares dropped 3.6 percent in after-hours trading. (The New York
Times, free registration required) At the end of March, the Leveraged
fund held $638 million of capital and the High-Grade fund $925
million. The meltdown is a &quot;watershed&quot; event, said Sean Egan of Egan-
Jones ratings. &quot;It begs the question of how other market participants
have fared.&quot; (Bloomberg)

Stocks point down on subprime, tech sector fears

U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower opening as investors digested
the subprime mortgage-fueled collapse of two Bear Stearns hedge fund
and after-hours earnings reports from Yahoo! and Intel. (AP in Yahoo!
Finance) Intel reported that lower computer prices had cut into profit
margins, while Yahoo! lowered its earnings forecasts. (MarketWatch)
The markets are also awaiting consumer-price inflation data and Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony before Congress later this morning.
&quot;The Bear Stearns hedge fund debacle will be the main theme weighing
on markets today,&quot; said Juergen Lukasser of Vienna-based Constantia
Privatbank. (Bloomberg)

Illuminating the dark side of phone cards

Immigrants, the elderly and other low-income people largely rely on
prepaid phone cards to stay in touch, and their suspicions that the
phone cards are short-changing them are being confirmed -- by phone-
card providers. In March, the largest player in the lightly regulated
$4 billion-a-year industry, IDT Corp., sued nine competitors for
selling cards with about 60 percent fewer minutes than advertised.
Three firms settled, but six other are fighting back, noting that IDT
settled a class action suit over similar charges in January. &quot;The
number of minutes the card tells you that you have, you get half of
that,&quot; notes Alma Hernandez, 22, a native Mexican living in Atlanta.

It seems like the 2nd handed textbook market essentially became
worldwide sometime during the mid-late 1990's, when ebay and web
bookstores became popular.  Before the 1990's, the 2nd handed textbook
market seemed to be mostly local, typically around a college/
university campus.

This has probably narrowed the window of opportunity for which the
publishers can profit, before the 2nd handed textbook market starts to
significantly eat into the sales of new copies of textbooks.  The
publishers' strategy in adapting to this accelerated worldwide 2nd
handed market, is to bring out new editions more frequently and adding
in all kinds of other crap like cdroms, textbook web site
subscriptions, etc ...

Before the 1980's, textbooks were updated maybe once a decade or so in
areas like science and engineering.  (It may be different in other
fields like law, etc ...).  These days they seem to be updated as
often as every 2 or 3 years.

The more serious issue is the gross decline in prices for used books,

The kiddies usually gave me the do-we-have-to-learn-this line, trotting out

In theory, one was supposed to teach according to the course outline.  But,
if there was too much mewling and puking, I would sometimes be encouraged
to either cut back or completely toss it out.  After all, the students had
to have a positive learning experience.

Since the outlines were on file for people to examine, I kept hoping that a
student would actually take the time to look up what they actually
contained and what was supposed to be taught, and then play lawyer with the
administration if all the material as stated wasn't taught.  (I brought up
this issue in a course that I took when the material was significantly
different than what was given in the university calendar.  The following
year, the description was changed to match what I had been taught.)  No
such luck, though.  Apparently, getting proper value for one's tuition
money wasn't sufficiently motivating.  The students only played lawyer when
it came to avoiding work and getting something for nothing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That's not surprising.  Unfortunately, a lot of textbooks are simply

Most freshman and sophomore college textbooks seem to be like that for
the most part.

On a different topic, did you ever take the junior/senior year
engineering course on electromagnetic theory?

I somehow don't think informing them was encouraged.

That's more likely the case.

I doubt that.  I think the prof in question didn't bother updating the
description by the time I took his course.

No.  I only took courses that were relevant to what I was studying.

Heh.  Anything to lighten up their workload is music to their ears?

I've seen that quite a number of times.  I remember seeing the course
catalog at some places, where they had really old courses still listed
which were not offered for the previous decade or two.  Other cases
were of the watered down versions of old courses, which had the same
course catalog numbers and old descriptions.  They were too lazy to
update them in a timely manner.

I don't remember many, if any, MechE undergrads taking electromagnetic
theory.  It was mostly EE, engineering physics, and the odd
engineering major (from other areas) or two enrolled.  (The physics
folks usually enrolled in the physics department's version of the
course).

The electromagnetism course I took was the physics department's
version.  Comparing the difference between the physics and engineering
versions, they were literally 95% identical in content back when I was
an undergraduate.  The only main difference was that physics version
assumed the students already knew the math (ie. vector calculus,
ordinary + partial differential equations, etc ...), and didn't bother
to review over it again.  In the engineering version, they actually
spent the first week or two going over the math stuff like vector
calculus (ie. line + surface integrals, stokes theorem, divergence
theorem, etc ...).

Neither course covered much, if any, stuff related to design aspects.
These days the engineering version of the course is somewhat watered
down.  The physics version doesn't appear to have been significantly
watered down yet.  Though that's not to say that it will remain that
way into the near future.
