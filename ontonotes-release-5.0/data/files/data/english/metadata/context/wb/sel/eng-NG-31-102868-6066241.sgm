Had my first sightings of the following at Pashan Lake over this weekend:

Saturday:
(1) Red-throated flycatcher,
(2) Great tit - a pair. Seemed to be choosing leaves by banging them on a
tree's bark. Then they would drop some and take some others to a particular
tree. Nesting behaviour?
(3) Pied kingfishers (3 of them, for a short while, probably did not decide
to perch).
(4) Small minivet,
(5) White browed fantail.
(6) Glossy Ibis pair (non br).

Sunday:
(1) Comb duck (2 non breeding),
(2) Common moorhen,
(3) Zitting cisticola (?)
(4) Scaly-breasted munia pair.

Lots of un-id'ed stuff on both days. Overall identified species count in the
40's.

I will try to post more records/queries when time permits and where hardware
(read Compact Flash) co-operates.

Can you please help with the id of the third one? Sorry for the poor image
quality.

Abhishek.

Either Pallid or Montague's Harrier. Impossible to be certain in such a
shot. regards Bill
