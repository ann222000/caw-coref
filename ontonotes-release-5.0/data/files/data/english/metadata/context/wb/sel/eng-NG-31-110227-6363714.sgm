Reading over the latest round of this ongoing discussion, the only
thing that's clear is that after more than two years we still don't
even have a firm consensus on what the questions or issues are.  This
means that not only can we not consider possible replies, but we can't
even put the troublesome confusions aside because we still don't know
what they are.  I'm as guilty as this as any of us.  But I think the
other readers and contributors to this longstanding debate (Moe, Pat,
Mary, Al, etc.) will agree that our two heroic protagonists (or
antagonists, if you prefer) Colin and Curtis continue to talk past
each other on a number of important points.  I don't wish to implicate
either of you or to take a stand one way or another, but I think there
are several key points on which you two agree that continue to confuse
this discussion.  In the interest of moving things along, in a
philosophical rather than a progressive sense, let me briefly state
several of these in no particular order.  In doing this, keep in mind
I'm positing statements that I hope we can all agree on, which means
they are necessarily more general.

1) We have a world.

Note that I avoid saying "there is" a world, or that a world
"exists".  Though this way of formulating this claim would be far more
common and intuitive, it's simply too problematic given the kinds of
issues in play here.  On this point you both obviously agree.  Forbes
is committed to there being a world, i.e. nature, that is "mind-
independent" or simply put, metaphysical.  This view is called
realism, but one error Forbes makes is then trying to interpret
Colin's views in terms of realism/anti-realism.  However, this misses
the force of Colin's objections.  But neither of you dispute that we
have a world.  The question is whether our world exists in a natural,
metaphysical sense.  But we can avoid this question altogether if we
simply agree that our world is common (i.e. shared), and that
different people have at least some of the same experiences and
perceptions.  Forbes is committed to this for obvious reasons.  Colin
is also committed to this because shared experience and perception is
a condition for intelligible communication about anything at all.
What we call our world is common to all beings whose experience we
share (presumably all sentient life, but not such things as extra-
dimensional beings or other ludicrous possibilities).  To spell things
out explicitly, the mutual commitment here is to a (perceptually)
shared world that is not necessarily natural/metaphysical.

2) Language can capture part of our world.

If you accept what I say about our world, then the most contentious
aspects of this statement are the notions of capturing and language.
Is "capturing" a linguistic phenomenon?  Neither of you affirm flawed
representationalism, but there are other ways of construing this
notion of capturing, e.g. isomorphism, constitutive expressivism,
direct access, etc.  All these views amount to is the claim that
language lets us talk about the world.  But this is obviously
tautologous, as Forbes points out.  The point here is that our
perceptually shared world is also partly shared in language.  This
allows us to refine the intelligibility of that which we share, and to
communicate it between different peoples to arrive at new
understandings.  (But the important point I would contribute is that
there are limits to what language can, in principle, capture.  This
isn't fully fleshed out in my own mind yet but clearly it will turn on
the notion of "capturing" we arrive at.  But what doesn't matter is
how broadly we construe what language is.  I'm saying that no matter
how broadly we construe it, there are shared aspects of our lives that
cannot be expressed linguistically because their intelligibility is
more basic than linguistic meaning.)  To spell this mutual commitment
out explicitly, I think both of you agree not only that our world can
be made more intelligible in language but that this is the most
promising approach to communicating shared understanding.

3) "Truth" means those shared aspects of our perception/experience
that language captures.

Those linguistic expressions of our shared experience that are
particularly immune from revision we can call truth.  I think this is
pretty uncontentious, but who knows.  Forbes, even if your view
includes an independent reality, truth is still something that depends
on human beings talking about that reality.  On this definition, there
would be no truth if there were no human beings talking about the
world.  (There might be a reality, but that's purely speculative.)

4) Human beings are part of the world, neither "looking out" on it nor
giving rise to it.

Neither of you agree with dualism or idealism, and only Forbes might
accept a more sophisticated version of materialism, e.g. emergence
theories of consciousness, etc.  But what is clear is that human being
(not "consciousness" or "mind" or whatever; here I'm speaking with
intentional vagueness because clarity is not particularly helpful) and
our world are not independent of each other.  Forbes, when you speak
of mind-independence and worldly impingements you seem to suggest a
distinction between ourselves and our world.  This is not plausible,
and I don't think that's what you mean (this is also why Reid is
untenable; as Colin points out, he's a dualist).  But you haven't said
what your explicit meaning is.  At any rate, the mutual commitment
here is that human beings are not distinct from the world.  This means
there is no meaningful way in which we can speak of our world as
"independent" of us, but it does not mean we somehow create or
construct the world either.  (Here I will point out that speaking of
our world in terms of "reality" is confusing, because it suggests that
there could have been a world prior to human beings coming on the
scene; but you may object that this metaphor of a scene itself
contradicts what I'm saying.  However, this is where Forbes could
stand to learn a thing or two from Heidegger's notions of falling and
thrownness; it's also where the question of time starts to become
seriously important to this discussion.)  So as long as we avoid
speaking in terms of reality and talk about our world instead, I think
you two agree on this claim.

5) Knowledge about our world is possible.

For Curtis, knowledge is acquired.  For Colin, I think it's the
opposite.  We already possess knowledge about our world because we
need it to function, meaning its implicit in having a world.  But
these are different conceptions of knowledge; acquired knowledge is
propositional and habitual, but the kind of knowledge Colin is talking
about is more basic but conventional.  This might not be entirely fair
to Curtis, but I think he does believe that we acquire better and
better epistemic renderings of our world by testing propositional
hypotheses (i.e. more coherent and convergent for rational beings that
perform such tests).  I'll admit I don't know how deeply you two
diverge on what knowledge means.  My sense is that Curtis thinks
knowledge is non-conventional even though we acquire it empirically,
whereas Colin seems to think it's given but still conventional.  But
the mutual commitment here is that exploring our world yields truths
(in the above sense of truth) whether we actively seek them or not.

Now I also think you two share some ground concerning structural
construals of our knowledge, but I don't know enough to comment here.
So perhaps you can take that up.  I have some points I want to make
about these commitments, but I want to see how you receive them before
I proceed.  Even if you both disagree, I will try to articulate them
in my next post.  But to minimize confusion, let's hear what you think
first.  (My points have to do with this excess of world that cannot be
captured in language.)

On your account of (1), I think we should easily see the benifits of
replacing our oldfashioned Forbesian term "the world" with Colin's
newfangled term "shared practices".  This way we eliminiate a very
troubling metaphysical subject-object (mind-world) distinction, among
other positive, pragmatic things.  Instead of seeing beliefs as "in
accord" or "not" with some fixed unitary structure that stands opposed
to us, we can focus more on the purpose, coherence and consequences of
beliefs without getting stuck in stupid skeptical questions - stupid
skeptical and metaphysical questions likw "are there REALLY causally
efficacious physical objects, or did we just POSIT them?"  My aim isnt
to take a side on such a question (i am no idiot social
constructivist) but to undermine the idea that we have to think about
ourselves and the world in this confused way that enables such
distinctions and questions to be intelligible at all.  After tackling
undergrad metaphysics problems and hitting alot of dead ends, Rorty
helped me see how protons and electrons are no more or less "real"
than chairs, computers, wars, or marriages - we just have to get past
the residual religiousity and platonism in philosophy and stop blindly
buying into this idea that there is a domain of the "real" where all
the pure and true things lie.

Let's face it:  The metaphor of "correpondence" to "the world" works
well when we talk about beliefs such as "the cat is on the mat" or
"grass is green" but it doesnt easily work if we want to have beliefs
about abstractions, the past, nonexistent entities, or things that
aren't even rightly called "entities" at all.  It is just retardedly
complicated and cumbersome - at best - to make our understanding of
reality in terms of ostensive definition (i.e. the cat is on the mat,
or grass is green) work when it comes to beliefs like "there is no
santa claus", "charity is better than greed" or " it rained
yesterday".  Wittgenstein clearly showed how silly and fruitless it is
to have an epistemological model built around ostensive definition -
he demonstrated that alot of "stage-setting" (what Taylor called
"background", and Heidegger "preunderstanding") has to come first,
before we can even put ostensive definition on a pedestal as this
ideal and transparent example of "true real knowledge" as
"correspondence with the facts".

(2) and (3) I find suspicious, so I am hesitant to support - they seem
fair but in an imprecise metaphorical sense.  The idea of language
sucessfully or unsuccessfully "capturing" what is first perceived
seems like just another way to say "representing" or "corresponding".
So "capturing" might evoke something helpful, but as a kind of
metaphor, it might also mislead and misconstrue.  What the hell is
"capturing" really?

I think I am reworking my views on what Truth and Knowledge is, based
on Barry Allen's criticism of Rorty.  He argues that it is too fully
linguistified, when it should really be tied more to activity,
practice - rather than reduced to semantic discourse.  The idea that
truth is "what works for us" seems vague enough to get my approval but
the idea that "truth is merely a property of sentences" is something I
am currently unhappy with, insofar as it leads to a view of knowledge
that is exclusively discursive.

On (4), yes my hunch is that we haven't fully understood the
implications of Darwin - of a cultural self-understanding that
appreciates Finitude.  We still think that we can divide the world in
two, putting mind and language on one side, and the mechanistic
knowable indifferent world itself on the other side.  As John McDowell
likes to put it, you can't view your language "from sideways on" in
the way that the idea of "looking at one's language and the world and
comparing the two" suggests.  That realist idea is an absurd relic of
our inherited tradition of total disengagement.  As if the world is
totally other, as if the world is not something with inhabit or
participate in, but instead we float around from outside and observe.
Descartes still haunts us.

On (5), I would'nt want to say that knowledge is merely conventional.
I like Allen's view of knowledge:  human, historical, cultural,
mortal, not a glimpse of the (other)worldly realm that stands against
us.  I am considering Allen's formulation that Knowledge is an
artifactual achievment, rather than merely reducible to lingusitic
data.  But I'm still figuring out what the consequences are once we
push epistemology past the philosopher's discursive biases.

Goddammit. Yes there are shared practices. Where are these shared
practices practiced? The fucking world.

Colin, every time someone says something like this, you have to stop
jumping on them and screaming "METAPHYSICS!!! METAPHYSICS!!!!" It's
not metaphysics. And Hector, believing in a natural world isn't
"metaphysical" either. It's pretty much just the "physical" world.

You have to stop thinking that just because someone uses the word
"real" its immediately implying Platonism. It's not. Yes, the word has
a history - but on your account so does every word and every idea.
Admitting that something - like number - is a necessary element of all
of our conceptual schemas isn't saying that "the world independently
of us, in itself" possesses number. It's just saying that,
objectively, numbers are required by every conceptual schema that we
have. And given that we are IN the world, and NOT looking in on it,
that means that numbers are in the world - just like us. Sometimes it
seems like you want to play the pragmatist while maintaining the
appearance/distinction dichotomy. Numbers belong to the world because
WE belong to the world (which is not a causal claim, just a logical
one). There's nothing ahistorical or metaphysical about that.

Do you find it funny, at all, that this pragmatist anti-metaphysical
stuff is based on a history of metaphysical arguments? And not
actually on pragmatic, experimental science? You know why most
scientists are realists? Because they can't explain otherwise how
science works. You're right, they can't confirm the reality of their
objects, and they don't pretend to, but it's the best working
hypothesis they've got. And they don't have a weird metaphysical
understanding of what's "real" either. What's real is what can be
demonstrated to have observable physical effects on the behavior of
other physical entities. Theories pop up to explain these behaviors,
which often postulate unobserved entities. OMIGOD! A TRANSGRESSION OF
METAPHYSICS!!!!! And then, a few years later, they run an experiment
that demonstrates the existence of whatever entity. In the sense that
the observable entities in the experiment behave just as they would if
the entities were real. And given that this is the deflated criteria
of reality, they are.

I really don't see why this is such a big issue. Fuck.

I'm sorry you don't understand.  I'm not trying to just jump on anyone
who uses certain words, and say "no too metaphysical, try again".  I'm
rather interested in "what do we MEAN by world?" and "what do we MEAN
when we say 'this is true'?" and the like.  Those are the right sorts
of philosophical questions for me.  I think people throw these words
around without unpacking what they mean.  I think alot of our woes in
philosophy comes down to not questioning what they mean.

So you and Forbes, who continually say "Look. Just look around!  It's
the world! see!  world! duh!" are misunderstanding what I'm trying to
suggest and analyse.  I'm sorry you don't get it, I'm trying my best.

I don't see how we should just be satisfied with our inarticulate,
assumed, unquestioned, inherited use of such obviously metaphysically
loaded but conventional and everyday words like "truth", "meaning",
"world", "real", etc.  I don't see how you can call yourself a
philosopher and not want to unpack how these words are deployed into
discourse.

so, yes, our shared social practices are in the world.  where else
would they be?  However, instead of saying the object of analysis
should be the Philosophical Concept "the world", our analysis should
be of social practices, because "the world" isn't a very good thing to
have a Philosophical Concept about.  See - I'm not saying the world
doesnt exist, I'm simply saying it doesn't do any explanatory work.
It's not an important thing to talk about, and considering it as a
philosophically interesting concept that has explanatory power leads
to alot of cartesian nonsense.

Pat, if you read my post you would see that I would never suggest that
scientists should be skeptical about whether the stuff they observe is
real or not.  Jesus christ.  I don't think anyone should be skeptical
about the shit they observe and study - that would presuppose that our
discourse is the sort of thing that links up with the world, that we
can be in accord, or helplessly detached, left in skeptical worries.
Arg.  I feel like I have to repeat myself over and over, and people
just keep thinking I'm some kind of skeptic or antirealist.  Quarks
are just as real as dogs, cats, bank accounts, and headaches.

&gt; &gt; &gt; other physical entities. Theories pop up to explain these behaviors,
&gt; &gt; &gt; which often postulate unobserved entities. OMIGOD! A TRANSGRESSION OF
&gt; &gt; &gt; METAPHYSICS!!!!! And then, a few years later, they run an experiment
&gt; &gt; &gt; that demonstrates the existence of whatever entity. In the sense that
&gt; &gt; &gt; the observable entities in the experiment behave just as they would if
&gt; &gt; &gt; the entities were real. And given that this is the deflated criteria
&gt; &gt; &gt; of reality, they are.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I really don't see why this is such a big issue. Fuck.- Hide quoted text -

pat, once again, I have to not only give you points for content, but
awesomeness of style:
"Colin, every time someone says something like this, you have to stop
jumping on them and screaming "METAPHYSICS!!! METAPHYSICS!!!!" It's
not metaphysics."
for the second time in the last couple weeks you have been quoted on
the forbesfield. this is a great point. I challenge everyone to come
up with such a great, succint point and present it with such panache.
race to concise points!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You have to stop thinking that just because someone uses the word
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;real&quot; its immediately implying Platonism. It's not. Yes, the word has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a history - but on your account so does every word and every idea.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Admitting that something - like number - is a necessary element of all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of our conceptual schemas isn't saying that &quot;the world independently
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of us, in itself&quot; possesses number. It's just saying that,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; objectively, numbers are required by every conceptual schema that we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have. And given that we are IN the world, and NOT looking in on it,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that means that numbers are in the world - just like us. Sometimes it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems like you want to play the pragmatist while maintaining the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appearance/distinction dichotomy. Numbers belong to the world because
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WE belong to the world (which is not a causal claim, just a logical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one). There's nothing ahistorical or metaphysical about that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you find it funny, at all, that this pragmatist anti-metaphysical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff is based on a history of metaphysical arguments? And not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually on pragmatic, experimental science? You know why most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scientists are realists? Because they can't explain otherwise how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; science works. You're right, they can't confirm the reality of their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; objects, and they don't pretend to, but it's the best working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hypothesis they've got. And they don't have a weird metaphysical

Hecky,
I really like how you have set this up.  I have the feeling that you
have the ability to show us a way through this.  I agree with most of
what you said, but a few clarifications before you move on:

As regards 1), I agree with this construal of us as in the world.  I
am not saying that we are disengaged observers, as you obviously
realize.  But when I note mind-independancy as an important property
of truth claims, I only mean it in the sense that there are
undiscovered truths.  It is not to say that truths somehow go beyond
the capacities of our perceptual systems, only that the truth of a
proposition is independant of a) any mind or person having evaluated
its truth, and b) how any particular person has evaluated its truth.
eg.  'Grass is green' is true regardless of whether or not we know
this to be the case or whether or not we are in any position to
evaluate this claim.  I do not think this is best characterized as a
metaphysical concept, unless you think claims like "I have a table in
my living room" or "there are cats in Alpha Centauri" to be
metaphysical.  I think Pat is right to note that this is basically
just a physical understanding.

I can find nothing disagreeable in 2.

As regards 3), I'm not sure about this notion of truth as "those
shared aspects of our perception/experience that language captures."
This seems a bit idealist for me, and perhaps in need of some semantic
tweaking, but I do not find it in need of immediate revision.
Basically I think more along the lines of truth as a property of
statements that describe the world that we experience (rather than the
aspects of experience themselves).  To go back to Reid, hardness is
something we attribute to objects, not to our sensations or
experience.  Thus the statement that the table is hard is a statement
about the table, not just about our shared experience of the table.

With 4), I hope some of the things that I have said here and in the
other post clear up this notion of mind-independancy and how the world
tells us stuff or impinges on us.  All I mean to stress is that a
claim about cats on mats or dinosaurs depends on whether there is a
cat on the mat or whether there were dinosaurs.  Even if I hallucinate
that there is no cat on the mat, if there is a cat there, "the cat is
on the mat" is a true statement, even though I would evaluate it
falsely because of my faulty perceptual appartus.

I have no problem with the claim that we exist in the world: in fact,
in my list in the other thread, I cited me, colin, and john travolta
as part of the world (our world, if you must).  I'm not sure what is
exactly relevant about thrownness and falling, but perhaps you can
explain the relevance of these heideggerian notions to me a bit
better, since I can honestly say I never would have learned a thing
about heidegger (nor gotten over naively bashing him like everyone
here does) if you hadn't written that thesis, taken those classes, and
taken the time to explain it all to me as best you could.  What little
knowledge of heidegger I have I owe it to you (though I promise not to
imply that I have it right, cause at best it is incomplete), so thanks
for that by the way.

Now as regards 5), I don't think I want to whole heartedly deny
convention.  Obviously there is a bit of convention, even if it is
just denotative.  I like that colin is starting to think of knowledge
as artifactual, for this implies that knowledge is a thing that can be
looked at, and that even its relations to its objects can be looked
at.  I think that one of the most important aspects of this relation
is correspondence: that these bodies of knowledge are sensitive to
worldly affairs - they allow us to track the positions of objects, for
example.  While there is an element of convention, and of a pre-
linguistic understanding that can hardly even be gestured at with
language, a very important aspect of our knowledge is that it is
related to objects in such a way that it can be most succinctly
described as 'representing' the world we inhabit; as tracking the
state of the world.  So sure, we found all of our science based on a
pre-understanding that comes to us from the community that we are a
part of: but based on this shared framework, we can use scientific
reasoning to "acquire better and better epistemic renderings of our
world by testing propositional hypotheses (i.e. more coherent and
convergent for rational beings that perform such tests)."  Sure this
means that we are, in a sense, trapped within a particular epistemic
community, but I don't think anyone here would disagree with that.  I
imagine colin to think that this conflicts with my view, because for
some reason I am supposed to be committed to this view of the
scientist as a disengaged ahistorical observer capable of formulating
historically and doxastically independant theories about a world that
they have never directly experienced, but I am not.  All I mean to say
is that with scientific reasoning, coming from any (human)
preconception of and engagement with things, we can come to have
better and better renderings (I do like that word better than
representations) of the world that we inhabit.

A consequence of this view that I feel I must discuss is that there
are, as a matter of historical contingency, many different scientific
paths that we could take, and many different 'paradigms' that we could
settle on, each literally incommensurable with one another.  Being
able to accept this is one of the virtues of structuralism: there are
many different ways to approximatly represent a concrete structure
using a simpler abstract structure, even if there is no perfect or
tractable way to fully represent the target concrete structure with an
abstract one.  Thus, I am not committed to the "unique-route
hypothesis" that says that science can only proceed down one path so
long as its methods remain ideal.  Structural Realism is the only
realist position that I know of that is capable of acknowledging the
legitimacy of incommensurable epistemic communities all working
scientifically yet never reaching a single common end.

OK, and now to discuss colin's response.  I will try to be brief:

"Instead of seeing beliefs as "in accord" or "not" with some fixed
unitary structure that stands opposed to us, we can focus more on the
purpose, coherence and consequences of beliefs without getting stuck
in stupid skeptical questions - stupid skeptical and metaphysical
questions likw "are there REALLY causally efficacious physical
objects, or did we just POSIT them?""

But this is the kind of question good scientists ask all the time
(about individual objects).  Are we really detecting the ether?  Is
this really caloric that is transferring from the hot body to the cold
one?  If these are ridiculous metaphysical questions then not only are
scientists actually metaphysicians, but they are stuck in stupid
skeptical questions.  I actuality, we do think about things in this
way, and it is extremely fruitful.  To deny this is to deny the actual
history and practice of science, and to substitute your own.

"The metaphor of "correpondence" to "the world" works well when we
talk about beliefs such as "the cat is on the mat" or "grass is green"
but it doesnt easily work if we want to have beliefs about
abstractions, the past, nonexistent entities, or things that aren't
even rightly called "entities" at all."

I'm sorry, but how does correspondence not work with these things
too?  Abstracts: 'Euclid's fourth axiom is X' is true iff Euclid's
fourth axiom is X.  The Past:  'Dinosaurs lived on Earth' iff
Dinosaurs lived on Earth (or "it rained yesterday" iff it rained
yesterday).  Nonexistent entities: The terms "God" and "Santa Claus
(the concrete object, the man himself, immortal and fat, jolly old
saint nick that comes down your actual chimney at christmas and gave
you that bike when you were five)" do not correspond to any actual
objects (the extension of these concepts is the null set).  Things
that aren't entities: not sure what those are, but numbers, ghosts,
sensations, and a lot of other things seem to work pretty well within
a correspondence framework.  Necessary truths are the only ground I
know of where correspondence doesn't hold, and I'm not really sure how
I feel about necessary truths so I'm ok with that.  As regards what
you say about ostensive definition, is this in reference to my
definition of truth?  Because it is not ostensive, it is at least
schematized as 'x is p' iff x is p.

"(2) and (3) I find suspicious, so I am hesitant to support - they
seem fair but in an imprecise metaphorical sense."

Get over this anti-metaphorism already.  You yourself quoted someone's
metaphor of looking at language "from sideways on."  You don't see me
saying: 'OHHHHH MY GOD ... its a METAPHOR!  Get it out, get it out!'

Sure, it's a metaphor.  But I understand what you mean by it because I
am trying, not just saying "isn't that just wrong" or "we don't need
that" or "I don't get what you mean" or "this is too metaphorical" or
"metaphysics!".  (you know, Neurath used to uncover bits of
metaphysics in the discussions of the Vienna circle and shout
"Metaphysics" every time he found a metaphysical claim.  Eventually
the others realized he was saying it so often that he should just say
'M' to save time.  Something to think about)

"Quarks are just as real as dogs, cats, bank accounts, and headaches."

This we agree on; and at least we also agree that language isnt merely
conventional, though perhaps for different reasons.

So, inconclusion to another long post, Hecky I await what you have to
say about that which is inexpressible in language (for none of my
qualifications will likely have much to do with that), Pat I think you
hit the nail right on the head, and Colin I think you are as wrong as
ever about us not needing a concept of the world and its contents to
go about our business.  Maybe more so.  :)

I thought, curtis, you actually had a philosophical view.  That way, I
would have somehting to critique.  If you are going to stick to
defending the idea that "we need a concept of the world and its
contents to go about our business" then I'm not going to disagree.  I
would never say that some concept needs to be excorcized from our
vocabulary forever.  I'm not saying that we should stop using the word
"world" because its not how things are.  I'm obviously doing a piss-
poor job of getting my point across, especially when people
characterize themselves as having no significant philosophical
position on these matters, and characterize me as suggesting that we
need to change the way we think about absolutely everything so that
its not metaphysical by my definition.  Arg...

Forbes, I'm critical of things you used to avow, ideas like "without
my philosophy we can be out of touch with reality, lost in our own
minds".  That kind of stuff.  If you are going to tell me everyday non-
philosophers will want and need to use the concept world, I am going
to tell you "no shit", and that I don't care what concepts people
use.  If your philosophical definition of "the world" is the same as
the dictionary, that is "the totality of entities we can experience
and talk about" I'm not going to complain about that either, because
thats just what we mean by "world", thats not really a philosophical
theory.  I am very suspicious that this triviality is all you really
want to assert.

I haven't the faintst idea what the purpose of your "X iff X"
business.  How can I disagree with a tautology?  Get back to me when
you want to defend something contentious rather than obvious.

Also, I think you are confused about what a "metaphor" is.

No No No.  Those are not metaphysical, those are scientific
questions.  You misunderstand.  A skeptical question would not be
something that would make a difference to a scientific experiment but
would involve questions that lie beneath any scientific
investigation.  The logical positivist said that the question was
valid, and rendered unobservables as "not as real" and thus mere
useful fictions.  The realist wants to say that (at least many of) our
theoratical nonobservables work because they are "really there" and
not just "social constructions".  Do you get what I am saying?  This
is the realism vs instrumentalism debate, and my point is that it is
irrelevent to scientific proceedings - the questions are based on
metaphysical representational principles which I am to eschew.  I need
not matter to any scientist whether a theoretical entity is really
just a useful fiction or whether it is really there independently of
our study of it.  Science is concerned with its objects of study, not
the metaphysical ground of reality that such objects inhabit.  I think
this point should be clear.

&gt; I haven't the faintst idea what the purpose of your &quot;X iff X&quot;
&gt; business.  How can I disagree with a tautology?  Get back to me when
&gt; you want to defend something contentious rather than obvious.

&gt; Also, I think you are confused about what a &quot;metaphor&quot; is.

&gt; &gt; Hecky,
&gt; &gt; I really like how you have set this up.  I have the feeling that you
&gt; &gt; have the ability to show us a way through this.  I agree with most of
&gt; &gt; what you said, but a few clarifications before you move on:

&gt; &gt; As regards 1), I agree with this construal of us as in the world.  I
&gt; &gt; am not saying that we are disengaged observers, as you obviously
&gt; &gt; realize.  But when I note mind-independancy as an important property
&gt; &gt; of truth claims, I only mean it in the sense that there are
&gt; &gt; undiscovered truths.  It is not to say that truths somehow go beyond
&gt; &gt; the capacities of our perceptual systems, only that the truth of a
&gt; &gt; proposition is independant of a) any mind or person having evaluated
&gt; &gt; its truth, and b) how any particular person has evaluated its truth.
&gt; &gt; eg.  'Grass is green' is true regardless of whether or not we know
&gt; &gt; this to be the case or whether or not we are in any position to
&gt; &gt; evaluate this claim.  I do not think this is best characterized as a
&gt; &gt; metaphysical concept, unless you think claims like &quot;I have a table in
&gt; &gt; my living room&quot; or &quot;there are cats in Alpha Centauri&quot; to be
&gt; &gt; metaphysical.  I think Pat is right to note that this is basically
&gt; &gt; just a physical understanding.

&gt; &gt; I can find nothing disagreeable in 2.

&gt; &gt; As regards 3), I'm not sure about this notion of truth as &quot;those
&gt; &gt; shared aspects of our perception/experience that language captures.&quot;
&gt; &gt; This seems a bit idealist for me, and perhaps in need of some semantic
&gt; &gt; tweaking, but I do not find it in need of immediate revision.
&gt; &gt; Basically I think more along the lines of truth as a property of
&gt; &gt; statements that describe the world that we experience (rather than the
&gt; &gt; aspects of experience themselves).  To go back to Reid, hardness is
&gt; &gt; something we attribute to objects, not to our sensations or
&gt; &gt; experience.  Thus the statement that the table is hard is a statement
&gt; &gt; about the table, not just about our shared experience of the table.

&gt; &gt; With 4), I hope some of the things that I have said here and in the
&gt; &gt; other post clear up this notion of mind-independancy and how the world
&gt; &gt; tells us stuff or impinges on us.  All I mean to stress is that a
&gt; &gt; claim about cats on mats or dinosaurs depends on whether there is a
&gt; &gt; cat on the mat or whether there were dinosaurs.  Even if I hallucinate
&gt; &gt; that there is no cat on the mat, if there is a cat there, &quot;the cat is
&gt; &gt; on the mat&quot; is a true statement, even though I would evaluate it
&gt; &gt; falsely because of my faulty perceptual appartus.

&gt; &gt; I have no problem with the claim that we exist in the world: in fact,
&gt; &gt; in my list in the other thread, I cited me, colin, and john travolta
&gt; &gt; as part of the world (our world, if you must).  I'm not sure what is
&gt; &gt; exactly relevant about thrownness and falling, but perhaps you can
&gt; &gt; explain the relevance of these heideggerian notions to me a bit
&gt; &gt; better, since I can honestly say I never would have learned a thing
&gt; &gt; about heidegger (nor gotten over naively bashing him like everyone
&gt; &gt; here does) if you hadn't written that thesis, taken those classes, and
&gt; &gt; taken the time to explain it all to me as best you could.  What little
&gt; &gt; knowledge of heidegger I have I owe it to you (though I promise not to
&gt; &gt; imply that I have it right, cause at best it is incomplete), so thanks
&gt; &gt; for that by the way.

&gt; &gt; Now as regards 5), I don't think I want to whole heartedly deny
&gt; &gt; convention.  Obviously there is a bit of convention, even if it is
&gt; &gt; just denotative.  I like that colin is starting to think of knowledge
&gt; &gt; as artifactual, for this implies that knowledge is a thing that can be
&gt; &gt; looked at, and that even its relations to its objects can be looked
&gt; &gt; at.  I think that one of the most important aspects of this relation
&gt; &gt; is correspondence: that these bodies of knowledge are sensitive to
&gt; &gt; worldly affairs - they allow us to track the positions of objects, for
&gt; &gt; example.  While there is an element of convention, and of a pre-
&gt; &gt; linguistic understanding that can hardly even be gestured at with
&gt; &gt; language, a very important aspect of our knowledge is that it is
&gt; &gt; related to objects in such a way that it can be most succinctly
&gt; &gt; described as 'representing' the world we inhabit; as tracking the
&gt; &gt; state of the world.  So sure, we found all of our science based on a
&gt; &gt; pre-understanding that comes to us from the community that we are a
&gt; &gt; part of: but based on this shared framework, we can use scientific
&gt; &gt; reasoning to &quot;acquire better and better epistemic renderings of our
&gt; &gt; world by testing propositional hypotheses (i.e. more coherent and
&gt; &gt; convergent for rational beings that perform such tests).&quot;  Sure this
&gt; &gt; means that we are, in a sense, trapped within a particular epistemic
&gt; &gt; community, but I don't think anyone here would disagree with that.  I
&gt; &gt; imagine colin to think that this conflicts with my view, because for
&gt; &gt; some reason I am supposed to be committed to this view of the
&gt; &gt; scientist as a disengaged ahistorical observer capable of formulating
&gt; &gt; historically and doxastically independant theories about a world that
&gt; &gt; they have never directly experienced, but I am not.  All I mean to say
&gt; &gt; is that with scientific reasoning, coming from any (human)
&gt; &gt; preconception of and engagement with things, we can come to have
&gt; &gt; better and better renderings (I do like that word better than
&gt; &gt; representations) of the world that we inhabit.

&gt; &gt; A consequence of this view that I feel I must discuss is that there
&gt; &gt; are, as a matter of historical contingency, many different scientific
&gt; &gt; paths that we could take, and many different 'paradigms' that we could
&gt; &gt; settle on, each literally incommensurable with one another.  Being
&gt; &gt; able to accept this is one of the virtues of structuralism: there are
&gt; &gt; many different ways to approximatly represent a concrete structure
&gt; &gt; using a simpler abstract structure, even if there is no perfect or
&gt; &gt; tractable way to fully represent the target concrete structure with an
&gt; &gt; abstract one.  Thus, I am not committed to the &quot;unique-route
&gt; &gt; hypothesis&quot; that says that science can only proceed down one path so
&gt; &gt; long as its methods remain ideal.  Structural Realism is the only

Yes.  This point about the world is a trivial point.  I agree.  That
is why it has been so frustrating to have you argue against its very
intelligibility.  Now you apparently understand it.  Its not really a
philosophical point, its more a point about the foundations of how we
talk about things.  Its a groundwork - a universal preunderstanding,
if you will - of how we think and how our language functions, a grasp
of which is necessary for further philosophical ruminations.  If you
now agree that we need the concept of the world to get by, and to
build up a more philosophical understanding of how we think about,
talk about, and experience the world, then we have no disagreement.
Dispute resolved.

Except ... if there is a world of objects, one that shapes our
discourse, realism gets its world to be represented or "captured," and
the pragmatists lose except when they are quixotically swashbuckling
against invisible (or mistaken) platonists.  There is a world.  It is
made of tables and chairs and muons and quasars: but not ether or
caloric.  That's the way the world is, and we had to study the world
scientifically to figure that out.  If you are not going to deny this,
and the idea that we need the concept of the world, then I think your
pragmatism either a) fails or b) becomes realism.

Tying up some loose ends:
-This "'X' iff X" is not a tautology.  This is evidenced by the fact
that the either X could be used to define truth conditions in two
seperate languages (eg. 'Schnee ist weis' iff snow is white).  This
schema allows us to define truth conditions of terms, and at the very
least my point that this is not an ostensive definition of the truth
conditions of a statement (which really doesn't make much sense
anyways) still holds.  Was that what you were talking about when you
went off on that tangent about Wittgenstein and the depravity of
ostensive defintion without stage-setting?

-Also, I don't every remember saying anything like this: "without my
philosophy we can be out of touch with reality, lost in our own
minds."  I remember saying stuff like "with a coherence view of truth
we risk being cut-off from the world," but this is hardly a
contrapositive of what you attribute to (past) me here.

-And lastly, as regards instrumentalism vs realism, I get this debate,
and your point.  However, I disagree.  Scientists often ask this
question as regards specific posits: eg.  Is there an ether, or is it
just a useful fiction?  Asking this question is what lead us to
discover that it was just a useful fiction, a analogical modelling
assumption eft over from our study of waves in elastic media.
Furthermore, I believe that the answers to questions like these can be
found - or at the very least, I think these questions have real
answers, regardless of our (in)ability to pronounce on them
definitively.  Thus I think questions like "is this X really a
causally efficacious entity, or did we just make it up?" are useful
for scientists, and that this debate obviously has relevance for
scientific practice.  I agree, however, that asking the larger,
broader, more general and universal skeptical question of "are ANY
actually external objects, or did we just make them up" is useless for
scientists.  Science assumes an external world of independantly
existing objects - this is why instrumentalism of the logical
empiricist fashion that cites theoretical entities as useful fictions
is more of a reconstruction (which in some sense implies distortion)
of science than realism is.  Scientists do want to know if there are
entities in the world answering to our various concepts, and they want
to be wary of letting convenient fictions like ether and caloric into
their ontologies.  I think this is a better picture of scientific
practice than "I[t] need not matter to any scientist whether a
theoretical entity is really just a useful fiction or whether it is
really there independently of our study of it."

Anyways, I want to hear hecky talk about the stuff we can't talk
about.  Bring language to language through language and all that.  I
love it when he does that.  Seriously.

Furthermore, what constitutes a "philosophical view" about this world
issue in your opinion?  Just curious how you propose to demarkate
philosophy from psuedo-philosophy.

Must it be possible to decry it as metaphysics?  This is what is seems
like your demands for a "philosophical theses" are: unless it's
pragmatism or some kind of platonism that your arguments can defeat,
it must not be philosophical.  I mean, we all know Rorty has a raging
hard-on for killing philosophy.  What better way to kill philosophy
than to train minions that go out and attach metaphysical riders to
any proposed philosophical theories and then shout "metaphysics!",
thereby latching onto the rhetoric of "overcoming metaphysics" in
order to disuade anyone from accepting this theory for risk of
transgressing the anti-metaphysical status quo?  If this fails, the
default is "that's not philosophy."

If this is how it is, I will take the charge of triviality over the
vague "M!" just waiting to burst from your lips at any moment.  I
worry that you have been seduced by epic (yet mostly empty) pragmatist
rhetoric to see everything except Rorty-style pragmatism or
Heideggerian metaphysics as necessarily trivial, non-sensical, stupid
or metaphysical; to avow historical embeddedness while trying your
hardest to remove yourself from the discourse and give an ahistorical,
all encoumpassing theory of everything; and to patch up holes in your
criticisms of others by saying things like "isn't that just wrong?" or
falling back on another anti-platonism argument as soon as any says
the R-word.

Well, I think you should stop worrying about what grand and silly
things may have me seduced.  Just because you don't quite know what
I'm talking about doesnt mean that I don't know what I'm talking
about.  I think you know what you are talking about.  I either don't
get it, or just don't see how it enters into the problems I'm
concerned with.  I would never say you are battling imaginary
villians, because I don't think what I am doing is more on the side of
science, or more in communion with reality, than any other thoughtful
endeavor.

As comforting and intuitive as it might but, I must admit that I find
it a bit naive to think of other intelligent people as being caught up
in quixotical romantic swashbuckling with imaginary problems.
Philosophical problems can be conceived as legitimate or illusory
based on whatever unquestioned criteria have to make such a
distinction.  I think it is poor and problematic thinking to suppose
that some philosophical problems are "real" and part of the world
while others are "fake" and just confusions all inside our heads.
That sort of thinking sounds good to cartesians and realists.

I think we should just agree that we each think that one another would
benifit from reading different sorts of books for a while, and become
versed in the conversations and topics that one another find
interesting.  Because, (ironically enough), I think I am playing with
ideas on the metaphilosophical level, while you are sticking to the
practical, grounded, intelligble questions.  That's fine! but I think
it would be a mistake to think what I am doing is inane or self-
contradictory.  What I do surely isn't practical, its obtuse and
theoretical - questioning fundamental assumptions always is.

Realism vs Antirealism, is for me, a complicated and difficult topic
that I have never understood as having any concrete resolution.  I
have a hard time seeing it as something that isn't a hopelessly
intractable and conceptually confused topic - how else could it have
stuck around for so fucking long:  Analytic philosophers entered the
20th century talking about realism vs idealism, and they ended the
century continuing that topic.

Lamenting the way we assume that knowledge is about linking statements
up with facts of the matter, Wittgenstein said "we have been held
captive by a picture".  A certain self-understanding.  One that gets
us into alot of problems.  If you want to take that as alot of
grandoise froth and nonsense, be my guest.  My hunch is that he was on
to something that could transform what you and I take to be the common
sense understanding of knowledge as being the agreement between mind
and world.

The only way we might learn from one another - instead of talking past
one another - would be if we had a third party or mediating text to
evaluate.  Until then, I think I'm going to return to that
conversation I was having with myself.

why don't you guys do a paper exchange? seriously. curtis, find a
paper that you have written in vaguely this area and that you got an A
on (the A is there to show colin that at least SOMEONE understood what
you are saying, and thought that you said it really really well), like
maybe for Rueger's class last year, or the paper you wrote for Foss.
Colin, send Curtis your frickin honours thesis. Kahane thought it was
a tremendous piece of work, and he's a hardass. You are both
intelligent people. You are friends, and you like and respect each
other. Yet you BOTH agree that the other doesn't fully understand
their position, and I suspect that underneath your expressed feelings
you both think that the other's position is some what unintelligible,
or retarded, or whatever. seriously. exchange papers. I dare you.

Yeah, I should be clear here that, as the length of the exchange gets
longer, my underhanded philosophical gabs at Colin become less and
less underhanded.  I think I could graph it.  Anyways, I haven't
talked to colin in a few days on msn, so I just want to be clear that
I do find you very intelligent, in a way that is kind of burdening for
you.  So, I don't really think you are battling imaginary enemies: I
do think that you a) have a misconception of what modern realism is
(likely my fault for not being clearer about it) and thus that many of
your arrows miss their mark (or need not even be shot in the first
place), and b) fail to give actual scientific practice and results a
proper place in your conception of science.  So, if you want to know
what aspects of science I find important and what I take my position
to be these days, I'll do that now.

As regards a), I should say that Wittgenstein in particular helped
realists get over the traditional construal of the realism debate.
Wittgenstein's realization that capturing truth was more than mere
correspondence lead to the move away from the realism debate as a
debate over whether or not our terms refer.  I do not dispute that
truth is MORE than correspondence, but I do think that correspondece
is a necessary concept for any scientific theory, for formulating a
coherent theory of truth, and for our understanding of what a good
scientific theory is.  This may be for very banal reasons, such as
that a scientific theory cannot insist that I do not exist, etc., but
they are reasons nonetheless.

Influences like these, and criticisms like many that you make,
combined with the onslaught of quantum mechanics, General Relativity,
and further quantization of various macro-level field theories that
was the second (or third) revolution in physical science, changed the
realist.  The realist now recognizes not only the shifting nature of
science and its concepts, the inclusion of an observer as necessary in
any and all observations and even in many physical theories (the
Lorentz transformations and the uncertainty principle being good
examples), the theory-ladenness of observations, the existence of
Humean underdetermination (vs Quinean), the conventional nature of
observation statements, the need to set ceteris paribus conditions for
experimentation and testing, the need to look at how new scientific
terminology is developed and its relation to colloquial speech, and a
bevy of other things that turn of the century realism would not have
mentioned or even would have scoffed at.

While the debate may not have ended during the most tumultuous century
in human history, it has evolved significantly, mostly due to the
critiques of instrumentalists, constructivists, pragmatists,
empiricists, and naturalists, and hardly at all due to "anti-realist"
of the simple nay-sayer variety.  As I see it, the realist has been
left with a very parsed down form of realism - structural realism -
which is immune to many of these traditional critiques.  This position
has yet to be cogently put, but suffice it to say that realism is
retained by, in some sense, allowing that successful yet rejected
theories like Newtonian Mechanics captured a lot of the way things
are, and that they captured most of the relations between various
objects in our world that are not immediately present for us as we
think about them every day.  A good way to think of this is
ecologically, like how we don't realize that all these individual
things are related in such interesting and interconnected ways until
we draw it up in generalized, formalized terms like "evolution by
natural selection" along with some sort of basic cladistics or
nomenclature system.

This brings me to point b).  Scientists debate over whether particular
relations pertain all the time.  The may even debate, for instance,
whether mass is inertial or absolute.  This is, in effect, asking
whether mass has the relations attributed to it by Einstein or
Newton.  Scientists today will come down in favor of Einstein because
that is what they observe.  They go out and test things and realize
that Einstein's picture of the world has a higher rendering than
Newton's, that the relations that it posits between the various
objects of the world do - contrary to the expectations of our usual
language, intuitions, and expectations - pertain.

It is very interesting and counter-intuitive that when we hold the
speed of light constant in all frames of reference (a kind of fact
about the nature of observation) in our modelling of space-time in a
Minkowski-space (that is, four-dimensionally, adding a linear time-
dimension to traditional three-dimensional Euclidian space) we have to
use a Psuedo-Reimiann manifold (which adds a curvature to the
Minkowski-space) that is bent further by massive objects in order to
get results that cohere with our observations.  This means that
objects are related to each other in such a way that is extremely
contrary to all expectations.  We have done further tests to see if
all the consequences of Einstein's theory hold (stuff with bowling
balls in space, time-dialation, etc), and it does!  It's so counter
intuitive that Stanford is still working on another test of Relativity
to see if frame-dragging (an untested consequence of General
Relativity) holds (preliminary results, representing the lowest margin
of error obtainable by that date, to be made available March 23-24!
Go Stanford!).  Huge money and time went into this test, just as huge
money and time is put into all the work that gets done with particle
accelerators to test the standard model of quantum mechanics.  That
these radically counter-intuitive theories hold is the kind of stuff
that is not given to us by language or experience, but must be derived
from a process of scientific discovery which exposes our models to
risky tests to see what kinds of models can give us an accurate
picture of the relations between various kinds of objects.

I mean, don't you just think that its so fucking wierd that if you
send two planes with Atomic Clocks on board around the world in
opposite directions for a few hundred cycles, when they get back the
clocks will be off?  And not only that, but they will be off by pretty
much what Einstein's theory says they would be?  The only real
explanation I have for the fact that so many of these predictions came
true is that he paints a very good, very deep picture of our world,
one that went far beyond the evidence we had when it was formulated.

By the innovations of theoreticians like Lorentz, Maxwell and Einstein
we came up with such a good picture that we found out all these crazy
things about the way our world is before we ever even noticed them.
In fact, without this theory we probably never would have noticed
them, though they totally would have fucked with our data eventually,
and then we would have noticed them and then maybe formulated General
Relativity and accepted it only as the most tractable model.  If this
had been the case, if we had developed General Relativity in the same
way that we did Copernican Astronomy, only after we noticed frame
dragging, gravitational lensing, and time-dialation etc. like we had
noticed anomolies in mercury's orbit, the motions of the planet etc.,
I think the debate between constructivists and realists would be
undecidable.  However, since it went the other way around, since we
made the predictions and then found out all this wierd stuff was true,
I think realism wins.

There are in fact ways of restoring or renormalizing a Newtonian
framework (a non-psuedo-reimiann or non-curved geometry), but you
basically have to assume that measuring devices like rods shrink in
gravitational fields.  Either way, we need to account for these
extremely novel facts about the way the world is: we need to 'capture'
them, if you will, using abstract formal systems.  And, in fact, it
turns out that there are consequences of this Newtonian
renormalization that can themselves be tested against General
Relativity!  People are working to test these two theories (Newton +
shrinking rodsagainst each other as well, to see which gives us a
better picture (stuff about gravitational waves).

Now, to me, the ONLY way to explain why all these wierd things that
General Relativity predicts have come true is to say that he got it
right, in some sense - more right than Newton, who also had a lot
right, just not as much.  Obviously the positivists and inductivists
were wrong, because science is not built up upon induction from raw
sense-experience.  Einstein simply grasped the way that different
things in our universe are related to each other, captured it in a
formalized mathematical theory whose elements had the relations to
each other that captured the relations between the various concrete
things (light, objects, etc.) that they were symbols for (with my
personal proviso that this is only for things that we had previously
learned to quantitively measure with a formulatically representable
and physically realizable measuring apparatus - i.e. my boring ass
thesis).

Again, it is not the conventionality of the symbol to thing relation
that is most important to emphasize in the process of scientific
discovery (though it is important), but rather the fact that, once
these are chosen (i.e. if we chose to have only rigid rods that do not
shrink in a gravitational field) the symbols can only be arranged in
this extremely novel way.  Knowing that means that we know something
about how the world is, independant of our modelling assumptions.
This is because the need to account for these very odd facts is
something that remains invariant throughout our various possible
models,  if we are to get the right results from them.

I hope that makes some sense, and is a persuasive argument for a kind
of Einsteinian realist intuition and the idea that theory can (and
does) capture far more than what is given to us by our normal,
everyday language.  I also hope

Yeah I've very interested in (b) "giving actual scientific practice
and results a proper place in my conception of science", which is why
I've been reading people like Haack and Allen, who are both very
closely tied to the scientific worldview.  Rorty, whose views I
usually am paraphrasing, mostly sticks to broad rhetorical
brushstrokes.

However I'm also keen to subvert the ordinary inarticulate self-
conception of the scientist.  At the very least, because I wonder how
inconsistent it might be with what sort of things human beings are,
according to our modern Darwinian self-understanding.  I think there
are good reasons to challenge the implicit philosophical backdrop that
many scientists probably see themselves in, and replace it with
something - I hope - more scientific.  This is really what pragmatists
like Peirce and Dewey tried to acheive.  The difference being that
Peirce and Dewey tried to raise all other aspects of culture (art,
literature, ethics, etc) to the level of scientific practice, while
Rorty is more interested in leveling down science so that it is on the
same as art, literature, ethics, etc.  Both sides had something that
could loosely be called a "de-transcendentalizing" ambition, something
I think we should stick to.

I think we could push a darwinian self-understanding alot further than
the way we currently conceive of things, but I find it very difficult
and complicated to say which philosopher is a closet-cartesian and
which one is a true naturalist, and beyond a metaphysical self-
understanding of humanity.  I'm not sure who is right here, Taylor and
Heidegger, or Dennett and Rorty.

But notions like "correspondence relations" seem like such
metaphysical bug-bears for alot of reasons.  For correspondence - like
intentionality - are things that are necessary to posit if we have a
view of the universe as a dualism between mind and world - where
disembodied egos need a mediating force to connect to the world.  The
idea that our thoughts, beliefs, are out-of-sync with the world is as
absurd as the idea that our physical bodies are out of sync with the
room we are sitting in.  It's the sort of thinking that is only
possible for Dualists like Descartes. It seems to me that we should be
hopeful that (as much as we need these concepts), if
representationalism falls, then the rest (correspondence, reality,
mind vs world) should eventually follow.  Of course, I don't want to
do away with words like "truth" or "reality", I just think their
philosophical significance should change.

But to respond to what you're talking about Curtis - yes, thats all
well and good - but it doesn't really face the problems that vex me.
I think you and I can't communicate because it seems as if you want to
say that notions like "correspondence" and "world" are just super
common sense we can't do without.  Unfortunately, I should have said
right away "YES THEY ARE".  If we are going to sit in a labratory and
do observations, or walk in the park and talk about things, of course
we will talk in that way.  However, what I find problematic is the way
that Philosophers, scientific realists in particular, wish to say that
these notions are more than just how we talk about things - that they
are part of an essential structure that makes science possible.

I think your methodological and metaphilosophical commitments remain
hidden, which seems to be true in alot of analytic philosophy these
days.  I want to do my best to tease them out, but they are mostly
inarticulate, so we just end up with a sort of fist-thumping foot-
stamping bewilderment that we could ever analyse or attack such
fundamental basic terminology.  I think this is unfortunate and very
frusterating.  It's hard to critique someone's commitments if neither
he nor I know exactly what those commitments are.

&gt; Yeah, I should be clear here that, as the length of the exchange gets

&gt; talked to colin in a few days on msn, so I just want to be clear that
&gt; I do find you very intelligent, in a way that is kind of burdening for
&gt; you.  So, I don't really think you are battling imaginary enemies: I
&gt; do think that you a) have a misconception of what modern realism is
&gt; (likely my fault for not being clearer about it) and thus that many of
&gt; your arrows miss their mark (or need not even be shot in the first
&gt; place), and b) fail to give actual scientific practice and results a
&gt; proper place in your conception of science.  So, if you want to know
&gt; what aspects of science I find important and what I take my position
&gt; to be these days, I'll do that now.

&gt; As regards a), I should say that Wittgenstein in particular helped
&gt; realists get over the traditional construal of the realism debate.
&gt; Wittgenstein's realization that capturing truth was more than mere
&gt; correspondence lead to the move away from the realism debate as a
&gt; debate over whether or not our terms refer.  I do not dispute that
&gt; truth is MORE than correspondence, but I do think that correspondece
&gt; is a necessary concept for any scientific theory, for formulating a
&gt; coherent theory of truth, and for our understanding of what a good
&gt; scientific theory is.  This may be for very banal reasons, such as
&gt; that a scientific theory cannot insist that I do not exist, etc., but
&gt; they are reasons nonetheless.

&gt; Influences like these, and criticisms like many that you make,
&gt; combined with the onslaught of quantum mechanics, General Relativity,
&gt; and further quantization of various macro-level field theories that
&gt; was the second (or third) revolution in physical science, changed the
&gt; realist.  The realist now recognizes not only the shifting nature of
&gt; science and its concepts, the inclusion of an observer as necessary in
&gt; any and all observations and even in many physical theories (the
&gt; Lorentz transformations and the uncertainty principle being good
&gt; examples), the theory-ladenness of observations, the existence of
&gt; Humean underdetermination (vs Quinean), the conventional nature of
&gt; observation statements, the need to set ceteris paribus conditions for
&gt; experimentation and testing, the need to look at how new scientific
&gt; terminology is developed and its relation to colloquial speech, and a
&gt; bevy of other things that turn of the century realism would not have
&gt; mentioned or even would have scoffed at.

&gt; While the debate may not have ended during the most tumultuous century
&gt; in human history, it has evolved significantly, mostly due to the
&gt; critiques of instrumentalists, constructivists, pragmatists,
&gt; empiricists, and naturalists, and hardly at all due to &quot;anti-realist&quot;
&gt; of the simple nay-sayer variety.  As I see it, the realist has been
&gt; left with a very parsed down form of realism - structural realism -
&gt; which is immune to many of these traditional critiques.  This position
&gt; has yet to be cogently put, but suffice it to say that realism is
&gt; retained by, in some sense, allowing that successful yet rejected
&gt; theories like Newtonian Mechanics captured a lot of the way things
&gt; are, and that they captured most of the relations between various
&gt; objects in our world that are not immediately present for us as we
&gt; think about them every day.  A good way to think of this is
&gt; ecologically, like how we don't realize that all these individual
&gt; things are related in such interesting and interconnected ways until
&gt; we draw it up in generalized, formalized terms like &quot;evolution by
&gt; natural selection&quot; along with some sort of basic cladistics or
&gt; nomenclature system.

&gt; This brings me to point b).  Scientists debate over whether particular
&gt; relations pertain all the time.  The may even debate, for instance,
&gt; whether mass is inertial or absolute.  This is, in effect, asking
&gt; whether mass has the relations attributed to it by Einstein or
&gt; Newton.  Scientists today will come down in favor of Einstein because
&gt; that is what they observe.  They go out and test things and realize
&gt; that Einstein's picture of the world has a higher rendering than
&gt; Newton's, that the relations that it posits between the various
&gt; objects of the world do - contrary to the expectations of our usual
&gt; language, intuitions, and expectations - pertain.

&gt; It is very interesting and counter-intuitive that when we hold the
&gt; speed of light constant in all frames of reference (a kind of fact
&gt; about the nature of observation) in our modelling of space-time in a
&gt; Minkowski-space (that is, four-dimensionally, adding a linear time-
&gt; dimension to traditional three-dimensional Euclidian space) we have to
&gt; use a Psuedo-Reimiann manifold (which adds a curvature to the
&gt; Minkowski-space) that is bent further by massive objects in order to
&gt; get results that cohere with our observations.  This means that
&gt; objects are related to each other in such a way that is extremely
&gt; contrary to all expectations.  We have done further tests to see if
&gt; all the consequences of Einstein's theory hold (stuff with bowling
&gt; balls in space, time-dialation, etc), and it does!  It's so counter
&gt; intuitive that Stanford is still working on another test of Relativity
&gt; to see if frame-dragging (an untested consequence of General
&gt; Relativity) holds (preliminary results, representing the lowest margin
&gt; of error obtainable by that date, to be made available March 23-24!
&gt; Go Stanford!).  Huge money and time went into this test, just as huge
&gt; money and time is put into all the work that gets done with particle
&gt; accelerators to test the standard model of quantum mechanics.  That
&gt; these radically counter-intuitive theories hold is the kind of stuff
&gt; that is not given to us by language or experience, but must be derived
&gt; from a process of scientific discovery which exposes our models to

Honestly, I have no clue what four-dimensional time-space pseudo-
minkowski space means...  Can we just talk about philosophy?  I'm
interested in the philosophical commitments about reality that
philosophers have, and what sort of thing they think science is.  Talk
of whether Einstein or Newton had a superior, more coherent view about
mass isn't really philosophical.  What might be philosophical is how
or why Einstein's views ofter a truer or more objective account, and
what it means to say that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I mean, don't you just think that its so fucking wierd that if you

&gt; much what Einstein's theory says they would be?  The only real

&gt; one that went far beyond the evidence we had when it was formulated.

See, if you weren't a philosopher you could get away with saying
"paints a deep picture of our world".  A philosopher is supposed to
ask "what the heck do you mean by that"?  Why couldn't someone reply,
hypothetically, "what does having a good predictable model over a poor
predicatable model have to do with painting or deepness?"  I'm not
saying you are wrong, I'm just saying "why do we understand good
knowledge in this way", perhaps you like the illustration of talking
where the scientist unwraps a kind of God-like vision of the cosmos.
If you do, you will have a hard time being a philosopher without
getting alot of heat for not questioning such an uncritical attitude.
If you don't then what do you mean?

"undecidable.  However, since it went the other way around, since we
made the predictions and then found out all this wierd stuff was true,
I think realism wins.

If the social constructivist is saying "all science is made up" then
surely.  There are a number of foolish pomo constructivists who might
say something so naive.  But what you are telling me is that the
realism vs nonrealism debate isn't a debate.  Because if scientific
evidence, or historical example could prove the truth of Realism, it
wouldnt be a debate.  It would be consistent with scientific
evidence.  Except that Realism is a philosophical view, not a
scientific view.  I find it very confusing how you can constantly
conflate science and philosophy, and not notice the difference between
the two

For me, philosophy - metaphysics especially - is about different
systems or pictures of the world and ourselves that ALL MIGHT be true,
because they are unverifiable self-images, things that might be true
because they are consistent with any scientific evidence.  Don't you
agree?

I think that maybe what you do should be called "philoscience" or
better yet "Forbesophy".  Perhaps one day it could be its own
discipline.  Dare to dream my friend.

A theory is considered deeper than another if it describes and
predicts more accurately (or at least as accurately) more phenomena
using fewer general or universal principles.  And I wasn't harping on
any of these phil of science notions because all I care about is how
you understand a) this necessary invariance throughout our models and
b) these wierd facts that we have come to know.  How do you make sense
of this except in terms of the way the world is.

Not that you have answered my previous question about what your
criterion for a philosophical theory is, but to say "talk of whether
Einstein or Newton had a superior, more coherent view about mass isn't
really philosophical" is, I think, wrong.  Kuhn went on about this
shit for pages.  And my point was not that one is more coherent than
another, but rather that one allows us to represent the world properly
and the other doesn't, and that that is something in need of
explanation.  If, furthermore, "what might be philosophical is how or
why Einstein's views ofter a truer or more objective account, and what
it means to say that," then we had better understand Einstein's theory
enough to know why it is so counter-intuitive.  Undertanding what it
means for Einstein's view to offer a truer or more objective account
requires that we talk about what mass is for each of them, who had a
more coherent view about it, and whether or not there is some way to
make sense of then these two topics run together, and I think
philosophical status is a transitive property for discussions thusly
related.  For that matter, this is what gets talked about in phil of
sci, physics, and spacetime classes.  Are they simply not
philosophers?  Are you going to walk up to the chair members of the
Philosophy of Science Association and say "you guys aren't doing
philosophy, you should change your name to philoscience"?  Of course
you aren't, because this IS philosophy, specifically philosophy of
science.  I'm sorry that a prerequisite is some understanding of how
science operates and what specific scientific theories are, but that's
the way the cookie crumbles.

"I'm not saying you are wrong, I'm just saying "why do we understand
good knowledge in this way", perhaps you like the illustration of
talking where the scientist unwraps a kind of God-like vision of the
cosmos."

I think you would like me to have that view, for you have much to say
against it.  But as I have said, realism has moved on.  No view from
no-where.

"Except that Realism is a philosophical view, not a scientific view.
I find it very confusing how you can constantly conflate science and
philosophy, and not notice the difference between the two"

This is like saying that, in using case studies to make sure that your
models actually apply to modern political systems, or to demonstrate a
point about the systems you are talking about, I accused you of
conflating politics with philosophy and never even knowing it.  I
realize the difference, and I also realize that you don't know as much
science as I do, so I took the time to lay the science out there fo
that we could then talk about it, so that we can be assured that we
don't have an ahistorical view of science that is disengaged from real
scientific practice.  It appears that you didn't see this as my
intention, interpreting it rather as an attempt to cram science down
your throat and call it philosophy.  I suggest you re-read that post:
the philosophy comes in at the end, after the scientific history is
assumed to be mutually understood to some functional level.

"what you are telling me is that the realism vs nonrealism debate
isn't a debate"

Not at all.  I am just saying that the realist wins the debate for
these reasons.  Even philosophical views have to take account of
actual scientific history and practice: and I think the evidence of
how science operates supports realism, not constructivism.  If you
admit that your view does not at all need to account for actual
scientific history and practice, then you have gone mad - and your
view is likely to be wrong.

"For me, philosophy - metaphysics especially - is about different
systems or pictures of the world and ourselves that ALL MIGHT be true,
because they are unverifiable self-images, things that might be true
because they are consistent with any scientific evidence."

Realism and Constructivism each MIGHT be true, but I think that
realism is a BETTER picture because it is supported by the evidence I
have outlined above.  I'm not saying "realism is a scientific theory
that stands up to the test," I'm saying "the view of how science is
practiced and progress that we get from the realist's picture is more
consistent with actual scientific practice that what we get from the
constructivist's picture."  Science is the evidence (not scientifc
evidence): science itself, the body of practitiors, institutions, and
theories, etc.  Why is this an illegitimate argument?

"what I find problematic is the way that Philosophers, scientific
realists in particular, wish to say that these notions (correspondence
et al) are more than just how we talk about things - that they are
part of an essential structure that makes science possible."

Yes, I think talking about things in this way has made science
possible.  Without them, science wouldn't really be science (maybe it
would be philosophy, or theatre).  I think they are necessary, but I
am open to revising this belief if proven wrong.  I have never
actually had someone show me how science could be done without them,
but my world would not fall apart if they could (I don't think)  What
I am more interested in than anything else is how you explain the
necessary invariance throughout all various space-time models.  How do
you explain it?  I explain it by saying that all these theories are
capturing novel facts about our world that were hidden from us (or
unnoticed) until we had a formalized theory that predicted these wierd
facts.  You ... say nothing.

And reading Hackk and Barry Allen is not what I meant by giving actual
scientific practice and results a more central role - that would be
like if I said I was giving actual political practice and results a
more central role in my philosophy because I was reading Rorty and
Taylor.  Rather, the political analog of what I meant would be looking
at how courts function, laws are made now and have been in the past,
various case studies, etc.  Basically, I think you need to learn more
science (and re-read my post without too critical an ire).

So, in summation, I stood here, without my battle armour on, waiting
for one of your arrows to strike true.  I watched you fire some more
arrows at the realist camp.  Many of them flew radically off course,
landing in a previous battlefield.  Some of them tagged the bodies of
fallen realists, but all of them missed me and my clan by a mile.  I
have a feeling that this is because you still don't know where we are
standing.  There is a hill between us, a hill called science, and I
think you are going to have to climb that hill to see where I stand.
This is the only way that I think we can really hash out our
differences enough to stop shooting arrows blindly at each other.  I'm
sorry that my explication of Einstein was too technical.

Okay, I think i have a few good points here, so please read carefully!

# A theory is considered deeper than another if it describes and
# predicts more accurately (or at least as accurately) more phenomena
# using fewer general or universal principles.

So why add the extra non-scientific and unnecessary stuff with no
explanatory power into your philosophical views.  If you want to have
nonphilosophical metaphorical ways of thinking about what science
acheives, fine.  But you have to admit that if "painting a deeper
picture of the world" is simply shorthand for "a more consistent and
fruitful model of prediction and control of things" you no longer have
any beef with either (1) instrumentalists or (2) the pragmatists non-
realist and deflationary understanding of science.  So I don't think
you actually believe that this "deeper picture" stuff only really
means "works better".

# criterion for a philosophical theory is, but to say "talk of whether
# Einstein or Newton had a superior, more coherent view about mass
isn't
# really philosophical" is, I think, wrong.  Kuhn went on about this
# shit for pages.  And my point was not that one is more coherent than

Well Kuhn was mostly a historian.  But no, I don't want to have a
rigid definition of philosophy and nonphilosophy, so I can't really
explicate my confusion and suspicion about the non-relevance of some
of your points to what I consider to be the proper questions and
problems.

# sci, physics, and spacetime classes.  Are they simply not
# philosophers?  Are you going to walk up to the chair members of the
# Philosophy of Science Association and say "you guys aren't doing
# philosophy, you should change your name to philoscience"?  Of course
# you aren't, because this IS philosophy, specifically philosophy of
# science.

All the worse for what passes for philosophy these days :)

No seriously, I simply have a prejudice for what I see as the deeper
or more fundamental questions.  I actually wish I had more patience to
engage in what I consider to be "surface questions" or more rigorous
detailed analysis.  You are right to disagree here, I can't honestly
saying that what I am doing is more "philosophical" than you, without
some kind of fixed definition of what philosophy is.  Of course, I
have to recognize that the one question with the least consensus in
philosophy is the question "what is philosophy".  So yes, here all I
should have said was "I wish you were part of my phil o' science
conversation" not "thats not philosophy".

# your throat and call it philosophy.  I suggest you re-read that

# the philosophy comes in at the end, after the scientific history is

and
# theories, etc.  Why is this an illegitimate argument?

Okay, here I think you might run into trouble.  I think its viciously
circular to answer the question of which "competing interpretation of
science as a whole" is best, by saying that one of them fits better
with either (1) scientific date, evidence or (2) what you think
science is.  (2) is viciously circular, begging the quetsion:  The
whole debate is about how we ought to tell a story about what science
is, in relation to other human activies and other parts of culture.
You presuppose what you want to prove.  (1) is also circular because
you presuppose that we need to use certain philosophically loaded
terminology to understand such scientific evidence.  If you require
notions like "objectivity" "the world" "correspondence relations" to
describe scientific advances, then you aren't just talking conviently,
you are loading the interpretation of scientific data with the
vocabulary of the philosophical view you wish to champion.

Basically, I disagree that the realism vs idealism vs constructivism
vs instrumentalism debate in philosophy of science can be resolved at
all by consulting scientific data, because each philosophical view
offers a contrary way of interpreting such data.  Not only that - if
simple scientific theories were actually able to suggest something
about what philosophical interpretation of science was better, it
would cease to be a matter that philosophers would have to debate.  It
would be handed over to the scientists to decide, in the same way
philosophical questions about the mind were handed over to the
empirical discipline of psychology.  Right?

# "what I find problematic is the way that Philosophers, scientific

Wait, i didnt say "made science possible", I said "MAKES science
possible".  The ancient greeks and medeivals surely made science
possible, but that doesnt mean we any longer need to cling to their
way of understanding the meaning and nature of scientific inquiry.

# actually had someone show me how science could be done without them,

What

I don't think I'm going to be able to show you alternative ways of
conceiving what sort of thing science is.  You should read books by
people who want to challenge the status quo way of looking at what
science is.  Arthur Fine has a good book on Einstein.  You might
actually really enjoy it, even if you disagree (as most do) with his
philosophy.

Yes I do say nothing, I can't explain scientific events or theories
because I just am not a pro with the details, I'm a big grandoise
pictures kind of guy.  If I was born 100 years ago I'm sure I would be
a Humean or some sort of Hegelian Idealist, or fan of whatever
Philosophical villian was pissing absolutely everyone off at the
time.

Barry Allen, who was a student of Rorty, actually studies evolutionary
biology with a keen eye.  He is way more interested in practical
serious details of modern science than I probably will ever be.

You rightly share my zest for philosophy-warfare analogies.  It's
really not surprising, because I'm becoming pretty certain that
Rorty's rhetorical lambasting of the status quo smudges too many
details to be convincing enough to dissuade the enemy, especially in
matters of science.  I'm not saying that I disagree with him, just
that his way of talking about the matter probably isn't the best sort
of artillery I could have.

I think this is a great post. And usually I don't bother reading
Curtis's posts because they are way too long and usually confusing.
But this one was different. I think you really hit on something,
Curtis, and that is the analogy that you made between science and
politics, and phil of science and political philosophy. certainly
there are differences between the actual practices and the philosophy
surrounding them, but they are also necessarily entwined, and you
can't REALLY do the philosophy without having a really good
understanding of the practice. And I've been to enough talks outside
my area to know that. I think that the argument that you are having,
Colin, is not with Curtis. Because I agree with you a lot of the time
in things that you say about the world and shit, but I also really
agree with what Curtis is going on about here. I mean, I have
particular problems, but those problems come out of feminist and
social epistemology, not the realismantirealism debate.

how come no one ever accuses me of metaphysics? I mean, I'm in the
world in a way more real way than curtis is. I do politics. like who
cares if grass is green, I say that the law is REAL (and good), and
has REAL effects on REAL people in the REAL world that is full of REAL
institutions. bring it on!

&gt; criterion for a philosophical theory is, but to say &quot;talk of whether
&gt; Einstein or Newton had a superior, more coherent view about mass isn't
&gt; really philosophical&quot; is, I think, wrong.  Kuhn went on about this
&gt; shit for pages.  And my point was not that one is more coherent than
&gt; another, but rather that one allows us to represent the world properly
&gt; and the other doesn't, and that that is something in need of
&gt; explanation.  If, furthermore, &quot;what might be philosophical is how or
&gt; why Einstein's views ofter a truer or more objective account, and what
&gt; it means to say that,&quot; then we had better understand Einstein's theory
&gt; enough to know why it is so counter-intuitive.  Undertanding what it
&gt; means for Einstein's view to offer a truer or more objective account
&gt; requires that we talk about what mass is for each of them, who had a
&gt; more coherent view about it, and whether or not there is some way to
&gt; make sense of then these two topics run together, and I think
&gt; philosophical status is a transitive property for discussions thusly
&gt; related.  For that matter, this is what gets talked about in phil of
&gt; sci, physics, and spacetime classes.  Are they simply not
&gt; philosophers?  Are you going to walk up to the chair members of the
&gt; Philosophy of Science Association and say &quot;you guys aren't doing
&gt; philosophy, you should change your name to philoscience&quot;?  Of course
&gt; you aren't, because this IS philosophy, specifically philosophy of
&gt; science.  I'm sorry that a prerequisite is some understanding of how
&gt; science operates and what specific scientific theories are, but that's
&gt; the way the cookie crumbles.

&gt; &quot;I'm not saying you are wrong, I'm just saying &quot;why do we understand
&gt; good knowledge in this way&quot;, perhaps you like the illustration of
&gt; talking where the scientist unwraps a kind of God-like vision of the
&gt; cosmos.&quot;

&gt; I think you would like me to have that view, for you have much to say
&gt; against it.  But as I have said, realism has moved on.  No view from
&gt; no-where.

&gt; &quot;Except that Realism is a philosophical view, not a scientific view.
&gt; I find it very confusing how you can constantly conflate science and
&gt; philosophy, and not notice the difference between the two&quot;

&gt; This is like saying that, in using case studies to make sure that your
&gt; models actually apply to modern political systems, or to demonstrate a
&gt; point about the systems you are talking about, I accused you of
&gt; conflating politics with philosophy and never even knowing it.  I
&gt; realize the difference, and I also realize that you don't know as much
&gt; science as I do, so I took the time to lay the science out there fo
&gt; that we could then talk about it, so that we can be assured that we
&gt; don't have an ahistorical view of science that is disengaged from real
&gt; scientific practice.  It appears that you didn't see this as my
&gt; intention, interpreting it rather as an attempt to cram science down
&gt; your throat and call it philosophy.  I suggest you re-read that post:
&gt; the philosophy comes in at the end, after the scientific history is
&gt; assumed to be mutually understood to some functional level.

&gt; &quot;what you are telling me is that the realism vs nonrealism debate
&gt; isn't a debate&quot;

&gt; Not at all.  I am just saying that the realist wins the debate for
&gt; these reasons.  Even philosophical views have to take account of
&gt; actual scientific history and practice: and I think the evidence of
&gt; how science operates supports realism, not constructivism.  If you
&gt; admit that your view does not at all need to account for actual
&gt; scientific history and practice, then you have gone mad - and your
&gt; view is likely to be wrong.

&gt; &quot;For me, philosophy - metaphysics especially - is about different
&gt; systems or pictures of the world and ourselves that ALL MIGHT be true,
&gt; because they are unverifiable self-images, things that might be true
&gt; because they are consistent with any scientific evidence.&quot;

&gt; Realism and Constructivism each MIGHT be true, but I think that
&gt; realism is a BETTER picture because it is supported by the evidence I
&gt; have outlined above.  I'm not saying &quot;realism is a scientific theory
&gt; that stands up to the test,&quot; I'm saying &quot;the view of how science is
&gt; practiced and progress that we get from the realist's picture is more
&gt; consistent with actual scientific practice that what we get from the
&gt; constructivist's picture.&quot;  Science is the evidence (not scientifc
&gt; evidence): science itself, the body of practitiors, institutions, and
&gt; theories, etc.  Why is this an illegitimate argument?

&gt; &quot;what I find problematic is the way that Philosophers, scientific
&gt; realists in particular, wish to say that these notions (correspondence
&gt; et al) are more than just how we talk about things - that they are
&gt; part of an essential structure that makes science possible.&quot;

&gt; Yes, I think talking about things in this way has made science
&gt; possible.  Without them, science wouldn't really be science (maybe it
&gt; would be philosophy, or theatre).  I think they are necessary, but I
&gt; am open to revising this belief if proven wrong.  I have never
&gt; actually had someone show me how science could be done without them,
&gt; but my world would not fall apart if they could (I don't think)  What
&gt; I am more interested in than anything else is how you explain the
&gt; necessary invariance throughout all various space-time models.  How do
&gt; you explain it?  I explain it by saying that all these theories are
&gt; capturing novel facts about our world that were hidden from us (or
&gt; unnoticed) until we had a formalized theory that predicted these wierd
&gt; facts.  You ... say nothing.

&gt; And reading Hackk and Barry Allen is not what I meant by giving actual
&gt; scientific practice and results a more central role - that would be
&gt; like if I said I was giving actual political practice and results a
&gt; more central role in my philosophy because I was reading Rorty and
&gt; Taylor.  Rather, the political analog of what I meant would be looking
&gt; at how courts function, laws are made now and have been in the past,
&gt; various case studies, etc.  Basically, I think you need to learn more
&gt; science (and re-read my post without too critical an ire).

&gt; So, in summation, I stood here, without my battle armour on, waiting
&gt; for one of your arrows to strike true.  I watched you fire some more
&gt; arrows at the realist camp.  Many of them flew radically off course,
&gt; landing in a previous battlefield.  Some of them tagged the bodies of
&gt; fallen realists, but all of them missed me and my clan by a mile.  I
&gt; have a feeling that this is because you still don't know where we are
&gt; standing.  There is a hill between us, a hill called science, and I
&gt; think you are going to have to climb that hill to see where I stand.
&gt; This is the only way that I think we can really hash out our
&gt; differences enough to stop shooting arrows blindly at each other.  I'm
&gt; sorry that my explication of Einstein was too technical.

Okay there is too much here to address and I have neither the time nor
inclination to try.  So let me just make a few points.  Forbes I agree
with Colin that you tend to conflate the philosophical and scientific
questions, as I have told you many times.  This has nothing to do with
the importance of the details of certain theories.  It's just to say
that you can't appeal to them if you are speaking philosophically
because their meaning and status are part of what's at issue in this
discussion.  This kind of thing is probably more acceptable in phil of
science but we simply can't afford to make those preliminary unspoken
commitments here; we shouldn't lower ourselves to phil of science
moves just because that is how one side leans.

Second, how to distinguish philosophy from science.  Well, I would
suggest Zwicky's definition of philosophy as "thinking in love with
clarity".  This can be debated, obviously.  But I think it does a
pretty good job of characterizing philosophy while leaving the
definition of science as something more than a matter of methodology.
Science is more than a certain kind of thinking.  It prefers one kind
of thinking, i.e. rational systematic analysis, but it is also a
posteriori and it is committed to the aim for a single overall account
of everything meaningful.  Its aims are explicitly systematic and
totalitizing.  This is evidenced by Forbes' continued, yet unexamined,
insistence that we need an invariant theory that explains all data we
encounter (the principle of sufficient reason is outmoded).
Philosophy, on the other hand, need not be characterized in terms of
such aims.  Now those traditions of philosophy that are committed to
discovering truth would undoubtedly prefer that we do so characterize
philosophy, but the love of wisdom really has no inherent aim for such
truth.  This is why philosophy is a more reliable means of acquiring
wisdom than scientific thinking: philosophy only aims for clarity of
thought, not clarity of thought that everyone must be unable to deny.
The insistence that our theoretical wisdom must be invariant and
undeniable is an unjustified fascistic hope on your part, Forbs.

Third, a response to Pat's first post, because he raised an important
point.  I will have to disagree with your claim that believing in a
natural world isn't metaphysical, just physical.  What a physicist
means when he says that he studies the physical world is that he
studies nature.  I think we can all agree on that, correct?  Good.
But what nature means is explicitly metaphysical (explicitly in the
domain of philosophy, at least, but admittedly implicit in that of
science).  This is due to Spinoza, I would argue.  His identification
of God with nature both changed God from transcendent to immanent AND
injected this enhanced idea of nature with all the metaphysical force
of God (including all the same problems except transcendence).  A
single "natura" with two attributes (thought and extension) rather
than distinct substances avoids the problems of Cartesian dualism, but
it also replaces the theological divinity with a maximally generalized
metaphysical concept of nature.  Now obviously it took some time for
this to fully play out, but the point is that Spinoza was hugely
influential on the thinkers whom Kant simplistically classifies as
"rationalists" and "empiricists", especially Leibniz, Hobbes, Locke,
and even some of Newton's cohorts (in 1676 Leibniz made a special trip
to visit Spinoza in The Hague and stayed for at least a week,
discussing pretty much everything, even producing a proof of God which
Spinoza rejected.  Later in his life he wrote that "if not for the
monads, Spinoza would be right").  In Hume there is no question as to
the meaning of this concept of nature.  And it's pretty obvious that
the Darwin's idea of a "natural selection" clearly relies on this
concept.  (Darwin continued a lot of his grandfather's work, who along
with Schelling was very into Spinoza.)  Spinoza also had long-standing
correspondences with several prominent members of the British Royal
Society, all friends of Newton, and even though his views were too
radical in his own time to be publicly accepted, there is a great deal
of evidence that in private, he had the sympathetic ear of many
scholars and natural philosophers.  (And anyone who says Spinoza was
an atheist or a pantheist is simply wrong, so please no one try to
make those claims.)  The upshot here is that to the extent that what
we mean by "the physical world" is "nature", we also mean something
that was originally metaphysical.  Our own word "nature" still
expresses this ambiguity.  It can be used to talk about the essence of
a particular thing or it can be used to refer to the totality of
reality (now it's interesting whether this has the same meaning as
"universe", and whether the general meaning can include such things as
abstract entities, human meanings, etc.).  The metaphysical baggage of
the term "nature" is far more Aristotelian than Platonist, but the
baggage is there nonetheless.  And it persists in all these debates
about what it means for the world to "really" exist, including ours.

It would be beneficial if you could each post a short excerpt from an
author other than yourselves that you would say summarizes your
views.  If you can't find it online, maybe you can type it up.  The
idea is to find something that requires minimal qualification on your
part.  It would also be helpful if it could be something relatively
short (i.e. less than 4000 words).  This is more for the rest of us,
so that we have an idea just what kind of commitments you would stand
behind, but I think it would also be a good exercise for each of you
to find and post something you can stand behind as representative of
your own views.  Obviously it won't be complete or perfect, but I
imagine you each have something you can bring to the table that would
be pretty close.  This is basically what I wanted to do with my first
post in this thread, find some common ground to use as a toehold on
things.  But that clearly isn't working, so let's try an accessible
third-party articulation to hopefully clear things up and get us
going.  This discussion has been extremely long-winded but really not
very productive, wouldn't you agree?  Or if you guys simply want to
argue till your keyboards wear down that's fine too, but as
philosophers it seems like you might want to try and explore what
might count as a consensus between you (not that we ever need to
actually agree, just be clear about what an agreement might look
like).

Invariance goddammit!  What about the invariance!!!!!?????!!!!!  This
is a fact about science and our efforts to model our world that is in
need of a philosophical explanation.  This is not a non-problem, nor
is it simply not a "proper" problem, or a non-interesting problem.
Nor is it irrelevant to the debate that you insist on having (i.e.
"realism is bullshit, dead, wrong, misguided, science passed off as
philosophy, etc." - these are claims that you make, and I think that
the case of the shift from Newton to Einstein demonstrates that you
are wrong because realism is a very important thesis, one that has a
lot of good, philosophical things to say about cases like these, and
is by no means dead).  If you cannot even discourse about the history
of science in a way that would be considered by most to be a
philosophical analysis of the history of actual science, then what
kind of historicism are you practicing?

To put it simply, why are there limits put on the kinds of models we
can use to predict things about our world?  My answer - because these
models represent the world, and the limits placed on our models are a
result of the world being a certain way.

Ok, that last one was to Colin, as most of these posts are.  I had not
seen Hecky's response.  What I mean by invariance is not what you,
Hecky, take me to mean.  This was my point in saying:

"There are in fact ways of restoring or renormalizing a Newtonian
framework (a non-psuedo-reimiann or non-curved geometry), but you
basically have to assume that measuring devices like rods shrink in
gravitational fields.  Either way, we need to account for these
extremely novel facts about the way the world is: we need to 'capture'
them, if you will, using abstract formal systems."

By this I mean to say that, given particular measuring and modelling
practices, there is still a further restriction on our theories -
getting the right results.  In order to get the right results we have
to account for all kinds of novel facts in our models about how our
measurements actually come back.  This puts a huge restriction on our
possible models, and thus any theory of space-time we devise must
embody these very counter-intuitive features of our world.  That is to
say, the need to account for or capture these novel facts in theory is
INVARIANT throughout any and all models of space and time so long as
we want them to give us the right results.  This is the invariance
that I speak of, that which needs to be accounted for by any
philosophy of science.  Invariance is not the aim of science, but
rather the result of it, embodying the knowledge that we have captured
about the world.

As for an account of it, using the case study of General Relativity
and taken together with the fact that these novel occurences were
PREDICTED by General Relativity before they were ever observed, I gave
that account in my post as:

"Now, to me, the ONLY way to explain why all these wierd things that
General Relativity predicts have come true is to say that he got it
right, in some sense - more right than Newton, who also had a lot
right, just not as much.  Obviously the positivists and inductivists
were wrong, because science is not built up upon induction from raw
sense-experience.  Einstein simply grasped the way that different
things in our universe are related to each other, captured it in a
formalized mathematical theory whose elements had the relations to
each other that captured the relations between the various concrete
things (light, objects with detectable mass, etc.) that they were
arbitrary symbols for (with my personal proviso that this is only for
things that we had previously learned to quantitively measure with a
form[ally] representable and physically realizable measuring apparatus
- i.e. my boring ass thesis)."

I would add that this does not tell us the definitive nature (whatever
that is) of measurable quantities like mass, only how they are related
to other things that are represented in the formalism.  This is a
structural interpretation of a particular case in scientific history.
I see that it involves science, but I don't think it is by any means
passing science off as philosophy or conflating the two.  It is
difficult to have a conversation at this level in this group because I
feel like I have to explain the science and the history first so that
we can talk about it, which may come off as me explicating my
position, which in fact I try to leave until after I have detailed the
history of, in this case, the Einsteinian Revolution and the counter-
intuitive picture that General Relativity paints of our world.  I am
not saying something like "this all just comes down to a debate about
whether time and space are absolute or relativistic, and since the
scientific community has come down in favor of Einstein. so should we
as philosophers".  As I tried to point out with all that stuff about
invariance, we can restore an absolute framework like Newton's and get
the right results: but we have to assume that rods shrink in
gravitational fields.  There are in fact many other frameworks that
could give us the right results.  What I want to understand is this
invariance among plausible models: I think it is best understood as
capturing facts about our reality, specifically representing real
relations between objects and their measurable properties in our
world.  This is how I account for invariance: only those theories that
invariantly account for these phenomena in their models will capture
the relations that actually hold between the things they are about
(eg. objects in space and time).  How do you account for invariance
(Hecky or Colin)?

You're right Hector. A subtle and nuanced understanding of Spinoza's
immanentization of transcendence and turn from foundation to
factuality deeply informs both the language and the practice of
experimental physics. It's so important that I just figured no one had
brought it up before because we all took it for granted.

When you say "science is an explanation of NATURE" anyone can counter
with "science is an explanation of the world". You might say that BOTH
of these are "metaphysical" concepts, but if they are, then there
really is no outside. You can talk all you want about shared practices
and modes of representation or whatever, but all you're doing is
replacing one term in the metaphysical structure with another, making
that new term function in metaphysics. Might be easier to concede that
they're just physical. The fact of the matter is that science DOES
deal with what's observable (or, perhaps, "physical") and the big
debates are over whether observing effects counts as observing an
entity. Practicing scientists say "yes".

You guys agree that quarks and other non-observable (in the sense of
"visible to the naked eye, or microscope, or whatever") are real. So,
as far as I see it, the problem that you and Colin have is that you
equate realism with reductive realism. Which I suppose you can do. But
that's a view only stupid philosophers have. Certainly, neither
Einstein nor Stephen Hawking nor Newton would subscribe to it. It's
implicit in your claim that we only have knowledge about the world of
physics, because physics gives its own world a structure. But, again,
the counter-claim is that physics - along with any other domain of
specialized knowledge - does not talk about it's own world (and
neither do golf or mathematics or whatever) but rather they all
describe THE world; the only way of proving that they do not talk
about the same world would be to prove that there is some deep and
unavoidable contradiction between the descriptions given in one
discourse and another. Moreover, this contradiction would have to be
accepted and uncontroversial (yes, there are contradictions between
quantum mechanics and relativity theory, but that's why lots and lots
of people are working on a) reconciling them or b) rejecting one or c)
reworking our conception of the world). Sure, Heidegger does think
that science is domain-relative, based on a pre-scientific
understanding of the objects of that science, but given Heidegger's
near-conflation of Being and language/meaning as elements of "the
Same" there is no reason to think that these aren't just different
descriptions or ontological renderings of the same stuff.

Ok, I'm sorta confused.  Clarifying question: I equate realism with
reductive realism?  or colin does?  Or we both do?  (This is why
German is so much more precise)  If it is the middle one that you
mean, I tend to agree, but I'm totally into non-reductive non-
supervenient realisms like Cartwright's.  My use of space-time physics
as an example is only because it is familiar and easily viewed
structurally, not because I take physical scientific facts to be the
only objective ones.  I am definitely not on board with reductionism,
nor with considering it to be a necessity for realism.

On this note, Pat, what's your paper for that phil of science
conference on?  I'm extremely curious.  Perhaps you need some
preliminary comments...

Sorry Curtis, the "you" in "you and Colin" was Hectorious. I know
you're not down with reductive realism; from what I understand of your
structural realist programme, it is (or could be) radically non-
reductive.

The 100+ post was about the end of metaphysics. This one is about
realism. Slight difference. I think I'm actually on board with Colin
about alot of stuff regarding that (though with important
differences).

In this case, though, I don't understand. You're talking past each
other. Colin accuses you of granting physics some special privilege
over other discourses, which you are not. Other discourses may relate
to the world in very much the same way. What I don't understand is how
anybody can consistently grant you "Yes, quarks are real, scientists
do investigate how the world works" but then says "nevertheless,
despite the fact that physics deals with real stuff, you must never
EVER say that it describes the real word". I would say that the burden
of proof is on them to explain how these two positions can coherently
hang together.

Oh, and the paper is sort of bi-partite. The first half is a non-
standard interpretation of Leibniz's "shift arguments" and his
rejection of absolute space. The second half takes the spirit of the
first, and develops relationalist position that can (I hope) deal with
some of the more sophisticated versions of space-time substantivalism.

The Relationalist-Substantivalist debate is one of the only phil of
physics I am familiar with.  Suffice it to say that I come down on the
same side as you, as I take the structuralist construal of space-time
theories to basically be a relationalist one (though realist
nonetheless).  I mean, the Bucket argument?  Come on...

I'm glad you all have so much faith that we can develop this ludicrous
discussion through sarcasm and insinuations of stupidity.  That'll
work real well.  (Hey that WAS easy...)

I have no problems conceding that we observe the effects of physical
entities.  The problem I have is this unnecessary move you both
(Forbes and Pat) make to then say that there is one true world, THE
world that everyone is describing from a variety of different
discourses.  What is it about accepting that we observe effects that
thereby commits us to there being "entities in the one single world"?
You guys constantly assume that simply because this overarching world
is a necessary explanatory commitment, that therefore it is
philosophically justified.  But why is the view that has more
explanatory power (plainly a great deal more) more likely the correct
view?  I want you to spell this out for me as painfully clearly as you
can make it, because it has nothing more than practical advantage for
the philosopher who is not concerned, as the scientist is, with the
fullest possible explanation.  This is where I think that Forbes
conflates philosophy and science.  (Some philosophers do have this
concern, but nothing about philosophy commits them to it; it's adopted
on grounds that are not clear to me.)  And I find his usual responses
to this question uncharacteristically pragmatic.  The only way it
could make more than practical sense is if you already assume that
explaining things in a systematic way is somehow inherently preferable
to accounts that do not aspire to such totality.  So tell me how this
assumption is justified, and it would be nice for you guys to use your
serious voices to do so.

&gt; of people are working on a) reconciling them or b) rejecting one or c)
&gt; reworking our conception of the world). Sure, Heidegger does think
&gt; that science is domain-relative, based on a pre-scientific
&gt; understanding of the objects of that science, but given Heidegger's
&gt; near-conflation of Being and language/meaning as elements of &quot;the
&gt; Same&quot; there is no reason to think that these aren't just different
&gt; descriptions or ontological renderings of the same stuff.

I think this quote from Rosen sums up our discussion very nicely.

"We sense that there is a heady metaphysical thesis at stake in these
debates over realism-a question on a par with the issues Kant first
raised about the status of nature. But after a point, when every
attempt to say just what the issue is has come up empty, we have no
real choice but to conclude that despite all the wonderful, suggestive
imagery, there is ultimately nothing in the neighborhood to
discuss" (1994: 279).

Unless someone can say why there is a significant issue to discuss
here and what that issue is, I propose that we all just become
quietists and leave it at that.

Hector, don't you come down on Colin's side? Can you legitimately
criticize the philosopher of science who uses pragmatic reasoning to
arrive at different conclusions than the so-called pragmatist?

I guess the point is that we're not saying there's "one true world".
We're just saying there's "one world". No adjectival modifications.
Curtis is a structural realist, so he can actually be slippery on the
"observable effects = real entities" inference. One claim would be
that it is completely unfair to deny to scientists the inferences that
everybody else makes, i.e. that observable effects are caused by real
entities, leaving it open as to what these entities are.

Furthermore, we both come down on Rosen's side. There is not much at
stake at in the debate. We just want to say that the stuff scientists
work with is real (not REALLY real, not THE MOST REAL, etc), just as
real as everything else that's real, without commiting the (ancient,
yet unforgivable) sin of privileging physics over other discourses.

I disagree.  I think there is a very serious matter at hand here, a
very deep and decisive question.  My various suggestions might have
been misleading and fruitless.  If you read this post carefully, you
will understand why this realism crap isn't superficial, but perhaps
the only topic of political and moral consequence. To start off, let
me quote something from the Book of Rorts:

"Antirepresentationalists need to insist that "determinacy" is not in
question here - that neither does thought determine reality nor (in
the sense intended by the realist) does reality determine thought.
More precisely, it is no truer that "atoms are the way they are
because we use 'atom' as we do" than that "we use 'atom' as we do
because atoms are as they are".  BOTH of these claims, the
antirepresentationalist says, are entirely empty.  Both are
pseudoexplanations."

Here I think Rorty is focused with the implicit commitment realists
and antirrealists (both qua representationalists) have to the idea
that there is something implicitly "extra-worldly" (which analytic
philosophy has repeatedly failed to give a "worldly" explanation) -
something called "thought", "experience", or "language".  Something
that mediates and links the interactions between humans and their
environment.  Rorty is pursuing a Wittgensteinian and Darwinian
rejection of the more-or-less Cartesian world-picture - that dualism
between mind and world that begets realism/idealism.  What I would
hope can rightly be called "metaphysics" in the sense that Nietzsche
and Heidegger said "Platonism is Metaphysics" and Whitehead said "All
philosophy is footnotes on Plato".  That is, we are still under the
sway of a certain form of Thinking, one that originates with the basic
distinctions constructed by an influential handful of ancient greeks.

Metaphysics had a beginning.  It has an outside.  It is optional.  If
it were truly unavoidable, it would be just as true to say "there will
always be metaphysics" as it is true to say "there never was
metaphysics".  If metaphysics cannot be distinguished from what it is
not, you are going to have a hard time explaining what exactly it is.
If you (like me) think that metaphysics is a sort of thinking that had
a beginning, then you will concede that it has conceivable end, or
outside.  If you don't want to use the term "metaphysics" because you
don't buy my definition, then instead we should say "Platonism" or
"Western metaphysics" or "Western worlview".

So I have good reasons to be suspicious of sitting by and accepting
(in the name of "common sense") realism.  Consider how the seeming
comfortable sensibleness of a realist understanding of things
contrasts with its actual explanatory vapidity:

"It is not enough for [Realists] to explain the success of technology
based on belief in elementary particles by the existence of elementary
particles... this sort of explanation is trivial. All it does is to
say that we describe our successful actions as we do because we hold
the theories we hold.  Such an explanation of current success is as
vacuous as our ancestors' explanation of past sucessess (why are we
able to predict eclipses so well? because Ptolem'y Almagest is an
accurate representation of the heavens.  Why is islam is
spectacularily successful?  Because of the will of allah.  Why is a
third of the world now communist?  Because history really is the
history of class struggle)."

Here Rorty suggests that saying "atomic physics works because atoms
are really there as they are" isn't so much TRUE or FALSE as it is
simply, empty.  It is equivilent to saying "opium puts people to sleep
because of its dormative power".

So if realism isn't so much wrong as empty, why do I challenge it?
The point of arguing against the realist understanding isn't to unveil
the actual way we are - that would be a traditional platonic view we
are trying to move away from.  Rather, antirepresentationalist has -
at bottom - huge political significance that I may not be able to
adequately elaborate on right here and now.  The hope is to move the
history of the west towards a more thoroughly disenchanted,
naturalistic, detranscendentalized, Darwinian self-understanding.  One
where the enlightment "Truth" and "Reason" are no longer the
authoritarian replacement for "God".  A world where there is no
nonhuman authority, and truely anti-authoritarian world is what we
hope to cultivate.  A democratic one where we have no duty to such
nonhuman transcendental authorities, but only duty to one another.

For the pragtmatist, philosophical theories are political instruments,
not neutral inquiries about "nature of things".  The purpose of
overcoming metaphysics and dissolving realism/antirealism, is to
cultivate a western self-understanding that is anti-authoritarian and
democratic on a truly unprecedented scale.

Perhaps it sounds a bit far fetched, but yes this is Rorty's entire
philosophy in a nutshell.  It's about cultuvating a
"postphilosophical" or "literary" culture.  It's very grandiose and
romantic, but also modest; a self-admitted long shot from a hopeful
thinker who is pessimistic about the state of the world these days,
and the power of traditional philosophy to acheive justice.  Emptying
ourselves from the idea that there is a universal authority not-
ourselves is the goal.  All this talk of overcoming realism and
metaphysics is important, because it is for the sake of the
possibility future justice and democracy.  I myself currently see no
other route to such a radically anti-authoritarian utopia, except
through the cultivation of this post-philosophical culture.

Forbes reply, I predict, would be that valourizing scientific practice
is the best solution we have to our political dillemas.  I totally
agree.  However, I simply disagree that scientific realism is the
appropriate way to valourize science.  I think what is admirable and
special about science isnt its power, or its special ability to
aproximate the way things are in themselves - rather what is admirable
about science is its democratic spirit - its ability to converse
openly, critically, and rationally.

Soldarity in human conversation and cooperation around mutual aims and
ends is what makes science so very special.  If politics could raise
itself to this level of science, the world might be a truly wonderful
place.  If political discourse was anything like scientific discourse,
in this spirit, we might not need to be pessimists about the way human
civilization might turn out.  This view is not anti-science.  It is
pro-science and anti-authoritarian.

So think about what it means to desire Solidarity and not
Objectivity.  Sometimes I think Rorty is more communitarian than
communitarians.

Sorry fot the length of the post.  If you want to know why I think the
realism debate is far from pointless, please focus on the last 4 or 5
paragraphs.  In a nutshell I am saying that - if you read Rorty as
thoroughly as I do - you will see that anti-representationalism and
"overcoming metaphysics" is about cultivating a thouroughly secular,
darwinian, instrumental culture.  This culture would be
antiauthoritarian in a way unlike anything that has existed before,
and the hope is that such a culture could cooperate, politically, with
the degree of cooperation and mutual understanding that is typical of
scientific communities.

The sort of cooperation and solidarity typical of scientific
communities is what Dewey hoped to reproduce in all areas of culture,
including politics.  Rorty's polemic against metaphysics and realism
is truly in that spirit.  So any charges of Rorty's work undermining
science or being anti-science should be reconsidered.  As I said, it
is pro-science but anti-authoritarian.  The scientific model of human
cooperation and duty to one another is what we hope to have replace
the older, un-Darwinian, authoritarian, realist conception of science
as a metaphysically priviledged discipline.

Thanks for taking the time to make your views clear Colin.  I think
this will help to shape the discussion much more productively.  The
only thing that strikes me as odd is how a philosophical culture that
embraces a Darwinian self-understanding could then go to work on such
questions as "what can we make of ourselves?"  Because this kind of
question is not really Darwinian.  The idea that we can take control
of our own development by cultivating certain cultural elements is
Darwinian only from a sort of meta-social perspective (in that we can
see what cultivations get favoured and perhaps even discern patterns
of cultivation to reinforce these same efforts).  But nothing can
control development in this sense of control, including ourselves who
live in the absence of favourability-inducing conditions (biologically
and perhaps socially speaking).  Even our selection of the kinds of
conditions on whose control we focus our efforts is dictated by this
idea of Darwin's.  The most successful society will simply be the most
prolific rather than the strongest or most democratic.  So either what
you call Darwinism is simply the last remaining vestige of authority
in this otherwise persuasive account, or you are referring to some
other aspect of Darwinism, or these kinds of "what can we make of
ourselves" questions wouldn't need to be given any special status in
this emerging post-philosophical world.  If it's the latter, then to
call this view "pragmatic" isn't entirely accurate because pragmatic
questions are not necessarily privileged by its adherents.  I'm not
sure what to make of this idea that a Darwinian self-understanding
would lead us to think we can re-shape ourselves however we see fit,
because Darwinism pretty much rules out this kind of control (which
is, let's face it, a teleological ideal).

Well, you ought to question this fuzzy notion of "Darwinian" here.
I'm afraid I can't explain it all too clearly yet.  I would have to
begin by saying that this view I am championing seems commited to
behaviorism and disengaged agency.  I think Dennett's views on
religion as a "virus" in terms of being a cultural meme is exactly the
sort of Darwinian self-interpretation I speak of.  This is indeed the
idea of taking up a "meta-social perspective" is exactly the weird
consequence of a radically 3rd person approach to human affairs - it
makes people like Dennett talk about human beings from an abstract
detatched 3rd person point of view, as if he weren't actually part of
the human race but looking down from a non-human point of view.  These
sort of disengaged thinkers approach human affairs as if they were a
martian inspecting a foreign species of linguistic monkey.  This
approach to me seems more fruitful than Taylor wants to admit, and I
think Taylor ought to be able to agree with Rorty that such a
Darwinian interpretation of humanity isn't any authoritative or
essentialist "last word" on the human condition, but rather a fruitful
self-interpretation when it comes to applying evolutionary biology to
human social-political problems...

I am working on a Rorty vs. Taylor paper right now, and the developing
question seems to be this:  Can Rorty carry disengaged agency to such
a radical extreme that it avoids the pitfalls that Taylor critiques?
Can Rorty truly (as he says) "take the reductivism curse off
naturalism" through a holistic and antifoundational framework?  If
Rorty's naturalism evades the problems Taylor finds with naturalistic
theories in general, I might end up with a serious critique of
Taylor's philosophy of engaged agency.

Maybe I missed your point.  I am concerned with problems of disengaged
agency right now, so I'm not sure if I just read that into your post.
Your point about taking a detatched meta-social 3rd person perspetive
on ourselves seems to be a sort of charge of radical disengagement.
My reply to that is that it is still unclear whether or not we should
bite the bullet.  Whether or not it is possible to have a sort of
"liberating naturalism" (in Taylor's words) is, for me, still up in
the air.

My guess is that by the end of this term I will be forced to come down
on either Rorty or Taylor really hard, be forced to pick sides on the
matter.

Also, it might be helpful to look at Dan Dennett's lecture's on
religion on YouTube.  That kind of disengaged darwinian approach is
something I think Rorty is commited to, without being a reductivist
like traditional naturalists.

Fair enough, I suppose. Despite my love for math and science, I don't
agree with Curtis if he does actually hold that there are political
ramifications to scientific realism. But neither do I agree with Colin
that Rorty is providing any sort of consistent political project.

Radical democracy isn't any less anti-authoritarian than anything
else, insofar as it is forced to make an appeal to something - namely,
"our duty to each other" - which, if said appeal is disputed or
rejected, must be enforced by authoritarian means. Accepting THAT
means accepting finitude. I haven't read it yet, but Ernesto Laclau
has an essay on Rorty's liberal utopia that I would like to look at;
he basically agrees with Rorty about a bunch of stuff, but has a
different idea of what the post-philosophical democracy will look
like. I'm curious.

But I'm still a little bit confused - the anti-representationalist
doesn't think that we can explain anything? We can't say that "forces"
cause "acceleration" but rather simply say that's how our theory
works? Then why have a theory? Just because you are embedded in a
world doesn't mean that you CAN'T represent things; even if our
primary mode of thought is non-representational (which it is) that
still doesn't preclude representation. The debate about the nature of
mind and of perception does not immediately translate into the debate
about scientific realism.

If you deny explanation, you also deny description, and you become
trapped in the solipsistic world of language, actually reinforcing the
dualism that you are attempting to end. We are finite beings who are
in the world, true, and thus we cannot describe or explain EVERYTHING,
but nevertheless you still can describe some things about the world in
which you, as a finite being, are.

Hector, I'm sorry about the whole "tone" thing. I was just trying to
adopt Rorty's mode of discourse, wherein irony and rhetoric are no
longer unjustly dominated by reason and logic.

I can understand your skepticism - I have offered mostly rhetoric with
little qualitative examples or evidence.  There is indeed content to
these assertions about anti-authoritarianism.  Rorty has recently
finished an essay "Pragmatism as Anti-Authoritarianism" which I have
been painstakingly tried to track down.  So far no luck, but it would
provide some pretty focused background into this part of Rorty's
philosophy.

Sounds intersting.  Rorty's liberal utopia - at least the one
presented in Contingeny, Irony, Solidarity - suffers from tremendous
tensions and problems.  It was his first experiment with a serious
grounding of his previous work in a political project.  His later work
patches up a few problems, but there are still numerous complications.

Okay here I think you quite misunderstand.  It isn't that we cant
explain anything.  It's that the particular dominant "philosophies" of
science - realist and anti-realist - add no explanatory content to
scientific theories.  Anti-representationalism isn't trying to change
anything that is true of causal relations, but it is trying to
undercut mediational epistemology, the idea that there are
nonlingusitic "facts" that make sentences true, that sort of stuff.
It would be incorrect to say that antirepresentationalists are trying
to change any causal relations that already hold - rather, they wish
to deflate the specific non-casual rubric of representationalism and
the way this representational understanding interprets science as
either realist or relativist.

# If you deny explanation, you also deny description, and you become
# trapped in the solipsistic world of language, actually reinforcing
the

# which you, as a finite being, are.

Not denying explanation here - denying that nonscientific elements
that philosophers add to science have explanatory power.  It is widely
held that the idea of "truth" itself has no explanatory power.  For
instance, to assert "it is true that p" or "p is true" is the same as
just asserting "p".   Metaphysical realism does not help science out
by providing explanations, it simply provides a (superficially)
comfortable and intuitive manner of interpreting what sort of
enterprise science is, what role science plays in the cosmic order of
things.

About solipsism, let me quote Donald Davidson:

"Beliefs are true or false, but they represent nothing.  It is good to
be rid of representations, and with them the correspondence theory of
truth, for it is thinking that there are representations that
engenders thoughts of relativism."

Solipsism is the boogeyman of those still thrashing under the
collapsed circus tent of enlightenment metaphysics.  If you are a
cartesian, and believe that our minds mediate or relation to the
external world, and that we could be "out of phase" with reality, then
solipsism is a problem.

If you are not a representationalist, then the very notion that our
beliefs, language, throughts or minds could be "out of touch" or "out
of phase" with reality makes aobut as much sense as the suggestion
that our bodies could be out of phase with environment you live in.
It just no longer makes any damn sense.

Ok, so for some reason every time I post a message it doesn't get
recorded, and I have to repost it right after.  I posted right after
Hecky posted a while back, as regards all of his "accepting the world
is an unnecessary move" business, and forgot to double check.  So, my
reply was not posted.  This is basically what I had to say, if we can
back up for a minute,

As regards this gem: "The problem I have is this unnecessary move you
both (Forbes and Pat) make to then say that there is one true world"
and this one too "You guys constantly assume that simply because this
overarching world is a necessary explanatory commitment, that
therefore it is philosophically justified," I have but one question.

***What IS "philosophically" justified?***

If, as you seem to imply, beliefs that are philosophically justified
are only those that are necessary, things that we MUST accept, then
NOTHING is philosophically justified, not even your belief that
realism is wrong, that your own utterances have meaning, and that
Heidegger is on to something.  None of these are necessary moves, and
it seems that you would then want to disavow either their
meaningfulness or their correctness (or even likely correctness).  If
this is the case, if you take "philosophically justified" to be a
property of only necessary beliefs, and that only beliefs having this
property are in fact belief-worthy, then there are no belief-worthy
beliefs, and you my friend are a skeptic.

So, Hecky, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to explain
to us all whatever it is that you take "philsophically" justified to
mean.  If you should choose to provide us with such a definition, be
sure to include an explanation of how it is that your beliefs fall
under this definition as "philosophically" justified and my world-
based beliefs do not.  If your criterion is simply that they are
necessary beliefs, that only "necessary" moves are "philosophically"
justified, then it is obvious that none of our beliefs are
"philosophically" justified, including yours.

I simply do not understand why we must valorize "philosophical"
reasoning and methods of justification, whatever those are, over and
above the kinds of reasoning everyone else uses (scientific and/or
everyday reasoning).  I make no apologies for being a naturalist (nor
does colin), and I do not want to metaphysically privaledge scientific
posits and reasoning (as I am often accused of) nor do I want to
valorize "philosophical" theories and reasoning (as Hecky apparently
does).  I do not even want to distinguish them, necessarily, or at
least not exclude one to valorize another.  Why shouldn't all of our
intellectual tools be available to us at any time?  Isn't this what
Naturalism is really all about?

I am also unclear as to how we can observe the effects of entities
without assuming that these entities exist independant of us in a
world that we all inhabit and experience.  What is the alternative
here, Hecky?  That we have many worlds?  Do we all have different
tokens of these entities in our worlds then, that we all talk about
similarly or differently?  How come I can see you, and you me then?
Am I in your world AND you in mine?  How is identity retained
throughout these worlds then?  Is the "Forbes" in your world the same
thing as the "I" in my world?  For that matter, how can we communicate
if we are all in different worlds?  If you take you and me to be in
the same world, then who is not in our world?

Basically, I want to know why you have this aversion to accepting that
we all inhabit a single world, one that we all exist in and
experience.  Why I ask you, why!?!  Just because it is ultimately an
unnecessary belief?  Well, get ready to abandon ALL your beliefs,
then, if this is your sole criterion for belief-worthiness, for
NOTHING is a necessary belief in this ultimate sense.

I agree with the spirit of your post Forbes.  I think you are right to
be suspicious and snide about those who suffer from "cartesian
anxiety"  - the (often fashionably french) notion that we either know
something with absolute certainty or we absolutely know nothing at all
and must suffer total relativism.

It would be a mistake to construe what I am trying to say as something
so radically skeptic, something that sets the bar imaginably high for
what can count as justified.  I understand how I can come across as
suffering from a textbook case of cartesian anxiety, but that would
only be a failure of clarity or inconsistency on my part.

It is reasonable to ask deflationary minimalists like me "why be so
minimalist and deflationary?"  The answer can only be that I suggest
an alternative idea of the way things hang together, in the loosest
sense of the term.

If you want to destroy or deconstruct something, you have to have some
purpose other than pure intellectual charlatanism.  You have to (a)
propose a manner of rebuilding, or (b) join Heidegger and have an
implicit aim at retreving something essential and forgotten through
destruction.  I think there is an interesting intellectual debate
going on between those continentalish people who go for (a) and those
who go for (b).  I think (a) is the way to go.

Curtis, I can't follow you into naturalism-land, unfortunately.

Colin, you want to do away with "the facts" and yet maintain
"explanation". Could you please tell me what, then, you propose to
explain?

Well, if you agree that a "fact" is a belief, then what science or
philosophy explains is beliefs.  That seems common sense to me.

There are widely held beliefs about the downward acceleration of free
objects, which leads us the handy explaination of things in terms of a
gravitational pull
There are less widely held, but firmly held beliefs, such as the idea
that jesus was god yet was a mortal who died on the cross, which leads
us to explainations such beliefs in terms of the theological idea of
"dying for our sins".

There is nothing particularily scientific about explanations or
facts.  I would suppose that "fact" is another way of saying "belief
that i am firm about".  There don't actually have to be ontological
entities making up the world called facts for us to explain beliefs.

Beliefs are often in tension, or connected in an inarticulate manner.
Explanations connect beliefs, make them more consistent, provide
reasons for holding beliefs, that sort of thing.

"well, if I agree that facts are beliefs..." Um... I think that's a
very controversial position. Facts, I believe, are actually what are
often opposed to the belief.

For example, it's a fact that I'm typing on a computer right now.
That's not a belief. If you want to say that's a belief, you end up
back in representationalist mode, affixing an unspoken "I believe..."
to every indexical, demonstrative, or assertive proposition.

Besides, beliefs are entities too. Wouldn't it be more "deflational"
to excise beliefs where we can? What is advantageous about thinking
only beliefs (rather than beliefs and facts) make up the world.

Think about it this way. There are 2 options: a) beliefs are about
stuff (but don't necessarily represent stuff) or b) beliefs are not
about stuff.
If a) then...
Explaining beliefs would entail giving a causal explanation of these
beliefs, which means sacrificing the objectivity of science to
psychological or sociological explanation PLUS giving a (much less
objective) explanation of whatever it is that the belief is about. You
don't get to discard scientific explanation, you just sacrifice any
objectivity, and have to explain twice as much. Which is even
trickier, because who is to say that scientific methods, tweaked and
adjusted for "the human sciences," actually have any explanatory power
in this mysterious 2nd domain.

If b) then...
You can't explain anything. Historically, explanations have been given
about the stuff that our beliefs were about. Turns out we weren't
explaining anything, because beliefs aren't about anything. So, again,
we weren't explaining anything. So, at least currently, we have no way
of explaining anything (because we never have done so), and it would
be the height of hubris to assume that the ways that we THOUGHT we
were explaining stuff (which we weren't) can be unproblematically used
to explain beliefs.

It just doesn't make any sense.

It is not that science explains nothing, it is that science explains
plenty, but adding this philosophical talk about "facts of the matter"
contributes nothing that we didn't already ahve before.  Thats what is
minimalistic and deflationary here.

Maybe this is stating things a bit too strong but I think that it
isn't that science isnt objective, because I don't think the
traditional philosophers idea of realism + objectivity is coherent
anymore, given - among other things - the scientitic worldview.

I do not require that you attach "i believe that..." to everything you
assert, because that would often be redundant, and sometimes be
misleading in situations where you are not stating or asserting.  And
no, I am not saying that science cannot explain anything.  I'm saying
that science+realism doesnt explain anything that science by itself
cant do just fine on its own.

Beliefs are about stuff, they must have content.  A belief without
content is not a belief, as far as I can imagine.  Yet beliefs do not
need causal physiological explanation if you understand what analytic
philosophy of mind and language means by "belief" - something we might
attribute to an organism based on behavior, or linguistic behavior.  A
dog might run inside and I could attribute, roughly, that it has the
belief that "it is raining" or some such thing.  I wouldn't be
attributing "it has a belief" in the same logical space as I might
attribute "it has a paw".  That would be a conceptual confusion.
Likewise, my friend might tell me "i think its raining outside", and I
would attribute to that person the appropriate belief.

I would not wish to invoke "beliefs" as some extra-worldly
psychological entity.  That would just be silly.

This is not easy for me to explain well, because its all textbook
analytic philosophy stuff - naturalism and Quine in particular - stuff
that I am rusty on and I usually take it for granted that everyone
knows what I am talking about when it comes to mainstream analytic
philosophy.

See, and this is where we keep talking past each other. There is no
"philosophical addition" of "facts of the matter". Scientists talk
about the "facts of the matter". Science is about the facts of the
matter. We're not philosophically adding anything; it's not that
"science + realism = better." There's no plus sign. Science IS
realist; we're not adding anything, so much as just making explicit
what science does.  The anti-realists are the one's who try to say
that science and scientists are mistaken about what they're doing. The
realist says "no they're not". Again, I don't see why anyone who
confesses that philosophy doesn't add anything would challenge the
realist. It's the anti-realist who takes the transcendental line.

I seriously don't understand your position at all. I'm not saying this
to be bitchy, but I can't seem to find a claim that you have made that
you haven't retracted. Which is fine, I do it all the time (I later
plan to retract all my realist contributions) but it still makes it
hard to follow.
