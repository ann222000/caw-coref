Still waiting for the Stratman to be eliminated. . . .
--------------------------------------------------------
_Cargo Cult Science_ by Richard Feynman
From a Caltech commencement address given in 1974

&lt;&lt;During the Middle Ages there were all kinds of crazy ideas, such as that a
piece of of rhinoceros horn would increase potency. Then a method was
discovered for separating the ideas--which was to try one to see if it
worked, and if it didn't work, to eliminate it. This method became
organized, of course, into science. And it developed very well, so that we
are now in the scientific age. It is such a scientific age, in fact, that we
have difficulty in understanding how witch doctors could ever have existed,
when nothing that they proposed ever really worked--or very little of it
did.

But even today I meet lots of people who sooner or later get me into a
conversation about UFO's, or astrology, or some form of mysticism, expanded
consciousness, new types of awareness, ESP, and so forth. And I've concluded
that it's not a scientific world.

I looked into extrasensory perception, and PSI phenomena, and the latest
craze there was Uri Geller, a man who is supposed to be able to bend keys by
rubbing them with his finger. So I went to his hotel room, on his
invitation, to see a demonstration of both mindreading and bending keys. He
didn't do any mindreading that succeeded; nobody can read my mind, I guess.
And my boy held a key and Geller rubbed it, and nothing happened. Then he
told us it works better under water, and so you can picture all of us
standing in the bathroom with the water turned on and the key under it, and
him rubbing the key with his finger. Nothing happened. So I was unable to
investigate that phenomenon.

But then I began to think, what else is there that we believe? (And I
thought then about the witch doctors, and how easy it would have been to
check on them by noticing that nothing really worked.) So I found things
that even more people believe, such as that we have some knowledge of how to
educate. There are big schools of reading methods and mathematics methods,
and so forth, but if you notice, you'll see the reading scores keep going
down--or hardly going up--in spite of the fact that we continually use these
same people to improve the methods. There's a witch doctor remedy that
doesn't work. It ought to be looked into; how do they know that their method
should work? Another example is how to treat criminals. We obviously have
made no progress--lots of theory, but no progress--in decreasing the amount
of crime by the method that we use to handle criminals.

Yet these things are said to be scientific. We study them. And I think
ordinary people with commonsense ideas are intimidated by this
pseudoscience. A teacher who has some good idea of how to teach her children
to read is forced by the school system to do it some other way--or is even
fooled by the school system into thinking that her method is not necessarily
a good one. Or a parent of bad boys, after disciplining them in one way or
another, feels guilty for the rest of her life because she didn't do &quot;the
right thing,&quot; according to the experts.

So we really ought to look into theories that don't work, and science that
isn't science.

I think the educational and psychological studies I mentioned are examples
of what I would like to call cargo cult science. In the South Seas there is
a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes with lots of good
materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So they've arranged
to make things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to
make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head to
headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas--he's the
controller--and they wait for the airplanes to land. They're doing
everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked
before. But it doesn't work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo
cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of
scientific investigation, but they're missing something essential, because
the planes don't land.

Now it behooves me, of course, to tell you what they're missing. But it
would be just about as difficult to explain to the South Sea islanders how
they have to arrange things so that they get some wealth in their system. It
is not something simple like telling them how to improve the shapes of the
earphones. But there is one feature I notice that is generally missing in
cargo cult science. That is the idea that we all hope you have learned in
studying science in school--we never say explicitly what this is, but just
hope that you catch on by all the examples of scientific investigation. It
is interesting, therefore, to bring it out now and speak of it explicitly.
It's a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that
corresponds to a kind of utter honesty--a kind of leaning over backwards.
For example, if you're doing an experiment, you should report everything
that you think might make it invalid--not only what you think is right about
it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you
thought of that you've eliminated by some other experiment, and how they
worked--to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.

Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you
know them. You must do the best you can--if you know anything at all wrong,
or possibly wrong--to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and
advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that
disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it. There is also a more
subtle problem. When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an
elaborate theory, you want to make sure, when explaining what it fits, that
those things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea for the
theory; but that the finished theory makes something else come out right, in
addition.

In summary, the idea is to give all of the information to help others to
judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to
judgement in one particular direction or another.

The easiest way to explain this idea is to contrast it, for example, with
advertising. Last night I heard that Wesson oil doesn't soak through food.
Well, that's true. It's not dishonest; but the thing I'm talking about is
not just a matter of not being dishonest; it's a matter of scientific
integrity, which is another level. The fact that should be added to that
advertising statement is that no oils soak through food, if operated at a
certain temperature. If operated at another temperature, they all
will--including Wesson oil. So it's the implication which has been conveyed,
not the fact, which is true, and the difference is what we have to deal
with.

We've learned from experience that the truth will come out. Other
experimenters will repeat your experiment and find out whether you were
wrong or right. Nature's phenomena will agree or they'll disagree with your
theory. And, although you may gain some temporary fame and excitement, you
will not gain a good reputation as a scientist if you haven't tried to be
very careful in this kind of work. And it's this type of integrity, this
kind of care not to fool yourself, that is missing to a large extent in much
of the research in cargo cult science.

A great deal of their difficulty is, of course, the difficulty of the
subject and the inapplicability of the scientific method to the subject.
Nevertheless, it should be remarked that this is not the only difficulty.
That's why the planes don't land--but they don't land.

We have learned a lot from experience about how to handle some of the ways
we fool ourselves. One example: Millikan measured the charge on an electron
by an experiment with falling oil drops, and got an answer which we now know
not to be quite right. It's a little bit off because he had the incorrect
value for the viscosity of air. It's interesting to look at the history of
measurements of the charge of an electron, after Millikan. If you plot them
as a function of time, you find that one is a little bit bigger than
Millikan's, and the next one's a little bit bigger than that, and the next
one's a little bit bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a
number which is higher.

Why didn't they discover the new number was higher right away? It's a thing
that scientists are ashamed of--this history--because it's apparent that
people did things like this: When they got a number that was too high above
Millikan's, they thought something must be wrong--and they would look for
and find a reason why something might be wrong. When they got a number close
to Millikan's value they didn't look so hard. And so they eliminated the
numbers that were too far off, and did other things like that. We've learned
those tricks nowadays, and now we don't have that kind of a disease.

But this long history of learning how to not fool ourselves--of having utter
scientific integrity--is, I'm sorry to say, something that we haven't
specifically included in any particular course that I know of. We just hope
you've caught on by osmosis

The first principle is that you must not fool yourself--and you are the
easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After
you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just
have to be honest in a conventional way after that.

I would like to add something that's not essential to the science, but
something I kind of believe, which is that you should not fool the layman
when you're talking as a scientist. I am not trying to tell you what to do
about cheating on your wife, or fooling your girlfriend, or something like
that, when you're not trying to be a scientist, but just trying to be an
ordinary human being. We'll leave those problems up to you ...

May you have that freedom.&gt;&gt; -- Richard Feynman
--------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;For Feynman, a cargo-cult science is one that has all the trappings of
science-the illusion of objectivity, the appearance of careful study, and
the motions of an experiment-but lacks one important ingredient: skepticism,
or a leaning over backward to see if one might be mistaken. The essence
of science is to doubt your own interpretations and theories
so that you may improve upon them.&gt;&gt; -- Anthony R. Pratkanis

&gt; _Cargo Cult Science_ by Richard Feynman

This is good Art. Feynman's writing isn't up to the standard
of William James or Stephan Jay Gould--Gould is such a great
philosopher of evidence I think he'll find a place beside James--
but we definitely need more of this kind of analysis in HLAS.

It reminds me, however, of my question to Stephanie which was
'where's the evidence of Oxford's authorship?'

Stephanie replied 'we're still looking.'

Oxfordians have prepared the runway with studies on the
Nashe and Harvey quarrel and Lady Bedford's soiree but
until Oxfordians find the authorship evidence they're
'still looking for' they'll remain an authorship-faction-in-waiting.

Marlovians are presently in another thread compiling lists of
novels about Marlowe. Marlovians have piles of novels
to line the runway but Marlovians are never going to get an
evidence drop because there's nothing out there to connect
Marlowe to the Shakespeare works.

So Feynmann's piece is a fit analogy except for the
fact that the Baconian and Shakespearean tribes don't need to
entice the Evidence Gods.

Two authors have evidence of Shakespeare authorship
and their respective bodies of evidence are perfectly congruent.

Bacon the author has manuscripts and the indispensible
Strachey letter along with tons and tons of circumstantial
evidence.

Too many cargoes were dropped on too few natives and they
haven't finished uncrating and sorting it all and of course
other tribes rushed in, grabbed some cargo and threw it down
the well behind the Jaggard's house in Stratford or buried
in uncatalogued in the basement of the Folger.

Shakespeare the batillus and mask has printed title pages to
the works for which Bacon has direct evidence of authorship.

The rest is just sorting out attestations by witnesses
meant for Bacon and those that were meant for the mask.

In the meantime the natives in the Oxfordian and Marlovian
tribes keep doing their ritual novelizing and biographizing
but the planes that bring authorship evidence are never going
to come.

Best regards,

Elizabeth

&gt; to make things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to
&gt; make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head
&gt; to headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas--he's the
&gt; controller--and they wait for the airplanes to land. They're doing
&gt; everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked
&gt; before. But it doesn't work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo
&gt; cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of
&gt; scientific investigation, but they're missing something essential,
&gt; because the planes don't land.

&gt; Now it behooves me, of course, to tell you what they're missing. But it
&gt; would be just about as difficult to explain to the South Sea islanders how
&gt; they have to arrange things so that they get some wealth in their system. It
&gt; is not something simple like telling them how to improve the shapes of the
&gt; earphones. But there is one feature I notice that is generally missing in
&gt; cargo cult science. That is the idea that we all hope you have learned in
&gt; studying science in school--we never say explicitly what this is, but just
&gt; hope that you catch on by all the examples of scientific investigation. It
&gt; is interesting, therefore, to bring it out now and speak of it explicitly.
&gt; It's a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that
&gt; corresponds to a kind of utter honesty--a kind of leaning over backwards.
&gt; For example, if you're doing an experiment, you should report everything
&gt; that you think might make it invalid--not only what you think is right about
&gt; it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you
&gt; thought of that you've eliminated by some other experiment, and how they
&gt; worked--to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.

&gt; Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you
&gt; know them. You must do the best you can--if you know anything at all wrong,
&gt; or possibly wrong--to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and
&gt; advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that
&gt; disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it. There is also a more
&gt; subtle problem. When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an
&gt; elaborate theory, you want to make sure, when explaining what it fits, that
&gt; those things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea for the
&gt; theory; but that the finished theory makes something else come out right,
&gt; in addition.

&gt; In summary, the idea is to give all of the information to help others
&gt; to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information
&gt; that leads to judgement in one particular direction or another.

&gt; We've learned from experience that the truth will come out. Other
&gt; experimenters will repeat your experiment and find out whether you were
&gt; wrong or right. Nature's phenomena will agree or they'll disagree with your
&gt; theory. And, although you may gain some temporary fame and excitement,
&gt; you will not gain a good reputation as a scientist if you haven't tried to
&gt; be very careful in this kind of work. And it's this type of integrity, this
&gt; kind of care not to fool yourself, that is missing to a large extent
&gt; in much of the research in cargo cult science.

&gt; A great deal of their difficulty is, of course, the difficulty of the
&gt; subject and the inapplicability of the scientific method to the subject.
&gt; Nevertheless, it should be remarked that this is not the only difficulty.
&gt; That's why the planes don't land--but they don't land.

&gt; The first principle is that you must not fool yourself--and you are the
&gt; easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After
&gt; you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just
&gt; have to be honest in a conventional way after that.

&gt; So I have just one wish for you--the good luck to be somewhere
&gt; where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described,
&gt; and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position
&gt; in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity.
&gt; May you have that freedom.&gt;&gt; -- Richard Feynman
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------
&gt; http://www.csicop.org/si/9204/subliminal-persuasion.html

&gt;&lt;&lt;For Feynman, a cargo-cult science is one that has all the trappings of
&gt; science-the illusion of objectivity, the appearance of careful study, and
&gt; the motions of an experiment-but lacks one important ingredient: skepticism,
&gt; or a leaning over backward to see if one might be mistaken. The essence
&gt; of science is to doubt your own interpretations and theories
&gt; so that you may improve upon them.&gt;&gt; -- Anthony R. Pratkanis

An interesting article, Art. Thanks for posting it.

One point worth dwelling on is:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In summary, the idea is to give all of the information to help others to
&gt;judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to
&gt;judgement in one particular direction or another.

"/>

I had something like this in mind in a post I made awhile back. It
really bothers me when anti-Stratfordians, while discussing Shakespeare's
education, simply say: &quot;There is no record that Shakespeare went to the
Stratford grammar school.&quot;, and say no more.

Reading this, someone unfamiliar with the subject could easily think:
&quot;Gee, someone has gone through all the records for the school for this period,
and Shakespeare's name isn't there. That's really odd.&quot;

Which, of course, would be wrong. Once it is known that *all* the
records for this period no longer exist, the conclusion one might draw from
these facts is considerably modified. It is very possible that Shakespeare went
to the grammar school. So the fact that all the records for this time are
missing should be mentioned every time this subject is brought up.

Again, a very good article. Thanks for posting it.

Apparently they didn't teach penmanship at that grammar school.

Note that Feynman doesn't have a very high opinion of the way most hard
science is done (in practice) much less what goes on in other forms of
scholarship. I doubt he would be impressed by literary historians.

My interests involve

Other Oxfordians point out:

3) Contemporary references as an important poet &amp; dramatist.

Trying to survey the Stratford records mystery, I can list a few
suspects.

1. Deliberate calumny.
a. Shakespeare's enemies pilfered and planted evidence,
followed by the pilfering and planting of anti-enemies.
b. Catholics and Protestants have abstracted the records
for safe-keeping.
2. The records were there, all right, but have been worn to a
fine dust by time and repeated handling by devotees of the bard.
3. There have been shortages of paper in Stratford from time to
time, so all handy scraps have been used up.
a. Cooks are suspects for using papers to line and cover
pies.
b. Relatives, especially wives, are wont to collect the
letters and documents belonging to the deceased and burn them.
Susanna developed a complex about all the demands on her about
her father and feigned ignorance, removed evidence.
c. They didn't have many substitutes for toilet paper in
Stratford 400 years ago.
4. There have been natural disasters that account for the loss
of records.
a. Fires.
b. Floods and water damage.
c. Wars and bomb blasts.
5. Children playing with matches, floating boats, sailing kites,
drawing pictures, making archery targets.
6. Dogs, birds, and cats who carry off a paper scrap.
7. Tourists, callow locals, and fellow travelers who use bits of
Shakespeareana as book-markers.
8. Sheer accident, as when a box of old papers is left out in
the rain, the wrong item is discarded, something in a pocket goes
through the wash, etc..
9. Mice, book worms, mold.
10. Ignorance, as when an inheritance includes materials of
unrecognized importance.
11. Shakespeare, himself, erased all records of his existence.

No, we'd expect things like his name and address on the title-pages of various
books instead of just his name (and, once, his picture), and reports of people
saying things during his lifetime like, &quot;I was talking to Will Shakespeare of
Stratford-upon-Avon the other day about the play he wrote called Hamlet and he
said Hamlet was based on his brother-in-law.&quot; The problem is that we would
expect this even if he had been a front, since if some hoaxsters wanted to make
him seem an author when he wasn't enough to send a lawyer to keep him and his
family and friend from giving away the game, add interlineations to his will,
and put up a monument to him, it doesn't make too much sense that they would not
also have faked letters about him that were more conclusive. Why didn't they,
Paul? That old schizspirational desire to make sure everyone thought
Shakespeare was the True Author while simultanesouly trying to make sure NO ONE
did?

David is simple stating a fact Art, there is such a consensus. The issue
seems to be what value it has? Does it perhaps exclude more than it
includes?

A director of a New England theatre returned from UK last night, and was so
fired up he had to come around 'and talk with someone'. He had been to the
Olivier and marvelled at the very complex multi-level revolving stage, he
had been to Bristol and the Old Vic, to Birmingham, and to Stratford.

&gt;&quot;David L. Webb&quot;&lt;david.l.w ... @dartmouth.edu&gt; wrote

&gt;&gt; Which particular works? For starters, Francis Meres ascribed a list

&gt;&gt; and at least one presumably does not survive).
&gt;&quot;Meres&quot; places Oxford as the numbero UNO writer of comedy;

Since Meres makes explicit mention of both men, the conclusion seems
virtually inescapable that he did not think that Oxford was Shakespeare.

&quot;As the soule of Euphorbus was thought to live in Pythagoras: so the

Shakespeare, witnes his Venus and Adonis, his Lucrece, his sugred
Sonnets among his private frinds, &amp;c.

&quot;As Plautus and Seneca are accounted the best for Comedy and Tragedy
among the Latines: so Shakespeare among y' English is the most
excellent in both kinds for the stage; for Comedy, witnes his
Ge'tleme' of Verona, his Errors,

[Actually, had Meres been aware of *your* errors, Art, then he might
have softened this encomium somewhat.]

his Love labors lost, his Love labours wonne, his Midsummer night
dreame, &amp; his Merchant of Venice: for Tragedy his Richard the 2.
Richard the 3. Henry the 4. King John, Titus Andronicus and his
Romeo and Juliet.&quot;

&quot;As Epius Stolo said, that the Muses would speake with Plautus

speak with Shakespeares fine filed phrase, if they would speake
English.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Of course, the First

&gt;&gt; Shakespeare as the author, and I would take that as evidence as well,
&gt;&gt; even if certain of the plays had appeared anonymously or were not
&gt;&gt; published in quarto. Naturally, some plays may be collaborations
&gt;&gt; involving several authorial hands.
&gt; Of course, the First Folio, was paid for by two REAL PEOPLE,

It is exceedingly tiresome correcting Elizabeth's revisionist

participant who evidently cannot use Google (i.e., Elizabeth), here is
the discussion in its entirety, with just a few phrases snipped to
eliminate redundancy. I apologize for its length, but one's patience is
rewarded in the end, as Elizabeth's posts just keep getting funnier as
the discussion proceeds. I begin with Elizabeth's post quoting
Stephanie's paragraph above:

Elizabeth's rejoinder to Stephanie:

&quot;&gt; Not a bit, Jim. I have been reading source materials widely for
&gt; more than
&gt; 10 years, have made a couple of discoveries at the Folger Library,

&quot;Why don't you share those discoveries with us, Stephanie? The reason
Oxfordians get no respect in HLAS is that Oxfordians keep talking
about evidence but they never show us any evidence.

&quot;&gt; have
&gt; purchased microfilms of very rare materias from the British
&gt; Library, and so
&gt; on.

&quot;What did you find? Be specific.

&quot;&gt; What have you done to investigate and support your beliefs?

&quot;Legitimate scholars have no 'beliefs.' They have hypotheses.

&quot;&gt; Paul is
&gt; working with someone in England, apparently, transcribing
&gt; little-known
&gt; manuscripts.

&quot;Since Bacon has an authenticated manuscript page of 'Henry IV' and 50
pages of notes for the Shakespeare plays in his own handwriting I
would not bother 'transcribing little-known manuscripts.' And yes,
I've put the links up. I wish Webb would pay attention.

[There is just no pleasing Elizabeth -- elsewhere she conveys the
impression that any attention I may pay to her posts is most unwelcome.]

&quot;&gt; We are, and have been, actively LOOKING,

&quot;That, Stephanie, is the first thing you have said that rings true.
I don't doubt you're 'looking' and probably with some sense of urgency
because the Oxfodians have been making extravagant claims for 80 years
and they still have *nothing.*

&quot;Sooner or later a Strat will write a popular book on the Oxfordian
Hoax.

&quot;&gt; and we have been finding.

&quot;Finding what? I notice you didn't finish that sentence.

&quot;&gt; Our efforts, along with those of many other researchers,

&quot;I don't call myself a 'researcher' even though I did a year of
research methodology. 'Researcher' usually implies someone with
an advanced degree.

&quot;Do you mean 'researcher' as in the Ogburns were 'researchers?'

&quot;The Ogburns weren't 'researchers.'

&quot;The Ogburns were caught--this has been written about--

[By *whom*? Note Elizabeth's customary, scrupulous precision in citing
sources: &quot;this has been written about....&quot;]

&quot;stealing from
Baconians. I noticed that they baldly quote Edwin Reed without noting
that he was Bacon's biographer.

[Why should they have noted that, exactly?]

&quot;The Ogburns were identity theives [sic]. They stole Baconian
research, scratched out Bacon's name and wrote 'My Lord Oxford'
underneath.

[Note here Elizabeth's habitual presumption that others are not merely
wrong, but engaged in *intentional* intellectual dishonesty: plagiarism,
fraud, suppression of evidence, theft, etc.]

&quot;Do you know what that means Stephanie?

&quot;That means the Ogburns ***knew*** that what they had was evidence of
Bacon's authorship.

[Note here Elizabeth's habitual presumption that others are not merely
wrong, but engaged in *intentional* intellectual dishonesty: plagiarism,
fraud, suppression of evidence, theft, etc.]

&quot;&gt; working
&gt; mostly on their own, are producing new evidence.

&quot;Right. In the back room with Photo Shop.&quot;

[Note here Elizabeth's habitual presumption that others are not merely
wrong, but engaged in *intentional* intellectual dishonesty: plagiarism,
fraud, suppression of evidence, theft etc.]

&quot;&gt; We are not trampling the
&gt; dusty roads to Stratford,

&quot;Hey, that's my line.

&quot;&gt;and we are not looking in Silver Street in the old
&gt; Wigmaker's cellar.

&quot;What would Oxford be doing in the Wigmaker's celler on Silver Street?

&quot;Best not to ask..

&quot;&gt; What have you been doing lately, except jibing
&gt; pointlessly at our efforts?

&quot;Who's jibing? What's jibing?

[As we have seen on numerous occasions, a normal English vocabulary is
not among Elizabeth's many charms.]

&quot;Are y'awl a Southern lady?

[Huh?!]

&quot;Produce the evidence Stephanie and we'll all become Oxfordians.&quot;
--------------------------

Stephanie's followup:

&quot;&gt;&gt;....... I have been reading source materials widely for
&gt;&gt; more than
&gt;&gt; 10 years, have made a couple of discoveries at the Folger
&gt;&gt; Library,

&quot;&gt; Why don't you share those discoveries with us, Stephanie? Th
&gt; reason
&gt; Oxfordians get no respect in HLAS is that Oxfordians keep talking
&gt; about evidence but they never show us any evidence.

&quot;We get respect. We get dawged by a pack of boring flak-meisters,
but they do no damage.

&quot;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt; purchased microfilms of very rare materias from the British
&gt;&gt; Library, and so
&gt;&gt; on.

&quot;&gt; What did you find? Be specific.

&quot;You don't expect me to attempt to engage with you in a civil
discussion, do you? I know you too well for that.

&quot;&gt;&gt; What have you done to investigate and support your beliefs?

&quot;&gt; Legitimate scholars have no 'beliefs.' They have hypotheses.

&quot;You are so dogmatic, it almost substitutes for a normal sense of
humor, but unfortunately, not quite well enough. Tell me, do you
believe Bacon wrote Shakespeare? Or is it a hypothesis?

&quot;&gt;&gt; Paul is with someone in England, apparently, transcribing
&gt;&gt; little-known manuscripts.

&quot;&gt; Since Bacon has an authenticated manuscript page of 'Henry IV'
&gt; and 50
&gt; pages of notes for the Shakespeare plays in his own handwriting I
&gt; would not bother 'transcribing little-known manuscripts.'

&quot;I don't think we're interested in buying any advice from you today,
thanks.&quot;

[...]
&quot;&gt; I've put the links up. I wish Webb would pay attention.

&quot;Why should he, or anyone?

[Why indeed? Only because someone needs to set the record straight
regarding Elizabeth's flights of fancy.]

&quot;You've floundered around presenting so much nonsense here that few
would bother to spend time following your road signs.

[Stephanie definitely has a point here!]

&quot;&gt;&gt; We are, and have been, actively LOOKING,

&quot;&gt; That, Stephanie, is the first thing you have said that rings true.
&gt; I
&gt; don't doubt you're 'looking' and probably with some sense of urgency
&gt; because the Oxfodians have been making extravagant claims for 80
&gt; years
&gt; and they still have *nothing.*

&quot;Well, you do have that mighty Baconian cryptographic prayer wheel, I
suppose. Have you tried it lately?

&quot;&gt; Sooner or later a Strat will write a popular book on the Oxfordian
&gt; Hoax.

&quot;Alan Nelson is trying to do a book based on that idea, I guess, but
if he succeeds in getting out a book I doubt that it will be
'popular', as his own hoaxing and bias sticks out all over. I'm sure
you enjoy reading his 'work.' Many clever Strats appear to be
carefully avoiding the issue, it seems.

&quot;&gt;&gt; and we have been finding.

&quot;&gt; Finding what? I notice you didn't finish that sentence.

&quot;I'll leave that to your fruity imagination.

[That's still the best characterization of Elizabeth's imagination that
I've seen in quite a while.]

&quot;&gt;&gt; Our efforts, along with those of many other researchers,

&quot;&gt; I don't call myself a 'researcher' even though I did a year of
&gt; research methodology.

&quot;Apparently you didn't learn much.

[Stephanie catches on fast!]

&quot;&gt;'Researcher' usually implies someone with an
&gt; advanced degree.

&quot;Don't mess with Mother OED.

&quot;&gt; Do you mean 'researcher' as in the Ogburns were 'researchers?'
&gt;
&gt; The Ogburns weren't 'researchers.' They were both lawyers;

&quot;I think this qualifies them, even by your fruity requirements, to do
research.

&quot;&gt; The Ogburns were caught--this has been written about--stealing from
&gt; Baconians. I noticed that they baldly quote Edwin Reed without
&gt; noting
&gt; that he was Bacon's biographer.

&quot;Baldness frequently occurs with advancing age, and I think it is
rather rude of you to bring it up.

&quot;&gt; The Ogburns were identity theives. They stole Baconian research,
&gt; scratched out Bacon's name and wrote 'My Lord Oxford' underneath.

You are clearly insane; I hope you have some sort of support group.

&gt;&gt; similarities there appear to be. In fact, Dave Kathman has pointed out

Well, why shouldn't she? The players were no threat to her. She did
not, however, remain upon good terms with Essex.

For that matter, I could say the same about many of the plays: for

the life of Henry VI of England, but I have neVER been tempted to
suppose that that monarch had any hand in the play's composition,

&quot;Millort de Voxfor,&quot; attended the GREEK Church in Venice
[San Giorgio dei Greci (The church of St George of the Greeks)]
(a church known as a HAVEN OF UNORTHODOXY), where he
first noticed Orazio singing at the church of S. Maria Formosa.

&quot;He heard me sing in the choir in Santa Maria Formosa
and he asked me if I wanted to go to England with him
and so I went&quot;.

The name comes from the Latin 'formosa', 'virtuous &amp; beautiful.'
The church stands in Campo Santa Maria Formosa, a large square
which is one of the liveliest centres of outdoor performances,
as theatre plays, music, tumblers.

Orazio consulted his father (FRANCISCO COGNO = FREE WILL?)
and his mother about the earl's subsequent invitation
to accompany him back to England, and they advised him to accept.

Although Orazio served Oxford officially as a PAGE, he was a
musician. On one occasion he sang before Queen Elizabeth, who
urged him to convert to the reformed religion. In London he made
the acquaintance of &quot;AMBROSO da Venetia,&quot;&quot;che e musicho della Regina
de ingelterra&quot; (who is a musician to the queen), and with 5 brothers
from Venice who were &quot;musici della Regina et fano flauti et viole&quot;

***You missed the compelling similarity that the names share the
letter &quot;r&quot; (and no other letter). This is obviously code for the fact
that Oxford &quot;r&quot; Shakespeare. The intent of the conspirators is
clearly demonstrated by our considering that, had they shared, say,
the letter &quot;d,&quot; it makes no sense, no sense at all, to say that Oxford
&quot;d&quot; Shakespeade. Indeed, no one but a fool would say that it makes
sense to say that &quot;Oxford d Shakespeade,&quot; and I dare anyone,
anti-Stratfordian and Stratfordian alike, to state that it does! What
further proof could be needed?

***The malicious conspirators, however, tease us further through the
undeniable fact that both names have first syllables ending in the
same sound though spelled differently (&quot;x&quot; and &quot;ks&quot;/&quot;kes&quot;); their
subtle craft is yet further evidenced by noting the relationship to
each other, via Grimm's Law, of the very next sounds in the two names
(&quot;f&quot; and &quot;p&quot;).

***There thus can be no question but that the originators of the great
conspiracy to conceal Oxford as the true author of the Shakespearean
works were the brothers Grimm, whose expertise with Fairy Tales is
well known.

Best Wishes,

Per your indefatigable snotty bitching, here's some observations
I made when reading the cloying This Star of England. If you
want the citations, look them up.

1. Why did the Ogburns plagerize British barrister Edwin Reed's
book that
demonstrated 865 parallels between Bacon's writings and the
Shakespeare plays?

2. Why did the Ogburns cut out Reed's reference to Bacon's
role as the Spear Shaker
in the Gray's Inn Knights of the Helmet fraternity in order to
imply that Reed supported Gabriel
Harvey's Pallas Athene (alledged) allusion to Oxford as the
Spear Shaker?

3. Why did the Ogburns then locate a secondary source that
contained Reed's statement and
worse, represent one of Reed's chapter headings as the title of
his book to
avoid citing Reed's actual title, 'Bacon Versus Shakespeare' in
their
bibliography?

It really made me indignant that the Ogburns would rely so heavily on
Reed
and then avoid showing that Reed was a Baconian, not an Oxfordian, by
substituting Reed's chapter heading for the title of his book because
the
title had Bacon's name in it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, what Stephanie actually wrote was:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;We are, and have been, actively LOOKING, and we have been finding.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Our efforts, along with those of many other researchers, working
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mostly on their own, are producing new evidence. We are not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trampling the dusty roads to Stratford, and we are not looking in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Silver Street in the old Wigmaker's cellar. What have you been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doing lately, except jibing pointlessly at our efforts?&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Dr. Decontexualizer,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stephanie didn't write that to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think David Webb said she did.

&gt;&gt; There were FOUR posts in this debate.

&gt;&gt; Webb could not win his argument if he posted the whole
&gt;&gt; discussion so he disingenuously pared it down to the post
&gt;&gt; that made HIS point.

&gt; It is exceedingly tiresome correcting Elizabeth's revisionist
&gt; newsgroup history, but for the benefit of the unique h.l.a.s.
&gt; participant who evidently cannot use Google (i.e., Elizabeth), here is
&gt; the discussion in its entirety, with just a few phrases snipped to
&gt; eliminate redundancy. I apologize for its length, but one's patience is
&gt; rewarded in the end, as Elizabeth's posts just keep getting funnier as
&gt; the discussion proceeds. I begin with Elizabeth's post quoting
&gt; Stephanie's paragraph above:

&gt; Elizabeth's rejoinder to Stephanie:

&gt;&quot;&gt; Not a bit, Jim. I have been reading source materials widely for
&gt;&gt; more than
&gt;&gt; 10 years, have made a couple of discoveries at the Folger Library,

&gt;&quot;Why don't you share those discoveries with us, Stephanie? The reason
&gt; Oxfordians get no respect in HLAS is that Oxfordians keep talking
&gt; about evidence but they never show us any evidence.

&gt;&quot;&gt; have
&gt;&gt; purchased microfilms of very rare materias from the British
&gt;&gt; Library, and so
&gt;&gt; on.

&gt;&quot;What did you find? Be specific.

&gt;&quot;&gt; What have you done to investigate and support your beliefs?

&gt;&quot;Legitimate scholars have no 'beliefs.' They have hypotheses.

&gt;&quot;&gt; Paul is
&gt;&gt; working with someone in England, apparently, transcribing
&gt;&gt; little-known
&gt;&gt; manuscripts.

&gt;&quot;Since Bacon has an authenticated manuscript page of 'Henry IV' and 50
&gt; pages of notes for the Shakespeare plays in his own handwriting I
&gt; would not bother 'transcribing little-known manuscripts.' And yes,
&gt; I've put the links up. I wish Webb would pay attention.

&gt; [There is just no pleasing Elizabeth -- elsewhere she conveys the
&gt; impression that any attention I may pay to her posts is most unwelcome.]

&gt;&quot;&gt; We are, and have been, actively LOOKING,

&gt;&quot;That, Stephanie, is the first thing you have said that rings true.
&gt; I don't doubt you're 'looking' and probably with some sense of urgency
&gt; because the Oxfodians have been making extravagant claims for 80 years
&gt; and they still have *nothing.*

&gt;&quot;Sooner or later a Strat will write a popular book on the Oxfordian
&gt; Hoax.

&gt;&quot;&gt; and we have been finding.

&gt;&quot;Finding what? I notice you didn't finish that sentence.

&gt;&quot;&gt; Our efforts, along with those of many other researchers,

&gt;&quot;I don't call myself a 'researcher' even though I did a year of
&gt; research methodology. 'Researcher' usually implies someone with
&gt; an advanced degree.

&gt;&quot;Do you mean 'researcher' as in the Ogburns were 'researchers?'

&gt;&quot;The Ogburns weren't 'researchers.'

&gt;&quot;The Ogburns were caught--this has been written about--

&gt; [By *whom*? Note Elizabeth's customary, scrupulous precision in citing
&gt; sources: &quot;this has been written about....&quot;]

&gt;&quot;stealing from
&gt; Baconians. I noticed that they baldly quote Edwin Reed without noting
&gt; that he was Bacon's biographer.

&gt; [Why should they have noted that, exactly?]

&gt;&quot;The Ogburns were identity theives [sic]. They stole Baconian
&gt; research, scratched out Bacon's name and wrote 'My Lord Oxford'
&gt; underneath.

&gt; [Note here Elizabeth's habitual presumption that others are not merely
&gt; wrong, but engaged in *intentional* intellectual dishonesty: plagiarism,
&gt; fraud, suppression of evidence, theft, etc.]

&gt;&quot;Do you know what that means Stephanie?

&gt;&quot;That means the Ogburns ***knew*** that what they had was evidence of
&gt; Bacon's authorship.

&gt; [Note here Elizabeth's habitual presumption that others are not merely

&gt; not among Elizabeth's many charms.]

&gt;&quot;Are y'awl a Southern lady?

&gt; [Huh?!]

&gt;&quot;Produce the evidence Stephanie and we'll all become Oxfordians.&quot;
&gt; --------------------------

&gt; Stephanie's followup:

&gt;&quot;&gt;&gt;....... I have been reading source materials widely for
&gt;&gt;&gt; more than
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10 years, have made a couple of discoveries at the Folger
&gt;&gt;&gt; Library,

&gt;&quot;&gt; Why don't you share those discoveries with us, Stephanie? Th
&gt;&gt; reason
&gt;&gt; Oxfordians get no respect in HLAS is that Oxfordians keep talking
&gt;&gt; about evidence but they never show us any evidence.

&gt;&quot;We get respect. We get dawged by a pack of boring flak-meisters,
&gt; but they do no damage.

&gt;&quot;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; purchased microfilms of very rare materias from the British
&gt;&gt;&gt; Library, and so
&gt;&gt;&gt; on.

&gt;&quot;&gt; What did you find? Be specific.

&gt;&quot;You don't expect me to attempt to engage with you in a civil
&gt; discussion, do you? I know you too well for that.

&gt;&quot;&gt;&gt; What have you done to investigate and support your beliefs?

&gt;&quot;&gt; Legitimate scholars have no 'beliefs.' They have hypotheses.

&gt;&quot;You are so dogmatic, it almost substitutes for a normal sense of
&gt; humor, but unfortunately, not quite well enough. Tell me, do you
&gt; believe Bacon wrote Shakespeare? Or is it a hypothesis?

&gt;&quot;&gt;&gt; Paul is with someone in England, apparently, transcribing
&gt;&gt;&gt; little-known manuscripts.

&gt;&quot;&gt; Since Bacon has an authenticated manuscript page of 'Henry IV'
&gt;&gt; and 50
&gt;&gt; pages of notes for the Shakespeare plays in his own handwriting I
&gt;&gt; would not bother 'transcribing little-known manuscripts.'

&gt;&quot;I don't think we're interested in buying any advice from you today,
&gt; thanks.&quot;

&gt; [...]
&gt;&quot;&gt; I've put the links up. I wish Webb would pay attention.

&gt;&quot;Why should he, or anyone?

&gt; [Why indeed? Only because someone needs to set the record straight
&gt; regarding Elizabeth's flights of fancy.]

&gt;&quot;You've floundered around presenting so much nonsense here that few
&gt; would bother to spend time following your road signs.

&gt; [Stephanie definitely has a point here!]

&gt;&quot;&gt;&gt; We are, and have been, actively LOOKING,

&gt;&quot;&gt; That, Stephanie, is the first thing you have said that rings true.
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; don't doubt you're 'looking' and probably with some sense of urgency
&gt;&gt; because the Oxfodians have been making extravagant claims for 80
&gt;&gt; years
&gt;&gt; and they still have *nothing.*

You're right -- I overlooked the obvious. In fact, your conclusion
is further sustained by the observation that the only letters common to
both &quot;Shakespeare&quot; and &quot;Earl of Oxford&quot; are &quot;a,&quot;&quot;r,&quot; and &quot;e,&quot;
underscoring your conclusion that Oxford and Shakespeare &quot;ARE&quot; the same.
Indeed, even the clustering of the letters -- shakespe{ARE}, {EAR}l of
oxford -- is conspicuous evidence in support of your inference. When
one adds the observation that &quot;William Shakespeare&quot; is an anagram of

A weakish, simple Earl,

the concealed identity of &quot;Shakespeare&quot; becomes virtually incontestable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The intent of the conspirators is
&gt; clearly demonstrated by our considering that, had they shared, say,

None whatever, as far as ciphermongers like Art are concerned.

Careful, Brent -- the oVERt use of the word &quot;craft&quot; might lead a

A very good point!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ***There thus can be no question but that the originators of the great

&gt; well known.

"/>

Indeed. In fact, curiously, the names of the brethren, Jacob Ludwig
CARL Grimm and Wilhelm CARL Grimm contain the name &quot;Carl&quot; in common.
&quot;Carl&quot; is a deft conspiratorial touch -- on the one hand, it means a
commoner or husbandman (like Shakespeare), but a single stroke of the
pen conVERts the initial &quot;C&quot; to an &quot;E&quot;, revealing the &quot;Earl&quot; behind the
deception. MoreoVER, Art's full name is Arthur CARL Neuendorffer, a
fact whose significance surely requires no elaboration.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Oxfordians will get complete respect when they produce convincing

&gt;&gt;&quot;In the meantime, Stephanie, I don't think you realize that your
&gt;&gt; previous post was a classic and so fine an example of its type it
&gt;&gt; should be included in all future books written on the subject of
&gt;&gt; evidence.

&gt;&gt;&quot;You, Stephanie, in a single post, exposed the frailities of Oxfordian
&gt;&gt; research when you admitted that Oxfordians are *still* looking for
&gt;&gt; evidence.

&gt;&gt;&quot;'We're LOOKING.'

&gt;&gt;&quot;The method that Oxfordians use in research was discredited by Bacon
&gt;&gt; when he founded the scientific method. Bacon said, in effect, that
&gt;&gt; *literature is not evidence* when he rejected the texts of the
&gt;&gt; Scholasticists who were even at that time pursuing arguments at the
&gt;&gt; University of Paris about the number of angels that could fit inside
&gt;&gt; of various containers or stand on top of various objects. [This has
&gt;&gt; nothing to do with Bacon's theory and practicum of conveying
&gt;&gt; 'knowledge' through literature--he put 'all knowledge' into a form
&gt;&gt; that would never be mistaken for *evidence*].

&gt;&gt;&quot;All of the Scholasticists' 'proofs' were, of course, literary.

&gt;&gt;&quot;The Scholasticists were the Ogburns of their era.
&gt; I PRESS STEPHANIE FOR EVIDENCE:

&gt;&gt;&quot;It is customary, Stephanie, in the world of *real research*

&gt;&gt;&quot;to announce your candidates [sic] authorship *after* the evidence of
&gt;&gt; authorship is acquired.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Not *before* the evidence is gathered.

&gt;&gt; This is good Art. Feynman's writing isn't up to the standard
&gt;&gt; of William James or Stephan Jay Gould--Gould is such a great
&gt;&gt; philosopher of evidence I think he'll find a place beside James--
&gt;&gt; but we definitely need more of this kind of analysis in HLAS.

&gt; Gould was a fine essayist but Feynman was a much better lecturer.

"/>

Feynman must have been because they're still talking about him.
I actually met this woman who lost her virginity to Feynman.
She said Feynman was a much better lecturer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It reminds me, however, of my question to Stephanie which was
&gt;&gt; 'where's the evidence of Oxford's authorship?'

&gt; Bacon was a fine essayist but de Vere was a much better dramatist.

"/>

Art. There is no authorship evidence for Oxford and there
is much evidence that excludes him. I posted on Bacon's
co-authorship with Robert Cecil of the Father Henry Garnet
trial pamphlet that was written at the same time Macbeth
was being written that appears in Macbeth. Oxford was
dead in 1606 and Bacon did not scribble Garnet references
into Macbeth as part of a literary conspiracy.

You can only believe the conspiracy theory because
Strats have created a political and doctrinal vacuum
to keep their Catholic candidate whose only visible politics
was to betray the (republican) Stratford Corporation to
be able to double his annual profits by throwing nineteen
cottagers off the tithe-holding Strats carelessly call
'a field.' It wasn't 'a field.'

It's impossible to refute any part of a literary conspiracy theory
because conspiracies leave no records. I can eliminate Elizabeth
from any involvement with Elizabethan literature. The Queen
was no intellectual and she did't care about poetry. She patronized
the writers of Anglican doctrinal treatises and allowed the Court
poets to starve. In the end this policy did Elizabeth no good because
the poets moved to Wilton and became critics of Tudor policy. In
any event there's no way to grapple with unsupported speculation
so the conspiracists always have the upper hand.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Stephanie replied 'we're still looking.'

&gt; I'm sure Stephanie actually replied something to the effect 'we're still
&gt; looking' for MORE evidence.

"/>

What she said--although not to me because she wouldn't dare--was
that Oxfordians were 'looking and finding.'

Webb took that out of context. It ran for four posts and Stephanie
couldn't come up with any authorship evidence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Most Oxfordian would love to clarify lots of fuzzy issues even if it means
&gt; that someone else takes first place in the Shakespeare Caucus.

"/>

If you mean Bacon, there is simply no common ground between
Bacon and Oxford in terms of politics, doctrine, philosophy
or anything else. If Bacon is Immerito--and the genocidal
maniac that killed 30,000 Irish 'next' to Kilkolman is not--Bacon
refers to Oxford as the 'Old Controller.' Bacon's mentor Harvey
ridiculed Oxford and Oxford dragged Harvey before
the Privy Council, sued him, and had him thrown in the Fleet
and paid Nashe to ruin his reputation. Harvey retired to Saffron
Upon Walden and the Elizabethan Renaissance lost one of
it's two most brilliant thinkers. Harvey was no philosopher but
he mastered classical rhetoric including its conpiratorial underbelly
(no, he did not work for Elizabeth and Oxford--Elizabeth dissed
Harvey after the Witty Letters were stolen and revealed that
Harvey was spying on Oxford and Oxford did all of the above
to Harvey).

The Countess of Pembroke wrote two poems for Harvey to
publish when he was under attack by Oxford and although I
don't know that they were specifically about Oxford they are
hilariously insulting to someone in the Oxford-Nashe crowd.
I doubt a Countess would bother with Nashe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Oxfordians have prepared the runway with studies on the
&gt;&gt; Nashe and Harvey quarrel and Lady Bedford's soiree but
&gt;&gt; until Oxfordians find the authorship evidence they're
&gt;&gt; 'still looking for' they'll remain an authorship-faction-in-waiting.

&gt; I've given you my evidence that Shake-speare was a phony personna clearly
&gt; meant to signify Oxford.

You and I have different philosophies of evidence. Mine is
that evidence is required to prove something.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Many Oxfordians have found convincing arguments of
&gt; a totally different nature.

"/>

The closest thing to evidence the Oxfordians have is
Stritmatter's PhD thesis which is far weaker in terms
of parallels than Bacon's Promus.

Everything else is literary criticism and literary criticism
isn't evidence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Even Delia Bacon didn't believe that Francis
&gt; Bacon was the poet.

"/>

You're not taking into consideration the fact that
Delia Bacon wrote before any Baconian evidence was
discovered. The Northumberland was found the same
year her book was published in the 1850s, the Promus, the
commonplace book with all the R &amp; J notes was found in
the 1880s, the Henry IV in 1992, iirc, and Baconiana--which
is stuffed with evidence of Bacon's authorship but the
English Baconians won't let allow it to be put on CD Rom
so you're safe until they do--was founded until the 1880s.

Delia had nothing to go on so she made the right assumptions
based on the availble facts.

One way or another Bacon founded the authorship debate
by being the first to seriously question Strat authorship.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Marlovians are presently in another thread compiling lists of

That's pretty vulnerable evidence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No, they do not. Baconians don't fail to mention that
Bacon was a bona fide genius but that is not the basis
of the Baconian claim. The Baconians put Bacon's
evidence up first.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

They can't prove Marlowe wrote 'his own' plays.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I'll be excited when Oxfordians finally produce it. So far I've
seen nothing other than Stritmatter's sorry evidence.. I believed
for about eight year, without getting too deeply into the evidence,
that Oxford authored the Shakespeare works. The Strat case
is ridiculous on the face of it and Oxford seemed to be the logical
candate.

Then, Art, I spent three months just going over the evidence
for the four leading candidates. Evidence. I did not permit
myself to be sucked in by romantic drivel.

I saw that only Bacon and the Stratford candidate had
any evidence of authorship.

That evidence falls into place exactly as it should.

Elizabeth

Well, you're the one who made the suggestion, Art, so I presumed that

responds merely by challenging the questioner to adduce refutative
evidence instead. In the real world, of course, such investigators are

&gt; Well, you're the one who made the suggestion, Art, so I presumed that
&gt; you would be prepared to support it with evidence. (I should have known
&gt; better, but I'm eVER the optimist.) Evidently you live in a fantasy
&gt; world in which an investigator may make an implausible (if not outright
&gt; outrageous) claim, and when challenged to adduce supporting evidence,
&gt; responds merely by challenging the questioner to adduce refutative

&gt; not taken seriously.

On behalf of the (long dead) Sir Edward Lockyer, I protest!

What MUST be attempted is for all sides of a discussion, even an unevidenced
claim, is to regard the subject, not the speaker. There is ample evidence

Have you ever seen the actual manuscripts? I know of only
one photo of them. There's a second page you've probably never
seen. The copies we see are either made with some kind of
tracing machine ca 1860 or transcribed in Victorian script.

The actual Northumberland is absolutely covered--every square mm.
with dense handwriting and furthermore there are strata of handwriting
in various degrees of fading below that. It would be incredible if
the Northumberland earls would allow some forensic work done on what
looks like sun-faded writing. Of course we can't have that because,
as Queen Victoria said, 'history should be left as it is!'

Baconians have more records of destroyed, concealed,
repressed, lost, and misidentified evidence than they have
evidence itself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Most Oxfordian would love to clarify lots of fuzzy issues even if it

&gt;&gt; If you mean Bacon, there is simply no common ground between
&gt;&gt; Bacon and Oxford in terms of politics, doctrine, philosophy
&gt;&gt; or anything else. If Bacon is Immerito--and the genocidal
&gt;&gt; maniac that killed 30,000 Irish 'next' to Kilkolman is not--Bacon
&gt;&gt; refers to Oxford as the 'Old Controller.' Bacon's mentor Harvey
&gt;&gt; ridiculed Oxford and Oxford dragged Harvey before
&gt;&gt; the Privy Council, sued him, and had him thrown in the Fleet
&gt;&gt; and paid Nashe to ruin his reputation. Harvey retired to Saffron
&gt;&gt; Upon Walden and the Elizabethan Renaissance lost one of
&gt;&gt; it's two most brilliant thinkers. Harvey was no philosopher but
&gt;&gt; he mastered classical rhetoric including its conpiratorial underbelly
&gt;&gt; (no, he did not work for Elizabeth and Oxford--Elizabeth dissed
&gt;&gt; Harvey after the Witty Letters were stolen and revealed that
&gt;&gt; Harvey was spying on Oxford and Oxford did all of the above

&gt; And then there is Essex &amp; Bacon.

You've put too much faith in the Strats, Art. Abbott was not
a disinterested scholar and had to destroy Bacon to clear the
way for racist Strat British imperialism which started building
about the time Abbott wrote. Bacon wouldn't make a good
poster boy because he wasn't a racist and thought the British
should behave 'like gentlemen' toward native Americans. That's

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; until Oxfordians find the authorship evidence they're
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'still looking for' they'll remain an authorship-faction-in-waiting.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've given you my evidence that Shake-speare was a phony personna
&gt; clearly
&gt;&gt;&gt; meant to signify Oxford.

&gt;&gt; You and I have different philosophies of evidence. Mine is

&gt; You and I have different DEFINITIONS of &quot;evidence.&quot;

"/>

So what's your definition, Art?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Many Oxfordians have found convincing arguments of
&gt;&gt;&gt; a totally different nature.

&gt;&gt; The closest thing to evidence the Oxfordians have is
&gt;&gt; Stritmatter's PhD thesis which is far weaker in terms
&gt;&gt; of parallels than Bacon's Promus.

&gt; I'm afraid that Roger was barking up the wrong tree; Oxford underlined
&gt; Bible passages that he HAD to memorize

"/>

No, Art. I've gone through the Folger Geneva Bible and those
weren't 'memorizing' passages. Have you even taken a bible
and the list of verses and looked them up (it will take you a month).
There is a great deal of repetition in the underlined verses--there's
much repetition in the OT and the NT--many repeated pages due
to scribal error in the OT and the syncoptic gospels in the NT--as
well as NT verses repeating the OT verses but this underliner
found them all.

The verses are underlined to make a point about Oxford's faults.
There are verses about sodomy (the Sodom and Gomorrah story
is underlined but the particular verses celebrate Abraham--somebody
is trying to sell Oxford on Lord Burghley who identified with Abraham
and was literally Abraham in securing mercy for 'the last Sodomite'
in the matter of the killing of Thomas Brincknell--that story is great
reading) and verses about the treatment of widows and children--
every verse in the OT concerning law on widows or widows and
children is underlined--my guess is that Anne Cecil was shocked and
frightened by the fact that Oxford sued the young widow of Thomas
Brincknell, taking her property, forcing the parish to assume
responsibility for
Brincknell's widow and three children.

I don't know how you square Oxford's behavior with the
Shakespeare works. I conceded that Oxford is one of the most
interesting Elizabethans but he was a bad boy.

Oxford didn't underline the verses. They were done by someone--
probably Anne Cecil since her handwriting would still be juvenile
like the writer's--and the underliner seems quite desperate to change
Oxford. The entire plan for salvation is underlined in the New
Testament.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; not ones that impressed him. Still
&gt; one can see where Shakespeare got his concern for the poor.

"/>

Or someone was distraught because Oxford killed Brincknell and
sued his widow. Anne Cecil was raised by Mildred Cecil. Anne had
a Calvinist conscience and that's what the underlinings say loud and
clear. Whoever underlined the verses was in a state of anguish.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Even Delia Bacon didn't believe that Francis
&gt;&gt;&gt; Bacon was the poet.

&gt;&gt; You're not taking into consideration the fact that
&gt;&gt; Delia Bacon wrote before any Baconian evidence was
&gt;&gt; discovered. The Northumberland was found the same
&gt;&gt; year her book was published in the 1850s, the Promus, the
&gt;&gt; commonplace book with all the R &amp; J notes was found in

&gt;&gt; English Baconians won't let allow it to be put on CD Rom
&gt;&gt; so you're safe until they do--was founded until the 1880s.

&gt; I'm sure there is lots of evidence to implicate Bacon in the conspiracy -
&gt; that does NOT make him the primary author.

"/>

There's no conspiracy.

What you are misreading, Art, is the evidence generated by the
factions.
The factions were sometimes conspiratorial, for example, when plotting
to kill the Queen, but they weren't primarily engaged in conspiracy.
The Catholic conspiricies were essentially brainless except the
one that I posit suceeded against Essex. I think that one was
craftily done. Ralegh's last words were 'Essex was tricked to
his death' and Essex was foolish to allow the enemy--literally--
to get in bed with him. He surrounded himself with ultra-Catholics
and I think they killed him. And what a humiliating death. Bacon
was an outsider at that point, struggling to stay out of debtors
prison. In fact he landed in prison again in 1598. That proves
that Bacon wasn't involved with any ...

The nature of 'evidence' is that it is explanatory. If you

What you have stated above is a very loose argument that

damaging inferences.

A tight argument is one that has 'real' evidence (real evidence
is defined as 'a thing involved in the underlying event,' like a
a document). Oxfordians have nothing in that category.

It would be a tragedy for Baconians if they indulged in the
loose, speculative, conjectural inferences that are the stuff
of Schoenbaumian, Ogburnian and I suppose Wrightian
novelizations.

Bacon will never be universally recognized as the author
of the Shakespeare works, Art, so don't worry so much about
it. We're well into the New Medievalism--I found this little
chart in a scholarly paper--I couldn't believe that am academic
agreed with me that we've headed back into a medieval dark
age--

Orthodoxy (The Renaissance) Orthodoxy

in which irrational beliefs will increasingly prevail over common
sense and reason. Einstein, in a sense, was the turning point
because he was trained in science but consciously and categorically
rejected it for idealism. Idealism is the highest form of the medieval.

As the mask, the surname seller, the batillus, the 'ape,'
the 'eccho,' (Jonson).

Only two have authorship evidence.

Bacon.

Shakspere.

Their evidence is perfectly congruent. Bacon has manuscripts,
the notebook with lines that appear at the same time in R &amp; J,
the Northumberland with 'Shakespeare' all over it, the Strachey
letter, many attestations that he's a concealed poet.

One of the most telling are two notations 'Shakespeare' in
the Inns of Court revels book. The Inns of Court NEVER
hired professional playwrights. It would have been a smear
on the honor of the Inn, yet we have two new plays by 'Shakespeare.'
Not a single playwright was from outside the Inns of Court in the
60 years recorded in the revels books. Not until after the
English Civil War did the Inns hire professionals.

&gt; No, the documentation points to Shakespeare of Stratford as the author.

"/>

The documentation in Part 5 could easily be about the concealed
poet 'Shake-speare.' Many of the attestations are from the Inns of
Court or Cambridge. All or most of the attestations are from men
who were close to Bacon and few if any of them can be connected
to the actor.

We also have Jonson ridiculing the actor in EMOHH in which he
calls the actor the 'eccho' of the Knight Puntarvolo who just happens
to have Bacon's character tags.

A 'punto' is a term from sword-fighting so you have punto (sword)
and volo (will) a play on 'will sword' or 'will spear.' Sogliardo is
'Will Sword's' 'eccho,' a rustic actor who has bought a coat of
arms with the motto, 'Not Without Mustard,' which even Strats
acknowledge is a takeoff on the actor's motto.

If there's any doubt, Jonson left a cipher POETCANBO or
POET BACON in the initial letters of a very funny speech
by Puntarvolo in which the Knight tries to set the rustic boob
up with a gentlewoman, describing his crude 'eccho' with his own
characteristics--brilliant, aristocratic, educated, courtly, a great
orator, etc. Jonson did it quite well.

Jonson was obsessed with Bacon and wrote him into at least
four plays.

Jonson is supposed to be obsessed with Shakspere but we
fin that everytime Jonson satirized his rival poet the poet has
none of the characeristics of the Stratford actor but describes
Bacon to the life.

You don't know anything about evidence, Reedy.

How, pray tell, does the fact that the Stratford actor
was 'an actor' prove that he was a playwright?

Or the fact that he was a Globe-sharer prove that
he was a playwright?

Evidence is something tangible (or a witness) that must be
placed next to the thing offered to be proven, figuratively
speaking. You've got printed title pages. That's essentially
all you have. You don't lay 'an actor' down next to them.
You put a document by a witness that had direct knowledge
of the playwright's authorship next to the title pages.

How hard can this be?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Similarly, as Elizabeth says, there is much documentation of both

Wrong. Southeby's put a Henry IV fragment up for
auction that had been authenticated by its documents
experts plus am expert witness documents
examiner hired by a Baconian. It was photographed,
put in the Southeby's catelogue and it disappeared.
We still have the photo and a second page, the latter
now in a private collection apparently left in a bequest
to the State of Norway. The second page is labeled
'the third Shakespeare manuscript.'

Dr. Webb doesn't know if the Strachey letter got
to Stratford. Here's the quote: &quot;I don't know.'

The Strats have so filtered their scholarship to keep from
acknowledging Bacon that it's increasingly worthless even
as Shakespeare scholarship. I use the facts, if any, but the
interpretations are worthless orthodoxy.

There is, however, Dr. Pompousass, much scholarship that
bears on the authorship question in Spenserian, Sidnean
and Jonsonian scholarship not to speak of that on other
poets like Greene, Lyly, Peele, and others.

Whoever was writing the Shakespeare works (that would
be the guy with the Strachey letter), the 'minor' poets were
paying a great deal of attention to him.

BEST OF ALL, lit scholars as a whole are not kneeling
at the Strat altar and crossing themselves anymore. The
postmodernists, feminists, and anti-colonalists in lit crit are
perfectly willing to rat the Bard out. They'd like to see him
gone. And then there's the Catholic Bard movement. The
only group that has it exactly right. I doubt if Strats have
another decade. In the future all the works will be given the
Oxfordian treatment. Isn't that something to look forward to.

Would you like to support that statement with a couple of

the Baconians have 'taken out of context?'

I've never seen any 'scholar' take 'documentation' out
of context the way Kathman tried to do with Hotson's
theory of the Strachey letter. Hotson said it was
(quote) theoretical.

Strats are living off the work of a genius who was definitely
not a low class actor-grain dealer. But the real abomination
is that we've lost the Renaissance just to keep the 16th
century safe BLAND for the Strat candidate. Of course
he could not have mastered the range of Renaissance
knowledge in the plays so just KILL THE RENAISSANCE.

&gt; calls the actor the 'eccho' of the Knight Puntarvolo who just happens
&gt; to have Bacon's character tags.

&gt; A 'punto' is a term from sword-fighting so you have punto (sword)
&gt; and volo (will) a play on 'will sword' or 'will spear.'

First, in what language do you imagine that &quot;Puntarvolo&quot; means &quot;will
spear&quot;? Second, a sword is not the same thing as a spear, and indeed
bears little resemblance to one.

&gt; Sogliardo is
&gt; 'Will Sword's' 'eccho,' a rustic actor who has bought a coat of
&gt; arms with the motto, 'Not Without Mustard,' which even Strats
&gt; acknowledge is a takeoff on the actor's motto.

&gt; If there's any doubt, Jonson left a cipher POETCANBO or
&gt; POET BACON in the initial letters of a very funny speech

*Where* is this supposed cipher? Let's see it.

&gt; by Puntarvolo in which the Knight tries to set the rustic boob
&gt; up with a gentlewoman, describing his crude 'eccho' with his own
&gt; characteristics--brilliant, aristocratic, educated, courtly, a great
&gt; orator, etc. Jonson did it quite well.

&gt; Jonson was obsessed with Bacon and wrote him into at least
&gt; four plays.

I see no evidence of Jonson's ostensible obsession with Bacon.
Rather, I see plenty of evidence of your delusional obsession with Bacon.

&gt; Evidence is something tangible (or a witness) that must be

&gt; You put a document by a witness that had direct knowledge

&gt; How hard can this be?

You tell me. You have had a year and a half to adduce your evidence
for the supposed sense of &quot;shake-scene&quot; and for Southampton's putative
performance of female roles on stage, yet you have furnished no evidence
whatever for the former, and the &quot;evidence&quot; that you furnished for the
latter -- your subjective impression that a four hundred year-old and
probably badly oxidized and discolored portrait doesn't match what you
imagine must have been Southampton's hair color, therefore Southampton
must have been wearing a wig, therefore he used to hang around the
theatres hoping to play female roles and eventually succeeded in
performing quite convincingly in those roles -- is utterly ludicrous.
When you make an unqualified assertion, you should be prepared to adduce
credible evidence. How hard can this be?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is an endorsement?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's as close as Elizabeth can come to one.
&gt; Webb's 'I don't know' wasn't much of an endorsement
&gt; of Kathman when Webb was asked if the Strachey
&gt; letter ever got into the hands of the Stratford grain dealer.

You have misrepresented what I said yet again. I did not even
address the question of *whether* Shakespeare was aware of the content
of the Strachey letter, but rather *how* he became aware of it. In
cases when I do not know the answer, I do not merely invent or
hallucinate one. I only wish that you would exhibit such restraint.

&gt; Dr. Webb doesn't know if the Strachey letter got

Here is the quotation *in context*:

Dave More:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Dave, Do you think William obtained access to the Strachey letter?

"/>

Me:
If not to the letter, then at least to its content.

Dave More:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; how?

"/>

Me:
I don't know, and neither does anyone else. However, Dave Kathman's
essay enumerates many robust connections between Shakespeare and William
Strachey and between Shakespeare and the Virginia Company, connections
striking enough to dispel decisively the notion that Shakespeare's
presumed access to the letter's content constitutes some sort of
glaringly anomalous, inexplicable enigma.

Of course, therein lies my unfair advantage over Elizabeth Weird -- I
have actually *read* Dave's essay, unlike Elizabeth, who fabricated (or
perhaps hallucinated) a hilarious &quot;quotation&quot; which she then attributed
to Dave Kathman, a quotation averring that Richard Field carried the
Strachey letter to Stratford! (Of course, Field is not mentioned at all
in Dave's essay.)

&gt; The Strats have so filtered their scholarship to keep from
&gt; acknowledging Bacon that it's increasingly worthless even
&gt; as Shakespeare scholarship. I use the facts, if any,

"/>

You mean, &quot;facts&quot; like the following?

Elizabeth Weird &quot;facts&quot;:

(1)
&quot;Verulam means 'state of truth' in Latin, Oxfordians.&quot;

&lt;&gt;

(2)
&quot;O[ld] E[nglish] was still spoken in some shires until the 1800s.&quot;

&lt;&gt;

(3)
&quot;Southampton was overly fond of drag and used to hang about the
theatres hoping to play female roles. He was given a few parts
and was apparently very convincing as a girl.&quot;

&lt;&gt;

(4)
&quot;The term 'shake-scene' was Elizabethan theatre slang for the
factotum who toted scenery around between acts.&quot;

&lt;&gt;

(5)
&quot;The Standard Dialect can be read and written by people who, for
example, speak an Elizabethan West Virginian dialect at home.&quot;

&lt;&gt;

etc., etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but the
&gt; interpretations are worthless orthodoxy.

&gt; There is, however, Dr. Pompousass, much scholarship that
&gt; bears on the authorship question in Spenserian, Sidnean
&gt; and Jonsonian scholarship not to speak of that on other
&gt; poets like Greene, Lyly, Peele, and others.

&gt; Whoever was writing the Shakespeare works (that would
&gt; be the guy with the Strachey letter), the 'minor' poets were
&gt; paying a great deal of attention to him.

&gt; BEST OF ALL, lit scholars as a whole are not kneeling
&gt; at the Strat altar and crossing themselves anymore. The
&gt; postmodernists, feminists, and anti-colonalists in lit crit are
&gt; perfectly willing to rat the Bard out. They'd like to see him
&gt; gone.

"/>

In other words, as far as you are concerned, intellectual fads,
political agendas, and other motives quite outside the purview of
disinterested historical scholarship are fair means toward your ends,
and historical truth is merely a secondary consideration, as long as
your bizarre animus toward William Shakespeare is gratified.

I suspected as much after witnessing the extraordinary acrimony
underlying your anti-Einstein screeds -- indeed, you even stooped to
misrepresenting the opinion and work of a distinguished scientist, J.-P.
Hsu, whose work you plainly had never even read! Incredibly, you argued
-- simultaneously -- that Einstein's work was both wrong *and*
&quot;plagerized,&quot; making it abundantly clear that your beliefs were founded
not in scientific fact nor even in ridiculous misunderstandings of basic
science (although you certainly displayed plenty of those!) but in
irrational animus.

Indeed, I am reminded of one of your funniest and most extraordinary
rationalizations of the undeniable fact that Einstein is given the
lion's share of the credit for special relativity:

&quot;Einstein is on my list of plagiarizers, not geniuses.
Lorentz and Poincare--the latter in the top ten of all
mathematicians--had priority on relativity theory. Einstein
was sexy. Poincare was a very precise Frenchman with no star
quality and therefore not qualified to 'overturn Newton.'&quot;

This extraordinary, hilarious pronouncement apparently means that you
*actually believe* that research scientists gauge the importance,
originality, and priority of their colleagues' work on the basis of
whether the researcher is &quot;sexy&quot;!!

As I say, I suspected that you were quite prepared to abandon
disinterested scholarship in favor of agenda-driven polemic, but I
scarcely expected you to admit it so candidly, as you do above.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And then there's the Catholic Bard movement. The
&gt; only group that has it exactly right. I doubt if Strats have
&gt; another decade. In the future all the works will be given the
&gt; Oxfordian treatment. Isn't that something to look forward to.
&gt; The Oxfordian interpretaton of Othello. Or Lear.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, this &quot;selective citation&quot; makes sense.
&gt;&gt; If you are trying to prove a fantasy, yes it does. Taking the documentation
&gt;&gt; and evidence out of context is the only way to construct an alternative
&gt;&gt; authorship scenario.
&gt; Would you like to support that statement with a couple of
&gt; examples, Reedy? What 'documentation' do you think
&gt; the Baconians have 'taken out of context?'

Well, at least one Baconian has taken my remarks out of context, as I
demonstrated above.
