Hi,

Sorry to have upset some members on here!!

We are a small new business and we are not aware of the trouble and
upset it may have caused, we too are enthusiastes and unaware of
newsgroup rules or etiquette.

We thought it would be helpful and beneficial to landrover
enthusiates, as we offer a fast friendly and cheap relaible service,
but if it upsets people we will no longer put anymore adverts on here.

Please except our oppolgies,

Ian.

I thought you got rid of that boat - I'm sure I saw it floating through
Oxford on the way to France :-)

Missed a trick there ;-)

Fair enough, and good on you for saying this.  There's no need to go and
hide.  This isn't a commercial group, although there are a fair few on here
who make a living out of LR spares, service and the like.  We've had several
discusions about it over the years, and the consensus is that anyone who
makes a useful contribution to the group in other ways (advice and
experience, mainly) are welcome to ply their trade discreetly.  If you do
this, you'll be made welcome.

So, hi.

Hi,

Yes i can understand this, hopefully if any body does decide to use
us, i hope they will be more than happy, we are not like others who
charge the earth for parts, we genuinly believe in keeping these cars
on the road.
It is more than a hobby for us breaking, this is not our main business
but just a side line we enjoy doing.

Thanks,

Ian.

Hi,

We do have a website www.htvm.co.uk , we did not want to advertise this
on here just incase there where some rules about doing so.

Thanks for replying back to us though.

&gt; Fair enough, and good on you for saying this.  There's no need to go and

Stick your website in your sig. line ... indeed having a working sig sep
will help ... and enter into a bit of discussion, especially if you can
help on 'awkward' questions.  ;)
