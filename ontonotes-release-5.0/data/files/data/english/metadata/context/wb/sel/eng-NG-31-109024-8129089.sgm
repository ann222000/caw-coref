Roman emperors on trial

Nero, Tiberius up for murder, immorality, death of Christ

(ANSA) - Rome, July 13 - Rome is putting two Ancient Roman emperors
on trial this summer for dark deeds including immorality, arson,
persecuting Christians and killing Jesus Christ.

In the mock open-air trials at the famed Basilica of Maxentius, actors
playing Nero and Tiberius will face historic charges that have brought
them ill fame.

The main indictment against Rome's third emperor Nero (37-68 AD) is
that he caused the great fire that devastated the city in 64 AD - and
then blamed it on the Christians.

He'll also be asked to answer for the murders of his mother and wife
and lax morality that started to eat away at the upstanding state.

His immediate predecessor Tiberius (42 BC-37 AD), the adopted son of
Augustus, faces a rap sheet saying he undermined what was left of the
Roman Constitution and later stomped off to seclusion on Capri leaving
his lieutenant Sejanus to run wild back in Rome.

Then there was the undeniable fact that Christ was crucified on his
watch.

Both emperors are expected to claim they were framed and slandered by
biased historians.

Tiberius is also likely to plead a mitigating circumstance familiar to
watchers of today's court TV - his actions and inactions were caused
by an untreated depression, probably the result of childhood trauma
inflicted by his charismatic stepfather and domineering mother Livia.

Each night from July 18 to 22, a 12-strong jury selected from among
the audience at the Roman ruins will decide how Nero should be judged.

Tiberius's historical reputation will be weighed by similar juries on
the nights of July 25 through 29.

The trials have been scripted by playwright Vladimir Polchi and
popular writer and journalist Corrado Augias.

&quot;We documented all the possible texts, classic and modern, from
Tacitus and Plutarch to modern Russian novelist Mikhail Bulgakov, who
wrote extensively about the early emperors,&quot; Augias said.

This summer will be the second time Nero has been put on trial.

He was convicted more often than not during last year's Emperors In
The Dock series, which proved highly popular with the summer crowds
here.

Juries were more lenient with his illustrious co-defendant Julius
Caesar, the war hero and dictator who detractors say dealt the death
blow to the old Roman Republic.

Somehow, you've butterflied Caligula and Claudius away and given their

54, when Claudius was murdered by his wife.

Maybe it's not OTL's Nero but Nero Caesar the son of Agrippina and
Germanicus perhaps kept alive by an earlier downfall of Sejanus. Maybe
Livia could poison Sejanus as her final act to save her son from
himself.  The claim that Nero murdered his mother is odd but perhaps in
the ATL she returned from exile and tried to take control.

For Nero Caesar to die in 68 is quite early as he would only be 62.  He
would have had to be killed as the few of his relatives who died
naturally lived to a ripe old age.

Wrong charge, from the sound of it.

Caesar's accession to power may have been
irregular , but his appointment as Dictator
by vote of the Roman Plebs was arguably
legal, and he treated his defeated oponents
leniently. His heir, Octavian (later
Augustus) behaved far worse, and, as a
Triumvir,  his proscriptions dealt a more
fatal blow to the Republic than those of his
adoptive father.

The best charge to being against Julius
would be _genocide_, against various Gallic
and German tribes.

As for Tiberius, I'm not sure that focusing
exclusively on the Crucifixion of Christ is
the best approach. In that era, there were
crucifixions left, right and centre of
Judeans who were actually or allegedly
subversive of Roman authority.  And those in
authority had no way of _knowing_ they were
executing the son of God. It's like trying
Hitler for the execution of _one_ particular
Pole (or whatever) who was later found to
have been Divine. They should have been had
up for _mass_ murder.

Murder was not a crime in ancient Rome, it was a civil offense. Read

Constantine I, Roman Emperor from 305-337 CE
needs to be brought to trial by a tribunal of ancient
historians for the fraudulent misrepresentation inherent
in his invention of christianity between the years 312-324,
and its implementation at his military supremacist council,
Nicaea, where the air was clear, in 325 CE.

The invention of christianity in the fourth century was
tendered with an Eusebian pseudo-history, and large
scale perversion and corruption of the patristic literature,
and the large scale forgery of diverse prenicene authors.

It was denounced immediately by Arius:

What were the words of Arius?

a.. There was time when He was not.
[Ed: He did not exist before Constantine.]

b.. Before He was born He was not.
[Ed: He is a fabrication.]

c.. He was made out of nothing existing.
[Ed: He is a fiction.]

d.. He is/was from another subsistence/substance.
[Ed: He is fictitious.]

e.. He is subject to alteration or change.
[Ed: He is fictitious, as are his gospels.]

Arius was poisoned the year Constantine first published
to bible.

After the rule of Constantine and his son Constantius,
christianity was again denounced at the earliest opportunity,
in 362 CE, when the Emperor Julian came to power.

Julian wrote that he was &quot;convinced that the fabrication
of the Galilaeans is a fiction of men
composed by wickedness&quot;.

His three books were burnt, all that remains of them are
Cyril's refutation thereof.  It is emminently arguable that
Julian actually named &quot;these wicked men&quot; (as Constantine
and Eusebius) and that this was the reason that many
were turned away from the church while Julian's treatise
survived.  Cyril admits it was very dangerous.

There are extant only two carbon dating citations with
respect to the field of new testament studies, being:

1) gThomas binding ... 350 CE
2) gJudas binding ... 280 CE +/- 60 years

Wake up ancient historians!  Would Arnaldo Momigliano
have used the word &quot;miracle&quot; twice to describe the
invention of what Eusebius describes as &quot;a new and
strange religion&quot;?

Must make Constantine one of the most
original thinkers of all time. It's as if
some 20/1C American evangelist had reached
the White House and then tried to promote
the worship of Benedict Arnold.

How could we all have overlooked this
obvious possibility?

Actually, the same task had been undertaken
100 years before Nicaea, when Ardashir, the
King of Kings who formed the nation of Iran,
created the Zoroastrian religion, and then
physically destroyed practically every single
line of writing from the Parthian civilisation.

Constantine was the very first person to have
published &quot;the bible&quot; in its complete context,
with the Hebrew texts bound together with the
new testament texts, circa 331 CE, the year
that he had Arius poisoned in a bog-house in
downtown Constantinople, the day before he
was to be received back into communion.

Constantine was a malevolent despot, who
edicted for the burning and destruction of the
writings of the leading academics in the empire,
and the immediate death penaly (by beheading)
for anyone cought secreting these writings.

Constantine INVENTED christianity, so that
he could rob and plunder the existing temples,
gold and lands of the Hellenic religions.

Seems a lot of effort to go to.

As Emperor, he could plunder anyone he
wanted. Why not plunder the temples in the
name of Sol Invictus, whose cult was the one
in favour with the Emperors before they gave
up on it and switched to Christianity?

Not so, I have heard it used in the correct sense on &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Constantine INVENTED christianity, so that
&gt;&gt; he could rob and plunder the existing
&gt; temples,
&gt;&gt; gold and lands of the Hellenic religions.

&gt; Seems a lot of effort to go to.

&gt; As Emperor, he could plunder anyone he
&gt; wanted. Why not plunder the temples in the
&gt; name of Sol Invictus, whose cult was the one
&gt; in favour with the Emperors before they gave
&gt; up on it and switched to Christianity?
">

Constantine had a weak spot for literature
and his lavish publication of the first christian
bibles c.331 CE gave him a monopoly on
the game.   No splitting business with any
existing Sol Invictus administrations.

His new Roman religious order needed basilicas
and bishops, and he was bishop of bishops.

It was Constantine who insisted on the inclusion
of the following verse in the NT:

&quot;Render unto Caesar the  things that are Caesars,
and unto god the things that are gods&quot;.

For the brigand Constantine
it was a win-win situation.

Well they'll just have to get used to it since the citation
is explicitly derived from the memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton.
