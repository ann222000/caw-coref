On an Elvis special the other night, he was introduced as &quot;Daughtry&quot; and the
punk &quot;tried&quot; to sing,even off key, &quot;Suspicious Minds.&quot; How dare an ugly bald
drunken looking punk
dare touch one of Elvis's greatest? In fact, it was his biggest selling
single of all time.

Heck, these &quot;American Idol&quot; shows are turning punk inept singers into
self-delusional megastars and what's worse is that the public is buying it.

His band is &quot;Daughtry,&quot; because that's his last name.

I thought his attempt was pathetic.  I didn't like any of the program,
at all, and decided it was just ABC being greedy trying to capitalize
on Elvis' death anniversary.

Do you have a link to post where I can hear Chris sing, as I didn't see
it on TV?  I  am a HUGE Elvis fan, and &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; was one of my
most favorite songs of his, and when Chris sang it during &quot;Elvis Week&quot;
in S5, it just absolutely blew me away....not everybody can imitate
Elvis and get away with it, but Chris nailed that song, and it was
beautiful, so I can't imagine that he butchered it on a TV special, and
would like to hear it for myself.

Maybe you just don't care for Chris? He and Ace were my Top 2 favorites
that season, and I can't wait for Ace's 1st CD to come out in a  few
days!  :o)

Oh god, is that coming out in a few days?  I haven't heard anything
about it outside of general &quot;yeah, it's coming soon&quot; remarks. Doesn't
bode well.
