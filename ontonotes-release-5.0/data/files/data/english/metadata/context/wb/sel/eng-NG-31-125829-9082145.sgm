Just on the off chance anyone has one knocking around they can sell me or
burn me a copy of. I can buy one from the US but I'd rather not have to wait
for international postage as I have 50 of these machines I want to get up,
running and sold. :)

Surely most people on here would take them unloaded (or is everyone here
too tight  ;-) )

Yep - I would have been interested. I was only asking about Portege 500s
a few days ago. But machines already loaded and ready to go are
certainly worth more to anyone who places a value on their time, as well
as those that simply can't sort machines out for themselves.

My primary sales outlet is Ebay and a fully set up laptop is worth a hell of
a lot more than an unloaded one on there. Especially if they are restored
using proper Tosh images and I can include a backup of the restore CD with
the laptop.

Also bearing in mind that these came in just as the laptops and with no
external drives, I am weighing up whether it would be feasable for me to buy
in a load of USB DVDRW drives to bundle with them or just advise buyers to
buy them from Ebay themselves. I notice someone is selling these bare for
£279 + VAT on Ebay at the moment (and selling them well at that price) so I
was thinking of £259 inclusive of VAT.....

Aye but mainstream people (who are my customers) don't like Linux... come to
think of it nor do I. :)
