Hi
I am posting here because I did not get a coherent answer from another news
group.
It degraded as usual into &quot;Don't go to X, Y or Z&quot;  for tyres

My question is ( to me ) a serious concern.

Christmas is coming and I am thinking of what to buy the car drivers.

I have just been watching a TV selling channel advocating the use of a
sealant  you put into the tyre. In the event of a puncture it is instantly
sealed and you don't have to change a tyre.. Fantastic.

Now some new cars including Land Rover do not supply a spare tyre. Many
people may be encouraged to use this type of sealant.

My fear is you pick up a nail and it stays in the tyre for ever and then one
day the tyre fails big time.

As you die in the accident you don't have a chance to complain to the
manufacturer so they don't have a problem. Are there any statistics relating
to the safety of this product or does anyone have direct experience.

Before anyone comes back with &quot; You should inspect your tyres every day, bla
bla bla. &quot; in the real world how often to you do this? What if a nail goes
into the inner sidewall and you just cant see it. Surely this is a serious
accident just waiting to happen

Like I said, you don't keep driving until the tyre bursts, you get it
changed ASAP. That's what it says on the tin. Or at least I bet that's what
it says on the tin having never used that sort of stuff.[1]. And the tyre
changing people will *love* you for putting it into your tyres.

IIRC there's one available that the manufacturers claim is used in one
variant by the US military - stays in the tyre permanently, and can
plug multiple bullet holes (also good for motorbike tyres I believe) -

You are missing the point

If this product works as they say. You will not know anything about a
puncture. So you will continue to drive potentially with several punctures.
So how safe is that ?

All sorts of things can cause a catastrophic failure of a tyre.  They're
not all that common thankfully though.  I don't see how suffering a blow
out from several nails that have been in my sealant-ed tyre for aeons
and suffering a blow out in an unsealant-ed tyre are going to be all
that different.

I don't check my tyres every day, but a tyre can suffer a catastrophic
failure for whatever reason whether there is some sort of magic sealant
product in it or not.

If you're worried about it, don't use it.  Join the AA, don't use tyre
sealant and have 'safe' tyre failures.

Personally, I've never tried, but a) I honestly don't think tyre sealant
would keep a tyre inflated in those circumstances and b) if it did, the
imbalance caused by a 6 inch nail at 100mph would be pretty noticeable
so I'd probably not be very happy and I'd probably stop.

&gt; All sorts of things can cause a catastrophic failure of a tyre.  They're
&gt; not all that common thankfully though.  I don't see how suffering a blow
&gt; out from several nails that have been in my sealant-ed tyre for aeons and
&gt; suffering a blow out in an unsealant-ed tyre are going to be all that
&gt; different.

&gt;&gt; As you die in the accident you don't have a chance to complain to the
&gt;&gt; manufacturer so they don't have a problem. Are there any statistics
&gt;&gt; relating
&gt;&gt; to the safety of this product or does anyone have direct experience.

&gt; No.  How can anyone have any direct experience?  They're dead and couldn't
&gt; tell anyone remember.

&gt;&gt; Before anyone comes back with &quot; You should inspect your tyres every day,
&gt;&gt; bla
&gt;&gt; bla bla. &quot; in the real world how often to you do this? What if a nail
&gt;&gt; goes
&gt;&gt; into the inner sidewall and you just cant see it. Surely this is a
&gt;&gt; serious
&gt;&gt; accident just waiting to happen

&gt; I don't check my tyres every day, but a tyre can suffer a catastrophic
&gt; failure for whatever reason whether there is some sort of magic sealant
&gt; product in it or not.

&gt; If you're worried about it, don't use it.  Join the AA, don't use tyre
&gt; sealant and have 'safe' tyre failures.

Yes I have made my choice.
Not to use

But the sales information suggests that it will.
Even if the nail dislodges the compound will fill the hole without any loss

&gt;&gt;&gt; a nail is visable, but is the tyre sealant visable once you get a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am posting here because I did not get a coherent answer from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; news
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It degraded as usual into &quot;Don't go to X, Y or Z&quot;  for tyres

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My question is ( to me ) a serious concern.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Christmas is coming and I am thinking of what to buy the car drivers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have just been watching a TV selling channel advocating the use of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sealant  you put into the tyre. In the event of a puncture it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; instantly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sealed and you don't have to change a tyre.. Fantastic.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Until you get to the tyre fitters and they whack you with a massive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bill for cleaning the shite off the rim.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, and you can only run for a short distance. They're a &quot;get you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; home&quot; not a permanent fix.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not prejudiced. I hate everyone equally.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You are missing the point

&gt;&gt;&gt; If this product works as they say. You will not know anything about a
&gt;&gt;&gt; puncture. So you will continue to drive potentially with several
&gt;&gt;&gt; punctures.
&gt;&gt;&gt; So how safe is that ?

&gt;&gt; About the same as having a nail in the tyre that doesn't leak. What's
&gt;&gt; your
&gt;&gt; point?

&gt; How safe is it to drive with that nail in a tyre?
&gt; How long until a catastrophic failure ?
&gt; I don't know that's why I am asking the question.
">

The catastrophic failure is caused by the tyre going flat, not the nail.

Well most of the vehicles that we use around the wood working shop run on
tire sealant &amp; their tyres wear out &amp; get replaced due to lack of tread,
not catastrophic failure. Or sidewall damage. Repairing holes with plugs

&gt;&gt;&gt; It degraded as usual into &quot;Don't go to X, Y or Z&quot;  for tyres

&gt;&gt;&gt; My question is ( to me ) a serious concern.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Christmas is coming and I am thinking of what to buy the car drivers.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have just been watching a TV selling channel advocating the use of a
&gt;&gt;&gt; sealant  you put into the tyre. In the event of a puncture it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; instantly
&gt;&gt;&gt; sealed and you don't have to change a tyre.. Fantastic.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now some new cars including Land Rover do not supply a spare tyre. Many
&gt;&gt;&gt; people may be encouraged to use this type of sealant.

&gt;&gt;&gt; My fear is you pick up a nail and it stays in the tyre for ever and
&gt;&gt;&gt; then
&gt;&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt;&gt; day the tyre fails big time.

&gt;&gt; All sorts of things can cause a catastrophic failure of a tyre.  They're
&gt;&gt; not all that common thankfully though.  I don't see how suffering a blow
&gt;&gt; out from several nails that have been in my sealant-ed tyre for aeons
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; suffering a blow out in an unsealant-ed tyre are going to be all that
&gt;&gt; different.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As you die in the accident you don't have a chance to complain to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; manufacturer so they don't have a problem. Are there any statistics
&gt;&gt;&gt; relating
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the safety of this product or does anyone have direct experience.

&gt;&gt; No.  How can anyone have any direct experience?  They're dead and
&gt;&gt; couldn't
&gt;&gt; tell anyone remember.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Before anyone comes back with &quot; You should inspect your tyres every
&gt;&gt;&gt; day,
&gt;&gt;&gt; bla
&gt;&gt;&gt; bla bla. &quot; in the real world how often to you do this? What if a nail
&gt;&gt;&gt; goes
&gt;&gt;&gt; into the inner sidewall and you just cant see it. Surely this is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; serious
&gt;&gt;&gt; accident just waiting to happen

&gt;&gt; I don't check my tyres every day, but a tyre can suffer a catastrophic
&gt;&gt; failure for whatever reason whether there is some sort of magic sealant
&gt;&gt; product in it or not.

&gt;&gt; If you're worried about it, don't use it.  Join the AA, don't use tyre

&gt;&gt; Your probably right .

&gt;&gt; However as more cars are supplied without any spare wheel at all. The
&gt;&gt; temptation to use such a sealant will be more as time goes on. One death
&gt;&gt; will be too many. I am just asking for anyone with an informed opinion to
&gt;&gt; come forward and say what they think or know about the product.. So far
&gt;&gt; no
&gt;&gt; one has given an informed opinion so no postings are worth taking any
&gt;&gt; notice
&gt;&gt; of.

&gt; Well most of the vehicles that we use around the wood working shop run on
&gt; tire sealant &amp; their tyres wear out &amp; get replaced due to lack of tread,
&gt; not catastrophic failure. Or sidewall damage. Repairing holes with plugs
&gt; is common practice.
">

Yes. However if your tyre is punctured too close to a side wall they will
not repair it. Why is that the case? If a tyre with sealant in it is
punctured in the same place why is it ok to continue to drive on that tyre?

Because of the way a tyre is constucted. A puncture in the sidewall is
pretty much guaranteed to have damaged the bands that are in it.

OK
So you say a repaired tyre is more safe.
With the type of product I am referring to, you don't know you have a
puncture, so you cant repair it. Therefore is the tyre in this condition
more or less dangerous.
Sorry if I am being pedantic but the product I am referring to is put into
all the tyres on your car so in the event of a puncture, the tyre is
instantly sealed without you knowing anything about it. That could result in
say a nail puncturing a sidewall. You know nothing about it and continue to
use the vehicle.
I was interested to know if any &quot;Experts&quot; ( tyre technicians ) had any
experience of this type of occurrence and what their views where.
I thought it was a reasonable question.

If it's in the centre of the tread I've found screws with most of the head
worn away &amp; the tyre still fully inflated. Relying on the tyre going flat
isn't a usefull way of preventing tyre damage. They're particularly good

&gt;&gt; OK so are you saying that a tyre with a repair is less safe or les
&gt;&gt; likely
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; create a problem than a tyre being kept inflated by the sealant?

&gt; A tyre with a repair is more safe and less likely to create a problem.
&gt; Also when it comes to replacement time, you'll find it £30 cheaper to
&gt; fit.

&gt; OK
&gt; So you say a repaired tyre is more safe.
&gt; With the type of product I am referring to, you don't know you have a
&gt; puncture, so you cant repair it. Therefore is the tyre in this condition
&gt; more or less dangerous.
&gt; Sorry if I am being pedantic but the product I am referring to is put
&gt; into
&gt; all the tyres on your car so in the event of a puncture, the tyre is
&gt; instantly sealed without you knowing anything about it. That could
&gt; result in
&gt; say a nail puncturing a sidewall. You know nothing about it and continue
&gt; to
&gt; use the vehicle.
&gt; I was interested to know if any &quot;Experts&quot; ( tyre technicians ) had any
&gt; experience of this type of occurrence and what their views where.
&gt; I thought it was a reasonable question.

TYre technicians aren't normally experts in that subject, you'd want VOSA.

Because tyre fitters are infinitely more qualified than mechanics
aren't they?

Look, you came to this newsgroup which has a load of very knowledgeable
people on it, asked their opinions, then procede to ask stupid questions and
insult the.people whose opinions you're seeking.

You have already been told the pros and cons of it umpteen times, even I
told you (politely) shortly after you posted your original post. Just how
intelligent are you?

&gt;&gt; So what you are saying is, Continuing to drive with a nail in a tyre will
&gt;&gt; not cause any further damage.

&gt; Correct. The damage has already been done.
">

I think that's a bit of a 'blanket' statement. Just because the nail has
gone in there and done *some* damage, which may or may not cause the tyre to
deflate at the time, it does not mean that the damage so caused, will not
get worse as the tyre continues to be used. If one stitch on the arse of
your jeans breaks, you might get a small unnoticeable hole. If you then bend
over, it might tear open all the way up ...

&gt;&gt;&gt; So how happy are you to drive a car at say 100 MPH with a 6inch nail in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the the side wall of your tyre ?

&gt;&gt; &lt;shrug&gt;
&gt;&gt; If it's holding air, quite happy.

&gt;&gt; Not that it will hold air with a 6&quot; nail in the sidewall, of course...
&gt; But the sales information suggests that it will.
&gt; Even if the nail dislodges the compound will fill the hole without any
&gt; loss of pressure. so you now have a punctured tyre but don't know it !
">

Well, if the sealant has done it's job, and set in the hole, then strictly
speaking, you don't have a punctured tyre ...

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi
&gt;&gt;&gt; I am posting here because I did not get a coherent answer from another
&gt;&gt;&gt; news group.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It degraded as usual into &quot;Don't go to X, Y or Z&quot;  for tyres

&gt;&gt;&gt; My question is ( to me ) a serious concern.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Christmas is coming and I am thinking of what to buy the car drivers.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have just been watching a TV selling channel advocating the use of a
&gt;&gt;&gt; sealant  you put into the tyre. In the event of a puncture it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; instantly
&gt;&gt;&gt; sealed and you don't have to change a tyre.. Fantastic.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now some new cars including Land Rover do not supply a spare tyre. Many
&gt;&gt;&gt; people may be encouraged to use this type of sealant.

&gt;&gt;&gt; My fear is you pick up a nail and it stays in the tyre for ever and then
&gt;&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt;&gt; day the tyre fails big time.

&gt;&gt; All sorts of things can cause a catastrophic failure of a tyre.  They're
&gt;&gt; not all that common thankfully though.  I don't see how suffering a blow
&gt;&gt; out from several nails that have been in my sealant-ed tyre for aeons and
&gt;&gt; suffering a blow out in an unsealant-ed tyre are going to be all that
&gt;&gt; different.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As you die in the accident you don't have a chance to complain to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; manufacturer so they don't have a problem. Are there any statistics
&gt;&gt;&gt; relating
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the safety of this product or does anyone have direct experience.

&gt;&gt; No.  How can anyone have any direct experience?  They're dead and
&gt;&gt; couldn't tell anyone remember.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Before anyone comes back with &quot; You should inspect your tyres every day,
&gt;&gt;&gt; bla
&gt;&gt;&gt; bla bla. &quot; in the real world how often to you do this? What if a nail
&gt;&gt;&gt; goes
&gt;&gt;&gt; into the inner sidewall and you just cant see it. Surely this is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; serious
&gt;&gt;&gt; accident just waiting to happen

&gt;&gt; I don't check my tyres every day, but a tyre can suffer a catastrophic
&gt;&gt; failure for whatever reason whether there is some sort of magic sealant
&gt;&gt; product in it or not.

&gt;&gt; If you're worried about it, don't use it.  Join the AA, don't use tyre
&gt;&gt; sealant and have 'safe' tyre failures.

&gt;&gt; --
&gt;&gt; Douglas
&gt; Yes I have made my choice.
&gt; Not to use

&gt; As no one seems to have any conception of what the implications of using
&gt; this product are

&gt; I think this product is a potential killer.

&gt; Hope I don't meet you coming upside down in the opposite direction ))
">

I think that speed bumps are a potential killer. How many motorway smashups
are caused by steering or suspension failures brought on by the person
living on an estate with 4&quot; high carriageway obstructions every few yards,
that he has to drive over every day ? They damage tyres and throw off
tracking, and I would have thought pose a far more serious 'hidden' hazard
than tyre sealant.
