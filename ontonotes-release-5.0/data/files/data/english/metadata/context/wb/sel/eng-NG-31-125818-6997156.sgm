Hi, I have the above router, which is all set up with VPN and works exactly
the way I want.  How can I find out (in advance) if it will work on any of
Thailand's ADSL networks?  From what I can establish, most users have a
network router.  The telephone connection on the wall socket, is an
International-style socket.  It works with a 56k UK dial-up modem, if that's
any help.

I doubt that the connection itself is any problem - after all, a lot of UK
telecoms equipment is provided with an International connector, and then an
adapter to suit BT.

Provided you have the correct lead to plug into the wall it will work.
