certain folk, accompanied with the blinkered inward attitude that is
favoured by those group members. Whilst, I fully realize that the majority

recently, that non-American questions and comments, while treated with a
polite political correctness are at the same time not taken that seriously,
and seem from some quarters to be somewhat tiresome as well as unrelated to
this ''antique'' ng group, unless of course it happens to suit or fit into
the, American context at the time, or provides the answer to 'the how much
is it worth' question.

IMHO the subject of antiques should be viewed in a world wide perspective,
this seems fairly obvious to me, as influences passed from one country to
the next, and much of what you people appear to have, or think you have
originated somewhere else to start of with. Alas that doesn't appear the
attitude held by certain group members, that are only interested in
discussions from their own backyard and are happy to retain it at this
level. So, with that in mind I shall remove myself from this merry band and
put my efforts into the other ngs that I read, where discussion and
comments are welcomed from non-Americans and those discussions are put
correctly into a world wide context.

As the shepherd said to his dog, it's time to get the flock out of here. I
wish you and your fellow cohorts well in your campaign to rid this ng of
all the undireables, but find it sad that this inward thinking attitude
exists, which is so alien to the many folk throughout the rest of the world
that have a genuine love and passion for art and antiques and are willing
to explore and expand their minds beyond the State they live in.

I can't believe how much 'supportive' mail I've received on my decision
to take a hike ( I mean a break) Thank you all for caring so much about

"/> Your original question, as best I recall it, was whether quarter-sawn
oak was the same as wainscotting, or whether the latter term has a
different meaning in the U.S. I responded to the second part of your
question with what I still consider to be the appropriate answer when
someone asks me what a word means in America: a definition from a
prominent American dictionary.

So I'm not sure just what wide and far-ranging discussion you wanted.
If you wanted to discuss whether there is a historical link between what
you all call wainscot and what we call quarter-sawn, I'd be delighted to
read that discussion, tho I certainly couldn't contribute to it. But it
doesn't help that discussion along for you to chastise those of us on
this side of the ocean for using the term &quot;wainscot&quot; differently than
you do.

If you wanted a discussion of how the immigrants from Britain and
Ireland forgot, over a course of a few centuries, what &quot;wainscot&quot; meant
in their homelands and began using the term in a different manner, I
think the answer is rather obvious. But if you want a scholarly
discussion of the obvious, someone here might oblige you or refer you to
a linguistics NG.

Whatever discussion you wanted, the way to get it wasn't to chastise
those of us who answered your question about what the term &quot;wainscot&quot;
means in America, but to tell us what it means over there and what you
think the connection between that and quarter-sawn might be.

Whilst, I fully realize that the majority

"/> Personally, I find the clash of cultures stimulating, except when I get
the sense that some of the folks &quot;over there&quot; regard comparison of
American vs. British/Irish differences as an opportunity to tell us
Americans how we're doing it all wrong, or using the wrong terminology.

STOCKS: devices for punishment (usually in the town square) where
offenders were put on public display on wooden 'stocks' which had holes
for their hands &amp; feet (and sometimes heards). Since Ronnie left,i

reconsider....When I was a newbie, maybe ten or so months ago, it was he
who politely...and it was politely...encouraged me to take part and to
come out of lurkville. I have been amazed at the depth of knowledge he
contributes. We need many more like Ronnie. One can go to any old flea
market in the world and hear stories about Granny's china and hear the
&quot;how muches&quot; but, in how many places can one find people with real
knowledge that they are willing to share.
I didn't see the earlier exchange to which he referred, but it is
important to realize that this group is worldwide in scope and not just
United States oriented.

Hi (or is it bye) Ronnie,
I don't believe you will really leave this group. I have been lurking and
reading your posts for quite a while now. You are extremely knowledgeable. You
are also extremely rude. You like to stir it up and spread it on. You have
offended many people. You like it, it's what you do. I don't think you are
through with this group yet. Actually, I find most of your posts rather
amusing. I know you can dish it out. However, can you take it? I guess we'll
see.

certainly beat a hasty retreat. I don't know about the nail holes and thorn

Dear John-Henry and Kristine Reeves,
I quite understand your position. I am not in the habit of attacking anyone. I
don't know how long you have been reading this newsgroup, but Ronnie has waged
very personal attacks upon quite a few people here over a long period of time. He
is a bully plain and simple, very knowledgeable, very articulate , but a bully
just the same. He has intimidated many people who post here and discouraged many
others from posting here. He is hurtful to others for the sake of feeding his
bloated, tick like ego. Egos like his are plentiful throughout the newsgroups.
What makes him special is his knowledge of antiques. Unfortunately, he enjoys
intimidating others just for laughs. I respect your feelings regarding my post. I
am sorry if I offended you. I am not sorry I said what I did. I believe he more
than deserved it, and I won't miss him. What he contributed to this group was not
worth the toll he extracted. This is of course, just my opinion.
Sincerely, RM

&gt;&gt; Yes, it does sound like a threat. However, I do respect your opinion. I just don't
&gt;&gt; share your opinion of Ronnie. Sorry if you don't like it. People who post in this
&gt;&gt; group or any group should not even be considered in the context of being
&gt;&gt;&quot;targets&quot;. However, that was Ronnies style. He hung the bullseyes around here, not
&gt;&gt; me.
&gt;&gt; RM

&gt; I was afraid I had not been clear on what I meant. I believe that when
&gt; you post to any ng, you are providing an opportunity for anyone to
&gt; challenge the accuracy of your facts or the validity of your opinions.
&gt; These challenges may come from someone better informed than you are or
&gt; someone totally clueless that just likes a good fight. If you don't
&gt; realize this in advance, you are probably going to be very upset the
&gt; first time someone tells you you are a #%~*{&gt; idiot.

&gt; I am not saying this type of posting is helpful or has any merit. I am
&gt; merely saying it exists. Be prepared for it.

&gt; I didn't mean to imply that I &quot;don't like&quot; your opinion of Ronnie or
&gt; anything else for that matter. I agree or disagree with opinions. I
&gt; don't &quot;like or dislike&quot; them. Maybe the next time you post something, I
&gt; will post a follow-up telling you how you were &quot;right on&quot;. Who knows!

"/> Actually, I did post something to that effect a long time ago, but
'twas from my cleveland.FREEnet.aka.you-get-what-you-pay-for.edu account,
and it was lost forever.

Frankly, Doug's posts often make me laugh. If you can't see his
tongue planted in his cheek, you're not looking closely enough.
He goes too far sometimes, but then we can just shake our heads
and ignore him. Or sometimes we give him a whack on the side of
the head via e-mail, can't we Doug-o?

What I definitely miss is some of the useful info Doug has posted
here over the past few months, if you don't count the $100 offer
for every what's-it-worth question. :) Why do I say that? Because
Doug usually goes beyond the pat &quot;price guide&quot; answer and includes
further info, like the phone number of an expert or other info..

I can say this publically because I've said it to Doug privately:
I enjoy having him around enough that I put up with his goofy
lapses, sorta like how I put up with my dog's occasional puddle
on the floor because he's such a lovely old pooch in other ways.

What I don't miss is the &quot;He pushed me first.&quot;&quot;Did not! He PINCHED
me!&quot; type of posts from the BOTH of you. Go to your rooms.

&gt;Kris

"/> Exactly correct, Kris-

I don't recall RM providing any helpful information to any of the posters here
but he seems intent on an Ad Hominem attack on Mr. McKinley as he can't quarrel
with his scholarship or resources of descriptions and dates. Given the clear
fact that he's long been making a living as a legitimate antiques dealer in a
country where you're not sure that when you go to town in the morning that
you'll not come back in a body bag at sundown and still takes the time to
discuss politics, royalty succession, the impact of the Industrial Revolution,
whether the Hawley-Smoot Tariff act triggered the last Depression,
manufacturing history of lots of obscure china makers in a clear and literate
fashion, I don't see any of that as the definition of a &quot;Bully&quot;. Bullies
physically intimidate people but how can somebody threaten you with mere words,
facts, or ideas? Are you saying that he can fire a stream of ideas or facts at
you, that, given the resources of your own files, the local library or even the
Internet you can't counter with a cogent reply in maybe 48 hours? While that
may leave you flat-footed, the fault is yours, not his. If there is a
complaint, maybe it's that he entered into a war of intellect with an unarmed
man.

Yes, he rags on David and I've tried in the past to point out that David has
come a long way in this group and has taken a fair amount of criticism standing
up as a man and has hung in here when he could have taken his bat and gone
home. As to Doug, we're pretty much convinced that there are 3 fun loving ones
of them taking turns on his Web TV keyboard but among the many &quot;I'll give you
$100&quot; messages are a lot of very specific gems of &quot;call this guy-he'll be able
to help you value your 14th century doorstop&quot; He's got a hell of a Rolodex that
didn't just fall into his lap- he had to do a lot of digging on stuff he made a
killing on and things he never wants to hear about again. He also seems to be a
working dealer in the trenches every day not knowing if today a proposed
bombing raid showing on CNN will cause shoppers at his place to drop by 70%.
And on top of it all he can be pretty funny- and I'll bet when the rec.antiques
message board shows Doug's name you start trying to predict what he's going to
say before opening his message.

If you page back and forth on the wild variety of folks that don't want Ronnie
to leave or have supported him in the past, I'd say that's an endorsement that
speaks for itself. In US terms it would be like Ralph Reed, Barry Goldwater,
Ross Perot, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Tim McVeigh, Laura Schlesinger, Jerry
Falwell, Ralph Nader, Gennifer Flowers, Jessie Helms, Jessie Jackson, and
Howard Stern all agreeing on who they want to be their seminar leader in a 3
day Teach In at the Newark (NJ) Day's Inn with a banquet at Denny's.

Since you seem concerned that Ron's postings drive people away from leaving
queries here why don't you give your personal war a rest or take it to private
e-mail with him and open up some bandwidth for civilians looking for answers to
real questions.

&gt; download their senseless crap via email. Although, it would be very
&gt; intriguing and tempting to know exactly what RM (or JM) would have in the
&gt; way of instruction and training for little old me. Maybe he/she has some
&gt; other subject in mind .... like train-spotting.

"/> Ronnie, Teaching you anything would require two things from you, the capacity to learn
andan open mind. I'm not sure you have either.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think it's about time RM (or JM) cut all this crap, he/she is simply,
&gt; pissed-off, that I (and others) rebuked their original condescending
&gt; post that started this thread.

"/> What I'm pissed off about Ronnie is you. The way you treat people, The way you pass
judgement on people you don't know. You are extremely rude for no good reason. You
don't seem to be doing all that well in this group yourself you know. You were bailing
out just a few days ago.Why is that? Is it that some Americans are just too narrow
minded? Should we adjust to *you*Ronnie? Maybe you should take a hard look at
yourself, are you really as smart as you think you are?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now it's time to WISE-UP and get over it RM
&gt; (orJM) you are a becoming tiresome bore, and in danger of making a total
&gt; dick of yourself. Next time you want to say something make sure you lift
&gt; your bum off the seat, that way, at least you may be semi- coherent, in the
&gt; meantime as I said before, get yourself a life or at least POST something
&gt; that just happens to be on the TOPIC of antiques and collectibles.

"/> I have no desire to continue this thread. I also see it as a waste of time.RM

As a newcomer to the group, I'd like to cast my vote for beginning all
personal hate posts with the prefix &quot;DIATRIBE:&quot;. This would make it easier
for those of us interested in the group's real subject matter - antiques -
to set up a filter against it.

"/> HI Scot ;) welcome aboard the merry-go-round ..... DIATRIBE you say? you
do realize that this is supposed to be a &quot;discussion&quot; ng on a passionate
(to some) - subject of antiques and collecting. So you are saying that,
forceful verbal attack and criticism shouldn't enter into a passionate
debate or when someone is clearly misleading others with incorrect
information? IMO you really don't need the DIATRIBE, you either skip the
thread, or killfile the author's email address by using your news-reader's
software. anyway DIATRIBE isn't a great choice of word, I could think of a
better one :) - it has different meaning to different people, or depending
if one is perhaps using Webster's :)

..... so mckin ... @netcomuk.co.uk .... should do the trick nicely ... I'm
the only netcomuk here at the moment, so y'a should miss much :-)

well, ronnie, if you're going to stick around you might as well make
yourself useful.

maybe you can help me identify this item that i bought on ebay:

it is plastic, basically the shape of a salami, and is marked on the bottom
&quot;Vibra-Joy, 3 speed model&quot;. it is also engraved &quot;To Ronnie M., from C.
Kehoe, Tonquish Creek&quot;. There are some serial numbers, but they are hard
to read because of a crusty substance that obscures them.

oh yes-- ex collection Dodi Fayed.

(dear reader- the sound you hear is ronnie's chair tipping over and
crashing to the ground as he rushes to look under his bed, frantically
searching for the box of &quot;what nots&quot; that he has cleverly marked 'OLD SHOES
ONLY--DO NOT OPEN--NOTHING HERE BUT SHOES')

Charles,
I suspect that if there's anyone that would know about 3-speed crusty
dildos hidden under their bed,it would be YOU. IMO
Can't get the real thing? Nobody wants to touch you ,even with a 10'

Try some industrial strength Janitor In A Drum

When you are trying to identify an unknown item, either antique or
modern, you are always better off if you can find someone with
experience in that particular items use. They will be able to tell you
where to find such information as manufacturer, model number, serial
number etc. We can always learn from others personal experience.

You're a loser Ronnie. I greatly overestimated you. You have nothing going for you, anyone
could sit in a corner and accomplish what you do. All they would need is, no consideration
for others, access to some resourse material, and no real life. I've had you pegged all
along. I knew you couldn't leave this group. LOL. Your ego wouldn't let you. I don't blame
you, you can't help yourself. I hope you will seek professional help and receive it, there
is always hope for you, and your sad little life. So, post away Ronnie. Feed your ego at
others expense. Continue to wear out your tired routine. This is really the best you've got
to offer isn't it?
What a waste.
To anyone who has been wasting their time following this thread, rest assured, this is my
last post in this thread. However, I'm sure Ronnie won't spare anyone another of his
brilliant emissions. Fire away Ronnie. Try to demonstrate to everyone what a superior
individual you are. Who knows, if your're convincing enough maybe even *you* will believe
it, but I doubt it.
