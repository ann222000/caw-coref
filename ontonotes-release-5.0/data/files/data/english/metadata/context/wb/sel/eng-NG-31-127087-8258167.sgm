Today's question is being brought to you by our very own mystery poster :)

Do you make a shopping list or just try and remember what you need?

Both: I generally forget to take the (usually incomplete) shopping
list to the shops with me. That or I put in down &quot;for just a second&quot;
while climbing the shelves to reach something from the higher er-
*levels* of shopping. :-)

Make out a shopping list, but some times leave it home by mistake.  :-)

My wife makes up the shopping list and if something is left off, it doesn't
get bought!

I always make a list, but sometimes forget to put something on it, and
sometimes I forget the list.

You reminded me of something I did today when shopping. I had 4 items in my
shopping buggy (the one I bring from home), and took them out so I could put
in a 24 pack bottles of water, then forgot to put the previous stuff which I
put on another pack of water back into my shopping buggy. When I got home, I
realized I forgot the 4 items which I needed more than the water, and had to
get my car from my underground parking and go back to the store. Arghhhh. So
annoying when I do that. My items were still sitting at the place I left
them.

This sounds pretty normal to me. I've topped that by getting
shopping from a few different shops, stopping to shift stuff from
three bags to two and *throwing away the bag with the most
expensive items in it away*...! My mind was on another plane, I
felt sooo stupid afterwards and the bin I'd thrown the bag in
wasn't one I could get my stuff back out of either.

If I'm making something specific, I take a list, otherwise we go aisle by
aisle.

I can remember what I need, but I can't always remember what my mother
needs. So she makes up a list. About 1/2 of the stuff on her list we already
have and don't need. So I rewrite her list.

She used to go shopping with me, but she uses the shopping cart as a means
of support. She leans on it. So I just do all the shopping by myself now so
I can get out of Safeway as fast as humanly possible.

Haha. That's funny. Well, if I see you in SF and we meet in a grocery store,
I will make sure to ask you to get something for me on a high shelf. I'm
short - short in stature and money :) If I can't reach something and can't
find any staff who are re-stocking shelves, I ask anyone who is taller than
me, which is a lot of people.

Ackkk.... You're right. Thats worse than what I did today, but I've left
items in a bag and thrown them away by mistake, but nothing very expensive.
I hope you didn't throw away anything that cost too much...Why couldn't you
get the bag from the bin? do you mean the garbage bin and the garbage guys
picked up that bin?

Too bad I don't like wine. There might be other things I like there though
:). I've always liked the look of SF in movies. Looks quite beautiful. I
like the cable cars, though I am too out of shape to run after them. The
high ground with the ocean in the background looks niceYou seem to exercise
a lot more than me so are probably in much better shape than me. I would
like to see SF.

Well, height is not everything you know :) Height has a lot to do with
heredity, like looks. So you take what you get from your parents. I always
seemed to end up with tall men. My brothers were only about 5ft 6&quot; and my
sister was about the same as me. My mother was only about 5 ft. My father
was taller, maybe around 5ft. 8. He died when I was 2 years old and I don't
have a lot of photos of him. But my cousins on my fathers side, especially
the males, were fairly tall. My two daughters take after me and are short
and petite , though I am not as petite as when I was younger, but am medium.
My son is 5 ft. 11, and took after my husband so it worked out ok. I've
never had a desire to be any height other than what I am except when buying
clothes, when even petite pants are too long. That bugs me.

I like to think of the song &quot;5 feet two, eyes of blue, but oh what 5 feet
two can do&quot; - :)

Chip, its quite coincidental, but I had never heard of the Valley of the
Moon till you mentioned it and last night I was watching a DVD of &quot;Charlie's
Angels&quot; - the TV series from the 1970's which I used to watch every week,
not the one from 2000 with isn't nearly as good, and was a movie. I have
Season 1 DVD's and in one episode, the Angels are hired to go to Valley of
the Moon to investigate the disappearance of some guy in the wine industry.
There is a big mansion in the opening part of the episode. I haven't
finished it all yet. I thought it was quite funny to see it on a DVD the day
you mentioned it. I think I would like to see SF more than wine country. The
scenery in SF appeals to me - from movies I've seen. Also, I like the ocean.
Didn't you live in SF before? was that where your practice was?

Since you are going to get any high shelf items I need, you don't need to

Sometimes I do make a list and other times I don't. If it's something
I don't normally run out of or need, yes, definitely I have to make a
list or I'll never remember it.

Mary, I lived in SF from 1965 thru 1991. I was an M.D. from 1970 up to now

SF has gone downhill alot since I first lived there. More congested with
traffic, and the streets seem dirtier.

I've lived up here in the wine country with my mother for the last year.
Ever since my father died. I love it. Feed the deer every night. Tonight
several deer came into our backyard to eat some food I left outside for
them. There was a mother and her fawn.

Also I saw what I thought was a black cat, till he started moving, and I
could see the white stripe down his back (skunk).

Maybe you are not quiet as I always thought. And I am not convinced that you

I only saw part of the movie, but I wasn't interested. The original
Charlie's Angels on TV in the 70's was much better and Farah Fawcett and
other actresses were more in my generation. I liked the glamorous clothes
they wore on the show and the scenery of places they went to. Much more
glamorous than the young movie stars of today. I don't know half of them and

nearby.  What I don't like is the busy traffic and hot weather in the

Yes, I am Scittish born and emigrated to Canada with my family when I just

back as I know. Maybe back as far as the Celts or the Picts. The Celts were
Scottish and Irish people. Many nationalities invaded Britain back to Roman
times, so who knows where most of us came from. Lots of people in Canada and
the US have Scottish ancestors. Was the great great grandmother on your
fathers or mothers side? Do you know where they lived in Scotland? I lived
on the mid/east coast of Scotland, near Edinburgh, which is the capital. The
town I grew up in was an ancient and historic town. A very interesting
place. I was there 4 years ago for two weeks and enjoyed it very much. I
hadn't been back for a long time. I have relatives there, mostly second
cousins. I would like to travel a lot more than I have done.I always liked
geography and to know what other countries are like.

Is it hot this week where you are located? Its been in the 90's every day
this week with high humidity which eventually usually causes  severe
thunderstorms. Its very hot here in summer, especially July and August. I
don't like the heat so I don't go out some days in the summer.  The humidity
is the worst. I would be better suited to the climate of the west coast such
as Victoria, BC, but houses or condos are the most expensive to buy in
Canada. Prices are bad enough where I am.

&gt; &gt; You said before you practices for 25 years. What year did you stop
&gt; &gt; practicing?

&gt; 1996

Thats not so long ago.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Both anxiety and depression got in the way.

&gt; &gt; Was that the end of your career?

&gt; Yes

How did you manage to work with anxiety and depression for 25 years? (Nosy,
aren't I?) :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Mary, aren't you from Scotland?  My great great grandmother was from
&gt; &gt; &gt; Scotland.

&gt; &gt; Yes, I am Scottish born and emigrated to Canada with my family when I
just
&gt; &gt; turned 16. My mother and father and all my ancestors were Scottish as
far
&gt; &gt; back as I know. Maybe back as far as the Celts or the Picts. The Celts
&gt; were
&gt; &gt; Scottish and Irish people. Many nationalities invaded Britain back to
&gt; Roman
&gt; &gt; times, so who knows where most of us came from. Lots of people in Canada
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; the US have Scottish ancestors. Was the great great grandmother on your
&gt; &gt; fathers or mothers side?

&gt; on my mother's side. I have a red mustache, which I figure came from my
&gt; Scotish ancestor.
">

I saw your picture one time on ASAP and dioesn't look like you have any
mustache. Some men seem to have red mustaches that I've seen but their hair
isn't red. Or some have gray mustaches when their hair is still black. I
think there are more Irish people who have red hair than Scottish, though
some Scottish people have red hair too, but more Irish I think. Both races
are Celtic so can be fairly similar in looks. English people are more Anglo
Saxon heritage and do not often have red hair.
My father had brown/reddish hair and my hair is medium brown/reddish which I
brighten up a bit. My mother had dark hair.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Do you know where they lived in Scotland?

&gt; No.

&gt; My father's side were English and Scottish. My mother's side were German
and
&gt; French, with a little Scottish thrown in :)
">

Its interesting to do some genealogy on your parents. I have done some
mainly on my mothers side as I know more about them, but some on my fathers
side.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; I lived
&gt; &gt; on the mid/east coast of Scotland, near Edinburgh, which is the capital.
&gt; The
&gt; &gt; town I grew up in was an ancient and historic town.

&gt; Cool
">

It was very interesting, though I didn't realize it till many years after I
lived there. Kids don't pay much attention to those kind of things.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Is it hot this week where you are located?

&gt; It gets up to between 80 and 90 degrees in the day. But the fog comes in
&gt; during the night, so it gets down into the 50s. Which is nice for
">

sleeping.

90 is too hot for me but we have very high humidity on many days in summer.
I sometimes notice temperature on TV weather channel of cities around the
world or in the US and SF usually seems to be around mid 70's in summer. Its
on the ocean so would get nice cooling breezes.
I am ok up to about 80F, but some days here can be 72F and very humid and
feel hotter than some days we have at 90F and not as humid. Its better today
here around 86F and not like mid 90's we had all this week.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Its been in the 90's every day
&gt; &gt; this week with high humidity which eventually usually causes  severe
&gt; &gt; thunderstorms.

&gt; We rarely get thunderstorms out here. I remember the thunderstorms in New
&gt; York when I was a kid.
">

New York seems to be similar weather to Toronto both in summer and winter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Its very hot here in summer, especially July and August. I
&gt; &gt; don't like the heat so I don't go out some days in the summer.

&gt; It's been too hot to go out in the afternoon. So I usually take a nap.
">

I never nap during the day or couldn't sleep at night when I'm supposed to..

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; The humidity
&gt; &gt; is the worst.

&gt; I can remember how humid it used to get in New York, Pennsylvania, and New
&gt; Jersey. We usually don't have that kind of humidity out here in
">

California.

The above cities probably has the same kind of humidity we get here. Much
seems to have to do with our location near the Great Lakes which has a
strong influence mixed with the hot air from Gulf of Mexico. Humidity makes
you feel hotter than the actual temperature. They give temperature readings
here, plus temp with humidex, which is the Real feel temp.

You too Chip.
