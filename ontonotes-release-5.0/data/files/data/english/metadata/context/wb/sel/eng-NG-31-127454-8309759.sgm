Something that has puzzled me for a while is why Hermione thought
*her* giving clothes to the Hogwarts house elves would free them.

It's not as if they are employed by her... or is it maybe because she
was 'part of the family'?

Always seemed a bit odd.

Hermione is under the impression that all elves wants cloths [to be free]
and would jump at any chance they could get. We never find out if her cloths
count because none of the elves took up the offer.

Obviously the rules about 'clothes' aren't entirely clear... we know
it doesn't have to be deliberate... *but* I'd assume that the kids at
Hogwarts wouldn't be expected to wash their own clothes.

I know I'd not expect my kids to wash their own underwear etc... and I
reckon most kids at age 11 wouldn't have a clue either... so who would
do it? Well you'd expect the house elves to do it.

So *if* the house elves are ok collecting clothes for washing... then
there wouldn't be an issue with them collecting Hermione's hats and
scarves!!

In fact it would *have* to be a deliberate act that releases them else
any clothes anywhere would do the trick and Dobby would have been free
long before.

I think. :)

I think Hermione was deluded, it is the act of giving that releases them.
Perhaps though it was her intention to give by hiding them which is
different from them being collected and washed I guess.

I think it was more about intent, clothes that were owned by the &quot;master&quot;
but just left out on the floor or in a dirty clothes hamper would not count
because the &quot;master's&quot; intent was not to give them to their elf, but they
still would want the elf to wash them.  IMO elves were doing all the laundry
for their masters, and all the laundry at Hogwarts.

However, I don't think Hermione or any other student counted as a &quot;master.&quot;
BUT the elves still knew Hermione's intent by leaving the clothes scattered
around Gryffindor Tower was to &quot;trick&quot; them into freeing themselves.  THIS
was a grave insult to the elves even if it really wouldn't free them and
that is why only Dobby would clean the tower.  Look at how the elves reacted
to Hermione when she visited the kitchens in GoF and told them they should
be free.

Thinking on it more... even *that* can't be right. Lucius certainly
had no intent when he gave Dobby the diary and had no idea in fact
that there was clothing within it! Yet even tho the sock was hidden in
it... and Lucius didn't intend to give clothes to Dobby... he was
still free!

Maybe they just need to be given clothes by someone in 'authority'...
for example... would they be free is one of the kids in the house gave
them clothes out of mischief... as mischievous (and/or unthinking)
kids *might* do on occasion??

Either way I'd hate to be a house elf :(

That´s exactly what I understood when I read it: the elves took
offence at her poor attempt to free them. I don´t believe it would
have worked, either.

IIRC, Harry wrapped the diary in the sock (like it was a gift) and
Lucius took it out, tossing the sock into the air. Dobby them grabbed
it (I assume he welcomed the opportunity, otherwise he simply could
have left it drop.)

Lucius saw the sock all right. :)

Good point!  I never thought about that at all.  What about Dobby
himself going to Potter and giving info etc?  That's against what
House-elves do. I guess Dobby is no ordinary house elf though.

I would think though the elves are employed by Dumbledore and so he'd
have to be the one to free?  But then again, they are &quot;left out&quot; hats
etc right?  Is leaving something out the same as &quot;giving&quot; someone it?
I mean it could be a lost item which meant it was still the original
owner's property?

Anyway, interesting point.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hermione is under the impression that all elves wants cloths [to be

&gt;&gt; Ken,
&gt;&gt;   You seem to think that 'clothes' and 'cloths' are the same word.
&gt;&gt; They aren't.  Look them up in a good dictionary.  Clothes are usually
&gt;&gt; made of cloth, but cloth doesn't always mean clothes.

&gt; Sorry; I'm great at Math and lousy at English. It works out because my wife
&gt; is great at English and lousy at Math.

I am great at both, which is good, as my wife is lousy at both.
I have seen the same error in so many fanfiction stories that I assume
that many people don't know there IS a difference.  Many people don't
seem to understand that 'site' and 'sight' have different meanings, either.

&gt; Good point!  I never thought about that at all.  What about Dobby
&gt; himself going to Potter and giving info etc?  That's against what
&gt; House-elves do. I guess Dobby is no ordinary house elf though.

Dobby, having been severely mistreated, is really a bit demented, by
house elf standards.

&gt;&gt; &gt;I have to agree.  Perhaps the answer is that they knew her intentions,
&gt;&gt; &gt;and were offended at the thought, even though it wouldn't have actually
&gt;&gt; &gt;made them free.
&gt;That´s exactly what I understood when I read it: the elves took
&gt;offence at her poor attempt to free them. I don´t believe it would
&gt;have worked, either.
&gt;&gt; Thinking on it more... even *that* can't be right. Lucius certainly
&gt;&gt; had no intent when he gave Dobby the diary and had no idea in fact
&gt;&gt; that there was clothing within it! Yet even tho the sock was hidden in
&gt;&gt; it... and Lucius didn't intend to give clothes to Dobby... he was
&gt;&gt; still free!
&gt;IIRC, Harry wrapped the diary in the sock (like it was a gift) and
&gt;Lucius took it out, tossing the sock into the air. Dobby them grabbed
&gt;it (I assume he welcomed the opportunity, otherwise he simply could
&gt;have left it drop.)
&gt;Lucius saw the sock all right. :)

Of course he did... I was mixing the film and the book in my mind...
again.

Gaaaahhh........!!

Even so... it's still a bit iffy that the family has to be careful how

Alice: I do; at least - at least I mean what I say -- that's the same thing,
you know.
Hatter: Not the same thing a bit! Why, you might just as well say that, 'I

I think the whole clothes=freedom thing was a clever escape system
for the house-elves.  If they want to be free (assuming in the dim
past they originally did want to be free), then there are innumerable
opportunities to claim clothes were given.  Wizards with house elves
either had to treat them right or be incredibly careful about how
they set out their laundry.  Later on the house elves became domesticated
to the point that as long as they were treated at all well they didn't
want to be free.  At that point they have to have clothing forced on
them to be freed against their will.

It's all very silly since they wear towels as togas and as far as I'm
concerned, that _is_ clothing.

To get back to the original question, it isn't really explained exactly
what is required to free a house elf. We know from the ending of CoS
that an elf will be free if his master gives him an item of clothing,
even if this is done accidentally or as a result of trickery. Simply
picking up a piece of clothing that was left lying around cannot be
sufficient or Dobby would have freed himself years ago. However, it may
be that an elf can be set free by picking up a piece of clothing that
was left there by someone with the specific intention of freeing an
elf.  It is also possible that all Hogwarts students are part of the
&quot;family&quot; that the Hogwarts elves are bound to servc and therefore have
the power to free them.

Hermione usually does her research one would expect that she knew what
she was doing. On the other hand, it is possible that she found that
there was very little written about elf slavery and she just went ahead
with the best plan she could think of.

&gt; I think the whole clothes=freedom thing was a clever escape system
&gt; for the house-elves.  If they want to be free (assuming in the dim
&gt; past they originally did want to be free), then there are innumerable
&gt; opportunities to claim clothes were given.  Wizards with house elves
&gt; either had to treat them right or be incredibly careful about how
&gt; they set out their laundry.  Later on the house elves became domesticated
&gt; to the point that as long as they were treated at all well they didn't
&gt; want to be free.  At that point they have to have clothing forced on
&gt; them to be freed against their will.

&gt; It's all very silly since they wear towels as togas and as far as I'm
&gt; concerned, that _is_ clothing.

Costumes, and/or uniforms don't count, apparently.

The way I was taught is to take the 'I' or 'me' out of the sentence
and see if it still makes sense.

So... Harry and I went to the market becomes either
Harry Went to the market
or
I went to the market

So 'I' is correct.

Also...

Molly sent Harry and me to the market becomes either
Molly sent Harry to the market
or
Molly sent me to the market

So 'me' is correct.

See?? Works for I... errr... me... well it works anyway :)

I used to buy fudge from a shop in a Sydney arcade 'til I went by one

There is an infallible way to determine proper usage.  Simply try them
one at a time.  Items in a list must be consistent in case.  You would
never say 'George is going to the store with I', so you shouldn't say
&quot;George is going to the store with Fred and I.&quot;  The word 'with' in this
sentence makes 'Fred' and 'I' the OBJECTS of the preposition, and thus
the objective case 'me' is the proper form.  English is not particularly
'case intensive', since there are really only two cases, and only
pronouns are affected, unlike Latin that has 6 cases!

Yes.  When either objects, or subjects are listed, they must agree in

I used to love this Chinese buffet place until a friend mentioned that
she watched one of the employees take uneaten boiled shrimp from a
plate, wash them off, and add them to the serving line again.  Never
went back there, and haven't been much for buffets since.
I also try to tip well, and not to aggravate, or inconvenience the
employees at any eating place, even though this is rather difficult
sometimes as many of them define 'stupid', and 'inattentive'.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You´re sooooo right there, mate!!

&gt;I think the whole clothes=freedom thing was a clever escape system
&gt;for the house-elves.  If they want to be free (assuming in the dim
&gt;past they originally did want to be free), then there are innumerable
&gt;opportunities to claim clothes were given.  Wizards with house elves
&gt;either had to treat them right or be incredibly careful about how
&gt;they set out their laundry.  Later on the house elves became domesticated
&gt;to the point that as long as they were treated at all well they didn't
&gt;want to be free.  At that point they have to have clothing forced on
&gt;them to be freed against their will.

&gt;It's all very silly since they wear towels as togas and as far as I'm
&gt;concerned, that _is_ clothing.

We only know of towels (Dobby and the Hogwarts elves) and sheets (Hokey)
being worn &quot;draped like a toga&quot;, but Gandhi would probably have agreed
with you.

OTOH, I haven't looked at the adult edition yet.

Ken, if your little shop of horrors has an online presence, might you
kindly consider mailing me a link? It has been over 2 decades since I
last set foot in such an establishment and sometimes I simply need to
cry in my beer over everything that I am missing. Then it's over for a

That is the 2nd time I have seen you make that specific gripe and I
applaud you for doing so. I never noticed the incorrect usage until
_after_ I left the states and thought that it was now considered correct.

I am totally turned off by two developments in American English that I
have observed for years. The one is the habit of beginning and ending
every sentence with &quot;you know?&quot;. My standard response is &quot;No I don't,
Paris! Try using English!&quot;.

The other is the lifting of voice at the end of a sentence, as if asking
a question, whilst actually making a statement. ...as if begging the
question &quot;Can you understand this crap?&quot;.

Both are indications that the modalities of communication that I grew up
with are no longer in force.

But ya know OTOH language is always a ya know a work in progress ainit
ya know what I mean? Just axe round.
