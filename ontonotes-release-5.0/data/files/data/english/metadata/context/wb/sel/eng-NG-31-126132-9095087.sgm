Alpha Draconians - The Hierarchy in Our Galaxy - [DSG, ch. 1]

There are two schools of thought in our galaxy. There are the
regressives, who are races that carry fear and because of that want to
control others. The hierarchy of the regressives starts with a group
from Alpha Draconis.

The Andromedans have no idea where the Alpha Draconians came from, but
what they have learned through interaction with other dimensional
races is that somebody brought the Draconians to this universe and
&quot;dumped&quot; them in the Alpha Draconis system, where they had the highest
probability of survival.

According to the Andromedans, the Alpha Draconians have had space
travel for 4 billion years. They are an incredible race and have
achieved great things, but they are bullies. They are jerks, and
that's a judgment - I'm taking that judgment myself. That's my
judgment based on what I know about them. The Draconians do not like
human beings.

The Andromedans say that Draconians believe that this universe was
here for them - that their history teaches them that they were left
here to rule it. But, when they started traveling, they ran across
other races. They were able to conquer many of those races through
genetic manipulation.

Now, our government, the United States government, the New World Order
- whatever you want to call it - wants to implant everybody. From the
Andromedan perspective that means ownership. Extraterrestrial don't
want to bother with that stuff, since that is not permanent.
Extraterrestrials value genetics. What they do is they come in,
conquer a race and genetically alter it. From that moment on, that
race is genetically altered.

The genetic changes alter the frequency, sound and thought patterns of
the race if they move into a physical form. Does everyone understand
this?

Q: Could you give us an example of this?

AC: The best example I could give you concerns the Greys. Apparently,
the Greys were much more human-looking at one time. What happened was
that they, as a race, were captured 891,000 years ago while leaving
Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 to go off and do their own thing. This is very
common, and it is how Earth became colonized. What happened is that
they got captured by a group in Orion that was already genetically
altered and under control of the Alpha Draconians.

According to Moraney, the first thing this Draconian-altered Orion
group did was slaughter almost all of the females of the captured race
in order to control the birth process. They then genetically altered
the remaining females, so that all the children born after that were
genetically altered.

The males were enslaved, made to work in mines and slaughtered by the
Draconian-controlled Orion group, who had absolutely no regard for
life. What we know now as the Greys became a natural resource.

It would take someone of the magnitude of Erwin Rommel to take on those
bastards.  Rommel and Doenitz could have taken on the Waffen SS and
then got rid of Hitler.

Rommel a pragmatic man would not listen to his wife when she informed
him of the prophesies of Nostradamus and Rommel famously said &quot;nein das
ist pferdkrappun&quot; (no this is horseshit).

If the Germans had not invaded Russia when they did then they would
surely have taken England.  If the Generals had not listened to Der
Fuhrer then they would not have lost so many men.  One has to look at
Stalingrad and the fighting around the Oder, the folly of the Italians
in North Africa as all to costly and unnecessary to the German military
machine.

I have included the following on behalf of Rommel who was a fine
General and was not a Nazi.  He was respected by his men and by his
foe.

The data you're going by is Allied propaganda. Hitler as I was told by
Michael Walsh did not tell the men to take the oil fields, he
instructed the men to take Moscow but he was disobeyed.

Rommel was a Nazi til the end, but the Allies liked him so they
cropped up this false story for the history archives.
