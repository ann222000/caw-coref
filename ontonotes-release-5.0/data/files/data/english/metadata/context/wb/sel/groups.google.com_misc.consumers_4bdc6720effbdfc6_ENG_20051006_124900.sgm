Excerpts from
http://online.wsj.com/article/SB112856197554661289.html?mod=todays_us...

According to a study by Consumer Reports that tested the mileage of
vehicles in real world conditions, hybrids had some of the biggest
disparities, with fuel economy averaging 19 mpg below the EPA city
estimate. The EPA tests assume drivers accelerate slowly, leave the
air conditioning off, and average a speed of 20 mph in the city.

The groundswell of complaints is spurring the EPA to act. The agency
says that by the end of this year it will propose changes to the
methods used in calculating fuel economy ratings for vehicles. The EPA
said the new rules will more accurately reflect how people actually
drive and will consider the impact of air conditioning, aggressive
driving and traffic congestion on fuel economy.

"/> That's my family's experience too, Steve. On trips along a mix of
turnpikes and country roads our '05 Prius is giving us 50 mpg, exactly
as Toyota claims. In our suburban setting, however, we're seeing the
mid 40's, not the claimed 60. I'm not disappointed. I've never seen a
car that got better mileage around town, so from the outset I dismissed
the 60 figure as implausible. I'd have been startled to find it
correct.

Of course, &quot;how people actually drive&quot; is more a comment on drivers'
disinterest in conservation than a standard for fuel efficiency. Just
about any driver could improve mpg with a few changes in behavior.

The Prius is so brilliantly designed that it would still be a great car
even if it weren't thrifty. For us the higher efficiency was a nice
plus. When our Avalon retires, we'll become a two-Prius family.

trucks maximum speed governed in the low 60's. The fuel consumption
increase as you pass 60 mph is ernomous when you have a sizeable fleet. Fuel
costs are tied ... if not higher than the company's payroll costs.
Secondly, the severity of accidents is less with lower speeds. Since the

First, it is ridiculed.
Second, it is violently opposed.
Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.

"/> Across europe, 56mph is the legally governed speed (or metric
equivalent) on trucks. Even when you include the 70mph motorway speed in
the UK, and the unlimited stretches in Germany.

On most other speedlimits, although not mechanically governed, the truck
speed limit is lower than that for a car (except in 30 and 40 limits).

My guess the fleet size I mentioned is the part you missed. TX does not
permit 75 mph travel speeds. That owner/operators of tractor/trailers
choose to test the local smokies by going that fast is an entirely different
discussion.

perfectly ridicoulous. I've been driving in the Chicago area for 15 years
now and it's only getting worse. I passed one of your '62 mph' semis on the
way home tonight. I had to get up to 80 to pass him, he was going at least
75. . . . Even the UPS semis are going at least 70 here most of the time.

"/> OK, what part of SPEEDING don't you believe? I've seen the tollways get so
fast, if you weren't doing at least 80, you'd better pull off the road. . .
The left lane sometimes hits 90! Chicago is the home of the quick and the
dead. Just because the speed limit is posted 55 doesn't mean anyone obeys
it. Especially in Chicago. 40 in 30's, 80 on the tollways is not that
uncommon, even for trucks. If you're trying to do 55 on a tollway, you
better be in the far right lane and hope no one rear-ends you. The only
time the traffic actually slows down to the speed limit is when there's a
jam. . .

about 90 mph unless they see a cop.

&gt;&gt;Wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;choose to test the local smokies by going that fast is an entirely different

&gt;&gt;Testing the smokies ... where do you dream these things up; from the

Anyone who has driven in Texas would know this. Like I said before,
when the traffic permits, the trucks often pass me up when I'm doing
65 to 70 or they like to ride my bumper to get me to move over.

&gt; the way home tonight. I had to get up to 80 to pass him, he was going at
&gt; least 75. . . . Even the UPS semis are going at least 70 here most of the

&gt; OK, what part of SPEEDING don't you believe? I've seen the tollways get
&gt; so fast, if you weren't doing at least 80, you'd better pull off the road.
&gt; . . The left lane sometimes hits 90! Chicago is the home of the quick
&gt; and the dead. Just because the speed limit is posted 55 doesn't mean
&gt; anyone obeys it. Especially in Chicago. 40 in 30's, 80 on the tollways
&gt; is not that uncommon, even for trucks. If you're trying to do 55 on a
&gt; tollway, you better be in the far right lane and hope no one rear-ends
&gt; you. The only time the traffic actually slows down to the speed limit is
&gt; when there's a jam. . .

&gt;&gt; Obviously the laws of aerodynamics have been repealed near Chicago.
&gt;&gt; Phillip pointed out that the larger carriers put a mechanical governer
&gt;&gt; on their company trucks, for both safety and fuel economy. It's easy
&gt;&gt; for you to spout your &quot;evidence&quot; without feeling the need to back it

&gt; Just drive the I-294 sometime that's not rush hour, then get back to me. .

"/> Dick Simon trucking has about 1500 tractors. Their rigs are routinely seen
traveling well over 62, usually around 75 miles per hour on I-80 in
Wyoming, I-80 in Nevada, I-15 in Utah, I-25 in Wyoming and I-90 in Montana
and i-90 in Wyoming. (BTW, the speeds were observed over a period of 5
years in a vehicle which speed was reported by a GPS.)

I could name others but it's not worth my trouble to see if the company
meets your absurd limit of over 1000 tractors since that's not what you
said in your original post. Nor did your original post discuss speed
limits but actual maximum speed.

The only rigs I see traveling under 70 in the western US are those laboring
up a grade, in a construction zone or the occasional specially permitted
load.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Simply put, you don't know what you are talking about Philip.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ever driven on an interstate west of the Mississippi? Why would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; limit the trucks to 62 when 75 is the limit in many states?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;48 for 12 yrs. YOU are the one with your ass out in the wind.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Every truck fleet of size (excess of 1000 tractors) has their have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;trucks maximum speed governed in the low 60's. The fuel consumption
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;increase as you pass 60 mph is ernomous when you have a sizeable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fleet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, the severity of accidents is less with lower speeds. Since

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Finally, AZ, NV, CO, NM, WY, NB, and OK are the only states I recall
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;permitting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;semis to travel at 75 mph.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously you haven't driven in Texas. I've often driven at 65 to 70
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mph and they are passing me up.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've driven all over TX you self absorbed geek.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah right.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What partS of my posting did you not understand.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My guess the fleet size I mentioned is the part you missed. TX does not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;permit 75 mph travel speeds.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;choose to test the local smokies by going that fast is an entirely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;different
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;discussion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Testing the smokies ... where do you dream these things up; from the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;70's show or are you tripin ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't know what you're smoking but you better get your head outa
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;your ass even if it's your comfort zone.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Take a look at  http://www.fightthe55.com/map_of_truck_speeds.htm
&gt;&gt;&gt;before you embarrass yourself still further.

&gt;&gt; The signs say 70 but the cops permit greater on the freeways in Texas.
&gt;&gt; Anyone who has driven in Texas would know this. Like I said before,
&gt;&gt; when the traffic permits, the trucks often pass me up when I'm doing
&gt;&gt; 65 to 70 or they like to ride my bumper to get me to move over.

&gt;You still don't understand the discussion from a large fleet point of view.
&gt;You've been told numerous times which semi trucks I have referred to. Would
&gt;you like to remain in the darkness? Seems so.

"/> No you don't get it. Just sit by the road and watch how many trucks
follow your THEORY OF BS around Houston suburbs.

&gt;&gt; semis on the way home tonight. I had to get up to 80 to pass him, he was
&gt;&gt; going at least 75. . . . Even the UPS semis are going at least 70 here
&gt;&gt; most of the time.

Around Chicago, at least, even the big fleets such as UPS, Fed Ex and
Rodeway run fast. If you're not speeding in Chicago, you're liable to get
rear-ended.

BTW, they speed in Texas, too. We used to say Texas cars had two license
plates so the Arkansas drivers could see them barrelling up I-30 and get out
of the way. . . . I used to live in Arkansas 15 years ago. . .

Say, wait a second. Aren't you the same Phillip who told me that I simply
had to have sludge in my Corolla and accused me of not keeping it up?

"/> Getting rear ended by a car is not a concern of the trucker. Maybe you do
not know that the driver coming up from behind and colliding with the
vehicle ahead will be found at fault for not maintaining a safe following
distance. And if it is a car colliding with the rear of a semi truck, the
car will lose physically. Again, the tractor/trailer units operated by the
companies you mention above do not run 75 mph anywhere or anything close to
it. All large transport companies have tattletail devices that record minute
to minute vehicle speeds and other vehicle data.

&gt; Dick Simon trucking has about 1500 tractors. Their rigs are routinely

&gt; traveling well over 62, usually around 75 miles per hour on I-80 in
&gt; Wyoming, I-80 in Nevada, I-15 in Utah, I-25 in Wyoming and I-90 in Montana
&gt; and i-90 in Wyoming. (BTW, the speeds were observed over a period of 5
&gt; years in a vehicle which speed was reported by a GPS.)

"/> The exception does not disprove the rule. Simon has been in and out of
bankruptcy in the past decade. Simon is also is a specialized carrier
(refridgerated goods and foods) which they can charge higher rates to

I did run across this little bit regarding Simon:

California Sues Dick Simon Trucking Inc

Sep 1, 2001 12:00 PM

The State of California has sued Salt Lake City-based Dick Simon Trucking
Inc to pay for damage done by a company driver who drove his big rig into
the state Capitol in January 2001.

Dick Simon Trucking driver Mike Bowers, who had a history of legal and
mental problems, rammed his vehicle into the Capitol's south portico. The
truck, carrying a load of canned milk, caught fire, killing Bowers and
leaving the building with fire, smoke, and water damage. Repairs are still
being made.

According to the lawsuit, the company was aware of Bowers' emotional
problems and hired him anyway. It seeks $13.5 million in actual damages and
$100 million in punitive damages from Dick Simon Trucking, a subsidiary of
Simon Transportation Services Inc.

Simon officials have not made any comments about the suit.

Speed limits? We don't need not stinking speed limits.

I recently drove through seven states, with interstate speed limit ranging
from 55 MPH to 70 MPH, most every vehicle on the road, cars and semis was
running at least 75 MPH, even in the 55 zones. In Tennessee, where the
limit was 70, most every vehicle was running between 80 and 90. If any of
those Peterbuilts and Freightliners were governed at 62, something was amiss
because they were still passing all the Corollas and 4 cy Camrys up those
Tennessee mountains. LOL

California Sues Dick Simon Trucking Inc

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Sep 1, 2001 12:00 PM

&gt;The State of California has sued Salt Lake City-based Dick Simon Trucking
&gt;Inc to pay for damage done by a company driver who drove his big rig into
&gt;the state Capitol in January 2001.

&gt;Dick Simon Trucking driver Mike Bowers, who had a history of legal and
&gt;mental problems, rammed his vehicle into the Capitol's south portico. The
&gt;truck, carrying a load of canned milk, caught fire, killing Bowers and
&gt;leaving the building with fire, smoke, and water damage. Repairs are still
&gt;being made.

&gt;According to the lawsuit, the company was aware of Bowers' emotional
&gt;problems and hired him anyway. It seeks $13.5 million in actual damages and
&gt;$100 million in punitive damages from Dick Simon Trucking, a subsidiary of
&gt;Simon Transportation Services Inc.

&gt;Simon officials have not made any comments about the suit.

"/> In fact the article suggests Dick Simon as a company that is willing to take
higher risks with it's drivers and the public than larger companies. DS
hired that driver KNOWING he had serious mental and legal issues that would
have disqualified him at most other companies. If it is true DS has there
trucks roaring across the states you mentioned at the speeds you mentioned,
this only supports my argument.

&gt; Speed limits? We don't need not stinking speed limits.

&gt; I recently drove through seven states, with interstate speed limit ranging
&gt; from 55 MPH to 70 MPH, most every vehicle on the road, cars and semis was
&gt; running at least 75 MPH, even in the 55 zones. In Tennessee, where the
&gt; limit was 70, most every vehicle was running between 80 and 90. If any of
&gt; those Peterbuilts and Freightliners were governed at 62, something was
&gt; amiss because they were still passing all the Corollas and 4 cy Camrys up
&gt; those Tennessee mountains. LOL

&gt;&gt;&gt;Then might I suggest you get some professional truck driver friends who
&gt;&gt;&gt;drive company trucks for a LARGE carrier. 62 mph is the typical governed
&gt;&gt;&gt;vehicle speed for such fleets and of course, traversing mountainous
&gt;&gt;&gt;regions makes 48 mph a HIGH speed.

&gt;&gt; There are no posted 75 mph signs for semi truck speed in TX.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Simply put, you don't know what you are talking about Philip.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ever driven on an interstate west of the Mississippi? Why would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; limit the trucks to 62 when 75 is the limit in many states?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Simply stated&quot;, I'm a retired line driver. Driven most of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;contiguous
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;48 for 12 yrs. YOU are the one with your ass out in the wind.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Every truck fleet of size (excess of 1000 tractors) has their have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;trucks maximum speed governed in the low 60's. The fuel consumption
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;increase as you pass 60 mph is ernomous when you have a sizeable fleet.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Fuel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;costs are tied ... if not higher than the company's payroll costs.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, the severity of accidents is less with lower speeds. Since
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;larger companies are all self insured, they're really really conscious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the cost/benefits of maximum speed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Finally, AZ, NV, CO, NM, WY, NB, and OK are the only states I recall
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;permitting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;semis to travel at 75 mph.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously you haven't driven in Texas. I've often driven at 65 to 70
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mph and they are passing me up.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've driven all over TX you self absorbed geek.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah right.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What partS of my posting did you not understand.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My guess the fleet size I mentioned is the part you missed. TX does not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;permit 75 mph travel speeds.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;choose to test the local smokies by going that fast is an entirely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;different
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;discussion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Testing the smokies ... where do you dream these things up; from the
&gt;&gt;&gt;70's show or are you tripin ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't know what you're smoking but you better get your head outa
&gt;&gt;&gt;your ass even if it's your comfort zone.

&gt;&gt; Take a look at  http://www.fightthe55.com/map_of_truck_speeds.htm
&gt;&gt; before you embarrass yourself still further.

&gt;Rob and Charles are bent on self imollition. Who am I to deter them?

"/> Ok, so let us put this into another perspective. If I were another
person reading this thread for the first time and I read about 4
people who have witnessed trucks going well over 70 mph in different
parts of the country vs. your citing of a theory that contradicts all
the witness's observations, who should I believe (4 people or 1
person)?

Second, you refuse to accept my invitation to park along side the
freeway on the outer fringes of Houston during non rush hours and
spend perhaps 3 hours using a radar gun to check every rigs' speeds.

Last, show us a reputable web site link to back up your claim.
Assuming it exists, perhaps you are misinterpreting it because the
observations don't follow your theory ???

&gt;spend perhaps 3 hours using a radar gun to check every rigs' speeds.

&gt;Last, show us a reputable web site link to back up your claim.
&gt;Assuming it exists, perhaps you are misinterpreting it because the
&gt;observations don't follow your theory ???

"/>  You guys are going around in circles sniping at each other - and ALL
of you are right on your individual points.

Some large fleets have speed governors on their trucks - and you
aren't going to see trucks in those fleets going over the governed
speeds because they physically can't. At least on the level or
uphill, they might be able to go faster on overrun going downhill.

And some of the large fleets are using Teletrac or other satellite
monitoring systems that continuously report on the truck speed and
location, or the good old fashioned Tattletale paper chart speed
recorder that will fink on them the moment they arrive and a Safety
Department person checks the chart. And you won't find those drivers
speeding very often either - that is, if they want to stay employed.

But there are also a whole lot of independent truck drivers still
out there who own (or lease) their own trucks, and their trucks are
not governed. (At least not for road speed, all diesels have an RPM
limiter built into the injection pump or fuel management system
somewhere to make it harder to blow up the engine. Not impossible.)

Those are the trucks with the &quot;How Am I Driving? 1-800-F*CK-YOU&quot;
sign on the back. Or the Chrome Bikini Girls on the mudflaps. Or
fifty &quot;Tom Leykis Flash Friday&quot; stickers on the trailer back doors
spelling out something lewd... ;-)

And the shippers don't give a rip about whether the trucker hit a
lot of traffic or had to stop for three flat tires or lengthy weigh
station inspections. The computer said that under ideal conditions it
takes X hours to drive a load from Nebraska to Long Beach, so they
expect the cargo to be at the port Friday at 10 AM, and by god it
better be on time because the ship leaves for China at Noon.

Those are the truck drivers who'll be flying down the highway as
fast as the rig will go (speed limits and fuel efficiency be damned),
and driving past their scheduled sleep times. Because if they stop
for sleep - or anything else - the load will be late. They might
spend all their profit for this run on extra fuel they're wasting
driving flat out - but if they're late they lose the contract.

These are the guys who are popping caffeine tablets or uppers,
drinking Jolt or Mountain Dew straight from the 2-Liter or bad coffee
by the 2-quart Thermos, and keeping two Driver's Log books (&quot;Comic
Books&quot;) to lie about their time, because they've been up for 24 hours
straight trying to get the load there.

Those are the drivers who'll be doing 70 wherever they can - and
then they lock up the brakes when the radar detector starts squealing.

Okay, Phillip - I'll bet this hits Really close to home. ;-)

&gt;&gt; Speed limits? We don't need not stinking speed limits.

&gt;&gt; I recently drove through seven states, with interstate speed limit
&gt;&gt; ranging from 55 MPH to 70 MPH, most every vehicle on the road, cars and
&gt;&gt; semis was running at least 75 MPH, even in the 55 zones. In Tennessee,
&gt;&gt; where the limit was 70, most every vehicle was running between 80 and 90.
&gt;&gt; If any of those Peterbuilts and Freightliners were governed at 62,

&gt;&gt; 4 cy Camrys up those Tennessee mountains. LOL

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You guys are going around in circles sniping at each other - and ALL
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of you are right on your individual points.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Some large fleets have speed governors on their trucks - and you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; aren't going to see trucks in those fleets going over the governed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; speeds because they physically can't. At least on the level or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uphill, they might be able to go faster on overrun going downhill.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All large fleets have engine speed governors. That is a safe statement.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And some of the large fleets are using Teletrac or other satellite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; monitoring systems

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Qualcomm is the most common system.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that continuously report on the truck speed and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; location, or the good old fashioned Tattletale paper chart speed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recorder that will fink on them the moment they arrive and a Safety
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Department person checks the chart. And you won't find those drivers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; speeding very often either - that is, if they want to stay employed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But there are also a whole lot of independent truck drivers still
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out there who own (or lease) their own trucks, and their trucks are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not governed. (At least not for road speed, all diesels have an RPM
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; limiter built into the injection pump or fuel management system
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; somewhere to make it harder to blow up the engine. Not impossible.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(I know that you know this Bruce), but for others, so long as the clutch
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stays engaged, the engine speed governor is the defacto vehicle speed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;governor. I know of no governance system that applies the service
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;brakes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those are the trucks with the &quot;How Am I Driving? 1-800-F*CK-YOU&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sign on the back. Or the Chrome Bikini Girls on the mudflaps. Or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fifty &quot;Tom Leykis Flash Friday&quot; stickers on the trailer back doors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spelling out something lewd... ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;LOL

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And the shippers don't give a rip about whether the trucker hit a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of traffic or had to stop for three flat tires or lengthy weigh
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; station inspections. The computer said that under ideal conditions it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; takes X hours to drive a load from Nebraska to Long Beach, so they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expect the cargo to be at the port Friday at 10 AM, and by god it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better be on time because the ship leaves for China at Noon.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those are the truck drivers who'll be flying down the highway as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fast as the rig will go (speed limits and fuel efficiency be damned),
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and driving past their scheduled sleep times. Because if they stop
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for sleep - or anything else - the load will be late. They might
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spend all their profit for this run on extra fuel they're wasting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; driving flat out - but if they're late they lose the contract.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These are the guys who are popping caffeine tablets or uppers,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; drinking Jolt or Mountain Dew straight from the 2-Liter or bad coffee
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by the 2-quart Thermos, and keeping two Driver's Log books (&quot;Comic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Books&quot;) to lie about their time, because they've been up for 24 hours
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; straight trying to get the load there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those are the drivers who'll be doing 70 wherever they can - and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then they lock up the brakes when the radar detector starts squealing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, Phillip - I'll bet this hits Really close to home. ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --&lt;&lt; Bruce &gt;&gt;--

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well according to the self appointed x'spurts, UPS drivers fit the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;aforementioned profile.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've seen more than a few drivers fitting your above description.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;always in the little no name truck stops where they are less likely to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;caught and can easily get 'something' to prop them up for the next 12
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hrs.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But this situation has improved considerably since the late 80's. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;company I worked for made a big issue out of dispatching drivers on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;legal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;loads ... loads that had sufficient time to deliver with the hours the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;driver had available without running two logs. That's one of the reasons
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I stayed so long.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;BTW, I did find in my archives a picture I took of a Dick Simon truck

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not governed. (At least not for road speed, all diesels have an RPM
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; limiter built into the injection pump or fuel management system
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; somewhere to make it harder to blow up the engine. Not impossible.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(I know that you know this Bruce), but for others, so long as the clutch
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stays engaged, the engine speed governor is the defacto vehicle speed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;governor. I know of no governance system that applies the service
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;brakes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those are the trucks with the &quot;How Am I Driving? 1-800-F*CK-YOU&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sign on the back. Or the Chrome Bikini Girls on the mudflaps. Or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fifty &quot;Tom Leykis Flash Friday&quot; stickers on the trailer back doors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spelling out something lewd... ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;LOL

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And the shippers don't give a rip about whether the trucker hit a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of traffic or had to stop for three flat tires or lengthy weigh
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; station inspections. The computer said that under ideal conditions it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; takes X hours to drive a load from Nebraska to Long Beach, so they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expect the cargo to be at the port Friday at 10 AM, and by god it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better be on time because the ship leaves for China at Noon.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those are the truck drivers who'll be flying down the highway as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fast as the rig will go (speed limits and fuel efficiency be damned),
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and driving past their scheduled sleep times. Because if they stop
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for sleep - or anything else - the load will be late. They might
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spend all their profit for this run on extra fuel they're wasting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; driving flat out - but if they're late they lose the contract.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These are the guys who are popping caffeine tablets or uppers,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; drinking Jolt or Mountain Dew straight from the 2-Liter or bad coffee
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by the 2-quart Thermos, and keeping two Driver's Log books (&quot;Comic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Books&quot;) to lie about their time, because they've been up for 24 hours
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; straight trying to get the load there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those are the drivers who'll be doing 70 wherever they can - and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then they lock up the brakes when the radar detector starts squealing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, Phillip - I'll bet this hits Really close to home. ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --&lt;&lt; Bruce &gt;&gt;--

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well according to the self appointed x'spurts, UPS drivers fit the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;aforementioned profile.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've seen more than a few drivers fitting your above description.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;always in the little no name truck stops where they are less likely to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;caught and can easily get 'something' to prop them up for the next 12
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hrs.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But this situation has improved considerably since the late 80's. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;company I worked for made a big issue out of dispatching drivers on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;legal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;loads ... loads that had sufficient time to deliver with the hours the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;driver had available without running two logs. That's one of the reasons
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I stayed so long.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;BTW, I did find in my archives a picture I took of a Dick Simon truck
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;over
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the side on I-80 in Wyoming back in 1998. Gee ... do you suppose he was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;driving too fast for conditions? Email me and I'll send it to you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess none of those trucks pass by Texas or the other states that 4

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one confused.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Your speculation.

&gt;&gt; Ok, show me proof with a reputable web site that backs up your claim?

&gt;Here's info on Yellow Transportation's web site where they mention that they

I've seen yellow trucks in Houston and they definitely went over 65
mph on I-10 this year.

Another thought comes to my mind if I owned a trucking outfit. If I
take longer to make a delivery (perhaps at a lower cost), would that
satisfy the buyer or would he want to hire the other guy(s)?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You guys are going around in circles sniping at each other - and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ALL
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of you are right on your individual points.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Some large fleets have speed governors on their trucks - and you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; aren't going to see trucks in those fleets going over the governed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; speeds because they physically can't. At least on the level or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uphill, they might be able to go faster on overrun going downhill.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All large fleets have engine speed governors. That is a safe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;statement.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And some of the large fleets are using Teletrac or other satellite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; monitoring systems

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Qualcomm is the most common system.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that continuously report on the truck speed and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; location, or the good old fashioned Tattletale paper chart speed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recorder that will fink on them the moment they arrive and a Safety
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Department person checks the chart. And you won't find those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; drivers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; speeding very often either - that is, if they want to stay employed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But there are also a whole lot of independent truck drivers still
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out there who own (or lease) their own trucks, and their trucks are

"/> Except for perishable and other time-sensitive goods, the simple solution
would be to adjust the departure time so that the arrival time is the same
as before. A friend who drives for a bakery with a fleet of around 100
semis leaves the Chicago area around midnight to arrive in the Detroit area
in time for the grocery stores to open up. The schedule is calculated based
on 50 MPH, with time for fueling and rest stops, so even a governed truck
would arrive on time, barring any major traffic tie-ups.

I believe that one of the things that the Canadian association was trying to
address was eliminating the advantage, real or perceived, that an outfit
with non-governed trucks would have by having all trucks so equipped.
Whether the government should mandate that every semi should be equipped
with a governor or not is a whole different can of worms. With the price
fuel going up, I'd guess that more and more trucking companies will
voluntarily install them with the owner/operators watching their speed on
their own.
