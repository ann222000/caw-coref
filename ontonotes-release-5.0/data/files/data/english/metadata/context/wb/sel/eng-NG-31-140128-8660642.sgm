Question
Just how long are we going to have to endure Quinten Jammer? There has to
be somebody that can cover a receiver without a seven yard cushion. If one
more announcer classifies him as a &quot;shut-down corner&quot; I may kill myself. As
an aside, I went to the game in Foxboro and the Patriot fans make Raider
fans look classy. They are a bunch of idiots.

Bryan Wiedeman  /  San Clemente

Answer

First, he's not as bad as you and a million other people seem to think.
Second, the Chargers paid him almost $13 million over the past two years.
That tends to guarantee a guy will stick for a while.

Yeah, the Patriots fans were a little harsh, weren't they? But it's sort of
that way everywhere -- especially when you give people an extra seven hours
to drink.

Question
My question is why would the Chargers be interested in Ted Cottrel? His
last two coaching stops were an abomination. What I see out there is a
defense that has no clue of what is going on. There is no coverage only weak
zones. There is no pressure from the line because Cottrel chooses to rush
three players. For instance why would you on have three down linemen and
then drop the linebackers off the line of scrimmage on 3rd and short? That
seemed to be Cottrels preferred alignment against the Patriots. We say what
they did to his defense. He needs to be relieved of his coaching duties
immediately. He has proven nothing to be given the reigns to the Chargers
defense.

lou gio  /  la mesa

Answer

Yes, the Patriots game was curious. There is no defense for that defense.

But let's put some of the blame on the players.

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007
Question
With LT's success last season, all the teams will be trying to stop the run
first. Should the Chargers start preparing for games with the pass first in
mind, then the run...that's if the receivers beside Gates can get open. Then
this should open up the running game for LT the MVP.

Rob...  /  San Diego

Answer

Did you see the first play of the game was a pass? I think that is the plan.

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007
Question
Why doesnt the chargers deffense just send everybody blitzing and hope for
the best, they cant cover any receivers anyway, just everybody run forward
and blitz play after play, dont cover the receivers, wait a minute, they are
already doing that .

T Castillo  /  Clairemont

Answer

You made me laugh.

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007
Question
I am a season ticket holder for the past 8 years. I have great seats in the
shade because we bought when they were awful. I love my team, with that
said... Why would the Chargers hire a losing coach? Do you think the Spanos
family needs to start looking at AJ Smith for poor decisions on who should
lead this team?

Michelle  /  Carlsbad

Answer

Bill Belicchik was a losing coach in Cleveland. Mike Shanahan was a losing
coach in Oakland.

Dean Spanos does not need to look at AJ Smith yet -- unless it's for fashion
tips.

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007
Question
Hindsight of course being 20/20, do you think the Chargers regret at all
the decision to sit LaDainian for the entire preseason? The offensive 1st
team just doesn't seem in sync at all.

Michael Baker  /  San Diego

Answer

You're right about the first team, but LT sitting has very little to do with
this. I do think he should take a few snaps in the preseason.

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007
Question
Kevin,
Your a class act. Enjoy the reads. Keep it up and enjoy the expresso.

Patriot Nation  /  Bawston

Answer

But you still don't like LT, right?

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007
Question
I have more of a comment than asking a repetitious question. Hello
bandwaggoners. 2 weeks into the season and you got us getting the first
round draft pick. I am not a Norv Turner fan, nor am I a believer in P.
Rivers. But I am still ridin the wagon because I am a Charger fan. All you
people that have given up, move your butt to Oakland. Forget Marty, he's
gone. Bottom line, The Pack will wish the Patriots wouldn't have made us
look bad. The Chargers will go to the playoffs. Faith baby, faith....

Vern Winkle  /  Imperial Beach

Answer

Vern, I don't know that I agree with everything you say. (Move to Oakland?
That's not right.)

But I commend your patience.

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007
Question
Is Quentin Jammer ever going to be the great back that everyone hoped when
he was drafted? He is forever involved in the big play, but not ever, or
seldom ever, making the big play.

Dave  /  Huntington Beach

Answer

One of Moss' touchdowns was on Clinton Hart, the other on Drayton Florence.
Jammer was not the only DB to get humiliated Sunday.

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007
Question
Kevin, I feel that the reason the Charger offense is off beat is because of
the absence of Parker. I remember that last year when he was out Rivers
struggled. Upon his return Rivers game improved. The big guysdo not get
separation.. What do you think.?

larry  /  san diego

Answer

Amen.

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007
Question
Hi Kevin,
I am not pushing the panic button yet but watching the Packers highlights, I
saw GB has 5 wideouts formation last Sunday vs. NY. I am really worried that
Brett F. will make SD secondaries looked foolish again this Sunday. Chargers
1-2. What do you think?

Nick  /  San Diego

Answer

I think you should be worried.

However, the Packers have Donald Driver and that's it. Did you know their
No.3 receiver is Ruvell Martin. They have no running game.

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007
Question
Where is Donnie Edwards? Can't help but notice the quantity of short pass
plays that Brady had open all day. This is an area that Edwards shut down
last year. We've always (last several years)
seem to have holes in the secondary but not in the (short) middle. Edwards
is a huge loss!

Mark  /  San Diego

Answer

This was always a danger. Wilhelm was out, and Dobbins as lost.

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007
Question
Do you think the Offensive line should be blocking better and if so could
that be the reason for LT's troubles

Gerry  /  San diego

Answer

They have not been great. But the real problem is the passing game. Rivers
makes plays, LT will get some breathing room.

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007
Question
Do you think the injury to Olivea was a cheap shot? To me seeing it in
slo-mo it was clearly a case of a player seeing his opponent in a vulnerable
position and just letting him have it. It's a shame about the Pats I thought
they had a classy team a few years ago and now they are just a bunch of
cheaters that give cheap shots. Sounds like a new version of the Raiders.

Kurt  /  Del Mar

Answer

It's football. NFL football. It's brutal. Wht you say about NE is true, but
I didn't see it being &quot;dirty.&quot; unecessary but not dirty.

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007
Question
From today's UT top story on the Chargers:
&quot;First, there are 14 games remaining â?&quot; presumably none of them against a
team as good and as good and ticked off as the New England Patriots were in
slaughtering the Chargers 38-14 on Sunday night.&quot;

Well, that's half accurate . . . but all fourteen of those Charger games
will feature the team that lost - badly - Sunday night.
Everything we need to know about the Chargers will be revealed Sunday
against the Pack. A team that does not come roaring back and soundly thrash
the very competitive Packers will likely be eliminated from the playoffs by
the middle of October. The AFC is far too competitive. The Chargers'
schedule anticipated a 14-2 team showing up with more than a modicem of its
own compettive shadow from last season plus new uniforms.
That schedule is a beast - very unforgiving.
The Raiders looked better than the Chargers on Sunday. That's how far we've
come. The number of &quot;gimme&quot; games in our division has evaporated by half.
You're saying 'wait til November' to become anxious, there's not many fans
who will agree that we have such a luxury.

R Murphy  /  Wildomar

Answer

the schedule is tough. especially early.

i agree with you to a certain extent about sunday. they need to beat green
bay and beat them good. but, remember, indianapolis lost two tough games in
a row last season. and this one is on the road. still, they need to win.

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007

Question
Talk to me about the secondary. They looked lost and couldn't cover (or do
anything, for that matter) Coaching or Tom Brady?

Ken  /  San Diego

Answer

Both. Plus, they didn't play well.

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007
Question
Do you think LT and Merriman should do less talking and more producing?
Both have been very vocal with the media since last January when they should
do their talking on the field.

Chris  /  Boca Raton

Answer

Actually, Merriman has been sort of quiet. And Sunday he had two sacks and a
tackle for loss and was in the backfield a lot. I don't think LT's talking
has anything to do with his troubles.

He has played against the Bears and then played in a game in which his team
got behind big early.

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007
Question
Is it just me or do the chargers not look as hungry as last year. Last year
they were all standing on the sidelines. Now they are sitting and watching.
It seems like they had something to prove last year and now that doesn't
show as much.

Terry Rainey  /  Santee

Answer

Don't read too much into what you see on the sideline in a difficult game.
One game.

Kevin Acee

Tuesday, September 18, 2007
Question
I know I'm not a coach but in the Jets-N.E. game the Jets let Randy Moss
run free through the secondary and he torched them. Why
