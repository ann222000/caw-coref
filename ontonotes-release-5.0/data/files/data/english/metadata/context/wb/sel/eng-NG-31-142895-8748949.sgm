ZIKAR: Focus Through Repetition
by Michael Turner

© August 1998, 2007

(The following is based upon the transcript of a satsang I
gave on June 17, 1998, following  a reading of the chapter,
&quot;The Practice of the Zikar&quot; in Paul Twitchell's &quot;Stranger by
the River&quot;.)

There are a couple of levels to this chapter:  one is
the basic theme of the importance of practicing repetition,
&quot;Zikar,&quot; or &quot;Simran&quot; as they call it in India, repeating the
Holy Names of God. But there's also a sub text talking
about intention and attention.  You might say &quot;What is the
intention of your attention.&quot;  And Paul Twitchell deals with
this both in terms of the actual words he uses and also the
way he uses them.  He appears to contradict himself more
than a couple times in these few pages.  He sort of ricochets
off himself from sentence to sentence a little bit saying that,
if you want God, you won't get God but you still have to
want it.

The key subtext of this is that we should quit trying
to figure it out.  Quit trying to use your mind to understand
God, to understand Naam.  You can't use the intellect.
You can't use the rational judgement to get there.  The
only thing that will take you home is the return current of
the Light and Sound and the way that you harmonize with
the current is by practicing the Zikar.

Paulji starts off with Peddar Zasq asking Rebazar
Tarzs &quot;What is this 'Zikar?'  Please enlighten me.&quot; because
he'd heard people talk about it a lot.  And Rebazar Tarzs
replies &quot;It's the art of making contact with the Audible Life
stream within you.&quot;  In a sense, there's the chapter right
there: the practice of Zikar.  Sit down,  focus, chant the
Holy Names.  The Current absorbs you into ItSelf and
takes you home.  End of story.

Of course, that would make for a very short chapter.
It's like what BB once told me.  Paul used to say he could
put the entire teachings into three or four paragraphs max,
and that would be it.  But people like having something
tangible to read and chew on.

Then Paul goes on and talks about mind a little bit,
explaining how the Divine must be directly experienced of
ItSelf. You can't learn it from books.  Of course, the irony
here is that you are reading a book about how you can't
grasp It by reading books.  It's the same thing Kabir talked
about.  You can absorb all the theoretical knowledge you
want, but it doesn't do you any good in terms of the actual
experience.  You can read about apples till you're blue in
the face and it's not the same thing as biting into a Golden
Delicious or a Granny Smith.  Spirituality is the same way.
The appearance of the reality, the description of the reality,
the understanding of the reality, the imagination of what
the reality might be, is not the same thing as the Reality
ItSelf.  They are two very different things.

It's like what Maharaj Charan Singh once said:
You can say the word &quot;chocolate&quot; all day long, but it's
not the same thing as actually tasting it.  The way you
really learn about God and spirituality, he states, is from
a living God-man who gives you the direct experience of
It, and instructs you in the spiritual exercises of the inner
Sound and Light, as well as the art of avoiding the difficulties
and traps which you meet on the inner path.

This is core Sant Mat right here.  Find someone
who has traversed this path, someone who knows where
all the land mines are, who knows what and where all the
perils of mind are, because there are a lot of them.  Although
Paul expresses it slightly differently, it really goes back to
the point of sitting in the presence of the Master, simply
being there.  Absorb yourself in the surroundings of the
Satsang, as well as the inner surroundings and spiritual
energy.  Just be in the Holy present and put your attention
wholly and solely on one point.

The Master is the Zikar/Simran in human form.
What is one of the main points of doing the Zikar, doing
the repetition?  Focusing the attention, observing  the
object of your focus, until you and the point upon which
you are focusing become one.
Words are used because they are somewhat tangible.
They give you something for the mind to focus upon.  They
are charged with the resonance of each of the inner planes
and they gradually impart that resonance to you.  They
bring a little of it into your body, into your emotions,
into your mind, into your nervous system, into your entire
being every time you chant them.  And coming into Satsang,
being in the presence of the Living Master, gives you a
tangible human being upon which to focus.  This is
something every Master has said.  This isn't just Sri Mikey
saying, &quot;Look at me.&quot;  You know? &quot;Hang out with me
because I'm cool.&quot;  It's simply, kind of like John Lovitz
used to say on Saturday Night Live, &quot;Get to know me.&quot;
Not in the egoistic sense, but from the perspective of just
hanging out, opening up to the spiritual energy flow and
paying attention to what happens.

But the thing is, the physical body, is really just a
glorified marionette.  It's just this sack of clothes, bag of
bones, sitting here.  But it's something real according to
the physical senses.  It's not something that might be
imaginary.  It's not something that is intangible, like
such concepts as the Inner Master, God, Spirit Guides, etc.,
things that might be confused with your own imagination,
things that might be the product of your imagination.  The
human form is something that is empirically verifiable, it
exists physically and tangibly, here and now.

And so it becomes an exercise, an experiment to
see how long you can hold your attention in one place.
Can you really focus and let everything else fall by the
wayside when you come to the Satsang?  Can you come
into Satsang, and from the moment you walk in the door
until the moment you leave, forget entirely about the
outside world and be focused wholly and solely on the
essence of the Satsang and the makeup of the Satsang,
which is the Master?  When you have achieved this for
an hour or more sitting in a room like this, it will work
wonders with your meditation, because you will learn to
shut out the outside world and simply be in the now.

It's like I've said before, there is nothing wrong
with outside interests, per se.  There is nothing wrong
with all of the little things that our minds do because that's
just how minds are; they are easily distracted by new stimuli.
But there's a law in physics which states that you can't put
two things in the same place at the same time; two objects
cannot occupy the same place in the space-time continuum.
If I take this glass of water I'm holding and place it here
on this table, I cannot place another glass where this glass
is.  It is already here, occupying this particular space-time
continuum.  If  I move it, then something else can take it's
place, but currently it is occupying this point in time and space.

When the mind is focused upon the world, then it
is dwelling upon what ever is attracting its attention outside.
As a result, by its very nature it is not focusing on God.
Now I'm not trying to come off being judgmental here,
like a judge or pastor saying, &quot;Bad, bad, bad!&quot;  It is simply
a statement of fact.  When a person approaches a spiritual
path with the goal of knowing God directly (and that is the
goal of Sant Mat, of Eckankar, of Radhasoami, of being a
true Sikh, of being a true Christian) the goal then is to
directly experience the Self individually through direct
knowingness and beingness and also through doing this
process, to know God, directly of ItSelf - not indirectly,
not by inference, not secondhand, not by somebody else's
information or experience.

Each one of you can directly go within and know
God, experience God.  That's why we are on this path.
If this is our goal, then we want to learn how to put the
attention more and more there.  Because this helps us
absorb ourselves into it, to the point when we start tuning
out the outside world in our meditations.  We're no longer
distracted by the physical and we begin to explore the inner
regions, initially through the astral plane.  That's the first
inner door.

What you'll find on the Astral Plane is that it has a
bunch of distractions too.  You will find more distractions
there than here.  So we use the focus of the inner Master
at that point, because we've taken the outer Master and
solidified our attention there.  Then we've opened the
inner door and allowed ourselves the comfort zone to
see the Master within.  And so when we go into the
Astral Plane, instead of just looking at the skyrockets and
incredible vistas and sunsets and marketplaces and all of
the other amazing astral things which are occurring, our
attention focuses in once again on the form of the Master.
Because there is the Nuri Sarup, the astral body of the
living adept before you upon which you can focus.

So you place your attention upon the Nuri Sarup of
the Living Master and it guides you to the next point of the
journey where you leave the astral body, you shed that
body, and you go on to the Causal Plane, which has
different distractions.  This chapter explains this core
principle when it says, &quot;It can be learned only from the
Living Godman who will give you the art of avoiding the
difficulties which you will meet on the inner path.&quot;  You
see?  The difficulties of spiritual growth aren't just
encountered on the outer path, in the physical universe.
Even though it's a huge task getting from the outer path
to the inner path, once you're on the inner trek, there are
tremendous difficulties there as well.  There are tons of
land mines and all sorts of temptations, and million upon
millions of things trying to distract you and tugging at you
to lose your focus and get you off the path.

It's kind of like this weird thing that happens in
basketball.  I was noticing it during the playoffs.  When
somebody's going for a free-throw, there's this thing the
