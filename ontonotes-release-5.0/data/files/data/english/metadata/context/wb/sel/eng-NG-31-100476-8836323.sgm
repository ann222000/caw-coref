Be nice to know a year and model.  On some trucks with that engine you
had to disconnect an electrical connector or ground a terminal in the
ALDL to disable the computer before you set the actual timing.

Yes and some newer models cannot be even manually timed either.

I think you're referring to the EST (Electronic Spark Timing)
connector, which must be disconnected prior to setting your timing
with a timing light...

this is a single wire connector, wire is tan with a black
stripe...depending on your ignition system it is located under the
heater box inside the passenger compartment or right next to the
distributor on the firewall...

the correct timing for your truck should be located on the sticker on
top of the radiator or fan shroud...

Not sure they actually called it EST that year but they did when it
first came out on 305 around 83. I will give you a tip to wake engine
up some if you want to. When you disconnect lead mentioned above, set
timing to 4 to 6 BTDC and run 89 octane minimum are set it to 8 to 10
BTDC and use 93 and not only will it run better and will improve MPG
more than enough to offset fuel cost increase. Been doing that for
many years with my 89. If you stick with 87 it limits potentail a lot
and TDC or less base advance is about all you can ever run.

Nope. 83 would have still been a mechanical/vacuum advance
distributor with ESC. The 305 didn't get EST until 1987 when the
fuel system went EFI.  Prior year V8s back to 1981 had ESC only,
not EST.

T'was quite common on the older TBI motors to bump the timing 3 or 4
degreees.  You can't go too far or the computer complains, but 3 or 4
degrees will wake those motors up quite a bit...without affecting
emissions...it's still a closed loop system that can adjust itself.

As usually your full of it. It passed every Echeck with flying colors
and passed by very wide margins too and would still today except the
stopped doing checks. In the 10 years they did it here I never had any
of my vehicles fail. The TDC baseline timing is so that aomw consumers
can feed their addiction burn &quot;cheap&quot; 87 octane in them even though
performance and MPG suffers. 87 octane was designed in 70's when 8 to
1 CR was the norm.  When I got mine new in 89 I tried burning 87 in it
for first 8K to 10K miles or so and it was a real slug in hot weather.
After that I advanced timiing and started using 93 and never looked
back still runs great today and 93 and timing change added about 3 to
4 MPG to highway driving on long trips and better power too. I also
found during frequent trips to Colorado and Wyoming that manually
advancing timing to 12 or 14 BTDC helped performance a lot above 5000
feet during extended stays because &quot;EST&quot; cannot do it on its own. It
has been a while since I checked it but I beleive it is set at around
8 or 10 BTDC right now. People that ride in the old burb today are
surprized at how well it runs and looks even today. I make many
commuter trip thake my daughters to and from college on weekend during
school year and it is about 75 miles one way urban driving and when
gas prices are stable I make 3 trips up and back before I refuel and
it averages high 16's to mid 18's on these trip cycles.  ( if you keep
it under 70 it will do around 18 mpg  and at 70's and above MPG drops
a bits towards the lower number of the stated range.) Not bad for a
4x4 burb with 180K miles too and using A/C when needed because I never
drive it with windows down.   BTW, except for a custom 3 inch single
exhaust with a quieter flow master and timing change it is stock too.
(no lift or big tires either)

I found that it will go a lot more than that if you use better fuel
and still easily pass Echeck. Dumping 87 octane is a must do with
those TBI engines if you want them to respond well to timing changes.

The correct ignition timing is where the engine runs best
using the fuel that is in the tank. Actual timing numbers
given by the manufacturer happens to be a statistically
good number, but rarely the best number for all possible
conditions.

If there were such a thing as &quot;correct engine timing&quot; as
an ordained value automotive engines would never deviate
from that ordained number as they do on the fly. Nor would
the state allow cars with a stretched timing chain to
stay on the road (for vehicles using conventional
distributor ignitions.)

But then again you do sound full of shit enough to be
a civil servant.

Better performance is meaningless.  Lots of things can be done to
achieve better performance all the while increasing tail pipe
emissions above standardized levels.  He could run the fucker at
12 to 1 air fuel ratio and get some sort of better performance in
some category but odds are, he'll be spewing CO at levels far
above what is/was mandated.
The thing you don't understand is; doing so isn't clever, it
isn't smart, it doesn't represent some windfall of discovery.  It
just proves that he can't diagnose what's wrong with his vehicle
so he resorts to a typical hack repair.  More's law; if more is

&gt; &gt;That's all well and good but, things have changed drastically

&gt; &gt;I'm not trying to put you down OC, but I see late 80s early 90 GM
&gt; &gt;TBI trucks almost weekly that fail NOx testing and it's simply a

&gt; &gt;to be.

&gt; No offense taken.  You hit upon one of the very reasons I live in

&gt; If the truck was mine, I'd retard it back to specs for the inspection

I think you're missing the hypocrisy here that is Snomans trademark. He
is so critical about NOx in other post and is sooo worried about global
warming but when the subject is engine timing he no longer gives a sh*t.

Oh and I'm still wondering why &quot;133 lb ft&quot; wasn't correct for the
&quot;Caliper Bracket to Knuckle Mounting Bolts&quot; on a 2000 Blazer.

I guess the YellowSnoman is to busy firing off wrong answers to admit
they were wroing...

&gt; Be nice to know a year and model.  On some trucks with that engine you

In Northumberland County Pa,

We only have a visual for now, but wait. The last county to go full IM, will
be the first county that the shops get cornholed in.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Now why do you suppose they did that?

&gt;&gt; Because they didn't know any better. Just like you.

&gt; You know nothing about me.

&gt;&gt; Probably, if that's all you're capable of.

&gt; What works well works well regardless of how much
&gt; or how little the person making them knows. But
&gt; your petty little comment is only stupid and

&gt;&gt;&gt;You live in a totalitarian state.

&gt;&gt; Maybe.  So, where do you draw the line at which laws you obey and which
&gt;&gt; you don't?
&gt;&gt; Cost?
&gt;&gt; Convenience?
&gt;&gt; Expedience?
&gt;&gt; Personal preference?
&gt;&gt; Risk of being caught?
&gt;&gt; Risk of injury to others?
&gt;&gt; Risk of injury to self?

&gt; All of the above along with a personalized sense of morality
&gt; coupled with some common sense. Don't try to speak of laws
&gt; as though they're always &quot;right&quot; because they aren't. Anyone
&gt; who blindly obeys laws simply because they're there is an
&gt; idiot.
