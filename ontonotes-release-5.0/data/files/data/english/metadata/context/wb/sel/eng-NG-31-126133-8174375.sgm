I recently sat down with the first two DVDs, and watched them.  The
trailer had intrigued me, and I wanted to check it out.  My firm
opinion is that it is sub-par.  It obviously has no intention of taking
itself seriously, but doesn't play up the camp enough.  It seems like
they've taken every classroom anime, anime that have a classroom scene
in it, and a few other anime, put them in a blender, pulsed it, and
then took what got flung onto the walls and made an anime out of that.
If you want a surreal anime, go watch Bobo-bo, if you want insanity
with some coherency, go watch Excel Saga, if you want a good school
anime, go watch Azumanga Daioh.
