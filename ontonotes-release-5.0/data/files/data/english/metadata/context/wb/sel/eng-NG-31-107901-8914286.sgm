An excerpt:

&quot;Motion Picture Sound (Sidebar #1)

In 1922, Research Administrator E. B. Craft decided to direct the
company's developments in amplifiers, loudspeakers, microphones, and
electronic recording in a new direction: towards sound motion
pictures. Efforts towards that end had been tried since the dawn of
motion pictures in the 1890's, most notably the introduction of the
Kinetophone from Thomas Edison's laboratory in 1913. The Kinetophone's
poor synchronization and sound quality proved more a distraction than
an enhancement to films. Edison's failure made Hollywood moguls wary
of expending much time or effort on sound--offering an opportunity to
other innovators outside of the motion picture industry.

By 1923, a number of companies were working on sound developments,
but Craft was undaunted by the competition. He wrote Frank Jewett,
vice president in charge of research, &quot;it seems obvious that we are in
the best position of anyone to develop and manufacture the best
apparatus and systems for use in this field.&quot; Craft turned out to be
right. Western Electric developed an integrated system for recording,
reproducing and filling a theater with synchronized sound. By 1924,
Western Electric was ready to sell its system to Hollywood.

Western attracted the attention of a second-tier motion picture
studio called Warner Bros., and the two companies formed a joint
venture, the Vitaphone Corporation, to experiment in the production
and exhibition of sound motion pictures. Four months later, the new
system, called Vitaphone, debuted with the opening of &quot;Don Juan,&quot;
starring John Barrymore, at the Wamer's Theatre in New York City.
Preceding the film were a series of short sound films, rather than the
usual live vaudeville acts. As for the main feature, an electrical
sound system--carrying the recorded strains of the New York
Philharmonic--replaced accompaniment by live musicians. The system was
a hit, even if the film wasn't: Quinn Martin wrote in the New York
World, &quot;You may have the 'Don Juan.' Leave me the Vitaphone.&quot;

Western Electric formed a subsidiary the following January to
handle Western's non-telephone interests. Electrical Research
Products, Inc. (ERPI) developed and distributed studio recording
equipment and sound systems to the major Hollywood studios.
Recognition for Western Electric's contributions to the film industry
soon followed. In 1931, ERPI won an award from the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences for technical achievement. ERPl's system of
noiseless recording was cited as &quot;outstanding scientific achievement
of the past year.&quot; ERPI also made sound equipment for movie theaters,
which it leased, rather than sold- just as the Bell System had leased
out the telephone equipment Western produced. ERPI equipped 879 movie
theaters in 1928, and 2,391 in 1929. By 1932, only 2 percent of open
theaters in America were not wired for sound. Western Electric proved
better at wiring the nations' theaters than at maintaining that
customer base, however, and ERPI abandoned the motion picture theater
business in 1937. The company continued to produce sound equipment for
movie studios until 1956, when as part of the consent decree it
abandoned most non-telephone enterprise. The company left a legacy in
the motion picture industry, one reminder of which is the credit at
the end of many films from Hollywood's Golden Age: &quot;Sound by Western
Electric.&quot;
