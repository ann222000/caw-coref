I'm sure other bloggers have done this, but I really want to set the
record straight on what Barack Obama said about Pakistan the other day.
(Yes, this is my second post on Obama tonight; just following a train
of thought...) He said, and I quote: &quot;There are terrorists holed up in
those mountains [in Afghanistan and Pakistan] who murdered 3,000
Americans. They are plotting to strike again. It was a terrible mistake
to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al Qaeda leadership
meeting in 2005. If we have actionable intelligence about high-value
terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will.&quot;Now, here
are a few things the senator didn't say:- that we should invade
Pakistan as we did Iraq- that Pakistan would not be considered an ally
by an Obama administration- that he opposes the war in Iraq but would
be happy to take the &quot;war on terror&quot; to other places, like Pakistan and
perhaps Iran, too- that the U.S. shouldn't respect Pakistani
sovereigntyBut you wouldn't know it from the furor, both here and
abroad, sparked by his words, since in the last week he's been accused
of harboring all of the above-mentioned views and then some. Sample
headlines include, &quot;Obama Vows to Hunt Terrorists in
Pakistan,&quot; &quot;Pakistan and Afghanistan Better Watch Out,&quot; &quot;Obama Might
Send Troops to Pakistan,&quot; and &quot;Obama Says He'd Invade
Pakistan.&quot;Actually, I'm fairly sure he wasn't saying anything of the
sort. After all, this is the guy who in the CNN/YouTube debate
notoriously said he'd meet with leaders of &quot;rogue nations&quot; because he
doesn't believe using the &quot;silent treatment&quot; to punish our enemies is a
productive diplomatic strategy. And he hasn't gone back on that remark
despite plenty of pressure. So I seriously doubt that he's now decided
that invading random terrorist-infested Middle Eastern countries is the
way to go.Rather, his comment was about what we do when we know for
almost-certain that there is a high-value al Qaeda leader in a specific
location in Pakistan, and we've done all we can diplomatically to
convince Pakistan to take care of the problem, and it's clear they
think protecting this guy or guys is more important than its
relationship with us. Which is essentially what they did in the 2005
incident Obama mentioned. And yet President Bush still considers
Pakistan a key, close ally in the &quot;War on Terror&quot; and called Pres.
Musharraf just the other day to wish him a happy birthday and try to
smooth his ruffled feathers by dismissing Obama's comment as
meaningless &quot;electioneering.&quot; It's clear from things Obama has said
time and again that he's committed to diplomacy, and that few, if any,
serious contenders are more firmly opposed to Pres. Bush's brand of
cowboy foreign policy. Once the Bush administration gets an idea in its
head, it will go to any lengths to bring it to fruition - even allying
itself with regimes that ultimately do disservice to its purported
purpose. Obama's stated foreign policy, on the other hand, jives with
what British statesman Lord Palmerston said: &quot;Nations have no permanent
friends or allies; they only have permanent interests.&quot; A President
Obama would be willing to talk with Musharraf 'til the cows come home.
But if he is going to refuse to act on clear intelligence showing that
a high-profile terrorist leader is hiding out in a specific location
within his borders, then what kind of ally is he? In that case, Obama
is leaving open the option of coming in, getting the target, and
leaving. Not invading. Not occupying. Not, hopefully, wrecking too much
havoc. Just doing what has to be done.I'm not too surprised that the
Pakistanis are upset. Yes, this scenario would involve a temporary
violation of their sovereignty. Furthermore, declaring itself an ally
of the U.S. in the war on terror was the best thing Pakistan's
government could have done, because that step, paradoxically enough,
allowed Pakistan to largely avoid scrutiny for doing things that might
otherwise arouse America's wrath - like, for instance, turning a blind
eye to terrorists seeking refuge within its borders. So I can see why
the possibility of an Obama administration might raise some hackles
there. But why the furor in this country - for the most part over a
complete distortion of the candidates words? A great deal of the
self-righteous finger-pointing has come from the right, and that's
telling. In the general election, a get-tough stand will almost
certainly help Obama, by helping to allay fears about his lack of
experience and combating the impression that he's an ineffectual
idealist who isn't ready for the world stage. But in the primary, an
impression that Obama wants to invade Pakistan could spell disaster.
After all, he's gotten a lot of mileage out of the fact that his
current biggest rival, Sen. Clinton, originally voted to authorize the
war in Iraq, whereas he opposed it from the beginning. He's been
positioning himself as the leading anti-war candidate, exceeded in his
fervor perhaps only by Dennis Kucinich. But if the part of the
Democratic base that's been demonstrating against the Iraq War for
years gets the idea that Obama wants to get us out of Iraq only to put
us into Pakistan, it may be all over for him.That's why I'm imploring
people to stop twisting the senator's words. Whether or not you support
Obama or even like him, let's please make this a fair fight.- KPE
