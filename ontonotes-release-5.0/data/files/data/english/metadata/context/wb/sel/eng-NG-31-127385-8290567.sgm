Rural climate change sceptics shock kayaker
Thursday, 09 August 2007

A man paddling and pulling his kayak from Brisbane to Adelaide to promote
the need for action on climate change says he is disappointed with the sceptical
nature of outback Australians.

Steve Posselt, who is pulling his kayak along the Darling River road due
to a lack of water, says that many rural people do not believe in climate
change.

He says he did not expect so many people to doubt what the majority of
climate scientists agree on.

&quot;I've been astounded by the actual lack of belief on this trip,&quot; he said.

&quot;Many people want to argue the issue about whether there is such a thing
as global warming.

&quot;You can talk to blokes in the pub and they say yep winters aren't what
they used to be, they're a lot shorter.

&quot;And you say, 'well do you believe in climate change? No, mate its just a
cycle'.&quot;

Bonzo

&quot;This cooling has already killed hundreds of thousands of people. If it
continues and no strong action is taken, it will cause world famine, world chaos
and world war, and this could all come about before the year 2000.&quot;Lowell Ponte,

VOA News - Climate Panel Recommends Global Temperature Ceiling, Carbon Tax

Climate Panel Recommends Global Temperature Ceiling, Carbon
Tax
By Peter Heinlein
United Nations
28 February 2007

A panel of scientists has presented the United Nations a detailed
plan for combating climate change. VOA's correspondent at the U.N.
Peter Heinlein reports the strategy involves reaching a global
agreement on a temperature ceiling.

A group of 18 scientists from 11 countries is calling on the
international community to act quickly to prevent catastrophic
climate change.

In a report requested by the United Nations and partially paid for
by the privately funded U.N. Foundation, the panel warns that any
delay could lead to a dangerous rise in sea levels, increasingly
turbulent weather, droughts and disease.

The report was issued three weeks after the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change concluded that global warming is real and caused
in large part by human activity. But unlike the IPCC report, this
latest document makes policy recommendations.

Panel member John Holdren of Harvard University says the world must
be mobilized immediately to avoid catastrophe. &quot;Climate change is
real, it's already happening, it's already causing harm, it's
accelerating and we need to do something about it, and we need to do
something about it seriously, starting now. Our specific conclusions
are that if the world were to go past the point of an increase above
pre-industrial temperatures greater than 2 to 2.5 degrees Celsius,
we would be in a regime where the danger of intolerable and
unmanageable impacts on well-being would rise very rapidly,&quot; he
said.
The panel's recommendations include a series of steps to cut the
rate at which temperatures are rising. Chief among them are a global
agreement on an acceptable ceiling for temperature rise and finding
ways of adapting to cope with the damage already done.

Holdren, however, says even these measure will achieve very little
unless they are accompanied by a global tax on greenhouse gas
emissions. &quot;We don't think ultimately society will get it right in
terms of the full range and scope of activities needed to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, until there is an additional incentive in
the form of a price on greenhouse gas emissions, either through a
carbon tax or a cap and trade approach,&quot; he said.

The United States is the biggest emitter of greenhouse gasses, but
is not a party to the cap and trade system contained in the Kyoto
Protocol on climate change.

Nevertheless, the Bush administration has set a target of cutting
U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 18 percent by 2012, and is spending
$3 billion a year on climate change research.

Peter Raven, the head of the Sigma Xi Scientific society and
co-author of the latest report, says success in limiting the effects
of global warming will require private sector leadership, and a
combined effort by the U.S. and the international community. &quot;The
private sector is doing a very good job, and kind of leadership
we're calling for from the United Nations and international
organizations and the kind of leadership the United States is moving
towards will both be key ingredients in that,&quot; he said.

A U.N. spokesman says Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is considering
calling a summit meeting on climate change later this year.

Environmental activists are calling on Mr. Ban to play a leading
role in the process of negotiating a successor to the Kyoto
agreement, which expires in 2012.

Right off, this is wrong.

Rather casts doubt on the entire article.

And the cap and trade ideas ain't science, have nothing to *do* with
science, and are idiotic if your goals are to reduce CO2. If your goals
are to increase costs for everyone to no effect, they are a good idea.
But that kind of idiocy is in the realm of politics by trade, and sadly
more and more sciences every day. Course, science is a captive slave of
politics, so it'll say what politics demands.

Cheers,

Rich

Sorry, the U.S. currently emits more CO2 and other greenhouse gasses than
any other nation on earth, both in absolute tems and on a per-person basis.
China is second in absolute terms, but very, very distant from AmeriKKKa on
a per-person basis.

Having a population that is 4.4 times the size of AmeriKKKa, China of
course will ultimately be permitted to emit 4.4 times as much CO2 in total
as AmeriKKKa. And now China isn't quite on par with the U.S. on this scale.

No, it's the proposal of economists.  Limit overall emissions while giving
industry the ability to adjust fluidly to the reduced emissions, rather than
having a fixed percentage cuts for every business or every sector mandated
by inflexable government fiat.

Your alternative for cutting CO2 emissions are what Rich?  And why isn't

As usual, the brain dead Libertarian pond scum presumes the world is
infinately large and has infinite resources.

Extinction is enevitable if Bawana's claim that man can not stop raising
the CO2 content of the atmosphere.

First CO2 concentration will double, and then it will triple, and then it
will be 10 times higher than today, and then 20 times higher, and then 40
times higher, and at that point mankind will have exterminated itself by
means of  CO2 poisonng.

So if the extinction of Man is to be avoided then it is a simple fact that
man must reduce CO2 emissions to match the rate at which nature will
sequester the pollutant.  And that is a rate that is about a third to a
quarter of what the emissions are today.

So the choice is reduce emissions or extinction.  It's as simple as that.

You can reduce emissions now when it's easy, or later when significant
damage to the biosphere has been done and reductions are harder.
