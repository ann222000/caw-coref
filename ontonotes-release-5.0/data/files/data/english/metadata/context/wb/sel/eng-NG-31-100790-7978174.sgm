I've had previous versions of this game and I remember the game didn't come
with the names of the players.  You had to go get them off the internet
somewhere and pay for them!!  Is this going to be the case again? Or, will
the game come with the player names?

thanks

&gt; The NCAA doesn't allow their players names to be used for profit (i.e.

Hypocrites. They do allow players IMAGES to be used for profit (and NOT for
the player.)

Yep...NCAA rules prohibit marketing of individual players...so you
will have to buy the file again...unless you like 'HB24' or 'WR53'...

According to NCAA rules, EA cannot put names into the game like they
do for Madden because it is illegal for schools to make money from a
college athlete's name on merchandise. ALL versions of college sports
games you'll ever see will never have names, just numbers.

I must warn you that this year's NCAA Football 08 IMO did an extremely
poor job this year of getting rosters correct for even the major
schools. My favorite school is a major power in the Big 12 and they
have SERIOUS flaws in the roster with starters from the DL and OL
missing in this game. EA seems to skimp on something every year and
the money or the people to input rosters was the spot they skimped
this year. MAJOR dissapointment on that front.

In all honesty, if you can find a friend who has one to borrow, use that.
Otherwise, find a used memory card (which is next to impossible this time of
year because of this game).  The problem is that the new memory card is
$39.99.  It really bugged me shelling out that much last year but I had to
have roster names so I did it.  Of course last years version didn't even let
the names show up on line so it was a waste in that sense.

Mattinglyfan,

Thanks for the tip, however, I don't know many people at all personally that
have a 360.  Only one friend of mine has one, but he lives about 300 miles
away, and I don't think he has a mem card, so looks like I'll have to invest
in one anyway.  I guess it will come in handy for NCAA '09, '10, etc...

thanks

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hmmmmm, transfer kit? Don't have one of those, but will look for one.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thanks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; G

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's where I got mine.  If you have a memory card, the transfer kit,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is $19.99.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OK, looks like I'll have to invest in both.  I don't have a memory card
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; either.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; G

&gt;&gt;&gt; In all honesty, if you can find a friend who has one to borrow, use
&gt;&gt;&gt; that. Otherwise, find a used memory card (which is next to impossible
&gt;&gt;&gt; this time of year because of this game).  The problem is that the new
&gt;&gt;&gt; memory card is $39.99.  It really bugged me shelling out that much last
&gt;&gt;&gt; year but I had to have roster names so I did it.  Of course last years
&gt;&gt;&gt; version didn't even let the names show up on line so it was a waste in
&gt;&gt;&gt; that sense.

&gt;&gt; Mattinglyfan,

&gt;&gt; Thanks for the tip, however, I don't know many people at all personally
&gt;&gt; that have a 360.  Only one friend of mine has one, but he lives about 300
&gt;&gt; miles away, and I don't think he has a mem card, so looks like I'll have
&gt;&gt; to invest in one anyway.  I guess it will come in handy for NCAA '09,
&gt;&gt; '10, etc...

&gt; Ok.  Sounds like a plan.  Let me know when you get it and I will email you
&gt; the roster file and directions.

That's mighty kind of you.  I'll try to get one this weekend. As a matter of
fact I may try to sneak out later tonight and go to wal mart after the wife
is asleep:) I'll email you as soon as I get one.

thanks again
Gary

Sorry about all the replies, I'm just finding things out as I go!! This
transfer thing you are talking about, is it made by a company called
&quot;Datel&quot;?  I also left a link to wal mart of all places:). They don't have
them available online, but maybe I can find this at one of the wal mart
stores, or best buy, etc... i hope:)

Is this it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've had previous versions of this game and I remember the game
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't come with the names of the players.  You had to go get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them off the internet somewhere and pay for them!!  Is this going
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be the case again? Or, will the game come with the player
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; names?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thanks

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have the transfer kit, you can get them for free at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; www.fkrosters.com

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That applies to all NCAA football or basketball games.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hmmmmm, transfer kit? Don't have one of those, but will look for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one. I guess that can be found at the local Best Buy, etc...?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thanks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; G

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's where I got mine.  If you have a memory card, the transfer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kit, is $19.99.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OK, looks like I'll have to invest in both.  I don't have a memory
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; card either.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; G

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In all honesty, if you can find a friend who has one to borrow, use
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that. Otherwise, find a used memory card (which is next to impossible
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this time of year because of this game).  The problem is that the new
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; memory card is $39.99.  It really bugged me shelling out that much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last year but I had to have roster names so I did it.  Of course last
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; years version didn't even let the names show up on line so it was a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; waste in that sense.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mattinglyfan,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for the tip, however, I don't know many people at all personally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that have a 360.  Only one friend of mine has one, but he lives about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 300 miles away, and I don't think he has a mem card, so looks like I'll
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have to invest in one anyway.  I guess it will come in handy for NCAA
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; '09, '10, etc...

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok.  Sounds like a plan.  Let me know when you get it and I will email
&gt;&gt;&gt; you the roster file and directions.

&gt;&gt; Sorry about all the replies, I'm just finding things out as I go!! This
&gt;&gt; transfer thing you are talking about, is it made by a company called
&gt;&gt; &quot;Datel&quot;?  I also left a link to wal mart of all places:). They don't have
&gt;&gt; them available online, but maybe I can find this at one of the wal mart
&gt;&gt; stores, or best buy, etc... i hope:)

&gt;&gt; http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5131554

&gt;&gt; Is this it?

&gt; Yup that's it.  They will definitely have them in Best Buy.  Not sure
&gt; about Wal Mart.

&gt;&gt; The NCAA doesn't allow their players names to be used for profit (i.e.
&gt;&gt; video games, endorsements, etc.)

&gt; Hypocrites. They do allow players IMAGES to be used for profit (and NOT
&gt; for the player.)

If the player was making money playing football he would be a professional
and not a college athlete.
