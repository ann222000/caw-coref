The anti-gun nuts always seem to trot out the old line, "But, it's
the _Militia_ that get the guns" and everybody's wondering what the
militia is.

Well, just parse the sentence (I don't remember how to diagram it),

"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free
state, ..."

This is a _subordinate clause_.

The proper interpretation is, "Since it is necessary to regulate the
militia, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be
infringed."

That means, it's YOUR JOB to regulate the "militia": when they get
out of control and send the storm troopers to your door, you're supposed
to say, "&lt;Click&gt; Think again, bucko!" In fact, it's your DUTY to
defend the Constitution from its enemies, foreign and domestic.

If the Jews had had the backbone to take down a few storm troopers,
there probably would never have been a Holocaust.

Rich, I invite you to read a history of the Warsaw Ghetto.  I recommend
Kasimiercz Moczarski's "Conversations with an Executioner."  Moczarski
was a Polish communist who spent a year sharing a prison cell with SS
General Jurgen Stroop, who commanded the liquidation of the Ghetto.

They fought, all right.

There was a lively debate during our nation's founding concerning
whether a Federal government--and/or a standing army--might pose a
threat to the liberties of the citizens of the Several States,
memorialized in The Federalist Papers by Madison, Hamilton, and Jay.
Many citizens entirely opposed a standing army for fear it might be
used against them.

Here are two samples: (long, below)

Cheers,
James Arthur

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FEDERALIST No. 29,  Concerning the Militia

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the Daily Advertiser.  Thursday, January 10, 1788
">

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HAMILTON

[...]
This will not only lessen the call for military establishments,
but if circumstances should at any time oblige the government
to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable
to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of
citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and
the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and
those of their fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only
substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best
possible security against it, if it should exist.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FEDERALIST No. 46, The Influence of the State and Federal Governments
Compared

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the New York Packet. Tuesday, January 29, 1788.
">

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MADISON
The only refuge left for those who prophesy the downfall of the State
governments is the visionary supposition that the federal government
may previously accumulate a military force for the projects of
ambition.

[...]
The highest number to which, according to the best computation, a
standing army can be carried in any country, does not exceed one
hundredth part of the whole number of souls; or one twenty-fifth part
of the number able to bear arms. This proportion would not yield, in
the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand
men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a
million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen
from
among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and
conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence.

It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could
ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Those who
are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this
country against the British arms, will be most inclined to deny the
possibility of it. Besides the advantage of being armed, which the
Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the
existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are
attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a
barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than
any which a simple government of any form can admit of.

Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms
of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear,
the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is
not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake
off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional
advantages of local governments chosen by themselves,
who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and
of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and
attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the
greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would
be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.

The 2nd amendment allows for states to have a national guard. That is
why the criminal lobby (NRA) never uses the 2nd amendment in any

Iraq was awash in guns, but nobody took out Saddam.  So what makes you
think a few armed citizens would have taken down Hilter, especially
since Hitler, unlike Bush, was legally elected.

I suggest reading "Armed America" by Clayton E.Cramer.It's about gun
ownership from Colonial times to early 1900s.

Consider that the US was created by the armed overthrow of the incumbent
Briutish government;from the reading of the Declaration of Independence,the
Founders recognized that governments go bad,and need to be reformed or done
away with,and that arms in citizens hands would be necessary to achieve
that.
the 2nd Amendment is essentially the "reset button" of the Constitution.

The militia is anything a state wishes it to be. The US Constitution
empowers states to select the officers of their militias (that pretty
much rules out Bubba grabbing a rifle, a case of beer and going out
target shooting from calling himself a militia).

The Constitution also restricts the power to arm a militia to Congress.
So, whatever the states do, they can't assemble an armed militia unless
they do so from a population that happens to be armed.

The second amendment is just the federal gov'ts promise not to interfere
with the states rights to have a pool of armed persons for the purpose
of assembling their militia. If a state chooses to disarm its public,
then it had better be satisfied with an unarmed police force (or
whatever it wants to call its militia). Even a statute that allows arms
to a person once hired for a militia could be a violation of the
Constitution.

That's doubtful. Picture any minority group standing up to what would be
the equivalent of a National Guard unit with any hope of success. The
best chance an armed public has at resisting a police state is its
ability to make it redundant. No such organization could be justified if
their only duty was to show up after the criminals have been shot by
their victims in order to string up the yellow tape and draw the chalk
outlines.

&gt; &gt; Kasimiercz Moczarski's &quot;Conversations with an Executioner.&quot;  Moczarski was
&gt; &gt; a Polish communist who spent a year sharing a prison cell with SS General
&gt; &gt; Jurgen Stroop, who commanded the liquidation of the Ghetto.

It depends whether that "minority group" had any popular support,and how
much a minority they were.
EuroJews didn't have that,they were demonized prior to the Nazi actions.

HOWEVER;the Constitution does NOT say "right of a militia",or "right of a
State",it CLEARLY says "right of the PEOPLE" to keep and bear arms shall
not be infringed. It's an individual right,and NOT dependent on being in a
militia.(there was no such thing as "collective" rights then.)

Basically,it's boils down to "people get to have arms[guns,other arms too]
so we can form a militia if needed."
The Founders recognized that the citizens must have the RKBA to have power
over their government.

People of colonial times privately owned their own cannon,warships.
Thus the term "Privateer" for some warships.

see "Armed America" by Clayton Cramer  I strongly suggest you read it.

I don't suppose you've seen the South Park episode where the kids are taken in

There's a dialogue that goes something like this:

&gt;&gt; The best way to prevent war is to not have any governments at all - just

&gt; I don't suppose you've seen the South Park episode where the kids are

&gt; Woodstock-like concert? There's a dialogue that goes something like this:

So, you take your government=addiction and steal a caricature to
"illustrate" how "necessary" it is.

Just because there's no government doesn't mean there won't be any
factories, just that they'll be able to operate without all of the insane
edicts the government saddles them with today.

"But what about unscrupulous robber barons that cheat you and sell you
poison?"

Well, it's bad business to sell poison, because dead customers do not make
gooe repeat customers.

About them selling crap for too much money, the answer to that is to have
a Mom who taught you to think. Vote with your dollars - if you don't like
their crap, don't buy it. That's what "competition" means.

Sheesh! Don't they teach you kids anything any more?

it.

&gt; Iraq was awash in guns, but nobody took out Saddam.  So what makes you
&gt; think a few armed citizens would have taken down Hilter, especially
&gt; since Hitler, unlike Bush, was legally elected.- Hide quoted text -
">

After losing to Hindenberg (twice) in the Presidential election, he
was appointed (not elected) Chancellor.  In the next Reichstag
election his party failed to win a majority, but they had a strong
enough coalition to pass a set of laws eliminating the Presidency and
transferring most state power to Hitler.  Those laws were approved by
a national plebiscite (approx 85% approval) so I guess you could say
he won that election, although it was not a direct election to office.

That is one of the reasons I am very suspicious of leaders who attempt
to pass laws strengthening their own positiion, like the Patriot Act
and the Military Tribunal Act.

I believe that to be untrue.
Can you cite where this prohibition is in the Constitution?
It also does not make sense,as if only the Federal gov't could arm
militias,then they could neglect to,or refuse to and the states and
citizenry would be powerless over the Federal gov't.

Also,in colonial times,states DID arm militias,if they were called out,as
States also can call out their militias.
More recently,in some recent natural disasters,Governors called out their
National Guard,ARMED,to restore order.Louisiana is one such state.

Wrong,as Cramer showed that states did arm those militia members too poor

those who mustered without their own arms,or paid the unarmed less than the

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To be accurate, every (able-bodied) man is eligible to join a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; militia, or the armed forces.

&gt; &gt;&gt; In Colonial and post-Revolution times,citizens reporting for militia
&gt; &gt;&gt; duty were expected to bring *their own arms and ammo*.

&gt; &gt; Not just expected to, they had to. States were (and are) prohibited
&gt; &gt; from arming a militia.

&gt; I believe that to be untrue.
&gt; Can you cite where this prohibition is in the Constitution?
">

Article I, Section 8 "The Congress shall have power.....To provide for
organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia,..."

That and the 10th amendment:

"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively,
or
to the people."

The way I read that is: arming the militia is a power delegated to the
United States (Congress) by the Constitution.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It also does not make sense,as if only the Federal gov't could arm
&gt; militias,then they could neglect to,or refuse to and the states and
&gt; citizenry would be powerless over the Federal gov't.
">

That's what the 2nd amendment was added for. It was a promise not to
disarm the people (the states already having been 'disarmed') so that
the states may call them to serve in militias.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also,in colonial times,states DID arm militias,if they were called out,as
&gt; States also can call out their militias.
&gt; More recently,in some recent natural disasters,Governors called out their
&gt; National Guard,ARMED,to restore order.Louisiana is one such state.

The National Guard is armed by an act of Congress.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The Founders clearly expected private citizens to be armed,thus the
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2ndAmendment to protect that RKBA of &quot;the People&quot;.
&gt; &gt;&gt; (see &quot;Armed America&quot; by Clayton Cramer.)

&gt; &gt; That's correct. The founding fathers didn't want various states to
&gt; &gt; form armies that could be turned against its residents (or other
&gt; &gt; states).

&gt; Wrong,as Cramer showed that states did arm those militia members too poor
&gt; or who did not appear for muster armed.Some states had provision for fining
&gt; those who mustered without their own arms,or paid the unarmed less than the
&gt; properly armed.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Furthermore, this is statutory, not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; constitutional. There is no definition of an 'unorganized' militia
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in the constitution.

&gt; http://www.constitution.org/mil/ustx_law.htm

&gt; Subchapter D. Texas State Guard
&gt; 431.051. Supplemental Militia

&gt; To provide militia strength for use by the state as a supplement to the
&gt; Texas National Guard, the Texas State Guard exists as part of the state
&gt; militia under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and a
&gt; defense force under 32 U.S.C. Section 109.
">

So, is that the states right to assemble a militia of armed citizens, or
the states right to arm them? I think its the former. The gun grabbers
think its the latter.

&gt; &gt; The 2nd amendment allows for states to have a national guard. That is
&gt; &gt; why the criminal lobby (NRA) never uses the 2nd amendment in any
&gt; &gt; lawsuit.

&gt; &gt; Iraq was awash in guns, but nobody took out Saddam.  So what makes you
&gt; &gt; think a few armed citizens would have taken down Hilter, especially
&gt; &gt; since Hitler, unlike Bush, was legally elected.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; After losing to Hindenberg (twice) in the Presidential election, he
&gt; was appointed (not elected) Chancellor.  In the next Reichstag
&gt; election his party failed to win a majority, but they had a strong
&gt; enough coalition to pass a set of laws eliminating the Presidency and
&gt; transferring most state power to Hitler.  Those laws were approved by
&gt; a national plebiscite (approx 85% approval) so I guess you could say
&gt; he won that election, although it was not a direct election to office.

&gt; That is one of the reasons I am very suspicious of leaders who attempt
&gt; to pass laws strengthening their own positiion, like the Patriot Act
&gt; and the Military Tribunal Act.

This may come as a surprise to you, but the Constitution is made up of
more than that one sentence. You have to dig through the entire document
plus enabling legislation to understand it.

Which does NOT *prohibit* states from arming their militias on their own.
As I have cited,it was common in early America for *states* to arm militia
members who were too poor to afford their own arms.There was no complain
from the Federal government about states arming their militias.
Even today,Texas still has their own state militia,NOT part of the National
Guard.Other states have neglected to maintain their own state militias.That
doesn't mean they can't reform them if they decided to.

USCode Title 10,subtitle A,part I,Chapeter 13;311

(a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at
least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32,
under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention
to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the
United States who are members of the National Guard.
(b) The classes of the militia are—
(1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the
Naval Militia; and

**the Pertinent part**;

(2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia
who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.

This is current law.

But NOT prohibited by it to the States.

USC Title 32;109
(a) In time of peace, a State or Territory, Puerto Rico, the Virgin
Islands, or the District of Columbia may maintain no troops other than
those of its National Guard and defense forces authorized by subsection
(c).
(b) Nothing in this title limits the right of a State or Territory, Puerto
Rico, the Virgin Islands, or the District of Columbia to use its National
Guard or its defense forces authorized by subsection (c) within its borders
in time of peace, or prevents it from organizing and maintaining police or
constabulary.
(c) In addition to its National Guard, if any, a State or Territory, Puerto
Rico, the Virgin Islands, or the District of Columbia may, as provided by
its laws, organize and maintain defense forces. A defense force established
under this section may be used within the jurisdiction concerned, as its
chief executive (or commanding general in the case of the District of
Columbia) considers necessary, but it may not be called, ordered, or
drafted into the armed forces.
(d) A member of a defense force established under subsection (c) is not,
because of that membership, exempt from service in the armed forces, nor is
he entitled to pay, allowances, subsistence, transportation, or medical
care or treatment, from funds of the United States.
(e) A person may not become a member of a defense force established under
subsection (c) if he is a member of a reserve component of the armed
forces.

Note the phrase "reserve component of the armed forces";that shows that the
NG is PART of the regular military.(not a "militia")

&gt; &gt; &quot;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
&gt; &gt;  State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
&gt; &gt;  infringed.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Show me where in that sentence it says anyting about a &quot;national
&gt; &gt; guard&quot;

&gt; This may come as a surprise to you, but the Constitution is made up of
&gt; more than that one sentence. You have to dig through the entire document
&gt; plus enabling legislation to understand it.

Nonsense.  Laws don't modify the Constitution.

Ok, I'll see your wiki entry and raise a recent appellate (DC) court
ruling:

Liberals are driven by hope.

Reactionaries are driven by fear.

Thus:

Reactionism is a mental illness.

Hard and fast rules limiting police conduct may challenge common sense,
while the absence of such rules may invite arbitrary and abusive conduct.
This paper discusses one of the most troubling and difficult questions
pertaining to the ideal of legality: To what extent, if at all, is it proper
for law enforcement officials to employ trickery and deceit as part of their
law enforcement practices?

Whatever the answer to that question--if, indeed, an answer be
formulated--it has to be measured against a hard reality of the criminal
justice system.  That reality is: Deception is considered by police--and
courts as well--to be as natural to detecting as pouncing is to a cat.  As
we shall see, that is why it is so difficult both to control deceptive
practices of detectives and to prescribe long-term measures to guarantee
control.

Scholarly evidence of testimonial lying was revealed in a study conducted by
Columbia law students in which they analyzed the effect of Mapp v. Ohio on
police practices in New York City.  In  Mapp, the Supreme Court held that
the federal exclusionary rule in search and seizure cases was binding on the
states.  New York was the only large state that had not previously adopted
the exclusionary rule as a matter of state law.  (The exclusionary rule, of
course, suppresses at trial evidence that was illegally obtained usually in
violation of the Fourth Amendment.)  The students analyzed the evidentiary
grounds for arrest and subsequent disposition of misdemeanor narcotics cases
before and after the Mapp decision.  Based on officers' accounts of the
evidence for the arrest (see table) the student authors concluded that:

"uniform police have been fabricating grounds of arrest in narcotics cases
in order to circumvent the requirements of Mapp.  Without knowledge of the
results of this study, the two Criminal Courts judges and the two Assistant
District Attorneys interviewed doubted that a substantial reform of police
practices had occurred since Mapp.  Rather, they believe that police
officers are fabricating evidence to avoid Mapp."

&gt;&gt;My opinion:  another reason the Patriot Act (what a horribly

&gt; My feeling about the Patriot Act is pretty much the same as my feeling
&gt; about &quot;Hate&quot; Crime Laws.

&gt; Unnecessary... already covered properly by existing law.

&gt; Though any law that rounds up leftist weenies is alright in my boat

Fine - as long as you row your little boat as far as possible from decent
