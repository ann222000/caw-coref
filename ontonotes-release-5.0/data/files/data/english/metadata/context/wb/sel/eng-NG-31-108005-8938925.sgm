It certainly is 'loud' Debi, but looks great. Well done.

Well done Debi!  That doesn't look easy to do...  You can get a load
of fabric in that on your next quilt sho/shop hop trip:)
and your friends will be able to spot you a mile off .&gt;G&lt;

Thanks Dee. It is for a friend's daughter and she picked the pink with lime
polka dots. I added the lime green accents; call it artistic license.;-)
Pink is not my favorite color to wear, (though I love pink flowers and the
like) so this is not mine. I hope it holds up to a 12 year old girl and all
her books for school. It should; between the sewing the different layers
together, each strap and seam has about 4 or 5 lines of stitching across it.
It wasn't too terrible to make. The pattern was pretty easy to follow, but I
did have to go back after I was 'finished' (yeah, right!;-) and open the
seam again at the bottom on either side because I forgot to sew in the
bottom triangles that hold the bottom end of the straps.
I may make myself one by the same pattern but with some lovely prequilted
blue and yellow floral fabric Mom bought me a while back.
Mine will be able to hold a lot of stuff... maybe next time have a few
dollars and go to the quilt store (I found one fairly close to me, only a 40
minute drive!)

LOL Elly. Mine (when I make it) will still be pretty loud, but much more my
kind of loud...

Thanks, Charlotte. Despite a few hairy moments, it was fun. The next one
will probably go a bit faster.

Thanks, Leslie. I can't take credit for the fabric. My friend's daughter is
responsible for that, since it is to be hers. She wanted a Vera Bradley
backpack, but my friend balked at paying $80-something dollars for one. I
may charge her half that (if that much), to cover my costs (pattern, thread,
zippers, extra grey hair...;-)

Debi,
Did you say where you got the pattern?  Your backpack is truly original,
and I can see myself making an even wilder one!

where did the pattern come from? I've been musing over making a back
pack, though I haven't really looked for a pattern, I haven't really
stumbled across one either.

It's a booklet by Cindy Taylor Oates called, simply enough &quot;Backpacks&quot; there
are a few variations on the theme and a large and smaller one. I made the
large one, since it is to be a school backpack for my friend's daughter. I
hope she likes it!
Yeah, I could get wild. I envision one with each piece a different batik!

I'm not a pink person either Debi, but blue and yellow I love.

Pink and green look ideal for a 12 year old, and it looks like it will
hold a lot of books too.

Thank you! I delivered it last night after my class. though it was after
hours at the vet school. Left it on the counter of our office for Brandee to
pick up and take home to her daughter. I sure hope my coworkers remember
what it is and don't think some random kid left an empty backpack lying on
the counter of a locked office ;-)
