Hi folks,

Please forgive two posts in one day. Blame Peter Haines for trying to
hurry an old man.
I am much obliged to Dave Taylor and Doug Everingham for their detailed
responses to #8 and to Peter Haines, Aaron King, Bill Green, and Aaron
King again for their responses to my 07-20-05 note, &quot;Peter Haines on
eight causes of a deficiency of purchasing power.&quot; Although these six
responses showed little agreement with my sense of the Evolving Global
Republic, I was delighted to see the subject receive such serious
attention.
To show the diversity of view points represented, and to reduce the
length of this post, I have copied below a brief excerpt which seemed to
best convey the sense of each response. Following the six excerpts, I
will try again to bring into sharp focus the path to our common goal of a
Global Republic with liberty and justice for all.

Basically I am trying to avoid making a dogmatic statement (eg your
&quot;taxes must be paid&quot;) which people will simply object to. I am trying to
show that there is a better alternative to what we are doing now, which
has the effect we are both trying to achieve.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;A public policy which will satisfy these
&gt;requirements for stability, sustainablity,
&gt;and justice must be systemic in the sense
&gt;that the policy affects and influences the
&gt;thinking and acting of the entire population.

I agree. So everybody must be taught to think this way; but that means
we have to start with re-educating the teachers, in particular academics
in the field of economics.

Best

&quot;From each according to his ability, (a flat tax)

***I like his formula, and its source confirms
my view that social activists don't have to call
upon religious slogans to outline a 'temple
secret'. I don't like Wes's parenthetic
interpretation that this is a &quot;flat tax&quot;. In justice
it should be the opposite of flat taxes like VAT
or GST or poll tax. It should be graduated or
related to capacity to pay, possibly
concentrating on Henry Georgist 'site rent'
or comunity betterment levies rather than
other wealth taxes. -- DE***
[WSB In the US a flat tax, if we had one, would collect X% of earned or
unearned income from every level of income. The biblical tithe is a 10%
flat tax. VAT
or GST are indirect taxes, which increases the cost of subsistence, by
means of which the late great USSR collected 92% of its public revenue,
with only 8% collected from direct taxes on personal income.
Direct taxes on personal income are the investment by which the WHIPs
(wealthy, healthy, intelligent, and powerful folks) of each nation can
prolong their good fortune. WSB]

I think that this is where I part ways with many of the other posters on
this list, because their focus 'seems' to be (and I could be wrong) on
increasing purchasing power rather than on distributing property and
seeing that it REMAINS distributed... this is likely because the first
'solution'
remains the easier one... it is something that we can all envision (i.e.
giving people money so that they can buy goods that they 'need');
however, the vast majority of Americans can already purchase the goods
that they really need, the problem comes from buying BEYOND their means
and I am not sure that increased purchasing power will curb this tendency
(which fuels the usury that is undermining people's long-term ability to
support
themselves).

Howdy Wes,

Thanks for the compliment.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Snip ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your extra three points read like identifying real needs that the lower
income class have and saying this is what a Dividend is needed for
and/but thus as you get up into the middle class there is no dividend
needed unless you identified needs for people at that standard of living.
To say that society needs a dividend and show stats of what things are
commonly lacking in lower income families is legitimate as an argument
for the need for the system to provide funds that need to be injected
into the economy through consumers, other than through employment,
because thats the conclusion of the theorem.
So I conclude that the lower income group are the more likely to wear the
deficiency in the system than anyone as a symptim/evidence rather than
the cause. They are the biggest victims.

[WSB I reached the same conclusion in 1969 after seeing the US C.P.I.
profile, 1789 to 1966, in the October 1966 issue of FORTUNE magazine.
Only Republicans and members of the Chicago School of Economics who
learned their economics from Ayn Rand and Chairman Greenspan believe that
poor folks &quot;cause&quot; of their own misfortune. The whole population cannot
have above average ability to earn income. WSB]

oh, but it does...

speculation on the ownership of land rewards the hoarding and inefficient
distribution &amp; use. granting limited liability protection, corporate
personhood and intellectual property laws rewards the growth of
corporations way beyond reasonable size. Why use government tax policy
to do (protect the small business owners) what can be
done by removing privilege instead?

[WSB removing privileges which corporations have enjoyed since the
beginning of the industrial revolution will be difficult. Extending the
same privileges to households would be an easy sell. Then we could have
both efficient corporations and happy households. WSB]

King answers Bill Green on 20 Jul 2005:
All of that is fine, so far as it goes, but it does not take into account
the necessity of decentralizing the ownership of property. That is the
core of distributism... what you are describing sounds much more like
socialism to me... and again, I do not say that to be dismissive, but to
be precise... distributism, as I understand it, relies on establishing a
government that
encourages small-time ownership of property....

=========== End six excerpts ==========
It has been my firm conviction, since I opened this line of enquiry in
1969, that there is only one significant systemic defect in the US
economy, and that from this single defect of omission arise all of the
social and economic pathologies which constitute our present condition.
However, the very idea of a single, simple, but profound systemic cause
for our multitude of social and economic pathologies threatens our
articulate and intellectually gifted social engineers with unemployment.
After all, directing and skinning the public is presently the only game
in town. If the profound systemic cause of our social and economic
pathologies were removed, and society evolved to an optimum condition;
then our social engineers, our &quot;thirteenth tribe,&quot; and our devious
defenders of the status quo would all fall back into the working class.
Their many proposals for the betterment of the working class do not
include joining it. So they say with all sincerity, &quot;if a simple
solution is ever effectively presented to the American taxpayer, it will
be presented over their dead bodies&quot; And American social engineers have
been saying &quot;over my dead body,&quot; not just since President Nixon cut the
Dollar loose from gold in 1971, but since the frontier closed in the
1890s and the US changed from an agrarian (Distributist) nation of
property owning farmers and small business men to an industrial nation of
corporations and propertyless employees. An industrial (Distributist)
nation, on the other hand, needs fewer property owning farmers, more
small business men, and a wider distribution of stockholder equity and
other investments in all businesses as well as in government debt.
All of the sixth grade arithmetic and economic theory needed to define
&quot;The Optimum Policy&quot; (TOP) had been fully developed by the US private
sector before I was born. The following tabulation of data on the cost
of development for the private sector and for the public sector should
raise the question: Why capitalize that expense at 100% in our
corporations and at only 50% in our government? At best, the 20th
century public policy of the US only saved the WHIPs about 3-5% on their
income tax rate.

------------------------------------------------------------
Echoing the opinion of C. H. Douglas, the best financial services that
corporations can invent are available for development in the private
sector, at zero interest and the most favorable terms for repaying the
debt. Since the amount of investment ($/employee) is of the same order
of magnitude in both the public and private sectors, what advantage do
our elected representatives gain by playing Shylock on public sector
investments? If you look at Fig1.gif on the web site below, it appears
that the optimum tax rate is still about 30% of national income, provided
the public revenue is properly invested up front instead of being spent
on welfare, war, and prisons.
Thomas Paine acknowledged TOP in the 1790s, the Vatican acknowledged TOP
in the 1890s, and the emerging Holy Roman Empire acknowledged TOP in the
late 1940s. China and India see no advantage in explaining it to those
who prefer the status quo.
Kind regards,
Wes Burt
