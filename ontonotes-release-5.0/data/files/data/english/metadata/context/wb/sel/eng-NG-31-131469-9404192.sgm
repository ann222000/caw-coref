Review

Prince in Hell is, to date, the only feature film made by director/
co-writer/ co-star Michael Stock; his one other directorial credit is
&quot;Sternenstaub verloren...,&quot; a 2005 short. Released in 1993, Prince in
Hell is an example of the German branch of the gritty and reflexive
New Queer Cinema, which was then being defined by such landmark works
as Gus Van Sant's My Own Private Idaho, Todd Haynes's Poison, and
Derek Jarman's Edward II. Stock's casting the featured role of the
drug dealer with Harry Baer recalls his debt to the late Rainer
Werner Fassbinder, with whom he worked on many films. Of the dozens
of films I've reviewed through this Website, Prince in Hell is one of
only two or three which I did not initiate: a copy was included with
my requested reviewer DVD of Wolfgang Petersen's extraordinary 1977
debut feature, The Consequence. Still, I've spent many hours looking
at Prince in Hell closely and mulling over its techniques and
disturbing assumptions – primarily because I admire Water Bearer
Films, whose releases include six key films by Pier Paolo Pasolini,
and dozens of international GLBT pictures. Prince in Hell has some
effective elements, primarily the acting of the three leads, but
there are many aspects that could have been much more effective; and
the ending... well, my rant comes in the &quot;spoiler&quot; section – along
with a suggestion for how a different, yet simple, ending might have
salvaged the picture. Although I'm far from prudish, I want to NOTE
that, unlike the many other films reviewed at this site, this one
contains some graphic scenes of violence, drug use, and exploitative
sexuality.

The story of Prince in Hell, set in a gypsy-like caravan soon after
the reunification of West and East Germany, is an uneasy mix of
simple and would-be complex. The plot involves the disintegrating
relationship of political activist and basically decent guy Stefan
(Stefan Laarmann – also a co-writer) and East German heroin junkie
Jockel (Michael Stock), and their back and forth involvement with the
ingratiating but downward-spiraling bisexual Micha (Andreas Stadler).
Another storyline involves Micha's young son Sascha (Nils-Leevke
Schmidt) and his fascination with the creepy, exhibitionistic jester
Firlefanz (Wolfram Haack – also a co-writer), whose grotesque
puppets enact a gay fairy tale paralleling the relationship of Stefan
and Jockel. Central to the disintegration of these characters is the
bloated drug dealer Ingolf (Harry Baer), who 'pulls their strings'
with heroin, instead of puppet wires.

The film's strongest aspect is the performers, especially Laarmann,
Stadler and Stock, but virtually all of the performances feel right
– even when the movie's implied worldview, discussed below, feels
horribly forced. I was sorry to learn at the Internet Movie Database
(IMDb), which has an atypically incomplete listing for this film,
that it is the only motion picture done by the talented Stefan
Laarmann. He brought his self-named character to life with fullness
and, as discussed below, offered a perspective which could have
salvaged the entire picture.

For most of the cast, Stock relies on an improvisatory approach,
using actual residents of West Berlin's multi-ethnic – and defiantly
countercultural – Kreuzberg neighborhood (Stadtteil Kreuzberg),
along a remote part of the then-recently fallen Berlin Wall. The
Kreuzberg stretches along a half mile of the Landwehrkanal, which
crosses east and west through the city. The film's primary location
was authentic: a so-called Wagenburg (literally 'car castle' – the
subtitles translate it as 'caravan'), where people live out of their
trucks and cars, sometimes covered in wild graffiti. In the brief
German Wikipedia article on this little-documented film, Stock
reportedly said that he just shot the people around him. (Speaking of
the subtitles, US audiences may find a periodic jolt of double
culture shock, as the German slang is Britishized with terms like
'sod' and 'wanker.')

The picture offers some solid technical elements, including Moss
Fitzpatrick's beguilingly grotesque puppets; Lorenz Haarmann's
cinematography – which captures the disoriented feel of this world;
Margarete Heitmueller's sound – which is simultaneously naturalistic
and symbolic, as when she counterpoints street noises with the
characters' shifting emotional states (most dramatic is her use of
drumming during the chicken slaughter – don't bother looking in the
credits for the standard disclaimer about &quot;no animals were harmed;&quot;
it's unlikely that the bird had a stunt double); Uwe Lauterkorn's
crisp editing. (Haarmann and Heitmueller have had continuous
professional careers in their fields.) All of these elements also
work together to create a strong rhythm which keeps this hour-and-a-
half film moving. But good editing is not the same as good narrative
construction.

Even the brief plot summary, four paragraphs above, suggests the
film's fracture lines. It employs three different perspectives – the
Fassbinder-inspired melodrama of the Stefan/Jockel/Micha ménage à
troi, the 'innocent' perspective of Sascha, and the 'diabolical'
viewpoint of the insufferable jester Firlefanz – but none of them is
effectively developed. Perhaps Stock would have been better served by
seeking inspiration in a powerful, if straightforward, tale of
addiction like Billy Wilder's The Lost Weekend (1945 – trivia buffs
take note: in Charles R. Jackson's original 1944 novel, the Ray
Milland character was gay), then combining that strong classic
narrative with his improvisatory non-actor approach.

For people interested in German cinema, perhaps the most shocking
appearance in this film is Harry Baer, all but unrecognizable from
his recent Fassbinder days. The svelte bad boy of, say, Gods of the
Plague (his languorous nude scene there has become iconic) is here a
bloated, lecherous drug dealer. His presence also, of course, invites
comparisons to this picture's (unwitting) aesthetic godfather,
Fassbinder, not least in the central addictions motif. The
comparisons are revealing.

Both Fassbinder and this film employ distancing techniques as a key
element. While Fasbinder uses the distance implicit in the excesses
of melodrama to give us a rich opportunity, both emotional and
intellectual, to contemplate meaning, Prince in Hell falls short.
Recall the playfully reflexive opening, in which Jockel and Stefan –
sitting by the Landwehrkanal, comfortably affectionate with each
other – mock the passing off-screen tourists. They look directly
into the camera, hence identifying us with the schmoes, whom they
laughingly say are deluding themselves, convinced that they (we) are
seeing the &quot;real&quot; Berlin by &quot;visiting the Brandenburg Gate and the
Reichstag.&quot;

This seemed a promising opening, with likeable performance yoked to a
broader socio-political perspective, managed with a light but
incisive touch. And I don't mind being put in the schmo position, so
long as the film ultimately shows me the error of my ways – and
reveals the promised &quot;reality.&quot; But this film never delivered.
Instead, it kept escalating with increasingly would-be shocking
scenes, which merely seemed increasingly phony, even as it tried to
foist its implicit – one-sided and ugly – worldview on us. Like
too many other movie-makers, Stock confuses bleakness with profundity.

By contrast, Fassbinder, often working with budgets as microscopic as
Stock's, knows that the space between story and audience is filled
not only with a politically charged (Brechtian) openness but with
humanity. This is one of Fassbinder's unique, and defining,
qualities, from the minimalism of the early picture Katzelmacher (do
not miss this film!) to the over-the-top baroque pyrotechnics of his
last work, Querelle. In Fassbinder, the form (inflection of image,
sound and movement) provides not only a commentary on the action but
a rich meaning for each of us to discover and interpret. For example,
in one of his greatest final films, and unlike Prince in Hell a
profound work about the nature of addiction, Veronika Voss, his
stylized use of melodrama, and his elliptical narrative technique
(which reveals both her devolved psychological state and the
historical/socio-political forces which enabled it), allow us to
understand the complex, and contradictory, facets of this drug-addled
former Nazi movie star, as she descends to the expected pathetic/
tragic fate. In other words, we fully understand, and hence can
empathize with, Veronika, however alien her life may be. By
unfortunate contrast, that does not happen in Prince in Hell, which
early on shoots off in two other narrative/thematic directions.

After its opening five minutes, focused on Jockel and Stefan, film
turns to a second intriguing major perspective, that of the young boy
Sascha, trapped in the film's chaotic world of broken-down caravans,
drug addiction, and sharing your living space with goats and pigs.
Viewing adult experience through the lens of childhood is a difficult
but potentially rewarding technique, as Henry James revealed in his
groundbreaking psychological 1897 novel What Maisie Knew, a tale of a
dysfunctional family told entirely from the young daughter's point of
view. Such a radical shift in perspective can reveal much about both
the young observer and the objects of their inquiring gaze. Cinema
offers several rich examples of this insightful strategy, including
such otherwise divergent films as Luis Buñuel's Los Olvidados (1950),
René Clément's Forbidden Games (1952), Satyajit Ray's Pather
Panchali (1955), Charles Laughton's Night of the Hunter (1955), and
Wim Wenders's Alice in the Cities (1974). If only Michael Stock had
boned up on them, instead of Ulrich Edel's grim teen drug movie,
Christiane F. (1981), which the main characters in Prince in Hell
mention they had recently seen on TV. (Trivia buffs take note: Edel
broke successfully into directing US film and television with Last
Exit to Brooklyn (1989), based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr.,
whose book Requiem for a Dream, as shrewdly filmed by Darren
Aronofsky in 2000, is arguably the best picture about drug
addiction.) The boy Nils-Leevke Schmidt is very talented in his
scenes, but he made no other films, and one can surmise that he was a
non-professional actor. Let me respectfully speculate that perhaps it
was technically not feasible to use Sascha as the film's defining
perspective.

A couple of minutes later, yet a third major narrative strategy pops
up, as we're forced to see the action from the point of view of the
repellant jester Firlefanz, whose eye makeup is a telling cross
between that of Klaus Maria Brandauer in Istvan Szabo's Mephisto
(1981) and Divine in John Waters's Pink Flamingos (1972 – from the
final scene of which Stock steals wholesale for this film's
wretchedly unsatisfying end, discussed below in the &quot;spoiler&quot;
section). Firlefanz seems intended as a sort of part-Mephistopheles
(shades of Mephisto, mentioned above) and part-Shakespearean jester,
like the one in King Lear – although Stock might have been more
specifically thinking of Ran (1985), in which Kurosawa both expands
the Fool, renamed Kyoami, and makes him transgendered. But actor and
co-writer Wolfram Haack, who receives top billing in the end credits,
lacks the range to bring any credible depth to what should have been
the film's most provocative role. What makes Firlefanz so skin-
crawlingly grotesque is not so much his garish, and derivative, make-
up; rather it's the feeling that here is a person profoundly out of
touch not only with the world around him (in costume, he parades his
naked groin up and down the crowded streets of the Kreuzberg) but
with himself. Haack depicts the extremity of self-loathing – yet his
writing and performance seem merely a pose, rather than a thematic
device which could have enriched the film by providing an extreme
emotional perspective on this world. A richly disturbing – and
completely succesful – example of this type of character is
Thersites in Shakespeare's deconstruction of the Trojan War, Troilus
and Cressida; that play has a worldview as bleak as the one here, but
Shakespeare's genius as both psychologist and poet allows his
creation both life, as a deformed man (both externally and
internally), and philosophical/moral insight into the deluded Greeks
and Trojans, not least the romance-besotted couple of the play's
title (whose emotional instability would make them feel right at home
in this movie's world).

Firlefanz stages – for a bunch of wide-eyed but clearly impoverished
kiddies – a gay puppet show called &quot;The Prince in Hell,&quot; which all
too obviously parallels, but never illuminates, the main story of
Jockel and Stefan. Even worse, Firlefanz's play is about the
impossibility not only of love but specifically of same-sex love,
when one of the character finds he prefers &quot;magical mushrooms&quot; to his
stalwart boyfriend. Don't these kids get enough gay-denigrating
messages from the mainstream culture? In fact, the Firlefanz through-
line becomes profoundly distasteful, as he dangles his manhood in
virtually every scene, even around his young audience. With the US's
Federal Communications Commission now imposing a fine of $500,000 for
each &quot;indecent incident,&quot; Firlefanz's exhibitionism alone would have
cost this film hundreds of millions of dollars, which is rather more
than its total budget.

The fatalistic device of the puppet master has been much more
effectively used in countless works, beginning with the ancient Greek
tragedians (the gods are the ones pulling the strings) and extending
to Thackeray's oft-filmed 1847 &quot;novel without a hero&quot; Vanity Fair
(the author's own end-page drawing shows Becky Sharp and her cohorts
as puppets going back into a toy box) to, say, Masahiro Shinoda's
Double Suicide (1969), whose black-clad stagehands (considered
&quot;invisible&quot; by Japanese theatre conventions) both remind us of the
live actor's relationship to its source, the 1720 doll-drama The
Double Suicide at Ten No Amijima, and provide an unnerving commentary
on the two protagonists' tortured pull between transgression and
morality. Clearly, that's what Stock was striving for with the puppet
play here, but there are too few scenes of the puppets and way too
many redundant scenes with the self-loathing Firlefanz sans puppet
theatre.

Any of these three somewhat experimental perspectives, or even a much
simpler one à la The Lost Weekend, might have helped yield an
effective film, but none is sufficiently developed, and they all feel
forced.

Perhaps the best, and easiest, solution for structuring the film
would have been to clarify Stefan's role as the central character –
letting us experience the actions and themes through his everyman's
eyes. Stefan is by far the most most likable character: he's
responsible, attempts to understand the larger socio-economic and
political forces at work, tries to help his friends, yet he's clearly
no plaster saint. Laarmann the screenwriter gives Laarmann the actor
enough scenes to show Stefan's all-too-human side, as with his
shyness, jealousy, frustration, not to mention that drunken tirade in
a seedy bar (where he learns never again to knock off a drag queen's
wig), his misguided choice of boyfriends (going from Jockel to Micha
is so frying pan to fire), and his at times excessive flexibility:
would you wait patiently outside a disgusting underground pit while
your lover (Jockel) has sex with strangers, whose forbidden allure is
that they may be undercover cops trying to entrap homosexuals. In
other words, Laarmann makes Stefan human, unlike the one-sidedly
bleak worldview which permeates the film. Below in the 'spoiler'
section, I'll sketch out a different ending, focused solely on
Stefan, which might have retroactively salvaged the entire benighted
picture (or not – you decide).

Besides muddled perspective(s), Prince in Hell presented another
frustration in how it raised many potentially rich themes but never
developed any of them. Principal among these concepts is the social
implications of the recent reunification of Germany (the film was
made, and appears to be set, in 1993). In the symbolism department,
the West seems represented by Stefan, while the East is Jockel, and
presumably Micha; Firlefanz is, as always, odd man out. The culture
clash motif only comes into focus, for the first time, in the
dialogue near the end, when Stefan (less noble than ever) makes some
snarky comments about Jockel and Micha – involving the theft of his
camera – which are tinged with anti-East German stereotypes. Of
course, there is even a suggestion of prejudice built into the
formerly East German characters' names: Jockel slightly suggests the
English slur 'yokel' (a word whose etymology is lost), while Micha's
name is double-edged: both Germanic suggesting 'mich' (me, myeslf)
and 'non-Germanic' with its Russian or Eastern European connotations.
Other names are also fraught: Sabine sounds French (always good for a
soupçon of decadence), while it refers to the infamous ancient rape
of the Sabine women. Disturbingly, Stock is unflattering to Sabine in
many ways – even making her take fashion cues from Boy George circa
Culture Club. Since the strung-out Sabine is the only principal woman
in the cast, one could easily call Prince in a Hell misogynistic.
Ironically, the most revealing name goes to Firlefanz, which is a
medieval German word for a ring dance which, in general usage, is a
synonym for insignificant information and lack of connection, as well
inappropriate excitement around a thing, and awkwardness; it's now
become a cliched name for German punk bands and artists. Well, if the
pointy jester's shoe fits...

In the cold comfort department, much of this film's value comes in
allowing us to see the achievements of other filmmakers dealing more
imaginatively and successfully with comparable themes – recall the
urban wastelands of Derek Jarman's Jubilee (1978) and The Last of
England (1988), as Stock clearly did judging by the final five
minutes of this movie. Also compare this film to Pier Paolo Pasolini,
whose stunning debut feature, Accattone (1961 – also released by
Water Bearer), set in the same down and out milieu as this film, is
at once an psychological study, socio-economic analysis, and
cinematic poetry. The visions of those films, for all of their
despair, horror, and sometimes crushing boredom – and all made on
budgets as minuscule as Prince of Hell's – are aesthetic, like &quot;The
Waste Land&quot; of Eliot's epochal 1922 poem, or Dante's Hell.
Unfortunately and unsatisfyingly, Stock's Hell seems like nothing
more than a bleak pose.

What I found most disturbing, and wrong, with this movie was how its
posturing actually trivializes evil, rather than reveals anything
meaningful about it. Confronting, understanding and challenging
darkness is, of course, essential – but Prince in Hell never does;
in fact, it all but glamorizes (self-)destruction while obscuring its
social roots (which Stefan is grappling with through his reading and
activism). There have been many works, both horrific in their
revelations yet beautiful in their aesthetic achievement, which
explore evil, including the films already mentioned by Pasolini,
Fassbinder, and Jarman. To take just a few major literary examples
from gay or bisexual authors, there are the nineteenth century French
poets Baudelaire (Flowers of Evil) and Rimbaud (A Season in Hell);
novelists Wilde (The Picture of Dorian Gray), Kafka (The Trial),
Genet (Querelle), and Burroughs (Naked Lunch) – if only Stock had
boned up, at least, on such mind-bendingly revealing film adaptations
as Fassbinder's Querelle and Cronenberg's Naked Lunch (1991). There
are even some 'sparkling entertainments' made far richer by their
dark and deconstructive cores, like gay filmmakers George Cukor's
1940 The Philadelphia Story (about a family's disintegration –
before understanding and reconciliation are possible) and Vincente
Minnelli's 1944 Meet Me in St. Louis (the baby sister's horrific
imagination – reflected in the MGM-brightness meets noir-shadows
visual strategy – encloses the family).

Unfortunately, Prince in Hell never even approaches those works. It
never questions its own ugly assumptions; it just continues to pump
them up – bleakness on steroids – until they self destruct in the
abysmal final sequence.

SPOILER ALERT: I'm now going to discuss the ending of this film.

The godawful final five minutes – when Firelefanz commits suicide by
actually hanging himself (unlike the parallel scene near the film's
beginning, which was a sham) – crystallize what's wrong with the
entire movie. In a nutshell, the ending tires to be Shattering!
(capital S and exclamation mark), but instead is ludicrously bad
because it's so phony – and because it never answers the questions
posed by the puppets: &quot;What does it mean?&quot; Heartless and/or relieved
audience members might even clap at Firlefanz's suicide, because he
is such an annoying a**hole. Of course, that was not the intention –
far from it.

Seeing, for the first time, Firlefanz denuded of his jester's makeup
implies that this is supposed to be bald Honesty; the fact that it is
literally the end of the film gives it even grander pretensions,
namely, that this is a Vision Of The Unvarnished Hideous Truth Of
Life ITSELF! In a pathetic attempt to compound the would-be shock and
awe of this resolution – and to keep John Waters's lawyers away re a
Pink Flamingos copyright infringement – Stock actually has the
unnervingly quiet little boy watching (as he did in the much earlier
'rhyming' scene). Vastly more disturbing than the scene is the
abusive implications of forcing a real-life child, actor or not, to
watch this excresence. The coup de grâce comes with a tail-wagging
dog enthusiastically gobbling down the chunks of Firlefanz's feces,
which plop out of his hanging corpse as rapidly as, say, gagging and/
or guffawing audience members exiting the theatre. In truth, rather
than be shocked by this ludicrously repellant image, I kept wondering
what the turds were actually made of, since they so delighted the
pooch: considering their source, my guess is ham.

Okay, now that we've recovered from the horror (the horror), let's
look at the (ahem) philosophical implications of this scene, which
reflects the underlying worldview of the entire bitter film. It is a
view of human nature fully as rancid as that of any gay-hating right-
winger weaned on deceptively labeled &quot;traditional values&quot; – which
are founded on the self-fulfilling belief that people are weak, self-
indulgent, lusting, bestial... and nothing more (until they're
&quot;saved&quot; by utter conformity to one or another absolutist, yet
unprovable, belief system). Examples of such &quot;traditionalist&quot; types,
in this movie, would include the gratuitous Neo-Nazi gay bashers who
are predictably trundled out near the end – since all 'serious gay
dramas' have to have bashers... and the story needs to be wrapped up
with bang... or two. It seems no accident that there is a religious
connotation to the title (Hell), even though it's defined, within the
puppet play, not as Satan's own gated community but rather as a
terrestrial &quot;forest named Hell.&quot; A medieval view of &quot;sinful&quot; human
nature is as endemic to this movie as the heroin being shot up. But
rather than explore its own self-contradictory underlying
assumptions, the film increasingly focuses on scenes of hot sex
between 'super-cute guyz.' Countercultural freedom? Hardly. Prince in
Hell is ultimately as anti-human as the traditional mainstream
society its benighted protagonists think they have escaped – yet
rather than that being the provocative underlying theme, the movie
merely wallows in its implicit belief that the wages of sin is
Firlefanz's fate, and Jockel's and Micha's and Sabine's. The one
possible exception is Stefan – although his offscreen namesake must
share some of the blame for the self-blindered script.

Considering the toxically reactionary core of the film, not to
mention its technical problem in being unable to decide on which
competing narrative focus it wants to use, I think a simple yet
resonant new ending – clearly focused on Stefan – could have been
very effective. As it is now, Stefan just disappears after Jockel's
death, then we cut to Firlefanz's suicide. Yet if we had ended
clearly focused on Stefan's perspective, the entire picture might
retroactively have been made to seem more coherent (of course, its
self-loathing worldview is nothing if not consistent).

Imagine simply holding an extended close-up of Stefan for a long
take, while offscreen – next to him – his ex-lover Jockel is dying
in the hospital bed. In the establishing shot, we could have seen
that Micha is also there. Then we would cut to and hold on Stefan's
close-up. We would see, and intuit, Stefan's dawning fuller
understanding of his world, and its destructive limitations. At the
same time, we would experience a richer connection with the – now
clearly defined as primary – protagonist. Structurally, we would
have moved from the blinkered perspective of the tourists in the
opening scene (mocked by Jockel and Stefan) to some kind of insight,
even as we would have overcome the central psychological, social, and
spiritual problem – the theme – of the film, its profound
disconnection, by connecting with Stefan. No voice-over explaining
away anything; then after Jockel dies, we could see Stefan simply
letting go of his hand. Silence. Cut to a brief scene of Stefan
packing his bags. Cut to a shot of Stefan taking a final look at the
caravan, with Micha, wasted, out of focus in the background. Cut to
Stefan, a small bag in hand, leaving to find – and create – a
better life for himself.

An ending along those lines would have allowed us to empathize with
Stefan, to bridge the many gaps which separate us – whether by time,
culture, or anything else. As the great gay humanist E.M. Forster
wrote in his masterpiece, Howards End, &quot;only connect&quot; – but first,
of course, must come real understanding.

But that's not at all the resolution of Prince in Hell. Its greatest
failure is that at the end we're left with nothing but... what comes
out of Firlefanz.
