Never Forgotten
Dedicated to My Wife

He grabbed his coat and the small duffel bag stowed under the seat. He
had packed light, knowing this was a brief trip. Descending the
stairs, he felt the rain drip off his nose but it was warm and
comfortable, just like the island weather in Hawaii always seemed to
be. Bustling through the small airport, he flagged a taxi at the curb.

&quot;Where are you staying?&quot; asked the friendly cabbie in his Hawaiian
drawl.
&quot;Actually I'm not staying long. Can you take me to Pu'u O Kila?&quot;
&quot;I guess&quot;, said the man, &quot;but that's not a cheap fare my friend!&quot; He
pulled out onto the main road that almost circled Kauai and headed
into the early morning mist.

Only six short months ago, David and Karen were planning a trip back
here to the islands. It was a once a year vacation they longingly
looked forward to. A chance to rejuvenate and invigorate their love.
Leukemia had been a bitter enemy though, one they could not fight. His
tears were now silent, dried out weeks ago.

The cab pulled away as he walked the short distance to the lookout.
Opening his duffel, he lifted the small silver vase into the warm
breeze. &quot;I love you Karen&quot;, he said. &quot;With all my heart I love you.&quot;
Tilting the vase away from the wind, the dust scattered out into the
valley below. One final tear spilled down his face as he watched the
sun rise against the cloudy sky.
