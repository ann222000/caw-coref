If they turn the logo a littlb bit dark, or &quot;see through&quot;. Then should
be ok. :)

What kind of HD display do you have that has this problem?  CRT?

Maybe they actually WANT to burn their logo onto your screen.  Maybe they
don't think of that as damage, but as part of marketing :-(

I do find those things annoying, especially if they are not the see-through
type.

And of course they remove them for commercials.  So they do know just how
much they distract people.

Why are they using any logos?

Because they are low-lifes that can't resist the temptation
to put an ad for their channel in front of you all day long.

Many of the channels have added animated adds on the left running
right thru the program.

Everyone thinks I'm kidding but it's only a matter of time before
they start closing up the box that actual content plays in.
They'll start with a bar (like the windows taskbar) running
across the bottom of the screen full of ads.  There will be
nothing you can do to get rid of it.  Put a physical cover
in front of it and they'll move it.  It will get steadily
bigger until you can hardly see the picture.

Mark my words.

The level of the bugs is so low that I seriously doubt it will cause

The _real_ reason I like the bugs is it makes it very easy to identify
the spots when editing them out. The bug says &quot;you want to keep this&quot;.
It would be much more difficult if the bugs weren't there.

The channel operators figure the channel ID bugs are a valuable way for
viewers to become aware of which channel they are watching when channel
surfing. The &quot;importance&quot; is greater if the viewer is using the TV's
cable ready tuner instead of the channel guide available with many cable
company rental set top boxes. Since a viewer might surf in at any time
between commercials, the ID bug stays up.

You're allowed to complain all you want, but it's unlikely to do any
good unless the viewers participating in the rating sample tune in to
the non-existent channels that don't keep an ID bug on the screen.

It's even easier than that, unfortunately.

All they have to do is start running content at a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Since
everyone has been educated that the black bars are normal and necessary to
preserve original aspect ratio (at least for movies), they'll just accept
that the black bars on their 4:3 screens and also their 16:9 widescreens are
normal for the content.

Only now they don't have to close up the box--the top and bottom black bars
just became useable for web-style banner ads (either static graphic ads or
obnoxiously animated ads) that can play through the entire content. Using
Zoom to block out the ads in the black bars as an easy solution would lose
content, just like a pan-and-scan movie would lose content if zoomed to
eliminate the black bars. That also further assumes they won't start putting
DVD player type user-operation prohibited modes on future TV's, where
something like the Zoom button would be disabled for that content.

Another difficulty will be when commercials all go 16:9,
especially commercials for the show you're editing!

I agree with you that cueing on the bug makes for quick ID of
end cuts without having to watch the content while &quot;scanning.&quot;
However, my visual cue for return from commercial is the
relentlessly displayed rating symbol, rather than its merely
being used prior to the beginning of the program.  I use the
same cue when fast-forwarding an HDVR.

I suppose the bug is some form of copyright protection, as the
broadcaster has paid for the content, as well as a reminder of
who brought us the content we've enjoyed enough to capture and
edit!

What I'm most happy to see of late is that some have already
begun to discriminate between HDTV and SDTV placement of bugs
and ratings so that they are no longer within the 4:3 frame.  My
pro rationale here is that my eyes don't seem to notice these at
all while viewing - hmmm, perhaps I sit too close to the screen?

The cold cathode fluorescent bulb is a set factor the film layers
modify for the displays projected useage. The only thing ruined is the
bulb from usage over a rated material time allotment.  Unless you've
adaptive lighting is doesn't matter, it remains a constant doing what

Some of the commercials are already 16:9 HD and they slow me down just
a little because only CBS keeps the eyeball during fade to black.The
other networks fade it out a few seconds before the fade but the
absence of the bug with different programming stands out pretty
quick.

For laughs I tried the VideoReDo 'ad-detective' but it's lots slower
than just skipping in 1 minute increments and watching the bug -- and
it makes more mistakes than I do.

Well, I suppose the idea behind VRD's ad-dick is that we not
watch the screen;-0)  However, I agree that it's way too long to
utilize requiring almost per vid set up, resolution of false
indicators, and it misses the non-fade in/out cuts.  Pluswhich,
I remove elements which are not ads, such as redundant intros
and opening/closing credits, which would need be found manually
at any rate.

I'm not much for using the mouse, I prefer keyboard controls.
If interested, I've set the up/down keys to: 30 seconds, 2x
shift ( 1min), 3x ctrl (1.5 min), 6x ctrl/shift (3 min).  And
the left/right to: 1 frame, shift = 1 i-frame, ctrl = 5 secs,
ctrl/shift = 10 secs.  Almost universally the time between
commercials is never less than 5 minutes.  Thus ctrl/shift
right, followed by ctrl right takes me 4.5 minutes forward.

BBC-A is VRD's acid test for ad-dick as they use none to very
few black frames in many fades.  Which sometimes causes me to
insert 2 seconds of black silence, when the cut is not in a
contiguous scene.

The one thing I've not found in VRD is a batch processor.  I
save each edit session to a project and go on to the next before
actually outputting cut versions.  It would be great, if I could
just load up all the projects for the output run.

Two of our local affils, for NBC and ABC, have their local bugs
displayed 100% day-in &amp; night-out no matter what.  The local
NBC affil's bug is outside the 4:3 area while the local ABC
affil's bug is inside that area.  Yes even during commercials etc.

What I'd like to know is that since the local station is
obviously re-encoding the network feed in order to plaster
extra pixels on top of them, I believe we are seeing inferior
quality.  MPEG2 is already 'lossy', decoding the network feed
and re-encoding it is adding more 'gremlins' etc. to the mix,
it just can't possibly 'improve' quality at all period.  So
yeah I'd say it's worth complaining about.  What you-all think?

&gt; BBC-A is VRD's acid test for ad-dick as they use none to very
&gt; few black frames in many fades.  Which sometimes causes me to
&gt; insert 2 seconds of black silence, when the cut is not in a
&gt; contiguous scene.
&gt;
&gt; The one thing I've not found in VRD is a batch processor.  I
&gt; save each edit session to a project and go on to the next before
&gt; actually outputting cut versions.  It would be great, if I could
&gt; just load up all the projects for the output run.

I have VRD set for &lt;ctrl&gt; arrow 1 minute, &lt;shift&gt; arrow 1 second and
&lt;shift&gt; &lt;ctrl&gt; at 10 seconds.

I get around the batch issue by running 2 PCs and find spots on one
while the other writes the new file.

I find the logos helpful when travelling.  Flip the channels around on
the hotel TV, you know where you're at.

Now, if they'd move the bug around the screen to different locations once in
awhile, they'd appease the burn-in worriers . . . . . .  and make the damned
thing even more noticeable.

Win-win.     ;-)

Search the VRD help file for &quot;Batch Builder&quot;, I've even called it from a
batch file before.

Many thanks!  Exactly what I wanted.  No excuse for not having
noticed this before.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The level of the bugs is so low that I seriously doubt it will cause
&gt;&gt;&gt; anybody any problems. If the bug was 100% white all the time, we'd have
&gt;&gt;&gt; something to complain about.

&gt;&gt;&gt; GG

&gt;&gt; Can we complain about the annoyance factor?  Could they now temporarily
&gt;&gt; display the logo for say 20 seconds after commercial breaks?

&gt;Two of our local affils, for NBC and ABC, have their local bugs
&gt;displayed 100% day-in &amp; night-out no matter what.  The local
&gt;NBC affil's bug is outside the 4:3 area while the local ABC
&gt;affil's bug is inside that area.  Yes even during commercials etc.

&gt;What I'd like to know is that since the local station is
&gt;obviously re-encoding the network feed in order to plaster
&gt;extra pixels on top of them, I believe we are seeing inferior
&gt;quality.  MPEG2 is already 'lossy', decoding the network feed
&gt;and re-encoding it is adding more 'gremlins' etc. to the mix,
&gt;it just can't possibly 'improve' quality at all period.  So
&gt;yeah I'd say it's worth complaining about.  What you-all think?
&gt;(thanks for letting me chime-in)
">

Local stations receive network feeds uncompressed.  All of the MPEG2
encoding is done at the local station.
