Ain't nothing too discreet / About the disease of conceit - Bob Dylan

Language, being the virus that it is, often makes me sick. These
days, not so much from the perpetual misdiagnosis of "conspiracy theory"
( conspiracy is a hypothesis, doc; deep politics is the theory ), as at
the gatekeeping virologists' nerve to call what they do "skepticism."

The Skeptics Society , which claims ownership of the term, defines it
as "the application of reason to any and all ideas.... When we say we
are 'skeptical,' we mean that we must see compelling evidence before we
believe."

Right there we can see the argumentative circularity, and the
richness and the weirdness of life that must forever lie beyond the pale
for such people. "Show me," they say. Yet evidence compelling to them
must necessarily conform to "reason" (in other words, to a trumped-up
rationality with control issues), and so all evidence that transgresses
reason (or more accurately, puts rationality in its place) is
invalidated. In this manner, the paranormal and much of what we call the
parapolitical can never be proven to such people. "Show me," they say,
and yet these same people are more likely than not to accept official
narratives of controversial history without having been shown anything .
Rather, it's us, the "conspiracy theorists," who are saying "show me,"
and meaning it. We're the ones withholding judgement. We're the true
skeptics, and I want us to stake a claim on the word.

The society adds that "modern skepticism is embodied in the
scientific method, that involves gathering data to formulate and test
naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena."

Here the problem narrows, and sharpens, to the reduction of
skepticism to scientific method. But much of our experience of the
world, even of the "natural" world, cannot be subjected to a scientific
method and still retain its meaning for us.

Just last week, scientist Richard Dawkins opened a conference with
the caution that the Universe is to weird to understand, and that there
is a "narrow range of reality that we judge to be normal." Scientific
method is moving uncomfortably beyond the "skeptic," who seems a
hide-bound Newtonian from the perspective of our quantum politics.

Have you ever browsed the Skeptic's Dictionary ? A word that comes to
mind to describe the intellects at play there is credulous . Virtually
all that is offered is assurance to those who don't want such things to
be true that they needn't worry, and need inquire no further.

For instance, the complete entry for " Xenoglossy " is the "alleged
speaking or writing in a language entirely unknown to the speaker. The
probability of this happening is about zero." Well , he said, brushing
off his hands, that takes care of that.

Under " Mind control ," we read that:

...a common complaint from the mind-controlled is that they can't get
therapists to take them seriously. That is, they say they can only find
therapists who want to treat them for their delusions, not help them
prove they're being controlled by their government. Thus, it is not
likely that the 'mind-controlled CIA zombies' will be accused of having
delusions planted in them by therapists, as alien abductees have, since
they claim they cannot get therapists to take their delusions seriously.

Either the author did not respect the subject enough to seriously
research it, or he did and hopes the reader won't, because it's an
absolute fabrication.

I'll let just one example stand for many. (And let's note this: these
kind of skeptics must paint with the broadest of brushes, because if
only one contrary fact is admitted, everything crumbles.) Dr Valerie
Wolf, testifying before the Presidential Commission on Radiation
Experiments in 1995, said that:

...in preparation for my testimony at these hearings, I called nearly
40 therapists across the country to find out what they knew about the
link between radiation and mind control and to get what other therapists
were seeing in clients who had been used in mind control experiments....
Generally, it appears that therapists across the country are finding
clients who have been subjected to mind control techniques. The
consistency of their stories about the purpose of the mind control and
torture techniques such as electric shock, use of hallucinogens, sensory
deprivation, spinning, hypnosis, dislocation of limbs and sexual abuse
is remarkable. There is almost nothing published on this aspect of mind
control used with children and these clients come from all over the
country, having had no contact with each other.

In its debunking of " alien abductions ," the dictionary never strays
from the ET hypothesis, arguing against the probability of travelling
interplanetary distances without raising the theoretical likelihood of
parallel worlds.

Regarding the late Harvard psychiatrist, Dr John Mack, who took
seriously the abduction phenomenon, the dictionary sneers:

...until the good doctor or one of his patients produces physical
evidence that abductions have occurred, it seems ore reasonable to
believe that he and his patients are deluded or frauds. Of course, the
good doctor can hide behind academic freedom and the doctor/patient
privacy privilege. He can make all the claims he wants and refuse to
back any of them up on the grounds that to do so would be to violate his
patients' rights. He can then publish his stories and dare anyone to
take away his academic freedom. He is in the position any con person
would envy: he can lie without fear of being caught.

Again, the broadest brush is employed - the "good doctor" is a con
man - because if they are wrong once , their world slips away.

And there is ample physical evidence for both UFOs and abductions.
Another solitary example to stand for many: The case of "Dr X," the
French health professional Jacques Vallee introduced to us in
Confrontations . When attending to his crying toddler early morning
November 2, 1968, he noticed a light outside the child's window. He
didn't pay it much attention until his son was asleep again, and then he
stepped out on the balcony and observed two large disks moving slowly
over neighbouring homes. The objects merged, and a white beam was
directed toward the ground below. "Finally the disk made a movement that
brought it to a vertical position, and the white beam caught the doctor
squarely on the balcony. He heard a bang and the object vanished,
leaving only a whitish form like cotton candy."

Afterwards he experienced abdominal pain, and a red, equalateral
triangle with sides of six inches in length appeared around his navel.
His doctor believed it to be a psychosomatic reaction to his "dream" of
an object which was somehow associated with a triangle. "But when the
same shape appeared on the abdomen of the child, and when the same
phenomena recurred in successive years, the psychosomatic explanation
had to be discounted." (A thermographic examination in 1984 found
"intense cutaneous erythema of triangular shape, centered over the
umbilicus; absence of visible superficial vessel.... resistant to
cooling.")

The encounter also accompanied spontaneous healing of a permanent
disability on the right side of his body he had incurred ten years
before from a mine explosion while in the French army. And this just
scratches the weirdness, as Dr X and his wife were subsequently "plagued
by poltergeist activity" and by visitations "so fantastic as to stretch
credulity, yet they appear to be verifiable by other family members."
But let's not invite the rolled eyes of the "skeptic" with such
episodes. But it's too late for that. Even the medical records of Dr X
and his son are inadmissable as evidence because they do not conform to
"reason," and so will not be seriously considered.

Cocksureity seems the hallmark contradiction of such skeptics. Stage
magician Penn Jillette is such a one. He says that people should "learn
to carry their intelligence the way James Dean carried his cigarette."
In other words, as an affectation .

Jillette could have said the way Peabody carried his bowtie, but it
wouldn't have been as cool.

Thanks for this entry, Jeff. Seems the people I know that rely on
much the same thinking are the most close-minded people I have ever
known. These people claim to be skeptics yet carry with them everywhere
such super-beliefs that they base all their beliefs on. If you're going
to be a skeptic you need to believe that beliefs are dangerous - which
they are - you need to *not* believe, and believe in unbelief - the only
truth is that there is no truth, or that everything is true in some
sense. These people just seem, to me, like little shits that have
adopted this mindset to uphold a sort of super-normal or life-sustaining
faith in knowing that there is nothing more to know than the beliefs
that make their lives - however crummy and unfulfilled - superior in
their own make-believed stability.

An amazing read that completely blows the type of belief system we're
dealing with in The Skeptics Dictionary, Penn Jilette, et cetera, seems
to me to be Robert Anton Wilson's Natural Law - Or Don't Put a Rubber On
Your Willy. In which he tears apart the belief systems of such people in
an astounding way, using general semantics and language in such a way
that it doesn't make you sick, it infact cures illness of the mind and
makes it healthy for true skepticism, which is a wild ride many of these
fair-is-foul mask-anti-mask up-side-down skeptics could never even dream
in their self-limiting, dreary, boring head-space.

The important thing to remember though is that the 'weird' (for want
of a better term) is a world of counter-rationality, where fakery and
the imaginal and the untrue blend seamlessly into the real and the
verifiable. This is why it is so hard to pin down. People pursuing truth
can end up following a lie without ever knowing how or when it made the
switch. The only thing to be is always skeptical of everything - even
the 'alternatives'.

Yes there are weird, covert bizarre things out there, but there are
also attention-seeking wackos, and what seems to be forgotten is that
the dividing line between them tends to be blurry at best. Often the one
attracts the other,Trickster fashion, so that we have a mix of the truly
odd, the hysterically imagined and the frankly fake all going on at once
and all blending into one another, becoming one another and redefining
themselves as we watch.

To deny that is to misunderstand on a massive scale what it is we are
looking at here.

To give an example. A large number of abductees have very obvious
personality problems, and manifest obvious attention-seeking behaviour.
Some clearly make up the stories of their encounters (viz 'Linda
Cortile' and the 'Brooklyn Bridge' nonsense) either for reasons of
attention-seeking or for commercial gain or both.

But at the same time there is a liquid core of genuine strangeness
washing around here, and it washes around even the most obvious fakers,
tingeing their stories with aspects that seem to defy any rational
dismissal. Evern a conscious faker who sets out only to trick can end up
accidentally being genuine. The fake and the real entwine around each
other, mirror each other, almost become each other, and we cannot prise
them apart.

This is what makes it so hard for our western mindset to deal with.
We try to find 'the reality', where ultimately there isn't any, or at
least there is no one fixed reality, but rather a changing landscape
which shifts as much in response to the perceiver as the perceived. The
awful truth is that if we look for something - space ships, suicide
bombers, certitude, paedophiles we will find them; we may even cause
them to be for all we know. This isn't hard-edge journalism, this is
creating the reality you are searching for. So it might make sense to
look for something better!

And if you really want to do your head in look at the alternative
climate sites.

http://www.climateaudit.org/

http://www.john-daly.com/

There seems - according to all evidence I have seen - to be currently
no significant or unusual warming taking place. The ice sheets are only
melting and growing as they always do, and not thinning in any unusual
way. The sea levels are NOT rising. There are - contrary to the popular
presentation - numerous scientists who are in fact very skeptical of the
entire concept, and the Mann 'hockey stick' chart showing massive
warming in the 20th C has been criticised as being deceptive due to his
bizarre usage of tree-ring data and his inexplicable rejection of the
medieval warm period. Attempts to verify his foundation data have failed
and everything in fact is still very very unknown.

The image of certitude is simply mythic in this case as in the case
of the 'suicide bombers'. It's all a bit of smoke and mirrors. But the
scary thing is - if we all keep believing it for long enough then maybe
it will be true!

Who knows?

It is much better/safer/saner to have ideas than beliefs. So many
people walking around with a barking mass of misconceptions they call a
world-view, and forgetting to remind themselves "I could be wrong".

Hitler was a man who forgot to remind himself "I could be wrong".
George Bush is a man who has forgotten to remind himself "I could be
wrong".

Man, I've been following this same train of thinking really hard
lately. Last night I actually found the word you're looking for: it's
methodological or philosophical skepticism . It's where " one critically
examines whether the knowledge and perceptions one has are true, and
whether or not one can ever be said to have true knowledge. " As opposed
to scientific skepticism (which is what the skeptic's dictionary
follows) where " one does not accept the veracity of claims until solid
evidence is produced in accordance with the scientific method ."

This distinction has always plagued me because I am very much
skeptical, so much so that I'm skeptical of the skeptics - or rather the
scientific skeptics. Philosophical skepticism seems to be more "pure" to
my way of thinking, but also leads you into the tail-spin of
relentlessly questioning everything, even your own questioning.

Where does it end? That's what I wonder. I've been going so far with
it lately that I'm questioning the truth of language itself to ever
adequately describe experience, nevermind experience itself. It's
forcing me to dissolve a lot of assumptions I've always held but refused
to look at. I don't know where it's going, but the process is releasing
a ton of creative energy and sharpening my thinking processes tenfold.

Right, Tim. I've been pulling some old philosophical texts off my
shelves, because part of what we're doing is a philosphical project,
specifically epistemology and hermeneutics: how can we know, and how can
we understand?

Scientific skepticism is a dead end. Philosophical skepticism only
appears to be a dead end. It has lots of interesting trapdoors and
secret entranceways.

Philosophical skepticism was at its peak during the period c.
1500-1700 (also known as the rise of the modern world.)

Science as we know it arose in large part because people couldn't
handle that level of doubt. They wanted *something* they could rely on
completely, and if it was only experimentally verifiable theories about
the physical would that could be taken as reliable to that degree, that
was all they would believe in.

Religion, occultism, and any other belief system that lay outside the
framework of experimental verification was either discarded,
marginalized, or forced into a pseudo-scientific straitjacket. (Which is
the source of creationism and the other last-ditch attempts by
traditional religion to hold on to believers by claiming scientific
legitimacy.)

Meanwhile, relativity and quantum physics came along and plunged us
back into the state of radical doubt that we'd been trying to escape
from since the late 1700's. But since this is happening in the very
heart of science, which most non-scientists still take as the motherlode
of experimental validation, it hasn't altogether been noticed.

My own take on things largely goes back to the sort of distinction
between physics and engineering that John W. Campbell used to write
about when he was editor of Astounding Science Fiction: Physicists want
to explain everything. Engineers just want to know what works.

It's amazing how much crap you can cut through by going on the basis
of "what works."

But even that isn't the final word. Occultism, for example, has a
trickster nature. It will work for you up to a point -- but the moment
you come to rely on it or think you can trust it completely, it will
pull the chair out from under you and leave you sprawled on the floor.
(There's an article somewhere by Phil Dick on what happened when he
began to us the I Ching for all his daily decision-making. Huge mistake,
that.)

What it comes to is that we as a species are having to get used to
living with radical uncertainty, the more so as we expand beyond nature
and into a world of our own making, and we really aren't very happy
about it. We just don't have much choice.

Wow, you reading my mind?

For the past few days I've been living on "paranormal" sites as a
debunker. A majority of the people, after seeing the apparitions
revealed to be something very ordinary, continue to insist otherwise.

Ellie H put it well: "creating the reality you are searching for"

There's just too much information, and too many questions for the
ordinary mind to grasp, so most people find a niche to crawl into and
stay there come hell or high water.

So doesn't it make sense that anyone who rises above this tendency,
into a realm of true 'reasonable thinking', immediately becomes an
outsider?

Here we have your Skeptics Society, twisting reality to their own
design.. and remaining part of the larger irrational crowd.

thanks. this and related posts have sort of defined for me some of
the new paradigms we've been dealing with, at least since the shock of
2000's stolen election .. and as this blog points out, might have been
going on for much longer (um, always?).

before now, the operative distinction in making sense of weirdness
seems to have been between the so-called scientific method and
uncritical crackpot acceptance. both extremes may serve someone's
interests, but each is ultimately personally unsatisfying.

i'm relatively non-erudite re: specific types of skepticism, but
there is always common sense and open-mindedness -- which might,
together, amount to intuitive skepticism. some things can be delinated,
some can't. i've stopped worrying about that distinction, much. I just
try to rely on a mixture of rationality and intuition -- and bring the
best I can muster, in terms of human compassion.

and try to remember that there are stranger realities than any i am
capable of imagining. which is one reason i have been very appreciative
of this and related sites. when the going gets weird ...

the common thread in some of this is a recognition of relative
ignorance -- which, on my own part, grows every day. i used to know more
than i do now. and thank god for that.

so i suppose one antidote to the disease of conceit is in taking on
as little conceptual encumbrance as possible.

at the same time, that doesn't mean it's not a good idea to piece
together clues as best as possible. the literal meaning of conspiracy
has to do with 'breathing together'; I'd like to think that applies to
inter-related ideas being allowed breathing space to bounce around. the
best meaning of conspiratorial thinking is in allowing connections to
appear, without dismissing such out of hand or hoping for particular
results.

of course, there are those whose interests are not served by the
casting of light and the connection of dots (doh); and yes, casting
light on and calling attention to their machinations is part of the
process of exercising common sense.

sometimes, i would personally prefer to call this a mission of
righteous intution , as much as rigorous intuition. but that's where i
have to be careful not to subvert my own intentions by becoming too
immersed in the desire to see just desserts dished. but in the end, i
have to admit, that's one of the real motivations for getting to the
botttom of things: to see justice served. such is one of own biases in
expanding understanding of parapolitics and non-consensus realities.

Scientific skepticism is not dead. And scientic method is not dead.
What is dying is the ability of this current generation to reliably and
accurately describe what they are experiencing or to HONESTLY describe
what they are experiencing. We would rather scapegoat and project rather
than confront truths.

The whole world is washed over in lies and disinformation right now.
Thank your intel agencies and money grubbing religionists for most of
that. Just like in ancient Rome, the increasing lunacy is simply a
byproduct of the lies of protectionists trying to keep the many in a
state of poverty and confusion.

One man's UFO is just another man's black budget spy plane.

One man's ghost is just another man's waking dream.

One man's strange perception of coincidental strangeness in the world
is just another man's dawning realization of the relationship of the
microcosm to the macrocosm.

cosmic trigger vol 1. robert anton wilson.

chapter 1 (in part)

I DO NOT BELIEVE ANYTHING

This remark was made, in these very words, by John Gribbin, physics
editor of New Scientist magazine, in a BBC-TV debate with Malcolm
Muggeridge, and it provoked incredulity o the part of most viewers. It
seems to be a hangover of the medieval Catholic era that causes most
people, even the educated, to think that everybody must "believe"
something or other, that if one is not a theist, one must be a dogmatic
atheist, and if one does not think Capitalism is perfect, one must
believe fervently in Socialism, and if one does not have blind faith in
X, one must alternatively have blind faith in not-X or the reverse of X.

My own opinion is that belief is the death of intelligence. As soon
as one believes a doctrine of any sort, or assumes certitude, one stops
thinking about that aspect of existence. The more certitude one assumes,
the less there is left to think about, and a person sure of everything
would never have any need to think about anything and might be
considered clinically dead under current medical standards, where
absence of brain activity is taken to mean that life has ended.

My attitude is identical to that of Dr. Gribbin and the majority of
physicists today, and is known in physics as "the Copenhagen
Interpretation," because it was formulated in Copenhagen by Dr. Niels
Bohr and his co-workers c. 1926-28. The Copenhagen Interpretation is
sometimes called "model agnosticism" and holds that any grid we use to
organize our experience of the world is a model of the world and should
not be confused with the world itself. Alfred Korzybski, the
semanticist, tried to popularize this outside physics with the slogan,
"The map is not the territory." Alan Watts, a talented exegete of
Oriental philosophy, restated it more vividly as "The menu is not the
meal."

I agree that scientific skepticism isn't dead. In fact it's the best
and highest form of critical thinking available to us.

But what usually passes for 'scientific skepticism' is no such thing.
It's anti-scientific debunking; a crusade against the 'unacceptable',
every bit as hysterical and counter-rational as the Inquisition. It's a
part of the creeping Big Brother world, where difference of any kind,
particularly free thought, is being marginalised.

Heh, the ones with "attention seeking behavior" are the ones getting
the attention. As such, they cannot be said to be representative of the
phenonemon only the ones most likely to be noticed. Many abductees do
not seek such attention. In fact, I'd say most. After all, it takes a
certain kind of personality to deal with the repercussions of being
public with stories like these. Sometimes you even get run over by a car
(RIP, John Mack)

The bizarre factor grows as you zoom out of the picture...the
abductees describe experiments that sound like mind control experiments
which sound like Satanic abuse rituals....round and round. Screen
memories? Well, maybe, but then there are some cases with physical
traces and witnesses. And in each, there are "attention getters" who
seem to be giving out disinformation or are just disturbed.

You are right about Cortile, though. I was so interested in that
case...but when I read the book I had to believe I was missing
something. ALL of the "evidence" of the other witnesses came from
"anonymous sources" or these guys working with...I mean kidnapping
Cortile. It was elaborate, and the inclusion of others in the plot seems
to rule out pure delusion on Cortile's part, but why did Hopkins put so
much stock in all this anonymous evidence? Really, don't make the
skeptibunkers jobs so easy for them.

The climate change debate is confusing only until you find out that
Fred Singer and his front organizations are funded by the big oil
companies to spend their time debunking global warming.

For those of us old enough, direct observation will help. Three
decades ago, cities didn't have "cooling stations," "sun glare alerts"
or "pollution indexes." Trees didn't grow in the Antarctic. On
mountaintops, glaciers and snowcaps are now receding. Buildings in
Alaska and Siberia are tilting as the tundra melts. Most scientists say
we are in the middle of a mass species extinction.

It puzzles me that the fact that climate change has happened
periodically throughout Earth's history is being cited in an effort to
debunk the fact that it's happening right now! Whether or not human
beings caused it, we will still have to cope with it. The most primitive
and least effective form of coping with adversity is called "denial"! No
matter what scenario you paint for Earth's future, it will go easier on
us if we have some petroleum reserves left.

I don't think the 'climate change' debate is as easy to polarise as
that. I have no axe to grind, and I am not in anyone's pay, but I have
looked at all the data, and the case for man-made climate change just
isn't there in anything like the certain way we are led to believe.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a lifelong Green. I was a member of CND all
my life. I'm a leftie ex-hippie, and until recently I was actively
campaigning for awareness of global warming. I totally believe in the
cause of saving the environment, and I'm no fan of fossil fuels and the
damage they undoubtedly do.

But in eveything I want to know the truth, and I don't like being led
by the nose, and I don't like group-thinking, even if I am in the group.
I don't believe that telling a lie to achieve something true is okay. In
my experience, even well-intentioned public lies are just in the end
about distancing us all from our own realities and about some kind of
indoctrination. If we need to guard our environment (and I think we do)
then let's do it for real reasons and not whipped up mass hysteria that
could be based on a great big lie.

I don't know for sure if the 'global warming' idea is a big lie yet,
but I suspect it might be, and I don't want to see debate on it crushed
by exactly the kind of consensus group-think we are all supposed to be
opposing. We have to be prepared to challenge the things we believe in
as much as those we don't - or we are all just kidding ourselves!!!

So, don't shoot this down with cries of 'debunking' and other
emotional language until you have looked more coolly and closely at the
whole story.

Let me tell you, I have come to think 'global warming' could be a
kind of trick being pulled on us.

My reasons? Just for starters -

1.The science is dodgy since CO2 is such a minor greenhouse gas that
even if it were increased it oughtn't to make much difference. And
deeper than that, there is little sign of any serious warming, and most
of that 'evidence' tends to be anecdotal - like the stories of trees
growing in places they didn't before.

2. The famous Mann graph, showing massive warming this century, has
been shown - repeatedly - to have been constructed with highly dodgy
data. Mann himself is beginning to repudiate it, yet it was the central
pillar of the whole warming argument!

3. The warming that has occurred isn't consistent with the pattern of
CO2 generated warming. It's too small, in the wrong place and is far
more readily explained as normal climate-fluctuation, produced by the
end of the mini ice age. If you look at the original station reports
from round the world, there is little or no evidence of general warming.

4. The effect of Urban Heat Islands is never discussed (warming
generated by big cities which can alter the global averages without
indicating any actual base warming of the climate).

5. Sea levels are profoundly not rising, and the 'evidence' that they
are is often misinterpreted or faked. For example, the effects of
erosion and the post-glacial subsidance are often presented as 'sea
level rising' when they are clearly not so.

There's more - much more. But even this is enough to make us look
again and start to wonder isn't it?

I want to know how reliable is this 'warming' data? And I want to
know because I have found that the history of 'global warming' all too
often dissolves on close inspection - like the Warren Commission - into
pseudoscience and semi-science that seems to be being sold to alarm and
delude people.

Pictures of ice sheets collapsing into the sea are broadcast, but
what they don't mention is that these particular ice sheets grow and
collapse on a cycle every twenty years or so.

Stories of thinning ice in the Antarctic are told, but closer
inspection reveals the ice is thinning in some places and thickening
elsewhere, and that this is observed to be a very normal phenomenon.

In my experience what looks cut and dried and conclusive on first
analysis becomes dubious, ambiguous or even false on closer analysis.
And we all know what that can signify.

I think maybe -just maybe - in this one, the trick might be on us.
The forces of 'reaction' could be accidentally telling the truth for
once.

For one thing, I can't help wondering - why is Blair backing this
single element of the 'environment' so much? Why is 'climate change'
given so much air time when most - much more urgent - environmental
problems are just airbrushed out of the corporate media worldview? This
alone should make us wary.

Is it maybe a bid to help nudge nuclear power back on the agenda?
They have started talking about it already haven't they.

What I want to show you is that the issues of 'climate change' are a
lot more murky than the media make us think. Yes, the fossil fuel lobby
is behind the debunking - but that doesn't necessarily mean they are
wrong, and so far as I can make out, this time, they could easily be
right!

I know you are all open-minded people here. Don't take my word for
it. Check out the sites I posted, read everything ; get to the basic
data and tell me if your eyes aren't opened like mine were. If they
aren't then tell me why and I will rethink. I'm only interested in
finding the truth, and if I'm wrong I'll be happy to admit it.

Honestly, when it comes to the Trickster sometimes black really is
white, and light really is dark, which is why it is so treacherous
trying to find the real way.

peace and love

Ellie

That was excellent reasoning and writing Ellie. And I am not saying
that from any particular position, because I have not adopted one on the
subject. This is what mankind so desparately needs - real objectivity -
real honesty. For what it is worth, thank-you very much.

For all their pathologies of rational thought, their hipocrisy and
self-congratulation, the majority of the Movement Skeptics are brought
together by one motivation: Ridicule. They live to ridicule and
humiliate other people, and have devised a system whereby they can
escape accountability for their rudeness. When one insults someone in
the name of Science, the offense is immediately forgiven, just as many a
Christian assumes that no matter how heinous the crime they may plan,
Jesus Christ will deliver them from punishment.

One need not do very much thinking to be a Skeptic In Good Standing,
either, since hundreds of pre-composed arguments are available for the
choosing; cut-and-paste works fine against a patsy who doesn't read skep
lit. The only thing their method lacks is the Fundamentalists' habit of
citing a chapter and verse number after the quote is delivered. But they
have copied the smug self-satisfaction reflex to the neuron.

Refute them in even the smallest detail, and they will hound you to
the ends of the Earth, accuse you of holocaust denial, Scientology,
child molestation, and -- *gasp!* -- irrationality.

Almost all movement Skeptics claim to want to enlighten the fools who
are beneath their dignity, but I haven't seen it happen yet, and I was a
movement Skeptic way back in the mid-80s. Public humiliation and scorn
are not very effective teaching tools, and no peer review is necessary
to validate this observation. This "angry-young-geek" act is one of the
main reasons I left the movement. It is distressing to watch a group of
otherwise intelligent adults behave like swaggering fifth graders
circling around a lost second grader they have cut out of the herd.

Skepticism itself is one of the most powerful "tools" a person can
use to improve his/her understanding of the world. The movement called
"Skepticism" works at cross-purposes to it. The defenders of the Citadel
of Reason have degenerated into a pack of drunken bikers, and the world
is a meaner and darker place for it.

As I recall the primary source for the Dr X story was a 2-part
article in Flying Saucer Review by the late French researcher Aime

I have come to believe that we live in a hyper-dimensional universe,
and the "supernatural" and the "natural" have always coexisted.

We define our perception of "reality" because we live in a
three-dimensional world (plus time).

What happens, however, if there are other physical entities
(densities?) that exist in other dimensions, and those dimensions
intersect with our world?

What if we cannot see them because they are invisible in our world.
What if they also have the capability of making themselves visible by
assuming human or non-human form?

If this were possible, then ghosts, demons, aliens, sprites, etc.,
would simply be different entities from different densities?

What if "consciousness" manifests itself in many dimensions and
guides human history at some level?

Or what if there were good or evil Archetypes who were directing
human activity?

There was no other way for me to make any sense out of all this
weirdness except to consider the possibility of other forms of existence
that interacted with us from other dimensions.

Again, this is only my perception. At present I have no idea where
this is all leading. I just try to watch, listen observe and make the
mose sense out of "non-sense."

I really like this blog because it is the only one that I know of
that tries to address these issues in a philosophical context.

Yes, I think philosophical skepticism if a good name for it; but
then, again so is rigorous "intuition" because that's all I have to go
by.

The Trickster is the new "go-between" and, in a way, replaces the
god-man (Jesus) as the person who interacts between the physical and
physic (supernatural) worlds.

Since we are trying to make sense out of non-sense, we create a
paradox. Perhaps it takes trickery to "reconcile" good and evil.
