Subject: THE ILLUMINATI CREATES RACIAL TENSION
Title: The New World Order Files
Author: David Allen Rivera

In the book _A Racial Program for the Twentieth Century_, published in
1913 by Israel Cohen of the Fabian Society (a follow-up to Zangwill's

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
_Melting Pot_), he wrote: &quot;We must realize that our Party's most
">

powerful weapon is racial tension. By propounding into the consciousness
of the dark races, that for centuries have been oppressed by the Whites,
we can mold them to the program of the Communist Party...In America, we
will aim for subtle victory. While enflaming the Negro minority against
the Whites, we will instill in the Whites, a guilt complex for the
exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise to
prominence in every walk of life, in the professions, and in the world
of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the Negroes will be
able to intermarry with the Whites, and begin a process which will
deliver America to our cause.&quot; On June 17, 1957, this passage was read
into the _Congressional Record_ by Rep. Thomas G. Abernathy.

In 1922, the Russian Comintern provided $300,000 for the spreading of
communist propaganda among Negroes. In 1925, the Communist Party,
U.S.A., told its members: &quot;The aim of our Party in our work among the
Negro masses is to create a powerful proletarian movement which will
fight and lead the struggle of the Negro race against the exploitation
and oppression in every form and which will be a militant part of the
revolutionary movement of the whole American working class...and connect
them with the struggles of national minorities and colonial peoples of
all the world and thereby the cause of world revolution and the
dictatorship of the proletariat.&quot;

In 1925, a dozen Blacks were recruited for propaganda training in
Russia. That same year, the American Negro Labor Congress was
established. In 1930, they changed their name to the League of Struggle
for Negro Rights. They merged with the United Negro Congress when it was
founded in 1936, in Washington, D.C. By 1940, communists made up
two-thirds of its membership. In 1947, they united with the Civil Rights
Congress, a communist front group.

In a 1928 pamphlet by John Pepper (alias for Joseph Pogany) called
_American Negro Problems_, a move was being made by Stalin to ferment
revolution and stir the Blacks into creating a separate Republic for the
Negro. Another pamphlet put out by the New York Communist Party in 1935,
called _The Negroes in a Soviet America_, urged the Blacks to rise up
and form a Soviet State in the South by applying for admission to the
Comintern. It contained a firm pledge that a revolt would be supported
by all American communists and liberals. On page 48, it said that the
Soviet Government would give the Blacks more benefits than they would
give to the Whites, and &quot;any act of discrimination or prejudice against
the Negro would become a crime under the revolutionary law.&quot;

In _The Communist Party: A Manual On Organization_ by J. Peters, he
writes: &quot;The other important ally of the American proletariat is their
mass of 13,000,000 Negro people in their struggle against national
oppression. The Communist Party, as the revolutionary party of the
proletariat, is the only party which is courageously and resolutely
carrying on a struggle against the double exploitation and national
oppression of the Negro people, becoming intense with the developing
crisis, can win over the great masses of the Negro people as allies of
the Proletariat against the American bourgeosie.&quot;

In James Cannon's _America's Road to Socialism_, he says that the
Negroes &quot;will play a great and decisive role in the revolution...And why
shouldn't they be? They have nothing to lose but their property and
discrimination, and a whole world of prosperity, freedom, and equality
to gain. You can bet your boots the Negro will join the Revolution to
fight for that - once it becomes clear to them that it cannot be gained
except by revolution.&quot;

The former FBI Director, J. Edgar Hoover, said of the Communists goals:
&quot;Communists seek to advance the cause of communism by injecting
themselves into racial situations and in exploiting them, (1) to
intensify the frictions between Negroes and Whites to 'prove' that
discrimination against the minorities is an inherent defect of the
capitalistic system, (2) to foster domestic disunity by dividing Negroes
and Whites into antagonistic, warring factions, (3) to undermine and
destroy established authority, (4) to incite racial strife and riotous
activity, and (6) to portray the Communist movement as the 'champion' of
social protest and the only force capable of ameliorating the conditions
of the Negro and the oppressed.&quot;

In light of all this, you can see why the Supreme Court, under elitist
Earl Warren, issued the desegregation law in 1954, and why Eisenhower
and Kennedy enforced it by using Federal troops. It was to create more
tension between Blacks and Whites. Incidentally, it was the Warren Court
who prohibited prayer and the singing of Christmas carols in the
schools. This was intended to weaken Christianity.

Jacob Schiff, the Rothschild's man in America, decided that the best
way to create racial tension, was to establish leadership among the
Blacks. In 1909, he laid out plans for the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). It was the merging of the
communist-controlled Niagara Movement, a group of Blacks led by W. E. B.
DuBois; and a group of White social activists. In the beginning, the top
leaders of the NAACP were a group of Jews appointed by Schiff. Their
goal was to fight segregation and discrimination. They are the largest
Black organization in the country, with well over 1500 chapters, and
about a half-million members.

Communist Party members were told to join the NAACP, in order to
infiltrate them. As the Communist Party platform stated: &quot;The Negro race
must understand that capitalism means racial oppression, and communism
means social and racial equality.&quot; Manning Johnson, who held the highest
position a Black could have in the Communist Party, said in his 1958
book _Color, Communism and Common Sense_, that he quit, because he felt
Russia was attempting to involve them in a bloody revolution where as
many as five million Blacks would die. Another Negro Communist, Leonard
Patterson, testified on November 18, 1950: &quot;I left the Communist Party
because I became convinced...that the Communist Party was only
interested in promoting among the Negro people a national liberational
movement that would aid the Communist Party in its efforts to create a
proletarian revolution in the United States that would overthrow the
government by force and violence through bloody full-time revolution,
and substitute it with a Soviet form of government with a dictatorship
of the proletariat.&quot;

The May, 1968 issue of _Political Affairs_, the voice of the Communist
Party, wrote after the death of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.: &quot;The
Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., the voice, inspiration and symbol of
the Negro people's struggle for freedom and equality, is dead...The man
who, more than anyone else, personified the heroic determination of the
Black people to win their liberation now. One of humanity's great
leaders has been silenced forever...We must see that his memory not be
desecrated. We must not fail to do all in our power to realize the dream
for which he died.&quot;

King, the most powerful Black leader in the country, was a pawn of the
Illuminati. He supported North Vietnam during the War, and was
photographed in 1957 at the Highlander Folk School, a communist training
school in Tennessee, with Abner Berry, who held a post on the Central
Committee of the Communist Party. The Joint Legislative Committee on
Un-American Activities, reported that his Southern Christian Leadership
Conference was &quot;substantially under the control of the Communist Party
through the influence of the Southern Conference Educational Fund and
the communists who manage it.&quot; King had connections with over 60
communist front organizations. Nine of his closest aides were high
ranking communist activists and one of those later became an aide to
Rev. Jesse Jackson. Stanley Levison, who had been a King advisor since
1956, had been involved with the Communist Party up to 1955, and brought
other known communists onto King's staff.

Rev. Uriah J. Fields, King's secretary during the early years, wrote
about him: &quot;King helps to advance Communism. He is surrounded with
Communists. This is the major reason I severed my relationship with him
during the fifties. He is soft on Communism.&quot; Karl Prussion, an FBI
agent who infiltrated the Communist Party, and for five years attended
meetings in California, testified in 1963: &quot;I further swear and attest
that at each and everyone of the aforementioned meetings, one Reverend
Martin Luther King was always set forth as the individual to whom
Communists should look and rally around in the Communist struggle on
many racial issues.&quot; Julia Brown, a former Communist, said: &quot;We were
told to promote Martin Luther King to unite Negroes and also Whites
behind him...He was taking directions from Communists. I know for a fact
the Communists would never have promoted him, financed/ /him, and
supported him if they couldn't trust him. I am certain as I can be that
he knew what he was doing.&quot;

Although a 1977 court order sealed the FBI's extensive surveillance
records on King in the National Archives for 50 years, a 1981 book by
David Garrow, called _The FBI and Martin Luther King, Jr._ told of
King's liaisons with prostitutes and the misappropriation of funds. The
FBI investigation had led J. Edgar Hoover to say that &quot;King is a tom cat
with obsessive degenerate sexual urges,&quot; and President Lyndon Johnson to
call him a &quot;hypocrite preacher.&quot;

The oldest Jewish service organization, known as the B'nai B'rith
(which means 'Son of the Covenant'), was a secret Masonic order founded
by twelve wealthy American Jews in New York in 1843. In 1913, Schiff,
along with Chicago author and attorney Sigmund Livingston, reorganized
the group, and established the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai
B'rith (ADL) to fight anti-semetism and religious prejudice. They have
been used as an instrument to convince people that an attack on the
Rothschilds and the Illuminati, is a direct attack on the Jewish people.
They are the most powerful Jewish organization in the world, with
chapters in 44/ /countries. In the United States, they have over 2,000
agencies, about 25 regional offices, and a membership of a half-million.
Its leaders had controlled the NAACP, the Urban League, and other Black
organizations, and often worked closely with the ACLU. Their influence
on advertising with some major department stores, hotel chains, and
major corporations, has been able to slant the media toward Blacks.
Nearly half of their annual budget comes through donations from non-Jews.

The American League to Limit Armaments was established on December 18,
1914,/ /a spin-off of the Emergency Peace Federation, led by communist
Louis Lochner. The League was organized by Jane Addams, John Haynes
Holmes, George Foster Peabody, Stephen Wise, L. Hollingsworth Wood, and
Morris Hillquit, all communists and socialists. In 1915, they changed
their name to the American Union Against Militarism, establishing a
Civil Liberties Bureau to oppose draft laws, The director of the Bureau,
socialist Roger Baldwin, reorganized it into the National Civil
Liberties Bureau, and in 1920, with the help of Jane Addams, Clarence
Darrow, Norman Thomas, Felix Frankfurter, and Arthur Garfield Hays,
founded the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Their goal was to
fight for &quot;the rights of man (as) set forth in the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution.&quot;

The original National Committee of the ACLU included, Elizabeth Gurley
Flynn and William Z. Foster, who both later became Chairmen of the
Communist Party; communist Scott Nearing; and Norman Thomas, Socialist
Party Chairman. Since the 1920's, 80% of its National Committee members
had Communist connections. In 1935, Baldwin said: &quot;I am for socialism,
disarmament, and ultimately for abolishing the State itself as an
instrument of violence and compulsion. I seek the social ownership of
property, the abolition of the propertied class and social control of
those who produce wealth. Communism is the goal.&quot;

In 1920, a Joint Committee of the New York State Legislature reported
that the ACLU &quot;in the last analysis is a supporter of all subversive
movements; and its propaganda is detrimental to the interests of the
State. It attempts not only to protect crime, but to encourage attacks
upon our institutions in every form.&quot; A September, 1923 report by the
United Mine Workers of America, said that the group &quot;is working in
harmony and unity with the Communist Superstructure in America...
conducting a nationwide campaign for the liberation of Bolshevik agents
and disloyal agitators who have been convicted under the wartime laws or
the syndicalist laws of different States for unpatriotic or
revolutionary activities.&quot; A January, 1931 report by the Special House
Committee to Investigate Communist Activities in the United States,
said: &quot;The American Civil Liberties Union is closely affiliated with the
Communist movement in the United States...it is quite apparent that the
main function of the ACLU is to attempt to protect Communists in their
advocacy of force and violence to overthrow the government...&quot; The
California Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities reported in
1943:/ /&quot;The American Civil Liberties Union may be definitely classed as
a Communist front...&quot; Dr. J. B. Matthews, Chief Investigator for the
House Special Committee on Un-American Activities, said in January,
1955: &quot;In 37 years of history of the Communist movement in the United
States, the Communist Party has never been able to do as much for itself
as the American Civil Liberties Union has done for it.&quot;

The ACLU is made up of about 200,000 members, with an army of 3,000
unpaid volunteer attorneys, and chapters in 47 states. They are a finger
organization of the Illuminati, and are most noted for their cases
involving the separation of church and state. They have defended the
rights of Jehovah Witnesses to refrain from saluting the flag, and to
protect the rights of the Nazis and KKK to organize and speak freely.
They have become the most powerful weapon against the Church, and
Christian tradition, in this country.

to allow any kind of human cloning to come out of
that chamber.&quot;
