Yes, anything besides that would be a sham.  Because, if the Attorney
General of the United States of America will not submit himself to
testimony under oath, why should ANYONE else?

"Yes....I'll take the 'Gonzales' on that question sir...."  .....lol

Executive power has been extended to give the president power over the birds

Did you look up Lincoln and Congressman Vallandigham yet?

His speech in favor of desertion and draft-evasion got him 17 years
from a military tribunal.  His habeas corpus writ was denied - by
the US Supreme Court.  Lincoln commuted his sentence by handing him
over to Confederacy, effectively exiling him.  He snuck back into
the Union from Canada - and when the war ended, he was not pursued
or harrassed for his conviction.

The Commander-in-Chief has extraordinary power during war.

You mean the leftist media that helped get Bush "elected" in 2000?  We
don't know whether the dismissals were illegal.  That's the point.  If they
were effected to stop investigations of criminality, then it's called
obstruction of justice.

The President's powers do not automatically expand "during war."  Habeas

broken down.

If they are subpoenaed, they have to appear or be held in

firing them is legal or not?
If the prosecutors were fired due to race, ethnicity, gender,

This is factually incorrect.  Some individual members of Congress have
been running from their vote when it became clear they'd been duped;
others have been running from their vote when it became clear what a
disaster we have on our hands.

The institution has only started repudiating the vote since the

No one claims this.  The authorization gives W whatever tactical means
he needs to mobilize the armed forces.  W claims that the authorization
gives him license to violate the law by say, conducting illegal
wiretaps.  There is a dispute about this.

oral sex) wasn't sex at all, that term being restricted to sexual

I can't find anything that shows that congress debated on
declaring war, let alone declared war.
Maybe you have access to information I've yet to find.  If you
could supply me with a link to a credible site that shows congress
declaring war (since Bush was elected) I would appreciate it.
Your attempt to confuse the issue with one of Clinton's lies
isn't helping at all.

They may investigate to their hearts' content to find out the

That's the purview of the executive.

Indeed no one is claiming that's the case.  But if the USAs were fired to

There are plenty of reasons to ask questions, even IF nothing illegal is

Bush is our President - he SHOULD be held accountable and that's whether

You are trying to say "Congress does not need to know the reasons", but
you are wrong.  If they ask, they need to be told.  If refused, they
have subpoena power and can demand answers.

It's never supposed to come to that, since the President is supposed to
(sworn to) be cooperative with Congressional oversight.

Now there is the complication that people have outright *lied* about it,

Yes except that people from the justice department lied under oath to

dismissed it as being inaccurate testimony due to maybe failing memories.
Under the new congress, it is being investigated and one interesting point
came out, kyle sampson circulated the idea of trying to bypass congress
completely, circumventing the confirmation process.  Maybe if you were in
congress, you would not care but there are some who believe congress is

I do have reason to worry, then.  We have the benefit of hindsight with
Clinton:  there was nothing to the manufactured "scandals" about him.  In
this case we have a lot of smoke, including a Republican Senator calling a
USA to inquire about an investigation of his political opponents.  That USA
was fired after he found no grounds for an indictment.  Is there fire?  I
don't know.  Why don't you want to find out?

I believe this to be incorrect.  Congress sets the pay scale for the
position -- it's a line item in the budget for the department in which the
person works.  Congress just doesn't allocate $X to the DOJ, which then
spends the money the way it wants.  If Congress wanted, it could set the
salary of USAs individually -- more for the Southern District of New York,
less for the District of North Dakota.

Or even if there isn't.  It's called Congressional oversight, and just

You have to disinguish here between the power to fire the USAs and whether
the exercise of that power was illegal.  The power is absolute.  No thinks
that Congress may stop the President from removing executive officials he
appoints.  But that doesn't make the removal legal if it's done to obstruct
justice.  Was that why some or all of the USAs were removed?  I don't know.
Why don't you want to find out?

(Actually, I know that it's not all.  The USA for Arkansas was fired so
that they could install a political hack, an oppo reseracher who worked for
Karl Rove, someone with little prosecutorial experience.  I wonder why they
chose Arkansas to replace a USA with a political operative?)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Please cite evidence for your position.  Congress doesn't need evidence to
conduct an investigation.  Investigations, no matter what branch conducts
them, attempt to produce evidence that often times wouldn't surface without
the investigation.  There must be reasonable suspicion for a crminal
indictment, but that's not what we're talking about here.

In the case of Carol Lam, the USA for San Diego, the suspicion is that she

she convicted Rep. Cunningham.  Is that true?  I don't know.  Why don't you

&gt; Further, stupidity doesn't equal illegal in this case.
">

Again.  Congress cannot stop the President from removing the USAs.  But
removing them to prevent them from pursuing criminal cases is obstruction
of justice.  And that is illegal.

Is that what happened.  I don't know.  Why don't you want to find out?

In any case, Congress has the power to find out how the money it
appropriated is being spent.  Independently of whether criminal activity is
suspected or uncovered.

To find out how the money is being spent.  Congress authorizes the money
for the DOJ overall and the USAs in particular.  If they want to ask how
that money is used, they may.  Whether the usage turns out to be criminal
or not.

Nobody claims that the act of firing a USA is illegal in and of itself.
If the firing was done to prevent a criminal investigation, then that's
called obstruction of justice.  Independently of whether justice was
obstructed, Congress may inquire at any time for any reason on the
operations of government that if funds (which is everything).

I've accepted this on faith.  Is is true?  Congress often exempts itself

This is an excellent analogy.  The people who authorize the spending of

Actually, the constitutional wording goes slightly beyond that,
too.
However, it is the president's judgement that determines when civil
order has broken down during war.

If it were me, I'd have arrrested Pelosi, Murtha, and one or two
others many months ago for giving aid and comfort to the enemy.

It is their duty under the GC to declare unlawful combatants to
be just that; their citizenship is immaterial to the determination.

The GC guarantees them the right to present evidence before a
military tribunal that can prove they should be treated as POWs
instead of illegal combatants - but that is their only opportunity
to wiggle out of a trial for war crimes.  (e.g. - not bearing their
arms openly; posing as a civilian non-combatant, etc.)

&gt;&gt; Exactly.  There is nothing illegal about the firings.

&gt; Yes except that people from the justice department lied under oath to
&gt; congress.  Under the old congress, they would have turned their heads
&gt; and dismissed it as being inaccurate testimony due to maybe failing
&gt; memories. Under the new congress, it is being investigated
&gt; and one
&gt; interesting point came out, kyle sampson circulated the idea of trying
&gt; to bypass congress completely, circumventing the confirmation process.
">

Let's be clear that this idea was perfectly legal at the time.  In 1966,
Congress passed 28USC541, which allowed the district court to fill a vacant
USA position.  In 1986, this was amended to allow the Attorney General to
make such an appointment, but for no more than 120 days, after which the
district court filled the position.  The 2006 reauthorization of the so-
called PATRIOT act, removed the 120-day limit and the district court power.
This provision was little noticed and the after-the-fact rationalization
was that in case of a terrorist assassination of a sitting USA, the AG
needed to act quickly to name a permanent replacement.

Of course, in the recent scandal, there were no exigent circumstances (or
at least no legitimate ones) that required circumventing the confirmation
process, but the law as written didn't require any.

Congress has just restored the status quo ante from 1986.

You really do like to create your own little realities.  War is a layman's
term, there is also a war on drugs but no formal declaration of war has been
declared by congress concerning drugs.

This is a declaration of war:

http://www.law.ou.edu/ushistory/germwar.shtml

. . . what congress did is authorize the use of force, it did not say 'a
state of war exists between the US and al-qaeda'.
