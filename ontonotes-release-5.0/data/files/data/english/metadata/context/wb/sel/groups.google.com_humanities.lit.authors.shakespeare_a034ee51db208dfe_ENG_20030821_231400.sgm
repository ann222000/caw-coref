I looked up this article and found it quite interesting.
However I'm still confused on a couple of aspects of your explanation.

If I understand your version of the the story correctly:

January 1, 1847: bookseller Thomas Rodd advertises a copy of
Shakespeare's Second Folio. Presumably Collier bought this copy.

Later in 1847: Rodd, at Collier's request, goes to Stratford and buys
an annotated copy of the Second Folio with the name Thomas Perkins in
it, from William Warner. The annotations in this copy were done by an
amateur Shakespeare enthusiast from days gone by, and are of no
particular value or interest to anyone.

In 1849 or earlier: Dr. Wellesley sees an annotated copy of the book
in Rodd's bookstore.

1849: Rodd dies

1852: Collier announces his discovery, claiming he had purchased the
book by happenstance on the day of its arrival at Rodd's bookstore in
1849. Presumably he had actually spent the previous five years
transcribing the notations from the 'real' Perkins folio into the
unmarked 'other' folio along with his own emendations, as well as some
other emendations that had originally been made by one Styan Thirlby
in the second quarter of the eighteenth century in some other
manuscripts which were known to Collier.

First, is this timeline and summary accurately drawn from your
article?

If so, there's still a couple of things I'm confused about:

What copy did Wellesley see in the bookstore? In your
opinion, was it the copy that Rodd privately bought for Collier from
Warner, or was it yet some other copy that is confusing matters?

More importantly, I'm still not clear on why Collier would go
to the trouble of transcribing thousands (?) of (relatively
worthless?) emendations from the 'real' Perkins folio into the 'other'
folio along with his own emendations. Given that it was never his
plan to pass the book off as the folio which Rodd had purchased from
Warner (otherwise Collier needn't have come up with the story that he
had purchased the book by happenstance in 1849), why would he go to so
much trouble? I realize that you mention something along the lines
that the original emendations were so much dross to hide the
emendations that Collier took from Styan Thirlby. But if he was
worried about their discovery, why would he include them in the first
place?

Finally, should we assume that Collier, having used it for his
own purposes, simply destroyed the original Perkins folio?

Thanks for any more info.

&gt;other emendations that had originally been made by one Styan Thirlby
&gt;in the second quarter of the eighteenth century in some other
&gt;manuscripts which were known to Collier.

Yes. The folio described by Rodd exactly matches the Perkins Folio,
the one described by Warner does not. Further, the Rodd catalog does
not mention annotations.

Wellesley did not recollect the time he saw the Warner folio, only that it
had been &quot;some years before&quot; when it arrived &quot;from the country.&quot;
Wellesly's statement, according to Ganzel:

One of those books was an imperfect folio Shakespeare, with an
abundance of manuscript notes in the margins [Wellesley wrote].
He [Rodd] observed to me that it was of little value to collectors
as a copy, and that the price was thirty shillings. I should have
taken it myself; but, as he stated that he had put it by for another
customer, I did not continue to examine it, nor did I think more
about it, until I heard afterwards that it had been found to possess
great literary curiosity and value.

Collier subsequently reiterated his lie that he acquired the folio in
1849 and that he had not even noticed the marginalia that Wellesley
saw at a glance. And yet the Warner folio was purchased expressly
for Collier because of the marginalia, and five pounds was given for it.
If the volume was &quot;put by&quot; on arrival, we may assume that Rodd had
made a previous deal, or he would have sold the book on the spot.
Of course, 30 shillings wouldn't allow much profit on a book he paid
three times as much for.

When Wellesley later examined the Perkins Polio, he said that he
did not observe the name on the cover. Collier apparently did not
further contact the former owner Warner, as one must think he
should. Instead, he continued to rely on Parry's recanted claim
of prior ownership -- this when he had ordered the purchase from
Warner in the first place.

Collier not only appropriated Thirlby's emendations, he drew from
virtually all editions and commentators. One of his objects was to
remove their claims by giving precedence to the &quot;Old Corrector.&quot;
These unacknowleged sources were quickly noticed.

We shouldn't suppose that Collier spent all his time on the job.
Five years is a long time. Collier originally preached against
emendation. He would have been ridiculed if he did an about-face
openly, especially as many of his Perkins emendations are poor.
He opted to give them the authority of an early commentator,
and support them as discoveries.

Ganzel puts Wellesley's and Warner's testimony together. The
name &quot;Perkins&quot; is on the famous forgery, as it was on the Warner,
though not in the same place. Wellesley would not have seen the
name because it probably was not on the cover until Collier put it
there. If Wellesley saw a folio different from the Warner copy, the
chance that each would have the name &quot;Perkins&quot; inscribed is very
low, I would think. Wellesley was surely telling the truth as to the
folio he saw, but his identification of it as the Perkins is more than
doubtful.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;More importantly, I'm still not clear on why Collier would go
&gt;to the trouble of transcribing thousands (?) of (relatively
&gt;worthless?) emendations from the 'real' Perkins folio into the 'other'
&gt;folio along with his own emendations.

"/>

Collier's previous (1841) Egerton Folio marginal forgeries were
caught because they were few (32) and stood alone. He learned
the value of covering marginalia. He escaped suspicion that time,
but his next attempt, if similar, would've been immediately suspect.
Further, his numerous stolen emendations would stick out too
much.

Next, Collier needed protection should the folio be &quot;traced.&quot;
Many of his forgeries have no recorded provenance, as one
may imagine. He attempted this fraud with a &quot;history&quot; that he
could fall back on as a last resort. As it happens, the confusions
provided by Parry and Wellesley were enough to save him
until the paleographic axe fell. Even then, Collier let well
enough alone rather than put his creation to Warner's test.

Collier could not transcribe his emendations into the Warner
folio itself because the differences in writing and significance
of marginalia would not hold up for a minute. He took a chance
that Warner would not be called on, or that he would not be
able to identify the fraud. In the end, he didn't risk it.

Again, what seems troublesome to us was not deterrent to
Collier. The tremendous differences in the quality of the many
entries, largely dating from early editions, has baffled experts.
Why would anyone, genuine or not, show such variance?
But remember, the Perkins matches the advertised copy,
not the Warner. The deed was done, &quot;whys&quot; notwithstanding.
We must beware the &quot;O.J.&quot; fallacy: Why would anyone leave
one bloody glove at the crime scene, and one at home?
Why? Who knows, but it happened. Unless, of course, bloody
gloves prove innocence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Given that it was never his plan to pass the book off as the
&gt;folio which Rodd had purchased from Warner (otherwise Collier

Same answer. Some of Collier's &quot;forgeries&quot; never even had
associated manuscripts. He just said they existed. Others,
such as the numerous Bridgewater manuscripts, failed to
convince. The &quot;Collier Leaf&quot; has a weak (nonexistent) history,
found in the same bookshop.

Collier needed his emendations to hide behind the 'dross'
to give his story credibility. Few could believe he didn't really
see or examine the marginal writing, but as most is of no
value, it is easier to believe that cursory examination would
not reveal the better additions. Otherwise, how to credibly
explain the delay in announcement?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Finally, should we assume that Collier, having used it for his
&gt;own purposes, simply destroyed the original Perkins folio?

"/>

That is my assumption. Collier did leave several scraps of
incriminating evidence of some of his other forgeries, though
we won't read about them in Ganzel (the great scholar).

To repeat my contentions: The evidence provided by Rodd,
Wellesley, Warner, and Collier's response to Parry, all
converges on the conclusion that Warner's folio marginalia
was duplicated in order to place and disguise the forgeries
in a larger context in the same hand. Jerry Downs

Thanks for that, Jerry. It's an interesting analysis. I read
Ganzel's book last year, but didn't follow his argument very well,
getting confused about who was on whose side, and which folio was in
which person's hands. I'm almost tempted to read it again, but given
your debunking, and the opinion of people in this newsgroup like Dave
Kathman, as well as rereading the TLS article by Arthur Freeman, I
don't think I'll bother. But I really should read &quot;Shakespeare's
Lives&quot; one of these days.

By the way, the Perkins Folio is part of the &quot;Fakes, Forgeries,
and Facsimiles&quot; exhibit that just opened at the Folger, and which
I mentioned in another thread. You can't leaf through it, because
it's in a glass case, but it's open to a page full of annotations
that lets you see firsthand what the fuss is about. The exhibit
is free to the general public.

Yes, you should; good background, and Ganzel's book which I really
liked. I think Collier comes off heroically, but tragically. He
deserves credit for his industrious work over the years. One thing
that isn't clear, is which of Colliers finds are legit and which
forged. For instance the Massacre at Paris leaf, Henslowe's Diaries?,
are accepted. The Perkins Folio was only one chapter in a long career.
Has anyone ever compiled a balance sheet on Collier's contribution
overall? Does anything Collier discovered have any bearing on the
Shakespeare Authorship question?

Just reconsidered the last statement. Rhetorical. Of course it
does--why I'd like to see a list of ALL of Collier's finds. Ganzel's
book doesn't say much about them, focusing on the Perkins Folio
debacle instead. If anyone knows were such a list could be found...
