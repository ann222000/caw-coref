The U.S. has done a great job in spending the money the it does have
in foreign invasions. Kudos to Bush and its Neo-Con morons. Before too
long you will have to cart your money in a wheelbarrow to shop at the
grocery store.

It doesn't get any sweeter than this!

The US is in full collapse: politically, militarily, and economically.
Politically, its allies get fewer by the day, their commitment is
lukewarm, and privately they despise the US and snigger at its downfall.
And US rivals, regional and worldwide, rise in strength and influence
daily.

The US military, the mightiest force on earth, a military that spends as
much as the rest of the world combined, is bogged down in a third-world
country smaller than Texas, stalemated and brought to a standstill by a
Resistance without any heavy arms, airforce or navy.

And now the economic collapse begins in earnest.  The US dollar may be at
1.45 to the Euro by Christmas, to 1.50 by March.  And even US allies are
bailing: the Saudis did NOT cut their interest rate to match Bernake's.
That may not mean much to the mouthbreaters here but it means the fucking
oil-rich Gulf States are prepared to follow Kuwait's lead and bail on the
buck.  The US buck will soon be sewered as the world's reserve currency.

And it's all happening on Bush's watch!  Ruinous policies have brought,
oddly enough, ruin!

But in the aftermath of the downfall perhaps the US populace, as it lines
up for the soup kitchens, will reflect on the theme &quot;pride goeth before a
fall&quot; and determine to rebuild their nation in contemplation of the
Constitution and not as the world's policeman and busybody.  If not, the
US will plumb even greater depths.

If the United States were to fall as you describe AND if the US were

bring to bear it's vast military power (even if non-nuclear) and
destroy it's enemies in mass, inflicting collateral damage the likes

Of course that won't happen, because at least one of the tenets is

So far, me too.

I tried to post a thread twice on the loonie/USD parity, but google
was fritzing.  After a lifetime of calling your currency &quot;Monopoly
Money,&quot; Americans now have to eat crow.

And it's not like the trend is gonna reverse.

Fortunately, my positions are in what I told everybody to buy.  Yeah,
the last couple days were rough on the Fed rally, but the fundamentals
haven't changed an ounce.

Our notes are like toilet paper w/ ink on them.

But you were absent-minded before the joy...or emptyheaded, rather.

False.  The effort to &quot;reconstruct&quot; Iraq is bogged down.  It is

Yes.  China is no longer accumulating.  The Gulf States cannot afford
to import our inflation.  The dollar is in serious decline and B52 Ben
is showing no signs of abating.  The Fed will probably cut again.

The downward revision of US lifestyle is inevitable.  The only
question is when the pressure begins on the Euro.  It is not as if ANY
other major nation is NOT inflating at a higher rate than we are.
Australia, China (where their doctored CPI is at 4.8%), the ECB, all
of them are out-inflating us.  This can only end badly.

The italians are boycotting pasta due to price hikes, the Messicans
are rioting over tortilla (corn) prices, and Argentina is trying to
jail Shell execs for not delivering oil to their market at the fiat-
mandated price.  Inflation is becoming a problem EVERYwhere.  China,
too.  Wheat, soybeans, corn, everything...is up.  Gold has momentum
now in ALL currencies.

Too true-
started in Korea, pretty much.
We'd like to wage war without casualties on our side and no 'civilians'
killed. We'll pay with military casualties to preclude hurting 'civilians',

I still maintain that a major motivation for war on Saddam was to establish
a staging area for work in the rest of the ME. Coupled with Afghanistan on
one side and Israel, and Turkey, on the other, we can fight Iran, Syria,
possibly the 'stans, within their own country- as contrasted with fighting
them someplace else.

We're doing really well- very light casualties and a high military affect.
The media tends to report the deaths from internecine warfare as if we
caused them- and as if they weren't repressed by Saddam's depredations
during his reign.
There's no 'insurgency'.
Nobody wants to return the previous administration to power- there is no
'royal line' to fight for. That's a 'nationalistic' word, and doesn't apply
in this context.
There is a civil war- mostly based on insoluable questions; ethnicity is
*huge*, religion is huge, culture is huge.....
I liked your idea about moving 25 miles out of town and just letting them
kill one another till they get tired of it. Form up around the oil fields;
use the product to repay us our war costs and fund the security of Iraq
against invasion from Iran.
I think it's a good time to start enlisting mexicans and convicts- if you
want to repay your debt to society, and do a good deed in repentance, go
fight for your country, if country you want.

Yeah; but to save gas, we'll probably start with Mexico.
Canada will ceast to exist as anything but the next State- administered by
WashingtonDC, as are we all.
And the ME won't be attacking anything they can't reach by camel during
daylight hours.

I am happy at the prospect of your dying, I must admit.  First,

I may actually move to Canada.  Why not live in the Western Saudi

nigeriafication going on, too many messicans, they're fucking seethin
in some places here like roaches, literally crawling up and over shit.

So, I was thinking Norway or NZ, but Canada has plenty of resources,
not a lot of people, almost all white.  That could work.

Getting rich in what? USD? That would be pointless if that currency crashed

accumulating the upsides on other currencies (&quot;crash-proof&quot; ones) or buying into
commodities denominated in those currencies. It's one thing to see a crash
coming, and quite another to pick the strategy that doesn't make you a victim of
it. The extent of any perceived crash must be considered, too.

You see the US crash coming and yet you don't know how to profit from it?

As for getting rich in what, then, yes, I'm getting rich in US dollars -
as measured in US dollars, that is -  and every other currency too.  That
doesn't mean my investments are *denominated* in the asswipe of the US
dollar!  That would be lunacy.

For example, I (and USians too) can easily buy conservative ETFs
(exchange traded funds - I hope you know what they are) for the US market
- S&amp;P500 or the Russell2000 - denominated in (i.e., hedged back to)
Canadian dollars on the Toronto stock exchange.  That way, if you don't
want to bail on the US completely, you could be profiting from the rise
in nominal US stock prices from Bernanke flooding the world with dollars
(although the punchbowl is getting low and the six-year party may soon
end). The hedging is done for you at minimal cost, no exotic efforts on
your part necessary.

Or you could be investing in gold and oil, two commodities that are doing
rather well against the US dollar (gold/Euro has been pretty flat except
for noise the last year and a half).  You can decide whether to buy the
metal itself (coins, bars, etc.), gold certificates, metallic gold ETFs,
gold company ETFs, gold-producing company shares (be sure to get those
who haven't hedged away the upside), and on and on.

Or you could even buy foreign bonds.  You could even look for US
companies with bonds denominated in, say, Euros. (Simplest way of hedging
against the US buck.)  I prefer short duration (&lt;&lt;5 years) but there are
some tax, etc. arguments for going just over 5 years.

The world outside the US is a very big place, even if most USians are too
ignorant and provincial to know it.  Just make sure you invest with the
future in mind and don't just replay the previous decade's winning
strategy. Some thinking is required.

As for a discount brokerage, the best choice by far is Interactive
Brokers: they let you invest (don't trade - it's a sure way to lose money
on any exchange) on most big exchanges worldwide.

Which of these investments do I hold?  All of them (and several more
categories, although I hold only small positions in commodities and
such).  I am a conservative investor (not a speculator or, heaven forbid!
- a trader) and I have a well-diversified buy &amp; hold portfolio.  Well-
diversified on a *worldwide* basis!

My real estate holdings are mostly in Canada, a concentration I intend to
slowly correct over the next several years until I hold in three or four
places.  As it turns out my western Canada overconcentration has paid off
handsomely but that's more by luck than planning on my part.

China finally did it with a missile, something we did or could have
done in the 1970s.  Our last shootdown was with a fking terrestrial
LASER.

China's GPS will likely be about as good as their consumer products,
cheap but you get what you pay for.

I cannot name even one major product that was invented in China.  They
are awfully good at pirating and then banging out copies for cheap.
All their military hardware, all kinds of stuff.  Hell, they even
counterfeit themselves now.

That's the nation that's going to take over the world, a
counterfeiter?  Someone who copies real well?  Even the japs mostly
depend on us for innovation and they are lightyears ahead of the
chinks technologically and culturally.

If Mattell or Walmart loses their suppliers because China cuts them
off for pursuing lead paint claims, so what?  LEARN, mfers, don't
invest in fucking communist dictatorships.  All of this outsourcing
and chinese investment is a sign of our own decline and loss of
compass.  We traded societal health, long term, for a short term
buck.  Instead of looking at the long haul, Walmart looked out for the
short term money bonanza they think they can make from cheap ass
chinese labor, even though it's sweatshop stuff and borderline
immoral.  Same w/ all the toymakers, pure greed and profit ahead of
societal cohesion.  Everyone is out for themselves these days.

You accept his premise, but claim that it doesn't compare to GITMO?
How many people at GITMO were run over by a tank? How many were
intentionally executed?

Yeah... they are AFTER all supposed to be coming  out with an aircraft

They have a better chance if they built another, taller, thicker,
better wall and started meditating about it.

Reminds me of an old old sci-fi anime (wasn't called that back then of

Why would you expect any corporation to ever act differently?

As opposed to when?  When was the enlightened age, when citizens put the

Isn't the US proud of its capitalist history?

Henry Ford paid his employees enough to afford his products.  He made
more money in the long run that way.

Looking out for the long term and having some national or societal
pride means that you act sometimes against immediate gratification and
for longer term goals.

Talk to your grandparents.  Businesses then regarded it as nationally
necessary, a matter of pride, that immigrants learn English.  Now,
they print shit in Spanish for a little extra short term money while
sacrificing cultural cohesion.

TALK to grandparents ! ? !   Hey, pal, I pay Social Security and other
taxes to take that problem off my back problem off my back, and put
those old people in fancy and expensive retirement where they can talk
to nurses PAID to talk to them, get their food from people PAID to
cook for them, etc.  (and it's precisely this kind of Precisely this
kind of economic activity that makes us richer that we used to be when
we did all this unpaid and it didn't count toward GND, GDP, and Gee-
