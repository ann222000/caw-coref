Hi,

Energy is not a well-defined notion in general relativity,
whereas the empty spacetime of special relativity
with its nice symmetries explains the basic conservation
laws of energy and momentum. Gravitation makes spacetime
curved and this means the loss of these conservation laws.
So how is the problem solved or settled? Don't give me
the baez article because I've already read it and it doesn't
give any proposed solution. Does this mean GR is false
as it doesn't take into account the conservation laws?
What have physicists come up to solve the problem?

Yes. In general, but not always (see below).

It's not a problem.

Energy conservation is not a general &quot;law&quot;, it is merely a consequence
of Noether's theorem applied to time translation invariance. In regions
of manifolds which posses a timelike Killing vector[#], one _can_ define
energy in a straightforward way such that it is conserved. In manifolds
that posses no such Killing vector, energy conservation cannot be
expected, and these are the ones in which energy is not well defined.

[#] a timelike Killing vector means that the metric of
the manifold is time translation invariant (i.e. when
one uses the Killing vector as the time axis, the metric
is independent of time).

Note also that GR always has LOCAL energy conservation. This is really
what has been tested so extensively here on earth.

No.

There is no problem.

BTW momentum conservation is the same, except it is related to spatial
translation invariance; and angular momentum is related to rotational
invariance.

If energy is not well defined and not conserved. Then where
does it go? It just can't disappear into thin air.

I read of a physicist proposing a solution to this &quot;not
well defined energy&quot; in General Relativity. He proposed
that spacetime is a four-dimensional surface in some
higher-dimensional space having the same symmetries
as the empty spacetime of special relativity. And the
fundamental symmetries like translation symmetry would
not be symmetries of spacetime but of this higher
dimensional space, and the notion of energy would be
saved! Once this higher-dimensional space is fixed,
the elementary particle quantum number spectrum is
fixed too. He found a single candidate. That of
empty-four dimensional Minkowski space M^4 and
replacing every point in this space with the so
called complex projective space CP2 so as to
obtain eight-dimensional space M^4 x CP2. This
theory can be regarded as a generalization of
superspring models wherein strings are replaced
with three-dimensional surfaces in the framework.

Do you think its justified that he has to propose
such a radical solution to solve the so called
energy momentum conservation problem in
General Relativity? What is the difference between
plain GR and the framework above?? What
practical benefit do you think is produced above?

Tnx.

The answer is that we should be pursuing Lorentz invariant theories of
gravity. See the category, Lorentz Invariant Theories of Gravity that
are Empirically Indistinguishable from Testable General Relativity:

">

Let me illustrate the problem here very simply. Suppose I throw
a ball straight up into the air. The ball has kinetic energy,
but as the ball rises, it *loses* kinetic energy, until it reaches
the top of its trajectory. At that point, it has *zero* kinetic
energy. Where did the energy go?

Well, you could say that it goes into gravitational potential
energy. That answer can be made to work even in General Relativity.
However, &quot;gravitational potential energy&quot; is not a physically
meaningful quantity. It's an artifact of a particular choice
of coordinate system (the fact that you chose a coordinate
system in which the Earth is at rest).

When people say that energy is not conserved in General Relativity,
they mean that there is no coordinate-independent notion of
&quot;the energy of the universe&quot;. If you pick a specific coordinate
system, you can define a conserved quantity that works sort of like
energy but it is not covariant. (That is, it doesn't obey the usual
rules for translating from one coordinate system to another).

Since there are many in the physics community who
maintain the following syllogism is necessarily universally true.

From the Schroedinger 1-D wave equation, it immediately follows
that one of the following statements is necessarily true:

A) Newton is dead.
B) Newton is alive.
C) Newton is quasi-isomorphic to Hawking Radiation.

I think GR somewhat makes up for it with its so-called &quot;gravitational
time dilation&quot;, which, when you think about it, is not time dilation
at all (since time cannot change by definition) but energy
conservation at work in clocks and other processes. If the relativists
would only take their heads out of each other's asses long enough to
get some fresh air, ahahaha... they would come to understand that
gravity, like everything else, is an energy conservation phenomenon.

Energy is very well defined in Newtonian Mechanics, it
is the integral of momentum with respect to time and momentum
is defined as mv.

What is not well-defined is the stupid assertion
'we establish by definition that the &quot;time&quot; required by light to travel
from A to B equals the &quot;time&quot; it requires to travel from B to A'.

Of course E = mc^2.
It doesn't mean E = mc^2/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)

Sure they have. When a neutron decays into a proton
plus an electron plus an anti-neutrino, mass is turned
into energy. The mass neutron is greater than the
sum of the masses of the proton, electron and
anti-neutrino. The difference turns into energy.

When two deuterium atoms fuse, the mass of the
resulting helium atom is less than the masses of
the two deuterium atoms. The difference turns into
energy.

When a uranium-239 atom decays into a neptunium-239 atom,
the mass of the neptunium atom is less than the mass of
the uranium atom. The difference turns into energy.

When an electron collides with a positron to produce
photons, the masses of the electron plus positron
is greater than the mass of the photons (which is zero).
The difference turns into energy.

Why would you say something so completely wrong?

&gt; &gt;If energy is not well defined and not conserved. Then where

&gt; Let me illustrate the problem here very simply. Suppose I throw

&gt; but as the ball rises, it *loses* kinetic energy, until it reaches
&gt; the top of its trajectory. At that point, it has *zero* kinetic

&gt; Well, you could say that it goes into gravitational potential
&gt; energy. That answer can be made to work even in General Relativity.
&gt; However, &quot;gravitational potential energy&quot; is not a physically
&gt; meaningful quantity. It's an artifact of a particular choice
&gt; of coordinate system (the fact that you chose a coordinate
&gt; system in which the Earth is at rest).

&gt; When people say that energy is not conserved in General Relativity,
&gt; they mean that there is no coordinate-independent notion of
&gt; &quot;the energy of the universe&quot;. If you pick a specific coordinate
&gt; system, you can define a conserved quantity that works sort of like
&gt; energy but it is not covariant. (That is, it doesn't obey the usual
&gt; rules for translating from one coordinate system to another).

Tnx. Maybe you are familiar with relativistic quantum field
theory. There is something bothering me.

Fields in QFT are mathematical objects. This means fields
don't really exist?

By real is meant that it can be registered by instruments.
Particles properties can be measured, but how about
fields?

We seem to need fields to explain how particles
may create or destroy. But what if they don't really
get destroyed or created but just move backward
and forward in time like positrons as electrons moving
from the past? Or in a certain sense we can say
the particles can change properties without any fields.

The arrow of time is created from the Thermodynamics
Second Law. In the particle worlds and in the schroedinger
equations. Time is symmetric and it can't violate causality
in SR because it doesn't work macroscopically.

Some researchers said fields are entirely fictitious and
it's false that particles are energy and momentum of
the field. The use of fields is only to model particles
and fields are not real while only particles that can
move backward and forward in time are real.

What do you think?

the difference, if any, comes from tha reactions itself,
can be energy release from de-complexization of molecules,

when you do complexity you use energy,
when yuo decomplex you get that energy back

wake me up when you convert entirely a milligram of

after all, this is what that equation says

okay, i am indulgent, wake me up when you can

In general, for a curved manifold, this fails. Basically one cannot

define &quot;energy&quot; over a finite region is inherent, and deep.

For certain manifolds one can do what you describe. Specifically, either
the region of the manifold must have a timelike Killing vector, or ALL
energy and momentum must be confined to a compact region of an infinite
manifold with spatial topology R^3 (there might be additional caveats,
but those are the main ones). For the latter case the result is a
conserved _total_ energy, but one cannot in general define individual
energies of sub-regions.

It's not a question of &quot;disappearing&quot;, it's rather that one cannot

integration is often not possible (i.e. not well defined -- one obtains
different results depending on how one sums up the different parts).

Hmmm. As long as one expects energy to be measurable in the world we
inhabit (i.e. not just in some imagined higher-dimensional manifold),
and as long as GR holds in the 4-d sub-manifold (as we observe), then
this does not help.

Your example of starting with Minkowski spacetime seems to me to be
degenerate, as energy is always well defined (and conserved globally!)
in a flat manifold.

I think there is no such problem at all. The inability to define
&quot;energy&quot; in GR is natural, and deep. The traditional law of conservation
of energy becomes merely a local law (ditto for conservation of momentum
and angular momentum): in a local region that can be considered to be
flat to one's measurement accuracy, SR applies to that accuracy and all
the usual conservations laws hold. For instance, this applies to most
experiments near earth.

Hmm. In this Wikipedia article:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress-energy-momentum_pseudotensor
it is said that

&quot;... [the] Landau-Lifshitz pseudotensor allows the energy-momentum of a system
of gravitating matter to be defined; in particular it allows the total matter
plus the gravitating energy-momentum to form a conserved current within the
framework of general relativity, so that the total energy-momentum crossing the
hypersurface of any closed space-time hypervolume vanishes.&quot;

Oh. Maybe the point is this: If you can describe a region of spacetime by
a single coordinate patch with nonsingular coordinates, then you can define
a conservation law that is applicable within that patch. But if spacetime
requires several patches, there is no way to link up the conservative
quantity for one patch to the conserved quantity for another. So globally,
there is no conservation.

&gt; &gt; Energy conservation is not a general &quot;law&quot;, it is merely a consequence

It disappears into the holistic vaccuum.
Since energy was not even a physical entity

&gt; &gt;         [#] a timelike Killing vector means that the metric of
&gt; &gt;         the manifold is time translation invariant (i.e. when
&gt; &gt;         one uses the Killing vector as the time axis, the metric
&gt; &gt;         is independent of time).

&gt; &gt; Note also that GR always has LOCAL energy conservation. This is really
&gt; &gt; what has been tested so extensively here on earth.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Does this mean GR is false

&gt; &gt; No.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What have physicists come up to solve the problem?

&gt; &gt; There is no problem.

&gt; &gt; BTW momentum conservation is the same, except it is related to spatial

There are two interpretations to how things should move governed by
the concept of spacetime in general.

1)  Geodesics follow the path of the maximum accumulated spacetime -
This is the most popular model of geodesics.  In this case, all
photons see each path with spacetime of exactly equivalent to zero.
Therefore, light cannot be predicted to move along a certain path.  In
this model, energy is not conserved due to the none-zero result of the
Euler-Lagrange equation associated with the state variable of
spacetime.  The Lagrangian is very simply the following.

L_s = g_ij dq^i/ds dq^j/ds = 1

Where

**  i, j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
**  dq^0 = c dt
**  ds = segment of spacetime

2)  Geodesics follow the path of the minimum accumulated time - This
is not well accepted because it fails to explain a few of the
predictions ever so well predicted by GR.  In this model, photons can
only move at a specific path that the result would accumulate the
least amount of time in accordance with the Snell's law.  In addition,
this model allows the conservation of energy to be a universally
fundamental property as demanded by the Euler-Lagrange equation
associated with the state variable of time.  The Lagrangian for this
model of geodesic is the following (derived from the above equation)
--- yes a little bit more complicated.

L_t = (ds/dq^0)^2 / g_00 - 2 g_0i dq^u/dq^0 / g_00 - g_uv dq^u/dq^0
dq^v/dq^0 / g_00 = 1

No wonder relativity has evaded your understanding for this long. The

sign makes proper time positive. Which is why proper time is defined

&gt; &gt; If energy is not well defined and not conserved. Then where
&gt; &gt; does it go? It just can't disappear into thin air.

&gt; It's not a question of &quot;disappearing&quot;, it's rather that one cannot
&gt; define &quot;energy&quot; at all. Basically because in a curved manifold
&gt; integration is often not possible (i.e. not well defined -- one obtains
&gt; different results depending on how one sums up the different parts).

&gt; &gt; I read of a physicist proposing a solution to this &quot;not
&gt; &gt; well defined energy&quot; in General Relativity. He proposed
&gt; &gt; that spacetime is a four-dimensional surface in some
&gt; &gt; higher-dimensional space having the same symmetries
&gt; &gt; as the empty spacetime of special relativity. And the
&gt; &gt; fundamental symmetries like translation symmetry would
&gt; &gt; not be symmetries of spacetime but of this higher
&gt; &gt; dimensional space, and the notion of energy would be
&gt; &gt; saved!

&gt; Hmmm. As long as one expects energy to be measurable in the world we
&gt; inhabit (i.e. not just in some imagined higher-dimensional manifold),
&gt; and as long as GR holds in the 4-d sub-manifold (as we observe), then
&gt; this does not help.

&gt; Your example of starting with Minkowski spacetime seems to me to be
&gt; degenerate, as energy is always well defined (and conserved globally!)
&gt; in a flat manifold.
">

What do you mean &quot;to be degenerate&quot;? What degenerate?
He is saying that we can model translation symmetry for
example as occuring in a special flat manifold and General
Relativity spacetime just occurs on the surface of the special flat
manifold. Isn't this what Einstein has been searching for
all his life.. to model matter as geometry. Here, the physicist
models objects as surfaces embedded within higher spaces.
So gravity occurs in the curved spacetime (embedding in
the larger flat spacetime), while dynamics of objects
occur in the embedding larger flat spacetime
where all energy is conserved. How come you said it
seems to you to be &quot;degenerate&quot;. What is the context
of your words.. Pls. expand. Tnx.

&gt; I think there is no such problem at all. The inability to define
&gt; &quot;energy&quot; in GR is natural, and deep. The traditional law of conservation
&gt; of energy becomes merely a local law (ditto for conservation of momentum
&gt; and angular momentum): in a local region that can be considered to be

Sure Tom?

In his 2005 textbook gravitation [1] prof. Ivanenko devotes an entire
section to the problem: El problema de la energía del campo
gravitatorio (The problem of energy of the gravitatory field).

The problem, the consequences from it (e.g. for gravitational waves
detection) and the different solutions tried are addressed in that
section.

Did you claim respected gravity specialist devotes and entire section
to an inexistent problem? Or are you claiming that in *your* view
there is no problem?

That energy conservation was not a general &quot;law&quot; but a consequence
from something more 'fundamental' depends on the details of the
axiomatic structure choosed, no?

You are right one can begin from the Noether (which includes T_a^b)
and next derive a conservation law from it. On that case the law looks
less fundamental.

Or alternatively, you can being from the invariance of the functional
and the definition of the tensor T_a^b and then derive the
conservation directly from it. In that case the law is more
fundamental. Any theory can be axiomatized in different ways. The zero
principle of thermodynamics is fundamental in CKC formulation but is a
derivable theorem in MTE formulation.

Now if you are claiming that in GR and only in GR, energy conservation
is not a general &quot;law&quot;, then i agree. In general you cannot define
conservation because of spacetime dinamics.

Now is this GR 'lesson' to be taken seriously? That is far from being
proven.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes, the basis for the problem is on the emphasis on &quot;gravity as
curvature&quot;. Which, of course, has been never verified on laboratory or
astro observation.

The most easy way to solve the (artificially generated) problem is to
eliminate it from the very begining.

Any theory modelling gravitation without curved spacetime (e.g.
Feynman theory or theories cited in your site) is free from that
difficulty.

It would be a good thing if some relativist explain to us why we would
trust GR at this point. Please do not reply that GR has been tested
beyond doubt and, therefore, we may aceppt any consequence derivable
from GR. Because we know of other theories passing the same
fundamental observational tests than GR (and some theories can do
stuff GR clearly cannot).

Well, all current fundamental theories of physics are derived from

In every theory I know, fundamental or derived, energy conservation is

You seem to be unaware of existence of several Noether theorems. You
also appears to be unaware that in field theory, in gauge gravitation,
and others fields the version used includes T_a^b or even Theta_a^b
[2].

The version i use is equation 3.2 in gravitation textbook i cited
above. It includes T_a^b, of course.

I will explain you otherwise. You said GR was not false as it doesn't
take into account the conservation laws. Popularixing your view that

Either you prove that spacetime is curved and GR applicable everywhere

Or said more simple

D_b T_a^b  = 0

Where is your proof about curved spacetimes published, Tom?

Tom's mentioned something to this effect before - an embedding of a
generic GR manifold into a higher dimensional manifold takes 88+2
dimensions.

I would really love to see a proof of that. Even more, I'd like to be

No, because the failure of energy conservation is quite different. For
the systems I mentioned above, energy is not conserved because they can
transfer energy in or out to some larger system -- one must include the
entire system.

But in GR energy conservation fails because one cannot define a
self-consistent meaning of energy. basically one cannot in general
perform volume integrals in a curved manifold, so one cannot total up
the energy in a given region.

Now i see that *you* believe that open systems violate conservation of
energy!

Well Tom, open systems do not violate conservation of energy (i.e.
energy is conserved but not constant). Constant energy and
conservation of energy are two different issues.

Take flat spacetime for simplicity. The process-based description of
energy changes is

dE = d_iE + d_eE

This is, of course, standard notation. I did not invented it, if
someone here never saw before :-)

Conservation of energy reads

d_iE = 0

and is valid with independence of boundaries and flows.

BOTH closed and open system verify conservation of energy. Of course
for open systems d_eE is not zero and the energy changes. But that
change in energy is not incompatible with conservation of energy.

But in the geometrical approach one focuses on the math rather than in
underlying physics. You work only with differential forms dE.
Therefore you may confound dE = 0 (constant energy) with d_iE = 0
(conserved energy).

For an open system in general dE /= 0 and then you think that
conservation of energy has been violated. However, conservation of
energy remains, d_iE = 0 is also valid for open systems.

Also open systems can be in steady states. Then they are open,
conserve energy (d_iE = 0) and maintain constant the energy (dE = 0).

Those differences are specially important for non-conserved quantities
like entropy.

Precisely non-conserved quantities Q are defined by non-zero d_iQ. For
instance for entropy d_iS &gt;= 0. Most textbooks use the geometrical
approach and differential forms and that generate many confusion.

The confusion arises from taking only the differential form (geometry)
without paying attention to the physics is the basis of many
misunderstandings about the second law of thermofdynamics for
instance. I plan a Micro-thought about those all issues, from quantum
to macro theory. Maybe you would take a look.

">

One of reason which we cannot take GR seriously here. But you
dismissed the existence of any problem, true Tom?

Also when you think to explain us where you published your proof about
spacetime curvature? I asked this before.

Once you explain where published that, we can trust D_b T_ab = 0 and
then admit conservation of energy is not a fundamental lesson of
nature (and that quantum mechanics is not fundamental). Precisely this
is Penrose view, but he never provided us the simplest proof,
therefore i am not sure if i would congrat you.

I know you don't &quot;get&quot; the concepts of timelike/spacelike/lightlike,

Only if you deliberately choose a metric signature such that it is

Eric, Koobee has no idea what a metric even *means*, much less
what a &quot;signature&quot; means. He doesn't seem to realize that a
metric is the way to calculate distances, areas, and volumes
even if we are doing calculations in ordinary Euclidean space.

Ask him if he can write down the metric for 3D flat space
in terms of the coordinates h,x,y where h is the altitude
above the surface of the Earth, x is the latitude in degrees
and y is the longitude in degrees. Does he have any idea
how to do that? If not, then his problem doesn't have anything
to do with relativity---he doesn't understand the basic
concepts of the mathematics of geometry.

Ask him to derive the area of a sphere, to prove that it
is 4pi R^2. *Why* is it 4pi R^2? He has no idea.

You can't discuss relativity with him, any more than you
can discuss relativity with a 5 year old. He doesn't have
