I like the looks of this series.  High-concept with a lot of the sorts
of things that got me into comics.  Time-traveling, multiple-earth
hopping action that is bound to be chock full of DCU cameos, while at
the same time able to stand up on the strength of its own characters.
I'm not sure why Booster would need to embellish the buffoon/jerk angle
since his reputation as-is would be a sufficient cover, but that's just
one man's opinion.

I've read people knock Jurgens' art over the years, although I could
never figure out why.  I've always considered it solid and here's no
exception.  I'm glad Booster's &quot;dad&quot; was able to handle the art for this
series.

Regarding the teaser page at the very end -  I really hope that Beetle
panel isn't meant to yank our chains.  It would be perfect if they could
pull some sort of body switcheroo like they did with Booster in 52 and
save Ted, allowing him to team-up with Booster on his mission, maybe
even rename the title 'Blue and Gold'.

Yeah I thought it was just going to be the same old superhero concept
but this is a nice little take.  Although if they're trying to stay
below the radar Booster should really abandon the costumed identity.

Is the thing about &quot;Rip Hunter&quot; being an alias an invention of Johns
or is that something already established?

It seems pretty clear that there will be at least an ATTEMPT to bring
Ted back.  But it might not be succesful.  They've yanked our chains
on his return before and I'm getting the feeling that Ted is meant to
be the 21st Century DCUs Bucky (or Barry Allen).

I wonder how Dan Jurgens feels about only doing the art on the
character he created.

I also wonder if the visit of Supernova to Sinestro will tie in
somehow to the Sinestro Corps War in Green Lantern

I also enjoyed this book...I'm not a big fan of the character but I
love the premise for the series...I just hope they can stick to it and
maintain the quality...and Jurgens' art looks better than it has in
years.

I, too, would love to see Ted come back...they had a built in means of
resurrecting him with the scarab but they by-passed it in favor of a
newer, crappier Blue Beetle.

It took me a while to get into the rhythm and pacing of the story, but
I think I like where it's going.  The only thing that bothers me is
the push and shove nature of Booster's repartee with Skeets.  It has
too much Booster/Beetle cinema of the Super Buddies, which I found to
be annoying after a while.

I second this.  When I heard the concept, I hoped it would be done
well.  So far, issue #1 is meeting my expectations.  I will give the
series a six issue try-out and see if it maintains this level.

Booster is going to be seen a lot by other heroes in the DCU.  He
needs the baffoon fascade so other heroes don't start wondering why
Booster is around all the time at these strange happenings.  He just
stumbled onto them, or else caused them by mistake.

As one of the people who has recently knocked Jurgen's art
(specifically his recent run on Nightwing) I have to admit he was a
pitch perfect choice here. Nightwing should have been more modern,
gritty and forward-looking, whereas this series is more high concept,
retro sci-fi fun and I really enjoyed it.

Either on Newsarama or CBR, I can't recall which, there was (and
probably still is) and interview with Johns and Katz. They both gushed
about working with Dan Jurgens and stated he has had a great deal of
input on the writing and story development.

I think Jurgens' work on BG #1 was outstanding. Overall, a very, very
good start to what looks to be a fun ride.

I remeber Rip Hunter when he was a time-travelling adventurer
commanding a &quot;standard four&quot; group. (You know: scientist-leader, big
hunk of muscle, female romantic interest, impetuous kid. Like the
Fantatic Four or the Sea Devils.) It was pretty standard stuff, but
they looked like they were having fun and interesting adventures.

I don't mind seeing characters change and grow. But now he's paranoid,
overbearing, and arrogant, without a past or friends to speak of,
speaking in desperate platitudes and carefully hiding the secrets of
his past. And you know what? I just don't find him much fun anymore.

Ever since Dark Knight, so many characters have moved towards
paranoid, overbearing, and arrogant. Wheee.

I don't get the impression post-Crisis Rip Hunter has
developed as much as got completely rewritten several times.

One minute he's still leading the Time Masters (with IIRC a
new origin involving Booster), discovering the confusing
limitations on time travel in the post-Crisis DCU (which will
never be referred to again) while he meets all DC's historic
and futuristic characters like a proto-Walker Gabriel.

Then he's Hunter, a grizzled militaristic, by-the-book cyborg,
close friend of Matt Ryder and second-in-command of the Linear
Men; a Cable clone who *wouldn't* try to stop Apocalypse,
because that's what's *supposed* to happen.

Then, without actually changing, he's suddenly the *newest* of
the Linear Men, and the only one open-minded enough to accept
the existance of Hypertime.

Then he's Rip Hunter... Time Master again, back in a version
of his Silver Age outfit and aiding the JSA against Per
Degaton.

And that brings us to 52. I realise the order we read his life
in probably isn't the order in which it happened, but is *any*
of this supposed to fit together?

The character in Booster Gold wasn't even named Rip Hunter before he

the original Rip Hunter, Time Master, or a few of the versions that
came after him but didn't seem to be so fierce about protecting their
histories.

Is it wrong that I'm almost amused by the idea that various time-
travelling villains have gone into the past and killed infants named
&quot;Rip Hunter&quot; (more likely, Richard Hunter or something like that; Rip
must be a nickname), because the current character so cleverly picked
the infants' name as his pseduonym? Thanks, guy! (I'm not embarrassed
because, after all, they're all fictional characters, and even the
writers don't care about them....)

DC has NEVER, EVER provided a useful narrative description of &quot;what
happens when someone changes the past.&quot; (That is, how does the
Grandfather Paradox work out in the DCU.) Without some rule or set of
rules working in the story, al this desperate worry about preventing
characters from changing the past is kind of vague. Just go back and

But the Silver Age stuff worked really well. If you went back in time and
changed the past, YOU were shunted to an alternate timeline where the
changes took place. In quantum terms, you generated an alternate timeline
and COULD NOT get back to your original line. This allowed you to go back in
timer and kill your own grandfather. You would end up in a timeline where
you &quot;weren't alive&quot;, but you would still exist as a cypher in that alternate
universe. If you went back into your own, personal timeline, you would
become a phantom, so that you could not directly change your own history.
(The same object cannot exist simultaneously in two different places.) This
doesn't actually make any sense, but it was a good working rule to prevent
paradoxes.

Of course, the Kingdom storyline played around with this little concept all
over the place. Under the post-crisis rules, you only had one timeline. You
could not kill someone on Tuesday and then go back to Monday and kill them
before they died on Tuesday. This would have ripped the space-time continuum
apart, or simply been impossible. Under Silver Age/Hypertime rules, it was
possible.

There have been a few isolated examples, actually. The biggest one I
can think of, though, is no longer in continuity: the Mordruverse
story in the early issues of the &quot;Five Years Later&quot; Legion of Super-
Heroes.

In short, Brainiac 5 and Mon-El erase the Time Trapper from history.
As a result, the Time Trapper's machinations that prevented Mordru
from conquering the universe during the 30th century are wiped out,
and the universe promptly and violently changes into a Mordru-
dominated dystopia.

... which is effectively what happened, with Glorith being inserted
into history in the place of the Time Trapper. Admittedly, they did
*sort of* address the problems with the approach during the &quot;End of an
Era&quot; storyline that ended the run, but I don't think I'd count that as
a definitive exploration of the dangers of reckless altering of the
time stream, even if it hadn't been retconned out of existence.

&gt;Yeah I thought it was just going to be the same old superhero concept
&gt;but this is a nice little take.  Although if they're trying to stay
&gt;below the radar Booster should really abandon the costumed identity.

&gt;Is the thing about &quot;Rip Hunter&quot; being an alias an invention of Johns
&gt;or is that something already established?

&gt;It seems pretty clear that there will be at least an ATTEMPT to bring
&gt;Ted back.  But it might not be succesful.  They've yanked our chains
&gt;on his return before and I'm getting the feeling that Ted is meant to
&gt;be the 21st Century DCUs Bucky (or Barry Allen).

Not to mention the as-yet-unnamed second person BG wants to save.
I have a hope for who it might be (and it would even make sense
in-story), but I'll wait for the story to unfold.
