Hi,
I am a current DIRECTV subscriber.  The other day I got an older HD DIRECTV
receiver from my brother.  I wanted to use it in the basement on a small lcd
tv over my treadmill.  I ran the cable, hooked everything up, and called
DIRECTV to activate the receiver.  After the usual ridiculous hold time, I
was told I would need a new access card.  I explained that the unit had a
card but was told I needed to have a new one sent to me for $20!  I hung up
on the gentleman.

Why can't I use the existing card?  My brother is no longer a DIRECTV
customer, hasn't been for over a year.  How does DTV justify this given the
fact that if I had cable I could hookup as many TVs as I want for nothing?

Thanks,
Jeff

That has been their policy for quite a while.  You can probably
reactivate a receiver on the original account, but if it is a different
account, a new card is required.  Check the &quot;upgrade equipment&quot; section
of http://www.directv.com .  You may be eligible for a new receiver for
free (or a shipping charge).

If you insist, nicely, they will give you credits for the $20.

The &quot;if I had cable&quot; argument isn't a correct analogy, but it doesn't
matter.  If you have been a DirecTV custerom for a while, you can get a
free receiver installed.  Ignore the old unit that your brother gave you
as example of wasteful practices.

I have had two DirecTV DVRs installed for free in the last six months.  New
cable, new receivers, new mutli-switch.

If the wasting of the old unit bothers you, call back and complain.  Tell
them that you have your finger poised to order a new free unit on the
DirecTV.com web site, which would certinaly cost them more than sending a
new card to you for free.

When I goto Directv.com and click on upgrade system I don't get a choice for
a free HD receiver.  It's like $99 plus a lease fee.  I've been a Directv
customer since April 2003, should they be giving me a free receiver?

I missed the &quot;HD&quot; part.  I haven't seen that for free for an existing
customer.  You should still be able to whine about the $20 fee and get a
credit for it.
