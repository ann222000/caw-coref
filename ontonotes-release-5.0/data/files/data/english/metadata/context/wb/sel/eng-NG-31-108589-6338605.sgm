Folic Acid Boosts Cognition in Older Adults
01.19.07, 12:00 AM ET

FRIDAY, Jan. 19 (HealthDay News) -- Dutch researchers have added
another chapter to the continuing debate over whether folic acid
supplements can sharpen the aging mind. Their conclusion: The nutrient
does improve cognitive function in older adults.
Previous studies on the subject have been split, although most have
suggested that folic acid supplementation in people with high levels of
the amino acid homocysteine in the blood helps with cognitive function.
Higher homocysteine levels are associated with an increased risk for
cardiovascular disease and stroke and possibly also Alzheimer's
disease.

The new study, published in the Jan. 20 issue of The Lancet, adds to
the growing impression that adding folic acid can help brain
functioning, at least in certain groups of people.

"We can certainly take away that folate is going to be beneficial for
cognitive improvement when you have high homocysteine levels," said
Maria Carrillo, director of medical and scientific relations at the
Alzheimer's Association.

"This underscores the importance of B vitamins," added Richard Finnell,
Regents Professor in the Center for Environmental and Genetic Medicine
at Texas A&amp;M's Health Science Center Institute of Biosciences and
Technology at Houston. "They do more than protect babies against birth
defects."

Folic acid, or folate, is a B vitamin probably best known for its role
in helping to prevent neural-tube defects in newborns.

But folic acid also has several other functions: It helps the body
digest and utilize proteins and to synthesize new proteins when they
are needed; it's essential for the production of red blood cells and
the synthesis of DNA; it helps with tissue growth and cell function; it
helps to increase appetite when needed; and it stimulates the formation
of digestive acids.

Food sources of folate include beans and legumes; citrus fruits and
juices; wheat bran and other whole grains; dark, green leafy
vegetables; poultry; pork; shellfish and liver, according to the
National Institutes of Health.

Cognitive function, especially areas such as information processing
speed and memory, decline with age. These cognitive changes have been
linked to a risk of dementia.

For this study, first reported at the Alzheimer's Association's 2005
prevention conference, researchers randomly assigned 818 older adults
in Holland, aged 50 to 70 years old, to receive 800 micrograms of folic
acid supplementation daily or a placebo for three years.

All participants had low folate levels, as evidenced by elevated
homocysteine concentrations.

Adults who received the folic acid supplementation had improved
cognitive functioning, especially in the areas of memory and
information processing speed. What's more, folate concentration
increased 576 percent in those getting the supplements, and
homocysteine levels fell 26 percent.

"Folate can help people with high homocysteine levels," Carrillo
confirmed. "This is in line with what we have been thinking."

The same Dutch researchers, reporting in the Jan. 2 issue of the Annals
of Internal Medicine, found that people who took a folic acid
supplement had less decline in hearing low-frequency sounds over time,
compared with people who didn't take the supplement.

The National Institute on Aging has more on aging and dietary
supplements, including vitamins and minerals.

&gt; Folic acid used for supplementation is synthetic and not the same
&gt; chemically as the natural form of folate. I suppose there would be a
&gt; lot of &quot;processing&quot; and purification involved in the making of that
&gt; chemical. That doesn't really bother me, but how is it &quot;real&quot; food?
">

I agree. If fake manufactured processed folate shows such great
results, imagine what will happen when they get enough
folate-containing real foods in their diets.

My point is that we can't deny the importance of real nutrients to our
health. By real nutrients, I mean those vitamins and minerals that have
been shown scientifically to be essential to our survival and our
thriving physically.

And the converse is that we have to understand how detrimental to our
health these fake manufactured overly processed nutrient-deficient
foods are.

Real nutrition equals real health.

Folate in food is predominantly a mixture of 2 forms -
5-methyl-H4 folate and 10-formyl-H4 folate
( http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubme... )

The synthetic one is "PGA", pteroylmonoglutamic acid. It has higher
bio-availability and is converted to the 5-methyl-H4 form by the body,
but the reaction is saturated at doses higher than 400 mcg
( http://pmid.us/15738964 ) so it's probably better to take it in
divided doses.

Below some clippings from my old folate/folic acid notes:

From
&lt; http://www.cce.cornell.edu/food/expfiles/topics/stover/folicqanda.html &gt;:

"Q. What's the difference between the terms folic acid and
folate?

A. In cells, folic acid exists in many chemical forms with
respect to its oxidation state, one-carbon substitutions and
number of glutamate residues. In general, the term folates,
when used in the generic sense, refers to all chemical forms
of folic acid. The term folic acid refers to the oxidized,
monoglutamate form of folate otherwise known as
pteroylglutamic acid.

Q. Is there a difference in bioavailability between folic
acid in foods versus supplements?

A. The bioavailability of food folate is difficult to
predict. In general, the oxidized, monoglutamate form of
folate, the form found in supplements and the form used to
fortify foods, has a much greater bioavailability than food
folate which tends to be in a chemically reduced and in a
polyglutamated form. The absorption of supplement folate
during fasting is near 100%. Prior to absorption, folate
polyglutamates must be enzymatically converted to folate
monoglutamates, and the efficiency of this reaction varies
depending upon the food source of folate. Therefore, while
all sources are important, more folate is absorbed from
fortified foods and supplements. Folic acid supplements are
even more bioavailable if taken between meals."

From
&lt; http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/scf/out80e_en.pdf &gt;:

"Folate is the generic name for a number of compounds having
a similar activity as folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid,
PGA), i.e. being involved in single carbon (C1-) transfer
reactions. Folic acid (PGA) is a synthetic folate compound
used in food supplements and in food fortification because
of its stability, and becomes biologically active after
reduction. Natural (dietary) folates are mostly reduced
folates, i.e. derivatives of tetrahydrofolate (THF), such as
5-methyl- THF (5-MTHF), 5- formyl-THF and 5,10-methylene-
THF, and exist mainly as pteroylpolyglutamates, with up to
nine additional glutamate molecules attached to the
pteridine ring.

[...]

Food folates, mainly present as polyglutamates, have to be
hydrolysed by a (brush border associated) deconjugase enzyme
in the gut before absorption can occur. Folate absorption
from natural food is generally lower than synthetic forms
(e.g. folic acid) contained in supplements, due to matrix
effects and the presence of inhibitors of the conjugase
enzyme in some foods. Folic acid (PGA) enters the folate
cycle after reduction by a (dihydro-)folate reductase. This
enzyme is present in the intestinal mucosal cell, but also
in other tissues, such as liver and kidney. Reduction of PGA
may be a slow process in some subjects and at higher intake
levels (&gt; ca 260 µg) PGA may appear unchanged in the
circulation (i.e. in the postprandial state after supplement
use (Kelly et al., 1997). Under normal conditions 5-MTHF (as
monoglutamate) is the only form present in plasma, mainly
protein-bound. Tissue uptake is carrier-mediated and/or
through folate binding proteins. In tissues folates are
retained as polyglutamates and the folate coenzymes can be
interconverted in numerous (de-)methylation reactions, such
as in DNA synthesis (formation of thymidilate from
deoxyuridine), amino acid interconversions, such as the
remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. In this latter
methionine synthase (MS) reaction vitamin B12 is also
involved as a cofactor. About 50% of the folate body store,
estimated to be 13-28 mg, is considered to be present in the
liver (for review see Report of the Standing Committee on
the scientific evaluation of dietary reference intakes
(DRIs) and its panel on folate and other B-vitamins and
choline. Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine,
1998)."

From
&lt; http://users.umassmed.edu/martin.marinus/Mph200/FolicAcidMetabolism.pdf &gt;:

"DHF and THF from natural sources are polyglutamated and
need to be enzymatically converted to the monoglutamate for
absorption from the small intestine."

(DHF=dihydrofolic acid; THF=tetrahydrofolic acid)

From
&lt; http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/nutsupdrugs/fol_011... &gt;:

"The term folate is used in two different ways. Folate, a
member of the B-vitamin family, is a collective term for a
number of chemical forms which are structurally related and
which have similar biological activity to folic acid. Folate is
also the term which is used for the anionic form of folic acid.
Folic acid or pteroylglutamic acid (PGA) is comprised of para-
aminobenzoic acid linked at one end to a pteridine ring and at
the other end to glutamic acid. The pteridine-para-aminobenzoic
acid portion of the molecule is called the pteroyl group. Folic
acid is a synthetic folate form which is used for food
fortification and nutritional supplements. It is not one of the
principal naturally occurring forms of folate, used in the
collective sense.

The naturally occurring forms of folate differ in the extent of
the reduction state of the pteroyl group, the nature of the
substituents on the pteridine ring and the number of glutamyl
residues attached to the pteroyl group. The naturally occurring
folates, include 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), 5-
formyltetrahydrofolate (5-formyl-THF), 10-
formyltetrahydrofolate (10-formyl-THF), 5,10-
methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-methylene-THF), 5,10-
methenyltetrahydrofolate (5,10-methenyl-THF), 5-
formiminotetrahydrofolate (5-formimino-THF), 5,6,7,8-
tetrahydrofolate (THF) and dihydrofolate (DHF). Most naturally
occurring folates are pteroylpolyglutamates, containing two to
seven glutamates joined in amide (peptide) linkages to the
gamma-carboxyl of glutamate. The principal intracellular
folates are pteroylpentaglutamates, while the principal
extracellular folates are pteroylmonoglutamates.
Pteroylpolyglutamates with up to 11 glutamic acid residues
exist naturally.

[...]

PHARMACOKINETICS

Folic acid or pteroylglutamic acid (PGA) is the form of
folate used in food fortification and the principal form of
folate found in nutritional supplements. Natural food
folates are pteroylpolyglutamate derivatives.
Pteroylpolyglutamate derivatives are hydrolyzed to
pteroylmonoglutamate forms prior to absorption from the
small intestine. The enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage is
called folate conjugase or gamma-glutamylhydrolase. The
monoglutamate forms of folate, including folic acid, are
transported across the proximal small intestine via a
saturable pH-dependent process. Higher doses of the
pteroylmonoglutamates, including folic acid, are absorbed
via a nonsaturable passive diffusion process. The efficiency
of absorption of the pteroylmonoglutamates is greater than
that of the pteroylpolyglutamates.

Because of the difference in absorption efficiency between
natural food folate and folic acid, the concept of dietary
folate equivalents (DFEs) has been introduced. Folic acid
taken on an empty stomach is twice as available as food
folate. Folic acid taken with food is 1.7 times as available
as food folate. For example, 400 micrograms of folic acid
taken on an empty stomach is equivalent to 470 micrograms of
folic acid taken with food and is equivalent to 800
micrograms of food folate. DFEs can be calculated as
follows:

1 microgram of DFEs = 1 microgram of food folate = 0.5
micrograms of folic acid taken on an empty stomach = 0.6
micrograms of folic acid taken with meals.

Following absorption of physiological amounts of folic acid
into the enterocytes, a certain percentage undergoes
reduction. Reduced folate is transported to the liver via
the portal circulation. Much of a pharmacological dose of
folic acid is transported to the liver as such, without
first undergoing metabolism in the enterocytes. The various
natural pteroylmonoglutamate forms undergo some metabolism
in the enterocytes to pteroylpolyglutamate forms, but for
the most part are also transported as their unmetabolized
forms via the portal circulation to the liver. The folates
are taken up by the liver and metabolized to polyglutamate
derivatives (principally pteroylpentaglutamates), via the
action of folylpolyglutamate synthase. Folates are stored in
tissue in their polyglutamate forms. Folate is metabolized
to its various metabolic forms in the liver. The various
pteroylpolyglutamate forms are the active cellular cofactor
forms of folate. Folate polyglutamates are released from the
liver to the systemic circulation and to the bile. When
released from the liver into the circulation, the
polyglutamate forms are hydrolyzed by gamma-
glutamylhydrolase and reconverted to the monoglutamate
forms.

The principal folate in the plasma is 5-
methyltetrahydrofolate in its monoglutate form. 5-
Methyltetrahydrofolate circulates in erythrocytes in its
polyglutamate form. Approximately two-thirds of folate in
plasma is protein bound. All tissue forms of folate are
polyglutamates, while circulating forms of folate are
monoglutamates. When

This is interesting. I haven't read all the material, but if conversion is
lmited above 400 mmg, all the studies that show no cardiac benefit of folic
acid supplementation (above 400 mmg) may be failing to find a benefit
because of the reduced conversion. Further, I gather that a divided dosing
schedule might change that.

Of course, the cognitive benefits shown might be due to the unconverted
synthetic form in the blood... ;-)

According to the article

"What are the benefits of taking the "fancy" form of folic acid,
5-methyl tetrahydrofolate, and how would I know if it is better for me
if I decide to try it?"
&lt; http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid%3A269705 &gt;

mutations have been found at two locations on the gene needed to
convert folic acid into 5-MTHF and that roughly a quarter of the
population has one or both of the mutations. The conversion of folic
acid to 5-MTHF still takes place in these people but even more slowly
than normal, and there is a tendency for homocysteine to become
elevated.

Using 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in supplementation instead of folic
acid would overcome the conversion problem:

I don't know about the availabily of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. It is
probably available somewhere, but is not ubiquitous as the regular
folic acid. Does anyoone know where to get it? About the first link my
quick web search returned was
&lt; http://www.fallonpharmacy.com/prod_details.php?pid=2490 &gt;, but that is
mixture, and the amount of 5-MTHF is not given.

Here's another search result, seems to be mainly informative, but
badly formatted :-):

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What's the difference?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Folate in food is predominantly a mixture of 2 forms -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;5-methyl-H4 folate and 10-formyl-H4 folate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;( http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubme... )

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The synthetic one is &quot;PGA&quot;, pteroylmonoglutamic acid. It has higher
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bio-availability and is converted to the 5-methyl-H4 form by the body,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but the reaction is saturated at doses higher than 400 mcg
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;( http://pmid.us/15738964 ) so it's probably better to take it in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;divided doses.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not aware that PGA has markedly lower conversion with doses above 400
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mmg. The abstract of the cited document looks like an opinion piece rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than a lab study. If you have the full text, can you quote the paragraph or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so dealing with limits on folic acid conversion?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would greatly appreciate it if you could clarify this!

&gt;&gt;&gt;I quoted that excerpt once before, so I'll just post a groups link to
&gt;&gt;&gt;Michael's reply that also conatained the abstracts of the quoted
&gt;&gt;&gt;studies -

&gt;&gt;This is interesting. I haven't read all the material, but if conversion is
&gt;&gt;lmited above 400 mmg, all the studies that show no cardiac benefit of folic
&gt;&gt;acid supplementation (above 400 mmg) may be failing to find a benefit

Pharmacokinetic study on the utilisation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
and folic acid in patients with coronary artery disease.
Br J Pharmacol. 2004 Mar;141(5):825-30. Epub 2004 Feb 9.
PMID: 14769778 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

Abstract:

1. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a regulating
enzyme in folate-dependant homocysteine remethylation,
because it catalyses the reduction of 5,10
methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-
MTHF).

2. Subjects homozygous for the 677C right arrow T mutation in
the MTHFR enzyme suffer from an increased cardiovascular
risk. It can be speculated that the direct administration of
5-MTHF instead of folic acid can facilitate the remethylation
of homocysteine in methionine.

3. The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetic
properties of orally administered 6[R,S] 5-MTHF versus folic
acid in cardiovascular patients with homozygosity for 677C
right arrow T MTHFR.

4. This is an open-controlled, two-way, two-period randomised
crossover study. Patients received a single oral dose of
either 5 mg folic acid or 5 mg 5-MTHF in each period. The
concentrations of the 6[S] 5-MTHF and 6[R] 5-MTHF
diastereoisomers were determined in venous blood samples.

5. All pharmacokinetic parameters demonstrate that the
bioavailability of 5-MTHF is higher compared to folic acid.
The peak concentration of both isomers following the
administration of 6[R,S] 5-MTHF is almost seven times higher
compared to folic acid, irrespective of the patient's
genotype. However, at 1 week after the administration of a
single dosage 6[R,S] 5-MTHF, we detected 6[R] 5-MTHF
following the administration of folic acid, indicating
storage of this isomer in the body.

6. Our results demonstrate that oral 5-MTHF has a different
pharmacokinetic profile with a higher bioavailability
compared to folic acid, irrespective of the patient's
genotype. Detrimental effects of the storage of high levels
of the non- natural isomer 6[R] 5-MTHF cannot be excluded."

Unless we use Metafolin, which contains only the natural isomer 6[S]
and no non-natural isomer 6[R]. From its product brochure
&lt; http://www.metafolin.com/pdfs/About%20the%20Product_13.12.pdf &gt;:

"The chemical synthesis Metafolin starts from the commercially
available B-complex vitamin folic acid, which is reduced to
tetrahydrofolate. This reduction step leads to the formation of
a new chiral center and two diastereoisomers in an equimolar
ratio. In nature, methylfolate consist only of the pure L-
isomer (6S-isomer); processes were thus developed allowing the
isolation of the natural L-methylfolate by selective
crystallization. Metafolin is produced in accordance with cGMP
using a patented process."
