Caption: The Bush administration has its priorities backwards once
again.

Here we go again! President Bush recently submitted his proposed
federal budget to Congress.

Here's the non-surprise of the year...it contains more tax breaks for
the wealthy and program cuts for just about everyone else.

Oh yeah, and lots of money for the unnecessary war in Iraq.

Here's a preliminary analysis from Robert Greenstein of the Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities. A sample:

In a sign of the President’s misguided priorities, his budget puts
extremely large tax cuts for the most affluent Americans ahead of the
needs of low- and middle-income families as well as future generations.
Low- and middle-income Americans would be hit by budget cuts in areas
from education to protection of the environment and assistance to the
poor. Future generations would foot the bill for the much larger
long-term deficits that the President’s extravagant tax cuts would
produce. The tax cuts in the budget far exceed proposed reductions in
domestic programs.
Among programs targeted for cuts are the Children's Health Insurance
Program, low income home energy assistance, child care assistance for
low income working families, Head Start, food programs for low income
elderly Americans. Cuts are also proposed for mandatory programs such
as Medicare and Medicaid.
Tax cuts for the wealthy would be made permanent, adding between $2.3
to $3.5 trillion in costs over the next ten years. Needless to say, all
this would increase the nation's growing inequality and the national
debt.
As the Charleston Gazette noted about the war budget: The White House
plan would pump another $100 billion into the Iraq and Afghan wars this
year, plus $145 billion more next year. The Pentagon budget would leap
to $625 billion a year — perhaps exceeding the warmaking expenditures
of all other nations on Earth, combined.

CONGRESSIONAL RESPONSE. The Bush budget won't be received with many
cartwheels in Congress, where the new majority will face some difficult
decisions. As the New York Timesput it yesterday,

...Democrats know that the only way they can find the revenue to
restore the administration’s proposed spending cuts would be to cut
back on military spending, delay their stated intentions to balance the
budget or rescind the Bush tax cuts in future years. They are not
especially eager to do any of these.The most likely result, even some
Democrats acknowledge, will be a limited reshaping of the budget by
restoring some proposed cuts in a variety of domestic programs,
including children’s health care, Head Start and home heating
assistance for the poor and the elderly.
I hope they'll do better than that. In any case, advocates of working
people, the elderly, and children will have another budget battle in
the days ahead.

RANDOM THOUGHT OF THE DAY: If you ever get really bored, try this.
Watch infomercials on TV. It doesn't matter what they're for--exercise
gear, cleaning materials, cookware, health gimmicks. Then call the
toll-free number and ask whoever answers stupid questions about the
product, such as a. Can this be used for time travel? b. Will it remove
the taint of Original Sin? Does it convey the power of invisibility? El
Cabrero and his cabritos used to pass many a dull afternoon in this
manner.
