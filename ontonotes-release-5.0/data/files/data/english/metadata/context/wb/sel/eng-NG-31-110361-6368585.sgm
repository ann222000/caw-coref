*sigh*

Here we go again. They are pulling all my videos from a Blip feed.

I'm at the point where I am about to remove all my videos from
external sites and host them on my own server requiring people to
login to view them.

This sucks.

Not to make light of the situation David, but I hear Superman has
cheap hosting rates and a great server array at the Fortress of

I havent checked out these latest offenders yet but if its getting to
the point where some people want to close off their content, then I
start to panic and look to the past discussions to see if there is an
alternative way to deal with this stuff.

Maybe we could look again at the idea of having linkbacks, creative
commons licenses and other forms of attribution, actually be attached
to the videos themselves in some meaningful way that works jsut as
well as a weblink elsewhere on a page, so that it doesnt matter so
much if all these leeches dont do the right think on their pages?

Well, we see how it goes. I just sent a removal request via their web
page. But it is becoming increasingly clear we have carpetbaggers with
$$$ in their eyes.

Or is it a matter of education? We may have to take a pre-emptive
approach like sending information packs to these aggregator sites on
what creative content material is and why you shouldn't snatch it cuz
you see it.

This is the first wave - we have to find a better way of dealing with
this that the wolf pack approach. I'm not putting it down. It was
effective but...?

Response from VideoRonk:

"Considered usuary.

Videoronk is a finder that obtains the videos of youtube, google
video, blip, metacafe, dailymotion, myspace, vimeo and revver. We did
not lodge any video in our systems. They are these finders to which
you would have to go so that they retired your video.

So basically they are saying that they are a pass through system that
they just happen to pick up feeds and slap ads above them.

This is a similar approach taken by http://www.zabasearch.com .
Zabasearch post public personal information taken from other sources.
When you ask them to remove it they state they don't store the info on
their servers they are just a "pass through" service.  With ads.

It appears that the problem is that basically anyone can create an
aggregator and pull feeds from it. Unless there is something done that
prevents this, this is going to happen more and more.

In this case, for me, it's the Blip feed that is being ripped. To have
them stop displaying my videos, I will have to remove them from Blip.
So at this point, I am going to have to make a decision. Delete my
videos from Blip? Delete my feed?. Password protect my feed? Admit the
CC license really means nothing and not care who does what with my stuff?

There doesnt appear to be that much concern here in preventing or
resolving it.

David I have a polite disagreement with your statement about no one
caring about this situation. This is the kind of situation that will
help test the value of a CC license agreement. For me it is also the
eternal balance between my life and vlogging. Sometimes I gotta make
room for the analog stuff.

Most of us know that with the expansion of video distribution
opportunities there will be companies who want to exploit what they
see as a golden opportunity.

The RSS feeds are just sitting there. They get an idea to collect the
feeds and slapping ads on them. They might have even paid cash money
to an adviser or someone at a conference telling them to do just that.

Some of this is borne out of ignorance. Ignorance of the intended
meaning of the license, or of ethical business practices or straight
up greed. From the wording of the reply that I received I suspect that
the owners are not in the U.S. What do we do about non-U.S. based
snaggers?

Now we are very fortunate that we have the assistance of Mike and
Blip.TV but we need to think about how an individual like myself is
going to handle this. I know this conversation is going on in multiple
posts.

What are the concrete things we can do to draw attention, educate or
whack the fools upside their heads to come to consciousness?

I'm thinking:

1. Produce an educational video to send to aggregators to help them
understand the license. Could we work with Creative Commons to create
and distribute such a packages?

2. Create an highly insulting video about the current ripoff practices
that they run on their service. As an added bonus maybe send a link or
video to potential funders/advertisers. Might not do any good, might
not even be ethical but the mere thought makes me feel good.

3. For me, I have to consider switching to a traditional license. I
don't want to do that - I love the idea than some of the videos are
being used by non-profits for their purposes.

There has got to be a license for what I am trying to do but on the
other hand I don't want inappropriate ads appearing next to some of my
content.  One of my posts is titled "Love Prosper" about Christian Hip
Hop performers. I get the willies just thinking about what kind of ads
are going to latch on to that post.

Not the best ideas but we gotta move from the theory to the practical.

Ive started to hunt for info about them on the internets.

So far Ive learnt that the developer is Spanish, I dont know where
they are based, and that ronk might mean masturbate in norwegian.

For all I know the site might be supposed to be called videorank but
got lost in translation somewhere.

Anyways, it seems been around a while and I found at least one blog
that drew attention last year to the way videoronk uses adverts:

http://videoontheweb.wordpress.com/2006/11/10/the-video-content-explo...

Other article Ive read for info about videoronk so far:

http://mashable.com/2006/09/29/videoronk-download-videos-from-youtube...

Someone after freelancers to build a site with the same functionality:

http://www.getafreelancer.com/projects/PHP-XML/Videoronk-clone-functi...

My research is only at a very early stage and hopefully wont be needed.

Somehow the days when the biggest problem was dealing with hosting and
skeptics who couldnt see internet video finally catching on, seemed
more fun than the current phase, wibble.

Please don't do that.  You can't let someone else's nonsense deter
you from pursuing your creative outlet, even if they're misusing your
material and presenting it in ways totally anathema to you.  You
can't let that stop you.  Creativity is part of the life force.  You

Can you expand on that?  What kind of license are you going to get
that would make any difference to someone aggregating RSS feeds?

It's not "Creative Commons" that's being disrespected.  They're
ignoring everything except the fact that you made a video and they can
subscribe to your feed.

Do you think they actually _watch_ the videos they aggregate to see if
there's a licensing block at the end?  Do you think, especially given
the response you received in this case, that they would bother to
remove each particular individual feed whose license they were
disregarding?  CC or Traditional?

Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you mean by "switching to a
traditional license".

Bill, I think that's exactly right. While there is a great deal of education
that needs to occur around CC licensing, I'm not sure that's the issue at
play here. Videoronk is pulling videos from all over the place - they
certainly aren't all covered by CC.

And frankly, I'm a little concerned about the slipperiness of this slope. I
personally value CC licenses because they take into account the openness of
the web. I want people to share my videos. If I have google ads on my blog
and I embed one of your videos, am I violating your CC license? Are we going
to move toward locking our videos down on our own sites and using DRM to
protect them? Blip can block these sites all day long and they're just going
to keep popping up.

I found my videos on Vidoeronk pulled in from the Revver feed. Because
they're syndicating the Revver player, the Revver ads are included and I'm
making money. Or at least I would if I didn't work at Revver. :)  Revver's
business model was built upon the understanding that videos would be
increasingly syndicated on the open web. We wanted to give creators a way to
benefit from that. We still have a ways to go to improve our player so that
attribution and linkbacks are automatically included. But at least in this
scenario, Revver users are making money for their work.

Speaking for myself, I'm personally OK with my videos being on Videoronk.
The ads at Videoronk aren't associated directly with my videos (at least so
far). I think this example is very different than what happened with
MyHeavy. MyHeavy pulled videos into their own player and attached
advertising to the video - not on the page around the video. That was
clearly not ok. In this scenario, I'm not so sure I think my CC license is
being violated (at least the noncommercial part of it).  What is missing
from videoronk is attribution and linkbacks. Let's build those directly into
the players. Let's attribute ourselves and provide urls directly in the
videos. Let's use the tool at our disposal to get what we want instead of
embarking on an endless goose chase to hunt down everyone pulling RSS feeds.
We have to find ways to benefit from what happens naturally on the web
instead of trying to constantly battle it.

&gt; Can you expand on that? What kind of license are you going to get
&gt; that would make any difference to someone aggregating RSS feeds?

&gt; It's not &quot;Creative Commons&quot; that's being disrespected. They're
&gt; ignoring everything except the fact that you made a video and they can
&gt; subscribe to your feed.

&gt; Do you think they actually _watch_ the videos they aggregate to see if
&gt; there's a licensing block at the end? Do you think, especially given
&gt; the response you received in this case, that they would bother to
&gt; remove each particular individual feed whose license they were
&gt; disregarding? CC or Traditional?

&gt; Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you mean by &quot;switching to a
&gt; traditional license&quot;.

I don't think the issue is advertising. If it was there wouldn't be an issue since ads with video is now fairly commoditized technology. I think the bigger issue is credit and respect for the terms of the cc license itself, which can put restrictions on commercial use and require proper attribution.

In terms of videoronk my concern is that credit is given to blip but not to the content creator.

Bill, I think that's exactly right. While there is a great deal of education
that needs to occur around CC licensing, I'm not sure that's the issue at
play here. Videoronk is pulling videos from all over the place - they
certainly aren't all covered by CC.

And frankly, I'm a little concerned about the slipperiness of this slope. I
personally value CC licenses because they take into account the openness of
the web. I want people to share my videos. If I have google ads on my blog
and I embed one of your videos, am I violating your CC license? Are we going
to move toward locking our videos down on our own sites and using DRM to
protect them? Blip can block these sites all day long and they're just going
to keep popping up.

I found my videos on Vidoeronk pulled in from the Revver feed. Because
they're syndicating the Revver player, the Revver ads are included and I'm
making money. Or at least I would if I didn't work at Revver. :)  Revver's
business model was built upon the understanding that videos would be
increasingly syndicated on the open web. We wanted to give creators a way to
benefit from that. We still have a ways to go to improve our player so that
attribution and linkbacks are automatically included. But at least in this
scenario, Revver users are making money for their work.

Speaking for myself, I'm personally OK with my videos being on Videoronk.
The ads at Videoronk aren't associated directly with my videos (at least so
far). I think this example is very different than what happened with
MyHeavy. MyHeavy pulled videos into their own player and attached
advertising to the video - not on the page around the video. That was
clearly not ok. In this scenario, I'm not so sure I think my CC license is
being violated (at least the noncommercial part of it).  What is missing
from videoronk is attribution and linkbacks. Let's build those directly into
the players. Let's attribute ourselves and provide urls directly in the
videos. Let's use the tool at our disposal to get what we want instead of

And I'm saying I think we have the tools to correct that ourselves which in
the long run will better serve us than hunting down every aggregator out
there that doesn't take upon themselves to do so. There's just no way to
keep up. Let's build players that include attribution and links directly.
And as creators, we should be sure to add that information to the videos

My thoughts about a traditional license was that if I had to fight to
prevent uses in situations I didn't want my videos to appear I would
be on established legal ground.

From a practical standpoint it would be easier to convince a judge my
rights instead of educating him/her on CC licenses.

I'm not going to switch anytime soon. I am considering it at this
point because this is the second of many more instances of this kind
of robbery.

I also feel that the lawyers for Google Video, YouTube, Daily Motion
and other services that are being ripped off may be planning their own
response to this kind of theft. Cuz that what it is, they take Google
Video RSS feed, set up shop and then have the nerve to slap ads from
Google Adsense above it is just asking for trouble.

Here is the deal. I want a tool or practical approach to deal with
this kind of problem. I want something I can do that doesn't require
the intervention of a third party. (But much appreciated.)

I want something that I can use and can explain to another person if
this happens here is what you can do about it. I think that what we
are all peculating on.

Building players that include links and attribution directly is great,
but for blip it's not a complete solution since we need to support every
format under the sun (from divx to mp4) in order to ensure content
creator flexibility and device / platform compatibility.  So while we
may build a Flash player that includes attribution and links in it we
won't be able to do that with, say, mp4 files which don't have a
container to build such tools in.

I suppose that we could offer people an option to lock their content
down and lose the direct references to video files in RSS and the like,
but that is somewhat counter to our philosophy.  We're all about sharing
media openly all over the Interwebs, and personally I'm not interested
in letting a few bad apples get in the way of that.

Based on the reply that Gena got back from them, what I meant was that
I would have to remove the videos from Blip to stop them from
displaying them.

If I dont do that, I will possibly have to put an intro on my videos
stating that unless you are viewing the piece from any of the sites
that I have listed as allowed to distribute my work, the viewer is
watching unauthorized and stolen content. Also, provide an email
address in the intro informing the viewer to contact me if they think
the content could be "pirated".

How draconian...hmm?

&gt; Please don't do that.  You can't let someone else's nonsense deter
&gt; you from pursuing your creative outlet, even if they're misusing your
&gt; material and presenting it in ways totally anathema to you.  You
&gt; can't let that stop you.  Creativity is part of the life force.  You

&gt; &gt; In this case, for me, it's the Blip feed that is being ripped. To
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; them stop displaying my videos, I will have to remove them from
&gt; Blip.
&gt; &gt; So at this point, I am going to have to make a decision. Delete my
&gt; &gt; videos from Blip? Delete my feed?. Password protect my feed? Admit
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; CC license really means nothing and not care who does what with my

&gt; &gt; There doesnt appear to be that much concern here in preventing or

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Considered usuary.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Videoronk is a finder that obtains the videos of youtube, google
&gt; &gt; &gt; video, blip, metacafe, dailymotion, myspace, vimeo and revver. We
&gt; did
&gt; &gt; &gt; not lodge any video in our systems. They are these finders to
&gt; which
&gt; &gt; &gt; you would have to go so that they retired your video.

&gt; &gt; &gt; We felt not to be able to help in this question. A greeting.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Videoronk.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; So basically they are saying that they are a pass through system
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; they just happen to pick up feeds and slap ads above them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a similar approach taken by http://www.zabasearch.com .
&gt; &gt; &gt; Zabasearch post public personal information taken from other
&gt; sources.
&gt; &gt; &gt; When you ask them to remove it they state they don't store the
&gt; info on
&gt; &gt; &gt; their servers they are just a &quot;pass through&quot; service.  With ads.

&gt; &gt; &gt; We have a problem here.

I see... You're not talking about prevention.  You're talking about
recourse.

Prevention could (hypothetically) consist of either something in the
feed that blocks aggregators from slurping videos from your feed or
something visual in your video that alerts potential aggregators that
there are going to be "consequences &amp; repercussions" if they utilize
your video in ways that your chosen license doesn't allow.

The problem with visual prevention is that nobody's watching your
videos.  They're automatically taking the entire blip feed that just
happens to have your videos included.  Therefore, whether you show an
"All Rights Reserved" card on your video or a "Creative Commons
[whatever]" card, nobody sees it.

The problem with prevention via feed is that there's no telling what
the aggregator's going to do with your video.  There's nothing that
sends to blip "I intend to put a full-screen ad in front of your
280-pixel-wide video and flank it with chicks in lingerie without
linking back to you or crediting anyone as the content creator" so
that blip could automatically veto their "application" for your video.
Instead, it's up to the aggregator to search the information in the
feed and go "oh... She put a Non-Commercial license on her video...
Which means that we aren't supposed to put ads on it.... And we INTEND
to put ads on it, so don't take that particular video, check her next
video for an incompatible license".

On top of all that, in this case, when you told them about your issue,
they told you "I can't do nothin' for ya, man", and claimed to be
insulated from dealing with you directly because they're aggregating a
different site that already aggregated you.

Short of "Whack-A-Mole" (or not using RSS at all), prevention is
currently impossible.

Recourse is where a traditional license might help you out....... or not.

Deleting all my videos from Blip and removing my own feed would stop
aggregators.

As I said earlier, I have some thinking to do about this.

Yes, all of that information is in the feed.  It includes the permalink
to the post on blip in the item:link element, and also includes special
metadata that's presently unique to blip for credit.  Here's an example
from a random video I picked on blip:

&lt;blip:user&gt;thatphoneguy&lt;/blip:user&gt;
&lt;blip:show&gt;30 Seconds with Phone Guy&lt;/blip:show&gt;
&lt;blip:showpage&gt; http://thatphoneguy.blip.tv/ &lt;/blip:showpage&gt;
&lt;blip:picture&gt; http://blip.tv/uploadedFiles/user_photo_thatphoneguy746.jp
g&lt;/blip:picture&gt;

So that tells the aggregator that the video is from the "30 Seconds with
Phone Guy" series, which can be found at http://thatphoneguy.blip.tv/ .
It even gives the aggregator a picture that can be used to represent the
series, which can be found at
http://blip.tv/uploadedFiles/user_photo_thatphoneguy746.jpg .  We'd love
to use standard elements for these pieces of metadata, but they don't
exist yet -- we're including them in our own namespace right now so that
our formal partners can pick up and use the data for attribution
purposes.

There's a &lt;copyright&gt; element in RSS 2.0, but that's a human-readable
string and not really useful for machines. If you want machines to read
the license info the CC namespace seems to be the way to go. It doesn't
help that &lt;copyright&gt; is a channel-level element so it's completely
useless in many cases.

Several days ago Lucas characterized those who want to maintain full
copyright control over their works as people engaging
in "victimization."  Now Jay you say they are "whining."  Gentlemen,
why do you denigrate and deride the people on the opposite side of
the debate from you?  I may advocate for any number of ethical,
legal, and political perspectives.  Racism is bad.  Universal
healthcare is good.  Arguing these things, like arguing my right to
ownership of my created content here on this board, does not mean I'm
suffering from victimization or that I'm whining.  And in case you
don't know it, there's no amount of insults you can throw at your
opposition that will make them wrong.  Your opponent in an argument
may be a flatulent fugly booger eater and calling him so may appeal
to the crowd, but it doesn't make him wrong and it doesn't make you
right.

What I don't get about this argument is how the asymmetry isn't
enticing people to one side.  We've got two groups, say "A" and "B."
Operate on the ground rules of group "A" and the desires and wishes
of people in group "B" are permissible.  Everybody's happy.  Operate
on the ground rules of group "B" and the choices of those in
group "A" are no longer allowable.  People are unhappy, specifically
people in group "A."  If everyone respects copyright then people can
limit the use of their material, that's "Group A" and other people
can permit reuse, revlogging, derivative works, etc. by putting their
work in the public domain or attaching the appropriate CC license to
it, that's "Group B."  Respect copyright and everyone's choices are
permissible and everyone is repsected.  If the people in group "B"
force others to operate in a free-for-all, no copyright mashup world
then they have taken the right away from people in group "A" to
choose how their work is used.

By putting content on the internet, some argue, you abrogate your
rights in your work since it's just a click away.  That's not true.
My rights are abrogated when someone else doesn't read my license
terms and doesn't respect them. There is legal precedence for
copyright on the internet.  Remember when "frames" first came out?
People and companies were using frames to subsume the content of
other sites under their banner.  Remember what happened?  Lawsuits
and rulings.  You can't do it.  It's wrong and it's also illegal.
What's going on with videos is similar.  No matter how easy it is to
repost in a networked environment, taking someone else's material for
which you don't have permission is wrong.  And the argument, "it's
going to happen" or "that's the way it is" also doesn't change the
ethical and legal truth.  Here's a joke that will explain it I hope:
One day, a serf turns to another serf and says, "Ivan, why do we take
such abuse from the Czar."  The second serf thinks about it and
says, "Because that's the way it is, that's the way it's always been –
my father, my grandfather, my great-grandfather – we've always
accepted the abuse of the Czar."  Funny joke right?  No, it's a
tragedy.

Hey David-

Please don't take me out of context:
"I see Lucas' argument that its crazy for a vlogger to whine when his video
is posted by another site.
But i think its important that we try to help educate on linking or giving
attributing."

I understand the argument that I cannot stop people from grabbing my videos
once they are online.
To think I can... starts making us sound like the MPAA.
Starts going towards DRM.
Its a dumb loop.

I do not agree with Lucas that all is hopeless.
I simply think I got to be realistic.
I want to get beyond the platitudes.

When I post a video, Im going to assume i'm losing some control over it.
This is why I simply put a Creative Commons Attribution License on my
videos.
I'm fine with people remixing, posting, etc.....as long as they give me
attribution the way I ask.
(for me, its a linkback).

So this is what I want to happen.
But as pioneers here...I'm seeing that what I want to happen, and what will
happen, is not always the same. These aggregator sites are sucking in videos
and run by people with different kinds of motives.
There will be people who just grab my video and say they made it, puts ads
around it, take a dump on it.

So the question for me is...."what am I going to do about it?"
here's my answers right now:

--put the CC license at the end of my videos so it travels where the video
goes.
http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking_work
Add your own custom trailers here.

--Work with this group and Creative Commons to educate aggregator sites.
Here's our working document now:
http://videovertigo.org/information/aggregation/
When a site comes online, we should approach the owners and let them know
the best way to play nice.
They can be dicks about it.....but then they get no community love.

--Educate other videobloggers about using Creative Commons.
We're having a "worldwide" event on April 1:
https://superhappyvloghouse.pbwiki.com/
List your own party....so we can all come together and make video about best
practices...that could be put on Youtube and other places. If we dont
practice what we preach, then there's no good examples to follow.

So this is where I'm at on the issue.
Talk is good....but action is better.

Question for Blip:  Somewhere in my blip profile I told it my itunes
URL is http://www.davidmeade.com/itunes and this is the itunes URL
that is shown on my 'show' page.

Is there some reason my show page doesn't similarly use my feed URL
( http://www.davidmeade.com/feed ) that I've also specified?  If THAT
feed were scooped up and consumed from blip.tv the links sent along
with my video would be pointing back to my website rather than blip -
and I'd at least be getting my attribution.  (I realize there are all
sorts of other dynamic feeds on blip which this wouldn't account for
... but at least the show page could advertise a feed with producer
controlled info in it?)

I'm all about people consuming and sharing my feed where ever they
please ... but I don't think I really like it when they consume and
share other feeds that have my videos in it (because they often don't
link back to me properly).

You're right Jay, action is better than talk alone and your constant
pioneering and educating is admirable and has got to be more
effective than my chatter is on its own.  Sincerely.  Even
recognizing that, I will continue to voice my opinion because it's
what I've got since I don't have your facility for organizing.  And
that's why I get a little snappish when I see verbiage being used to
silence others and I raise my voice to say bullshit.  Sorry if I took
you out of context.

&gt; &gt; What I don't get about this argument is how the asymmetry isn't
&gt; &gt; enticing people to one side. We've got two groups, say &quot;A&quot;
and &quot;B.&quot;
&gt; &gt; Operate on the ground rules of group &quot;A&quot; and the desires and
wishes
&gt; &gt; of people in group &quot;B&quot; are permissible. Everybody's happy. Operate
&gt; &gt; on the ground rules of group &quot;B&quot; and the choices of those in
&gt; &gt; group &quot;A&quot; are no longer allowable. People are unhappy,
specifically
&gt; &gt; people in group &quot;A.&quot; If everyone respects copyright then people
can
&gt; &gt; limit the use of their material, that's &quot;Group A&quot; and other people
&gt; &gt; can permit reuse, revlogging, derivative works, etc. by putting
their
&gt; &gt; work in the public domain or attaching the appropriate CC license
to
&gt; &gt; it, that's &quot;Group B.&quot; Respect copyright and everyone's choices are
&gt; &gt; permissible and everyone is repsected. If the people in group &quot;B&quot;
&gt; &gt; force others to operate in a free-for-all, no copyright mashup
world
&gt; &gt; then they have taken the right away from people in group &quot;A&quot; to
&gt; &gt; choose how their work is used.

&gt; &gt; By putting content on the internet, some argue, you abrogate your
&gt; &gt; rights in your work since it's just a click away. That's not true.
&gt; &gt; My rights are abrogated when someone else doesn't read my license
&gt; &gt; terms and doesn't respect them. There is legal precedence for
&gt; &gt; copyright on the internet. Remember when &quot;frames&quot; first came out?
&gt; &gt; People and companies were using frames to subsume the content of
&gt; &gt; other sites under their banner. Remember what happened? Lawsuits
&gt; &gt; and rulings. You can't do it. It's wrong and it's also illegal.
&gt; &gt; What's going on with videos is similar. No matter how easy it is
to
&gt; &gt; repost in a networked environment, taking someone else's material
for
&gt; &gt; which you don't have permission is wrong. And the argument, &quot;it's
&gt; &gt; going to happen&quot; or &quot;that's the way it is&quot; also doesn't change the
&gt; &gt; ethical and legal truth. Here's a joke that will explain it I
hope:
&gt; &gt; One day, a serf turns to another serf and says, &quot;Ivan, why do we
take
&gt; &gt; such abuse from the Czar.&quot; The second serf thinks about it and
&gt; &gt; says, &quot;Because that's the way it is, that's the way it's always
been –
&gt; &gt; my father, my grandfather, my great-grandfather – we've always
&gt; &gt; accepted the abuse of the Czar.&quot; Funny joke right? No, it's a
&gt; &gt; tragedy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, all of that information is in the feed. It includes the
&gt; &gt; permalink
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the post on blip in the item:link element, and also
includes
&gt; &gt; special
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; metadata that's presently unique to blip for credit. Here's an
&gt; &gt; example
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from a random video I picked on blip:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;blip:user&gt;thatphoneguy&lt;/blip:user&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;blip:show&gt;30 Seconds with Phone Guy&lt;/blip:show&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So that tells the aggregator that the video is from the &quot;30
&gt; &gt; Seconds with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Phone Guy&quot; series, which can be found at
&gt; &gt; http://thatphoneguy.blip.tv/ .
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It even gives the aggregator a picture that can be used to
&gt; &gt; represent the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; series, which can be found at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://blip.tv/uploadedFiles/user_photo_thatphoneguy746.jpg .
&gt; &gt; We'd love
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to use standard elements for these pieces of metadata, but
they
&gt; &gt; don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist yet -- we're including them in our own namespace right
now
&gt; &gt; so that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our formal partners can pick up and use the data for
attribution
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purposes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; okay....so the info is all there if an aggregator site wants to
read
&gt; &gt; &gt; it and provide titles and links.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I see Lucas' argument that its crazy for a vlogger to whine
when his
&gt; &gt; &gt; video is posted by another site. But i think its important that
we
&gt; &gt; try
&gt; &gt; &gt; to help educate on linking or giving attributing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; and as I said recently, im going to start putting a CC license
&gt; &gt; INSIDE
&gt; &gt; &gt; my videos so I dont need to rely on someone's good will.

&gt; &gt; &gt; or Ill use this:
