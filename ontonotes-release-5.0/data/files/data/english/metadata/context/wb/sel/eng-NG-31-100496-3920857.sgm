My thought it is the waterpumpbearing, almost for sure. My 2000 Sporting did
it also now and again. My Fiat-dealer had a look at it and they put some
drops of diesel in  the coolingsystem to grease the pump-bearing (it's not
allowed, but it worked fine!!). If you don't want to do that then you'll
have to take the pump out and repair it, if you can repair it at all these
days. Lots of success!

I have had two squeeky water pumps on different cars, the first was
fixed by loosening the drive belt.  It was too tight and this put a
strain on the pump bearings.  Check the manufacturers specs first as if
it's too loose it'll come off.
The other was fixed by a bottle of Holts somthing or other, it
lubricated the bearings and had a slightly greasy residue.  It did what
it said on the bottle and quietened down the pump.

How is a water pump going to squeak when the engine is turned off?
I'd be looking for any lost pets, has your daughter left the cage door open
and lost a mouse?
