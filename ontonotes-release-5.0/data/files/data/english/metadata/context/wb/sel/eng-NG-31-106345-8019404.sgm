Curbing cart theft
Laws, vigilance, high-tech devices all help

Shopping carts aren't the pushovers that they used to be.

For decades, shopping basket theft has bedeviled stores, cities and
citizens. But now merchants are marshaling high tech systems and old-
fashioned vigilance to keep carts corralled.

Six years ago in Sacramento about 2,000 shopping carts littered the
streets and alleys on any given day. The problem was so pervasive that
city staff took about 45 calls each week from angry residents
reporting the blight.

&quot;It seemed like there were carts on every corner,&quot; said Bob Rose,
Sacramento's chief code enforcer. &quot;We couldn't keep up.&quot;

Today, Sacramento officials get between six and seven cart complaint
calls each week, Rose said.

Although state law already made shopping cart theft a misdemeanor, a
2002 ordinance requires merchants with 50 or more carts to submit an
&quot;abandoned cart prevention plan&quot; for approval. And stores that don't
pick up their abandoned carts get dinged with a $50 fine for repeat
offenses.

&quot;Sure, you can find a cart in the city on any given day if you look
hard enough,&quot; Rose said, &quot;but based on volume of complaints, we're in
pretty good shape.&quot;

While get-tough ordinances in Sacramento and elsewhere have helped
merchants focus on shopping cart theft, that's only part of the story.

Grocery stores in particular have been sensitive to the problem for
many years.

&quot;Although a lot of retailers use shopping carts, people tend to talk
about them in the context of the grocery industry,&quot; said Tim James of
the Sacramento-based California Grocers Association. &quot;That's because
it's pretty easy to walk into Best Buy, spend $100 and not need a
shopping cart. It's pretty hard to spend a $100 at a grocery store
without one.&quot;

A grocer loses more than its reputation when its carts litter a
neighborhood.

The basic shopping basket costs up to $150, roughly equal to the after-
tax profit margin of about $10,000 in grocery sales, according to NDP
figures.

Grocery stores invest thousands of dollars to purchase their carts and
maintain them. West Sacramento-based Raley's, the Sacramento region's
biggest grocery seller, and its Bel Air and Food Source units keep up
to 250 carts at each of its 139 stores in Northern California and
Nevada. So do the area's other top grocers, Safeway Inc. and Save Mart
Supermarkets.

None would talk specifically about how many carts they lose to theft,
but all have several strategies to combat it.

Nearly every supermarket hires a service that hauls in carts from
surrounding neighborhoods. They also employ parking lot security staff
to keep an eye out for wayward carts. And store employees routinely
lug large orders to their customers' cars as a courtesy -- and as a
way to make sure that the cart comes back.

Many stores have gone high-tech to keep a grip on their property with
anti-theft protection systems analogous to the wireless fences that
some dog owners use to keep their pets from wandering away.

One system produced by Carlsbad-based Carttronics LLC outfits a
shopping cart's front caster with a radio wave receiver and a
retractable boot. A transmitter in the store sends a low-frequency
signal through an antenna wire buried around the edge of the store
property.

When a cart crosses the boundary, the wire signals the receiver to
release the boot, making it difficult to roll the cart farther.

The system costs about $20,000 to install, said Carttronics marketing
director Rick Sylvester. The firm earns about $20 million annually and
counts about 2,000 stores worldwide as clientele, including Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., Safeway and Longs Drug Stores Inc.

Raley's uses the Carttronics system at 20 of its 139 stores, Johnston
said, including markets in West Sacramento and on Freeport Boulevard
in Sacramento. &quot;We used it at stores where we had more incidents (of
cart theft),&quot; Johnston said. &quot;It really works.&quot;

Sacramento code enforcer Rose said that he wishes more stores used the
Carttronics system.

&quot;We're all for that system,&quot; he said. &quot;Safeway on Alhambra had a
really bad problem. Then they got that system, and the problem has
basically gone away.&quot;

There is a supermarket in my city that got written up the
newspaper for having that system.  It is an inner-city location,
without a carpark, so the radio-brake thingy is in the doorway,
before you get out on the sidewalk.

They had an incident in which it was really a full trolly load of
groceries that was being stolen.  So the thieves were jolted to a
stop as they were running through the door with the trolly.  They
left the scene, but also left the goods behind.

Actually, according to stories I have seen in the papers, and from anecdotal
personal observation, the homeless are seldom the direct thieves of the
carts. Think about it- where is a homeless person gonna STORE enough food to
need a cart in first place? And most homeless do not push shopping carts-
that is a very localized urban thing. Abandoned carts usually show up in
clusters near the closest group of houses occupied by low income or other
non-driving people. It is primarily an urban and semi-urban phenomena.
People without cars, and who don't happen to live on bus line, and can't
afford cabs, walk to closest grocery, buy their food, push it all the way
home, and leave the cart by the street. I don't think it thuggish, just
ignorance and an inflated sense of entitlement. Some of the people actually
think taking the carts, and the old guy or kid with the pickup truck that
comes after them, is a perk of shopping there, and they as well use it
'since they are paying for it anyway'. After a few weeks, a cart-hunter
learns the regular locations they are dumped, and heads by there first.

On a trip to northern Europe a couple years ago, they were just starting to
roll out western-style supermarkets. They have adopted what I understand is
a British (or was it Norwegian?) custom of chaining the carts together with
a little tether, that you unlock by putting in a coin worth about half a
buck.  You get the coin back by re-tethering the cart in the stack and
chaining it up. Kids would run around the lot offering to return carts up
front in exchange for the coin. Old fat people accepted, suprisingly often.
I remember in a previous thread on here, that some east coast US cities were
rolling out this system, which seems much more practical than electric
hi-tech wheel locks. It also beats what I saw on my last urban east coast
trip a few years back- posts in a circle near the door, like a swimming area
barricade, that kept the carts confined. That means you don't buy more than
you can lug (in bags) to the car, or depend on a stranger to watch cart, or
take somebody with you when shopping. Here in this town, in the groceries
near the 'projects', they have hired retired  guys as porters to help people
load their cars, and watch the lot for walkaways, which they challenge.

Some stores install closely-spaced poles that people can walk between
but are too close together for the carts to go through.

What makes you think it's homeless people? I see lots of people
bringing home their groceries in the carts, and then simply leaving
the carts in the street near their houses.

You can also find custers of abandoned carts near bus stops. People
push their carts to the bus stop, then grab their bags and board the
bus, leaving the cart sitting there right next to the shelter.

There is an 800 number that you can call to report an abandoned cart

The Wal-Mart in Mountain View uses the Cartronics system. The problem is
that the store is part of a larger shopping center, but the perimeter
line for the carts is very narrow. If I park near Trader Joe's, which is
right by Wal-Mart's garden center entrance (which usually has the short
checkout lines), the cart locks up about 100' from the car.

The abandoned cart problem is easily solved by the merchant at a
relatively low cost. I don't think anyone wants the police spending time
arresting people that remove carts from the store's parking lot.

Some grocery stores do contribute to the problem by closing stores in
low-income areas, even when the stores are profitable, so customers end
up having to go long distances with their groceries.

Do you lock your car doors when you leave it? Do you leave your keys
in the ignition? Do you leave your engine running? Do you leave CDs
and other valuables inside the car in plain sight? If some asshole
steals your CDs or even your car, do you bear any responsibility for
not trying to protect your property? Your insurance company sure
thinks so - they won't pay your claim if they find out that you left
your doors unlocked and your keys in the ignition with the engine
running.

Bottom line, if you don't take reasonable precautions to prevent loss
(or, in the case of the abandoned shopping carts, to prevent your
property from becoming a public nuisance) then you are partially
responsible when such losses or nuisances occur.

Yep. Charging a deposit for the cart and refunding it when the cart is

I have encountered cops who were VERY close to that attitude.

After all, complaining about a crime (or generally threatening
behaviour) means taking up time and attention.  Which the cops
would rather devote to eating doughnuts and surfing pr0n.  Which
puts them in a rather negative frame of mind towards the
complainant.

&gt; What makes you think it's homeless people? I see lots of people
&gt; bringing home their groceries in the carts, and then simply leaving
&gt; the carts in the street near their houses.
">

Yeah, I should have mentioned it.  I see that in my street, too.

But my point was, by the time someone notices (and complains
about) an abandoned shopping cart... The Perp Is Gone.  S/he
cannot be identified.  But the legitimate owner of the cart is
printed right there on the handle.

So, what if you are a city bureaucrat, wanting to pull in some
money, and to look like you are &quot;Doing Something&quot; about the
problem?  You go after the party whom you CAN go after.

No, of course not.  However, a shopping cart theft law can be
used as an excuse to hassle random homeless people.

Some skanky bum is walking down the street.  But not really
giving Proable Cause to be stopped.  But still looking bad to the
upscale merchants, tourists, or residents.

But, lookie here... S/he is pushing a Safeway cart.

That gives the excuse to go over and jack him/her up, demanding
ID, threatening an arrest, saying, &quot;We better not see you around
here again,&quot; etc, etc.

Which has nothing to do with helping the supermarket reduce cart
theft.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Some grocery stores do contribute to the problem by closing stores in
&gt; low-income areas, even when the stores are profitable, so customers end
&gt; up having to go long distances with their groceries.
">

If the stores were profitable overall, they wouldn't be getting
closed, unless there were other serious hassles that outweighed
those profits.

And it isn't a supermarket's fault that you live 30 blocks away,
while viewing cart theft as a better idea than taking the bus
with two or three bag increments.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Although state law already made shopping cart theft a misdemeanor, a

&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;abandoned cart prevention plan&quot; for approval. And stores that don't

&gt; &gt;&gt; Here's the real problem, blaming the merchant for the thugs that steal
&gt; &gt;&gt; the carts in the first place.  How ass-backwards is that?
&gt; &gt; Easier than trying to fine the homeless people who steal the
&gt; &gt; carts, and then later abandon them.
&gt; Actually, according to stories I have seen in the papers, and from anecdotal
&gt; personal observation, the homeless are seldom the direct thieves of the
&gt; carts. Think about it- where is a homeless person gonna STORE enough food to
&gt; need a cart in first place?
">

I never said that the homeless people steal the carts to
transport food.  They will grab them from the carpark, without
even going into the supermarket.

Often, they just use it to hold all of their worldly belongings.
Some folks (including non-homeless) use the carts for scavenging
large quantities of cans and bottles for recycling.  Some of the
nuttier ones even seem to just collect heaps of sorted rubbish to
haul around.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And most homeless do not push shopping carts- that is
&gt; a very localized urban thing. Abandoned carts usually show up in
&gt; clusters near the closest group of houses occupied by low income or other
&gt; non-driving people.
">

Well, I will agree that that is the situation in my immediate
area.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It is primarily an urban and semi-urban phenomena.
&gt; People without cars, and who don't happen to live on bus line, and can't
&gt; afford cabs, walk to closest grocery, buy their food, push it all the way
&gt; home, and leave the cart by the street. I don't think it thuggish, just
&gt; ignorance and an inflated sense of entitlement. Some of the people actually
&gt; think taking the carts, and the old guy or kid with the pickup truck that
&gt; comes after them, is a perk of shopping there, and they as well use it
&gt; 'since they are paying for it anyway'. After a few weeks, a cart-hunter
&gt; learns the regular locations they are dumped, and heads by there first.

&gt; On a trip to northern Europe a couple years ago, they were just starting to
&gt; roll out western-style supermarkets. They have adopted what I understand is
&gt; a British (or was it Norwegian?) custom of chaining the carts together with
&gt; a little tether, that you unlock by putting in a coin worth about half a
&gt; buck.  You get the coin back by re-tethering the cart in the stack and
&gt; chaining it up.
">

Northern California Safeway stores were doing that in
the mid-90s.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Kids would run around the lot offering to return carts up
&gt; front in exchange for the coin.
">

Some airports have had that system for a long time.  And people
would go there and spend a few hours &quot;hustling carts&quot; just like
that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Old fat people accepted, suprisingly often.
">

I don't find that surprising at all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I remember in a previous thread on here, that some east coast US cities were
&gt; rolling out this system, which seems much more practical than electric
&gt; hi-tech wheel locks. It also beats what I saw on my last urban east coast
&gt; trip a few years back- posts in a circle near the door, like a swimming area
&gt; barricade, that kept the carts confined. That means you don't buy more than
&gt; you can lug (in bags) to the car, or depend on a stranger to watch cart, or
&gt; take somebody with you when shopping. Here in this town, in the groceries
&gt; near the 'projects', they have hired retired  guys as porters to help people
&gt; load their cars, and watch the lot for walkaways, which they challenge.
">

Well, I live within walking distance of a supermarket.  Although,
of course, some other people wouldn't view it that way.  Since
they either can't, or more often WON'T, walk more than the
distance between their parking space and their door.

&gt; Do you lock your car doors when you leave it? Do you leave your keys

&gt; and other valuables inside the car in plain sight? If some asshole
&gt; steals your CDs or even your car, do you bear any responsibility for
&gt; not trying to protect your property?
">

The example I like best is... when those thieves stole &quot;your&quot; personal
information from Choicepoint, did the common man hold Choicepoint
responsible? (And yes, that data was Choicepoint's property, like it or
not.)

Damn right they did. And rightfully so. Your negligence with your property
is your problem until the effects start inconveniencing me.

And that's even better than the insurance example. After all, the insurancy
policyholder agreed as part of the deal that the insurer would not be liable
for claims arising from unreasonable carelessness on the part of the
policyholder. Choicepoint never signed any agreement with you to protect
&quot;your&quot; personal data.

Pish Posh. The locking system I sell has handcuffs that automatically
retract from the handle and lock
around the wrist in a split second. It has motorized wheels that
'drives' the thief to the police station,
and it pepper sprays the thief and shocks him or her if he or she
tries to get away or screams.

This is the typical moronic 'let's fix the symptom' without fixing

many of our esteemed politicians have gone by for far too long.

One way to do that is to not allow the gov't to tear apart the social
safety net. The second force those
asshole developers who want to build expensive condo after condo to
make x number of units
affordable housing. Also, having decent jobs, reasonable rents, and
stopping the trend of outsourcing or hiring illegals/H1B workers would
go a very long way in reducing the number of homeless on the streets.

This won't do shit, and it's only perpetuating the very societal
attitudes you speak of. Remember, cities
usually come up short with the number of beds available vs the number

Nope, you still get 'homeless' even when you go that route.

Some western european countrys have tried that.

Doesnt work either, some western european countrys have tried that
too and they still have 'homeless', essentially because the absolute
vast bulk of them arent 'homeless' due to the lack of affordable housing.

Fantasy. The absolute vast bulk of them are the loonys we used to keep in locked wards.

The rest are druggys that prefer to 'live' like that and
even legalisation of all drugs wouldnt change that.

And those that fix that problem STILL have lots of 'homeless', essentially because
they are mostly the loonys we used to keep in locked wards and druggys.

Even making them take their meds doesnt fix the problem.

You're still attacking symptoms.

The root cause is that a certain subset of the population frankly aren't
worth the air they breath in terms of what they produce. (And that is an
unsolvable problem, given our societal attitudes.)

The symptoms are that the rest of us have some of our assets stolen from us
in order to give to these non-producers.

Your solutions won't fly because in the end, voters prefer this solution:

- Let the homeless sleep on public sidewalks that we would build anyway.

over

- Paying higher taxes to give handouts to those who didn't earn it.
- Accepting restrictions on how we invest OUR money on building projects.
- Being forced to entrust important jobs to someone whose proven themselves
unable to complete in an unfettered labor market.

And we live with the existing solution because voters won't accept the
following solution:

- Become Klingons and cull the weak and non-producing from the population.

On the other hand, there is the concept of &quot;Moral Hazard.&quot;  Which
means that, if you provide a safety net, then people may tend to
act in a more sloppy and reckless manner.

I have met people whose safety net was their mommy and daddy.  Or
their &quot;friends&quot; whom they expected to USE any time the chips were
down.  Including due to their own laziness and negligence.

And they were quite eager to claim things like, &quot;Oh, I wouldn't
do THAT job, cuz it is too difficult.&quot;  And so forth.

So, how would you feel about a gubmint mandate requiring YOU to
provide a certain percentage of &quot;affordable&quot; labour?  Meaning
that, part of your job would pay you market rates.  While some of
your work hours would be at a reduced wage?  You know, to be
&quot;affordable&quot; to your employer, and customers?

&gt; Also, having decent jobs,

If my sewer drain is clogged by a tree root, do I also have some
obligation to provide the plumber with a nicer, cleaner task?

If I am running a construction company, do I also have some
obligation to offer ALL of the workers a nice, clean, safe
position as a receptionist?  For the same pay?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Can I come live in YOUR property for an amount that I consider
&quot;reasonable&quot;?  How about five bucks a week?

That is the one point where I agree with you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Remember, cities
&gt; usually come up short with the number of beds available vs the

And what about the homeless who *want* a bed were they can just
lay around all day, doing booze or dope?  While someone else
supports them?  Or the mentally ill ones, who can't do much more
than lay around?

If you haven't personally encountered any of the above types,
then you might consider whether you really have sufficient
understanding to make judgements on this.

(Whoa, I actually restrained myself from using any language like,
&quot;Talking out of your arse.&quot;  I'm so proud of myself...)
