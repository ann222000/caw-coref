I checked all of our treats last night after Hills announced they used the
same wheat gluten supplier for that prescription cat food.  Damned if all
but one brand doesn't contain wheat gluten, including 2 boxes of Nutro
treats.  Some of them are the small, soft training treats, and some are
hard biscuits.  They are all in the trash now and I'm trying to remain
calm.  I'm just going to avoid all wheat and wheat gluten, but is that
enough?

What's really scary to me is that the FDA is saying the level of melamine
found in the food doesn't explain the symptoms they are seeing in pets who
consumed it.

Tip of the iceberg?

Here's what I don't understand:  Why aren't more dogs and cats sick?  I
know that sounds horribly callous so let me explain myself before
everyone jumps down my throat.  The recall was/is huge.  The number of
pets exposed to possibly tainted pet food has to be huge.  Yet I'm

at the numbers, it seems like there should be more.  In my neighborhood,
all the dogs and cats are fine.  You have reports of veterinarians
working overtime testing animals, but they're all fine.  It doesn't seem
possible that the food isn't really tainted since some animals have died
from poisoning.  What explains the fact that so many exposed animals
haven't gotten sick?

We don't know how many animals have gotten sick or died yet.  I've heard
that in some areas vets have seen a dramatic rise in acute kidney
failure over the past 2+ months, so maybe the tainted foods were
distributed to some areas and not others?

1) We don't know how many dogs and cats are sick;

2) we don't know how much tainted food was produced by Menu
Foods; and

3) we don't know how much of the tainted food was sold
before being pulled off the shelves

I was at the feed store this morning and I asked them if
they'd been affected by the hullaballoo, and they said while
they'd gotten a lot of questions their stock hadn't been
affected because they sell very little of that shit to start
with and the little bit they did have hadn't been
manufactured during the dates in which the tainted whatever
was included in the food.

Someone on one of the mushing lists said that she'd
dissolved some cheap kibble in water and strained it and was
appalled by what was in there (bone, feather, beak) and did
the same thing with some "premium" kibble and was pleased by
what she found.  I haven't tried it and don't know whether
or not she was exaggerating but it sounds like an
interesting thing to do.  Crap like bones and feather and
beak oughtn't to make your dog sick but they don't provide
much in the way of nutrition, either.

What numbers are you basing this on? The "official" count, which is
really just the animals in Menu's feeding test? The Banfield numbers,
who have hundreds of cases, and project a number of several thousand
nationwide based on their own numbers? The numbers from the Veterinary
Information Network--who say that only 10-20% of their members have
reported in, but nevertheless they have reports of 1,000 sick animals,
and project that it could easily be ten times that? The Pet Connection
numbers?

There may not have been the same amount of contaminant in every can or
pouch. Given the way things normally work in manufacturing, there
probably wasn't an abrupt shift, on the manufacturing end, from wheat
gluten from one supplier to wheat gluten from another supplier.
Animals will have had different amounts of the tainted food--anything
from all their meals to little treats. And they'll have had different
levels of sensitivity. Some animals ate the food, eagerly or
reluctantly. Some refused it after a few bites, some refused it based
on smell alone. And different people will have had different reactions
to a pet suddenly refusing its food for no reason apparent to the
human, up to and including the Canadian woman who ate some of it
herself to encourage her dog to eat it. (It worked, and they're both
seriously ill.)

And, again, we really don't know what the numbers are. Lots of vets
are working overtime testing lots of animals--and a lot of them are
fine, but a lot of them aren't. There are a lot of very sick or dead
pets out there.

One thing to keep in mind is that there is a reason that these numbers
are so different. Tying a death conclusively to the food is going to be
very difficult, even if you can confirm with certainty that the animal
was on the food.

The increase in observed kidney cases could easily be due to simply an
increase in looking for problems. People are worried about their
animals, so they bring their dog/cat in for a blood test. Guess what?
Some of them will have kidney problems. These are going to cause quite a
bit of statistical noise in whatever numbers you are looking at.

Yeah, I've been focusing on Purina's dry products, because that's all
we use here.

This unnamed supplier of bad "stuff" from China is apparently a U.S.

non-release of its name - before all the test results are in.

Yes, it could be something else altogether (although somewhat

Tragic results for some aside, this episode should likely result in
higher standards, more testing, etc. for dog and cat foods generally.

I just hope that we get to the bottom of this pretty soon.

Good points. Also, remember that there will be a lot of people who had
really sick pets last year who survived who will never report in.

As an example, I was feeding Zip the Min Pin some of the Nutro slices
and gravy stuff last year as a topper to get him to eat. He got quite
ill several times, and I remember clearly at least one of those times he
was drinking excessive water. I took him to the vet two different times,
and each time we looked at stool sample, not kidney levels. Because
poisoning just isn't what you look for--prior to this kidney failure in
dogs just wasn't something that cropped up every day.

Now in my case I happened to get really lucky. He didn't die. He
recovered, and a kidney function, liver function, and full CBC last
weekend said he was completely normal. I dodged a huge bullet.

But I wonder how many dogs there are out there like Zipper, who had the
food a few times and didn't get fatally sick, and with the owner not
feeding the food continuously or as the main ingredient, the owner just
doesn't connect the dots?

I've fed Eukanuba PP very successfully for 8 years and have been
extremely pleased with it. And nothing I was feeding from Euk was
tainted, but the whole thing has made me realize I want a bit better
control over the substances in my dog food, so this week I moved to
Innova Evo.

I'm sure the owners know what they were eating.  Are you a lawyer for
Menu Foods?

Now that the FDA has determined that the tainted wheat gluten contains
melamine, it can potentially be used as a marker to determine if animals
have consumed the affected food.  Unfortunately, there is no way of
looking for malamine in animals who have already died and been cremated
or buried (maybe?).  I also wonder how long it is excreted in the urine
and present in tissue and therefore just how useful of a marker it will
be for animals who were sick and are recovering and who are no longer
eating the poison food...

As an aside, from everything I have read, melamine probably is NOT the
cause of the kidney problems.  If that's true, there's got to be
something else, yet to be identified.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm not saying its not caused by the food, but just trying to point

Of course there are other possibilities, but the reports I read about
"dramatic increases in kidney failure" in young animals are pretty
friggen suspicious...  It's not like any of those cases are going to be
able to be tied to the food anyway, so what's your point?

I feel horrible for people whose pets died suddenly from renal failure
and will never know if it's because of the food they fed them.

this is my biggest concern, too. i don't use any of the affected
products and i wouldn't use them, so it's all, sort of, a side note.
but at the same time, i do use innova's food, and their canned
products are manufactured by menu foods. they weren't affected because
they don't use wheat gluten, but who's to say they wouldn't have been
if it had been another ingredient.

blame is being put on purchasing the wheat from china, but who's to
say that it couldn't happen with an ingredient purchased here. (do we
know where the affected corn from the diamond aflatoxin problem came
from?)

then i think, i could go back to raw, but that's no guarantee, either,
because the only way i can afford to feed raw is to purchase from big
grocery store chains.

so i guess i just keep feeding the food that i'm feeding and have been
feeding, and keep my eyes open and my fingers crossed that it won't be
my pets affected next time.

Two reasons, mostly.  One, I've had nothing but great experience with
their feed products (going back 40+ years), especially Pro-Plan.  Two,
Purina is not the kind of company (i.e., it's a very conscientious
company) that would put a few cents more profit ahead of the welfare
of dogs and the reputation of their company. They've just got too much
goodwill invested in the dog community. They're not a stupid, greedy
company.

Originally, they were a St. Louis company (part of Ralston Purina)
before being sold to Nestles), and I know more than a few of their
executives and top managers. Their technology center in Gray's Summit
(Purina Farms) is still not far from my place (although its moving to
St. Joseph later this year).  Nestles was smart enough to retain
almost all of the old management team. And I know how hard they work
at testing and developing their feed products; I've visited one of
their plants, etc.  They're just good folks, in my opinion.

So I put a lot of stock in things like that.  I suppose I could be
dead wrong about them, but they've never, ever given me a reason not
to trust them.

No.  They don't only use US products.  Purina used the same supplier as
Menu Foods for wheat gluten in Alpo (see their website).  The reason I
think you can feel comfortable with Purina at this point--for this recent
problem--is because Purina now knows who the supplier of the bad wheat
gluten is and they recalled the Alpo today.  *I am speculating* that they
would have had additional recalls today if they had used the bad product
in any other foods.

However, I still think it would be prudent to discontinue the use of any
foods (or treats) containing wheat gluten, from any manufacturer, until
the scope of this thing is better understood.

You'd be surprised. That's one of the standard questions clients get at
their pets annual health review at the clinic I'm at. Most can't answer
the specific formulation their pet is on. Then there are the multitude
of pets who aren't on a particular diet for more than a bag at a time.
One week its this food, next week its another. My neighbor feeds her dog
whatever is cheapest at Superstore.
My parents feed our cat what ever wet food they pick up, on a package by
package basis (I only feed the cat one brand, and try to discourage
mucking with his diet, but he's not my cat...). I doubt anyone could
name the brand of wet food he ate last week.

If his kidneys were to give out though, I'm sure I'd look over the list

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As an aside, from everything I have read, melamine probably is NOT the
&gt; cause of the kidney problems.  If that's true, there's got to be
&gt; something else, yet to be identified.

&gt;&gt; I'm not saying its not caused by the food, but just trying to point
&gt;&gt; out that there are other possibilities.

&gt; Of course there are other possibilities, but the reports I read about
&gt; &quot;dramatic increases in kidney failure&quot; in young animals are pretty
&gt; friggen suspicious...  It's not like any of those cases are going to be
&gt; able to be tied to the food anyway, so what's your point?
">

My point is that the numbers *may* not be as bad as some groups are
making them out to be. There are many things which would cause them to
look worse than they really are, and there are definitely people
interested in making them look as bad as possible.

questions you are asking that you've done no research into this issue.  If

That's encouraging, and a good example of what people want to hear
from their pet food company.  Though what that *means* is sort of
nebulous.  Could an on-site inspector have prevented this whole
mess in the first place?

I'm conflicted about what to do next.  Harriet is on toward the end
of her food.  I don't think it's going to be added to the list of
suspect foods, because it's kibble and it has no wheat of any sort
in it.  But, still, I'm concerned, and am seriously considering
moving back to Canidae or California Natural.

(Right now, I'm waiting until it's a decent hour to call a night
owl friend of mine and inform her of the Del Monte recall.  She
feeds her cats those damned Pounce treats, and I'd hate it if one
of them got sick.  I'm giving her until 11am, then I'm calling and
waking her lazy ass up.)

Food choices seem to have never been more important, eh?  I had been
feeding BRAVO raw to all 3 dogs, but I'm going broke feeding it.  I
decided to try them all on Evo and see how it goes.  So far, so good,
but I have to watch Lucy's waistline.  She'll go back on raw if she
doesn't handle the Evo well.

The cats eat canned Wellness and Solid Gold, and that appears to be fine
for now.  They also get some dry Evo.  They were getting Trader Joe's
canned foods, but TJ's has pulled them for now, so I returned what I had.

The cats would prefer to eat roasted chicken every night, which often
seems like not such a bad idea - cost is good and they adore it,
especially Carey, who doesn't eat a lot otherwise - I think she could
down a whole chicken.

So would Pan, though she couldn't actually, you know, *chew* it up
or anything.  She swears she could manage, though.

The little brat got up on the stove last night, while I was stir

pan!  Brazen little shit.  She nearly got away with it, too, right
under my nose.  I don't know if she's lost her mind, or what, but
what on earth does she think she's going to do with a pea pod?
Lick it to death?

I don't know what you mean by "bad press." IMO, Purina's press has
been pretty good overall.  They've certainly been open and
forthcoming.

Plus, I'm much more distrustful of the press than I am of Purina.

And if I had to choose between believing the FDA or believing Purina,
I'd believe Purina.

Tip: Paranoia never helps.

I agree.

And "the supplier" is probably going to end up the main culprit in
this fiasco.

&gt;&gt; Yes, it could be something else altogether (although somewhat

&gt;&gt;&gt;Ditto here.  Hence the pile of treats in the trash.

Facts are good.  But proper use of those facts is even better.

However, I see a lot of misuse (and abuse) of the facts.

For example, using them to suggest that dog food companies are all bad
bad bad.  That feeding kibble is bad bad bad. That feeding canned food
is bad bad bad. That feeding raw is better better better. Etc.

Humans are capable of doing some remarkably stupid things when they
panic.
