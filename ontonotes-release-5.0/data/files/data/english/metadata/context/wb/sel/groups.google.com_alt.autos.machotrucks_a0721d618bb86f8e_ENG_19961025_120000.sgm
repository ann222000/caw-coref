I was just wondering if I could replace the rear differential in my '86
S-10 Blazer 2WD auto so it won't be so bad in the rain or snow. I am
wondering if companies make locking differential for my vehicle. I have
seen some ads in mags for difs. &quot;that will make a 4x2 as god as a 4x4&quot;. Any
comments or advice?

&gt; Jug1. Yes, companies do make locking differentials for your vehicle, most

"/> pick-up or 4 wheel drive magazines have ads for ARB air-lockers or the
old standby the detroit locker.

2. In one manner of speaking a locker on a 4x2 will be as good as a
4x4, IF the 4x4 has open differentials. A 4x4 with open diff's are still
driving only two wheels one in front and one in back. If, however, the
4x4 has lockers also then each axle with lockers will be driving both
wheels.

3. Comments: I have a 4x2 long bed pick-up with a locker in the rear
axle and live in snow and ice country. I have not had to &quot;chain up&quot; yet.
In one instance I was pulling a boat and had to make an uphill, right
hander from a stop on snow and ice and had no problems at all. I have
found lockers to be superior to &quot;Positraction&quot; or &quot;limited slip &quot; types
for this application. The limited slip types can cause fish tailing as
the traction available to each wheel changes and the various plates and
clutches cant decide which wheel gets the traction.

"/> I always buy my vehicles with a limited slip rear end. Mainly because
in the days of manual locking front hubs, I hated to get out and lock
in the hubs, every time I needed to pull out from a stop sign in snowy
weather. And then have to pull off the highway a short time later and
back up a few feet to get the front end to disengage so it would stop
vibrating.

A limited slip rear axle should be standard on any truck (because of the
light rear end). They can be installed. There are several brands
available. None as cheap as the option from the factory would have
been.

&gt; You cannot make your 2wd pickup as good as 4wd, no matter what anyone
&gt; tells you. You can add a limited-slip rear diff and that will help
&gt; when at least one wheel can get traction. I wouldn't get a full

"/> Why not, I have been using a detroit locker for 3 years now in snow and
ice and found it far superior to &quot;limited slip&quot; types that I have used
in the past. Any 4x4 with open diffs (and many of them come that way)
will still only drive 2 wheels in poor traction situations. The person
who asked the original question is enquiring about normal winter
driving, not the Rubicon in February. The benefit of driving one front
wheel on the street is dubious at least, especially on the limited slip
types decide to power the same side of both axles. With a detroit locker
or an ARB air locker, when the axle is locked both driving wheels get
equal torque. Most articles in 4x4 and pick-up magazines corraborate the
value of lockers or air lockers over the various limited slip types.
Note that a detroit or ARB locker is not the same as a rear axle locked
by using a &quot;spool&quot; or welding the spiders (bad move). A detroit or ARB
will release the axle in good traction situations and perform like a
normal open diff. In poor traction however the sprags in the Detroit
will lock up the axles (the air solenoid in an ARB accomplishes the same
thing only it does so on the drivers demand with a switch).

Yes there are situations where a 4x4, even with open diffs, will never
be surpassed by a 4x2 with a locker. This has not proven to be the case
in normal hiway driving.

"/> Due to the ditches and culverts of life the first sentence is correct.
Sentence two is correct and leaves out lockers like Detoit which do
work great, but when conditions warrant you have to *DRIVE* the
vehicle. Sentence three seems to be a cost-for-value judgement.
If you are driving in heavy snow a locker (driver controlled) is
the very best choice IMO.

auto locker like Detroit or Lockright. Fishtailing rules.

Btw: I once read a thread about the front knuckles of many US cars not being
the CV-joint type, unlike each and every TLC. If that is not your problem,
then you might consider rebalancing your front drive shaft.

"/> Your comments are quite true. I was trying to give a short and not
necessarily precise description. Also your description of how a locker
allows different axle speeds in a turn is also correct. However, my
point was that it is a mechanical system of pawls, sprags, whatever
descriptive word you which to use describing a spring loaded, pin or key
fitting into a machined notch&quot; overrunning clutch that causes the
locking action as opposed to the slipping clutch plate or cone
arrangement used in most &quot;limited slip&quot; diffs. In fact, it is that
re-engaging of the locking action upon exiting a sharp turn under light
load the creates the &quot;Oh My God, the differential just exploded and left
$400 worth of parts on the road&quot; sound that scares locker &quot;newbies&quot; half
to death until someone tells them that is a normal charateristic. I
understand the relatively new &quot;soft&quot; locker no longer blesses us with
that experience.

"/> I will say this one more time. Mr Soo is correct, the default mode for a
locker is locked. it unlocks the outboard wheel for a turn unless you
are doing the grand national, throttle on, lets impress the ladies bit.
(most of the time they are NOT impressed, took me a long time to figure
that out). If you are using that driving style in the snow then natural
selection takes over regardless of how your vehicle in equipped. If
your dont use an educated throttle foot in poor traction I dont care
what you are driving, you are gonna eat snow. (In the past 30+ years I
have seen MANY 4x4's in a ditch during a snowstorm whether equipped with
open diffs, lockers, or limited slip. It seems than many think
four-wheel drive equates with invincibility. Some are embarrased to be
&quot;rescued&quot; by a two-wheel drive pick-up, most are grateful however.)

In my attempts to simplify the explanation I got off on a tangent and
displayed the ubiquitous &quot;Brain Fart&quot;. That in no wise has anything to
do with the relative safety of lockers as stated by myself and others.
Including cars and trucks originally equipped with lockers from the
factory. Whereas some people find the idea of a locker in a turn on snow
or ice scary, I find it much more scary to drive a vehicle with a diff
that may change its mind in the middle of a turn.

&quot;Are you all set up for the turn Mr. driver, is your steering and
throttle input optimized for the outboard wheel? Good, because I have
just decided that the outboard wheel is no good so I am tranferring your
torque to the inboard wheel. To bad if you're not ready for it. Oh,
excuse me, did the sudden application of torque to the inboard wheel
cause it to start slipping, no problem, now that you have just started
to compensate for the shift in torque, I'm going to shift it back to the
OUTBOARD wheel again..NO...WAIT, now IT&quot;S slipping. Well I'll tell you
what, I'll just keep switching from wheel to wheel and if you can't keep
up it's YOUR problem, I am doing what I was designed to do.&quot;

I have been behind a limited slip equipped vehicle and seen just that
scenario take place. Sure, you can get into trouble with a locker but
the difference is, the locker is consistent in its reaction and you can
learn to compensate. With a limited slip YOU are not controlling the
action, the clutches or cones are, and what's even worse is that their
response will change due to factors that often aren't detectable to a
driver. That doesn't mean I am dead against limited slips. I still think
they are superior to open diffs and if the only choice was open or
limited slip I would take the limited slip every time. But the locker
doesn't deserve the bad rap you're giving it.

with automatic full engagement, and you have a rather unpredictable setup,
especially in a 2wd. In a 4wd you will engage the front axle in bad
conditions, making the effect of the rear axle locking less noticeable.

Jug,

IMHO, limited slip and locking differential will make forward traction only
slightly better at the price of losing lateral (side to side) traction much
worse; when those rear wheels start to spin you lose lateral stability, you
will probably spin out into a ditch or across lanes.

If I were you I would concentrate on getting the best studded snow tires
available, and I would ABSOLUTELY NOT put in limited slip or locking
differentials. Learn about driving in the snow. I know that sounds
snotty but there are things to know about it.

&gt; Jug,

&gt; IMHO, limited slip and locking differential will make forward traction only
&gt; slightly better at the price of losing lateral (side to side) traction much
&gt; worse; when those rear wheels start to spin you lose lateral stability, you
&gt; will probably spin out into a ditch or across lanes.

&gt; If I were you I would concentrate on getting the best studded snow tires
&gt; available, and I would ABSOLUTELY NOT put in limited slip or locking
&gt; differentials. Learn about driving in the snow. I know that sounds
&gt; snotty but there are things to know about it.

handling ones, in the rian and snow, were equipped with LS diffs.

"/> I've got to agree with Chainsaw. Forget the studs, get good all-
season radials and a limited-slip. I've driven trucks in snow
country all my life. For the money this is the best combo. Of
course you have to DRIVE the vehicle.

I learned snow and ice driving in a ten-mile long frozen bay on
the St Lawrence River. Take it up to 85mph and crank that wheel.
Practice until you can come out of the spin backwards about 50mph,
and snake it down through the pylons (tip-ups.)

We've had about 5 or 6 inches of lake effect snow here in the
E. Adirondacks in the past 24 hours. So far 2 Explorer roll-overs.
Remember 4 wheel drive does not impart invincibility, neither
will a locking device. Slow down ! And DRIVE your vehicle.
