Women are somehow toxic, that's why the ancient books,
including the BIBLE, do always warn of women.

The more women you have sex with, the worse. It's best
for a man to either have sex ONLY for making children
or to use condoms, ALWAYS.

A third option is to have no sex at all.

But bottom line is : Sex with women is dangerous, a
woman's vaginal fluids are dangerous and may cause
cancer. Oral sex is also dangerous and anal sex is
most dangerous of them all.

Gay sex, however, is pretty safe.

Lucas J. Riesau belched and pushed forth this thought:

=====&gt; well, if you are going to bring the bible into this to support
your argument, maybe you better turn to exodus 35.  if you are going to
be believe the bible that women are causing prostate cancer,  then, what
are you going to do to yourself for working on sundays and heating your
home in the winter?   look it up in the bible,  you'll see that i'm
right.  but just in case you can't find it,  here it is.......

~ curtis

35:2. Six days you shall do work; the seventh day shall be holy unto
you, the sabbath and the rest of the Lord: he that shall do any work on
it, shall be put to death.

35:3. You shall kindle no fire in any of your habitations on the sabbath
day.

knowledge is power - growing old is mandatory - growing wise is optional
&quot;Many more men die with prostate cancer than of it. Growing old is
invariably fatal. Prostate cancer is only sometimes so.&quot;

Someone on another group educated me about this.

A &quot;troll&quot; is a person who says outrageous things because he
thinks it's funny to get people to respond to them.  There are
people who like to do that in social conversation, but the Internet
is the best place for them because they can use made up
names so that people who actually know them don't think they're
such jerks.

Well, of course the people who know them may indeed think
they're jerks, and say so, but somehow it doesn't bother them
as much if the people on the Internet, whom they don't know
think they're jerks.

Anyway, the troll likes to pick some newsgroup that no one
ever uses for anything and cross post to it.  Then he uses
that group to count how many irate responses he got, and
maybe try to one-up the other trolls who didn't get quite as
many responses.

This particular troll, &quot;Lucas J. Riesau&quot;, certainly not his real name,
possibly never thought about the fact that he was posting to
a group of elderly men with cancer.

If Lucas is lucky, one day he too will be an elderly man.  If
he's not so lucky, he too may have cancer.  I imagine that
both kinds of changes in his life, age and illness, will bring
him a new perspective on this sort of thing.

Incidentally, I can't find alt.swordfighting on Google groups
or Giganews.  It's likely that there are many levels of trolldom
beyond my understanding, but I have to admit that
I'm not really anxious to learn more about them.

I wondered about the name too.  I was going to search for
anagrams, but I lack your skill and patience for it.
