At this point, there is really no non-auction source
for the bags.
When I inquired about this, he told me his wife did
most of the sewing and made the bags one at a time.
Auctioning in small batches was the only way they
could make this work at present. So keep your eyes
peeled for future acorn auctions, I guess.
