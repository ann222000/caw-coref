You were asleep a long long time? &lt;smile&gt;

Oddly enough, GHG have an uncanny ability to be absorbed by oceans, a side
effect of which is increased saltiness, and PH [acidity]

But most salts are derived by runoff from the land over time. So a key
component of AGW besides GHG is also land use. Be it forrest removal, or use
of fertilisers on farming lands ..... both of which tend to increase the
outflow of salts into streams, then rivers, and then into the oceans.

So as yet, Im a little confused about Dr Grat's naysayerness at this point,
but intend to look up his most recent comments and any studies to which he
refers. At this point, it seems to me to not really add up as a reason to
ignore AGW and just believe him that it's a cyclical chgnage in salt content
in the oceans .... for no particular reason but nature wanted it to happen
right now.

ok thanks

Why Is The Ocean Salty?
Science Daily — The saltiness of the sea comes from dissolved minerals, especially sodium, chlorine, sulfur, calcium, magnesium, and
potassium, says Galen McKinley, a UW-Madison professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences.

Pacific Ocean at dawn. Today's ocean salt has ancient origins. As the earth formed, gases spewing from its interior released salt
ions that reached the ocean via rainfall or land runoff.

Today’s ocean salt has ancient origins. As the earth formed, gases spewing from its interior released salt ions that reached the
ocean via rainfall or land runoff.

Now, the ocean’s salinity is basically constant. “Ions aren’t being removed or supplied in an appreciable amount,” McKinley says.
“The removal and sources that do exist are so small and the reservoir is so large that those ions just stay in the water.” For
example, she says, “Each year, runoff from the land adds only 0.00005 percent of total ocean salts.”

In lakes, relatively rapid turnover of water and its dissolved salts keeps the water fresh – a water droplet and its ions will stay
in Lake Superior for about 200 years, compared to roughly 100 to 200 million years in the ocean. “Even if you did have any
accumulation of an ion in a lake, it would be washed out quickly,” McKinley explains.

Ocean salts, however, have no place to go. “The ions that were put there long ago have managed to stick around,” McKinley says.
“There is geologic evidence that the saltiness of the water has been the way that it is for at least a billion years.”

I doubt the ocean, as a whole, is becoming saltier, but one could imagine
mechanisms that affect the salinity of smaller regions in the oceans.
(I haven't heard that this is happening, though.)

For example, enhanced evaporation would make a region saltier.
Formation of sea ice separates water and salt (the ice is mostly
fresh water), so changes in ice formation/movement and changes
in the downwelling of the residual high-salinity water would
have effects.  Changes in precipitation could affect where fresh
water is being added to the oceans, the flip side of evaporation.

I'll double ur bullshit then ... I didn;t say it was a big effect, but it is
an effect, and it is a one way street that has built up over time and
increased in rate. . :-)

There are &quot;salts/minerals&quot; in the soil, not just from fertilisers  ...
removal of ground covers eg logging clear felling etc causes &quot;erosion&quot; and
water removes salts from soils into water ways .... and they to the oceans.
Been going on a very long time I believe.

People have been crying out for a big rainfall here to &quot;flush out the
Murray/Darling basin as salt levels are thru the roof in the rivers.....
mainly man-made from &quot;agriculture&quot;. mmm, and the Murray flows into the
ocean.

Did I mention that intense irrigation literally sucks salt out of the
subsoils that have been there for eons untill farmers come along and add
un-natural quantities of water? Been going on since before babylon was
around. But of course you knew that.

anyway, thanks for the heads up, and sorry for my lack of scientific rigour.

The only way is by dilution with fresh water, and it would take an awful lot

Now Gray's theory _really_ becomes interesting considering he stated
the earth would be cooling in 15 years.

In other words, a full cycle of high salinity induced global warming
followed by glacial melt global cooling takes place in less than 200
years and possibly less than 70 years.

And most interesting of all is that such a tiny change in salinity --
a few cm rise in sea levels over the next 15 years will result in less
than a thousandth of a percent reduction in salinity -- could have
such dramatic effect in global temperatures.

How come I never heard about Dr. Gray's theory until now?

YEEEHAAA!

Resume? When did we stop?

According to the DOE, 24 are now under construction and about 20 more
are either about to start construction and/or have received most or
all of the necessary permits.

However, as I understand it, this is far, far less than we will need
in the years to come. Of course, as with nuclear reactors and oil
drilling, the enviroNazis have been doing everything in their power to
strangle the energy supply of the country and to make us even more
dependent on their Islamic fascist and S.American dictator friends.

It should be noted that in the 100 or so years when coal became our
major power source for generating electric power, life expectancy in
this country doubled. That just goes to prove how detrimental to our
health it is.

We also happen to have 100's of years supply of coal.

Arguably then, burning coal is not only good for us, it may be
*necessary* to our existence - which of course is precisely why
enviroNazis oppose it.

Thankyou J.

Of course, others forgot I actually GHG's and not CO2 specifically. And I
used the term GHG's intentionally as I was not referring to co2, but all the
other ghg's.

but that's life on ng's, and it's up to people to check their own facts, as
no one usually listens to what people say when it is contrary to their
existing pre-conceived ideas as to what the &quot;facts&quot; mean to them.

Then there's the problem that each head can only hold so many facts at one
point in time anyway. ;-))

&gt;&gt;&gt; But most salts are derived by runoff from the land over time. So a key

&gt;&gt; Bullshit. Forest fires release salts, logging does not.

The net reaction of adding CO2 to seawater is to cause MORE calcium

CaCO3 + H2O + CO2  &lt;---&gt;  Ca2+  + 2 HCO3-

Dissolution of carbonate is one of the things that will help drawn down

Power Plant Rejected Over Carbon Dioxide For First Time

By Steven Mufson
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, October 19, 2007; Page A01

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment yesterday became the first
government agency in the United States to cite carbon dioxide emissions as
the reason for rejecting an air permit for a proposed coal-fired electricity
generating plant, saying that the greenhouse gas threatens public health and
the environment.

The decision marks a victory for environmental groups that are fighting
proposals for new coal-fired plants around the country. It may be the first
of a series of similar state actions inspired by a Supreme Court decision in
April that asserted that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide should be
considered pollutants under the Clean Air Act.

I have no idea - nor apparently does anyone else here. I'm not a

alternate theories to AGW proposed by reputable scientists.

The point is that there is no consensus among scientists. This
supposed consensus is the BIG LIE of the AGW crowd. The very fact that
consensus is being pushed reveals the lie. The basis of science is not
consensus. It is truth - truth, first and foremost, which should then
lead to general agreement (as in fact is the case with much of science

But anyone who can do a component mass balance -- this will be well
over the ability of looneytarian-Randroids -- can easily see that that
with several million cubic miles worth of salt already in the oceans
before humans even existed, nothing could have happened in the past
few million years to increase the salinity a significant amount.

Even a foot rise in sea levels caused by polar ice melting wouldn't
have changed the concentration but -0.01%

We can worry about coal and nukes later. The rise to Hubbard's peak
followed a smooth bell curve. The decline wont, but be precipitous
with global economic melt down. As the price of oil rises, the greed
rises, and with that the violent efforts to control a supply of oil.
Unfortunately, that will damage the infrastructure, and stop
production there, as it has done in Iraq, and increasingly in
Nigeria.

The lower production will drive the price higher, driving the greed
higher, driving the violence higher, and production lower. Go back to
square one, and run it again until global demand ceases entirely
because the economies all crashed.

You think the traffic is crazy, wait til you see the mobs of angry
former drivers. In fact, you do not want to be in a major metro area
to see it. We can quit arguing about what we'd like to see, and think
more about what we will see, whether we like it or not.

And why is that (allegedly) the Anticipated lifetime? Was it due to

Ever is very long time. Besides it doesn't matter. Just as it would

Tar sands are very expensive to extract, that is why they are
&quot;reserves&quot; and will stay that way until
the price of oil gets sky-high.

Tomorrow's practical technology is based on

power, for instance -- is very slow and and expensive.

Peak production has already been reached, and new sources of oil are being

Nope.  Existing supply continues to rapidly decline, largely because the
self reporting of capacity by industry has allowed the industry to falsely
estimate their supply, and because current supply is being rapidly depleted.

Can't you get anything right Weiss?
