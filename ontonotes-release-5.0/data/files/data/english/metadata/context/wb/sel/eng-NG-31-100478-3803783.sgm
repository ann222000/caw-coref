I am considering buying a second hand Alfa GT (probably the diesel), I
love the look of the car and have always enjoyed driving Alfas.  I am
however slightly concerned as to what the depreciation is expected to
be.  I know alot of Alfas depreciate like mad (166!!!!) and am not to
keen to see a 16/17k investment dissappear to 5k in 2 years.

Does anyone have any information of how the GT is expected to
depreciate up to 3 or 4 years from new.

Having read other posts in this group concerning reliability, I have to
agree with those that think alot of it is due to susceptability to poor
maintenance.  My father had a 164 and did over 200,000 miles in it and
had no major problems.  Eventually the clutch gave up (not bad after
200k)

Any accurate information would be appreciated.

Take a look at the used car market at car a couple of years older than
the one you have your eye on. It may be a better idea to go for theolder
car, as long as the service history is complete. Would also beworth
getting an independant to look over it.

I have a GT 2.0JTS leased and they calculated the depreciation 15% less than
the 156
In 4 years / 125.000km my full options 156 SW 1.8 depreciated from 25000 to
12500 euro's so 50%
But that's in Holland.
Anyhow, I have always looked at it this way:
1. My other hobby (my wife) depreciates at a higher level, she "consumes"
all the money left after I have paid for the car, house and holidays
2. Other cars may depreciate less, but you spend more in the beginning. So
50% of 25000 will be 12500, but 35% of 35000 will be that same amount as
well (and then still the extra interest loss)
and, even more important IMHO,
3. Who cares about depreciation when driving a GT! Isn't that grin on your
face every morning worth every penny??

The GT is made to order and certainly in the UK there are very few about
which surely must keep the value up. This combined with the fact that they
are good value to begin with certainly makes the GT a relatively good bet
(in as much as any car is).

The diesel GT is a real stunner, by the way, and soooo nice to drive!!
