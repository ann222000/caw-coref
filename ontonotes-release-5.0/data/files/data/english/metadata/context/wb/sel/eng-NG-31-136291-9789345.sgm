Unhappy? Self-Critical? Maybe You’re Just a Perfectionist
By BENEDICT CAREY
Published: December 4, 2007
Just about any sports movie, airport paperback or motivational tape delivers a few boilerplate rules for success. Believe in yourself. Don’t take no for an answer. Never quit. Don’t accept second best.

Above all, be true to yourself.

It’s hard to argue with those maxims. They seem self-evident — if not written into the Constitution, then at least part of the cultural water supply that irrigates everything from halftime speeches to corporate lectures to SAT coaching classes.

Yet several recent studies stand as a warning against taking the platitudes of achievement too seriously. The new research focuses on a familiar type, perfectionists, who panic or blow a fuse when things don’t turn out just so. The findings not only confirm that such purists are often at risk for mental distress — as Freud, Alfred Adler and countless exasperated parents have long predicted — but also suggest that perfectionism is a valuable lens through which to understand a variety of seemingly unrelated mental difficulties, from depression to compulsive behavior to addiction.

Some researchers divide perfectionists into three types, based on answers to standardized questionnaires: Self-oriented strivers who struggle to live up to their high standards and appear to be at risk of self-critical depression; outwardly focused zealots who expect perfection from others, often ruining relationships; and those desperate to live up to an ideal they’re convinced others expect of them, a risk factor for suicidal thinking and eating disorders.

“It’s natural for people to want to be perfect in a few things, say in their job — being a good editor or surgeon depends on not making mistakes,” said Gordon L. Flett, a psychology professor at York University and an author of many of the studies. “It’s when it generalizes to other areas of life, home life, appearance, hobbies, that you begin to see real problems.”

Unlike people given psychiatric labels, however, perfectionists neither battle stigma nor consider themselves to be somehow dysfunctional. On the contrary, said Alice Provost, an employee assistance counselor at the University of California, Davis, who recently ran group therapy for staff members struggling with perfectionist impulses. “They’re very proud of it,” she said. “And the culture highly values and reinforces their attitudes.”

Consider a recent study by psychologists at Curtin University of Technology in Australia, who found that the level of “all or nothing” thinking predicted how well perfectionists navigated their lives. The researchers had 252 participants fill out questionnaires rating their level of agreement with 16 statements like “I think of myself as either in control or out of control” and “I either get on very well with people or not at all.”

The more strongly participants in the study thought in this either-or fashion, the more likely they were to display the kind of extreme perfectionism that can lead to mental health problems.

In short, these are people who not only swallow many of the maxims for success but take them as absolutes. At some level they know that it’s possible to succeed after falling short (build on your mistakes: another boilerplate rule). The trouble is that falling short still reeks of mediocrity; for them, to say otherwise is to spin the result.

Never accept second best. Always be true to yourself.

The burden of perfectionist expectations is all too familiar to anyone who has struggled to kick a bad habit. Break down just once — have one smoke, one single drink — and at best it’s a “slip.” At worst it’s a relapse, and more often it’s a fall off the wagon: failure. And if you’ve already fallen, well, may as well pour yourself two or three more.

This is why experts have long debated the wisdom of insisting on abstinence as necessary in treating substance abuse. Most rehab clinics are based on this principle: Either you’re clean or you’re not; there’s no safe level of use. This approach has unquestionably worked for millions of addicts, but if the studies of perfectionists are any guide it has undermined the efforts of many others.

Ms. Provost said those in her program at U.C. Davis often displayed symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder — another risk for perfectionists. They couldn’t bear a messy desk. They found it nearly impossible to leave a job half-done, to do the next day. Some put in ludicrously long hours redoing tasks, chasing an ideal only they could see.

As an experiment, Ms. Provost had members of the group slack off on purpose, against their every instinct. “This was mostly in the context of work,” she said, “and they seem like small things, because what some of them considered failure was what most people would consider no big deal.”

Leave work on time. Don’t arrive early. Take all the breaks allowed. Leave the desk a mess. Allow yourself a set number of tries to finish a job; then turn in what you have.

“And then ask: Did you get punished? Did the university continue to function? Are you happier?” Ms. Provost said. “They were surprised that yes, everything continued to function, and the things they were so worried about weren’t that crucial.”

The British have a saying that encourages people to show their skills while mocking the universal fear of failure: Do your worst.

If you can’t tolerate your worst, at least once in a while, how true to yourself can you be?

================================================================

As one Source of Narcissistic Supply dwindles, the narcissist finds himself
trapped in a frantic (though, at times, unconscious) effort to secure
alternatives. As one Pathological Narcissistic Space (the narcissist's
stomping grounds) is rendered &quot;uninhabitable&quot; (too many people &quot;see through&quot;
the narcissist's manipulation and machinations) – the narcissist wanders off
to find another.

These hysterical endeavours sometimes lead to boom-bust cycles which
involve, in the first stage, the formation of a Grandiosity Bubble.

The grandiose fantasies of the narcissist inevitably and invariably clash
with his drab, routine, and mundane reality. We call this constant
dissonance the Grandiosity Gap. Sometimes the gap is so yawning that even
the narcissist - however dimly - recognizes its existence. Still, this
insight into his real situation fails to alter his behaviour. The narcissist
knows that his grandiose fantasies are incommensurate with his
accomplishments, knowledge, status, actual wealth (or lack thereof),
physical constitution, or sex appeal - yet, he keeps behaving as though this
were untrue.

The narcissist cathexes (emotionally invests) with grandiosity everything he
owns or does: his nearest and dearest, his work, his environment. But, as
time passes, this pathologically intense aura fades. The narcissist finds
fault with things and people he had first thought impeccable. He
energetically berates and denigrates that which he equally zealously exulted
and praised only a short while before.

Being the target of relentless, ubiquitous, and unjust persecution proves to
the paranoid narcissist how important and feared he is. Being hounded by the
mighty and the privileged validates his pivotal role in the scheme of
things. Only vital, weighty, crucial, essential principals are thus bullied
and intimidated, followed and harassed, stalked and intruded upon - goes his
unconscious inner dialog. The narcissist consistently baits authority
figures into punishing him and thus into upholding his delusional self-image
as worthy of their attention. This provocative behaviour is called
Projective Identification.

It is healthy to daydream and fantasize. It is the antechamber of life and
its circumstances. It is a process of preparing for eventualities,
embellished and decorated. No, I am talking about feeling grandiose.

This feeling has four components.

Question:

What happens to a narcissist who lacks even the basic potential and skills
to realise some of his grandiose fantasies?

Answer:

Question:

Is the narcissist confined in his grandiose fantasies to one subject?

Answer:

This apparently simple question is more complex than it sounds. The
narcissist is bound to make use of his more pronounced traits and qualities
in both the design of his False Self and the extraction of Narcissistic
Supply from others. Thus, a cerebral narcissist is likely to emphasise his
intellect, his brainpower, his analytical skills and his rich and varied
fund of knowledge. A somatic narcissist accentuates his body, his physical
strength, his appearance, his sex appeal and so on. But this is only one
facet of the answer. It seems that narcissists engage in what could best be
described as Narcissistic Hedges.

The disparity between the accomplishments of the narcissist and his
grandiose fantasies and inflated self-image - the Grandiosity Gap - is
staggering and, in the long run, insupportable. It imposes onerous
exigencies on the narcissist's grasp of reality and social skills. It pushes
him either to seclusion or to a frenzy of &quot;acquisitions&quot; - cars, women,
wealth, power.

cannot confront my life - that dreary, aimless, unpromising stream of days
and nights and days. I am past my prime - a pitiable figure, a has been who
never was, a loser and a failure (and not only by my inflated standards).
These facts are hard enough to face when one is not burdened with a
grandiose False Self and a sadistic inner voice (Superego). I have both.

I feel entitled to more. I feel it is my right - due to my intellectual
superiority - to lead a thrilling, rewarding, kaleidoscopic life. I feel
entitled to force life itself, or, at least, people around me - to yield to
my wishes and needs, supreme among them the need for stimulating variety.

Question:

I met many narcissists who are modest – even self-effacing. This seems to
conflict with your observations. How do you reconcile the two?

To avoid the agonizing realization of his failed, defeat-strewn, biography,
the narcissist resorts to reality-substitutes. The dynamics are simple: as
the narcissist grows older, his Sources of Supply become scarcer, and his
Grandiosity Gap yawns wider. Mortified by the prospect of facing his
actuality, the narcissist withdraws ever deeper into a dreamland of
concocted accomplishments, feigned omnipotence and omniscience, and brattish
entitlement.

The manic phase of Bipolar I Disorder is often misdiagnosed as Narcissistic
Personality Disorder (NPD).

Bipolar patients in the manic phase exhibit many of the signs and symptoms
of pathological narcissism - hyperactivity, self-centeredness, lack of
empathy, and control freakery. During this recurring chapter of the disease,
the patient is euphoric, has grandiose fantasies, spins unrealistic schemes,
and has frequent rage attacks (is irritable) if her or his wishes and plans
are (inevitably) frustrated.

The narcissist's very self is a piece of fiction concocted to fend off hurt
and to nurture the narcissist's grandiosity. He fails in his &quot;reality
test&quot; - the ability to distinguish the actual from the imagined. The
narcissist fervently believes in his own infallibility, brilliance,
omnipotence, heroism, and perfection. He doesn't dare confront the truth and
admit it even to himself.

The irony is that narcissists, who consider themselves worldly, discerning,
knowledgeable, shrewd, erudite, and astute - are actually more gullible than
the average person. This is because they are fake. Their self is false,
their life a confabulation, their reality test gone. They live in a fantasy
land all their own in which they are the center of the universe, admired,
feared, held in awe, and respected for their omnipotence and omniscience.

The Depressive has pervasive and continuous depressive cognitions (thoughts) and behaviors. They manifest themselves in every area of life and never abate. The patient is gloomy, dejected, pessimistic, overly serious, lacks a sense of humor, cheerless, joyless, and constantly unhappy. This dark mood is not influenced by changing circumstances.

Many scholars consider pathological narcissism to be a form of depressive illness. This is the position of the authoritative magazine &quot;Psychology Today&quot;. The life of the typical narcissist is, indeed, punctuated with recurrent bouts of dysphoria (ubiquitous sadness and hopelessness), anhedonia (loss of the ability to feel pleasure), and clinical forms of depression (cyclothymic, dysthymic, or other). This picture is further obfuscated by the frequent presence of mood disorders, such as Bipolar I (co-morbidity).

Question:

Doesn't the narcissist ever feel sorry for his &quot;victims&quot;?

Answer:

The narcissist always feels &quot;bad&quot;. He experiences all manner of depressive episodes and lesser dysphoric moods. He goes through a full panoply of mood disorders and anxiety disorders. He experiences panic from time to time. It is not pleasant to be a narcissist.

The Bipolar Disorder got its name because the mania is followed by - usually protracted - depressive attacks. A similar pattern of mood shifts and dysphorias occurs in many personality disorders such as the Borderline, Narcissistic, Paranoid, and Masochistic.
