Trip Report - Dachstein Klettersteigs, AT (June 29 - July 1, 2007)

Trip with Berta Judit, Jancsi Medve, Maria Demjanics, Peter Pap

Part 2/3: Hoher Dachstein Ascent

Continued from http://groups.google.com/group/rec.climbing/browse_thread/thread/93c5...

The morning of July 1 dawned bright and clear at the Seethalerhutte
(2740 meters) on the Dachstein plateau, and we were up with the sun at
7am.  Well, that's not true at all since the sun rises around 5am near
June 21, but anyway, we were breakfasted, ready, and out the door by
7:40 in the morning.  We were not bringing much except for warm
clothes (since we were only doing 250 meters to the top of the
Dachstein), and we already had our Klettersteigsets on.  I made a
special configuration for my tennis shoes, which I saw another runner
doing in April while waiting for the Boston Marathon to start, while
it was pouring rain.  He had on socks (as is normal) and then inserted
each foot into a nylon bag (the kind you use for groceries), and put
those (nyloned feet) in his shoes.  This way, the feet are
waterproofed.  And this works, but there is a caveat: the feet cannot
breathe this way, and so they will get wet from their own sweat.  If
one were to keep the nylon bags on all day, the feet will have been
swimming in their own seat all day long - not good.  Also, it doesn't
protect against the cold.  The start of the klettersteig is no more
than about 10 minutes away from the Seethalerhutte on the slightly
rising snow.  I was sorry to have put on my Kahtoola crampons over my
tennis shoes at this point, and promptly disengaged myself of them.
The snow route continues further on and up past the klettersteig
start, but the klettersteig seemed the better option as only I had
crampons (the others had boots), and Marika has a definite penchant
for rock over walking.

The Klettersteig is easy enough (rated B), keeping mostly to the north
side of the ridge.  There were a few short patches of snow, but mostly
we were on rock, and there was a cable almost the entire length.
Except that the cable does not start until about 20 meters or so.
Evidently, this is to avoid giving rank beginners (people who have
come up by way of the cable car in the morning) the idea that this is
an easy thing that anyone can do.  Considering the number of people
going up this route later on, this does not seem unreasonable to me.
The klettersteig ends with a slightly descending lateral traverse that
brings it to more or less the center of the north face, where it meets
with the route coming up from the snow.  There is what looked like a
makeshift emergency tent at this point.

scramble.  However, there are big, meaty, iron holds drilled into the
rock.  It's no longer a klettersteig (though near the top there is
another cable), but there was no problem going up.  Throughout the
klettersteig and scramble, I was constantly on the lookout for the
warnings from Zsolt about poor protection and a slab of snow that
might be ready to slide down.  Never saw them.  The scramble was fun,
straightforward, and fairly short all the way to the top.  We had
brilliant views at the top with the fantastic weather.  And we had it
all to ourselves.  We might have even clambered onto the cross to
ensure that we made 3000 meters (shhhhh).  The story is that there are
two ways of measuring the Dachstein, one based on the elevation above
the North Sea (2995) and the other based on the elevation above the
Adriatic (3004).  This is one of those few cases where sea level
differences cause discrepancies in the macro world.

Klettersteig.  Actually, we couldn't really see it, but we could see
the track cutting mostly laterally across the Gossau Glacier, once it
got down there, to reach the Steiner Scharen Klettersteig.  This would
have added an extra hour or 1.5 hours to our trip back, and also
required some glacier travel, which we were not properly equipped
for.  So we went back the way we came up.

After spending a leisurely 20 minutes alone at the top, we started to
descend just in time to meet the first of the hordes starting to come
up from below.  The summit was about to become Grand Central Station.
People were circling from all sides.  Especially popular was the trek
up the snow tongue, bypassing the klettersteig we'd come up on (as
mentioned earlier, this snow tongue route meets up with the
klettersteig route at the emergency bivy location).  There was a
bergschrund at the very top of the snow tongue, but it had a nice snow
bridge so that crampons and ice axe were not necessary at that time.
Many people cast off their packs at this point for the final summit
ascent.  Marika and I went down first, and already there was a
significant issue of passing upcoming groups.  Significant only in
that it occurred frequently, and one must take care and sometimes
wait, but otherwise unremarkable.  Except to say that I found it
really odd that groups should be roped up on this section, which is
only a scramble.

At the split, Marika (who prefers rock) and I (preferring warmth of
foot) decided to go back by way of the klettersteig.  I figured Jancsi
and Peti would prefer the snow route down, and indeed, their only
problem was waiting for the myriad people coming up the 15 meter or so
section to the junction.  Once on the snow they were faster than
Marika and I on the klettersteig, beating us back by about 5 minutes.
In the last 20 meters or less of klettersteig, we had a disquieting
experience.  At the bottom of the klettersteig stood a group of 7 high
schoolers and a guide who were just putting their things on.  The
guide during this time had repeatedly looked at us as we made rapid
progress coming down.  Then when we were about 15 meters from the
bottom, he started to come up, roped to his seven acolytes.  Marika
asked him twice, clearly and politely, to wait please, as by this
point we were in the final no passing zone (ie. no place to reasonably
pull to the side).  He did not, and proceeded to drag two of the
students with him so that he was about 5 meters up, with two of the
students plastered to the rock.  At this point he stopped.  I can't
imagine what benefit he got from this viewed from a time,
psychological, politeness, security, or other standpoint.  He
deliberately started up roped to 7 kids when we'd already entered a no
passing zone.  Two kids clung to the cliff (with 5 still on the snow
below) as we stepped around them.  Afterwards I told the five kids
below that this was a dangerous thing and that they should let their
parents know about the incident.  Beyond an utter lack of
responsibility on the part of this leader, he was deliberately placing
his charges in a hazardous situation.  Afterwards I thought that the
worst thing was that the parents would probably never have a clue
because to the kids this was probably a non incident.  Very
disquieting.

By the time we were back at around 10:20, the Seethalerhutte was
mobbed with people, on an absolutely stunningly good day.  It was
sweater weather with high haze.  We took some refreshment, and then
continued by way of the wide snow track to the top of the tram
station, where we got ready for the Sky Walk Klettersteig.  To be
continued in the third and final part...
