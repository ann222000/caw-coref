Please check out http://www.snopes.com/medical/drugs/zicam.asp for a more
balanced report.

This is not an 'urban legend.' But neither is it a common occurrence.
Anosmia (loss of sense of smell) seems to be a very rare side effect of this
homeopathic medicine.

Please note that the website Gwen references is an attorney's website; an
law partnership specifically involved in the class action suit against the
makers of this product. Of course they will sound alarmist about the
product; it is in their pecuniary interest to do so.

I have used Zicam spray since it came on the market and find it very
effective in shortening the duration and intensity of colds. There are side
effects to most medications. The side effect should be publicized, but
people should still have the option of choosing the medication.

I wish we could trace the first e-mail.  It would not be a surprise
to learn that it came from those shyster lawyers.
