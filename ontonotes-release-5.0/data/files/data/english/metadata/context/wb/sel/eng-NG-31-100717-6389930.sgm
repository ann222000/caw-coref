Explosive new vote fraud developments continue to rock Ohio and Florida

Breaking news in vote fraud cases in both Ohio and Florida are feeding a
firestorm of controversy that is likely to continue escalating, with major
implications for the 2008 election and the future of e-voting machines.

In Ohio, Jennifer Brunner, the newly elected Secretary of State, has
received two of the four resignations she requested from the Cuyahoga County
Board of Elections (BOE). The two Democrats on the Board, Edward Coaxum, Jr.
and Loree Soggs, have complied with her call for their departures from
Cleveland's scandal-ridden election authority.

However, Robert Bennett, who chairs both the Cuyahoga BOE and the Ohio
Republican Party, has thus far refused Brunner's request. So has Sally
Florkiewicz, Bennett's fellow Republican on the BOE. Should they continue
with their refusal to resign, Brunner has threatened to hold public
hearings, in the wake of which she could force the resignations.

Meanwhile, the Associated Press reports that a criminal investigation is
underway which centers on the Cuyahoga BOE's conduct of the November 2006
election. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Bill Mason has turned again to Erie
County Prosecutor Kevin Baxter who recently won felony convictions of two
BOE workers for rigging the 2004 presidential recount for another criminal
investigation. Baxter will be investigating "possible criminal wrongdoings"
related to ballot security and the scanning of absentee ballots.

A Cleveland State University Center for Election Integrity study has exposed
various election irregularities in Cuyahoga County in the 2006 election.
Among the most egregious were the BOE's failure to secure the dual keys (one
for the Dems and one for the Republicans) required for the vote counting
rooms; that they allowed shared computer passwords; and that they allowed an
unexplained cable connection to the county's vote counting computer.

The Free Press also has viewed a video shot by Jeff Kirkby showing Cuyahoga
County election workers downloading the county's election data onto portable
laptops that were allegedly allowed to go home with BOE employees. These
practices raise serious concerns over election data security.

Massive computer failures during the May 2006 primary led in February 2007
to the resignation of Michael Vu, who was the executive director of the
Cuyahoga BOE at the time. Both Bennett and Vu pushed for the $20 million
purchase of Diebold voting machines over strenuous objections from election
protection activists, whose concerns were cablecast in the HBO documentary
"Hacking Democracy" shown nationwide just prior to the November 2006
election.

On March 21, the Dayton Daily News reported that "After two days of tests,
the results are in: About 2,500 people cast ballots in November on 56
malfunctioning electronic touch-screen voting machines in Montgomery County,
said Steve Harsman, county board of elections director."

The Free Press has previously reported that there were nearly 30,000
undervotes in Montgomery County during the 2006 gubernatorial race, meaning
an abnormally high 13.67% of all voters reportedly recorded no vote for the
state's highest office. (See chart posted with this article at the
Freepress.org web site courtesy of Pete Johnson and CASE-Ohio) Similar
undervote problems exist in Adams, Darke, Highland, Mercer and Perry
counties.

Meanwhile, Jonathon Simon has informed the Free Press that the Election
Defense Alliance (EDA) is analyzing data from Adams County as part of a
project to compare exit polls to actual votes. In the 2004 election, the
exit polls showed John Kerry winning, while the actual machine and computer
tabulated results gave the state to Bush by 118,000 votes.

Meanwhile, in Florida, internal memos from the ES&amp;S voting machine company
indicate an e-voting machine created an undervote problem, according to
Wired News. In Sarasota County, 18,000 ballots recorded no votes in a hotly
contested congressional race.

"But the memo, which the company sent to Florida election officials before
the state's September primary, revealed that the iVotronic machines had a
flaw that sometimes caused machines to respond slowly to a voter's touch
'beyond the normal time a voter would expect to have their selection
highlighted.' The memo stated that a software upgrade was required but
couldn't be certified before the September election. In its absence, ES&amp;S
sent election officials a warning sign to post at polls advising voters that
they might need to press the screen for several seconds before their votes
would register," wrote Wired News.

Reginald Mitchell, lawyer for People for the American Way, told Wired News
that "this memo is the smoking gun.."

The six counties under investigation in Ohio all used Diebold machines
suggesting that both major suppliers of e-voting machines have similar flaws
that create undervotes.

These waves of breaking news about serious problems in the conduct of the
2004 and 2006 elections, and in the performance of electronic voting
machines in the two states that have decided the last two presidential
elections, make it a virtual certainty that we have barely begun to see the
full extent of what has really been done to the American democratic system.
