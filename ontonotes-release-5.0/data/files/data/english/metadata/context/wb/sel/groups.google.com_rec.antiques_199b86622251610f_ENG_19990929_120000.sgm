I know this is off topic, but since I know that a large number of the
members of this group sell on eBay, I thought it would be more likely
here than anywhere else to find an answer to my problem.

Is their any way to make the email addresses in the end of auction
notices show up as links, not as something you have to cut and paste? I
am using Netscape, and if there is a setting I could change to make this
happen, I'd be eternally grateful. Since I cut and paste the bodies of
my notices, cutting and pasting the email addresses is more trouble than
just typing them.

Richard, the email addresses should be clickable links already... what
mail reader do you use?

Of course, the End of Auction notices are usually way too late in coming
for me. I usually click on the auction and use their email address from
there, then print the auction out as my record. If they're using an ID,
I just do the &quot;remember me&quot; bit so that their email address shows up
next to their User ID, then email and print.

for advertising purposes. Note that the first line in current EOAs is an
ad for eBay's Platinum Visa! As Richard suggests, it's useful to point the
customer back to your remaining open auctions so they can save on postage.
It would be easy for eBay to include that link as part of the EOA. Who
knows, maybe if enough sellers demand it it'll happen. I don't think many
have thought of it yet.

"/> My initial reply (which asks for the buyer's address and shipping
preference) is based on the eBay EOS notice: Using Netscape, I click on
&quot;Reply All&quot;, then delete the aw-conf ... @ebay.com address, leaving only
the buyer's e-mail.

After I hear back from them, I send a second e-mail using Auction
Assistant (which automatically harvests the buyer's e-mail address),
telling them the total and where to send payment. I think the
profesional version of AA will allow more flexibility for boilerplate
e-mails (so I can send both notices using AA, and not wait for the
end-of-auction notices), but my version only allows a single &quot;you've
won!&quot; e-mail.

I don't know about ebay postings, but I do know the simplest way to cut
and paste.

Highlight address, hold Ctrl and press x, release, and take curser to
place you want address, hold crtl and press v.

Much easier than going through the edit, cut, etc., IMO.

Doesn't work well for me on eBay, because I already copy my first
notice, and then just paste the body into each message. If I cut and
paste the address, I've got to go back and recopy the body, and by the
time I do that, I might as well type in the address in the first place,
it's quicker.

I do like the &quot;Reply all&quot; suggestion, that seems to work. I generally
set my auctions to close between 10:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. By the time I
get to it the next morning, most times my eBay end of auction notices
have come in (although I've had a few that came in the next day or not
at all). If they haven't, I go through My eBay and do it manually, but
it does take more time.

I generally only send one notice, since I precalculate shipping and
insurance and include it in the auction posting (unless it's too heavy
to precalculate it without a zip code, or the bidder got multiple
items). I don't generally give an option on shipping unless the winning
bidder specifically requests something other than Priority Mail.

As to Auction Assistant, how well does it work, how much does it cost,
and where do you get it? (I tried a search engine, but its amazing how
many hits &quot;Auction Assistant&quot; pulls up) I was going to try eBay's Mister
Lister, but they've got a notice up that they won't sign up any more
users until the new version comes out.

The main reason for the two-step process is to make sure I have the
buyer's address right away: in case a payment arrives without the eBay
number, e-mail address, or item description, I can have a better chance
of identifying the item by matching the payment to the shipping address.

"/> I think &lt;http://www.blackthornesw.com&gt; will get you there; if not, check
any of my auctions (foo-dog-antiques) on eBay, and there will be a link
to Auction Assistant/Blackthorne Software at the bottom of the
description box.

I'm using the basic version (about $70), there is a new professional
version that I'll probably upgrade to (about $170, IIRC) for the added
flexibility.

I'm really happy with it, aside from the lack of flexibility on
after-auction e-mails and the fact that it only interfaces with eBay
(though I think I can use AA to create the HTML portio of the listing
and then cut and paste that into any other auction site). They are
working on versions for Amazon and others.

(1) AA allows me to have a very nicely designed, professional-looking
ad without knowing any HTML other than paragraph breaks and boldface.
Take a look at one of my ended auctions to see the result:
&lt;http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=168947101&gt; It
also allows one to do really stupid things like adding music or fancy
backgrounds.

(2) AA automatically adds all my boilerplate to the auction listings,
and pre-selects standard settings for all the eBay options; the only
thing I have to enter on the eBay Start Auction page is category.

(3) AA harvests the winning bidders' e-mail address/bid amount from
eBay, and uses boilerplate to create standard after-auction e-mails. I
still personalize each one, but that's more a matter of deleting than
typing.

There are other features I don't use, but those three are worth the
money, IMO. (I think it will display a spreadsheet of auction status,
but I use Honesty or My eBay for that.) I've had no problems with it,
except for it being a bit slow when importing/exporting info to/from
eBay pages, but it's still a heckuva lot quicker than having to type it
all out myself.

(And, no, I have no connection whatsoever to the company.)

I ask for the shipping address in my original end of auction notice,
along with requesting that they put the auction number on the check.
They don't always do both things, but ALMOST always do either one or the
other.

Thanks for the input on Auction Assistant. I am getting to the point
where I'm going to have to automate somehow, at least with regards to
the postings.

"/> Richard,
The easiest way I've found to turn an email address to a link in Netscape is
to highlight the address in your text, copy it, go to the menu at the top of
the screen under &quot;insert&quot; and choose link. A dialogue box shoujld come up
with the selected text (the email address) in the first slot.
Just paste the copied address in the second slot (URL of the desired link) and
hit OK. The address should then appear as a link in your post.

Be that as it may, Charleen, the Auction Assistant program has many other time
saving features. The best one is you can write all your auctions off line.
How many times have you had problems with eBay and lost your work? That won't
happen with AA. Also, with a click of one button your pictures are uploaded.
When the auction is over, another button click and your pictures are removed
from your hard drive as well as where you store them. Another great feature is
once you fill in the amount of the sale and email address, you can send all
sorts of mail with a click of that button. I think I've been able to increase
my production by at least double since I began using AA. The new Pro version
has even more features that I will be slowly learning. You really should give
it a chance. I believe you can get a free 30 day trial.

&gt;&gt;I can reuse my old HTML and write new stuff faster than I can use one
&gt;&gt;of them new-fangled auction management programs. Admittedly, my techniques
&gt;&gt;aren't for everyone.

I think you can use AA to create the HTML for the description, then copy
and paste it into the description on any auction site. But I haven't
tried this. But you'd have to fill out the rest of the listing form
manually, and handle all the auction management/e-mail yourself.

Thanks for all the suggestions. I think I can hammer out something that
will work for me out of all the info that was provided.

Ashley, I always do my auctions offline first, and you don't need AA to
do that. I just fire up FrontPage Express (comes with IE4/5) and load my
standard template and fill in the changes (and leave the S&amp;I info in
place), and then save. I then go to the Sell Item page, open up my .html
file in Wordpad and copy and paste to my heart's content! AA only makes
that marginally easier, so that wouldn't be the sole reason someone
should use it. I've had folks email me and ask if they could &quot;borrow&quot; my
template, and I tell 'em, go for it! &lt;grin&gt;

And with IE5, I don't even have to type my user info on the Sell Item
page anymore, I just click on the field, press my down arrow key and
there's the info (stored by field name, so my city doesn't come up as a
choice for my zip code and vice versa). &lt;g&gt;

Have fun, Michele

&gt; Be that as it may, Charleen, the Auction Assistant program has many
other time
&gt; saving features. The best one is you can write all your auctions off
line.
&gt; How many times have you had problems with eBay and lost your work?
That won't
&gt; happen with AA. Also, with a click of one button your pictures are
uploaded.
&gt; When the auction is over, another button click and your pictures are
removed
&gt; from your hard drive as well as where you store them. Another great
feature is
&gt; once you fill in the amount of the sale and email address, you can
send all
&gt; sorts of mail with a click of that button. I think I've been able to
increase
&gt; my production by at least double since I began using AA. The new Pro
version
&gt; has even more features that I will be slowly learning. You really
should give
&gt; it a chance. I believe you can get a free 30 day trial.
