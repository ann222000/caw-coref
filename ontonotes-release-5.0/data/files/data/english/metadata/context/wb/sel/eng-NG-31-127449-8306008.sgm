Here's a house a few hundred yards from where I live. Almost 21 years ago
the owner arranged for a sculpture of a shark to be put in the roof:

http://www.headington.org.uk/history/misc/shark.htm

Done without warning (or planning permission) the sculpture took us all by
surprise. I was one of the first to see it as I walked past that road to
collect a parcel from the nearby Post Office. There was a long struggle with
the bureaucrats and eventually the shark was saved. Now preparations are
being made for its 21st birthday next month.

And the weird thing is that the eccentric Brit who arranged for the shark to
be created is actually an American.

Isn't this old news?

The Shark became the most famous resident of Headington when it landed in
the roof of 2 New High Street (see map) on 9 August 1986.

The shark celebrates its 21st birthday on 8 August 2007, and is at present
being refurbished ready for the celebrations.

We don't hear much about them anymore, do we?  The end of the Cold War

Trouble is, the cold war may have been declared over in 1991 but most
of those nukes are still out there, and many of them are in not quite
as safe hands as they were back then. Think about whether you trust
Bush II more than Bush I, or Putin more than Gorby, and consider that
some of the other people who have nukes are a step or two lower on the
reliability and stability scale than them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;SDI? Like Reagan's SDI?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Can you even campaign against things that don't exist any more?

&gt;&gt;Don't exist any more? Do the words &quot;missile defense shield&quot; mean
&gt;&gt;anything to you?

&gt; Oh, sure. I guess you're right, but I had separated them in my head as

I doubt that they're bringing back the same programs.  Brilliant Pebbles

&gt;&gt;&gt;We don't hear much about them anymore, do we?  The end of the Cold War

&gt;&gt;Trouble is, the cold war may have been declared over in 1991 but most
&gt;&gt;of those nukes are still out there, and many of them are in not quite
&gt;&gt;as safe hands as they were back then. Think about whether you trust
&gt;&gt;Bush II more than Bush I, or Putin more than Gorby, and consider that
&gt;&gt;some of the other people who have nukes are a step or two lower on the
&gt;&gt;reliability and stability scale than them.

&gt; I know, which is why I'm surprised that CND is so much off the radar
&gt; these days.  It's as if J B Priestley and Michael Foot never existed.

&gt;&gt;Feel better now?

&gt; No, I've never felt worse.

This should cheer you up.

Or maybe not, seeing that you are a Brit:

No one likes us
I don't know why.
We may not be perfect
But heaven knows we try.
But all around even our old friends put us down.
Let's drop the big one and see what happens.

We give them money
But are they grateful?
No they're spiteful
And they're hateful.
They don't respect us so let's surprise them;
We'll drop the big one and pulverize them.

Now Asia's crowded
And Europe's too old.
Africa's far too hot,
And Canada's too cold.
And South America stole our name.
Let's drop the big one; there'll be no one left to blame us.

We'll save Australia;
Don't wanna hurt no kangaroo.
We'll build an all-American amusement park there;
They've got surfing, too.

Well, boom goes London,
And boom Paree.
More room for you
And more room for me.
And every city the whole world round
Will just be another American town.
Oh, how peaceful it'll be;
We'll set everybody free;
You'll have Japanese kimonos, baby,
There'll be Italian shoes for me.
They all hate us anyhow,
So let's drop the big one now.
Let's drop the big one now.
