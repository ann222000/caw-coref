Well, by the end of last night, I left feeling a bit down.

I was going to offer the following advice for those who still have a show to
see:

1) Do NOT watch the Hammersmith DVD if you're going to see Springsteen
anytime during the weeks prior and up to showtime..
2) Do NOT see an Arcade Fire show just a month before seeing Springsteen....

While I realize and appreciate that there is a gigantic connection between
Springsteen's past works (especially from the 1970s), I can understand why
he'd play &quot;Backstreets&quot; just a couple of songs prior to doing &quot;Devil's
Arcade.&quot;
However the idea looks better on paper than it comes off in concert.

&quot;Backstreets&quot;...that worked so well when he was a young fellow in his
twenties....heartbroken, bitter, shattered, but still something of a
romantic.  It was much like a Romeo nursing his wounds in the darkness of of
streets where the lights don't shine.
Now.....as we jettison a few decades......hearing a guy pushing 60 singing
&quot;hiding on the backstreets&quot; brings to mind a bum in an alley.
I'm not so sure that's the effect he really wants to convey....or maybe it
is.
All in all, the song from this album are holding up less and less well live
than they did 30 years ago....
In short, they're no  longer believable.
Scrap 'em, I say....

On the plus side, Thursday night did have 9 out of 11 songs from
MAGIC....and that definitely made the going worth the while.
Hearing &quot;Your Own Worst Enemy&quot; was a treat....as was hearing the other eight
songs from that album.

I was scared, though.....wondering if the band was up there solely for the
do-re-mi.
I'd never seen them so aloof......well, not since the Amnesty International
Tour (as they neared their end).
The only ones who seemed to be filled with any spark of joy were Springsteen
and Soozie....the others felt as though they were sleepwalking/going through
the motions.

And, my major complaint about Springsteen/E Street Band shows once again
reared its less than welcome head......a lack of dynamics.  Remembering
those days when they could go from a whisper to a scream....back to a
whisper and then a cathartic ending that transcended a banshee's cry in the
wilderness...I find it a great loss (and waste of some fine
potential/talent) to have an entire show (save for maybe &quot;Magic&quot; and
&quot;Thunder Road&quot;) have all the dynamics, twists &amp; turns of a Texas highway.

Seriously.  If one were to chart Thursday's show, it would look something
like this:

___________  ___________________________________________________________
____________________
U

&quot;Magic&quot;
&quot;Thunder Road&quot;

Hearing half of the BORN TO RUN album reads better on paper than it sounds
in reality.
Going back to another thread (which album do you prefer...BTR or DARKNESS),
the DARKNESS material still sounds pretty plausible coming from a cat
Springsteen's age.  &quot;She's the One&quot; doesn't.
As for &quot;Born to Run&quot; itself....I've pretty much resigned myself to that
being much like Dylan's &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; or &quot;All Along the
Watchtower&quot;....and if it's a show w/The E Street Band, then not playing it
isn't an option.
I can live with that....

As much as I dreaded the thought of warhorses such as &quot;Promised Land&quot; and
&quot;Badlands&quot;.....they do work within the context of the MAGIC material.  Now,
if only he could have shaken the dynamics tree a bit more on Thursday.
I dunno.....maybe it was jet-lag.....but I'd never seen the band so aloof
and disengaged.
I got to wondering if they were up on that stage solely for the money.
I was hoping that Friday would prove me wrong...and, perhaps, they were
trying to get over a bit of jet-lag or get used to the time change that
comes from going from east to west.

In a nutshell, Thursday was a mediocre show.
The sound was better than I expected......that was a nice surprise.
Not a whole lot of innovation of older material (the only song that got
reworked was &quot;Reason to Believe&quot;...which wound up being one of the night's
non-MAGIC highlights).  Okay, I got it.  Each song plays as a tug-of-war
with the other....and we hang on the edge of our seats wondering what side
will win.  By &quot;American Land&quot; we realize that we'll endure....'cause we're
the people.
I like the thought behind the show.
It was just the execution and production of making that thought interesting
on stage that seemed a bit lacking...

Man oh man.......was I tentative when I woke up this morning (Friday)...and
thought of going back for the same all over again.
If things didn't change,  my heart felt as though it was going to break
(it'd little to do with the money paid...and more to do with remembering how
great they once were).

Well, come Friday, GREAT is the word I would use to describe them.
Joy and enthusiasm seemed to burst out of each member of the band while up
on stage.

I know that I've written that I could live a lifetime without hearing &quot;Two
Hearts&quot; or&quot;Working on the Highway&quot;...but, man oh man, the almost boyish
enthusiasm that Springsteen brought to those songs made them feel as though
I was back in that arena in 1980 and 1984 respectively.  And there were
dynamics......&quot;Racing in the Street&quot; sounded nearly as beautiful as it did
when heard in that same arena 20+ years ago.  &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; provided some
much-needed wizardry......
Hell, tonight I found myself absolutely loving &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Dancing in
the Dark&quot;....amazing what a band feeding off of one another's energy can do
to a song.  Never ever having heard &quot;Thundercrack&quot; live before....well, it
ain't a masterpiece...but it sure was loads of fun, the very essence of what
helps make rock and roll so joyous.

And, since tomorrow most will have the day off, I'd even dare say that the
audience was giving back what they were receiving.
Their energy clung to the air and seemed to electrify one another.
I felt as though I was in the ADD section
I mean how many beers can one Brucer drink in a night??..
And, guys, if you're in your 40s, 50s or 60s then there stands a good chance
your prostate isn't going to be what it was when you were in your
20s....and, yes, you will have to go wee wee if you keep drinking beer all
night.......
And it really becomes a pain in the arse when the same people cross in front
of you ten times in two hours.
Save for those who can't get enough of beer on the tap, though, the crowd
seemed to be in a zeitgeist with Springsteen and band.

Man, what a difference a day makes.
This morning I was ready to swear off ever seeing Springsteen with The E
Street Band again after last night's show.
After tonight...well, making a trip to L.A. doesn't seem that outrageous an
idea.....

They delivered the goods...and then some......tonight.
Probably the best Springsteen show I've seen since the BITUSA Tour.....
Okay, so it didn't reach the marathon lengths of days gone by.......but
it'll do just fine!
