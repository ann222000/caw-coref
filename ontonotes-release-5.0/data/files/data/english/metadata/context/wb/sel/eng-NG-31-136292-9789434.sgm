The Narcissist in Therapy

First published here: &quot;Personality Disorders (Suite101)&quot;

&quot;Personality Disorders Revisited&quot; (450 pages e-book) - click HERE to purchase!

By: Dr. Sam Vaknin

The narcissist regards therapy as a competitive sport. In therapy the narcissist usually immediately insists that he (or she) is equal to the psychotherapist in knowledge, in experience, or in social status. To substantiate this claim and &quot;level the playing field&quot;, the narcissist in the therapeutic session spices his speech with professional terms and lingo.

The narcissist sends a message to his psychotherapist: there is nothing you can teach me, I am as intelligent as you are, you are not superior to me, actually, we should both collaborate as equals in this unfortunate state of things in which we, inadvertently, find ourselves involved.

The narcissist at first idealizes and then devalues the therapist. His internal dialogue is:

&quot;I know best, I know it all, the therapist is less intelligent than I, I can't afford the top level therapists who are the only ones qualified to treat me (as my equals, needless to say), I am actually as good as a therapist myself…&quot;

&quot;He (my therapist) should be my colleague, in certain respects it is he who should accept my professional authority, why won't he be my friend, after all I can use the lingo (psycho-babble) even better than he does? It's us (him and me) against a hostile and ignorant world (shared psychosis, folie a deux)…&quot;.

&quot;Just who does he think he is, asking me all these questions? What are his professional credentials? I am a success and he is a nobody therapist in a dingy office, he is trying to negate my uniqueness, he is an authority figure, I hate him, I will show him, I will humiliate him, prove him ignorant, have his licence revoked (transference). Actually, he is pitiable, a zero, a failure…&quot;

These self-delusions and fantastic grandiosity are, really, the narcissist's defences and resistance to treatment. This abusive internal exchange becomes more vituperative and pejorative as therapy progresses.

The narcissist distances himself from his painful emotions by generalising and analyzing them, by slicing his life and hurt into neat packages of what he thinks are &quot;professional insights&quot;.

The narcissist has a dilapidated and dysfunctional True Self, overtaken and suppressed by a False Self. In therapy, the general idea is to create the conditions for the True Self to resume its growth: safety, predictability, justice, love and acceptance. To achieve this ambience, the therapist tries to establish a mirroring, re-parenting, and holding environment.

From my book &quot;Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited&quot;:

&quot;Therapy is supposed to provide these conditions of nurturance and guidance (through transference, cognitive re-labelling or other methods). The narcissist must learn that his past experiences are not laws of nature, that not all adults are abusive, that relationships can be nurturing and supportive.

Most therapists try to co-opt the narcissist's inflated ego (False Self) and defences. They compliment the narcissist, challenging him to prove his omnipotence by overcoming his disorder. They appeal to his quest for perfection, brilliance, and eternal love - and his paranoid tendencies - in an attempt to get rid of counterproductive, self-defeating, and dysfunctional behaviour patterns.&quot;

Some therapists try to stroke the narcissist's grandiosity. By doing so, they hope to modify or counter cognitive deficits, thinking errors, and the narcissist's victim-stance. They contract with the narcissist to alter his conduct. Psychiatrists tend to medicalize the disorder by attributing it to genetic or biochemical causes. Narcissists like this approach as it absolves them from responsibility for their actions.

Therapists with unresolved issues and narcissistic defenses of their own sometimes feel compelled to confront the narcissist head on and to engage in power politics, for instance by instituting disciplinary measures. They compete with the narcissist and try to establish their superiority: &quot;I am cleverer than you are&quot;, &quot;My will should prevail&quot;, and so on. This form of immaturity is decidedly unhelpful and could lead to rage attacks and a deepening of the narcissist's persecutory delusions, bred by his humiliation in the therapeutic setting.

Narcissists generally are averse to being medicated as this amounts to an admission that something is, indeed, wrong and &quot;needs fixing&quot;. Narcissists are control freaks and hate to be &quot;under the influence&quot; of &quot;mind altering&quot; drugs prescribed to them by others.

From my book &quot;Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited&quot;:

&quot;Many (narcissists) believe that medication is the &quot;great equaliser&quot;: it will make them lose their uniqueness, superiority and so on. That is unless they can convincingly present the act of taking their medicines as &quot;heroism&quot;, a daring enterprise of self-exploration, part of a breakthrough clinical trial, and so on.

(Narcissists) often claim that the medicine affects them differently than it does other people, or that they have discovered a new, exciting way of using it, or that they are part of someone's (usually themselves) learning curve (&quot;part of a new approach to dosage&quot;, &quot;part of a new cocktail which holds great promise&quot;). Narcissists must dramatise their lives to feel worthy and special. Aut nihil aut unique – either be special or don't be at all. Narcissists are drama queens.

Very much like in the physical world, change is brought about only through incredible powers of torsion and breakage. Only when the narcissist's elasticity gives way, only when he is wounded by his own intransigence – only then is there hope.

It takes nothing less than a real crisis. Ennui is not enough.&quot;

Body Language and Personality Disorders

First published here: &quot;Personality Disorders (Suite101)&quot;

&quot;Personality Disorders Revisited&quot; (450 pages e-book) - click HERE to purchase!

By: Dr. Sam Vaknin

Patients with personality disorders have a body language specific to their disorder. It comprises an unequivocal series of subtle presenting signs. The patient's body language usually reflects the underlying mental health problem. For instance: people with Avoidant Personality Disorder and patients with its diametrical opposite, the Narcissistic Personality Disorder, comport themselves differently.

A few examples:

The Narcissist's body language- from my book &quot;Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited&quot;:

&quot;Haughty&quot; body language – The narcissist adopts a physical posture which implies and exudes an air of superiority, seniority, hidden powers, mysteriousness, amused indifference, etc. Though the narcissist usually maintains sustained and piercing eye contact, he often refrains from physical proximity (he maintains his personal territory).&quot;

The psychopath is likely to be expansive (dominate and invade other people's personal territory), swaggering, and vaguely menacing. His manifest equanimity is bound to be mixed with an underlying streak of agitation, violent impatience, and hypervigilance. The general impression is of a wound time bomb, about to explode.

The Avoidant is reticent and maintains a clearly demarcated personal turf to which she often withdraws (for instance, by folding her legs underneath her). Her body posture is tense and defensive: shoulders stooped, arms folded, legs crossed. She avoids eye contact.

The Borderline is &quot;all over the place&quot;. Her body seems to not be fully under her control. She is irritated, fidgety, manic, and alternates between displaying empathic warmth and a demanding, sulking or even threatening position.

The Schizoid is robotic, slow, and deliberate. He moves reluctantly, maintains great distance from the therapist, and is passive (but not aggressive) throughout the encounter.

The Schizotypal is hypervigilant but friendly and warm. He does not hesitate to gesture his emotions; affection, anger, or fear. Similar to the Obsessive-Compulsive, the Schizotypal has small, private rituals which he uses to reduce his level of anxiety.

The Paranoid is cold and defensive, hypervigilant and has a startle reaction. His eyes dart, he fidgets, and sometimes sweats and has difficulties breathing (Panic Attacks). His speech is likely to be idiosyncratic and he maintains eye contact only when trying to prove a point and to gauge his interlocutor's reaction.

In itself, body language cannot and should not be used as a diagnostic tool. But, in conjunction with psychiatric interviews and psychological tests, it can provide an additional layer of diagnostic certainty.
