What parent in their right mind would take a child to a NASCAR race?
If you are a responsible or sane adult, would you show up at a race
track and subject yourself and your children to the insanity of the
Daytona 500; where two hundred thousand people inhale poisonous carbon
dioxide fumes for three hours?

Ahhh so you just saw your hero's (Al The Bore Gore snake oil salesman)
movie.

Go hold up your Greenhouse Gas sign all day long on a corner in NYC and see
how much CO2 you breathe in. Now that's insanity, just make sure ya bring
the kiddies with ya.

And that would be Carbon Monoxide not Carbon Dioxide. They haven't put
Catalytic Converters on the Stock Cars yet, at least the last time I
checked. They don't work to well with the Jet Fuel ya kno.

Did anyone notice the Snake Oil Salesman preaching that everyone should be
buying Hybrid Cars, while he tools around his ranch in what appears to be a
17mpg Cadillac?

Ditto for the new Dem Gov of Massachusetts, fuck'in hypocrite's.

You would be better off bitching about these night races and how much energy
is wasted lighting the track for a race that should be run in the daytime.

Go hump a tree ya fuck'in hypocrite.

If he is a snake oil salesman as you say, did you ever think he could be
burning snake oil in a converted deisel engine? OR,
Ever come to your mind his car COULD POSSIBLY be a gas/electric conversion?
Last I checked, you can still buy those kits.

Talented night racers can drive roadcourses with little more than a set of
headlights, IN THE RAIN. Why not Nascar?

WOW! I bet that thought left a skid mark under your cap!

Now, if you'll excuse me, it's pretty fuckin' cold in my neck of the woods.
I'm goin' outside with a few aerosol cans to promote global warming.

And you are....who?

What parent in their right mind would take a child to a NASCAR race? If
you are a responsible or sane adult, would you show up at a race track
and subject yourself and your children to the insanity of the Daytona
500; where two hundred thousand people inhale poisonous carbon dioxide
fumes for three hours?

Wow.  What a great, grand generalizement you are.

The fumes go on I would imagine for all of what we know as  "Speed
Week", and well before.  It's outdoors....you apparently don't know
that.

Why are you here?  Wasting your time...the fabulous parent you are....go
spend time with your...heh-heh...children.

I've been following NASCAR for a long time, I've never been to a race.
I'm threatening to go, the family keeps me in check...NO, you hate
crowds...heat.. noise...  For perhaps 8 hrs on raceday, on a regular
week-end.  My best hope is NH.    Where did you get 3 hours for Daytona?
Check your sources...

You are both wrong; he has hired illegal aliens to run on a treadwheel under

I give you three of five stars on your fishing. The bait is quite fresh, but
your casting scared a lot of fish away.
