Me and a freind have encountered a problem with our DVD recorders. We
have Pioneer and Panasonic respectively. The problem is tha twe have
discs we have been recording on and off for several months now. The
information will be on the discs after we are done recording however
when we get ready to finalize the disc not only will they some times
not finalize (we both get &quot;unknown disc&quot;,  &quot;disc error&quot; or some
similar message) but to make matters worse what was recorded
mysteriously vanishes even though we both have seen with our eyes that
the material was on there before we tried to finalize the disc.

Upon researching this on the net I found that this is NOT an uncommon
problem. What I can't find out is WHY this is the case? Is the problem
a faulty dis, ,the fact that an unfinalized disc is only good for a
limited period of time before it &quot;expires&quot; so to speak, or is it
something else totally different. Any help with how to solve this
problem or at the very least keep it from happening so often. What
brand/model has this happen the least? It's REALLY getting
frustrating!!!!

In cases like this, it has usally happened when i record a show that
lasts a couple of weeks.  I'll usually put about 4 episodes so that's
like 4 weeks that they are out.  I always thoought it had to do with
how much dust the disk has.  I always noticed that the discs that
would give me this problem were dusty.  However, I had also noticed
that this problem happened more with my Panasonic dvdr model than it
does with my newer Philips.  In fact, I would say that I've only had
maybe 2 or 3 discs that thishas happened to with my Philips, whereas
with the Panasonic I had upwards of maybe 20-30 discs that would've
had that problem.  I believe it's probably a fault of the Panasonic,
the Pioneer must have the same tick.  I also remember that my
Panasonic was very finicky after the first 4 months of heavy use,
that's when it started to mess up.  It would not turn on with the
remote.  Of course, anything you recorded couldn't be paused or
finalized because the remote wouldn't work.  Also, the disc would not
come out of the machine and i would have to unplug it and plug it back
so that it could start up  again and i could take the disc out.

So i would say it's probably the because it's the brand of the
machine.  I had a Panasonic camcorder and that had problems too.
After that, no more panasonic for me.

This is news to me. I left a 2 year old disc unfinalized with like an
hour on it, then recorded something on it and if finalized fine. Been
using Panasonic and Pioneer. I've nvever had data dropped off a disc.
I've had bad discs before where I couldn't finalize it, but use better
discs now. What discs do you use? I think you need a dvd recorder with
a hard drive. That way if the disc doesn't burn right, you still have
the shows on the hard drive so you can try again on another disc. Then
when the new disc finalizes correctly, then dump the shows on the hard
drive. It's more work, but it's the only way to go I think.

There are several possibilities. One is the type of media you're
using. Are you using really good quality discs, or crap discs like
Optodisc or Princo? If you're using crap discs, these may give you
problems. High quality idscs like Taiyo Yuden or Verbatim seldom give
me problems. Maybe one bad burn out of 500, on average.

Another possibility is that you're using DVD-R/W discs. I've found
that after a few dozen uses I sometimes have to pop the DVD-R/W disc
into my computer drive and do a complete slow format on it. That
usually fixes this issue with DVD-R/W discs.

Another possibility is that you recorded a whole lot of data onto the
disc. I find that if I record right to the end of the disc, sometimes
the disc won't finalize. This problem doesn't occur if I don't cram
huge amounts of data onto the disc -- i.e., if I hit pause during some
commercials, or if I don't record 5 minutes before and after each hour-
long show.

One last possibility is that your burner in your DVD recorder might be
going bad. Very rarely it happens that when you burner starts going
bad you'll get increasingly flaky behavior from your DVD recorder,
culminating in non-stop DISC ERROR messages.

Hehe, I'd have to say that about 90% of my bad discs back then were
Verbatim as I rarely bought anything else.  Huge 100 pack spindles.
But they wouldn't be in the same batch, they'd be spread out.
However, I did use a Maxell small pack and about 8 of those messed
up.  I suppose then my Panasonic was already getting burned out by 5-6
months then after getting it.

Have you cleaned your units?  Mine does that when the laser lens gets
dirty.  A CD/DVD cleaner disk runs around $10.  I looks like it has
small eye lashes on it and that sweeps the lens clean.  Melody

i have a Panasonic and i noctice its real picky on what disc it uses.
so far i'm using memorex and no problems. how long you have your
recorder? they only last for so long and i have to put my other
recorder on retirement after 5 discs wouldn't finalize in a row or
recording error keeps coming up. try cleaning the lens and use a
diffrent brand dic. if you keep having problems, then it's time to
take the machine for repair or get a new one.

At the time, I only used Verbatims, TDK, and Sony, and Maxell. It
didn't matter which brand, sometimes the disc would work great while
recording then when i finally got them to format, that's when the
error would come in.  Hehe, it just seemed to me it would get picky
whenever it felt like it.  Sometimes it'd actually work after the
Fonzarelli method of hitting it, lol.  But sometimes it wouldn't. The
memorex's that I mentioned before, I didn't even use those on the
recorder themselves because there were dvdr/w and the Panasonic was a
DVD-Ram unit.

So I used them for my computer and I filled them all up with video
clips that I had recorded with my camcorder.  There were about 10
discs.  The next day I put in several and I would always get an error
&quot;disc cannot be read&quot;  or &quot;error with disc&quot; this wwas about 6 discs.
Only 4 seemed good.  Then I tried them the next day and only 2 now
worked.  Then about 3 weeks later for some reason, only one of the
discs worked.  I think about 3 or 4 months later I got a small spindle
of the memorex's and again I used them for the computer  and i would
get alot of errors while buring stuff.  So no more memorex.

I have a Pioneer recorder as well.  Do you do a lot of recording that
way, that is, one disc recorded over time?  If your machine as a hard
drive it may be wise to hold on to the recording(s) until you have a
finaized disc, or possibly even use rewritable discs as a storage medium
until the final disc is done.

I also discovered that, at least with my Pioneer recorder, which has a
hard drive, if the problem disc in question is still playable, but just
won't finalize, the recorded material can be copied back to the hard
drive, no loss of quality as it's copying digitally, and re-burned.
With mine I can only do this in real time, but it saves the recording.
Only material recorded with that machine can be saved in that fashion,
tho.

Of course I don't know what hardware/software you have, so none of these
suggestions may apply, but hopefully this may be of some small help.

Take care...
