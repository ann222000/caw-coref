Written by Tell Magazine

If all had worked according to plan, James Ibori, former governor of
oil-rich Delta State, would have become one of the most powerful and  influential men
in Nigeria today. Having generously oiled the wheels of  the presidential
campaign machinery of Umaru Yar’Adua, Ibori saw himself  as a kingmaker who
should call some shots in the new government. The  former governor, it was
gathered, demanded to be made minister in the  lucrative petroleum resources ministry.
He is also believed, at one point,  to have considered being minister of the
strategic federal capital  territory ministry. But apart from the need to be
paid back for his  substantial investment in the President’s campaign, Ibori’s
desire to be a  powerful member of the new administration was also for the
simple but  strategic reason of self-preservation.
The handsome and fabulously wealthy ex-governor knew that he had been  under
investigation for corruption by the Economic and Financial Crimes  Commission,
EFCC. For more than two years, the anti-corruption agency had  investigated
Ibori for allegedly looting Delta State treasury. Becoming a  powerful minister
in the government would have, at least for some time,  secured his freedom
from prosecution. So Ibori thought.
However, immediately he learnt of moves by the former governor to  become a
minister, Nuhu Ribadu, EFCC chairman, put paid to the scheme by  placing before
President Yar’Adua evidence of Ibori’s monumental looting  of his state’s
treasury.
Today, Ibori is neither a minister nor is he anywhere near the  corridors of
power. Rather, he is virtually a fugitive from the law. Ibori  and some
members of his family and associates are currently being embraced  by the long arms
of the law not only in Nigeria but also in Britain and  the United States, US.

At the time when the EFCC began the clampdown on former governors,  Ibori
found it convenient to flee to the US. Ordinarily, Britain, where he  has
investments, houses, luxury cars and a fat bank accounts, would have  been the
natural place to go. But he would most likely have been arrested  in that country as
the London Metropolitan Police has a strong case of  money laundering against
him. However, even America, his initial place of  succour, has become too hot
for him to stay. The magazine has learned that  he had to quickly take off
from the US and return to Nigeria a few weeks  ago after he got wind of the fact
that authorities in Florida had also  commenced investigations on him in a
money laundering case.
As Ibori made his way back home, he was believed to have instructed  Theresa,
his wife, and former first lady of Delta State, to also return  home from
Britain where she was staying. However, Theresa was arrested  October 1, 2007 as
she was waiting to board a plane to Nigeria. Her arrest  was in connection
with the Metropolitan Police’s money laundering  investigations against Ibori.
Already, three persons related to and used  by Ibori in laundering money have
been arrested in London and are  currently under restraining orders. These are
Adebimpe Pogoson, the  ex–governor’s personal assistant, Christine Ibori–Ibie,
his sister, and  Udoamaka Okoronkwo, a female associate believed to have had
a son for him.  Theresa, a British citizen, was arrested by men of the
Proceeds of  Corruption Unit of the Metropolitan Police but was granted bail.
However,  she is expected to report back to the police in London in January 2008 for
further questioning.
The investigations into alleged corruption and money laundering against
Ibori have been long drawn, involving security authorities in Nigeria,  South
Africa and Britain. And the magazine’s own investigations have  revealed that the
Metropolitan Police has virtually concluded its probe of  the former governor.
It not only has a watertight case against him, but is  in a position to
arrest and prosecute him.
A glimpse into the money  laundering case against Ibori in London is provided
in a witness’  statement supporting an application for a restraining order on
Ibori’s  investments and assets in Britain and other countries. Written by
Paul  Gardiner, a financial investigator employed by the Metropolitan Police to
unravel the web of the ex–governor’s money laundering schemes, the
statement, which was actually presented to the Southwark Crown Court in  order to
obtain a restraining order on Ibori’s assets, reveals not only  persons and
companies used by Ibori to launder monies amounting to over  N35 billion, but also
the circuitous route that the funds were made to  pass through to disguise
their sources.
Specifically, Ibori, who is being investigated for committing offences  under
the Proceeds of Crime Act under British law, allegedly criminally  stole
billions of naira when he was in government and laundered some of  same in Britain
“thereby committing offences under section 327 and 328 of  the Proceeds of
Crime Act 2002”.
Operating like an international crook versed in the art of money  laundering,
and using the likes of Pogoson, Okoronkwo, Ibori-Ibie and a  host of other
associates as well as offshore companies and fronts, the  former governor
allegedly stole funds through the award of often bogus or  often inflated contracts,
paid monies into the accounts of these people  who then transferred the funds
into designated accounts abroad. Following  a circuitous route, a lot of the
monies were then routed to accounts and  companies owned or controlled by
Ibori. To disguise the sources of the  funds, Ibori, through a firm of attorneys
in London, also created shell  companies in Gibraltar, British Virgin Islands,
Switzerland, Mauritius,  Panama and other remote parts of the world, to which
monies were paid so  that they could be legitimised through purchase of
properties and other  assets. These companies include Haleway Properties Limited,
registered in  Gibraltar, Teleton Quays Limited (in British Virgin Islands),
Erin  Aviation Limited (Mauritius), Stanhope Investment Limited (Polynesia),
Julex Foundation (Panama) and Parabola International Corp.  (Mauritius).
Documents at the Southwark Crown Court, London, showed that Ibori  devised a
simple method to launder the money he allegedly stole from Delta  State
coffers. For example, during his eight-year rule, cash and drafts  worth about £2
million were paid to Pogoson from Delta State accounts.  Money was paid into her
account in Asaba and Lagos, from where it was  electronically transferred
into the United Kingdom, UK, accounts of MER  Engineering, a company owned by the
former governor. Ibori was a director  in the company before he became
governor. However, since 1999, Pogoson has  been the sole signatory to the company’s
accounts. From MER’s UK account,  nearly $1.5 million was then electronically
transferred into the account  of a front company for the ex-governor,
Stanhope Investment, held at  Private Bank AG Geneva and other accounts held by him
in Switzerland.  Police forensic investigators from London discovered that
because of the  law in Nigeria which barred him from having foreign accounts,
Ibori opened  the account in the name of Stanhope in Switzerland, and through it,
he  paid for the purchase of an armour-plated Mercedes MayBach in April 2005.
He is known to have several such foreign accounts. Ibori coughed out  €
406,600 and had the vintage car shipped to his home in South Africa. It  was also
from this account that the ex–governor paid the initial deposit  of $4.7 million
for the purchase of a Bombardier Challenger jet, total  cost of which is put
at $20 million. He transferred the money in June 2005  to the account of
Parabola International Corp held in Zurich. The money  was then transferred into
the accounts of Arlington Shamas, Solicitor,  London, Ibori’s representatives,
for onward transfer to the aircraft  manufacturers.
Pogoson, who resides in London in a house owned by Ibori’s sister, was
arrested in April 2006 for money laundering charges but was released. She  was
further interrogated February this year, accused of holding many  accounts in
Nigeria with which she helped her boss launder money.
In the same dubious manner, Ibori, in the guise of awarding contracts  to
some companies, used his sister and Okoronkwo to loot Delta State funds  and
launder same abroad. Court documents in London and Nigeria show that  in February
2005, acting as a purchasing representative to Onovin Nigeria  Limited, a
Nigerian company owned by Vincent Uduaghan, younger brother to  Emmanuel Uduaghan,
current governor of Delta State, Ibori–Ibie, the  ex–governor’s sister,
received over N38 million ostensibly for the  procurement of running tracks for
stadia in the state from a German firm.  A total of £300,000 meant for the
purchase of the tracks was transferred  into Ibori-Ibie’s account with Barclays
Bank, London. However, an  inspection of her Barclays account showed that only a
total of £123,717.72  was paid to BSW, the German suppliers. The shortfall of
£176,182.26 is  believed to have been laundered for the former governor.
In the case of Okoronkwo, between May 26, 2005 and June 8, 2005, she
received about N105.5 million of Delta State government funds. The monies  were then
transferred into her HSBC account in London in three tranches —  £200,000 on
June I, 2005, £150,000 on June 14, 2005 and £200,000 on June  20, 2005. An
inspection of the account showed that some of the monies were  transferred to
Ibori and Terry Waya, a Nigerian businessman currently  serving a jail term in
Britain for money laundering, while there is also  evidence that properties and
other assets had been bought for Ibori from  funds in Okoronkwo’s HSBC account.
For example, on July 20, 2005,  Okoronkwo issued a cheque of £311,000 to
Arlington Sharmas Solicitors  which was used to purchase a house at 42, Great
Ground, Shaftsbury,  Dorset. The property was registered in the name of Teleton
Quays but is  used by Ibori and his wife.
It was discovered that Ibori had instructed Bhadresh Gohil, a partner  in
Arlington Sharmas, who was central to the incorporation of front  companies and l
egitimising laundered funds for the ex-governor, to  register Teleton Quays
and purchase the property in the company’s name.  Okoronkwo is also known to
have purchased another house in London at a  cost of £388,077.62 for Ibori in the
name of Boyd Properties. In all, over  £2 million have passed through
Okoronkwo’s HSBC account, most of it paid  directly into a London Barclays account
number 00115916 in the name of  James Ibori.
For the role they played in laundering money for Ibori, the trio of  Pogoson,
Ibori-Ibie and Okoronkwo are currently subject to restraint  proceedings in
London and, if found guilty of money laundering charges,  face jail sentences
of many years.
Yet, the British investigations have revealed even more startling
discoveries. Ibori, in late 2005, hatched a plot to legitimise some of his  allegedly
stolen and laundered money through the purchase of a Challenger  jet from
Bombardier. Since he knew that he could not directly send money  to the aircraft
manufacturers, as that would have immediately raised  questions in many quarters,
Ibori got Gohil to register companies to use  for the transaction and to make
payments for the jet. In December 2005,  Gohil, on behalf of Ibori, brokered
a purchase deal for the Challenger at  the cost of $20 million between Teleton
Quays and Bombardier. Gohil also  incorporated another company, Erin
Aviation, in Mauritius, which later  took over as the buyer from Teleton Quays. In
July 2005, four payments  totalling £4,788,176.92 were made from Ibori’s account
held in the name of  Stanhope into a Schrader Bank, Zurich account in the name
of Edward  Shemutete for Parabola International Corp. Shemutete is a known
international expert in money laundering and legitimising corruptly gotten
funds. He is currently under investigation in Zambia, his home country,  for
allegedly helping former President Frederick Chiluba launder money  abroad.
Investigators say that Shemutete was most likely fronting for Ibori as  he
was introduced to the bank by Gohil, the same man who acted for the  ex–governor
in many other businesses. On September 29, 2005, the money was  transferred
from the Parabola account into a Barclays Bank, London  account, which turned
out to be a client’s account held by Gohil’s law  firm, Arlington Shamas. The
firm later made the payment to Bombardier.
But there were more intriguing disclosures from the examination of the
Teleton/Bombardier deal. By July 2006, a total of $9,856,685.22 had been  paid for
the jet. A breakdown of the payment shows that apart from the  $4.788 million
paid by Stanhope/Parabola, Bombardier also received  $599,963.98 from Wings
Aviation Limited;  $899,805.96 from Erin  Aviation; $249,007.72 from Pamaron Oil
and Gas Limited; another  $899,896.68 from Wings Aviation and a last tranch
of $951,178.07 from Erin  Aviation. The entry of Wings Aviation makes the jet
purchase more  intriguing. Wings Aviation is registered in Nigeria as a charter
services  provider.
Interestingly, investigators found out through a letter written by  Gohil
that Stanhope Investment and Parabola International Corp, both  believed to be
owned by Ibori, were principal shareholders in Aviation  Development
Corporation, the parent company of Wings Aviation. The  investigators in London have
inferred that Ibori, through his offshore  companies, owns Wings Aviation and that
he also provided the monies paid  by the company for the Bombardier jet. The
investigators equally believe  that the agreement between Erin Aviation and
Bombardier is to be  terminated and the purchase price of $20 million returned.
The  investigators have moved to place a restraining order on the jet or
monies  returned by the manufacturers and are also asking for a restraining order
on houses, cars and accounts believed to be held by Ibori or his  proxies.
These include three houses in London and Dorset, four vintage cars (a
Bentley Continental GT, Mercedes MayBach, a Chrysler and a Jaguar) as well  as
several accounts held in his name and those of his front companies such  as
Stanhope Investments and Teleton Quays.
The London money laundering investigations on Ibori tell only one side  of
the story of this young man’s mindless looting of the funds kept in his  trust
when he was governor of Delta State. The investigations actually  derived from
investigations in Nigeria on Ibori spanning over two years by  the EFCC.
Although the EFCC had kept its investigations close to its  chest, it was forced to
come out with its findings after the Delta State  government took the
commission to court to restrain it, among other  things, from arresting or
prosecuting Ibori. In an affidavit deposed by  Yahaya Bello, the head of the team that
investigated the Ibori case, the  EFCC finally opened a can of worms on the ex–
governor’s looting ways. Many  of the EFCC findings better explain some of the
missing links in the  British authorities’ investigations. The EFCC
investigations uncovered  several questionable payments to companies,
Associates and aides of Ibori, running into billions of naira. For  example,
it was discovered that there were monthly lodgments of Delta  State cheques of
between five and seven million naira into the accounts of  Onovin Nigeria
Limited. Vincent Uduaghan, owner of the company, told  investigators that the
payments which totalled N350 million in five years  were for the supply of fuel
from Total Nigeria Limited in Benin, Edo  State. But Total, which did have a
fuel supply contract, denied having any  dealings with Onovin Nigeria Limited.
Furthermore, it was discovered that lodgments of up to N400 million  were
made from state accounts into the accounts of Ede Ogoro, private  secretary to
Ibori, and Charles Isiayei, chief accountant to Delta State  Government House.
It was also revealed that these two men also made  several cash lodgments
running into billions of naira from “security  votes” of the state into the
accounts of companies controlled by or  connected with Ibori. These include Koln
Nigeria Limited, Silhouette  Travels, Prime Chambers, MER Engineering Limited and
Bainenox.
Another interesting discovery was that part of the money paid from  Nigeria
for the purchase of the Challenger jet was one million dollars by  Pamaron Oil
and Gas through Fidelity Bank.
The EFCC investigations also showed how Ibori bought into several  companies
in Nigeria, including recently privatised state ones using  proxies to
disguise the source of funds. For example, the National  Fertiliser Company, NAFCON,
was acquired in 2005 by O-Secul Nigeria  Limited owned by Mike Orugbo for $152
million. Orugbo was able to raise  only $2 million but, curiously, the
company was able to raise the balance  from Oceanic Bank with which it had no prior
relationship. The bank later  received a total of $46 million to acquire 39
per cent of NAFCON from  Copex Management Service, the same company that paid
money to Arlington  Sharmas on behalf of Erin Aviation for the purchase of the
Bombardier jet.  This time, Copex paid the money on behalf of Nortore
Mauritius. This  company has been found to belong to a group of foreign investors two
of  who were brought into the deal by Arlington Sharmas, Ibori’s UK solicitor
friend.
Oceanic Bank received a further N4.418 billion from Brisbane Limited,  owned
by Henry Imasekha, a known friend and associate of Ibori, for 13 per  cent of
the fertiliser company. Probes into the money paid by Brisbane  only opened a
new vista of Ibori’s thievery. It was discovered that, in  2001, Imasekha had
secured a N2.2 billion loan from New Nigeria Bank to  buy 10 per cent shares
in Econet Nigeria Limited. There was no evidence  that he had a relationship
with the bank. Curiously, a few weeks later,  the Delta State government bought
off five per cent of Imasekha’s shares  for N2.5 billion. This money was used
by the businessman to pay off the  bank loan. But he still had N300 million as
well as five per cent of  Econet shares. The money used in paying for Brisbane
’s 13 per cent shares  in NAFCON came from the proceeds of the sale of
Imasekha’s remaining  shares in Econet.
Imasekha is believed to be a front for Ibori. The EFCC also alleged  that
Ibori used several companies to divert N5 billion from Delta State  coffers into
the purchase of shares from Afribank. The commission claims  that the entire
money had been recovered and returned to the state  government. Ibori is also
alleged to have similarly invested in high net  worth portfolios, including
Wilbros Nigeria Limited, among others.
The accusations against Ibori are, indeed, grave. They constitute the  most
brazen and monumental case of looting by any former state chief  executive. And
there is not one of these allegations that the ex-governor  is unaware of.
There is proof obtained from some of his arrested  associates that he has
actually made efforts to suppress potentially  incriminating evidence. Beyond this,
Ibori has also played a game of  survival by using his understanding of the
nation’s political system to  escape the law. Many believe he has an ally in
Michael Aondoakaa, the  attorney-general and minister of justice. Aondoakaa’s
attitude towards the  fight against corruption is, perhaps, better understood
against the  background of his having crossed the path of the commission in the
past.  As one of the counsel to the Benue State government in its action
against  the EFCC, the state government was asking the court to declare the
commission an illegal body and that it had no right to investigate  corruption cases
against any official of the state. That case was recently  decided in favour
of the EFCC. Ibori’s first strategy was to buy time from  prosecution by
orchestrating the removal of Ribadu.
The magazine learnt that as soon as Yar A’dua came into office, Ibori  and
others recruited by him put pressure on the President to remove the  EFCC boss.
Their story was that Ribadu had thoroughly messed up and lost  respect among
Nigerians for allowing former President Olusegun Obasanjo to  use him for
political battles. If he is to be taken seriously about  fighting corruption, then
Ribadu would have to go, the President was told.
Having failed in this mission, Ibori and others who were afraid of  Ribadu
reportedly banded with Aondoakaa whom they knew had a grouse  against the EFCC
and its helmsman. To incapacitate the commission, a plot  was hatched to remove
its prosecutorial powers. Aondoakaa briefed Yar’Adua  and soon presented a
formal letter requesting to direct all prosecutions  by the EFCC, Independent
Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences  Commission, ICPC, and the Code of
Conduct Bureau, CCB.
It was curious  that the attorney-general was interested in only these three
agencies  connected with the prosecution of corrupt governors. However, the
fallacy  of his action was soon exposed when the President reportedly got
superior  legal advice from respected legal icons. Aondoakaa was forced by a
thoroughly embarrassed President to reverse a decision he had announced to  the
whole world.
But Aondoakaa has not stopped acting on behalf of the same people that  his
office should be willing to prosecute if there is a case against them.  The
attorney-general forcefully took over the prosecution of the EFCC’s  case against
Orji Kalu, former governor of Abia State, based on a  purported restraining
order on the EFCC. However, Femi Falana, a  Lagos-based lawyer, speaking to
TELL in Lagos last week, said there was no  such court order.
Aondoakaa has also incurred the wrath of many Nigerians, particularly
lawyers, for attempting to extricate Ibori from the restraint proceedings  in a
London court. The Southwark Crown Court in London had on August 2,  2007 frozen
Ibori’s assets around the world estimated at about $35  million. But the freeze
order was lifted on October 2, 2007 after Speechly  Bircham, Ibori’s lawyer,
presented to the court a letter written by  Aondoakaa stating that the former
governor was under no investigation in  Nigeria. It was gathered that Bircham
had written to the attorney-general  to inquire if Ibori was under
investigation. Without reference to the  EFCC, ICPC, CCB or any other investigating agency
in the country,  Aondoakaa wrote back to the lawyer saying Ibori was not
under any  investigation. Significantly, as pointed out by a lawyer, Aondoakaa
also  said in his letter that as attorney-general, he had not requested for
assistance in investigating Ibori as required under the mutual legal  assistance
programme between Nigeria and Britain. This, more than any  other factor, let
Ibori off the hook. But that victory was only temporary  for the former
governor as another court has reinstated the freeze order  on his assets. Aondoakaa
was said to have initially denied writing any  letter to Ibori’s lawyer until
the controversial letter was published on  the Internet.
Perhaps, embarrassed by the seeming tardiness with which his government  has
prosecuting the war against corruption, President Yar’Adua directed  the
attorney-general to cooperate with the British investigating  authority. Again,
curiously, at a lawyers’ conference in Singapore, he  announced the setting up of
a special anti-corruption unit in his  office.
In a related development, Aondoakaa, the magazine learnt, has also been
putting pressure on the CCB to withdraw from his office about 18 case  files
submitted in relation to corruption cases against former governors.  Many Nigerians
have blamed President Yar’Adua for attempting to protect  Ibori and other
former governors from prosecution. But the President’s  attitude to his former
colleagues is said to be that he did not tell  anybody to steal state funds to
fund his campaign and that, in any case,  he personally received no money from
any of them; so there are no  entanglements for him. Even sources in the
anti-corruption agencies  confirm that the President has never interfered with
their investigations  of the former state chief executives. What has happened, it
is said, is  that some people have exploited the President’s natural
disposition to do  things by the book — to follow due process — to sell the new mantra
of  “rule of law” to him in order to slow down the momentum of the
anti-corruption campaign.
As it is now, none of these strategies has worked for Ibori who is now  on
the run from the law in Britain and America. Soon, with the setting  aside of
the restraining order on the EFCC to do its job, Ibori’s days as  a free man may
be numbered.
