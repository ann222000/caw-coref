My '90 developed a problem today that occurred once before (approx 3
months ago) but "fixed itself" before I could troubleshoot it. The
symptoms are huge amounts of white smoke blowing out the tailpipe and
very rough running. Smells like raw gas. The gas gage moved considerably
as I was trying to diagnose this.

The number two spark plug is pretty much saturated in gas. Swapped it
out with number 1 and the problem stays with the cylinder (it's not a
bad plug). I thought it might be the coil pack, but the amount of gas is
significant;  I don't think having spark would make any difference with
all that fuel.

I am planning to pull the fuel rail with the injectors attached (as
suggested in the shop manual) and see what happens when I test them. I
suspect that the problem is an injector that is leaking significantly
(in cylinder #2).

Any comments or suggestions from the group? If my suspicions are
correct, then it is almost a certainty that others have seen the same
issue. And if it's not the injector...stop me now!

Thanks,

Ken

My god, how much fuel can you be talking about that, having a spark wouldn't
make a difference? That seems totally nonsensical to me. I mean, your
injector is squirting fuel in there every time the plug is supposed to fire.
If it doesn't fire, there will surely be gas buildup which, correct me if
I'm wrong, one spark can pretty much take care of just about ANY amount of
gas real quick. Sounds to me like a coilpack problem or a worthless plug
wire. Did you try switching plug wires (careful)?

Could it be a totally defunct lifter or something along those lines?
How many miles does your engine have on it?

As far as the injector, your thinking it might be spraying a steady stream
all the time instead of properly pulsing?

That's the thought. That's why I am looking at the procedure in the shop

I'll try to keep this short and invite comments. Sad to say:  it appears
to have "fixed itself".

I did the injector test. Wired the injectors to the fuel rail,
disconnected their plugs and pulled them free from the engine;  jumpered
the F/P to GND connections in the diagnostic connector and had an
assistant turn the key.

You could see the tension on the assembly as the fuel pump kicked in.
But nary a drop of petrol was to be seen on any of the four injectors.

Looking at the wiring diagram revealed something that probably everyone
in the Miata community except me already knew. We all know that each
spark plug fires twice, during the power cycle and the exhaust cycle. If
I recall correctly, Mazda did this to ensure proper burning of the
exhaust gases. What I didn't know, but it makes sense, is that fuel is
injected for both "top of the cylinder" events (power and exhaust).

How do I know this? Because the wiring diagram clearly shows the fuel
injectors for the #1 and #3 cylinders wired in parallel. The #2 and #4
cylinders are similarly wired.

And that brings me to the bit of investigation that I missed. I pulled
the #1 plug and it looked pretty much OK. I then pulled the #2 plug and
it was soaked with gasoline. Then (and this is the mistake part)I
stopped pulling spark plugs. Had I continued, there is a good chance
that I may have found plug #4 to have been similarly affected.

I realized this once the injectors passed their leak test. I pulled the
#4 plug, it looked like it had a bunch of carbon on it, but no gas. Of
course, the car had not run for over a day, so the gas may have
evaporated. I then put everything back together to see what would happen
next. Had the rough running and dumping of fuel through the system
continued, I could have pulled all four plugs to see what's what.

But, of course, the car started and ran fine.

I don't know all that much about fuel injectors. Can they be commanded
"on" all the time? If so:  I am thinking it may be a problem with the
ECU. Why? Because it comes and goes. I could imagine an injector that
sometimes fails to inject. How about an injector that sometimes always
injects. Does that make sense?

So if someone would like to suggest something other than the ECU, I am
all ears. I haven't seen anything written about a problem like this, but
perhaps someone else had a similar experience.

Thanks!

Ken

It wouldn't hurt to clean all of the chassis ground points until the
metal is shiny. You can search miata.net for their locations. Flaky
grounds can make the ECU wonky. (The usual early sign of grounding
problems is a jumpy tach, but who knows?)

Thanks, Lanny. Can't hurt. I did search and didn't find much. Can you
suggest a search term? I tried "ground", "grounding", "electrical
ground". I even tried "shiny". Zip.

I recall seeing this written at one time or another, but it isn't
showing up.

I had what may have been a similar problem on my '93 ( now 186k and
rolling).

It would occasionally load up with gas and run very rough. It would
generally only happen after it had been running a short while, was
stopped for a few minutes, then restarted. It would be flooded when
trying to restart, then would take a while to burn the cylinders clean.

I also thought that I had leaking fuel injectors, so had my local
garage run a fuel system cleaner through. This was not a can of
additive that is put in the gas. This was a closed type system that is
probably the same cleaner that is used by the injector cleaner/rebuild
services, but is done on/in car.

That may have helped things, but the problem would still occur.
I manually read the error codes, and half the electronic system had
errors. So I think Lanny's note about cleaning grounds is appropriate.
I checked and cleaned all engine compartment grounds and ...
I used good quality electrical cleaner, and heavily cleaned all
connectors between the CAS and the coil packs.  Also cleaned the
connectors on the ECU itself.

That did the trick.

Now if it gets a little rough, I spay down the coil packs and
connectors, and have not had the problem since.

The primary circuits (trigger) to the coil packs are near the bottom of
the packs, and partially exposed. It is a good place for oil, dirt, and
grease to accumulate. Add a little moisture, and strange firing can be
expected. Spray heavily with the electrical cleaner to get the junk
off, and ensure that the connections are clean.

Note, there are a few types of electrical cleaner. Some have lubricant
in them and are designed for switches and rheostats. Do NOT use this
type. Also make sure that the cleaner is safe for plastics and rubber.
No reason to create more problems.

Good luck.

Thanks, Mike

Here is the latest:

I have been driving the car all week without incident. The more I think
about it, the more I am convinced that the problem was a stuck fuel
injector. I suspect that my messing around with them freed up what was
probably a stuck armature.

So if it occurs again, the first course of action is to do a little
percussion on the fuel injector at the #2 cylinder. I strongly suspect
that will fix the problem. I will probably not wait and swap out the
injector.

I will look into the grounds. I found a few others that I cleaned and
re-attached.

I have the same problem.  I have a 90 miata with 177K miles.  I have

Hi Sam,

Sorry this response is taking so long;  I haven't monitored this
newsgroup for several days.

When I pulled the fuel rail to check the injectors, the injectors were
OK. They remained OK when I re-installed them and are so to this day. So
the problem, unfortunately, "cured itself".

The big question:  is the problem caused by a sticking fuel injector
armature or is the ECU commanding the injector "on" all the time? When
you pulled the plug (which was a very good diagnostic technique), the
problem went away and returned when you reconnected it. That means that
the injector remained closed when you had the plug disconnected;
suggesting the ECU is the source of the problem.

In your Miata, however, the #3 and #1 injectors are activated at the
same time. Therefore, an ECU failure such as that described would affect
both injectors, not just one.

So it does not look like an ECU problem. Thanks, by the way, for doing this.

There might be some sort of friction in the injector that keeps the
armature from returning to closure between fuel impulses. Once you
remove the drive, however, the spring eventually brings the armature to
the unactivated position and the valve is closed.

My next step, when the problem occurs again, would be to perform a
little percussion on the injector to see if it becomes "unstuck". That
means I would tap it or, depending on how you measure force, beat on it
a little.

I bought some used injectors off of eBay and am awaiting their arrival.
What I will probably do is chicken out and replace the #2 (in my case)
injector with one of them and see what happens.

Depending on how the injector is constructed, I may do a failure
analysis on the suspect part. I am actually in the business of doing FA,
so it might be fun.

Good luck with your problem. Keep us posted. I promise to read more often.

Hi Ken,

I got my fuel injector unstuck and the car is running normal again.  I
used a 12mm wrench and gently tapped on the bad injector and that did
the trick.  No more white smoke and fuel consumption is normal again.
With all the unburned fuel going thru the oxygen sensor and catalyst
converter, i think they might have been damaged.  How are your oxygen
sensor and catalyst converter working after the stuck fuel injector
started to work again?

Also, I found some companies that we can send our fuel injectors in to
be clean/rebuilt.  It sounds better than buying brand new which can
cost up to $100 each injector.   Here's a video from youtube that
shows how they clean fuel injector.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUPqrgZdIU8

It costs around $50 to $80 for four injector cleaning/rebuilt.  I plan
to do this for my miata before I take it in for smog test this fall.
This is the company I plan to use.

http://www.accurateis.com/

there are others I found like the one on the video but they're in the
east coast.  I plan to use the company closest to my state for cheap
shipping.

&gt;&gt; problem went away and returned when you reconnected it. That means that
&gt;&gt; theinjectorremained closed when you had the plug disconnected;
&gt;&gt; suggesting the ECU is the source of the problem.

&gt;&gt; In yourMiata, however, the #3 and #1 injectors are activated at the
&gt;&gt; same time. Therefore, an ECU failure such as that described would affect
&gt;&gt; both injectors, not just one.

&gt;&gt; So it does not look like an ECU problem. Thanks, by the way, for doing this.

&gt;&gt; There might be some sort of friction in theinjectorthat keeps the
&gt;&gt; armature from returning to closure betweenfuelimpulses. Once you
&gt;&gt; remove the drive, however, the spring eventually brings the armature to
&gt;&gt; the unactivated position and the valve is closed.

&gt;&gt; My next step, when the problem occurs again, would be to perform a
&gt;&gt; little percussion on theinjectorto see if it becomes &quot;unstuck&quot;. That
&gt;&gt; means I would tap it or, depending on how you measure force, beat on it
&gt;&gt; a little.

&gt;&gt; I bought some used injectors off of eBay and am awaiting their arrival.
&gt;&gt; What I will probably do is chicken out and replace the #2 (in my case)injectorwith one of them and see what happens.

&gt;&gt; Depending on how theinjectoris constructed, I may do a failure
&gt;&gt; analysis on the suspect part. I am actually in the business of doing FA,
&gt;&gt; so it might be fun.

&gt;&gt; Good luck with your problem. Keep us posted. I promise to read more often.

&gt; Hi Ken,

&gt; I got my fuel injector unstuck and the car is running normal again.  I
&gt; used a 12mm wrench and gently tapped on the bad injector and that did
&gt; the trick.  No more white smoke and fuel consumption is normal again.
&gt; With all the unburned fuel going thru the oxygen sensor and catalyst
&gt; converter, i think they might have been damaged.  How are your oxygen
&gt; sensor and catalyst converter working after the stuck fuel injector
&gt; started to work again?

&gt; Also, I found some companies that we can send our fuel injectors in to
&gt; be clean/rebuilt.  It sounds better than buying brand new which can
&gt; cost up to $100 each injector.   Here's a video from youtube that
&gt; shows how they clean fuel injector.

&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUPqrgZdIU8

&gt; It costs around $50 to $80 for four injector cleaning/rebuilt.  I plan
&gt; to do this for my miata before I take it in for smog test this fall.
&gt; This is the company I plan to use.

&gt; http://www.accurateis.com/

&gt; there are others I found like the one on the video but they're in the
&gt; east coast.  I plan to use the company closest to my state for cheap
&gt; shipping.

Hi Sam,

Thanks for doing the test that I planned to do when the injector hangs
up again. You clearly identified the problem as being with the injector.
And, you saved me some work.

I also have a concern about the catalytic converter. The O2 sensor
didn't appear to be bothered by this;  the car runs great. I'll know
more about the converter when emission testing rolls around again.

I suppose that cleaning the injectors makes sense. The reason yours (and
mine) hung up is probably due to sludge of some sort from the fuel. So
they probably force something other than gasoline through them that
cleans them up. Ultrasonic cleaning is certainly effective.

You can probably do something similar by putting them into an
appropriate solvent and exercising the coil. The action of the armature
going back and forth will likely agitate the solvent internally and
break the crap free. One way to tell would probably be to put the
injector into a clean beaker of solvent, pulse the coil and see if
anything disgusting comes out the ends. Whatever doesn't get cleaned out
by this method will likely be gone when fuel starts through again.

I bought four used injectors off of eBay. I paid like $35 for the
injectors and shipping. One course of action is to send them to the
place you noted, pay the $80 and then swap out the ones currently in the
car after they come back. Another is to do it myself. Thanks also for
doing this research.

All the best,

Ken

Hi Ken,

I made this short video when my miata had the stuck fuel injector.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__d-nKRLIQ8

notice the white smoke, the unburned fuel coming out of the tail, and
the rough sound on idle.

Were those your symptons as well?

I did tried to bid on ebay for some used fuel injectors.  I didn't
win.  I don't have time to stay up with the bid.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good luck and keep us informed
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Ken,
&gt;&gt;&gt; I got myfuelinjectorunstuck and the car is running normal again.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt; used a 12mm wrench and gently tapped on the badinjectorand that did
&gt;&gt;&gt; the trick.  No more white smoke andfuelconsumption is normal again.
&gt;&gt;&gt; With all the unburnedfuelgoing thru the oxygen sensor and catalyst
&gt;&gt;&gt; converter, i think they might have been damaged.  How are your oxygen
&gt;&gt;&gt; sensor and catalyst converter working after thestuckfuelinjector
&gt;&gt;&gt; started to work again?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, I found some companies that we can send ourfuelinjectors in to
&gt;&gt;&gt; be clean/rebuilt.  It sounds better than buying brand new which can
&gt;&gt;&gt; cost up to $100 eachinjector.   Here's a video from youtube that
&gt;&gt;&gt; shows how they cleanfuelinjector.
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUPqrgZdIU8
&gt;&gt;&gt; It costs around $50 to $80 for fourinjectorcleaning/rebuilt.  I plan
&gt;&gt;&gt; to do this for mymiatabefore I take it in for smog test this fall.
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is the company I plan to use.
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.accurateis.com/
&gt;&gt;&gt; there are others I found like the one on the video but they're in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; east coast.  I plan to use the company closest to my state for cheap
&gt;&gt;&gt; shipping.
&gt;&gt; Hi Sam,

&gt;&gt; Thanks for doing the test that I planned to do when theinjectorhangs
&gt;&gt; up again. You clearly identified the problem as being with theinjector.
&gt;&gt;   And, you saved me some work.

&gt;&gt; I also have a concern about the catalytic converter. The O2 sensor
&gt;&gt; didn't appear to be bothered by this;  the car runs great. I'll know
&gt;&gt; more about the converter when emission testing rolls around again.

&gt;&gt; I suppose that cleaning the injectors makes sense. The reason yours (and
&gt;&gt; mine) hung up is probably due to sludge of some sort from thefuel. So
&gt;&gt; they probably force something other than gasoline through them that
&gt;&gt; cleans them up. Ultrasonic cleaning is certainly effective.

&gt;&gt; You can probably do something similar by putting them into an
&gt;&gt; appropriate solvent and exercising the coil. The action of the armature
&gt;&gt; going back and forth will likely agitate the solvent internally and
&gt;&gt; break the crap free. One way to tell would probably be to put theinjectorinto a clean beaker of solvent, pulse the coil and see if
&gt;&gt; anything disgusting comes out the ends. Whatever doesn't get cleaned out
&gt;&gt; by this method will likely be gone whenfuelstarts through again.

&gt;&gt; I bought four used injectors off of eBay. I paid like $35 for the
&gt;&gt; injectors and shipping. One course of action is to send them to the
&gt;&gt; place you noted, pay the $80 and then swap out the ones currently in the
&gt;&gt; car after they come back. Another is to do it myself. Thanks also for
&gt;&gt; doing this research.

&gt;&gt; All the best,

&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt; Hi Ken,

&gt; I made this short video when my miata had the stuck fuel injector.

&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__d-nKRLIQ8

&gt; notice the white smoke, the unburned fuel coming out of the tail, and
&gt; the rough sound on idle.

&gt; Were those your symptons as well?

&gt; I did tried to bid on ebay for some used fuel injectors.  I didn't
&gt; win.  I don't have time to stay up with the bid.

&gt; Sam

That looks like it, Sam. When you rev the engine, big clouds of white
smoke came out, right? I also had the puddle of gas that you see on the
ground below the tailpipe.

Yep...that looks like it.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Sam,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry this response is taking so long;  I haven't monitored this
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroup for several days.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When I pulled thefuelrail to check the injectors, the injectors were
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OK. They remained OK when I re-installed them and are so to this day. So
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the problem, unfortunately, &quot;cured itself&quot;.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   The big question:  is the problem caused by a stickingfuelinjector
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; armature or is the ECU commanding theinjector&quot;on&quot; all the time? When
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you pulled the plug (which was a very good diagnostic technique), the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem went away and returned when you reconnected it. That means that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theinjectorremained closed when you had the plug disconnected;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suggesting the ECU is the source of the problem.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In yourMiata, however, the #3 and #1 injectors are activated at the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same time. Therefore, an ECU failure such as that described would affect
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; both injectors, not just one.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So it does not look like an ECU problem. Thanks, by the way, for doing this.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There might be some sort of friction in theinjectorthat keeps the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; armature from returning to closure betweenfuelimpulses. Once you
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; remove the drive, however, the spring eventually brings the armature to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the unactivated position and the valve is closed.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My next step, when the problem occurs again, would be to perform a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little percussion on theinjectorto see if it becomes &quot;unstuck&quot;. That
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; means I would tap it or, depending on how you measure force, beat on it
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a little.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I bought some used injectors off of eBay and am awaiting their arrival.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What I will probably do is chicken out and replace the #2 (in my case)injectorwith one of them and see what happens.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Depending on how theinjectoris constructed, I may do a failure
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; analysis on the suspect part. I am actually in the business of doing FA,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so it might be fun.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good luck with your problem. Keep us posted. I promise to read more often.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same time. Therefore, an ECU failure such as that described would affect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; both injectors, not just one.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So it does not look like an ECU problem. Thanks, by the way, for doing this.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There might be some sort of friction in theinjectorthat keeps the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; armature from returning to closure betweenfuelimpulses. Once you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; remove the drive, however, the spring eventually brings the armature to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the unactivated position and the valve is closed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My next step, when the problem occurs again, would be to perform a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little percussion on theinjectorto see if it becomes &quot;unstuck&quot;. That
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; means I would tap it or, depending on how you measure force, beat on it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a little.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I bought some used injectors off of eBay and am awaiting their arrival.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What I will probably do is chicken out and replace the #2 (in my case)injectorwith one of them and see what happens.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Depending on how theinjectoris constructed, I may do a failure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; analysis on the suspect part. I am actually in the business of doing FA,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so it might be fun.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good luck with your problem. Keep us posted. I promise to read more often.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 gallons will be used up in about 10 minutes just on idle.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was told I have a blown head gasket by couple of mechanics.  However,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my car never overheat or lose any coolant.  Oil and coolant are ok.  No
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oil in the coolant and no coolant in the oil which is the symptons of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blown head gasket.  I checked all my spark plugs, 3 out of 4 are ok but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on # 3 cylinder, the spark plug is covered by unburnedfuel.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disconnected the wire off thefuelinjectoron the # 3 cylinder which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; left me to run on only 3 cylinder.  Leaving the wire unplugged on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fuelinjectoron # 3 cylinder, I ran the engine no more white smoke.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Turned engine off and plugged the wire back on the # 3 cylinder and ran
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the engine again, white smoke came back.  I think I have bad/stuckfuel

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks, Mike
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here is the latest:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have been driving the car all week without incident. The more I think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about it, the more I am convinced that the problem was astuckfuel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; injector. I suspect that my messing around with them freed up what was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probably astuckarmature.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So if it occurs again, the first course of action is to do a little
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; percussion on thefuelinjectorat the #2 cylinder. I strongly suspect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that will fix the problem. I will probably not wait and swap out the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; injector.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I will look into the grounds. I found a few others that I cleaned and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; re-attached.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It wouldn't hurt to clean all of the chassis ground points until the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; metal is shiny. You can searchmiata.net for their locations. Flaky
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grounds can make the ECU wonky. (The usual early sign of grounding
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problems is a jumpy tach, but who knows?)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  I have found this corroded ground connection point to be at fault of many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ground problems. http://home.new.rr.com/my91miata/Grounds.jpg
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A search on www.miata.netwillprovidemany such discussions on this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; subject.  I am a bit surprised that changing out the coil pack for 2 and 4
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't cure the problem. Other common ground points on a 1990 would include
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the negative battery cable connections, the earth (ground) strap on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; drivers side of the engine that grounds the engine to the body, and there is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one more under the car, a strap bolted to the Power Plant Frame near the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; back.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My 91 had ground gremlins that would shut off thefuelpump.  I'm not sure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cleaning the grounds will cure things in this case, but it is a very cheap
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and quick preventive maintenance that might very well save some grief in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; future.  Many have moved the ground cluster that I have pictured, to a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; higher spot on the firewall to keep it out of the slop that tends to collect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in that area.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good luck and keep us informed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Ken,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I got myfuelinjectorunstuck and the car is running normal again.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; used a 12mm wrench and gently tapped on the badinjectorand that did
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the trick.  No more white smoke andfuelconsumption is normal again.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With all the unburnedfuelgoing thru the oxygen sensor and catalyst
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; converter, i think they might have been damaged.  How are your oxygen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sensor and catalyst converter working after thestuckfuelinjector
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; started to work again?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, I found some companies that we can send ourfuelinjectors in to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be clean/rebuilt.  It sounds better than buying brand new which can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cost up to $100 eachinjector.   Here's a video from youtube that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shows how they cleanfuelinjector.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUPqrgZdIU8
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It costs around $50 to $80 for fourinjectorcleaning/rebuilt.  I plan
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do this for mymiatabefore I take it in for smog test this fall.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is the company I plan to use.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.accurateis.com/
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there are others I found like the one on the video but they're in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; east coast.  I plan to use the company closest to my state for cheap
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shipping.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Sam,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for doing the test that I planned to do when theinjectorhangs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up again. You clearly identified the problem as being with theinjector.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   And, you saved me some work.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I also have a concern about the catalytic converter. The O2 sensor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't appear to be bothered by this;  the car runs great. I'll know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more about the converter when emission testing rolls around again.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose that cleaning the injectors makes sense. The reason yours (and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mine) hung up is probably due to sludge of some sort from thefuel. So
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they probably force something other than gasoline through them that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cleans them up. Ultrasonic cleaning is certainly effective.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can probably do something similar by putting them into an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appropriate solvent and exercising the coil. The action of the armature
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going back and forth will likely agitate the solvent internally and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; break the crap free. One way to tell would probably be to put theinjectorinto a clean beaker of solvent, pulse the coil and see if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything disgusting comes out the ends. Whatever doesn't get cleaned out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by this method will likely be gone whenfuelstarts through again.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I bought four used injectors off of eBay. I paid like $35 for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; injectors and shipping. One course of action is to send them to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; place you noted, pay the $80 and then swap out the ones currently in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; car after they come back. Another is to do it myself. Thanks also for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doing this research.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All the best,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Ken,
&gt;&gt;&gt; I made this short video when mymiatahad thestuckfuelinjector.
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__d-nKRLIQ8
&gt;&gt;&gt; notice the white smoke, the unburnedfuelcoming out of the tail, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; the rough sound on idle.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Were those your symptons as well?
&gt;&gt;&gt; I did tried to bid on ebay for some usedfuelinjectors.  I didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; win.  I don't have time to stay up with the bid.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sam
&gt;&gt; That looks like it, Sam. When you rev the engine, big clouds of white
&gt;&gt; smoke came out, right? I also had the puddle of gas that you see on the
&gt;&gt; ground below the tailpipe.

&gt;&gt; Yep...that looks like it.

&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt; Yep lots of white smoke when I rev the engine.   It was hard to
