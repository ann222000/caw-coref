I woke up, I'm not sure when, because my hip hurt.  I took Tylenol last
night.  I should have taken the extra-strength stuff.

I &quot;slept&quot; a little because I had a dream.  I dreamed that I was on a bus - I
ride them all the time - I hollered out - as I should - that I need the
wheelchair at the next stop.  The driver didn't stop.  It was the bus I take
often.  This guy didn't stop.  I tapped him on the shoulder while he was
driving.  He didn't look around.  He was wearing headphones - he couldn't
hear me (i.e., my doctors don't listen to me or do what I think they should)
The bus kept going.  I saw there was a different driver.  He said the bus I
was on was a route 2.  The first bus was a route 41.  I never got off (life
is taking me places over which I have no control.)

The biggest non emotional problem I gave right now is sleep apnea and
physically blocked nasal passages.  I'm exhausted.  I feel like crap.

We went to a movie and dinner last night.  I had difficulty cutting my food.
I have a neuropathy that is getting worse.  My hand and grip strength are
getting much weaker.  This is the first time this has happened.  In fairness
to the food last night, the broccoli was very crisp, but I am having
increasing trouble cutting food.  I feel like crap.

I've been up for about twenty minutes, had to go to the bathroom.  I fed the
cats, typed this and am going back to bed.  Before I do the latter I have to
inject some more God-awful saline solution into my nose.  I feel like crap
and my life sucks.

Thanks for listening.

Cheers

Dear Info,

Sorry life sucks for you right now. I have no words of wisdom but do wish you
peace and healing. Feel better soon! (((((Info)))))
