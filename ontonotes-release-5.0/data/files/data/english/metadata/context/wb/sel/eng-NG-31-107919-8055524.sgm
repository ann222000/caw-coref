I do not think Sebass should have dug in on Doornbos like that, especially
at that time.

The fact is that Sebass was frustrated, and got a good taste of what a
professional driver can do in front you.

Without question, doornbos is a really well trained driver, and that makes
him REALLY hard to pass.

And, with the rain, and the conditions, a rather wide apex is going to taken
on most corners.

I always admired and respected Sebass talent. He likely one of the best
drivers we seen in champ car. However, I was disappointed he choose that
time to rant….

It almost like the case with Alonso and Hamilton. Alonso is kind of coming
apart at the seams due to being used to wining, and having someone like
Hamilton (who is supposed to be a newcomer and a no-body, and is beating
him).

Doornbos is new comer also, and to Sebass, it kind of like who the heck are
you?

Fact is, Doornbos was not making rotten racing moves to block. He certainly
was making his car wide on those corners!!!

Well, we sure as the heck have one hell of  driver and team rivalry on our
hands…don’t we!!

I actually enjoying this!!!

And, while the start of the race was a absolute disaster, the track, the
rain, the change of drivers, and some super passes (like the one Will put on
Sebass).

You know, the race started out like ugly dog, but man…did it deliver some
racing and excitement.

In fact, I jumped out of my chair more then once, and I did not even do that
in Cleavland.

In fact, it been years since I jumped out of my chair with emotion and
excitement.

Golly…after all was said and done…it really was good race….

And, we got more then just a points fight...we have a drivers and team fight
too!!!

Drive like what, Sebastian? AHEAD of the reigning champ?

First of all, Seabass, you have to be actually *close* to making a passing
attempt in order for Robert to block you. You weren't so he couldn't. What
were you expecting Doornbos to do, blue-flag himself and let you go by?

And even if he had even you came close to making a passing attempt, &quot;Bad
Bobby D&quot; was just letting you in on what's it like to race in F1. So if you
don't like it here, you won't like it where you came from.

Seabass was out of line.  He didn't increase the value of his stock and

Loon this:

June 30, 2007
BY JAMES M. TAYLOR

In his new book, The Assault on Reason, Al Gore pleads, &quot;We must stop
tolerating the rejection and distortion of science. We must insist on an
end to the cynical use of pseudo-studies known to be false for the
purpose of intentionally clouding the public's ability to discern the
truth.&quot; Gore repeatedly asks that science and reason displace cynical
political posturing as the central focus of public discourse.
If Gore really means what he writes, he has an opportunity to make a
difference by leading by example on the issue of global warming.

A cooperative and productive discussion of global warming must be open
and honest regarding the science. Global warming threats ought to be
studied and mitigated, and they should not be deliberately exaggerated
as a means of building support for a desired political position.

Many of the assertions Gore makes in his movie, ''An Inconvenient
Truth,'' have been refuted by science, both before and after he made
them. Gore can show sincerity in his plea for scientific honesty by
publicly acknowledging where science has rebutted his claims.

For example, Gore claims that Himalayan glaciers are shrinking and
global warming is to blame. Yet the September 2006 issue of the American
Meteorological Society's Journal of Climate reported, &quot;Glaciers are
growing in the Himalayan Mountains, confounding global warming alarmists
who recently claimed the glaciers were shrinking and that global warming
was to blame.&quot;

Gore claims the snowcap atop Africa's Mt. Kilimanjaro is shrinking and
that global warming is to blame. Yet according to the November 23, 2003,
issue of Nature magazine, &quot;Although it's tempting to blame the ice loss
on global warming, researchers think that deforestation of the
mountain's foothills is the more likely culprit. Without the forests'
humidity, previously moisture-laden winds blew dry. No longer
replenished with water, the ice is evaporating in the strong equatorial
sunshine.&quot;

Gore claims global warming is causing more tornadoes. Yet the United
Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated in February
that there has been no scientific link established between global
warming and tornadoes.

Gore claims global warming is causing more frequent and severe
hurricanes. However, hurricane expert Chris Landsea published a study on
May 1 documenting that hurricane activity is no higher now than in
decades past. Hurricane expert William Gray reported just a few days
earlier, on April 27, that the number of major hurricanes making
landfall on the U.S. Atlantic coast has declined in the past 40 years.
Hurricane scientists reported in the April 18 Geophysical Research
Letters that global warming enhances wind shear, which will prevent a
significant increase in future hurricane activity.

Gore claims global warming is causing an expansion of African deserts.
However, the Sept. 16, 2002, issue of New Scientist reports, &quot;Africa's
deserts are in 'spectacular' retreat . . . making farming viable again
in what were some of the most arid parts of Africa.&quot;

Gore argues Greenland is in rapid meltdown, and that this threatens to
raise sea levels by 20 feet. But according to a 2005 study in the
Journal of Glaciology, &quot;the Greenland ice sheet is thinning at the
margins and growing inland, with a small overall mass gain.&quot; In late
2006, researchers at the Danish Meteorological Institute reported that
the past two decades were the coldest for Greenland since the 1910s.

Gore claims the Antarctic ice sheet is melting because of global
warming. Yet the Jan. 14, 2002, issue of Nature magazine reported
Antarctica as a whole has been dramatically cooling for decades. More
recently, scientists reported in the September 2006 issue of the British
journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society Series A:
Mathematical, Physical, and Engineering Sciences, that satellite
measurements of the Antarctic ice sheet showed significant growth
between 1992 and 2003. And the U.N. Climate Change panel reported in
February 2007 that Antarctica is unlikely to lose any ice mass during
the remainder of the century.

Each of these cases provides an opportunity for Gore to lead by example
in his call for an end to the distortion of science. Will he rise to the
occasion? Only time will tell.

Which peers?  Carefully selected ones that agree with the POV?  Because
that's where the money is?  Because they want to create opportunities
for new project funding?

It doesn't require that one write a paper to refute another's findings.
Only that the findings are questionable based on incorrect assumptions
or use modified math to reach the desired results.

The ice core studies upon which so much of the 'man=made&quot; global warming
warming papers are based has been proven wrong and called into
question.  Seems that they forgot to account for &quot;outgassing&quot;.  When
outgassing is computed, it seems that the CO2 levels are the same or
lower than in previous warming cycles.

Oops, looks like the whole premise has some really big holes.

Yeah, they were intentionally overlooked.

Have you looked at the dates for the original &quot;global warming&quot; studies?

&gt;&gt; easily convinced that man is causing ghe earth to warm.

&gt;&gt; ROTFLMAO.

&gt;&gt; You're sooooo gullible!

&gt; Yep, NASCAR Hillbilly Carl.

&gt; It's a big conspracy!

&gt; American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)

&gt; AAAS Board Statement on Climate Change
&gt; --------------------------------------

&gt; Approved by the AAAS Board of Directors

&gt; 9 December 2006

&gt; For more information:

&gt; www.aaas.org/climate

&gt; The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human
&gt; activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society.

&gt; Accumulating data from across the globe reveal a wide array of effects:
&gt; rapidly melting glaciers, destabilization of major ice sheets, increases in
&gt; extreme weather, rising sea level, shifts in species ranges, and more. The
&gt; pace of change and the evidence of harm have increased markedly over the
&gt; last five years. The time to control greenhouse gas emissions is now.

&gt; The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, a critical greenhouse gas,
&gt; is higher than it
&gt; has been for at least 650,000 years. The average temperature of the Earth is
&gt; heading for levels not experienced for millions of years. Scientific
&gt; predictions of the impacts of increasing atmospheric concentrations of
&gt; greenhouse gases from fossil fuels and deforestation match observed changes.
&gt; As expected, intensification of droughts, heat waves, floods, wildfires, and
&gt; severe storms is occurring, with a mounting toll on vulnerable ecosystems
&gt; and societies.

&gt; These events are early warning signs of even more devastating damage to
&gt; come, some of which will be irreversible.

&gt; Delaying action to address climate change will increase the environmental
&gt; and societal consequences as well as the costs. The longer we wait to tackle
&gt; climate change, the harder and more expensive the task will be.

&gt; History provides many examples of society confronting grave threats by
&gt; mobilizing knowledge and promoting innovation. We need an aggressive
&gt; research, development and eployment effort to transform the existing and
&gt; future energy systems of the world away from technologies that emit
&gt; greenhouse gases. Developing clean energy technologies will provide economic
&gt; opportunities and ensure future energy supplies.

&gt; In addition to rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is essential
&gt; that we develop strategies to adapt to ongoing changes and make communities
&gt; more resilient to future changes. The growing torrent of information
&gt; presents a clear message: we are already experiencing global climate change.
&gt; It is time to muster the political will for concerted action. Stronger
&gt; leadership at all levels is needed. The time is now. We must rise to the
&gt; challenge. We owe this to future generations.

&gt; The conclusions in this statement reflect the scientific consensus
&gt; represented by, for example, the intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
&gt; ( www.ipcc.ch/ ), and the joint National Academies' statement

&gt; http://nationalacademies.org/onpi/06072005.pdf

ROTFLMAO!!!

You're sooooo gullible!!!

Read the paper.  If you can.  Its all rubbish.  Already been refuted.
The peer review is from peers that have a vested interest!

You're soooo gullible!!!

Absolute gem of a post there.

what so many people don't realize that if you just read the general news day
after day, then it becomes a big shock that this issue needs more debate.

Most people who not given this issue a lot of thought are simply aghast that
differing opinions exist on this issue.

Anyone who makes a honest, reasoned effort on this issue should and thus
will question much of what is being sold to the public.

To me, the Global warming deal is not a lot different then the dream TG
tried to sell the public.

There is many issues at stake here, and the idea that there is only one side
to this issue is a rather frightening concept indeed....

Anyway, the collection of videos on global warming the people are talking
about can be found here:

The fucking idiot who posted this thing should read the article's contents and
then explain its relevance to climate change.  It has nothing to do with the
present and the title uses present tense instead of past tense.

Is he so desperate for information supporting his views that he thinks that a
single study obviates the mountains of evidence that alienate his views, making
him look like a clod who still believes that the Sun rotates around the Earth?

The press release is put into proper context here:

DNA reveals Greenland's lush past
Armies of insects once crawled through lush forests in a region of Greenland
now covered by more than 2,000m of ice.

DNA extracted from ice cores shows that moths and butterflies were living in
forests of spruce and pine in the area between 450,000 and 800,000 years ago.

Researchers writing in Science magazine say the specimens could represent the
oldest pure DNA samples ever obtained.

The ice cores also suggest that the ice sheet is more resistant to warming than
previously thought, the scientists say.

&quot;We have shown for the first time that southern Greenland, which is currently
hidden under more than 2km of ice, was once very different to the Greenland we
see today,&quot; said Professor Eske Willerslev from the University of Copenhagen,
Denmark, and one of the authors of the paper.

&quot;What we've learned is that this part of the world was significantly warmer
than most people thought,&quot; added Professor Martin Sharp from the University of
Alberta, Canada, and a co-author of the Science paper.

Ice-locker

The ancient boreal forests were thought to cover southern Greenland during a
period of increased global temperatures, known as an interglacial.

Temperatures at the time were probably between 10C in summer and -17C in
winter.

When the temperatures dropped again 450,000 years ago, the forests and their
inhabitants were covered by the advancing ice, effectively freezing them in
time.

Studies suggest that even during the last interglacial (116,000-130,000 years
ago), when temperatures were thought to be 5C warmer than today, the ice
persevered, keeping the delicate samples entombed and free from contamination
and decay.

At the time the ice is estimated to have been between 1,000 and 1,500m thick.

&quot;If our data is correct, then this means that the southern Greenland ice cap is
more stable than previously thought,&quot; said Professor Willerslev. &quot;This may have
implications for how the ice sheets respond to global warming.&quot;

Research by Australian scientists has suggested that a 3C rise in global
temperatures would be enough to trigger the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.

In 2006, research conducted by researchers at Nasa suggested that the rate of
melting of the giant ice sheet had tripled since 2004.

While in February 2006, researchers found that Greenland's glaciers were moving
much faster than before, meaning that more of its ice was entering the sea.

And in 1996, Greenland was losing about 100 cubic km per year in mass from its
ice sheet; by 2005, this had increased to about 220 cubic km.

A complete melt of the ice sheet would cause a global sea level rise of about
7m; but the current picture indicates that while some regions are thinning,
others are apparently getting thicker.

Plant-life

The new results were obtained from the sediment rich bottom of ice cores.

The 2km-long Dye 3 core was drilled in south-central Greenland, whilst the 3km-
long Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) core was taken from the summit of the
Greenland ice sheet.

Samples from other glaciers, such as the John Evans Glacier on Ellesmere
Island, in northern Canada, were used as a control, to verify the age of the
samples and to confirm that the DNA was from plants that grew in southern
Greenland, rather than from plant matter carried by wind or water from
elsewhere in the world.

Although the ice contained only a handful of pollen grains and no fossils, the
researchers were able to extract DNA from the organic matter held in the silt.

Comparisons with modern species show that the area was populated by diverse
forests made up of alders, spruce, pine and members of the yew family.

Living in the trees and on the forest floor was a wide variety of insect life
including beetles, flies, spiders, butterflies and moths.

The discovery pushes forward the date when the last forests were known to exist
in Greenland by nearly two million years.

Previously, the youngest fossil evidence of a native forest in the region came
from fossils found in the Kap Kobenhavn Formation in northern Greenland. There,
the fossils date from around 2.4m years ago.

The study paves the way for scientists to probe beneath the ice in other parts
of the world.

&quot;Given that 10% of the Earth's terrestrial surface is covered by thick ice
sheets, it could open up a world of new discoveries,&quot; said Dr Enrico Cappellini
of the University of York, UK.

You don't catch too much, do you, imbecile...

The current status is that climate change that the earth is experiencing
is the SAME as that in previous cycles.  No difference.  Its historical
references that prove the idiocy of the global warming panic.

But those trying to keep the global warming panic going choose to ignore
that the earth is just going through a typical (and historically
similar) climate change cycle.

Its all about money.  The more global warming panic that can be created,
the more money that can be made by those creating the panic.  More
research $$, more $$ to fund &quot;solutions&quot; (none of which will have any
chance of altering a natural global climate trend).

As a result of the panic, governments will be asked to put in place more
regulation which will benefit those bureaucrats that do the regulating
and those that monitor.

Its all about money.

&gt; Yeah, sure asshole.  And what makes you an expert?  Your right wing doctrine?
&gt; A handful of scientists (none of whom have been published in over a decade)
&gt; whose money trail leads back to the fossil fuel industry?
&gt; A communist crackpot who made a bogus conspiracy documentary called &quot;The
&gt; Swindle&quot;?  Face it, imbecile. You're just another know-nothing looser who
&gt; spouts crap he's read from sources who wouldn't know science if it hit them in
&gt; the ass.  Another flat-earther, a kook.  Don't bother me with your incoherent
&gt; drivel.  Your opinion is meaningless.

&gt; Read on, asswipe:

&gt; Objection: Climate is complicated and there are lots of competing theories and
&gt; unsolved mysteries. Until this is all worked out, one can't claim there is
&gt; consensus on global warming theory. Until there is, we should not take any
&gt; action.

&gt; This is similar to the &quot;global warming is a hoax&quot; article, but at least here we
&gt; can narrow down just what the consensus is about.

&gt; Answer: Sure there are plenty of unsolved problems and active debates in
&gt; climate
&gt; science. But if you look at the research papers coming out these days, the
&gt; debates are about things like why model predictions of outgoing longwave
&gt; radiation at the top of the atmosphere in tropical latitudes differ from
&gt; satellite readings, or how the size of ice crystals in cirrus clouds affect the
&gt; amount of incoming shortwave reflected back into space, or precisely how much
&gt; stratospheric cooling can be attributed to ozone depletion rather than an
&gt; enhanced greenhouse effect.

&gt; No one in the climate science community is debating whether or not changes in
&gt; atmospheric CO2 concentrations alter the greenhouse effect, or if the current
&gt; warming trend is outside of the range of natural variability, or if sea levels
&gt; have risen over the last century.

&gt; This is where there is a consensus.

&gt; Specifically, the &quot;consensus&quot; about anthropogenic climate change entails the
&gt; following:

&gt;   a.. the climate is undergoing a pronounced warming trend beyond the range of
&gt; natural variability;
&gt;   b.. the major cause of most of the observed warming is rising levels of the
&gt; greenhouse gas CO2;
&gt;   c.. the rise in CO2 is the result of burning fossil fuels;
&gt;   d.. if CO2 continues to rise over the next century, the warming will
&gt; continue;
&gt; and
&gt;   e.. a climate change of the projected magnitude over this time frame
&gt; represents potential danger to human welfare and the environment.
&gt; While theories and viewpoints in conflict with the above do exist, their
&gt; proponents constitute a very small minority. If we require unanimity before
&gt; being confident, well, we can't be sure the earth isn't hollow either.

&gt; This consensus is represented in the IPCC Third Assessment Report, Working
&gt; Group
&gt; 1 (TAR WG1), the most comprehensive compilation and summary of current climate
&gt; research ever attempted, and arguably the most thoroughly peer reviewed
&gt; scientific document in history. While this review was sponsored by the UN, the
&gt; research it compiled and reviewed was not, and the scientists involved were
&gt; independent and came from all over the world.

&gt; The conclusions reached in this document have been explicitly endorsed by ...

&gt; If this is not scientific consensus, what in the world would a consensus look
&gt; like?

&gt; http://gristmill.grist.org/skeptics
">

There is no consensus.  Consensus is when a position is found where
everyone agrees.  The use if &quot;consensus&quot; to describe global wearming is
a lie.

A lie.  A lie.

Let me say that one more time.

A lie.

The scientific community is widely divided on this.  Those that can make
a lot of money are screaming the loudest.  Those that don't stand to
make much don't have much motivation except for personal pride.  And
they are attacked by the money.

I'm not following right wing doctrine.  I've used appropriate scientific
skepticism.  Read the reports, read the supporting views, read the
opposing views.

Everybody that agrees that global warming is man made want it to be man
made, need it to be man made.  They can profit wildly.

Its all about money.

Evidence that its man made just doesn't hold water when the existing
changes are identical (if not maybe milder) than previous warming
cycles.  The research does not account for previous cycles.  Even the
ice cores do not account for outgassing.

So it still boils down to a matter of cyclical change.  That's what the
evidence points to.

All the nice &quot;peer&quot; reviews all have the same POV before the papers are
reviewed.  Those that hold an opposing POV are not invited to review.

The papers have been refutred so many times that it all boils down to
the kind of personal attacks and shouting down that you have
demonstrated.  Not logic.

Sorry for you if you don't get it.  Sorry for you if you've been so
badly misled.

Its all about money.

Its all about money.

But for the climate change panic mongers, its a win-win situation.  If
they get their money (and they WILL GET RICH FROM THIS - that's their
objective), there will still be global warming.  They can claim that the
gov'ts acted too little and too late.  If they don't get what they want,
the earth will warm and they can say &quot;told ya so&quot; and try to move the
human race back into caves.

But its going to happen whether we do anything or not.  It would happen
(as it has many times before) whether man is on earth or not.

Its all about the money.

Its all about the money.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The current status is that climate change that the earth is experiencing is
&gt;&gt;&gt; the SAME as that in previous cycles.  No difference.  Its historical
&gt;&gt;&gt; references that prove the idiocy of the global warming panic.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure asshole.  And what makes you an expert?  Your right wing doctrine?
&gt;&gt; A handful of scientists (none of whom have been published in over a decade)

&gt;&gt; in the ass.  Another flat-earther, a kook.  Don't bother me with your
&gt;&gt; incoherent drivel.  Your opinion is meaningless.

&gt;&gt; Read on, asswipe:

&gt;&gt; Objection: Climate is complicated and there are lots of competing theories
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; unsolved mysteries. Until this is all worked out, one can't claim there is
&gt;&gt; consensus on global warming theory. Until there is, we should not take any
&gt;&gt; action.

&gt;&gt; This is similar to the &quot;global warming is a hoax&quot; article, but at least here
&gt;&gt; we
&gt;&gt; can narrow down just what the consensus is about.

&gt;&gt; Answer: Sure there are plenty of unsolved problems and active debates in
&gt;&gt; climate
&gt;&gt; science. But if you look at the research papers coming out these days, the
&gt;&gt; debates are about things like why model predictions of outgoing longwave
&gt;&gt; radiation at the top of the atmosphere in tropical latitudes differ from
&gt;&gt; satellite readings, or how the size of ice crystals in cirrus clouds affect
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; amount of incoming shortwave reflected back into space, or precisely how much
&gt;&gt; stratospheric cooling can be attributed to ozone depletion rather than an
&gt;&gt; enhanced greenhouse effect.

&gt;&gt; No one in the climate science community is debating whether or not changes in
&gt;&gt; atmospheric CO2 concentrations alter the greenhouse effect, or if the current
&gt;&gt; warming trend is outside of the range of natural variability, or if sea
&gt;&gt; levels
&gt;&gt; have risen over the last century.

&gt;&gt; This is where there is a consensus.

&gt;&gt; Specifically, the &quot;consensus&quot; about anthropogenic climate change entails the
&gt;&gt; following:

&gt;&gt;   a.. the climate is undergoing a pronounced warming trend beyond the range
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; natural variability;
&gt;&gt;   b.. the major cause of most of the observed warming is rising levels of the
&gt;&gt; greenhouse gas CO2;
&gt;&gt;   c.. the rise in CO2 is the result of burning fossil fuels;
&gt;&gt;   d.. if CO2 continues to rise over the next century, the warming will
&gt;&gt; continue;
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;   e.. a climate change of the projected magnitude over this time frame
&gt;&gt; represents potential danger to human welfare and the environment.
&gt;&gt; While theories and viewpoints in conflict with the above do exist, their
&gt;&gt; proponents constitute a very small minority. If we require unanimity before
&gt;&gt; being confident, well, we can't be sure the earth isn't hollow either.

&gt;&gt; This consensus is represented in the IPCC Third Assessment Report, Working
&gt;&gt; Group
&gt;&gt; 1 (TAR WG1), the most comprehensive compilation and summary of current
&gt;&gt; climate
&gt;&gt; research ever attempted, and arguably the most thoroughly peer reviewed
&gt;&gt; scientific document in history. While this review was sponsored by the UN,
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; research it compiled and reviewed was not, and the scientists involved were
&gt;&gt; independent and came from all over the world.

&gt;&gt; The conclusions reached in this document have been explicitly endorsed by ...

&gt;&gt;   a.. Academia Brasiliera de Ciências (Bazil)
&gt;&gt;   b.. Royal Society of Canada
&gt;&gt;   c.. Chinese Academy of Sciences
&gt;&gt;   d.. Academié des Sciences (France)

&gt;&gt;&gt; subject.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What's next?  Spelling flames or some other childish tactic?

&gt;&gt;&gt; You've just conceded defeat.

&gt;&gt; Nah, not at all.  Its just pointless to try to apply logic when all Al
&gt;&gt; Bundy / Irwin Edge can only should insults.

&gt;&gt; Defeat?  Hardly.

&gt; Fuck, you are delusional.  Do you always lie to yourself?

&gt; You began by shouting insults and still have yet to credibly refute a single
&gt; fact I presented.  And now, that that I have wiped the floor with you, you
&gt; pretend that all I did was insult you as a convenient way to divert attention
&gt; from the credible evidence I posted.  How pathetic!

&gt; &quot;It's all about the money!&quot;
&gt; &quot;It's all about the money!&quot;
&gt; &quot;It's all about the money!&quot;
&gt; &quot;It's all about the money!&quot;

&gt; &quot;it's a lie! it's a lie! it's a lie!&quot;

&gt; Bwwwaaahhhhaaahhaaaa!  What a fucking mental midget!

&gt; You must be joking!  Nobody is that much of an idiot!

&gt; What a waste of time!  How old are you Boy?  You act like a 10 year-old!

We've been in a warming cycle for 18,000 years.  There's hard scientific
proof of that.  Please inform us which industrial complex initiated
global warming 18,000 years ago?  Was it all those cave dwellers
starting fires to make their iron spearheads?

Now that you've been completely embarrassed and spanked, let your
handlers get you back to your special space.  They have a special treat
they made just for you!  Its strawberry-flavored thorazine.

Buh bye, troll.
