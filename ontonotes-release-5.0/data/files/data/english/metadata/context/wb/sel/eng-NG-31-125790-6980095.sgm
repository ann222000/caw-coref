Brave girl's bid to save 'Pops'

The Dominion Post | Wednesday, 17 January 2007

She's only 11 but after rescuing her dying "Pops" from the surf and
calling 111, Alicia White had
enough presence of mind to shield her younger sisters and cousins from
the upsetting scene.

She was unable to save her grandfather, but Alicia, a Paekakariki Surf
Lifesaving Club junior, has been hailed
a heroine for her "extraordinary" actions.

Hillary White sent her plucky lifesaving medal-winning daughter to the
rescue when, on December 29, she
noticed from the beach at Castlepoint that her father-in-law had tipped
out of his kayak and appeared to be
having difficulties getting back in.

Alicia swam out to bring in the kayak but discovered 60-year-old Bob
White was unwell. In fact he had suffered
a heart attack.

Because he was unable to get back in the kayak, she urged him to hang
on while she started to paddle back.

"It was kind of hard kayaking back - the wind was really strong out
there and there were rocks I was trying to
keep away from," she said. "When Pops let go and started to swim, I
kidded around with him to keep him
going - gave him some grief about his swimming and told him he was a
cool dude."

When she finally got back to shore her father and uncle rushed into the
surf and took over when the
130-kilogram man collapsed.

A doctor, who by chance was on the beach at the time, began to
administer CPR. Alicia rang 111, then noticed
some of her young sisters and cousins standing by watching.

"When I saw them crying I piled them in (the family vehicle) as well
and started to feed them," she said.

Mr White died within half an hour of being dragged to the beach.

Alicia was three years off qualifying as a lifeguard. Her initial
reaction to the ordeal was to give up her
lifesaving training, Mrs White said.

"She doesn't talk about it much but tends to beat herself up because of
the grim consequences. I have told her
he would have died out there alone if it had not been for her.

"It amazed me that while we were all attending to her grandfather she
herded the young children into the car
and fed them to cheer them up while she was also upset. Being the
oldest of six girls, she is a bit more
responsible than other children her age."

Alicia became a Paekakariki Surf Lifesaving Club nipper at the age of
seven and performed her first rescue
when nine.

She won a silver medal in the New Zealand Ocean Athletics On Board
championships last year and has come
first in her age group in the Wellington district lifesaving awards in
the past two years.

Paekakariki Surf Lifesaving Club spokesman John Porter said Alicia's
actions were amazing. "She
personified surf lifesaving and did everything right. What really blew
me away was how she gathered all her
siblings together and sat them in the car - that was magic."

Surf Lifesaving New Zealand chief executive Geoff Barry described the
rescue as extraordinary.

This young girl should be up for a medal. True heroism at such a young age.
shame grandad didn't make it, but I'm sure he would be proud of her.

This shows true presence of mind and a maturity that is really enviable, I
wish that more of today's youth were like this.
