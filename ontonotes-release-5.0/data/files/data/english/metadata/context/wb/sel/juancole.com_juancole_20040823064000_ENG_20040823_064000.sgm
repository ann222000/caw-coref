The debate that a handful of Texas multi-millionnaires close to the
Bush family have cleverly manufactured over John Kerry's war record is
absurd in every way. The charges that they have put some vets up to
making against Kerry are false and can be demonstrated by the historical
record to be false . Most of those making the charges have even
flip-flopped, contradicting themselves. Or they weren't eyewitnesses and
are just lying.

But to address the substance of this Big Lie is to risk falling into
its logic. The true absurdity of the entire situation is easily
appreciated when we consider that George W. Bush never showed any
bravery at all at any point in his life. He has never lived in a war
zone. If some of John Kerry's wounds were superficial, Bush received no
wounds. (And, a piece of shrapnel in the forearm that caused only a
minor wound would have killed had it hit an eye and gone into the brain;
the shrapnel being in your body demonstrates you were in mortal danger
and didn't absent yourself from it. That is the logic of the medal).
Kerry saved a man's life while under fire. Bush did no such thing.

What was Bush doing with his youth? He was drinking. He was drinking
like a fish, every night, into the wee hours. For decades. He gave no
service to anyone, risked nothing, and did not even slack off
efficiently.

The history of alcoholism and possibly other drug use is a key issue
because it not only speaks to Bush's character as an addictive
personality, but may tell us something about his erratic and alarming
actions as president. His explosive temper probably provoked the
disastrous siege of Fallujah last spring, killing 600 Iraqis, most of
them women and children, in revenge for the deaths of 4 civilian
mercenaries, one of them a South African. (Newsweek reported that Bush
commanded his cabinet, "Let heads roll!") That temper is only one
problem. Bush has a sadistic streak. He clearly enjoyed, as governor,
watching executions. His delight in killing people became a campaign
issue in 2000 when he seemed, in one debate, to enjoy the prospect of
executing wrong-doers a little too much. He has clearly gone on enjoying
killing people on a large scale in Iraq. Drug abuse can affect the
ability of the person to feel deep emotions like empathy. Two decades of
pickling his nervous system in various highly toxic substances have left
Bush damaged goods. Even for those who later abstain, "visual-spatial
abilities, abstraction, problem solving , and short-term memory, are the
slowest to recover." That he managed to get on the wagon (though with
that pretzel incident, you wonder how firmly) is laudable. But he
suffers the severe effects of the aftermath, and we are all suffering
along with him now, since he is the most powerful man in the world.

We all know by now that Bush did not even do his full service with
the Texas Air National Guard, absenting himself to work on the Alabama
senate campaign of Winton "Red" Blount. Whether he was actually AWOL
during this stint is unclear. But it is clear that not only did Bush
slack off on his National Guard service, but he also slacked off from
his campaign work.

This little-noted interview with Blount's nephew Murph Archibald,
which appeared on National Public Radio's "All Things Considered on
March 30, 2004, gives a devastating insight into what it was like to
have to suffer through Bush in that period.

"All Things Considered (8:00 PM ET) - NPR

March 30, 2004 Tuesday

This campaign season, there have been questions about whether George
W. Bush fulfilled his obligations to the National Guard as a young
lieutenant in the early 1970s. For weeks, reporters scoured Alabama in
search of pilots or anyone who might have remembered seeing Mr. Bush at
the time he was serving in the National Guard there. There is one place
in Alabama where Mr. Bush was present nearly every day: the headquarters
in Montgomery of US Senate candidate Winton "Red" Blount. President Bush
has always said that working for Blount was the reason he transferred to
the Alabama Air National Guard. NPR's Wade Goodwyn has this report about
Mr. Bush's time on that campaign.

WADE GOODWYN reporting:

In 1972, Baba Groom was a smart, funny young woman smack-dab in the
middle of an exciting US Senate campaign. Groom was Republican Red
Blount's scheduler, and in that job, she was the hub in the campaign
wheel. Ask her about the handsome young man from Texas, and she
remembers him 32 years later like it was yesterday.

Ms. BABA GROOM (Former Campaign Worker): He would wear khaki trousers
and some old jacket. He was always ready to go out on the road. On the
phone, you could hear his accent. It was a Texas accent. But he just
melded with everybody.

GOODWYN: The candidate Mr. Bush was working for, Red Blount, had
gotten rich in Alabama in the construction business. Prominent Southern
Republicans were something of a rare breed in those days. Blount's
support of the party led him to be appointed Richard Nixon's postmaster
general. In Washington, Blount became friends and tennis partners with
Mr. Bush's father, then Congressman Bush. That was how 26-year-old
Lieutenant Bush came to Montgomery, at his father's urging . . . It was
Mr. Bush's job to organize the Republican county chairpersons in the 67
Alabama counties. Back in 1972 in the Deep South, many rural counties
didn't have much in the way of official Republican Party apparatus. But
throughout Alabama, there were Republicans and Democrats who wanted to
help Red Blount. It was the young Texan's job to find out what each
county leader needed in the way of campaign supplies and get those
supplies to them. Groom says this job helped Mr. Bush understand how
even in a statewide Senate campaign, politics are local.

. . . Murph Archibald is Red Blount's nephew by marriage, and in
1972, he was coming off a 15-month tour in Vietnam in the infantry.
Archibald says that in a campaign full of dedicated workers, Mr. Bush
was not one of them.

Mr. MURPH ARCHIBALD (Nephew of Red Blount): Well, I was coming in
early in the morning and leaving in mid-evenings. Ordinarily, George
would come in around noon; he would ordinarily leave around 5:30 or 6:00
in the evening.

GOODWYN: Archibald says that two months before the election, in
September of '72, Red Blount's campaign manager came to him and asked
that he quietly take over Mr. Bush's job because the campaign materials
were not getting out to the counties.

Mr. ARCHIBALD: George certainly didn't seem to have any concerns
about my taking over this work with the campaign workers there. My
overall impression was that he didn't seem as interested in the campaign
as the other people who were working at the state headquarters.

GOODWYN: Murph Archibald says that at first, he didn't know that Mr.
Bush was serving in the Air National Guard. After he found out from
somebody else, Archibald attempted to talk to Mr. Bush about it. The
president was a lieutenant and Archibald had been a lieutenant, too; he
figured they had something to talk about.

Mr. ARCHIBALD: George didn't have any interest at all in talking
about the military. In fact, when I broached the subject with him, he
simply changed the subject. He wasn't unpleasant about it, but he just
changed the subject and wouldn't talk about it.

GOODWYN: Far from Texas and Washington, DC, Mr. Bush enjoyed his
freedom. He dated a beautiful young woman working on the campaign. He
went out in the evenings and had a good time. In fact, he left the house
he rented in such disrepair--with damage to the walls and a chandelier
destroyed--that the Montgomery family who owned it still grumble about
the unpaid repair bill. Archibald says Mr. Bush would come into the
office and, in a friendly way, offer up stories about the drinking he'd
done the night before, kind of as a conversation starter.

Mr. ARCHIBALD: People have different ways of starting the days in any
office. They're going to talk about their kids, they're going to talk
about football, they're going to talk about the weather. And this was
simply his opening gambit; he would start talking about that he had been
out late the night before drinking.

GOODWYN: Archibald says the frequency with which Mr. Bush discussed
the subject was off-putting to him.

Mr. ARCHIBALD: I mean, at that time, I was 28; George would have been
25 or 26. And I thought it was really unusual that someone in their
mid-20s would initiate conversations, particularly in the context of
something as serious as a US senatorial campaign, by talking about their
drinking the night before. I thought it unusual and, frankly,
inappropriate.

GOODWYN: According to Archibald, Mr. Bush would also sometimes tell
stories about his days at Yale in New Haven, and how whenever he got
pulled over for erratic driving, he was let go after the officers
discovered he was the grandson of a Connecticut US senator. Archibald, a
middle-class Alabama boy--who, by the way, is now a registered
Democrat--didn't like that story.

Mr. ARCHIBALD: He told us whenever he was stopped, as soon as the law
enforcement found out that he was the grandson of Prescott Bush, they
would let him go. And he would always laugh about that. "

Goodwyn dutifully notes that Baba Groom didn't remember George
telling drunk stories. But that means nothing, since they weren't the
sort of things guys like Bush told the "girls". He was trying to buddy
with Archibald and impress him.

Again, decades of this sort of behavior do not leave a person
untouched. Our world is in crisis and our Republic is in danger. It
should not be left in the hands of a man who spent his life like this.
