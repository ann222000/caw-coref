The Death Tax -- May It Rest in Peace

At long last, Virginia is on the verge of repealing its death tax.
The Senate and House of Delegates finally found something they could
agree upon, passing compromise legislation yesterday. Gov. Timothy M.
Kaine has indicated his support for repeal, so his signature should be a
formality.

As Death Tax foes have argued, the tax on inherited estates posed a
huge burden to farmers and family businesses. Having already paid taxes
on salaries, profits and dividends for years, family business had to
pony up one more time, often by taking on a crippling load of debt or
selling the land/enterprise outright.

As House Speaker William J. Howell, R-Stafford, said in a press
release yesterday, Virginia's top-rated business climate just got
better. Citing the state's Number One "Best State for Business" ranking
by Forbes magazine, he said: "Repealing unfair taxes and improving our
regulatory framework are precisely the kind of positive state tax and
regulatory actions enacted over the past decade and more that enabled
our Commonwealth to garner this latest accolade.”

I am sure that the Mars family, as well as the DuPonts and their ilk,
are very happy that their campaign contributions finally paid off. Next
on their agenda will be the repeal of the income tax so they can give up
their Florida residency.

For all the scare tactics of burdening heirs of family owned
businesses and selling off the family farms, no one has every come up
with any creditable examples of that happening.

And what are we going to do with all of those out of work estate
planners?

I guess the "Virginia No Millionaire Left Behind Act of 2006" will
result in an increase in resident income as all those wealthy people
flock to the Commonwealth.

Somehow, I can't get too excited about a tax benefit I have to die to
enjoy.

But at least the state is partially recognizing that taxing capital
is counterproductive. In the final reckoning, so to speak, taxes can
only be paid by living people and only with cash they actually have on
hand to spend.

Tax the income and tax the sales. Eventually property will be sold
and the increase in value is then income.

Even the diehards ought to be satisfied with that: government can
afford to take a longer view on when it gets its due.

Anonskeptic, You're spouting empty rhetoric. The Mars family, the
DuPonts, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and all of the rest can hire the best
legal and accounting minds in the country to minimize their death taxes.
Strategy One: Give the money away through non-taxable foundations.
Strategy Two: Set up generation-skipping trusts for the children and
grand-children. Strategy Three: Establish residence in states, like
Florida, that don't have a death tax. Strategy Four: Hide their money
overseas.

The people who get screwed by the inheritance tax aren't the
super-wealthy, it's the modestly wealthy like land-wealthy (and
cash-poor) farmers or small business owners who can't afford the
super-lawyers and super-accountants.

Jim's right. And I know several families that were damaged by the
previous law.

In some cases a lack of sophistication and knowledge was as damaging
as the lack of cash to provide proffessional help.

Yeah? Well how come the Mars family hired McGuireWoods to lobby for
the Estate Tax repeal if they weren't going to reap a huge benefit from
its repeal? That's just the most expensive lobbying firm in the
Commonwealth.

I don't think many will buy into the theory that the Mars were
lobbying for the repeal out of a sense of civic duty.

Another point you constantly miss is the problem of the loss of the
stepped up basis for the decedent's heirs at the federal level. As a
result, if they wish to sell the asset--farm or business, they'll have
to go back to daddy or even granddaddy's basis--if they can find
documentation. If they can't well, then the basis is "0".

There's a lot more talk than knowledge on this point.

If society is so worried about the loss of tax revenues from very
large estates, the federal government would be better to place a time
limit on the tax-free life of a foundation, e.g., the Ford Foundation or
the Gates Foundation. After say 50 years, the foundation becomes taxable
by both the federal and state governments.

Talk about your wealth and privilege. This idea of limiting the
concentration of wealth goes back to the old English statute of
Mortmain. Much better to limit the life of a Ford Foundation than to tax
a small business or private investor.

Wow! another "practical suggestion". Now can't you just hear the
outcry from the foundations and their beneficiaries? And those
beneficiaries are quite often the pet projects of the heirs (who often
just happpen to draw financial benefit from those charities and
foundations).

Nope it's the middle class that's going to be getting the kniofe
here. If you can't sell the small business after the death of the
founder without serious tax consequences, what benefit have you gained?

Tom Paine, You raise a good point about Mars hiring McGuire Woods
Consulting. I agree, they didn't do it out of the goodness of their
hearts -- clearly, they must be getting something out of the law. I
would like to know more about their motives.

But that doesn't change the facts that rich families can exempt much
of their estates from taxation if they choose to do so. Back in my
Virginia Business days when I researched the Virginia 100 list of
wealthiest Virginians, I spoke to one individual, whom I won't name to
protect his privacy, who said he'd be damned if he was going to let the
government tax his estate. He had assets all around the world, and I
have no doubt that he could hide/exempt them from the I.R.S. should he
choose to.

I have mixed feelinga about the lack of stepped up basis.

If the goal is to keep the farm or family business in operation, then
it doesn't make any difference. But if the goal is to avoid the tax and
then sell the business, under my previous argument the sale becomes
income and ought to be taxed. If it is inherited then the basis is zero
and it should all be taxed. Makes a nice incentive to keep the
enterprise going.

On the other hand, if Daddy knows the children aren't interested, he
could sell before he dies. For him the basis is not zero (unless he
inherited, too), and he could avoid much of the tax, what was left, his
children could inherit tax free, unless you define property as different
from cash. Undoubtedly there will be shenanigans with shell
corporations.

But under my plan, if they spend the money, at least that will get
taxed. Clearly, if you inherit the property, you should inherit the
basis, I'm not so sure you should get a new basis.

It seems a little swarthy to me, to advocate for an elimination of
the death tax in order to keep family businesses operating, and then
also advocate for a stepped up basis so they can be sold.

Say you inherit a business worth a million that your father created
fo 500 thou. You invest another 500 thou over the years and sell it for
2 million. Your basis is one million and you pay tax on the half million
the business grew whil you had it, and you pay deferred tax on the half
million it grew when your father had it:its really tax he would have had
to pay had he sold it, even if he sold it to you.

I don't see what is so unfair about paying a tax that is owed, just
because the government allows you to defer the tax for generations.

Well, Mr. Jim, it appears that not all of my rhetoric was “empty”
with respect to the Mars family, etc. So, back at you – instead of
spouting the empty republican rhetoric from the 'Death Tax' playbook,
cite an authoritative source for the number of farms that had to be sold
because of the Virginia inheritance tax. You pick the time frame. Better
still, how many businesses, small or otherwise, were sold to pay the
Virginia inheritance tax? Show me the beef!

If you are so worried about the non-super rich, would not it be
better to cap on the Virginia inheritance tax, say $5 million or less?
If you truly care about the modestly wealthy, then let’s forget about
the Mars family. As you say the Mars family and the others you
interviewed have all the dodges figured out, then why do they need the
tax break?

And I suppose that you subscribe to the republican rhetoric of
“personal responsibility,” so then why cannot the modestly wealthy
afford an attorney or accountant. I do not recall my mother paying
exorbitant sums to prevent being “screwed” by the inheritance tax. Do
these people not pay accountants or attorneys to handle their affairs
and file their taxes? Do they not listen to the people they pay for
advice?

I guess I just don't like people who are so adamant about taking
other people's property, just because they have it. Like the man who
asked his secretary if she would go to bed with him for $100,000: the
amount isn't the issue, its the ethics.

There have been few, if any, farms or businesses sold to pay the
Virginia Estate Tax or its predecessor the Inheritance Tax. those taxes
were miniscule in relation to the value of the estate/inheritance.

Besides, the Virginia Estate Tax was entitled to a full credit on the
federal Estate tax until they started monkeying around with it a few
years ago.

Interesting ccomment from Mr. Bacon, bless his heart, about the guy
who was going to hide his assets so they couldn't be taxed....Oh so we
repeal it because he'll break the law? Now that's an interesting
argument. Let's extend that theory...Hmmmm...Embezzlement?Murder?
Robbery?

And curious too is the theory that we'll eleminate the stepped up
basis so we can "keep 'em down on the farm" whether they want it or not.

Man, this internset spawns some weird stuff....but hey, it's America.

I think eliminating the stepped up basis is actually part of the
Federal plan, so that part isn't theory. If somebody knows the language,
please fill us in.

What the effect of eliminating the stepped up basis will be is yet
unknown. I was merely postulating some thought experiments to try to see
what the effects might be.

I didn't mean to imply that such a policy was deliberately designed
as a land conservation measure, but nothing would surprise me now. All I
meant was that if you don't get taxed on capital until you make a profit
on the sale of capital goods, then I think that is a policy that would
encourage thrift, conservation, continuation of businesses, and savings,
all of which we have far to little of.

You are probably right, the Virginia portion of the estate tax
probably hasn't caused much hardship, unless the hardship happens to be
yours. I guess I'm not concerned that the Mars family gets off scott
free: even if they lose 90% they are still fabulously rich. It doesn't
make that much difference. I'm more concerned that the Smith family gets
inadvertently ruined by the state after they have supported it for
generations.

If you earn more money and spend more money, then you should pay more
taxes. But, having done that, I see no reason why you should then be
expected to pay still more, just because you have saved more.

It's one thing to charge people their full costs and make those
charges somewhat in relation to cash flow that represents consumption.
It is something else to wail egregiously about "excess" wealth and then
argue to confiscate property far beyond an individuals actual cost to
the government.

If you have a problem with the Mars family, don't eat their candy.
Sure, some people will use the law to avoid taxation.that is perfectly
fair and OK as long as it is legal. "Taking Advantage" of the law is an
oxymoron. Commercial property kije kind exchanges are a total end run
around the tax law, but they are perfectly accepted as common practice.

Philosophically and economically the Viginia estate tax is as screwed
up as the federal law, asnd it should rightfully be eliminated for the
same reasons.

Standard stuff here...lots of philosophy, little knowledge.

The stepped up basis problem applies to a heck of a lot more than
real estate (although that's a special problem because with depreciated
real estate one loses the advantage of the lower capital gains tax).

Anyway, try figuring out how you establish the basis on something
like a furniture store, grocery store (and I don't mean a Ukrop's chain)
or the like. Many businesses have "grown" over many years. The basis may
end up close to "0". Do we say that the heir must forever stay in that
business, willy nilly?

Seems like "social planning" to me....This gets curiouser and
curiouser

<POST>
<POSTER> Ray Hyde </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> ????-??-??T11:58:00 </POSTDATE>
How does the basis go to zero on something you haven't depreciated?

Don't we have rules for recapturing depreciation on assets that have
actually appreciated?

I don't claim the accounting is easy. If the business has grown over
the years, it is either because you put in sweat equity for which you
have not yet been paid, or you have made other cash investments. No one
says you have to stay in the business, but you must pay tax on your
actual profits when you leave, same as with holding stocks. I don't see
the problem.

If you have a store you paid for land and structure, Your inventory
is paid for and valued separately, but if your inventory grows, so does
your basis. If the inventory becomes obsolete it is valued at less but
your basis is the same, unless you depreciate it. Seems like pretty
standard stuff.

I built a barn two years ago. I cut the trees, sawed the lumber, and
constructed the barn. All I bought was the nails and roofing. I haven't
made any money from the barn, except by selling the hay I keep there,
and I pay tax on that income and the customer pays tax too, if he is not
commercial.

But in addition, I now get taxed for merely owning the barn, with the
result that all of my effort means that my remaining income is
permanently reduced by the amount of the tax. If the perceived value of
the barn increases, my income is reduced still more.

I won't make the mistake of being industrious again, not until I'm
nearly ready to sell. Then I can put up nice stuff, charge the new owner
for it, pay the tax and be done with it. But from now on, its tarps, and
I'll put that ugly mess right out by the road so everyone can enjoy the
pastoral viewshed.

If I had bought the barn as a prefab, and had it delivered, I would
expect to pay tax on the transaction. But once I own it, it's purpose is
to generate more transactions, why would you create a tax that helps
prevent that?

I don't know what is fair, but I've watched a couple of families
destroyed by estate and property taxes they couldn't afford, and i'm
pretty sure that is not fair.

Estate taxes are effectively paid by those who inherit property. I am
sympathetic to the very rare situation in which several generations have
lived and worked on a farm, vineyard, etc but get hit by estate taxes
when the initial owner dies, often at an advanced age. However there are
ways to handle this without abolishing the estate tax outright. And as
we all agree, most estates are too small to tax anyway.

Mark Warner (MW) made a lot of money in cell phone technology. Some
of it was no doubt luck, but a lot of it was intelligence and skill. I
think he should pay higher taxes than the average working stiff, but I
certainly don't want those taxes to be confiscatory. He earned his money
and I don't begrudge him a dime of it.

MW has 3 daughters. They have, by virtue of their birth, access to a
marvelous life-style, excellent schools, the best universities that they
can get into, parents who can perhaps pull a few strings to get them
into iteresting jobs, and possibly good financial starts in life when
they marry and start their own families. Wouldn't be at all surprised if
Mark & Lisa started trust funds for the grandkids as they came along.

After Mark and Lisa are dead, no doubt these 3 daughters will be
taken care of in their wills. I see no more reason why these 3 daughters
should escape paying taxes on what they inherit than a lottery winner
should escape paying taxes on his winnings. It's both "found money". The
lottery winner got lucky when he bought his $20 million ticket at 7-11;
the 3 daughters got lucky when they were born. Tax 'em.

Anonymous 11:17, You, like many supporters of the death tax, focus on
the "windfall" enjoyed by the inheritors of the estate. Indeed, Mark
Warner's three children did nothing to "deserve" their great fortune.

Those who oppose the death tax focus on the person who made the money
in the first place. Lucky or just plain brilliant, Mark Warner made his
money fair and square. He's paid his taxes on his earnings. When he
invests his earnings and collects interest and/or dividends on that
earnings, he pays taxes a second time(except in the case of his
municipal bond portfolio.) I think of that money as his . He should be
able to do what he wants to with it. He can endow a foundation, like
Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, he can leave it to his children, or he can
donate it to the U.S. Treasury. That's his decision. It should be his
decision. That's because the money belongs to him -- not the state.

I find odious the idea that the public has the right to make the
value judgment that Mark Warner's children, or the progeny of the Mars
brothers, don't deserve the money Warner/the Mars brothers choose to
leave to them. The argument implies that the state should be allowed to
decide how much wealth people can keep and how they dispose of it. In
other words, individuals enjoy only those rights that the state allows
them . That's diametrically opposed to the founding principle of this
country: that the state has only those powers given them by the people.

The estate tax is the only one that I can think of that is justified
not on fiscal/budgetary grounds -- e.g. the state needs the money to
support vital programs -- but on moral grounds -- e.g. members of the
lucky sperm club don't deserve the windfall of wealth. That strikes me
as nothing more than the legislation of envy.

You are right, Jim.

Calling something a windfall is no excuse for attempting to steal it.
Frequently the money is not a windfall but simply property that was
accumulated over a long period of time. As you note, the original income
was already taxed, and when it is spent, it will be taxed again.

You don't tax stocks, for example until the dividends are paid or
until the profit is recognized when sold. I don't see any reason why
real estate or other estate property should be any different.

With real estate there is some justification for creating a cash flow
for the state that is not dependent on the immediate ups and downs of
the economy, although the state ought to be able toplan well enough to
avoid that problem. Nevertheless, the situation in Fairfax, where
property values have grown at 12 times the rate of personal income shows
why the property tax increases should be capped or means tested. If the
state is unable to plan for extraordinary circumstances, why should they
expect their citizens to be able to do so?

Money should be taxed when it is income and taxed when it is spent.
Property isn't income, even if it has increased in value over time.

Even with a true windfall, in its original sense, you can't enjoy the
bounty unless you have had the patience and foresight to grow the trees.

Speaking of the lucky sperm club, I know a man who inherited the
family business. But, by the time he did, he had already spent 25 years
working in the shop, some of it as child labor. Because his father was
an immigrant, a considerable amount of the growth of the business was
due to the children, who speak better English. By the time they
inhertied, much of the business was already "theirs".

Envy, Jim, no. If envy was the issue, then why not propose taking it
all?

Ray, I noted that situations where several generations may have
worked their entire lives in a privately owned business like a farm
should be taken into consideration.

The estate tax has generous exemption amounts, allowing a rich person
to pass on more to his heirs than most folks will ever see. I don't have
a problem with them and think they should have adjustments for inflation
factored into them. As I said, I'm not for confiscatory taxes.

I see the US becoming more statified with a thin layer of wealth at
the top with undue influence and power increasingly removed from the
rest of us. The best colleges are full of their kids. A college
education, which was a ticket into the good life a few years back, is
more and more expensive for the middle class. As their neighborhoods
depend less and less on public services, I see an elite that no longer
sees their fate as connected to the overall good fortune of the US in
general and its middle and working class people in particular. They see
themselves as separate. They can retreat to their gated communities and
ignore what is happening in the rest of the country. Allowing great
wealth, as opposed to a moderate amount, to be passed on only makes this
worse.

The US has enjoyed a stable government for many years because the
average citizen doesn't see the cards stacked firmly against him. If we
start looking like a third-world banana republic, we just might start
acting like one.

For what it's worth the basis will be 0 if the heirs cannot locate
the records to establish the basis. The IRS places the burden on the
taxpayer in these cases.

I guess it's too late because you have probably moved on to ather
things but thought I'd throw this in to correct the record....
