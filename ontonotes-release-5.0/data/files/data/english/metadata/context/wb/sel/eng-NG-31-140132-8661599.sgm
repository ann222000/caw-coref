Might as well let &quot;Flash&quot; Gordon have his walking papers.

Lead off with Rowand and let Burrell bat right after Howard.

Give Nunez walking papers.

Durbin pitches a complete game shutout and then they demote him
to the bullpen.

The other night Burrell took it for granted the pitcher wouldn't
try to make homeplate with his fabulous arm and Burrell dilly dallied.
But it's better that the Phils lost by one run in 9 innings than losing by
one run in 15 innings.

Bye,

I agree with Rowand leading off, he did for for ChiSox right? The
Phils lose their #3 hitter to injury and then lose their #1 hitter to
managerial decision. Cholly, Roberson and Werth are NOT leadoff
hitters.

what about Rollins?

Give Nunez walking papers.
He is our Best DEFENCIVE 3bman so why?
why not release Helms and let Nunez be a utility player and put UTLEY
at 3b when he returns

Burrell tries to get on base by walks to much he is afraid of inside
pitches
Next season Randy Ruiz should be our LFer and Burrell the backup\
after 2008 Burrells contract is done

The so-called leadoff hitter, leads off ONLY in the first inning. The duty
of the batter leading off EACH inning is to reach base. That includes a
power hitter or a pitcher. I don't believe there's enough stats proving that
Roberson or Werth are NOT leadoff hitters.

This is an injury-plagued team.  Desperate times...well you know the rest.
Not enough ABs to tell if batting Roberson is a bad choice for leading-off.

True, but the point is that the leadoff hitter hits BEFORE the #2, 3
and 4 hitters, who are supposed to drive in runs. If HE gets on base,
he's SUPPOSED to have a good chance of scoring. It's lineup placement
that creates a leadoff hitter. Not to mention the leadoff man gets the
best opportunity for the most at bats during a game.

Your point is understood, but I believe TOO much emphasize is placed on the
so-called lead-off hitter.  Every hitter is responsible to reach base NOT
just the lead-off hitter.

Right, but some hitters are better than others. And the best hitters are
pushed to the top of the order because they tend to have more plate
appearances than 6-9. Emphasis on results is naturally placed more
heavily on those with more talent.
