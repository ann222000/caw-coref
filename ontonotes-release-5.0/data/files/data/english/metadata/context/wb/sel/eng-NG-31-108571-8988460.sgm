I was hoping one of you extremely bright gentlemen or ladies could
assist me.

We are running a fleet of approximately 400 vehicles equipped with GPS
receivers.  These vehicles are transmitting data (not GPS yet) across
a Motorola Datatec 900 MHz network.  These systems would be setup to
transmit every 5 min.  Can anyone explain the Bandwidth implications
of adding this traffic to our network?

Thanks for the help,  Brent

Are you using a &quot;DATATAC&quot; network?

Are you a cop?  Or a taxi company?

How many of the 400 are actually active at one time - your busiest
time - all of them?

Depending on the load on your network at your current usage level, you
could either bring the system to its knees or hardly notice the
additional load.

What is the number of milliseconds to transmit/receive/process a
single position report?

No matter what the studies that your Motorola rep or your own people
have already done show you, I would start conservative, and set the
system up initially to report less often, then decrease the reporting
period delay in steps till you notice it.

What is the implication of initially knowing anyone's location say
every 10 or 15 minutes instead of every 5 minutes?

Is it easy to change the reporting period without servicing the in
vehicle units?

Do you have the option of specifying a &quot;polled report&quot; mode, where
each vehicle's position is requested from a centralized server, then
it reports?

Sorry My Bad
DATATAC

We are a Utility.

We are currently upgrading our Service Dispatch software and the
powers that be have discovered that they can monitor every move of our
field technician.  (God forbid they stop for a slurpee) .  We
generally have 350 to 375 in the field at one time.  The studies I
have seen on our extremely antiquated network suggest that it would
not take much traffic to bring it down

The testing we have currently been doing only allows us to set the
transmit time on the field systems.  Which makes it a little difficult
to change (we cannot remotely upgrade these systems)

These are the current settings we use:

GPS Settings within PEN.INI

GPS_Poll_Time = 300
GPS_Interval = 300
GPS_Distance = 100
WGM.ini
; 1 = kilometers, 0 = miles
units_in_km= 1
Poll Time - Measured in seconds. This is how often the MA polls (grabs
data) from the GPS device. No RF traffic created.
Interval - Measured in seconds. This is how often the MA sends the GPS
data (lat/long)  to the UCAD server which creates RF traffic.
Distance - Measured in Miles or KM/M (depending upon the setting in
the WGM.ini). This is how often the MA send the GPS data to the UCAD
server based on movement, which creates RF traffic.
Note: GPS Data is sent to the UCAD server via the Interval or Distance
setting, whichever comes first.
Additionally, GPS data sent to the server is also transaction driven
(e.g. Technician going Onsite, enroute, etc.), which means GPS data
transfer to the server can be either via the Interval or Distance
setting, or due to an action taken by the Tech.
