Does anyone know of any tips to make rotis?  I can't seem to get it
done right.  Here are my questions:

1.  What temperature water?
2.  Salt or no salt in the wheat/water batter?
3.  What flame fire do I use on the pan (i.e. high, low, medium)?
4.  Should I heat it directly on the fire after briefly heating on the
pan?  Another words, right after it's resilient enough to be handled
with my hand, can/should I transfer it to the fire?

Room tempurature

no salt for rotis.  Add salt and they are chapatis.  The flour should be
chapati/atta flour. You can substitute a 75/25 mix of finely sifted (to
remove coarse particles) whole wheat and all-purpose flour.

medium-high to high

Just cooking on the griddle is fine.

&gt; Does anyone know of any tips to make rotis?  I can't seem to get it
&gt; done right.  Here are my questions:

Can you tell me what type of flour are you using and what you mean by not
right? Are they too dry? Too heavy? How do they taste?

&gt; 1.  What temperature water?

Luke warm. Leave the dough for about 20-30 minutes then knead it again and
leave it for a further 15-20 minutes before rolling out and cooking.

&gt; 2.  Salt or no salt in the wheat/water batter?

No salt but if you find the roti's are too dry add a bit of butter.

&gt; 3.  What flame fire do I use on the pan (i.e. high, low, medium)?

Medium but make sure the pan/tawa/skillet or whatever you are using is HOT
before you put the roti on.

&gt; 4.  Should I heat it directly on the fire after briefly heating on the
&gt; pan?  Another words, right after it's resilient enough to be handled
&gt; with my hand, can/should I transfer it to the fire?

Yes for 20-30 seconds on each side. During this process the roti should puff
up to several times it's size, like this :

Instead of directly placing the roti over the fire these are also used :
