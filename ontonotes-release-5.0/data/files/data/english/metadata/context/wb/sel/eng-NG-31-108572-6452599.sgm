I am trying to find the following limit of multiple integrals

lim_{n -&gt; infty}
int_0^1 ... int_0^1 f{(x1+...+xn)/n} dx1 ... dxn

where f is continuous and bounded on [0,1].

I think that I am supposed to use the Law of Large Numbers together with some integration theorem in order to interchange the lim and the integrals. And it looks like a MonteCarlo result.

Is the limit
Ef(X)? Do I need continuity of f everywhere?

Can anybody help? Your help is much appreciated.

How about getting f(1/2), and requiring only continuity at 1/2 ?

Thanks for your message. Do you mean that
LLN gives (X1+...+Xn)/n -&gt; 0.5 when X is uniform
By Slutsky's theorem, f((X1+...+Xn)/n) -&gt; f(0.5)
What about the multiple integrals? I would need to fill in the details...
