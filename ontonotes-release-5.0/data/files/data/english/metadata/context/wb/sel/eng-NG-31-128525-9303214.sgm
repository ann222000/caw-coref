By Maria Merola

About 2,900 years before the birth of Messiah, Noah's grandson, Nimrod
built the Tower of Babel (Genesis 6). Nimrod married his mother
Semiramis, and together, they built the Babylonian Empire which
combined their pagan religion with their form of government. They
worshiped the stars, sun, and the moon, and they sacrificed their
babies to Molech. Noah's son Shem was so angry about this, that he had
Nimrod killed and his body parts were delivered to different provinces
within Babylon as a warning to those who worshipped Molech aka Satan.

Nimrod's wife/mother wanted to keep this false pagan religion alive in
order to keep the money coming in. She consulted her astrologers who
told her that on December 22nd the sun is the furthest away from the
earth, but on December 25th, the sun is &quot;born again.&quot; This is known as
the &quot;winter solstice&quot; in paganism. Semiramis got herself pregnant on
March 25th (Easter/Ishtar), which is called the spring equinox in
paganism. She told the Babylonian people that Nimrod was the god of
the sun, and that he impregnated her, with the rays of the sun.

Exactly 9 months later on December 25th, she gave birth to a son and
named him Tammuz. She told the Babylonians that Tammuz was a
reincarnation of Nimrod the &quot;sun god&quot; born on December 25th and that
she was the &quot;goddess of the moon&quot; or the &quot;Queen of Heaven.&quot;

She ordered Babylonians to go into the forest and cut down a tree and
decorate it with little balls (which were meant to be Nimrod's
testicles) to commemorate Nimrod who was &quot;cut down&quot; like a tree. God
hates this practice which is why he warned the children of Israel in

Jeremiah 10:

1 Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:
2 Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not
dismayed at the signs of heaven; (astrology) for the heathen are
dismayed at them.
3 For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out
of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.
4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails
and with hammers that it move not.

And today, Christ Mass trees are erected supposedly in the name of
Jesus, but this practice was started long before Jesus ever came to
earth. Did God change his mind now? No, he still hates it and he says
&quot;learn NOT the ways of the heathen...&quot;

God rebuked the children of Israel for worshipping this Queen of
Heaven who is called by various names i.e Venus, Isis, Diana,
Aphrodite, Ishtar, Easter, Astoreth, Catholic &quot;Mary&quot; etc.

Jeremiah 7:18 &quot;The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the
fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of
heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may
provoke me to anger.&quot;

God was also very angry with the children of Israel for worshipping
this pagan sun god named Tammuz born December 25th here in

Ezekiel 8:

13 He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see
greater abominations that they do.
14 Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house
which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for
Tammuz.
15 Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee
yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.
16 And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and,
behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and
the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the
temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they
worshipped the sun toward the east.

From there, this same Babylonian religion was carried over into other
cultures under different names. In Egypt she was known as Isis, Queen
of Heaven and Tammuz was known as Horus. Nimrod was known as Seb.
The Egyptian priests placed these initials I H S of the pagan trinity
(Isis, Horus &amp; Seb) on a round wafer to commemorate the sun god and
they ate it each year on December 25th believing that the sun god was
being reincarnated in them as they ate this wafer god. They re-enacted
the death of Nimrod on a &quot;tree&quot; on March 25th (Easter) and believed he
would be reincarnated on December 25th. This re-enactment was called a
&quot;Mass&quot; or Massacre.

Today, these same initials of I H S appear on the Catholic Eucharist
Wafer. The Catholic Catechism teaches that the priest has the power to
pull Christ down from this throne and crucify him again and again at
each Mass. The Catechism states concerning Christ:

&quot;At each mass, he performs the function of the victim anew...&quot;
The Catholic Trinity secretly disguises a different trinity than what
most Christians believe in:

The Pope as the Holy Father, Jesus as the pagan sun god, and Mary as
the Holy Spirit, hence Isis (Mary) Horus (Jesus) Seb (Pope/Father).

Later on about 164 years before Christ came to earth, there was a
Syrian dictator known as Antiochus. Antiochus went into the Jewish
temple and set up an abominable image of Zeus the pagan sun god on
December 25th and claimed that he was a reincarnation of Zeus on
December 25th. He gave himself the title &quot;Epiphanies&quot; which in Greek
means &quot;God Manifest&quot; as he claimed that he was a reincarnation of
&quot;God&quot; on December 25th.

Interestingly, the word &quot;Epiphanies&quot; adds up to 666 in the Greek
alphabet. Antiochus was a precursor to the final antichrist that will
come before the second coming of Jesus Christ.

Antiochus sacrificed a pig on the altar of sacrifice, outlawed the
holy feasts of YHVH from Leviticus 23 and persecuted the Jews. He
forced them to worship him instead on December 25th and if they did
not they were executed.

During the days of Antiochus's persecution of the Jews, there was a
Jewish man by the name of Judah Maccabees. He and his sons began a
revolt and they took back YHVH's temple and cleansed it. They only had
enough olive oil to light the menorah for one day, but miraculously
YHVH allowed it to stay lit for 8 days, symbolizing &quot;New Beginnings.&quot;

This was called &quot;Dedication&quot; because on the 8th day, a Jewish baby boy
is dedicated in the temple and circumcised. The Hebrew word for
dedication is &quot;Chanukah&quot; and hence this is how the holiday of Chanukah
originated.
About 160 years later, Mary conceived Jesus on Chanukah in 4 B.C. on
December 13th. This can be calculated precisely through scripture by
knowing the date of John the Baptist's birth from Luke chapter 1. John
the Baptist's father Zechariah was a priest in the temple and of the
division of Abijah. In the book of 2nd Chronicles we find out that
King David had divided up the priesthood into 24 courses annually.
There were 24 priests and each one would serve for 2 weeks throughout
the year. Zechariah, being of the division of Abijah, would serve in
the Jewish month of Sivan (June on our calendar). Zechariah went home
to his wife Elizabeth and she conceived immediately following his
temple duty according to the words of Gabriel.

Counting forward 271 days for a normal gestation, John the Baptist was
born on Passover. Luke 1 tells us that Mary conceived Jesus in the 6th
month of Elizabeth's pregnancy. So we can count 180 days forward from
Passover that year in 3 B.C. and Jesus was born on the Feast of
Tabernacles in a stable. The Hebrew word for tabernacle is &quot;succah&quot;
which means &quot;stable.&quot; Jesus was born on &quot;Sukkot&quot; in September. By
counting 9 months backwards from Sukkot, in 3 B.C. we come to the
exact date of Chanukah in 4 B.C. This means that the incarnation of
Jesus Christ took place on Chanukah!
Jesus also considered this to be a holy day and he celebrated the
re-dedication of his Father's house on Chanukah:

John 10: 22-23 And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication,
(Chanukah) and it was winter. And Jesus walked in the temple in
Solomon's porch.

In 325 AD, Constantine a Roman Emporer in an attempt to unify the
Roman Empire, combined this same pagan religion from Babylon with
so-called Christianity. Constantine worshipped &quot;Mithra&quot; the pagan sun
god born December 25th. He believed he could bring unity to Rome by
keeping this pagan religion and combining it with Christianity. So he
wrote the Edict of Milan and he dis-fellowshipped the Jewish believers
in Jesus. Constantine did not remove the pagan statues from the pagan
temple but instead he gave them &quot;Christian&quot; names. He named Venus
&quot;Mary&quot; and he named Sol the pagan sun god &quot;Jesus.&quot;

He wrote:

&quot;….The Jews are dogs and the Christians should have nothing to do with
the Jews…God has shown us a better way…&quot;

He outlawed Passover and enforced &quot;Easter&quot; in its place for the
Babylonian goddess Ishtar/Semramis. He also outlawed Sabbath and
enforced it on Sunday for the sun god instead. He had Christians
killed who kept these feasts of YHVH from Leviticus 23 that the Jewish
Apostles and Jesus also kept.

In the 5th Century, the Catholic Church officially made Christ Mass on
December 25th the official date for celebrating the birth of Christ
because of Constantine's influence. Constantine was the first Pope
historically giving himself the title &quot;Pontificus Maximus&quot; which is
still to this day the official title of a Pope. The word &quot;pope&quot; means
&quot;father&quot; in Latin and Jesus said &quot;call no man upon the earth your
father, for there is one who is your father...&quot;

This is where the term &quot;Christ Mass&quot; gets it's origin. The Catholic
Mass is a Massacre of Christ where he is being crucified all over
again according to Catholic dogma.

When we say &quot;Merry Christ Mass&quot; we are saying &quot;Let's be Merry about
crucifying Jesus afresh.&quot;

But Hebrews 6 tells us &quot;seeing they crucify to themselves the son of
God afresh and put him to an open shame...&quot;

If we say &quot;Merry Christ Mass&quot; we are saying that we are merry about
putting Jesus Christ to an open shame!

Why does the Catholic Church believe he must be crucified afresh?
Because they teach that Jesus did not inherit a carnal nature like us,
and that he did not crucify the sinful nature on the cross. But Romans
8:3 says that Jesus &quot;came in the likeness of sinful flesh...&quot; so that
he could destroy sin in the flesh once and for all!

Romans 6:10 &quot;For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that
he liveth, he liveth unto God.&quot;

Catholicism teaches that Jesus inherited a sinless divine nature from
Mary his mother as they teach that she was born without original sin!
This is what is called the &quot;Immaculate Conception.&quot; Most Protestants
think this has to do with the virgin birth of Jesus Christ, but it
does not. The Immaculate Conception is about Mary's birth without
original sin. And of course this is total blasphemy and a lie!

Mary, although a godly woman was born as a sinner like everyone else
and she herself acknowledged her need for Jesus to save her.

And so this is what is so blasphemous about the Catholic Mass and why
we as believers should have nothing to do with saying &quot;Merry Christ
Mass.&quot;
1st John 4:3 in the King James Version (other versions deleted this
verse) gives us a litmus test for how to &quot;try the spirits&quot; to see
whether or not they are from God. It says that &quot;every spirit&quot; which
denies that &quot;Jesus Christ is come in the flesh&quot; (with a carnal nature)
is from the antichrist!

This Catholic Doctrine which says that Mary was born without original
sin and that Jesus did not possess a carnal nature either because of
her, is from the antichrist! Jesus had to possess a carnal nature in
order to destroy sin on the cross once and for all. Jesus/Yeshua was
100% God and 100% Human at the same time.

And so the Catholic Mass is antichrist doctrine which denies that
Jesus destroyed the carnal sinful nature on the cross once and for
all. That is why they teach he must &quot;perform the function of the
victim anew at every Mass...&quot;
Now we see how Anti-Christ Christ Mass really is!

If Jesus is supposedly another reincarnation of all the false pagan
Messiah's born December 25th that have come up through the centuries
i.e. Nimrod, Tammuz, Apollo, Zeus, Bacchus, Krishna, etc. then &quot;he is
not come in the flesh.&quot; In other words this teaching insinuates that
&quot;the Christ&quot; is a consciousness rather than a person! Jesus is the
Christ fully in the flesh! The Catholic Mass denies this by teaching
that he must be crucified again!
Today, Christendom has borrowed much of its system from Babylon which
is why Jesus said in Revelation 18 concerning MYSTERY BABYLON THE
GREAT THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS:

Revelation 18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come
out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that
ye receive not of her plagues.

In the 1500's many people obeyed this command and did just what Jesus
commanded here. They left Roman Catholicism and thus began the biggest
revival in Europe in history. We call this the Protestant Reformation.

Protestant Churches preached against Christ Mass and Easter, and even
the Puritans that came over on the Mayflower wanted nothing to do with
these pagan days. It was official church doctrine in the Baptist,
Presbyterian and many other Protestant Denominations not to observe
these Catholic Pagan days known as Christ Mass and Easter.

Only in the past 100 years in America, have these pagan days become
popular once again in the Protestant churches. Why?

1st Timothy 4:1 &quot;Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter
times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
spirits, and doctrines of devils.&quot;

As we approach the second coming of Jesus Christ/Yeshua Ha'Mashiach,
the Bible tells us that many shall depart from the faith of the Jewish
Apostles and give heed to doctrines of devils.

Many Jews believe that Jesus was a false pagan Messiah because we
Christians have been lying and telling the world that he was born on
the same day that Antiochus Epiphanies persecuted them under
inspiration of the pagan sun god Zeus on December 25th.

Jews see this as a day when they were being persecuted for worshipping
the one true God YHVH, and they were forced to worship a false Messiah
on December 25th.

Jesus told the woman at the well:

John 4:22 &quot;Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for
salvation is of the Jews.&quot;

Any Jew knows that YHVH would never allow the Messiah to be born on a
pagan sun god day. Any Jew knows that when Messiah comes he will be
born on a Holy day of YHVH from Leviticus 23 which God said &quot;ye shall
observe these throughout all your generations…forever…&quot; which means
that these were never to go away with the New Covenant.

Let's win the Jews back to Christ by telling them the truth that
Jesus/Yeshua was born on a Holy Day of YHVH and not on a man-made
pagan sun god day.

Colossians 2:16 says:

Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of
an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:

This verse is often used out of context to justify keeping pagan days,
but it is saying just the opposite. We are not to judge those who want
to keep the feasts of YHVH from Leviticus 23 that are called &quot;holy&quot;
and we are not to judge each other in HOW these holy days are
celebrated. This means that we don't have to sacrifice animals any
longer and do these feasts in the rabbinical way that they were
formerly kept, but we can be led by the Holy Spirit in how we keep
these holy days. This verse is in no way condoning keeping pagan days,
because God never called them holy.

Let's win the Jews back to Yeshua our Messiah by associating him with
the Holy Days of YHVH. Only then will they recognize him as the true
Jewish Messiah!

The Jews are on God's top list of priorities. It is a small sacrifice
for us as believers to give up man-made traditions in order to win
them back:

Romans 1:16 &quot;For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is
the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the
Jew first, and also to the Greek.&quot;

Remember that Jesus told us:

Matthew 15:6 &quot;Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect
by your tradition.&quot;

Let's make the commandments of Yehovah once again effective in our
lives and in the process, win the Jews back to Messiah!

Happy Chanukkah!
