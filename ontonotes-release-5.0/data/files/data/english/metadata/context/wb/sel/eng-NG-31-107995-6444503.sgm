Has anyone used Enco's green silicone carbide wheels, and will they really
grind carbide tools?
Thanks,
Walt

Several years ago I bought one and was amazed how out of true it was.

==========
Yes and Yes.

If you have the so called carbide grinder with the side wheels,
typically these have a green rock on one end and a white rock on
the other end in small and home shops.

To be totally correct use the white rock to grind the steel under
the carbide (with slightly more clearence angle) and the green
rock on the carbide insert.

The first thing you should always do after installing a new rock
is dress it.  You can get a diamond dress for under 10$ and it is
worth while.  The silicone carbide dressing stick work fine on
the what wheels, but you need diamond for the green ones.

Always set things up so you are "dragging" the diamond across the
wheel to avoid digging in.  IMNSHO it is worthwhile to fabricate
a holder for the diamond dresser.

Sharpen? depends upon the tool,  you can adequately sharpen a masonry
drill , a jackhammer cruciform bit, a stump grinder tooth etc but for
metalworking consider green wheels only to shape carbide, to sharpen
you still need diamond.

Most of the green wheels I have purchased from ENCO were Camel brand
and were well made.

Listen to what  beecrofter has to say, for he's dead on with his assessment.
While green wheels (specially formulated silicon carbide abrasive bonded
very softly so it will break down quickly) will grind carbide, the cutting
action is more akin to clubbing off the tungsten carbide as opposed to
grinding it.  The tools that result tend to have very ragged finishes,
allowing for premature failure due to edge roughness that just keeps
chipping, albeit at a microscopic level.     You're far better off to
entertain a diamond wheel.

I'm running a Camel aluminum oxide wheel at the moment and can say nothing
negative about the quality.

Yes, but very slowly.  I made do for a while with the green, but sprang for
the diamond.  What a difference.

I still use the green to touch things up and spare the diamond.  Heavy
removal or reshaping requires the diamond.
