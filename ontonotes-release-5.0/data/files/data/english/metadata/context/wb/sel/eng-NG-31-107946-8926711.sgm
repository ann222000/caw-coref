Lets say I'm instructing with my student. I have a commercial license,
a CFI certificate, and a 2nd class medical. On board with me all I
have is my medical certificate and my commercial card, I left my CFI
card at home.

After the flight is over the FAA ramp checks me. I tell him I don't
have my CFI card on me, yet I just finished an instruction flight. Can
the FAA violate me according to 61.3(d)?

(d) Flight instructor certificate. (1) A person who holds a flight
instructor certificate issued under this part must have that
certificate, or other documentation acceptable to the Administrator,
in that person's physical possession or readily accessible in the
aircraft when exercising the privileges of that flight instructor
certificate.

Heres the way I see it: In 119.1, it lists all the operations a
commercial pilot can do and get paid for. In there it lists &quot;student
training&quot; as one of those privileges. Couldn't I just tell the FAA I
was conducting this flight not as a CFI, but as a commercial pilot? Is
my line of thinking correct?

I assume this is academic. A lot of what we do as CFIs would end up
falling under 135 if we were not instructing as CFIs. It would depend
on all the standard 91vs135 tests.

Short answer: No.

If you are conducting operations under part 119, then yes. When this
instructional flight occurs are you operating as an air carrier or as a
commercial operator. Both designations entail a LOT more requirements
regarding operations than you may suspect. The purpose of the part 119
rule is to permit company check pilots and company &quot;instructors&quot; who may
not otherwise be CFI's to train other company employees in company
aircraft. Unless you are paying this student to learn from you, at your
airline (which you have an Ops Spec's manual for, etc), this exception
isnt for you.

If you are operating under a part 91 instructional flight, then no, you
need to have a CFI certificate on your person, as stated.

More to the point, why would you let your certificates get separated?  I need to
have my license, medical, and restricted radio operator's license with me when I
fly so they all went into my wallet years ago and never come out unless I have
to update or show them to someone.  But I don't go to the store without them.

I understood that the restricted radio operators license was no longer
required.. although I still have mine in my certificate pouch from many
years ago..

I'll need to go look that one up..

Like you, I am so proud of mine I keep it all together in my wallet
and it goes everywhere with me.  I jump on the opportunity to tell
everyone I am a pilot and &quot;Look. heres my certificate!&quot;  If it were
not in my wallet I would be lost!

I hope I never forget my wallet anywhere, I would be lost without my

You are reading it wrong.

119 Certificate Air Carrier and Commercial Operators.. (which you are not?)

119.1(e) this part does not apply to  (are you instructing in an aircraft
with more than 20seats or more that 6000 pounds?)
199.1(e)(1).. Student instruction

You are performing instruction under part 91, and with only a Commercial

That is correct to a certain extent. To give flight instruction you need the
FI certificate, to tow banners you need the waiver etc. You have
restrictions to work within. You cannot take 119.1 and 91 as being mutually
exclusive.

This is pretty basic stuff covered in the Commercial and Instructor
checkrides.

The requirement for the restricted 3rd class radiotelephone certificate for
domestic flight in the USA was dropped some 20-30 years ago.  The LAW says
you have to have one for international flight but is universally ignored.

Having a commercial pilot certificate issued under part 91 allows you to
work and get paid by a &quot;company&quot; operating under part 119, 121, 135 etc.

Remember that part 119 is for &quot;companies&quot; not individuals. The certificates
issued to operate under 119 will have their own operating procedures
approved by the FAA which includes training, maintenance and proficiency
requirements.

As an individual to instruct you need a certificate to instruct issued under
part 91 and part 91 then provides your guidelines, 2 year renewals, annual
Homeland Security Training, etc.

I'm sure that if you recommended a student for an FAA checkride on the 8710
and the examiner or FAA OKC checked your credentials as the endorsing
instructor, then a review of the students log books for your endorsements
for each hour of dual received and your lob books and pilot certificate
would be up for review and possible suspension.

(Does not apply to commercial balloon pilots)

Yup.

The title of the subpart tells volumes about what, exactly, it is
applicable to. If you are running Bob's Charter Service, with on demand
charters, you likely will operate under part 135. If you are running
United, Continental or Southwest Airlines, you are operating under part
119. If you are Lufthansa or British Airways, you are operating under
yet a DIFFERENT chapter (foriegn flag airlines). Fed Ex, UPS and other
frieght dogs, yet another.

There are minimum experience requirements for PIC in these operations,
and while I may be mistaken, I want to say to be a PIC in a 135 op (and
not limited to day/vfr) you've got to essentially have the experience
required of an ATP certificate, wether you have the ATP or not.

119 isn't any less restrictive. There are likely requirements for
frequent check rides by check airmen, or sim rides, and you are subject
to supervision by a chief pilot, who also has even greater minimums for
holding that role. And all of these people are on the payroll. Working
for the company that holds the 119 certificate.

As someone else has said.. part 119 isn't for individuals, its for
companies/businesses/airlines. And if you want to operate under that
chapter, I would recommend you contact your local FAA inspector so you
can accomplish all the licensing, regulatory and documentation
requirements.

In Canada at least, the answer is 'it depends'.

In general, (and without referring to the CARs) a flight instructor licence
is required to endorse a student log (or PTR) for any student who is not a
licenced pilot.  A holder of a commercial pilot licence (with the proper
ratings and experience) MAY be able to give instruction to a licenced pilot
for the purpose of such as type conversion or for some types of ratings such
as float ratings and there are some special situations regarding instrument
training.  There are some restrictions as to what and how much can be logged
for training credit.  Acro training is another grey area with special
conditions.

AFAIK, Any pilot can teach anyone at any time, but that training is seldom
creditable towards the required dual training for any licence.  Of course if
money or other consideration is involved then many other factors enter the
picture.  A lot of the answer depends on who is the owner or legal operator
of the aircraft.

USE EXTREME CAUTION and read YOUR regulations carefully.  NEVER depend on
Usenet for legal advice.

Happy landings,

Except when you fly to France. Fly in an N reg and the French will ask for

I know for a fact you can get a CFI certificate and &quot;hold out&quot; by
putting up banners everywhere advertising your CFI services. This is
called &quot;freelancing&quot; and it's always been fairly common with CFI's. I
always thought that little blurb in 119.1 about &quot;student instruction&quot;
is exactly what allows CFI's to do this without it being considered
common carriage. If part 119 doesn't apply to individuals, then what
regulation allows CFI's to &quot;hold out&quot;?

&gt;&gt;can accomplish all the licensing, regulatory and documentation
&gt;&gt;requirements.

This is correct.

No.. its not.

If part 119 doesn't apply to individuals, then what

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; regulation allows CFI's to &quot;hold out&quot;?
">

Explicitly? Dont have one. And they get dinged if they fly someone
somewhere for money in a plane the CFI or school provides, if
instruction doesn't occur (which becomes a charter/carraige situation)

§ 61.133   Commercial pilot privileges and limitations.
§ 61.193   Flight instructor privileges.
AC 120-12a provides some guidance on just what common versus private
carraige is.

The flight is a part 91 flight. The regs dont distinguish wether the
instructor furnishes the plane or not, and the plane can be instructor
owned, student owned, or rented from a third party (or the instructor).
Providing a plane for rental is not a charter or carraige operation.
Flying people and things from one point to another for money is.

If you insist on trying to operate under 119, I suggest you read up..
and perhaps contact the FSDO for guidance.

Compliance starts with
§ 119.21   Commercial operators engaged in intrastate common carriage
and direct air carriers.

(a) Each person who conducts airplane operations as a commercial
operator engaged in intrastate common carriage of persons or property
for compensation or hire in air commerce, or as a direct air carrier,
shall comply with the certification and operations specifications
requirements in subpart C of this part, and shall conduct its: (etc)

OR

§ 119.23   Operators engaged in passenger-carrying operations, cargo
operations, or both with airplanes when common carriage is not involved.

(a) Each person who conducts operations when common carriage is not
involved with airplanes having a passenger-seat configuration of 20
seats or more, excluding each crewmember seat, or a payload capacity of
6,000 pounds or more, shall, unless deviation authority is issued—

(1) Comply with the certification and operations specifications
requirements of part 125 of this chapter;

(2) Conduct its operations with those airplanes in accordance with the
requirements of part 125 of this chapter; and

(3) Be issued operations specifications in accordance with those
requirements.

and even more:
§ 119.35   Certificate application requirements for all operators.

(a) A person applying to the Administrator for an Air Carrier
Certificate or Operating Certificate under this part (applicant) must
submit an application—

(1) In a form and manner prescribed by the Administrator; and

(2) Containing any information the Administrator requires the applicant
to submit.

(b) Each applicant must submit the application to the Administrator at
least 90 days before the date of intended operation.

So.. again.. got to make application, get reviewed, get ops spec's
issued, then you operate to the letter of those ops specs. They serve as
YOUR company's personal version of the FAR's and can be more limiting
than what you commonly see in the FAR/AIM. Busting an op spec is busting
a FAR. Its grounds for license action.

Instruction can be done by anyone.  For it count toward some
FAA requirement the instructor needs to be authorized.  A
CFI is required for endorsing  first solo, solo x-c, and for
practical tests.
For operations under certain other FAA allowed operations, a
pilot or even a non-pilot, may be qualified to give FAA
approved or required initial and recurrent instruction.

| &gt; Short answer: No.
| &gt;
| &gt; If you are conducting operations under part 119, then
yes. When this
| &gt; instructional flight occurs are you operating as an air
carrier or as a
| &gt; commercial operator. Both designations entail a LOT more
requirements
| &gt; regarding operations than you may suspect.
|
| The way I understand it, the list in 119.1 describes what
exactly part
| 119 applies to. It then goes on to list a bunch of
operations that
| &quot;apply&quot; (meaning they fall under the jurisdiction of 135,
121, 125,
| etc). Paragraph (e) lists exceptions. One of the things
listed is
| &quot;student instruction&quot;
|
| To me, this means &quot;student instruction&quot;, even though it
may seem a lot
| like common carriage, is allowable without any further 135
or 121
| certification. This means I can do flight instruction and
get paid for
| it.
|
| &gt; The purpose of the part 119
| &gt; rule is to permit company check pilots and company
&quot;instructors&quot; who may
| &gt; not otherwise be CFI's to train other company employees
in company
| &gt; aircraft. Unless you are paying this student to learn
from you, at your
| &gt; airline (which you have an Ops Spec's manual for, etc),
this exception
| &gt; isnt for you.
|
| What makes you say this? Why would there be any need to
allow an
| exemption for instruction of company pilots by company
instructors in
| company airplanes? To me this sounds like private carriage
and
| wouldn't need to be regulated at all...
|
| &gt; If you are operating under a part 91 instructional
flight, then no, you
| &gt; need to have a CFI certificate on your person, as
stated.
|
| I'm assuming that 119.1(e) 1 and 3 pretty much say that
getting paid
| to do &quot;student instruction&quot;, or &quot;training flights&quot; does
not fall under
| the 135 or 121 umbrella. Therefore they become allowable
to do with
| just a commercial license. Am I reading this wrong?

I'm pretty sure it wasn't quite 20 years ago, because I had to have one (or

I have. 3 separate times. If you want to operate under part 119, you
need to satisfy ALL the requirements, not just the ones you care to like.

If you are a commercial pilot operating in an air carrier environment,
then part 119 applies. Otherwise not.

What was the answer when you contacted the faa? Surely you wont just
take my word for it, but would ask one of their inspectors, right?

So you're saying if I wanted to do crop dusting, instruction flights,
banner towing, etc. I'm going to need to operate under all the
regulations in part 119? If I wanted to do instruction flights, I'm
going to have to comply with the rest of 119? The way I read it and
the way I've been lead to believe by other CFI's and even two DPE's,
is that the list is a set of operations that are _excluded_ from
applying to the rest of 119, meaning you are free to do those things
for pay as long as you have a commercial. But you're swearing up and
down it means something else.

Could you just please tell me straight up what that list in 119.1
exactly means?

Again.. dont take my word for it. Get it from the FAA. Thats who you
would answer to if you got ramped anyways. I'm done with this thread.

More than one person here has told you just what part 119 refers to. You
are choosing to not accept that. Thats your right. Go ask the person
with the authority - the guvmint.

According to the FAR's that I read from the FAA website, that &quot;list&quot; is
a list of operations that explicitly DO NOT FALL under part 119.
Therefore you arent operating under that chapter. If you operate under
119, all the previous stuff that you've read here SEVERAL TIMES already
applies.

Read it again.. yourself.. 119.1 (e)1-10. (e)contains some key words &quot;
Dont look in the test booklet. Dont look at cliff notes. The screenshot
you posted is telling you were to look in 119.1 regarding stuff that
DOESNT FALL UNDER 119.1

Except for operations when common carriage is not involved conducted
with airplanes having a passenger-seat configuration of 20 seats or
more, excluding any required crewmember seat, or a payload capacity of
6,000 pounds or more, THIS PART DOES NOT APPLY TO- (capitalization mine)

(followed by all the little examples)

Now im really done.. good luck with the ramp check.
