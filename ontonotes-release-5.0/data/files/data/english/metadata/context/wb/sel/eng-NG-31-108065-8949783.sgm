You want to raise your own cattle? I hope you have a big back yard.

Meat is going to have bacteria on it. Cattle have e-coli in their guts,
just like you do, so when you slaughter them that bacteria is going to
end up on the meat. In the case of hamburger it's going to get mixed in
when you grind it. The only way to eliminate it is to cook it or
irradiate it. This isn't new news, it's the reason that we've been
cooking our food for the last million years or so.

all animals got e.coli in their gut, including humans.
meat should not have e.coli on the surface unless the meat packing plant has poor
sanitary practices.

poisoning comes in when the meat contaminated on the outside is ground so that the
bacteria now is evenly distributed thru out the ground meat.  all meat has bacteria
ground into it, it just happens that this kind of e.coli is a strain that is very
toxic and infection requires a very small number of the toxic strain.   normally our
own e.coli prevents infection by other e.coli.

Know what your doing? Slaughter house workers are illiterate third world
immigrants, they were when Upton Sinclair wrote the Jungle and they are
now, and they always will be. They process millions of cattle a year
under the most oppressive conditions, contamination is inevitable. Good
practices can reduce the level of contamination but they can't eliminate
it unless then USDA is willing to mandate the use of irradiation which I
suspect won't be a popular move. You should just assume that hamburger
has e-coli and that chicken has salmonella. As long as you cook it
properly you won't have a problem.

I wonder if they will ever consider just irradiating meat.
That should take care of it, permanently.

One way to help with the ground meat problem is to simply grind your own
meat. I have a very nice meat grinder I bought on sale at Cabela's, and
fresh ground meat is superior to pre-made patties any day. ;-d

I don't think that will help with contaminated greens tho'.

There have been a LOT more issues with washed bagged greens and e-coli
than ground meat so going vegetarian won't totally avoid the problem
either.

All good points. ;-)
I cook chicken thoroughly and keep all surfaces well cleaned when I work
with it.

But, I like my beef rare, sometimes raw.

I've not purchase ground beef in ages but if I did, it would NOT be
pre-formed patties. Our local grocery store grinds fresh ground beef 4
times per day so it would probably be pretty good, but if I really
wanted a rare burger, I'd just go ahead and grind my own any more.

I personally don't have a problem with irradiated food. I don't see what
the big deal is.

When I do eat raw beef, it's very lean top or bottom round and I cube it
up myself just prior to consumption. I also rinse it well.

I agree with you on all of that. Beef is contaminated on the surface so
there is nothing wrong with eating a steak that's seared on the outside
and red on the inside (unless you are immune compromised). A hamburger is
a different story. If you grind the meat yourself or buy fresh ground
beef and use it immediately then a rare hamburger is fine. I only use
hamburger in spaghetti sauce where it's thoroughly cooked. Restaurants
won't server you a rare hamburger, it may be against the law or they
might just want to avoid lawsuits, so the choice isn't ours anymore. Rare
chicken isn't something that anyone really wants, I roast my chickens for
1.25 hours so that the skin is nice and crisp.

I don't think that there is any risk to irradiation but I don't know if
it would effect the taste. I wouldn't want my steaks irradiated if there
was any taste effects, I wouldn't object to hamburger and chicken being
irradiated. However most people are squeamish about radiation so the USDA
would have to allow the meat companies to call it Cold Pasteurization
instead of irradiation if they wanted people to buy it.

Indeed. Any bacteria on the surface of the meat gets mixed all in during
the grinding, then it multiplies if allowed to sit.

Too many people just don't understand.

From what I understand, you can take a piece of raw meat, hermetically
seal it in a mylar pouch and as long as that pouch goes undamaged, you
don't even have to freeze it! You could store raw meat on your pantry
shelves and it'd have a very long shelf life.

Maybe that is why they won't do it. &lt;g&gt; A lot of people toss away a lot
of spoiled and freezer burned foods.

I understand what you are saying. I do not and probably will not ever
trust GM foods, but that's not the same thing as irradiation treatment
to kill bacteria.

Cooking food alters it too. It's probably why I get a craving for raw
meat and raw egg yolks now and then (and I indulge myself!). In many
ways, raw foods are more nutritious than cooked foods, up to a point.

Many harder vegetables are more difficult to digest without cooking, so
you actually get MORE out of them by cooking them.

So, my point is, cooking alters your food.

I honestly don't know exactly what irradiation would do to food. Whether
or not it would harm it any more than cooking it does. ;-)

So, would it be beneficial in that it'd kill bacteria (which are more
sensitive to it) and would it _really_ harm or alter the food that much?

People fear what they don't understand. I'm still open minded about
treating food that way until I find reasons to not do so.

I'll do some googling on it when I have more time and see what I can
find out, if anything.

None of those foods listed for B12 on that site are natural foods, so,

Om, I agree that radiation will kill bacteria but salmonella and e. coli
= shit. I really don't want to irritate you but how much shit should we
be expected to eat? 1 microgram/kilo, 1 milligram/kilo, 1 gram/kilo,
more? This phony &quot;war on terror&quot; is supposed to make us safer, and we
are going to introduce more dirty bomb material into the social arena
while we are pissing off (re:oppressing) the developing world?

We can live healthier lives with less meat and eating less shit is just
a benefit. If people want to eat GMOs and eat irradiated meat, that is
fine by me but they need to be identified so that people like me don't
eat them by accident.  A free market only works with when buyer and
seller understand the transaction. At present, GMOs aren't identified.

i'd guess less. the reason the US has more instances of e.coli
contaminated meat is because they push the slaughter lines so
fast. US lines run almost twice as fast as lines in Europe are
allowed. if the packers were allowed to &quot;cold pasturize&quot; the

Yes, if you read my post stream I clearly said enriched when making
reference to foods.  I am not vegan, but the only thing I continue to
do which would make me NOT a vegan would be dairy and eggs.  I am
weaning off them.  Cows never eat a piece of meat and they become the
meat we eat to get what?  Grass and corn (which cattle don 't eat in
nature) turn into red meat.  I don't think any meat humans eat are
anything other than herbivores.  Go figure.

I use Solgar and &quot;Now&quot; brand a lot.

I'm wondering tho' where the B-12 is coming from?

If it is animal in source...

I'm not trying to be argumentative, I really am curious how you solve
the dilemma. Meat is getting to be too expensive, but for the first time
in my life I am NOT anemic! My Dr.s tell me it's due to my change in
diet in eating low carb and including meat in every meal.

My grocery bills are cheaper if I eat more fresh produce. I just have to
make sure that said produce is low in starch and sugar. (Not difficult
if one knows about the nutritional content of various types of veggies).

Pasta and grain are out. Period. So is most fruit.

See the problem?

Ok, but there it says eggs and dairy products which are animal in
origin.

And FORTIFIED veggie products.

Where is the B-12 coming from?
If it is being fortified from an animal source, one may as well continue
being lacto-ova.

One can raise their own chickens free range, and just not have a
rooster. Sterile eggs are not killing anything.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The myth that eating cholesterol laden foods raises serum cholesterol

&gt; None of those foods listed for B12 on that site are natural foods, so,
&gt; B12 is not naturally contained in any vegetable sources.  Yeast, yes.
&gt; Other fungi, not sure.

&gt; Vitamins are fine.  I tried some B12 tabs one time, but they kept giving

That is why I mentioned Brewers Yeast.

As far as I've been able to find, it is the ONLY unfortified plant
source of that very vital vitamin.

As for B12 supplements giving you the runs? There are sometimes other
things in supplements. ;-) Might want to try another brand before
discounting it.

Solgar VM-75 is high in B-complex and is an excellent supplement brand
to consider.

Please take a look at some of Stammet's research on wood consuming

His books are available on this website:

Many appear to contain natural anti-viral properties.

Shitake mushroom is a good place to start and iirc, turkey tail is
another. It's been awhile since I read his stuff... but they (him and
his staff) also respond well to e-mails.

Hope this helps?

A very good liver support herbal is Milk Thistle, widely available at

&gt; &gt; I think the point here is that irradiated shit is still
&gt; &gt; shit. If the radiation can kill the pathogens, what do you
&gt; &gt; think the consequences to meat processing would be. Tighter
&gt; &gt; control on sanitation or less?

&gt; i'd guess less. the reason the US has more instances of e.coli
&gt; contaminated meat is because they push the slaughter lines so
&gt; fast. US lines run almost twice as fast as lines in Europe are
&gt; allowed. if the packers were allowed to &quot;cold pasturize&quot; the
&gt; meat, they'd push the lines even faster. the faster those
&gt; poor, underpaid workers have to go, the more mistakes, from
&gt; live cattle on the line, to knife slips, to contamination.

&gt; &gt; Personally, I don't want my
&gt; &gt; food irradiated or genetically modified. My body does fine

&gt; was an 'oopsie' with the GM test rice... it has crosspolinated
&gt; with other rices &amp; all rice in the US now has GM genetics...
