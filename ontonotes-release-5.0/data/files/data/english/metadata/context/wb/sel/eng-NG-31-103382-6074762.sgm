Hi, my name is Aaron.  I think alot.  I am not extremely well-read, so
I know alot of my "ideas" not original.  That said, I'd like to share
some of the main points I have been thinking about lately:

Basic:
---------
(1) - The only thing I believe to exist with absolute certainty is my
consiousness.
(2) - I choose not to focus on (1) for lack of utility.
(3) - Biological based sensory defines the window through which I can
percieve reality.
(4) - Reason allows us to theorize on the nature of existance, based
on obvservations.
(5) - The obvservations in (4) are limited by the extent of
perception.
(6) - Truth defines expectations from the vantage of what we can
percieve.

Further Thoughts:
------------------------
(1) - Human consiousness cannot comprehend the beginning of time, or
how reality came to be.  We cannot comprhend something existing
without a creator.
(2) - Time is certainly an abstraction to describe what we percieve as
movement.
(3) - Space is certainly an abstraction to describe what we percieve
as the possibilites of movment.
(4) - Relativity is certainly an elegant theory which accounts for
many aspects of the reality we perceive.
(5) - Quantum Physics is also effective in it's accounting for aspects
of reality we percieve.

Where to go from here:
----------------------------------
(1) Consiousness is real.  The idea of the soul is irrelevnant, as if
it exists, it is also real.  The word "super-natural" has no value, as
if something is real, it is inherently natural.
(2) Empirical evidence suggests a very stong possibility that the
brain is a biological mechanism, from which consiousness emerges as an
artifact (consistent results of brain damage).
(3) The most advanced technology known to man is biological life.  DNA
is a form data storage - machine code, if you will, for biological
mechanisms to develop.  The mechanisms behind this may be formalized
and applied in non-biological systems, or used to create arbitrary
biological systems (way in the future - but I see no reason why not)
(4) "Spooky" is not an acceptable adjective in Quantum Physics.  If
action at a distance is observed, then it is as real and natural as
anything else.
(5) The idea that the act of observing something makes it real, and
particles follow all possible paths otherwise, is simply not
acceptable to me.

My BIG Therory:
------------------------
OK, so I've got this idea  to explain things - and I'm not sure if
it's a delusion of grandeur, totally idiotic, or an original thought.
How can I discuss it with someone without worrying that if it is
original, I won't lose credit for it.... that said, I'm pretty sure it
is either already been thought of or dumb- however, I'd like to find
out.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated,
Aaron

Hi Aaron,

We do not quickly take things for granted, so let's have a look at
your very first statement:
"The only thing I believe to exist with absolute certainty is my
consiousness."

How can you be sure that you were/are conscious?
Who are you, for starters, and where does "you" end and does "not-you"
begin?
Does your absolute certainty about your consciousness equate absolute
certainty about your identity?
Do you exist in one place and, if so, what are the co-ordinates?
To what period of time does your acclaimed consciousness refer?
Is your consciousness continuous, or does it come and go?

Note that we have no absolute certainty about your consciousness.
Perhaps the post resulted from an unconscious act, e.g. you were
sleepwalking while posting this in your sleep.
Or perhaps it was posted when someone dropped the mouse.
Even more interestingly, perhaps this post was the result of a
computer script testing something out.

Cheers!
Sam Carana

The truth is I am not sure.

That said, as far as I can tell, I need to pick a starting point.  If
I do not have "faith", if you will, in anything, than I cannot see any
alternative other than to "believe in nothing" - and that is kind of
depressing :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Well, this is a question of great interest to me.  From my point of
view, reality is a continuous reaction of what we percieve to be
particles/energy/light, etc..... From this reaction, it seems, the
thing we call life can arise.

I do not believe I "begin" or there is a definiative "me" or "not me".

Based on the perception and reason I am afforded, the most likely
scenario is there is some kind of intrinsic ratio which relates
complexity to consiousness.

The bird brain has a level of complexity.

The dog brain has a level of complexity.

The bonobo brain has a level of complexity.

The human brain has a level of complexity.

My slowly deteriorating grandpa's brain has a level of complexity,
which is decreasing with time.

I "am" but I do not think I "begin" or become "me" at a certain point
- the universe appears to be a continous process, thus the notion of a
"definite" moment seems to me an abstraction, and possibly a human
born fallacy of thought.

Hi Aaron,
welcome aboard.
A have a few questions: does your thinking alot makes you happy?
Does your thinking alot explain things for real? Do you really need
explanations? When they arrive, do they satisfy you for good or are
they just a momentary settlement of your thinking alot?

Regards

Tonguessy

===============================================
Hi Aaron,
Sam tried (and failed) to undermine your belief
in your own consiousness. If I were you, I would
not worry and would answer as you can see below
inline. To make my proposed answers not personal
I label them "X".

===============================================
X:
Typing these words I'm aware of observing a screen,
a keyboard on a table, within a room, etc. Now,
I am not certain about those objects of my
observation.
They may be hallucinations, I may be dreaming, so
I question, I doubt their existence and exactitude.
But I'm certainly aware of observing them, doubtful
as they may be. This Awareness, or consciousness
if you prefer, is indeed the only thing that exists
FOR ME with absolute certainty. The Awareness
of this permanent doubt is beyond any doubt.
The question is reversed: I can in no way conceive
or imagine not being aware. An it's not "my
Awareness", nor "me BEING aware": I am "Awareness"
and nothing else, and Awareness is me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

===============================================
X:
There is no "me", nor any "no-me", there is
nothing to begin, all is Awareness. Now, Awareness
is thematic, "Awareness(of)" and its theme, the
"Universe", is structured encompassing such "objects"
as "I", "the Other", etc., but that concerns
Psychology. We are here at the much deeper level
of Ontology, at which "I==Awareness" and nothing
else.
===============================================
S:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Does your absolute certainty about your
&gt; consciousness equate absolute
&gt; certainty about your identity?

===============================================
X:
"Identity" comes much later among the thematic
objects of Awareness, when I become aware of
"Others". At our fundamental level "identity"
stays undefined.
===============================================

&gt; and go?
">

===============================================
X:
SpaceTime is an object of Awareness, so SpaceTime
exists in Awareness and not Awareness in SpaceTime.
"Co-ordinates" is a particularly silly remark,
as they are abstract mathematical constructs having
nothing to do with SpaceTime existing in Awareness.
I could live a whole life, aware of SpaceTime and
totally ignoring such abstractions as "coordinates",
"trajectories", "geodesics", "manifolds", etc.
Opposing "continuous" to "come and go" simply
denotes ignorance of the term "continuous".

Absolute brilliant post Aaron.

I have also been occupied with the notion that in any argument or kind of
reasoning about any subject, we always use a Starting Point without
realising that. Mostly that starting point is a word, like 'consciousness',
'time', 'I', etc. Indeed after investigating, there is no such starting
point possible. In my view, that is because a starting point is an
artificially self constructed, finite boundary that separates that
imaginative point from all the rest, which is not possible in reality.
Everything is infinite.

Cheers.

Jan

Hello Aaron

Welcome aboard

Intersting posting, although too many points to discuss or be aware
of, I suggest you to post narrower subjects because most probably this
will be distorted shortly

I also will comment your first line only

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (1) - The only thing I believe to exist with absolute certainty is my
&gt; consiousness.
">

I prefer to distrust everything arising from consciousness, first
because this is just a word, which in reality defines nothing. Even if
Georges describes sharply the act of perceiving, the very trap is in
the word 'I'
Nobody stops to question what this I is, is taken as granted, and
equivalent wrongly to consciousness.

Why kids refer to themselves in the third person? Answers are not so

So this I is not so transparent nor the consciousness claimed.

And of course you can say ok, may be this is complex, but I´m just
saying consiousness exists. Let me remind if this is the case you did
not say that.

&gt; &gt; Hi Aaron,

&gt; &gt; We do not quickly take things for granted, so let's have a look at
&gt; &gt; your very first statement:
&gt; &gt; &quot;The only thing I believe to exist with absolute certainty is my
&gt; &gt; consiousness.&quot;

&gt; &gt; How can you be sure that you were/are conscious?

&gt; The truth is I am not sure.
">

Sam:
Does that mean you withdraw the "absolute certainty" statement? Or
does that mean there was merely uncertainty about our existence, while
there was absolute certainty that you existed? Isn't that a rather
self-centered or even arrogant effort to communicate, to the extent
that it constitutes an obstacle to 'true' communication?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That said, as far as I can tell, I need to pick a starting point.  If
&gt; I do not have &quot;faith&quot;, if you will, in anything, than I cannot see any
&gt; alternative other than to &quot;believe in nothing&quot; - and that is kind of
&gt; depressing :)
">

Sam:
It now appears that you seek to justify that statement (about the
absolute certainty that you existed) on the basis of a perceived need
for a starting point; let's examine this a bit further.

As Jan questioned, isn't such a starting point an artificial
construct, seemingly at odds with the more continuous character of
nature in which things transform into other things rather than just
start out of the blue.

I also agree with einseele, who quite eloquently points out that,
firstly, your belief in your consciousness is just that, it's self-
admittedly a belief, it's taken on faith, if you like, rather than an
indisputable fact that was absolutely certain. Secondly, as einseele
points out, the statement is made up of words, such as 'I', 'you' and
'consciousness'. Words and languages are artificial constructs, they
can hardly be taken as the basis, since they are preceded by
environments in which such languages developed. From an evolutionary
perspective, use of language only developed recently, which makes it
hard to take it as a starting point.

Furthermore, if there was such a need for a starting point, then why
select something so complex, hardly-tangible, almost esoteric and
spiritual as consciousness?
Einstein was smarter, he picked the speed of light as a constant and
it took quantum experiments showing evidence of entanglement to shake
that position. Consciousness, on the other hand, seems too hard to
even define. Technically, computers can communicate using scripts
written in computer-language, but that fact doesn't give us absolute
certainty that such a computer was conscious, does it? From an
epistemological perspective, a refusal to call into question things
like "consciousness" constitues an obstacle to epistemological
reflection (as well as to scientific research).

Finally, no individual exists in isolation. Let me rephrase that - if
there was any individual who existed in isolation, we don't need to
bother about it. Communication and interaction is the lifeblood of our
existence. As said, from an evolutionary perspective, concepts like
'I', 'you' and 'consciousness' have developed in social environments,
which gives these concepts the lesser claim to be the starting point
than the underlying social environments. Physically spoken, people
change, not only over the years, but every second. The idea of a
continuously existing person is a legal concept that goes hand in hand
with contract law within a political system that evolves around
ownership. Such a system may uphold ownership claims by another person
(or company) over your person. Politically spoken, such a self-
centered and self-righteous approach is dictatorial, it takes the
prevalence of one person's word for granted, while at best questioning
but more likely suppressing other people's right to have a say. Even
speaking about 'subjects' (plural) still pictures a monarch on a
throne, selecting a single person as speaker. Indeed, the fact that
some words start with a capital (including 'I') points at a background
of titles that depict class, which survive today in the form of
scientists who insist they should be addressed with 'Dr'. More
democratic political systems will deconstruct that picture and will
seek to improve things, taking into account the entire landscape of
communication and social interaction.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Who are you, for starters, and where does &quot;you&quot; end and does &quot;not-you&quot;
&gt; &gt; begin?

&gt; Well, this is a question of great interest to me.  From my point of
&gt; view, reality is a continuous reaction of what we percieve to be
&gt; particles/energy/light, etc..... From this reaction, it seems, the
&gt; thing we call life can arise.
">

Sam:
Reality is what we perceive? Are you not part of reality? Why start
again with 'you' as if you were not part of reality and observing
reality from the outside? Why not take reality itself as the starting
point?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I do not believe I &quot;begin&quot; or there is a definiative &quot;me&quot; or &quot;not me&quot;.

&gt; Based on the perception and reason I am afforded, the most likely
&gt; scenario is there is some kind of intrinsic ratio which relates
&gt; complexity to consiousness.

&gt; The bird brain has a level of complexity.

&gt; The dog brain has a level of complexity.

&gt; The bonobo brain has a level of complexity.

&gt; The human brain has a level of complexity.

&gt; My slowly deteriorating grandpa's brain has a level of complexity,
&gt; which is decreasing with time.
">

Sam:
Well, such examples only show the can of worms that is opened when
taking consciousness as a starting point. Who is allowed to exist?
Only those who have reached a certain point of enlightened
consciouness? Would you address a baby with 'you'? Or, wouldn't you
talk about a baby as him or her, but talk about 'it'? Do you believe
that a baby doesn't deserve a name and was just an object? Is that
what you're saying?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I &quot;am&quot; but I do not think I &quot;begin&quot; or become &quot;me&quot; at a certain point

&gt; born fallacy of thought.
">

Sam:
So, you weren't born as a baby, you've always been there? Your
puzzling look sounds naive and inconsistent. After all, couldn't the
tendency to use words like 'I', 'you' and 'conscious' similarly be a
possible human born fallicy of thought that survived because it turned
out to be useful at some stage in the evolution, to be superseded by
things more useful? If so, how does that rhyme with the abolute
certainty of the concept 'you'?

Elogy of Naive View
===============================================
Naive View, usually called Naive Realism or
Common Sense Realism claims that there is a
Reality directly perceivable and cognizable
consisting of Objects composed of Matter,
occupying Space and having properties such as
size, shape, texture, smell, taste and colour
exactly as we perceive them. They are there
independent of and inaffected by observations
or their absence.

Naive Common Sense guided original Humans in
their struggle for survival, which left them
no time, nor motivation for abstract inquiries.
However, once they reached some stable security
and leisure, they started to reason for reasoning
sake. And whether we call this reasoning Rationality,
Philosophy, Science, Epistemology, Psychology,
Ethics or Esthetics, it consists in trying to
overcome the Naive View. The whole history of
Philosophy and Science boils down to this endeavor
which was never finished and continues at our
own days with unprecedented vigor.

It may seem strange that after nearly 3000 years
of incessant philosophical and scientific
inquiries, the majority of Humans stay as naive
as their prehistoric ancestors. Only few follow
Horace's and Kant's "Sapere Aude", "Dare to Reason",
due to mental laziness and cowardice in face of
the establishment.

It's neiarly impossible to discuss with Naive View
mainly due to the inadequiacy of the language.
It has been created and developed in order to
express the Naive Common Sense and to support
Humans in their struggle for survival. Concepts
extending beyond the Naive View have no designation
in the language. We can only hint rational gist
hidden behind naive terms and may communicate only
in hope that the interlocutor will be willing to
get the hint and not to take the words at their face
value.

One of the most muddled areas is that of Awareness.
Naive View sees "Me" or "I" as object of naive Reality
and "my" Awareness as one of the properties of the
object "I", or perhaps as an object associated with
the object "I", via another associated object "my
brain", of which it would be some sort of excrement.

It's impossible to express the idea of "absolute",
Awareness as universal foundation, else than by
hinting it and the hint will have some trouble to
pass even with the best will of the interlocutor.
Hurting the wall of conceited ill will spiced up
with ignorance one abandons all hope to communicate.

Naivete does not necessarily imply ignorance. One
reads with a certain surprise Feynman's naive
philosophical interpretations of the Quantum Theory.
Surprise, no more, because he is at least most
competent in the area which he misinterpretes
and, most important, does not infect his Physics
importing to it his misinterpretations.

But it's with nausea that one reads Russell's naive
divagations which, in spite of his detailed formal
competence, he imported to Logic and raised to a
cornerstone of the absurd Predicate Logic dominating
currently the established Foundations of Mathematics
and Science.

And one has a good laugh reading the most asinine,
naive assertion of established Science, the Goedel's
Theorem.

Sam's post is an elogy of Naive View in its stone age
level precluding any discussion else than rewriting
the
whole history of Philosophy and Science. One reads it
with embarrassment because of its conceited ignorance
interwoven with naivety. For some strange reason Sam
likes to preach what he ignores. He wrote long sermons
about electric networks obviously ignoring what
"network" means. In the present case he talks about
some "starting point" whatever it may mean
and gratifies us with a particularly savory piece
of conceited ignorance, preaching:

"Einstein was smarter, he picked the speed of light as
a constant and it took quantum experiments showing
evidence of entanglement to shake that position."

It were Michelson-Morley who observed the fact of
invariance of C. Einstein did not "pick" anything, but
just learned this fact and made a Model compatible
with it. It's not a "position", whatever that may
mean,
but a fact. And so far no experiment, quantum or
flamenco, has shaken this fact.

One is tempted to call "Sapere Aude", but it won't
work. The overwhelming majority will prefer laziness
and cowardice.

Georges.

Hi, I'm really easy going, and I am at a point where I have realised
that arguing or antogonizing on usenet is not a fruitful venture (FOR
ME, I'm not judging other here).  So anyway,

When you re-wrote my statement, I *think* you added meaning that I did
not intend to imply.

See, I just don't see any choice but to believe in my consiousness,
since I feel it every day, and though it blanks out when I sleep, it
is there again when I wake up.

"Awareness" is a strange word.  It is a word for something which
nobody knows the definition.  When "i am aware", the I can only
describe it as "I am aware"

G:
You hit the nail on the head. "Awareness" founds and
defines everything, so it cannot be defined.
Our Universe is relative, but it is founded in
the unique Absolute - "Awareness" and it's impossible
to assert anything about Absolute.
Actually, even "I am aware" is improper, because there
is there no "I" to be aware, but the "I" is founded
in Awareness. All one could say is "AWARE".

You seemed to have missed the fact that I didn't introduce the concept of a
'starting point', Georges, I merely argued that if one does take a starting
point then 'consciousness' seems not the best choice. Yes, George, networks
can be very empowering, I agree and I strongly encourage that, as I have
done in many earlier posts. By contrast, deterministic science, identity and
concepts such as 'consciousness' and 'I' are part of obsolete church and
civil cultures that do very little to empower people and should be exposed
as such.

Fixed speed of light is not a fact, it simply depends on how you define
things. If you define everything on the basis that light's speed was fixed,
then indeed it may look as if you had to change the texture of time and
space to accomodate such a fixation, and if all your measuring methods and
equipment were further based on the assumption that the speed of light was
constant, then that will be the likely outcome of your measurements. But
that position is challenged fundamentally by quantum expriments. Einstein
did pick the speed of light as his 'absolute certainty', because - as he put
it - God doesn't play dice. Nonetheless, when particles are entangled as
observed in quantum experiments, you can change the status of one and the
status of the other one will change accordingly and instantaneously,
implying that information was transmitted at a speed faster than that of
light. Quantum computers work instantaneously, i.e. faster than the speed of
light.

Poor Sam! As you would not understand a simplest
handbook, just Google "Michelson-Morley". C was
univerally defined as covariant ("variable")
by GalileanTransformation, i.e. transforming
additively as a fellow walking in a train.
M-M designed and carried out their experiment
in orded to prove empirically the universally
defined and admitted principle of C being
additively "variable".
To the astoundment of M-M themselves and of the
total scientific community, to the greatest
surprise in the history of science, the experiment
proved EMPIRICALLY that C was invariant.
Against the universal conviction, biases and
purpose of the experiment's design the empiric
fact prevailed.
At the moment of M-M time and space were universally
considered as absolute and invariant and C as
additively variable. There was no Extended
Relativity, no Lorentz Transformations, no Minkowski
#Space.
The empirically established fact of C invariance
shattered all these concepts and lead to the
Extended Relativity with relative LightTime #Space.
Not the other way round as you seem to believe in
your ignorance.

Einstein's religious beliefs were his personal

no bearing on his Science. As to "dices" he
alluded not to C, but to Quantum Uncertainty
and randomness which he believed binding our
limited cognition, but not God.
You obviously don't know enough Physics to follow
a simplest handbook, so look at Wikipedia's
vulgarization of Quantum Entanglement. It says
not quite rigorously, but in language that even
you should understand that:

"Observations on entangled states naively appear
to conflict with the property of relativity that
information cannot be transferred faster than the
speed of light. Although two entangled systems
appear to interact across large spatial separations,
no useful information can be transmitted in this way".

Note "NAIVELY" addressing you by some sort of
instantaneous teleportation. Note also that QT
is just a recipe of equations reposing only on
discreteness and lacking a definition of
continuous #Space. Thus "spatial separations"
and time relations such as simultaneity are
undefined.

In the physically meaningful Model of Quantum Field
Theory there is no Entanglement, only somehow
analogous and physically meaningful Reeh–Schlieder
theorem.

There are no "instantaneous" Quantum Computers
and will never be. For the moment there are no
practical size Q Computers. Theory and small
labo experiments point to possible Q Computers,
which may be much, or very much faster than
current ones, but nobody having a bit of sense
talks about instantaneity, or super luminal speeds.

You did not get the gist of my previous post which
resumes in:

"Sam's post is an elogy of Naive View in its stone
age level precluding any discussion else than
rewriting the whole history of Philosophy and
Science."

If you chose to be a troglodyte grunting ineptnesses
about human theought over a lag of 3000 years, it's
your problem, I'm not going to rewrite for you the
whole history, which anyway you would not notice
in your obstinacy. I'll just throw your grunts to
trash with an NTP.

But if you want to quit your cave and Dare to Reason,
I could gladly help, or, if you decline it, suggest
that you buy some almanac of vulgarized history of
Philosophy and Science.

Well, you use it too, even arguing that it is bullshit. Following your

scientific minefield and if that's were you base your scientific

stop hiding behind that homunculus and face reality, Georges. There's

Sam:
Electric power grids can be empowering too, but while most people are
becoming more conscious about global warming, you seem to be the one
who is out of touch with science, George. There is overwhelming
evidence that recent global warming is mostly caused by human
activity. Face reality, Georges, and stop dancing flamenco.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; By contrast,&gt; deterministic science, identity and

&gt; ===============================================
&gt; G:
&gt; Congratulations, even you may say (by inadvertence?)
&gt; something right: deterministic science was dead
&gt; with Galileo and Descartes, tried to resurrect
&gt; with Aether and vanished with Extended Relativity.
&gt; By contrast, as you say, &quot;consciousness&quot;, &quot;I&quot;,
&gt; &quot;awareness&quot;, &quot;subjectivity&quot;(as foundation of
&gt; Ontology, Epistemology, Psychology and Science)
&gt; are, whether rightly or wrongly, cornerstones of
&gt; contemporary thought.

Sam:
So, why do you seem unable to follow epistemological argument,
Georges? As I said, communication, politics, trade and social
interaction each have a far greater claim to be driving developments
in epistemology and contemporary thought than the dark philosophical
cave of subjectivity.

&gt; Fixed speed of light is not a fact, it simply
&gt; &gt; depends on how you define
&gt; &gt; things. If you define everything on the basis that
&gt; &gt; light's speed was fixed,
&gt; &gt; then indeed it may look as if you had to change the
&gt; &gt; texture of time and
&gt; &gt; space to accomodate such a fixation, and if all your
&gt; &gt; measuring methods and
&gt; &gt; equipment were further based on the assumption that
&gt; &gt; the speed of light was
&gt; &gt; constant, then that will be the likely outcome of
&gt; &gt; your measurements.

&gt; ===============================================
&gt; G:
&gt; Poor Sam! As you would not understand a simplest
&gt; handbook, just Google &quot;Michelson-Morley&quot;. C was
&gt; univerally defined as covariant (&quot;variable&quot;)
&gt; by GalileanTransformation, i.e. transforming
&gt; additively as a fellow walking in a train.
&gt; M-M designed and carried out their experiment
&gt; in orded to prove empirically the universally
&gt; defined and admitted principle of C being
&gt; additively &quot;variable&quot;.
&gt; To the astoundment of M-M themselves and of the
&gt; total scientific community, to the greatest
&gt; surprise in the history of science, the experiment
&gt; proved EMPIRICALLY that C was invariant.
&gt; Against the universal conviction, biases and
&gt; purpose of the experiment's design the empiric
&gt; fact prevailed.
&gt; At the moment of M-M time and space were universally
&gt; considered as absolute and invariant and C as
&gt; additively variable. There was no Extended
&gt; Relativity, no Lorentz Transformations, no Minkowski
&gt; #Space.
&gt; The empirically established fact of C invariance
&gt; shattered all these concepts and lead to the
&gt; Extended Relativity with relative LightTime #Space.
&gt; Not the other way round as you seem to believe in
&gt; your ignorance.
">

Sam:
This theory only holds within a specific frame of reference, Georges,
it's basically circular rhetoric. Entangled particles cannot be
explained in these terms, in fact, they blow away the entire house of
cards. You can pretend that entanglement doesn't exist, but it's been
shown in experiments many years ago. Face reality, Georges!

&gt; ===============================================
&gt; But&gt; that position is challenged fundamentally by quantum
&gt; &gt; expriments. Einstein
&gt; &gt; did pick the speed of light as his 'absolute
&gt; &gt; certainty', because - as he put
&gt; &gt; it - God doesn't play dice. Nonetheless, when
&gt; &gt; particles are entangled as
&gt; &gt; observed in quantum experiments, you can change the
&gt; &gt; status of one and the
&gt; &gt; status of the other one will change accordingly and
&gt; &gt; instantaneously,
&gt; &gt; implying that information was transmitted at a speed
&gt; &gt; faster than that of
&gt; &gt; light. Quantum computers work instantaneously, i.e.
&gt; &gt; faster than the speed of
&gt; &gt; light.

&gt; ===============================================
&gt; G:
&gt; Poor Sam! Whatever you may think, if one may
&gt; call it thinking, C is empiric fact and no
&gt; &quot;position&quot;.
&gt; Einstein's religious beliefs were his personal
&gt; problem and he could perfectly believe, if he
&gt; wanted, that God dances flamenco, but that has
&gt; no bearing on his Science. As to &quot;dices&quot; he
&gt; alluded not to C, but to Quantum Uncertainty
&gt; and randomness which he believed binding our

Even if there were no practical applications (yet), that doesn't mean
it was bad science. You cannot ignore the entire are4a of theoretical
science on the ground that it wasn't practical. Moreover, much
progress is being made in the area of quantum computing.

Nor little, nor dense, nor ball, nor matter, nor when, make any sense
describing the BB.

So if you cannot accept the BB, why do you think a creator is
acceptable?

In my imagery BB is Brigitte Bardot, and no Big Bang will ever change
this.
This said i still prefer a life of practical things cleared of
questionable issues like Small, Medium or Big Bangs, Gods or any other
presumed event/entity.

That's a tough question. One may only speculate if these may be clues:
1. Inflation
2. Brane-brane collision

It may also be helpful to remember that matter can be created out of
the vacuum with sufficient energy -- happens as close to us as in our
upper atmosphere all the time. But matter and antimatter are both
created, while the observed universe is mostly matter. Also, the
question: Why was their energy? remains, which may, to a physicist, be
a purely academic one (cause there might well have been none, in which
case we wouldn't be here to ask the question, or some other amount, in
which case we'd still ask the same question).

This is a very interesting point.
Matter created out of vacuum will totally explain gravity in the end.
I think this point is central. I mean it from an epistemologic point
of view
It represents a topological situation which can be expanded to all
knowledge fields, including non scientific subjects.

I believe, please advice, that the opposite direction is needed as
well, it means antimatter, antigravity, antiforces would reverse the
process from matter to vaccum, giving us a kind of 0 sum

I think also this can be represented by the following riddle
There is a numeric sequence, whichever. Made of lets say 1 millon
digits. And lets say is based on 4 letters, signs, positions, anything
alike. A base of 4.
I think about 4 just because the genetic code, but could be any other
base, binary, decimal, whatever.

Can this sequence be represented by another, lesser, which does not
leave the base limitation, in this case 4.
Represented means I can rebuild the larger sequence from within the
shorter
This would mirror matter coming (back) from vacuum

Sorry to all in case this is too obscure or idiotic
