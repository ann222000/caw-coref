every time i tell shaka how bad a movie is he says he'll have to watch
it-put this on your list shaka.

i don't know if this was supposed to be tongue in cheek or what-if so
i hope savini bit his tongue off.

Savini was totally over the top.

***I didn't think this was THAT bad, though I wish it wasn't attached in any
way to Romero's Dead movies. Did Savini direct this? I've certainly seen
worse zombie flicks.

Thanks for the warning Chewy.  There are very few things that are more offensive than a poorly made zombie movie.  I will avoid this one.

Every new film maker sems to feel the need to make a zombie movie.
It's cheap and easy, and people love zombie movies. Me, I don't feel
like you should make a movie about an established mythos unless you
can add something new and original to it. Or, make it a comedy. Or a
parody. May I recommend a cheap little indy called HIDE AND CREEP.
And oh yes, it is cheesy. Incredibly so. It's also funny as hell.

It just occurred to me that I should flop 90's SCI-FI week with CRAVEN week because of how the Oct 31 is in the middle of the week.
So:

LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT
CRAVEN
1972

THE HILLS HAVE EYES
CRAVEN
1977
BERRYMAN
NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET
CRAVEN
1984
ENGLAND
NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2

1985
ENGLAND
THE HILLS HAVE EYES 2
CRAVEN
1985
BERRYMAN
DEADLY FRIEND

CRAVEN
1986

I liked Deadly Friend quite a lot.

A 15 year old scientific whiz kid named Paul Conway, just moved to a
new town with his mother. He also has a yellow robot named Beebee
which is his friend and protector. Paul befriends the girl next door
named Samantha, and she lives with her abusive father who knocks her
down some stairs one night and severely injures her. She was on life
support in the local hospital, but after a certain amount of time,
they pulled the plug on her and she was dead. Paul disguises himself
as a hospital worker and takes Samantha's body from the hospital over
to the local university. As an attempt to save her life, he implants
Beebee's robot microchips into her brain, but discovers not too long
after that she is out of control.

This is an amusing idea, executed in an amusing way.

http://thesuperest.com/

A super-battle of super-heroes. Actually, of the super-artists who draw
them. One guy draws a superhero; the other draws a hero with some power
that can beat the first. Then the first guy draws another who can beat
that guy, and so on. Quite clever. For some reason they're arranged
bottom to top, so start at the bottom and scroll up.

I didnt think it any near as bad as I had alwasy heard it was.  Michael Berryman gets top billing, although he is not the main character.  The cannibal girl Ruby is back as a civilized person and that was interesting, but could have been far more interesting than it was.  The young blonde guy has a scene at the very beginning.  His presence adds credibility to the film, although the inclusion of the character seemed somewhat pointless to me.  Also puzzling to me as that they actually brought back the character of Beast, the German Shepherd from the first film: neat, but I'm not sure why they did it.

Not scary; entertaining, but it kind of reminded me of a teens-buck-the-system movie that had a bit of gore and some morbidity.  I think it may have been inspired by Rollins LIVING DEAD GIRL, although the box art compared it to BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.
All this is fine, until you consider that this is from the same guy who made LAST HOUSE and HILLS HAVE EYES.

I didnt think it any near as bad as I had alwasy heard it was.  Michael Berryman gets top billing, although he is not the main character.  The cannibal girl Ruby is back as a civilized person and that was interesting, but could have been far more interesting than it was.  The young blonde guy has a scene at the very beginning.  His presence adds credibility to the film, although the inclusion of the character seemed somewhat pointless to me.  Also puzzling to me as that they actually brought back the character of Beast, the German Shepherd from the first film: neat, but I'm not sure why they did it.

&quot;I like this more every time I see it.  Simple, yet well done.  And
Michael Berryman is great.&quot;

Way way better than the crappy remake, but what else is new. And
Michael Berryman is a hell of a nice guy. I'm only sorry he's never
gotten many opportunities to play comedy, which he's very very good
at.
