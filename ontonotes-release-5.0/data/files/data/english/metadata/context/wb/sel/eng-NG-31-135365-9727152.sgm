&quot;8 long months&quot;...  &quot;kept me on the line&quot;...  Hmm...  Those phrases
really ring a bell...

I've been going through old e-mails.  These are all perfectly
accurate copy-and-paste e-mail quotes from electrochrome to me.  I
had to actually build this compilation and e-mail it to him in
mid-October of last year to get to send me a set that he had &quot;KEPT
ME ON THE LINE&quot; and been dangling and promising and LYING ABOUT
SENDING for... let's see... how long?  Oh yes.

TEN LONG MONTHS:

Novenber 26, 2006 to October 12, 2007 ... more than TEN LONG
MONTHS.

After I sent electrochrome the above compilation and shamed him for
being such a deadbeat, he did deliver the disks about two weeks
later, so it was actually

ELEVEN LONG MONTHS

that he &quot;kept me on the line&quot;.  And he wonders why he's been banned
from every major online forum in the entire trading world, and
unmoderated Usenet is the last place where he can scream his head
off at all of the good traders who still behave responsibly and
treat their trading partners with nonesty and respect.  It's
because he's a sneaky, stalling, lying, backstabbing, two-faced
little creep.

I'm going to look up this Lord Smurf guy.  I'll bet he's a pretty
good trader if the hysterical and insane electrochrome hates him!

He has had 2 discs of mine for months and months which he said he
misplaced, and he specifically told me that he had no intention of
looking for them, that, by his own admission, this has happened to him
before because he's disorganized, and he's found that he never finds
stuff if he goes looking for them and that they'll turn up &quot;eventually&quot;
and will return them at that time.  It's been at least six months,
possibly more, with no end in sight.  I have saved every bit of
correspondence since this whole thing started.

I sent him those two discs, of the same film, because both were
experiencing playback problems and he offered to re-record the film onto
a new disc, correcting as many problems as possible along the way, and
to be perfectly fair, he did that and sent me the corrected copy, but
only after nagging him for it many times, but the originals were not
included.  I told him I wanted the originals back so that another friend
might have a shot at them since he was unable to correct all the
problems.  Now it's not his fault if a problem was so bad he couldn't
correct it, but I just want my originals back so that someone else might
try, but as time marches on, hope is fading that I will ever get them
back.  The fact that he did provide a copy is the only reason I have
been reluctant to post a bad trader warning, but this has become
unacceptable.

I realize that now I probably never will see their return, even if he
does &quot;eventually&quot; find them, but it feels good to vent.

Oh, I sent his part of the trade immediately, by the way.

Trader beware, electrochrome has taken procrastination to an art form.
If you decide to deal with him, make him send first.

Most sincerely...
Alan

So, I may never get my &quot;Line of Fire&quot; and &quot;Lyon's Den&quot; originals I sent up

... he was trying to make himself look grand and generous and
magnanimous in the face of all of the evidence being brought
forward to the contrary.  I've had several complete rounds with
him, but I've always had to wring out every drop I ever got from
him over a period of months.  Anyway, he stated here, publicly,
that he'd send them, so I'd say he probably will...

... eventually.

But tell us, please, Rob, how long has it been already?

I remember you telling me about that in e-mail, way back in the
summer.  Months ago.  And you still don't have them.

Well, a lot of people besides you tried to warn me about him, but I
didn't listen, and look where it got me.  Several so-so rounds that
I had to rattle his cage to get completed, being stalled for eleven
months on one of them, and then to suddenly and unexpectedly have a
pitchfork stuck in my back here in the newsgroup after having never
said a bad word about him.

Traders, be warned.  Even if you do ignore those of us who have
been stung by this conniving sewer rat and do get a good trade out
of him, you'll still someday wake up to a screaming hysterical
ranting post of hatred from him, out of the blue and for no reason
at all, just like he did to me.

Gimme a break, Rob, Funnybook is lying though his teeth. I already
shipped you
your discs back. Moreover, I included copies of the complete run of
LINE OF FIRE.
So when you get the discs, you'll have one series complete and the
other, 2 discs
you sent me.

Go ahead, Rob. Check your mail box in about a week (give or take, it
takes a
while for discs to get to Canada). Then you can tell everyone how you
&quot;never
got your discs back.&quot;

Funnybook is lying. He's wacked out.

Hey...

Can I get a copy of the Windahm Hill Music Video DVD-R's?

I don't even mind waiting 11 months for them as long as they show
up ;)

Do they include the Shadowfax video &quot;What Goes Around&quot;??

Would love to obtain a clean Stereo Copy of it.

Do please e-mail me directly... Thanks,

Peter (Plarocks)
