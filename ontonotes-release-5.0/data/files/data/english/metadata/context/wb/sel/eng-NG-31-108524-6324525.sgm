Hi all, hope thisn is the best place to ask this.....
In the future I will take photo's with ccd camera and/or webcam through a
14" Meade SCT
will also be using stacker.
My question is: Some people use stacker and then use adope photoshop to
'enhance' the result. Some of your photo's are amazing !!!!!!
What version of photoshop do I have to buy?
The complete version?
a.. Full from ? 833.69       ($1000  ???)

Is very expensive. Or is a lesser version also enough for astro-photografie.

Please don't flame me if i am at the wrong place, just trying to get some
help from experienced guru's  :-)

Thanks

You don't "have" to have Photoshop to do good images. It's a great
program, sure, but for many of us it's really a smidge overpowered for
our purposes. Some alternatives? Paintshop Pro is a very capable and
reasonably priced program. Photoshop Elements, made by Adobe is also
very good, and includes most of the tools from Photoshop you'll need.
Most programs for image acquisition/camera operation (like CCDsoft)
will be able to do a fair amount of image processing, too.

The advantages of the most recent Photoshop release? Its ability to
handle 16 bit image files. And it's ability to handle "plugins." You
can, for example, get plugins that are especially designed to apply
processing of interest to astronomical imagers. You can also get a
plugin that will allow Photoshop to read FITS files.

My opinion? Most people for sure don't need Photoshop in the
beginning. Get Paintship Pro or Elements or a share/freeware program
like GIMP and use the money you "save" on a better camera.

A lot of people say that the GIMP is more versatile in certain areas
than Photoshop.  I use them both (GIMP coming free with my Linux
package) but mostly use other graphics packages for "everyday" type
stuff.

Hi:

I like GIMP a lot. Unless I'm mistaken, however, it's only available
for Linux/Unix, right? That, I'm afraid, is a pretty significant
drawback for most folks.

The Gimp runs fine under Windows. IMO, however, its lack of adjustment
layers is a serious limitation for astronomical image processing. Your
suggestion of Paint Shop Pro is much better for those on a tight budget.

Others have pointed out that alternatives exist, but IMO an investment
in Photoshop CS2 is something you'll never regret. Most other programs
have various limitations for technical image processing (just look at
their most touted features, things like red eye reduction and instant
skin color corrections).

I don't know what kind of options you have buying Photoshop in Europe.
In the U.S., it is quite easy to get Photoshop at an academic price of
well under $300. All you need is to be in school, be affiliated in
several ways with a school, or have kids in school. You might want to
explore that option.

IRIS is a free program written by Christian Buil for processing
astronomical images. A bit hard to use if you are not used to command
line, but very, very powerful:

For simple stuff and everyday graphics manip use, I recommend Paint.Net
http://www.getpaint.net

It's not as jam packed a GIMP but for those who might be bewildered by all
the seldom used feature and tools in GIMP and the commercial packages and
for quick, routine jobs, it's  very nice. And FREE.

Adobe Photoshop Elements is powerful enough to handle your needs. The
full version of Photoshop is expensive, and is only worth it if you are
planning to expand your photography horizons. One should not buy
Photoshop CS2 just now, however; Photoshop CS3 is just around the
corner.

It is my understanding from Adobe that there will not be a new version
of Photoshop Elements /in/ /the/ /near/ /future/ because they Adobe has
been putting all of its resources into a complete revision of Creative
Suite 3 (the larger professional graphics suite of which Photoshop is a
member.) Adobe is not abandoning Photoshop Elements, however. It is
also worth noting that, because Photoshop Elements is very inexpensive,
Adobe does not provide an upgrade path. When a new major release is
available one buys it at retail and dumps the old version (or gives it
away, which is perfectly legal since it hasn't been used as the basis
for an upgrade.)

For someone interested in going for the high end (as opposed to
Photoshop Elements or one of the off-brand editors) I would advise
waiting to see what Photoshop CS3 has to offer. Adobe will webcast the
official launch of Creative Suite 3 from New York City on 27 March.

I got around this, and the fact that the Gimp only does
8 bits per colour (to be rectified soon), by writing some
custom stacking software of my own. Once I've got
something reasonably close I can then scale it to 8 bits
and do the final tweaks in the Gimp.

Running under Linux is a strength, not a weakness.
But that's another flame war. :-)

That sounds like a work around for the lack of 16-bit support, but how
does it help with the lack of adjustment layers? I would find it very
difficult to process without them.

I've been running the beta for a while, and for the most part it's an
evolutionary upgrade, like CS to CS2. The one feature that I find very
nice is the incorporation of filters into adjustment layers (that is,
the ability to apply filters without affecting the original data, as you
already could with curves, levels, color corrections, etc).

I use Photoshop + FITS Liberator for nearly all of my technical
processing these days, using Maxim only for calibration, plate solving,
and occasional deconvolution.
