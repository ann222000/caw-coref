I'm noticing more and more the number of acts who don't seem to know
what a &quot;short song&quot; is.  When I'm running something to a timetable and
the act says &quot;how many more?&quot; with three minutes left before the end
of their alloted time, I usually say &quot;time for one but short&quot;.  I'm
amazed at how many times this can then be followed by a quick re-tune
of the guitar, the story behind the song, then a five verse ballad
clocking in at 4 minutes or more. Am I not being clear enough?  Next
time I get asked, should I say - &quot;you have precisely 3 minutes and ten
seconds to introduce, play and get off&quot;?

At an open mike session, people sign up for 15 minute spots - and yet
some clearly didn't understand that four four-minute songs with intros
and applause don't fit into 15 minutes, never mind the setting up time
(adjusting mikes, finding capos, tuning, etc.).

Fair dos to some.  Rory McLeod played our club recently and the
evening finished perilously close to our cut-off time - when someone
pointed out he hadn't played his trombone.  I told him he had 30
seconds to give us something on the trombone - and he did exactly that!

Yep. I remember timing an act's songs. Bang on an average of four
minutes for intro and song. &quot;Two more&quot; says I, noting that there was,
well, /nearly/ enough time left. Cue five minute introduction........

.....my fault. I suppose. Mumble, grumble....

We have different understandings of &quot;short&quot;. I only sing one song
shorter than 5 minutes and I'm not really inclined to go and learn
any :)

When a compere tells me, &quot;I'll give you the signal for one/two
more&quot;, my response is, &quot;No, just tell me what time you want me to
come off&quot; - and I make sure I'm off at the time specified,
particularly at festivals when there's someone else coming on
after me. Being able to balance material to the correct length of
a set is part of what I'm being paid for, after all.

When people start talking and gesticulating at me from the side of
the stage, I tend to think they're trying to tell me I've left my
fly unzipped.

Yes. Say. 'You have three minutes.' That will galvanise them. One song -
even one short song - is not so specific.

Oh lord! Yes, at festivals you can get all sorts of mixed signals if you
don't understand the stage manager's particular brand of semaphore. The
very first time we played Sidmouth we did a Radway cinema concert with
Roger Watson MCing. he warned us that time was short and not to overrun
and that he'd give us a five minute warning from the wings by giving us
the splayed hand... but we knew what time we were due to come off
anyway, so we were getting ready for the last song and looked into the
wings for Roger and 'the hand'... Nothing. So we did another song - not
the finisher and looked again... Nothing. Did another song and looked
over... Nothing.

By now the set was starting to get a bit ragged because we were making
it up as we went along without being able to have a confab. At last
Roger was there with the 'five' sign. We sang Mary Ellen Carter and
buggered off stage as fast as was decent.

It turned out they'd lost the act that was to follow us. No one had told
him about the stage door and he was sitting in the front row waiting to
climb up the front stage steps while they were looking everywhere but
the front row for him.

Semaphore certainly didn't communicate what was going on.

We plan for 5 minutes per item and it always seems to work perfectly.
We also arrange for the last-but-one in a set to de disposable so if we
get an early &quot;one more&quot; signal we can skip that one and always finish
with the planned grand finale.

I'd like to be able to do it by watching the clock, but I can't trust
myself to remember to do that. Also it doesn't look good on stage to
keep looking at your watch :-)

I'd have thought good timing was an obvious part of professionalism and
vice versa and can't understand why anyone would want to overrun. Given
the choice: (a) Leave them wanting more or (b) look amateurish and out
of control - it's a no-brainer!

I used of those large faced fob watches with a clip, and our set list
was written in a spiral bound notebook, so I used to clip the watch to
the notebook and have it on the floor at my feet. Much less obvious than
continually looking at your left wrist.

Before that, Hilary used to have one of those mega-faced wristwatches,
so all I had to do was glance at her left wrist. Again much less
obvious.

I could read both timepieces without my glasses!

I remember reading of a Victorian performer - I _think_ it may have been
Scott Skinner, but I wouldn't swear to it - had a routine that involved
somersaults, and charged £8 to perform it; or £10 in a kilt.

Or did I somehow invent the whole thing, I haven't a clue where I read it ?
I do hope not.

At our local music festival, we usually arrange with the performers
beforehand that we will give them a five minute signal.  At the small
stage that I manage, it's quite easy to give a quiet word from the
wings.  Even better, the sound man I work with will usually give a quiet
word through the monitors.  It has been suggested that placing an
agreed- upon object (eg.coffee cup) where the performers can see it is
another option.  Again, this is all much easier at  small stage.
(How about this for large stages:  A morris dance team wends its way
along the front of the stage holding up banners which proclaim &quot;Five
Minutes!&quot;  No - too subtle)
As for the earlier discussion about giving performers at a folk club
a specific length of time for their set, we have found, at an small
annual event here, that that didn't work very well for all the
aforementioned reasons so we tell everyone that they get to do three
songs.  this seems to work pretty well, the only trouble being that
there is always someone to whom you wish you could give more time. (this

I remember a singers' night at our club where most people had been
getting two todo when their turn came around, but towards the end of
the night it was obvious not everyone was going to get on that way, so
we asked the later turns to just do the one and then we'd see if there
was any time left.  Fine.  Until one guy's &quot;one&quot; was a medley with an
extended guitar improvisation that I clocked in at just under 11
minutes.  Whatever rules you have and however fair you try to play,

Hi

Ahh, memories!!!  When I were a lad back in the 60's and - when not
attending folk clubs - used to frequent pubs with local live rock
groups.  In those days last orders was 10:30 and ten minutes drinking
up time was very strictly observed in many pubs.  I remember we used
to regularly bribe the drummer of one rock group to start a drum solo
at 10:35 and see how long he could keep going.  I think his record was
well over half an hour before the landlord lost his cool!!!

Regards
KGB
