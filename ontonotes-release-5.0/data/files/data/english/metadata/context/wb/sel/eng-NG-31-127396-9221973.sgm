*We strongly condemn emergency in Pakistan and new PCO*

We have just seen the reports that emergency has been imposed in Pakistan, a
new Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) has been issued and security
forces have entered the Supreme Court of Pakistan. It is also reported that
curbs have been imposed on media and SCBA president Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan
has been arrested.

We strongly condemn declaration of emergency and issuance of a new PCO. It
is an illegal and unconstitutional decision and an attempt by a dismissed
general to continue his illegal and unconstitutional rule. The action should
be universally condemned and the generals in Pakistan should be forced to
end their stranglehold on the country.

We pay our compliments to a larger bench of the Supreme Court that has taken
up the issue and has declared the PCO and the imposition of emergency
illegal and unconstitutional. According to the initial reports the Chief
Justice Mr. Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry presided over the bench and
it included among others Mr. Justice Bhagwandas, Mr. Justice Jawed Iqbal,
Mr. Justice Shakirullah Jan, Mr. Justice Ghulam Rabbani and Mr. Justice
Nasirul Malik.

The court has declared that no judge of the Supreme Court or any of the high
courts including the chief justices would take oath under new PCO. It has
also stopped all government officials to take any action under the
emergerncy or PCO.

We think the country is being held hostage by a one-man dictatorship that
will destroy the country. Such steps are against the will of the people and
the law of the land and should be resisted on any and all the forums.

Aziz Narejo
President, SANA
(Sindhi Association of North America)

Note: This statement is issued within an hour of the government action and
it is based on the initial reports.

Judges ruling on general faced sex blackmail  Ghulam Hasnain, Islamabad
SOME of Pakistan's Supreme Court judges and their children were secretly
filmed in compromising positions with lovers and prostitutes as part of a
dirty tricks campaign by the country's feared military intelligence.
Videos were sent out to at least three of the 11 judges in September as they
were deciding whether General Pervez Musharraf was eligible to run for
president while still army chief. One showed a judge with his young mistress
while another was of a judge's daughter having sex with a boyfriend.
&quot;The message was clear,&quot; said a British barrister who was told about the
tapes by a Pakistani counterpart. &quot;If you rule the wrong way, these will
become public and your family destroyed.&quot;
The judges then gave an ambiguous ruling, allowing Musharraf to be elected
but declaring that they would decide on his eligibility later.
It was a fear that this ruling, due last week, would go against him that led
Musharraf to declare the state of emergency that has plunged the country
into crisis.
Although Musharraf claimed he had acted to prevent extremists taking over
the country, the judiciary appears to have been his principal target.
No jihadi leaders have been arrested but he sacked Iftikhar Muhammad
Chaudhry, the chief justice, and eight of the 11 Supreme Court judges and
scrapped the constitution.
Since declaring the state of emergency last weekend, Musharraf has placed
most of the country's top judges and human rights activists under house
arrest. Lawyers have so far led most of the protest rallies and hundreds
have been arrested. The sacked judges have been replaced by others who swore
an oath of allegiance to Musharraf.
According to western diplomats, it was Musharraf's intelligence chiefs who
talked him into the desperate measure by convincing him that the Supreme
Court was about to overturn his reelection as president. But it might have
been false information.
Rana Bhagwandas, a Supreme Court justice who is under house arrest in the
judges' colony in Islamabad, said his colleagues had not reached a verdict.
Others claim the judges were poised to confirm Musharraf's election by a
narrow margin, fearing the instability that would be created by a ruling
against him. One retired general said he had been told that the judges were
6-5 in favour of upholding Musharraf's reelection.
The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) service has been reeling from Supreme
Court rulings this year which have exposed illegal operations such as the
kidnapping of Baloch nationalists and the detention and torture of terrorist
suspects in secret jails.
According to government and Supreme Court sources, hidden cameras continued
to be used to compile compromising evidence against judges until a few weeks
before the emergency was declared.
The family of a woman who was having an affair with a Supreme Court judge
said they were devastated to learn that her trysts had been filmed.
According to judicial sources, several judges had been receiving visits from
prostitutes as &quot;payment in kind&quot; from private clients to whom they had given
legal advice. &quot;The ISI was sending the girls and the judges were enjoying it
without knowing they were being filmed. Now they have videos of several
judges,&quot; one court source said last week.
The chief justice himself was the subject of a separate ISI smear campaign
during the government's attempt to have him dismissed in March. Among the
affidavits claiming he had used his influence to help his son get a plum
government job was an anonymous letter which implied a sexual impropriety.
The letter was denounced as &quot;scandalous&quot; by the judges shortly before
Musharraf was forced to climb down and reinstate Chaudhry in July.
A military source who was privy to the dirty tricks campaign said it had
failed. &quot;They tried their best to blackmail the judges, but when the
judiciary got public support, it was like getting new oxygen,&quot; he said.
A western diplomat said intelligence officials had visited judges as they
deliberated on Musharraf's case.
&quot;They met judges and put pressure on them. They claim they knew the decision
was going to go against the president, but I've serious doubts about their
intelligence work. They convinced him of something that wasn't true.&quot;

this is probably a stunt to defame judges... they have sent to press so ppl
would read it and would think it is true. this is weird. if thereis anyone
who is involved in such acts is pres dear himself and everysecond person
knows that

reefs, leeds, uk

Now a days no one can differenciate between true or false. what Ghulam
Hasnain has reported have 0% importance if he does not present the proof on
the table to back his claims.

I think to get noticed these are shortcuts which are very frequently used.

It might be true also but Without any evidence it is a piece of junk.

I don't complain about the campaign, some of the western media is carrying
on, to deform the reality that is going on in Pakistan. Niether do I
complain about the UK and American (democratically elected) leaders backing
up a dictator for the people of Pakistan. This is what i expect from u.
You do the worst with us. Impose the corrupt leaders on us in the name of
democracy and if we get some heros, you come up with all the filth u have in
ur hearts, for them.
DETAINED JUSTUICES ARE MY HEROES.

there is any truth in this report why only judges? we should think about it

what a shame ful act why they dont expose all black sheeps of society if

Obaid Razzak Khan, mardan, Pukthone khwa Pakistan

its shamful act on part agencies why they dont expose all black sheep of
society if it is presume as to be why only judges we should think about it
in a realistic way which create doubts and one sided ness on part of
agencies.

Obaid Razzak Khan, mardan, Pukthone khwa Pakistan

This article could be right. The reason is that people in power has not
legal points to defame them. If General has any strong points to attack
judiciary than he must have told in his News Conference. How funny is that
he was saying that Chief Justice has claimed wrong medical and petrol
bills........Chief Justice of Pakistan.......This could show the frustration
of General and proves that he can do anything for his power like mentioned
above. May Allah bless our Country and outstanding Nation of Pakistan.

Hafeez Ur Rehman, Islamabad, CP

This is not the matter of the personal vendata but the drive to make the
judiciary as an independent institution and this should be done in any way.
Appreciate the ongoing efforts and initiate by the Iftikhar chaudry and
other lawers to make this possible. We are with them with fully support so
that Govt. also be accountable infront of the masses.

i agree with the views submitted by Miss Maham USA

Salman , karachi, pakistan

If the article above is stating a fact then in my opinion the judge was
guilty of something immoral. But how can somebody's extramarital affair be
more dangerous for the well being of Pakistan than passing an
illegal/unjudicial ruling? In my eyes the unfair ruling in favor Musharraf
is a bigger crime than sleeping around. As for our &quot;enlightened&quot; leadership
and its &quot;moderate&quot; policies, I am speechless.

Maham, US, US

the problem is not of the faces but the system as a whole is creating
mischief. whoever, come to the position of ruling become corrupt, try to
secure his seat and fill his pockets, either Musharraf, Nawaz or Benazir.

the root problem is SYSTEM and we must identify the root cause. Islamic
System will resolve each and every solution of mankind here in this world
and hereafter.

Junaid, Islamabad,

the judges who have supported a general unconstitutionaly wheather they go
to prostitues or not are all corrupts

Awais, islamabad,

How Ghulam Hasnain got all this information and sold it to his masters in
the west. If this info is correct then judges sacked by Mush do not deserve
to sit in the court and provide justice as they are not only incompetent but
also lack the behaviours / Eklakh to be on the bench...

Sohai Akram, dublin, ireland

I think it is time now , the UK govt should show us all that it likes
democracy and human rights in Pakistan and should support the people.
Unfortunately I doubt that US or UK would do this as history tells us that
they always support the dictators in the muslim world for their petty
interests. I a Pakistani and for me Musharaf is no more than a tin pot
dictator and God willing people of Pakistan will get rid of him. The west
has to decide are they with the people or with the dictator

Dr Basharat sahi, Aberystwyth, UK

i dont believe this!!no sane person would stoop so low man!! this is just
preposterous!

saima tariq, Lahore, Pakistan

This is very very cheap on the part of president of pakistan.
It is very sad to know the morality of the judiciary at the highest level at
the top,the president,the military to stoop to such a low level.
The people of a country such as pakistan should not remain silent ,but raise
its voice to the tyranny of a dictator .It will speak of the personality and
depth of the society of modern pakistani state.
Let the almighty give courage and strength to the people of pakistan to rise
up from this tight spot.
