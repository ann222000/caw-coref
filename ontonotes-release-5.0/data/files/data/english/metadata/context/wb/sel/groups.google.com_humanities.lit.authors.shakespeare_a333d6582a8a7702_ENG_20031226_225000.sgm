Weir's response to my illumination of the historical context surrounding
Bacon's totally groveling letters to Southampton and the 18th Earl of Oxford as
copies of the First Folio were being distributed for sale in London book stores
in January 1624 is lame, feckless, utterly pathetic.

My original argument that this highly revealing conjunction of these men
and events and Bacon's total silence at this particular moment about his
literary stature in private letters and their non-cooperative attitude toward
him wipes him out totally as a credible alternative Bard stands unrefuted.
Bard was a big ass-kisser to boot with King James and Buckingham when those
behind the First Folio project were appalled with their aln for the Spanish
Marriage. Weir is ignorant of too much basic history to be taken seriously.

The Oxford/Derby duo is the truth behind the Shakespeare pen name as many
suspected in the 1920s. Proving it is the truth is difficult but now possible
with the evidence in my hand...which of course is a factor in my contempt for
the Baconian theory which has had many other shortcomings. It clearly was on
the wane in the years just before...yes before World War I. Weir is living in
the Edwardian era which is about the last time the Baconian theory had any
significant or enthusiastic following. I suppose now with the Stratford man
finally exposed for what he was...a cradle-to-grave secret Roman
Catholic...that alone is enough to prompt a few to give Bacon a second look.
But it is all rubbish and a total waste of time. I trust that the Shakespeare
enthusiast from Bulgaria who asked about the history of the authorship debate
understands all this now.

"/>

What 'conjuncture?' Bacon wanted back in the House of Lords.
Southampton wanted a civil war between the Puritans (Parliament)
and the Anglicans (Royalists) because the Catholic minority--a
rapidly shirinking minority in England thanks to the mass
coversions of the 'Protestant upswelling' between 1600 and 1642--
would benefit from the same disestablishmentarianism that Essex
represented. .

The Protestants were hard core on doctrine but as presbyterians
were more than willing to co-exist with Catholics in a sectarian
England.
Bacon was an Anglican but worse from Southampton's point of view,
a voice of mediation.

Bacon had the power to sway Parliament. As Jonson pointed out,
Bacon was the 'greatest in many ages,' equal to or greater than
the ancient orators including Cicero and Pericles. Bacon had the
power to change history. How can you compare a lightweight like
Southampton to Francis Bacon? Here's a quote from a law school
dean on an article I'm going to post:: 'It seems almost unreasonable
that
Francis Bacon not only founded the scientific method but directed the
course of modern law. . . &quot; Bacon's Merchant of Venice
was not mere entertainment and the towering speeches of the
Shakespeare plays were first heard in Parliament.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; literary stature in private letters

"/>

Southampton had no 'literary status'

And incidently, proof of his radical Catholicism is in the fact
that during the SAME WEEK he was released from the Tower
the authorities raided Southampton House and sure enough,
found hundreds of banned Catholic books which they carried
outside and burned in the street.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and their non-cooperative attitude toward
&gt; him wipes him out totally as a credible alternative Bard stands unrefuted.
&gt; Bard was a big ass-kisser to boot with King James and

"/>

Do you know anything about James I? He was not a 'scholar
king.' He was a neurotic moron who didn't even care to rule
Britain. He ran up horrendous debts to buy estates for the
members of his homosexual coteries. Southampton was showered
with favors--James paid off his huge debts, gave Southampton
an enormous lump of cash--something like 75 k iirc, and
purchased back all Southampton's estates. Philip Herbert, Earl of
Montgomery got enormous gifts of cash from James until Herbert
was badly scarred by small pox and then the cash was cut off.
All of this mindless extravagance was paid for by the English people.
Bacon's troubles started when he opened a session of Parliament
with an oration against monopolies. James I's favorites were
living riotously on the monopolies while the English paid high
prices for everything.

By 1620 the English people, who were so thrilled to have the
succession crisis resolved by his accession, loathed and
despised the king. James I was the most unpopular monarch
in British history.
Queen Anne was de facto sovereign who ruled through the Privy
Council--James went 'camping with the darling boys' for a full
six months of the year while Queen Anne and Bacon--he was a
member of HER circle, not James'--attended Privy Council meetings
and took care of the public's business. James was simply pathetic.
And he demanded constant extravagant flattery. England has
never had such a fool on the throne.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; behind the First Folio project were appalled with their aln for the Spanish
&gt; Marriage.

"/>

Nobody knows who was 'behind the First Folio project.'
There is zero scholarship on this question outside of
the Strat flat acceptance that 'the printers did it.'

And what, conceivably, does the First Folio have with the
Spanish Marriage?

Bacon has a connection to the Spanish Marriage in that
his close friend Sir Tobie Matthew was sent to Madrid to work
on the negotiations but Bacon was certainly smart enough to
see where that was going.

The Stuarts, with all their rumors of illegitimacy and regicide and
kidnapping and rape and James' father Darnley lying strangled in the
garden--Bothwell's murder trial was a complete farce--the whole
chaotic, scandalous mess of the Stuart line--were SIMPLY NOT GOOD
ENOUGH FOR THE HAPSBURGS. The Spanish Marriage was never going
to happen even before it started. The question of succession was
overwhelming because Elizabeth was a heretic and a heretic had
named James I king (if she even did). James I was not a legitimate
heir because Bothwell was his father and everybody knew it--they
looked like twins--and there was no way that the scruffy Stuarts were
going to snag a Hapsburg princess. The Hapsburg line was at least 800
years while the Stuarts were nouveau royalty from a line only a few
generations old.
And what was Denmark's royalty? And worse of all, James was the
prettiest one in the family. Anne looked 'like a man' according to
accounts and Charles had a personality as disagreeable as his
father's. England was horribly in debt and rich Spain knew that
James only wanted the Infanta's dowry and would go through it
in a nonce.

The Catholic Marriage was a loss cause before the negotiations
even started and the First Folio is irrelevant to the Spanish
Marriage n any event.

No textbooks for us, we got only primary documents, consequently
I see that Oxfordianism is incomplete because Looney did not
access Oxford's primary documents. Baconians, on the other hand

that the Folger is sitting on a huge collection of Bacon's annotated
books and manuscript notebooks and has been very quiet about it
for the last eighty years--nothing has ever been catalogued) the
Baconians have 15 volumes of Bacon's letters and papers in
Spedding's monumental work. Oxfordians have nothing even slightly
comparable to Spedding and of course the Strats have a small
fist full of documents that have absolutely no bearing on the
Shakespeare works.

The truth has an inverse relation to popularity. Do you actually
believe that Strats--who have had hundreds of millions if not billions
of 'believers'--have the right author? There are more Oxfordians
than Baconians because Baconian theory requires a lot of time
to comprehend. Its difficult in the same sense that Renaissance
philosophy is difficult or the Shakespeare works are difficult or
the scope of Bacon's polymath genius is more than one biographer
--even Spedding--can convey.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I suppose now with the Stratford man

I've done some original thinking on this and while I don't
expect to get credit for the insight that John Shakespeare
held his sons out of the Anglican schools to thwart the
Anglican authorities as the Irish did in Ireland, I think that's
a very plausible theory.

I also have several posts to write on further Longworth evidence--
although she was a passionate bardoloator, Longworth was
also highly ethical and felt that all the Stratford documents should
come out, even the ones that the Strat establishment was trying
to suppress. The Strats actually withheld documents from Longworth,
a doctor of philosophy at the Sorbonne.

Longworth came up with a Catholic theory to explain that
most dangerous of Strat documents--the warrant against bodily harm
sworn out against the actor, his partner in the Swan and two women.
Longworth found the warrant connects those four to Sir Thomas Lucy,
the scourge of Catholics in Warwickshire through Lucy's nephew
who swore out the warrant. In other words Shakspere et al were
attempting to kill Lucy's nephew. Hotson discovered the original
docuent in the Bankside but Longworth extended the research.
And yes, this is even more in regard to the Catholic question.

This warrant may be connected to another theory I have--
based on circumstantial evidence--that Will fled the military
draft. There was an actual draft going on to raise an army
against the Armada and I found out that Sir Thomas Lucy had the
power to concript into the army as punishment for petty crimes.
I'm willing to bet that the anti-Catholic fanatic Lucy attempted to
conscript the Catholic lad into the army against Spain which would
have caused Will to violate the Pius V Bull forbidding English
Catholics
to defend the Queen in time of war (Oxford's problem at Tilbury).
Will didn't want to be under ...

&gt;&gt; The Protestants were hard core on doctrine but as presbyterians
&gt;&gt; were more than willing to co-exist with Catholics in a sectarian
&gt;&gt; England.
&gt;&gt; Bacon was an Anglican but worse from Southampton's point of view,
&gt;&gt; a voice of mediation.

&gt;&gt; Bacon had the power to sway Parliament. As Jonson pointed out,
&gt;&gt; Bacon was the 'greatest in many ages,' equal to or greater than
&gt;&gt; the ancient orators including Cicero and Pericles. Bacon had the
&gt;&gt; power to change history. How can you compare a lightweight like
&gt;&gt; Southampton to Francis Bacon? Here's a quote from a law school
&gt;&gt; dean on an article I'm going to post:: 'It seems almost unreasonable
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; Francis Bacon not only founded the scientific method but directed the
&gt;&gt; course of modern law. . . &quot; Bacon's Merchant of Venice
&gt;&gt; was not mere entertainment and the towering speeches of the
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare plays were first heard in Parliament.

&gt;&quot;O, that this too too solid flesh would melt...&quot; -- in Parliament?!

&gt;&gt; And incidently, proof of his radical Catholicism is in the fact

&gt;&gt; outside and burned in the street.

I would like to experience something, Webb. I'd like to

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; who didn't even care to rule
&gt;&gt; Britain. He ran up horrendous debts to buy estates for the
&gt;&gt; members of his homosexual coteries. Southampton was showered
&gt;&gt; with favors--James paid off his huge debts, gave Southampton
&gt;&gt; an enormous lump of cash--something like 75 k iirc, and
&gt;&gt; purchased back all Southampton's estates. Philip Herbert, Earl of
&gt;&gt; Montgomery got enormous gifts of cash from James until Herbert
&gt;&gt; was badly scarred by small pox and then the cash was cut off.
&gt;&gt; All of this mindless extravagance was paid for by the English people.
&gt;&gt; Bacon's troubles started when he opened a session of Parliament
&gt;&gt; with an oration against monopolies. James I's favorites were
&gt;&gt; living riotously on the monopolies while the English paid high
&gt;&gt; prices for everything.

&gt;&gt; By 1620 the English people, who were so thrilled to have the
&gt;&gt; succession crisis resolved by his accession, loathed and
&gt;&gt; despised the king. James I was the most unpopular monarch
&gt;&gt; in British history.

&gt; Source? Evidently Elizabeth has never heard of King John.

"/>

British history. I'm sure that there were many uncouth
kings like James I before James I. He did know Latin but he
couldn't think in any language.

Strats don't put any scholarship into James I because it's
difficult to explain how a tradesman in Stratford was trying
to drive cottagers off their ancient tithe-holdings in 1612 at
the same time he was writing Lear which shows pity for
the homeless and starving.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Queen Anne was de facto sovereign who ruled through the Privy
&gt;&gt; Council--James went 'camping with the darling boys' for a full
&gt;&gt; six months of the year while Queen Anne and Bacon--he was a
&gt;&gt; member of HER circle, not James'--attended Privy Council meetings
&gt;&gt; and took care of the public's business. James was simply pathetic.
&gt;&gt; And he demanded constant extravagant flattery. England has
&gt;&gt; never had such a fool on the throne.

&gt;&gt;&gt; behind the First Folio project were appalled with their aln for the Spanish
&gt;&gt;&gt; Marriage.

&gt;&gt; Nobody knows who was 'behind the First Folio project.'
&gt;&gt; There is zero scholarship on this question outside of
&gt;&gt; the Strat flat acceptance that 'the printers did it.'

&gt; Elizabeth just keeps the comedy coming!

"/>

I am stating the facts. There is no theory in Stratfordianism
to explain the First Folio. Clara Garber, a 1930s scholar who
wrote a study on Elizabethan dedications said that she couldn't
deal with the First Folio front matter because it was too problematic.
Hemminges and Condell dedicate the FF to Pembroke and
Mongomery AND the public violating every rule of the rhetoric
of rank in dedications. Jonson had a lot of confidence in his patron,
apparently. And there's a clue that Strats never bring forth.
Jonson was given a generous annual pension by Pembroke who
was his fond patron and here we find Jonson dedicating the works
of another poet to his, Jonson's, patron. No wonder Garber didn't
want to deal with it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And what, conceivably, does the First Folio have with the
&gt;&gt; Spanish Marriage?

&gt;&gt; Bacon has a connection to the Spanish Marriage in that
&gt;&gt; his close friend Sir Tobie Matthew was sent to Madrid to work
&gt;&gt; on the negotiations but Bacon was certainly smart enough to
&gt;&gt; see where that was going.

&gt;&gt; The Stuarts, with all their rumors of illegitimacy and regicide and
&gt;&gt; kidnapping and rape and James' father Darnley lying strangled in the
&gt;&gt; garden--Bothwell's murder trial was a complete farce--the whole

&gt;&gt; ENOUGH FOR THE HAPSBURGS. The Spanish Marriage was never going
&gt;&gt; to happen even before it started. The question of succession was
&gt;&gt; overwhelming because Elizabeth was a heretic and a heretic had
&gt;&gt; named James I king (if she even did). James I was not a legitimate

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Weir's response to my illumination

&gt;&gt;&gt; What 'illumination?' We've seen that post numerous times and
&gt;&gt;&gt; you have yet to show how it is

&gt;&gt;&gt; EVIDENCE

&gt;&gt;&gt; that Bacon did not write the Shakespeare works.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why don't you just list the reasons why the 'groveling'
&gt;&gt;&gt; (show me a letter to an earl that isn't 'groveling)
&gt;&gt; With pleasure. See the letter (quoted in Ogburn, as I recall) to the
&gt;&gt; Earl of Oxford from the lowly Thomas Vavasor. Whatever the letter may
&gt;&gt; be, it is certainly not &quot;groveling.&quot;
&gt; Most 'if I ever get my hands on you I will kill you' letters
&gt; supercede rank.

You asked me to show you a letter to an Earl that was not not
&quot;groveling,&quot; and I did so. What more do you want?

If civility is a classical virtue, then why do you so consistently

PWDBard's bizarre belief that an inanimate piece of real estate

consider Richard Butler's former Aryan Nations compound in Hayden

property was a gathering place for neo-Nazis and other racist hate
groups, complete with a guard tower and barracks, armed guards, a
sprawling commissary with a huge swastika painted on the roof, an
on-site church that glorified Hitler, etc. Now in the possession of
new owners, the property has been converted into a peace park

This one is, if possible, even more bizarre, because those are her
*own words* that Elizabeth has quoted above! I merely quoted them in my
post. See the post for yourself at

&lt;&gt;.

The supposed quotation &quot;under the influence of Aryan Supremacists&quot; that
appears in her remarks is wholly fabricated by Elizabeth -- I did not
write it, as you can readily check for yourself by pasting the quotation
into the &quot;exact phrase&quot; box of the Google Groups search page

&lt;&gt;;

as you will see, there are nine hits; of those, a plurality (four) are
authored by Elizabeth herself, while all the others merely quote posts
of Elizabeth in which the phrase is used. Elizabeth herself is the
source of the &quot;quotation&quot; -- but we have seen before, on many occasions,
that Elizabeth fabricates quotations at will. Perhaps the most amusing
instances are the posts in which she fabricates quotations concerning
Richard Field, ostensibly from Dave Kathman's essay on dating _The
Tempest_, an online essay in which Richard Field is *not even mentioned
anywhere*!

Of course, opining that Elizabeth was under the influence of Aryan
supremacists would be far short of calling her a Nazi, but I have not
even asserted the former, let alone the latter.

As for skinheads in Idaho, you can verify for yourself by means of
the aforementioned Google Groups search engine that there is not a
*SINGLE POST* to this newsgroup authored by *anyone* that contains both
the words &quot;skinheads&quot; and &quot;Idaho,&quot; other than the post of Elizabeth

Elizabeth had just opined that

This is farcically false, and I wrote in response:

&quot;One wonders where Elizabeth imbibes such claptrap. There are

&gt;&gt; Way Cool:

&gt; You are a relative newcomer so perhaps you have not observed the
&gt; phenomenon, but Elizabeth routinely distorts and misrepresents the words
&gt; of others, and her post above is no exception. Indeed, as we shall
&gt; below, Elizabeth is not even capable of using Google competently.

&gt;&gt; My understanding is that Joao Magueijo is Portugese, but perhaps his
&gt;&gt; PhD from Cambridge, St. John's fellowship, Royal Society Research
&gt;&gt; Fellowship, and tenure at Imperial College has altered his outlook.
&gt;&gt; However, his descriptions of the &quot;discussions&quot; between peers makes
&gt;&gt; these posts look like love letters, so I have cause to doubt. Thanks
&gt;&gt; for the warning. Can't wait to see Herr Webb's response.

&gt; I will discuss the work of João Magueijo further in another post.

"/>

I'm perfectly certain that YOU discussing his work with ME, is
functionally equivalent to explaining such things to the proverbial
monkey we were all introduced to in Physics 101, and against which I
performed only marginally better. I spent most of my time in calculus
muttering, &quot;I SHOULD be able to understand this stuff,&quot; but perhaps it
had something to do with the distractions provided by three children
and an absentee husband. Either way, my grasp of calculus was only
marginally sufficient to get me through one semester of international
economics. I enjoy Magueijo, Hawking, Martin Rees, Richard Preston,
Crossan, and other such persons because they place into perspective
all of the day-to-day petty squabbles that make up my law practice.
By way of comparison, what is going on here amounts to escapism,
rather like reading a good mystery novel. I merely enjoy my position
as the token &quot;interested but uninformed lay person&quot; to which K &amp; R's
essay was purported to be addressed.

As for your position on Blackfriars Gatehouse, I'd have to agree that

In fact, I am generally pretty cordial with posters who exhibit
accord their interlocutors the presumption of honesty and sincerity.
Regrettably, there are a very few people -- such as yourself -- who hurl

I'd like to clarify that my references to Einstein have nothing to do
with Christopher Jon Bjerknes and those who subscribe to his opinions.
It is my understanding that 1) Einstein is credited with synthesizing
several individual theories in math and physics into a coherent set of
formulae. 2) Any persons whose work may not have been credited in his
papers said as much at the time, and others recognized this or not.
3) any failure to credit does not undermine the originality of
Einstein's work. 4) We all stand on the shoulders of others.
Scientists don't and can't work in a vacuum. 5) Einstein continued
to struggle with the paradoxes in his own work throughout his life,
the sign of an honest scientist.

Actually, I had never heard of Mr. Bjerknes and his friends prior to
my attempt to sort through this thread and learn what all the fuss was
about.

My reference to Einstein and Magueijo falls into a different camp. He
and his companions challenged Einstein's concept that the speed of
light is constant, which more or less amounted to heresy, and they
were considered cranks at the time, but their work is gaining respect.
Magueijo has in turn made contributions to string theory and other
stuff that competes with VSL and seemingly contradict his own work,
also the sign of an honest scientist.

As to all of David's many quotes, which I have snipped, I note the
following:

David's directions pulled up error messages, so I did a google search,
which only made things more confusing, but it appears that David DID
NOT call Elizabeth a Nazi or an Aryan Supremacist, but rather said
that her belief in certain things (like Bjerknes' claims of
plagiarism) implies that she is as dumb as they are.

If Elizabeth called Einstein a plagiarist, then I personally would
give more credit to her opinion if I knew she came to her conclusion
after a thorough and independent investigation of the competing
arguments on the subject.

Since I'm neither a mathmetician, nor a physicist, I'm not competent
to form an opinion, because in order to comprehend whether the
argument had merit, I would first need to understand the theories that
were purported to have been plagiarized and to understand how they fit
into Einstein's own work, which means to have read and understood the
various papers. An example is the constant demand for &quot;sources&quot; and
&quot;documentary evidence&quot; in connection with the Shakespeare Authorship
question.

This is NOT to say I think Elizabeth's work in the Shakespeare
Authorship context is without merit

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, opining that Elizabeth was under the influence of Aryan

&gt; Either way, my grasp of calculus was only

Some fairly sophisticated mathematics is unfortunately required for
an understanding of general relativity; however, the good news is that
very *little* mathematics is required to understand the basic ideas of
special relativity, Einstein's beautiful and resoundingly successful
marriage of electrodynamics with (a modification of) the principle of
Galilean relativity enjoyed by classical Newtonian mechanics. I would
recommend _Spacetime Physics_ by Edwin Taylor and John Wheeler.
Although written by two distinguished scientists, it requires little
mathematical sophistication beyond high school algebra and a smattering
of single variable calculus; however, despite its welcome accessibility
and lucid exposition, it is nonetheless an honest, serious beginning
physics book rather than a watered-down popularization.

Briefly, Newtonian mechanics enjoys a remarkable symmetry (now called
Galilean relativity) that had long been recognized: there is a class of
reference frames (the _inertial frames_, those of an unaccelerated
observer) such that the equations of motion always take the same form in
any inertial frame. Thus, there is no &quot;God given&quot; reference frame of
absolute rest, and any inertial reference frame is as good as any other,
in the sense that Newton's second law holds in any. (Indeed, Newton's
second law contains second derivatives but not first derivatives, i.e.,
accelerations but *not* velocities. Thus a notion of &quot;absolute
velocity&quot; is not physically meaningful.)

However, with the discovery of Maxwell's equations (the equations
governing electrodynamics), the situation changed dramatically: the
Lorentz force law, the equation specifying the force experienced by a
charged particle in an electromagnetic field, *does* contain an explicit
velocity term -- but velocity relative to *which* reference frame? If
all inertial frames are equally good for expressing the laws of motion,
then how could there possibly be a velocity term in the equations of
motion? Thus, if one attempts to marry Maxwell's electrodynamics with
Newton's mechanics, one finds that the Galilean relativity principle is
violated: suddenly there *is* a preferred frame of absolute rest --
there must be, or the velocity term in the Lorentz force law would be
meaningless. Maxwell also observed that an easy consequence of his
equations was d'Alembert's familiar linear differential equation
governing propagation of waves. Thus, the equations of electrodynamics
*predicted* the propagation of electromagnetic waves at a velocity (now
denoted &quot;c&quot;) easily computed in terms of two constants easily measured
in desktop electrostatics and magnetostatics experiments (specifically,
the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability of free space).
When the predicted velocity c of electromagnetic wave propagation was
calculated, it turned out to be the velocity of light! The conclusion
was inescapable: light was merely the electromagnetic wave propagation
predicted by Maxwell's equations.

At the time, physicists familiar with water waves, waves on stretched
violin strings, etc. could scarcely imagine oscillatory waves unless
there was some medium doing the oscillating, so physicists suggested the
existence of a &quot;luminiferous ether&quot; that was supposed to be the medium
whose vibrations were the electromagnetic waves. It was irresistible to
identify the rest frame of the luminiferous ether with the &quot;absolute
rest frame&quot; relative to which the velocites showing up in the Lorentz
force law and in Maxwell's wave equation were to be measured. This
speculation was rather metaphysical, as there was absolutely *no*
experimental evidence whatever of the existence of the ether, and there
is none to this day (although some have coöpted the term to refer to the
quantum vacuum, a different matter altogether).

Maxwell's work was a stunning success, as it unified two apparently
disparate phenomena, electromagnetism and light. However, it was
disconcerting that the well-enshrined Galilean relativity principle was
violated, and that there apparently *was* an &quot;absolute rest frame.&quot;
(The situation would be rather like getting used to the fact that the
earth is not the stationary center of the medieval universe, only to
learn from the latest advances that in fact there *was* a preferred
&quot;absolute rest&quot; reference frame after all.)

Not surprisingly, attempts were made to measure the earth's motion
relative to the fixed absolute rest frame, beginning with the
beautifully ingenious interferometry experiment of Michelson and Morley
-- but none of these experiments detected the expected &quot;ether wind,&quot;
although they were easily sensitive enough to do so.

The situation was rather baffling, and many insightful attempts were
made to resolve it. Lorentz discovered a set of transformations of
coordinates -- *not* the Galilean transformations familiar from
Newtonian mechanics -- that left the form of Maxwell's equations
unaltered; however, Lorentz ascribed no physical significance to the
&quot;local time&quot; that arose in his transformations, his transformations were
incompatible with the changes of reference frame sanctioned by Newtonian
mechanics, and there was no ready explanation of *why* the Lorentz
transformations should preserve the form of the equations of
electrodynamics. Poincaré explicitly expressed the wish that the laws
of physics conform to some sort of relativity principle analogous to
Galilean relativity, but his attempt to couch the newly discovered
electrodynamic phenomena in dynamical terms (a new, special force that
deforms the intrinsically spherical and presumably elastic electron in
the direction of motion into an ellipsoid, etc.) was unsuccessful.

Einstein's brilliant insight was that a simple but fundamental
revision of *kinematics* -- *not* of dynamics, as in Poincaré's approach
-- sufficed to resolve the apparent conflict and thereby to unify (a
modification of) Newton's resoundingly successful mechanics with
Maxwell's no less resoundingly successful electrodynamics: there was
*no* absolute rest frame, and all inertial reference frames were
equivalent; in particular, there was no longer any need for an _ad hoc_
construct like the luminiferous ether, for whose existence there was not
the slightest experimental evidence in any case. Einstein's beautifully
simple insight explained Lorentz's _ad hoc_-looking transformations in a
very satisfying way. Also, unlike Poincaré's dynamical approach,
Einstein's revised kinematics governed the fabric of spacetime itself,
mot merely the dynamical equations of a particular theory. Thus
Einstein's special relativity should underlie at some level *all*
physical theories, an expectation that has been confirmed as new
interactions have been better understood by various quantum field
theories. Finally, the predictions of Einstein's theory have been
resoundingly confirmed in literally *thousands* of observations, from
astrophysics to elementary particle experiments -- this is emphatically
*not* the case for competing theories intended to explain the null
Michelson-Morley result, all of which are contradicted by experiment
(see Leo Sartori's book for a summary of some of these observations,
from the classical aberration of starlight to the observations of binary
stars systems).

For a more complete understanding of the background of special
relativity in the Lorentz symmetries of Maxwell's equations, the old
classic by Max Born still makes good reading; for this one must have a
little more mathematics (vector calculus is needed for Maxwell's
equations), but Taylor and Wheeler is readable with virtually no such
prerequisites, so I heartily recommend it as a starting point.

&gt; I'd like to clarify that my references to Einstein have nothing to do

"/>

I honestly have no idea whether Bjerknes's nonsense is the source of
some of Elizabeth's delusions or not; I was quite serious when I said
that one wonders where on earth Elizabeth imbibes such claptrap. She
demonstrably has not even read, let alone understood, the few putative
sources that she cites. I doubt that Bjerknes can be her sole source,
as he mostly confines himself to &quot;history&quot; and prudently avoids
discussing the underlying science for the most part, and what he does
discuss, he frequently gets wrong (not that his history is any more
reliable than his science).

Elizabeth, however, weighs in farcically with one mathematical and
physical misunderstanding after another. She declares that the geometry
of Minkowski space is hyperbolic. She declares that the luminiferous
aether is not discredited. She confuses special relativity (which she
does not understand) with general relativity (ditto). She does not like
relativity because, she informs us, it is &quot;dystopian,&quot; and she
*simultaneously*(!) argues that special relativity is wrong *and* that
Einstein &quot;plagerized [sic]&quot;&quot;equasions [sic]&quot; from Poincaré and Lorentz,
who deserve full credit for the discovery. (Why Elizabeth is so eager
to bestow full credit upon her anyone-but-Einstein alternatives for what
in her view is a failed theory she does not disclose; it seems plain
that she is actuated almost completely by a vitriolic animus toward
Einstein, an irrational animus whose source remains a mystery to me.)

Perhaps most unconscionable, though, was Elizabeth's pretense to have
read the work of J.-P. Hsu, and her grotesque fabrication of things that
Hsu never said. Here are a few representative Weir utterances on the
subject:

&quot;Prof. JP Hsu at UMass spent his entire professional career--
close to 40 years--'agonizing over whether the basic principles
of special relativity are correct' and found them wanting.&quot;

&quot;Einstein's STR never had a full minute of peer review except
for the editorial board at Annalen Der Physik which later
signaled its regret by reprinting Gerber's calculations for
the parahelion [sic] of Mercury which were supiciously [sic]
identical to Einstein's.&quot;

&quot;As far as Einstein is concerned, Webb can't answer to the fact
that his Dartmouth colleague

[sic! Elizabeth cannot distinguish U. Mass. Dartmouth, a branch campus
of the public U. Mass system located, as the name strongy suggests, in
Massachussets, from Dartmouth College, a private, Ivy League institution
in another state entirely]

physics Professor J.P. Hsu can throw out Einstein's
superflous Second Postulate and still have a complete working
relativity theory that is consistent with quantum physics

[sic! As Professor Hsu himself points out, his taiji relativity
INCLUDES Einstein's theory as a special case, so any incompatibility or
inconsistency in special relativity would perforce be present in taiji
relativity as well],

because, Laila, to admit to Lorenzian
relativity would prove that Einstein was a plagiarist. And a
pathological liar. And a fool because Hsu [and others] demonstrate
that Einstein's equations were not 'derived' from Einstein's
'thought experiments' but were swiped from physics journals
that landed on his desk at the Berne Patent Office

[sic!! Hsu says nothing of the kind; plainly, Elizabeth has not read
Hsu].

All of the various parts that Einstein plagiarized were in print
before Einstein mailed his paper to the Annalen der Physik and
Einstein would have seen all the papers while checking priority
on patents [sic!].&quot;

[Elizabeth's bizarre notion that patent applications tend to contain
ground-breaking advances in theoretical physics is one of the most
ludicrous I have ever encountered.]

says about the subject in an e-mail to me, which I reproduce here with

Professor Webb,

Thank you for letting me know about this situation. You are
absolutely correct in thinking that our work on Taiji Relativity is
not a repudiation of Einstein's work at all. As you know, abundant
experimental evidence exists showing the utility of special relativity
for predicting and explaining physical phenomena.

&quot;Taiji relativity&quot; is a formulation of special relativity which is
operationally equivalent to writing the Lorentz transformations using the
same units for length and time (as done by Taylor and Wheeler in
Spacetime Physics [an excellent book on special relativity]). However,
I also proposed a slightly different conceptual interpretation of
relativity (just as quantum mechanics has different conceptual
interpretations which are all operationally identical

[Note: Quantum theory is formulated in two main alternative but
equivalent ways: the &quot;Schrödinger picture,&quot; in which the Hermitian
operators representing observables are fixed but the state vectors
undergo unitary time evolution according to Schrödinger's equation, and
the &quot;Heisenberg picture,&quot; in which the state vectors are fixed but the
Hermitian operators undergo unitary time evolution. The two viewpoints
are completely equivalent logically, and picking which one to use is a
matter of convention, like deciding whether to measure distance in miles
or in furlongs. (In particular, declaring one viewpoint to be correct
and the other one wrong because it is &quot;dystopian&quot; would be as silly as
declaring furlongs to be the natural unit for measuring distance because
measurement in miles would be &quot;dystopian.&quot;) In the same way, taiji
relativity is operationally identical to special relativity.]

), and also tried to show how this different conceptual interpretation
could extend the utility of relativity (for example, it could simplify
calculations of relativistic many-particle systems, and could be used to
write down an invariant Planck's law for the blackbody radiation).*

More recently, my work has been focused on trying to extend the

Correct, but he did much more than that. For example, the paper
mentioned in his Nobel Prize citation (on the photoelectric effect) was
not in any sense a synthesis, but was profoundly original. While others
came close to developing special relativity, the general theory of
relativity (the extension of Einstein's successful marriage of mechanics
and electrodynamics that included gravitation as well) was almost
entirely Einstein's own creation.

What Elizabeth says about Lorentz and Poincaré having been dismayed
by Einstein's supposed plagiarism is completely false. I haven't a clue
where she got that factoid, but here is what Lorentz himself said about
Einstein's insight:

&quot;A transformation of the time was necessary. So I introduced the
conception of a local time which is different for all systems of
reference which are in motion relative to each other. But I never
thought that this had anything to do with real time. This real
time for me was still represented by the old classical notion of
an absolute time, which is independent of any reference to special
frames of coordinates. There existed for me only this one true
time. I considered my time transformation only as a heuristic
working hypothesis. So the theory of relativity is solely Einstein's
work. And there can be no doubt that he would have conceived it
even if the work of his predecessors in the field had not been done
at all. His work in this respect

In what sense was Poincare's theory unsuccessful? How can you speak of
inertial systems and kinematics in the same breath? The 1905 Einstein
paper was titled On the ElectroDYNAMICS of Moving BODIES, which is
dynamics, not kinematics. Einstein has a kinematical section, but he
did not understand the term, and he simply repeated Poincare's methods
of clock synchronization with light signals, which is a dynamic
process. The postulates are both dynamically based. What precisely do
you think is wrong with Bjerknes's work, David? Please be specific.
BTW, Poincare asserted the POR of relativity as a general principle

Why on earth not? Newton's first law, which *defines* the class of
inertial frames in Newtonian mechanics, is purely kinematic (dynamics
doesn't enter the picture until the second law), so inertial frames have
been mentioned in the same sentence as kinematics for quite a long time.

*Of course* the paper was so entitled -- because it was Maxwell's
theory of electrodynamics that violated the Galilean relativity formerly
enjoyed by all the known laws of physics. That curious phenomenon,
which seemed to mandate the existence of an absolute stationary
reference frame, was the conundrum that inspired the Michelson-Morley
experiment whose null outcome was so vexing. Nobody but Einstein
apparently had an inkling that a simple reformulation of kinematics
would neatly explain the otherwise _ad hoc_ Lorentz invariance of
Maxwell's equations and many other things besides. And I have no idea
why on earth you emphasized the word &quot;bodies&quot; -- a moving body is a
standard notion in particle kinematics, and dynamics does not enter the
picture until the *mass* of the moving body or until specific forces
acting upon the body are considered.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

What do you mean, he did not understand the term?! By definition,
kinematics is &quot;...that part of the study of motion that does not take
force and mass into account.&quot; (See Callahan's book _The geometry of
spacetime_. If you prefer the OED, kinematics is &quot;The science of pure
motion, considered without reference to the matter or objects moved, or
to the force producing or changing the motion.&quot;) In other words, it is
that part of the study of motion which is *universal*, independent of
any particular force of interaction or of the masses of the moving
bodies. Einstein's crucial insight is independent of force and mass,
hence perforce purely kinematic, and it pertains to situations in which
*any* force field is present, not merely the electromagnetic field. In
fact, Einstein's special relativistic kinematics underlies at present
*all* physical theories, from the theory of gravitation to quantum field
theories of elementary particles; indeed, that is why, for example,
David Griffiths's book on elementary particle physics contains a
foundational chapter entitled &quot;Relativistic kinematics.&quot; For a more
elementary account than Callahan's or Griffiths's, see the chapter
entitled &quot;The new kinematics&quot; in Pais's scientific biography of
Einstein. The classic book by Weidner and Sells on modern physics also
contains a foundational chapter entitled &quot;Relativistic kinematics: space
and time&quot; that explains Einstein's key reformulation of kinematics,
including consequences such as Lorentz invariance, the invariance of the
interval, so-called &quot;time dilation&quot; and &quot;length contraction,&quot; the twin
&quot;paradox,&quot; etc. See also chapter 2, &quot;Einsteinian kinematics,&quot; of
Wolfgang Rindler's _Essential relativity: special, general, and
cosmological_. This is *all* kinematics, not dynamics.

No, velocity is a purely kinematic notion. It is the time derivative
of position, and neither time nor position is a dynamical concept.

Poincaré's approach to the problem was dynamical, not kinematic.
Indeed, Poincaré was forced to postulate the existence of a &quot;special
force&quot; -- I reproduce his words from an earlier post (slightly edited):
---------------------------
&quot;Il faut donc a revenir à la theorie de Lorentz; mais si l'on veut
la conserver et éviter d'intolérables contradictions, il faut
supposer une force speciale qui explique à la foi

J'ai chercher à determiner cette force, j'ai trouvé qu'*elle peut
être assimilée à une pression extérieure constante, agissant sur
l'electron déformable et compressible, et dont le travail est
proportionnel aux variations du volume de cet électron*.&quot;

Note that Poincaré is talking about dynamics (a special force, etc.),
*not* about kinematics. Moreover, as far as is known to this day, the
electron is a point particle with no internal structure, so Poincaré's
notion of a deformable, compressible electron that experiences an
external force that effects the Lorentz contraction only along one of
its axes (that of its instantaneous velocity) does not correspond at all
to the structure of reality as it is presently understood.

Well, for one thing, Bjerknes does not, as far as I am aware, discuss
the admiration of Einstein that emerges from Pauli's correspondence;
rather, he misleadingly cites only a small part of what Pauli actually
wrote. (In that regard he is not unlike those anti-Stratfordians who,
from a lengthy passage expressing Dryden's almost boundless admiration
of Shakespeare, pluck out a single mildly critical utterance as evidence
of Dryden's supposed dislike of Shakespeare.) I could go on at some

of Einstein Studies at Boston University, at

&lt;&gt;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I have noted elsewhere that Poincaré explicitly stated the principle
of relativity, a very significant insight. And as a mathematician I am
a great admirer of Poincaré, whose work I regard as among the most
striking of both of the last two centuries, comparable only to that of a
few other Titans like Elie Cartan. Like Lorentz, Poincaré deserves full
credit for key insights that constitute a part of what eventually became
the special theory of relativity. However, much as I hate to bestow the
credit upon a physicist rather than a mathematician, it was Einstein's
brilliant insight that made it all beautifully simple and comprehensible
-- no more unphysical &quot;local times,&quot; no more &quot;special forces&quot; deforming
supposedly spherical elastic electrons into ellipsoids with shortened
axes in the direction of motion, no more _ad hoc_ and rather mysterious
coordinate transformations, no more unexplained and purely _ad hoc_
dynamical effects (molecular forces postulated to differ in a rod in
uniform motion from a rod at rest, etc.), no more loss of the beautiful
symmetry of Galilean relativity.

The fact that a small contingent of ignorant cranks seems hell-bent
upon denying credit to Einstein for one of the most beautifully simple
and original ideas in the history of science is a remarkable and to me
incomprehensible phenomenon. I could understand an honest attempt to
counter the deification of Einstein and to see him instead as a flawed
human being, as indeed most geniuses are, but these anti-hagiographers
have a much fuller agenda. They do not deny Newton the credit that he
deserves for his remarkable insights, despite the fact that Newton was a
pathologically vindictive man who, despite his unquestioned genius,
*did* commit acts of what would now be regarded as academic dishonesty,
purely out of malicious spite. True, many of Einstein's detractors are
unapologetic racists, and predictably enough, Bjerknes's book is highly
praised on the web sites of some orgzanizations identified as hate
groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center, but the anti-Einstein animus
seems to extend beyond ignorant racists and readers too obtuse to
perceive the racist agendas of the former. It remains a curious
phenomenon -- but it is strictly a sociological, not a scientific one;
Einstein's reputation is best gauged by actually reading the papers of
Einstein and his contemporaries, and among those who have done so and
who understand the science, Einstein's profound originality is
unimpeachable.

Newton's first law depends upon Newton's definition of absolute

dynamics?). See Ludwig Lange's Die geschichtliche Entwickelung des
Bewegungsbegriffes und ihr voraussichtliches Endergebniss. Ein Beitrag
zur historischen Kritik der mechanischen Principien von Ludwig Lange
(1886), and Das Inertialsystem vor dem Forum der Naturforschung
(1902). Einstein asserts a resting system in which the equations of
Newtonian MECHANICS hold good. Such a system cannot be defined without
the metaphysical notion of absolute space, or, more scientifically,
through dynamics.

How do you send light signals, how do you employ observers, how do you
employ clocks and measuring rods, without employing masses? In section
3, Einstein imparts relative velocity to his masses. How can this be
accomplished without the introduction of force, in inertial systems?
The clock synch idea was Poincare's, not Einstein's, and Einstein had
read Poincare's work.

&gt;&gt; Einstein has a kinematical section, but he

&gt; No, velocity is a purely kinematic notion. It is the time derivative

Light signals, observers, accelerometers, etc. are needed for this
misnamed kinematic process, or do you believe in absolute space, as

There is nothing misleading about Bjerknes's citations from Pauli. He

special theory of relativity before Einstein. That was his goal, and
he quoted Pauli at length.

&gt; review by John Stachel, a physicist and historian who directs the Center

&gt;&lt;http://physicsweb.org/article/review/16/4/2&gt;.

John Stachel had an axe to grind with Bjerknes. His &quot;review&quot; was
nothing of the kind, but was instead a bitter personal attack, which
completely avoided the facts. Stachel was also wrong about what Klein
wrote. Physics World refused to publish Bjerknes's response, which you
can read here:

Such a writer!

You account for precedents before a cohesive expression of them is achieved,
no? Before a field concept exists, most of its components are already in a
full array of anecdote?

It is the same in the literary world. The cohesive statement is nil
consuetudine majus.

I remember reading Koestler in Germany and wrestling with his issue of
intuition of planetary elliptical orbits by his own explanation, which
seemed false, (and of which he made a very long and poor mathematical proof,
qui uti scit el bona) proposing, I think, something acceptable to empirical
observation as a methodology, rather than whatever actual process had
occurred to him.

This is a difficult philosophic negotiation! Koestler had not arrived at his
conclusion from his proof, but offered a proof of his conclusion. What is
intercepted is method.

And what is absent in Newton as public statement, yet present in Einstein,
is method. Yet Newton (at least early in his life) could be considered the
more protean of the two, neh? Einstein was able to achieve the meta-theorem:
a brevi manu, dux gregis sans fons et origo.

These investigations also inform the arts, and are as rare! The very best
researchers of their age state that it is often some generations (!) later
that material is able to be digested - especially from the non-researching
teaching professions who are most conservative of all.

Excuse me for breaking into your subject, but it also illuminates this
question of high intuition compared to methodological proof, which is the
ever present background in discussions here of authorship of the Work.

&gt; of relativity, a very significant insight. And as a mathematician I am
&gt; a great admirer of Poincaré, whose work I regard as among the most
&gt; striking of both of the last two centuries, comparable only to that of a
&gt; few other Titans like Elie Cartan. Like Lorentz, Poincaré deserves full
&gt; credit for key insights that constitute a part of what eventually became
&gt; the special theory of relativity. However, much as I hate to bestow the
&gt; credit upon a physicist rather than a mathematician, it was Einstein's
&gt; brilliant insight that made it all beautifully simple and comprehensible
&gt; -- no more unphysical &quot;local times,&quot; no more &quot;special forces&quot; deforming
&gt; supposedly spherical elastic electrons into ellipsoids with shortened
&gt; axes in the direction of motion, no more _ad hoc_ and rather mysterious

&gt; dynamical effects (molecular forces postulated to differ in a rod in
&gt; uniform motion from a rod at rest, etc.), no more loss of the beautiful
&gt; symmetry of Galilean relativity.

&gt; The fact that a small contingent of ignorant cranks seems hell-bent

&gt; pathologically vindictive man who, despite his unquestioned genius,
&gt; *did* commit acts of what would now be regarded as academic dishonesty,

Webb. We've had this discussion before, perhaps you'll remember.
It was the day Stephanie dropped in and abruptly left.

I pointed out to you that women are not impressed by the bashing
of other women. Watching other women being abused is not a
turn on for women.

Men bond around the abuse of women--I cited studies on fraternity
members that will bond around rape or abuse of women--but women
will not bond around the abuse of women.

This obsessive behavior can't be healthy and I think it's time that
you stopped. Maybe you should buy a television.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Elizabeth, however, weighs in farcically with one mathematical and
&gt; physical misunderstanding after another. She declares that the geometry
&gt; of Minkowski space is hyperbolic. She declares that the luminiferous
&gt; aether is not discredited. She confuses special relativity (which she
&gt; does not understand) with general relativity (ditto). She does not like
&gt; relativity because, she informs us, it is &quot;dystopian,&quot; and she
&gt; *simultaneously*(!) argues that special relativity is wrong *and* that
&gt; Einstein &quot;plagerized [sic]&quot;&quot;equasions [sic]&quot; from Poincaré and Lorentz,
&gt; who deserve full credit for the discovery. (Why Elizabeth is so eager
&gt; to bestow full credit upon her anyone-but-Einstein alternatives for what
&gt; in her view is a failed theory she does not disclose; it seems plain
&gt; that she is actuated almost completely by a vitriolic animus toward
&gt; Einstein, an irrational animus whose source remains a mystery to me.)

&gt; Perhaps most unconscionable, though, was Elizabeth's pretense to have
&gt; read the work of J.-P. Hsu, and her grotesque fabrication of things that
&gt; Hsu never said. Here are a few representative Weir utterances on the
&gt; subject:

&gt;&quot;Prof. JP Hsu at UMass spent his entire professional career--
&gt; close to 40 years--'agonizing over whether the basic principles
&gt; of special relativity are correct' and found them wanting.&quot;

&gt;&quot;Einstein's STR never had a full minute of peer review except
&gt; for the editorial board at Annalen Der Physik which later
&gt; signaled its regret by reprinting Gerber's calculations for
&gt; the parahelion [sic] of Mercury which were supiciously [sic]
&gt; identical to Einstein's.&quot;

&gt;&quot;As far as Einstein is concerned, Webb can't answer to the fact
&gt; that his Dartmouth colleague

&gt; [sic! Elizabeth cannot distinguish U. Mass. Dartmouth, a branch campus
&gt; of the public U. Mass system located, as the name strongy suggests, in
&gt; Massachussets, from Dartmouth College, a private, Ivy League institution
&gt; in another state entirely]

&gt; physics Professor J.P. Hsu can throw out Einstein's
&gt; superflous Second Postulate and still have a complete working
&gt; relativity theory that is consistent with quantum physics

&gt; [sic! As Professor Hsu himself points out, his taiji relativity
&gt; INCLUDES Einstein's theory as a special case, so any incompatibility or
&gt; inconsistency in special relativity would perforce be present in taiji
&gt; relativity as well],

&gt; because, Laila, to admit to Lorenzian
&gt; relativity would prove that Einstein was a plagiarist. And a
&gt; pathological liar. And a fool because Hsu [and others] demonstrate
&gt; that Einstein's equations were not 'derived' from Einstein's
&gt; 'thought experiments' but were swiped from physics journals
&gt; that landed on his desk at the Berne Patent Office

&gt; [sic!! Hsu says nothing of the kind; plainly, Elizabeth has not read
&gt; Hsu].

&gt; All of the various parts that Einstein plagiarized were in print
&gt; before Einstein mailed his paper to the Annalen der Physik and
&gt; Einstein would have seen all the papers while checking priority
&gt; on patents [sic!].&quot;

&gt; [Elizabeth's bizarre notion that patent applications tend to contain
&gt; ground-breaking advances in theoretical physics is one of the most
&gt; ludicrous I have ever encountered.]

&gt; However, from an earlier post, here is what Professor Hsu himself
&gt; says about the subject in an e-mail to me, which I reproduce here with
&gt; his kind permission; my explanatory comments are in square brackets:

&gt; Professor Webb,

&gt; Thank you for letting me know about this situation. You are
&gt; absolutely correct in thinking that our work on Taiji Relativity is
&gt; not a repudiation of Einstein's work at all. As you know, abundant
&gt; experimental evidence exists showing the utility of special relativity
&gt; for predicting and explaining physical phenomena.

&gt;&quot;Taiji relativity&quot; is a formulation of special relativity which is
&gt; operationally equivalent to writing the Lorentz transformations using the
&gt; same units for length and time (as done by Taylor and Wheeler in
&gt; Spacetime Physics [an excellent book on special relativity]). However,
&gt; I also proposed a slightly different conceptual interpretation of
&gt; relativity (just as quantum mechanics has different conceptual
&gt; interpretations which are all operationally identical

&gt; [Note: Quantum theory is formulated in two main alternative but
&gt; equivalent ways: the &quot;Schrödinger picture,&quot; in which the Hermitian
&gt; operators representing observables are fixed but the state vectors
&gt; undergo unitary time evolution according to Schrödinger's equation, and
&gt; the &quot;Heisenberg picture,&quot; in which the state vectors are fixed but the
&gt; Hermitian operators undergo unitary time evolution. The two viewpoints
&gt; are completely equivalent logically, and picking which one to use is a
&gt; matter of convention, like deciding whether to measure distance in miles
&gt; or in furlongs. (In particular, declaring one viewpoint to be correct
&gt; and the other one wrong because it is &quot;dystopian&quot; would be as silly as
&gt; declaring furlongs to be the natural unit for measuring distance because
&gt; measurement in miles would be &quot;dystopian.&quot;) In the same way, taiji
&gt; relativity is operationally identical to special relativity.]

&gt; ), and also tried to show how this different conceptual interpretation
&gt; could extend the utility of relativity (for example, it could simplify
&gt; calculations of relativistic many-particle systems, and could be used to
&gt; write down an invariant Planck's law for the blackbody radiation).*

&gt; More recently, my work has been focused on trying to extend the
&gt; Lorentz transformations to accelerated frames. [...]

&gt; I do feel that trying to argue with cranks is hopeless task and in fact,
&gt; that arguing with them might inadvertently lend them some legitimacy in
&gt; some people's eyes, so please don't trouble yourself to post a response
&gt; from me. I can only hope that readers of her posts will take note of the
&gt; source and view her claims about the work of others in a skeptical light.

&gt; If you find anything of interest in my papers, my collaborator Leon and
&gt; I would be happy to discuss those with you further. [...]
&gt; --------------------------------------------------

&gt;&gt; It is my understanding that 1) Einstein is credited with synthesizing
&gt;&gt; several individual theories in math and physics into a coherent set of
&gt;&gt; formulae.

&gt; Correct, but he did much more than that. For example, the paper
&gt; mentioned in his Nobel Prize citation (on the photoelectric effect) was
&gt; not in any sense a synthesis, but was profoundly original. While others
&gt; came close to developing special relativity, the general theory of
&gt; relativity (the extension of Einstein's successful marriage of mechanics
&gt; and electrodynamics that included gravitation as well) was almost
&gt; entirely Einstein's own creation.

&gt;&gt; 2) Any persons whose work may not have been credited in his
&gt;&gt; papers said as much at the time, and others recognized this or not.

&gt; What Elizabeth says about Lorentz and Poincaré having been dismayed
&gt; by Einstein's supposed plagiarism is completely false. I haven't a clue
&gt; where she got that factoid, but here is what Lorentz himself said about
&gt; Einstein's insight:

&gt;&quot;A transformation of the time was necessary. So I introduced the
&gt; conception of a local time which is different for all systems of
&gt; reference which are in motion relative to each other. But I never
&gt; thought that this had anything to do with real time. This real
&gt; time for me was still represented by the old classical notion of
&gt; an absolute time, which is independent of any reference to special
&gt; frames of coordinates. There existed for me only this one true
&gt; time. I considered my time transformation only as a heuristic
&gt; working hypothesis. So the theory of relativity is solely Einstein's
&gt; work. And there can be no doubt that he would have conceived it
&gt; even if the work of his predecessors in the field had not been done
&gt; at all. His work in this respect is independent of the previous
&gt; theories.&quot;

&gt; Similarly, Pais's biography (p. 170) quotes Poincaré's assessment of
&gt; Einstein, in that most candid of settings, a confidential letter
&gt; recommending that a university hire Einstein, as &quot;...one of the most
&gt; original minds I have known; in spite of his youth he already occupies a
&gt; very honorable position among the leading scholars of his time. [...]&quot;

&gt;&gt; 3) any failure to credit does not undermine the originality of
&gt;&gt; Einstein's work.

&gt; Right.

&gt; 4) We all stand on the shoulders of others.
&gt;&gt; Scientists don't and can't work in a vacuum.

&gt; Indeed. It would have been a courtesy for

&gt;&gt;&gt; In what sense was Poincare's theory unsuccessful? How can you speak of
&gt;&gt;&gt; inertial systems and kinematics in the same breath?

&gt;&gt; Why on earth not? Newton's first law, which *defines* the class of
&gt;&gt; inertial frames in Newtonian mechanics, is purely kinematic (dynamics
&gt;&gt; doesn't enter the picture until the second law), so inertial frames have
&gt;&gt; been mentioned in the same sentence as kinematics for quite a long time.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The 1905 Einstein
&gt;&gt;&gt; paper was titled On the ElectroDYNAMICS of Moving BODIES, which is
&gt;&gt;&gt; dynamics, not kinematics.

&gt;&gt; *Of course* the paper was so entitled -- because it was Maxwell's
&gt;&gt; theory of electrodynamics that violated the Galilean relativity formerly
&gt;&gt; enjoyed by all the known laws of physics. That curious phenomenon,
&gt;&gt; which seemed to mandate the existence of an absolute stationary
&gt;&gt; reference frame, was the conundrum that inspired the Michelson-Morley
&gt;&gt; experiment whose null outcome was so vexing. Nobody but Einstein
&gt;&gt; apparently had an inkling that a simple reformulation of kinematics
&gt;&gt; would neatly explain the otherwise _ad hoc_ Lorentz invariance of
&gt;&gt; Maxwell's equations and many other things besides. And I have no idea
&gt;&gt; why on earth you emphasized the word &quot;bodies&quot; -- a moving body is a
&gt;&gt; standard notion in particle kinematics, and dynamics does not enter the
&gt;&gt; picture until the *mass* of the moving body or until specific forces
&gt;&gt; acting upon the body are considered.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Einstein has a kinematical section, but he
&gt;&gt;&gt; did not understand the term,

&gt;&gt; What do you mean, he did not understand the term?! By definition,
&gt;&gt; kinematics is &quot;...that part of the study of motion that does not take
&gt;&gt; force and mass into account.&quot; (See Callahan's book _The geometry of
&gt;&gt; spacetime_. If you prefer the OED, kinematics is &quot;The science of pure
&gt;&gt; motion, considered without reference to the matter or objects moved, or
&gt;&gt; to the force producing or changing the motion.&quot;) In other words, it is
&gt;&gt; that part of the study of motion which is *universal*, independent of
&gt;&gt; any particular force of interaction or of the masses of the moving
&gt;&gt; bodies. Einstein's crucial insight is independent of force and mass,
&gt;&gt; hence perforce purely kinematic, and it pertains to situations in which
&gt;&gt; *any* force field is present, not merely the electromagnetic field. In
&gt;&gt; fact, Einstein's special relativistic kinematics underlies at present
&gt;&gt; *all* physical theories, from the theory of gravitation to quantum field
&gt;&gt; theories of elementary particles; indeed, that is why, for example,
&gt;&gt; David Griffiths's book on elementary particle physics contains a
&gt;&gt; foundational chapter entitled &quot;Relativistic kinematics.&quot; For a more
&gt;&gt; elementary account than Callahan's or Griffiths's, see the chapter
&gt;&gt; entitled &quot;The new kinematics&quot; in Pais's scientific biography of
&gt;&gt; Einstein. The classic book by Weidner and Sells on modern physics also
&gt;&gt; contains a foundational chapter entitled &quot;Relativistic kinematics: space
&gt;&gt; and time&quot; that explains Einstein's key reformulation of kinematics,
&gt;&gt; including consequences such as Lorentz invariance, the invariance of the
&gt;&gt; interval, so-called &quot;time dilation&quot; and &quot;length contraction,&quot; the twin
&gt;&gt;&quot;paradox,&quot; etc. See also chapter 2, &quot;Einsteinian kinematics,&quot; of
&gt;&gt; Wolfgang Rindler's _Essential relativity: special, general, and
&gt;&gt; cosmological_. This is *all* kinematics, not dynamics.

&gt;&gt;&gt; and he simply repeated Poincare's methods
&gt;&gt;&gt; of clock synchronization with light signals, which is a dynamic
&gt;&gt;&gt; process. The postulates are both dynamically based.

&gt;&gt; No, velocity is a purely kinematic notion. It is the time derivative
&gt;&gt; of position, and neither time nor position is a dynamical concept.

&gt;&gt; Poincaré's approach to the problem was dynamical, not kinematic.
&gt;&gt; Indeed, Poincaré was forced to postulate the existence of a &quot;special
&gt;&gt; force&quot; -- I reproduce his words from an earlier post (slightly edited):
&gt;&gt; ---------------------------
&gt;&gt;&quot;Il faut donc a revenir à la theorie de Lorentz; mais si l'on veut
&gt;&gt; la conserver et éviter d'intolérables contradictions, il faut
&gt;&gt; supposer une force speciale qui explique à la foi
&gt;&gt; la contraction et la constance de deux des axes [of the electron].
&gt;&gt; J'ai chercher à determiner cette force, j'ai trouvé qu'*elle peut
&gt;&gt; être assimilée à une pression extérieure constante, agissant sur
&gt;&gt; l'electron déformable et compressible, et dont le travail est
&gt;&gt; proportionnel aux variations du volume de cet électron*.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Note that Poincaré is talking about dynamics (a special force, etc.),
&gt;&gt; *not* about kinematics. Moreover, as far as is known to this day, the
&gt;&gt; electron is a point particle with no internal structure, so Poincaré's
&gt;&gt; notion of a deformable, compressible electron that experiences an
&gt;&gt; external force that effects the Lorentz contraction only along one of
&gt;&gt; its axes (that of its instantaneous velocity) does not correspond at all
&gt;&gt; to the structure of reality as it is presently understood.
&gt;&gt; --------------------------

&gt;&gt;&gt; What precisely do
&gt;&gt;&gt; you think is wrong with Bjerknes's work, David? Please be specific.

&gt;&gt; Well, for one thing, Bjerknes does not, as far as I am aware, discuss
&gt;&gt; the admiration of Einstein that emerges from Pauli's correspondence;
&gt;&gt; rather, he misleadingly cites only a small part of what Pauli actually
&gt;&gt; wrote. (In that regard he is not unlike those anti-Stratfordians who,
&gt;&gt; from a lengthy passage expressing Dryden's almost boundless admiration
&gt;&gt; of Shakespeare, pluck out a single mildly critical utterance as evidence
&gt;&gt; of Dryden's supposed dislike of Shakespeare.) I could go on at some
&gt;&gt; length, but I do not intend to waste time on absurd, vanity-published
&gt;&gt; fulminations on pseudohistory; for a few of the highlights, see the
&gt;&gt; review by John Stachel, a physicist and historian who directs the Center
&gt;&gt; of Einstein Studies at Boston University, at

&gt;&gt;&lt;http://physicsweb.org/article/review/16/4/2&gt;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; BTW, Poincare asserted the POR of relativity as a general principle
&gt;&gt;&gt; before Einstein, as is well known.

&gt;&gt; I have noted elsewhere that Poincaré explicitly stated the principle
&gt;&gt; of relativity, a very significant insight. And as a mathematician I am
&gt;&gt; a great admirer of Poincaré, whose work I regard as among the most

Here is the review by Stachel to which I alluded:
-----------------------------------
Albert Einstein: The Incorrigible Plagiarist
Christopher Jon Bjerknes
2002 XTX Inc 408pp $19.95pb

One's first reaction to books like this is to follow Virgil's advice
about the trimmers in hell: &quot;Speak not of them, but look, and pass them
by&quot; (Dante Inferno III 51). Yet there are reasons for reviewing this
book in spite of its lack of originality or intellectual merit. Its
author has gained a certain notoriety as the result of his indefatigable
- not to say monomaniacal - efforts to indict Einstein as an
&quot;incorrigible plagiarist&quot;.

By his own claim, this is the author's sixth book on the subject of
Einstein's work on the special and general theories of relativity. (A
search of the Internet, however, turned up no record of the other five.)
Its publication by a &quot;vanity publisher&quot; has brought Bjerknes appearances
at bookstores, articles in newspapers and magazines, recommendations on
several websites, to mention just a few of the 355 items that a search
on Google did reveal.

Under attack

The book is of interest as the latest manifestation of an undercurrent
of hostility towards Einstein that has run for almost 90 years,
surfacing from time to time. Since the inception of the theories of
relativity - both special and general - Einstein and his work have been
attacked on the basis of numerous physical and philosophical
misunderstandings and/or prejudices, quite often tinged with various
versions of anti-Semitism.

Relativity has been attacked in the name of US pragmatism, German
idealism, English Hegelianism, French Bergsonianism (by fellow Jew Henri
Bergson!), Soviet &quot;diamat&quot; (dialectical materialism) and Nazi &quot;Deutsche
Physik&quot; (German physics), to name but a few of the high-minded (and not
so high-minded) points of the compass from which such attacks have
originated over the years.

So it seems worthwhile to review such a book - if only to be reminded
that the current still runs strong - and to highlight the need for
caution in uncritically accepting the claims of such &quot;objective&quot; attacks
on Einstein. (I hasten to add that serious critical scrutiny of any
person or theory is always welcome.)

This book is primarily an industrious compilation of citations taken
from various points of the intellectual compass. Well over half of the
book consists of quotations in English and in various original
languages, with source notes - all duly accurate as far as I checked.
The one glaring exception is of a supposed quotation from Einstein that
appears on the front cover of the book - &quot;The secret to creativity is
knowing how to hide your sources&quot; - for which no source is given. This
liberal helping of quotations is seasoned with the author's own
comments, examples of which are given below.

The citations fall into three broad classes. First, there are those from
the traditional anti-Einstein literature. They range from Nobel-prize
winners, like Johannes Stark and Philip Lenard, through run-of-the-mill
physicists such as Ernst Gehrke, to out-and-out confidence tricksters,
like Paul Weyland, to name but some of those cited from the Weimar
Republic days. Bjerknes does not cite their anti-Semitic outbursts or
mention their Nazi connections, nor does he cite any of the extensive
literature from the Nazi era that attempted to salvage the special
theory (while savaging Einstein) by attributing it to the &quot;Aryans&quot;
Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Henri Poincaré. He does cite Sir Edmund
Whittaker, Herbert Ives, and many other non-Germans who made similar
attacks without any public anti-Semitic comments.

Apparently, it does not bother Bjerknes that the various opponents of
the special and general theories that he cites attack relativity from
mutually contradictory viewpoints. Nor does he seem to realize the
incongruity of endorsing claims that Einstein's theories are wrong as
well as claims that they were plagiarized from valid sources! The
culmination of Bjerknes's uncritical piling of name upon name is found
on pages 231-233, which constitute two full pages of names, ranging from
the famous - like Gauss and John Locke - to unknowns like Pavannini and
Caldonazzi, all of whom are cited as having made unnamed (but
referenced) &quot;contributions toward the general theory of relativity&quot;.

In the second main category of citations, Bjerknes cites carefully
chosen excerpts from numerous valuable accounts of the development of
relativity theory that discuss the role of Lorentz, Poincaré and many
others. These researchers carried out work on the optics and
electrodynamics of moving bodies that helped to create the intellectual
atmosphere that led to the formulation of the special theory.

The author, however, takes any hint that Einstein did not work in an
intellectual vacuum as proof positive that he was a plagiarist - as if
any scientific creation is a purely individual activity. Einstein
himself acknowledged that the special theory of relativity would soon
have been formulated without him, while claiming (correctly I believe)
that, in his absence, the general theory would not have been so easy to
arrive at. Indeed, Bjerknes has a much harder time producing evidence of
Einstein's &quot;plagiarism&quot; of the general theory, a topic I shall not
discuss.

I will mention just one example of the author's method of citation: his
treatment of Wolfgang Pauli, in which case we are fortunate in having
additional information. Writing of Einstein's role in the development of
special relativity, Bjerknes argues: &quot;In 1921 Wolfgang Pauli set the
record straight in the Encyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften.&quot;
He then cites extensively - but not completely - Pauli's comments on
the roles of Woldemar Voigt, Lorentz, Poincaré and Einstein in
developing some of the key concepts in the now-standard version of the
special theory.

The author concludes: &quot;After giving Poincaré his due credit, and
acknowledging that Einstein holds no priority for the special theory of
relativity, Pauli, half-heartedly, pays the seemingly obligatory homage
to Einstein the then recently emerged celebrity [by writing] 'It was
Einstein, finally, who in a way completed the basic formulation of this
new discipline.'&quot;. Bjerknes then adds: &quot;It appears that Pauli was
forced, or felt compelled, to praise Einstein with additional
inappropriate and, evidently, insincere comments.&quot;

But what if we consult letters that were sent to Pauli by Felix Klein -
the renowned German mathematician who orchestrated the Encyklopädie? It
emerges from these letters that indeed &quot;Pauli was forced, or felt
compelled&quot; by Klein - although not to praise Einstein more, but to say
more about the role of Poincaré and Lorentz! Similarly, Klein asked
Pauli to give more credit to Hilbert in his discussion of the origins of
the general theory (see Wolfgang Pauli 1979 Scientific Correspondence
with Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, a.o. Volume 1 1919-1929 (Springer,
Berlin)).

Lest Bjerknes now seize upon these letters as evidence against Einstein,
let me hasten to add that in them Klein evaluates Einstein's work most
highly. He refers to Einstein as &quot;a genius&quot; and points out that
&quot;[t]here still remains enough [credit] in this connection for Einstein&quot;.
Klein also exonerates him from any role in the public hullabaloo: &quot;In
his personal comments Einstein is always so lovable, quite in contrast
to the insane publicity that is set in motion in his honour.&quot;

Finally, let us see what Pauli says in full about Einstein in his
Encyklopädie article. After the sentence cited by Bjerknes above, Pauli
continues: &quot;[Einstein's] paper of 1905 was submitted at almost the same
time as Poincaré's article and had been written without previous
knowledge of Lorentz's paper of 1904. It includes not only all the
essential results contained in the other two papers, but shows an
entirely novel, and much more profound understanding of the whole
problem. This will now be demonstrated in detail.&quot;

No wonder Bjerknes does not cite the whole passage!

In the final category of citations in this book, Bjerknes refers many
times to the more recent anti-Einstein literature, claiming that
Einstein plagiarized the ideas of his first wife, Mileva
Einstein-Maric. I have published extensive discussions of this claim -
see, for example, &quot;Albert Einstein and Mileva Maric: a scientific
collaboration that failed to develop&quot;, which appears in my book Einstein
from B to Z (2002 Birkhäuser). I will, therefore, cite just a couple of
examples of the intellectual level of Bjerknes's arguments. Since the
author claims that the work - no matter who did it - is plagiarized, he
ends up with statements that would be truly ludicrous were they not an
insult to a woman who deserves better.

On pages 214-215, for example, Bjerknes writes: &quot;Mileva once hinted to
Albert that she was contemplating publishing her memoirs. Albert told
her to keep her mouth shut, and may have intimated that he, an innocent
idiot, would suffer less than she, the incorrigible plagiarist...What
would Mileva have stood to gain by revealing that Albert had taken
credit for her work, when she herself had merely repeated what others
had already published?&quot;

His discussion of the agreement that the pair came to as part of their
divorce settlement - namely that Albert would give Mileva the
Nobel-prize money, ...

&gt;&gt;&gt; In what sense was Poincare's theory unsuccessful? How can you speak of

&gt;&gt; Why on earth not? Newton's first law, which *defines* the class of
&gt;&gt; inertial frames in Newtonian mechanics, is purely kinematic (dynamics
&gt;&gt; doesn't enter the picture until the second law), so inertial frames have
&gt;&gt; been mentioned in the same sentence as kinematics for quite a long time.
&gt; Newton's first law depends upon Newton's definition of absolute
&gt; space.

"/>

No, although Newton believed in the notion, it is not necessary, as
numerous writers on classical mechanics have taken pains to point out;
see, for example, Vladimir Arnol'd's _Mathematical methods of classical
mechanics_, page 5, where the universe is defined as a four-dimensional
affine space with a real-valued absolute time mapping defined on the
associated vector space of displacements. On page 6, Arnol'd explicitly
notes that

&quot;...'two non-simultaneous events a,b [in the affine 4-space]
occurring at *one and the same place in three-dimensional space*'
has no meaning as long as we have not chosen a coordinate system.&quot;

If there *were* an underlying &quot;absolute space&quot; of the sort Newton
envisioned, then the notion of two events occurring at the same point in
space would certainly be meaningful, since the identity of two points is
a coordinate-independent concept. The formulation adopted by Arnol'd
demonstrates quite conclusively that no such construct is necessary.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Without an absolute space, one must dynamically define an
&gt; inertial system (what is &quot;uniform motion&quot; or &quot;rest&quot; without
&gt; dynamics?).

One of the salient points is that there *is* no notion of absolute
rest. As for uniform motion, it is unaccelerated motion. Acceleration
is a kinematic notion, being the second time derivative of position.

&gt; the metaphysical notion of absolute space, or, more scientifically,
&gt; through dynamics.

&gt; [snip]
&gt;&gt; Nobody but Einstein
&gt;&gt; apparently had an inkling that a simple reformulation of kinematics
&gt;&gt; would neatly explain the otherwise _ad hoc_ Lorentz invariance of
&gt;&gt; Maxwell's equations and many other things besides. And I have no idea
&gt;&gt; why on earth you emphasized the word &quot;bodies&quot; -- a moving body is a
&gt;&gt; standard notion in particle kinematics, and dynamics does not enter the
&gt;&gt; picture until the *mass* of the moving body or until specific forces
&gt;&gt; acting upon the body are considered.
&gt; How do you send light signals, how do you employ observers, how do you
&gt; employ clocks and measuring rods, without employing masses? In section
&gt; 3, Einstein imparts relative velocity to his masses. How can this be
&gt; accomplished without the introduction of force, in inertial systems?

"/>

*No* force is required to impart a velocity; forces produce
*acceleration*, not velocity, accoring to Newton's second law,
force = mass x acceleration. In fact, different intertial observers
will disagree upon the velocity of a particle in uniform motion -- an
observer in the particle's rest frame will assign the particle velocity
zero, while an inertial observer moving relative to the particle's rest
frame will assign it a nonzero velocity.

However, it is pointless to argue interminably about the meaning of
the word &quot;kinematics&quot;; I have cited definitions from the OED and from
Callahan, and readers can draw their own conclusions. If you persist in
believing that Einstein did not understand the term, and if you persist
in using the term in an idiosyncratic sense peculiar to yourself, then
perhaps you should ask yourself why so many books explain Einstein's
postulates in chapters explicitly identifed as kinematic. In particular:

€ Weidner and Sells contains a foundational chapter entitled
&quot;Relativistic kinematics: space and time&quot; that explains Einstein's key
reformulation of kinematics;

€ Griffiths's book on elementary particle physics contains a
foundational chapter entitled &quot;Relativistic kinematics&quot;;

€ The chapter of Pais introducing Einstein's postulates is entitled &quot;The
new kinematics&quot;;

€ The chapter of Wolfgang Rindler's _Essential relativity: special,
general, and cosmological_ that introduces Einstein's postulates is
entitled &quot;Einsteinian kinematics&quot;;

etc., etc.; I could go on at much greater length, but this is getting
tedious, and it already suffices to alert you that the rest of world
uses the term rather differently than you evidently do. These are all
eminent physicists, by the way, and there are many others.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Einstein has a kinematical section, but he

&gt;&gt; spacetime_. If you prefer the OED, kinematics is &quot;The science of pure
&gt;&gt; motion, considered without reference to the matter or objects moved, or
&gt;&gt; to the force producing or changing the motion.&quot;) In other words, it is
&gt;&gt; that part of the study of motion which is *universal*, independent of
&gt;&gt; any particular force of interaction or of the masses of the moving
&gt;&gt; bodies.
&gt; Kinematics is abstract motion. Light signals, clocks and observers are

&gt;&gt; Note that Poincaré is talking about dynamics (a special force, etc.),
&gt;&gt; *not* about kinematics. Moreover, as far as is known to this day, the

You do seem to spend a lot of time recommending 'the truth' by addressing
the person who speaks it. I wanted to investigate this subject since in your

about my ability to speak English, and if it were my first langauge, and
proceeding to make further recommendations of what I should do or not do.

Now, you may wish to disagree with anyone's opinion, but I hope you are
aware of a certain phenomena in the teaching professions; to be didactic to
the degree that other's own opinions and explorations can appear regretable?
They may pursue another thesis than one's own, but that the /motive/ for
seeking to repress their writing by mocking their persons cannot be freely
admitted or ascribed to not 'discovering the truth.'

Do you not protest overmuch? Especially on this Bacon issue, is it all just

Interesting. For some people the red flag is a mention of psychology - they
protest to the skies that nothing other than their surface expression has
any relevance, and to consider their material otherwise must obviously
originate from the pen of a crank. (This, a good century after Dostoyevski!)

Since it is my understanding of the Work that the opinion of another
scholar, poet and indeed the Laureate, Ted Hughes, was precisely the inverse
of any surface rationalism, and even a specific warning of the dangers of
repressing the feminine; of ignoring the animistic rank bodied element of
the work, and further, that this was the great thesis of the Author, I beg
you reconsider when a woman shouts 'foul.'

Perhaps it is the very /type/ of expression which we demand which so
subtlety represses its appearance?

Given that the very language of discussion of these sub-fusc elements is
mightily repressed and marginalised in our own culture, indeed treated with
scant honour in any of its forms, what say you to the condition of the
Cordelias de nos jours?

You may consider your own demand for faithfulness to a cause, to which
another cannot assent - but do you then as result banish the silent woman to
an outer realm accepting only Regans and Gonnerils to your affection?

mistakenly called kinematics. We have no abstract space to play with

able to comprehend it as INERTIAL.
I don't need lectures in kinematics. I would much prefer you restrict
your responses to Einstein's assertions of what constitutes
kinematics. The rest of what you wrote, as far as I had time to read,
is irrelevant for the reasons just stated. Please address Poincare's
clock synch procedure as reiterated by Einstein and misnamed
&quot;kinematics&quot;, and explain how it is done without observers, clocks,
accelerometers, etc., or concede that it is dynamics. And, no you

Are you implying that I'm a ufo crank?

I think the ufo phenomena is probably plasma phenomena
caused by increased solar flares and and/or a drop in the
earth's magnetic field. The lights that appeared over Phoenix
a few years ago were plasma balls, not ufos.

What do you find wrong with this?

Science is the method of establishing the connections between
the phenomena of the material world and its causes and
corollaries. It is the discovery of the laws of Nature through
logical inference and deduction based on the fullest set of
observations, facts and experiments currently available to the
scientist. It is not knowledge known a priori. There must be
substantial proof of the failure of an established category
and the necessity of a new category, before it is reasonable
to posit a new categorical invariant, in the same class as
space, time or mass. The misbegotten introduction of a new
invariant velocity of light, c, has led physicists to act on
faith and resulted in a vulgar mathematical formalism.

This is an electrodynamic, not a kinematic universe as Dr. Hsu
tried to explain to Webb, and mathematical formalism vulgar
or otherwise is not adequate to describe it.

The 'vulgar' remark probably alludes to Einstein's operationalism--
an abstract Swiss village with abstract trains and engineers and
platforms and porters and flashing lights and train whistles. Sort
of an odd tableau to be described by mathematical formalism
which comes out of elitist German idealism.

I'm frankly at a loss to see what you find &quot;personal&quot; in the review.
Stachel points out quite plainly a few of the book's glaring
shortcomings, among them the following:

&quot;Apparently, it does not bother Bjerknes that the various opponents
of the special and general theories that he cites attack relativity
from mutually contradictory viewpoints. Nor does he seem to realize
the incongruity of endorsing claims that Einstein's theories are
wrong as well as claims that they were plagiarized from valid
sources!&quot;

&gt; http://home.comcast.net/~xtxinc/Response.htm

Bjerknes makes the following extraordinary statement:

&quot;...we have a letter from Einstein to Hilbert dated 18 November 1915
in which Einstein acknowledges receipt of a copy of Hilbert's
manuscript, which Einstein had requested from Hilbert on
15 November 1915. The chronology is straightforward. Einstein
received a copy of Hilbert's work on 18 November 1915. Hilbert
delivered his lecture to the Goettingen Academy on 20 November 1915.
Einstein betrayed Hilbert's trust and plagiarized Hilbert's work on
25 November 1915.&quot;

How could Einstein possibly have &quot;plagiarized&quot; Hilbert's work *five days
AFTER(!)* Hilbert had already given a lecture on the subject and hence
would have copious supporting witnesses to his priority?! You evidently
have not thought this through very carefully.

If the evidence was &quot;cut apart,&quot; why is there such a robust consensus

I have already done so, in the parts of my post that you snipped,
without any signs of comprehension on your part thus far. If you indeed
think that Einstein did not understand kinematics and used the term
mistakenly, then you are forced to conclude also that:

€ Weidner does not understand kinematics,

€ Sells does not understand kinematics,

€ Rindler does not understand kinematics,

€ Pais does not understand kinematics,

€ Griffiths does not understand kinematics,

€ Török does not understand kinematics,

€ Marion does not understand kinematics,

€ Thornton does not understand kinematics,

etc., etc. It could be that your continued inability to furnish even a
*single* quotation supporting your viewpoint arises from the fact that
you are the *only* person on the planet who understands kinematics, but
that possibility seems to me rather unlikely.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We have no abstract space to play with

You appear to be laboring under another misapprehension. Kinematics
does not *preclude* the existence of masses or forces in the discussion;
it merely deals that those *universal* aspects of motion in which the
value of the mass and the nature of the force are irrelevant. For the
kinematic foundations of special relativity, it *does not matter* what
the mass of the observer is, what the mass of his or her clock is, what

&quot;Accelerate velocity&quot;?! You mean, *alter* velocity by means of

of position (i.e., the second derivative of velocity), in addition to
suggesting that you harbor some very fundamental confusions about both
basic kinematics and freshman calculus. But don't take my word for it

I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;Einstein's argument&quot;; Einstein didn't
make an &quot;argument&quot; in favor of his postulates (by definition, the two
postulates are *assumptions* whose usefulness, like that of all axioms,
is ultimately in the crucible of observation) in the section in question
-- rather, he stated two fundamental postulates and went on to deduce
their consequences. Specifically, he postulated (1) the principle of
relativity (already explicitly enunciated by Poincaré, but known in the
context of Newtonian mechanics long before that) and (2) the constancy
of the observed velocity of light as measured by any inertial observer.
Testing whether an observer's frame is inertial requires apparatus (a
lattice of clocks, mirrors, etc. and a test particle), but neither the
mass of the test particle nor that of the clocks or mirrors is relevant.

However, as I said, the key point is *not* your misunderstanding of
the definition of kinematics, although that is plainly an obstruction to
your understanding; the key point is that Einstein's postulates obviate
the need for Poincaré's postulated &quot;special force&quot; and other _ad hoc_
constructs, and they give a beautiful, satisfying explanation of the
Lorentz invariance of Maxwell's equations observed by Lorentz. It is
for his beautifully simple insight concerning the best foundational
point of view that Einstein is awarded the lion's share of the credit
for the special theory of relativity.

No, the new kinematic innovation of Einstein is the postulate that
the velocity (a kinematic notion) of light is the same for all inertial
observers. I have also noted that there is an operational procedure for
deciding when a frame is inertial which relies upon a lattice of clocks

What is at issue is the notion of two uniform observers in relative
motion; one need only measure their relative *velocity* (and that of a
light signal). There is no need to ask how one observer got his or her
velocity relative to the other observer. Indeed, if either observer had
to accelerate by the application of a force in order to attain that
relative velocity, than that observer would *by definition* be
accelerated, hence *noninertial*.

&gt; physical theory again and again, and you have not demonstrated any

"/>

I certainly have *not* claimed the existence of any contradictions in
Poincaré's work! He was far too good a mathematician for that. Rather,
what I have noted is that Poincaré's solution to the conundrum requires
that he postulate a &quot;special force&quot; deforming an elastic electron -- and
I have reproduced the quotation in which he says precisely this. If you
don't read French, I can translate it for you.

Einstein's solution obviates the need to posulate such a &quot;special
force,&quot; and explains the observations far more neatly and parsimoniously
than Poincaré's. There was no inherent contradiction in the notion of a
geocentric planetary system either, in the sense that the observations
can be explained by a complicated cascade of epicycles; however, the
heliocentric system won favor because it is simpler, more elegant, and
more parsimonious, and it avoids many unintuitive, _ad hoc_ constructs.
Poincaré's theory contains no contradictions (that I know of); rather,
it is unsuccessful for other reasons having to do with simplicity and
universality, not with internal consistency. (I have noted that there
is no experimental evidence whatever for the spherical electron that
Poincaré imagines being deformed by his &quot;special force,&quot; but this is not
a contradiction; rather, it is a hypothesis not borne out by
observation. However, in the end it does not matter, because Einstein's
theory gets rid of the need for *all* such details.)

&gt; nor any conflict with empirical
&gt; fact.

See above. As far as is now known, the electron is a point particle.
This is not a conflict with observation, but it is an assumption that is
not -- so far -- borne out empirically.

No, I have explained above why Poincaré's theory was ultimately
unsuccessful. It was by no means &quot;toppled&quot; by any internal
inconsistency, and I have never claimed that it was; rather, it lacked
the simplicity and the parsimony that characterized Einstein's beautiful
solution.

David has again gotten personal and insulting and then denies that he
has done so. I cannot take him seriously, but am forced to view him as
an obnoxious crank. The issue is what EINSTEIN wrote, which was
plagiarized from Poincare. David claims a new &quot;kinematics&quot; based on
the DYNAMICS of inertial motion and the DYNAMICS of light
propagations, but he refuses to see the contradictions of his
arguments. Here is the quote from the 1905 paper On the
ElectroDYNAMICS of Moving BODIES (note that there is no &quot;space-time&quot;
involved in this &quot;new&quot;&quot;kinematics&quot;. Space-time in the theory of
relativity was another of Poincare's ideas):

I. KINEMATICAL PART
§ 1. Definition of Simultaneity
Let us take a system of co-ordinates in which the equations of
Newtonian mechanics hold good. In order to render our presentation
more precise and to distinguish this system of co-ordinates verbally
from others which will be introduced hereafter, we call it the
&quot;stationary system.&quot;
If a material point is at rest relatively to this system of
co-ordinates, its position can be defined relatively thereto by the
employment of rigid standards of measurement and the methods of
Euclidean geometry, and can be expressed in Cartesian co-ordinates.

If we wish to describe the motion of a material point, we give the
values of its co-ordinates as functions of the time. Now we must bear
carefully in mind that a mathematical description of this kind has no
physical meaning unless we are quite clear as to what we understand by
&quot;time.&quot; We have to take into account that all our judgments in which
time plays a part are always judgments of simultaneous events. If, for
instance, I say, &quot;That train arrives here at 7 o'clock,'' I mean
something like this: &quot;The pointing of the small hand of my watch to 7
and the arrival of the train are simultaneous events.&quot;

It might appear possible to overcome all the difficulties attending
the definition of &quot;time&quot; by substituting &quot;the position of the small
hand of my watch&quot; for &quot;time.&quot; And in fact such a definition is
satisfactory when we are concerned with defining a time exclusively
for the place where the watch is located; but it is no longer
satisfactory when we have to connect in time series of events
occurring at different places, or--what comes to the same thing--to
evaluate the times of events occurring at places remote from the
watch.

We might, of course, content ourselves with time values determined by
an observer stationed together with the watch at the origin of the
co-ordinates, and co-ordinating the corresponding positions of the
hands with light signals, given out by every event to be timed, and
reaching him through empty space. But this co-ordination has the
disadvantage that it is not independent of the standpoint of the
observer with the watch or clock, as we know from experience. We
arrive at a much more practical determination along the following line
of thought.

If at the point A of space there is a clock, an observer at A can
determine the time values of events in the immediate proximity of A by
finding the positions of the hands which are simultaneous with these
events. If there is at the point B of space another clock in all
respects resembling the one at A, it is possible for an observer at B
to determine the time values of events in the immediate neighbourhood
of B. But it is not possible without further assumption to compare, in
respect of time, an event at A with an event at B. We have so far
defined only an &quot;A time&quot; and a &quot;B time.&quot; We have not defined a common
&quot;time&quot; for A and B, for the latter cannot be defined at all unless we
establish by definition that the &quot;time&quot; required by light to travel
from A to B equals the &quot;time&quot; it requires to travel from B to A. Let a
ray of light start at the &quot;A time&quot; from A towards B, let it at the &quot;B
time&quot; be reflected at B in the direction of A, and arrive again at A
at the &quot;A time&quot; .

In accordance with definition the two clocks synchronize if

t_B - t_A = t'_A - t_B.

We assume that this definition of synchronism is free from
contradictions, and possible for any number of points; and that the
following relations are universally valid:--

2. If the clock at A synchronizes with the clock at B and also with
the clock at C, the clocks at B and C also synchronize with each
other.
Thus with the help of certain imaginary physical experiments we have
settled what is to be understood by synchronous stationary clocks
located at different places, and have evidently obtained a definition
of &quot;simultaneous,&quot; or &quot;synchronous,&quot; and of &quot;time.&quot; The &quot;time&quot; of an
event is that which is given simultaneously with the event by a
stationary clock located at the place of the event, this clock being
synchronous, and indeed synchronous for all time determinations, with
a specified stationary clock.

In agreement with experience we further assume the quantity

(2AB) / (t'_A - t_A) = c,

to be a universal constant--the velocity of light in empty space.

It is essential to have time defined by means of stationary clocks in
the stationary system, and the time now defined being appropriate to
the stationary system we call it &quot;the time of the stationary system.&quot;

Notice the DYNAMICS of Newtonian MECHANICS, the motion of a MATERIAL
point, light signals, observers, etc. It is a repetition of Poincare's
work, was not new, is not kinematics, and does not address space-time,
another of Poincare's ideas. I again observe that David has not
demonstrated that Poincare's theory was unsuccessful, only that it was
more physically oriented and comprehensive than Einstein's. I again
observe that in order for a space to be inertial, a mass subject to no
NET FORCE must rest or move uniformly in a rectilinear line relative
to that space, because inertial motion is a DYNAMIC entity, and
abstract spaces do not tell us how masses move in these arbitrary
images, but dynamics does, through observation of moving masses.
Nowhere in the known universe do we masses subject to no forces.
Kinematics cannot define inertial motion.

Stachel made unsupported assertions. Why don't you try to back them
up?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; response, which appears at:

&gt;&gt; http://home.comcast.net/~xtxinc/Response.htm

&gt; Bjerknes makes the following extraordinary statement:

&gt;&quot;...we have a letter from Einstein to Hilbert dated 18 November 1915
&gt; in which Einstein acknowledges receipt of a copy of Hilbert's
&gt; manuscript, which Einstein had requested from Hilbert on

&gt; received a copy of Hilbert's work on 18 November 1915. Hilbert
&gt; delivered his lecture to the Goettingen Academy on 20 November 1915.
&gt; Einstein betrayed Hilbert's trust and plagiarized Hilbert's work on

&gt; How could Einstein possibly have &quot;plagiarized&quot; Hilbert's work *five days
&gt; AFTER(!)* Hilbert had already given a lecture on the subject and hence
&gt; would have copious supporting witnesses to his priority?! You evidently

Those witnesses, Wiechert and Klein, acknowledged Hilbert's priority.
Einstein was a habitual plagiarist. Einstein acknowledged Hilbert's
priority in 1916, which you would have known if you had read
Bjerknes's book. You evidently are ignorant of the facts, but
criticize anyway.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Stachel had tried to claim that Einstein anticipated Hilbert, but

&gt;&gt; Bjerknes has discredited both Stachel's personal attack, and Stachel's
&gt;&gt; efforts to deny Hilbert's priority with mutilated evidence:

&gt;&gt; http://home.comcast.net/~xtxinc/AEGRBook.htm

&gt; If the evidence was &quot;cut apart,&quot; why is there such a robust consensus

You have made an unsupported assertion, which again demonstrates your
ignorance, and willingness to make personal attacks based only on your
ignorance. By saying Bjerknes is talking nonsense, without showing how
you believe what he has said is nonsense, you are making a personal
attack in lieu of an argument. This demonstrates that you are ignorant
as to what constitutes a personal attack in an argument. You are also
merely waving your hands to make your attack. Why don't you try to
support you assertion that there is &quot;robust concensus&quot; that Bjerknes
is wrong that the evidence was mutilated. Better yet, try to find one
such person.

You have not shown any failure to comprehend on my part. You tried to

The idealization occurs to the extent that the masses behave exactly

substitute). And the language in the purely biographical section is
carefully chosen to blacken Einstein's reputation. A very slovenly,
cheapjack piece of work. Right at the end, it actually does introduce
one relevant fact, but fails to put it in context. TV journalism at its
worst.

If this is the best support there is for the hypothesis that Mileva
Maric deserves co-credit, no wonder it is reserved to cranks.

The source of my critique of Einstein's STR, Webb, is a
program I did in philosophy that pitted the British empricists
against the German Idealists. I came to 'not admire' the German
Idealists.

Einstein was a self-admitted German Idealist and the German
Idealists (i.e., the German Aesthetics movement in physics)
embraced Einstein's theory not only because of its simplicity
and aesthetic beauty but because Einstein's theory is intrinsically
authoritarian. I'll deconstruct the STR rhetoric in another post.
German Idealism was the official philosophy of the Third Reich
(plenty of scholarship on that point).

It is now politically incorrect to critique German Idealism in Einstein's
theories because German idealism 'romanticized' for lack of a better
word, the mass murder of Jews.

Political rectitude is not only crazed, it too is a form of authoritarianism.

I don't doubt that you subscribe to it.

Just for the record, you're the one 'dragging Lynne into this,'
and I have no idea why.

Are you alluding to Lynne as 'a mouse?'

You're probably not aware that 'mouse' is slang for tampon
in some circles.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Stuarts, with all their rumors of illegitimacy and regicide and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kidnapping and rape and James' father Darnley lying strangled in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; garden--Bothwell's murder trial was a complete farce--the whole
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chaotic, scandalous mess of the Stuart line--were SIMPLY NOT GOOD
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ENOUGH FOR THE HAPSBURGS. The Spanish Marriage was never going
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to happen even before it started. The question of succession was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; overwhelming because Elizabeth was a heretic and a heretic had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; named James I king (if she even did). James I was not a legitimate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; heir because Bothwell was his father and everybody knew it--they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; looked like twins--and there was no way that the scruffy Stuarts were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going to snag a Hapsburg princess. The Hapsburg line was at least 800
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; years while the Stuarts were nouveau royalty from a line only a few
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; generations old.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And what was Denmark's royalty? And worse of all, James was the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prettiest one in the family. Anne looked 'like a man' according to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accounts and Charles had a personality as disagreeable as his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; father's. England was horribly in debt and rich Spain knew that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; James only wanted the Infanta's dowry and would go through it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a nonce.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Catholic Marriage was a loss cause [sic]

&gt;&gt;&gt; A lost cause? Or a loss because..?

&gt;&gt; A lost cause. Some mouse gesture is sending my posts before
&gt;&gt; I can edit them.

&gt; What?! Elizabeth actually *edits* her posts?!

&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Weir is ignorant of too much basic history to be taken seriously.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Even PWDBard gets something right once in a great while!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have the equivalent of a minor in history (in an interdisciplinary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; program). That doesn't mean much

&gt;&gt;&gt; Indeed!

&gt;&gt; Predictable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but I do feel qualified to post
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in HLAS.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Any fool can post in h.l.a.s., and experience shows that many fools
&gt;&gt;&gt; do -- even anti-Einsteinian relativity cranks post all manner of
&gt;&gt;&gt; crackpot nonsense here.

&gt;&gt; Einsteinianism is just another orthodoxy you've collected, Webb.
&gt;&gt; Stratfordianism, no doubt Marxism,

&gt; I have explained numerous times my reference to Groucho, not Karl,
&gt; Marx, although I had thought that the context would have made it
&gt; obvious. However, Elizabeth, despite my repeated clarifications, is not
&gt; only unfamiliar with Groucho Marx's celebrated remark but is actually
&gt; incapable of distinguishing Groucho Marx from Karl Marx! This lapse is
&gt; indicative of a cognitive deficit even more conspicuous than the one
&gt; that occasioned Art's cretinous confusion of the two Peter Gays!

&gt;&gt; Ripsianism--I guess that's
&gt;&gt; ultra-orthodoxy--

&gt; There is nothing particularly Orthodox about Rips's forays into
&gt; Biblical &quot;codes,&quot; and many Orthodox Jews have objected publicly. But
&gt; since you have not even read Rips and have no idea what he said, how
&gt; could you know this?

&gt;&gt; Einsteinianism. You'd have a massive anxiety
&gt;&gt; attack if you had to leave the commune. And (I'm laughing, I
&gt;&gt; can't help it) you come into HLAS to ENFORCE ORTHODOXY.

&gt; No, I read h.l.a.s. because because I like some of the participants,
&gt; because I occasionally learn somthing interesting from the more
&gt; knowledgeable of these, and because I enjoy the wit of others. However,
&gt; most of all I read h.l.a.s. because it affords copious amusement.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Oxford/Derby duo is the truth behind the Shakespeare pen name
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suspected in the 1920s.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No textbooks for us, we got only primary documents, consequently
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I see that Oxfordianism is incomplete because Looney did not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; access Oxford's primary documents.

&gt; Looney is not the last word on the Oxfordian &quot;theory,&quot; and others
&gt; have utilized primary documents -- although since Elizabeth does not
&gt; read sources anyway, one would not expect her to know this. Elizabeth's
&gt; outdated notion of Oxfordianism remains Victorian. (However, one cannot
&gt; complain too much, since her notion of logic remains paleolithic.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Baconians, on the other hand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and despite the loss and scattering of BAcon's papers (I just learned
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the Folger is sitting on a huge collection of Bacon's annotated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; books and manuscript notebooks and has been very quiet about it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for the last eighty years--nothing has ever been catalogued)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Where did Elizabeth &quot;learn&quot; this choice bit of gossip?

&gt;&gt; In an article

&gt; WHAT &quot;article&quot;? Can Elizabeth furnish a credible source for once?
&gt; Or is this the perishable internet, and must one lament Wayback's
&gt; continuing lack of a search feature?

&gt;&gt; on the dispersal of a Baconian biographer's estate. He

&gt; Who? Source?

&gt;&gt; wrote between 1900 and 1920 and collected many Shakespeare quartos
&gt;&gt; when they were still very cheap. I suppose the Shakespeare quartos are
&gt;&gt; on display but the short article--probably from Baconiana

&gt;&quot;Probably from Baconiana&quot;?! Now that's what I call a precise
&gt; citation! (The fact that Elizabeth evidently regards a citation from
&gt; such a source as authoritative is in itself uproariously funny!)

&gt;&gt; --definitely stated
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; Bacon's other papers were being kept uncatalogued in the basement.

&gt; Of course, the source of this chestnut is nowhere identified. That
&gt; may well be fortunate, as we have already seen on numerous occasions how
&gt; farcically Elizabeth misreads the very few sources that she actually
&gt; does cite -- J.-P. Hsu, Akrigg, Dave Kathman's online essay on dating
&gt; _The Tempest_, Poincaré, etc., etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Baconians have 15 volumes of Bacon's letters and papers in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Spedding's monumental work. Oxfordians have nothing even slightly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comparable to Spedding and of course the Strats have a small
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fist full of documents that have absolutely no bearing on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare works.

&gt;&gt; Oh. I see you didn't stop to dispute this statement.

&gt; Even if absolutely everything Elizabeth had ever written was complete
&gt; crap -- which incidentally is a very close approximation to the actual
&gt; state of affairs -- that circumstance would not obligate Elizabeth's
&gt; interlocutors to dispute her every statement, no matter how ridiculous
&gt; those statements might be.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Proving it is the truth is difficult but now possible
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the evidence in my hand...which of course is a factor in my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contempt
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Baconian theory which has had many other shortcomings.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bacon has the Strachey letter.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Elizabeth just keeps the comedy coming faster than one recover from
&gt;&gt;&gt; helpless laughter!

&gt;&gt; What were the odds that the best evidence of Shakespeare authorship

&gt; As has been pointed out to Elizabeth numerous times by several
&gt; people, the Strachey letter is *not* &quot;the best evidence of Shakespeare
&gt; authorship,&quot; for the simple reason that it does not limit the field very
&gt; much -- indeed, it is not known how many people had access to the
&gt; letter's content, nor who those people were. The letter is pertinent
&gt; only as a minor sideshow, in that it pretty conclusively eliminates
&gt; Oxford on chronological grounds (not that there was any credible reason
&gt; to suspect that Oxford had anything to do with it in the first place);
&gt; indeed, the entire authorship &quot;question&quot; is a minor sideshow anyway.

&gt;&gt; would land on Sir Francis Bacon's desk, Webb? The odds are
&gt;&gt; 4,000,000 to 1.

&gt; One wonders how Elizabeth arrives at this figure!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It clearly was on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the wane in the years just before...yes before World War I. Weir is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; living
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Edwardian era which is about the last time the Baconian theory had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; significant or enthusiastic following.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The truth has an inverse relation to popularity.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Really?! The idea that the earth is roughly spherical is far more
&gt;&gt;&gt; popular than the notion that it is flat -- does the inverse relationship
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Elizabeth's pronouncement mean that the flat earth scenario is closer
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the truth?

&gt;&gt; Do you think that the Oxfordian theory is 'more true' than the
&gt;&gt; Baconian theory?

&gt; No. There is no credible evidence known to me that supports *either*
&gt; of the theories. Of the partisans of the two, the Baconians have given
&gt; perhaps the more demented lunatic &quot;arguments&quot; for their candidate's
&gt; authorship (chiefly crackpot cryptography and the like), but some of the
&gt; nuttier lunatic fringe Oxfordians have recently furnished the Baconians
&gt; with some stiff competition in their ongoing Dementia Derby.

&gt;&gt; The Oxfordians outnumber the Baconians
&gt;&gt; by probably a thousand to one. That may be too conservative.

&gt; That's probably because a few of the more rational Oxfordians accept
&gt; the arguments by which the Baconian nutcases of yesteryear were refuted
&gt; long ago.

Here is where you get yourself into trouble Webb, because

I have, in fact, read what I've cited and it is you who got caught

I have not read Akrigg's work on Southampton, I cited a
review article (archived) on Akrigg's now out-of-print book
in a post.

I'm reading Akrigg's work on the Court of James I.

You, in turn, have written

41 posts

on my remark about--not even a reference to or a citation of--
a bibliography I saw in passing.

Not much in the way of a citation but it was at least proportional
to the non-issue of Southampton's cross-dressing, a subject
which seems to interest you far more than it does me.

&gt; Just for the record, you're the one 'dragging Lynne into this,'

"/>

Because Lynne has informed us that her nickname is &quot;Mouse,&quot; and she
has even signed posts that way:

&lt;&gt;,

&lt;&gt;,

&lt;&gt;,

&lt;&gt;,

and many others. It is a pity that you would not recognize a jest if it
bit you; indeed, your total incapacity for recognizing humor might have
saved you the trouble of excoriating my supposed Marxism when I
expressed qualified approval of an utterance of Groucho -- not Karl --
Marx. (Of course, your repetition of the *same* stupidity leads me to
doubt seriously whether you can even distinguish between the two.)

It is also a great pity that you evidently do not read Lynne's posts
-- you could learn a great deal from her. She is often charmingly
witty, she has an amusing sense of humor, and she has never (as far as I
know) made vile accusations of intellectual dishonesty, racism, sexism,
etc., let alone *unsupportable* accusations of that nature, as you so
frequently do. Finally, when Lynne is caught out in a mistake, she
gracefully acknowledges the error, and thanks those who drew attention
to her lapse for the correction. She does not distort grotesquely what
others have said (as you just did yet *again* in the case of Professor
J.P. Hsu), misattribute recklessly, or fabricate bogus &quot;quotations.&quot;
She even recognizes her own words, and does not attribute them to
others! Finally, she does not try to pass off pure invention as fact.

Finally, it is a pity that you cannot use the Google archive
competently.

Beyond that, I have no idea why you invoke a &quot;mouse gesture&quot; -- are
you attempting one of your usual feeble and farcical exculpations (this
is the perishable internet, my mouse made me do it, etc.)?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I very seriously doubt that that's what Lynne had in mind in

name upon a protagonist in one of her novels. But if you're so very
certain of it, why don't you bother Lynne about it rather than me? You
just love to call people sexist and racist without any grounds -- this
is your big chance to do so yet again.

&gt;&gt; Way Cool:

&gt; You are a relative newcomer so perhaps you have not observed the
&gt; phenomenon, but Elizabeth routinely distorts and misrepresents the words
&gt; of others, and her post above is no exception. Indeed, as we shall
&gt; below, Elizabeth is not even capable of using Google competently.

&gt;&gt; My understanding is that Joao Magueijo is Portugese, but perhaps his
&gt;&gt; PhD from Cambridge, St. John's fellowship, Royal Society Research
&gt;&gt; Fellowship, and tenure at Imperial College has altered his outlook.
&gt;&gt; However, his descriptions of the &quot;discussions&quot; between peers makes
&gt;&gt; these posts look like love letters, so I have cause to doubt. Thanks
&gt;&gt; for the warning. Can't wait to see Herr Webb's response.

&gt; I will discuss the work of João Magueijo further in another post. As
&gt; far as Elizabeth is concerned, this is a fruitless undertaking, as she
&gt; is both ignorant and mathematically and scientifically illiterate;
&gt; however, perhaps you know more about those subjects than she does
&gt; (indeed, it would be virtually impossible to know less), so I will take
&gt; the time to explain at greater length.

&gt; First, however, let's take the posts that Elizabeth attempted
&gt; haplessly to quote.

&gt; This one is, if possible, even more bizarre, because those are her

&gt; The supposed quotation &quot;under the influence of Aryan Supremacists&quot; that
&gt; appears in her remarks is wholly fabricated by Elizabeth -- I did not
&gt; write it, as you can readily check for yourself by pasting the quotation
&gt; into the &quot;exact phrase&quot; box of the Google Groups search page

&gt;&lt;http://groups.google.com/advanced_group_search&gt;;

&gt; as you will see, there are nine hits; of those, a plurality (four) are
&gt; authored by Elizabeth herself, while all the others merely quote posts
&gt; of Elizabeth in which the phrase is used. Elizabeth herself is the
&gt; source of the &quot;quotation&quot; -- but we have seen before, on many occasions,
&gt; that Elizabeth fabricates quotations at will. Perhaps the most amusing
&gt; instances are the posts in which she fabricates quotations concerning
&gt; Richard Field, ostensibly from Dave Kathman's essay on dating _The
&gt; Tempest_, an online essay in which Richard Field is *not even mentioned
&gt; anywhere*!

&gt; Of course, opining that Elizabeth was under the influence of Aryan
&gt; supremacists would be far short of calling her a Nazi, but I have not
&gt; even asserted the former, let alone the latter.

&gt; As for skinheads in Idaho, you can verify for yourself by means of

and was apparently very convincing as a girl.&quot;

&quot;What is your source for this claim?&quot;

&lt;&gt;

[Here I cannot resist quotion Tom Lay's followup:

&quot;I've mostly been skipping over Weir's posts lately, but I do hate
to have missed this little gem. Thanks for pointing it out.&quot;]

Elizabeth's rejoinder:

&quot;It's in the record

[*WHAT* &quot;record&quot;? Elizabeth never gets more specific than that.]

that Southampton acted in theatrical productions,
probably at Court instead of the public theatres. He is supposed
to have taken a female role in MSND which was played for his mother's
wedding according to some Strat scholars. [...]

&quot;Here are some academic pages that point to the fact that Wriothesley
was gay....&quot; [...]

[Of course, I did *not* ask for evidence that Southampton was gay --
rather, I asked for evidence of his supposed cross dressing (which is
another matter entirely -- many gay men are not transvestites, and some
cross dressers are not gay). I also sought evidence that he used to
hang around the theatres hoping to play female roles, that he was given
a few such roles, and that he was quite convincing in them, as you
claimed. You *still* have furnished no such evidence, and you probably
never will, leading the reader to suspect that the whole charming
fantasy was pure invention.]

&quot;Here's a site on gender studies where a bibliography of
transexualism features a book on Southampton.

&quot;

[Here the reader can simply visit the URL in question and check that the
*ONLY* reference to Akrigg therein is the following bibliography entry:

Akrigg, G. P. V.
Shakespeare and the Earl of Southampton.
London: H. Hamilton, 1968.
Suz, Ugl DA 391.1 .S8 A65

I had read Akrigg, and I knew perfectly well that he did not assert that
Southampton was gay, let alone that he was a transvestite theatrical
habitué seeking and appearing in female roles; as we shall see below,
Elizabeth had not read the book at all.]

&lt;&gt;

My followup:

&quot;The only reference I see to Southampton is to Akrigg's _Shakespeare
and the Earl of Southampton_; is that *really* the book you had in
mind? If so, where does Akrigg opine that Southamtpon was &quot;overly
fond of drag,&quot; that he used to &quot;hang about the theatres hoping to
play female roles,&quot; or that he was &quot;very convincing as a girl&quot;?
Or did you just make that up?:

Elizabeth's rejoinder:

&quot;Why else would a site on queer studies have a book on Southampton
listed in the biography [sic]?&quot;

&lt;&gt;

My followup:

&quot;Ah -- I see that you *haven't* read Akrigg. Rather, you infer --
from its mere presence in a bibliography(!) -- that the book asserts
that Southampton was 'overly fond of drag,' that he used to 'hang
about the theatres hoping to play female roles,' or that he was
'very convincing as a girl'! Astounding -- you infer the detailed
content of a book that you have *not even read*, solely from its
appearance in someone's bibliography!!&quot;

In fact, the book by Akrigg in question contains the following damning
passage, which I reproduced in a new thread:

From my post:

&quot;After summarizing the evidence underlying speculations concerning
Southampton's sexuality, Akrigg writes:

'It all adds up to one thing: nothing would be less surprising
than to learn that during certain periods of his early life
Southampton passed through homosexual phases but, until better
evidence is found, only a fool will declare that he did.'

One need scarcely add that only one with even *less* sound judgment
than a fool would attempt to infer the content of a book she had
never read from its mere appearance in someone's bibliography!&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Not much in the way of a citation but it was at least proportional
&gt; to the non-issue of Southampton's cross-dressing, a subject

No, I've never been particularly interested in Southampton's cross
dressing or sexual orientation; it was you wrote

&quot;Southampton was overly fond of drag and used to hang about the
theatres hoping to play female roles. He was given a few parts
and was apparently very convincing as a girl.&quot;

I am merely interested in the question of whether there exists any
credible *evidence* for such a detailed, outlandish assertion. Plainly,
if any such evidence exists, it is utterly unknown to you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No, the quotation I posted came *directly from the text* of Akrigg's
book, not from the index. Evidently you don't know what an index is
either if you think that an index is likely to contain text like

&quot;It all adds up to one thing: nothing would be less surprising

Yes; the claim is as silly as the argument (if one may call it that)

What I find exceedingly odd is the presumption, apparently widespread
among anti-Einsteinians, that if Mileva Maric's name was indeed removed
from a preliminary version of the 1905 special relativity paper, that
this action was taken by Einstein himself; if it occurred at all, it is
at least as likely to have been taken by Maric. I have upon several
occasions removed myself from joint authorship of a paper because I felt
my contribution to be insufficient to warrant joint authorship, and I
know other instances of the same thing; it is simply a matter of
personal ethics. On the other hand, in my entire professional life I
know of only *one* instance in which an author tried to remove his
coauthor's name -- unsuccessfully, as it turned out: there existed a
preliminary manuscript with both authors' names affixed, and the
journal's editor would not publish the article in its altered form
without the removed coauthor's consent.

Indeed. One does not even know for certain whether there *existed* a
joint preliminary version of the paper; to my knowledge, no such
document is extant. Even if such a joint version once existed, which is
certainly possible, one has no way of knowing why the paper eventually
appeared without Maric's name, and the likelihood seems greater that
this change was made voluntarily by Maric rather than unilaterally by
Einstein. Matters being so, one simply has no way of knowing what
happened, and it seems foolish to begin hurling very serious accusations
of intellectual dishonesty on such a flimsy basis.

&gt; David has again gotten personal and insulting and then denies that he
&gt; has done so. I cannot take him seriously, but am forced to view him as
&gt; an obnoxious crank. The issue is what EINSTEIN wrote, which was
&gt; plagiarized from Poincare. David claims a new &quot;kinematics&quot; based on
&gt; the DYNAMICS of inertial motion and the DYNAMICS of light
&gt; propagations, but he refuses to see the contradictions of his
&gt; arguments. Here is the quote from the 1905 paper On the
&gt; ElectroDYNAMICS of Moving BODIES (note that there is no &quot;space-time&quot;
&gt; involved in this &quot;new&quot;&quot;kinematics&quot;. Space-time in the theory of
&gt; relativity was another of Poincare's ideas):

&gt; I. KINEMATICAL PART
&gt; § 1. Definition of Simultaneity
&gt; Let us take a system of co-ordinates in which the equations of
&gt; Newtonian mechanics hold good. In order to render our presentation
&gt; more precise and to distinguish this system of co-ordinates verbally
&gt; from others which will be introduced hereafter, we call it the
&gt;&quot;stationary system.&quot;
&gt; If a material point is at rest relatively to this system of
&gt; co-ordinates, its position can be defined relatively thereto by the
&gt; employment of rigid standards of measurement and the methods of
&gt; Euclidean geometry, and can be expressed in Cartesian co-ordinates.

&gt; If we wish to describe the motion of a material point, we give the
&gt; values of its co-ordinates as functions of the time. Now we must bear
&gt; carefully in mind that a mathematical description of this kind has no
&gt; physical meaning unless we are quite clear as to what we understand by
&gt;&quot;time.&quot; We have to take into account that all our judgments in which
&gt; time plays a part are always judgments of simultaneous events. If, for
&gt; instance, I say, &quot;That train arrives here at 7 o'clock,'' I mean
&gt; something like this: &quot;The pointing of the small hand of my watch to 7
&gt; and the arrival of the train are simultaneous events.&quot;

&gt; It might appear possible to overcome all the difficulties attending
&gt; the definition of &quot;time&quot; by substituting &quot;the position of the small
&gt; hand of my watch&quot; for &quot;time.&quot; And in fact such a definition is
&gt; satisfactory when we are concerned with defining a time exclusively
&gt; for the place where the watch is located; but it is no longer
&gt; satisfactory when we have to connect in time series of events
&gt; occurring at different places, or--what comes to the same thing--to
&gt; evaluate the times of events occurring at places remote from the
&gt; watch.

&gt; We might, of course, content ourselves with time values determined by
&gt; an observer stationed together with the watch at the origin of the
&gt; co-ordinates, and co-ordinating the corresponding positions of the
&gt; hands with light signals, given out by every event to be timed, and
&gt; reaching him through empty space. But this co-ordination has the
&gt; disadvantage that it is not independent of the standpoint of the
&gt; observer with the watch or clock, as we know from experience. We
&gt; arrive at a much more practical determination along the following line
&gt; of thought.

&gt; If at the point A of space there is a clock, an observer at A can
&gt; determine the time values of events in the immediate proximity of A by
&gt; finding the positions of the hands which are simultaneous with these
&gt; events. If there is at the point B of space another clock in all
&gt; respects resembling the one at A, it is possible for an observer at B
&gt; to determine the time values of events in the immediate neighbourhood
&gt; of B. But it is not possible without further assumption to compare, in
&gt; respect of time, an event at A with an event at B. We have so far
&gt; defined only an &quot;A time&quot; and a &quot;B time.&quot; We have not defined a common
&gt;&quot;time&quot; for A and B, for the latter cannot be defined at all unless we
&gt; establish by definition that the &quot;time&quot; required by light to travel
&gt; from A to B equals the &quot;time&quot; it requires to travel from B to A. Let a
&gt; ray of light start at the &quot;A time&quot; from A towards B, let it at the &quot;B
&gt; time&quot; be reflected at B in the direction of A, and arrive again at A
&gt; at the &quot;A time&quot; .

&gt; In accordance with definition the two clocks synchronize if

&gt; t_B - t_A = t'_A - t_B.

&gt; We assume that this definition of synchronism is free from
&gt; contradictions, and possible for any number of points; and that the
&gt; following relations are universally valid:--

&gt; 2. If the clock at A synchronizes with the clock at B and also with
&gt; the clock at C, the clocks at B and C also synchronize with each
&gt; other.
&gt; Thus with the help of certain imaginary physical experiments we have
&gt; settled what is to be understood by synchronous stationary clocks
&gt; located at different places, and have evidently obtained a definition
&gt; of &quot;simultaneous,&quot; or &quot;synchronous,&quot; and of &quot;time.&quot; The &quot;time&quot; of an
&gt; event is that which is given simultaneously with the event by a
&gt; stationary clock located at the place of the event, this clock being
&gt; synchronous, and indeed synchronous for all time determinations, with
&gt; a specified stationary clock.

&gt; In agreement with experience we further assume the quantity

&gt; (2AB) / (t'_A - t_A) = c,

&gt; to be a universal constant--the velocity of light in empty space.

&gt; It is essential to have time defined by means of stationary clocks in
&gt; the stationary system, and the time now defined being appropriate to
&gt; the stationary system we call it &quot;the time of the stationary system.&quot;

&gt; Notice the DYNAMICS of Newtonian MECHANICS, the motion of a MATERIAL
&gt; point, light signals, observers, etc. It is a repetition of Poincare's
&gt; work, was not new, is not kinematics, and does not address space-time,
&gt; another of Poincare's ideas. I again observe that David has not
&gt; demonstrated that Poincare's theory was unsuccessful, only that it was
&gt; more physically oriented and comprehensive than Einstein's. I again
&gt; observe that in order for a space to be inertial, a mass subject to no
&gt; NET FORCE must rest or move uniformly in a rectilinear line relative
&gt; to that space, because inertial motion is a DYNAMIC entity, and
&gt; abstract spaces do not tell us how masses move in these arbitrary
&gt; images, but dynamics does, through observation of moving masses.
&gt; Nowhere in the known universe do we masses [sic] subject to no forces.
&gt; Kinematics cannot define inertial motion.

"/>

No, the number of misconceptions in this paragraph is staggering.
First, Poincaré's theory was unsuccessful, as I already said, because
among other things he postulated the existence of an unexplained
&quot;special force&quot; deforming a supposedly elastic electron, an _ad hoc_
construct not required in Einstein's formulation. Second, as I have
already said several times, there is no such thing as an &quot;inertial
space&quot;; there are only inertial *reference frames*, but these are merely
the bases of a vector space, a *mathematical* notion, and make sense in
a spacetime devoid of masses. You are confusing the adjective
&quot;inertial&quot; used in discussing such a reference with frame with the
inertia of a massive body. Third, the only aspect of motion pertinent
to Einstein's key second postulate is the velocity of light, a purely
kinematic notion. Finally, although special relativity does of course
contain a dynamical component, Einstein's key innovation was kinematic,
not dynamical -- indeed, the dynamical equation of special relativity
reads *exactly* the same as Newton's second law, F=ma, except that the
vectors in question are now Minkowski 4-vectors, and m is now the proper
mass. See Callahan's chapter on relativistic dynamics, p. 132, the last
equation. On the other hand, Eistein's crucial innovation, the second
postulate, is expained in Callahan's chapter 2, appropriately entitled
&quot;Special relativity - kinematics.&quot; That is the last I shall say about

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why on earth not? Newton's first law, which *defines* the class of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inertial frames in Newtonian mechanics, is purely kinematic

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Newton's first law depends upon Newton's definition of absolute

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, although Newton believed in the notion, it is not necessary, as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; numerous writers on classical mechanics have taken pains to point out;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see, for example, Vladimir Arnol'd's _Mathematical methods of classical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mechanics_, page 5, where the universe is defined as a four-dimensional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; affine space with a real-valued absolute time mapping defined on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; associated vector space of displacements. On page 6, Arnol'd
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; explicitly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; notes that

&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm not surprised that you snipped the quotation from Arnol'd
&gt;&gt; demonstrating that there is no necessity for the existence of an
&gt;&gt;&quot;absolute space,&quot; as you claimed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You are again confusing kinematics with dynamics.

&gt;&gt; You can make all the assertions you like; thus far, however, I am the
&gt;&gt; one who furnished both the definition and the quotations.
&gt; I showed your mistakes. You can hide from them. That is your problem,
&gt; not mine.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You can define
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything you like in kinematics. Restrict yourself to what EINSTEIN
&gt;&gt;&gt; mistakenly called kinematics.

&gt;&gt; I have already done so, in the parts of my post that you snipped,
&gt;&gt; without any signs of comprehension on your part thus far.
&gt; You have not shown any failure to comprehend on my part. You tried to
&gt; form an argument that because someone else discussed kinematics,
&gt; Einstein discussed kinematics, after I had already shown you that
&gt; Einstein had not. Someone else's discussion of kinematics does not
&gt; prove that Einstein discussed kinematics. I asked you repeatedely to
&gt; back your assertions based upon what EINSTEIN wrote and you repeatedly
&gt; failed to do so.

Well, there is certainly a staggering quantity of distinguished
physicists whose books contains chapters entitled &quot;Relativistic
kinematics&quot; and the like. All they *all* wrong?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;If you indeed
&gt;&gt; think that Einstein did not understand kinematics and used the term

Thanks for pointing this out; the page is most amusing. The prose

&quot;The problem on a ether is not harmless, it is in 'a solar plexus'
of physics, its incorrect solution puts a considerable loss to
scientific views. Relativists go on to persist in the fallacy. They
have created such 'brilliant' supercomposite mathematical formalism.
They 'have broken fire wood' in the irrepressible imaginations with
waiving of common sense. And they came into that so far, that now it
is inconvenient to them to return on the guilty Earth and to be
recognized that they for noting so much time misted a head to all
mankind.&quot;

&gt;&gt; merely waving your hands to make your attack. Why don't you try to
&gt;&gt; support you assertion that there is &quot;robust concensus [sic]&quot; that Bjerknes
&gt;&gt; is wrong that the evidence was mutilated. Better yet, try to find one
&gt;&gt; such person.

&gt; I have never yet found a physics or mathematics text or journal
&gt; article in the professional literature that attributed general
&gt; relativity solely to Hilbert. Perhaps you know of one that does.

Again you are irrational, David. You are arguing another of your straw
man arguments, and misrepresenting what you know Bjerknes has written.
Bjerknes never claimed that David Hilbert was the sole creator of
general relativity. You say you have read his book Albert Einstein the
Incorrigible Plagiarist. You should know that he lists HUNDREDS of
people as participants in the development of the theory. Instead of
supporting your assertion, you hide from it. Name one source who has
stated that Bjerknes's claim that the evidence was mutilated is
nonsense.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I suggest you read both.

&gt;&gt;&gt; On that I agree!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you really want to see John Stachel at his finest, watch the PBS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; special on Mileva Maric. It is a real treat, as Stachel avoids the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; facts yet again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inertial systems and kinematics in the same breath?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why on earth not? Newton's first law, which *defines* the class of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inertial frames in Newtonian mechanics, is purely kinematic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (dynamics
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't enter the picture until the second law), so inertial frames
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been mentioned in the same sentence as kinematics for quite a long
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Newton's first law depends upon Newton's definition of absolute
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; space.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, although Newton believed in the notion, it is not necessary, as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; numerous writers on classical mechanics have taken pains to point out;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see, for example, Vladimir Arnol'd's _Mathematical methods of classical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mechanics_, page 5, where the universe is defined as a four-dimensional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; affine space with a real-valued absolute time mapping defined on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; associated vector space of displacements. On page 6, Arnol'd
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; explicitly &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; notes that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [long snip]

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm not surprised that you snipped the quotation from Arnol'd
&gt;&gt;&gt; demonstrating that there is no necessity for the existence of an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;absolute space,&quot; as you claimed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are again confusing kinematics with dynamics.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You can make all the assertions you like; thus far, however, I am the
&gt;&gt;&gt; one who furnished both the definition and the quotations.

&gt;&gt; I showed your mistakes. You can hide from them. That is your problem,
&gt;&gt; not mine.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can define
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything you like in kinematics. Restrict yourself to what EINSTEIN
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mistakenly called kinematics.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have already done so, in the parts of my post that you snipped,
&gt;&gt;&gt; without any signs of comprehension on your part thus far.

&gt;&gt; You have not shown any failure to comprehend on my part. You tried to
&gt;&gt; form an argument that because someone else discussed kinematics,
&gt;&gt; Einstein discussed kinematics, after I had already shown you that
&gt;&gt; Einstein had not. Someone else's discussion of kinematics does not
&gt;&gt; prove that Einstein discussed kinematics. I asked you repeatedely to
&gt;&gt; back your assertions based upon what EINSTEIN wrote and you repeatedly
&gt;&gt; failed to do so.

&gt; Well, there is certainly a staggering quantity of distinguished
&gt; physicists whose books contains chapters entitled &quot;Relativistic
&gt; kinematics&quot; and the like. All they *all* wrong?

If they are right, you are unable to defend them, other than to invoke
their names. Of course, you may have misunderstood what they wrote. I
am not arguing with them, but with you, and you really try to avoid
talking about what EINSTEIN wrote.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If you indeed
&gt;&gt;&gt; think that Einstein did not understand kinematics and used the term
&gt;&gt;&gt; mistakenly, then you are forced to conclude also that:

&gt;&gt;&gt; ? Weidner does not understand kinematics,

&gt;&gt;&gt; ? Sells does not understand kinematics,

&gt;&gt;&gt; ? Rindler does not understand kinematics,

&gt;&gt;&gt; ? Pais does not understand kinematics,

&gt;&gt;&gt; ? Griffiths does not understand kinematics,

&gt;&gt;&gt; ? Török does not understand kinematics,

&gt;&gt;&gt; ? Marion does not understand kinematics,

&gt;&gt;&gt; ? Thornton does not understand kinematics,

&gt;&gt;&gt; etc., etc. It could be that your continued inability to furnish even a
&gt;&gt;&gt; *single* quotation supporting your viewpoint arises from the fact that
&gt;&gt;&gt; you are the *only* person on the planet who understands kinematics, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; that possibility seems to me rather unlikely.

&gt;&gt; That is again a personal attack by you.

&gt; No, it is merely an observation, and a correct one -- I have produced
&gt; plenty of quotations from experts substantiating what I have said; you
&gt; have produced none.

It was a personal attack. You produced no argument. Instead you
attacked me as a person. I am able to form my own arguments. You
apparently cannot form your own arguments, but feel compelled to rely
on authority. That is your weakness. It does not make me wrong.

&gt;&gt; Try an effective argument,
&gt;&gt; instead. It would be much more convincing then simply asserting you
&gt;&gt; understand what they wrote and it contradicts what I have said.

&gt; What is it about a chapter entitled &quot;Relativistic *kinematics* that
&gt; leads you to believe that the chapter does not deal with relativistic
&gt; kinematics?

If you are talking about EINSTEIN'S chapter, I have already repeatedly
stated and shown the reasons. If you are not talking about EINSTEIN'S
chapter, you are off topic.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We have no abstract space to play with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in physics. We have to map space with MASSES

&gt;&gt;&gt; You appear to be laboring under another misapprehension. Kinematics
&gt;&gt;&gt; does not *preclude* the existence of masses or forces in the discussion;
&gt;&gt;&gt; it merely deals that those *universal* aspects of motion in which the
&gt;&gt;&gt; value of the mass and the nature of the force are irrelevant.

&gt;&gt; I have shown you again and again that the inertia of the masses in
&gt;&gt; Einstein's arguments and the dynamics of his clocks, light signals,
&gt;&gt; measuring rods, etc. are key to his theory. You have not addressed
&gt;&gt; that fact.&gt;
&gt; I have done so repeatedly, and for the last time.

You have never done so. You do not understand that an inertial system
is not an arbitrary coordinate system. It is a dynamic state in which
masses are not subjected to a NET FORCE. This state can be mapped with
a potentially infinite number of different coordinate systems, but no
coordinate system defines a system as inertial, per se. An inertial
system is defined dynamically.

&gt;&gt;&gt; For the
&gt;&gt;&gt; kinematic foundations of special relativity, it *does not matter* what
&gt;&gt;&gt; the mass of the observer is, what the mass of his or her clock is, what
&gt;&gt;&gt; the mass of his or her meter stick is, etc.

&gt;&gt; Of course it matters, because cannot claim they are inertial without
&gt;&gt; addressing their nature as masses. You cannot just say they move
&gt;&gt; relative to each other uniformly and rectilinearly.

&gt; Inertial frames are merely coordinate systems.

You do not understand that an inertial system is not an arbitrary
coordinate system. It is a dynamic state in which masses are not
subjected to a NET FORCE. This state can be mapped with a potentially
infinite number of different coordinate systems, but no coordinate
system defines a system as inertial, per se. An inertial system is
defined dynamically. It is certainly not MERELY a coordinate system.
Your statement demonstrates that you have no comprehension of what
constitutes an inertial system.

&gt;&gt; You must address
&gt;&gt; their inertia. Light propagation is dynamic. Rods are dynamic. Clocks
&gt;&gt; are dynamic.&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in motion in order to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; able to comprehend it as INERTIAL.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't need lectures in kinematics.

&gt;&gt;&gt; On the contrary, you would evidently benefit a great deal from them.

&gt;&gt; Another unsupported personal attack by you.

&gt; No, merely a suggestion, from which you plainly will not profit.

No, it was a personal attack in lieu of an argument.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would much prefer you restrict
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your responses to Einstein's assertions of what constitutes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kinematics. The rest of what you wrote, as far as I had time to read,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, I see -- you didn't even read what I wrote, let alone the
&gt;&gt;&gt; references I both quoted and cited. That explains a good deal.

&gt;&gt; Another unsupported assertion by you.

&gt; Huh?! You just wrote yourself &quot;The rest of what you wrote, *as far
&gt; as I had time to read....*&quot; [emphasis added].

What did that explain? You made an unsupported assertion, which you
have not yet demonstrated. Try addressing what EINSTEIN wrote.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is irrelevant for the reasons just stated. Please address Poincare's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clock synch procedure as reiterated by Einstein and misnamed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;kinematics&quot;, and explain how it is done without observers, clocks,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accelerometers, etc., or concede that it is dynamics.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not done without clocks, meter sticks, etc., but (1) the clocks &gt;&gt;&gt; and meter sticks are idealizations of physical instruments, and (2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; their masses are utterly irrelevant.

&gt;&gt; David has again gotten personal and insulting and then denies that he
&gt;&gt; has done so. I cannot take him seriously, but am forced to view him as
&gt;&gt; an obnoxious crank. The issue is what EINSTEIN wrote, which was
&gt;&gt; plagiarized from Poincare. David claims a new &quot;kinematics&quot; based on
&gt;&gt; the DYNAMICS of inertial motion and the DYNAMICS of light
&gt;&gt; propagations, but he refuses to see the contradictions of his
&gt;&gt; arguments. Here is the quote from the 1905 paper On the
&gt;&gt; ElectroDYNAMICS of Moving BODIES (note that there is no &quot;space-time&quot;
&gt;&gt; involved in this &quot;new&quot;&quot;kinematics&quot;. Space-time in the theory of
&gt;&gt; relativity was another of Poincare's ideas):

&gt;&gt; I. KINEMATICAL PART
&gt;&gt; § 1. Definition of Simultaneity
&gt;&gt; Let us take a system of co-ordinates in which the equations of
&gt;&gt; Newtonian mechanics hold good. In order to render our presentation
&gt;&gt; more precise and to distinguish this system of co-ordinates verbally
&gt;&gt; from others which will be introduced hereafter, we call it the
&gt;&gt;&quot;stationary system.&quot;
&gt;&gt; If a material point is at rest relatively to this system of
&gt;&gt; co-ordinates, its position can be defined relatively thereto by the
&gt;&gt; employment of rigid standards of measurement and the methods of
&gt;&gt; Euclidean geometry, and can be expressed in Cartesian co-ordinates.&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If we wish to describe the motion of a material point, we give the
&gt;&gt; values of its co-ordinates as functions of the time. Now we must bear
&gt;&gt; carefully in mind that a mathematical description of this kind has no
&gt;&gt; physical meaning unless we are quite clear as to what we understand by
&gt;&gt;&quot;time.&quot; We have to take into account that all our judgments in which
&gt;&gt; time plays a part are always judgments of simultaneous events. If, for
&gt;&gt; instance, I say, &quot;That train arrives here at 7 o'clock,'' I mean
&gt;&gt; something like this: &quot;The pointing of the small hand of my watch to 7
&gt;&gt; and the arrival of the train are simultaneous events.&quot;

&gt;&gt; It might appear possible to overcome all the difficulties attending
&gt;&gt; the definition of &quot;time&quot; by substituting &quot;the position of the small
&gt;&gt; hand of my watch&quot; for &quot;time.&quot; And in fact such a definition is
&gt;&gt; satisfactory when we are concerned with defining a time exclusively
&gt;&gt; for the place where the watch is located; but it is no longer
&gt;&gt; satisfactory when we have to connect in time series of events
&gt;&gt; occurring at different places, or--what comes to the same thing--to
&gt;&gt; evaluate the times of events occurring at places remote from the
&gt;&gt; watch.

&gt;&gt; We might, of course, content ourselves with time values determined by
&gt;&gt; an observer stationed together with the watch at the origin of the
&gt;&gt; co-ordinates, and co-ordinating the corresponding positions of the
&gt;&gt; hands with light signals, given out by every event to be timed, and
&gt;&gt; reaching him through empty space. But this co-ordination has the
&gt;&gt; disadvantage that it is not independent of the standpoint of the
&gt;&gt; observer with the watch or clock, as we know from experience. We
&gt;&gt; arrive at a much more practical determination along the following line
&gt;&gt; of thought.

&gt;&gt; If at the point A of space there is a clock, an observer at A can
&gt;&gt; determine the time values of events in the immediate proximity of A by&gt;&gt; finding the positions of the hands which are simultaneous with these
&gt;&gt; events. If there is at the point B of space another clock in all
&gt;&gt; respects resembling the one at A, it is possible for an observer at B
&gt;&gt; to determine the time values of events in the immediate neighbourhood
&gt;&gt; of B. But it is not possible without further assumption to compare, in
&gt;&gt; respect of time, an event at A with an event at B. We have so far
&gt;&gt; defined only an &quot;A time&quot; and a &quot;B time.&quot; We have not defined a common
&gt;&gt;&quot;time&quot; for A and B, for the latter cannot be defined at all unless we
&gt;&gt; establish by definition that the &quot;time&quot; required by light to travel
&gt;&gt; from A to B equals the &quot;time&quot; it requires to travel from B to A. Let a
&gt;&gt; ray of light start at the &quot;A time&quot; from A towards B, let it at the &quot;B
&gt;&gt; time&quot; be reflected at B in the direction of A, and arrive again at A
&gt;&gt; at the &quot;A time&quot; .

&gt;&gt; In accordance with definition the two clocks synchronize if

&gt;&gt; t_B - t_A = t'_A - t_B.

&gt;&gt; We assume that this definition of synchronism is free from
&gt;&gt; contradictions, and possible for any number of points; and that the
&gt;&gt; following relations are universally valid:--

&gt;&gt; 2. If the clock at A synchronizes with the clock at B and also with
&gt;&gt; the clock at C, the clocks at B and C also synchronize with each
&gt;&gt; other.
&gt;&gt; Thus with the help of certain imaginary physical experiments we have
&gt;&gt; settled what is to be understood by synchronous stationary clocks
&gt;&gt; located at different places, and have evidently obtained a definition
&gt;&gt; of &quot;simultaneous,&quot; or &quot;synchronous,&quot; and of &quot;time.&quot; The &quot;time&quot; of an
&gt;&gt; event is that which is given simultaneously with the event by a
&gt;&gt; stationary clock located at the place of the event, this clock being
&gt;&gt; synchronous, and indeed synchronous for all time determinations, with
&gt;&gt; a specified stationary clock.&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In agreement with experience we further assume the quantity

&gt;&gt; (2AB) / (t'_A - t_A) = c,

&gt;&gt; to be a universal constant--the velocity of light in empty space.

&gt;&gt; It is essential to have time defined by means of stationary clocks in
&gt;&gt; the stationary system, and the time now defined being appropriate to
&gt;&gt; the stationary system we call it &quot;the time of the stationary system.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Notice the DYNAMICS of Newtonian MECHANICS, the motion of a MATERIAL
&gt;&gt; point, light signals, observers, etc. It is a repetition of Poincare's
&gt;&gt; work, was not new, is not kinematics, and does not address space-time,
&gt;&gt; another of Poincare's ideas. I again observe that David has not
&gt;&gt; demonstrated that Poincare's theory was unsuccessful, only that it was
&gt;&gt; more physically oriented and comprehensive than Einstein's. I again
&gt;&gt; observe that in order for a space to be inertial, a mass subject to no
&gt;&gt; NET FORCE must rest or move uniformly in a rectilinear line relative
&gt;&gt; to that space, because inertial motion is a DYNAMIC entity, and
&gt;&gt; abstract spaces do not tell us how masses move in these arbitrary
&gt;&gt; images, but dynamics does, through observation of moving masses.
&gt;&gt; Nowhere in the known universe do we masses [sic] subject to no forces.
&gt;&gt; Kinematics cannot define inertial motion.

&gt; No, the number of misconceptions in this paragraph is staggering.
&gt; First, Poincaré's theory was unsuccessful, as I already said, because
&gt; among other things he postulated the existence of an unexplained
&gt;&quot;special force&quot; deforming a supposedly elastic electron, an _ad hoc_
&gt; construct not required in Einstein's formulation. Second, as I have &gt; already said several times, there is no such thing as an &quot;inertial
&gt; space&quot;; there are only inertial *reference frames*, but these are merely
&gt; the bases of a vector space, a *mathematical* notion, and make sense in
&gt; a spacetime devoid of masses.

Space-time is an absolute space, as is well known. In order to define
a region of space-time as inertial, you must tacitly or explicitly
acknowledge the dynamical state as exhibiting no NET FORCE. EINSTEIN
did not discuss space-time, let alone the physically contradicted
delusion of &quot;spacetime devoid of masses.&quot; You are again off topic and
are confusing metaphysical fantasies with physics. An inertial system
is a physical concept depending upon masses in a space in which the
masses are in a physical state of not being subject to a NET FORCE.
Where you have observers, you have masses. In order to know that they
are in an inertial space, you must conduct DYNAMIC tests with
accelerometers. EINSTEIN uses physical light signals, and physical
measuring rods and physical clocks, which he accelerates with force. I
notice again that you do not address what EINSTEIN wrote, nor do you
realize that the inertial state is a dynamic state, and an inertial
system is an expression of that dynamic state.

&gt; You are confusing the adjective
&gt;&quot;inertial&quot; used in discussing such a reference with frame with the
&gt; inertia of a massive body.

I am not confusing anything, rather I am arguing with your false
definitions of an inertial system. Inertial is a physical state in
which masses are subject to no NET FORCE. The universe contains
masses. EINSTEIN writes about the universe, not an abstract absolute
spacetime devoid of masses.

&gt; Third, the only aspect of motion pertinent
&gt; to Einstein's key second postulate is the velocity of light, a purely
&gt; kinematic notion.

Physics is about the physical. EINSTEIN repeatedly defines the second
postulate as being empirically based. He uses dynamic light signals to
map space. The postulate of the velocity of LIGHT is not purely
kinematic. It is dynamically based and EINSTEIN employs it as a
dynamic measuring tool, along with the dynamic measuring tools of rods
and clocks. You seem not to realize that the space, or spacetime, does
not exist UNTIL IT IS MAPPED with dynamic light signals, measuring
rods and light signals. You cannot just pretend that spacetime exists
and is inertial. You must give a physical definition of how to create
it. THAT is EINSTEIN'S whole point. EINSTEIN uses dynamics to measure
and map spaces and times. You use metaphysical absolutism to pretend a
world which you know to be physically contradicted, and you tacitly
presuppose those dynamic states, and assert that since they are
tacitly supposed, they do not exist.

Explain to us the mutual exclusion between plagiarized and wrong.
Given your stupidity, many things must be difficult for you to fathom,
especially those you make up of whole cloth.

The letter exists. Hilbert's paper, dated November 20, 1915, exists.
Einstein's paper, dated November 25, 1915, exists. Stachel has proudly
stated that the majority view among physicists and historians was that
Hilbert anticipated Einstein. Those are the facts. Einstein's actions,
while unethical and foolish, were not the only time he behaved that
way. Pais could not explain why Einstein published two papers
repeating the Kaluza-Klein theory, which Einstein knew. You can find
the story in Subtle is the Lord... page 333.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stachel points out quite plainly a few of the book's glaring
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shortcomings, among them the following:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Apparently, it does not bother Bjerknes that the various opponents

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, the notion that Einstein's discoveries are both wrong *and*
&gt;&gt;&gt; plagiarized seems pretty self-evidently indefensible to me, but perhaps
&gt;&gt;&gt; such incongruities don't trouble you, so I won't bother to argue.

&gt;&gt; You are irrational, David. There is no mutual exclusion in a theory
&gt;&gt; being both plagiarized and incorrect, no more [sic] than there is a mutual
&gt;&gt; exclusion in theory being both plagiarized and correct. What makes it

&gt; I did not say that it was *impossible* -- but if Einstein's theories
&gt; are indeed *incorrect*, then why the enormous fuss about who deserves
&gt; credit for priority?!

Well, actually, you did say it was impossible, or, &quot;pretty
self-evidently indefensible&quot; and you claimed an &quot;incongruity&quot; between
plagiarized and wrong, which does not exist, and which would make it
impossible for both to be true.

&gt;Who cares about priority for an incorrect
&gt; theory?! Certainly no working scientist whom I have ever encountered in
&gt; my professional life.

History compel us to tell the truth. Most people care about the truth.
You must not travel in those circles.

&gt;&gt; Apparently,
&gt;&gt; you are stupid, as well as ignorant, David.

&gt; Fine; suit yourself. As far as I am concerned, then, this discussion
&gt; is at an end; surely you have little interest in trying to persuade the
&gt; stupid and the ignorant.

&gt; [...]

Now, that is true! I have no pretensions that I can persuade someone
like you with the facts. As for priorities and fallacies, it is only
proper that we should examine the past to see what led to the theory
of relativity, and if and where errors were made in the evolution of
the theory. That is the historico-critical method. To do it properly,
the truth must be told.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I was quite serious when I said
&gt;&gt;&gt; that one wonders where on earth Elizabeth imbibes such claptrap.

&gt;&gt; At a small but distinguished liberal arts college.

&gt; One is inclined to doubt that you were taught there that Einstein
&gt;&quot;plagerized&quot;&quot;equasions,&quot; or that the geometry of Minkowski space is
&gt; hyperbolic. Where on earth *were* you educated? On second thought,
&gt; don't answer that -- it's best not to embarrass what may well be a
&gt; perfectly respectable institution.

&gt;&gt;&gt; She
&gt;&gt;&gt; demonstrably has not even read, let alone understood, the few putative
&gt;&gt;&gt; sources that she cites.

&gt;&gt; Here is where you get yourself into trouble Webb, because
&gt;&gt; you have made an assertion you can't support.

&gt;&gt; I have, in fact, read what I've cited and it is you who got caught
&gt;&gt; reading the index but not the body of Akrigg's biography.

&gt; No, I produced the quotation from Akrigg's book that directly refuted
&gt; what you claimed; I will reproduce it below from the Google archive.

&gt;&gt; I have not read Akrigg's work on Southampton,

&gt; That is quite plain.

&gt;&gt; I cited a
&gt;&gt; review article (archived) on Akrigg's now out-of-print book
&gt;&gt; in a post.

&gt;&gt; I'm reading Akrigg's work on the Court of James I.

&gt;&gt; You, in turn, have written

&gt;&gt; 41 posts

&gt;&gt; on my remark about--not even a reference to or a citation of--
&gt;&gt; a bibliography I saw in passing.

&gt; Your revisionist newsgroup history would be amusing were it not
&gt; suggestive of severe amnesia on your part. Here are your exact words,
&gt; with Google archive URLs:

&gt; Elizabeth:

&gt;&quot;Southampton was overly fond of drag and used to hang about the
&gt; theatres hoping to play female roles. He was given a few parts
&gt; and was apparently very convincing as a girl.&quot;

&gt; [Here I cannot resist quotion Tom Lay's followup:

&gt;&quot;I've mostly been skipping over Weir's posts lately, but I do hate
&gt; to have missed this little gem. Thanks for pointing it out.&quot;]

&gt; Elizabeth's rejoinder:

&gt;&quot;It's in the record

&gt; [*WHAT* &quot;record&quot;? Elizabeth never gets more specific than that.]

&gt; that Southampton acted in theatrical productions,
&gt; probably at Court instead of the public theatres. He is supposed
&gt; to have taken a female role in MSND which was played for his mother's
&gt; wedding according to some Strat scholars. [...]

&gt;&quot;Here are some academic pages that point to the fact that Wriothesley
&gt; was gay....&quot; [...]

&gt; [Of course, I did *not* ask for evidence that Southampton was gay --
&gt; rather, I asked for evidence of his supposed cross dressing (which is
&gt; another matter entirely -- many gay men are not transvestites, and some
&gt; cross dressers are not gay). I also sought evidence that he used to
&gt; hang around the theatres hoping to play female roles, that he was given
&gt; a few such roles, and that he was quite convincing in them, as you
&gt; claimed. You *still* have furnished no such evidence, and you probably
&gt; never will, leading the reader to suspect that the whole charming
&gt; fantasy was pure invention.]

&gt;&quot;Here's a site on gender studies where a bibliography of
&gt; transexualism features a book on Southampton.

&gt; http://faculty.washington.edu/alvin/gaycat.htm&quot;

&gt; [Here the reader can simply visit the URL in question and check that the
&gt; *ONLY* reference to Akrigg therein is the following bibliography entry:

&gt; Akrigg, G. P. V.
&gt; Shakespeare and the Earl of Southampton.
&gt; London: H. Hamilton, 1968.
&gt; Suz, Ugl DA 391.1 .S8 A65

&gt; I had read Akrigg, and I knew perfectly well that he did not assert that
&gt; Southampton was gay, let alone that he was a transvestite theatrical
&gt; habitué seeking and appearing in female roles; as we shall see below,
&gt; Elizabeth had not read the book at all.]

&gt; 8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;selm=efbc3534.0205171839.919dd88%40posting.google.com&amp;rnum=13&gt;

&gt; My followup:

&gt;&quot;The only reference I see to Southampton is to Akrigg's _Shakespeare
&gt; and the Earl of Southampton_; is that *really* the book you had in
&gt; mind? If so, where does Akrigg opine that Southamtpon was &quot;overly
&gt; fond of drag,&quot; that he used to &quot;hang about the theatres hoping to
&gt; play female roles,&quot; or that he was &quot;very convincing as a girl&quot;?
&gt; Or did you just make that up?:

&gt; Elizabeth's rejoinder:

&gt;&quot;Why else would a site on queer studies have a book on Southampton
&gt; listed in the biography [sic]?&quot;

&gt;&lt;http://groups.google.com/groups?q=g:thl2035743231d&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-
&gt; 8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;selm=efbc3534.0205181712.da0ae81%40posting.google.com&amp;rnum=15&gt;

&gt; My followup:

&gt;&quot;Ah -- I see that you *haven't* read Akrigg. Rather, you infer --
&gt; from its mere presence in a bibliography(!) -- that the book asserts
&gt; that Southampton was 'overly fond of drag,' that he used to 'hang
&gt; about the theatres hoping to play female roles,' or that he was
&gt; 'very convincing as a girl'! Astounding -- you infer the detailed
&gt; content of a book that you have *not even read*, solely from its
&gt; appearance in someone's bibliography!!&quot;

&gt; In fact, the book by Akrigg in question contains the following damning
&gt; passage, which I reproduced in a new thread:

&gt; From my post:

&gt;&quot;After summarizing the evidence underlying speculations concerning
&gt; Southampton's sexuality, Akrigg writes:

&gt; 'It all adds up to one thing: nothing would be less surprising
&gt; than to learn that during certain periods of his early life
&gt; Southampton passed through homosexual phases but, until better
&gt; evidence is found, only a fool will declare that he did.'

&gt; One need scarcely add that only one with even *less* sound judgment
&gt; than a fool would attempt to infer the content of a book she had
&gt; never read from its mere appearance in someone's bibliography!&quot;

&gt;&gt; Not much in the way of a citation but it was at least proportional
&gt;&gt; to the non-issue of Southampton's cross-dressing, a subject
&gt;&gt; which seems to interest you far more than it does me.

&gt; No, I've never been particularly interested in Southampton's cross
&gt; dressing or sexual orientation; it was you wrote

&gt;&quot;Southampton was overly fond of drag and used to hang about the
&gt; theatres hoping to play female roles. He was given a few parts
&gt; and was apparently very convincing as a girl.&quot;

&gt; I am merely interested in the question of whether there exists any
&gt; credible *evidence* for such a detailed, outlandish assertion. Plainly,
&gt; if any such evidence exists, it is utterly unknown to you.

&gt; [...]

&gt;&gt; So it is you, Webb, who claims to have read works whose index
&gt;&gt; you have checked instead.

&gt; No, the quotation I posted came *directly from the text* of Akrigg's
&gt; book, not from the index. Evidently you don't know what an index is
&gt; either if you think that an index is likely to contain text like

&gt;&quot;It all adds up to one thing: nothing would be less surprising
&gt; than to learn that during certain periods of his early life
&gt; Southampton passed through homosexual phases but, until better
&gt; evidence is found, only a fool will declare that he did.&quot;

&gt; I cannot imagine *why* you repeatedly post your risible revisionist
&gt; newsgroup history when anyone can check the Google archives and confirm
&gt; that your history is either invented or hallucinated. But perhaps you
&gt; believe -- wrongly, as it turns out -- that everyone is as inept in the
&gt; use of search engines as you are.

Why don't you answer his question and maybe he'll stop asking it? After all,
you are the only one with the knowledge about where you got the claim,
Southampton was overly fond of drag and used to hang about the theatres

In my experience, people who feel secure in their own case do not write this
sort of thing, and being secure, are able to hear other's ideas with
equanimity.

On usenet the three common defamations are (1) other's drug use, (2) a
mental illness or reduced intellection commentary, and (3) general
denigrations of the correspondent's personhood instead of their ideas!

I don't know particularly about Southampton's underwear preferences, but
perhaps &quot;Tom Reedy&quot; here can prove conclusively once and for all where
Southampton bought his knickers? After, is it now 54 posts (?), perhaps all
protest too much?

However I did write some possible stem-words for 'shake-scene' from A.Sax
which seem likely contributing components; after all, such a person would
have a name or some tag for their activity, no? If this inquiry were
sincere, why not contest the matter of it if it seems false, or the inquirer
had other information...?

The way to interogate someone's proposition, if they have presented no
evidential material, is to question their method - even satirically, but
certainly! For writer to _only_ say 'Nonsense!' is not in itself a method of
inquiry, nor does it establish anything. It is a refusal to look. That two
academics (?) in this newsgroup have adopted this practice is nothing to
recommend it.

&gt;&gt; 'shake-scene' was Elizabethan theatre slang for the factotum who toted

&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt; and many others. It is a pity that you would not recognize a jest

&gt; How could I take it as a 'jest' from someone as negative and
&gt; bitter as you, Webb. I'm sorry that I mentioned the slang because
&gt; I don't want to offend Lynne but since Lynne doesn't participate in
&gt; this thread I though you were making a joke about her, not to her.

I have come in on the middle of this. I'm not sure what David said,
Elizabeth, but my nickname is indeed Mouse, and that is also the name
of the protagonist in my next novel. I thank you, however, for
speaking up on my behalf.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; if it
&gt;&gt; bit you;

&gt; You bite but your jests only grate.

&gt;&gt; indeed,

&gt; Here we go again (big heaving sigh).

&gt;&gt; your total incapacity for recognizing humor might have
&gt;&gt; saved you the trouble of excoriating my supposed Marxism when I
&gt;&gt; expressed qualified approval of an utterance of Groucho -- not Karl --
&gt;&gt; Marx. (Of course, your repetition of the *same* stupidity leads me to
&gt;&gt; doubt seriously whether you can even distinguish between the two.)

&gt; I'm laughing. Are you or have you ever been a member of
&gt; the Young Socialists For Whatever The Rest of It Is? You're
&gt; a generic ideologue, Webb. Groucho Marxism would be the
&gt; last thing you'd join.

&gt;&gt; It is also a great pity that you evidently do not read Lynne's posts
&gt;&gt; -- you could learn a great deal from her.

&gt; As could you.

&gt;&gt; She is often charmingly
&gt;&gt; witty,

&gt;&gt; she has an amusing sense of humor,

&gt; Yes, she has.

&gt;&gt; and she has never (as far as I &gt; know) made vile accusations
&gt; of intellectual dishonesty, racism, sexism,
&gt;&gt; etc., let alone *unsupportable* accusations of that nature,
&gt;&gt; as you so frequently do.

&gt; So far you haven't given Lynne cause.

"/>

I try never to make such accusations, and I would certainly not make
them against either of you, as I consider you both friendly
acquaintances.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Finally, when Lynne is caught out in a mistake, she
&gt;&gt; gracefully acknowledges the error, and thanks those who drew attention
&gt;&gt; to her lapse for the correction.

&gt; (NOTE: Here's where Webb transitions from politiking to
&gt; propagandizing and I'm sure if Lynne were to read this
&gt; she would instantly see that Webb's has made her into a
&gt; stick to beat me over the head with--I hope she does
&gt; see it)..

"/>

I see the thread now, or at least this part of it, as I have ten
minutes until the next round of socialising with my mum's friends
(sigh), and I would ask you both not to argue over me or anything I've
done or said or anything that's been said about me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; She does not distort grotesquely what
&gt;&gt; others have said

snip.

Thank you for championing me, Elizabeth, and for being kind about me,
David. I'd just like to say that I've now met several hlas
participants of different stripes, and all those I've met are
absolutely charming people whom I'd like to consider my friends. As I
consider both of you friends too, at least in a virtual way--even
though you, David, are a Marxist &lt;g&gt;--it troubles me that something
has happened which has caused you to argue over me.

Best wishes to you both.

While I hesitate to agree with Tom Reedy AGAIN so soon,
I *finally* managed to locate the thread that is the subject
of the &quot;discourse&quot; between Elizabeth and David.

http:groups.google.com/groups?dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;threadm=efbc3534.02051 81712.da0a ... @posting.google.com&amp;rnum15

(I hope I got that right)

It appears that Elizabeth's response to a request for citation to
her source material for her &quot;cross dressing&quot; reference was
off-hand at best, to the extent that I would agree that she
failed to state her sources to the extent that they could be checked.
The fact that others have also failed to do the same is neither
an excuse nor a reason to follow their example, and implies that
she doesn't take her own position on the authorship question
seriously.
(I'm fairly sure that there are posters who find the entire subject
a source of amusement rather than scholarship).

Her response that, &quot;Why else would a site on queer studies have
a book on Southampton listed in the bibliography,&quot; doesn't qualify
as an &quot;inference&quot; about anything, and the reference to &quot;queer&quot;
in reference to the site was sarcastic at best and disrespectful
to persons not involved in the conversation at worst.

Her response to Tom Lay that, &quot;You wouldn't know a fact if it
flew up your nose,&quot; indicates that she is happy to dish it out,
so she shouldn't object to having it returned in kind.

I must say, I'm disappointed, but perhaps if she refrains from
such commentary, she might receive less of it in return in the future.
(but I wouldn't bet on that at this point)

Cordelialy,

Christine

P.S. I have posted a response to the &quot;hogfish&quot; reference
that I hope is a sufficiently pointed &quot;backatcha&quot;
without endangering my Judith Martin seal of approval. ;-)

&gt; I wasn't taught there how to deal with the mania of obsessive

&gt; There are thousands of hits for 'Minkowski hyerbolic geometry,' most

As I have taken pains to explain to you before, the so-called
Minkowski model of hyperbolic space is *not* Minkowski space -- rather,
it is a certain spacelike hypersurface in Minkowski space, a two-sheeted
hyperboloid given as a level set of a certain quadratic form. Minkowski
space itself has an *indefinite* metric tensor (the Minkowski or Lorentz
metric) of *zero curvature* (i.e., *flat*), while the induced metric on
the hyperboloid in question is *positive definite* (hence Riemannian)
and has *constant negative curvature* (i.e., is *nonflat*). The
assertion that the geometry of Minkowski space is hyperbolic is simply
false: only a certain *subspace* of Minkowski space -- the hyperboloid
to which I alluded above -- has a hyperbolic metric.

You can find a succinct explanation at

&lt;&gt;:

&quot;You asked me to speak to Minkowski. Minkowski's geometry, although
it has hyperbolas and hyperbolic trig functions in it, is not
Lobatchevskian. The term for it is 'Pseudo-Euclidean' or
'Lorentzian'.&quot; [&quot;Lobachevskian geometry&quot; is synonymous with
&quot;hyperbolic geometry.&quot;]

Another explanation can be found at

&lt;&gt;,

where you will find that the (2-dimensional) Minkowski model is the
hyperboloid given by

-x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1,

as a subspace of the (3-dimensional) Minkowski space with the Minkowski
metric tensor

-dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2.

Finally, I realize that you eschew books in favor of web sites (the less
reliable the better), but you can find the Minkowski model (also known
as the hyperboloid model) explained on page 12, as well as at great
length in chapter 3, in John Ratcliffe's beautiful monograph
_Foundations of hyperbolic manifolds_.

But I explained all this to you at even greater length before;
indeed, you can find the full explanation at

&lt;&gt;;

below I merely reproduce the pertinent extract:
-------------------------------------------------
I have already mentioned the Minkowski model
of hyperbolic space as the most probable source for Weir's ridiculous
misconception that Minkowski space is hyperbolic geometry. Indeed,
when Weir earlier wrote &quot;Minkowski's spacetime is hyperbolic geometry,&quot;
I explained:

&quot;For the fifth time, the Minkowski spacetime of Special Relativity
is *NOT* &quot; hyperbolic geometry&quot;: Minkowksi space has an *indefinite*
(semi-Riemannian) metric tensor, while hyperbolic geometry has a
*definite* (Riemannian) metric tensor; moreover, the Minkowski
spacetime of Special Relativity is *flat*, i.e., *not curved at
all*, while the hyperbolic metric has constant curvature -1....
I have *no idea* where you got the absurd notion that a flat,
indefinite space is &quot;hyperbolic &quot;; my best guess is that you are
confusing this issue with the fact that hyperbolic 2-space (the
&quot;Poincaré disk&quot;) can be isometrically embedded in Minkowski 3-space.&quot;

The well-known isometric embedding of hyperbolic 2-space into Minkowski
3-space mentioned in my last sentence above is *precisely* the
so-called Minkowski model of hyperbolic space whose definition Weir has
so completely misunderstood, exactly as I suspected.

However, the geometry on hyperbolic space inherited from this
enbedding is *NOT* Minkowski geometry. To furnish an analogy which
everyone (except Weir) should be able to understand, an ordinary
2-dimensional sphere embeds isometrically into ordinary Euclidean
3-space. Yet the geometry on the sphere inherited from its ambient
3-space is *NOT* Euclidean geometry. If Weir doubts this, she should
consider the geodesic triangle on the earth whose edges are the
Greenwich meridian (from the north pole to the equator), the 90-degree
longitude meridian (from pole to equator), and the segment of the
equator from the Greenwich meridian to the 90-degree longitude
meridian. This triangle has right angles at all three of its vertices,
yet the sum of the angles of any Euclidean triangle must add up to 180
degrees. Thus the geometry of the sphere is *not* Euclidean (since it
has a triangle whose angle sum exceeds 180 degrees), despite the fact
that the sphere is isometrically embedded in a flat Euclidean 3-space.
(Indeed, this example exhibits in rudimentary form the celebrated
Gauss-Bonnet theorem which relates curvature with the phenomon of
holonomy -- one is detecting the sphere's positive curvature.) In a
similar way, the Poincaré model of hyperbolic geometry embeds
isometrically into Minkowski 3-space, yet its geometry is emphatically
*not* that of its ambient Minkowski space; indeed, the hyperboloid with
the induced metric has a *definite* metric tensor of constant curvature
-1, while Minkowski space itself (the geometry of special relativity)
has an *indefinite*, *flat* metric tensor. [...]

In fact, hyperbolic geometry has been known since Gauss; Minkowski
geometry is a comparatively recent geometry, devised by Minkowski for
the pupose of &quot;geometrizing&quot; special relativity. Minkowski geometry is
*not* hyperbolic geometry, nor is it Euclidean (although it shares the
property of flatness with Euclidean geometry).

Such exquisite feeling for the alliterative mode in English! Lots of arrrr
sounds in there. Reminisent of the countryside and many a buccolic barnyard.
I particularly likes the You're + more + moron. You should try writing for a
living!

Anyway, lets kill two birds with one scene.

SKAKE-SCENE:-

It was Greene who wrote it. 'Trust them not&quot; he said to Nashe, Peele and
Marlowe. Sarcastic denunciation was the man's style, no doubt fueled by
envy, besides, he was dying, and not exactly a cheerful bloke anyway. He
puts Shakespeare down as less than an actor:-

There is an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that with
his 'Tiger's heart wrapt in a player's hide' supposes he is well
able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you; and being
an absolute /Johannes factotum,/ is in his own conceit the only
Shake-scene in a country.

Then he goes on to entreat their rare wits to be employed more profitably
[than..] continuing...
'and let those apes imitate your past excellence, and never more acquaint
them with your admired inventions.'

The Crow was Shakespeare, and 'tiger's heart' from Henry VI, as spoke by
Margaret.

So did this term, initially derogatory, become the anodyne description of
someone who merely shifted the furniture around on stage. I don't know, but
there is its source.

The rest is.....................

PS, I note below ## that you commit to newsgroup defamation #2 [mental
derrangement], to which I have just referred David Webb. Perhaps this is
considered witty or in place of method in your milieu?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; The way to interogate someone's proposition, if they have presented no
&gt;&gt; evidential material, is to question their method - even satirically, but
&gt;&gt; certainly! For writer to _only_ say 'Nonsense!' is not in itself a
method
&gt; of
&gt;&gt; inquiry, nor does it establish anything. It is a refusal to look. That
two

&gt; After
&gt;&gt;&gt; all,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you are the only one with the knowledge about where you got the
claim,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Southampton was overly fond of drag and used to hang about the

term
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'shake-scene' was Elizabethan theatre slang for the factotum who
toted
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scenery around between acts.&quot;

Your lack of a sense of humor evidently handicaps you in

&gt;&gt; In my experience, people who feel secure in their own case do not write this

&gt;&gt; I don't know particularly about Southampton's underwear preferences, but
&gt;&gt; perhaps &quot;Tom Reedy&quot; here can prove conclusively once and for all where
&gt;&gt; Southampton bought his knickers? After, is it now 54 posts (?), perhaps all
&gt;&gt; protest too much?

&gt;&gt; However I did write some possible stem-words for 'shake-scene' from A.Sax
&gt;&gt; which seem likely contributing components; after all, such a person would
&gt;&gt; have a name or some tag for their activity, no? If this inquiry were
&gt;&gt; sincere, why not contest the matter of it if it seems false, or the inquirer

&gt; While I hesitate to agree with Tom Reedy AGAIN so soon,
&gt; I *finally* managed to locate the thread that is the subject
&gt; of the &quot;discourse&quot; between Elizabeth and David.

&gt; http:groups.google.com/groups?dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;threadm=efbc3534.02051 81712.da0a ... @posting.google.com&amp;rnum15

&gt; (I hope I got that right)

&gt; It appears that Elizabeth's response to a request for citation to
&gt; her source material for her &quot;cross dressing&quot; reference was
&gt; off-hand at best, to the extent that I would agree that she
&gt; failed to state her sources to the extent that they could be checked.
&gt; The fact that others have also failed to do the same is neither
&gt; an excuse nor a reason to follow their example, and implies that
&gt; she doesn't take her own position on the authorship question
&gt; seriously.
&gt; (I'm fairly sure that there are posters who find the entire subject
&gt; a source of amusement rather than scholarship).

&gt; Her response that, &quot;Why else would a site on queer studies have
&gt; a book on Southampton listed in the bibliography,&quot; doesn't qualify
&gt; as an &quot;inference&quot; about anything, and the reference to &quot;queer&quot;
&gt; in reference to the site was sarcastic at best and disrespectful
&gt; to persons not involved in the conversation at worst.

&gt; Her response to Tom Lay that, &quot;You wouldn't know a fact if it
&gt; flew up your nose,&quot; indicates that she is happy to dish it out,
&gt; so she shouldn't object to having it returned in kind.

&gt; I must say, I'm disappointed, but perhaps if she refrains from
&gt; such commentary, she might receive less of it in return in the future.
&gt; (but I wouldn't bet on that at this point)

&gt; Cordelialy,

&gt; Christine

&gt; P.S. I have posted a response to the &quot;hogfish&quot; reference

&gt;&gt; THIS IS POST NUMBER 52.

&gt;&gt; IT IS TI M E TO STOP OBSESSING ABOUT

&gt;&gt; SOUTHAMPTON'S CROSS-DRESSSING.

&gt;&gt; LET IT GO.

&gt; Why don't you answer his question and maybe he'll stop asking it?

"/>

The answer, Reedy, is irrelevant. Webb is only interested
in the inquisition.

Webb likes to play the authoritarian so he keeps this tedious
game going by repeatedly denying that Southampton
was a cross-dresser--see pdf below--even though hundreds of
articles have been published on the discovery of a portrait thought
for 400 years to be of a young woman but discovered to be of
Southampton..

Southampton's identity as the 'young woman' has been verified
by top experts in Elizabethan portraiture.

The experts agree that Southampton is wearing drag.

I've posted at least fifty links to articles on the subject of
Southampton's cross-dressing portrait but Webb has chosen
to reject the evidence.

One of his excuses involved the fact that I used the word
'drag' and not the word 'camp.' As far as I know camp is
drag with an attitude but perhaps you can correct me,
Reedy.

This is hardly the first time I've posted this portrait:

From The Guardian:

In the portrait by an unknown artist, dating from the
early 1590s, the teenage Henry Wriothesley, third
Earl of Southampton, is wearing lipstick, rouge and
an elaborate double earring. His long hair hangs down
in very feminine tresses and his hand lies on his heart
in a somewhat camp gesture.

&lt;&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; After all,
&gt; you are the only one with the knowledge about where you got the
&gt; claim, Southampton was overly fond of drag and used to hang
&gt; about the theatres hoping to play female roles.&quot;

"/>

What Webb has failed to convey is that I said, conversationally,
that 'somewhere I read Southampton was fond of drag.'

Webb is trying to make it appear that I claimed that I had
an authoritative source but was unwilling to cite it. It was
just something I read while browsing online and I did not
attempt to conceal that fact.

Webb doesn't have a case because I didn't make any claims
that it was taken from an authoritative source.

Keeping in mind that this was not a formal post that required
citiations and in the spirit of fwiw, I also said that I had seen
Akrigg's book on Southampton's homosexuality on a Queer Studies
page and I candidly divulged to Webb that it was only a bibliography
citation.

I also read that Southampton played female roles, not
in the public theatres, of course, but in private playhouses.
There is no documented contemporaneous source but there
is a tradition that Southampton played a female role in MSND.

The point here, Reedy, is that I was in a *conversation* with
Webb.

I don't believe that remarks in passing made in an informal
exchange require citations.

Webb is inventing this extraordinary demand so he can
keep up the harassment on the pretense that he is only
'seeking the truth.'

I told him the truth, up front, in my first posts to him and
of course Webb knows this.

Here are the facts but this is not in the way of a formal argument
so you can take it or leave it:

1. Southampton and Essex were regulars at the public theatres
but Southampton was an aficionado so he had a private theatre
constructed at Southampton House.

It's in the record that Richard II was played at Southampton's private
theatre.

So we may conclude that the theatre groupie Southampton 'liked to
hang about the theatres.'

2. Webb also denies that Southampton was a homosexual but
Akrigg and others have printed an eyewitness account by
one of Southampton's officers that Southampton was having
sex with a 'favorite' in a tent in Ireland near the field of battle.
Southampton was the disasterous 'Master of the Horse' and
showered this 'favorite'--some man from the ranks--with
favors including a prize saddle horse, the latter gift causing
scandal because of its high price.
.
I couldn't find Akrigg's out-of-print biography of Southampton
although Webb was able to cross the quad to the library
and page through the index--but I stumbled onto the pertinent
quote taken from Akrigg's book in an old review from a journal
archived online.

And yes, I cited the review, not the book.

I am not responsible for Webb's inability to manage his anger
but I am really getting bored with his misrepresentation of
what I have stated and posted.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So if you're tired of hearing about it, answer the question.

"/>

Reedy. Webb doesn't want the answer.

Webb wants to hold on to the the question because making
authoritarian demands gets Webb excited.

Best regards,

Elizabeth

I would agree with that statement. Phil's latest threat to me, part of a

Well, if she did that, I can imagine how one would suspect her of
a certain loss of temper; perhaps her &quot;weak moment.&quot; But I can't
pretend to walk in her moccasins; maybe that is her way of

&gt;&gt; You're even more of a moron than she is, if that's possible.

&gt; I would agree with that statement. Phil's latest threat to me, part of a
&gt; string of them going back to 2001, is to contact a publisher to complain
&gt; about my fair-use quotation of copyrighted material in a newsgroup post.
&gt; That was several days ago; needless to say, nothing happened.

"/>

Who is threatening whom? Does Neil Brennen threaten other's copyright? What
an odd way to express himself; that he has become the victim!!

I am unsure if Neil Brennen wants me to agitate the e-publisher 'to
complain' about him, or to clarify publishing policy, which ostensibly does
claim copyright!

What is he taunting me about now? The strange thing about people who write
continuous ad hominem posts is that they assume that this might make them
slightly interesting (the only way?) even if it means cross-posting material
from a private yahoo discussion group to a Shakespearean newsgroup.

Mr. Breenen need not fear myself. However the famous woman chessplayer whose
name he mocks in his titles has recently declared herself unamused to the
extent of formally inviting a lawyer to examine abusive reporting and has
made this known publicly. It also is no direct concern of mine whether the
e-publisher will take offence. Indirectly I support publisher's copyrighted
material, and writers cannot earn an income if some sort of standard is not
maintained.

If Mr. Brennen wishes to continue these cross-postings in a provocative way,
what shall I do but become more active in the situation? Mr Brennen does
address copyright issues, he mocks me because apparently no-one has noticed
the breech.

I have cross-posted this material to the chess newsgroup from where it also
appeared, and to the yahoo group where it originated.

As I have noted before, Einstein's theory is not a &quot;kinematic theory&quot;
-- it has a dynamical component as well. Rather, Einstein's main
*innovation* lies in kinematics. Indeed, the dynamical equation itself
in special relativity is not new, as it takes *exactly* the same form as
the dynamical equation in Newtonian mechanics (the interpretation is
slightly different, as the vectors in question -- momentum, force, etc.
-- lie in Minkowski space rather than Euclidean space). And I have no
idea what you mean by an &quot;electrodynamic universe.&quot; Finally, Hsu did
not &quot;demote&quot; Einstein's theory; indeed, to refresh your memory,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Professor Hsu himself wrote:

"/>

&quot;You are absolutely correct in thinking that our work on Taiji
Relativity is not a repudiation of Einstein's work at all. As
you know, abundant experimental evidence exists showing the
utility of special relativity for predicting and explaining
physical phenomena.

&quot;'Taiji relativity' is a formulation of special relativity which
is operationally equivalent to writing the Lorentz transformations
using the same units for length and time (as done by Taylor and
Wheeler in Spacetime Physics)....&quot;

Huh?! Where is the supposed sexism? You are not the *only* woman

Alisa Beaton, Ann Carrigan, Geralyn Horton, Lynne Kositsky, Jo Lonergan,
Rita, and (recently) Christine Cooper, etc., and I have said as much in
many cases. Nor are you yourself the *only* person whom you have
accused me of harassing: indeed, if you will reflect for a moment, those
whom you have accused me of harassing include people like John Baker,
Paul Crowley, Art Neuendorffer, and Paul Streitz, all of whom, as I
trust that even you realize, are *not women*. Your *own accusations*

&gt; This is hardly the first time I've posted this portrait:

&gt; From The Guardian:

&gt; In the portrait by an unknown artist, dating from the
&gt; early 1590s, the teenage Henry Wriothesley, third
&gt; Earl of Southampton, is wearing lipstick, rouge and
&gt; an elaborate double earring. His long hair hangs down
&gt; in very feminine tresses and his hand lies on his heart
&gt; in a somewhat camp gesture.

&gt;&lt;http://www.observer.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,687778,00.html&gt;

"/>

As I noted at the time:
---------------------------------------
Huh? All this suggests is that Southampton's appearance was
androgynous or even feminine, which was never in dispute. Where does
it assert that Southampton was &quot;overly fond of drag&quot; (the term &quot;drag&quot;
is generally understood to mean full feminine *attire* worn by a man,
not merely the use of cosmetics or jewelry, practices that are not
gender exclusive), or that he used to &quot;hang about the theatres hoping
to play female roles&quot;? [...] Even if the portrait depicted
Southampton in a dress and carrying a purse, it certainly would not
constitute evidence that he used to &quot;hang about the theatres hoping to
play female roles.&quot;

And where does Akrigg, whose book you cited as &quot;evidence,&quot; say
anything about Southampton being &quot;overly fond of drag&quot; or hanging
around theatres &quot;hoping to play female roles&quot;? As I already noted,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Akrigg writes:

"/>

&quot;It all adds up to one thing: nothing would be less surprising
than to learn that during certain periods of his early life
Southampton passed through homosexual phases but, until better
evidence is found, only a fool will declare that he did.&quot;

One need scarcely add that only one with even *less* sound judgment
than a fool would attempt to infer the content of a book she had never
read from its mere appearance in someone's bibliography!

And what is the source for your assertion that &quot;shake-scene&quot; was
Elizabethan theater slang -- unless by &quot;Elizabethan&quot; you mean &quot;invented

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; After all,
&gt;&gt; you are the only one with the knowledge about where you got the

&gt; What Webb has failed to convey is that I said, conversationally,
&gt; that 'somewhere I read Southampton was fond of drag.'

"/>

No, you did not say &quot;somewhere I read Southampton was fond of drag,&quot;
as is readily checked via Google -- indeed, there is not a *single prior
post* to h.l.a.s. authored by you containing the phrase &quot;somewhere I
read.&quot; You have actually misquoted *yourself* here!

You did *not* proffer the factoid about Southampton as a suggestion,
a conjecture, a piece of hearsay, or anything of the kind; rather, I
quote your post below in its entirety, snipping only the quoted text
from KQKnave and others that prompted your followup:

&quot;Paul may have gotten one right.

Southampton was overly fond of drag and used to hang about the
theatres hoping to play female roles. He was given a few parts
and was apparently very convincing as a girl.

&quot;Southampton probably looked very much like that portrait when
he was sixteen or seventeen--about the time that the V &amp; A
and Lucrece were dedicated to him.

&quot;The V &amp; A may have been written for Southampton
at Burghley's request. Burghley wanted to match one of his
grandaughters to Southampton and there was Southampton all
got up like his grandaughters.

&quot;The first seventeen Sonnets were obviously written to get
the most elgible young peer, William Herbert, holed up in
his apartments writing religious poetry, to come out and
dance with the young ladies of the Court.

&quot;Francis Bacon, who was at Court through the 1590s,
wrote the Sonnets either for Burghley or at the request
of his childhood friend the Countess of Pembroke
[both were wards of Burghley].

&quot;Or Bacon may have written them for his boss, Elizabeth,
who was the chief matchmaker in the realm. Elizabeth knew
Bacon could write sonnets since part of a sonnet he wrote to
her is still extant.

&quot;If Strats didn't have the wrong candidate they would be
able to see that the Sonnets were written by a courtier
for the Court and that they were privately published for
the Court in 1609.

&quot;That eliminates both Oxford, a faltering alcoholic
with no invitation to the Court and Shakespeare,
the tradesman of Stratford whose low rank would bar him
from Court and who was back in Stratford by 1597 in any event.&quot;

&lt;&gt;.

I have no idea why you persist in making an ass of yourself with your
revionist history, which is easily refuted by the simple expedient of
quoting your own words from the Google archive.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Webb is trying to make it appear that I claimed that I had

&gt; just something I read while browsing online and I did not
&gt; attempt to conceal that fact.

"/>

When you posted it, you said nothing of the sort, nor did you ever
furnish a source. Matters being so, there appear to be two obvious
possibilities, and it only remains to decide which of the two is the
correct one:

(1) You read it at some farcically unreliable online site which you
cannot quote, and indeed can no longer even *find*, or

(2) You just made it up.

Since so many of your factoids are demonstrably false (e.g., &quot;Verulam
means 'state of truth' in Latin&quot;), one wonders where on earth you could
possibly have read them. Indeed, one is not sure which is the more
charitable assumption: that you are so comically credulous that you
accept everything that you read online at fact value without so much as
consulting a Latin dictionary, or that you merely make things up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Webb doesn't have a case because I didn't make any claims

You never furnished *any source whatever*. Matters being so, the
only remaining question is whether you read it at some online site you
cannot quote (or for that matter, cannot even find) or whether you
simply made it up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You did not say &quot;fwiw&quot;; rather, you said:

I quoted your posts in its entirety, and there was no such qualification.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I also said that I had seen

But you offered it as evidence of your farcical factoid about
Southampton's hanging about the theatres hoping to play female roles!
If you think making an assertion and then citing as &quot;source&quot; a book that
says something altogether different is persuasive, then your grasp of
rational argument is seriously deficient.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No, once again your history is wrong. As you can readily check via

&gt; Webb.

&gt; I don't believe that remarks in passing made in an informal
&gt; exchange require citations.

&gt; Webb is inventing this extraordinary demand so he can
&gt; keep up the harassment on the pretense that he is only
&gt; 'seeking the truth.'

&gt; I told him the truth, up front, in my first posts to him and
&gt; of course Webb knows this.

&gt; Here are the facts but this is not in the way of a formal argument
&gt; so you can take it or leave it:

&gt; 1. Southampton and Essex were regulars at the public theatres
&gt; but Southampton was an aficionado so he had a private theatre
&gt; constructed at Southampton House.

&gt; It's in the record that Richard II was played at Southampton's private
&gt; theatre.

&gt; So we may conclude that the theatre groupie Southampton 'liked to
&gt; hang about the theatres.'

&gt; 2. Webb also denies that Southampton was a homosexual but
&gt; Akrigg and others have printed an eyewitness account by
&gt; one of Southampton's officers that Southampton was having
&gt; sex with a 'favorite' in a tent in Ireland near the field of battle.
&gt; Southampton was the disasterous 'Master of the Horse' and
&gt; showered this 'favorite'--some man from the ranks--with
&gt; favors including a prize saddle horse, the latter gift causing
&gt; scandal because of its high price.
&gt; .
&gt; I couldn't find Akrigg's out-of-print biography of Southampton
&gt; although Webb was able to cross the quad to the library
&gt; and page through the index--but I stumbled onto the pertinent
&gt; quote taken from Akrigg's book in an old review from a journal
&gt; archived online.

&gt; And yes, I cited the review, not the book.

&gt; I am not responsible for Webb's inability to manage his anger
&gt; but I am really getting bored with his misrepresentation of
&gt; what I have stated and posted.

&gt;&gt; So if you're tired of hearing about it, answer the question.

&gt; Reedy. Webb doesn't want the answer.

&gt; Webb wants to hold on to the the question because making
&gt; authoritarian demands gets Webb excited.

&gt; Best regards,

Mr. Webb!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; None of your supposed &quot;sources&quot; yet has asserted that Southampton
&gt; used to hang around the theatres hoping to play female roles, let alone
&gt; that he was given several parts and was quite convincing as a girl.

&gt;&gt; One of his excuses involved the fact that I used the word
&gt;&gt; 'drag' and not the word 'camp.' As far as I know camp is
&gt;&gt; drag with an attitude but perhaps you can correct me,
&gt;&gt; Reedy.

&gt;&gt; This is hardly the first time I've posted this portrait:

&gt;&gt; From The Guardian:

&gt;&gt; In the portrait by an unknown artist, dating from the
&gt;&gt; early 1590s, the teenage Henry Wriothesley, third
&gt;&gt; Earl of Southampton, is wearing lipstick, rouge and
&gt;&gt; an elaborate double earring. His long hair hangs down
&gt;&gt; in very feminine tresses and his hand lies on his heart
&gt;&gt; in a somewhat camp gesture.

&gt; As I noted at the time:
&gt; ---------------------------------------
&gt; Huh? All this suggests is that Southampton's appearance was
&gt; androgynous or even feminine, which was never in dispute. Where does
&gt; it assert that Southampton was &quot;overly fond of drag&quot; (the term &quot;drag&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; W E B B

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS IS POST NUMBER 52.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IT IS TI M E TO STOP OBSESSING ABOUT

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; SOUTHAMPTON'S CROSS-DRESSSING.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LET IT GO.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why don't you answer his question and maybe he'll stop asking it?

&gt;&gt; The answer, Reedy, is irrelevant. Webb is only interested
&gt;&gt; in the inquisition.

&gt;&gt; Webb likes to play the authoritarian so he keeps this tedious
&gt;&gt; game going by repeatedly denying that Southampton
&gt;&gt; was a cross-dresser--see pdf below--even though hundreds of
&gt;&gt; articles have been published on the discovery of a portrait thought
&gt;&gt; for 400 years to be of a young woman but discovered to be of
&gt;&gt; Southampton..

&gt;&gt; Southampton's identity as the 'young woman' has been verified
&gt;&gt; by top experts in Elizabethan portraiture.

&gt;&gt; The experts agree that Southampton is wearing drag.

&gt;&gt; I've posted at least fifty links to articles on the subject of
&gt;&gt; Southampton's cross-dressing portrait but Webb has chosen
&gt;&gt; to reject the evidence.

&gt;&gt; One of his excuses involved the fact that I used the word
&gt;&gt; 'drag' and not the word 'camp.' As far as I know camp is
&gt;&gt; drag with an attitude but perhaps you can correct me,
&gt;&gt; Reedy.

&gt;&gt; This is hardly the first time I've posted this portrait:

&gt;&gt; From The Guardian:

&gt;&gt; In the portrait by an unknown artist, dating from the
&gt;&gt; early 1590s, the teenage Henry Wriothesley, third
&gt;&gt; Earl of Southampton, is wearing lipstick, rouge and
&gt;&gt; an elaborate double earring. His long hair hangs down
&gt;&gt; in very feminine tresses and his hand lies on his heart
&gt;&gt; in a somewhat camp gesture.

&gt;&gt;&lt;http://www.observer.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,687778,00.html&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; After all,
&gt;&gt;&gt; you are the only one with the knowledge about where you got the
&gt;&gt;&gt; claim, Southampton was overly fond of drag and used to hang
&gt;&gt;&gt; about the theatres hoping to play female roles.&quot;

&gt;&gt; What Webb has failed to convey is that I said, conversationally,
&gt;&gt; that 'somewhere I read Southampton was fond of drag.'

&gt;&gt; Webb is trying to make it appear that I claimed that I had
&gt;&gt; an authoritative source but was unwilling to cite it. It was
&gt;&gt; just something I read while browsing online and I did not
&gt;&gt; attempt to conceal that fact.

&gt;&gt; Webb doesn't have a case because I didn't make any claims
&gt;&gt; that it was taken from an authoritative source.

&gt;&gt; Keeping in mind that this was not a formal post that required
&gt;&gt; citiations and in the spirit of fwiw, I also said that I had seen
&gt;&gt; Akrigg's book on Southampton's homosexuality on a Queer Studies
&gt;&gt; page and I candidly divulged to Webb that it was only a bibliography
&gt;&gt; citation.

&gt;&gt; I also read that Southampton played female roles, not
&gt;&gt; in the public theatres, of course, but in private playhouses.
&gt;&gt; There is no documented contemporaneous source but there
&gt;&gt; is a tradition that Southampton played a female role in MSND.

&gt;&gt; The point here, Reedy, is that I was in a *conversation* with
&gt;&gt; Webb.

&gt;&gt; I don't believe that remarks in passing made in an informal
&gt;&gt; exchange require citations.

&gt;&gt; Webb is inventing this extraordinary demand so he can
&gt;&gt; keep up the harassment on the pretense that he is only

&gt;&gt; It's in the record that Richard II was played at Southampton's private

&gt;&gt; So we may conclude that the theatre groupie Southampton 'liked to

&gt;&gt; 2. Webb also denies that Southampton was a homosexual but
&gt;&gt; Akrigg and others have printed an eyewitness account by

&gt;&gt; Southampton was the disasterous 'Master of the Horse' and
&gt;&gt; showered this 'favorite'--some man from the ranks--with
&gt;&gt; favors including a prize saddle horse, the latter gift causing

While I was writing this post (now deleted) I had an insight
about the Southampton portrait..

Southampton is wearing a theatrical wig.

I didn't notice it before because I took it for granted that
Southampton was wearing his own hair in a feminine style
but I was thinking about that particular hair style with rows
of little curls framing his face. Those curls are very hard
to create unless the hair is very curly and somewhat coarse
to begin with. You have to roll the hair around something
and pin it from both sides and you end up with a pound and
a half of hairpins on your head.

No straight hair could be put into that style without glue.

On the other hand, those rows of small curls are easy to do
in wigs where curls made from purchased hair--it would still
have to be naturally curly--can be pinned or stitched to the
foundation of the wig. .

In his fine portrait done about 1615, Southampton's hair is
slightly wavy but with that hair style, slightly wavy is as same
as straight.

Furthermore, Southampton is described as having strawberry
blond hair. Light golden red. His hair was one of his most
striking features and it was still an amazing, although darker,
shade of red when he was in his forties.

The wig is sort of a brownish-blond.

I have one further point.

Thinking about the theatrical wig and the fact that it is not
Southampton's real hair, I realized that Southampton would
not have himself portrayed as a woman.

The earls were the English warrior class and Essex and
Southampton modeled their 'amity friendship' after
Achilles and Patroclus. Having himself painted as a (devalued)
female would be antithetical to the Petrarchan ideal of
pure platonic (male only) love.

Southampton could, however, legitimately commission a portrait
of himself as a female character from one of the Shakespeare
plays without violating the rules of amity friendship or scandalizing
society.

Best regards,

Elizabeth

I am waiting to see if Mr. Webb - as civilised people address each other in
England, no disrespect is intentended - will comment on your own fascinating
statements in an equitable fashion, or if his criticism of another person
here is solely reserved to that person, and not the subject matter at all.
Its an honesty test.

In England if anyone described themselves as 'doctor' they would be assumed
to be either an MD, or the Master of a college. Anyone else presuming to use
the title would be laughed at forever. The USA is different however, as an
interesting report currently illustrates from a Canadian sociology survey.

It contrasts the degree of household democracy versus male authoritarianism
in Europe, Canada and the USA. The researcher cites it as proof that
Canadians have a much closer social fabric to Europe than with the States.

If anyone does not the results the cue-question was: &quot;Should the man be the

You can relax, Phil; I don't use any academic title, and I remain on
a first-name basis with my students (some students use &quot;Professor&quot; or
&quot;Dr.&quot; when addressing all their instructors, but I don't encourage the
practice). About the only use of such titles lies in impressing the
feeble-minded, such as when one writes to bureaucrats on behalf of
prisoners of conscience.

to Einstein, I am unsure who you quote, but it seems to me that the

&gt;&quot;Dr.&quot; when addressing all their instructors,

I rarely use any of my degrees or offices of distinction. However, I had a
Togolese student who insisted on the 'Sir' routine, and even standing to
attention when I came into the room. Taking advice; the suggested cure was
to demand increasing amounts of respect from him, including to stand on the
table when I entered the room...

One morning he came in and I asked him to do something and he started
laughing and pointing his finger at me, you you you ! He was saying, bad bad
bad man! Since he had 'got' the joke he grinned at everything I said and
winked at others. The downside was that for the next month he did the same
whether what I said was sensible or no :(

&gt; but I don't encourage the
&gt; practice). About the only use of such titles lies in impressing the
&gt; feeble-minded, such as when one writes to bureaucrats on behalf of
&gt; prisoners of conscience.

&gt;&gt; The USA is different however, as an
&gt;&gt; interesting report currently illustrates from a Canadian sociology
survey.
&gt;&gt; It contrasts the degree of household democracy versus male
authoritarianism
&gt;&gt; in Europe, Canada and the USA. The researcher cites it as proof that
&gt;&gt; Canadians have a much closer social fabric to Europe than with the
States.

&gt;&gt; If anyone does not the results the cue-question was: &quot;Should the man be
the
&gt;&gt; ruler of the house?&quot; Guess % of population answering 'yes' for:

&gt;&gt; Europe
&gt;&gt; Canada
&gt;&gt; New England and West Coast
&gt;&gt; Central and Southern States

No guesses? Come on - I want people to have a go at it. The result is
fascinating. I'll hold off for awhile before writing them in. I think,
nolens volens the comments of Neil Brennen, that it is a commonplace for
Americans to afford 'Greats' a different status than would Europeans, for
example. I hasten to say that this is no absolute measure, but a relative
one, and yet the sociological difference in attitude to 'Greats' may explain
a certain divisional factor here in our own cozy newsgroup.

Sorry but you're wrong on several counts. Most British doctors are not M.D.s
Rather they possess two bachelor degrees, one in medecine, one in surgery. In
Britain an M.D. is a post-graduate, higher degree. Hence, medical doctors are
granted the courtesy title of doctor. Incidentally, Surgeons in hospitals are
addressed as Mister. While many Ph.D.s don't insist on their title, they are
regularly addressed as doctor at #all* universities or wherever, even at your
so-called &quot;ivys&quot; (I assume you mean Oxbridge). If you doubt that go and look at
the web pages describing university staff (as they are called in
Britain--faculty refers to something else). As for the Master of a College
being called doctor--I haven't heard of that, unless they possess a doctorate.

Woof.

Why inquire? What depends on it for Neil Brennen?

I say again, I know why you don't like me Neil; I know the measure of your
own honesty ;)

You are a stranger from the truth, no? You can prose away in public, but
nothing will remove what I know of you as fact.

Unless you come to understand this yourself you will have to live your life
via other people. Is that what you really want? Go bark in the woods, your
efforts are not worth a significant reply, here nor elsewhere.

You have a complex around authority figures which is indiscriminate; either
hateful or sycophantic, and I am so tempted to talk of what must be your
parental relations - did Daddy hit you, and so on? Do you hate him because
he is present or he is absent? - Will provoking arguments with adults get
'them' back together?

You have stalked me for three years now, merrily crossposting sub-literary
crap to a level of public deceit which wins every prize for such.

You might consult yourself on whether you wish to live the rest of your life
this way, living vicariously, or grow up and find your own soul as a man.

It is your business, not mine, even though you will likely not understand
the depth of this insult that you continuously perpetrate on yourSELF.

You and Lynne are quite right, of course, and Mr. Innes is wrong
again, at least in the academic disciplines with which I am familiar.
Indeed, Mr. Innes might wish to visit the math departments at Cambridge
and Oxford at

&lt;&gt; and

&lt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/>

to check this for himself. In particular, Mr. Innes's ridiculous
suggestion that &quot;Anyone else [other than the Master of a college]
presuming to use the title [of Dr.] would be laughed at forever&quot; is
quite plainly false -- not everyone on the list of the Mathematics
teaching staff at Cambridge or Oxford is Master of a college, yet the
use of &quot;Dr.&quot; or &quot;Prof.&quot; is the norm, and it is certain that these
individuals are not laughingstocks, as Mr. Innes confidently but
erroneously assures us; indeed, among them are some Fellows of the Royal
Society.

In any case, I have no idea why Mr. Innes is so overwrought about
this issue of academic titles. I have already set his mind at rest (I
hope) that I do not use any title myself; however, I do not know whether
others, e.g., Dr. Stritmatter and Dr. Wright, are comfortable with the
sort of first-name informality that I cultivate (indeed, Dr. Wright
appears to use his title *all the time*), so I do not presume an
importunate informality and familiarity that these individuals might not
welcome, and hence I use their titles as a professional courtesy. I
trust that this mollifies Mr. Innes and puts to rest whatever it is that
is troubling him.

Nothing &quot;depends on it&quot; for me; but, since you have a habit of making

This is the fallback Innes pose - after he makes idle threats of lawsuits,

&gt;&gt; Mr. Innes, Dr. Webb. Now you are properly introduced, perhaps you will

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bark off!

&gt;&gt; On the other hand, perhaps not.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I am waiting to see if Mr. Webb - as civilised people address each other in
&gt;&gt;&gt; England, no disrespect is intentended - will comment on your own fascinating
&gt;&gt;&gt; statements in an equitable fashion, or if his criticism of another person
&gt;&gt;&gt; here is solely reserved to that person, and not the subject matter at all.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Its an honesty test.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In England if anyone described themselves as 'doctor' they would be assumed
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be either an MD, or the Master of a college. Anyone else presuming to use
&gt;&gt;&gt; the title would be laughed at forever. The USA is different however, as an
&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting report currently illustrates from a Canadian sociology survey.

&gt;&gt; I beg to differ, Mr. Innes. My sister and brother-in-law both have
&gt;&gt; British PhDs and are both addressed as doctor. My sister is a lecturer
&gt;&gt; in a Scottish university and my brother-in-law has gone back to school
&gt;&gt; to become a lawyer.

&gt; Then your b-i-l will be addressed as &quot;counselor&quot; (by the judge)
&gt; or &quot;the distinguished Mr. [bil],&quot; (by his partners)
&gt; or &quot;my esteemed colleague,&quot; by his opposing counsel,

Yes, but at the moment he's at lawyer night school, and is just addressed as doc.

I've been trying to figure this one out myself, David. No offense, but I

book review I wrote, BCD giving me his opinion on a rose matter, and Lynne
inviting me to Baltimore, I don't see what I've gained, aside from
knowledge, understanding, and entertainment, from the HLAS posters I like.

Mr. Innes' exhibits the same behavior time and time again:

1) he appears on a newsgroup and poses as an expert on some topic or another
(chess governance; Cornish; Latin; Shakespeare; Russian);
2) people challenge him when he makes outrageous claims;
3) he resorts to ad-hom attacks and threats against people who disagree with
him, especially if they have some notoriety: Dr. Robert Hyatt, the computer
programmer; James Eade, USCF rep to FIDE; Frank Niro, Executive Director of
the USCF. And now Dr. David Webb, of Dartmouth.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Never read Gibbon? :(
&gt;&gt;&gt;I think things may have changed regionally Lynne , but in the British
Ivy's
&gt;&gt;&gt;I think not.

&gt;&gt; Sorry but you're wrong on several counts. Most British doctors are not
M.D.s
&gt;&gt; Rather they possess two bachelor degrees, one in medecine, one in
surgery. In
&gt;&gt; Britain an M.D. is a post-graduate, higher degree. Hence, medical
doctors are
&gt;&gt; granted the courtesy title of doctor. Incidentally, Surgeons in
hospitals are
&gt;&gt; addressed as Mister. While many Ph.D.s don't insist on their title, they
are
&gt;&gt; regularly addressed as doctor at #all* universities or wherever, even at
your
&gt;&gt; so-called &quot;ivys&quot; (I assume you mean Oxbridge). If you doubt that go and
look
&gt;&gt; at
&gt;&gt; the web pages describing university staff (as they are called in
&gt;&gt; Britain--faculty refers to something else).

&gt; You and Lynne are quite right, of course, and Mr. Innes is wrong

I suspect it may have sonething to do with what motivates Crowley's little
tantrums about academics: a chip on the shoulder. But I'm only guessing.
It's amusing, at any rate, that someone who professes to lecture us about
English mores should think that English doctors are MDs.

"/>

Perhaps not -- but the informality you suggest certainly is not in
evidence in their contributions in this forum (or elsewhere). For
example, some of Dr. Stritmatter's posts evince a preoccupation with
rank and credentials:

&quot;And what are your credentials as a scholar, Bob?

I hold a masters degree in Anthropology, awarded with honors,
from the New School for Social Research. The reason I haven't
bothered to try to respond to all of your numberous silly comments
in this forum is that I am completing a PhD dissertation on Edward
de Vere's Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's Knowledge and Use of the
Bible. I'm also working on a book project based on that
dissertation. I've also authored a dozen short scholarly articles,
some of them published in *Notes and Queries,* some in less
established scholarly forums (as you know, since you subscribe)
such as the *Shakespeare Oxford Newsletter* and *the Oxfordian*.
I haven't heard you rebutting any of my contributions to those
publications. No, you come here and brag in public about what a
great scholar you are and how all the Oxfordians are afraid of
you. Such a man!&quot;

and

&gt;Tad Davis Senior Systems Analyst

&gt;voice 215-898-7864 Administrative Information Technologies
&gt;fax 215-898-0386 University of Pennsylvania
&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;

This is certainly impressive.&quot;

In Dr. Wright's case, he has plainly signed his posts to h.l.a.s. as
&quot;Prof. Daniel Wright, Ph.D.,&quot;&quot;The Rev. Dr. Daniel Wright,&quot; etc. Not a
single one of my professional colleagues (to my knowledge) makes any use
of such titles on his or her web page, yet Dr. Wright's web page plainly
identifies him -- repeatedly -- as &quot;Daniel L. Wright, Ph.D.,&quot;&quot;The Rev.
Dr. Daniel Wright,&quot;&quot;Professor Wright,&quot;&quot;Dr Wright,&quot; etc. (indeed, on
every single occasion, except where a pronoun is used in lieu of his
name). Since this practice is apparently not even the norm among his
Concordia colleagues, I think it a reasonable inference that Dr. Wright
is inclined toward more formality and ceremony than any of my academic
acquaintances is, in deference to which I use his title.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They also both seem rather popular with their students, as
&gt; I'm sure you are. However, I cannot see the harm in using one's title
&gt; when one has worked so hard to get it.

"/>

There I whole-heartedly agree -- particularly in the case of Dr.
Stritmatter, whose degree is relatively newly minted and evidently cost
him a prodigious amount of hard work; why shouldn't he enjoy the
afterglow for a little while? In any case, it is entirely a personal
preference, and I cannot think why Mr. Innes (or Phil, if he prefers) is
making such a hue and cry about it, particularly in his silly claims
about differences in practice between American and British universities,
when he evidently is not familiar with either setting.

&gt; Perhaps not -- but the informality you suggest certainly is not in

&gt; example, some of Dr. Stritmatter's posts evince a preoccupation with
&gt; rank and credentials:

&gt;&quot;And what are your credentials as a scholar, Bob?

&gt; I hold a masters degree in Anthropology, awarded with honors,
&gt; from the New School for Social Research. The reason I haven't
&gt; bothered to try to respond to all of your numberous silly comments
&gt; in this forum is that I am completing a PhD dissertation on Edward
&gt; de Vere's Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's Knowledge and Use of the
&gt; Bible. I'm also working on a book project based on that
&gt; dissertation. I've also authored a dozen short scholarly articles,
&gt; some of them published in *Notes and Queries,* some in less
&gt; established scholarly forums (as you know, since you subscribe)
&gt; such as the *Shakespeare Oxford Newsletter* and *the Oxfordian*.
&gt; I haven't heard you rebutting any of my contributions to those
&gt; publications. No, you come here and brag in public about what a
&gt; great scholar you are and how all the Oxfordians are afraid of
&gt; you. Such a man!&quot;

&gt; This is certainly impressive.&quot;

"/>

I would make three points: first, Roger has changed quite
dramatically, like many others around here; second, I do understand
his preoccupation with degrees etc on hlas as in the past his
expertise was always being called into question; and third, he doesn't
seem to be in the least fazed by my lack of scholarly credentials or
indeed, by my title of ignoramus of the first degree.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; In Dr. Wright's case, he has plainly signed his posts to h.l.a.s. as
&gt;&quot;Prof. Daniel Wright, Ph.D.,&quot;&quot;The Rev. Dr. Daniel Wright,&quot; etc. Not a
&gt; single one of my professional colleagues (to my knowledge) makes any use
&gt; of such titles on his or her web page, yet Dr. Wright's web page plainly
&gt; identifies him -- repeatedly -- as &quot;Daniel L. Wright, Ph.D.,&quot;&quot;The Rev.
&gt; Dr. Daniel Wright,&quot;&quot;Professor Wright,&quot;&quot;Dr Wright,&quot; etc. (indeed, on
&gt; every single occasion, except where a pronoun is used in lieu of his
&gt; name). Since this practice is apparently not even the norm among his
&gt; Concordia colleagues, I think it a reasonable inference that Dr. Wright
&gt; is inclined toward more formality and ceremony than any of my academic
&gt; acquaintances is, in deference to which I use his title.

"/>

I think that like Roger, Dan's expertise is often called into question
because he is an Oxfordian, so he likes his interlocutors to know that
he does have some standing academically. Off hlas he's usually rather
informal although he does wear a rather spiffy suit. ;) But I do agree
with you that when one is not acquainted in any way with the person
one is addressing, it is usually safest to be formal until given leave
to use a first name. I'm wondering now whether I should go back to
calling you Dr. Webb, but I don't think I knew you were a doctor when
I was first unwise enough (you always win) to engage you in
conversation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; They also both seem rather popular with their students, as

I'm afraid I don't understand either. There are those of us with PhDs

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In any case, I have no idea why Mr. Innes is so overwrought about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this issue of academic titles. I have already set his mind at rest (I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hope) that I do not use any title myself; however, I do not know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whether
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; others, e.g., Dr. Stritmatter and Dr. Wright, are comfortable with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sort of first-name informality that I cultivate (indeed, Dr. Wright
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appears to use his title *all the time*),
&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, they're Rog(er) and Dan to me, David,

I don't doubt it. But I haven't attended any Oxfordian conferences

&gt;&gt;&gt; and neither stand much on
&gt;&gt;&gt; ceremony.
&gt;&gt; Perhaps not -- but the informality you suggest certainly is not in
&gt;&gt; evidence in their contributions in this forum (or elsewhere). For
&gt;&gt; example, some of Dr. Stritmatter's posts evince a preoccupation with
&gt;&gt; rank and credentials:

&gt;&gt;&quot;And what are your credentials as a scholar, Bob?

&gt;&gt; I hold a masters degree in Anthropology, awarded with honors,
&gt;&gt; from the New School for Social Research. The reason I haven't
&gt;&gt; bothered to try to respond to all of your numberous silly comments
&gt;&gt; in this forum is that I am completing a PhD dissertation on Edward
&gt;&gt; de Vere's Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's Knowledge and Use of the
&gt;&gt; Bible. I'm also working on a book project based on that
&gt;&gt; dissertation. I've also authored a dozen short scholarly articles,
&gt;&gt; some of them published in *Notes and Queries,* some in less
&gt;&gt; established scholarly forums (as you know, since you subscribe)
&gt;&gt; such as the *Shakespeare Oxford Newsletter* and *the Oxfordian*.
&gt;&gt; I haven't heard you rebutting any of my contributions to those
&gt;&gt; publications. No, you come here and brag in public about what a
&gt;&gt; great scholar you are and how all the Oxfordians are afraid of
&gt;&gt; you. Such a man!&quot;

His expertise may have been called into question because of his
howlers, but I cannot recall anyone disputing any academic degrees he
may have possessed. But you weren't reading h.l.a.s. then, were you?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and third, he doesn't
&gt; seem to be in the least fazed by my lack of scholarly credentials or
&gt; indeed, by my title of ignoramus of the first degree.
&gt;&gt; In Dr. Wright's case, he has plainly signed his posts to h.l.a.s. as
&gt;&gt;&quot;Prof. Daniel Wright, Ph.D.,&quot;&quot;The Rev. Dr. Daniel Wright,&quot; etc. Not a
&gt;&gt; single one of my professional colleagues (to my knowledge) makes any use
&gt;&gt; of such titles on his or her web page, yet Dr. Wright's web page plainly
&gt;&gt; identifies him -- repeatedly -- as &quot;Daniel L. Wright, Ph.D.,&quot;&quot;The Rev.
&gt;&gt; Dr. Daniel Wright,&quot;&quot;Professor Wright,&quot;&quot;Dr Wright,&quot; etc. (indeed, on
&gt;&gt; every single occasion, except where a pronoun is used in lieu of his
&gt;&gt; name). Since this practice is apparently not even the norm among his
&gt;&gt; Concordia colleagues, I think it a reasonable inference that Dr. Wright
&gt;&gt; is inclined toward more formality and ceremony than any of my academic
&gt;&gt; acquaintances is, in deference to which I use his title.
&gt; I think that like Roger, Dan's expertise is often called into question
&gt; because he is an Oxfordian,

Perhaps, although I haven't seen it myself. Rather, I've seen him
call Jim's expertise into question (in the matter of the hilarious,

&gt;&gt; None of your supposed &quot;sources&quot; yet has asserted that Southampton
&gt;&gt; used to hang around the theatres hoping to play female roles, let alone
&gt;&gt; that he was given several parts and was quite convincing as a girl.

&gt; about the Southampton portrait..

&gt; Southampton is wearing a theatrical wig.

"/>

Is this merely a speculative suggestion, diffidently proferred for
what it's worth? Or is this yet another of Elizabeth's &quot;facts&quot;?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I didn't notice it before because I took it for granted that
&gt; Southampton was wearing his own hair in a feminine style
&gt; but I was thinking about that particular hair style with rows
&gt; of little curls framing his face. Those curls are very hard
&gt; to create unless the hair is very curly and somewhat coarse
&gt; to begin with. You have to roll the hair around something
&gt; and pin it from both sides and you end up with a pound and
&gt; a half of hairpins on your head.

&gt; No straight hair could be put into that style without glue.

&gt; On the other hand, those rows of small curls are easy to do
&gt; in wigs where curls made from purchased hair--it would still
&gt; have to be naturally curly--can be pinned or stitched to the
&gt; foundation of the wig. .

&gt; In his fine portrait done about 1615, Southampton's hair is
&gt; slightly wavy but with that hair style, slightly wavy is as same
&gt; as straight.

"/>

Is this intended to be English?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Furthermore, Southampton is described as having strawberry
&gt; blond hair. Light golden red. His hair was one of his most
&gt; striking features and it was still an amazing, although darker,
&gt; shade of red when he was in his forties.

&gt; The wig is sort of a brownish-blond.

&gt; I have one further point.

&gt; Thinking about the theatrical wig and the fact that it is not
&gt; Southampton's real hair,

"/>

Has Elizabeth actually *established* this?!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I realized that Southampton would
&gt; not have himself portrayed as a woman.

Elizabeth's insight into Southampton's thoughts is indeed remarkable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The earls were the English warrior class and Essex and
&gt; Southampton modeled their 'amity friendship' after
&gt; Achilles and Patroclus. Having himself painted as a (devalued)
&gt; female would be antithetical to the Petrarchan ideal of
&gt; pure platonic (male only) love.

What &quot;Petrarchan ideal of pure platonic (male only) love&quot;?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Southampton could, however, legitimately commission a portrait
&gt; of himself as a female character from one of the Shakespeare
&gt; plays without violating the rules of amity friendship [sic] or
&gt; scandalizing
&gt; society.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; However I did write some possible stem-words for 'shake-scene' from
A.Sax

&gt;&gt; sincere, why not contest the matter of it if it seems false, or the

And (2)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The way to interogate someone's proposition, if they have presented no

&gt;&gt; certainly! For writer to _only_ say 'Nonsense!' is not in itself a
method of

I agree. However, Elizabeth's characterisation of the subject, nomatter how
unwell it was expressed to other's satisfaction does not dismiss the
possibility of its verity to a responsible mind, right? The responses to her
post have been about her posting style, not evidently to its subject. She is
asked for written proof from the period, for the name of a type of character
that is a social non-entity. Perhaps it exists, perhaps not? The burden of
proof rests upon one's acceptance of the premise rather than the providence:
It is entirely conjectural, but equitably conjectural! Would such a person
who shifted the scenery have had a name? - what was it? Where is the balance
of evidence of those who ask for 'proof', for any such proof is not in
contradition of another hypothetical name for someone who shifts scenes, but
inferential upon a definite ascription by Greene.

Nothing is proved, nothing disproved, yet so much mockery!

(3) Much above &lt;groan&gt; is a reference to the 50-some posts on 'shake-scene'.
Elizabeth introduced the term and proposed a usage of it, and received these
50-some posts denigrating the possibility, but, hola! There was such a term!

On which all are now silent, except to continue to berate Elizabeth that she
did not cite Greene as the first coiner of it (in print) as a lapsus,
(should others not already know it), and that made her /idea/ of its usage
wrong, not that others had previously found this reference themselves, nor
could imagine or investigate its extension to the Elizabethan stage :(

The issue is actually more interesting than even Elizabeth contends. Since
Greene coined [or rejoined] the term /specifically/ about Will o Stratford.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Her response to Tom Lay that, &quot;You wouldn't know a fact if it

&gt; I must say, I'm disappointed, but perhaps if she refrains from

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS IS POST NUMBER 52.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IT IS TI M E TO STOP OBSESSING ABOUT

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; SOUTHAMPTON'S CROSS-DRESSSING.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LET IT GO.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why don't you answer his question and maybe he'll stop asking it?
After
&gt;&gt; all,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you are the only one with the knowledge about where you got the
claim,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Southampton was overly fond of drag and used to hang about the
theatres
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hoping to play female roles.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So if you're tired of hearing about it, answer the question. It's
very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simple. Or admit you made it up, like you did when you said &quot;The
term
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'shake-scene' was Elizabethan theatre slang for the factotum who
toted
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scenery around between acts.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (And it sounds to me as if you're the one obsessing. I doubt that
David
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knows how many times he's posted on it.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Southampton is wearing a theatrical wig.

&gt; Is this merely a speculative suggestion, diffidently proferred for
&gt; what it's worth? Or is this yet another of Elizabeth's &quot;facts&quot;?

"/>

I know you have a very serious problem with any statement that
isn't derived from authority but it is permissible, Webb, to draw
conclusions from deductions based on direct observations.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I didn't notice it before because I took it for granted that
&gt;&gt; Southampton was wearing his own hair in a feminine style
&gt;&gt; but I was thinking about that particular hair style with rows
&gt;&gt; of little curls framing his face. Those curls are very hard
&gt;&gt; to create unless the hair is very curly and somewhat coarse
&gt;&gt; to begin with. You have to roll the hair around something
&gt;&gt; and pin it from both sides and you end up with a pound and
&gt;&gt; a half of hairpins on your head.

&gt;&gt; No straight hair could be put into that style without glue.

&gt;&gt; On the other hand, those rows of small curls are easy to do
&gt;&gt; in wigs where curls made from purchased hair--it would still
&gt;&gt; have to be naturally curly--can be pinned or stitched to the
&gt;&gt; foundation of the wig. .

&gt;&gt; In his fine portrait done about 1615, Southampton's hair is
&gt;&gt; slightly wavy but with that hair style, slightly wavy is as same
&gt;&gt; as straight.

&gt; Is this intended to be English?

"/>

You have abysmal manners.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Furthermore, Southampton is described as having strawberry
&gt;&gt; blond hair. Light golden red. His hair was one of his most
&gt;&gt; striking features and it was still an amazing, although darker,
&gt;&gt; shade of red when he was in his forties.

&gt;&gt; The wig is sort of a brownish-blond.

&gt;&gt; I have one further point.

&gt;&gt; Thinking about the theatrical wig and the fact that it is not
&gt;&gt; Southampton's real hair,

&gt; Has Elizabeth actually *established* this?!

"/>

Yes. It can be established by logic. Southampton's hair
was red and almost straight. His hair in the portrait is light
brown and very curly. His hair is in a style commonly found
in Elizabethan wigs. That's a string of logical inferences.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I realized that Southampton would
&gt;&gt; not have himself portrayed as a woman.

&gt; Elizabeth's insight into Southampton's thoughts is indeed remarkable.

"/>

I don't have to read Southampton's mind. I only have to know
the rules of male amity.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The earls were the English warrior class and Essex and
&gt;&gt; Southampton modeled their 'amity friendship' after
&gt;&gt; Achilles and Patroclus. Having himself painted as a (devalued)
&gt;&gt; female would be antithetical to the Petrarchan ideal of
&gt;&gt; pure platonic (male only) love.

&gt; What &quot;Petrarchan ideal of pure platonic (male only) love&quot;?

"/>

The English aristocrats who did the Grand Tour brought the
Italian Renaissance back with them. Platonic friendships
were popular at the Italian courts and the English imitated
them and wrote Italian sonnets to each other. The Shakespeare
Sonnets are part of this courly phenomenon and of course
they weren't written by an actor who decided to go back to
Stratford and become trader in corn and hay.

The most intensely passionate but unconsumated love
was reserved for two males engaged in an amity friendship
while lust was reserved for relationships with women. The
relationship in the Shakespeare Sonnets typify that convention.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Southampton could, however, legitimately commission a portrait
&gt;&gt; of himself as a female character from one of the Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; plays without violating the rules of amity friendship [sic] or
&gt;&gt; scandalizing
&gt;&gt; society.

There was? Have you any evidence? Elizabeth has not produced a

you know of some independent evidence establishing the word's existence

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No, you appear to have misunderstood almost completely. Elizabeth's
&quot;lapsus&quot; was not her failure to cite Greene (indeed, Greene's use of the
word was explicitly under discussion in the thread, so a mention of
Greene would have been redundant), but rather her claim that

&quot;The word 'shake-scene' was Elizabethan theatre slang for the
factotum who toted scenery around between acts.&quot;

Elizabeth asserted that the word was *already* enshrined in Elizabethan
theatre slang, and that it had an accepted sense, which she spelled out.
If so, none of the lexicographers whose works I have consulted is aware
of such a sense, nor can Elizabeth herself apparently furnish any
evidence for her claim. As Tom Reedy said, if she acknowledged merely
having made it all up, she would look far less foolish than she does by
feebly pleading that the matter be forgotten.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I very much doubt that Christine -- or virtually anyone else -- would
state an invention or pure speculation as fact in the first place, let
alone *continue* to maintain assertions that she had posted without any
supporting evidence.

Elizabeth's practice is bad enough in the present case, but it is
especially unconscionable in those frequent instances in which Elizabeth
not only states bizarre factoids as facts (without any evidence), but
actually makes vile accusations of fraud, intellectual dishonesty,
racism, etc. (without any evidence, of course). There is such a thing
as integrity, and it entails, among other things, being prepared to
substantiate such charges. Elizabeth's failure to do so is one of the
salient reasons that many of her posts are found so distasteful by so
many; her failure to adduce evidence in the matter of her claims
concerning &quot;shake-scene,&quot; concerning Southampton's putative performance
of female stage roles, etc. is merely a mild manifestations of a far
graver problem.

Accepted. I think its a stretch, yet if any term had been used, particularly
of Will Statford's theatre, 'shake-scene' must be a prime candidate ~ and
if so, by extrapolation it may have become a cant term for a scene shifter.

I spent a fruitless 2 hours among the authorities this morning without
result. One source beginning the Greene quote that I offered only gave the
first part leaving out 'shake-scene' from the drama of his writing, an
aposiopesis! to continue inconclusively.

Fair enough. However, a caution to such a prescription is something I wrote

Whereas, if you needed a scene-shifter, would you advertise for one, or if
the cant term was the jocular shake-scene, as that? I don't know.

That is, if I may say so, a moot point. A question would be, what are
scene-shifters called? But if there is no contemporary written record of
'scene-shifter' then we arrive at contention.

We suppose there is a name for scene-shifter. What is it? Unless there is
another name, indeed, whay not 'scene shifter? Then can we suppose that
Greene's term stuck? This is only supposition, and unsupportable by any

have had a tag? But what was it if not shake-scene?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In any case, I have no idea why Mr. Innes is so overwrought
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this issue of academic titles. I have already set his mind at rest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hope) that I do not use any title myself; however, I do not know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whether
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; others, e.g., Dr. Stritmatter and Dr. Wright, are comfortable with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sort of first-name informality that I cultivate (indeed, Dr. Wright
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appears to use his title *all the time*),
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, they're Rog(er) and Dan to me, David,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No doubt, Lynne --
&gt;&gt;&gt; That's Mistress Mouse, AABD, to you, Dr. Webb. &lt;g&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sorry -- won't happen again (at least, providing I have Elizabeth's
&gt;&gt; permission to call you &quot;Mouse&quot;).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but you enjoy personal acquaintance and presumably
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; friendship with both men,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I am lucky enough to be friends with both.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;while I have never even met either one.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Pity. You're missing out on two charming individuals.
&gt;&gt; I don't doubt it. But I haven't attended any Oxfordian conferences
&gt;&gt; -- not because I could not obtain a pig bladder, but merely because such
&gt;&gt; events tend to fall during periods when my academic commitments keep my
&gt;&gt; busy.
&gt; Well, perhaps this year will be different. Baltimore around October 8,
&gt; I believe.

"/>

Next year in Baltimore? Maybe. But it is decidedly inconvenient
that these things are scheduled right at one of the VERy busiest times
of the academic year. But perhaps the explanation is that, compared to
a conference in, say, spectral theory or quantum theory, the proportion
of the attendees who hold academic positions is quite small. :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; snip
&gt;&gt;&gt; I would make three points: first, Roger has changed quite
&gt;&gt;&gt; dramatically,
&gt;&gt; I don't doubt it -- but my familiarity with his posts dates to before
&gt;&gt; his metamorphosis.
&gt; Yes, but others have changed from caterpillars to butterflies also.
&gt; Some to moths, but even that's an improvement.

"/>

Moths are just as beautiful as and far more complex and fascinating
in their taxonomic diversity than their better known and more widely
appreciated cousins in the order Lepidoptera. See the last word of
Nabokov's _Bend Sinister_.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; like many others around here; second, I do understand
&gt;&gt;&gt; his preoccupation with degrees etc on hlas as in the past his
&gt;&gt;&gt; expertise was always being called into question;
&gt;&gt; His expertise may have been called into question because of his
&gt;&gt; howlers, but I cannot recall anyone disputing any academic degrees he
&gt;&gt; may have possessed. But you weren't reading h.l.a.s. then, were you?
&gt; I was shown a few posts. They may have been a while after the fact. I
&gt; believe his academic credentials were called into question in the
&gt; sense that some suggested that he shouldn't have received them. But
&gt; it's all water under the bridge now, David. It was a long time ago and
&gt; perhaps should be allowed to dry up, as water does occasionally.

"/>

Yes; as I said, why shouldn't he enjoy the afterglow for a while?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; and third, he doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; seem to be in the least fazed by my lack of scholarly credentials or
&gt;&gt;&gt; indeed, by my title of ignoramus of the first degree.

"/>

I thought you were AABD, not IFD. (Incidentally, AABD in what field?)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In Dr. Wright's case, he has plainly signed his posts to h.l.a.s. as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Prof. Daniel Wright, Ph.D.,&quot;&quot;The Rev. Dr. Daniel Wright,&quot; etc. Not a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; single one of my professional colleagues (to my knowledge) makes any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of such titles on his or her web page, yet Dr. Wright's web page
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plainly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; identifies him -- repeatedly -- as &quot;Daniel L. Wright, Ph.D.,&quot;&quot;The Rev.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dr. Daniel Wright,&quot;&quot;Professor Wright,&quot;&quot;Dr Wright,&quot; etc. (indeed, on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every single occasion, except where a pronoun is used in lieu of his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; name). Since this practice is apparently not even the norm among his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Concordia colleagues, I think it a reasonable inference that Dr. Wright
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is inclined toward more formality and ceremony than any of my academic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; acquaintances is, in deference to which I use his title.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that like Roger, Dan's expertise is often called into question
&gt;&gt;&gt; because he is an Oxfordian,
&gt;&gt; Perhaps, although I haven't seen it myself. Rather, I've seen him
&gt;&gt; call Jim's expertise into question (in the matter of the hilarious,
&gt;&gt; error-ridden Altschuler preprint) because of Jim's supposed inability to
&gt;&gt; distinguish &quot;its&quot; from &quot;it's&quot; -- after which Dr. Wright proceeded to
&gt;&gt; enumerate Altchuler's [sic -- should be &quot;Altschuler's&quot;] academic degrees.
&gt; Quite a few of us cannot distinguish &quot;its&quot; from &quot;it's,&quot; I've noticed.
&gt; In fact, I've seen the wrong usage so often that I have to stop and
&gt; think before using the word myself. I believe I've also seen Dan's
&gt; expertise questioned here, but I didn't keep a tally.

"/>

Well, the use of his academic title in every reference to himself on
his web page that doesn't use a preposition instead is surely not apt to
persuade anyone who might question his expertise. I don't think that I
recall seeing anyone question Dr. Wright's *possession* of a Ph.D.; if
any questions were raised, they would have been about his fitness for
such a degree, in which case his insistence upon possession of a Ph.D.
would be useless (that he has the degree has not, to my knowledge, been
disputed).

In fact, it is likely to have exactly the opposite effect: there are
a few academics, mostly at teaching-oriented institutions in which
research and scholarship are not expected (and where many of the faculty
do not have advanced degrees), who use the title conspicuously (if not
ostentatiously) to enhance their reputations and perhaps to distinguish
themselves from their non-Ph.D. colleagues -- whereas among scholars and
researchers, one's reputation is made by one's research or scholarship
and the consequent approbation of one's professional colleagues, so such
titles are irrelevant and hence rarely used (in the U.S., at any rate,
by persons younger than about 70). Of course, I am sure that Dr. Wright
knows this (he has probably encountered such persons in his professional
life), so the fact that he nonetheless uses his multiple titles on
virtually every possible occasion suggests to me that his is merely a
personal preference, and that he is inclined toward more formality than
most, in deference to which I continue to use his title.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; so he likes his interlocutors to know that
&gt;&gt;&gt; he does have some standing academically.

"/>

As noted, in active research communities one's academic standing is
generally gauged by one's work and the approbation of one's peers, so
this practice would avail him little; thus I would be inclined to doubt
that that is his reason (unless he has told you so). Rather, I would
guess that he is simply inclined toward more formality than most
academics.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; At his web page?
&gt; I think so. Even I have my degrees listed on my web page,
&gt; poverty-stricken though they may be.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Off hlas he's usually rather
&gt;&gt;&gt; informal although he does wear a rather spiffy suit. ;) But I do agree
&gt;&gt;&gt; with you that when one is not acquainted in any way with the person
&gt;&gt;&gt; one is addressing, it is usually safest to be formal until given leave
&gt;&gt;&gt; to use a first name.
&gt;&gt; I agree.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm wondering now whether I should go back to
&gt;&gt;&gt; calling you Dr. Webb,
&gt;&gt; No, Mistress Mouse, AABD; I much prefer informality.
&gt; Then you may call me Lynne, or just plain Mouse. I believe I must be
&gt; some kind of field mouse. The townies look down on me.

Field mice in Ontario are apt to be cold in the winter (l'hiVER);
better strive to be a house mouse.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; but I don't think I knew you were a doctor when
&gt;&gt;&gt; I was first unwise enough (you always win)
&gt;&gt; If you say so, whom I am to gainsay you? :-)
&gt;&gt;&gt; to engage you in
&gt;&gt;&gt; conversation.
&gt;&gt;&quot;Converstion&quot; is an anagram of &quot;Ver not a scion&quot; -- have I just
&gt;&gt; refuted the &quot;Tudor heir&quot; theorists? :-)
&gt; You may have. I believe one is allowed a letter either way in Tudor
&gt; anagrams.

"/>

Pardon my typo -- it is &quot;conversation&quot; that furnishes the anagram, of
course. (If omission of a letter is indeed permissible in &quot;Tudor&quot;
anagrams, then I would propose omission of the &quot;o&quot; -- the resulting
anagram is a pretty apt, if trenchant, commentary on the outcome of much
anti-Stratfordian ciphermongering. :-))

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They also both seem rather popular with their students, as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sure you are. However, I cannot see the harm in using one's title

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There I whole-heartedly agree -- particularly in the case of Dr.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stritmatter, whose degree is relatively newly minted and evidently cost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him a prodigious amount of hard work; why shouldn't he enjoy the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; afterglow for a little while?

Do you know what a circumstantial case is, Webb? There
is a good circumstantial case, particularly since Hsu has
retrieved Poincare and Lorentz' work from the STR
that Einstein did, in fact, derive relativity from Poincare's
relativity equations and Lorentz' transformations.

And Pais supplies some of the evidence for my case.

For years Einstein denied that he had derived his theory ...

&gt;&gt; However, Elizabeth *still*, a year and a half later, has not furnished
&gt;&gt; any source for an assertion that she enunciated as fact. Matters being
&gt;&gt; so, most readers would be inclined to assume that she merely made up the
&gt;&gt; factoid, but I prefer to give her the benefit of the doubt, hence my
&gt;&gt; repeated requests for a credible source.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And (2)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The way to interogate someone's proposition, if they have presented no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evidential material, is to question their method

&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------

&gt;&gt; If there is *no evidence whatever* forthcoming, then the &quot;method&quot; is
&gt;&gt; pretty immaterial. (Ineed, if there is no evidence avaiable, then the
&gt;&gt; method might well have been mere invention.)

&gt; Isn't that a line from 'Dr. Strangelove,' Dr. Strangewebb?

&gt; I see you've judiciously edited out the part in which
&gt; Christine says she agrees with Reedy's statement that I am

&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------

&gt;&gt; The &quot;possibility of its verity&quot; would of course have been gauged by
&gt;&gt; weighing the evidence -- if Elizabeth had ever furnished any.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The responses to her
&gt;&gt;&gt; post have been about her posting style, not evidently to its subject. She is
&gt;&gt;&gt; asked for written proof from the period, for the name of a type of character
&gt;&gt;&gt; that is a social non-entity. Perhaps it exists, perhaps not?

&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------

&gt;&gt; If perhaps such a word does not even exist, then why did Elizabeth
&gt;&gt; assert its existence as fact?

&gt;&gt;&gt; The burden of

&gt;&gt;&gt; Would such a person

&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------

&gt;&gt; Is there any independent evidence of the existence of such a word?

&gt; Yes, and I wrote a post on it last summer. I'll see if I can find it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; of another
&gt;&gt;&gt; hypothetical name for someone who
&gt;&gt;&gt; shifts scenes, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; inferential upon a definite ascription by Greene.

&gt;&gt; If anyone can translate the above paragraph into English, I will be
&gt;&gt; much obliged.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing is proved, nothing disproved, yet so much mockery!

&gt;&gt;&gt; (3) Much above &lt;groan&gt; is a reference to the 50-some posts on 'shake-scene'.

&gt; It's more than 50-some posts. Obsessive compulsives can't stop at
&gt; fifty. I just found a Google results from a year ago and Webb had
&gt; posted
&gt; * 201 *

&gt; WEBB OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE© posts on the subject of
&gt; 'Agnes a gob.' I thought it was 'only' 140.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Elizabeth introduced the term and proposed a usage of it,

&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------

&gt;&gt; No, she stated as *fact* that the word was &quot;Elizabethan theatre slang
&gt;&gt; for the factotum who toted scenery around between acts,&quot; yet thus far no
&gt;&gt; dictionary I have found is aware of such a sense; indeed, the best I can
&gt;&gt; find is the OED entry:

&gt;&gt;&quot;(Of uncertain or vague meaning: used by Greene in his attack on
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare.)&quot;

&gt; Or you could use your overheated brain to look up 'shake' and 'scene.'

&gt;&gt;&gt; and received these
&gt;&gt;&gt; 50-some posts denigrating the possibility, but, hola! There was such a term!

&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------

&gt;&gt; There was? Have you any evidence? Elizabeth has not produced a
&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------
&gt;&gt; shred of evidence in over a year (nor has she retracted the claim nor
&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------
&gt;&gt; conceded it to have been merely a speculative invention), but perhaps
&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------
&gt;&gt; you know of some independent evidence establishing the word's existence
&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------
&gt;&gt; and sense.

&gt;&gt;&gt; On which all are now silent, except to continue to berate Elizabeth that she
&gt;&gt;&gt; did not cite Greene as the first coiner of it (in print) as a lapsus,

&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------

&gt;&gt; No, you appear to have misunderstood almost completely. Elizabeth's

&gt;&gt;&quot;lapsus&quot;

&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------

&gt;&gt; was not her failure to cite Greene (indeed, Greene's use of the
&gt;&gt; word was explicitly under discussion in the thread, so a mention of
&gt;&gt; Greene would have been redundant), but rather her claim that

&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------
&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------
&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------
&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------
&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------

&gt;&gt;&quot;The word 'shake-scene' was Elizabethan theatre slang for the
&gt;&gt; factotum who toted scenery around between acts.&quot;

&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------

&gt;&gt; Elizabeth asserted that the word was *already* enshrined in Elizabethan
&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------
&gt;&gt; theatre slang, and that it had an accepted sense, which she spelled out.
&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------
&gt;&gt; If so, none of the lexicographers whose works I have consulted is aware
&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------
&gt;&gt; of such a sense, nor can Elizabeth herself apparently furnish any
&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------
&gt;&gt; evidence for her claim. As Tom Reedy said, if she acknowledged merely
&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------
&gt;&gt; having made it all up, she would look far less foolish than she does by
&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------
&gt;&gt; feebly pleading that the matter be forgotten.

&gt;&gt;&gt; (should others not already know it), and that made her /idea/ of its usage
&gt;&gt;&gt; wrong,

&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------
&gt;&gt; No, what is wrong is not her idea _per se_, but rather her nonchalant
&gt;&gt; pronouncement of it as established fact -- without any evidence, as is
&gt;&gt; her custom.

&gt;&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Her response to Tom Lay that, &quot;You wouldn't know a fact if it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; flew up your nose,&quot; indicates that she is happy to dish it out,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so she shouldn't object to having it returned in kind.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I must say, I'm disappointed, but perhaps if she refrains from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such commentary, she might receive less of it in return in the future.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (but I wouldn't bet on that at this point)

&gt;&gt;&gt; After 50-some posts over 3 years Ma'am, may you be as calm and collected!

&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------

&gt; Uh oh. I'm wrong. It's going to be a . . .

&gt; ---------------------------MANIPULATION ALERT -------------------------

&gt;&gt; I very much doubt that Christine -- or virtually anyone else -- would
&gt;&gt; state an invention or pure speculation as fact in the first place, let
&gt;&gt; alone *continue* to maintain assertions that she had posted without any
&gt;&gt; supporting evidence.

&gt; ------------ OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER ALERT---------------

&gt; No. Wrong again. It's another . . .

&gt; ---------------------------MANIPULATION ALERT -------------------------
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth's practice is bad enough in the present case, but it is
&gt;&gt; especially unconscionable in those frequent instances in which Elizabeth
&gt;&gt; not only states bizarre factoids as facts (without any evidence), but
&gt;&gt; actually makes vile accusations of fraud, intellectual

Elizabeth, I duly take note above that you have used the word
&quot;derive,&quot; correctly, but I suspect you still intended &quot;plagiarize.&quot;

I believe you may also have misunderstood Dr. Hsu.

A concise, non-Eurocentric review of the history of relativity is at:

The HTML site is a chapter in a physics text (also available in pdf
format with photos and the math incl., by link at the top of the page)

The discussion on the correspondence of Poincare, Lorentz, Einstein,
and Planck, and the contributions that each made to STR, may help sort
out the confusion. It's quite readable.

In the notes at the end of the chapter, the author states, &quot;the
presentation of the historical development of the theory of
relativity, the bibliographic references, the titles citations from
the original papers are from J.-P. Hsu and V.-Z. Zhang, Lorentz and
Poincare Variance: 100 Years Of Relativity...and J.-P. Hsu, Einstein,
Relativity &amp; Beyond, New Symmetry Approaches.&quot;

I hope this is helpful.

Construct. You can only deconstruct certain kinds of rhetoric,
and by that I mean deconstruction in the rhetorical sense,
not the literary sense. The Shakespeare works are an
unsurpassed rhetorical tour de force but are given a
flat reading by Strats because the actor didn't
attend Cambridge. I tried to deconstruct some lines
from the plays but the language is so naturalistic
and so structurally honest--manipulative rhetoric
is written on two levels--Kant's First Critique, for
example--that I couldn't deconstruct it.

&gt; Oxford as
&gt;&gt; copies of the First Folio were being distributed for sale in London book

&gt;&gt; Weir is ignorant of too much basic history to be &gt;taken seriously.

&gt; LOL! Mr. Pot, meet Mr. Kettle!

&gt;&gt; The Oxford/Derby duo is the truth behind the Shakespeare pen name as
&gt; many
&gt;&gt; suspected in the 1920s. Proving it is the truth is difficult but now
&gt; possible
&gt;&gt; with the evidence in my hand...

&gt; And the tinfoil hat on your head?

&gt; ...which of course is a factor in my contempt for
&gt;&gt; the Baconian theory which has had many other shortcomings.

&gt; Such as lack of evidence, as with the Oxfordian theory.

&gt; It clearly was on
&gt;&gt; the wane in the years just before...yes before World War I. Weir is
&gt; living in
&gt;&gt; the Edwardian era which is about the last time the Baconian theory had any
&gt;&gt; significant or enthusiastic following. I suppose now with the Stratford
&gt; man
&gt;&gt; finally exposed for what he was...a cradle-to-grave secret Roman
&gt;&gt; Catholic...that alone is enough to prompt a few to give Bacon a second
&gt; look.
&gt;&gt; But it is all rubbish and a total waste of time.

&gt; That applies to ALL alternate authorship theories.

A.S. (Antonia) Byatt has had an on-goin series of talks with a psychological
lady from S. America (can't remember, last name Inez?) which are given at
the Cheltenham literary festival every year. I remember them deconstructing
George Eliot, and as past of that process noticing how many key elements
there were to circumnavigate. In fact I think it was Hughes who credited GE
for 'bring Falstaff back to life' as a contempory character in any
psychological sense, and with GE's precedent, then it would have been so
much more difficult for Dickens address of the crisis in self and society.

Falstaff as a character was not a factionist was he? All the other
characters run around him in noble, honorable and completely dedicated
intentions to murder other people like themselves. Whereas Falstaff suffers
doubt, reserve, admits his own fear, and submits as much to Venus as to
Mars. I think this is why Byatt has termed him a proto-modern /individual/
in comparison to the decidedly fundamentalist and group-motivated balance of
the cast.

I recently made note of Lockyer who tried to introduce astronomical ideas
into archaeology, and was roundly rebuffed and resented by the University
system. These days the orientation of Universities has also changed from a
place where any level of student could attend in order to reseach a subject,
to a place where other's ideas are disseminated, then one's knowledge of
which tested.

I think one should not look therefore to universities for primary researches
in any cross disciplinary areas. Interesting departures from this system
have been at places like Univ Sussex, where cross-discplinary research has
now beomce the norm for some 40 years, and notably, which produces the most
result, the most breakthroughs.

I asked you my flat and rhetorical question, hoping that you would dilate
this issue. Rather than make to many immediate comments in response, allow
me to add just one or two more ideas:-

I think you hit something when you say 'rhetorical' since the Works were
intended to be heard, rather than read, no? This makes them essentially
different that much text analysis, and structurally they contain much more
sound emphasis by internal resonance than may be suspected unless the text
is actually read aloud.

&gt;&gt; Well, I *was* going to point out that my response to Phil

&gt;&gt; but after all of the above, I wonder if I should take the matter
&gt;&gt; under advisement, but perhaps &quot;take a powder&quot; might be

not only because

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think you have a lot to teach us in HLAS but also
&gt; because I'm looking forward to a debate on the facts of the
&gt; case for Marlowe's authorship, something we have never
&gt; done in HLAS. I don't see any authorship facts in the Marlovian
&gt; case but you're no doubt more familiar with it than I am.

"/>

I'm still sorting out &quot;facts&quot; from &quot;inferences&quot; and &quot;conjectures,&quot;
and trying to decide whether said inferences and conjectures
are genuinely logically derived, before I engage in any genuine
debate on the subject.

Among other things, this involves comparing the &quot;facts&quot; to the
source material. The Reedy &amp; Kathman essay is a particularly
egregious example, with its plethora of inferences and conjectures
stated as facts, and disgusting attempts to read more into
something than may actually exist without addressing that issue
in the body of the essay; a case in point being
the implication of the importance of the ordering of names on a list,
without discussing alternative arguments for said importance,
leading to the conclusion that they believe that
the hypothetical intelligent reader is actually quite stupid.
This does not mean that I don't think that William Of Stratford
wrote the Works of William Shakespeare.
It does mean that their methodology raises the question that
R &amp; K themselves suspect that W o S may not be the author,
and they are playing mind games for their personal amusement.
My personal problem with William Of Stratford is one of
evidence for motivation/inspiration, access to source material,
and a mentor, or lack thereof. W o S as actor is easy.
W o S as author appears derived out of whole cloth.

In fairness, I note that the proponents of Oxford, Bacon &amp; Marlowe
often engage in similar tactics, intended to obfuscate and mislead.
Oxford is my least favourite candidate.

(So far, Peter Farey's work appears to be honest,
which John Baker manages to counter-balance with hyperbole,
although some of Baker's work appears logically derived,
I think it's often his *style* which invokes the gag reflex)

Bacon appears to be a bit of a stick, all logic and no passion,
(or at least his passion was science, which isn't reflected
in the work) I had a husband like that once,
but if Bacon did not write the works of William Shakespeare,
then it is my opinion that the scope of his knowledge alone
suggests that WS would find Bacon like a moth to the flame.
Whether they liked each other or agreed with each other, or not,
they would not be able to resist each other.

Recall that Bacon was a friend of Edward Alleyn, and served
as one of the trustees of the Dulwich Foundation. There is nothing
like that for William Shakespeare, and there should have been.
It's a mystery.

I wasn't discussing relevance, I was discussing sentence construction.
Einstein has no relevance to the Shakespeare question, but your

Why not something more mundane like &quot;stage hand&quot; or &quot;prop manager&quot;?

More to the point, I have never seen any evidence that Elizabethan
theatre companies even employed any such person as the &quot;the factotum who
toted scenery around between acts&quot;; for all I know, that function may
well have been performed by the actors themselves. I hope that someone
like Dave Kathman, who actually *knows* about the history of the
Elizabethan stage, will chime more authoritatively on the subject.

But even if such a post existed (for which I know of no evidence),
there is no reason to surmise that he was called a &quot;shake-scene.&quot; The

secretary, not a letter-drafter or a pen-pusher.

&gt; I spent a fruitless 2 hours among the authorities this morning without

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If this inquiry were

&gt;&gt; However, Elizabeth *still*, a year and a half later, has not furnished

&gt;&gt; Einsteinian theories, you're quite right that a scrupulous

Me:
&gt; Excellent! Then perhaps Elizabeth Weird can scrupulously
&gt; cite the source for her ridiculous assertion that
&gt;
&gt;&quot;The term 'shake-scene' was Elizabethan theatre slang for the
&gt; factotum who toted scenery around between acts.&quot;

Elizabeth:
Even the OED doesn't know where that came from, Webb.

[Then how can you possibly know that &quot;The term 'shake-scene' was
Elizabethan theatre slang for the factotum who toted scenery around
between acts&quot;?]

It
mentions Greene but doesn't have a definition.

[Then how can you possibly know that &quot;The term 'shake-scene' was
Elizabethan theatre slang for the factotum who toted scenery around

The best it can
do is break its own rules and refer to Jonson's 'shake the stage'
in the mock Eulogy, a reference in advance of the first use.

There is no &quot;manipulation&quot; here; I have seen a sample of Christine's
posts, and while I might not agree with everything that she says, I have
not seen the slightest indication that she would state an invention or

evidence whatever, so there is simply nothing to examine.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth's practice is bad enough in the present case, but it is
&gt;&gt; especially unconscionable in those frequent instances in which Elizabeth
&gt;&gt; not only states bizarre factoids as facts (without any evidence), but
&gt;&gt; actually makes vile accusations of fraud, intellectual dishonesty,
&gt;&gt; racism, etc. (without any evidence, of course).

&gt;&gt; There is such a thing
&gt;&gt; as integrity,
&gt; Where was your integrity when you were savaging John Baker?

"/>

Huh? My integrity was never questioned. It was Baker whose bogus
claims (in at least three forums) that he possessed a doctoral degree
were exposed as fradulent. Moreover, that discovery was made not by me
but by Tom Reedy, who made contact with the university in question and
ascertained that no such degree was ever conferred upon Baker, and the
latter even confessed his imposture. There is such a thing as
integrity, and it entails, among other things, not arrogating bogus
credentials that one does not possess.

certainly did not think so:

&gt; egregious example, with its plethora of inferences and conjectures
&gt; stated as facts, and disgusting attempts to read more into
&gt; something than may actually exist without addressing that issue
&gt; in the body of the essay; a case in point being
&gt; the implication of the importance of the ordering of names on a list,
&gt; without discussing alternative arguments for said importance,
&gt; leading to the conclusion that they believe that
&gt; the hypothetical intelligent reader is actually quite stupid.
&gt; This does not mean that I don't think that William Of Stratford
&gt; wrote the Works of William Shakespeare.
&gt; It does mean that their methodology raises the question that
&gt; R &amp; K themselves suspect that W o S may not be the author,
&gt; and they are playing mind games for their personal amusement.
&gt; My personal problem with William Of Stratford is one of
&gt; evidence for motivation/inspiration, access to source material,
&gt; and a mentor, or lack thereof. W o S as actor is easy.
&gt; W o S as author appears derived out of whole cloth.

&gt; In fairness, I note that the proponents of Oxford, Bacon &amp; Marlowe
&gt; often engage in similar tactics, intended to obfuscate and mislead.
&gt; Oxford is my least favourite candidate.

You should compare notes with Art, who has opined that Marlowe is his

Yes, Peter Farey's work is a happy exception to much of the nonsense

survival does not imply his authorship of the canon, and Peter's

&gt; Bacon appears to be a bit of a stick, all logic and no passion,

&gt; in the work) I had a husband like that once,
&gt; but if Bacon did not write the works of William Shakespeare,
&gt; then it is my opinion that the scope of his knowledge alone
&gt; suggests that WS would find Bacon like a moth to the flame.
&gt; Whether they liked each other or agreed with each other, or not,
&gt; they would not be able to resist each other.

&gt; Recall that Bacon was a friend of Edward Alleyn, and served

&gt; but your
&gt; position on Einstein gives me pause. I'd genuinely like to know
&gt; the sources of your opinion,

"/>

Since Elizabeth believes both that the theory was wrong *and* that it
was plagiarized, the source would appear to be an inexplicable
anti-Einstein animus. Elizabeth herself has explained it pretty clearly:

&quot;The source of my critique of Einstein's STR, Webb, is a
program I did in philosophy that pitted the British empricists
against the German Idealists. I came to 'not admire' the German
Idealists.

&quot;Einstein was a self-admitted German Idealist and the German
Idealists (i.e., the German Aesthetics movement in physics)
embraced Einstein's theory not only because of its simplicity
and aesthetic beauty but because Einstein's theory is intrinsically
authoritarian. I'll deconstruct the STR rhetoric in another post.
German Idealism was the official philosophy of the Third Reich
(plenty of scholarship on that point).&quot;

&lt;&gt;

[That the Third Reich harshly repudiated Einstein and what it viewed as
his &quot;Jewish physics&quot; does not appear to be familiar to Elizabeth. Nor
does Elizabeth appear to be aware that the correctness of a scientific
theory is ultimately gauged empirically, by experiment and observation,
not by assessing the political correctness or lack thereof of the
theorist's philosophical enthusiasms.]

&gt;&gt;&gt; Southampton is wearing a theatrical wig.
&gt;&gt; Is this merely a speculative suggestion, diffidently proferred for
&gt;&gt; what it's worth? Or is this yet another of Elizabeth's &quot;facts&quot;?
&gt; I know you have a very serious problem with any statement that
&gt; isn't derived from authority but it is permissible, Webb, to draw
&gt; conclusions from deductions based on direct observations.

"/>

That is not an answer to my question: is this a speculative
suggestion, or is it something that you hallucinate is an established
fact?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn't notice it before because I took it for granted that
&gt;&gt;&gt; Southampton was wearing his own hair in a feminine style
&gt;&gt;&gt; but I was thinking about that particular hair style with rows
&gt;&gt;&gt; of little curls framing his face. Those curls are very hard
&gt;&gt;&gt; to create unless the hair is very curly and somewhat coarse
&gt;&gt;&gt; to begin with. You have to roll the hair around something
&gt;&gt;&gt; and pin it from both sides and you end up with a pound and
&gt;&gt;&gt; a half of hairpins on your head.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No straight hair could be put into that style without glue.

&gt;&gt;&gt; On the other hand, those rows of small curls are easy to do
&gt;&gt;&gt; in wigs where curls made from purchased hair--it would still
&gt;&gt;&gt; have to be naturally curly--can be pinned or stitched to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; foundation of the wig. .

&gt;&gt;&gt; In his fine portrait done about 1615, Southampton's hair is
&gt;&gt;&gt; slightly wavy but with that hair style, slightly wavy is as same
&gt;&gt;&gt; as straight.
&gt;&gt; Is this intended to be English?
&gt; You have abysmal manners.

"/>

Be that as it may, my manners are better than your English. (In
fact, I am reasonably polite to interlocutors who don't hurl wanton and
unsupported accusations of fraud, racism, etc.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Furthermore, Southampton is described as having strawberry
&gt;&gt;&gt; blond hair. Light golden red. His hair was one of his most
&gt;&gt;&gt; striking features and it was still an amazing, although darker,
&gt;&gt;&gt; shade of red when he was in his forties.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The wig is sort of a brownish-blond.

"/>

Or, perhaps the painter was not particularly good at mixing
colors...or, perhaps the passge of four centuries has altered the
original pigments. It certainly does *not* follow from Elizabeth's
farcically subjective impressions that Southampton was wearing a wig.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have one further point.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thinking about the theatrical wig and the fact that it is not
&gt;&gt;&gt; Southampton's real hair,
&gt;&gt; Has Elizabeth actually *established* this?!
&gt; Yes. It can be established by logic. Southampton's hair
&gt; was red and almost straight. His hair in the portrait is light
&gt; brown and very curly.

"/>

*Amazing*! Elizabeth *actually believes* (or says she does, at any
rate) that she has *established as fact* that Southampton is wearing a
wig! An assertion like that makes one wonder whether Elizabeth's whole
Usenet persona might not be a Neuendorffer-style troll!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; His hair is in a style commonly found
&gt; in Elizabethan wigs. That's a string of logical inferences.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I realized that Southampton would
&gt;&gt;&gt; not have himself portrayed as a woman.
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth's insight into Southampton's thoughts is indeed remarkable.
&gt; I don't have to read Southampton's mind. I only have to know
&gt; the rules of male amity.

"/>

This just gets funnier and funnier!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; The earls were the English warrior class and Essex and
&gt;&gt;&gt; Southampton modeled their 'amity friendship' after
&gt;&gt;&gt; Achilles and Patroclus.

"/>

Evidence?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Having himself painted as a (devalued)
&gt;&gt;&gt; female would be antithetical to the Petrarchan ideal of
&gt;&gt;&gt; pure platonic (male only) love.
&gt;&gt; What &quot;Petrarchan ideal of pure platonic (male only) love&quot;?
&gt; The English aristocrats who did the Grand Tour brought the
&gt; Italian Renaissance back with them. Platonic friendships
&gt; were popular at the Italian courts and the English imitated
&gt; them and wrote Italian sonnets to each other. The Shakespeare
&gt; Sonnets are part of this courly phenomenon and of course
&gt; they weren't written by an actor who decided to go back to
&gt; Stratford and become trader in corn and hay.

&gt; The most intensely passionate but unconsumated love
&gt; was reserved for two males engaged in an amity friendship
&gt; while lust was reserved for relationships with women. The
&gt; relationship in the Shakespeare Sonnets typify that convention.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Southampton could, however, legitimately commission a portrait
&gt;&gt;&gt; of himself as a female character from one of the Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt; plays without violating the rules of amity friendship [sic] or
&gt;&gt;&gt; scandalizing
&gt;&gt;&gt; society.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Best regards,

You're quibbling for the sake of quibbling again, Dr. Quibbles.

Einstein's 'Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies' is, for example,

purely 'speculative suggestion'

as you put it because Einstein doesn't furnish a fact of his own
in the entire paper--only a priori speculation posited as fact.

In fact I'm challenging you to produce a

list of facts

taken from the STR paper (Maxwell's facts will be excluded)
and I, in turn will show how few facts, if any, Einstein really
developed.

Einstein insisted that his theory wasn't physics but his
assertion was such a non sequitur in the sense that it's
the
'reigning theory of physics'

that even Heisenberg didn't get it until Einstein shouted 'it's
an aesthetic, you dummkoft, an aesthetic!' Or something similar.

You and I, Webb, will prove Einstein right.

This will be a corrective exercise for you because you're
so ignorant of empirical method and logic that you can't even
see that I was making inferences from direct observation which
I will (successfully) defend in a separate post.

You had better get used to it if you plan on defending her. This is nothing

Those who argue that antiStratfordianism is a form of mental illness have
the example of Elizabeth Weir always at hand. She, Streitz and Crowley are

You're the one who likes to lecture us on facts, and

&gt; A genius wrote the Shakespeare works.

&gt; Therefore Marlowe (Oxford) wrote the Shakespeare works.

&gt; Part II--the hard part--of the Marlovian-Oxfordian argument
&gt; is proving that Marlowe and Oxford were genius enough
&gt; to write the works assigned to them.

&gt; None of Marlowe's works received his name in his lifetime--
&gt; a very curious thing since he was not under the aristocratic
&gt; stima of print--which is an historical fact--so by claiming Marlowe's
&gt; authorship of what looks like Shakespeare's apprenticeship as
&gt; a playwright, Marlovians are, in the authorship dispute at least,
&gt; then required to prove that Marlowe was genius enough to write
&gt; the Marlowe works.
So I wrote:

"/>

1. As a boy, Marlowe was given a scholarship to Kings School for &quot;boys
who could read Latin, write verse and sing plainsong.&quot;

2. He was given an Archbishop Parker scholarship to Cambridge.

3. Contemporaries: Peele, Drayton, Blount and Thorpe testify to
Marley's genius.

4. His 1992 Latin dedicatory epistle to the Countess of Pembroke
(signed C.M.) of Thomas Watson's book, promises committed to high
culture, hence no name on Tamburlaine.

5. Dido was printed in 1594, by Nashe and Marlo.

6. Lucan's First Book and Hero and Leander registered in Sept. 1593.
Both were published a few years later.

As you know, (the concealed author) Shakespeare was best known as a
poet until 1598. As you also know, Christopher Marlowe was best known
as a poet. But Bacon, though a genius, leaves behind no evidence of
being a (very good) poet. Marlowe is a better alternative candidate
than Bacon because he himself had written some very impressive
narrative poems, and writing rhymed and formally metrical and
rhetorical poetry is no mean feat, as you know.

Questions for further study:
1. Who else had access to the Strachey letter?
2. If FB was &quot;Shakespeare&quot; can you suggest what his relationship may
have been to the (dead) poet-dramatist Christopher Marlowe, from whom
the author of Romeo and Juliet and the narrative poems borrowed so
much? What involvement (if any) did FB have in CM's fate?

Hoping for fruitful discussion,

I cannot resolve the origin of the term shake-scene from any textual
citation, having scanned back 100 years to about 1500. I therefore think
that Greene was punning on the forword 'Shak[e]' which does have an A. Sax
precedent, and is still in common use: eg. &quot;to do something in a brace of
shakes&quot;.

Shake meaning fast, expeditious.

&quot;Thei wente a nobull schakke&quot;
/Hunttyng of the Hare.
&quot;Schokkes in with a schakke&quot;
/Morte Arthure

Shake also means: to dance.
Shekir: the game of chess

It seems that Greene may have coined his term from any and all of the above,
even the chessic reference (to move the pieces around the boards!)

What was interesting through the entire investigation was that my
presumption of finding another tag for the activity of those &quot;charged with
bringing out and putting away the properties&quot; in Schelling's phrase, as
preposterously longwinded, was false.

Cordially, Phil Innes

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Why not something more mundane like &quot;stage hand&quot; or &quot;prop manager&quot;?

&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it would be interesting in someone could surface either of
&gt; those
&gt;&gt; (modern sounding) options in a text.

&gt; So I had an intuition David that the normally verbose Schelling would
offer
&gt; an alternate term, and off did trot to substantiate the point from English
&gt; Drama (1914).

&gt; After much rooting around I actually find him describing how actors
&gt; supplemented their time as aprentices:-

&gt;&quot;...charged with bringing out and putting away the properties...&quot; is his
&gt; phrase.

&gt; Now, my assumption is that if there were a word for such an activity he
&gt; would have cited it. Therefore, he ignores the posibility of 'shake-scene'
&gt; and any other term of description.

&gt; I also consulted Debanke (1953) on pure stagecraft of the Elizabethan
&gt; theatre, nothing indexed, and nothing in supplementary activities of
actors.

&gt; I am currently looking a bit deeper into anglo-saxon terms - there are a
&gt; good number to consider - but finding topical text citations is difficult.

No, I am asking a very simple, direct question: do you actually
imagine that your assertion above is *established fact*, or do you
acknowledge that it is merely another instance of your usual wanton
speculation?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; and I, in turn will show how few facts, if any, Einstein really
&gt;&gt; developed.

"/>

The most interesting fact established in Einstein's paper is that
from two very simple postulates -- the principle of relativity and the
experimental observation (from interferometry) that the velocity of
light is the same relative to all inertial frames -- one can deduce in a
beautifully simple way the Lorentz invariance of Maxwell's equations.
This was a remarkable insight -- while Lorentz had noticed the Lorentz
invariance of Maxwell's equations, his transformations appeared _ad hoc_
and unmotivated, they conflicted irreconcilably with the Galiliean
transformations of Newtonian mechanics, and as a consequence Lorentz
ascribed only a mathematical and not a *physical* meaning to them.

If you mean that Einstein's paper contained no new *experimental*
observations (one really must wonder what you mean by the word &quot;fact,&quot;
since you apparently believe that Southampton's putative performance of
female roles on stage qualifies as one), then that is correct, but
utterly trivial; it is quite commonplace for papers in theoretical
physics to contain no new experimental facts.

Einstein possessed a native speaker's fluency in German, so I very

No, any ignorance of empirical method must be laid squarely at your

relativity, *not* because of any empirical evidence but rather because
you view the theory as &quot;dystopian&quot; and because you regard Einstein as
influenced by the German idealist philosophers. It does *not matter*
whether Einstein derived his inspiration from German idealists or from a
fervent belief in the Easter Bunny or the Great Pumpkin -- all that
matters is that his theory passes the rigorous, exacting empirical tests
to which it has been subjected for nearly a century. Indeed, your
ignorance of science and the scientific method is so profound that I

Specific Objection:

You are not qualified to debate the *facts*
concerning STR or GTR, unless and until you state
the extent of your mathematical education,
as you cannot read and understand the source material
well enough to enter into a debate concerning it.

If I understand your former posts correctly,
it is your contention that you object to Einstein
being given credit for his contribution
on purely philosophical grounds.
This has nothing to do with whether the math is correct.
I have some calculus and some physics, enough to know
that I'm not qualified to have an opinion.
You may have misunderstood the reference to &quot;aesethics,&quot;
in the context of the debate, because
the word addresses the elegance (&quot;simplicity&quot;)
of the proposed equations in addressing the problem (relativity).

I note that David has made several posts to h.l.a.s.
in the past few days, but has declined to post to this thread.
I hope he will continue to do so.

You still have not replied to my request for information
concerning the content of the syllabus and the identities
of the educators involved in the curriculum
from which you drew your conclusion.
How can I respond if I don't know what they said?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No, I've objected to the failure to distinguish
facts from conjecture and/or inference,

and

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I certainly have no reason to object to that,

Thank you. Others will disagree, I'm sure, because
there is much discussion of your tendency to propose
statements as *fact*, when they are actually inference
or conjecture. As has been previously pointed out,
it's okay to infer, just please say so at the time.
It keeps everyone honest.

but I'm puzzled by

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I am embarrassed *for* you, not *by* you.

As I said, if David stated FACTS,
you wouldn't understand them,
because you (apparently) don't understand the language
in which the facts are stated; mathematics.
Einstein, Lorentz, and Poincare were qualified
to disagree with each other. YOU are not.

I've already stated my position on the authorship question
in another post. I am curious, however, to learn from the
contributors whether, if it were conclusively demonstrated
that Marlowe WAS alive after 1593,
how many of you would alter your position
on the authorship question and why,
(the issue could be posed alternately as
&quot;If you were forced to advocate a different person as
the author, who would you choose, and why?&quot;)
but these are probably more appropriate questions for a
different thread. (part of the mind-altering education

"/>

No, it's indiffidently proffered for what it is.

You claimed in an earlier post that Southampton was not wearing
a 'brown wig,' but the portrait had merely 'faded.'

You claimed that Southampton's natural light blond-red hair had
faded to 'light brown.

We can deduce--at least I can deduce--you apparently don't
know basic logic--from a knowledge of primary colors and pigments
that the brown hair shown in Southampton's portrait is a wig and
not Southampton's own hair.

[snip of Webb's insults]

The color 'brown' is a combination of THREE PRIMARY COLORS,
red, yellow and blue.

In painting, unless you're a purist who mixes from only pure
primary pigments (some painters do) you mix

RED + GREEN (yellow and blue) = BROWN.

Southampton's famous hair was an astonishing 'strawberry
blond' or light blond hair with a touch of red pigment in it.

There is no way that Southampton's own light blond-red hair,
could (quote) 'fade back to brown' in a 'faded' painting (you forgot
to show proof that the portrait is faded) because there was no blue
pigment in Southampton's own light blond-red hair.

Had there been any blue pigment in Southampton's own hair,
his hair would have been ash blond or light brown. We know
from A.L. Rowse and others that it was not.

If the portrait is faded--and I doubt it is--Southampton's own
hair could only fade to pinkish or light orange tones. The
painting did not darken because it was not kept in the city
where it would be exposed to chemical pollutants (worst in
the Victorian era of coal burning) but at a country house
on a wall going up a staircase. It was clearly not hung over
a sooty fireplace. For Southampton's hair to chemically darken
to brown, the whole painting would have to darken.

The purchased hair in the wig has a more blue pigment but
less red pigment that Southampton's own hair so it wouldn't
darken to such a yellowish brown.

Did you cite an 'established fact' when you claimed that the wig was

'brown' because the painting had faded?

I count three unsubstantiated claims in your single sentence, Webb.

You have no knowledge that it's not a wig, you don't know that
the portrait is faded, and you don't know what colors a faded
brown wig would fade to in the event that the painting was faded.

I call that licentiously wanton speculation.

Dectuctive logic is not 'wanton speculation.' It may
be erroneous but logic is not wanton.

You can't miss when the light constant is a fiddle, Webb. Hsu

&gt; We can deduce--at least I can deduce--you apparently don't

&gt; that the brown hair shown in Southampton's portrait is a wig and
&gt; not Southampton's own hair.

&gt; [snip of Webb's insults]

&gt; The color 'brown' is a combination of THREE PRIMARY COLORS,
&gt; red, yellow and blue.

&gt; In painting, unless you're a purist who mixes from only pure
&gt; primary pigments (some painters do) you mix

&gt; RED + GREEN (yellow and blue) = BROWN.

&gt; Southampton's famous hair was an astonishing 'strawberry
&gt; blond' or light blond hair with a touch of red pigment in it.

&gt; There is no way that Southampton's own light blond-red hair,

&gt;&gt;&gt; My first inclination is embarrassment at the sight of this post,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but &quot;oh WELL....&quot;

&gt;&gt; I'd like to hear your specific objections to my request that
&gt;&gt; Webb come up with a list of facts from the STR.

&gt; Specific Objection:

&gt; You are not qualified to debate the *facts*
&gt; concerning STR or GTR, unless and until you state
&gt; the extent of your mathematical education,

"/>

That's an illogical statement as well as an offensive
statement.

What you're probably trying to say is that I'm not
qualified to debate the STR and the GTR unless
I've completed a certain level of college math but
what you've actually said is that I only have 'state' my
'mathematical education' to qualify to debate the
STR or GTR.

That's the illogical part.

The offensive part is your authoritarian tone, lady.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; as you cannot read and understand the source material
&gt; well enough to enter into a debate concerning it.

"/>

If you can't put together a logical sentence, I'm not sure
that you're qualified to make that judgment.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If I understand your former posts correctly,
&gt; it is your contention that you object to Einstein
&gt; being given credit for his contribution
&gt; on purely philosophical grounds.

"/>

Not exactly.

It's my contention that Einstein be given credit on purely
philosophical grounds for his contribution.

Einstein stated that his theory was an aesthetics theory.
Everyone keeps treating it as an explanatory theory of
physics. It's not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This has nothing to do with whether the math is correct.

"/>

The math is correct. The math is perfect. That's why
Webb is right when he says that the STR has been
'proven thousands of times (but only on the quantum
level). This is a theory that can't miss and Hsu discovered
the reason for it.

Einstein's universal light constant creates relative time--everybody
understands this--but Einstein was using the frequency of his light
constant to measure the relative time the light constant created.
Incestuous to say the least. Everything measured with this always
comes out with the right answer.

Hsu simply tossed out Einstein's Second Postulate and moved
on to make a single postulate relativity which he calls Taiji
relativity.

Webb, for some reason, thinks that Hsu is devoted to Einsteinian
relativity.

&lt; .

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I have some calculus and some physics, enough to know
&gt; that I'm not qualified to have an opinion.

"/>

LOL. You might not be qualified to give an opinion to
a dissertation committee composed of professiors of physics
but this is HLAS and Webb is a loon.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You may have misunderstood the reference to &quot;aesethics,&quot;
&gt; in the context of the debate, because
&gt; the word addresses the elegance (&quot;simplicity&quot;)
&gt; of the proposed equations in addressing the problem (relativity).

"/>

No. I studied aesthetics so I had no problem in penetrating
the delusions of the German idealist school of aesthetics.
I just wrote a post referring to 'simplicity' as the chief criteria
of the German idealists. I assume most of them were sentenced
at Nuremburg.

The STR, on the other hand, is too operational to have aesthetic
'elegance.' It's the little toy shop on Die Kernbombenstraße.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I note that David has made several posts to h.l.a.s.
&gt; in the past few days, but has declined to post to this thread.
&gt; I hope he will continue to do so.

"/>

Really, who cares. Webb admitts that he cuts and pastes
the texts of his posts. If you stay in HLAS any length
of time--anything over a day or two--you'll be seeing the same
old cut and paste posts rolling by.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You still have not replied to my request for information
&gt; concerning the content of the syllabus and the identities
&gt; of the educators involved in the curriculum

My conclusion, Christine, is that you're way out of line
in demanding that I put my personal information on the
Internet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How can I respond if I don't know what they said?

I'm still hoping that this is your idea of a joke.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; You're the one who likes to lecture us on facts,

&gt; No, I've objected to the failure to distinguish

"/>

Since you're a Marlovian and there are no facts of
Marlowe's authorship I'm not sure you know what
you're talking about when you use the term 'fact'
and 'inference.'

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; of your tendency to propose
&gt; statements as *fact*, when they are actually inference

&gt; It keeps everyone honest.

"/>

Debate is a better analogy for this forum than a thesis
paper or a legal brief.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; but I'm puzzled by
&gt;&gt; your embarassment when I ask Webb to show facts to support his
&gt;&gt; assertions about the STR.

&gt; I am embarrassed *for* you, not *by* you.

"/>

Well now you're both.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; you wouldn't understand them,
&gt; because you (apparently) don't understand the language

Unfortunately, since Dr. Webb didn't suggest &quot;fading&quot;, you were merely
engaging in a dishonest quibble; since you haven't been alive for

&gt;&gt;&gt; Webb come up with a list of facts from the STR.
&gt;&gt; Specific Objection:

&gt;&gt; You are not qualified to debate the *facts*
&gt;&gt; concerning STR or GTR, unless and until you state
&gt;&gt; the extent of your mathematical education,
&gt; That's an illogical statement as well as an offensive
&gt; statement.

"/>

Elizabeth may find the assertion that she is farcically unqualified
offensive; unfortunately, offensive or not, it is true.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What you're probably trying to say is that I'm not
&gt; qualified to debate the STR and the GTR unless
&gt; I've completed a certain level of college math but
&gt; what you've actually said is that I only have 'state' my
&gt; 'mathematical education' to qualify to debate the
&gt; STR or GTR.

"/>

Since Elizabeth is mathematically illiterate, the distinction is
unimportant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That's the illogical part.

&gt; The offensive part is your authoritarian tone, lady.

Elizabeth has a conspicuous habit of labeling those who ask her to
furnish evidence or sources as &quot;authoritarian.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; as you cannot read and understand the source material
&gt;&gt; well enough to enter into a debate concerning it.
&gt; If you can't put together a logical sentence, I'm not sure
&gt; that you're qualified to make that judgment.

The irony here could scarcely be richer!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If I understand your former posts correctly,
&gt;&gt; it is your contention that you object to Einstein
&gt;&gt; being given credit for his contribution
&gt;&gt; on purely philosophical grounds.
&gt; Not exactly.

&gt; It's my contention that Einstein be given credit on purely
&gt; philosophical grounds for his contribution.

&gt; Einstein stated that his theory was an aesthetics theory.
&gt; Everyone keeps treating it as an explanatory theory of
&gt; physics. It's not.

"/>

Of course it is. It gives a beautifully simple explanation of the
observed Lorentz invariance of Maxwell's equations, an observation that
otherwise seemed bewilderingly _ad hoc_ and unmotivated (and moreover
violated the Galilean relativity of Newtonian mechanics).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; This has nothing to do with whether the math is correct.
&gt; The math is correct. The math is perfect. That's why
&gt; Webb is right when he says that the STR has been
&gt; 'proven thousands of times

"/>

Then why did Elizabeth assert earlier that there were experimental
results *violating* special relativity? Elizabeth wrote:

&quot;Aether isn't all that discredited. A group of qualified
phyicists have been going through Michelson and Morely's
calculations and have found mathematical errors indicating
that Michelson and Morely found a weak aether effect.&quot;

&lt;&gt;

In the same post, Elizabeth also wrote:

&quot;Did you read about the cesium cell experiment done at Princeton
a year or so ago? The Princeton physicists don't have a theory
for the phenomena they produced. They admit, like Stephanie, that
'they're still loooooking.'

Of course, the physicists in question say nothing of the sort; Elizabeth
is fabricating bogus quotations again! Elizabeth can read about the
experiment of Wang, Kuzmich, and Dogariu in many places, among them at
Arthur Dogariu's own web page,

&lt;&gt;;

there she will find the following:

&quot;Our experiment is *not* at odds with Einstein¹s special
relativity. The experiment can be well explained using existing
physics theories that are consistent with Relativity. In fact,
the experiment was designed based on calculations using existing
physics theories.&quot;

&lt;&gt;

Never content to leave any doubt whatsoever about her own farcical
incompetence, Elizabeth continues:

&quot;Aether theory describes why a strand of light wave would
accelerate inside a cesium cell but also explains why an incoherent
totally collapsed wave would instantly become coherent as it emerges
from the cell. !!&quot;

&quot;The 'levitation' experiments conducted in Finland succumb to the
same explanation as the cesium cell experiment.&quot;

One wonders where on earth Elizabeth imbibes such complete claptrap.

Yes, Elizabeth has indeed misunderstood the reference to aesthetics.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; No. I studied aesthetics so I had no problem in penetrating

&gt; I just wrote a post referring to 'simplicity' as the chief criteria
&gt; of the German idealists. I assume most of them were sentenced
&gt; at Nuremburg.

"/>

Elizabeth's astounding ignorance of history is truly boundless! The
most important philospohers generally identified with the German
Idealist &quot;movement&quot; are Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, with whom
the movement is widely considered to have reached its culmination. Kant
was born in 1724, so even a complete mathematical incompetent like
Elizabeth ought to be able to work out how old Kant would have to have
been to have been in the dock at Nuremberg in 1945! (In fact, Kant died
in 1804, almost a century and a half prior to the Nuremberg trials.)
Fichte died in 1814, still roughly a century prior to the *first* world
war (let alone the second). Schelling died in 1854, and Hegel in 1831.
None of these men even came close to seeing the dawn of the twentieth
century, let alone the horrors of National Socialism. So much for what
Elizabeth &quot;assumes.&quot;

Elizabeth's abysmal ignorance of German Idealism makes it fairly
clear that she understands those philosophers no better than she does
relativity, linguistics, and the numerous other fields in which she has
displayed her incompetence. The irrational roots of her bizarre animus
toward Einstein become clearer all the time, and as usual in her case,
the main root cause is apparently sheer ignorance.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I did not see Christine's post, or I might indeed have refrained from

Nobody is going to take Elizabeth seriously even if she does so.
Indeed, in view of some of Elizabeth's pronouncements -- e.g., her

century(!) -- it is hard to imagine what, if anything, would suffice in
order that her &quot;expertise&quot; be taken seriously.

Huh? If Elizabeth herself traces her anti-Einstein animus to some
course or seminar on the German Idealists, then it is certainly not
unreasonable for Christine to inquire about the syllabus and curriculum
of that seminar. Of course, Elizabeth's remarkable assertion &quot;I assume
most of them [the German Idealists] were sentenced at Nuremburg&quot; is
quite sufficient ...

&gt; We can deduce--at least I can deduce--you apparently don't

&gt; not Southampton's own hair.

&gt; [snip of Webb's insults]

&gt; The color 'brown' is a combination of THREE PRIMARY COLORS,
&gt; red, yellow and blue.

&gt; In painting, unless you're a purist who mixes from only pure
&gt; primary pigments (some painters do) you mix

&gt; RED + GREEN (yellow and blue) = BROWN.

Not necessarily. Some basic pigments widely used in Renaissance
painting already had a brownish cast (burnt umber, yellow ochre, and
burnt sienna, for example). These pigments were ground directly from
naturally occurring minerals, not mixed from primary pigments. in fact,
Renaissance painters often used a palette of pigments other than the
three primary colors.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Southampton's famous hair was an astonishing 'strawberry

Source? You have never seen Southampton's hair color, nor has anyone
else presently alive. (However, you never let such minor obstacles
stand in the way of a vivid hallucination.) The only sources presently
available are written accounts (which are pretty useless for the purpose
of ascertaining whether Southampton was wearing a wig in a particular
portrait) and other portraits, which may well not have been executed
with strict fidelity in the matter of Southampton's hair color in the
first place, and which may well be discolored themselves after the
passage of four centuries. Matters being so, *nobody* really knows with
any assurance what Southampton's hair looked like, and it is folly of
the highest order to infer that, because you don't think that his hair
color matches what you have seen or hallucinated elsewhere, he must have
been wearing a wig when he sat for the portrait in question.

However, your ensuing folly eclipses even the nonsense in which you
engage above. I refer, of course, to your apparent belief that *any* of
this farcical fantasy about Shouthampton's hair color serves as credible
evidence for your original assertion that

&quot;Southampton was overly fond of drag and used to hang about the
theatres hoping to play female roles. He was given a few parts

&gt; the Victorian era of coal burning) but at a country house

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're quibbling for the sake of quibbling again, Dr. Quibbles.
&gt;&gt; No, I am asking a very simple, direct question: do you actually
&gt;&gt; imagine that your assertion above is *established fact*, or do you
&gt;&gt; acknowledge that it is merely another instance of your usual wanton
&gt;&gt; speculation?
&gt; Did you cite an 'established fact' when you claimed that the wig was
&gt; Southampton's natural hair and that the pigment in the portrait was
&gt; 'brown' because the painting had faded?

"/>

First, I did not acknowledge the existence of any wig; that is
strictly your invention. Second, if you imagine that a wig made from
Southampton's own hair would not accurately reflect Southampton's hair
color, then you clearly have not thought this matter through. Third, I
have not asserted that the portrait depicts Southampton's natural hair
either; rather, I have merely noted that your &quot;argument&quot; that he is
wearing a theatrical wig is idiotic. I do not pretend to know whether
the portrait depicts Southampton's natural hair (although it seems
likely that it does), and I marvel that you pretend to know. There
simply is not adequate evidence on which to base such a conclusion.
Fourth, I did not assert that the painting had &quot;faded&quot;; that is strictly
your invention. Rather, I noted that even if the sitter wore no wig,
the painting might not reflect his natural hair color for a variety of
possible reasons, among them the following: (1) the artist may not have
captured his hair color with much fidelity in the first place, and (2)
even if the painter did so, the painting may have discolored with age.
I might add that even if the painter matched the shade exactly and the
painting has not discolored at all, the painter was merely recording the
appearance of Southampton's hair in a particular season and under
particular conditions of ambient light. Hair color can change
seasonally depending upon exposure to the sun (no doubt you will claim
next that Southampton *always* wore a hat outdoors!), and a person's
hair can appear very different in different light (e.g., my sister's
hair appears brown in some light but auburn and even read in some
outdoor light).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I count three unsubstantiated claims in your single sentence, Webb.

"/>

That's because, as noted above, you invented every one of them!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You have no knowledge that it's not a wig,

Nor did I claim such knowledge. You are the one that made the claim
that Southampton was wearing a theatrical wig, and evidently you can
furnish no persuasive evidence other than your own subjective impression
-- as usual.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

quotations you attributed to me are fabricated.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and you don't know what colors a faded

&gt; I call that licentiously wanton speculation.

&gt; Dectuctive [sic] logic is not 'wanton speculation.' It may

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Einstein's 'Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies' is, for example,

&gt; One of the arguments against the aging of this painting is that

&gt;&gt;&gt; RED + GREEN (yellow and blue) = BROWN.

&gt;&gt; naturally occurring minerals, not mixed from primary pigments. in fact,

&gt;&gt; began my post, so I'll ask it again:

&gt;&gt;&quot;We also have Jonson ridiculing the actor in EMOHH in which he

&gt;&gt;&quot;A 'punto' is a term from sword-fighting so you have punto (sword)
&gt;&gt; and volo (will) a play on 'will sword' or 'will spear.'&quot;

&gt;&gt; I repeat: In what language do you imagine that &quot;Puntarvolo&quot; means &quot;will
&gt;&gt; spear&quot;?

&gt; I repeat: Where's your list of facts taken from Einstein's
&gt; STR paper (Maxwell's facts don't count)?

&gt; Punto is Italian and volo is Latin/Italian. We're not
&gt; discussing a serious literary work, Webb. EMOHH is
&gt; SATIRE.

&gt; Jonson was a satirist and the further the
&gt; audience has to reach to get the two parts of the
&gt; metaphor, the stronger the shock of recognition will be.

&gt; Everyone would be familiar with fencing terminology
&gt; because all upper class Elizabethan men--possibly not clerics--
&gt; wore swords and every educated Elizabethan knew Latin.

&gt; The pun on 'punto' would not be missed because in some scenes
&gt; the character Puntarvolo the knight is a take off on Don Quixote
&gt; who makes the same chivalrous speeches, probably stolen from
&gt; the novel. Don Quixote tilted at windmills with his lance.

&gt; The name 'Puntarvolo' would not be lost on the cognoscenti who
&gt; knew that some illiterate hustler from Stratford was not writing

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it's indiffidently proffered for what it is.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You claimed in an earlier post that Southampton was not wearing
&gt;&gt;&gt; a 'brown wig,' but the portrait had merely 'faded.'

&gt;&gt; The post can be found at

&gt;&gt; 40merrimack.dartmouth.edu&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;output=gplain&gt;;

&gt;&gt; you can check for yourself (or if not, you can get someone to read it to
&gt;&gt; you) that the word &quot;faded&quot; does not occur anywhere therein. In the
&gt;&gt; prior post, I wrote:

&gt; You wrote DIS-COLORED.

&gt; There's no discoloration at all on that portrait. It's in remarkable
&gt; condition.

&gt;&lt;http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Observer/documents/2002/04/20/o... .&gt;

&gt; And I proved that even if it were faded the artist's rendering of
&gt; Southampton's own hair color would not fade to brown because
&gt; Southampton had no blue pigment in his hair. It was not a rusty red.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Or, perhaps the painter was not particularly good at mixing
&gt;&gt; colors...or, perhaps the passge [SIIIIIIIIIIC] of four centuries has
&gt;&gt; altered the original pigments.

&gt; There are color tests in the painting. Southampton had blue
&gt; eyes. The sitter's eyes are blue. His lips are red.

&gt; One of the arguments against the aging of this painting is that
&gt; the color is perfect;u even throughout the painting. There is no
&gt; fading or darkening from left to right or top to bottom. The
&gt; background is darker behind the left side (frontal view) of
&gt; Southampton's head but that's typical technique in painting to
&gt; show the light source which is customarily from the right.

&gt; The painting is in perfect condition as far as I can see.
&gt; ___________________________________________________

&gt; Obviously if the painting has not faded, we can state with
&gt; certainty that Southampton is wearing a wig.

&gt; My proof is based on worst case scenario--that the painting
&gt; is faded.

&gt; IF the painting is faded--and I don't believe it is--with a basic
&gt; knowledge of primary colors we can deduce that Southampton
&gt; is wearing a brown wig.

&gt; The quibble that the painting has darked can be dismissed
&gt; because the pigment is obviously not darked.
&gt; _______________________________________________________

&gt; It certainly does *not* follow from Elizabeth's
&gt;&gt; farcically subjective impressions that Southampton was wearing a wig.&quot;

&gt; Only in the stubbornly illogical universe you live in,
&gt; Dr. Quibbles.

&gt;&gt; Nowhere does the word &quot;faded&quot; appear therein either.

&gt; Discolored? Faded? Are you going to write 40 posts on
&gt; 'faced?' I sure hope so, Webb. Please do. Please quibble
&gt; your way through 40 posts. Make it 60. I want everyone
&gt; to see what an obsessive compulsive pest you are.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You claimed that Southampton's natural light blond-red hair had
&gt;&gt;&gt; faded to 'light brown.

&gt;&gt; No, I said nothing of the kind.

&gt; We have both seen the painting numerous times.

&gt; We both know that the painting has not darkened.

&gt; We can deduce from your rejection that the sitter's
&gt; light brown hair is a wig that you believe that . . . are you
&gt; color blind? I didn't think of that.

&gt; Anyway.

&gt; We can deduce from your denial that the sitter's light brown
&gt; hair is a wig that you believe that Southampton had light
&gt; brown hair. That the hair in the painting is Southampton's
&gt; own natural light brown hair.

&gt; Scholars and Southampton's other paintings--one very fine
&gt; Dutch painting from ca 1620 that sadly is no longer on line--
&gt; the National Portrait Gallery cracked down on websites--but
&gt; shows Southampton with a gorgeous head of red hair. A rare
&gt; and beautiful color even when Southampton was middle aged.

&gt; The famous 'cat in the tower' portrait shows Southampton in
&gt; another wig, in my opinion. It looks like a wig and it isn't
&gt; Southampton's natural color. I'll get into the shape of his forehead
&gt; below.

&gt; So we can deduce from the 1620 portrait and statements
&gt; from Rowse and others that Southampton DID NOT HAVE
&gt; BROWN HAIR.

&gt; We can also deduce from Southampton's 1620 portrait that
&gt; Southampton had STRAIGHT, NOT CURLY HAIR.

&gt; So if the portrait is not faded, we can deduce with all certaintly
&gt; that Southampton has a theatrical wig on his head.

&gt; I also have a third proof for the wig argument.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We can deduce--at least I can deduce--you apparently don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; know basic logic--from a knowledge of primary colors and pigments
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the brown hair shown in Southampton's portrait is a wig and
&gt;&gt;&gt; not Southampton's own hair.

&gt;&gt;&gt; [snip of Webb's insults]

&gt;&gt;&gt; The color 'brown' is a combination of THREE PRIMARY COLORS,
&gt;&gt;&gt; red, yellow and blue.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In painting, unless you're a purist who mixes from only pure
&gt;&gt;&gt; primary pigments (some painters do) you mix

&gt;&gt;&gt; RED + GREEN (yellow and blue) = BROWN.

&gt;&gt; Not necessarily. Some basic pigments widely used in Renaissance
&gt;&gt; painting already had a brownish cast (burnt umber, yellow ochre, and
&gt;&gt; burnt sienna, for example).

&gt; Pardon me for pulling rank here, but there are no ochres or siennas
&gt; in that portrait. There could be umber but those tones could also
&gt; be mixed from true color by adding a bit of yellow to grey.

&gt;&gt; These pigments were ground directly from
&gt;&gt; naturally occurring minerals, not mixed from primary pigments. in fact,
&gt;&gt; Renaissance painters often used a palette of pigments other than the
&gt;&gt; three primary colors.

&gt; This is an English portrait, not Italian, not Dutch.

&gt; I simplified the color argument because any use of pigment
&gt; is academic AS LONG AS IT DOES NOT CONTAIN BLUE PIGMENT.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Southampton's famous hair was an astonishing 'strawberry
&gt;&gt;&gt; blond' or light blond hair with a touch of red pigment in it.

&gt;&gt; Source?

&gt; You have such a perfect memory I would think you'd remember
&gt; my citation of Rowse.

&gt; The Shakespearean scholar A. L. Rowse fairly pants: &quot;Anyone who
&gt; studies the portrait made of Southampton when he was nineteen will
&gt; see how striking his beauty was. There are the familiar golden
&gt; tresses, which he retained for some years more, falling over his
&gt; left shoulder; the haughty aristocratic look on the face, a
&gt; perfect oval; delicate features, lightly arched eyebrows,
&gt; sensitive nostril, small mouth. It is a feminine appearance, yet
&gt; there is . . . masculinity in the assertive stare of the eyes. . .
&gt; .&quot; [Shakespeare: A Biography (1963)].

&gt; Rowse says 'golden tresses' but portraits show that Southampton's
&gt; hair had a slight red tone to it. Close enough, however. The wig
&gt; does not have 'golden tresses' because the woman who sold her
&gt; hair had a touch of blue pigment in the follicle.
&gt; [...]

&gt;&gt;You have never seen Southampton's hair color, nor has anyone
&gt;&gt; else presently alive.

&gt; Quibbling is as boring as hell, Webb. BOR I N G.

&gt; There is no substance left to this argument. You don't care about
&gt; substance--the more superficial the

What are you on? First 'fifteen years' and now you're implying

I'll give you the key to Kant's insidious philosophy in one sentence
picked at random from Critique of Practical Reason.

This reminds one of Einsteinian hubris (like we can 'know' ultimate
reality)

Knowledge of ultimate reality comes through the practical reason,
particularly through the a priori moral law in us.

If you deconstruct Kant, you will find that he is insidiously privileging
a priori statements and demoting a posteriori statements.

See if you can figure out what Kant is really saying in the statement

&gt; Out of curiosity, I propose an informal poll: how many people think

&gt;&quot;Southampton was overly fond of drag and used to hang about the

&gt;&quot;proof&quot;?

&gt; [...]

"/>

+++++

I thought maybe we could all use some visual aids
in reaching our decisions, so I did a little surfing,
and here's what I found:

Southampton's haircut was apparently very &quot;cutting edge,&quot;
at the time. While Wriothesley's tresses may be described as
X-treme, they were by no means unusual. It was supposedly
the &quot;in thing&quot; to wear the hair short on one side
and long on the other, with curls framing the face.
This young man's curley tresses are a case in point.
Notice also the distinctly rosey, &quot;cupid's bow&quot; mouth.

This young man's outfit has a lace collar and cuffs that
are very similar to Henry's in the Hatchland's portrait.

Prince Henry's portrait provides another example of a
lace collar and cuffs reminiscent of Wriothesley's,
and the portrait provides a better view of how the
&quot;nipped&quot; waist joins the skirt, and the kind of
pantaloons which completed the ensemble.

Apparently, it was de riguere for young men and boys
to be depicted as having very fine features which would
be described as effeminate, today, possibly as a result
of their brushes with French and Italian fashion during
the obligatory grand tour, and from pandering to
a Queen rather than a King.

Here's another sweety with a lace collar.

Here's the miniature that Cobbe compared the &quot;Lady Norton&quot;
portrait with, when he determined that the sitter
was actually Wriothesley.

The thumbnail is actually a clearer pic. It's near the
end of the page, here:

If you scan both the Elizabethangeek and tudor-portraits
websites, you'll notice that young noblemen are often
shown reclining in sylvan glens and in poses that
appear feminine to modern eyes. Elizabeth was very
vain about her hands, which would likely have
a &quot;trickle down&quot; effect, naturally resulting in
the pose in the Hatchland portrait, if a man had
very fine hands.

According to what I read, by the end of the century,
most men would be wearing long, loosely flowing curls,
often tied up with ribbons. Henry's clothing and
affectations appear to represent
a logical step in this evolution.
I wonder whether the pic of the &quot;English Antick&quot;
has any bearing on the Groatsworth discussion.

Conclusions:

Henry is not wearing a theatrical wig
in the Hatchlands portrait.
The hair style is nothing more than an X-treme
version of what was &quot;hot&quot; among young men of his time.
His hairline is clearly visible on the left side of
his face, as well. If it were a wig,
wouldn't the curls frame the entire face?

I wasn't able to locate a pic of an
Elizabethan &quot;theatrical wig,&quot; so I don't know
what one would have looked like.
I did notice that there were very few
portraits of females, young or old
with their hair worn loose around the face,
whereas this style was common for men.
Fashionable women were commonly
depicted wearing caps or what looks like
intricate netting or symetrical braiding
or decorative webs of hairpins or something.

The clothing and mannerisms in the Hatchlands portrait
are the same as other noblemen of Henry's day, and
provide no evidence that he was a cross-dresser.

Elizabeth is imposing her own social norms on
a culture four centuries removed from her own.

Cordelialy,

Christine

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it's indiffidently proffered for what it is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You claimed in an earlier post that Southampton was not wearing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a 'brown wig,' but the portrait had merely 'faded.'

&gt;&gt;&gt; you can check for yourself (or if not, you can get someone to read it to
&gt;&gt;&gt; you) that the word &quot;faded&quot; does not occur anywhere therein. In the
&gt;&gt;&gt; prior post, I wrote:

&gt;&gt; You wrote DIS-COLORED.

&gt;&gt; There's no discoloration at all on that portrait. It's in remarkable
&gt;&gt; condition.

&gt; How would you know? Did you see it when it was freshly painted? Or
&gt; have you hallucainted it in that state?

&gt;&gt;&lt;http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Observer/documents/2002/04/20/o...
&gt;&gt; 20421.005.&gt;

&gt;&gt; And I proved

&gt;&quot;Proved&quot;?!

&gt;&gt; that even if it were faded the artist's rendering of
&gt;&gt; Southampton's own hair color would not fade to brown because
&gt;&gt; Southampton had no blue pigment in his hair. It was not a rusty red.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Or, perhaps the painter was not particularly good at mixing
&gt;&gt;&gt; colors...or, perhaps the passge [SIIIIIIIIIIC] of four centuries has
&gt;&gt;&gt; altered the original pigments.

&gt;&gt; There are color tests in the painting. Southampton had blue
&gt;&gt; eyes. The sitter's eyes are blue. His lips are red.

&gt;&gt; One of the arguments against the aging of this painting is that
&gt;&gt; the color is perfect;u even throughout the painting. There is no
&gt;&gt; fading or darkening from left to right or top to bottom. The
&gt;&gt; background is darker behind the left side (frontal view) of
&gt;&gt; Southampton's head but that's typical technique in painting to
&gt;&gt; show the light source which is customarily from the right.

&gt;&gt; The painting is in perfect condition as far as I can see.
&gt;&gt; ___________________________________________________

&gt; As far as you can see from having inspected the portrait when it was
&gt; freshly painted? Or as far as your hallucinations permit you to see?

&gt;&gt; Obviously if the painting has not faded, we can state with
&gt;&gt; certainty that Southampton is wearing a wig.

&gt;&quot;With certainty&quot;?!

&gt;&gt; My proof is based on worst case scenario--that the painting
&gt;&gt; is faded.

&gt;&gt; IF the painting is faded--and I don't believe it is--with a basic
&gt;&gt; knowledge of primary colors we can deduce that Southampton
&gt;&gt; is wearing a brown wig.

&gt;&gt; The quibble that the painting has darked can be dismissed
&gt;&gt; because the pigment is obviously not darked.
&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________________

&gt;&gt;&gt;It certainly does *not* follow from Elizabeth's
&gt;&gt;&gt; farcically subjective impressions that Southampton was wearing a wig.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Only in the stubbornly illogical universe you live in,
&gt;&gt; Dr. Quibbles.

&gt; Comment would be superfluous.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 40merrimack.dartmouth.edu&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;output=gplain&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nowhere does the word &quot;faded&quot; appear therein either.

&gt;&gt; Discolored? Faded? Are you going to write 40 posts on
&gt;&gt; 'faced?' I sure hope so, Webb. Please do. Please quibble
&gt;&gt; your way through 40 posts. Make it 60. I want everyone
&gt;&gt; to see what an obsessive compulsive pest you are.

&gt; The sort of behavior with which you evidently confuse an insistence
&gt; upon being quoted accurately is quite revealing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You claimed that Southampton's natural light blond-red hair had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; faded to 'light brown.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I said nothing of the kind.

&gt;&gt; We have both seen the painting numerous times.

&gt;&gt; We both know that the painting has not darkened.

&gt; Discoloration is not the same thing as darkening.

&gt;&gt; We can deduce from your rejection that the sitter's
&gt;&gt; light brown hair is a wig that you believe that . . . are you
&gt;&gt; color blind? I didn't think of that.

&gt;&gt; Anyway.

&gt;&gt; We can deduce from your denial that the sitter's light brown
&gt;&gt; hair is a wig

&gt; I did not deny any such thing; rather, I noted that there is simply
&gt; insufficient evidence for such a determination, due to a number of
&gt; uncertainties, among them those concerning the skill of the artist and
&gt; the aging of the painting.

&gt;&gt; that you believe that Southampton had light
&gt;&gt; brown hair. That the hair in the painting is Southampton's
&gt;&gt; own natural light brown hair.

Okay Elizabeth, you win, 16 isn't 15.

I started to respond to this, and then decided not to,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Knowledge of ultimate reality comes through the practical reason,

&gt; If you deconstruct Kant, you will find that he is insidiously privileging

&gt; See if you can figure out what Kant is really saying in the statement

&gt;&gt; In fact, this one surpasses Stephanie's immortal factoid about Caxton

Where did you get the idea that I think Marlowe wrote Don Quixote?

No Elizabeth. You expressly stated:

&quot;The pun on 'punto' would not be missed because in some
scenes the character Puntarvolo the knight is a take off
on Don Quixote, who makes the same chivalrous speeches,
probably stolen from the novel.&quot;

Please show us which speeches in Don Quixote
Jonson drew from in writing the &quot;take-off's&quot; in EMOHH,
which &quot;would not be missed&quot; by the cognoscenti.
Were the speeches present in the 1605 publication?
Or are you just pulling this out of your ***

I'm beginning to think your name is a pseudonym

&gt; I thought maybe we could all use some visual aids
&gt; in reaching our decisions, so I did a little surfing,
&gt; and here's what I found:

&gt; Southampton's haircut was apparently very &quot;cutting edge,&quot;
&gt; at the time. While Wriothesley's tresses may be described as
&gt; X-treme, they were by no means unusual. It was supposedly
&gt; the &quot;in thing&quot; to wear the hair short on one side
&gt; and long on the other, with curls framing the face.
&gt; This young man's curley tresses are a case in point.
&gt; Notice also the distinctly rosey, &quot;cupid's bow&quot; mouth.

&gt; http://elizabethangeek.com/costumereview/image.mhtml?image_id=96

&gt; This young man's outfit has a lace collar and cuffs that
&gt; are very similar to Henry's in the Hatchland's portrait.

&gt; http://elizabethangeek.com/costumereview/image.mhtml?image_id=94

&gt; Prince Henry's portrait provides another example of a
&gt; lace collar and cuffs reminiscent of Wriothesley's,
&gt; and the portrait provides a better view of how the
&gt;&quot;nipped&quot; waist joins the skirt, and the kind of
&gt; pantaloons which completed the ensemble.

&gt; www.tudor-portraits.com/PrinceHenry.jpg

&gt; Apparently, it was de riguere for young men and boys
&gt; to be depicted as having very fine features which would
&gt; be described as effeminate, today, possibly as a result
&gt; of their brushes with French and Italian fashion during
&gt; the obligatory grand tour, and from pandering to
&gt; a Queen rather than a King.

&gt; Here's another sweety with a lace collar.

&gt; If you scan both the Elizabethangeek and tudor-portraits
&gt; websites, you'll notice that young noblemen are often
&gt; shown reclining in sylvan glens and in poses that
&gt; appear feminine to modern eyes. Elizabeth was very
&gt; vain about her hands, which would likely have
&gt; a &quot;trickle down&quot; effect, naturally resulting in
&gt; the pose in the Hatchland portrait, if a man had
&gt; very fine hands.

&gt; According to what I read, by the end of the century,
&gt; most men would be wearing long, loosely flowing curls,
&gt; often tied up with ribbons. Henry's clothing and
&gt; affectations appear to represent
&gt; a logical step in this evolution.
&gt; I wonder whether the pic of the &quot;English Antick&quot;

Well, Cervantes finished _Don Quixote_ in 1615, while Christine noted
that the two Jonson plays under discussion were perfored in 1598 and
1599, respectively; that amounts to a lapse of 17 years and 16 years
respectively, but since I didn't feel like specifiying *individually*
the precise time lapses between the performance dates of each of the two
plays and the completion date of the novel, I used the inexact locution
&quot;fifteen years or so,&quot; trusting that everyone (except you, of course)

I'm not sure where you got the idea that Einstein was guilty of some
unspeakable &quot;hubris.&quot; If he was, then so is virtually every other
physicist, from Archimedes to Newton to Witten. Physicists spend their
lives trying to understand reality, and they have achieved some stunning
successes in this pursuit; however, all of them are quite cognizant that
even robustly successful theories are only as correct as experimental
probing permits, and that what now appears to be a fundamental law of
nature may later turn out to be merely an approximation, a limiting case
of a more successful theory. (Of course, it is clear why *you* regard
an attempt to understand reality as utterly hopeless -- indeed, your
connection to reality (such as it is) grows more tenuous by the day.)

Einstein also understood and acknowledged the limits of mathematical
reasoning. His admiration for Gödel was so deep that when both men were
colleagues (and had offices across the hall from one another) at the
Institute for Advanced Study, Einstein was afraid to speak to Gödel for
fear that he might interrupt the great man's thoughts (Gödel, as it
turned out, revered Einstein in the same way).

Good for you! But even if you compare the performance dates of the
Jonson plays with the completion date of the first part of _Don Quixote_
rather than that of the entire novel, it is still the case that the
performances of Jonson's plays predate _Don Quixote_ by at least five
years. So much for your hilarious hallucination that

&quot;The pun on 'punto' would not be missed because in some scenes
the character Puntarvolo the knight is a take off on Don Quixote
who makes the same chivalrous speeches, probably stolen from
the novel. Don Quixote tilted at windmills with his lance.

Beautiful post, Christine. Nice layout. Succinct.

Your links tend to resolve the question of whether Southampton's
attire in the Hatchlands portrait is only 'effeminate' or whether
Southampton commissioned an artist to paint him as a young
woman.

&lt;&gt;
or &lt;&gt;

In his Hillard, it's apparent that Southampton styles himself no
differently than other Italianate fops at the Elizabethan Court.

In his Hatchlands portrait Southampton clearly violates the
masculine dress code of the Elizabethan courtier.

Italiante dress was foppish but nevertheless preening and
assertive. It was more 'fighting cock' than feminine. Just out
of the picture these romantic, almost Byronic-looking youths
are wearing rapiers and under the silk their aristocratic
bodies are nicked and scarred.

In the Hilliard, Wriothesley looks like the rest of them. In
his life-size portrait he looks like a young Elizabeth Vernon

&lt;&gt;
&lt;&gt;
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
&lt;&gt;
&lt;&gt;
&lt;&gt;

Thanks for the well-researched and well-organized post.

Best regards,

Elizabeth

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; +++++

&gt; I thought maybe we could all use some visual aids
&gt; in reaching our decisions, so I did a little surfing,
&gt; and here's what I found:

&gt; Southampton's haircut was apparently very &quot;cutting edge,&quot;
&gt; at the time. While Wriothesley's tresses may be described as
&gt; X-treme, they were by no means unusual. It was supposedly
&gt; the &quot;in thing&quot; to wear the hair short on one side
&gt; and long on the other, with curls framing the face.
&gt; This young man's curley tresses are a case in point.
&gt; Notice also the distinctly rosey, &quot;cupid's bow&quot; mouth.

&gt; http://elizabethangeek.com/costumereview/image.mhtml?image_id=96

&gt; This young man's outfit has a lace collar and cuffs that
&gt; are very similar to Henry's in the Hatchland's portrait.

&gt; http://elizabethangeek.com/costumereview/image.mhtml?image_id=94

&gt; Prince Henry's portrait provides another example of a
&gt; lace collar and cuffs reminiscent of Wriothesley's,
&gt; and the portrait provides a better view of how the
&gt;&quot;nipped&quot; waist joins the skirt, and the kind of
&gt; pantaloons which completed the ensemble.

&gt; www.tudor-portraits.com/PrinceHenry.jpg

&gt; Apparently, it was de riguere for young men and boys
&gt; to be depicted as having very fine features which would
&gt; be described as effeminate, today, possibly as a result
&gt; of their brushes with French and Italian fashion during
&gt; the obligatory grand tour, and from pandering to
&gt; a Queen rather than a King.

&gt; www.tudor-portraits.com/JohnCroker.jpg

&gt; Here's another sweety with a lace collar.

&gt; www.tudor-portraits.com/UnknownMan12.jpg

&gt; Here's the miniature that Cobbe compared the &quot;Lady Norton&quot;
&gt; portrait with, when he determined that the sitter
&gt; was actually Wriothesley.

&gt; www.tudor-portraits.com/HenryWriothesley1.jpg

&gt; The thumbnail is actually a clearer pic. It's near the
&gt; end of the page, here:

&gt; www.tudor-portraits.com/various_4.htm

&gt; If you scan both the Elizabethangeek and tudor-portraits
&gt; websites, you'll notice that young noblemen are often
&gt; shown reclining in sylvan glens and in poses that
&gt; appear feminine to modern eyes. Elizabeth was very
&gt; vain about her hands, which would likely have
&gt; a &quot;trickle down&quot; effect, naturally resulting in
&gt; the pose in the Hatchland portrait, if a man had
&gt; very fine hands.

&gt; According to what I read, by the end of the century,
&gt; most men would be wearing long, loosely flowing curls,
&gt; often tied up with ribbons. Henry's clothing and
&gt; affectations appear to represent
&gt; a logical step in this evolution.
&gt; I wonder whether the pic of the &quot;English Antick&quot;
&gt; has any bearing on the Groatsworth discussion.

&gt; www.gutenberg.net/1/0/1/1/10115-h/10115-h.htm##v

&gt; Conclusions:

&gt; Henry is not wearing a theatrical wig
&gt; in the Hatchlands portrait.
&gt; The hair style is nothing more than an X-treme
&gt; version of what was &quot;hot&quot; among young men of his time.
&gt; His hairline is clearly visible on the left side of
&gt; his face, as well. If it were a wig,
&gt; wouldn't the curls frame the entire face?

&gt; I wasn't able to locate a pic of an
&gt; Elizabethan &quot;theatrical wig,&quot; so I don't know
&gt; what one would have looked like.
&gt; I did notice that there were very few
&gt; portraits of females, young or old
&gt; with their hair worn loose around the face,
&gt; whereas this style was common for men.
&gt; Fashionable women were commonly
&gt; depicted wearing caps or what looks like
&gt; intricate netting or symetrical braiding
&gt; or decorative webs of hairpins or something.

&gt; The clothing and mannerisms in the Hatchlands portrait
&gt; are the same as other noblemen of Henry's day, and
&gt; provide no evidence that he was a cross-dresser.

&gt; Elizabeth is imposing her own social norms on
&gt; a culture four centuries removed from her own.

&gt; Cordelialy,

&gt; Christine

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it's indiffidently proffered for what it is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You claimed in an earlier post that Southampton was not wearing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a 'brown wig,' but the portrait had merely 'faded.'

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The post can be found at

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you can check for yourself (or if not, you can get someone to read it to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you) that the word &quot;faded&quot; does not occur anywhere therein. In the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prior post, I wrote:

&gt;&gt;&gt; You wrote DIS-COLORED.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There's no discoloration at all on that portrait. It's in remarkable
&gt;&gt;&gt; condition.

&gt;&gt; How would you know? Did you see it when it was freshly painted? Or
&gt;&gt; have you hallucainted it in that state?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Observer/documents/2002/04/20/o...
&gt;&gt;&gt; 20421.005.&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; And I proved

&gt;&gt;&quot;Proved&quot;?!

&gt;&gt;&gt; that even if it were faded the artist's rendering of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Southampton's own hair color would not fade to brown because
&gt;&gt;&gt; Southampton had no blue pigment in his hair. It was not a rusty red.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Or, perhaps the painter was not particularly good at mixing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; colors...or, perhaps the passge [SIIIIIIIIIIC] of four centuries has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; altered the original pigments.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There are color tests in the painting. Southampton had blue
&gt;&gt;&gt; eyes. The sitter's eyes are blue. His lips are red.

&gt;&gt;&gt; One of the arguments against the aging of this painting is that
&gt;&gt;&gt; the color is perfect;u even throughout the painting. There is no
&gt;&gt;&gt; fading or darkening from left to right or top to bottom. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; background is darker behind the left side (frontal view) of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Southampton's head but that's typical technique in painting to
&gt;&gt;&gt; show the light source which is customarily from the right.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The painting is in perfect condition as far as I can see.
&gt;&gt;&gt; ___________________________________________________

&gt;&gt; As far as you can see from having inspected the portrait when it was
&gt;&gt; freshly painted? Or as far as your hallucinations permit you to see?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously if the painting has not faded, we can state with
&gt;&gt;&gt; certainty that Southampton is wearing a wig.

&gt;&gt;&quot;With certainty&quot;?!

&gt;&gt;&gt; My proof is based on worst case scenario--that the painting
&gt;&gt;&gt; is faded.

&gt;&gt;&gt; IF the painting is faded--and I don't believe it is--with a basic
&gt;&gt;&gt; knowledge of primary colors we can deduce that Southampton
&gt;&gt;&gt; is wearing a brown wig.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The quibble that the painting has darked can be dismissed
&gt;&gt;&gt; because the pigment is obviously not darked.
&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________________

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It certainly does *not* follow from Elizabeth's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; farcically subjective impressions that Southampton was wearing a wig.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Only in the stubbornly illogical universe you live in,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dr. Quibbles.

&gt;&gt; Comment would be superfluous.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 40merrimack.dartmouth.edu&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;output=gplain&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nowhere does the word &quot;faded&quot; appear therein either.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Discolored? Faded? Are you going to write 40 posts on
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'faced?' I sure hope so, Webb. Please do. Please quibble
&gt;&gt;&gt; your way through 40 posts. Make it 60. I want everyone
&gt;&gt;&gt; to see what an obsessive compulsive pest you are.

&gt;&gt; The sort of behavior with which you evidently confuse an insistence
&gt;&gt; upon being quoted accurately is quite revealing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; faded to 'light brown.

No. I've offered the links as a way to resolve the

fashionable young men of his time.
I posit that it is you who define the fashion
as &quot;effeminate,&quot; but the Elizabethans found it
&quot;fashionable.&quot; I am sure that by the same standard,
you would find men's fashion of the late 17th C
and the 18th C as effeminate, also.

&gt;&gt; I thought maybe we could all use some visual aids
&gt;&gt; in reaching our decisions, so I did a little surfing,
&gt;&gt; and here's what I found:

&gt;&gt; Southampton's haircut was apparently very &quot;cutting edge,&quot;
&gt;&gt; at the time. While Wriothesley's tresses may be described as
&gt;&gt; X-treme, they were by no means unusual. It was supposedly
&gt;&gt; the &quot;in thing&quot; to wear the hair short on one side
&gt;&gt; and long on the other, with curls framing the face.
&gt;&gt; This young man's curley tresses are a case in point.
&gt;&gt; Notice also the distinctly rosey, &quot;cupid's bow&quot; mouth.

&gt;&gt; http://elizabethangeek.com/costumereview/image.mhtml?image_id=96

&gt;&gt; This young man's outfit has a lace collar and cuffs that
&gt;&gt; are very similar to Henry's in the Hatchland's portrait.

&gt;&gt; http://elizabethangeek.com/costumereview/image.mhtml?image_id=94

&gt;&gt; Prince Henry's portrait provides another example of a
&gt;&gt; lace collar and cuffs reminiscent of Wriothesley's,
&gt;&gt; and the portrait provides a better view of how the
&gt;&gt;&quot;nipped&quot; waist joins the skirt, and the kind of
&gt;&gt; pantaloons which completed the ensemble.

&gt;&gt; www.tudor-portraits.com/PrinceHenry.jpg

&gt;&gt; Apparently, it was de riguere for young men and boys
&gt;&gt; to be depicted as having very fine features which would
&gt;&gt; be described as effeminate, today, possibly as a result
&gt;&gt; of their brushes with French and Italian fashion during
&gt;&gt; the obligatory grand tour, and from pandering to
&gt;&gt; a Queen rather than a King.

&gt;&gt; www.tudor-portraits.com/JohnCroker.jpg

&gt;&gt; Here's another sweety with a lace collar.

&gt;&gt; www.tudor-portraits.com/UnknownMan12.jpg

&gt;&gt; Here's the miniature that Cobbe compared the &quot;Lady Norton&quot;
&gt;&gt; portrait with, when he determined that the sitter
&gt;&gt; was actually Wriothesley.

&gt;&gt; www.tudor-portraits.com/HenryWriothesley1.jpg

&gt;&gt; The thumbnail is actually a clearer pic. It's near the
&gt;&gt; end of the page, here:

&gt;&gt; www.tudor-portraits.com/various_4.htm

&gt;&gt; If you scan both the Elizabethangeek and tudor-portraits
&gt;&gt; websites, you'll notice that young noblemen are often
&gt;&gt; shown reclining in sylvan glens and in poses that
&gt;&gt; appear feminine to modern eyes. Elizabeth was very
&gt;&gt; vain about her hands, which would likely have
&gt;&gt; a &quot;trickle down&quot; effect, naturally resulting in
&gt;&gt; the pose in the Hatchland portrait, if a man had
&gt;&gt; very fine hands.

&gt;&gt; According to what I read, by the end of the century,
&gt;&gt; most men would be wearing long, loosely flowing curls,
&gt;&gt; often tied up with ribbons. Henry's clothing and
&gt;&gt; affectations appear to represent
&gt;&gt; a logical step in this evolution.
&gt;&gt; I wonder whether the pic of the &quot;English Antick&quot;
&gt;&gt; has any bearing on the Groatsworth discussion.

&gt;&gt; www.gutenberg.net/1/0/1/1/10115-h/10115-h.htm##v

&gt;&gt; Conclusions:

&gt;&gt; Henry is not wearing a theatrical wig
&gt;&gt; in the Hatchlands portrait.
&gt;&gt; The hair style is nothing more than an X-treme
&gt;&gt; version of what was &quot;hot&quot; among young men of his time.
&gt;&gt; His hairline is clearly visible on the left side of
&gt;&gt; his face, as well. If it were a wig,
&gt;&gt; wouldn't the curls frame the entire face?

&gt;&gt; I wasn't able to locate a pic of an
&gt;&gt; Elizabethan &quot;theatrical wig,&quot; so I don't know
&gt;&gt; what one would have looked like.
&gt;&gt; I did notice that there were very few
&gt;&gt; portraits of females, young or old
&gt;&gt; with their hair worn loose around the face,
&gt;&gt; whereas this style was common for men.
&gt;&gt; Fashionable women were commonly
&gt;&gt; depicted wearing caps or what looks like
&gt;&gt; intricate netting or symetrical braiding
&gt;&gt; or decorative webs of hairpins or something.

&gt;&gt; The clothing and mannerisms in the Hatchlands portrait
&gt;&gt; are the same as other noblemen of Henry's day, and
&gt;&gt; provide no evidence that he was a cross-dresser.

&gt;&gt; Elizabeth is imposing her own social norms on
&gt;&gt; a culture four centuries removed from her own.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You claimed in an earlier post that Southampton was not wearing

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you can check for yourself (or if not, you can get someone to read it to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you) that the word &quot;faded&quot; does not occur anywhere therein. In the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prior post, I wrote:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You wrote DIS-COLORED.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There's no discoloration at all on that portrait. It's in remarkable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; condition.

&gt;&gt;&gt; How would you know? Did you see it when it was freshly painted? Or
&gt;&gt;&gt; have you hallucainted it in that state?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I proved

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Proved&quot;?!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that even if it were faded the artist's rendering of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Southampton's own hair color would not fade to brown because
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Southampton had no blue pigment in his hair. It was not a rusty red.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Or, perhaps the painter was not particularly good at mixing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; colors...or, perhaps the passge [SIIIIIIIIIIC] of four centuries has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; altered the original pigments.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are color tests in the painting. Southampton had blue
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eyes. The sitter's eyes are blue. His lips are red.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One of the arguments against the aging of this painting is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the color is perfect;u even throughout the painting. There is no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fading or darkening from left to right or top to bottom. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; background is darker behind the left side (frontal view) of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Southampton's head but that's typical technique in painting to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; show the light source which is customarily from the right.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The painting is in perfect condition as far as I can see.

&gt;&gt; Beautiful post, Christine. Nice layout. Succinct.

&gt;&gt; Your links tend to resolve the question of whether Southampton's
&gt;&gt; attire in the Hatchlands portrait is only 'effeminate'

&gt; No. I've offered the links as a way to resolve the
&gt; question of whether Southampton's attire was
&gt; in some way &quot;different&quot; from the attire of other
&gt; fashionable young men of his time.

"/>

Are you saying that you can't tell any difference between
the Southampton wearing lipstick and an earring with his
forehead shaved up to the parietal bones to show off
the feminine curve of his forehead versus the
rock star Wriothesley of the Hilliard?

I can do a post on the way Elizabethan women achieved
that fashionable high rounded forehead. If Wriothesley
wasn't a prettie seventeen year old his 'receding hairline'
would looke like male pattern baldness. That forehead
is almost twice as high as in his 1600 portrait.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I posit that it is you who define the fashion
&gt; as &quot;effeminate,&quot; but the Elizabethans found it
&gt;&quot;fashionable.&quot; I am sure that by the same standard,
&gt; you would find men's fashion of the late 17th C
&gt; and the 18th C as effeminate, also.

"/>

Elizabethan males wore ridiculous clothing but Leicester
looks like a sexy beast in his doublet and hose--the musk
fairly radiates off the canvas. Southampton's clothes
in his 1600 portrait are over the top--he looks like he's
got his bustle on sideways--but Southampton was gay.
What can I say?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (long curley hair, be-ribboned pantaloons in the late 17th)
&gt; (high heeled shoes, powdered wigs in the 18th)

"/>

Is the 18th century relevant?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; or whether
&gt;&gt; Southampton commissioned an artist to paint him as a young
&gt;&gt; woman.
&gt; I have absolutely no idea who commissioned the portrait.
&gt; Do you?

"/>

The style is distinctly English. Probably an amateur painting.
Bacon may have done it. He was an artist. HIs nephew
Nicholas Bacon was an amateur but one of the finest English
painters.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&lt;http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Observer/documents/2002/04/20/o...&gt;
&gt;&gt; or &lt;http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,687778,00.html&gt;

&gt;&gt; In his Hillard, it's apparent that Southampton styles himself no
&gt;&gt; differently than other Italianate fops at the Elizabethan Court.

&gt; It appears that he is wearing very similar costume
&gt; to the Hatchlands portrait.

"/>

The cut is entirely different. Notice that there are tight sleeves
with little puffs at the shoulders. Women wore that look, men
had an 'inverted triangel' look with a very tight waste and very
exaggerated shoulders. I don't see that shawl color on any
womens' costumes. The cut is Dutch.

All of this is academic because for over four-hundred years
(1590-2004) hundreds of people have seen that painting and
not one, as far as the Cobbes family tradition goes, has every
suggested that the 'young woman' was a young man. The sheer
circumstance of its discovery is a kind of 'proof.'

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; In his Hatchlands portrait Southampton clearly violates the
&gt;&gt; masculine dress code of the Elizabethan courtier.

&gt; In what way?

The eyebrows plucked into perfect half-circles. The makeup.
The tight narrow shoulders and little cap sleeves. The hairstyle
which requires a buckram or wire 'cap' to lift the hair on
top of the head. That very feminine earring that looks like a wire
butterfly with a little dangling red heart cut from a stone.

No. Bacon was trained as a diplomat. He essentially
disappeared during the 1580s and was presumably
traveling on assignment in the Catholics states. He and
his brother did espionage for the Secretary of State,
Sir Francis Walsingham, whose father Thomas was mentor
to the Bacon family. Francis, the 'greatest cipherer of his age,'
invented the biliteral and plus ultra ciphers for Walsingham so
he was engaged in defending the Protestant cause but at the
top level.. Officially, Bacon was Elizabeth's personal advisor.
He wasn't a pacifist.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You could set up objective criteria to determine where Wriothesley
ranks on the m-f scale.

If Elizabeth had actually *read* Dave Kathman's essay on dating _The
Tempest_, she would be aware that he does not claim anywhere therein to
know with assurance how Shakespeare became acquainted with the letter's
content. Rather, Dave confines himself to enumerating *numerous* links
among Shakespeare, Strachey, and the Virginia Company, any one of which
might account for Shakespeare's access to the letter; he shows thereby
that, while nobody knows *how* Shakespeare became aware of the letter's
content, Shakespeare's access to it is not the glaring anomaly that some
Oxfordians apparently imagine.

However, Elizabeth plainly has *not* read the essay -- indeed, on at
least four occasions she has averred that Dave claims that Richard Field
delivered the letter to Shakespeare, although Dave never mentions Field
even *once* in the entire essay! Elizabeth has also fabricated a bogus
quotation and attributed it to Dave.

While I cannot speak for Dave, I gravely doubt that he is very much
disturbed at being &quot;includ[ed] in [my] categorical 'neither does anyone

Presumably, not very similar -- one would really like to see Elizabeth's

&gt;&gt; No. I've offered the links as a way to resolve the

&gt;&gt; in some way &quot;different&quot; from the attire of other
&gt;&gt; fashionable young men of his time.

Looks to me like he's wearing formal battle dress

I take that for a no, you don't know who commissioned the
Hatchlands Portrait, or who painted it.

The identity of the painter is important to interpretation.

Compare, for instance.

Hilliard's portrait of Sir Walter Raliegh,
with its fine-boned features:

with Hilliard's own self-portrait:

with this portrait of Raliegh by &quot;H,&quot;
made only three years after the Hilliard.
Note the earring.

We don't know who the portrait who originally attributed
the portrait to Lady Norton or when. Certainly after
the passage of time, and the corresponding changes
in men's fashion, there might be *some* reason to
attribute the painting to a woman, but even a cursory
examination of seventeenth century fashion indicates
the sitter is dressed as a man.

The shoulders are relaxed, with a slight lip at the shoulder.
The sitter wears a very wide, lace collar raised above the
shoulders, with matching lace at the sleeve cuffs.
The sleeves are relaxed and fairly tight.
It's difficult to tell from the portrait what the fabric is.
The waist is nipped.

This portrait of Sir Henry Slingsby shows the same relaxed
shoulders and tight sleeves, and appears to be made of
some sort of brocade.

This 1572 painting of an unknown man also has the
same flat shoulders.

Here's another.

This portrait of Thomas Lyte shows a similar wide, lace collar
and neckline as the Hatchlands portrait.

This portrait of the young Prince Charles
shows him with the same high forehead,
the same tight sleeves, flat lace collar,
nipped waist, and bodice finished by a full skirt.

Prince Henry doesn't appear to have *any* hairline.

Ladies, on the other hand, always wore dresses
with big puffy sleeves.

These two are the *least* puffy I could find,

Elizabethan women took this exaggerated shoulder
to extremes.

http:/elizabethangeek.com/costumereview/image.mhtml?image_id=100

Both men and women wore lace neck ruffs that were more or
less the same.

Croker.jpg

But lace collars differed between the sexes.

A woman's lace collar framed the head and attached
at the a dropped bodice to show off her neck,
against which she wore elaborate beaded chokers.

I'm comparing the dress of very young fashionistas
and courtiers with the Hatchlands portrait.
All young gentlemen learned to use the sword,
and Henry was no different. The Hatchlands
portrait shows him wearing informal dress
which was common to his contemporaries.

The fashions of more mature men aren't relevant.
Wriothesley's formal &quot;armor&quot; portrait,
and the Tower portrait are in marked contrast
to the Hatchlands portrait,
and his clothing matches that of his contemporaries
at those later dates.

Cordelialy,

Since it's not Italian, Dutch, French or Spanish and it's

The painting was actually passed down through Lady Norton,
great-grandaughter of Southampton to her cousin Honor Norton who
was the grandmother to Archbishop Cobbe who then passed it down
to Alec Cobbe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Certainly after
&gt; the passage of time, and the corresponding changes
&gt; in men's fashion, there might be *some* reason to
&gt; attribute the painting to a woman, but even a cursory
&gt; examination of seventeenth century fashion indicates
&gt; the sitter is dressed as a man.

"/>

Elizabethan doublets had a 'v' upper torso--the waist was
small and if it wasn't black cloth was added at the sides
to make it look smaller. The shoulders were as broad as
possible. The wasp look.

Southampton's costume is fitted tightly to his body like
a woman's bodice. It has small shoulders and small
tucks at the top of his sleeve. There's no huffery
puffery primate display going on there. And Southampton
has that soulful look on his face. All he needs to do is flutter
his eyelashes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The shoulders are relaxed, with a slight lip at the shoulder.
&gt; The sitter wears a very wide, lace collar raised above the
&gt; shoulders, with matching lace at the sleeve cuffs.
&gt; The sleeves are relaxed and fairly tight.
&gt; It's difficult to tell from the portrait what the fabric is.

"/>

It looks like a brocade but I'm just guessing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The waist is nipped.
&gt; This portrait of Sir Henry Slingsby shows the same relaxed
&gt; shoulders and tight sleeves, and appears to be made of
&gt; some sort of brocade.

&gt; http://elizabethangeek.com/costumereview/image.mhtml?image_id=99

"/>

Slingsby's shoulders are so unnaturally broad that he probably
has padded shoulders or detachable sleeves with a doublet.
His head, even with the big hat, looks abnormally small on his
shoulders.

In Wriothesley's hey day the the idea was to get as much breadth
across the shoulders as possible. Again, the 'v' look.

Slingsby is in Southampton's generation so the date is about right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The Unknown Man is in Leicester's generation. A different fashion

Bad link.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This portrait of Thomas Lyte shows a similar wide, lace collar

Lyte wasn't a courtier. He was obscure gentry from the older
generation. He's wearing some shabby robe.

&gt; This portrait of the young Prince Charles
&gt; shows him with the same high forehead,
&gt; the same tight sleeves, flat lace collar,
&gt; nipped waist, and bodice finished by a full skirt.

&gt; www.tudor-portraits.com/Charles.jpg

"/>

Charles was a generation younger than Southampton
and the styles had definitely changed when this painting
was done. Charles looks about 11 or 12 at the most
so it's probably 1612. With two queens at Whitehall,
the Stuarts spent a great deal on clothes. Charles'
outfit looks distinctly French. Very beautiful. Nothing was
too good for the Stuarts who were in an abyss of debt.

James I's quarrels about money with Parliament would eventually
cause young Charles to have his head chopped off.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The Stuarts were not genetic prizes. Anyway, wrong

&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you saying that you can't tell any difference between
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Southampton wearing lipstick and an earring with his

&gt;&gt;&gt; the feminine curve of his forehead versus the
&gt;&gt;&gt; rock star Wriothesley of the Hilliard?

Elizabeth always has trouble keeping attributions straight.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I know Cobbe compared the Hatchlands to the Hilliard

&gt; I'm asking if you can detect any femininity in the Hatchlands.

&gt; Maybe Webb, for example can't 'see' that Southampton
&gt; looks like a woman in the Hatchlands.

"/>

Elizabeth actually appears to believe that Southampton's androgynous
appearance in a portrait constitutes proof that

&quot;Southampton was overly fond of drag and used to hang about
the theatres hoping to play female roles. He was given a
few parts and was apparently very convincing as a girl.&quot;!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I posit that it is you who define the fashion
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as &quot;effeminate,&quot; but the Elizabethans found it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;fashionable.&quot; I am sure that by the same standard,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you would find men's fashion of the late 17th C
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the 18th C as effeminate, also.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Elizabethan males wore ridiculous clothing
&gt;&gt; Ridiculous in whose eyes?
&gt; Functionally ridiculous. Their short breeches were
&gt; filled with 'bombast' of wool, cotton, rags, paper, horsehair,
&gt; even straw which bred fleas, lice and probably bedbugs.

&gt; Renaissance male attire had nothing to do with the natural
&gt; shape of the human body.
&gt;&gt; I'm sure that if Elizabeth thought that her
&gt;&gt; men looked ridiculous in their clothes,
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth would have said so, and the fashionistas
&gt;&gt; would have scrambled to please her.
&gt; I doubt it. The Tudor Court was full of diplomats and
&gt; other foreigners who dressed like the fops.
&gt;&gt; You have just stated categorically that your
&gt;&gt; view is tainted by your own cultural bias
&gt;&gt; and is therefor suspect by definition.
&gt; Ah think that suffers from overinterpretation,

The irony here could scarcely be richer!

&gt;&gt; Looks to me like he's wearing formal battle dress
&gt;&gt; as befits his station,
&gt; No, those are his jousting clothes. Southampton wouldn't
&gt; take that gold filigree armor and helmet into battle.

&quot;Gold filigree armor&quot;?! Elizabeth's uncanny insight into the details
of Southampton's personal grooming and sartorial preferences continues
to astound!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Here's Leicester and Essex in full battle gear:

&gt;&gt; remarkably similar to the Hatchlands portrait.
&gt; Probably padding for when he got knocked on his ass.

Huh? His hair style was &quot;padding for when he got knocked on his

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have absolutely no idea who commissioned the portrait.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you?

Evidence?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I take that for a no, you don't know who commissioned the

I'll take that for a &quot;no&quot; as well. Elizabeth plainly hasn't a clue
who commissioned the portrait, or who painted it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's not like there was an English School of Transvestite Portraiture.

Why not? It's at least as plausible as most of Elizabeth's other
inventions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't think we have to worry about the identity of the amateur
&gt; painter.
&gt;&gt; The identity of the painter is important to interpretation.
&gt; Since it's not Italian, Dutch, French or Spanish and it's
&gt; not signed we can assume that it was painted by an anonymous
&gt; aristocrat or member of the gentry.

&gt; Painters were mere artisans so aristocrats could not sign their work
&gt; without losing clase [sic].

&gt; The stigma of paint.

Has anyone managed to read this far without laughing aloud?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Compare, for instance.

&gt;&gt; Hilliard's portrait of Sir Walter Raliegh,
&gt;&gt; with its fine-boned features:

&gt;&gt; with Hilliard's own self-portrait:

&gt;&gt; www.tudor-portraits.com/NicholasHilliard.jpg

&gt;&gt; with this portrait of Raliegh by &quot;H,&quot;
&gt;&gt; made only three years after the Hilliard.
&gt;&gt; Note the earring.
&gt; The style is also English. The painter 'H' was either an aristocrat
&gt; or a woman or both.

"/>

Huh?! How does this follow?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Men wore earrings. Raleigh once caused a little furor by putting
&gt; two pearls in one ear. He still looked macho.

&gt; The point is that Southampton's wearing a woman's earring.

&gt; That is what got the attention of the National Trust art consultant
&gt; Alastair Laing.

&gt; Laing said it was the woman's hair style and earring.
&gt;&gt; http://elizabethangeek.com/costumereview/image.mhtml?image_id=60
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It appears that he is wearing very similar costume
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the Hatchlands portrait.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The cut is entirely different. Notice that there are tight sleeves
&gt;&gt;&gt; with little puffs at the shoulders. Women wore that look, men
&gt;&gt;&gt; had an 'inverted triangel' [sic] look with a very tight waste [sic!]
&gt;&gt;&gt; and very
&gt;&gt;&gt; exaggerated shoulders. I don't see that shawl color on any
&gt;&gt;&gt; womens' costumes. The cut is Dutch.
