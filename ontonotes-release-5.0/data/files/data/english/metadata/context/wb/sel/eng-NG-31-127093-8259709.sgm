You know, I'm reaching a point of apathy. Maybe I already reached it.
I've been reaching for it all year, been pondering the wording -- is
it &quot;apathy&quot; or &quot;acceptance&quot; or &quot;indifference&quot; or some new-coined word
like &quot;apadifference&quot;...

I'm at that point where trying to do the right thing has become
tedious. &quot;Right thing&quot; is relative anyway, now isn't it? The right
thing for me is to get paid, but the right thing for the company might
be to cut my job. See?

So I'm starting to think it really doesn't matter if I go left, right,
straight ahead or just plop down and sit it out. Everything goes on
around me no matter my actions, no matter my decisions. Time trickles
on, and I have very little impact. I make a decision, one person gets
pissed, one gets happy, shit falls apart or sticks together without
much binding effect from me.

Got to thinking about Forrest Gump the other day, how he just kinda
bounced through life from mishap to mishap, while, gad, I forget her
name, the girl, she tried and tried to get ahead but never seemed to
get there, wound up dying from HIV. Jenny! That's her name. She made
bad decisions, no doubt, but she was trying. Gump didn't try at all,
look where it got him.

Apathy. What I do doesn't matter.

Acceptance. I cannot control my environment or others.

Indifference. Fuck it.

Egads... I'm not even making sense.

ps.

I guess it boils down to this...

Recall the post on being friends with the ex? I'm starting to think
that's a bad thing. For 5 years I've tried to be amicable with the ex-
wife, accomodate her, and the old-timers will say I've been pussy-
whipped and hooked on her.

Well, things change, don't they, sometimes overnight. Holy crap!

Now I'm starting to think the ex is a cunt-ass bitch, at least when
she's in orbit around my little planet. Just got through screaming at
her in the coffee break room here at work, just about spiked my cell
phone in front of my manager.

Cripes. Christ.

Funny thing, though, is I really don't care how pissed off she is. I
really don't. I try to do good by her, she gets pissed. I do bad by
her, she gets pissed. I accomodate, it's not good enough. I date a
girl, I get grilled. I try to be friends with the ex and get shoved
away. Nothing I do makes things right -- things simply ~are~.

I hear that Irish priest in my head saying, &quot;Jaysus Christ Mother Mary
and Joseph,&quot; shaking his head.

It depends on how you define &quot;right thing&quot;. If that means trying to
control the behavior of others, I bet it is tedious, because it's damn
near impossible. Banging your head against a wall and saying &quot;I like
this&quot; is very tedious, for example.

This is why learning to let things go is so important.

Ehhh, not exactly. Gump lived according to his own principles; so did
she. He was operating at a lower level of expectations than most of
us, though.

Saul, you sound like someone who is trying to become an ex-control
freak.

Look, what you do does matter. You just have to accept that you have a
limited sphere of influence and let go what you can't help. It's a
weird, uncomfortable feeling to do that if you're not used to it, but
*get* used to it. It will make your life immensely easier. Really.

Saul, your ex sounds a bit like mine (may God have mercy upon you).
When we were together it simply did not matter what I did, it was
NEVER - and a repeat NEVER - good enough. Just as you state if I did
something that was good for her - I got shit, if I did something good
for me - I got shit, if I did.... you get the picture. She spent the
better part of the last 10 years of our marriage getting pissed at me
all the time. Hell I could not even tell her the time of day without
an arguement - and YES, it was THAT BAD.

Unless you have some compelling reason to be &quot;friends&quot; with your ex -
like an overwhelming streak of masochism, or an uncontrolable urge to
do your best door-mat impression - then may I suggest that a serious
session of defining healthy boundaries is in order?????

Your ex does not like who you date???? Give me a F&amp;cking break! That
is a line she should not even be approaching, never mind crossing! It
is time to kick your ex to the curb, once and for all! I mean, WTF????
IMHO, you need to define your boundaries, and then make her aware of
them. When she crosses them - and she will - you tell her &quot;don't let
the door hit you on the way OUT!&quot;

Seriously, why, after all this time, are you letting your ex walk all
over you and push your buttons?????

Remember.... be the empty soda machine! Let he push the buttons all
she wants, but don't give her what she wants! After a while, even a
bitch will hit the road if she can't get what she wants! And it
appears she wants to keep you under her thumb.

Self analysis has its uses, but I think that us who have contol
issues often misuse it to try to regulate our own emotional state.
Its the last thing we want to ease control over.  So, we spend
time trying to determine how we /should/ feel about something,
instead of simply feeling it, and dealing with that.

Jenny was hopefull of bettering herself; but, seemed at the expense of
the good around her.  She executed poorly, lacked ethics or
appreciation.  Couldn't tell good from bad; kinda sought to reinvent the
wheel.  Clearly, hunting for some ideal but was selfish with little to
no dedication and seldom showing character.  Nearing the end, she found
nothing; left a son with no mom, and died from her inability to manage
her freedoms.

You're right FGump didn't have direction - yet, he had considerably more
that helped him along - a simplicity that allowed him to give his all to
each and every situation that presented itself!
While in Vietnam - he did the natural; saving the lives of others was
more important then his own.  Not a selfish bone in his body.  Making a
promise and following it through.  At every juncture - even table tennis
- he excelled because he didn't over think or analysis what and why.

No matter what FG did, his results was better then others; making it
easy for those lacking direction to follow.  He reacted - she watched..
When he realized - it was time to quit, he made the decision.  He did
what others could only admire from afar.  All while demonstrating day in
and day out, his appreciation for values that his momma taught him;
character quality's that losers like Jenny all to often abuse or make
fun of.

Her only unselfish realizations came after birth - making sure her son
knew his father.  The best part - the son was appearing like his
father:)
