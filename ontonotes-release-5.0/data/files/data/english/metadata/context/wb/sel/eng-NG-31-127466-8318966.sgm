There is a really interesting discussion over on:

rec.arts.sf.written

about MC in general branching into RAH's treatment of childrearing and
children.

It is under the thread: Re-reading Heinlein, Methuselah's Children.

The opening post is especially insightful, as are most of the rest.
There are a few nasty one-liners, but you can't escape them anywhere.

Worth checking out.

cheers

I don't know if there are any other Brits here who
listened to it on BBC7 the other week, but unless I
missed them, the snide references to Eleanor and
Hubert Johnson were omitted from the radio version.
Personally, I did not miss them.

What did you consider to be mocking, sarcastic or underhanded or
indirect about the implicit and expressed criticism of Eleanor's notions
of the child rearing of Hubert in _Methuselah's Children_, Michael?

The tone of the observer's point of view expressed seems rather more sad
and resignedly sympathetic about the reasons for but unapproving at her
obsession than anything else.

There is something bad about a mother being &quot;obsessed&quot;
with the safety and interests of her child - and
consistently putting his needs before her own? After
all, if we ignore Lazarus' (and on one occasion
Ford's) opinions and just look at the record, what do
we actually _know_ about the Johnsons?

1) When they are being rescued from the concentration
camp, and Eleanor fears they may not all get onto the
ship, she plans to pass Hubert through the crowd so
that he gets on even if she doesn't. IOW she is ready
to lose her son forever rather than let him come to
harm, an attitude I should expect Heinlein (never mind
King Solomon) to entirely approve.

2) On board ship, Eleanor keeps a close eye on
Hubert's education, teaching whichever class he
happens to be in at the time.  Assuming she is not in
a position to simply educate him at home (an obvious
course now but less common whan MC was written) this
would seem a reasonable option if feasible.

3) On the Jockaira planet, Hubert screams for help
when picked up (uninvited and apparently without
warning) by an eight-foot alien creature - a perfectly
reasonable reaction (the alien's intentions may have
been quite innocent, but Hubert doesn't know that) and
indeed what millions of children are _taught_ to do if
grabbed by a stranger - and Eleanor goes to his aid.
Whereupon, Ford promptly turns on Eleanor and accuses
her of having &quot;spoiled the boy rotten&quot; and of
endangering the colony, all without the slightest
evidence, or any explanation of what Hubert is
supposed to have done wrong.

(Subsequently, the Jockaira insist on taking &quot;custody&quot;
of all the telepathic sensitives, as a result  of
which most of them go insane. Shortly after _this_,
Ford himself goes into temporary insanity after
entering a Jockaira Temple. All in all, Hubert's fear
of the unknown, even if mistaken in that specific
instance, seems to have been a good deal more
justified than Ford's dismissal of it).

4) When the Families decide to return to Earth, the
Johnsons are divided. Eleanor, presumably remembering
the circumstances of their departure, wishes to stay
behing, but Hubert (now eighteen or a bit over) goes
along with the majority, even though it may cost him
his life and will almost certainly mean lifelong
separation from his only living relative.  Lazarus
shows not the slightest sympathy for his problem, just
impatiently telling him to get on with it - though a
pause for thought over such a momentous and
irreversible decision (far graver than any _I_ ever
had to make at Hubert's age) would seem both right and
natural.

5) When she realises what Hubert has done, Eleanor
falls in with his decision and also returns to Earth -
an act akin to a Jewish woman (dare I say &quot;a Jewish
mother&quot;?) following her son back to Germany, though
both are totally ignorant of conditions there, and for
all they know the &quot;Nazis&quot; may still be in power. If
Earth is still hostile, this could easily mean death
for both of them. Yet Eleanor, who could remain in
perfect safety where she is, instead goes back to face
her worst nighmare rather than risk leaving Hubert to
die alone. Her son's decision may prove fatal, but if
so she will take her chances with him rather than
abandon him. She has, so to speak, come full circle,
and on this last appearence, as in the beginning, we
see her putting Hubert first. Yet Lazarus reports her
arrival totally without comment, giving not the
slightest thought to what it must have cost her.

[In the end, of course, all this proves academic. By
decree of the author, Earth is no longer dangerous,
and they can &quot;all live happily ever after&quot;, insofar as
humans ever do.  But neither Hubert nor Eleanor (or
indeed anyone else) could possibly have known that in
advance. For all they know, the decision to return may
well be fatal. Whatever the Johnsons' faults, lack of
courage is plainly not among them].

All in all,  though no doubt as imperfect as the rest
of us, Eleanor and Hubert seem to me quite good people
with at least as many virtues as vices - maybe more.
To my mind,  Lazarus' [1] dismissive attitude toward
them richly invites a boot up the backside.

[1]  I omit Ford, because his later experiences _may_
have caused him to modify his attirude. Afaik we
aren't told, but I give him the benefit of the doubt.

You've ignored the question, launching instead into a defense of
Eleanor's conduct, Michael. You've used the word &quot;snide&quot; to describe the
tone--i.e., &quot;mocking, sarcastic or underhanded or indirect.&quot;

I don't perceive the criticism at all indirect, underhanded, mocking or
sarcastic. Whether or not it is merited is moot in light of my question.
I may or may not care to argue about that question; but why don't you
first answer what I asked? Then maybe I'll discuss the other points you
raise in her defense. Defend the usage of the word &quot;snide,&quot; please.

Well, my _Webster's Concise DotEL_ doesn't use any of

nasty&quot;.

However, if you object to that particular word, I
would be quite happy to substitute some other.
&quot;Unjust&quot;, &quot;uncalled-for&quot; and &quot;derogatory&quot; all spring
to mind, and no doubt many more possibilities could be
added to the list. The English language is full of
them.

My basic point was that the attitude displayed  by
these major characters'  toward Eleanor (and Hubert)
diminished themselves and the story, and that, imho,
BBC7 was probably right to omit this from the radio
version.

The Oxford-American Dictionaries seem to depend more on the

&quot;Derogatory&quot; is too general; but we might agree upon either &quot;unjust&quot; or
&quot;uncalled-for&quot; as what your writing suggests to be your intended usage.

I probably agree about the omission. The Eleanor Johnson interludes seem
to have displayed a stray bee buzzing in Heinlein's bonnet whilst he
wrote _Methuselah's Children_, not truly essential to the story, used as
if it were an ornament to the structure of the overall tale, a filigree
or pattern in the finished tile, perhaps pleasing to some, distracting
to others, just as he used interjections such as those about supposed
current affairs (the &quot;silly season&quot; news items in SiaSL or Friday or,
more integral to the story, in &quot;Jackpot&quot;). It could be omitted without
doing great violence to theme or plot or color. It does, however, offer
a portrait in the development or lack of development of character
affected by stress and pressure. Whether that's essential I'll leave to
another.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes, any obsession, and I used the word deliberately, reveals badness or
at least ill-directed and wasteful efforts, even an obsession about
something as important as raising one's child. You don't need to be a
parent to observe that either, merely an astute observer.

&gt; After
&gt; all, if we ignore Lazarus' (and on one occasion
&gt; Ford's) opinions and just look at the record, what do
&gt; we actually _know_ about the Johnsons?

About Eleanor, we don't know enough, but we have hints enough to
conclude from what we see of her at the outset that she is immature (&quot;In
all her twenty-seven years ...&quot;), self-centered (&quot;her cherished first
home of her own with its ... thermostat which she could set to the
temperature she liked without consulting others&quot;), over-reacting to
stress (&quot;She herself had wept&quot;), and somewhat irrational (&quot;could anyone
be so wicked, so terribly wicked as to want to kill anyone as harmless
and helpless as herself and her baby&quot;), although a sympathetic object of
our pity, whether or not we indeed sympathize with her overwrought
fears.

I have to point out here that &quot;Ain't nuthin' really happened to her yet,
'cept she's got a little wet.&quot;

For comparison's sake, think about twenty-one-year-old Betty Zane with
that crucial keg of gunpowder clutched in a tablecloth over her shoulder
running twice, at first easily and apparently calmly and then faster as
they discerned the nature of her burden on her return and began firing
at her, through the war party of 600 British ranger and Shawnee savages
between her brother's blockhouse cabin and and the palisade of Ft.
Patrick Henry on today's site of Wheeling, West Virginia, in what was
probably the last battle of the American Revolution in September 1782.
See, Cptrs. 13 and 14 of Zane Gray's historical novel about the heroism
of his great-grandmother, _Betty Zane_, in which a party of 42 settlers,
men, women, and children, half of whom were killed in the attack, held
out until reinforcements arrived. http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1261
(_Betty Zane_ was the first book of my own that I read. My grandmother
gave it to me on my fifth Christmas in 1947, along with three
others--Robinson Crusoe, Black Beauty, and a biography of J. Edgar
Hoover. It was self-published by Gray in 1903, and became very popular,
leading to his own great popularity as a writer of American romances of
the western settlement of the United States.)

Eleanor Johnson, by contrast, is subject to panic terrors. Without
sufficient reason she comes close to crushing her own child. She reacts
to being steadied by an observer who observes she's obviously panicking
by formulating an irrational plan. Good God! She's going to pass her
infant over the heads of the crowd hoping they'll continue to pass the
child into the ship. Does she have rocks in her head? Someone,
distracted, is very likely to let the child fall and be crushed
underfoot before it gets fifteen feet. She's under a heavy burden, but
for a twenty-seven-year-old woman she lacks good sense and stability to
an amazing degree.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 1) When they are being rescued from the concentration

&gt; harm, an attitude I should expect Heinlein (never mind
&gt; King Solomon) to entirely approve.
">

Heinlein might approve the sentiment, as do I; but I doubt he approved
the means she planned anymore than I do. It was a stupid childish idea,
certain of failure. Would you try passing your infant child over the
head of a panicked mob trying to squeeze itself into overloaded
freighters? If she wants to sacrifice herself, she ought to turn and
surrender her child to her presumed pursuit, when and if it comes.
Perhaps they won't destroy the infant--the certain fate her imagination
perceives, and that's a better choice than the doom she picked. It at
least buys time for the infant. Hide the child among the bullrushes. It
worked once, so they say.

&gt; Hubert's education, teaching whichever class he

&gt; course now but less common whan MC was written) this
&gt; would seem a reasonable option if feasible.
">

You're arguing a straw man here. The only time 'home-schooling' is
necessary is when the other options are inadequate or not available.
There's no criticism (except Eleanor's implied conduct) of the systems
employed by the Howards to educate their children. Eleanor has shown no
particular skill or gift for education--her self-centered and immature
obsession militates the contrary; and, to the contrary, she shows a
deficiency perceived by many in responsible child care (&quot;Picking his way
through bodies there he almost stepped on a woman who was clutching a
baby too tightly to her. Barstow noticed the infant was wet and soiled
and he thought of ordering its mother to take care of the matter, since
she seemed awake.&quot;) (&quot;Eleanor Johnson had not been aware of his concern.
After the first great relief ... she had consigned all her worries to
her elders and now felt nothing but apathy ... .&quot;) Nice to know however
she keeps a &quot;close eye&quot; if that is what it was on his education. Perhaps
it makes up for her earlier failure to keep a close eye on the state of
his diaper. Slovenly would be the term my mother would use to describe
her conduct.

I don't think Lazarus' statement about Eleanor's refusal to take &quot;cold
sleep&quot; is a criticism incidentally (&quot;She's afraid she'll miss something
... I don't blame her. So am I.&quot;) He's simply trying to divert criticism
by Eleanor's 'friends' who are careful to make &quot;a point of keeping
Eleanor's deceased husband out of conversations.&quot; (Why? Does Eleanor
obsess on that fact too?)

That kind attempt goes south when Eleanor with her typical social
ineptness tries to and did embarrass him publicly by telling her
tablemates that he has turned down her marriage proposal. ('How dare
he!' is the tone I can easily read

Definately there is much overlap in meaning between &quot;spends&quot; and
&quot;flies jet aircraft&quot;. I think the only James Clavell I have is his
I Ching, which isn't as good as the Richard Wilhelm Translation rendered
into English by Cary F. Baynes. Since I found the latter I've not
touched the former, unless you count packing it to move somewhere else,
which has happened several times since I got both of them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know if there are any other Brits here who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; listened to it on BBC7 the other week, but unless
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; missed them, the snide references to Eleanor and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hubert Johnson were omitted from the radio
&gt; &gt; version.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, I did not miss them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What did you consider to be mocking, sarcastic or
&gt; &gt; underhanded or
&gt; &gt; &gt; indirect about the implicit and expressed criticism
&gt; &gt; of Eleanor's notions
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the child rearing of Hubert in _Methuselah's
&gt; &gt; Children_, Michael?

&gt; &gt; &gt; The tone of the observer's point of view expressed
&gt; &gt; seems rather more sad
&gt; &gt; &gt; and resignedly sympathetic about the reasons for but
&gt; &gt; unapproving at her
&gt; &gt; &gt; obsession than anything else.

&gt; Let me interject a point and counterpoint here before going on to
&gt; address Michael's main arguments concerning the Eleanor Johnson question:

&gt; &gt; &gt; You've ignored the question, launching instead into
&gt; &gt; a defense of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Eleanor's conduct, Michael. You've used the word
&gt; &gt; &quot;snide&quot; to describe the
&gt; &gt; &gt; tone--i.e., &quot;mocking, sarcastic or underhanded or
&gt; &gt; indirect.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't perceive the criticism at all indirect,
&gt; &gt; underhanded, mocking or
&gt; &gt; &gt; sarcastic. Whether or not it is merited is moot in
&gt; &gt; light of my question.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I may or may not care to argue about that question;
&gt; &gt; but why don't you
&gt; &gt; &gt; first answer what I asked? Then maybe I'll discuss
&gt; &gt; the other points you
&gt; &gt; &gt; raise in her defense. Defend the usage of the word
&gt; &gt; &quot;snide,&quot; please.

&gt; &gt; Well, my _Webster's Concise DotEL_ doesn't use any of
&gt; &gt; the above. It just defines &quot;snide&quot; as &quot;malicious or
&gt; &gt; nasty&quot;.

&gt; The Oxford-American Dictionaries seem to depend more on the
&gt; &quot;underhanded&quot; or &quot;devious&quot; aspects of the manner of criticism to define
&gt; &quot;snide&quot;-ness; but we're two peoples separated by a single language of
&gt; course, as often is observed.

&gt; &gt; However, if you object to that particular word, I
&gt; &gt; would be quite happy to substitute some other.
&gt; &gt; &quot;Unjust&quot;, &quot;uncalled-for&quot; and &quot;derogatory&quot; all spring
&gt; &gt; to mind, and no doubt many more possibilities could be
&gt; &gt; added to the list. The English language is full of
&gt; &gt; them.

&gt; &quot;Derogatory&quot; is too general; but we might agree upon either &quot;unjust&quot; or
&gt; &quot;uncalled-for&quot; as what your writing suggests to be your intended usage.

&gt; &gt; My basic point was that the attitude displayed  by
&gt; &gt; these major characters'  toward Eleanor (and Hubert)
&gt; &gt; diminished themselves and the story, and that, imho,
&gt; &gt; BBC7 was probably right to omit this from the radio
&gt; &gt; version.

&gt; I probably agree about the omission. The Eleanor Johnson interludes seem
&gt; to have displayed a stray bee buzzing in Heinlein's bonnet whilst he
&gt; wrote _Methuselah's Children_, not truly essential to the story, used as
&gt; if it were an ornament to the structure of the overall tale, a filigree
&gt; or pattern in the finished tile, perhaps pleasing to some, distracting
&gt; to others, just as he used interjections such as those about supposed
&gt; current affairs (the &quot;silly season&quot; news items in SiaSL or Friday or,
&gt; more integral to the story, in &quot;Jackpot&quot;). It could be omitted without
&gt; doing great violence to theme or plot or color. It does, however, offer
&gt; a portrait in the development or lack of development of character
&gt; affected by stress and pressure. Whether that's essential I'll leave to
&gt; another.

&gt; &gt; There is something bad about a mother being &quot;obsessed&quot;
&gt; &gt; with the safety and interests of her child - and
&gt; &gt; consistently putting his needs before her own?

&gt; Yes, any obsession, and I used the word deliberately, reveals badness or
&gt; at least ill-directed and wasteful efforts, even an obsession about
&gt; something as important as raising one's child. You don't need to be a
&gt; parent to observe that either, merely an astute observer.

&gt; &gt; After
&gt; &gt; all, if we ignore Lazarus' (and on one occasion
&gt; &gt; Ford's) opinions and just look at the record, what do
&gt; &gt; we actually _know_ about the Johnsons?

&gt; About Eleanor, we don't know enough, but we have hints enough to
&gt; conclude from what we see of her at the outset that she is immature (&quot;In
&gt; all her twenty-seven years ...&quot;), self-centered (&quot;her cherished first
&gt; home of her own with its ... thermostat which she could set to the
&gt; temperature she liked without consulting others&quot;), over-reacting to
&gt; stress (&quot;She herself had wept&quot;), and somewhat irrational (&quot;could anyone
&gt; be so wicked, so terribly wicked as to want to kill anyone as harmless
&gt; and helpless as herself and her baby&quot;), although a sympathetic object of
&gt; our pity, whether or not we indeed sympathize with her overwrought
&gt; fears.

&gt; I have to point out here that &quot;Ain't nuthin' really happened to her yet,
&gt; 'cept she's got a little wet.&quot;

&gt; For comparison's sake, think about twenty-one-year-old Betty Zane with
&gt; that crucial keg of gunpowder clutched in a tablecloth over her shoulder
&gt; running twice, at first easily and apparently calmly and then faster as
&gt; they discerned the nature of her burden on her return and began firing
&gt; at her, through the war party of 600 British ranger and Shawnee savages
&gt; between her brother's blockhouse cabin and and the palisade of Ft.
&gt; Patrick Henry on today's site of Wheeling, West Virginia, in what was
&gt; probably the last battle of the American Revolution in September 1782.
&gt; See, Cptrs. 13 and 14 of Zane Gray's historical novel about the heroism
&gt; of his great-grandmother, _Betty Zane_, in which a party of 42 settlers,
&gt; men, women, and children, half of whom were killed in the attack, held
&gt; out until reinforcements arrived. http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1261
&gt; (_Betty Zane_ was the first book of my own that I read. My grandmother
&gt; gave it to me on my fifth Christmas in 1947, along with three
&gt; others--Robinson Crusoe, Black Beauty, and a biography of J. Edgar
&gt; Hoover. It was self-published by Gray in 1903, and became very popular,
&gt; leading to his own great popularity as a writer of American romances of
&gt; the western settlement of the United States.)

&gt; Eleanor Johnson, by contrast, is subject to panic terrors. Without
&gt; sufficient reason she comes close to crushing her own child. She reacts
&gt; to being steadied by an observer who observes she's obviously panicking
&gt; by formulating an irrational plan. Good God! She's going to pass her
&gt; infant over the heads of the crowd hoping they'll continue to pass the
&gt; child into the ship. Does she have rocks in her head? Someone,
&gt; distracted, is very likely to let the child fall and be crushed
&gt; underfoot before it gets fifteen feet. She's under a heavy burden, but
&gt; for a twenty-seven-year-old woman she lacks good sense and stability to
&gt; an amazing degree.

&gt; &gt; 1) When they are being rescued from the concentration
&gt; &gt; camp, and Eleanor fears they may not all get onto the
&gt; &gt; ship, she plans to pass Hubert through the crowd so
&gt; &gt; that he gets on even if she doesn't. IOW she is ready
&gt; &gt; to lose her son forever rather than let him come to
&gt; &gt; harm, an attitude I should expect Heinlein (never mind
&gt; &gt; King Solomon) to entirely approve.

&gt; Heinlein might approve the sentiment, as do I; but I doubt he approved
&gt; the means she planned anymore than I do. It was a stupid childish idea,
&gt; certain of failure. Would you try passing your infant child over the
&gt; head of a panicked mob trying to squeeze itself into overloaded
&gt; freighters? If she wants to sacrifice herself, she ought to turn and
&gt; surrender her child to her presumed pursuit, when and if it comes.
&gt; Perhaps they won't destroy the infant--the certain fate her imagination
&gt; perceives, and that's a better choice than the doom she picked. It at
&gt; least buys time for the infant. Hide the child among the bullrushes. It
&gt; worked once, so they say.

&gt; &gt; 2) On board ship, Eleanor keeps a close eye on
&gt; &gt; Hubert's education, teaching whichever class he
&gt; &gt; happens to be in at the time.  Assuming she is not in
&gt; &gt; a position to simply educate him at home (an obvious
&gt; &gt; course now but less common whan MC was written) this
&gt; &gt; would seem a reasonable option if feasible.

&gt; You're arguing a straw man here. The only time 'home-schooling' is
&gt; necessary is when the other options are inadequate or not available.
&gt; There's no criticism (except Eleanor's implied conduct) of the systems
&gt; employed by the Howards to educate their children. Eleanor has shown no
&gt; particular skill or gift for education--her self-centered and immature
&gt; obsession militates the contrary; and, to the contrary, she shows a
&gt; deficiency perceived by many in responsible child care (&quot;Picking his way
&gt; through bodies there he almost stepped on a woman who was clutching a
&gt; baby too tightly to her. Barstow noticed the infant was wet and soiled
&gt; and he thought of ordering its mother to take care of the matter, since
&gt; she seemed awake.&quot;) (&quot;Eleanor Johnson had not been aware of his concern.
&gt; After the first great relief ... she had consigned all her worries to
&gt; her elders and now felt nothing but apathy ... .&quot;) Nice to know however
&gt; she keeps a &quot;close eye&quot; if that is what it was on his education. Perhaps
&gt; it makes up for her earlier failure to keep a close eye on the state of
&gt; his diaper. Slovenly would be the term my mother would use to describe
&gt; her conduct.

&gt; I don't think Lazarus' statement about Eleanor's refusal to take &quot;cold
&gt; sleep&quot; is a criticism incidentally (&quot;She's afraid she'll miss something
&gt; ... I don't blame her. So am I.&quot;) He's simply trying to divert criticism
&gt; by Eleanor's 'friends' who are careful to make &quot;a point of keeping
&gt; Eleanor's deceased husband
