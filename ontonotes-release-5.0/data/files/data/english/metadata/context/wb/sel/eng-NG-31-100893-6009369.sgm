[T]he "deductions" of Sherlock Holmes: I have ... been interested in
the discrepancy between "deduction" in detective mysteries and
"deduction" in the logic books. Doyle's use of the word "deduction"
only reflects how the word has been commonly used--not only by ordinary
people, but also by educated people. To most people, any kind of
inference is a "deduction."

I don't see that it helps to say that the common usage is "wrong" and
that the technical usage is "right." I would think that if one is
knowledgeable on a certain subject and wants to convey that information
to others, it would be best to point out that within that subject
matter the use of a word differs from common usage.

If I tell someone that I have "deduced" something, they think they know
what I mean. If I talk to someone about "induction," I have lost them.
They think they know what I mean if I talk about "learning from
experience." As with so many difficult words, one problem with
"induction" is that the word has been used in so many different ways.
"Induction" might mean:

* To elicit a theory.

* To verify a theory.

* To elicit a higher principle.

* To elicit an ordinary fact.

Supposedly the purpose of induction is to establish "first principles."
Yet the process by which an ordinary person establishes everyday
"facts" (e.g., the attributes of objects) falls right in line with
descriptions of "induction." It appears to me that induction in this
common form (or "epagoge," or whatever it ought to be called) does not
have to be an "act of reasoning"; at times it can be an automatic
process--a brain process that during the course of observation produces
"intuitions" for me without any effort on my part.

The kind of inference that Sherlock Holmes frequently used can be
typified in a statement that politicians are fond off "If it walks like
a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck." In other words, "If it has
an attribute distinctive to that kind of thing, it is that thing."
Apparently we can take this a step further: "If it is that thing, then
it will have all of the other attributes of that thing." If it quacks,
it can swim. If it's Jack's voice on the phone, then it's that rascal
Jack at the other end of the line.

What is assumed in such cases is that the object has certain attributes
and that some of these attributes are distinctive to the object. What
we could use is a simple, non-convoluted description of this kind of
inference. Apparently some of C.S. Peirce's work pertains to the
matter.

Far from being only a matter of literary interest, the stories and
novels of the Sherlock Holmes series have been studied and commented by
scholars from the most varied scientific disciplines: criminology,
logic, epistemology, economics, psychology, and sociology.

The area of logic and epistemology has without doubt been focused on
the most. Holmes' investigative method - a fine example of Late
Nineteenth Century positivism - has been analysed and debated by
illustrious scholars and academics. The prevailing conclusion, which
contradicts the use of deductive logic on several occasions declared by
Holmes himself within the stories and most completely formulated in the
article The Book of Life, is that his way of proceeding corresponds
with a hybrid methodology. The investigative path sees a continuous
interaction and overlapping of induction and deduction, of theoretical
hypotheses and empirical evidence. In strictly epistemological terms,
"abduction" is perhaps the word which best describes Holmes'
proceeding. The term was originally formulated by Aristotle, while its
revival in modern logic is largely owed to Charles Peirce. Abduction
can be defined as a syllogism in which the second premise has only the
character of probability. Even if for other aspects similar to the
deductive process, the differences are considerable, starting with the
less certain character of the conclusion which can be reached, that can
never be superior to that of the second premise. In the literary field
we come across at least one other character - not an investigator
this time - who often resorts to this kind of reasoning: Voltaire's
Zadig. The scholars' opinions on the exact classification of
Holmes' method vary considerably, but abduction seems to receive the
largest support. The only commonly accepted point seems to be the fact
that it is definitely not a deductive process. The concept of
induction, the process which from the gathering of empirical
information comes to the formulation of a theoretical conclusion (law,
empirical generalisation), describes the followed path much better. The
deductive process is actually contradicted and condemned, with various
formulations, by Holmes himself in several stories: "It is a capital
mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the
judgment (STUD)"; "It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has
data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of
theories to suit facts (SCAN)"; "Data! data! data! I can't make bricks
without clay (COPP)"; "It is a capital mistake to theorize in advance
of the facts (SECO)"; "The temptation to form premature theories upon
insufficient data is the bane of our profession (VALL)".

The epistemological expressions so frequent in Holmes' stories -
theory, hypothesis, deduction, verification, inference - are
therefore often used somewhat loosely. However, the occasional improper
use of the term "deduction" by someone who is not an expert in logic or
social sciences, even for someone as precise and methodical as Holmes,
can easily be justified. In everyday language the term is often used in
a rather approximate sense, describing any analytical process based on
logical concatenations. However, the fact remains that Holmes does
actually not adopt the sociological perspective of grounded theory -
the construction of a theory on the sole basis of the empirical facts
available, without a precise starting hypothesis - which on several
occasions he declares to apply. Holmes' actions are almost always
inspired by a precise working hypothesis, based on the few facts which
are initially available to him and on his previous experiences with
similar cases and perfected as the analysis of the available empirical
elements proceeds. The initial hypothesis has been proved wrong on
several occasions: even if the investigator professes many times to
have identified the solution to a mystery or the right trail as soon as
the person who submitted the case entered the Baker Street room or
finished his account of the situation, Holmes' investigations are
anything but free of false trails and blunders. The myth of the
infallible detective is just that - a myth. Irene Adler docet. Even
if he is considered to be the paradigmatic example of rational and
scientific investigation, Holmes is further not at all dogmatic in his
positivism, such as when he states that "imagination is often the
mother of truth (VALL)" or that "the impression of a woman may be more
valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner (TWIS)". In
actual fact, in the solving of various cases elements such as
imagination or intuition proved much more important and useful to
Holmes than the detective would like to admit. It is for this reason,
and because the end result of the process is considered more important
than the method used to reach it, that various scholars consider him to
be a forerunner of Paul Feyerabend's methodological anarchism.

Holmes' investigations are largely regarded and of absolute interest
also as examples of the recourse to the technique of observation,
frequently used in disciplines such as anthropology, sociology and
social psychology, as well as in clinical diagnosis. In most cases it
is a naturalistic, non invasive kind of observation, even if the person
being observed is usually aware of the profession of the observer. In
other occasions it is a participant kind of observation, where the
observer interacts actively and in a position of anonymity with the
other components of a particular group. Holmes' skill in disguise and
the knowledge of usages and customs of a wide range of social classes
explains his extreme ease in entering and passing unobserved in most
various contexts. He could, for example, wander around the worst areas
of London or mix up with the domestic staff of people involved in his
investigations without arousing the slightest suspicion. If Holmes'
ability to follow trails and examine material objects is extraordinary,
his most stimulating and surprising deductions are without doubt those
regarding people. On the basis of the observation of their physical
characteristics and dressing Holmes could deduce, with nearly absolute
precision, an amazing number of attributes: social class, profession,
civil status, present and previous illnesses, sight problems and much
more. He could also understand and predict their behaviour in the
different social situations fairly accurately. Reading Holmes'
stories could therefore prove excellent practice for those intending to
use these research techniques, which are currently popular especially
in researches which focuses on the participants of particular social
events (concerts, exhibitions, meetings, museum visitors). The
usefulness of these techniques has been much discussed and diversely
appraised over the course of history of the social sciences. If the
behavioural movement - at its height between 1930 and 1960 -
considered the observed information the fundamental empirical element
and starting point for every further scientific analysis, many scholars
subsequently pointed out the incongruities between manifest behaviour
and the intentions and convictions of the subject, attributing greater
value to his direct declarations, to be gathered through techniques
such as the structured questionnaire or the personal interview.

Sherlock Holmes and Probabilistic Induction

(Q0) "From a drop of water," said the writer, "a logician could infer
the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or
heard of one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of
which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all
other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only
be acquired by long and patient study, nor is life long enough to allow
any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it. " [A Study
in Scarlet, pt. 1, ch. 2] Sherlock Holmes.

We can find many words in Holmes stories which may be used as an
evidence for showing that he was a logician. First of all, he
frequently characterizes himself as a logician. Quotation Q0 is one of
such examples. Here, he speaks of what a logician can do, as well as of
what a logician should do. It is certainly a typical task of a logician
to do "deduction and analysis," and he or she should work hard in order
to be a good logician!

And secondly, many of his words clearly show his stance as a logician.
The following quotations are typical examples:

(Q1) "Some facts should be suppressed, or at least, a just sense of
proportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in the
case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from
effects to causes, by which I succeeded in unravelling it." [The Sign
of Four, ch.1]

(Q2) "it is not really difficult to construct a series of inferences,
each dependent upon its predecessor and each simple in itself. If,
after doing so, one simply knocks out all the central inferences and
presents one's audience with the starting-point and the conclusion, one
may produce a startling, though possibly a meretricious, effect. " [The
Adventure of the Dancing Men]

Quotation Q1 shows where his interest is, when he reads a report of
criminal investigations; and since he is only interested in the method
of reasoning, it is clear that his stance is nothing but a logician's.

Quotation Q2 shows, again, his stance as a logician, because he
analyzes a certain effect of logical reasoning; and his analysis and
observation touch upon some of the essential characteristics of logical
reasoning. Each single step of logical reasoning is so easy, so
obvious; but by combining such easy steps two or three, you lose sight
of the necessary connection between the premisses and the conclusion.
Take an extreme example: before 1931, who could see such a result as
Goedel's Theorem may be obtained?

Thus, my hypothesis that Holmes was a good logician seems very
promising. But its proof may not be sufficient; so let us continue our
examination, getting into more specific features of his reasoning and
his opinions about what he is doing.

------------------------------------------

3. Key words of Holmes's theory of reasoning

There are several key words when Holmes characterizes his own method of
reasoning.

Method by elimination, method of exclusion

(Q3) "By the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no
other hypothesis would meet the facts." [A Study in Scarlet, pt. 2, ch.
7]

(Q4) "You will not apply my precept," he said, shaking his head. "How
often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible,
whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?" [The Sign of
Four, ch. 6]

[Let me give you a simple example of this method. In the beginning part
of The Sign of Four, Holmes surprizes Watson by telling him that Watson
went to the post-office in order to send a telegram. His reasoning may
be put in the following form:

(1) A v B v C (this is already proved from other sources);

(2) -A (from observational evidence);

(3) -B (from observational evidence);

(4) therefore, C (conclusion).

(Let A, B, C mean, respectively, "Watson went to the post-office in
order to send a letter"; or "in order to buy stamps or postcards"; or
"in order to send a telegram.")

This seems simple and perfectly all right. But Holmes's eliminative
method may not be as simple as this, if we want to take into
consideration the link between the three premisses and their evidence,
which may be probabilistic. Notice that in (Q4), eliminative method is
somehow combined with the consideration of probability or
improbability.]

Next, it is interesting to notice that Holmes seldom uses the word
"induction," when he speaks of his own method. Instead, he prefers the
word "hypothesis."

Hypothesis

(Q5) "I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would
cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct
can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt
find waiting for us." [The Adventure of the Copper Beeches]

(Q6) "Where is he, then?"

"I have already said that he must have gone to King's Pyland or to
Mapleton. He is not at King's Pyland. Therefore he is at Mapleton. Let
us take that as a working hypothesis and see what it leads us to."
[Silver Blaze]

So far, even a layman can understand what Holmes wanted to say. But we
need good philosophical knowledge in order to understand the following
words:

Analytical reasoning, synthetic reasoning (reasoning backward,
reasoning forward)

(Q7) "I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is
usually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this
sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backward. That is a very
useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise
it much. In the everyday affairs of life it is more useful to reason
forward, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who
can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically."

"Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you
what the result would be. They can put those events together in their
minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are
few people, however, who, if told them a result, would be able to
evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led
up to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning
backward, or analytically." [A Study in Scarlet, pt.2, ch.7]

Comments: As you may well know, Cartesian analysis is a procedure like
this: given a problem to be solved, we examine the conditions to be
fulfilled, and divide them into simpler conditions which are easier to
solve (in Descartes's words, "divide each of the difficulties I was
examining into as many parts as possible and as is required to solve
them best"). We go backward, so to speak, from the given problem to the
simpler and solvable constituents. In the preceding quotation, Holmes
explains a similar procedure in terms of cause-effect relations; i.e.,
given a problem consisting of a number of facts (effects), we go
backward in search for their unknown causes. (Presumably, Holmes
adopted this way of explanation because this was easier for Dr. Watson
to understand!)

[By the way, eliminative method and analysis are closely related. We
can show this by means of Jevons's idea of logical alphabets. For
example, given three propositions A, B, C, we can form logical
alphabets in the following way: for each proposition, there are two
possibilities, either affirmation or negation; so let us signify the
former by a Capital letter, the latter by a lower case letter. And
further, let us understand that juxtaposing two or more letters means a
logical conjunction. Then, we can express all the possibilities out of
these three propositions by the following eight conjunctions, which are
Jevons's logical alphabets in this case:

ABC, ABc, AbC, Abc, aBC, aBc, abC, abc.

And these correspond to Descartes's "as many parts as is required to
solve them best." The process of reasoning is essentially eliminative
in that, given any information, this information eliminates some of the
logical alphabets; and what remains after all premisses are
represented, that is the conclusion. This process takes place within
the framework of Cartesian analysis.]

We finally come to the most important key word:

Balance of probabilities

(Q8) "Ah,that is good luck. I could only say what was the balance of
probability. I did not at all expect to be so accurate."

"But it was not mere guesswork?"

"No, no: I never guess. It is a shocking habit---destructive to the
logical faculty. What seems strange to you is only so because you do
not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which
large inferences may depend." [The Sign of Four, ch. 1]

(Q9) "We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork," said Dr.
Mortimer.

"Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and choose
the most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagination, but we
have always some material basis on which to start our speculation."
[The Hound of the Baskervilles, ch. 4]

Scientific use of the imagination

See the last quotation above.

We have to notice that Sherlock Holmes is contrasting his method, which
essentially depends on the balance of probabilities, with "mere
guesswork," which he despises as destructive to the logical faculty. He
is saying that his method is logical and scientific, although it might
seem uncertain or unstable to a layman, like Watson or Mortimer.

It should be clear by now, from these examinations of key words, that
Sherlock Holmes's method of reasoning has a firmer structure than you
might have imagined at first sight. Is there any theory of scientific
method which captures all or almost all of these features? Let us next
see some of the 19th century methodologists.

As I recall, "deduction" means reaching conclusions about particulars
given general principles. "Induction" means to reach conclusions about
generalities given particulars.

Holmes is using deduction, because he goes from general principles
(e.g., that wearing a certain kind of hat denotes frugality) to
deducing things about the specific person or situation in front of
him.

However, these are not the ways in which "deduction" and "deducing"
are used in everyday language. Mostly because people don't know the
technical meaning of the terms.

(As it happens, "mathematical induction" is really a kind of
deduction, because from a general principle we deduce that a property
holds in specific instances).

Holmes's reasonings are usually "inferences to the best explanation".
Here's some data (in the best sort of story, a very puzzling
combination of data that "makes no sense"). Then here's an explanation
(which makes everything fall into place).

But it is (usually) at least logically possible that the explanation is
false. (That logic point is exploited by post-Holmsian stories where an
apparently convincing explanation of the murders is arrived at, only
for another murder to happen when the initially accused has a cast-iron
alibi.) If we use "deduction" in the logician's sense of absolutely
watertight inference -- where if the premisses are true, it is simply
impossible for the conclusion to be false -- then the detective's
"deductions", i.e. his inferences to the best explanation, are not
deductions. (Of course, it's just by conventional stipulation that
logicians nowadays use "deduction" in the narrow sense: what matters is
the distinction that is thereby marked between inferences to tbe best
explanation which are defeasible, and strict logical inferences which
aren't.)

I agree and maybe Holmes was just using the language of lawyers and the
courts of the times. I agree with one of the authors I pasted also that
at one time deduction meant one thing in normal language, (inference)
and another in formal philosophy. What would Holmes do if he were
called into the court-room as a whitness and then upon
cross-examination he was questioned about his usage of "deduction,"
what word would he use himself to clarify the difference between
necessary truths and theories?

Reminds me of this debate;

W. V. Quine's paper Two Dogmas of Empiricism, published 1951, is one of
the most celebrated papers of twentieth century philosophy in the
analytic tradition. The paper is an attack on two central parts of the
logical positivists' philosophy. One is the distinction between
analytic truths and synthetic truths, explained by Quine as truths
grounded only in meanings and independent of facts, and truths grounded
in facts. The other is reductionism, which is the theory that each
meaningful statement gets its meaning from some logical construction of
terms which refers exclusively to immediate experience.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Dogmas_of_Empiricism

Quine's "Two Dogmas" is a concerted attack on the analytic/synthetic
distinction. At first this might seem to be a fairly easily dispensable
part of the positivist picture. But Quine shows that it is in fact
crucial to the positivist view that theoretical sentences are definable
in terms of observation sentences, and thus also to their defense of
reductionism and foundationalism.

http://www.trinity.edu/cbrown/language/quine_two_dogmas.html

In "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" Quine argues there is no clear
distinction among statements according to whether their truth-value
depends on their empirical or extra-linguistic or factual content.
While he's right that some synthetic statements are more synthetic than
others, and that the vagueness of definitions can make it hard to tell
whether a given statement is analytic, he's wrong to think that these
two points imply that "a boundary between analytic and synthetic
statement simply has not been drawn".

http://artsweb.uwaterloo.ca/~jmikhael/Coherentism.htm

- A priori/a posteriori, analytic/synthetic, necessary/contingent

...three ways to characterize statements that are of particular
interest to the philosopher: each statement is (i) either necessary or
contingent, (ii) either analytic or synthetic, (iii) either a priori or
empirical (or a posteriori). We shall now take a brief look at how
these three distinctions are interrelated.

First, notice that these three distinctions pertain to three distinct
aspects of a statement.

1. The necessary/contingent distinction concerns the modal status of a
statement. To say that a statement is necessarily true is to say that
it must be true or that it is true in all possible worlds. A statement
is contingently true in case it just happens to be true because of the
way the actual world is.

2. The analytic/synthetic distinction concerns the basis of a
statement's truth or falsity. To say that a statement is analytically
true is to say that its truth is grounded solely in the meaning of its
terms and the laws of logic. A statement is synthetically true just in
case its truth is not grounded exclusively on the meaning of its terms
and on the laws of logic.

3. The a priori/a posteriori distinction concerns the epistemic status
of a statement. To say that a statement is true a priori is to say that
its truth can be known without appeal to experience. A statement is
true a posteriori just in case its truth can only be known by relying
on experience.

Having noted the differences between these three distinctions, consider
their similarities. The most striking observation about these three
distinctions is that they seem to divide up the set of statements into
exactly the same subclasses. That is, we can use each one of the three
distinctions to divide the set of statements into two classes: the one
consists of necessary, analytic, and a priori statements; the other
contains contingent, synthetic, and a posteriori statements. But this
neat division of statements into two groups is not universally
accepted. The most notable dissenters have been Immanuel Kant and, in
our times, Saul Kripke. Kant argued that some statements are necessary,
synthetic and a priori; for example, "Every event has a cause." Ever
since, "the problem of the synthetic a priori" has occupied a fairly
central position on the philosophical stage. Recently, Kripke argued
that some statements are necessary, synthetic, and a posteriori. "Water
is H2O," "Heat is mean molecular energy," and other such theoretical
identifications are examples of such a posteriori necessities.

&gt; Holmes is using deduction, because he goes from general principles
&gt; (e.g., that wearing a certain kind of hat denotes frugality) to
&gt; deducing things about the specific person or situation in front of
&gt; him.

&gt; However, these are not the ways in which &quot;deduction&quot; and &quot;deducing&quot;
&gt; are used in everyday language. Mostly because people don't know the
&gt; technical meaning of the terms.

&gt; (As it happens, &quot;mathematical induction&quot; is really a kind of
&gt; deduction, because from a general principle we deduce that a property
&gt; holds in specific instances).

Two views of Deduction &amp; Induction:

View 1: conclusion;
Deduction = infers particular from general truths
Induction = infers general from particular truths

View 2: conclusion;
Deduction = follows with absolute necessity
Induction = follows with some degree of probability

Deduction and Induction From
Introduction to Logic Irving M. Copi

1.6 Deduction and Induction

Arguments are traditionally divided into two different types, deductive
and inductive. Every argument involves the claim (noted earlier) that
its premisses provide some grounds for the truth of its conclusion, but
only a deductive argument involves the claim that its premisses provide
conclusive grounds for its conclusion. When the reasoning in a
deductive argument is correct, we call that argument valid; when the
reasoning of a deductive argument is incorrect, we call that argument
invalid.

We may therefore define validity as follows. A deductive argument is
valid when its premisses, if true, do provide conclusive grounds for
the truth of its conclusion. In a valid deductive argument (but not in
an inductive argument), premisses and conclusion are so related that it
is absolutely impossible for the premisses to be true unless the
conclusion is true also.

In every deductive argument, either the premisses succeed in providing
conclusive grounds for the truth of the conclusion, or they do not
succeed. Therefore, every deductive argument is either valid or
invalid. This is a point of some importance: If a deductive argument is
not valid, it must be invalid; if it is not invalid, it must be valid.
But note that the terms "valid" and "invalid" do not apply to inductive
arguments; for inductive arguments, other terms of appraisal are
required.

In the realm of deductive logic, the central task is to clarify the
relation between premisses and conclusion in valid arguments, and thus
to allow us to discriminate valid from invalid arguments...

An inductive argument makes a very different claim: not that its
premisses give conclusive grounds for the truth of its conclusion, but
only that its premisses provide some support for that conclusion.
Inductive arguments, therefore, cannot be "valid" or "invalid" in the
sense in which these terms are applied to deductive arguments. Of
course, inductive arguments may be evaluated as better or worse,
according to the degree of support given to their conclusions by their
premisses. Thus, the greater the likelihood, or probability, that its
premisses confer on its conclusion, the greater the merit of an
inductive argument. But that likelihood, even when the premisses are
all true, must fall short of certainty. The theory of induction and the
methods of calculating probabilities are presented in Part 3 of this
book.

The distinction between deductive and inductive arguments is sometimes
drawn in a different way-centering on the relative generality of their
premisses and conclusions. Deductive inferences, it is sometimes said,
move from the general to the particular, while inductive inferences
move from the particular to the general. On analysis, this way of
distinguishing them proves unsatisfactory. ["William Whewell, in The
Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences (1840), put it thus: ". . . in
Deduction we infer particular from general truths; while in Induction
we infer general from particular."]

In that tradition, the classical example of a deductive argument:

All humans are mortal.
Socrates is human.
Therefore Socrates is mortal.

does indeed have a particular conclusion, inferred validly from two
premisses of which the first is a general or universal proposition.
[The term "particular" was used by Whewell, and other logicians in his
tradition, to refer to propositions about a single thing (e.g.,
Socrates) as well as to propositions about some but not necessarily all
members of a given class (e.g., some humans). More recent logical
practice uses the phrase "particular propositions" to refer only to the
latter group. At this point, we are examining Whewell's view and
therefore follow his usage.] It is also true that a very common form of
inductive argument is one in which a general or universal conclusion is
inferred from a group of premisses, all of which are particular, as in
this example:

Socrates is human and mortal.
Xanthippe is human and mortal
Sappho is human and mortal.
Therefore probably all humans are mortal.

But this method of distinguishing between deduction and induction does
not always work. The difficulty lies in the fact that a valid deductive
argument may have universal propositions for its conclusion as well as
for its premisses, as in:

All animals are mortal.
All humans are animals.
Therefore all humans are mortal.

And a valid deductive argument may have particular propositions for its
premisses as well as for its conclusion, as in:

If Socrates is human then Socrates is mortal.
Socrates is human.
Therefore Socrates is mortal.

Moreover, an inductive argument need not rely only on particular
premisses but may have universal (i.e., general) propositions for its
premisses as well for its conclusions, as in:

All cows are mammals and have lungs.
All whales are mammals and have lungs.
All humans are mammals and have lungs.
Therefore probably all mammals have lungs.

And further, an inductive argument may have a particular proposition as
its conclusion, as in:

Hitler was a dictator and was ruthless.
Stalin was a dictator and was ruthless.
Castro is a dictator.
Therefore Castro is probably ruthless.

These counterexamples show that it is not satisfactory to characterize
deductive arguments as those in which particular conclusions are
inferred from general premisses; nor is it satisfactory to characterize
inductive arguments as those in which general conclusions are inferred
from particular premisses.

The fundamental difference between these two kinds of argument lies in
the claims that are made about the relations between premisses and
conclusion. Deductive arguments are those in which a very strict or
close relationship is claimed to hold between the premisses and the
conclusions. If a deductive argument is valid, then, given the truth of
its premisses, its conclusion must be true no matter what else may be
the case.

For example, if it is true that all humans are mortal, and if it is
true that Socrates is a human, then it must be true that Socrates is
mortal no matter what else may be true in the world and no matter what
other premisses are added or other information discovered. If we find
that Socrates is ugly, or that angels are immortal, or that cows give
milk, this finding affects the validity of the argument not one bit;
the conclusion that Socrates is mortal follows from any enlarged set of
premisses with deductive certainty, just as it did from the two
premisses originally given. If an argument is valid, nothing additional
in the world can make it more valid; if a conclusion is validly
inferred from some set of premisses, nothing can be added to that set
to make that conclusion follow more validly or more strictly or more
logically.

But the relation between premisses and conclusion claimed for even the
best inductive argument is much less strict and very different in kind.
Consider the following inductive argument:

Most corporation lawyers are conservatives.
Barbara Shane is a corporation lawyer.
Therefore Barbara Shane is probably a conservative.

This is a pretty good inductive argument; its first premiss is true,
and if its second premiss is also true, its conclusion is more likely
true than false. But in this case, if new premisses are added to the
original pair the resulting argument may be substantially weakened or
(depending on the premisses added) strengthened. Suppose we add the
premiss that

Barbara Shane is an officer of the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU).

and also add the (true) premiss that:

Most officers of the ACLU are not conservatives.

Now the conclusion [that Barbara Shane is a conservative] no longer
seems very probable; the original inductive argument has been greatly
weakened by the presence of this additional information about Barbara
Shane. Indeed, if the final premiss were transformed into the universal
proposition:

No officers of the ACLU are conservatives.

the opposite of the original conclusion would now follow deductively,
that is, validly, from the set of premisses affirmed.

On the other hand, if we enlarge the original set of premisses by
adding the following additional premisses instead:

Barbara Shane served in the cabinet of President Ronald Reagan.

and

Barbara Shane has long been an officer of the National Rifle

A Scandal in Bohemia

To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom
heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she
eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that
he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions,
and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but
admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect
reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as
a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He
never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer.
They were admirable things for the observer -- excellent for draw-
ing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained
teasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which
might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a
sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power
lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a
nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him,
and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and ques-
tionable memory.
I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us
away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the
home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first
finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to
absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form
of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodg-
ings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating
from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsi-
ness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature.
He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and
occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of
observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those
mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official
police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his
doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff
murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson
brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had
accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning
family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however,
which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I
knew little of my former friend and companion.
One night -- it was on the twentieth of March, 1888 -- I was
returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to
civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I
passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associ-
ated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of
the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see
Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordi-
nary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I
looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark
silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly,
eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped
behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his
attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again.
He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon
the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown
up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.
His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad,
I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly
eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of
cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner.
Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular
introspective fashion.
"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that
you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."
"Seven!" I answered.
"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle
more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You
did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."
"Then, how do you know?"
"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been
getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy
and careless servant girl?"
"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would
certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It
is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a
dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine
how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my
wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you
work it out."
He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands
together.
"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the
inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the
leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have
been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round
the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.
Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in
vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-
slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a
gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a
black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a
bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has
secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not
pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession."
I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained
his process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons,"
I remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridicu-
lously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each
successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you
explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good
as yours."
"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing
himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not
observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have fre-
quently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."
"Frequently."
"How often?"
"Well, some hundreds of times."
"Then how many are there?"
"How many? I don't know."
"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen.
That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen
steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way,
since you are interested in these little problems, and since you
are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experi-
ences, you may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of
thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon
the table. "It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."
The note was undated, and without either signature or address.

"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight
o'clock [it said], a gentleman who desires to consult you
upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent
services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown
that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters
which are of an importance which can hardly be exagger-
ated. This account of you we have from all quarters re-
ceived. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not
take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.

"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you
imagine that it means?"
"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before
one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories,
instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you
deduce from it?"
I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it
was written.
"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I
remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes.
"Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It
is peculiarly strong and stiff."
"Peculiar -- that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an
English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."
I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a
large "G" with a small "f" woven into the texture of the paper.
"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.
"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."
"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesell-
schaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary
contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.'
Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer."
He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. "Eglow,
Eglonitz -- here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking
country -- in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as

&gt; &gt; explanation which are defeasible, and strict logical inferences which
&gt; &gt; aren't.)

&gt; I agree and maybe Holmes was just using the language of lawyers and the
&gt; courts of the times. I agree with one of the authors I pasted also that
&gt; at one time deduction meant one thing in normal language, (inference)
&gt; and another in formal philosophy. What would Holmes do if he were
&gt; called into the court-room as a whitness and then upon
&gt; cross-examination he was questioned about his usage of &quot;deduction,&quot;
&gt; what word would he use himself to clarify the difference between
&gt; necessary truths and theories?

&gt; Reminds me of this debate;

&gt; W. V. Quine's paper Two Dogmas of Empiricism, published 1951, is one of
&gt; the most celebrated papers of twentieth century philosophy in the
&gt; analytic tradition. The paper is an attack on two central parts of the
&gt; logical positivists' philosophy. One is the distinction between
&gt; analytic truths and synthetic truths, explained by Quine as truths
&gt; grounded only in meanings and independent of facts, and truths grounded
&gt; in facts. The other is reductionism, which is the theory that each
&gt; meaningful statement gets its meaning from some logical construction of
&gt; terms which refers exclusively to immediate experience.

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Dogmas_of_Empiricism

&gt; Quine's &quot;Two Dogmas&quot; is a concerted attack on the analytic/synthetic
&gt; distinction. At first this might seem to be a fairly easily dispensable
&gt; part of the positivist picture. But Quine shows that it is in fact
&gt; crucial to the positivist view that theoretical sentences are definable
&gt; in terms of observation sentences, and thus also to their defense of
&gt; reductionism and foundationalism.

&gt; http://www.trinity.edu/cbrown/language/quine_two_dogmas.html

&gt; In &quot;Two Dogmas of Empiricism&quot; Quine argues there is no clear
&gt; distinction among statements according to whether their truth-value
&gt; depends on their empirical or extra-linguistic or factual content.
&gt; While he's right that some synthetic statements are more synthetic than
&gt; others, and that the vagueness of definitions can make it hard to tell
&gt; whether a given statement is analytic, he's wrong to think that these
&gt; two points imply that &quot;a boundary between analytic and synthetic
&gt; statement simply has not been drawn&quot;.

&gt; http://artsweb.uwaterloo.ca/~jmikhael/Coherentism.htm

&gt; - A priori/a posteriori, analytic/synthetic, necessary/contingent

&gt; ...three ways to characterize statements that are of particular
&gt; interest to the philosopher: each statement is (i) either necessary or
&gt; contingent, (ii) either analytic or synthetic, (iii) either a priori or
&gt; empirical (or a posteriori). We shall now take a brief look at how
&gt; these three distinctions are interrelated.

&gt; First, notice that these three distinctions pertain to three distinct
&gt; aspects of a statement.

&gt; 1. The necessary/contingent distinction concerns the modal status of a
&gt; statement. To say that a statement is necessarily true is to say that
&gt; it must be true or that it is true in all possible worlds. A statement
&gt; is contingently true in case it just happens to be true because of the
&gt; way the actual world is.

&gt; 2. The analytic/synthetic distinction concerns the basis of a
&gt; statement's truth or falsity. To say that a statement is analytically
&gt; true is to say that its truth is grounded solely in the meaning of its
&gt; terms and the laws of logic. A statement is synthetically true just in
&gt; case its truth is not grounded exclusively on the meaning of its terms
&gt; and on the laws of logic.

&gt; 3. The a priori/a posteriori distinction concerns the epistemic status
&gt; of a statement. To say that a statement is true a priori is to say that
&gt; its truth can be known without appeal to experience. A statement is
&gt; true a posteriori just in case its truth can only be known by relying
&gt; on experience.

&gt; Having noted the differences between these three distinctions, consider
&gt; their similarities. The most striking observation about these three
&gt; distinctions is that they seem to divide up the set of statements into
&gt; exactly the same subclasses. That is, we can use each one of the three
&gt; distinctions to divide the set of statements into two classes: the one
&gt; consists of necessary, analytic, and a priori statements; the other
&gt; contains contingent, synthetic, and a posteriori statements. But this
&gt; neat division of statements into two groups is not universally
&gt; accepted. The most notable dissenters have been Immanuel Kant and, in
&gt; our times, Saul Kripke. Kant argued that some statements are necessary,
&gt; synthetic and a priori; for example, &quot;Every event has a cause.&quot; Ever
&gt; since, &quot;the problem of the synthetic a priori&quot; has occupied a fairly
&gt; central position on the philosophical stage. Recently, Kripke argued
&gt; that some statements are necessary, synthetic, and a posteriori. &quot;Water
&gt; is H2O,&quot; &quot;Heat is mean molecular energy,&quot; and other such theoretical
&gt; identifications are examples of such a posteriori necessities.

Well, It was some time since I read Sherlock Holmes. but as kid, I
remember how his analytic logic stunned me. I couldn't understand how
he did dose things. Now, I think I can help the debaters, understand
what Holmes presumed to do, and what was his, as I find out, his
mistakes in logic. mistakes that in the book, could lead Holmes to the
solution, but in realty could not lead so safely to the solution.

I think that even professional philosophers avoid seeing the problems
that are present in Holmes logic. The problem, as I put it to your
judgment, as as follow.
Holmes uses Deduction to analyze relations between causes and effects.
He can go with deduction from a "From a drop of water," to the full
look or understanding of the "Atlantic or a Niagara without having
seen or heard of one or the other". But what Holmes forget (and a lot
of other good philosophers also forget) is that to properly do so, one
has to know all about water, or to know "the thing for itself".
But our only source of earthly knowledge about "the thing for
itself" is received from induction. In induction we means to find
connections between phenomenas. As Hume has shown, induction is not a
reliable source of information. Finding causes, which is part of the
process Holmes is dealing with, is even less reliable then induction,
because it is a mixture of  process of induction-deduction, that is not
yet sufficiently understood.

Deductions are built on inductions, and because induction is not
reliable source of knowledge, the deductions  are also not reliable.
For instance, when we find by induction that in a temperature of -
50C our hand can get a nasty frostbite, we deduce that in -180C, we
will get a very strong frostbite, and even loose our hand. But when by
experience, we pour on our hand liquid Nitrogen (in tempreture of
-180C), we see that nothing happens. In fact, scientist always try to
find inductions (lows, regularities, etc.), and to deduce from them new
behiviours of nature, and they are used to find that their deduction
were wrong.

The mistake of Holmes, come I think from geometry. When we deduce in
geometry, we know all about the properties of rectangles, strait lines
etc. (we defined them with all their properties, and so we know "the
thing in itself"), and so we can, if we are good geometrician, deduce
to infinity without a mistake. But in objects of realty we lack the
knowledge of "the thing in itself".
Geometry had inspired many philosophers to think that in realty we can
also deduce reliably. Hobbes had noted it in his papers. I think that
analytic philosophers also were inspired by mathematic.

So, to some it up. Deductions in realty are based on inductions, which
is a very problematic source of knowledge, on "the thing for
itself".

&gt; [T]he &quot;deductions&quot; of Sherlock Holmes: I have ... been interested in

I think that says it all. To "deduce", and never mind if it is a de-, an ab-
or an induction - is used as a shorthand for the verbal phrase "arriving at
a conclusion by the use of logic"; or, IOW, as the verb to the noun "logic".
It is more of a metonymy - a pars pro toto - than an attempt to specify any
particular logical form. Tropical language - hard to avoid.

@ Yes, a fish in a coral reef might jump at shadows - but then it could jump
into the path of a fish it didn't see.  A fish might be too busy feeding to
notice a predator; too late then.  A South American animal which sees
another die from eating a colour frog, may avoid doing the same - based on
that one "generalisation"; if might also avoid eating any bright-coloured
frog.

@ I use trial-and-error in sense that some animals might find eating

The Scientific Method uses a process of - Aim, Data, Hypothesis, Method,
Conclusion, Verfication/Falsification - which is similar to what animals use
in trial-and-error.  It is the Hypothesis part which is constantly revised,
and process repeated, until we get it right.

@ So, Holmes uses the Scientific Method, but in -
(1)  a Time Frame of present-to-past.  When we normally use it, it is in a
present-to-future situation, which is much easier.
(2) In both cases, (trial-and-error, and Sci-Meth) it might result in a
generalisation via Induction; certainly inference is involved.
(3) Syllogistically, we may claim that Induction is a reverse of the normal
syllogism - we have a Conclusion and go back to find a Major Premise.
(4) The Logic involved is based on the Scientific Method, rather than the
Logic of the Schoolmen.
(5) Internal validity is necessary in all cases, but also soundness
(reference to empirical fact).  Of the two, fact is more important.

#  Holmes had a vast knowledge of things relevant to his field of operation,
and these are summed up by Dr.Watson in Chapter 2 of "A Study in Scarlet".
Holmes was an observer of minutiae, and of human thought processes.  He
constantly astounded those present by coming out with a comment, the
conclusion of a chain of reasoning - whose "miraculous" nature disappeared
on explanation.
Of course, he could be wrong, but he berated Watson on occasion for
being - too timid in your inferences.  True, to deduce the character of a
man from examination of his watch might lead to wrong assessment, because an
effect may have one or more causes.  When there is only one possible cause,
then Holmes was on safer ground - a red clay which only existed in a
locally-excavated site.
Any generalisation is only as valid as the range of data it covers; "all
swans are white" needs modification when black swans are discovered.
The curious incident of the dog in the night-time.  "But the dog did
nothing in the night-time."  "That was the curious incident" - because the
dog didn't bark, thus must have know the person present.
While it may not be possible to infer the complete skeleton of a dinosaur
from a single tooth, it is remarkable what can be inferred, and this
increases as more bones are unearthed.  Same with Holmes; the more clues the
better - until they all come together and point to one inevitable
conclusion, as in the Six Napoleons.

&gt; &gt; &gt;    Sherlock Holmes uses a similar technique. He observes the crime

&gt; &gt; &gt; gathers data, and makes hypotheses accordingly.  He works &quot;backwards&quot;
&gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; events to possible causes, and these can be one, few, or many.  When
&gt; people
&gt; &gt; &gt; are involved, then motive, means, and opportunity, must be taken into

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Induction is the gathering of data, to hopefully arrive at
&gt; &gt; &gt; generalisations.
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Deduction, usually, is using generalisations to infer conclusions re
&gt; &gt; &gt; particular cases.

&gt; &gt; &gt;    Detective deduction can be regarded as the reverse of the
&gt; conventional
&gt; &gt; &gt; syllogism - you are given the conclusion, and maybe (part of) the minor
&gt; &gt; &gt; premise, and must get back to the major premise - in the form of &quot;Only
&gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; person could have committed the crime.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Detective deduction is just induction. The history of the usage of the
&gt; &gt; term deduction might clear this up. I believe Holmes meant &quot;inference&quot;
&gt; &gt; when he used the term deduction, or he meant &quot;the logic of it.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt;    &quot;Rationalisation&quot; is similar, but based on desire.  I desire to live
&gt; &gt; &gt; forever, hence I'll believe anything which contributes to this.  Hence,

&gt; &gt; &gt; exists, and is merciful; thus I shall go to Heaven when I die.
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Of all forms of logic, this last is most common.

&gt; @ So, Holmes uses the Scientific Method, but in -
&gt; (1)  a Time Frame of present-to-past.  When we normally use it, it is in a
&gt; present-to-future situation, which is much easier.

Present to past or past to future, whats the difference, they can both
be inductive. A scientist doing geological work is more like your
present to past idea. It seems your describing varioous ways to be
inductive.

Deduction =  system of logic, inference and conclusion drawn from
examination of facts. Conclusions drawn from the general down to the
specific.
Induction = of reasoning; proceeding from particular facts to a general
conclusion

What Sherlock Holmes did was to look at particular facts such as mud
stains and train tickets and induct or induce general conclusions about
the state of affairs. Sometimes his inferences were both inductive and
deductive.

It was Conan-Doyle that made the mistake of calling such behaviour
deduction, and is not generally accepted or understood.
"Common usage" is not wrong just the way way it appears in Sherlock H.
stories.

&gt; only reflects how the word has been commonly used--not only by ordinary
&gt; people, but also by educated people. To most people, any kind of
&gt; inference is a &quot;deduction.&quot;

&gt; I don't see that it helps to say that the common usage is &quot;wrong&quot; and
&gt; that the technical usage is &quot;right.&quot; I would think that if one is
&gt; knowledgeable on a certain subject and wants to convey that information
&gt; to others, it would be best to point out that within that subject
&gt; matter the use of a word differs from common usage.

&gt; If I tell someone that I have &quot;deduced&quot; something, they think they know
&gt; what I mean. If I talk to someone about &quot;induction,&quot; I have lost them.
&gt; They think they know what I mean if I talk about &quot;learning from
&gt; experience.&quot; As with so many difficult words, one problem with
&gt; &quot;induction&quot; is that the word has been used in so many different ways.
&gt; &quot;Induction&quot; might mean:

&gt; * To elicit a theory.

&gt; * To verify a theory.

&gt; * To elicit a higher principle.

&gt; * To elicit an ordinary fact.

&gt; Supposedly the purpose of induction is to establish &quot;first principles.&quot;
&gt; Yet the process by which an ordinary person establishes everyday
&gt; &quot;facts&quot; (e.g., the attributes of objects) falls right in line with
&gt; descriptions of &quot;induction.&quot; It appears to me that induction in this
&gt; common form (or &quot;epagoge,&quot; or whatever it ought to be called) does not
&gt; have to be an &quot;act of reasoning&quot;; at times it can be an automatic
&gt; process--a brain process that during the course of observation produces
&gt; &quot;intuitions&quot; for me without any effort on my part.

&gt; The kind of inference that Sherlock Holmes frequently used can be
&gt; typified in a statement that politicians are fond off &quot;If it walks like
&gt; a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.&quot; In other words, &quot;If it has
&gt; an attribute distinctive to that kind of thing, it is that thing.&quot;
&gt; Apparently we can take this a step further: &quot;If it is that thing, then
&gt; it will have all of the other attributes of that thing.&quot; If it quacks,
&gt; it can swim. If it's Jack's voice on the phone, then it's that rascal
&gt; Jack at the other end of the line.

&gt; What is assumed in such cases is that the object has certain attributes
&gt; and that some of these attributes are distinctive to the object. What
&gt; we could use is a simple, non-convoluted description of this kind of
&gt; inference. Apparently some of C.S. Peirce's work pertains to the
&gt; matter.

&gt; Far from being only a matter of literary interest, the stories and
&gt; novels of the Sherlock Holmes series have been studied and commented by
&gt; scholars from the most varied scientific disciplines: criminology,
&gt; logic, epistemology, economics, psychology, and sociology.

&gt; The area of logic and epistemology has without doubt been focused on
&gt; the most. Holmes' investigative method - a fine example of Late
&gt; Nineteenth Century positivism - has been analysed and debated by
&gt; illustrious scholars and academics. The prevailing conclusion, which
&gt; contradicts the use of deductive logic on several occasions declared by
&gt; Holmes himself within the stories and most completely formulated in the
&gt; article The Book of Life, is that his way of proceeding corresponds
&gt; with a hybrid methodology. The investigative path sees a continuous
&gt; interaction and overlapping of induction and deduction, of theoretical
&gt; hypotheses and empirical evidence. In strictly epistemological terms,
&gt; &quot;abduction&quot; is perhaps the word which best describes Holmes'
&gt; proceeding. The term was originally formulated by Aristotle, while its
&gt; revival in modern logic is largely owed to Charles Peirce. Abduction
&gt; can be defined as a syllogism in which the second premise has only the
&gt; character of probability. Even if for other aspects similar to the
&gt; deductive process, the differences are considerable, starting with the
&gt; less certain character of the conclusion which can be reached, that can
&gt; never be superior to that of the second premise. In the literary field
&gt; we come across at least one other character - not an investigator
&gt; this time - who often resorts to this kind of reasoning: Voltaire's
&gt; Zadig. The scholars' opinions on the exact classification of
&gt; Holmes' method vary considerably, but abduction seems to receive the
&gt; largest support. The only commonly accepted point seems to be the fact
&gt; that it is definitely not a deductive process. The concept of
&gt; induction, the process which from the gathering of empirical
&gt; information comes to the formulation of a theoretical conclusion (law,
&gt; empirical generalisation), describes the followed path much better. The
&gt; deductive process is actually contradicted and condemned, with various
&gt; formulations, by Holmes himself in several stories: &quot;It is a capital
&gt; mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the
&gt; judgment (STUD)&quot;; &quot;It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has
&gt; data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of
&gt; theories to suit facts (SCAN)&quot;; &quot;Data! data! data! I can't make bricks
&gt; without clay (COPP)&quot;; &quot;It is a capital mistake to theorize in advance
&gt; of the facts (SECO)&quot;; &quot;The temptation to form premature theories upon
&gt; insufficient data is the bane of our profession (VALL)&quot;.

&gt; The epistemological expressions so frequent in Holmes' stories -
&gt; theory, hypothesis, deduction, verification, inference - are
&gt; therefore often used somewhat loosely. However, the occasional improper
&gt; use of the term &quot;deduction&quot; by someone who is not an expert in logic or
&gt; social sciences, even for someone as precise and methodical as Holmes,
&gt; can easily be justified. In everyday language the term is often used in
&gt; a rather approximate sense, describing any analytical process based on
&gt; logical concatenations. However, the fact remains that Holmes does
&gt; actually not adopt the sociological perspective of grounded theory -
&gt; the construction of a theory on the sole basis of the empirical facts
&gt; available, without a precise starting hypothesis - which on several
&gt; occasions he declares to apply. Holmes' actions are almost always
&gt; inspired by a precise working hypothesis, based on the few facts which
&gt; are initially available to him and on his previous experiences with
&gt; similar cases and perfected as the analysis of the available empirical
&gt; elements proceeds. The initial hypothesis has been proved wrong on
&gt; several occasions: even if the investigator professes many times to
&gt; have identified the solution to a mystery or the right trail as soon as
&gt; the person who submitted the case entered the Baker Street room or
&gt; finished his account of the situation, Holmes' investigations are
&gt; anything but free of false trails and blunders. The myth of the
&gt; infallible detective is just that - a myth. Irene Adler docet. Even
&gt; if he is considered to be the paradigmatic example of rational and
&gt; scientific investigation, Holmes is further not at all dogmatic in his
&gt; positivism, such as when he states that &quot;imagination is often the
&gt; mother of truth (VALL)&quot; or that &quot;the impression of a woman may be more
&gt; valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner (TWIS)&quot;. In
&gt; actual fact, in the solving of various cases elements such as
&gt; imagination or intuition proved much more important and useful to
&gt; Holmes than the detective would like to admit. It is for this reason,
&gt; and because the end result of the process is considered more important
&gt; than the method used to reach it, that various scholars consider him to
&gt; be a forerunner of Paul Feyerabend's methodological anarchism.

&gt; Holmes' investigations are largely regarded and of absolute interest
&gt; also as examples of the recourse to the technique of observation,
&gt; frequently used in disciplines such as anthropology, sociology and
&gt; social psychology, as well as in clinical diagnosis. In most cases it
&gt; is a naturalistic, non invasive kind of observation, even if the person
&gt; being observed is usually aware of the profession of the observer. In
&gt; other occasions it is a participant kind of observation, where the
&gt; observer interacts actively and in a position of anonymity with the
&gt; other components of a particular group. Holmes' skill in disguise and
&gt; the knowledge of usages and customs of a wide range of social classes
&gt; explains his extreme ease in entering and passing unobserved in most
&gt; various contexts. He could, for example, wander around the worst areas
&gt; of London or mix up with the domestic staff of people involved in his
&gt; investigations without arousing the slightest suspicion. If Holmes'
&gt; ability to follow trails and examine material objects is extraordinary,
&gt; his most stimulating and surprising deductions are without doubt those
&gt; regarding people. On the basis of the observation of their physical
&gt; characteristics and dressing Holmes could deduce, with nearly absolute
&gt; precision, an amazing number of attributes: social class, profession,
&gt; civil status, present and previous illnesses, sight problems and much
&gt; more. He could also understand and predict their behaviour in

I can accept that upon first blush but are you not sure that he meant
"to deduce" (4 below) as opposed to "deduction" (5 below)? This is
interesting, trying to untangle different uses in different times with
a subject dating thousands of years in name.

de·duc·tion / Pronunciation Key - Show Spelled
Pronunciation[di-duhk-shuhn] Pronunciation Key - Show IPA Pronunciation

-noun 1. the act or process of deducting; subtraction.

2. something that is or may be deducted: She took deductions for a home
office and other business expenses from her taxes.

3. the act or process of deducing.

4. something that is deduced: His astute deduction was worthy of
Sherlock Holmes.

5. Logic. a. a process of reasoning in which a conclusion follows
necessarily from the premises presented, so that the conclusion cannot
be false if the premises are true. b. a conclusion reached by this
process. Compare induction (def. 4).

&gt; the state of affairs. Sometimes his inferences were both inductive and
&gt; deductive.

&gt; It was Conan-Doyle that made the mistake of calling such behaviour
&gt; deduction, and is not generally accepted or understood.
&gt; &quot;Common usage&quot; is not wrong just the way way it appears in Sherlock H.
&gt; stories.

&gt; &gt; only reflects how the word has been commonly used--not only by ordinary
&gt; &gt; people, but also by educated people. To most people, any kind of

&gt; &gt; I don't see that it helps to say that the common usage is &quot;wrong&quot; and
&gt; &gt; that the technical usage is &quot;right.&quot; I would think that if one is
&gt; &gt; knowledgeable on a certain subject and wants to convey that information
&gt; &gt; to others, it would be best to point out that within that subject
&gt; &gt; matter the use of a word differs from common usage.

&gt; &gt; If I tell someone that I have &quot;deduced&quot; something, they think they know
&gt; &gt; what I mean. If I talk to someone about &quot;induction,&quot; I have lost them.
&gt; &gt; They think they know what I mean if I talk about &quot;learning from
&gt; &gt; experience.&quot; As with so many difficult words, one problem with
&gt; &gt; &quot;induction&quot; is that the word has been used in so many different ways.
&gt; &gt; &quot;Induction&quot; might mean:

&gt; &gt; * To elicit a theory.

&gt; &gt; * To verify a theory.

&gt; &gt; * To elicit a higher principle.

&gt; &gt; * To elicit an ordinary fact.

&gt; &gt; Supposedly the purpose of induction is to establish &quot;first principles.&quot;
&gt; &gt; Yet the process by which an ordinary person establishes everyday
&gt; &gt; &quot;facts&quot; (e.g., the attributes of objects) falls right in line with
&gt; &gt; descriptions of &quot;induction.&quot; It appears to me that induction in this
&gt; &gt; common form (or &quot;epagoge,&quot; or whatever it ought to be called) does not
&gt; &gt; have to be an &quot;act of reasoning&quot;; at times it can be an automatic
&gt; &gt; process--a brain process that during the course of observation produces
&gt; &gt; &quot;intuitions&quot; for me without any effort on my part.

&gt; &gt; The kind of inference that Sherlock Holmes frequently used can be
&gt; &gt; typified in a statement that politicians are fond off &quot;If it walks like
&gt; &gt; a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.&quot; In other words, &quot;If it has
&gt; &gt; an attribute distinctive to that kind of thing, it is that thing.&quot;
&gt; &gt; Apparently we can take this a step further: &quot;If it is that thing, then
&gt; &gt; it will have all of the other attributes of that thing.&quot; If it quacks,
&gt; &gt; it can swim. If it's Jack's voice on the phone, then it's that rascal
&gt; &gt; Jack at the other end of the line.

&gt; &gt; What is assumed in such cases is that the object has certain attributes
&gt; &gt; and that some of these attributes are distinctive to the object. What
&gt; &gt; we could use is a simple, non-convoluted description of this kind of
&gt; &gt; inference. Apparently some of C.S. Peirce's work pertains to the

&gt; &gt; Far from being only a matter of literary interest, the stories and
&gt; &gt; novels of the Sherlock Holmes series have been studied and commented by
&gt; &gt; scholars from the most varied scientific disciplines: criminology,
&gt; &gt; logic, epistemology, economics, psychology, and sociology.

&gt; &gt; The area of logic and epistemology has without doubt been focused on
&gt; &gt; the most. Holmes' investigative method - a fine example of Late
&gt; &gt; Nineteenth Century positivism - has been analysed and debated by
&gt; &gt; illustrious scholars and academics. The prevailing conclusion, which
&gt; &gt; contradicts the use of deductive logic on several occasions declared by
&gt; &gt; Holmes himself within the stories and most completely formulated in the
&gt; &gt; article The Book of Life, is that his way of proceeding corresponds
&gt; &gt; with a hybrid methodology. The investigative path sees a continuous
&gt; &gt; interaction and overlapping of induction and deduction, of theoretical
&gt; &gt; hypotheses and empirical evidence. In strictly epistemological terms,
&gt; &gt; &quot;abduction&quot; is perhaps the word which best describes Holmes'
&gt; &gt; proceeding. The term was originally formulated by Aristotle, while its
&gt; &gt; revival in modern logic is largely owed to Charles Peirce. Abduction
&gt; &gt; can be defined as a syllogism in which the second premise has only the
&gt; &gt; character of probability. Even if for other aspects similar to the
&gt; &gt; deductive process, the differences are considerable, starting with the
&gt; &gt; less certain character of the conclusion which can be reached, that can
&gt; &gt; never be superior to that of the second premise. In the literary field
&gt; &gt; we come across at least one other character - not an investigator
&gt; &gt; this time - who often resorts to this kind of reasoning: Voltaire's
&gt; &gt; Zadig. The scholars' opinions on the exact classification of
&gt; &gt; Holmes' method vary considerably, but abduction seems to receive the
&gt; &gt; largest support. The only commonly accepted point seems to be the fact
&gt; &gt; that it is definitely not a deductive process. The concept of
&gt; &gt; induction, the process which from the gathering of empirical
&gt; &gt; information comes to the formulation of a theoretical conclusion (law,
&gt; &gt; empirical generalisation), describes the followed path much better. The
&gt; &gt; deductive process is actually contradicted and condemned, with various
&gt; &gt; formulations, by Holmes himself in several stories: &quot;It is a capital
&gt; &gt; mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the
&gt; &gt; judgment (STUD)&quot;; &quot;It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has
&gt; &gt; data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of
&gt; &gt; theories to suit facts (SCAN)&quot;; &quot;Data! data! data! I can't make bricks
&gt; &gt; without clay (COPP)&quot;; &quot;It is a capital mistake to theorize in advance
&gt; &gt; of the facts (SECO)&quot;; &quot;The temptation to form premature theories upon
&gt; &gt; insufficient data is the bane of our profession (VALL)&quot;.

&gt; &gt; The epistemological expressions so frequent in Holmes' stories -
&gt; &gt; theory, hypothesis, deduction, verification, inference - are
&gt; &gt; therefore often used somewhat loosely. However, the occasional improper
&gt; &gt; use of the term &quot;deduction&quot; by someone who is not an expert in logic or
&gt; &gt; social sciences, even for someone as precise and methodical as Holmes,
&gt; &gt; can easily be justified. In everyday language the term is often used in
&gt; &gt; a rather approximate sense, describing any analytical process based on
&gt; &gt; logical concatenations. However, the fact remains that Holmes does
&gt; &gt; actually not adopt the sociological perspective of grounded theory -
&gt; &gt; the construction of a theory on the sole basis of the empirical facts
&gt; &gt; available, without a precise starting hypothesis - which on several
&gt; &gt; occasions he declares to apply. Holmes' actions are almost always
&gt; &gt; inspired by a precise working hypothesis, based on the few facts which
&gt; &gt; are initially available to him and on his previous experiences with
&gt; &gt; similar cases and perfected as the analysis of the available empirical
&gt; &gt; elements proceeds. The initial hypothesis has been proved wrong on
&gt; &gt; several occasions: even if the investigator professes many times to
&gt; &gt; have identified the solution to a mystery or the right trail as soon as
&gt; &gt; the person who submitted the case entered the Baker Street room or
&gt; &gt; finished his account of the situation, Holmes' investigations are
&gt; &gt; anything but free of false trails and blunders. The myth of the
&gt; &gt; infallible detective is just that - a myth. Irene Adler docet. Even
&gt; &gt; if he is considered to be the paradigmatic example of rational and
&gt; &gt; scientific investigation, Holmes is further not at all dogmatic in his
&gt; &gt; positivism, such as when he states that &quot;imagination is often the
&gt; &gt; mother of truth (VALL)&quot; or that &quot;the impression of a woman may be more
&gt; &gt; valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner (TWIS)&quot;. In
&gt; &gt; actual fact, in the solving of various cases elements such as
&gt; &gt; imagination or intuition proved much more important and useful to
&gt; &gt; Holmes than the detective would like to admit. It is for this reason,
&gt; &gt; and because the end result of the process is considered more important
&gt; &gt; than the method used to reach it, that various scholars consider him to
&gt; &gt; be a forerunner of Paul Feyerabend's methodological anarchism.

&gt; &gt; Holmes' investigations are largely regarded and of absolute interest
&gt; &gt; also as examples of the recourse to the technique of observation,
&gt; &gt; frequently used in disciplines such as anthropology, sociology and
&gt; &gt; social psychology, as well as in clinical diagnosis. In most cases it
&gt; &gt; is a naturalistic, non invasive kind of observation, even if the person
&gt; &gt; being observed is usually aware of the profession of the observer. In
&gt; &gt; other occasions it is a participant kind of observation, where the
&gt; &gt; observer interacts actively and in a position of anonymity with the
&gt; &gt; other components of a particular group. Holmes' skill in disguise and
&gt; &gt; the knowledge of usages and customs of a wide range of social classes
&gt; &gt; explains his extreme ease in entering and passing unobserved in most
&gt; &gt; various contexts. He could, for example, wander around the worst areas
&gt; &gt; of London or mix up with the domestic staff of people involved in his
&gt; &gt; investigations without arousing the slightest suspicion. If Holmes'
&gt; &gt; ability to follow trails and examine material objects is

&gt; I think induction can be confusing because a conclusion can be strong deduction as well as correct induction. Here is an argument that is both deductivly and inductively adequate:

All man are mortal.
Aristotel is a man.
* Aristotel is mortal.

Note that I use * to mark "therefore" or indicate conclusion.

Argument above is both, deductively strong and inductively strong. It's
premises entail it's conclusion.

Here is another argument.

Most gorillas are vegetarian.
Marvin is gorilla.
* Marvin is vegetarian.

Not clearly deductively correct. (Marvin may be carnivore though very
unlikely). But still, argument is just as clearly a very strong
inductive argument.

So how do we distinguesh ?

Both deductive and inductive methods rely on argument. Both are

# "All men are mortal" (where men includes women)
This is based on the observation that humans tend to die, sooner or
later, with no exceptions - as yet.
[ Though the prophet Elijah (?) rode up to heaven on a fiery chariot,
according to the Bible. ]
The Categorical Syllogism deals with such cases (as distinct from the
Hypothetical, Alternative, and Disjunctive).  We take one case of "men", and
inevitably the attribute "mortal" is attached.
But Induction precedes Deduction, and Observation of our Natural World
precedes Induction.  It is only when observations of like cases show
sufficient consistency that inductive generalisation is possible.
(Though if you touch a hot stove, one case might be sufficient to cancel
further experimentation.)
We can have "all", or "most" or "some" or "a few" - even "none".  But
nothing is certain, which is where science has the advantage over religion,
where absolutes prevail - until a total upheaval occurs, with a schism, or
heresy, and a new orthodoxy is born.

The following might help to unravel some of the misunderstandings
evidenced in this thread.

Go to: http://www.logicbook.net

Click on the picture of the book's cover.

You get to the publisher's page where you can Google search "An
Introduction to Formal Logic"

Search for e.g. "evaluation" and you will be taken to page 1 of the
book, and you can read through the first 11 pages. Search next for
"scientific" and you can go on a page -- which should be enough to help
explain the ideas of deduction and induction.

That's right. Observations have to be consistent and when they are they
verify that proposition is true as opposed to being false).

Another way in looking at inductive and deductive argument is to
recognise that induction goes from general to specific while deduction
goes from specific to general. Af course, I would take this to be
indicative not a rule. There are instances when rule is broken.

Aristotle was first philosopher that discovered pretty much everything
there is about logic. He is what we call father of logic in same sense
Freud was father of analysis. But since science of Logic grew and
refined it self so both fathers tend to be more of history...
Categorical syllogism is term he used to explain the process. Argument
in his case (and no so far of of current classical logic) consist from
premises and inferred conclusion.

I take it that's a typo. It would be more accurate to say that a

more specific premisses, while inductive inferences leap from a bunch

:-) It has been said that  but it's misleading. Some inductively strong
arguments have general premiss and particular conclusion. For example:
'All emeralds previously found have been green, therefore the next
emerald found will be green' And some deductively correct arguments
proceed from particular premiss to general conclusion. For example: The
emerald number one is green, the emerald number two is green, the
emerald number three is green; therefore, all emeralds numbered from
one to three are green' There is no correlation between the nature of
the argument (deductive or inductive) and the nature of statements that
comprise argument (general or specific)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Common usage&quot; is not wrong just the way way it appears in Sherlock H.
&gt; &gt; &gt; stories.

&gt; &gt; I can accept that upon first blush but are you not sure that he meant
&gt; &gt; &quot;to deduce&quot; (4 below) as opposed to &quot;deduction&quot; (5 below)?

&gt; There is nothing to it at all. &quot;to deduce&quot; is merely the infinitive

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The kind of inference that Sherlock Holmes frequently used can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; typified in a statement that politicians are fond off &quot;If it walks like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.&quot; In other words, &quot;If it has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an attribute distinctive to that kind of thing, it is that thing.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Apparently we can take this a step further: &quot;If it is that thing, then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it will have all of the other attributes of that thing.&quot; If it quacks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it can swim. If it's Jack's voice on the phone, then it's that rascal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jack at the other end of the line.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is assumed in such cases is that the object has certain attributes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and that some of these attributes are distinctive to the object. What
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we could use is a simple, non-convoluted description of this kind of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inference. Apparently some of C.S. Peirce's work pertains to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matter.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Far from being only a matter of literary interest, the stories and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; novels of the Sherlock Holmes series have been studied and commented by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scholars from the most varied scientific disciplines: criminology,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; logic, epistemology, economics, psychology, and sociology.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The area of logic and epistemology has without doubt been focused on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the most. Holmes' investigative method - a fine example of Late
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nineteenth Century positivism - has been analysed and debated by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illustrious scholars and academics. The prevailing conclusion, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contradicts the use of deductive logic on several occasions declared by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Holmes himself within the stories and most completely formulated in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; article The Book of Life, is that his way of proceeding corresponds
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a hybrid methodology. The investigative path sees a continuous
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interaction and overlapping of induction and deduction, of theoretical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hypotheses and empirical evidence. In strictly epistemological terms,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;abduction&quot; is perhaps the word which best describes Holmes'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; proceeding. The term was originally formulated by Aristotle, while its
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; revival in modern logic is largely owed to Charles Peirce. Abduction
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can be defined as a syllogism in which the second premise has only the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; character of probability. Even if for other aspects similar to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deductive process, the differences are considerable, starting with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; less certain character of the conclusion which can be reached, that can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never be superior to that of the second premise. In the literary field
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we come across at least one other character - not an investigator
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this time - who often resorts to this kind of reasoning: Voltaire's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Zadig. The scholars' opinions on the exact classification of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Holmes' method vary considerably, but abduction seems to receive the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; largest support. The only commonly accepted point seems to be the fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it is definitely not a deductive process. The concept of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; induction, the process which from the gathering of empirical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information comes to the formulation of a theoretical conclusion (law,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; empirical generalisation), describes the followed path much better. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deductive process is actually contradicted and condemned, with various
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; formulations, by Holmes himself in several stories: &quot;It is a capital
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; judgment (STUD)&quot;; &quot;It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theories to suit facts (SCAN)&quot;; &quot;Data! data! data! I can't make bricks
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without clay (COPP)&quot;; &quot;It is a capital mistake to theorize in advance

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theory, hypothesis, deduction, verification, inference - are

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use of the term &quot;deduction&quot; by someone who is not an expert in logic or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; social sciences, even for someone as precise and methodical as Holmes,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can easily be justified. In everyday language the term is often used in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a rather approximate sense, describing any analytical process based on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; logical concatenations. However, the fact remains that Holmes does
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually not adopt the sociological perspective of grounded theory -
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the construction of a theory on the sole basis of the empirical facts
