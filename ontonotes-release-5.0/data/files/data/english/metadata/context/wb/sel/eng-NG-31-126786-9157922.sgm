1.1 23 die in underground fire

News24, 7 October 2007

An underground fire has claimed the lives of 23 miners illegally working an unused shaft of the St Helena Mine, in Welkom, Free State police said on Sunday.

Their bodies were discovered on Sunday morning and brought to the surface by colleagues arrested when the fire forced them to leave the mine on Tuesday, said Superintendent Motantsi Makhele.

He said 120 illegal miners were arrested when they made their way out of the mine on Tuesday. They had since appeared in court and a charge of trespassing.

A group of them returned to the mine on Sunday to look for colleagues who were still missing.

They brought eight bodies to the surface at 11:30. Another 15 bodies were later recovered. All had been taken to the state mortuary in Welkom.

Makhele said Welkom detectives had opened inquest dockets.

&quot;Some of these bodies can still be identified, while others were already beyond recognition due to the period they spent underground,&quot; he said

&quot;Post-mortems will be conducted on them, as well as some forensic tests on those which can't be identified.&quot;

Provincial Commissioner Amon Mashigo said that, as illegal miners, they had no records and were possibly from neighbouring countries including Lesotho and Mozambique.

1.2 Minister laments deaths of illegal miners

SABC, 8 October 2007

Minerals and Energy Minister Buyelwa Sonjica has described the deaths of 23 illegal miners at a disused shaft of St Helena Mine in Welkom as regrettable. However, she has condemned illegal mining, saying it undermines the mining regulatory framework and affects the image of mining in South Africa.

Free State police spokesperson Motantsi Makhele says they have opened inquest dockets. Makhele says the bodies will be available for identification at a local mortuary from tomorrow. Meanwhile, police commissioner Amon Mashigo says the illegal miners had no records and were possibly from neighbouring countries including Lesotho and Mozambique.

The miners are believed to be victims of a fire that broke out in the unused shaft last month. More than a 100 people were arrested and charged with trespassing after the blaze.

It is alleged that they were illegal miners and went underground to search for their colleagues. Most of the bodies were burnt beyond recognition.

1.3 Minister slams illegal mining

News24, 8 October 2007

An underground fire has claimed the lives of 23 miners illegally working a disused shaft of the St Helena Mine, in Welkom, on the Free State Goldfields, police said on Sunday.

A number of illegal miners, known as &quot;zama-zamas&quot; were feared to have suffocated or burned to death while trapped underground by the fire - which they were thought to have started last month.

Rescue teams were not immediately able to reach the source of the fire and several shafts were sealed to smother the flames, the Volksblad newspaper reported at the time.

Two groups of miners refused to surface, despite negotiations with Harmony Gold.
Miners were arrested

It was thought the miners had fled eastwards from the fire to the working President Brand, President Steyn and Bambanani mines where they could get fresh air and a chance to make their way out.

Security at the mines was increased and 120 of the illegal miners were arrested when they surfaced last Monday, said Free State police spokesperson Superintendent Motantsi Makhele.

He said they had since appeared in court on a charge of trespassing.

Some of the miners returned to the mine on Sunday to look for the missing colleagues.

They brought eight bodies to the surface at 11:30. Another 15 bodies were later recovered. All had been taken to the state mortuary in Welkom.

Makhele said Welkom detectives had opened inquest dockets.

&quot;Some of these bodies can still be identified, while others were already beyond recognition due to the period they spent underground,&quot; he said.

&quot;Post-mortems will be conducted on them, as well as some forensic tests on those which can't be identified.&quot;

He said the bodies would be available for viewing at the mortuary from Tuesday.

Provincial Commissioner Amon Mashigo said the illegal miners had no records and were possibly from neighbouring countries including Lesotho and Mozambique.

Minister of Minerals and Energy Buyelwa Sonjica said the deaths were regrettable but condemned illegal mining.

&quot;Much as the minister regrets the loss of lives, she also condemns those who engage in illegal mining as it undermines the mining regulatory framework and affects the image of South African mining,&quot; wrote her spokesperson Bontle Mafuna in a statement.

1.4 Government shares blame for mine accident

SABC, 6 October 2007

Minerals and Energy Minister Buyelwa Sonjica says her department shares the blame for mine accidents, because it has shortage of staff to conduct regular inspections. Sonjica says a probe into the recent accident in Harmony Gold's Elandsrand mine outside Johannesburg is to begin on Monday.

She has ordered the Carletonville operation to be shut down for six weeks. On Thursday, the last of 3 200 miners trapped deep in the mine were rescued.

They were stuck for over 24 hours when a pipe broke off and hurtled down the shaft, severing an electricity cable to the mine's main lift. Sonjica says government is to hire private sector experts who will help to conduct the maintenance review in mines.

She says South Africa faces a lack of experts who can regularly inspect mines for safety. However, the minister has acknowledged that her department's inspections tend to be &quot;reactionary rather than proactive&quot;. The probe will be conducted by Harmony and officials from the minerals and energy department.

1.5 Mbeki tells Sonjica to investigate all mines

Charlotte Mathews, Resources Editor, Business Day, 8 October 2007

PRESIDENT Thabo Mbeki had asked Minerals and Energy Minister Buyelwa Sonjica to commission an audit into safety at all SA's mines after last week's accident at Harmony Gold Mining's Elandsrand mine, Sonjica said on Friday.

At a press conference during the fifth biennial Mine Health and Safety Council Summit, she said the department would amend the Mine Health and Safety Act of 1996 to lay down minimum standards of safety. The act had followed the outcomes-based model in place in other developed countries because it was impossible to lay down a single standard for an industry as diverse as mining, but it was possible to have minimum standards.

Sonjica highlighted the need for a minimum standard on maintenance of infrastructure, which she suggested had been one of the problems at Elandsrand.

She and council chairman Thabo Gazi also noted the lack of capacity within the council as a result of high staff turnover. The council needed engineers and doctors but it was constrained by the remuneration that could be offered in the public service, Gazi said. At his last check, the council was short of about 50 inspectors out of a staff complement of 330.

Gazi told the summit there had been no improvement in SA's fatality rates since 2004-05, yet the goal set out in the 2003 summit had been to reduce deaths by 20% a year to zero by 2013. In fact, there had been a regression of 5% in SA's fatality rates in the past few years. Injury rates had been stable, but 4000 people were still being injured in the industry every year. If the gold industry were to achieve its original goals, fatality rates would have to fall 30% a year instead of 20% , he said.

Sonjica said her main concerns were that there were still different interpretations of what constituted a risk assessment and these were sometimes done with pre-determined outcomes. For example, if costly control measures would be required, risk assessments were tailored to show this was unnecessary.

&quot;I don't believe we should be working on the premise that mining is risky,&quot; she said. &quot;It immediately brings laxity to our pursuit of mine safety. We should say we are making sure we reduce the risk in the process, not take a defeatist approach.&quot;

1.6 Mining safety audit short on skills

Justin Brown, Business Report, 8 October 2007

President Thabo Mbeki's call for all 700 local mines to have their safety checked could founder as the state's mine safety watchdog is facing chronic skills shortages and high turnover.

Thabo Gazi, department of minerals and energy chief inspector of mines, said on Friday that one in six of the positions in his agency, which has an annual budget of R153 million, were empty and that his staff, consisting of inspectors, doctors and engineers, were regularly being poached by the mining industry.

Buyelwa Sonjica, minister of minerals and energy, said at a mine health and safety summit that she was concerned about the shortage of skills in all safety disciplines. Mbeki had called to ask her to audit all mines, not only gold mines, she added. Failure to reduce the mine deaths and risks involved in mining was not an option, Sonjica said.

However, Gazi said the safety audit of mines would have to be &quot;prioritised&quot; given the department's limited resources.

Mbeki's call comes in the wake of the accident at Harmony Gold's Elandsrand gold mine near Carletonville, which trapped 3 200 workers underground.

Gazi was not able to say when the department had last done a safety audit of Elandsrand.

Harmony spokesperson Amelia Soares said the company welcomed the move to audit all local mines.

&quot;Harmony employs 54 000 people and last year, regrettably, 27 employees died in work-related incidents on our mines,&quot; she added.

The Harmony event followed one of the worst accidents in the mining industry this year: four people died at AngloGold Ashanti's Mponeng mine near Carletonville last month.

Sonjica said the accident reiterated her &quot;need for urgent action&quot;.

Steve Lenahan, an AngloGold Ashanti spokesperson, did not return calls for comment and Gold Fields spokesperson Nerina Bodasing was not available to comment.

At AngloGold's operations in South Africa, 23 people have died this year.

In the platinum sector, Ilse Meiring, media representative for Impala Platinum (Implats), said there was no one available at the company to comment on Mbeki's call.

Implats' safety has deteriorated from seven mine deaths in the year to June 2006 to 13 fatalities in the 12 months to June this year.

Simon Tebele, an Anglo Platinum spokesperson, said: &quot;We are not sure how this is going to pan out. Therefore we will wait until we are approached by the department.&quot;

Ralph Havenstein, Anglo Platinum's former chief executive, got the boot earlier this year after the group's Rustenberg mine had a significant deterioration in safety: 12 workers died in the first half of this year, compared with two in the same period last year.

Dorian Emmett, Anglo's head of sustainable development, said the group had &quot;no problem&quot; with a safety audit being done.

Last year 199 people died and 4 000 people were injured in South African mines.

1.7 Unfair working conditions fuel corruption: union

SABC, 6 October 2007

Joannesburg municipal workers have stressed that people should get equal wages for equal work to avoid corruption. The workers returned to work yesterday after the Labour Court ruled that they would not be allowed to call a secondary strike.

Members of the South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) went on strike for three days this week, demanding equal wages for equal work, transport and for employers to address issues regarding permanent contracts. They say corruption will persist because ther is no labour equality.

Samwu spokesperson Dumisani Langa says they have been negotiating the issues since 2002.

Samwu celebrates anniversary

Meanwhile, Samwu in Limpopo will today celebrate the 20th anniversary of its founding at the Makhado show ground in Louis Trichardt. Union members will also use the occasion to remember the late trade unionist, Josias Mogolle, who was killed by police in Polokwane during Samwu's national strike in 1995. The union has erected the statue of Mogolle in the city centre. Samwu says it is still fighting against privatisation with municipalities in the province.

1.8 Community service for teachers

Prega Govender, Sunday Times, 7 October 2007

Graduates to repay state bursaries with service at rural schools

Newly qualified teachers whose studies have been financed by the Education Department will be forced to teach at remote schools for up to four years.

This bold initiative by the department is an attempt to get teachers to schools most in need.

At least 4000 of the 10806 first-year students who registered for teaching degrees this year received a state bursary.

They will now be compelled to do between one and four years at designated schools, depending on the number of years of study the government pays for.

Education Minister Naledi Pandor confirmed to the Sunday Times that her department would, in consultation with provinces, assign state-funded teachers to &quot;the neediest of schools&quot;.

&quot;We have made funding available to ensure that as you graduate, we are able to post you to schools around the country. These are guaranteed positions for young people entering the profession.&quot;

Those who refuse postings chosen by the department, or give up teaching before completing the required number of years of service, will be compelled to repay their bursaries.

The Education Department has allocated R700-million over three years - including R120- million this year - for bursaries in an attempt to attract top students to teaching .

This more than doubled the enrolment of first-year students registering for teaching degrees this year.
Other proposals under discussion to alleviate heavy teacher workloads include:

ý Allocating a teaching support staffer, aged 18 to 25, to each of the 25145 schools countrywide. The matriculant would be paid between R51993 and R65864 and be expected to assist teachers with classroom administration;

ý Deploying an assistant teacher to every school to teach a specific learning area, for example, life sciences. The assistant teacher, aged between 21 and 30, would be a graduate with a three-year qualification and earn between R85937 and R112129; and

ý Allowing teacher interns, Bachelor of Education students in their fourth year of study, to get six months of practical experience in the classroom while earning between R85937 and R108863.

Pandor said she wanted to make teaching an attractive career prospect.

&quot;Young graduates tend to want to remain in teaching if you ensure that their experience is positive and that they receive remuneration that won't chase them away,&quot; she said.

Her department had not discarded a recommendation by a ministerial committee that fourth-year students be appointed at schools for the year and that they be paid.

&quot;We did not want to give young people the impression that we were locking them in. But we are looking at whether we want to have it [community service] as a system-wide programme. I think perhaps the new minister in 2009, whoever that is, would decide,&quot; she said.

Former dean of education at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in Port Elizabeth Professor Wally Morrow, who compiled the teacher-supply figures, said there was still a shortage of African foundation-phase teachers. &quot;Only 500 are expected to qualify by next year.&quot;

Morrow said while about 20000 teachers leave the system each year, only 7392 were expected to qualify next year.

Paul Colditz, chief executive of the Federation of Governing Bodies of SA Schools, said it would not support the curtailment of the rights of governing bodies to make recommendations on teacher appointments.

But teacher unions have welcomed the community service initiative, saying service-linked bursaries were an accepted practice internationally.

Don Pasquallie, deputy general-secretary of the South African Democratic Teachers' Union, said: &quot;It [community service] is not necessarily a bad thing. Why must children in rural areas get a second- or third-grade education? Regardless of where you live, you are entitled to the same quality of education that's delivered in urban areas.&quot;

But Pasquallie cautioned that linking bursaries to community service could backfire.

&quot; [Provincial education departments] are already struggling to attract teachers into the profession with the bursary scheme. If a prospective student knows he will have to teach in a remote area, there might be some resistance.&quot;

Basil Manuel, vice-president of the National Professional Teachers' Organisation of SA, said the initiative could ease the &quot;crisis&quot; of attracting suitably qualified teachers to teach the languages, maths, science and foundation-phase.

&quot;What we would like to know is the duration of the community service and whether teachers will have the option of choosing from a range of schools.&quot;

Professor Mary Metcalfe, head of the Wits School of Education, said teachers receiving bursaries could be sent to a school anywhere in the country where &quot;their skills are needed&quot;.

&quot;They are required to teach for the same number of years for which they were given the bursary.&quot;
Metcalfe, who is also the chairman of the education deans' forum, described it as a &quot;great intervention&quot;.

Professor Crain Soudien, director of the school of education at the University of Cape Town, said the bursaries had already made a difference in the enrolment figures of students studying teaching.

&quot;As a national principle, it's a very good one,&quot; he said.

2 Union matters

2.1 Guard reinstated - 7yrs later

News24, 5 October 2007

In a landmark ruling by the Constitutional Court on Friday, a security guard dismissed seven years ago by a platinum mine will be reinstated with full benefits.

The Constitutional Court overturned a ruling by the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) regarding &quot;Sidumo Z&quot;, who was dismissed for failing to fulfil his duties at Rustenburg Platinum Mines.

&quot;The majority accepted that there had been no evidence that loss had been suffered by the mine as a result of Sidumo's misconduct,&quot; Deputy Chief Justice, Dikgang Moseneke said.

In upholding the Labour Court and CCMA's (Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration) ruling, the court found the dismissal to have been unfair, but said Sidumo should have known that his failure to own-up to his conduct would count against him.

The court agreed that the ruling by the SCA be overturned, and reaffirmed the correctness of the Labour Court and the CCMA decisions.

It agreed with the Congress of SA trade Unions (Cosatu) that the CCMA commissioners did not have to respect decisions by the employer regarding dismissals, and should have the right to review cases presented to them on the basis of evidence presented at the primary disciplinary hearing.

&quot;We are satisfied with the ruling, because it gives the CCMA authority and avoids a situation of having to resolve little matters via courts,&quot; said Cosatu's general secretary, Zwelinzima Vavi.

2.2 Court reinstates guard after 7 years

IOL, 5 October 2007

A landmark Constitutional Court ruling has reinstated a security guard fired seven years ago at Rustenburg Platinum Mine with full benefits.

The court overturned a ruling by the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) regarding Zandise Sidumo, who was dismissed for failing to &quot;apply established search procedures&quot; at a facility where precious metals were separated and graded accordingly.

&quot;Even though he was not a member of the union, we are excited about this ruling. It's a victory not only for the mine industry but labour force generally,&quot; said the general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).

Following defeat at Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, Labour Court and Labour Appeal Court, the mine took the matter to the SCA.

The SCA ruled in favour of the Mine, saying the dismissal was fair and the CCMA should show respect to the employer's decision when considering dismissal cases as it was the employer's function to impose a sanction.

The Constitutional Court disagreed and ruled for Sidumo by upholding the CCMA and Labour Court's decision that he was unfairly dismissed.

They had contended that his service record of 15 years was in his favour, and that dismissal was too harsh a sanction.

There had been no losses suffered by the mine, the violation - not carrying out certain searches - had been unintentional or had been a mistake, and Sidumo had not been dishonest.

Commenting from his rural home town of Lusikisiki, Sidumo said the court maintained what he believed in all along - that he was right.

&quot;I'm waiting for my benefits and I'm ready to come back,&quot; he said.

Federation of Trade Unions in South Africa general secretary Dennis George commented, saying &quot;the previous ruling by the SCA would have left the CCMA toothless, and workers vulnerable against unfair dismissals&quot;.

The court reaffirmed the correctness of the Labour Courts and the CCMA decisions and said that the ruling by the SCA be overturned.

It agreed with the Congress of SA Trade Unions that the CCMA did not have to respect decisions by the employer regarding dismissals, and should have the full right to review cases presented to them on the basis of evidence presented at the primary disciplinary hearing.

&quot;The majority accepted that there had been no evidence that loss had been suffered by the mine as a result of Sidumo's misconduct,&quot; Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke said.

NUM's legal advisor Nica Rakau, said they still had to agree with the employer on terms of reinstatement and compensation.

&quot;It could take time but depends on the employer's legal team,&quot; he said. - Sapa

2.3 Blow for employers in dismissal ruling

Ernest Mabuza, Legal Affairs Correspondent, Business Day, 8 October 2007

THE Constitutional Court has ruled that when the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) decides on cases about dismissal, it does not have to defer to the decision of the employer to sack workers.

The court on Friday overturned a Supreme Court of Appeal judgment which confirmed a mine employee's dismissal. This restored the CCMA commissioner's award overturning the dismissal.

The ruling clarifies the point that the CCMA, not the employer , decides whether a dismissal is fair or not.

Labour welcomed the decision, and said the previous ruling by the Supreme Court of Appeal would have left workers vulnerable to unfair dismissals.

The case involved the dismissal, more than seven years ago, of Zandise Sidumo by Rustenburg Platinum Mines.

Sidumo was employed to patrol the mine's high security facility and was dismissed for failing to apply established search procedures.

Sidumo contested his dismissal at the CCMA, where a commissioner found Sidumo was guilty of misconduct, but that no dishonesty was involved.

The commissioner took into account Sidumo's clean service record of 15 years and reinstated him with three months' compensation, subject to a written warning valid for three months.

Rustenburg Platinum Mines failed in its appeals to the Labour Court and the Labour Appeal Court. It then appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal, which held that the dismissal was fair.

The appeal court said that in deciding on unfair dismissal disputes, commissioners should approach the employer's sanction in relation to misconduct with a measure of deference. This was because it was the employer's function in the first place to impose the sanction.

Acting Judge Mahomed Navsa said there was nothing in the statutory scheme suggesting that in determining the fairness of a dismissal, a commissioner must approach the matter from the perspective of the employer. &quot;A plain reading of all the relevant provisions compels the conclusion that the commissioner is to determine the dismissal dispute as an impartial adjudicator,&quot; Navsa said.

The CCMA correctly submitted that the decision to dismiss belonged to the employer, but the determination of its fairness did not, he said.

&quot;In approaching the dismissal dispute impartially, a commissioner will take into account the importance of the rule that had been breached.

&quot;The commissioner must of course consider the reason the employer imposed the sanction of dismissal, as he or she must take into account the basis of the employee's challenge to the dismissal.&quot;

In a separate judgment, Judge Sandile Ngcobo said commissioners were required to act fairly in the determination of unfair dismissal disputes. He said if a commissioner failed to do so, he or she would have committed a gross irregularity in the conduct of the arbitration and the ensuing award would be open to review.

Ngcobo said the ultimate test that the commissioner must apply to dismissal disputes was one of fairness.

&quot;It is manifest from the very conception of fairness that the commissioner must hold the balance evenly between the worker and employer. And fairness to both workers and their employers means the absence of bias in favour of either,&quot; Ngcobo said.

He said in the case of Sidumo, the commissioner had to balance employment justice and the need to protect the worker from harsh and arbitrary action, with the need for the efficient operation of the employer's business and the employer's entitlement to satisfactory conduct and work performance .
Ngcobo said the commissioner could not be said to have been unfair to the employer.

2.4 Court ruling shifts balance in cases of unfair dismissal

Ronnie Morris, Business Report, 8 October 2007

It was a landmark judgment that had been eagerly awaited by employers and employees, and was of special significance to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) and Cosatu, which obtained permission to intervene.

On Friday the constitutional court overturned a supreme court of appeal (SCA) decision that had severely criticised the labour appeal court (LAC).

The SCA found that in deciding unfair dismissal disputes, CCMA commissioners should approach the employer's sanction in relation to misconduct with a measure of deference because it was the employer's function in the first place to impose a sanction.

The constitutional court rejected this rule.

The case involved the dismissal more than seven years ago of Z Sidumo, who was employed to patrol a high-security Rustenburg Platinum Mines facility. Sidumo was dismissed for failing to apply established search procedures, but he contested his dismissal, referring the dispute to the CCMA.

The commissioner found Sidumo guilty of misconduct but said no dishonesty was involved. It reinstated him with three months' compensation, subject to a written warning valid for three months.

Rustenburg Platinum applied to the labour court to set aside the award. The labour court dismissed the applicatiton. The mining company then turned to the SCA, which held the dismissal was fair. Sidumo applied to the constitutional court for leave to appeal.

The constitutional court judges wrote four judgments. All agreed that the SCA decision must be overturned.

They were unanimous that in deciding a dismissal dispute, the commissioner was not required to defer to the employer.

However, the commissioner was not given the power to consider afresh what he or she would do, but to decide whether what the employer did was fair.

The commissioner must have regard to all relevant circumstances.

According to Andrew Smith, a senior associate at law firm Bowman Gilfillan, the constitutional court struck a balance between the interests of employers and employees.

2.5 Union's efforts to join Nedlac end up in court

Frank Nxumalo, SABC, 6 October 2007

After nearly four years of frustration, the Confederation of South African Workers Unions (Consawu) is taking the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) to court on Thursday for stalling its application for membership to the Council's Labour Chamber.

Consawu accused Nedlac's labour block - made up of the Congress of SA Trade Unions, National Council of Trade Unions (Nactu) and Federated Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) - of undermining its applications by throwing up minimum provisions which were not provided for by the Nedlac Act.

&quot;There have been media rumours... that the foot-dragging by the three labour federations regarding the admission of Consawu as a Nedlac member was a deliberate strategy to frustrate the federation, in the hopes that its affiliates would eventually defect to the other federations,&quot; said Consawu general secretary, Khulile Nkushubana.

&quot;It is all about an alleged threshold of 300 000 members for the federation membership which is not stipulated by the Nedlac Act. Our membership is 290 000, which is far more than that of Nactu and Fedusa. For example, Fedusa is still a member, even after it lost more than 200 000 members recently when the Public Services Association - its largest affiliate - left them to become an independent union.&quot;

High court action

Nkushubana said it was 'embarrassing' for Consawu to be forced to take legal action against sections of the working class.

&quot;Consawu first applied for admission to Nedlac on August 8, 2003, but ever since then the federation's attempts to join the council have been blocked,&quot; he said. &quot;We had no choice but to go to the high court for help, because all Consawu's other efforts to secure admission to Nedlac have been in vain.&quot;

Consawu has 21 affiliates across the engineering, building, food, agriculture and fishing sectors.

3 Alliance politics

3.1 NC Gauteng elects new leaders

SABC, 7 October 2007

The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng has elected the province's finance MEC Paul Mashatile as its chairperson, while housing MEC Nomvula Mokonyane was voted in as his deputy at the party's 10th provincial conference in Midrand.

Provincial secretary David Makhura and his deputy Mandla Komfe were re-elected unopposed, as well as provincial treasurer Lindiwe Maseko. Gauteng ANC spokesperson Hope Papo says the newly elected party leaders were well received by delegates.

&quot;The conference was quite pleased with the outcome. What also helped was that comrade Angie Motshega, who stood for the position of chair, was the first to stand in conference and congratulate comrade Paul Mashatile,&quot; said Papo.

3.2 ANC succession race gets dirty in final leg

Mariette le Roux, Mail &amp; Guardian, 7 October 2007

The battle for the leadership of the African National Congress (ANC) is becoming ever dirtier and fuelled by paranoia in the final weeks before delegates vote for the as-yet undeclared candidates.

As the party's 2 500-plus branches begin nominating their preferred contender, the challenge on the surface appears a straight contest between incumbent Thabo Mbeki and ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma.

But behind the scenes, a far more bitter contest is being played out, with the rolling of several high-profile heads in recent months seen by analysts as a direct consequence of their membership of rival camps.

&quot;The two main candidates are in mutual destruct mode,&quot; said University of the Witwatersrand political analyst Susan Booysen.

&quot;Everything has been polarised in the war between them.&quot;

Many suspect Mbeki's recent suspension of the country's chief prosecutor, Vusi Pikoli, was designed to turn up the heat on Zuma, who has so far avoided prosecution more than two years after his financial adviser was sentenced to prison for corruption.

The 2005 conviction prompted Mbeki to sack Zuma as the deputy head of state, a move which Zuma has always contended was unjustified.

Other perceived sacrificial lambs include Willie Madisha, the sidelined president of the ANC's labour partner, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), and sacked National Intelligence Agency chief Billy Masetlha.

Madisha, seen as an Mbeki ally, is at the centre of a probe into a missing R500 000 cash donation while Masetlha, who is regarded as close to Zuma, was fired by Mbeki in a fake email scam.

&quot;We've been in a season of smear and counter-smear,&quot; said Keith Gottschalk, head of the University of the Western Cape's political studies department.

&quot;There is less and less discussion about policy, and more personal attacks on individuals.&quot;

While ANC custom frowns upon formal campaigning, Zuma and dark horse businessman Tokyo Sexwale have been busy canvassing around the country.

Mbeki, seen as an efficient, pro-business administrator but criticised for his tolerance of dissident Aids views and his hands-off approach to Zimbabwe, has said he would stand for election if asked.

Analysts believe the president's main aim, however, is to stop Zuma becoming ANC leader.

Zuma, perceived as the leftist candidate, has the backing of Cosatu and the ANC's youth league, and is widely regarded as a populist.

Pretoria-based analyst Dirk Kotze said the leadership race was sowing mistrust and faction-forming in the liberation movement, whose previous leader, Nelson Mandela, was the country's first black president.

&quot;There is intense suspicion among members. Everybody wonders where everyone else stands and whose side they are on.&quot;

In government since the whites-only apartheid regime fell in 1994, the ANC has no term limitations on leadership. But the country's Constitution prevents Mbeki seeking presidential re-election in 2009.

The new party leader will be elected by secret vote at a national conference in December, with each of the nine provinces, the youth league and the women's league proposing a candidate.

As the battle intensifies, its outcome remains too close to call.

Kotze believes Zuma has been making great strides but could still come unstuck if charged before December.

If Zuma is charged, this could pave the way for Sexwale &quot;as it will then no longer be necessary for Mbeki to stand&quot;, he said.

Booysen believed Mbeki and Zuma had been so weakened that a compromise candidate may be nominated from the floor at the December conference.

These could include former unionist and businessman Cyril Ramaphosa or ANC secretary general Kgalema Motlanthe.

&quot;It is still impossible to call,&quot; said Gottschalk. - AFP

3.3 Gauteng ANC vote gives Sexwale early poll lift

Sibongakonke Shoba, General Reporter, Business Day, 8 October 2007
THE election of Gauteng finance MEC Paul Mashatile as the African National Congress' (ANC's) provincial chairman at the party's conference in Midrand yesterday is seen as a small victory for Tokyo Sexwale's bid to lead the ANC.
Mashatile is believed to support Sexwale and his victory means that the businessman has a sympathiser in the province's top leadership.
However, this does not mean that Mashatile can sway the province in Sexwale's favour, as rank-and-file members have shown support for party deputy president Jacob Zuma.
&quot;It (Mashatile's election) does not mean Sexwale will get automatic support from the ANC branches,&quot; political analyst Adam Habib said yesterday.
On Saturday, the provincial conference erupted into thunderous applause at the mention of Zuma's name, while Sexwale got a lukewarm response.
Seated among the delegates, Sexwale kept a low profile throughout the first session of the conference.
He has been on the campaign trail and is seen as a compromise candidate between President Thabo Mbeki and Zuma.
The three men - Zuma, Mbeki and Sexwale - have been mooted in Gauteng as possible nominees for the presidency of the ANC.
Gauteng branches are expected to be begin compiling their list of nominations in earnest this week, after the weekend conference.
Delegates sang pro-Zuma songs before the start of the conference, and erupted when outgoing chairman Mbhazima Shilowa mentioned Zuma's name at the opening of the conference.
The crowd did not react in the same way when Mbeki's name was mentioned earlier.
Zuma and Mbeki, neither of whom attended the opening, are the front runners in the ANC presidential race.
The Gauteng provincial executive committee has not pronounced on its preferred presidential candidate and many in the provincial leadership are in favour of a compromise candidate - such as Sexwale - in an attempt to unify the party.
Mashatile's election makes it more difficult to predict which presidential candidate the divided province will throw its weight behind.
Mashatile beat former deputy chair and Zuma supporter Angie Motshekga.
Housing MEC Nomvula Mokonyane was chosen as deputy chairwoman. Lindiwe Maseko was elected treasurer, while both secretary David Makhura and his deputy Mandla Nkomfe retained their posts.
Mashatile made headlines in May when he and transport MEC Ignatius Jacobs announced a R12bn monorail to run between central Johannesburg and Soweto, apparently before discussing it with the national government. The cabinet vetoed the project.
Mashatile is also seen as a Shilowa ally, and it is believed that the former chairman prefers him as his successor, although Shilowa told a news conference on Saturday that he had no preferred candidate to succeed him.
&quot;Even if I had, it would be unethical (to mention him)... I would not go about talking about it.&quot;
Earlier, Shilowa warned delegates to &quot;speak well of your candidate, not ill of the other&quot;. He encouraged delegates to support any leaders that were elected.
&quot;We don't say after the conference 'We declare war because our leader was not chosen'.
&quot;Collective leadership is very important,&quot; he said.
Shilowa said the provincial executive committee did not have a list of candidates for the ANC's top six national posts.
&quot;The province should be the last to pronounce on leadership so that our branches can back it. All of us, we have our own preferences, but that counts little, branches will nominate,&quot; he said.

Shilowa said he was worried about the way succession was handled at national level, warning that it might cause divisions in the province.

He said whoever was elected to lead the province should not be chosen because of who that person supported at national level.

Shilowa expressed concern at the provincial ANC's failure to reach its target of 90000 members.

He said the majority in the province still voted for the ANC at elections but party membership had not increased.

He said the ANC Youth League and Women's League were in similar positions, and it was the duty of the ANC to strengthen the leagues.

Gauteng Premier announces shock decision to step down

The ANC leadership race threatens to change the character of the organisation and to rip provinces apart, Gauteng Premier and ANC provincial chairman Mbhazima Shilowa warned this week.

Telling stunned delegates to the party's Gauteng provincial conference at Gallagher Estate that he would not be available for another term as provincial chairman after December or as premier after 2009, Shilowa urged them to avoid personality politics in the choice of his successor and of a new party president.

&quot;How we handle our succession will define the character of our organisation. We must work for collective leadership and avoid situations that will see individuals taking over the organisation,&quot; he said.

He added that the fights had the potential to derail progress made in the province to unite the organisation.

Shilowa, a consistent supporter of President Thabo Mbeki against presidential hopeful Jacob Zuma, told delegates to protect the organisation against individuals intent on destroying the movement, but did not say to whom he was referring.

&quot;However, I am confident we will emerge out of this conference united,&quot; he added.
Conference delegates identified three potential candidates to succeed Shilowa:

?  Education MEC Angie Motshekga, who is seen as a Zuma supporter;

?  Finance MEC Paul Mashatile, who is seen to be an Mbeki man; and

?  Housing Minister Nomvula Mokonyane, who has limited West Rand support.

Mashatile was nominated by the provincial youth league last week as its preferred candidate to take over from Shilowa, but he is seen to be handicapped by extensive outside business interests.

Those close to him say he is caught in a dilemma - to go into business or continue to fight Motshekga.

In another twist yesterday, West Rand delegates said they would nominate Mokonyane for the chair, saying she could take the province to another level.

The inclusion of Mokonyane in the race is seen by some delegates as an attempt to split the vote of Mashatile and Motshekga.

However, one senior delegate who supports Motshekga said there was nothing that would stop her from taking over.

&quot;Motshekga's election does not mean majority support for Jacob Zuma in the province,&quot; he said.

Presidential hopeful Tokyo Sexwale attended the conference, but kept a low profile at the start, sitting quietly away from party heavyweights Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, Frene Ginwala and Joel Netshitenzhe as the conference erupted into song at the official opening.

Meanwhile, the ANC's 400- odd branches in the KwaZulu- Natal heartland of Zuma support began the process of nominations for key leadership positions at the party's national conference in Polokwane in December.

The province took an informal decision to back Zuma, the ANC's current deputy president, for the party presidency at a provincial general council meeting last year. The ANC Youth League and Cosatu have taken similar positions in favour of Zuma's bid.

The provincial ANC position is likely to be confirmed by the province's 11 regions, which have until November 11 to consolidate branch positions. A formal provincial list for the top five and other national executive committee positions will be submitted to the ANC's electoral commission on November 20.

KwaZulu-Natal is the ANC's second biggest province and will have 608 delegates at the elective December meeting.

It is by far the most vociferous supporter of Zuma, with many of his most influential backers also based in the province.

The branch nomination process will also see delegates to the conference being elected, with Zuma's supporters in the province lobbying hard to ensure that pro-Zuma delegates are in the majority of those who go to conference on a KwaZulu- Natal ticket.

The party's influential eThekwini Region - the biggest and wealthiest in the province - yesterday began the general meetings at its 92 branches which have qualified to both nominate leaders and send a total of 170 delegates to the national conference. The region has already resolved to back Zuma and its branches are likely to follow suit during the nomination process.

The province has also passed a resolution giving provincial secretary Senzo Mchunu - a keen Zuma loyalist - chairman S'bu Ndebele and deputy chairman Dr Zweli Mkhize a mandate to lobby other provinces and ANC structures in Zuma's favour ahead of the conference.

While officially no lobbying will take place before the provincial positions are consolidated, sources say this is already under way and initial meetings are being held to sound out other structures.

Mchunu was not available for comment yesterday, but told the Sunday Times recently that &quot;there has not been any deviation&quot; from the Provincial General Council decision to back Zuma for the number one position in the ANC.

&quot;From branches there will be consolidation at regional level which will come to the provincial general council in November so that we go to conference with a single list,&quot; Mchunu said.

&quot;If any province approaches us [for lobbying purposes] we are available and mandated for those discussions.&quot;

3.5 Mbeki camp unveils wish list

S'Thembiso Msomi, City Press, 7 October 2007

A NATIONAL gathering of the group supporting President Thabo Mbeki for leadership of the ANC has produced a list of leaders to be elected in December that excludes his present deputy, Jacob Zuma.
Also excluded is SACP secretary general Blade Nzimande and the other presidential hopeful, Tokyo Sexwale. The list however includes Cyril Ramaphosa, who has been mentioned as a possible contender. He is listed as an additional member of the NEC, as well as Winnie Madikizela-Mandela - the latter in the top 20.

The meeting took place in Johannesburg on Friday evening and went on until around 3am yesterday morning, a number of reliable City Press sources confirmed.

It had representatives from Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, North West, Free State, Eastern Cape and Northern Cape. Gauteng and Western Cape did not attend but sent their list proposal. Gauteng cited preparations for the ongoing provincial conference in Midrand as a reason why they could not attend.

The top six for the lobby are Mbeki, Foreign Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as his deputy, government policy head Joel Netshitenzhe as national chairperson, Defence Minister Mosiuoa Lekota as secretary-general, and Public Works Minister Thoko Didiza as his deputy. The treasurer-general is Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka.

Also in the top 20 is Gauteng premier Sam Shilowa, present deputy secretary-general Sankie Mthembi-Mahanyele, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, former Parliament Speaker Frene Ginwala, embattled Cosatu president Willie Madisha, Minister Essop Pahad, director-general in the Presidency Frank Chikane, Mavivi Myakayaka-Manzini, Alec Erwin, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, Jabu Moleketi and his wife Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, Naledi Pandor, Slumko Nondwangu, Phillip Dexter, Langa Zitha, Ace Magashule, Charlotte Lobe and Andile Nkuhlu, who has been national co-ordinator of the Mbeki lobby group.

The others on the list are Nomatyala Hangana, Pam Tshwete, Aziz Pahad, Thandi Modise, Zola Skweyiya, Dipuo Peters, Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, Mluleki George who convenes the lobby group, Lulu Xingwana, Sello Moloto, Brigitte Mabandla, Molefi Sefularo, Zoe Kota, Saki Macozoma, Kiki Rwexana, S'bu Ndebele and Qedani Mahlangu.

The list includes names of people seen as part of the Zuma group, such as secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe, Housing Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, Speaker Baleka Mbete, Transport Minister Jeff Radebe and Home Affairs Deputy Minister Malusi Gigaba.

One source who was in the meeting said this was because &quot;our primary objective is to work for a united ANC.

&quot;We are not interested in politics of sidelining individuals and dividing the ANC into factions. We value people for what they have to contribute, regardless of their backgrounds.

&quot;If you look at our proposed list of candidates for NEC, you will see that it includes comrades who are also part of other lists that have been making rounds for some time now, which are unfortunately firmly based on factional grounds.

&quot;People need to be mature in their approach to the issue of leadership for the sake of our beloved movement.

&quot;The ANC doesn't belong to unionists and communists only, as much as it doesn't belong to business people and academics exclusively.

&quot;It's a broad church that accommodates people from different walks of life. People must not be misled by factional loudhailers,&quot; a provincial secretary said.

The meeting decided that the list must be sent to all branch general meetings from yesterday morning to &quot;counter the Youth League and Cosatu lists.&quot;

Nkuhlu was sending it out by late yesterday, with several people reporting receiving it by sms.

The list is the first confirmation that should the Mbeki group win, Dlamini-Zuma would become President of the country.

It also confirms earlier assertions that Mlambo-Ngcuka would leave government as the treasurer job is a full time position.

Netshitenzhe has consistently declined nomination for any of the top six positions, saying he preferred to work in the background.

However many within the ANC say he is destined to be Dlamini Zuma's deputy if the group wins.

Another source said the meeting was for provincial leaders supportive of Mbeki to agree on a national list. Many of the delegates from outside Gauteng were seen at the Gauteng provincial gathering yesterday.

Limpopo was represented by the provincial chairperson and two members of the provincial executive (PEC), Northern Cape two PEC members, Eastern Cape had its provincial secretary and two PEC members, Free State had two PEC members, Mpumalanga had its chairperson and a member of the PEC, North West had its secretary, and KZN by two MEC's and a former mayor of Pietermaritzburg.

3.6 Bitter contest for leadership of South Africa's ruling ANC party

AFP, 7 October 2007

The battle for the leadership of South Africa's ruling ANC is becoming ever dirtier and fuelled by paranoia in the final weeks before delegates vote for the as-yet undeclared candidates.

As the party's 2,500-plus branches begin nominating their preferred contender, the challenge on the surface appears a straight contest between incumbent Thabo Mbeki and deputy African National Congress head Jacob Zuma.

But behind the scenes, a far more bitter contest is being played out with the rolling of several high-profile heads in recent months seen by analysts as a direct consequence of their membership of rival camps.

&quot;The two main candidates are in mutual destruct mode,&quot; said University of the Witwatersrand political analyst Susan Booysen.

&quot;Everything has been polarised in the war between them.&quot;

Many suspect Mbeki's recent suspension of the country's chief prosecutor, Vusi Pikoli, was designed to turn up the heat on Zuma, who has so far avoided prosecution more than two years after his financial advisor was sentenced to prison for bribery.

The 2005 conviction prompted Mbeki to sack Zuma as the deputy head of state, a move which Zuma has always contended was unjustified.

Other perceived sacrificial lambs include Willie Madisha, the sidelined president of the ANC's labour partner, COSATU, and the sacked national intelligence agency chief Billy Masetlha.

Madisha, seen as an Mbeki ally, is at the centre of a probe into a missing 500,000 rand cash donation while Masetlha, who is regarded as close to Zuma, was fired by Mbeki in a fake email scam.

&quot;We've been in a season of smear and counter-smear,&quot; said Keith Gottschalk, head of the University of the Western Cape's political studies department.

&quot;There is less and less discussion about policy, and more personal attacks on individuals.&quot;

While ANC custom frowns upon formal campaigning, Zuma and dark horse businessman Tokyo Sexwale have been busy canvassing around the country.

Mbeki, seen as an efficient, pro-business administrator but criticised for his tolerance of dissident AIDS views and his hands-off approach to Zimbabwe, has said he would stand for election if asked.

Analysts believe the president's main aim however is to stop Zuma becoming ANC leader in the last two years of Mbeki's 10-year tenure as head of state.

Zuma, perceived as the leftist candidate, has the backing of COSATU and the ANC's youth league, and is widely regarded as a populist.

Pretoria-based analyst Dirk Kotze said the leadership race was sowing mistrust and faction-forming in the liberation movement whose previous leader Nelson Mandela was the country's first black president.

&quot;There is intense suspicion among members. Everybody wonders where everyone else stands and whose side they are on.&quot;

In government since the whites-only apartheid regime fell in 1994, the ANC has no term limitations on leadership. But the country's constitution prevents Mbeki seeking presidential re-election in 2009.

The new party leader will be elected by secret vote at a national conference in December, with each of the nine provinces, the youth league and the women's league proposing a candidate.

As the battle intensifies, its outcome remains too close to call.

Kotze believes Zuma has been making great strides but could still come unstuck if charged before December.

If Zuma is charged, this could pave the way for Sexwale &quot;as it will then no longer be necessary for Mbeki to stand,&quot; he said.

Booysen believed Mbeki and Zuma had been so weakened that a compromise candidate may be nominated from the floor at the December conference.

These could include former unionist and businessman Cyril Ramaphosa or ANC secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe.

&quot;It is still impossible to call,&quot; said Gottschalk.

3.7 Reasons Mbeki still has the edge

Anthony Butler, Business Day, 8 October 2007

PRESIDENT Thabo Mbeki's campaign to retain the presidency of the African National Congress (ANC) is allegedly on the rocks.

Despite the legal question marks surrounding Jacob Zuma, the ANC deputy president now enjoys the backing of important liberation movement lobbies. Canvassers for the main contenders who have toured the country talking to branch opinion formers are reporting back to their principals that there is widespread negative sentiment towards Mbeki and his ambitions for a third term.

There is some suggestion that a rout by the left at December's national conference could radically change the balance of power on the ANC's national executive committee. Such an outcome would protect Zuma's candidacy for the state presidency against post-conference legal and political challenges.

However, three major cautions are in order for those who believe that Zuma already has the presidency of the liberation movement in the bag.

First, Mbeki continues to enjoy incumbency advantages and remains a resilient campaigner. He is unlikely to care that the ANC is sending him &quot;clear signals&quot; that his days are numbered, and neither will he fear &quot;embarrassment&quot; at the conference. Indeed, he cannot retire from the game because he has nowhere else to go.

Second, Mbeki's record continues to be presented favourably in the news media that will most influence conference delegates. The international media and white-oriented local newspapers certainly bewail &quot;10 wasted years&quot;, comparatively slow economic growth, a &quot;disastrous&quot; HIV/AIDS policy, rampant crime, and the reduction of foreign policy flagship New Partnership for Africa's Development to an object of ridicule on the continent. But Mbeki's campaigners have had some real success in turning this hostile climate to their advantage.

The Presidency has decisively terminated its courtship of the &quot;white&quot; media. Whispering campaigns against newspaper editors have now been supplanted by open hostility, most recently in Minister in the
Presidency Essop Pahad's baring of fangs at the Sunday Times. Media managers have repackaged press criticism as an assault, by the established media and its black stooges, on an Mbeki government that threatens conservative white interests.

Many ANC members depend on the state broadcaster's television and radio broadcasts for hard news. The SABC continues to don rosy spectacles when it comes to the accomplishments of the president and his ministers. The campaigns of Zuma and Tokyo Sexwale are almost invisible on the airwaves it controls.

Equally important for Mbeki is the steady support of the opinion-forming newspapers of the black middle class. City Press, in particular, continues to showcase an Mbeki government that is on top of its key domestic and foreign policy challenges. In recent weeks its news-analysis pages have celebrated the launch of an anti-crime strategy to transform the criminal justice system, a bargaining council proposal to double the remuneration of many teachers, and a health sector agreement concerning massive wage increases for nurses and other health professionals. Mbeki's timely &quot;mediation success&quot; in Zimbabwe has also been favourably reported and his marginalisation in the evolving politics of the African continent has been almost entirely ignored.

It is striking that there has been no coherent general assault on Mbeki's legacy. Meanwhile, Ronald Suresh Roberts has presented the president as a voice of reason even where he has appeared most vulnerable, in the debate over antiretroviral treatments for HIV/AIDS. Although directorgeneral of the communications department Lyndall Shope-Mafole recently confessed to being busy with her third reading of Roberts's Fit to Govern, few ordinary South Africans will ever make their way through Roberts's tome even once. Nevertheless, activists may be influenced by the very existence of a sacred text that defends Mbeki's record.

A third caution concerns the conservatism of many of the delegates who will be in attendance at the ANC conference in Limpopo. Politically conservative activists will balk at the unprecedented step of pushing a sitting ANC president out of office. Zuma, meanwhile, has been divisive, touted himself for office, allowed ethnic mobilisation to be exploited on his behalf, and embarrassed the ANC with his personal behaviour. The fact that Mbeki has been assiduously courting the African churches may reflect Zuma's potential vulnerability on matters of personal morality.

Zuma's supporters are angry and loud, but noise in the ANC is usually inversely proportional to power.
He has courted a vulgar left that has overstepped the boundaries of its proper authority, an opportunistic alliance of Umkhonto we Sizwe veterans, a Youth League rabble that is feeding at the trough of capital, and a visibly degenerating South African Communist Party.

Every two votes for Zuma from such camps may count for three against him from ordinary branch delegates.

Zuma's fundamental weakness is that so much of his apparent support remains reactive. He is a victim of what is perceived to be Mbeki's abuse of state power, and his candidacy is reinvigorated by every attempt to prosecute him. The central objective of many Zuma supporters is to ensure that Mbeki cannot dominate the choice of his own successor as state president.

The consequence for Zuma is that he is trapped within a paradox of power. For as long as he remains a victim - crushed by Mbeki's state machine and the only obstacle to prolonged Mbeki domination - he will continue to be a magnet for support.

But the stronger Zuma becomes, the more he undercuts the foundations of his own campaign. The closer he comes to winning in December, the more likely it becomes that his supporters, at the last hurdle, will desert him.

4 NPA/Selebi controversy

4.1 SA faces a serious crisis, says Cosatu

Chiara Carter, Boyd Webb and Deon de Lange, Cape Argus, 5 October 2007

The ANC's ally, Cosatu, on Friday warned that the country faced a &quot;serious crisis&quot; after the National Prosecuting Authority finally confirmed it had indeed obtained search and arrest warrants for the country's top cop, Commissioner Jackie Selebi, last month prior to NPA boss Vusi Pikoli's suspension.

Cosatu said this confirmed its &quot;worst fears&quot; and called for the inquiry into whether Pikoli was fit to hold office to be widened to include broader &quot;political questions&quot; about the role of the NPA, the Scorpions and other state agencies.

Meanwhile, Selebi faced renewed calls from opposition quarters for him voluntarily to step down from office.

Cosatu's central executive committee on Friday expressed extreme concern at reports that suggested the real reason for Pikoli's being suspended related to the issuing of an arrest warrant against Selebi.

A statement issued after the meeting said: &quot;If these allegations are true, then we face a major constitutional crisis in the country and this would be a vindication of what we have always believed.&quot;

DA leader in parliament Sandra Botha, writing in the DA's weekly electronic letter on Friday, said the president's reported interventions in the Selebi matter, if true, amounted to obstruction of justice and were a violation of the constitutionally entrenched principle of the separation of powers and appeared to have undermined both the letter and the spirit of the law.

&quot;The president's silence in the face of such a serious constitutional crisis is already doing potentially irreparable harm to our democratic institutions.

&quot;There appears to be no reason for the people of South Africa to simply 'trust him' as he requested at the beginning of this saga,&quot; she added.

&quot;The question can only be asked as to what kind of hold the commissioner has over the president, for the president to protect him at the cost of the independence and integrity of our democratic institutions,&quot; Botha said.

Cosatu, the DA and the ACDP all expressed concern over the appointment of Frene Ginwala to head the commission in the light of her being an ANC national executive committee member and having been part of the ministerial review commission on intelligence.

4.2 Nation has been misled' over Selebi

Mail &amp; Guardian, 8 October 2007

South African President Thabo Mbeki came under mounting pressure over the weekend to explain his suspension of the country's top prosecutor, a controversial move weeks before a crunch vote on his leadership of the African National Congress (ANC).

&quot;Tell us the truth, Mr President,&quot; the Sunday Times newspaper implored in a front-page headline, as opposition leaders accused Mbeki of &quot;misleading the nation&quot;.

South Africa has been thrown into a political crisis after it emerged that Mbeki suspended National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) chief Vusi Pikoli days after the NPA obtained arrest and search warrants for police National Commissioner Jackie Selebi.

The revelations appeared to discredit the presidency's initial explanation that Pikoli was suspended because of &quot;an irretrievable breakdown&quot; in his working relationship with Justice and Constitutional Development Minister Brigitte Mabandla.

The affair has also raised questions about Mbeki's relationship with the country's top cop -- Selebi is also the head of Interpol -- who has been accused of being cosy with criminals.

The NPA on Friday confirmed that it had obtained two warrants against Selebi prior to Pikoli's suspension on September 23.

It also revealed that Mokotedi Mpshe, the acting head of the NPA, had cancelled the warrant for Selebi's arrest pending his review of the case against the police commissioner.

The M&amp;G has established that the charges levelled against Selebi include corruption, fraud, racketeering and defeating the ends of justice.

A senior source in the justice department said the corruption charge derived from allegations that Selebi had received bribes of &quot;hundreds of thousands of rands&quot; from Glenn Agliotti, the alleged organised crime boss whom Selebi described as his &quot;friend, finish and klaar&quot;.

Mbeki last year downplayed the allegations against Selebi, saying he could be trusted to act against the police chief if necessary.

Opposition parties this week heaped scorn on the official version of Pikoli's suspension.

&quot;The nation has been misled,&quot; said Independent Democrats leader Patricia de Lille. &quot;It has all to do with the Selebi affair.&quot;

&quot;The perception that is being created now is that, indeed there is a friendship that we don't understand between the president and Selebi,&quot; according to the national chairperson of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Zanele Magwaza-Msibi.

&quot;It is quite clear that he [Mbeki] has intervened to stop the Selebi warrant and that in itself constitutes a crisis,&quot; said the leader of the main opposition Democratic Alliance, Helen Zille, urging Mbeki to provide clarification.

In a statement, the government &quot;categorically denied&quot; Mbeki suspended Pikoli in an attempt to protect Selebi and urged South Africans to await the results of a commission of inquiry into Pikoli's fitness for office.

An irritated Mbeki, when confronted by a television journalist over the affair, merely pointed out that a president does &quot;not handle warrants.&quot;

The furore comes ahead of a crunch ANC party conference in December, at which the party is set to elect a new leader.

Mbeki, who has served two five-year terms as party leader, appears to be courting a third term over archrival, ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma.

The NPA is investigating Zuma following the conviction in 2005 of his former financial adviser for fraud relating to South Africa's biggest-to-date arms acquisition deal. That conviction led to Mbeki sacking Zuma as state deputy president, a decision that forged deep divisions in the party.

Analysts have speculated that Pikoli's suspension may also be related to the NPA's failure to bring fresh corruption charges against Zuma. A first corruption case against Zuma was thrown out of court late last year over delays.

Gauteng ANC vote

Meanwhile, the ANC in Gauteng has elected as its chairperson the province's finance minister Paul Mashatile.

Provincial housing minister Nomvula Mokonyane was elected deputy chairperson at the ANC Gauteng's 10th provincial conference in Midrand.

The three-day conference was attended by more than 3 000 delegates. They re-elected, unopposed, David Makhura as provincial secretary, Mandla Nkomfe as deputy secretary and Lindiwe Maseko as treasurer.

Spokesperson Hope Papo said voting for additional members of the provincial executive would take place on Monday, with the results to be announced on Tuesday.

Business Day reported on Monday that Mashatile's election can be seen as a small victory for Tokyo's Sexwale's bid to lead the ANC.

Mashatile is believed to support Sexwale, the business daily said, but rank-and-file members of the party have shown support for Zuma.

The paper said the conference erupted into applause when Zuma's name was mentioned, while Sexwale got a more muted response. - Sapa-DPA, Sapa, Staff Reporter

4.3 Scorpions plotted survival strategy to retain autonomy

Buddy Naidu, Sunday Times, 7 October 2007

The Directorate of Special Operations (DSO), also known as the Scorpions, devised a survival strategy as early as June this year to prevent the unit from being assimilated into the South African Police Service.

This is according to a first-hand account, written by a Scorpions' senior manager (and in the possession of the Sunday Times), detailing the events of a special management meeting.

The June meeting was convened around the time of the ANC policy conference, which had passed a resolution for the Scorpions to be &quot;co-located&quot; within the SAPS. This is expected to be ratified at the party's national conference to be held in Limpopo in December.

The &quot;special meeting&quot; was held to thrash out a battle plan to see how the Scorpions could &quot;influence the process in order to retain the status quo&quot; before December. At the meeting, Scorpions' boss Leonard McCarthy is alleged to have also listed four legal matters that could be seen as &quot;problematic&quot; to the organisation and that must be &quot;handled&quot; by the end of the year.

These were the Zuma corruption case as well as pending investigations into former Transport Minister Mac Maharaj and former Limpopo Premier Ngoako Ramatlhodi .

The fourth matter - which has become the central focus - was the &quot;Bad Guys&quot; investigation.

This is the wide-ranging probe into organised crime and, although he is not mentioned, the probe into national Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi.

The report stated that the case was &quot;very important to the DSO&quot; and that it could mark the &quot;life or death&quot; of the organisation. This is why the Scorpions' regional head for Gauteng, Gerrie Nel, was designated as lead prosecutor in the matter.

On Friday, Nel appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court, where he is involved in the prosecution of Glenn Agliotti, the alleged mastermind behind the Brett Kebble murder.

McCarthy further informed those present at the June meeting that the unit's investigating director had been designated to assist Nel on a full-time basis.

&quot;That was very strange ... as we would not be told of the reason for the importance of this matter - for it to even require such high-level intervention.

&quot;To us it was an ordinary, albeit complicated organised crime matter involving drugs, murder and serious economic crime related matters,&quot; wrote the author.

Various strategies were discussed to ensure the organisation's survival.

These included a return to so-called &quot;Hollywood- style&quot; operations as well as holding &quot;publicity exercises&quot; to win the support of government, business and the public.

In addition, politicians and business leaders, who were sympathetic to the crime-busting organisation, would also be lobbied.

A legal challenge to retain its status was also discussed, in light of the Khampepe Commission, which recommended that the Scorpions continue to operate under the ambit of the National Prosecuting Authority.

The report said McCarthy did not elaborate on why the four cases were &quot;problematic&quot; but he promised to provide background information at a later stage.

Discussion also centred around the autonomy of the unit, if it were relocated to the SAPS.

The executive then resolved, according to the report, to embark on an aggressive marketing exercise, with certain cases to be identified.

It was resolved that the Scorpions' top management would deal with the four cases that had been identified at the meeting, and they would ascertain how these cases should be approached.

When approached for comment this week, members of the unit's executive refused to discuss the report. However, one member admitted that such a discussion had taken place. An official approach to McCarthy was met with silence.

4.4 Scorpions an infested den?

Makhudu Sefara and Dumisane Lubisi, City Press, 7 October 2007

Vusi Pikoli, the suspended head of the National Prosecuting Authority, must convince the Ginwala inquiry that the granting of indemnity to known criminals was warranted and in the best interests of justice and national and public security.

VUSI Pikoli begins an arduous journey this week. He must take tough decisions. History will judge him by what he decides to do in the next few weeks.

On his plate is a charge of incompetence, an accusation of poor judgment, a claim that he is so blinded by factional turf wars with the police that he is willing to release dangerous criminals into society so he can arrest the chief of police, Jackie Selebi.

Pikoli is also accused of failing to rein in &quot;unreconstructed, angry racists&quot; in The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), who are allegedly motivated by a desire to tarnish the image of key ANC and government figures.

Pikoli, as most people will know is a man who takes himself seriously. In the context of his current battles, this is a key to his success.

A key decision for him is not whether to take the fight to Justice Minister Brigitte Mabandla and, by extension, President Thabo Mbeki, it is how far that fight can be taken.

In other words, Pikoli will have to look beyond the Ginwala inquiry. Will he go all the way and follow the same route as fired former National Intelligence Agency head Billy Masetlha?

Observers say Masetlha was motivated by issues - which may or may not include a political desire to humiliate Mbeki - other than to prove he was fired unjustly. Those close to Pikoli say &quot;he has more enemies in the Jacob Zuma camp and knows he can't deliver Mbeki on a platter&quot; to the ANC deputy president.

Mbeki will need the support of Parliament if the removal of Pikoli is to succeed.

But how did it fall apart for Pikoli and why is the leadership of the Scorpions spared from all this?
Government spokesperson Themba Maseko says Mabandla will deliver a report on how her relationship with Pikoli broke down and how trust between them can never be restored.

This submission, expected early next week, will have to address itself to these terms of reference:
?  The exercise of discretion by Pikoli in the decision to prosecute offenders or grant immunity from prosecution to suspects allegedly involved in organised crime with particular regard to the public interest and the national security interests of the country; and
?  The breakdown of the relationship between Mabandla and Pikoli in the context of the legislative and constitutional obligations placed on the minister and him.

The first is a review of decisions and agreements Pikoli authorised in terms of which he is perceived to have been blinded by turf wars to pursue Selebi but, in the process, releasing back into society, dangerous criminals without &quot;regard to the public interest and the national security interest&quot;.

The context here is the granting of immunity from prosecution to three bouncers alleged to have carried out the murder of businessman Brett Kebble. They are Faizel Smith, Mickey Schultz and Nigel McGurk.

The three also secured immunity from prosecution in other cases where they were being investigated. Among others, this relates to a drive-by shooting in Cape Town where an unidentified person died and the killing of a witness in the Hazel Crane murder. Crane was killed by people with links to the Israeli mafia.

It is significant that the lawyer for the three this week hastened to publicly confirm the immunity, shutting the door on a review. The lawyer obviously does not want the NPA to renege on the deal.

With the killers off the hook, the three incriminated Clinton Nassif, who had allegedly assembled them on the instructions of Glenn Agliotti. As the case against Nassif appeared to tighten, he said he had ratted on Agliotti and would help the Scorpions catch a bigger fish.

When the Scorpions looked at Agliotti's background, they found he was &quot;the Landlord&quot; they had been chasing and felt he was a better catch than Nassif. A deal was made and Nassif saved his head with a Section 204 immunity in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act.

The Scorpions interrogated Agliotti and apparently found overwhelming evidence of his involvement in crime. When it became clear to him that the end was nigh, Agliotti - to save his skin - allegedly implicated Selebi and John Stratton. Selebi is alleged to have helped Agliotti escape the wrath of the law while Stratton was allegedly the mastermind behind Kebble's &quot;assisted suicide&quot;.

Now Pikoli's headache is explaining how his Scorpions investigators could not crack the investigation without offering the three murderers, their handler and alleged fraudster Nassif and Agliotti, immunity.

Apart from his involvement in the Kebble saga, Agliotti faces charges of kidnapping state witness Lesley Allan Curtis, smuggling drugs from Iran stashed in a shipment of gas stoves and running a criminal syndicate.

In this case, the Scorpions have given Curtis, Christiaan Alblas and Pedro Luis Marques immunity after they had implicated Agliotti and Stephanos Paparas, his father Dimitrio, and Stanley Poonin.

Put differently, the Scorpions granted Nassif, Curtis, Alblas and Marques immunity to nail one man, Agliotti. But, it now appears, even Agliotti will not be nailed because he has &quot;dirt&quot; on Selebi.

In his defence on the drugs allegation, Agliotti told the Alberton Magistrates' court &quot;it would seem as if the brunt of the witnesses the state intend calling to incriminate me are, on their own admission, drug dealers with an obvious disrespect of law, order and justice.

&quot;I have been advised that the sentences imposed on my ex-accused who admit to have already exported drugs worth millions of rands out of the country, and who have admitted to be part of an international syndicate is extremely low . . . submit this is an incentive to anybody to lie.&quot;

A security expert said: &quot;Why can't the same argument now be used against Agliotti and the seven others? Was he also given an incentive to lie? But the trend, if you look carefully at these immunities, appears to be that with the Scorpions, you can do crime as long as you have dirt on someone bigger than you against whom you are prepared to testify.&quot;

On the surface, there appear to be about eight criminals being let loose to nail Selebi who was not an accessory to the commission of the crimes they confessed to, but had allegedly helped Agliotti to escape justice.

Said another source: &quot;Pikoli must convince Ginwala that the release of all these criminals was warranted. We all agree that Selebi must fall, if he acted as alleged. But you can't argue that you were unable to secure one, two or even three key immunities and then try the other people with Selebi and Agliotti.

&quot;If Agliotti is this dangerous criminal who controls networks inside and outside the country, is nicknamed 'the Landlord' because of his power, why must he . . . be released back into society?

&quot;Why is it that in the Boeremag trial, the state is able to offer immunity to one accused and nail 23 others but, in this case, eight people get off scot-free to nail two?&quot;

And therein lies the crux.

The question is what justification Pikoli has for all this. Does he believe the &quot;public interest and national security interests of the Republic&quot; are served by these immunities?

NPA spokesperson Tlali Tlali says plea bargains should not be given a bad name because they help in very complex cases.

He says people should not forget that it is not the NPA that grants immunity, it is the presiding officer who decides at the end of the case whether the witness deserves immunity or not. This, he adds, is based on whether they were truthful and told all they knew about the crime. It is in this light, says a source, that not all eight should be presumed beneficiaries of immunity until they'e testified in court.

A source close to the NPA says the use of private security companies can be defended because the NPA does not have the capacity to conduct massive operations without help.

Another source said the decision to charge Selebi was taken, principally, by Pikoli and Willie Hofmeyr, head of the Asset Forfeiture Unit.

Apparently, McCarthy had expressed a different opinion but was quick to give up, saying the NPA Act gave Pikoli all the rights to decide.

A source close to McCarthy said the Scorpions' boss discussed his frustration with Deputy Justice Minister Johnny de Lange who felt that Pikoli had lost the plot.

A source said McCarthy was a political animal who had close ties with former NPA head Bulelani Ngcuka and De Lange.

&quot;Pikoli and McCarthy have a good working relationship but Pikoli is sometimes out of touch with what happens there because McCarthy is also not given much, unless he demands it,&quot; said a source.

&quot;Both share a weakness - they lacked the ability to transform the Scorpions,&quot; added the source.
Another source said the number of private security firms working for the Scorpions was another problem the duo lacked the eagerness to solve.

&quot;The Browse report, that politically-charged document rejected outright for its lies, is a Scorpions document,&quot; said the source.

&quot;The Scorpions have been a den of unreconstructed people who pursue political agendas and the failure by Pikoli and McCarthy to deal with this has become a major problem. But the key question is whether removing Pikoli alone is sufficient while leaving the infested den for whoever takes over from Pikoli.&quot;

Acting NPA head Mokotedi Mpshe will review the case against Selebi and take a decision on whether the police chief should fry or not.

But a technicality for the NPA could be that it is now in possession of incriminating evidence against the eight obtained not because of its investigations but from confessions drawn with the promise of immunity. If Mokotedi says these people must also be prosecuted, the defence is likely to argue that the Scorpions have evidence which was obtained under false pretences and, as a result, the eight could still walk.

At the end of the saga, South Africans will still ask if it was a result of turf wars, a case of incompetence, poor judgment, or whether Pikoli, the principled defender of independence, was stopped from fighting for the fairness of the justice system.

4.5 Agliotti poser for NPA on Selebi

Jackie Mapiloko, City Press, 7 October 2007

THE National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is in a fix over how to proceed with cases involving Glenn Agliotti and how they must be related to the case against police commissioner Jackie Selebi.

City Press has learnt that there was &quot;an in principle agreement&quot; between the NPA and Agliotti's lawyer. As a result, information and evidence relating to Agliotti and Selebi was exchanged.

Now a source says the NPA wants to pull out, but is in a fix on how to use Agliotti's &quot;confessions&quot; in its possession.

A source said Vusi Pikoli had given Gerrie Nel, the Scorpions Gauteng head, the go-ahead to enter into negotiations and exchange information with Agliotti's lawyers with a view to giving him a Section 204 witness status. At the end of this, the court will decide whether he should be granted immunity.

&quot;My information is that Agliotti has given the Scorpions valuable information about Selebi. Affidavits have been signed. Pikoli was supposed to endorse these, but was suspended before this could happen.

&quot;I understand the fix is that 'Cocky' (acting NPA head Mokotedi Mpshe) has told Nel he does not believe Agliotti - who could face a total of 45 years behind bars for his crimes - should be given immunity for all these crimes. Mpshe's attitude is that a balance must be found and Leonard McCarthy agrees with him.&quot; The source said Mpshe had told the NPA management that he did not see how Agliotti should be let off the hook for his involvement in the R250 million hashish smuggling ring for which he faces charges in the Alberton Magistrates' Court. Agliotti was given the name &quot;the Landlord&quot; for the extensive, international ring that linked Iran, Lisbon, Holland and Swaziland.

Agliotti's drugs trial will start at the Germiston Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.

The source said: &quot;Mpshe's attitude is that if you want to make a deal with Agliotti on his involvement in the Kebble/Selebi saga in pursuit of Selebi, that's fine. But the hashish matter must be treated separately.&quot; The problem is that the &quot;in principle agreement&quot; covered both.

When Agliotti's case was postponed at the Johannesburg Magistrates' Court on Friday, Nel said this was only because the NPA was trying to extradite John Stratton - believed to be behind Kebble's &quot;assisted suicide&quot; - from Australia.

Nel refused to comment outside court on whether Agliotti had turned state witness. He said: &quot;He is an accused in this case and he and John Stratton will stand trial for murder.&quot;

A source said Nel's stance was meant to prepare the public if Mpshe remained steadfast in his position that Agliotti should also face the music.

This came as NPA spokesperson Tlali Tlali confirmed on Friday that Mpshe had cancelled a warrant for the arrest of Selebi and failed to secure the cancellation of the search warrants. This was the first official confirmation of the existence of the warrant. Tlali said Mpshe decided to review the case against Selebi.

&quot;There is a review process that will soon be under way. For that reason, we are reluctant to pronounce on this matter,&quot; he said. Asked how the review of Selebi's case related to Agliotti, Tlali said, &quot;they may seem to be separate issues, but we do not rule out the possibility that they may be ruled by the panel to have a connection&quot;.

Tlali said a statement would be released &quot;soon&quot; on the composition of the panel. Asked if the panel would comprise NPA staffers, he said: &quot;All those details will be in the statement.&quot;

Earlier in the week, Tlali confirmed the investigation into Selebi.

He said Mpshe would pronounce on the matter as soon as it was finalised. City Press reported last week that it was how Pikoli had handled the investigation and his threats to arrest Justice Minister Brigitte Mabandla that had led Mbeki to suspend him.

Meanwhile, Gauteng Education MEC Angie Motshekga has denied that Mbeki had sent her to ask Pikoli to resign two weeks ago.

She admitted meeting Pikoli, but said it was to discuss other issues.

4.6 The main 'stingers' in the drama

City Press, 7 October 2007

LEONARD McCARTHY is deputy national director of public prosecutions. Appointed by President Thabo Mbeki, he was made head of the Directorate of Special Operations (DSO), also known as the Scorpions, in 2003.

As its head, McCarthy provides the necessary strategic and operational leadership in directing the work of its more than 500 members. He is a graduate of the University of Cape Town and Unisa. A source says McCarthy has ambitions to become head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) after Pikoli. He has access to Mbeki and is close to Deputy Justice Minister Johnny de Lange. &quot;The weakness against McCarthy is that he is not told everything by Gerrie Nel, one of the most powerful figures in the Scorpions. So his ability to influence things in his unit is limited to what he knows, which is controlled by Nel and Andrew Leask,&quot; said a source.

THANDA MNGWENGWE an advocate, was appointed head of operations for the Scorpions last June. He replaced Geoff Ledwaba who resigned after allegations of missing money from the Scorpions' informer fund. He was in his acting capacity when he ordered the 2005 raid on Zuma's home in which Scorpions members and ANC deputy president Zuma's bodyguards had a standoff. Evidence collected from the house was returned to Zuma because of technical defects in the search-and-seizure operation.

GERRIE NEL is a former policeman. It is not clear which police unit he worked for before studying law and then joining the Scorpions as its Gauteng head. The Scorpions' Gauteng political boundaries include Limpopo and Mpumalanga. Most of the major controversial cases handled by the Scorpions fall under his jurisdiction. The Tony Yengeni bribery case, the Ngoako Ramatlhodi fraud case, the Mac Maharaj corruption case and the case against Selebi are examples of the cases under his command.

ANDREW LEASK is a former policeman and the chief of special investigations in the Scorpions. He worked for the Scorpions as an investigator in the Western Cape and raided the premises of International Intelligence Risk Management which was suspected of recruiting mercenaries. He investigated the R250 million drug case against Glenn Agliotti, Stephanos Paparas, his father, Dimitrio, and Stanley Poonin. He also probed the murder of Brett Kebble in which Agliotti was arrested and charged. Agliotti is said to have given information to the prosecution to be used against police commissioner Jackie Selebi. Leask also interviewed John Stratton who is fighting an attempted extradition from Australia to face charges of Kebble's murder with Agliotti. Leask had investigated the disappearance of Rocks Dlamini of Soweto before joining the NPA.

ADRIAN MOPP is the former head of the Asset Forfeiture Unit in the Western Cape. He was appointed head of Scorpions in the province after Dawood Adam was appointed head of the Witness Protection Unit. He headed the investigation into Travelgate. Mopp is also leading the investigation into the collapse and misappropriation of funds of Fidentia. The Scorpions also nabbed the chief executive of the Transport Education and Training Authority (Teta), Piet Bothma, after Teta invested R246 million in Fidentia. He also headed the probe into the collapse of Leisurenet, the owners of the now- defunct Health and Racquet Health clubs.

4.7 Justice must be blind

Khathu Mamaila, City Press, 7 October 2007

IT WAS never going to be easy. Even if the liberation movement, in its non-sectarian form, had marched to Pretoria and defeated the white power structure, it would still have not been an easy task to build credible state institutions loyal to the new Constitution.

It was worse in our case because our freedom was the product of a compromise.

The apartheid state machinery was tampered with, never demolished.

We saw the freedom fighters - Umkhonto we Sizwe and Azanian People's Liberation Army members - being assimilated into the South African Defence Force to form the South African National Defence Force.

Some guerrillas made peace with their former enemies and remained in the defence force but others left, citing racism and victimisation.

There was an acceleration programme in the judiciary, appointing black judges in an effort to give credibility to a system that until April 1994 enforced apartheid with vigour.

In order for the new government to enjoy credibility and legitimacy, ordinary people had to have faith in the judiciary.

Without this, you have a crisis. Justice and vengeance are seen as one and the same thing. Legal prosecution is seen as persecution.

And despite the fact that some progress has been made in transforming the judiciary, the unpalatable truth is that the judiciary and law-enforcement agencies - including intelligence - are still dominated by people who served apartheid. And that many of them are white, compounds the problem further.

Little wonder then that every time a senior ANC leader has a problem with the law, he or she receives public sympathy and support from a section of those who fought for freedom. For some, they see the prosecution of liberation heroes - Tony Yengeni, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Robert McBride, Jacob Zuma and others - as a continuation of the apartheid junta's agenda.

They see it as part of a campaign by those who owe their loyalty to the old order to vilify anti-apartheid heroes.

The common charge is that the NPA is targeting ANC leaders. This is premised on the conclusion that the law-enforcement agencies have not yet been transformed.

But unless the Scorpions' detractors can produce irrefutable proof that the prosecuted ANC leaders had been framed by whites with a racist agenda, they have no case.

In fact, it can be argued that what is required is a bureaucrat whose decision will not be based on political consideration, but by a quest to uphold the Constitution.

However, unless there is a sense that law-enforcement agencies serve the people, without fear or favour, and that those pursued by the law are not victims of malice, or political agendas, there will be a crisis of law. Not all white people serving in the security forces want to undermine the democratically elected government.

Some are so committed to protecting the new order that they put their lives at risk. Without going into details, it was white security officers who infiltrated the Boeremag which led to the exposure of an alleged coup plot and acts of sabotage against the democratic state.

The real challenge is to avoid stereotypes. There are bureaucrats who are honest people wanting to do their job to the best of their ability. But there are also others who are angry with the new order and may derive pleasure in contributing to the fall of a struggle hero.

But perhaps the struggle hero should know better and stay away from crime and corruption to disarm those wishing his or her downfall.

The point is that there is a need to build credible state institutions loyal to the Constitution and not to a political party or a supreme leader.

For now, we are saddled with bureaucracy that does not enjoy the confidence of many ordinary people. And because of this, those pursued by the law become national heroes.

5.1 Revolutionary socialist sets his sails to the business wind

Chris Barron, Sunday Times, 7 October 2007

Cunningham Ngcukana: Business development director for Investec Asset Management

Former Apla fighter and committed Africanist sees no contradictions in his new job, writes Chris Barron
Investec is precisely the kind of symbolic target that Cunningham Ngcukana, senior operative of the Azanian People's Liberation Army, would have blown up 20 years ago if given half a chance, one suspects. Now, as a newly appointed boss in the investment bank's asset management division, he can't sing its praises highly enough.

Are his new colleagues the kind of guys he'd have taken out?

Ngcukana considers his answer carefully.

&quot;We were ready to kill or be killed if necessary, but no revolutionary in his right mind enjoys the loss of human life. In Apla we never enjoyed the spilling of blood.&quot;

He is still an uncompromising Africanist and member of the Pan Africanist Congress, whose rallying cry &quot;one settler, one bullet&quot; gave the impression long after 1994 that the fewer whites around the better.

&quot;As an Africanist I've always been a nonracialist,&quot; he says.

Contrary to &quot;the political malcontents who have given a racist interpretation to Africanism&quot;, it is in fact a nonracial philosophy that &quot;regards as Africans everybody who lives in Africa and accepts Africa as their home&quot;.

How will he fit into an environment that one disgruntled young black Investec employee described in a highly publicised letter earlier this year as discriminatory against blacks?

Ngcukana, who was working as a consultant for Investec at the time and is familiar with the facts, says the young man's experience was less about racism or discrimination than &quot;a question of expectations mismatched with reality&quot;.

The &quot;beneficiaries of transformation&quot; can't expect to become bosses overnight, he says. &quot;There are ladders that need to be climbed.&quot;

President Thabo Mbeki used Bonga Bangani's letter to take a swipe at Investec in his weekly online letter and suddenly the company was seen to be weak on transformation.

Ngcukana, who was deputy director-general in the President's office a few years ago, gives a wry chuckle.

&quot;If the president of a country writes about an issue you take note of it, but you also ask yourself questions. Why select this issue when even in the Presidency there are poor labour relations?&quot;

Has his appointment got anything to do with Investec wanting to correct its image?

&quot;I don't believe that Investec has a need to correct its image.&quot;

There must have been pressure on it to make more senior black appointments, surely?

&quot;Investec does not need pressure to appoint more black people,&quot; he says. &quot;Investec is committed to transformation.&quot;

After Apla, Ngcukana became one of the most powerful trade unionists in post-1994 South Africa as general secretary of the National Council of Trade Unions.

Does his appointment as business development director for Investec Asset Management signal a more aggressive strategy to woo union business?

&quot;Any corporate business continuously reviews its strategies and seeks to align its internal capabilities and resources to fit with the external environment.&quot;

Is this a &quot;yes&quot;?

&quot;We will be looking for business everywhere, but of course union business is an important part of our business.&quot;

Nevertheless, his arrival is &quot;not a question of bringing in union clients but about understanding their environment and the thinking of the unions&quot;. He says he has not budged from his socialist, pro-worker views but sees no contradiction between these and the capitalist, pro-business line of his new masters.

&quot;One of the key criticisms of socialism was its failure to understand financial markets. As a socialist it's been quite a learning curve for me, but no conflict. &quot;

What about the anti-business rhetoric he spouted as a unionist?
&quot;The unions are not anti- business. They are anti certain practices carried out by business.&quot;

What about Cosatu's argument (he confesses he's a great fan of Cosatu boss Zwelinzima Vavi) that the government's pro-business policies do nothing for the poor?

&quot;It is not about being pro- poor or pro-business&quot;, he says. It is about understanding &quot;that macroeconomic management is not about fiscal and monetary policy alone. Fiscal and monetary policy is a small part of it. Macroeconomic policy is about job creation, industrial policy, trade policy, redistribution, effective public service.

&quot;There is no use for Trevor Manuel to engage in theatrics in Parliament, saying he has got a surplus, when the hospitals are in a very sorry mess or when we have got almost 40% unemployment. &quot;

As for unions being anti- privatisation, they're not.

All they want is for parastatals to play a bigger developmental role. In Ngcukana's opinion, the likes of Telkom, Eskom, the Development Bank, the Industrial Development Corporation and SAA are &quot;all personal fiefdoms&quot; run by incompetents and contributing little or nothing to economic growth.

What about private financial institutions like Investec? Should they play a more developmental role with the billions of union money at their disposal?

&quot;That would depend on the mandate we receive from our clients. We serve our clients. If they say in the selection of our equities we need to have stocks that promote sustainability, good labour practices, HIV/Aids policies et cetera , but still give returns ... we believe we can work with unions on that.&quot;

He believes that unions should play a bigger developmental role through their investment arms, but are hampered because of &quot;differences&quot; between the trustees of these investment funds and union leadership.

&quot;Trustees of union funds look only at performance of the portfolio,&quot; he explains.

Surely the workers whose money it is should thank them for this? &quot;Investment is not only about performance.&quot;

Social criteria are more important than returns?

Social criteria &quot;should not mean no or low returns&quot;, he answers quickly.

Ngcukana, 47, was born in Soweto, schooled in the Eastern Cape and expelled from Fort Hare university in 1980 for political and underground activities. He continued to work underground as a military operative for Apla and claims he helped establish &quot;one of the best underground and intelligence networks&quot; in the country. He was involved in &quot;recruiting, receiving and directing comrades&quot; for the armed struggle.

&quot;There were many things that would have got me hanged.&quot; Fortunately, although detained and tried several times, there was never sufficient evidence against him.

Had the security police been better at their jobs he would not be joining the rush-hour traffic to Sandton every morning.

He allows himself a sombre laugh.
