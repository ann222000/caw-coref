As copied from another forum here is the response from Yamaha in reply
to a question about speedometer accuracy, or the lack there of.
Without doing the math I am not convinced their explanation is valid.

*********************************************************
Good afternoon:

This is an issue that we as a manufacture have looked into. There are
really two separate issues:

1. speedometer readings can be optimistic

2. the odometer reading is &quot;out&quot; meaning the reading (at the time
taken) is recording a larger distance than actually travelled.

1. Every speedometer installed on every motor vehicle is optimistic
because
a) as a tire wears, it becomes smaller in diameter and revolves
faster. At the far end of the wear scale, we would not want to err on
the side of pessimistic and become the cause of an accident or a
speeding violation.

2. As stated previously, the tires wear and become smaller and so the
distance travelled per revolution becomes less. Most of the time the
odometer is calibrated to be (approximately) correct at about 50% wear
with correct tire pressure. Additionally, tire slip ratio must be
accounted for, so these things all prevent any vehicle from having a
totally correct odometer reading.

These issues have never been a concern in the past as there was no
true and relatively easy method for owners of vehicles to confirm
speed and distance. This can be easily confirmed by GPS signal with
the new technologies, however it should be noted that many of the
signals from the satellites do have error &quot;built in&quot; to prevent
pinpoint accuracy of homing devices.

Finally, we have produced these parts to be as accurate as possible
given the design of them and they do comply with existing expectations
of accuracy. Eventually, when the technology and cost considerations
allow, we may start to see changes made to vehicles that show speed
and distance calculated from GPS signals, but first we would have to
ensure the signals are clear at every point and not lose them as we do
now under cloud cover or in tunnels etc.

Regards,

Scott

Either it's a load of crap or they are admitting they can't calibrate
a simple device as well as any car, truck or some other brands of
motorcycles on the road.

Yup. And as proof that both odometers and speedometers *can* be designed to
read quite accurately should the manufacturer actually wish to do so, one
need not look past the KTM 650 Adventure I owned until a few years ago.

KTM claimed it came with the same odo/speedo as their factory rally bikes,
and it probably did; as both speedo and odo were absolutely dead-bang
accurate as it came out of the box, and both odo and speedo were adjustable
as well, in case you wanted to mount tires with diameters that differed from
the factory issue.

So Yamaha's claim that they &quot;build them as accurate as possible&quot; is pure
bullshit given that your average Japanese motorcycle's speedo reads
somewhere between seven and ten percent high.

(Note: my Honda VFR's speedo always reads around 7% higher than my actual
speed -this confirmed by a friendly CHP who clocked me up to 50 MPH and then
beeped at me when I reached it. I've never bothered to check the odometer's
accuracy.)

It's crap.  Of course the speedo reads high because they want to shave a
few thousand miles off the warranty period.  Some vehicle manufacturers
have been caught doing the same thing.

Nice try there.   The deliberate error, called Selective Availability, was
turned off in May of 2000.  GPS speed readings should be accurate to within 1
mph at typical ground vehicle speeds (assuming good satellite reception).

Huh? As a tire wears and becomes smaller in diameter, it does not rotate
faster if you ride at the same speed as indicated by the speedometer. Your
actual speed decreases due to the reduced diameter. I have compared my
speedometer to a GPS for a while now and it becomes more optimistic as the
tire wears. Replacing the tire makes the speedometer more accurate for a
while. This might be more noticeable on a motorcycle, like my 919, that has
the speedometer sensor on the countershaft. Rear tires wear fairly fast on
this bike. At the same time, the odometer seems very accurate so why can't
they calibrate the speedometer a little closer? My speedometer reads about
9% high and so do our other two Hondas and so did my Hinckley Triumph.
Several people I know have newer Harleys and they have accurate
speedometers.

What they didn't mention was that accuracy of a motorcycle
speedo changes depending on whether the bike is leaned
over or upright, as the effective diameter of the wheel changes
when the bike is leaned.

I went through this exercise a while back with a bicycle speedo.
After a while, it occurred to me that calibration was going to
vary somewhat with the road.

The part about optimism/pessimism with tire wear is exactly
backwards, as others have pointed out.

Buy a Sigma bike speedo and calibrate it however you like.

I have found the HD product to be relatively accurate, as is my car
and company truck.

While we are hearing several good reasons for the speedometer error
factor, some unique to motorcycles, none justify the 9% error I see on
my Venture. 9% seems to be more the norm than the exception with most
metrics.

On my bike, the odometer is accurate and the speedo
is optimistic. After futzing with the Sigma for a few days
after I got it, I realized that bikes had some built in
inaccuracies for any device based on wheel rotations.

I like the Sigma both for reasonably the accurate speed
readings and also because it's nice to have the other
features such as clock and second trip odometer.

I may eventually break down and buy a GPS, but haven't
gotten there yet.

The popular BMW explanation for an optimistic speedo is
that they're required by local law to have a non-pessimistic
speed reading and err on the side of optimism. (So you
don't accidentally exceed speed limits ?)

I can see that. The point about wheel rotation being different when

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;LOL! Accurate as possible. So Yamaha thinks we're all stupid!
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;What a flippin' load of crap that was! :-)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Either it's a load of crap or they are admitting they can't calibrate
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a simple device as well as any car, truck or some other brands of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; motorcycles on the road.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;What they didn't mention was that accuracy of a motorcycle
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;speedo changes depending on whether the bike is leaned
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;over or upright, as the effective diameter of the wheel changes
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;when the bike is leaned.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I went through this exercise a while back with a bicycle speedo.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;After a while, it occurred to me that calibration was going to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;vary somewhat with the road.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The part about optimism/pessimism with tire wear is exactly
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;backwards, as others have pointed out.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Buy a Sigma bike speedo and calibrate it however you like.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I use a GPS and ride comfortable knowing how fast I am going.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have heard of the Sigma before and it's not a bad idea to use one,
&gt; &gt;&gt; if you tend to push to the limit, the tolerances of the local traffic
&gt; &gt;&gt; enforcement.

&gt; &gt;On my bike, the odometer is accurate and the speedo
&gt; &gt;is optimistic. After futzing with the Sigma for a few days
&gt; &gt;after I got it, I realized that bikes had some built in
&gt; &gt;inaccuracies for any device based on wheel rotations.

&gt; I can see that. The point about wheel rotation being different when
&gt; leaned into a corner is well taken.

&gt; &gt;I like the Sigma both for reasonably the accurate speed
&gt; &gt;readings and also because it's nice to have the other
&gt; &gt;features such as clock and second trip odometer.

&gt; Surprising the little extras we want on our bikes.

&gt; &gt;I may eventually break down and buy a GPS, but haven't
&gt; &gt;gotten there yet.

Not so strange.  The KZ1000P is a police bike after all.

And they put accurate speedometers on police vehicles so they can
accurately ignore the speed limit wherever they go. :)

The BMW error is very similar to Yamahas.
Hard to figure out why 9-10% though.

For a cable driven speedo, I wonder if an extra
magnet(s) placed on the side of the speedo might
offset the optimism. If so, could it do it accurately ?
I'll have to play with that idea some time.

I've also heard it suggested that tapping on the end of
the center spinning magnet might move it slightly further
from the metal part that it deflects. Experiments on a
speedometer which involve hammers sound a little
risky though.

Actually, on mine the analog speedo is optimistic and the

the error is often in the analog stuff.

Only problem is their device only works with electronic speedometers,
not the mechanical type with the spinning magnet and aluminum cup.
Also, you can get the odometer or the speedometer corrected,
but not both.  Since in my experience most odometers are accurate to
within about 1%, and speedometers are almost always off from 5 to 10%,
the speedometer error is obviously deliberate.

This wasn't always the case.  My '81 CB900C and '81 CM400T both had
85 mph Joan Claybrook Special speedometers and they were remarkably
accurate.  The EX250 speedometer (but not the odometer) is off by
almost 11%.  That is why there is a Sigma BC800 mounted on it.

Just 'cause they got cheap and went with a friggin' lousy gear-and-cable
setup.

The CA CHP had to quit writing tickets when they first got their R1100RT-P
bikes because the speedo's were so far off.  Then they came up with a better
&quot;Patrol Speedometer&quot; in '97.

BMW's newer bikes with the electronic speed sensor does a far better job.
