Subject says it all.  Discussion in the Mechancal Vario thread led to
some suggesting that I should get an antique Piep Audio vario that
would plumb in with my current mechanical vario.  I think they are
right, sounds like just what I need.  Anyone have one laying around
they want to part with?

If you can't find one,  (or it turns out to be expensive) you might
try the Mallettec audio vario advertised in Soaring ($169.00).  I have
one (sort of) and used it extensively when flying our club
Schweitzers.  I loaned it to a very experienced guy in our club, and
he uses it all the time, and seems to like it. I broke my first one,
and the manufacturer replaced it for free.

I have one in my newly acquired Ka-8, and one in my
spares drawer.  Sorry, but it is going to go to one
of my clubs ships sometime soon.

RICO also made a stand-alone like the PIEP.  You might
see if he has any left.  Probably doesn't , but it
would be worth a call or e-mail.  And I have plans
for one from the 1960s.  If you like, I can send you
the article.  This one was developed by the Akaflieg
Stuttgart, so it must be good!  I know it worked well,
as I flew with one of these and a Winter in a long
winged Cherokee (The Annebula, pictured in the most
recent sailplane directory as the Cherokee picture).
Got my Diamond Goal/Gold Distance in that ship.  Ah,
the fun of those days!  If you find someone that is
an old hand to electronics, he can probably design
you a circuit to do the same thing that our homebuilt
ones did.

Interesting Steve, was the Cherokee you flew an RM?  44 foot span,
NACA airfoil? or something altogether different?  Ive got an extra
foot of span than the plans call for and the D tube goes back to the
second spar so I like to tell myself that that gives me some extra
performance.

I may contact you for those plans if no Pieps or similar show up.  Im
currently working at Rockwell Collins so ive got thousands of
electronics wizards at my disposal, I think I could manage to figure
it out.

I think that the Mallettecs don't have a hose barb for static - if
that's true, you can't plumb a TE probe into it. I prefer audios to be
compensated, they are much more useful that way.

I'll see what Piep stuff I have left in the garage. I think I have a
broken one, it might be fixable or yield parts for another one.

Thanks, Bob K.

The Mallettec is very quiet. In the 1-26 I clip it to my hat in such a way
that it rests on my ears, otherwise I wouldn't be able to hear it. In a
better-sealed ship you could probably put it a *little* farther away, but
I think it would still have to be on your person somewhere, so that
connecting a hose to it would likely be impractical no matter what.

Even without TE compensation it's still much better than no audio,
especially in a 1-26 where the transition from cruise to thermalling speed
is short. I can see where compensation would be much handier in something
hat won't bleed off the energy so fast though.

bob you are right about the Mallettecs not having TE capability.  Look
forward to hearing what you have, maybe I can Frankenstein a few of
them into a workable unit.  thanks!

Well, drat. The box I thought had a Piep in it actually contains the
four or so separate modules of an ancient Hornig electric vario
system. And some correspondence between Graham Thompson and Charles
Drew, who appears to have been the original purchaser. Charlie built
an HP-11 (N1954), and later I think an HP-18.

There's one more box of old instruments up at the shop, if you send me
a reminder email next Friday I'll check that next weekend.

Thanks, Bob K.
