Reboot on The Stock Market

By Stirling Newberry
Created Mar 14 2007 - 10:49am

A few months ago, only a few people were grumbling about the complacency of
the stock market and global markets in general. There were worries that the
Japanese carry trade would end - that's borrowing cheap money from Japan and
speculating with it, or parking it and collecting the difference - and about
the low rates of hedging against disaster - the way to measure that is the
difference between risky loans and safe ones, called "the spread", the
smaller the "spread" the less you are paid for risking money more, and
therefore the more complacent people are.

On one hand, there is no reason to panic. On the other hand, there are lots
of reasons to feel queasy, because George W. Bush, trust me, has done for
the world financial system what he has done for Iraq.

Let me start from the small picture and work outwards. The small picture is
that you are a sheep that is shorn. Every year you put your money into the
markets at relatively predictable times through those mutual funds which are
defrauding you of your fees in return for subpar performance. Every year the
smart money waits for you, in your millions, to herd yourselves in for the
slaughter, trying to buy stuff before you do, so that they can sell it to
you at a profit, and then get out for the year. Then, somewhere between July
and November - it varies by year - the smart money lays the next ambush for
your 401k plan.

This is the 2006-2007 rendition of "the smart money is getting out, and
watching the dumb money stay in." [1] Every year, you buy at the top and if
you panic, sell at the bottom. This is why your 401k plan underperforms the
market statistically speaking.

Therefore, while the blood is flowing early this year, there is no reason,
because of the stock drop themselves, to panic. It's a normal process. The
question is how far down is it going to go, and is it going to rebound on
the other side. Let's face it, if this is merely an slaughtering of the
lambs, the worse thing you can do is sell now. Instead, better to wait, buy
at the bottom, and then sell at the top. Last year I told people to wait,
and then to buy the Shanghai at 1600, and it almost doubled from there. Last
year's sell off was sharp, but it was also the result of hot money, not
underlying forces.

So let's take one step back to look at the medium picture. The economic
cycle. Because while this seasonal buy and sell is normal, how big the sell,
and how big they buy are, depend, not on the stampedes of 401k money and
other micro-effects, but on how long the economic cycle has to run, and the
oceans of consumer and investment money. In a phrase, the yearly cycle is at
the margins - people selling or not selling, people buying or not buying.
But what that yearly cycle looks like depends on whether there is a stream
of money to support the whole market. The crash years of 2000 and 2002 were
perfectly ordinary in their sell in spring and buy in fall - it's just that
the spring to summer sales were massive, and the buy backs were anemic. 2003
was a good year for US stocks, because Bush finally resolved uncertainty
about Iraq, and allowed federal stimulus to flow, the buy back started
early, and went well for the rest of 2003.

In short, the small picture says that this could just be a sale on stocks,
and that it is time to wait, pick your targets, and buy at the bottom. But
what that bottom is, and what happens next, isn't the small picture any
more. It is a bet on where the money is coming from.

So what is the medium picture?

-:-

The medium picture, is not so good.

A business cycle has parts, each one is really shaped by what people are
doing to make money. The two meatiest part of the business cycle are the
rebound - when stimulus comes in to pick the economy up off the floor, and
the expansion, when whatever new kind of business is going to be the story
of the expansion is established, and people pour into it to make money.
There is also the frothy "bubble" where most of the money is being made
making big, speculative, bets on what assets are going to be important for a
long time, and which, because of the frothy amount of money, are up for
sale. You might ask why assets are for sale at the top, and why buy them
there, the answer is that only at the top is there enough money to entice
the hardened owners of long term rents to sell out.

Our rebound, such as it was, was driven by Iraq spending starting in early
2003, and our expansion was driven by housing, health care and homeland
security. Low. Low. Low. Low interest rates from the federal reserve, a
captive American market that has to pay double digit inflation of health
care, and the war without end. Housing isn't a bad thing, but we don't put
houses on boats and sell them. Health care is a good thing, but is it wise
to have 1/3 of all health care dollars evaporate on private overhead? And we
don't sell that much health care to the rest of the world. And war? Well we
all know that war is only profitable for the people not fighting it, but
selling the weapons. And this war has been a dud on the international
market. The first Iraq War, actually turned a small profit. Seriously, other
people paid us to fight it. Which is why we did what they wanted, and not
what we wanted.

However, the housing sector, as it went along, stopped selling bigger houses
to people with good jobs, but speculation to people who had less and less
money. Just as little people played the market in the dotconomy, little
people tried to flip homes in front of the rush. This begat the mother of
all sub-prime speculative booms.

Sub-prime means "risky". There is nothing wrong with making risky loans, so
long as the person making them knows that they will have to make up the
difference. However, very often the game is to find a way to make the risky
loan, and have the government clean up the mess when there is a recession.
This was the S&amp;L scandal. People like the Chimp's brother made bad loans,
and you are still paying off the difference in the form of the debt we took
on as a country to clean the mess up and get moving again. If you ask
yourself why the very people who messed up Texas were, a few years later,
running the place, and then the country - well that's a story beyond the
financial picture.

Sub-prime borrowers then, go broke alot even during the boom, but when the
bust comes, they get creamed. All at once. At this point the bankers step in
and say "no more of that, we want our money back". This means that
speculative demand dries up. But that speculative demand was driving housing
prices in general.

From this medium term picture - you can see how people, big and small, bet
there was going to be a 1990's money flows like water bubble at the end to
square the books of the housing market. There was such a boom, but not for
little people. Instead, that boom took place at the top of the economy, in
Private Equity and Hedge Funds. More on this in a moment.

But the point of the story here is that all the little people who bet that
we were going to see hiring and more wages, got it wrong wrong wrong wrong
wrong wrong wrong. This means that the housing bust isn't going to be
limited to a few high flying lenders like New Century, but is hammering
everyone everywhere, because the source of demand for the houses being
built - people getting really good jobs and moving into the suburbs from
cramped apartments - isn't happening. No jobs, no houses, no houses, no one
to sell to. Since the flow of people wanting to retire and move south and
sell their home near an economic center hasn't changed, the fact that there
is no one to sell to means that they either have to stay put, or take a
lower price. Now home prices are still high, but they are way off their
peaks. This means that lots of these people will sell now, hoping to avoid
the bottom.

So the sub-prime bust becomes a more general bust [2] that ripples through
the economy, particularly in spring when the rehiring of construction
workers doesn't happen.

So let's look at the streams of money that were driving the expansion.
Housing? Gone. Health care? People are topped out. Homeland Security? Peaked
and going down, particularly when the bail out from housing starts to come
due, and Congress looks to cut something. Private equity boom? Most of the
borrowing power of the S&amp;P 500 is now tapped out, and there is very little
money on the sidelines based on cash flows. Almost every rich person who
wanted into the hedge fund pool, is in.

So the money is drying up [3]. It hasn't dried up, but it is drying up.

This middle picture means that not only will this slide be sharp, but the
rebound on the otherside is going to be less. And the odds on a recession
this year or next are getting higher, not lower, by the day. Some of this
was in place last year.

However, last year, as the bust was starting, business was spending -
mergers, acquisitions, commericial real estate - all boomed. However this
was a bubble. It wasn't a leaner and meaner economy coming out of creative
destruction - that's econospeak for "lots of little people losing their
jobs, but the company is more efficient" - but a bloated one, with the
highest share of wealth owned by the top 1% since 1929.

This private equity bubble propped up the economy, building offices, selling
equipment to an expanding China and India, and the last fat shot of war
spending from an undivided government of Republicans and a President whose
only veto was to outlaw biology.

This gets us to the big picture. The reasons to believe that while this may
not be the crash year, it also might be. The reasons to believe that if the
crash comes, it will be far wider than people expect.

-:-

The big picture, paradoxically, doesn't depend on big aggregates. The
history of 20th century economics is that the aggregate numbers always look
best before the crash. Over and over again recessions have taken economists
by suprise, and each time they have come up with a raft of new "effects" to
explain them - the wealth effect, sunspots etc.

The reality is that it is not the aggregate, but the composition of the
aggregate, that determines what happens when things go sour. The web of
connections. Now economists admit this about the past - the Great
Depression, it is understood, came from the unravelling of a web of
interconnections. The very biggest scale is determined, not by sloshing
aggregates, but by the turbulence of risk and volatility. This is because
how bad the down turn, and how durable the upturn, depend, not on how much
money is floating around, but by whether people are acting out of
desperation to save their economic lives, or just their lives period - and
conversely, whether they are making merely a good short term decision, or
hoping that a new country or new industry is someplace they can make a life.

This is why people like Stuart Holland have argued for "meso" economics. But
let's leave the theory aside, and talk about some solid facts on the big
picture.

The first solid fact is that the US economy has an energy dependency, and we
import lots and lots of it. The second fact is that we use a lot of this
imported energy , not for growth, but to maintain the value of what we own.
Your house doesn't get any closer to your job, you must burn gas every
commuting day to keep the house. So must all your neighbors. This means that
one big reason for the price of oil going up over the last 10 years, has
been that people have been paying rent at the gas pump, so that they could
avoid paying more for their house. With housing prices going up, even if
wages weren't really, people could still pay the price of gas. That is why
it is almost certain that gas this year will hit $3 gallon. I don't usually
call out James K. Galbraith for being dead wrong, but in this case, he was
dead wrong - he thought that the inflation spike was all Katrina. Wrong.
Wrong. Wrong - Katrina merely laid bare how delicate the situation was.

The second solid fact is that the US is a disinflation junky as well. This
is like someone on uppers and downers. The oil gets us up! But that means
inflation, and since Social Security is Indexed to Inflation, that would eat
us out of house and home. That's why the late 1970's were creating lots of
pressure on social security - because we are on the hook for inflation. We
import disinflation from lots of places. China is the poster child, but
there are two dozen nations whose livelihood is being a cheaper, and often
more efficient, place to manufacture. The average Japanese worker uses half
the energy of the average American worker to produce the same amount of GDP.
We ship jobs from here, to various theres, because either the standards are
lower, the manufacturing more efficient, or both.

The third solid fact is that the US must then find someway of buying this
oil and disinflation. We used to make both right here. We used to have
enough oil, and we used to be the place that was building super concentrated
more efficient manufacturing, and high pressure academic research. We do
less and less of all three. So we must either sell off pieces of the future
to someone else - and that is the national debt people, how much of your
future you just sold to fill up your car - or we must loot smaller countries
that don't have a choice.

This last causes its own problems - because countries whose assets we are
buying up, and using to pay for our gas and disinflation, don't get rich.
And you know something? America's best exports are for countries with large
middle classes. Other people make luxury goods as well as we do, and other
countries make cheap stuff better, but the US is at its best when it is
selling to a large active middle class. But no development, no middle class.
And China is dead set on keeping its own middle class happy by itself. Thank
you very much.

The global trade order - which is "free" in the same sense that "Operation
Iraqi Freedom" is free - is based on the American need to scrounge up the
money. The black triangle of global trade is the US buying oil from OPEC,
and shipping the carbon polluting parts of its economy to China, and
squeezing the rest of the world for the difference, and selling its children
into debt slavery for what it can't extort from smaller nations. If you
wonder why the US isn't as popular as it used to be - look at it this way,
we used to export cleavage, Coca-Cola and color television to the rest of
the world, now we export Dominionist Revolution and pillage economies. The
third richest guy in the world is the guy who bought up Mexico's telephone
system, and is charging ruinously high rates so he can leverage into other
things. Free Trade? Addicts are never free.

This is putting a strain on the global monetary order. If you think about
it, global warming is the way that the inefficient but hopped up on oil
economies - Dubai, Shanghai and Houston being the poster childern - dump the
cost on the rest of the world. If you count the cost of global warming and
health effects, China's value add to the rest of the world is negative.

This is held together by slicing and dicing risk and spreading it over as
large an area as possible, and particularly by sticking people with it who
don't know they are stuck with it. The City of New Orleans was stuck with
the risk of a mega storm, and didn't know it. The National Guardsmen were
stuck with the risk of a back door draft, and didn't know it. Industrial
workers were stuck with the risk that courts would allow their pensions to
be pillaged, and didn't know it. There is an econo-speak word for this kind
of risk "systematic risk". Systematic risk is risk that something will come
back and bite you in the ass.

You are supposed to get paid for this risk. However, most ordinary people
aren't.

Now think on something. Where does the money for all those high flying
speculative ventures come from? Ultimately it comes from ordinary people who
do the work. I love finance, finance can do wonderful things. But let's not
forget the reality that it is only a way of focusing the efforts of
millions - billions - of real people on real problems. When it does not do
this, it is a burden, not a blessing. And it has been a bigger and bigger
burden.

The result of all this cross spreading of risk is that no one really knows
which piece of the risk they own. It's all been homogenized. Now, what
happens when people get homogenized? Well, it isn't pretty. When things go
bad, someone has to step in - a government - and put things on the right
track. Basically, if business people have gotten the path from ordinary work
to profits so tangled that no one can untangle it, the public, which is
those ordinary people, has to step in, cut the tangle, separate the quick
from the economic dead, and pay the difference.

This can be good or bad, depending on how wise the public's servants are
when it happens. In 1981 and 1990, the public got a bad deal, and in 2001 we
got the raw deal. Each time the rich were bailed out, and the rest of us
stuck with the bill.

However, what happens when the tangle gets too big? Then things get strange.
Some governments may decide to walk away from the table. Others will be
overthrown. Some will try and put the boot down and bail out the rich
anyway - and spiral everything out of control.

Is this the economic crisis that could start either a massively bad bail
out, or worse a downward spiral? The level of public debt, the level of
interconnection of financial services - and worse still, the fact that many
resources are being extracted at peak capacity - indicates that the world
isn't living within its means. Globally we've had the biggest boom in
history, because many places that had been outside of the mechanized
economy - doing things with muscle rather than machine - have been brought
into that economy. However, that means that the oil, upon which everything
else rests, is now squeezed to its limit.

Money can only measure real things, and the potential for real things. While
it is possible to create large amounts of virtual money - sooner or later
two economic events slam into each other and reduce the myriads of would be
money, into much smaller amounts of real money. A bear market is the process
of returning money to its rightful owners, quoth the sage.

With a highly interconnected world - driven by our need for disinflation,
oil and the money to pay for them - meets a housing meltdown is potentially
such an economic event.

-:-

So let's recap - the small picture is that this is the normal spring slide.
The medium picture says that profits aren't going to grow and there are few
new sources of business to replace housing which is going away. The big
picture says that the world economy has been booming, but it has feet of
clay.

So how bad is bad?

The answer is "nobody knows". Global financial instruments are more or less
unregulated, because they can always be split between the least regulated
places. This has been encouraged, because the spreading out of risk has been
part of the role that the US plays to pay for its oil and disinflation
habbit.

However, the indications are that there is no source of ultimate liquidity,
partially because the US hinders it [4] - no borrower of last resort as the
financial world calls it - to bail things out should they unravel. The risks
are too unknown, the ways they have been built into everything to obscure.
This scares a lot of very rich people alot. But these paper problems are
simply a reflection of the larger unknown - our current world economy is
running hot - how long can we find ways of making it slightly more
efficient, and therefore avoid the disruption of a big transition?

Nobody knows that either.

However, because that transition isn't going to happen now, this economic
crash that is coming isn't going to be Great Depression bad. However, it can
be Great Depression bad - in the sense of the late 19th century's "Great
Depression" - where for 20 years, the amount of money in global supply
didn't grow anywhere near as fast as the expansion of capital. Wages fell,
people were squeezed - revolutionary movements such as Marxism grew rapidly.
Yes there was a great deal of capital build out, but most people didn't see
the benefits. However, in the 1890's new sources of gold, and new
technologies for extracting it were found, and since money, then, was based
on gold, there was a last mad scramble for it, and for the coal that ran the
factories.

In our own moment, the reason this slide may be much worse than people
expect, and worse that 2000-2002, is because of money. You see a stock
market slide hurts the rich the most - that is why Bush was forced in,
because he promised to bail them out of the stock slide, and did. But this
only gets ugly when the assets people hold get crunched - the price of
whatever they sell, and what they save. The global economy has been propped
up by a bubble of US money supply. Money supply is created when a bank can
loan money. Since banks can loan money more easily if they can sell off the
risk - theoretically they don't have to back this with reserves - and since
the housing bubble gave them more market value to loan money too - this
created more dollars. Lots more dollars. However, the same process works in
reverse - the housing bust means that they cannot make more loans, the
global complacency boom means it can't get any cheaper to make loans. This
means that M3 - the biggest - money supply will start to slow and even
perhaps contract, as banks have to stop making loans because they don't have
sub prime borrowers to buy inflated houses with risk shifted dollars at
generationally low interest rates.

Each one of these steps is a domino - the low rates made risk very cheap.
This meant that all of the world money was put into making big upside bets,
and little into real hedging. This meant that there was a wash of cheap
credit. The failure of economic policy - war, breast implants and
McMansions - meant that wages never caught up to the big bets. Instead,
those who sold oil picked the money off the table. This leads to the
collapse of the subprime borrower - who in another form is the guy who will
get a good job if everything goes right for him. This leads to the bust in
housing prices, and that means no more lending, and the people who bought
the risk are suddenly going to cut off financial insurance.

Bang. Bang. Bang. The each big drop on the stock market is pulled along
after it, as money that had been parked there, now must go to pay off bad
loans. At somepoint - and we will know soon - so much money will be pulled
off the table, that other people will be forced to sell just because they
too, had money parked and not invested.

This means that this could be very much like the financial panics of the
1890's - at the peak of the guilded age - when reactionary forces around the
world made a stand against changing how business was done, and the result
put the world on a march to a final show down over control of the coal and
colonies economy. In short, Iraq will be the Boer War of our economic
times - a last small war over the thing everyone will have wanted, even as
it is becoming obsolete.

This very big picture says that should we fall into recession here, it will
not be the kind of shallow fall and long slow recovery that the last two
recessions have been, but instead, the kind of sharp fall of the mid 1970's
or mid 1890's - leading to a Japan style "bright depression", where periods
of very weak growth are offset by contraction, as the US pays off the
mountain of debts acquired for our brief throw at the Persian Gulf casino.
