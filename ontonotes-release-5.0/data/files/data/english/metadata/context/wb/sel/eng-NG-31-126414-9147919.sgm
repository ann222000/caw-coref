Really?  I've never had to do any more  with DOS/WINDOWS/ or the MAC OS.

What is causing the LinTard OS to Suck so badly in this area?

What is causing the Linux Installer to be incapable of Installing the
Linux OS?

Several of the Installers in the various LinTard packages I tried couldn't
even manage to partition the
disks correctly.

You are of course free to answer the question.

As to the difference... Of course there is no practical difference.

My response isn't continual. I've been quite restrained, really. What
pisses me off is that he's trolling against Linux, but crossposting to a
BSD group.

That's what trolls do.  And it works.  Look at all the people who
actually try to argue with him.

I share with you the feeling that Linux and the OpenSource movement
have some serious flaws.

But I don't think calling it &quot;LinTard&quot; is really helping yourself
being considered serious about your opinions.

Maybe you should show more respect to the community so they will start
listening to you.

It's easy to criticize something.. why don't you try to suggest some
good improvements instead ?
Maybe you'll tell me that you don't have time to lose to do so for
such a cause.. well.. I think otherwise with your ~10k posts in
different newsgroups last month.

No. The real reason is, he is swine.

At least the pearls you cast before him cost you nothing!

By the way, there is no &quot;OpenSource&quot; movement.  There may be a &quot;Free
Software&quot; movement.  But there definitely is a community of &quot;Share and
share alike&quot;.

You should write fiction, or comedy perhaps.

Either way your claims are an absurd fantasy.

Do you even have ANY experience with DOS?

You can't possibly have. Either that or your a bald faced liar.

Nothing. This is just your own private little fantasy.

Assuming this is not all some drug induced hallucination on
your part my guess would be failing hardware. Although I've managed
to startup even failing machines with Linux Live CD's.

That's a pretty handy way to use hardware that would otherwise
need to be scrapped.

Even a monkey can install Linux these days. What's your excuse?

...also attempting to claim that it is less sophisticated than
MS-DOS is not going to get you taken seriously.
