I may be biting off more that I can (or want to) chew, but I thought I
might respond after all to Lynne Kositsky and Roger Stritmatter's critique of
Part 1 of the essay by Tom Reedy and Dave Kathman.

(Reedy and Kathman's comments are preceded by '&gt;&gt;'.
Kositsky and Stritmatters comments are preceded by '&gt;'.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We will now respond to part 1 of the Reedy and Kathman essay, point by
&gt; point.
&gt;&gt; 1. The name &quot;William Shakespeare&quot; appears on the plays and poems.

&gt;&gt; Good evidence that William Shakespeare wrote the plays and poems
&gt;&gt; bearing his name is the fact that his name appears on them as the
&gt;&gt; author.
&gt; No one has ever disputed that the name William Shakespeare or William
&gt; Shake-speare appears on many play quartos. R and K consider this to be
&gt; good evidence for the belief that Shakespeare of Stratford was the
&gt; author. We disagree. Some plays published under the name William
&gt; Shakespeare were not by Shakespeare,

"/>

True.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; while some plays that were by the
&gt; author known as William Shakespeare were published anonymously.

"/>

True.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; According to Taylor and Mosher in their exhaustive study of pseudonyms
&gt; and anonyms, the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were the golden
&gt; age of authorship deceptions of one kind or another. Literary
&gt; deceptions flourished in early modern England, and the case of
&gt;&quot;Shakespeare&quot; is only the most startling example of the success of
&gt; such deceptions.

"/>

In what way were the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the &quot;golden age
of authorship deceptions&quot;? Was there a host of authors using other people's
names (and other people) to hide their identity? Who were they?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 1a. In 1593, the narrative poem Venus and Adonis was published by
&gt;&gt; Stratford native Richard Field, with a dedication to the Earl of
&gt;&gt; Southampton signed &quot;William Shakespeare.&quot;
&gt; Actually, as George Greenwood argued in the early 1920s, Field was the
&gt; printer and not the publisher of Venus and Adonis.

"/>

Dave Kathman has already responded to this.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Greenwood's 1916 book, Is There a Shakespeare Problem? reviews and
&gt; critiques the 1914 publication, Shakespeare's Environment, by Mrs.
&gt; C.C. Stopes, the first book which tried to make the argument recently
&gt; reprised by David Kathman in his website essay on Richard Field's
&gt; alleged connections to the bard Shakespeare to which Reedy and Kathman
&gt; provide a hyperlink. George Greenwood's remarks are still pertinent to
&gt; the discussion and we reprint them here:

&gt; Then as to the friends in whom Shakespeare was so fortunate, we are
&gt; told that &quot;through all he had one friend at least, during his period
&gt; of toil and preparation,&quot; and this was &quot;his townsman, Richard Field
&gt; (his senior by three years), who had been at Stratford Grammar School,
&gt; and entered life on the solid lines of an apprentice to Thomas
&gt; Vautrollier, the great French printer, and became his son-in-law and
&gt; successor. Doubtless [my italics] Shakespeare went first to reside
&gt; with him; certainly he was much with him. His shop was the poet's
&gt; university, where he read for his degree by the inclusions and
&gt; exclusions of the bookshelves [whatever that may mean]...Field's
&gt; publications account for most of his learning. There he was inspired
&gt; by 'Plutarch's Lives Englished by North,' trained by 'Puttenham's Arte
&gt; of English Poesie,' in the canons of literature and a taste for blank
&gt; verse. There he found books on music, philosophy, scientce, travels,
&gt; medicine, language, and literature, which we know he read.

&gt; All this is delightful for an impromptu after-dinner speech, but it is
&gt; mere imagination and assumption. What are the facts as far as they are
&gt; known? Richard Field, says Mrs. Stopes, &quot;had been at Stratford Grammar
&gt; School.&quot; Where is the evidence of that? If such there is, I should be
&gt; glad to see it. He left Stratford for London in 1579, some eight years
&gt; before Shakspere abandoned his home. &quot; Doubtless Shakespeare went at
&gt; first to reside with him&quot;! Again there is not the slightest shade or
&gt; scintilla of evidence to support this statement. It is really
&gt; monstrous that a mere guess of this sort should be stated as an
&gt; undoubted fact of Shakspere's life. Vautrollier's &quot;shop was the poet's
&gt; university&quot;! This, again, is merely post-prandial eloquence. We do not
&gt; know that Shakspere ever entered Vautrollier's shop,and, really,
&gt; biographies ought to be based on ascertained facts, not on &quot;fanciful
&gt; might-have-beens.&quot;(1)

&gt;&quot;There he found books on music, philosophy, science, etc. etc., which
&gt; we know he read.&quot; Yes, we know, certainly, that &quot;Shakespeare&quot; must
&gt; have read such books as these, but there is no evidence at all to show
&gt; that the player Shakspere did so, either at Vautrollier's shop or
&gt; anywhere else. There is nothing to show that he ever had a book in his
&gt; possession, and, as I have already pointed out, he appears to have
&gt; died without books, and without a thought of them.

&gt; But &quot;it was Richad Field who printed and published Shakespeare's two
&gt; poems, the only works which are sure he published and corrected
&gt; himself.&quot; As to that, however, there is something more to be said. The
&gt; Sationer's Register proves that Richard Field, on April 18, 1593,
&gt; acquired the copyright in Venus and Adonis, and that on June 25, 1594,
&gt; he assigned that coyright to John Harrison, Senior, and I apprehend I
&gt; am absolutely correct in saying that although Field printed the poem,
&gt; in his printing office at Ludgate, the real publisher therof was this
&gt; John Harrison of the &quot;White Greyhound&quot; in St. Paul's Churchyard,
&gt; where, as the title page of the 1593 quarto informs us, the work was
&gt;&quot;to be sold.&quot; As Mr. H.R. Tedder puts it, in the Dictionary of
&gt; National Biography, Field &quot;printed three editions of [Venus and Adonis
&gt; and the first of Lucrece for John Harrison,&quot; the publisher. The quarto
&gt; of Venus and Adonis was, as the title page tells us, &quot;imprinted by
&gt; Richard Field, and are to be sold at the signe of the White Greyhound
&gt; [Harrison's shop] in Paul's Churchyard.&quot; The first edition of Lucrece
&gt; was &quot;printed by Richard Field, for John Harrison, and are to be sold
&gt; at the signe of the White Greyhound,&quot; etc.

&gt; I think, too, it is fair to say that if Field and the author of Venus
&gt; and Adonis had been close friends we should hardly have expected to
&gt; find Field parting with his copyright in the poem; rather, we should
&gt; have expected to find him in possession of the copyright of Lucrece
&gt; also.

&gt; Moreover, not one of the Quarto plays came from Field's press. Actor
&gt; Manager Shakespeare did not, apparently, care to employ his friend on
&gt; behalf of his company. In short, when the known facts are examined,
&gt; all that is transpires is that Field was a Stratford man, and that he
&gt; printed the two poems which were published by Harrison. Singularly
&gt; little evidence, surely, for the &quot;Stratfordian&quot; authorship, unless
&gt; imaginary and poetic details be added in the fervor of an impromptu
&gt; Oration...&quot;

&gt; (Is There a Shakespeare Problem?, 569-570)

&gt; Mr. Reedy and Dr. Kathman appear not to have consulted George
&gt; Greenwood's remarks before assuring us of the great importance of the
&gt; supposed connection between William Shakespeare of Stratford and
&gt; Richard Field.

"/>

Where in 1a of their essay are Reedy and Kathman &quot;...assuring us of the
great importance of the supposed connection between William Shakespeare of
Stratford and Richard Field&quot;? They simply say that the poem &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;
was printed by Field. And they're right. Why should they be held accountable
for the speculations of Mrs. Stopes?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Footnotes (From Greenwood)

&gt; 1. Sir Sidney Lee rightly characterizes as &quot;fanciful&quot; the theory &quot;that
&gt; Field found work in Vautrollier's printing office for Shakespeare on
&gt; his arrival in London&quot; (Life, p. 30).
&gt;&gt; This dedication refers to the author's &quot;unpolisht lines&quot; and contains
&gt;&gt; the typically fawning language of a commoner addressing a nobleman for
&gt;&gt; patronage.
&gt; Fawning is a curious word to apply to the dedication of Venus and
&gt; Adonis. Graceful and ironically self-deprecating might be more in
&gt; order. Here is a link to the dedication in question:
&gt; [18] http://www.shakespearefellowship.org/virtualclassroom/v&amp;a.htm

"/>

&quot;Fawning&quot; works for me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It is clear that at its most superficial level the dedication effects
&gt; to be what R and K claim it is. While the tone is not fawning, the
&gt; dedication does appropriate the language of a writer seeking patronage
&gt; from a powerful noble.

"/>

In other words, it's fawning.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; R and K, however, misunderstand when they
&gt; presume that the author of the dedication actually believes the lines
&gt; in question are unpolisht.

"/>

Where do they say they believe the author of the dedication actually
believes the lines in question to be unpolisht?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In our opinion, there is an ironic tenor to
&gt; the dedication. Further, it is interesting to note that it contains
&gt; the following sexual innuendo: eare so barren a land, for feare it
&gt; yeeld me still so bad a haruest... We find it hard to imagine that a
&gt; commoner would address an earl in such terms, and wonder about the
&gt; literary subtext which is being communicated through the metaphorical
&gt; structures of the dedication.

"/>

I'm not very familiar with Elizabethan dedications, so I can't really
judge how typical this dedication is, or how appropriate it is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As long ago as the 1930s, Charles Wisner Barrell, in an article in the
&gt; Saturday Evening Post, proposed that the invention to which the author
&gt; refers in the line if the first heir of my invention prove deformed...
&gt; alludes to the first occurrence in print of the name William
&gt; Shakespeare. Reedy and Kathman, however, treat the dedication as an
&gt; item

Well, of course, we could now mount a response to Gary's response, but
I guess at some point it gets silly (although we are doing some more
work on Field). ;) I am, though, fascinated by your using the term
&quot;trained scholars,&quot; Tom. People bandy the word expert or scholar
around on hlas all the time. Now as you know, I've never pretended to
be either. But I'd really like, once and for all, for some of you
gentlemen (and ladies?) of the orthodox persuasion to get together and
give a definition of one or both words. I've tried with David Webb. I
don't get very far. David, bless his heart, is very good at tying me
into a pretzel. (David, by the way, I've had very little time lately
but glanced at your post regarding Dr. Stritmatter's statistical
errors in his thesis. I'm not ignoring what you said. I just don't
feel qualified to comment.)

What constitutes an expert? Does one have to have a PhD? Does one's
PhD have to be in English with a specialty in Shakespeare? Does one
have to teach in a university setting? Must one be teaching
Shakespeare? Does one need to be tenured? Most important question of
all of course--does one have to be a traditionalist/Stratfordian
(whatever you wish to call it)?

It seems to me that most people on hlas accept that Dr. David Kathman
is an expert/scholar (I don't dispute this), although his PhD has
nothing to do with Shakespeare, and he doesn't teach. But Dr. Dan
Wright has a Ph.D in English, teaches Shakespeare, has tenure, etc.,
and yet many here reject the idea of his being an expert. I admit to
being flummoxed, unless it is something to do with belief. &quot;I believe
in something, and therefore only those who espouse the same beliefs
can be scholars and or experts.&quot; It can't be anything to do with
making mistakes, for Dr. Alan Nelson appears to be an expert according
to most here, and yet he has agreed that he has made several errors,
at least one egregious, in his latest work on Oxford.

Help wanted, please. Shall try to get online to see if there are any
responses.

A &quot;trained scholar&quot; is a person with an education who can jump through a
hoop, sit up and beg, roll over and play dead.

On hlas, it is a shorthand term for a person who knows what he's talking
about, i.e. agrees with the speaker.

I notice you didn't address Gary's point, which is that your responses
indicate that you missed the point of the essay. You kept dragging the topic
back to what you wanted to talk about, that is, antiStratfordian theories
and speculations that are irrelevant to the historical evidence we
presented.

What is an expert so far as the authorship controversy is concerned? I would
say anyone who has devoted ten or more years to research into Shakespeare's life
and times, and written the equivalent of two or three solid books on
Shakespeare's life or times, AND is accepted as an expert by others who have
done the same. With the caveat that some or many experts can be wrong, and that
sometimes a non-expert will know more than all the experts in a subject, even
about their whole field. I consider myself an expert in the field of
English-language experimental poetry of the last fifty years, for example, but
certainly not on Shakespeare or his times.

To answer offhand but with some thought.

I differentiate between &quot;experts&quot; and &quot;scholars&quot;. On the former, I
follow Dilbert, &quot;An expert is someone who has been given an expert's
job; no other qualification is necessary&quot;. This is partly because I
myself work as an &quot;expert&quot; in a field which I have never studied
formally.

What Bob defines as an &quot;expert&quot; I would take as a scholar (though I

Hmmm, I would call what Nicholas calls an expert, an &quot;authority.&quot; Some
authorities are also experts but the ones the media uses generally are not. I
would call what I call an expert who is not accepted by the experts in his field
a scholar, and stick by my definition of an expert. A scholar is someone who
has clearly studied and knows a lot about a field, and written about it. An
expert is a scholar who has been accepted as having done reasonably important,
valid work in his field by the majority of scholars and experts in that field.

Heminge and Condel and Jonson are experts on Shakespeare,
Lynne. There is no dissension, no confusion, no debate amongst
these three experts. You, however, want us to ignore their
EXPERT opinions, their EXPERT testimony, just so we
can pay homage to your hurtful mission of elevating the
Earl of Oxford to be the author. It is, in the word of Jonson,
ridiculous.

Heminge and Condel and Jonson are experts.

Heminge and Condel and Jonson are EXPERTs on Shakespeare.

For my answer, see below.

No. Having a Ph.D. is neither necessary nor sufficient. For
example, I have a Ph.D., yet I am not expert in anything, including the

scholars whose expertise is undeniable who do not have Ph.D.s. I also

not possess even an undergraduate degree. If one seeks to attain
expertise in a field, then earning a Ph.D. may well (depending upon the

be many other means to the same end.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No, I cannot see why that would be necessary. True, most Shakespeare

Are you also &quot;flummOXed&quot; by the fact that Dr. Wright, as one of the

the confusion of Mary Tudor with Mary Queen of Scots, the confusion of
Oxford's sister with his half-sister, etc.? Tom Veal has pointed out
many other gaffes at his web site. That these howlers were immediately
spotted in a cursory and uncritical reading by mere untrained amateurs
certainly raises questions about the expertise of those who approved it
for which I do not have answers. One possibility is that the presumed
experts have unusually lax standards for a Ph.D. thesis. Another
possibility is that Dr. Stritmatter did not avail himself of the
critical scrutiny of experts among whom he could have circulated the
thesis, and that those experts on his committee, if any, did not afford
the document even the cursory reading of a handful of untrained Usenet
amateurs.

No, experts in many fields often disagree strenuously while fully
acknowledging and respecting each other's expertise. Shakespeare
scholars certainly are no exception. You can well imagine that
scientists would dismiss the supposed expertise of one of their number
who opined that, say, biological evolution proceeded by the inheritance
of acquired traits -- *until* credible evidence meeting normal
scientific standards was presented. If historical evidence meeting
normal disciplinary standards is ever adduced that both impeaches the
reliability of the historical record and strongly supports an
alternative author, then experts will change their minds; indeed, they
do so all the time when presented with surprising new evidence, after
(of course) subjecting that evidence to rigorous, skeptical scrutiny.

I was surprised that neither the traditionalists nor the Oxfordians on
the committee caught it. I caught it on first reading, sitting in
Portland airport, got home and called Roger right away. He was upset
but readily admitted his mistake. As I've said before, he knew very
well the difference between Mary Tudor and Mary Queen of Scots. But to
take this a step further, apparently many errors are not caught by
anybody, even in commercial books. See my posts on Dr. Nelson's white
herrings. And I've made a few ghastly errors myself in books, luckily
picked up by editors. The trouble is, the more one rereads what one
has done, the less one actually reads with understanding--or at least
I've found this to be the case. There's only so many times one can go
through a piece of work of one's own without having one's eyes glaze
over or vomiting. And of course, Roger's diss and Alan's book were
both scrutinized by readers (by this I mean readers of opposing teams)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; many other gaffes at his web site. That these howlers were immediately

&gt; certainly raises questions about the expertise of those who approved it
&gt; for which I do not have answers. One possibility is that the presumed
&gt; experts have unusually lax standards for a Ph.D. thesis. Another
&gt; possibility is that Dr. Stritmatter did not avail himself of the
&gt; critical scrutiny of experts among whom he could have circulated the
&gt; thesis, and that those experts on his committee, if any, did not afford
&gt; the document even the cursory reading of a handful of untrained Usenet
&gt; amateurs.

A third possibility is that many dissertations contain what you call
&quot;howlers&quot; but are not subjected to such close scrutiny. I've often
read dissertations when doing research for my babby-books, and have
been stunned by the obvious errors or lack of research. Roger's
doesn't come anywhere close. And there's so much good material in his
dissertation, it seems a shame to me that we keep going over and over
the same mistakes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; unless it is something to do with belief. &quot;I believe
&gt;&gt; in something, and therefore only those who espouse the same beliefs
&gt;&gt; can be scholars and or experts.&quot;

&gt; No, experts in many fields often disagree strenuously while fully
&gt; acknowledging and respecting each other's expertise. Shakespeare
&gt; scholars certainly are no exception. You can well imagine that
&gt; scientists would dismiss the supposed expertise of one of their number
&gt; who opined that, say, biological evolution proceeded by the inheritance
&gt; of acquired traits -- *until* credible evidence meeting normal
&gt; scientific standards was presented. If historical evidence meeting
&gt; normal disciplinary standards is ever adduced that both impeaches the
&gt; reliability of the historical record and strongly supports an
&gt; alternative author, then experts will change their minds; indeed, they
&gt; do so all the time when presented with surprising new evidence, after
&gt; (of course) subjecting that evidence to rigorous, skeptical scrutiny.

"/>

We'll have to agree to disagree on that one, David. I think there's
more at stake here than &quot;rigorous, skeptical scrutiny,&quot; although I
can't for the life of me work out what it is. Just look at the bad
feeling the subject engenders on hlas, for example. There are vested
interests, or perhaps emotional ones. There is something that says,
&quot;This is the way I want it to be and I'll fight to the death to keep
it this way.&quot; I'm not only talking of traditionalists here, of course.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; It can't be anything to do with
&gt;&gt; making mistakes, for Dr. Alan Nelson appears to be an expert according
&gt;&gt; to most here,

&gt; May I presume that you do not disagree?

"/>

I think that Alan is one of the greatest experts in the world with
regard to the documents concerning Oxford. However, I would disagree
strenuously with some of his interpretations of those documents.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; and yet he has agreed that he has made several errors,
&gt;&gt; at least one egregious, in his latest work on Oxford.

&gt; I know of none as egregious as confusing Mary Tudor with Mary Queen
&gt; of Scots, but perhaps you do.

"/>

Well, white herrings is pretty dreadful, as Alan would be the first to
admit. That's confusing human beings with fish. But as I said before,
we all make mistakes. Or at least, we who are human do.

&gt;&gt;I will try to elaborate below, in answer to your
&gt;&gt; queries, Lynne.

"/>

[...]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; What constitutes an expert?
&gt;&gt; For my answer, see below.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Does one have to have a PhD?
&gt;&gt; No. Having a Ph.D. is neither necessary nor sufficient. For
&gt;&gt; example, I have a Ph.D., yet I am not expert in anything, including the
&gt;&gt; field in which I conduct research. On the other hand, I know renowned
&gt;&gt; scholars whose expertise is undeniable who do not have Ph.D.s. I also
&gt;&gt; know of birders whose expertise is universally acknowledged, yet who do
&gt;&gt; not possess even an undergraduate degree. If one seeks to attain
&gt;&gt; expertise in a field, then earning a Ph.D. may well (depending upon the
&gt;&gt; field) be a helpful first step -- but it rarely suffices, and there may
&gt;&gt; be many other means to the same end.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Does one's
&gt;&gt;&gt; PhD have to be in English with a specialty in Shakespeare?
&gt;&gt; No; as noted above, one need not even have a Ph.D., or even a college
&gt;&gt; degree.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Does one
&gt;&gt;&gt; have to teach in a university setting?
&gt;&gt; No. For example, Dave Kathman does not, yet he has contributed to
&gt;&gt; several scholarly undertakings enjoying high prestige, undertakings for
&gt;&gt; which expertise is a minimum prerequisite for selection.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Must one be teaching
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare?
&gt;&gt; No; see above.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Does one need to be tenured?
&gt;&gt; No; see above.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Most important question of
&gt;&gt;&gt; all of course--does one have to be a traditionalist/Stratfordian
&gt;&gt;&gt; (whatever you wish to call it)?
&gt;&gt; No, I cannot see why that would be necessary. True, most Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; experts (as far as I know) have little doubt that the conventional
&gt;&gt; attribution is substantially correct (although of course there are
&gt;&gt; uncertainties about the extent of collaboration with other playwrights
&gt;&gt; in specific works), but that consensus is a consequence of, rather than
&gt;&gt; a prerequisite for, their expertise.

"/>

You don't look like a pretzel to me, Lynne, and I just viewed a
recent photo!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems to me that most people on hlas accept that Dr. David Kathman
&gt;&gt;&gt; is an expert/scholar (I don't dispute this),
&gt;&gt; I doubt that anyone disputes it, with the possible exception of Mr.
&gt;&gt; Crowley.
&gt;&gt;&gt; although his PhD has
&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing to do with Shakespeare, and he doesn't teach.
&gt;&gt; See above.
&gt;&gt;&gt; But Dr. Dan
&gt;&gt;&gt; Wright has a Ph.D in English, teaches Shakespeare,
&gt;&gt; What one teaches may have little to do with one's expertise, if any.
&gt;&gt;&gt; has tenure, etc.,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and yet many here reject the idea of his being an expert.
&gt;&gt; Well, I do not know Dr. Wright, and I am an ignoramus without even
&gt;&gt; any training, let alone expertise, in any case, so I am scarcely the
&gt;&gt; person to ask; however, those who have questioned Dr. Wright's expertise
&gt;&gt; seem on the whole to have provided evidence for their contention, which
&gt;&gt; of course everyone is free to examine and to evaluate.
&gt; I believe Dr. Wright to be an expert,

I have not seen any evidence of his expertise, so I will reserve
judgment.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; I admit to

&gt;&gt; Are you also &quot;flummOXed&quot; by the fact that Dr. Wright, as one of the
&gt;&gt; examiners on Dr. Stritmatter's committee, apparently *accepted* the
&gt;&gt; thesis in its final form, replete with its hilarious howlers, including
&gt;&gt; the confusion of Mary Tudor with Mary Queen of Scots, the confusion of
&gt;&gt; Oxford's sister with his half-sister, etc.?
&gt; I was surprised that neither the traditionalists nor the Oxfordians on
&gt; the committee caught it.

"/>

I'm not sure which were &quot;traditionalists&quot; (although I understand that
Elizabeth Petroff expressed some skepticism), but the research interests
of all the committee members other than Dr. Wright appear to be rather
far removed from Elizabethan literary history. Indeed, those research
interests are listed as follows:

Freeman: British Lit, Early--19th Century; Bible; Popular Culture.
Gentzler: Translation theory, literary translation, and
poststructuralist theory.
Moebius: Word/image and literary-musical relations, the children's
picturebook, and narrative theory.
Petroff: Medieval literature, autobiography, and comparative mythology.

Matters being so, one would expect Dr. Wright, as the *only*
self-professed Shakespeare specialist on the committee, to have
scrutinized the thesis carefully for factual gaffes before accepting it,
since the other committee members were not specialists in the area.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I caught it on first reading, sitting in

You do not consider yourself an expert, yet you caught that howler on
first reading, as did many non-expert amateurs; other presumably
inexpert Usenet amateurs caught many other errors as well (see Tom
Veal's web page,

for further discussion). Dr. Wright evidently did not catch this howler
(nor any of the others), yet you consider him an expert. This view
strikes me as curious.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

True -- that's why one would expect Dr. Wright to have read the

the committee with the putative expertise in the pertinent specialty

indeed what such howlers were.

it doesn't appear to have been &quot;scrutinized&quot; by *anybody* with expertise

any care at all, but certain gaffes were nonetheless glaring; I cannot

I've read a few dissertations in my career, but I haven't encountered

quality to launch academic careers and to get their authors noticed,
employed, etc.) tend to be read pretty critically before submission and
hence tend to be relatively free of egregious errors. A few theses with
serious but subtle errors do slip through, but generally not with
blatant, hilarious howlers.

Dr. Webb, I have to side with Lynne on this one. Perhaps because there are
no degree programs for chess history, and thus no rigorous training for the
budding chess historian, much writing on the history of chess is marked by
errors of the Nelson/whiting and Stritmatter/Mary nature. For example,
Edward Winter, considered by many the world's leading chess historian and a
writer with a reputation for painstaking accuracy, mixed up the
International Correspondence Chess Federation and FIDE in an essay, and
claimed FIDE awards correspondence chess titles. Dr. John Hilbert, winner of
many awards for his chess history writing, managed to print two different
versions of a game between Napier and Marshall in his biographies of these
two players. Dr. Vlastimil Fiala has managed to cite both Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh as the capitol of Pennsylvania (Harrisburg would be correct). My
home state's geography claimed another victim this week, as Tim Harding's
otherwise facinating Chess Cafe article on the Cambridge Springs 1904
tournament described Cambridge Springs as &quot;close to Philadelphia&quot;. For
&quot;close to&quot; read &quot;400 miles from&quot;.

My point, and possibly Lynne's as well, is that you can nitpick all you
want, but in most cases it never rises above the level of nitpicking. Even
Homer nods, and sometimes he nods in public.

I was just referring to academic theses, which are suppposed to be
vetted pretty carefully by at least one expert on the candidate's
committee before being accepted. That's not to say that the process is
foolproof by any means; however, most errors that survive such scrutiny

normally few egregious gaffes actually make it into the final version.

Those are indeed rather amazing examples. However, is it perhaps the
case that chess history as it is currently practiced lies somewhere in
between journalism and the more &quot;academic&quot; areas of history? This query
is by no means intended to disparage journalism, but articles in the
popular press dealing with specialized topics (especially scientific
ones) are often penned by journalists who have little or no training or
expertise in the subject, but who have hurriedly conducted research for
the purpose of the article on which they are working; moreover, such
articles are generally approved by an editor who probably also lacks
specialized expertise in the article's subject. Such articles may
contain egregious factual errors and fundamental misunderstandings, as
some of the popular accounts of the authorship &quot;question&quot; have recently
demonstrated.

I agree -- but from an assumption that is false, one can prove *any*
sort of nonsense and one's conclusions cannot be taken seriously.
Matters being so, it is little wonder that Dr. Stritmatter took pains to
criticize the views of mainstream scholars and to present quantitative
evidence (or what was evidently intended to be evidence, at any rate)
that his assumption was correct, i.e., that the supposed links between
Oxford's Bible and the Shakespeare canon were not accidental. That was
in some sense the pivotal part of the thesis, since without it there was
no earthly reason to surmise that Dr. Stritmatter's underlying
assumption regarding authorship was correct.

Oxfordians have been crowing since the Bible's discovery that it was
a sort of smoking gun that would be decisive in the authorship &quot;dispute&quot;
(of course, among qualified scholars, there appears to be little, if
any, dispute at all). Thus the spectacle of the scholar who just
devoted a decade of painstaking work to the minute examination of the

&gt;&gt; Dr. Webb, I have to side with Lynne on this one. Perhaps because there
are
&gt;&gt; no degree programs for chess history, and thus no rigorous training for
the
&gt;&gt; budding chess historian, much writing on the history of chess is marked
by
&gt;&gt; errors of the Nelson/whiting and Stritmatter/Mary nature.

&gt; I was just referring to academic theses, which are suppposed to be
&gt; vetted pretty carefully by at least one expert on the candidate's
&gt; committee before being accepted. That's not to say that the process is
&gt; foolproof by any means; however, most errors that survive such scrutiny
&gt; (if the committee has indeed been doing its job) tend to be subtle, and
&gt; normally few egregious gaffes actually make it into the final version.

"/>

I'm sorry, I took your response to Lynne, who specifically mentioned
&quot;books&quot;, to apply to books in the specialty of the author.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; For example,
&gt;&gt; Edward Winter, considered by many the world's leading chess historian
and a
&gt;&gt; writer with a reputation for painstaking accuracy, mixed up the
&gt;&gt; International Correspondence Chess Federation and FIDE in an essay, and
&gt;&gt; claimed FIDE awards correspondence chess titles. Dr. John Hilbert,
winner of
&gt;&gt; many awards for his chess history writing, managed to print two
different
&gt;&gt; versions of a game between Napier and Marshall in his biographies of
these
&gt;&gt; two players. Dr. Vlastimil Fiala has managed to cite both Philadelphia
and
&gt;&gt; Pittsburgh as the capitol of Pennsylvania (Harrisburg would be correct).
My
&gt;&gt; home state's geography claimed another victim this week, as Tim
Harding's
&gt;&gt; otherwise facinating Chess Cafe article on the Cambridge Springs 1904
&gt;&gt; tournament described Cambridge Springs as &quot;close to Philadelphia&quot;. For
&gt;&gt;&quot;close to&quot; read &quot;400 miles from&quot;.

&gt; Those are indeed rather amazing examples. However, is it perhaps the
&gt; case that chess history as it is currently practiced lies somewhere in
&gt; between journalism and the more &quot;academic&quot; areas of history?

"/>

Yes, it does fall in between the two. I only know of four chess historians -
Richard Forster, John Donaldson, Olimpiu Urcan, and Dr. Vlastimil Fiala -
who have training as a historian, and only Dr. Fiala has a Phd. Urcan is
preparing a doctoral thesis on the history of chess in Singapore, which may
be the first thesis using chess history as its subject.

This query

&gt; is by no means intended to disparage journalism, but articles in the
&gt; popular press dealing with specialized topics (especially scientific

&gt; the purpose of the article on which they are working; moreover, such

&gt; contain egregious factual errors and fundamental misunderstandings, as
&gt; some of the popular accounts of the authorship &quot;question&quot; have recently

Agreed, although most chess history writers are better than your description
of journalism. At least, I like to think that I rise above it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; My point, and possibly Lynne's as well, is that you can nitpick all you

If you like, Dr. Webb, I will provide examples from my own work:

In an article on chess in San Quentin prison in 1916, I moved the prison
away from the coast. This same article featured some careless proofreading
on my part.

In an article on the 1943 PSCF Championship, despite having six people
review the article, the name of a well-known Grandmaster was spelled
incorrectly.

That same article, when it appeared in Quarterly for Chess History, had the
game headings changed to &quot;Philadelphia&quot; from &quot;Pittsburgh&quot;.

In a recent article on the 1860 Japanese Embassy to the US, and their visit
to the Philadelphia Chess Club, I included an amusing typo when quoting a
Walt Whitman poem. I wrote &quot;prices&quot; for &quot;princes&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, of course, we could now mount a response to Gary's response, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess at some point it gets silly (although we are doing some more
&gt;&gt;&gt;work on Field). ;) I am, though, fascinated by your using the term
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;trained scholars,&quot; Tom. People bandy the word expert or scholar
&gt;&gt;&gt;around on hlas all the time. Now as you know, I've never pretended to
&gt;&gt;&gt;be either. But I'd really like, once and for all, for some of you
&gt;&gt;&gt;gentlemen (and ladies?) of the orthodox persuasion to get together and
&gt;&gt;&gt;give a definition of one or both words. I've tried with David Webb. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;don't get very far. David, bless his heart, is very good at tying me
&gt;&gt;&gt;into a pretzel.

&gt;&gt; I?! Surely not!

&gt;But David, you've just done it again below. &lt;g&gt;. But this is an
&gt;interesting thread, isn't it? I'm so pleased that Roger and I, in one
&gt;way or another, have given hlasers so much grist for the mill lately.

&gt;&gt;I will try to elaborate below, in answer to your
&gt;&gt;queries, Lynne.

&gt;&gt;&gt;(David, by the way, I've had very little time lately
&gt;&gt;&gt;but glanced at your post regarding Dr. Stritmatter's statistical
&gt;&gt;&gt;errors in his thesis. I'm not ignoring what you said. I just don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;feel qualified to comment.)

&gt;&gt; You certainly are not obligated to answer for all Dr. Stritmatter's
&gt;&gt;lapses, Lynne. However, without *some* objective evidence that Oxford's
&gt;&gt;Bible has anything to do with Shakespeare, the interest in the thesis is
&gt;&gt;vitiated. The statistical failure strikes me as a far more serious blow
&gt;&gt;to Dr. Stritmatter's thesis than the astonishing howlers therein.

&gt;&gt;&gt;What constitutes an expert?

&gt;&gt; For my answer, see below.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Does one have to have a PhD?

&gt;&gt; No. Having a Ph.D. is neither necessary nor sufficient. For
&gt;&gt;example, I have a Ph.D., yet I am not expert in anything, including the
&gt;&gt;field in which I conduct research. On the other hand, I know renowned
&gt;&gt;scholars whose expertise is undeniable who do not have Ph.D.s. I also
&gt;&gt;know of birders whose expertise is universally acknowledged, yet who do
&gt;&gt;not possess even an undergraduate degree. If one seeks to attain
&gt;&gt;expertise in a field, then earning a Ph.D. may well (depending upon the
&gt;&gt;field) be a helpful first step -- but it rarely suffices, and there may
&gt;&gt;be many other means to the same end.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Does one's
&gt;&gt;&gt;PhD have to be in English with a specialty in Shakespeare?

&gt;&gt; No; as noted above, one need not even have a Ph.D., or even a college
&gt;&gt;degree.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Does one
&gt;&gt;&gt;have to teach in a university setting?

&gt;&gt; No. For example, Dave Kathman does not, yet he has contributed to
&gt;&gt;several scholarly undertakings enjoying high prestige, undertakings for
&gt;&gt;which expertise is a minimum prerequisite for selection.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Must one be teaching
&gt;&gt;&gt;Shakespeare?

&gt;&gt; No; see above.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Does one need to be tenured?

&gt;&gt; No; see above.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Most important question of
&gt;&gt;&gt;all of course--does one have to be a traditionalist/Stratfordian
&gt;&gt;&gt;(whatever you wish to call it)?

&gt;&gt; No, I cannot see why that would be necessary. True, most Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;experts (as far as I know) have little doubt that the conventional
&gt;&gt;attribution is substantially correct (although of course there are
&gt;&gt;uncertainties about the extent of collaboration with other playwrights
&gt;&gt;in specific works), but that consensus is a consequence of, rather than
&gt;&gt;a prerequisite for, their expertise.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It seems to me that most people on hlas accept that Dr. David Kathman
&gt;&gt;&gt;is an expert/scholar (I don't dispute this),

&gt;&gt; I doubt that anyone disputes it, with the possible exception of Mr.
&gt;&gt;Crowley.

&gt;&gt;&gt;although his PhD has
&gt;&gt;&gt;nothing to do with Shakespeare, and he doesn't teach.

&gt;&gt; See above.

&gt;&gt;&gt;But Dr. Dan
&gt;&gt;&gt;Wright has a Ph.D in English, teaches Shakespeare,

&gt;&gt; What one teaches may have little to do with one's expertise, if any.

&gt;&gt;&gt;has tenure, etc.,
&gt;&gt;&gt;and yet many here reject the idea of his being an expert.

&gt;&gt; Well, I do not know Dr. Wright, and I am an ignoramus without even
&gt;&gt;any training, let alone expertise, in any case, so I am scarcely the
&gt;&gt;person to ask; however, those who have questioned Dr. Wright's expertise
&gt;&gt;seem on the whole to have provided evidence for their contention, which
&gt;&gt;of course everyone is free to examine and to evaluate.

&gt;I believe Dr. Wright to be an expert, but like yourself I am an
&gt;ignoramus, so we should get someone else to decide. Of course that
&gt;makes all our opinions concerning experts/scholars somewhat suspect.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I admit to
&gt;&gt;&gt;being flummoxed,

&gt;&gt; Are you also &quot;flummOXed&quot; by the fact that Dr. Wright, as one of the
&gt;&gt;examiners on Dr. Stritmatter's committee, apparently *accepted* the
&gt;&gt;thesis in its final form, replete with its hilarious howlers, including
&gt;&gt;the confusion of Mary Tudor with Mary Queen of Scots, the confusion of
&gt;&gt;Oxford's sister with his half-sister, etc.?

&gt;I was surprised that neither the traditionalists nor the Oxfordians on
&gt;the committee caught it. I caught it on first reading, sitting in
&gt;Portland airport, got home and called Roger right away. He was upset
&gt;but readily admitted his mistake. As I've said before, he knew very
&gt;well the difference between Mary Tudor and Mary Queen of Scots. But to
&gt;take this a step further, apparently many errors are not caught by
&gt;anybody, even in commercial books. See my posts on Dr. Nelson's white
&gt;herrings. And I've made a few ghastly errors myself in books, luckily
&gt;picked up by editors. The trouble is, the more one rereads what one
&gt;has done, the less one actually reads with understanding--or at least
&gt;I've found this to be the case. There's only so many times one can go
&gt;through a piece of work of one's own without having one's eyes glaze
&gt;over or vomiting. And of course, Roger's diss and Alan's book were
&gt;both scrutinized by readers (by this I mean readers of opposing teams)
&gt;much more closely than would normally be the case.

&gt;Tom Veal has pointed out

&gt;&gt;many other gaffes at his web site. That these howlers were immediately
&gt;&gt;spotted in a cursory and uncritical reading by mere untrained amateurs
&gt;&gt;certainly raises questions about the expertise of those who approved it
&gt;&gt;for which I do not have answers. One possibility is that the presumed
&gt;&gt;experts have unusually lax standards for a Ph.D. thesis. Another
&gt;&gt;possibility is that Dr. Stritmatter did not avail himself of the
&gt;&gt;critical scrutiny of experts among whom he could have circulated the
&gt;&gt;thesis, and that those experts on his committee, if any, did not afford
&gt;&gt;the document even the cursory reading of a handful of untrained Usenet
&gt;&gt;amateurs.

&gt;A third possibility is that many dissertations contain what you call
&gt;&quot;howlers&quot; but are not subjected to such close scrutiny. I've often
&gt;read dissertations when doing research for my babby-books, and have
&gt;been stunned by the obvious errors or lack of research. Roger's
&gt;doesn't come anywhere close. And there's so much good material in his
&gt;dissertation, it seems a shame to me that we keep going over and over
&gt;the same mistakes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;unless it is something to do with belief. &quot;I believe
&gt;&gt;&gt;in something, and therefore only those who espouse the same beliefs
&gt;&gt;&gt;can be scholars and or experts.&quot;

&gt;&gt; No, experts in many fields often disagree strenuously while fully
&gt;&gt;acknowledging and respecting each other's expertise. Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;scholars certainly are no exception. You can well imagine that
&gt;&gt;scientists would dismiss the supposed expertise of one of their number
&gt;&gt;who opined that, say, biological evolution proceeded by the inheritance
&gt;&gt;of acquired traits -- *until* credible evidence meeting normal
&gt;&gt;scientific standards was presented. If historical evidence meeting
&gt;&gt;normal disciplinary standards is ever adduced that both impeaches the
&gt;&gt;reliability of the historical record and strongly supports an
&gt;&gt;alternative author, then experts will change their minds; indeed, they
&gt;&gt;do so all the time when presented with surprising new evidence, after
&gt;&gt;(of course) subjecting that evidence to rigorous, skeptical scrutiny.

&gt;We'll have to agree to disagree on that one, David. I think there's
&gt;more at stake here than &quot;rigorous, skeptical scrutiny,&quot; although I
&gt;can't for the life of me work out what it is. Just look at the bad
&gt;feeling the subject engenders on hlas, for example. There are vested
&gt;interests, or perhaps emotional ones. There is something that says,
&gt;&quot;This is the way I want it to be and I'll fight to the death to keep
&gt;it this way.&quot; I'm not only talking of traditionalists here, of course.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It can't be anything to do with
&gt;&gt;&gt;making mistakes, for Dr. Alan Nelson appears to be an expert according
&gt;&gt;&gt;to most here,

&gt;&gt; May I presume that you do not disagree?

&gt;I think that Alan is one of the greatest experts in the world with
&gt;regard to the documents concerning Oxford. However, I would disagree
&gt;strenuously with some of his interpretations of those documents.

&gt;&gt;&gt;and yet he has agreed that he has made several errors,
&gt;&gt;&gt;at least one egregious, in his latest work on Oxford.

&gt;&gt; I know of none as egregious as confusing Mary Tudor with Mary Queen
&gt;&gt;of Scots, but perhaps you do.

&gt;Well, white herrings is pretty dreadful, as Alan would be the first to
&gt;admit. That's confusing human beings

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Neil. I would give David examples, but unfortunately I haven't
&gt;&gt; kept a record of them as you apparently have.

&gt; Surely you can recall one or two -- please?

&gt;&gt; I can certainly tell
&gt;&gt; him, when I get home, what I found excellent about Strit's
&gt;&gt; dissertation.

&gt; I would be interested in that as well.

&gt;&gt; I don't have a copy with me. With regard to Strit's
&gt;&gt; claims, I should just mention that he never claimed in his
&gt;&gt; dissertation that Oxford was Shakespeare. That was a given in the
&gt;&gt; dissertation, as far as I'm aware.

&gt; I agree -- but from an assumption that is false, one can prove *any*
&gt; sort of nonsense and one's conclusions cannot be taken seriously.
&gt; Matters being so, it is little wonder that Dr. Stritmatter took pains to
&gt; criticize the views of mainstream scholars and to present quantitative
&gt; evidence (or what was evidently intended to be evidence, at any rate)
&gt; that his assumption was correct, i.e., that the supposed links between
&gt; Oxford's Bible and the Shakespeare canon were not accidental. That was
&gt; in some sense the pivotal part of the thesis, since without it there was
&gt; no earthly reason to surmise that Dr. Stritmatter's underlying
&gt; assumption regarding authorship was correct.

&gt; Oxfordians have been crowing since the Bible's discovery that it was
&gt; a sort of smoking gun that would be decisive in the authorship &quot;dispute&quot;
&gt; (of course, among qualified scholars, there appears to be little, if
&gt; any, dispute at all). Thus the spectacle of the scholar who just
&gt; devoted a decade of painstaking work to the minute examination of the
&gt; annotated Geneva Bible merely *assuming at the outset* that Oxford was
&gt; the author of the Shakespeare canon weakens the Oxfordian position
&gt; immeasurably; indeed, such a stance tacitly concedes that the vaunted

My absolute worst was writing &quot;pubic&quot; instead of &quot;public&quot; in
*Rebecca's Flame* somewhere. Something about a pubic donation. Oy. Of
course my spell checker didn't catch it, as it was a perfectly good
word. The editors didn't catch it in the ms either. Luckily the line
editor caught it on the second go-through of the galleys, or proofs,
as they're now usually called.

In *The Thought of High Windows*, out next month, I called one
character Inge till about half way through the book, then switched to
Eva, which by the way was the name of another character, and then
switched back to Inge in the last third of the book. I also once
called Mouse &quot;Louse,&quot; and brought the Melice into the novel a year
before they existed. These errors were kindly pointed out to me.

My last horror story is rather weird. I was under contract to write
book 4 of Rachel in the Our Canadian Girl series. I was on a tight
sched and had to write through chemo. Finally I got through most of
it, thought it was brilliant (I was on steroids) and put it aside.
When Penguin got in touch to tell me they needed the ms, I went back
to it and found I barely understood a word. I had written complete
nonsense. Of course some might opine that this is the case with all my
novels. ;)

Spellcheckers are wonderful, but they are too much of a crutch to the

Oversights of this sort of are not uncommon, particularly since, as
you noted, writers have become perhaps overly reliant upon fallible
spellcheckers. (One of my all-time favorites is Mr. Streitz's book, in
which the names of Elizabeth Petroff and Edwin Gentzler are converted by
Mr. Streitz's brilliant alchemy of incompetence into &quot;Elizabeth Petrify&quot;

Since those were all caught by alert readers beforehand, they really
fall into the category of near-disasters rather than full-blown gaffes.
As a sample of the same genre, I offer the experience of a friend of
mine who held a responsible position on the student newspaper at my
undergraduate institution. The university President had just won
approval for the construction, at considerable expense, of a boat dock
near the President's residence. When news of this project reached the
student newspaper and the student body, there was some disgruntlement,
and some student protests ensued. The President, in defending this
plan, tried to explain that some of the wealthiest alumni (and hence the
most promising potential donors) could now avoid the massive traffic
gridlock occasioned by home football games and come yachting elegantly
down the river to be entertained at the President's residence prior to
the kickoff. When my friend went in to the newspaper office late in the
day to proofread the copy for the next issue, he found a news story on
the clamor about the boat dock that was supposed to quote the President
as saying something along the lines of &quot;My dock will be used to
entertain visiting alumni and donors.&quot; However, my friend was shocked
to note that the initial letter of &quot;dock&quot; had, by error or malice, been
changed to a &quot;c&quot;. He hurriedly fixed the error. I'm told also that the
second letter of the word somehow became an &quot;i&quot; thereafter, but that
that too was caught in time. (Of course, one is inclined to suspect
more than mere error at work in this instance.)

As a sample of a gaffe that was *not* caught before publication, I
mention a disaster that befell a joint paper (through no fault of our
own) on which I worked with three friends and colleagues. We were
invited to submit a paper to a commemorative volume celebrating the
bicentennial of a great mathematician and physicist, which we did; the
paper was duly refereed and accepted, and we had submitted camera-ready
copy, so there was nothing for us to do but await its appearance;
however, the publisher requested that we send the TeX file as well in
case there was a need for minor formatting modifications. The
publishers never sent us any page proofs to correct (which they should
certainly have done if they used anything other than our camera-ready
copy), so the first thing we knew of the outcome was the appearance of
the volume in the library. Evidently the publishers had indeed tinkered
with our TeX file rather than using the camera-ready copy, as the first
page was littered with atrocious errors of font, size, etc., all of
which would have been quite evident had anyone even so much as looked at
the paper (e.g., text that should have been italicized appeared in
normal type, but about half the size of the ambient text). However,
more distressing still was an embarrassing contretemps: we had
introduced in the paper the notion of restricted mass, abbreviated
&quot;Rmass&quot; throughout, and according to the publishers' response to my
irate letter, the version of TeX that they were using interpreted &quot;Rm&quot;
as a prefix for &quot;Roman.&quot; Thus the prefix was truncated from every
single occurrence of &quot;Rmass&quot; throughout the paper, including in many
conspicously displayed formulas. Needless to say, we have avoided that
publisher since.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; take this a step further, apparently many errors are not caught by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anybody, even in commercial books.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I cannot recall seeing one of this magnitude in *the specialty of
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; author*.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dr. Webb, I have to side with Lynne on this one. Perhaps because there
&gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt; no degree programs for chess history, and thus no rigorous training for
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; budding chess historian, much writing on the history of chess is marked
&gt; by
&gt;&gt;&gt; errors of the Nelson/whiting and Stritmatter/Mary nature.
&gt;&gt; I was just referring to academic theses, which are suppposed to be
&gt;&gt; vetted pretty carefully by at least one expert on the candidate's
&gt;&gt; committee before being accepted. That's not to say that the process is
&gt;&gt; foolproof by any means; however, most errors that survive such scrutiny
&gt;&gt; (if the committee has indeed been doing its job) tend to be subtle, and
&gt;&gt; normally few egregious gaffes actually make it into the final version.
&gt; I'm sorry, I took your response to Lynne, who specifically mentioned
&gt;&quot;books&quot;, to apply to books in the specialty of the author.

"/>

Fair enough. Certainly I too have seen howlers in books dealing with
an author's specialty. I presume that these errors often arise because
the author is already presumed to be an expert, so the manuscript may
not be subjected to really carefully scrutiny (unless the author twists
a colleague's arm to do so) as would be the case for a published journal
article (if the referee does his or her job) or a thesis (if the
committee does its job).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; For example,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Edward Winter, considered by many the world's leading chess historian
&gt; and a
&gt;&gt;&gt; writer with a reputation for painstaking accuracy, mixed up the
&gt;&gt;&gt; International Correspondence Chess Federation and FIDE in an essay, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; claimed FIDE awards correspondence chess titles. Dr. John Hilbert,
&gt; winner of
&gt;&gt;&gt; many awards for his chess history writing, managed to print two
&gt; different
&gt;&gt;&gt; versions of a game between Napier and Marshall in his biographies of
&gt; these
&gt;&gt;&gt; two players. Dr. Vlastimil Fiala has managed to cite both Philadelphia
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; Pittsburgh as the capitol of Pennsylvania (Harrisburg would be correct).
&gt; My
&gt;&gt;&gt; home state's geography claimed another victim this week, as Tim
&gt; Harding's
&gt;&gt;&gt; otherwise facinating Chess Cafe article on the Cambridge Springs 1904
&gt;&gt;&gt; tournament described Cambridge Springs as &quot;close to Philadelphia&quot;. For
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;close to&quot; read &quot;400 miles from&quot;.
&gt;&gt; Those are indeed rather amazing examples. However, is it perhaps the
&gt;&gt; case that chess history as it is currently practiced lies somewhere in
&gt;&gt; between journalism and the more &quot;academic&quot; areas of history?
&gt; Yes, it does fall in between the two. I only know of four chess historians -
&gt; Richard Forster, John Donaldson, Olimpiu Urcan, and Dr. Vlastimil Fiala -
&gt; who have training as a historian, and only Dr. Fiala has a Phd. Urcan is
&gt; preparing a doctoral thesis on the history of chess in Singapore, which may
&gt; be the first thesis using chess history as its subject.
&gt;&gt; This query
&gt;&gt; is by no means intended to disparage journalism, but articles in the
&gt;&gt; popular press dealing with specialized topics (especially scientific
&gt;&gt; ones) are often penned by journalists who have little or no training or
&gt;&gt; expertise in the subject, but who have hurriedly conducted research for
&gt;&gt; the purpose of the article on which they are working; moreover, such
&gt;&gt; articles are generally approved by an editor who probably also lacks
&gt;&gt; specialized expertise in the article's subject. Such articles may
&gt;&gt; contain egregious factual errors and fundamental misunderstandings, as
&gt;&gt; some of the popular accounts of the authorship &quot;question&quot; have recently
&gt;&gt; demonstrated.
&gt; Agreed, although most chess history writers are better than your description
&gt; of journalism. At least, I like to think that I rise above it.

"/>

I don't doubt it. Nor should my description be taken to apply to
*all* journalism by any means. Rather, I'm just noting that by its very
nature as unspecialized and popular, journalism has the potential for
such errors.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh so true, Lynne. Should we share horror stories here, or in email?
&gt;&gt; I vote for here! Please? This could be a most interesting thread.
&gt; If you like, Dr. Webb, I will provide examples from my own work:

&gt; In an article on chess in San Quentin prison in 1916, I moved the prison
&gt; away from the coast. This same article featured some careless proofreading
&gt; on my part.

&gt; In an article on the 1943 PSCF Championship, despite having six people
&gt; review the article, the name of a well-known Grandmaster was spelled
&gt; incorrectly.

&gt; That same article, when it appeared in Quarterly for Chess History, had the
&gt; game headings changed to &quot;Philadelphia&quot; from &quot;Pittsburgh&quot;.

&gt; In a recent article on the 1860 Japanese Embassy to the US, and their visit
&gt; to the Philadelphia Chess Club, I included an amusing typo when quoting a
&gt; Walt Whitman poem. I wrote &quot;prices&quot; for &quot;princes&quot;.

"/>

Thanks. Most of these I would call unfortunate oversights rather
than full-blown humiliating howlers, but I fully understand that to a
careful writer, any oversight or lapse is cause for acute embarrassment,
whether or not others view it as serious.

Dr. We, err, David, you have nothing to fear from the FBI. According to a
newly arrived poster here at HLAS (one guess who), the FBI was reading my
newsgroup postings at one time:

&quot;The FBI are monitoring this thread [and others] because of of a certain
incidence of Neil Brennen's abuse stimulating much more acuitous ones from
anons. The particular threas that you continue to initiate or make
contributrions to, then participate in by suggestive abuse, involve actions
against female members of my family.

&quot;The FBI will possibly in touch with you Brennen; for your own expressions
seem to inexplicably engender abuse of others (not only myself). But for
myself, I simply offer you the reflection that their are sharper things than
wit.

&quot;And if you fuck with me and mine I will certainly make entirely sure you
understand me without a shadow of a doubt. I am possibly over my
petit-fascist tolerancing line. Is this sufficiently clear?

&quot;Brennen- you fail to understand - you have booked yourself a date!

&quot;Hang on for a month or two if you can, and eventually I'll make it down and
visit you where you are and we'll get things entirely clear between us.

&quot;This is not, as you realise, the proverbial threat, but an absolutely solid
promise of response to continuous provocation against myself and my family.

&quot;If you want to accelerate the encounter, come. Go ahead, make my day.

&quot;I am prepared to visit you to discuss our differences - what do you say to
that? You can be up front about it here or simply wait until I show
up. If you are at all alarmed at the potential threat of this message I
suggest you contact the FBI.&quot;

I'm going to guess that Rips' now-debunked algorithm

An earlier paper in the same collaboration was submitted to a Swiss
journal; we received an enthusiastic referees' report, so we awaited
only the page proofs to correct. However, we had a rather long wait.
Finally, out of the blue, one of my colleagues received a breathless
phone call from a woman in a small town in the northeast; it seems that
a tourist friend of hers, while visiting Switzerland, had mailed her one
of the usual picturesque Swiss souvenir calendars featuring glittering
glaciers, contented cows grazing in Alpine meadows, Heidi-style
shepherds' huts, etc, and when she opened the envelope containing her
calendar, our page proofs fell out. Her husband *immediately* suspected
espionage and was all set to call the FBI (although why our supposedly
*importing* putative technical secrets from Switzerland should have
raised red flags is far from clear); fortunately, my colleague was able
to allay their misgivings, call off her overzealous husband, and
retrieve our lost page proofs. (How the proofs ended up in her calendar
I have no idea.)

&gt; Finally, out of the blue, one of my colleagues received a breathless
&gt; phone call from a woman in a small town in the northeast; it seems that
&gt; a tourist friend of hers, while visiting Switzerland, had mailed her one
&gt; of the usual picturesque Swiss souvenir calendars featuring glittering
&gt; glaciers, contented cows grazing in Alpine meadows, Heidi-style
&gt; shepherds' huts, etc, and when she opened the envelope containing her
&gt; calendar, our page proofs fell out. Her husband *immediately* suspected
&gt; espionage and was all set to call the FBI (although why our supposedly
&gt; *importing* putative technical secrets from Switzerland should have
&gt; raised red flags is far from clear); fortunately, my colleague was able
&gt; to allay their misgivings, call off her overzealous husband, and
&gt; retrieve our lost page proofs. (How the proofs ended up in her calendar
&gt; I have no idea.)

It reminds me of a James Thurber quotation. Quoting from memory, I think it
runs: &quot;I heard my neighbor say that Canada was bigger than the United
States, so I called the FBI.&quot;

&gt;&gt; I prefer to view the episode as the publisher's pratfall. However,
&gt;&gt; on another occasion I'm told that I barely avoided being investigated by
&gt;&gt; the FBI for espionage in even more ridiculous circumstances, so perhaps
&gt;&gt; I should not complain.
&gt; I'm going to guess that Rips' now-debunked algorithm
&gt; predicted the assassination of a US president--that satisifes
&gt; 'ridiculous circumstances,'-- and you, as Rips' Russian
&gt; translator, were picked up on the radar.

Elizabeth has evidently been hallucinating again. I am not &quot;Rips'
Russian translator [sic]&quot;; rather, I wrote out a translation of one of
Rips's early samizdat articles as a favor to a curious mathematical
colleague and friend.

That depends upon what you mean. Certainly you have an overheated
imagination. I'm told that certain psychotropic drugs also raise the
body's core temperature.

Elizabeth has evidently been hallucinating again. I have never
expressed any belief that algorithms can &quot;predict the future.&quot; Nor does
Rips make such an extravagant claim, as Elizabeth would know if she had
actually read Rips's paper rather than merely trying to divine its
content by creative hallucination, or (as in the case of Akrigg) from
its appearance in a bibliography.

&quot;PUBLIC STATEMENT BY DR. ELIYAHU RIPS Professor of Mathematics Hebrew
University Jerusalem, Israel

[...]

&quot;6) For me, it [Drosnin's tableau] was a catalyst to ask whether we
can, from a scientific point of view, attempt to use the Codes to
predict future events. After much thought, my categorical answer is
no.  All attempts to extract messages from Torah codes, or to make
predictions based on them, are futile and are of no value. This is
not only my own opinion, but the opinion of every scientist who has
been involved in serious Codes research.&quot;

&lt;&gt;

But all this has been pointed out to Elizabeth before. In another post,
Elizabeth admits an inability to &quot;proof read&quot;; clearly, the word &quot;proof&quot;
was superfluous.
