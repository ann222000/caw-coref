ARLINGTON, Va. -- Arlington County police said three attacks on women
under investigation may be related.

In the most recent attack, someone attempted to abduct a woman in the
Virginia Square neighborhood, police said. At about 2:40 a.m. on
Thursday, a woman was walking alone in the 4000 block of Washington
Boulevard when she heard someone running behind her. A man tried to
put a plastic bag over her head, but she pushed the bag away and
fought back. The man immediately fled.

At about 11:30 p.m. on April 16, a woman was walking to her car in the
1400 block of North Nash Street in Rosslyn when she was attacked from
behind.

Police said a man put a plastic bag over her face and tried to pull
her backward. The victim turned, screamed and hit the man with her
handbag.

The attacker fled in that incident, as well.

Police said those two attacks may be related to a March 5 incident in
which a man approached a woman from behind in the 1500 block of North
Key Boulevard in Rosslyn and groped her.

The attacker fled when the victim turned to confront him.

On Tuesday, Arlington police issued a warning.

&quot;Really, the thing that jumps out at us about these three incidents is
that the victims were all women that were walking alone, and walking
alone after dark, so what we're asking people to do is to really be
more cautious, &quot; said Officer John Lisle. &quot;If you can avoid walking
alone, especially after dark, that would really be advisable. Also try
to stay in well-lit areas, and just be aware of your surroundings.&quot;

Police described the attacker as a black man in his 20s standing 5
feet 10 inches to 6 feet tall with a medium build, light-to-medium
complexion and a clean-shaven face.
Anyone with information about the cases or any similar attacks should
call police at 703-228-4193. If there is another, let's hope it's a
lady with the sense to carry a weapon and put an end to these
assaults.

ARLINGTON, Va. -- Police are investigating the possibility that the
person responsible for two recent gropings is the same man who
committed four plastic bag attacks earlier this year, WTOP has
learned.

In the most recent attacks -- which occurred in the past two nights --
the women were walking from the Rosslyn Metro station when a man
approached them, and groped them from behind.

Arlington County Police Detective Robert Icolari says the suspect
bears a physical resemblance to the man police identified as a suspect
in the plastic bag attacks, which ended in June.

In those attacks, the suspect tried to put a plastic bag over the
women's head before groping them.

No plastic bags were used or found in the two most recent attacks.
