We should let people in retirement homes monitor surveillance cameras. Idea Rank = 33% $

The Problem:

Inactivity for the elderly, and the need for constant monitoring of CCTV cameras...

The Social Invention:

This will let those in retirement homes report crime, give them something to do, and let them make money.

In this way, it could be a win-win solution for all concerned: creating work, reducing inactivity and mental stagnancy, and effectively monitoring crime hotspots.

Reasons to disagree:

Let's just give people back the right to carry guns, instead of paying for CCTVs and &quot;monitors.&quot; It's great that you want to video tape the robbery and have someone call the cops who always get there too late...even better to have the victim shoot the attacker...He won't try it again. And attackers knowing that people are allowed to carry guns deter them, because they don't know who doesn't have a gun. (Posted by justice@hand)

I assume old people in homes are not so well - otherwise they'd be out and about. So would they have to appear in court to identify the criminal?

Reasons to disagree:

Every old person on the planet may not want to do this, but that doesn't mean no one would. If the elderly can watch TV they could do this. They wouldn't have to go to court. Have you ever seen a security camera? They record what happens. When I go into a store, I see lots of camera's, and I think, man, they would need like 10 people to monitor all of these camera's. All the old people would have to do is say which camera is see someone pickpocket, and then they would just push a button. The manager could then review the tape, call the police, or get the security guard.
