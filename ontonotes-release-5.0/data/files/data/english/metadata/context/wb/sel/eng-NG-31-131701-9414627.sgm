I don't know if they're the greatest team yet, but they sure as hell
have the greatest QB. The guy has to have three sets of eyeballs.

Yes, congrutulations!

Now comes the hard part.  They aren't invinsible, as last night showed.
There is the very old and reliable addage:

Defense wins in the playoffs.

Glad the Giants put up a fight.  Much better year than expected, despite the
usual second half collapse (until last night) by their QB.

Good game last night, and a good run by the Patriots.  The Giants
surprised me by playing their starters (other than the two guys who
got injured) the whole way and by playing well and keeping it close.
Their clock management in the last few minutes was poor but since they
didn't recover the onside kick it didn't matter.  I thought it was
funny that the NFL Network announcers praised the Patriots for
excellent special teams play allowing them to cover the onside kick -
doesn't it generally require excellent special teams play for the
kicking team to recover an onside kick?  You pretty much expect the
receiving team to recover, you're just hoping to get lucky.

Moss and Brady were awesome (although Jerry Rice having 22 touchdowns
in 12 games remains incredible).

&gt; oh yeah?  let's see how well they'd do if they faced the 1985 Bears! #
">

The 85 Bears were a one-hit wonder. The 07 Pats are an upgraded and
revamped version of a multi-Superbowl winning team. The Pats might not
win the Super Bowl but those Bears would be doing very well to finish
8-8 in the modern NFL. Now that they know how to let players juice
themselves from 260 to 330 without apparently violating their tough-
talking drug policy, the NFL has the best of both worlds.

The Bears had a very fine running game, an inspiring but basically
mediocre quarterback and a decent defense, especially when the Fridge,
at best a part-time player, was not in the game. They would lose to
today's BEARS, let alone today's winning teams.

How in the HELL did Rice get 22 TDs in 12 games??  It wasn't
replacement players, right?

Both records being broken on the same play with a bomb, was pretty

The Giants did themselves proud last night and proved that if Eli
plays smart and the defense plays inspired, they can in fact hang with
anyone.  I have to think that helps them going into the playoffs.

16-0 is hardly meaningless.  They can only play the games they have on
their schedule, and while winning the Superbowl is the ultimate goal

this season's incredible individual and team acheivments are hardly

As the game turned out, I disagree. I think the fact that the Giants,
especially Manning and the offense, played well against maybe the best
team in history can only help their confidence going into the
playoffs. And had they actually won the game, that would have been
doubly so. Of course, it was a bit of a gamble because if they played
to win and got blown out, their confidence would have been shattered.
But I think it was worth the risk.

I also believe that resting players is overrated unless you're talking
about injured players who will benefit from the time off. With teams
rotating players in and out these days based on game situations,
pretty much everybody on the roster is a contributor, so who do you
rest and who replaces them? And you can't tell the guys who are
playing to just take it easy, because when the other team is playing
all out and you're not, that's when you will get hurt.

Those Dolphin teams should go back and take a look at the schedule
they played. I believe the opposing teams during the regular season
had a winning percentage of somewhere around 35% or less. The Pats
schedule was much, much tougher even though their division was weak.

You obviously didn't see the last few games before this one. The
Giants are clearly not a Super Bowl contender, but despite the blown
lead and less than stellar defense, the bottom line is they still only
lost by three. They certainly showed that they at least belong on the
same field with the best team of all time.

So do you want every starter to sit out the entire game so they don't
get hurt? Then where do you find 22+ guys to play the game? And they'd
have to play the entire game because after all, if a starter plays
even one down he could get hurt.

Again, a loss in the playoffs will certainly tarnish the Pats season,

it? That's right, none. This is just another reflection of the

Either you win the championship or you're a bum.

Sorry, but I believe it is possible to have a great team and a great
season without winning it all. There are more than a few who credibly
argue that the '76 Steelers were the best team of all time despite the
fact that they didn't even make it to the Super Bowl (they lost to
Oakland, largely because neither Harris nor Bleier played due to
injuries).

&gt;&gt;&gt; I also believe that resting players is overrated unless you're talking
&gt;&gt;&gt; about injured players who will benefit from the time off. With teams
&gt;&gt;&gt; rotating players in and out these days based on game situations,
&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty much everybody on the roster is a contributor, so who do you
&gt;&gt;&gt; rest and who replaces them? And you can't tell the guys who are
&gt;&gt;&gt; playing to just take it easy, because when the other team is playing
&gt;&gt;&gt; all out and you're not, that's when you will get hurt.

&gt;&gt;And, before we forget too quickly, the Pats played everybody in a
&gt;&gt;meaningless week 17 game last year, Rodney Harrison got broken, missed the
&gt;&gt;entire playoffs and quite possibly (or even probably?) the Pats would have
&gt;&gt;gone to the Super Bowl w/o that injury.

&gt; So do you want every starter to sit out the entire game so they don't
&gt; get hurt? Then where do you find 22+ guys to play the game? And they'd
&gt; have to play the entire game because after all, if a starter plays
&gt; even one down he could get hurt.
">

Not at all, but when you've got guys who are obviously nowhere near 100%,
and your goal as a team is to beat Tampa next week, why does Plaxico Burress
play the entire game against the Pats? Why does Brandon Jacobs play the
entire game? It's week 17, the game means exactly zippo to your team's
postseason chances, why not give the most banged up of your players a week
off so that they are in top shape for the game that actually counts?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not bad for a bunch of &quot;cheaters&quot;###########

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good game last night, and a good run by the Patriots.  The Giants
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; surprised me by playing their starters (other than the two guys who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; got injured) the whole way and by playing well and keeping it close.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah, how dumb is that? The Giants should have been 100% focused on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;beating
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Tampa next weekend. They certainly would have benefitted more from a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;week
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rest than a meaningless victory... The Pats I can understand playing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;starters, since they have a bye week next weekend anyway...

&gt;&gt;&gt; As the game turned out, I disagree. I think the fact that the Giants,
&gt;&gt;&gt; especially Manning and the offense, played well against maybe the best
&gt;&gt;&gt; team in history can only help their confidence going into the
&gt;&gt;&gt; playoffs.

&gt;&gt;Hmmm. They blew a 12pt 2nd half lead, gave up 22 in a row and Manning
&gt;&gt;looked
&gt;&gt;lost out there down the stretch. If that's a confidence builder, that team
&gt;&gt;is in more trouble than I previously thought next week...

&gt; You obviously didn't see the last few games before this one. The
&gt; Giants are clearly not a Super Bowl contender,
">

Oh come on. They play in the NFC. It's not as if the Packers and Cowboys are
world-beaters. While certainly no one expects the Giants to make it to the
Super Bowl, I don't think anyone would be surprised if the Packers or
Cowboys lost in a one-and-done scenario to any of those NFC playoff teams...
If that happens, it is anybody's guess who comes out of that mishmash...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but despite the blown
&gt; lead and less than stellar defense, the bottom line is they still only
&gt; lost by three. They certainly showed that they at least belong on the
&gt; same field with the best team of all time.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 16-0 is hardly meaningless.  They can only play the games they have on
&gt;&gt;&gt; their schedule, and while winning the Superbowl is the ultimate goal
&gt;&gt;&gt; (and one the Patriots have repeatedly insisted is their ONLY goal),
&gt;&gt;&gt; this season's incredible individual and team acheivments are hardly
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;meaningless&quot;.

&gt;&gt;Well, certainly the individual achievements are damn near the definition
&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;meaningless. It's a team sport. It's nice for Moss' contract negotiations,
&gt;&gt;but the individual achievements in and of themselves mean nothing.

&gt; Yeah, football is a team game (as are many others) and wins and losses
&gt; are always the most important stats, but you can't honestly tell me
&gt; that great individual performances are meaningless, can you? After
&gt; all, team results are based in large part on those individual
&gt; performances.
">

The only thing that counts at this point is the team as a whole earning the
#1 seed in the AFC. Can anyone honestly tell me that they knew who held
whatever records these people broke? There are a handful of seminal NFL
individual records that anyone really knows about, and even then, it is just
for show. What counts at the end of the season is the Super Bowl champion.
Brady could have completed 4 passes for 12 yards the whole season long and
if the Pats had the #1 seed in the AFC at the end of the season he done did
his job right.

No, it ain't about either you win a championship or a bum... It is about

You can have a good season and/or be a good team without winning it all.
Look at Minnesota. If they make the playoffs, they've had a good season and
they will have built the foundation for future success. But the goal for the
franchise is to build up to the level where they can make several runs at
winning a Super Bowl. This type of year for them is merely a step along the
road.

Now take San Diego for instance. Last year, they had the best record in the
league, the culmination in a couple of years worth of a buildup to get to
that level and they underperformed in the playoffs and petered out when it
counted. 13-3 or whatever they were in the regular season, 0-1 in the
playoffs. Think there is anyone even remotely associated with that franchise
that thinks that wasn't a disappointing season? But, they're back in the
playoffs this year, and if they can use the experience they gained from last
year's disappointment and take the next step, then the disappointing end to
last year's season is somewhat redeemed. Colts last year are the perfect
example. Several disappointing seasons in a row (despite winning their
divisions and gaining some home field here and there and having &quot;success&quot;),
but it wasn't until they took the next step and actually finished the job
that they earned greatness.

Now this Pats team has already won Super Bowls, so its not like anyone
doubts the greatness of this team and this franchise, but part of being a
great team is finishing the job. If the Pats go 19-0, there is no doubt in
my mind that they will rightfully be in the conversation for the best team
of all time. Until then, all they have accomplished so far is gaining the #1
seed in the AFC and a handful of other sideshow records.

It really is all about winning championships.

&gt; oh yeah?  let's see how well they'd do if they faced the 1985 Bears! #

&gt; Peace,

">

In 1972, Miami won 6 games by 10 or fewer points, won 3 games by 4 or
fewer points, outscored their opponents 55-38 in the playoffs, and won
the Super Bowl.

In 1985, Chicago won 5 games by 10 or fewer points, won no games by 4
or fewer points, outscored their opponents 91-10 in the playoffs with
two shutouts, and won the Super Bowl, but they lost one regular season
game.

So far this year, New England won 5 games by 10 or fewer points and
won 4 games by 4 or fewer points.

Conclusion: If New England wins the Super Bowl, a case could be made
for any of these 3 teams.  Chicago would be the greatest if not for
their one loss.  If the Pats dominate in the playoffs the way the
Bears did, I'd say the Pats would have to be considered the best of
all time.  However, that's a big &quot;if.&quot;  And if the Pats don't win the
Super Bowl, the discussion is over.

50 touchdowns against 8 picks. McNabb was the first to break the
30+/-10 barrier with 31/8 and this obliterates that. Used to be
Peyton's got the stats, but Tom's got the rings. Now Brady's being a

It was a five point lead at the half (the Giants scored on their first
possession of the third quarter to make it 12) and Manning had
problems on two series - the three and out sequence that started with
a fumbled snap and the interception.  He looked pretty cool down the
stretch trying to score a TD (which he did).  I would have liked to
see a little more urgency from the whole offense on their last
possession because they bled too much time but ultimately that didn't
matter.

And the team that scored 22 points in a row was the Patriots, after

&gt;&gt; Their clock management in the last few minutes was poor but since they

&gt;&gt; doesn't it generally require excellent special teams play for the
&gt;&gt; kicking team to recover an onside kick?  You pretty much expect the
&gt;&gt; receiving team to recover, you're just hoping to get lucky.

&gt;&gt; Moss and Brady were awesome (although Jerry Rice having 22 touchdowns
&gt;&gt; in 12 games remains incredible).

&gt;How in the HELL did Rice get 22 TDs in 12 games??  It wasn't
&gt;replacement players, right?
">

Right - there were 15 games in the '87 season, replacements were used
in 3 of them.  Rice didn't cross the picket line so he only played in
the 12 games with all regular players.  I don't remember a whole lot
of detail on the '87 season but Rice must have played out of his mind.
That's almost 2 touchdowns per game, unreal.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Both records being broken on the same play with a bomb, was pretty

&gt;The Giants did themselves proud last night and proved that if Eli

&gt;anyone.  I have to think that helps them going into the playoffs.
">

I think the offense should have a big confidence boost - they put up
35 on the Patriots (okay, 7 from a kickoff return), Eli threw four
TDs, Jacobs ran fairly well and Kevin Boss looks like a reasonable
replacement for Shockey.  The defense had too many lapses, although it
was against the Patriots who have scored on everybody, of course.  It
was the most points scored on the Pats all year.

The injuries to O'Hara, Mitchell and Madison are a concern, not sure
if they'll be out next week or not.  O'Hara would have been playing
either way, you typically don't &quot;rest&quot; your center.

It was no dumber for the Giants to treat it like a regular season game
and not rest starters than it was for the Patriots.  The Patriots
should be focused on the playoffs, not 16-0, right?

Overall, I'm okay with the decision (by both teams) to play it like a
regular game.  I'm not a big believer in the &quot;don't take any chances
at all with your starters&quot; philosophy when your playoff position is
set.  I'd rather see the players keep their rhythm and keep in game
shape than try to turn the switch back on after a week of not really
playing.

Yes, that didn't matter, because they wasted at least 1 TO and over

Add that to the two wasted possessions that you referred to and the
possession prior to that when he took a pretty bad 14yd sack, and
beyond that first drive of the 2nd half, Eli did very little to help

The big difference in football is that a single individual has a
lesser impact on the game than in other sports.  In basketball one
player can literally carry a team through the playoffs (LeBron James,
for instance).  In baseball, a dominant pitcher can make all the
difference in a playoff series.  A hot goalie in hockey can win a
Stanley cup for a team.  A great quarterback alone can't win a Super
Bowl (ask Dan Marino), same goes for a great running back, great
receiver, great linebacker, etc.  Sure, for a given game one
individual can dominate and be the &quot;reason&quot; his team wins but it
doesn't hold up over the long haul of a season or playoff run.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not bad for a bunch of &quot;cheaters&quot;###########

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good game last night, and a good run by the Patriots.  The Giants
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; surprised me by playing their starters (other than the two guys who
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; got injured) the whole way and by playing well and keeping it close.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah, how dumb is that? The Giants should have been 100% focused on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;beating
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Tampa next weekend. They certainly would have benefitted more from a week
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;rest than a meaningless victory... The Pats I can understand playing their
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;starters, since they have a bye week next weekend anyway...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As the game turned out, I disagree. I think the fact that the Giants,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; especially Manning and the offense, played well against maybe the best
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; team in history can only help their confidence going into the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; playoffs.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Hmmm. They blew a 12pt 2nd half lead, gave up 22 in a row and Manning looked
&gt;&gt; &gt;lost out there down the stretch. If that's a confidence builder, that team
&gt;&gt; &gt;is in more trouble than I previously thought next week...

&gt;&gt; It was a five point lead at the half (the Giants scored on their first
&gt;&gt; possession of the third quarter to make it 12)

&gt;Right, a 12pt 2nd half lead.
">

My bad, for some reason I read your statement as a 12 point halftime
lead, obviously I was mistaken.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; and Manning had
&gt;&gt; problems on two series - the three and out sequence that started with
&gt;&gt; a fumbled snap and the interception.  He looked pretty cool down the
&gt;&gt; stretch trying to score a TD (which he did).  I would have liked to
&gt;&gt; see a little more urgency from the whole offense on their last
&gt;&gt; possession because they bled too much time but ultimately that didn't
&gt;&gt; matter.

&gt;Yes, that didn't matter, because they wasted at least 1 TO and over
&gt;30seconds on that last drive, which is the equivalent of another TO.

&gt;Add that to the two wasted possessions that you referred to and the
&gt;possession prior to that when he took a pretty bad 14yd sack, and
&gt;beyond that first drive of the 2nd half, Eli did very little to help
&gt;his team.
">

Throwing a touchdown pass to get within three doesn't help your team?

Overall, Eli played a good game, the loss can hardly be pinned on him.
When your team scores 35 you should win, I blame the defense much more
than Eli.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And I'm generally an Eli supporter...

&gt;&gt; And the team that scored 22 points in a row was the Patriots, after
&gt;&gt; all.

&gt;Not sure exactly what you're saying here, but, um, yes... I agree.
">

All I'm saying is the Patriots have the most prolific offense in the
history of the NFL (you're aware of that, right?  Or is that another
stat you've managed to avoid?).  They've scored in bunches on
virtually everybody this year, giving up a bunch of points in a row to
the Patriots isn't the same as, say, giving up 22 straight points to
the Jets.  Although I'm still disappointed, obviously.

&gt;&gt;Now take San Diego for instance. Last year, they had the best record in
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;league, the culmination in a couple of years worth of a buildup to get to
&gt;&gt;that level and they underperformed in the playoffs and petered out when it
&gt;&gt;counted. 13-3 or whatever they were in the regular season, 0-1 in the
&gt;&gt;playoffs. Think there is anyone even remotely associated with that
&gt;&gt;franchise
&gt;&gt;that thinks that wasn't a disappointing season?

&gt; Well, Marty is no longer coaching the team but at the time I'm
&gt; guessing he thought it was a very successful season as he appears to
&gt; believe the playoffs only last one round and the goal isn't to win in
&gt; them.

Heh.
