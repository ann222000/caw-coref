Dangerous?
Contempt for Truth?
Sadistic?
No Shame ?
Where Does This Leave Us?
His certitude that he is right gives him carte blanche for destructive
behavior..We are left with a president who cannot actually govern,

George W. Bush seems to be without shame. He expresses no regret or
embarrassment about his failure to help Katrina victims, or to tell
the truth. He says whatever he thinks people want to hear, whether it
be &quot;stay the course&quot; or &quot;I've never been about 'stay the course.'&quot; He
does whatever he wants.

He lies-not just to us, but to himself as well. What makes lying so
easy for Bush is his contempt-for language, for law, and for anybody
who dares question him.

That he could say so baldly that he'd never been about &quot;stay the
course&quot; is bone chilling. So his words mean nothing. That is very
important for people to understand.

Fear of Humiliation

Despite having no shame, Bush has a profound fear of failure and
humiliation. He defends himself from this by any means at his disposal-
most frequently with indifference or contempt.

He will flinch only if directly confronted about being a failure or a
liar. Otherwise world events are enough removed from him that he can
spin them into his intact defense system.

This deep fear helps to explain his relentlessly escalating attacks on
others, his bullying, and his use of nicknames to put people down.
There is fear of being found out not to be as big in every way as his
father.

What a burden to have to face his many inadequacies-now held up to the
light of day-whether it is his difficulty in speaking, thinking,
reading, managing anxiety, or making good decisions. He will not
change, because for him change means humiliating collapse. He is very
fearful of public exposure of his many inadequacies.

Contempt for Truth?

Contempt itself is a defense, a form of self-protection, which helps
Bush appear at ease and relaxed-at least to big fans like New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

The president's contempt defense protects his belief system, a system
he clings to as if his beliefs were well-researched facts. His
pathology is a patchwork of false beliefs and incomplete information
woven into what he asserts is the whole truth.

What gets lost in this process is growth-the George W. Bush of 2007 is
exactly the same as the one of 2001. Helen Thomas has said that of all
the presidents she has covered over the years, Bush is the least
changed by his job, by his experience. This is why there is no
possibility of dialogue or reasoning with him.

Sadistic

His certitude that he is right gives him carte blanche for destructive
behavior. He has always had a sadistic streak: from blowing up frogs,
to shooting his siblings with a b-b-gun, to branding fraternity
pledges with white-hot coat hangers.

His comfort with cruelty is one reason he can be so jocular with
reporters when talking about American casualties in Iraq. Instead of
seeing a president in anguish, we watch him publicly joking about the
absence of &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; in Iraq, in the vain search
for which so many young Americans died.

Break It!

Bush likes to break things, needs to break things. And this is most
shockingly seen in how he is systematically destroying our armed
forces.

In the early days of the Iraq invasion he refused to approve the large
number of troop the generals said were needed in order to try to
invade and pacify Iraq and acquiesced in the firing of any general who
disagreed.

He turned a blind eye to giving the troops proper equipment and cut
funding for needed health care. Health care and other social programs
have one thing in common: they are paid for by public funds.

It may well be that, unconsciously, the government represents his
neglectful parents, and those helped by the government represent the
siblings he resents. If George W. Bush wanted to destroy his own
family, he could scarcely have done better. Thanks to him, no Bush is
likely to be elected to high office for generations to come.

Where Does This Leave Us?

It leaves us with a regressed president who needs to protect himself
more than ever from diminishment, humiliation, and collapse. He is so
busy trying to manage his own anxiety that he has little capacity left
to attend to national and world problems.

And so, we are left with a president who cannot actually govern,
because he is incapable of reasoned thought in coping with events
outside his control, like those in the Middle East.

This makes it a monumental challenge-as urgent as it is difficult-not
only to get him to stop the carnage in the Middle East, but also to
prevent him from undertaking a new, perhaps even more disastrous
adventure-like going to war with Iran, in order to embellish the image
he so proudly created for himself after 9/11 as the commander in chief
of &quot;the first war of the 21st century.&quot;

Iran would make number three-all the compelling reasons against it
notwithstanding

Contingencies:

We will now attempt to put flesh on the discussion by positing and
examining scenarios that would force Bush to react, and applying the
observations above and other data to forecast what form that reaction
might take.

Outlined below are three illustrative contingencies, each of which
would pose a neuralgic threat to George W. Bush's shaky self-esteem,
his over-determined efforts to stave off humiliation, and his unending
need for self-protection.

These are not seat-of-the-pants scenarios. Each of them is possible-
arguably, even probable. The importance of coming up with educated
guesses regarding Bush's response BEFORE they occur is, we hope,
clear.

Scenario A: Destructive Attack on the Green Zone

The U.S. military is out in front of Defense Secretary Robert Gates
and other policymakers in Washington in seeing the hand of Iran's
government behind &quot;the enemy&quot; in Iraq.

On July 26, the operational commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, Lt. Gen.
Raymond Odierno, blamed the recent &quot;significant improvement&quot; in the
accuracy of mortar and rocket attacks on the Green Zone on &quot;training
conducted inside Iran.&quot; Odierno also repeated that roadside bombs are
being smuggled into Iraq from Iran.

Last week, Gen. David Petraeus warned that insurgents intend to &quot;pull
off a variety of sensational attacks and grab the headlines to create
a 'mini-Tet.'&quot; (Tet refers to the surprise country-wide offensive
mounted by the Vietnamese Communists in early 1968, which indicated to
most Americans that the war was lost.)

Attacks on the Green Zone have doubled in recent months. Despite this,
the senior military appear to be in denial with respect to the
vulnerability of the Green Zone-oblivious even to the reality that
mortar rounds and rocket fire have little respect for walled enclaves.

Anyone with a mortar and access to maps and images on Google can
calibrate fire to devastating effect-with or without training in Iran.
It is just a matter of time before mortar round or rocket takes out
part of the spanking new $600-million U.S. embassy together with
people working there or nearby.

And/or, the insurgents could conceivably mount a multi-point assault
on the zone and gain control of a couple of buildings and take hostages
-perhaps including senior diplomats and military officers.

Given what we think we know of George Bush, if there were an
embarrassing attack on U.S. installations in the Green Zone or some
other major U.S. facility, he would immediately order a retaliatory
series of air strikes, and let the bombs and missiles fall where they
may.

The reaction would come from deep within and would warn, in effect:
This is what you get if you try to make me look bad.

Scenario B: Israeli Attack on Nuclear Targets in Iran.

This would be madness and would elicit counterattacks from an Iran
with many viable options for significant retaliation. Nevertheless,
Sen. Joe Lieberman (D, Conn) and his namesake Avigdor Lieberman,
Israel's minister of strategic affairs, are openly calling for such
strikes, which would have to be on much more massive a scale than
Israel's bombing of Iraq's nuclear reactor at Osirak in 1981.

For that attack in 1981, Cheney, a great fan of preemptive strikes,
congratulated the Israelis, even though the U.S. joined other UN
Security Council members in unanimously condemning the Israeli attack.

Five years ago, on Aug. 26, 2002, Cheney became the first U.S.
official publicly to refer approvingly to the bombing of Osirak. And
in an interview two and a half years ago, on Inauguration Day 2005,
Cheney referred nonchalantly to the possibility that &quot;the Israelis
might well decide to act first [to eliminate Iran's nuclear
capabilities] and let the rest of the world worry about cleaning up
the diplomatic mess afterwards.&quot;

One thing Cheney says is indisputably-if myopically-true: Bush has
been Israel's best friend. In his speeches, he has fostered the false
impression that the U.S. is treaty-bound to defend Israel, should it
come under attack-as would be likely, were Israel to attack Iran.

With the U.S. Congress firmly in the Israeli camp, Cheney might see
little disincentive to giving a green-light wink to Israel and then
let the president &quot;worry about cleaning up.&quot;

Reporting from Seymour Hersh's administration sources serve to
strengthen the impression shining through Bush's speeches that he is
eager to strike Iran. But how to justify it?

Curiously, a National Intelligence Estimate on Iran's nuclear
capability, a study scheduled for completion early this year, has been
sent back several times-probably because its predictions are not as
alarmist as the warnings that Cheney and the Israelis are whispering
into the president's ear.

Senior U.S. military officers have warned against the folly of
attacking Iran, but Cheney has shown himself, time and time again,
able to overrule the military.

But What if Impeachment Begins?

Is there nothing to rein in Bush and Cheney? It seems likely that only
if impeachment proceedings were under way would senior
