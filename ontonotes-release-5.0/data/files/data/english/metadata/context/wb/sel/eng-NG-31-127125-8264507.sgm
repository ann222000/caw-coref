At the risk of being labeled a totally inept mechanic (now using the
term loosely), I came accross an oddity that I thought I should share
with the SV listserv.  I decided to switch from the Shogun sliders
which mount towards the front of the frame with two bolts to the
Motosliders that mount closer to center with one bolt.  When I removed
the stock bolt I noticed a significant amount of corrosion/residue on
the bolt.  I decided to clean out the hole to keep the new bolt from
being exposed to the corrosion by running a paper towel with WD40 on
it.  Only problem is that the entire paper did not make it to the
other side when I pushed it through.  What goes in, must come out -
right?  Well, I noticed that there is a gap midway in the hole that
allowed part of the paper towel to get re-routed.  Does anyone know
where this gap goes?  And, do I need to retrieve the paper - more
importantly, if I need to retrieve it will I need to take the engine
apart?  This is driving me crazy as I try look up the diagrams to see
what role this gap plays in the function of the engine.  If anyone has
made similar observations (and hopefully did not attempt the same
technique), your input would be most appreciated.

Keep in mind this is coming from another mechanic with questionable
abilities, but I would not recommend leaving the paper towel in there.
My first thought for retrieval is to try a shop-vac pointed right at
the bolt hole.  The air moving through the hole may be enough to draw
the paper towel out.

Alternatively, you might try pressurized air. Even better if you can
find a hose that'll fit in the bolt hole. You might be able to use a
bendy-straw (technical term) to force the air in the channel. I would
thing there's an outlet for it though, otherwise it would collect
water?

Interesting. Here's the picture:
http://www.ronayers.com/fiche/300_0305/crankcase_model_k1_k2/crankcas...

The bolt (29) goes through the hole immediately in front of the rear cylinder
base mounting.

I don't see how the gap can connect to anything at all. There's no oil in there,
or coolant, or pressure, or vacuum.

What could it do, tucked away in there? I don't think you need to do anything.

Why don't you ask Zoran - he's had dozens (hundreds?) of these engines apart.
Let us know what he says...

Thanks for your comments to everyone.  I agree with Jim and found the
same diagram (thanks, Jim).  I tried the air pressure idea, but not
the vacuum.  If that doesn't produce anything, I will try to ignore
it.

I would love to get the famous Zoran's opinion, especially if he has
taken these motos apart.  I looked at Micapeak's website and was
unable to identify/find him.  I am registered in their SV registry
now.  I found a phone number in another listing here - is that the
only way to contact him?

Hello all,

I live in the Chicago area and have a silver '02 SVS
and love it and the community that has grown up around
these bikes.  I have lurked here for years and had
nothing that I felt was worth contributing.  So I
thought I would drop a line to the list about the
races coming to Indianapolis next year.  I for one am
going to be there.  Hope some others will be also.

Yes, I hope when they set this up, you're able to SEE the Track.

Unlike in the &quot;good 'ol days&quot; when spectating was fairly good all over at Laguna Seca, nowadays a good portion of the track is blocked by all kinds of special limited access grandstands and pavillions.

Unless you're a member of a this or that rider's/owner's club or pay a second tier fee to sit in a special pavillion or grandstand, you have to walk quite a distance up on the hillsides or else squeeze into one of a few limited view areas up along the fence in the infield turns to even see the race.

Anymore after they nick you pretty good just to get in, you can expect to be hit up again IF you want to see the race from a desireable vantage point.

I'm sure that the Brickyard will be a superior venue for the GP as far as
spectators are concerned but I can't think of a more boring track for that
level of racing compared to Laguna Seca's layout. This change should make
the majority of Yurrupean riders happy since they seem to feel so
disadvantaged when racing at Laguna.

Always nice to get new voices on the list...

From what I gathered on the MotoGP site, the Indy race will be
replacing an existing race, rather than adding another race to the
schedule, anyone know which circuit's going away?
San Marino, Portugal, and Japan races are all in Sept. I can't imagine
they'd cut Japan or Portugal...

I remember reading somewhere that this was the last year MotoGP would be
coming to Turkey, so perhaps this is the one Indy will replace.
