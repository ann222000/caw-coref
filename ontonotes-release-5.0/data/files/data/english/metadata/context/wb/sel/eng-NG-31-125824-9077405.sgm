I mostly use my Sky box to receive TV these days, and it's as good if
not better then the near perfect Analogue I used to get from CP.
however, although I get good Freeview reception there is still
occasional breakup of the picture and or sound.

Is this as good as it gets at the moment? or do those with optimized
aerial installations, double shielded downleads, oxegen free viewing
rooms etc get 100% reception of Freeview?

with a proper setup you wont get any breakup at all - no fancy cables
required.

If the break up you get is very occasional, it may be localised
interference, such as motorbikes or something.  This can be cured by
using decent shielded coax.  Also, we need to know where you are and
what your aerial set up is to give you a more accurate stab in the
dark :-)

The main problem I have with Freeview is when a load crows decide to
perch on the aerial, it doesn't do much for the reception. Puts me in

As I have seen crows perched on national grid lines, this technique might
not work.

OTOH there was a crow that wandered along BR 25kV catenaries in near Glasgow
in its early days.  When it got to a tunnel it demised suddenly and tripped
the power.

It took a long time for them to find a carbonised black crow in the mouth of
a tunnel, where it was by then acting as quite a good conductor all things
considered.

I get perfect Freeview (average 90% signal quality) in a fringe area about
35 miles south of Sutton Coldfield. It only ever pixellates when we get a
lift and Emley Moor comes romping in.
However, the XG10 E/W aerial is on a 16' mast with a low gain masthead
amplifier and PF100 cable, and we are high up and rural with very little
ambient noise or passing traffic.

Hi Marky,

I'm not actually looking to fix it at the moment - as I say, I don't
use the DTT much anyway.  Just wondered whether there was any
improvment to be had.  ie does anybody get better.

For the record, it's a fairly ancient aerial installation.

There are 4 aerials on the chimbley,  i've not been too close (regret
not doing so when we had some scaffolding up a few years ago)  but I
assume they are as follows largeish (18 element? (about a yard long))
Yagi on CP (approx 30 Miles North(ish) a smaller Yagi on Midhurst most
of what I assume is an FM aerial (the pigeons have knocked one of it's
elements off!) and another small Yagi on Midhurst which I assume is my
neighbours (Semi detached shared chimbley)

There are a couple of boxes up there, one red which I assume is a
Fringe Electronics active splitter, and possibly some kind of
combiner.  I have to feed 12V up the downlead I use which I presume
powers the Fringe device.  I've only ever picked up CP on the downlead
I use, so I suspect the other Yagi isn't connected to it.

There was miles of coax and a couple of multiway amps in the house
when we moved in, but I removed them without even checking what went
where.  I suspect a new downlead would improve matters, and if my only
option was DTT, then i'd probably make the investment.

The red box is most likely a mast head booster.

I get perfectly reliable DTT from Sandy Heath (8 miles away from me).
You are 30 miles from CP which is getting towards the edge of it's
coverage, particularly as you are to the south where the signal is
restricted more to reduce interference with France.  A nice new length
of co-ax  from aerial to TV (with no joins) may sort out the problem.
If you still need the amp, then keep that in place.

I can't be too far away from you, in the south part of Crawley, just behind
a low hill and a row of very close high trees - about 25 miles from CP.

I get almost perfect DTT reception from CP, maybe one very brief breakup
during a whole evening's viewing.  I put that down to the transmitter being
in direct line with the final approach path to Gatwick which means that, now
and again, a very large lump of metal just above the ground gets in the
wrong place.

This is based on what used to happen to some friends living in Calais. If
they were watching analogue from Dover (no DTT then), and a ferry sailed
past, the signal just vanished for a few seconds.

I've got several FreeView tuners and they're not all the same in this
respect. I've never experienced any break up on my main one which is a
Topfield PVR - which also happens to be the newest one. Or the Sony
VTX-D800 it replaced. The two low(ish) cost other tuners I have - Sagem
and Philips - are a different matter. As is my original OnDogey Philips.
The relatively low cost PC TV card I have too seems pretty bomb proof.

I'm in a high signal strength area from CP but with a pretty old (25 years
+) aerial and distribution system.

Even then, freeview bitrate is lower than satellite for some channels,
so 100% may not be 100% for the OP.
