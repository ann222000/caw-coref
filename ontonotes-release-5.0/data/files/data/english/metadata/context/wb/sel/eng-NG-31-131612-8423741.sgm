On the Elvis trail
Last Updated: 12:01am BST 28/07/2007Page 1 of 3

Thirty years after Elvis Presley's death, the pilgrims are heading to the Deep South in their tens of thousands. What is it that draws them? Andrew Perry went to see.

It took me less than 10 minutes to spot my first Elvis. It was 9pm, and I'd barely had time to check into my hotel on the main drag in Tupelo, Mississippi, when I saw him standing in the lobby, with his Arthur Scargill sweep-over dyed black, and each cheek plastered with enormous patches of black Fuzzy Felt. He sported a Hawaian shirt, whose roomy dimensions could not disguise his vast girth, and, of course, a pair of over-sized gold-rimmed sunglasses.

Thousands are making the pilgrimage to Tupelo to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Elvis Presley's death
The next morning, I encountered three more Elvises before breakfast. &quot;Did you see enough of 'em yet?&quot; asked a Southern lady in the lift, responding to my baffled expression. &quot;I just saw two downstairs, waiting for their food. I said: 'I hope y'all have ordered the fried pork chops!' They didn't seem to find that funny.&quot;

Over the next day or two in Tupelo - the real Elvis Presley's humble place of birth - there would be dozens more of these caricature-ish imposters to contend with.

I had been bussed there from Memphis airport, along with a large contingent from the European media, to sample the town's annual Elvis Festival, a contest for &quot;tribute artists&quot; (impersonators). The winner would represent Tupelo at a much bigger bash in Memphis in August, to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the death of the King of Rock'n'Roll.

Tupelo used to be best known for the devastating tornado that struck in 1936, killing 200 people and leaving thousands homeless; John Lee Hooker chronicled the disaster in one of his most haunting blues numbers, Tupelo.

Since 1955, the city has been known the world over for something more positive, if ultimately also tragic. Elvis-generated tourism now largely accounts for Tupelo's affluence and indeed, for the recent construction of the Hilton in which I stayed.

There are 100,000 visitors annually, but in this anniversary year the city expects that number between August 11 and 19 alone.

On the surface, the tribute artists represent a reassuringly old-school and organic brand of American craziness, but that impression quickly fades. In every store and on every street corner, I seemed to bump into an overweight man perspiring in a sequin-studded, white-nylon jumpsuit.

I watched an afternoon's worth of officially sanctioned tribute artistry in a stuffy conference hall, which was buzzing with a feverish and unpleasant air of reality-TV competitiveness. It was surely no coincidence that Lisa Marie Presley, the King's daughter, recently sold an 85 per cent share in Elvis Presley Enterprises Inc, to CKX, the company behind Pop Idol.

I found it depressing how many tributes presented a uniform, ritualised parody of Presley at his most grotesque - in his dying days in mid-1970s Las Vegas.

Why always Elvis the Blimp? Why not the dynamic, hip-shakin' blade who changed the world 20 years earlier? Surely he's the one that anniversary tourists will come looking for in August. The real Elvis trail begins in East Tupelo, at the two-room shotgun shack where Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935.

Preceding him into the world by 35 minutes was a stillborn brother, who was given the name Jesse Garon before being interred a couple of miles away at Priceville Cemetery. Elvis often talked about the brother he never knew, and his belief that a surviving twin gains the strength of both.

The shell of the original Presley shack has been filled with blousy imitation furnishings, including a double bed, an old stone ice box, and a framed version of Rudyard Kipling's aspirational poem If, which Presley memorised at an early age. After his death, a chapel and classy museum were erected nearby.

In pre-war days, East Tupelo was a separate and socially inferior town, on the wrong side of the tracks. Life there was simple, rustic, very poor, a far cry from the pretty lawns and car parks of today.

The local tourist office arranged for two of Elvis's childhood friends to share their memories of the place. One, Guy T Harris, recalled how he, Elvis, and their other young friend, James Ausborn, would play by the creek.

There was an even poorer area a mile up the hill, called Shake Rag. Elvis was one year old when the tornado blew through, sweeping half of its inhabitants into the lake below. Hooker's song chillingly articulated one survivor's terror.

&quot;Most of the people there was black, and they fought all the time,&quot; remembered James, &quot;but that didn't bother me and Elvis. There was a little black boy we knowed, and he would hold our hands and ferry us up there. We'd sit on the porches, and they'd sing black music - like BB King. We'd sit there for hours and just listen to the music.&quot;

Right there on the porch, some time in the mid-1940s, the seeds of rock'n'roll were being sewn in young Elvis Presley's head, cross-fertilised with the hillbilly country and church music with which every white kid grew up.

You would think that somewhere in Shake Rag there would stand the mother of all blue plaques, but it's still a bitterly poor neighbourhood, and not on the tourist map.

Instead, visitors are directed to Johnny's Drive-In, where dough-burgers (the usual beef disc, padded out with dough) are served either &quot;kerb-side&quot;, or, for the genuine experience, at the young Elvis's favourite table.

Tupelo Hardware, on Main Street, is where Elvis, then aged 10, was bought his first guitar by his mother, Gladys. Elvis took to the instrument with relish, enlisting James's elder brother, a touring musician known as Mississippi Slim, to teach him country-style guitar-playing.

Vernon, Elvis's father, was shifty, unsettled, constantly drifting from job to job. By 1948, he had run out of options in Tupelo - much as I did within a couple of days - so he packed up the family into a 1939 Plymouth and drove 100 miles north-west to Memphis to make a new start.

Memphis was, and is today, the big city, full of life and full of music. In 1949, Vernon convinced the housing department of his impecuniosity, and secured a two-bedroom apartment in Lauderdale Courts, a five-minute walk from Beale Street, where black rhythm and blues blared all weekend from every doorway.

Lauderdale Courts still stands today, although the units have been more generously redivided to accommodate residents able to afford more space - apart from number 328, which remains as it was, with replica furnishings, but with Elvis's bedroom wall smothered with lipstick prints.

Where the Presleys paid $35 a month rent, it's now for hire at $250 a night, except in August, when it will only be open for viewing. In the basement, the teenage Elvis spent hours strumming his guitar, in preparation for a seemingly unreachable dream of stardom.

Memphis has undergone a massive transformation in the two decades since its desolate appearance in Jim Jarmusch's film Mystery Train. Beale Street, which was torn down in the 1970s, is jumping again. In locals' eyes, it's a glitzy, theme-park version of its former self. Still, in the right bar, on the right night, it's possible to stumble upon an ancient looking black combo, knocking out vintage R&amp;B standards, much as they, or their elder relatives, were doing 50 years ago.

A couple of blocks away, I met another survivor from 1950s Beale Street. Back then, Bernard Lansky and his brother had a store selling hip clothes to the black music fraternity.

&quot;Elvis used to work in Loew's Theatre as an usher,&quot; he told me, &quot;and he used to come in down the alley on a coffee break. He was buying the pants tapered, with no back pockets, bolero coats, and all that fancy stuff, like the black dudes wore.&quot;

These days, Lansky's - now relocated inside the swanky Peabody Hotel - caters for upmarket tourists, but listening to this Jewish tailor, resolutely talking jive at the age of 80, I felt some sense of the cultural weirdness of Elvis's fetish for gaudy African-American threads.

A mile down Union Avenue is the building where Elvis's whole life snapped into focus. At 706 Union, Sam Phillips ran the small Memphis Recording Service, later renamed Sun Studios.

Phillips agreed to audition Elvis on numerous occasions, each time declining to record him - he didn't like the syrupy pop ballads Elvis sang. One sweltering day in July 1954, on some unknown instinct, he relented, and brought in a couple of backing musicians. After much huffing and puffing, Elvis spontaneously exploded into an energetic hillbilly take on Arthur &quot;Big Boy&quot; Crudup's That's All Right, Mama. Right there, rock 'n'roll finally burst out of him.

Though poky by comparison with modern studios, Sun still operates as a recording business. The tour whisks you through a rather perfunctory one-room museum upstairs, down through the tiny front office, where Elvis was fond of hanging out before and after fame claimed him, and then into the small, square room where Elvis cut his first four singles. Even crammed with 30 tourists, it still has an inexplicable air of magic about it.

Each year fans gather to pay homage to Elvis Presley's extraordinary legacy

I had felt far more queasy about visiting Graceland - a place legendary most of all for its tastelessness. How could this gilded palace of bling be meaningful or enjoyable for a fan to visit, when it has come to symbolise the excesses that were ultimately Presley's undoing?

The sheer scale of Graceland as an attraction today - which, to be fair, long predates CKX's involvement - is equally off-putting. Dozens of employees loiter just to tell you &quot;Keep moving, sir!&quot; even when there's no one else within 20 feet of you.

Approached by one of the special minibuses from the reception complex across the road, the house, with its famous portico, flanked by Corinthian pillars, appears smaller than many people imagine. It is no Taj Mahal, or Buckingham Palace, but certainly a very big house for three former residents of Tupelo.

The stained-glass peacocks and the 15-foot white leather sofa in the ground-floor living room set the tone for the décor, but, as you wander around, goggle-eyed, it's hard not to become engrossed in, and moved by, the sheer immensity of Elvis - everything he achieved, embodied and was, from such lowly beginnings.

t was Gladys Presley who found the mansion for her son, while he was in Hollywood filming Jailhouse Rock in 1957. Elvis endured as an icon for the ensuing 20 years of his life, and has endured a further 30 since, because he meant, and means, many things to many people.

For every snapshot of girls screaming at the luminous, Lansky's-clothed idol in full flight, there is his GI's uniform, appealing to US servicemen, or prayer books and crucifixes, with which countless millions of Christians can identify.

Even P Diddy or 50 Cent might take tips in extravagance from the jungle room, or the tiled &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot; lightning bolt in the triple-TV room, or the Convair private-jet double bed, including giant seat belt with gold-plated clip.

Where others may go for Elvis the firearms and karate fanatic, or Elvis the jumpsuited entertainer, or Elvis the practical joker, I found myself enthralled by Elvis the questing spirit. Even after learning of him parroting If, and gaining strength from his stillborn twin brother, I'd never suspected that he was the kind of guy who might read Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse.

A display from his old office also includes Thomas Troward's The Creative Process in the Individual , complete with Presley's spidery notes in the margins, and a framed print of Theodore Roosevelt's speech with the line &quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena.&quot; Contrary to popular belief, there was an Elvis who had a sense of calling, who reflected on fame and what might be achieved by it for the greater good.

Within a separate exhibit called &quot;Elvis at Night&quot;, the story is told of Presley's flabbergasting dawn visit to President Nixon in the White House in December 1970. His purpose was to request a badge of authorisation from the Federal Bureau of Narcotics so that he could help to combat the promotion of drugs through rock music.

He brought with him a Colt 45, as a gift for Nixon - these were different times. Afterwards, Nixon spoke of him as &quot;a sincere and decent man, with flamboyance covering up his shyness&quot;.

&quot;Elvis at Night&quot; also tells of the strange, nocturnal life that Elvis led in order to avoid the chaos that would transpire if he went out in daylight. Having had his staff arrange for a restaurant to reopen for him after hours, he would arrive there in a motorcade with an entourage of 20 or more. (Favourites included Krystal, renowned for its square burgers, and the Arcade Diner: both places, coincidentally, left me feeling greasy, over-full but under-nourished - he really was not a healthy eater.)

Similarly, in one of his last sorties into the outside world before his death, he hired the Ridgeway Four cinema one night to watch Star Wars with his buddies.

Graceland went from being Elvis's palace to his prison. A man I spoke to in Tupelo remembered joining a couple of hundred fans outside the gates, peering in for a glimpse of the King, circa 1968. Presley, who was tanned and lean, fresh from making his incredible Comeback Special for NBC, rode down through the trees on horseback, and signed autographs for an hour or more. By the end, thousands of people had gathered.

At that stage, Presley had been spending most of his time in Hollywood, and must have enjoyed meeting regular Tennessee folk. As he spent more time at home, however, he felt captive within his own castle walls.

Also in Tupelo, I ran into Sonny West, Elvis's long-serving bodyguard, who vividly recalled Elvis's slide. &quot;In Vegas, he'd wake and go straight on stage, whacked out,&quot; he said. &quot;He didn't know what planet he was on, with all the drugs, and he got heavier. One time near the end, I remember walking through the crowd with him towards the stage, and I saw two women standing there as he went by. One looked at the other, shocked. She said: 'He looks so bad'.&quot;

The Elvis whose colossal magnetism and talent were draining away has proved the easiest one to impersonate. The young, virile, world-changing one is irreplaceable, which is why thousands will converge on Memphis and Tupelo next month to pay homage, to be at his graveside in Graceland's Meditation Garden, and to hear many more stories like these from those who knew him. Disapproving locals may call it Death Week, but for those few days the King will reign once more.
