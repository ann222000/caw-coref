&gt;&gt; First, what I am saying is that people will tend to gravitate toward
&gt;&gt; the advice that they are predisposed to want to hear,

&gt; That's likely true.  Do you think you are immune from this?

Zorra, this discussion began when I made a comment to Cait as to how I
think advice should be evaluated.  You entered that discussion by
giving an opposing opinion as to how I thought advice should be
evaluated.  As such, the basis of this discussion is not how we, as
responders can change, but rather, it is how we, as seekers of advice,
should evaluate that advice.  If you've given up on that discussion,
and want to begin a different discussion, then fine, we can do that,
but let's at least wrap up the dicussion we began.  OK?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; First, what I am saying is that people will tend to gravitate
&gt;&gt; toward the advice that they are predisposed to want to hear,

&gt; That's likely true.  Do you think you are immune from this?
">

As I've said now many times, I try very hard to fight that tendency,
whereas you've basically stated that you embrace that tendency.  That
is the difference between us that I've been trying to pursue, and not
anything to do with our approach as givers of advice.  I am speaking
solely about us in our roles as seekers of advice.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; and that as such, advice which is consistent with that is much more
&gt;&gt; likely to be 'trusted', or be perceived as 'kind', or
&gt;&gt; 'sympathetic', or 'understanding', or whatever other similar
&gt;&gt; adjective you've used.

&gt; No, this leap does not necessarily follow.
">

I didn't say it necessarily follows.  I said &quot;much more likely&quot;.  BTW,
I don't much care for your tendency to answer &quot;No.....&quot; to my
opinions.  I understand that you have a contrary opinion, but opinions
are not matters of fact to which terms like &quot;no&quot; apply.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  In the cheating example, we are assuming that the OP wants to be
&gt; given the green light, correct?  But suppose that the person giving
&gt; her the green light is saying something like, &quot;We all deserve fun,
&gt; and what he doesn't know won't hurt him?&quot;  The OP could be so turned
&gt; off by being characterized as a selfish, fun-seeking person that it
&gt; has the opposite affect and dissuades her from cheating.
">

Yes, it's always possible that advice that tends to give the OP the
green light could be taken the other way.  However, whereas I never
said, nor did I ever imply that anything approaching an absolute
truism, I really don't understand your point.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; As such, people who claim that they will tend to only follow advice
&gt;&gt; that fits those adjectives are likely to follow advice that they
&gt;&gt; were predisposed to hear.

&gt; Well, since I didn't follow the first leap, I don't agree with this
&gt; one either.

&gt; I do think that people are disposed to listen to the advice they
&gt; want to hear, and that people are disposed to listen to advice that
&gt; is phrased in a way that appeals to them.  What I don't agree with
&gt; is the idea that preferring kindness to bluntness is indicative of a
&gt; problem, or that those who prefer bluntness are necessarily more
&gt; likely to evaluate all advice equally.
">

Just as you seem to be stuck on the notion that how we approach our
roles as advisors has much to do with how we approach our roles as
seekers of advice, I also think that you're stuck with the notion that
I'm advocating bluntness over kindness.  Quite to the contrary, what I
am saying is that people will generally perceive advice that is
generally consistent with their actions or desires as more 'trusting',
or 'supportive, or pleasant' than advice that is contrary to their
actions of desires.  Almost by definition, advice which is contrary to
what people are doing, or want to do, or are considering doing, is
inherently critical of them and their choices.  And so, almost
inevitably, it's almost bound to be less pleasant to hear.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Secondly, a person who seeks advice cannot control whether that
&gt;&gt; advice is given tactfully or kindly.  A person seeking advice will
&gt;&gt; find the advice they get as they find it.  As such, it's irrelevant
&gt;&gt; to talk about how that advice *might* have been delivered more
&gt;&gt; kindly when discussing how such a person should evaluate that
&gt;&gt; advice.  It's certainly worth while to have a discussion about how
&gt;&gt; advice could be dispensed, but it's irrelevant to a discussion of
&gt;&gt; how a person seeking advice should evaluate that advice in a
&gt;&gt; discussion wherein that person will find the advice as they find
&gt;&gt; it.

&gt;&gt; Finally, to pursue the subject you've so stridently have wished to
&gt;&gt; pursue, I think you failed to make you point anyway.  You tired
&gt;&gt; twice to show how 'hard' advice culd be delivered kindly, but in
&gt;&gt; the first attempt, it required you to say that you knew something
&gt;&gt; about the OP which you didn't know, and in the second attempt, all
&gt;&gt; you did was to ask a question of the OP hoping that this would
&gt;&gt; prompt them to look 'deep down'.  In both attempts, wherein you
&gt;&gt; posed as a responder trying to give 'hard' advice kindly, the only
&gt;&gt; way you could do so was to avvoid giving the 'hard' advice at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So my point was never to discuss how advice should be dispensed.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I was only trying to combat what I saw as an unfair negative
&gt;&gt;&gt; attribute assigned to people doing a natural and fairly neutral
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing.

&gt;&gt; And you made that attempt by also attempting to shift the
&gt;&gt; discussion to how responders *could* dispense advice differently

&gt; No, I was trying to show how all kinds of advice might have been
&gt; delivered in all kinds of ways.
">

You just made my point for me with everything you typed after &quot;No&quot;.
Certainly all kinds of advice *can* be delivered in different ways.  I
never claimed anything to the contrary.  But how advice can be
delivered has nothing to do with the point I was making to Cait, and
to which you posted a contrary opinion.  How advice can be delivered
speaks to our roles as advisors, and not, as I was saying, to our
roles as seekers of advice.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; instead of discussing the issue from the premise that we find
&gt;&gt; advice as we find it, no matter how much you think it *could* have
&gt;&gt; been reworded.

&gt; I felt that your premise was skewed because you seemed to be
&gt; assuming that the kind advice would also be the wrong advice.
">

You are completely wrong about what I was assuming, or not assuming.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;  And I have no idea what 'fariness' has anything to do with this
&gt;&gt; discussion, but if it makes you feel better to think that you've
&gt;&gt; been 'combating unfairness' by having this discussion with me, then
&gt;&gt; whatever blows your dress up.

&gt; If the word &quot;unfair&quot; bothers you, you can replace it with
&gt; &quot;inaccurate&quot; in that sentence and I will be just as happy.
">

It's unfortunate that you see no distinction between inaccurate and
unfair.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;snipped&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yesterday was Chewy's 1st in a 3 day stretch of days off.  He went
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; work on a truck he wants to get running so we have 2 vehicles,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; instead
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of just the suburban.  He'd known that we were helping my co-worker
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; move, but when he said something about working on the truck, that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; was
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a relief for me - on 2 levels.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1)  It's something that needs to be DONE.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2)  I didn't have to walk around on eggshells, wondering if he was
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; going to handle things well or not.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is good news!  I'd also say that if Chewy actually (objectively)
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fixes
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the truck, then you have a neat little piece of information - he's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; capable
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of fixing the truck, and that's a very good thing.  He can think about
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; moving on to fixing things that he's less familiar with.  One step at
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; time.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The man's brilliant.  He can do anything he sets his mind to - if he
&gt;&gt; &gt; gets motivated to do it, and can maintain motivation through to
&gt;&gt; &gt; completion.  He bought this truck about 2 months ago and was going to
&gt;&gt; &gt; get it running within the week.  I'm hoping that now that he's
&gt;&gt; &gt; started, he will stay motivated to complete the task.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Good thing, too, because I got into a bit of a &quot;dispute&quot; with my co-
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; worker's SO's motorcycle.  Never know how Chewy will handle things
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; like that.  As it was, I was able to laugh it all off.  Today,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; just a residual headache and a bone bruise on my right arm.  hmmm...
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; come to think of it, maybe just a bit more than a headache.  lol...
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; just zoned out trying to get a dwg file to open.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Tsk tsk.  I'm guessing that Chewy would have reacted strongly out of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; same kind of concern many of us have when our partners get on bikes.

&gt;&gt; &gt; He's apparently always done that with the kids.  I've heard them tell
&gt;&gt; &gt; stories of him getting mad and yelling at them if they fell and hurt
&gt;&gt; &gt; themselves when they were little.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Anyhow, I'll just keep on keeping on, keep my head low, and get
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; through this.  I'll bide my time to see what they're going to do,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; just
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sit it out.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I like to hear that things are fluctuating more around a tolerable
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; point
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not flying all over the place.  That's great news.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm working hard to ignore times where anyone flies all over the
&gt;&gt; &gt; place.  Not an easy thing to do, but I'm working on it.

&gt;&gt; Just wanted to say:  you're working on a lot right now (and so is Chewy).
&gt;&gt; It sounds like there's a lot more teamwork and organization now than a
&gt;&gt; few
&gt;&gt; months ago, even though things are still very rough/brittle.

&gt; No, not much team work.  Lots of me trying to ignore things, trying to
&gt; let things slide, trying not to stress out over things that would have
&gt; any other wife I know throwing huge fits and getting downright
&gt; dictatorial.  Same as always.

&gt; But I get more relaxation time today.  I'm staying late to get more
&gt; files off my desk so they won't be sitting here over the holiday.
">

This post made me take a deep breath, hoping that you have enough energy to
get through all this.  If the teamwork thing can be improved, both of you
will see huge benefits.  I know it's been one of the primary &quot;complaints&quot;
you've had in the past, but I think it's crucial.  At this point, Chewy
needs to realize who is actually on his team, for starters.

My oldest son also asked me this question.  I don't remember how old
he was but I think he was a bit younger, around 8 or 9.  I asked him
if he really wanted to know and he said yes, so I told him that it was
actually Dad and I who were Santa.  He said that he had suspected as
much, but a little while later he also said, &quot;Dang it, I wish I didn't
ask you that!&quot;.  LOL.  So he already had a pretty good idea, but part
of him wanted to keep believing for a bit longer.

He's a man now, in his early 20's.  But he stays the night with me on
Christmas Eve, and the next morning I still wake him up by saying,
&quot;J___, wake up!  Santa was here!&quot;

My ex and I didn't have kids, but early in our marriage, when we

Thank you, Tai, for a response that helps sustain the holiday mood.

I think many Americans saw Thanksgiving as the kick-off event for joyous,
family holidays in which everyone reconnected, and there was enough time
spent together that much more than mere formalities/formal gifting/dining
could take place.

Today, I get the impression TG is just a hassle for a lot of folks.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; So... what am I most thankful for this year in addition to the
&gt;&gt; 'standard stuff'? (not that I am dimenishing the importance of std.
&gt;&gt; stuff!)
&gt;&gt; Well, mostly for my dear mother-in-law. Yeah, I know--sounds strange.
&gt;&gt; I used to have a Pastor that quipped &quot;Adam was the happiest married
&gt;&gt; man that ever existed--he's the only one that never had a
&gt;&gt; mother-in-law!&quot; Always good for a laugh... but for me, this year
&gt;&gt; would have been 1000 times worse without my MIL.

&gt;&gt; My MIL, dropped her entire life and husband, on a moment's notice this
&gt;&gt; Spring to come and help me and my family, after my DW fell and
&gt;&gt; severely broke her leg (TPF). She came and cared for my kids (who
&gt;&gt; were ungrateful and unappreciative), help take care of my wife,
&gt;&gt; cooked for me, carted DW to the plethora of Drs/PT appointments
&gt;&gt; (after DW came home from a 2 surgery/5 week hospital stay), got the
&gt;&gt; groceries, helps with laundry, kept encouraging DW (and me) to keep
&gt;&gt; either or both of us from falling into despair/depression. She ended
&gt;&gt; up living with us for about 13 weeks, with a short 3-4 week break in
&gt;&gt; the middle to return home and take care of some business in her home
&gt;&gt; that couldn't be put off any longer. Her willingness to do this for
&gt;&gt; us I do not take for granted. Her coming when she did enabled me to
&gt;&gt; spend much time with my wife in the hospital that I otherwise would
&gt;&gt; have been unable to. It allowed me the time to fight with the medical
&gt;&gt; staff/hospital/insurance that I would otherwise have just had to
&gt;&gt; 'hope for the best' instead of standing our ground and demanding the
&gt;&gt; best. Her stay allowed me to not have to drop out of grad school at
&gt;&gt; the semester's end and finish the class that was 98% complete. In
&gt;&gt; short, she kept my family/kids/house afloat while I did my best to
&gt;&gt; care for my wife and hold onto my job.
&gt;&gt; So, here's to great mother-in-laws. I have a feeling that MILs get an
&gt;&gt; undeserved bad rap generally speaking when there are many that are as
&gt;&gt; caring, selfless and giving as mine.

&gt;&gt; My 2nd thing--is my 'church family'. They brought meals, and were a
&gt;&gt; fantastic support for us during this ordeal as well--particularly
&gt;&gt; during the 1st few days before MIL could make it here from 1000 mi
&gt;&gt; away. Their tangible support and prayers helped sustain us more than
&gt;&gt; they can ever know. Not having ANY family within 500 mi our entire
&gt;&gt; life together, has forced us to find/make surrogate family thru our
&gt;&gt; church. And I thank God for my MIL and my church family! (In case
&gt;&gt; anyone is wondering--my mother could not come, as much as she wanted
&gt;&gt; to, because she is the life support/care for her ailing, elderly
&gt;&gt; mother.) I am certain had it been possible for her to come, my wife
&gt;&gt; could just as easily been writing this about her MIL. We are both
&gt;&gt; blessed with fanatastic in-laws! My thanks also to and for my FIL for
&gt;&gt; allowing his wife to temporarily abandon him for 3+ months! I know it
&gt;&gt; was hard on him too.
&gt;&gt; What 'non-std' thing(s) are you thankful for?

&gt;&gt; Happy Thanksgiving!

&gt; &gt; Happy Thanksgiving to you as well, Bo.

&gt; &gt; I am thankful for my son.  Last eve he once again asked if Santa was
&gt; &gt; real.  He was holding his breath and at first I thought he was
&gt; &gt; internally begging for me to say Santa was real, but then I really,
&gt; &gt; really looked.  He wanted to know the truth.

&gt; &gt; This last year I have noticed him really grow.  Yeah he can be a
&gt; &gt; crazy, irritating, spacey 11 year old boy.  But, something was just
&gt; &gt; different this year.  It made me feel a bit sad, but very proud.  I
&gt; &gt; think he will turn into a wonderful man.  It might be early to feel
&gt; &gt; this, but I do.

&gt; &gt; I told him the truth.  He wasn't disappointed.  Actually he seemed
&gt; &gt; like he stood a bit taller.  He has this way of arching one brow and
&gt; &gt; nodding his head like, &quot;Hmmm, yes, it was as I suspected&quot;.  I savored
&gt; &gt; the moment for a minute, then turned back into mom and lectured him on
&gt; &gt; not spilling the beans to his sisters.

&gt; &gt; He said that he wouldn't want to tell them because he hates when he
&gt; &gt; thinks I am disappointed in him.

&gt; &gt; Damn.  What a kid.  I love my son.

&gt; &gt; Vickie

&gt; That's pretty good to hear, Vickie.
&gt; And hopefully he doesn't want to hurt them too, either (by telling them the
&gt; truth about Santa).      Well, kudos to ya.

I think he will hold to it.
It was just one of those moments, you know?

&gt; My oldest son also asked me this question.  I don't remember how old
&gt; he was but I think he was a bit younger, around 8 or 9.  I asked him
&gt; if he really wanted to know and he said yes, so I told him that it was
&gt; actually Dad and I who were Santa.  He said that he had suspected as
&gt; much, but a little while later he also said, &quot;Dang it, I wish I didn't
&gt; ask you that!&quot;.  LOL.  So he already had a pretty good idea, but part
&gt; of him wanted to keep believing for a bit longer.

&gt; He's a man now, in his early 20's.  But he stays the night with me on
&gt; Christmas Eve, and the next morning I still wake him up by saying,
&gt; &quot;J___, wake up!  Santa was here!&quot;

&gt;&gt; Anything non-standard I can think of sounds trivial compared with your

&gt;&gt; reasons why we are thankful for our families and communities, even if
&gt;&gt; they've made more than usually heroic efforts in your family's direction
&gt;&gt; this past year. What a gem of a woman!

&gt;&gt; We don't have an equivalent holiday here but I would like it if we did.
&gt;&gt; Just not so close to Christmas! (June or July would be much better.)

&gt;&gt; Tai

&gt; Thank you, Tai, for a response that helps sustain the holiday mood.

&gt; I think many Americans saw Thanksgiving as the kick-off event for joyous,
&gt; family holidays in which everyone reconnected, and there was enough time
&gt; spent together that much more than mere formalities/formal gifting/dining
&gt; could take place.

&gt; Today, I get the impression TG is just a hassle for a lot of folks.

&gt; A.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So... what am I most thankful for this year in addition to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'standard stuff'? (not that I am dimenishing the importance of std.
&gt;&gt;&gt; stuff!)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, mostly for my dear mother-in-law. Yeah, I know--sounds strange.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I used to have a Pastor that quipped &quot;Adam was the happiest married
&gt;&gt;&gt; man that ever existed--he's the only one that never had a
&gt;&gt;&gt; mother-in-law!&quot; Always good for a laugh... but for me, this year
&gt;&gt;&gt; would have been 1000 times worse without my MIL.

&gt;&gt;&gt; My MIL, dropped her entire life and husband, on a moment's notice this
&gt;&gt;&gt; Spring to come and help me and my family, after my DW fell and
&gt;&gt;&gt; severely broke her leg (TPF). She came and cared for my kids (who
&gt;&gt;&gt; were ungrateful and unappreciative), help take care of my wife,
&gt;&gt;&gt; cooked for me, carted DW to the plethora of Drs/PT appointments
&gt;&gt;&gt; (after DW came home from a 2 surgery/5 week hospital stay), got the
&gt;&gt;&gt; groceries, helps with laundry, kept encouraging DW (and me) to keep
&gt;&gt;&gt; either or both of us from falling into despair/depression. She ended
&gt;&gt;&gt; up living with us for about 13 weeks, with a short 3-4 week break in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the middle to return home and take care of some business in her home
&gt;&gt;&gt; that couldn't be put off any longer. Her willingness to do this for
&gt;&gt;&gt; us I do not take for granted. Her coming when she did enabled me to
&gt;&gt;&gt; spend much time with my wife in the hospital that I otherwise would
&gt;&gt;&gt; have been unable to. It allowed me the time to fight with the medical
&gt;&gt;&gt; staff/hospital/insurance that I would otherwise have just had to
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'hope for the best' instead of standing our ground and demanding the
&gt;&gt;&gt; best. Her stay allowed me to not have to drop out of grad school at
&gt;&gt;&gt; the semester's end and finish the class that was 98% complete. In
&gt;&gt;&gt; short, she kept my family/kids/house afloat while I did my best to
&gt;&gt;&gt; care for my wife and hold onto my job.
&gt;&gt;&gt; So, here's to great mother-in-laws. I have a feeling that MILs get an
&gt;&gt;&gt; undeserved bad rap generally speaking when there are many that are as
&gt;&gt;&gt; caring, selfless and giving as mine.

&gt;&gt;&gt; My 2nd thing--is my 'church family'. They brought meals, and were a
&gt;&gt;&gt; fantastic support for us during this ordeal as well--particularly
&gt;&gt;&gt; during the 1st few days before MIL could make it here from 1000 mi
&gt;&gt;&gt; away. Their tangible support and prayers helped sustain us more than
&gt;&gt;&gt; they can ever know. Not having ANY family within 500 mi our entire
&gt;&gt;&gt; life together, has forced us to find/make surrogate family thru our
&gt;&gt;&gt; church. And I thank God for my MIL and my church family! (In case
&gt;&gt;&gt; anyone is wondering--my mother could not come, as much as she wanted
&gt;&gt;&gt; to, because she is the life support/care for her ailing, elderly
&gt;&gt;&gt; mother.) I am certain had it been possible for her to come, my wife
&gt;&gt;&gt; could just as easily been writing this about her MIL. We are both
&gt;&gt;&gt; blessed with fanatastic in-laws! My thanks also to and for my FIL for
&gt;&gt;&gt; allowing his wife to temporarily abandon him for 3+ months! I know it
&gt;&gt;&gt; was hard on him too.
&gt;&gt;&gt; What 'non-std' thing(s) are you thankful for?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Happy Thanksgiving!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bo

&gt; hello, I don't know if I should contact you or alt-support divorce.
&gt; You see my husband a couple of weeks ago decided that he wasn't sure
&gt; if he loves me enough to stay with me so he took all his stuff and
&gt; went back to the country where we lived for 8 years. We moved few
&gt; months ago to my home country and it was quite a shock for him, but
&gt; we
&gt; always discussed that if it wasn't working for him or for us we
&gt; would
&gt; have gone back. However he was really miserable and at the end he
&gt; told
&gt; me how he felt for the marriage as well. The main problem is that we
&gt; have 2 children as well and they are suffering so much. He went away
&gt; from them as well, and on the phone he hopes that they are ok
&gt; anyway,
&gt; but how could they? I feel so angry at him because he even said he's
&gt; not sure about how he feels and if he could have at least until xmas
&gt; to decide, but I know he already decided so why keeping me hanging?
&gt; I
&gt; know he likes freedom and going out with friends (who knows what
&gt; else!) but marriage is more important isn't it? I just feel so
&gt; depressed, I grew up thinking that you should do anything for your
&gt; children and your marriage, if resolvable, but he doesn't think it
&gt; this way!

There's always so much more information to be learned in these
situations that it's very important for you to know that any advice
you receive based upon the very limited information that you're able
to provide in this kind of forum should be taken with a huge grain of
salt.

Having said that, it seems to me that you really need to start
focusing on an exit strategy.  You need to protect your kids from the
emotional turmoil that might ensue from an on again, off again kind of
father presence, and you also need to make sure that they're given the
proper support.  Secondly, but still very importantly, you need to get
on with your life.  Again stressing that there's no way to know how
accurate your perceptions of the situation might be, or how completely
you've described the important facts, it just doesn't sound to me like
there's much of a future there.

Yeah, I know. It is sort of amazing, isn't it.

Whatever I try to express comes out and belly aching, whining or
blaming others. Bill has it right.  ... there just doesn't seem to be
any words. The situation calls for action. That express doesn't take
place until such time as the action is effective. At that point there
is nothing that can be said. The expression is all in the
demonstration.

For similar reasons I just couldn't find any words to reply to Bill or
Vickie in the &quot;Raving burns his last Bridge&quot; thread.

... Thus, I plop down my acknowledgement and appreciation here. ( Hi
Vickie. Hi Bill.)

Yes.  Another 4 years for the *right* woman to come along and fill the
role won't be too much of a hardship as time seems to fly by.

TOPIC: PUA DATING SEDUCTION PICKUP WOMEN (NOT MYSTERY METHOD) TORONTO LAIR !!!
http://groups.google.com/group/alt.support.marriage/browse_thread/thr...
=========================================================================== ===

== 1 of 1 ==
Date: Wed, Nov 21 2007 3:41 pm
From: Women Worship You

Do you suspect that most PICKUP GURUS are just smooth-talking fakes
looking to steal your money?  Are you confused by all the
contradictory methods offered by hundreds of guys, each claiming to be
the &quot;Ultimate PUA&quot;?  Are you uncomfortable using lies to seduce
women?  Did you get angry when the supposedly secret MYSTERY METHOD
you paid thousands of dollars to learn was revealed to millions of
women on TV?  Well guess what ... inquiries from men visiting our web
site reveal that you're not alone.

If you are at least average looking, but penetrating less than 10 new
female orifices each month, then you have not attained your full
sexual potential.  You wasted your hard-earned money on hyped-up scam
pickup courses.  But now there is a GENUINE ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL
PICKUP GURUS.  On October 1, 2007, the world's most powerful seduction
products were finally released.  After years of repeated requests from
the SEDUCTION COMMUNITY, for the first time ever Canada's greatest
lover and seducer, Dimitri The Lover, reveals the techniques that made
him an on-line celebrity.

Unlike other PICKUP GURUS, Dimitri The Lover actually GETS LAID LOTS,
and can prove it!  For example, one late summer afternoon, without
giving him any warning, a SKEPTICAL JOURNALIST suddenly demanded that
he pick up women walking on a quiet Toronto street.  To her utter
disbelief, she observed Dimitri The Lover obtain telephone numbers
from 5 HOT HORNY YOUNG WOMEN IN 35 MINUTES by using a carefully chosen
unique complimentary phrase on each woman.  Each pick-up took an
average of 2 minutes!  His secret?  Using criteria he developed over
many years, Dimitri The Lover chose to only approach women with a
certain style and gait indicative of a SLUT DESPERATE FOR
COMPANIONSHIP.  He then customized his opening lines to each slut's
unique psychological profile.

Now Dimitri The Lover reveals how you too can make women do the
dirtiest, nastiest things ON THE FIRST DATE without spending a dime.
Dimitri The Lover's techniques were so successful, that he even
started his own religion, The Church of Dimitri of Latter Day Sluts,
just to maintain boundaries between himself and all of his lovers!
Yes, Dimitri The Lover is VERY controversial.  And yes, feminists
loathe him because men quickly CONTROL WOMEN using his methods.  But
what do you care?  You just want to get laid ... armed with Dimitri
The Lover's proven secret seduction weapons.

While you stare at this letter, graduates of Dimitri The Lover's
programs are out having sex with HOT HORNY YOUNG WOMEN.  Many of these
women have not had sex for months, and are desperate to immediately
give their bodies to any half-decent looking man.  Are YOU man enough
to take them?  What are you waiting for?  Go to http://www.WomenWorshipYou.org
RIGHT NOW and register for the ultimate direct seduction program.
Don't let another sexless day go by.  You deserve way better than porn
fantasies.  Let Dimitri The Lover turn you from a timid wannabe into a
powerful player that women will worship!
