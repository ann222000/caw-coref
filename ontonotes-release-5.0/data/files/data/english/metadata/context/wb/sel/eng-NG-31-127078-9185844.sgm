Here's a story that may not have been deemed &quot;Fit to Print&quot;: In the
six months that ended Sept. 25, The New York Times' daily circulation
was down another 4.51 percent to about a million readers a day. The
paper's Sunday circulation was down 7.59 percent to about 1.5 million
readers. In short, the Times is dropping faster than Hillary in New
Hampshire. (Meanwhile, the Drudge Report has more than 16 million
readers every day.)

One can only hope that none of the Democratic presidential candidates
are among the disaffected hordes lining up to cancel their Times
subscriptions.

The Times is so accustomed to lying about the news to prove that &quot;most
Americans&quot; agree with the Times, that it seems poised to lead the
Democrats -- and any Republicans stupid enough to believe the Times --
down a primrose path to their own destruction.

So if you know a Democratic presidential candidate who doesn't
currently read the Times, by all means order him a subscription.

On Sunday, Times readers learned that despite this year's historic
revolt of normal Americans against amnesty for illegal aliens: &quot;Some
polls show that the majority of Americans agree with proposals backed
by most Democrats in the Senate, as well as some Republicans, to
establish a path to citizenship for immigrants here illegally.&quot;

Was the reporter who wrote that sentence the Darfur bureau chief for
the past year? By &quot;some polls,&quot; I gather he means &quot;a show of hands
during a meeting of the Times editorial board&quot; or &quot;a quick backstage
survey in the MSNBC greenroom.&quot;

As I believe Americans made resoundingly clear this year, the only
&quot;path to citizenship&quot; they favor involves making an application from
Norway, waiting a few years and then coming over when it's legal.

Americans were so emphatic on this point that they forced a sitting
president to withdraw his signature legislative accomplishment for his
second term -- amnesty for illegal aliens, aka a &quot;path to citizenship&quot;
for illegals.

This was the goal supported by the president's acolytes at the Fox
News Channel as well as a nearly monolithic Democratic Party and its
acolytes at ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, MTV, Oxygen TV, the Food
Network, the Golf Channel, the Home Shopping Network, The in-house
&quot;Learn to Gamble&quot; channel at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas and Comedy
Central (unless that was just a sketch on the &quot;Mind of (Carlos)
Mencia&quot;).

But ordinary Americans had a different idea. Their idea was: Let's not
reward law-breakers with the ultimate prize: U.S. citizenship. And the
ordinary Americans won.

The Times disregards all of that history to announce that it has
secret polls showing that Americans support a &quot;path to citizenship&quot;
for illegals after all! These polls are living in the shadows!

Only those &quot;angriest on immigration,&quot; the Times said, are still using
the various words related to immigration that liberals are trying to
turn into new &quot;N-words,&quot; such as, for example, &quot;immigration.&quot; With an
exhausting use of air quotes, the Times reports that: &quot;The Republicans
have railed against 'amnesty' and 'sanctuary cities.' They have
promised to build a fence on the Mexican border to keep 'illegals'
out.&quot;

In liberal-speak, that sentence would read: &quot;The Republicans have
railed against 'puppies' and 'kittens.' They have promised to build a
fence on the Mexican border to keep 'baby seals' out.&quot; (In my version,
the sentence would read: &quot;Believing New York Times 'polls,' Democrats
irritate 'voters.'&quot;)

Half the English language is becoming the &quot;N-word&quot; as far as liberals
are concerned. Words are always bad for liberals. Words allow people
to understand what liberals are saying.

According to the Times, all decent, cultured Americans cringe when
politicians use foul words like &quot;illegals&quot; to describe illegals.
Apparently, what most Americans are clamoring for is yet more
automatic messages that begin, &quot;Press '1' for English.&quot; That, at
least, is the message the Times got from the stunning victory of
grassroots over the elites on the immigration bill this year.

It is against my best interests to mention how utterly out of touch
Times editors and reporters are with any Americans east of Central
Park West and west of Riverside Drive. I enjoy watching the Democratic
presidential candidates take clear, unequivocal positions in favor of
driver's licenses for illegals and then denouncing those very
positions a week later (after the real polls come in).

Some people love watching the trees change color every fall. I enjoy
watching the candidates' positions on immigration change.

But it is too much for any human to endure to read the Times' version
of history in which &quot;most Americans&quot; agree with the Times on illegal
immigration in the very year Americans punched back against illegal
immigration so hard that the entire Washington establishment is still
reeling. It's not like we have to go back to the Coolidge
administration to get some sense of what Americans think about amnesty
for illegals. (I mean &quot;amnesty&quot; for &quot;illegals.&quot;)

Using the Times' calculus, &quot;most Americans&quot; have also enthusiastically
embraced soccer and the metric system.

Read The New York Times, Democrats. Make my day.
