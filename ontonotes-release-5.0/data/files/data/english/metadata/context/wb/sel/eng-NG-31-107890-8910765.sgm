The American broadcast standard for FM pre-emphasis is 75 uS.
The European (and most everyone else) is 50 uS.

As a result, most German radios tend to sound different when
used in the US, even if they were &quot;export models.&quot;

I've been gathering up test equipmeent for the past year to
have a detailed look at the audio of several FM radios to
see if I can quantify exactly what's going on between the
detector and my ears.

I would expect a certain amount of low and high frequency
increase or roll off, but there appear to be odd peaks in
the bass  that result in a thumping effect on some program
material.

All in all, this should be a fun exercise.

I guess that explains why European FM sets sound so deep on FM, even
if you kill the bass
and rake the treble up.

On my last trip to South Korea, I brought back a small Korean-brand
ghetto blaster (one of those radio/tape/CD jammies) to use at  work.

The FM stations sure sound the same to me here as they did there,
though, so I wonder if radio manufacturers even care about what type
of pre-emphasis is used anymore.  The unit was made in China,
obviously. *eyerolls*

Actually, it's the opposite. Listening to 75 uS pre-emphasis with

No, that doesn't explain it at all. If you play a radio with 50us
de-emphasis on stations with 75us pre-emphasis (Euro radios being used in
the US) the only thing that happens is the high frequencies sound a bit
brighter. This can easily be confirmed with an FM tuner that has a built in
switch for de-emphasis. Switch from 75 to 50, and the top end gets a little
brighter. That's all.  That doesn't explain the thumpiness of some of the
German radios, which I attribute to the huge amount of compression along
with artificial bass boost so common in most FM signals today. Those German
sets all had loudness taps with aggressive bass boost, especially at lower
volumes. When those radios were new, radio stations had lower modulation
levels, and far less compression. Volume controls would be set higher for
equivalent perceived volume, thereby reducing the loudness compensation in
the radio. I also think detectors are being overloaded in some of these
radios with today's signals. These radios never had very flat response. They
were &quot;tweaked&quot; to sound &quot;good&quot;.

And of course, pre-emphasis serves a purpose.  Boost the highs before
sending, so then at the receiving end when you filter it back to normal
you also knock out the obnoxious high frequency noise.  If you didn't boost
in the first place, then the filtering would alter the signal along
with taking out the unwanted background noise.

I think the concept gets a bit lost when they talk in terms of uS
pre-emphasis, since it doesn't immediately represent frequency.  50uS
is the invert of a higher frequency than the invert of 75uS.

A Gates FM transmitter from the '50s was spec'ed down to 100 Hz

I did a Spice model of the de-emphasis and just the loudness controls
on one Grundig as a sample. Initially, before the loudness control,
the treble is a bit &quot;bright&quot; due to under de-emphasis. ABout a 3dB
rise in treble at about 4 KHz. However, after the loudness control, I
found that the bass response was almost the same level regardless of
the volume setting. For an almost 24 dB change in volume levels above
1 KHz, the level only changed about 6 dB below  100 Hz

The Gates transmitters of the 1950s were spec'ed down to 50 Hz, not 100
Hz.  Full modulation capability down to 50 Hz was an FCC requirement for
FM transmitters.  The reason they didn't go deeper was because the Gates
transmitters used Phase Modulators, not Frequency Modulators.  Gates
replaced the single phase modulator with what they dubbed the &quot;Cascade&quot;
modulator which was two phase modulators in series.  I'm not sure when
they came out with this improvement, probably the late 1950s, but it
should have approximately doubled (halved?) the low frequency
performance.

I'm not sure how the Optimod contributes to getting down to 2 Hz?  The
major contributor to this is probably the digital NCOs that replaced the
old analog VCOs with their PLLs and loop filters, which had previously
replaced the Phase Modulators Gates used.  I guess RCA's direct FM
system was on the right track in the late 1930s, Armstrong got that
wrong.

When I worked in the radio design factory, (American) after the
electrical design was complete, the radios went upstairs to a little old
Porsche driving German man who voiced the radios by choosing and
&quot;tweaking&quot; the speakers as well as requesting changes in the electrical
equalization to get the sound he wanted, which he believed would would
sell best.

To determine &quot;what it really does&quot; you need to do acoustic testing using
an anechoic room as well as typical listening rooms.

In a word, yes. Typically look for the R and C coming off of the
discriminator and calculate the value. I've seen it vary from
30 to 60 microseconds. But as an example, one of the radios has
a 47 K resistor and a .001 uF cap. (47 uS) replace it with a
0.0016 uF or just stick a 620 pF silver mica across the original.

Hi Jeff,

I hope you are feeling better this morning.

While I am not a particular fan of the old Gates transmitters, your
portrayal of their performance as worse than it actually was does little
to further the understanding of the history of FM radios, and why many
old FM radios perform as they do.

With regard to the Optimod helping to extend the low frequency response
of FM down to 2 Hz, this may very well be true of the new digital
Optimods, I know nothing about the digital Optimods, but it is certainly
not true of the old analog Optimods.  The analog Optimods include a
brickwall high pass filter with a cut off frequency somewhere in the 20
Hz to 30 Hz region, I forget the exact number without looking it up.
Unless this built in high pass filter is defeated, an analog Optimod is
not going to help improve the response at 2 Hz.

Regards,

John Byrns

What is needed is a &quot;un-fixing&quot; of the tone circuit.
Hence my previous comments about going stage by stage

Hi Jeff,

It was at least half a year ago that you were doing that modeling, if
the loudness control curve is a big part of the problem I am surprised
that you haven't come up with a new curve yet.  The loudness circuit
typically only involves a single resistor and capacitor, and I can't
imagine any part of the radio that would be easier to modify.  Try some
other R and C values until you find something you like.  I would
probably add a second resistor to the circuit so that the high frequency
gain vs. volume control position wouldn't be changed.

If the problem is that we are no longer plagued with the poor modulation
performance of the old Gates FM transmitters, as you were speculating,
then a simple attenuator in the FM audio path should remedy the problem.
This could be as simple as adding a resistor to the band switch that
would be in series with the top of the volume control in the FM mode.

As far as Lou's suggestion of a 30 Hz high pass filter goes, I suspect
that is not likely to be of much help because the Optimod already
includes a high pass filter with the corner at about 30 Hz.  A more
likely problem is that the Optimod includes a bass equalizer, I will
have to look it up to be sure of the exact parameters, but IIRC it peaks
the bass somewhere around 100 Hz.  To counter this a rolloff starting
much higher than 30 Hz would be needed, perhaps a simple 6 dB/octave
rolloff starting at 150 or 200 Hz would be appropriate.

John Byrns

That was in December, and I've been busy with paying projects
as of late so this got set aside for the time.

&gt; The loudness circuit

There are two taps on the volume control, and as such, two RC
combinations for the loudness compensation. Along with the
other (typical) German radio piano key tone &quot;modifications.&quot;

As I noted earlier:
However, after the loudness control, I found that the bass
response was almost the same level regardless of the volume
setting. For an almost 24 dB change in volume levels above
1 KHz, the level only changed about 6 dB below  100 Hz

On the one Grundig that is sitting in my shop that started
this project, the volume control is about as easy to get to
as the defroster duct on a new car. I will be getting a
similiar radio (circuit wise) that has all the &quot;tweakable
parts&quot; in plain sight making changes take less than 2 hours
a piece.

Actually, I was only commenting that perhaps the low frequency
response was a little higher (less bass) that what is being
broadcast now. And that the radios (notably German) tended to
boost things to compensate for that at the time.

&gt; As far as Lou's suggestion [ snip ]To counter this a rolloff starting
&gt; much higher than 30 Hz would be needed, perhaps a simple 6 dB/octave
&gt; rolloff starting at 150 or 200 Hz would be appropriate.
">

All in all, the radios are fairly simple. It should require only
a simple change to make them sound proper. It should not be a
requirement to add a multiband equalizer to undo what was original
done to &quot;color&quot; the response to begin with.

PS Radiola, stars are for kindergarten and there's a troll in every
group that has fun hitting the first star.

Just because you sent another one of your smartaleck I wanna date you
letters don't think you weren't blocked anyway. The general consensus
of many posters, Usenet or non- Usenet groups on Google is that indeed
this rating thing is nothing more than troll chow.

If you wanna be &quot;gay&quot;, there are no doubt places to socialize as such
close to the Loop. Even in Evanstown.

You wil die alone without me. Move on and be useful.
