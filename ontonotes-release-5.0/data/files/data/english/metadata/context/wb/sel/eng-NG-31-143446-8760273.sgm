WE HAVE BEEN WARNED!
____________________________________________________________
Dear Friends,
The following article, by former Knesset Member Attorney Elyakim
Haetzni, is the most important analysis with regard to Israeli survival
as a Jewish State which you will read in these fateful times.
Read it carefully and send a copy to President Bush, your senators and
congressmen before the 'sacrificial international peace conference&quot; (or,
as some Israeli analysts call it: &quot;the liquidation ceremony&quot;) planned to
be held in Washington, DC, in November.
This conference is planned for the express purpose of establishing a
terrorist Palestinian State on Jewish land.
We will update you in the next few days as to what is being planned to
fight this abomination.
With blessings and love for Israel,
Ruth and Nadia Matar

WE HAVE BEEN WARNED!
by Elyakim Haetzni
August 20th, 2007
Some day we'll recall these tranquil months of headlines devoted to road
accidents and minor scandals ­ the headlines of a society free from
existential cares -- as a fool's paradise whose fools turned a blind eye
to the erupting volcano threatening to bury us all.  There was another
summer like this one preceding Yom Kippur in '73, but this time the
surprise attack is being readied from within, and the calamity will be
diplomatic.
I'm referring to the ritual sacrifice that the Bush administration is
preparing for us this November that goes by the name of a &quot;peace
conference.&quot;  The role of the sacrificial lamb will be filled by
Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, hundreds of Jewish communities, and hundreds
of thousands of Jews that will become refugees in their own land ­ all
this on the backdrop of national, societal, and diplomatic collapse.
The kindling and the fire for the sacrifice will be brought by Shimon
Peres and his perpetual partner in crime, Terje Larsen.  Serving them
are Haim Ramon, Ehud Olmert, and Abu Mazen.  Spurring them on are two
evil and ambitious women who, like the most destructive tornadoes, are
called by cute nicknames: Tzippi and Condi.  On the tombstone the
gravediggers will engrave the words &quot;The Diplomatic Horizon&quot; (for the
Palestinians) and/or &quot;Principles for the Final Status Agreement&quot; and/or
&quot;Framework Agreement for the Establishment of a Palestinian State.&quot;
The conference will deal with &quot;core issues&quot;, that is to say it will
uproot the core and the heart of our hold on our land: Jerusalem,
borders, refugees, destruction of the settlements.
Discussions on these matters are being held continually and urgently to
the end of bringing the sacrificial lamb to Washington on time, already
bound and readied for slaughter.  There are those who are working to
ensure that the sacrificial feast will be well attended --  from
Morocco in the West to the Gulf States in the East.  Israel's enemies
have waited 40 years for this moment when Israel will be forced to
regurgitate all that she swallowed during the Six Day War.  Their eyes
will finally merit to see the ceremony of subjugation whereby the Jews
will return to the Arabs their lost honor and resume their proper
places.  To our enemies' good fortune, manning the helm of Israel's
ship of state is a man supremely appropriate to the task of
self-administering this coup de grace to the Jews  -- a man dogged by
failures and accusations of corruption, whose personal attributes embody
all that is weak, rotten, spoilt, and foundering among the Jews in their
land at this hour . . .
At this &quot;peace&quot; conference, the enemies of Israel from the East and from
the West will dictate the decree that Olmert and his friends are writing
now in absolute secret together with the Americans and the Arabs while
the Israeli public, including the national camp and the settlers,
twiddle their thumbs.  It's comforting to tell ourselves soothing
tales such as how Olmert is weak and Abu Mazen is even weaker, and that
both of them lack the standing and support among their people to
undertake such far-reaching diplomatic initiatives.  There are no lack
of such rationalizing yarns.  Whoever calms themselves in this way
doesn't understand the nature and quality of the liquidation ceremony
that's being prepared for us.
This ceremony doesn't require any strength, in fact it doesn't require
anything at all except for a declaratory statement, ink on paper, the
most feeble exhalation of breath, an effort that even a dying man could
make without difficulty.  However, a declaration like this is enough
to bring about, in the words of Shimon Peres, &quot;the concluding chapter of
the conflict with the Palestinians,&quot; and, in actual truth, the
concluding chapter of Israel's independence.  After this, Israel will
be a state in name only.  In reality Israel will become a protectorate
of the United Nations, whose foreign policy and security are given into
the hands of the Quartet, and whose security, that is to say our lives,
are entrusted to international forces in the North, center, and South of
the country.
At the sacrificial peace conference in Washington, Israel will likely
obligate itself to establish a Palestinian state on its ancestral
inheritance.  The capitol of the new state will be Jerusalem, and not
even one Jew will be allowed to live within its boundaries.
It doesn't matter that the conference will not determine on which street
in Jerusalem and over which hill or through which valley the border will
pass.  It is of no significance that the conference won't decide how
many Arab &quot;refugees&quot; we'll be forced to swallow.  What will be
determined, irrevocably and eternally, this coming year or next year at
the latest, is Palestinian sovereignty as a diplomatic, international,
fact ­ with finality.  The rest truly isn't important.  So too
when they signed the Oslo Accords with only the &quot;Declaration of
Principles.&quot;  In its wake, as thunder follows lightning, we were hit
by the &quot;interim agreement&quot; with all its details that demanded
actualization: areas A, B, and C, the Palestinian &quot;police&quot;, inserting a
terror state infrastructure from Tunis into our borders, and all the
rest of the insane arrangements that buried 1,500 Jews in their land and
prepared the state for its final act of self-immolation in the guise of
a Palestinian state that will turn life in this land into a living hell
-- an irrevocable living hell.
It's not important that the governmental apparatuses of the Palestinian
state will be weak or even non-existent.  It doesn't matter whether a
prime minister or the head of some terrorist faction will rule.  It's
not important if this state has no economy and will live on the handouts
that Israel, the Europeans, and the Americans pay to the gangsters as
protection money for a modicum of quiet.  The world contains a number
of such non-functional states.  Somalia, for example, is ruled by
gangs of tribal thieves and thugs, but that doesn't in the least detract
from Somalian sovereignty and from the land remaining the land of
Somalia according to international law.
Herzl had a vision of a Jewish state arising with international legal
recognition.  Now this vision has been turned on its head, and a
foreign entity is achieving international recognition as sovereign over
the Land of Israel.  And who is promoting this travesty?  The Jews
themselves.
What is the irredeemable, eternal meaning of Palestinian sovereignty?
When Israel liberated Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and Gaza in the Six Day
War, she didn't conquer land that belonged to any sovereign power.
Neither Jordan in Judea and Samaria nor Egypt in Gaza had any sovereign
rights in those territories.  Both had invaded those territories in
1948 in order to frustrate the League of Nations decision of November
29, 1947 recognizing Israel.  Egypt never claimed sovereignty over
Gaza and established military rule there from the beginning.  Jordan,
in contravention of international law, attempted to establish
sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, but renounced this aspiration on its
own initiative in 1988.
Only because of this vacuum in sovereignty was Israel authorized to
utilize state lands to settle Jews in Yesha or to settle the lands in
any way.  Had there been a legal sovereign before Israel's takeover of
those territories, the Hague Convention would have forbidden Israel from
making fundamental changes to the status quo, including the utilization
of state lands.  International law views the conquering military
administration as custodian over the occupied territories until they are
returned to the original sovereign in a future peace agreement.  Until
then, the conquered lands are held in trust by the occupying power.
In the same way, the conqueror is forbidden from excavating antiquities
located in occupied territories.  They too are held in trust for the
conquered power that will eventually regain sovereignty.  Therefore,
coins from the Great Revolt or the Bar Kochba Revolt, bearing images of
the Holy Temple and other Jewish symbols, will belong to the
Palestinians the moment they became sovereign over Judea and Samaria;
Israel will be obligated to give up all the Jewish antiquities that
she's excavated since '67.  All this we will bring upon ourselves the
moment a Jewish hand signs an agreement granting Palestinian sovereignty
over the Land of Israel.
For the Palestinians to win eternal sovereignty over our homeland, it
doesn't matter that Abu Mazen today happens to be weak, or if the day
after signing an agreement he resumes his alliance with Hamas, or that
he resigns, or is assassinated.  From the moment that Palestine is
declared a state, what is done can never be undone.  The Palestinians,
of course, will instigate terror and wars.  The IDF might conquer
Shechem over and over again, but will always be forced to leave and
return the land to the Palestinian sovereign.  This is because the
land has become Palestinian land according to international law from the
moment that Palestinian sovereignty is officially recognized.   Just
so was Berlin conquered and destroyed and divided, but in the end
returned to Germany as its capitol.  Just so the Nazis came and went,
but Germany remained.
I've already described how this scenario is viewed under international
law.  The giants in the field, professors Stone, Rostow, and Schwabel,
have proven how the provisions of the Mandate for Palestine, granted by
the League of Nations to Britain over the Land of Israel, are in force
in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza until this day.  According to the Mandate,
the area of the Land of Israel is allocated under international law as
the national homeland of the Jewish nation 'in recognition of the
historic right of the Jewish people to reestablish their national home
in Palestine' (including, of course, Judea, Samaria, and Gaza).  Why
are the provisions of the Mandate in force to this day despite the fact
that the League of Nations has passed from the world and been replaced
by the United Nations, and despite the fact that England is no longer
here?  The professors have explained that although a part of the lands
of the Mandate have become the internationally recognized State of
Israel and although another part of the lands of the Mandate east of the
Jordan River have become the internationally recognized State of Jordan,
a third part of the Mandate lands, that include Judea, Samaria, Gaza,
and East Jerusalem, were left without a recognized sovereign.  As long
as international law doesn't officially recognize any other sovereignty,
they'll continue to be governed by the provisions of the Mandate, which
states, inter alia, that state lands are to be used for intensive Jewish
settlement, to encourage aliyah, and names the Jewish Agency as a tool
to serve those ends.
When will these Mandate provisions cease to apply?  When another
sovereign will be declared over Judea, Samaria, Gaza, and Jerusalem.
In the first stage, Israel abdicated her right to declare her
sovereignty over Judea, Samaria, and Gaza, and left those lands
undefined and ownerless.  Now she is moving to the next stage, the
stage of the historic terminus of Jewish rights over the Land of Israel,
the stage of voluntary relinquishment of sovereignty and of transferring
her rights to an alien power.  In all the years of our exile and
persecution, there was not found among the Jewish people any authority
willing to sever the people from its beloved land.  We had to return
and persevere here for 120 years, undergoing difficult and bitter
trials, in order to establish a state authorized under international law
to give the Land of Israel a decree of divorce in the name of the Jewish
People, now and forever.
Intensifying the heartbreak is the fact that Judea, Samaria, and Gaza
are the only remaining territories on the entire earth (excepting the
South Pole) which remain ownerless ­ as if an invisible hand guarded
the ancient Jewish home for the Jewish people.  And now that people's
representative is pushing away this hand in an act of historic betrayal
that will resound throughout the generations.  Now the more we ground
and strengthen our claim that we're the real and legal owners of Judea,
Samaria, Gaza, and Jerusalem, the more we'll ground and strengthen the
newly acquired right of the Palestinians to those lands.  After all,
who is most authorized to gift and grant ownership over land if not the
rightful owner?  He and only he can legally effectuate the transfer!
When this despicable act will be final, all else will flow from it.
Whether the Israeli army drags the Jews out by their hair from their
homes on land that has become &quot;Palestine,&quot; or whether it will be left to
the Palestinian murderers in uniform to do the job by themselves, from
the moment land comes under Palestinian sovereignty, that will be the
end of all Jewish life there.
One can almost hear the destroyers talking, from Ramon to Livni and from
Olmert to Peres: Soon the Palestinians will come and sweep away
everything with a giant broom, the legal and established cities together
with the &quot;illegal&quot; outposts and hilltops.   Nothing will remain of
the hated settlement enterprise, and together with its disappearance
will come the collapse of those that bore it, the religious and national
camps that endanger leftist rule.  Our rulers are an elite that
sprouted from what used to be called &quot;the rule of the proletariat&quot;, in
whose name they meant to appropriate the state in perpetuity.  While
the Socialist rationalizations have passed from the world and the elites
represent no one but themselves, the socialist heirs still intend to
rule in perpetuity.
I don't bother to ask, &quot;Where is Netanyahu?&quot; or &quot;Where is the Likud and
its Knesset members?&quot; at this fateful hour.  Neither am I asking where
Lieberman is or what Rav Ovadia and his party are doing.  I'm asking
the settlers whose lands will be the first the Palestinian bulldozer
overturns: &quot;Where are you?!&quot;  &quot;Going up to Homesh&quot;?  The return to
Homesh isn't taking place in a void.  Homesh is not suspended in thin
air.  This enterprise only makes sense and has purpose as part of a
struggle for our continued existence in Judea, Samaria, Gaza, and
Jerusalem that is now in immediate danger of destruction.
We need to gather all the Jews ­ all those who remain Jews ­ while
there's still time and embark on a struggle to the bitter end in order
to prevent at any price taking the one step from which there's no
return, the one additional step that will pull the ground from under us
and fling us into the abyss of Palestinian sovereignty.
Remember, we've been warned!
