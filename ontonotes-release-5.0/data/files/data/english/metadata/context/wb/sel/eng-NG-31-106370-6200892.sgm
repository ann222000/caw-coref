&gt; Smoking ban fallout

&gt; SOUTH BEND -- Many restaurant representatives in St. Joseph County,

Awwww, poor babies ... now let them suffer like the rest of society

places.

Sure.  I eat out about twice a week, and I choose places where I am
permitted to smoke after my meal, even though I have noticed that in
general they are far more crowded than places that have adopted a
non-smoking policy already.  When it is totally banned in England next
year, I will simply eat out far less often.

When many of the eating places close due to dropping business, it will
mean less choice.  The places that remain open will perhaps need to
economise by offering less choice of food, or perhaps they will
increase their prices.

I used to go bowling fairly often as well.  The local bowling alley
recently adopted a no-smoking policy, and so now I rarely go.  Not a
big problem for me because there are plenty of other leisure
activities to choose from.  It used to be the case that all lanes were
booked three hours in advance in the evenings, but the last time I
went there were only about half the lanes in use at 9 PM on a Saturday
night.  The price per person of a game had increased also.

So the ban will also adversely affect non-smokers - and some will be
affected far more than I, as a smoker will be affected.

You glibly spout your, "Adapt or perish," spiel with a triumphant air,
blissfully ignoring the fact that the things that will perish will be
facilities that *you* might have enjoyed.

Typical tobacco-sucking asswipe, waits until after HIS meal to

&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, at the Top Notch Restaurant, on South Bend's west side,
&gt;&gt; many customers have stayed away since the ban, said night manager

&gt;&gt; Top Notch has cut two staffers...  business is about half of what it
&gt;&gt; once was.

&gt;&gt; And at Allie's Café, in the River Park neighborhood on South Bend's
&gt;&gt; east side, Chuck Sulok -- one of several co-owners -- has watched
&gt;&gt; the ban push away some customers. Thanks in part to the ban, Allie's
&gt;&gt; no longer offers dinner.

&gt;&gt; &quot;The smoking ban played a pretty big role in our decision to cut our
&gt;&gt; dinner hours,&quot; he said.

&gt;&gt; http://www.southbendtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061001/N...
&gt;&gt; 01001

&gt; Its interesting that you only posted certain portions of that article.
&gt; At least you did post a link to the article. Thank you for the link.

&gt; Here's the entire first paragraph of that same article ...

&gt; &quot;SOUTH BEND -- Many restaurant representatives in St. Joseph County,
&gt; including some whose establishments have suffered from almost six
&gt; months of a smoking ban, say it's time to finish the job and
&gt; eliminate all exceptions&quot;

&gt; What's missing from the excerpt that you posted is the statement that
&gt; these restaurant owners actually support strengthening the public
&gt; smoking ban, not eliminating it.

&gt; You also missed an entire paragraph ...

&gt; &quot;Their view, motivated by a desire to stay competitive, echoes the &quot;no
&gt; exceptions&quot; approach toward smoking in public places that local health
&gt; advocates have been promoting for months.&quot;

&gt; You also neglected to include this paragraph ...

&gt; &quot;But others contend local officials can improve the ordinance by
&gt; nixing exceptions that were included in an effort to soften the ban's
&gt; blow.&quot;

&gt; I also noticed you left out some other key information, so here it is
&gt; ...

&gt; &quot;&quot;The smoking ban played a pretty big role in our decision to cut our
&gt; dinner hours,&quot; he said.

&gt; But it wasn't the only factor, he said, adding that higher gas prices
&gt; likely kept some customers away, and Allie's needed to focus more on
&gt; its catering anyway.&quot;

&gt; Notice that other factors besides the smoking ban are also attributed
&gt; toward a reduction in business such as higher gas prices.

&gt; Here's another section of the same article ...

&gt; &quot;As she remembers, the first customers to walk into Fiddler's Hearth
&gt; after the ban had wanted to come before but had stayed away because of
&gt; the bar area smoking that had been permitted.

&gt; &quot;I think we've lost some and gained some,&quot; Meehan said.

&gt; That's a perception that Allie's Sulok shares. Even though his
&gt; restaurant has lost customers overall, he said, it has managed to
&gt; attract some new ones.&quot;

&gt; Notice closely where it says, &quot;Even though his restaurant has lost
&gt; customers overall, he said, it has managed to attract some new ones.&quot;
&gt; and I suspect that if this restaurant is managed effectively, more new
&gt; customers will start to come in and maybe even some of the smokers who
&gt; took their tails between their legs and went home will start to return
&gt; too.

&gt; You gloss over the entire point of this article which is that although
&gt; restaurant owners oppose this ban on general principles, they say &quot;the
&gt; devil is in the details&quot; and their biggest concern is the exceptions
&gt; to the ban, more than the ban itself.

Post ban, you'll still be permitted to smoke after your meal.  It's just
that you'll have to do it outside.  Having lived in a place which operated a
complete ban on smoking in enclosed public places (CA) I cannot say it
detracted from the atmosphere one bit and the good places to eat or drink
were still heaving.  I have little doubt that that is how it will turn out
here as well.

You could, of course, smoke your cigarettes at home after dinner, or
outside after dinner. You do intend to eventually leave each restaurant
where you dine, right? You have to go outside anyway so just hold off on
smoking until you step outside. I just don't see what the big deal is.

Gee, to whom were these respondents.

Fathers, husbands or your next door neighbor.

Well, these votes were desire. So wonder how many would take the plunge
and partake.

I am quite proud to say yes and raise my hand.

Why as posted quite legal, ethical and morally acceptable.

See you did not catch the link yesterday; imagine taking her to the
cigar club with you.

I don't have to imagine, it's a beautiful thing in reality. I loved
the jealous look of men, and offer to buy the Mrs. a drink.

Now why would they do that hummmmmmmmmm.

Whatever makes you believe that?  I have never heard of any smoker
opposing the introduction of non-smoking areas in pubs and
restaurants.  So long as the smoker has somewhere they can smoke that
has the same facillities as the non-smoking areas, they are perfectly
content.

On the contrary, it is the anti-smoking lobby that is unwilling to
make any compromise whatsoever, even when such a compromise will have
minimum impact upon their wishes.  ISTM that that lobby is not so much
interested in having smoke-free areas as in preventing people from
smoking regfardless of whether the smoking affects them in any way.
You can see it in the rhetoric they use, which is slanted more toward
slagging off smokers than it is toward demanding smoke-free areas for
themselves.

Not if there are perfectly reasonable non-smoking areas and/or a good
selection of completely non-smoking restaurants.  I can get to enjoy
my pleasure alongside people who are smokers or who do not mind, and
you get to choose a place that is completely smoke free.  I have no
wish to prohibit smoke-free restaurants or areas so that people who
are bothered can enjoy their meals in a way that they want to.  I will
simply choose not to use such places because they detract from *my*
pleasure.  I do not understand why you cannot have a similar view and
not want to allow any facillities whatsoever to accomodate smokers.

A very dear next door neighbour of mine years ago, died of Cancer and it was
stated that it was due to passive smoking in the office.

Question to the smokers. You are quite free to smoke as it gives you
pleasure and I will put up with your output/residue, call it what you will,
spoiling my clothes and making them smell, IF, I can indulge in my pleasure,
which happens to be drinking tea. Now the output/residue of that is that I
need to pee. May I pee all over your clothes and make them smell as your
pleasure make mine smell?

Individual smokers might not object; I am sure the smoking lobby would have
objected.  Such a law would have concentrated the minds of many restaurants
and pubs and made them consider whether the custom of smokers was worth the
expenditure in air extractors.  It is quite possible that a number of
establishments would have taken the line of least resistance and gone smoke
free anyway.

&gt;&gt; Yes, and a very selfish world it is.  Fortunately it is not *all* of

And how exactly was that conclusion arrived at?  Doctors are not above

between cancer and active smoking.  I know people who have died of

&gt;Individual smokers might not object; I am sure the smoking lobby would have

If that assumption were correct than why bother with a mandatory ban?
I often hear the anti-smoking lobby claiming that non-smoking
establishments are more porofitable than smoking establishments.  If
that were true, then no need to force a ban at all - just let market
forces do the job - and in fact if it were the case that it was not
profitable to cater for my particular needs, then I'd be quite happy
to accept that as a fact of life.  It is what appears to have happened
in the airline industry.

&gt;&gt;that is not a fair comparison, one does not throw dessert or coffee all

Do you consider the number of non-smoking restaurants (prior to law

Providing "appropriate air extractors" is measured by the response of

What is or is not a "reasonable number" would depend on the number of
people who wanted to use each type.

IMO it can safely be left to market forces to strike the correct
balance and legislation is neither necessary nor desirable.

If the demand for non-smoking restaurants outstrips the number
available, then the owner of one of the smoking restaurants will soon
realise this and convert his place to non-smoking and make a killing.
conversely, if there are more smokers desiring to eat out than the
number of smoking restaurants can accomodate, someone will begin to
allow smoking in order to attract those customers.

So why do you think market forces have not worked?  ISTM that if there
were a large number of people who had a preference for a totally
non-smoking establishment, that pubs and other commercial
establishments that introduced such a policy voluntarily would attract
all those people and so make the policy worthwhile.  Eventually there
would be a ratio between smoking, no smoking and mixed establishments
that was roughly the same as the ratio of people who wished to make
use of each type of place.  It is what works well for just about every
other type of preference that pub/club/restaurant goers want.

&gt;&gt; Don't be silly. A non-smoking area in a restaurant is like a

&gt; It would with proper ventilation.  I'm sure you're unaware of the

Why do you naively think "market forces" DO work?

"Market forces", left alone, consume and destroy all they touch,
producing the maximal profit for the business without regard to
health, safety or welfare of either employees, customers or environment.
They always have, and always will.

The "market forces" you so blindly worship resulted in Ford Motor Company
deliberately continuing to produce exploding Ford Pintos, and the projected
payments/costs from Wrongful Death and Injury Lawsuits against them was LESS
than the projected cost to redesign/recall/retrofit 100,000s of Pintos.

Your lame retreat to some inane Economic Theory does nothing to
address the issues of HUMAN HEALTH and SAFETY (or environmental).
