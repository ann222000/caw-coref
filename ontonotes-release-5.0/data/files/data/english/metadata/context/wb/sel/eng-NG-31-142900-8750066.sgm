August 8th - Bl. Peter Faber

Born 13 April, 1506, at Villaret, Savoy; died 1 Aug., 1546, in Rome. As a
child
he tended his father's sheep during the week, and on Sunday he taught
catechism
to other children. The instinctive knowledge of his vocation as an apostle
inspired him with a desire to study. At first he was entrusted to the care
of a
priest at Thônes, and then to a neighbouring school. Although without any
definite plans for the future, he resolved to go to Paris. His parents
consented
to the separation, and in 1525 Peter arrived in Paris. Here he acquired the
learning he desired, and found quite unexpectedly his real vocation. He was
admitted gratuitously to the college of Sainte-Barbe, and shared the lodging
of
a student from Navarre, Francis Xavier, the future saint, in a tower which
still
existed in 1850. They became intimately attached to each other, receiving on
the
same day in 1530 the degree of master of arts. At the university he also met
St.
Ignatius of Loyola and became one of his associates. He was ordained in
1834,
and received at Montmartre, on 15 August of the same year, the vows of
Ignatius
and his five companions. To these first six volunteers, three others were to
attach themselves. Ignatius appointed them all to meet at Venice, and
charged
Faber to conduct them there. Leaving Paris 15 Nov., 1536, Faber and his
companions rejoined Ignatius at Venice in Jan., 1537. Ignatius then thought
of
going to evangelize the Holy Land, but God had destined him for a vaster
field
of action.

After Ignatius, Faber was the one whom Xavier and his companions esteemed
the
most eminent. He merited this esteem by his profound knowledge, his gentle
sanctity, and his influence over souls. Faber now repaired to Rome, and
after
some months of preaching and teaching, the pope sent him to Parma and
Piacenza,
where he brought about a revival of Christian piety. Recalled to Rome, Faber
was
sent to Germany to uphold Catholicism at the Diet of Worms. In reality the
diets
which the Protestants were enabled to hold through the weakness of Charles
accomplished no good. From the Diet of Worms, convoked in 1540, he was
called to
that of Ratisbon in 1541. Faber was startled by the ruin which Protestantism
had
caused in Germany, and by the state of decadence presented by Catholicism;
and
he saw that the remedy did not lie in discussions with the heretics, but in
the
reform of the faithful - above all, of the clergy. For ten months, at
Speyer, at
Ratisbon, and at Mainz, he conducted himself with gentleness and success. It
was
above all by the Spiritual Exercises that he accomplished most of his
conversions. Princes, prelates, and priests revealed their consciences to
him,
and people were astounded by the efficacy of an apostolate accomplished so
rapidly.

Recalled to Spain by St. Ignatius, Faber tore himself away from the field
where
he had already gathered such a harvest, and won Savoy, which has never
ceased to
venerate him as a saint; but he had hardly been in Spain six months when by
order of the pope he was again sent to Germany. This time for nineteen
months
Faber was to work for the reform of Speyer, Mainz, and Cologne - a thankless
task. However, he gained the ecclesiastics little by little, changed their
hearts, and discovered in the young many vocations. That he decided the
vocation
of Bl. Peter Canisius is in itself sufficient to justify his being called
the
Apostle of Germany. The Archbishop of Cologne, Herman of Wied, was already
won
over by the heresy which he was later publicly to embrace. It was also at
Cologne that Faber especially exercised his zeal. After spending some months
at
Louvain, in 1543, where he implanted the seeds of numerous vocations among
the
young, he returned to Cologne, and there it may be said that he extirpated
all
heresy. But he was forced by obedience to leave Germany in August, 1544,
going
at first to Portugal, later to Spain. At the court of Lisbon and that of
Valladolid, Faber was an angel of God. He was called to the principal cities
of
Spain, and everywhere inculcated fervour and fostered vocations.

Let it suffice to mention that of Francis Borgia, which he, more than anyone
else, was the means of strengthening. Faber, at forty, was wasted by his
incessant labours and his unceasing journeys always made on foot. The pope,
however, thought of sending him to the Council of Trent as theologian of the
Holy See; John III wanted him to be made Patriarch of Ethiopia. Called to
Rome,
Faber, weakened by fever, arrived there 17 July, 1546, to die in the arms of
St.
Ignatius, the first of the following August. Those who had known him already
invoked him as a saint. Saint Francis de Sales, whose character recalled
that of
Faber's, never spoke of him except as a saint. He was beatified, 5
September,
1872; his feast is kept on 8 August.

Quote:
Humility is necessary not only for the acquisition of virtues, but even for
salvation.  For the gate of Heaven, as Christ Himself testifies, is so
narrow
that it admits only little ones.
-St. Bernard

Bible Quote
10. He hath not dealt with us according to our sins: nor rewarded us
according
to our iniquities.  11. For  according to the height of the heaven above the
earth: he hath strengthened his mercy towards them that fear him.  (Psalms
102:10-11)

Indulgenced Prayers

O saving Victim, opening wide
The gate of heaven to man below,
Our foes press on from every side;
Thine aid supply, Thy strength bestow.

To Thy great Name be endless praise,
Immortal Godhead, one in three;
Oh, grant us endless length of days
In our true native land with Thee.
Amen.

Blessed is He Who cometh in the Name of the Lord:
Hosanna in the highest.

Jesu, bread of life, protect us;
Shepherd kind, do not reject us;
In Thy happy fold collect us,
And partakers of the bliss elect us,
Which shall never see an end.

Thou, the wisest and the mightiest,
Who us here with food delightest,
Seat us at Thy banquet brightest
With the blessed Thou invitest
An eternal feast to spend.
Amen.
