Because Australian time is ahead of British time, I got this breaking
news on 5 July.

http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22025326-2,00.html

If correct, data collected by the Schmidt Telescope of the Anglo-
Australian Observatory at Siding Spring, NSW, indicates that the mass
of the Milky Way is ~3 x 10^45 g, of which 94% is dark matter.

These new empirical results, when combined with two remarkable
published examples of the separation of DM and LM in galaxy cluster
collisions, along with a host of previous but less compelling
empirical results, tell us in the clearest manner that large amounts
of galactic dark matter exist, and probably the DM is not comprised of
any common form of baryonic matter.

If one's theory proposes that the dark matter does not exist, or
exists only in small amounts, or is probably baryonic, then that
theory appears to be in trouble.

The key question, obviously, concerns the physical nature of all this
dark matter, which completely dominates the observable universe.
Happily, AGILE is now successfully in orbit and is completing its
initial testing phase.  If the dark matter is in ultracompact objects,
such as primordial black holes of planetary and stellar masses, these
objects should emit faint gamma radiation due to accretion of
interstellar matter.  AGILE might be able to detect a MWG gamma ray
halo and distinguish it from the gamma ray background radiation.  The
GLAST mission will have an even better chance of  doing so.

Alternatively, the gamma ray missions might discover radiation that is
more consistent with annihilation of WIMPS, or some form of exotic
particle.  And the LHC might help in verifying such particles.

The exciting thing is that the dark matter enigma cannot resist for
much longer the determined efforts of experimentalists to solve it.
And when we answer the dark matter riddle, we are almost guaranteed to
have a profoundly clarified understanding of the cosmos.

A corresponding barrage of refs would be helpful.

I agree.
If the figure of 94% is in the correct ball park, this even puts the
concordance model of EFE out of the picture, doesn't it?
The figure is more appropriate to the flat no lambda model of EFE,
which is itself ruled out by accelerating expansion.

I am inclined to disagree. If all it can do is gravitate, does it
really matter what it is? Far more important, in my eyes, is getting
the relativistic field equation spot on, this time around.

However, there is bound to considerable resistance to such a
revolutionary change, after all this time. Consequently, what I am
really saying in reply is: &quot;Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition&quot;

Note that they are talking about the mass of the Milky Way.  When
talking about the &quot;concordance model of EFE&quot;, the AVERAGE density of the
universe enters (where the averaging is done on scales much larger than
the Milky Way).

True, but  If the given figure is not a typo, 94% of the milky way is
dark matter, leaving just 6% baryonic matter.
94 / 6 &gt; 15 / 1

Now, to get that figure down to ~ what you need for the concordance
model, you will have to postulate:

1) Vastly more baryonic than dark matter outside of galaxies.
2) Vastly more baryonic matter outside of galaxies, than inside.
3) In view of the resultant opacity problem, you now have to
speculate
that most of the mass of the universe is intergalactic  _baryonic_
bricks.

As I have already posted under the other title, &quot;show me my ad hoc
assumptions, and I will show you yours.&quot;

Point 3 to me, I think.
