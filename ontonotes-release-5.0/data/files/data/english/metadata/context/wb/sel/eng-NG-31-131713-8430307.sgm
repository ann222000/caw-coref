Our Jon Who Has Done All Things Musical.... sent the glorious Parsnip
a film, which will be watched tonight as well as a recording of works
by Ralph Vaughan Williams... conducted by a conductor of which I have
only one recording.  So this will be a treat.

Remember, unlike Star Wars, you can NEVER have too much Vaughan
Williams.

Many thanks, Jon.

His encounters will not create a book worth the effort.  The question is
does he have the musicological skill and time to spend a few years to create
a viable work?

Speaking of RVW, do you like  'Job - A Masque For Dancing' ?  Its
always been one of my favorite 20th century ballets.

Oddly enough: no.

There is one passage I like very much, though, that is very beautiful.

Elihu's Dance of Youth &amp; Beauty is mersmerizing.

Maybe someday I will give the whole piece another whirl... sometimes
things grow on you over time...

Like warts?

Hi all.  Now that I finally managed to work out the problems with my
burner, I hope to reciprocate some gifts of my own to the many of you
who were so kind to keep me in listening heaven over the past couple
of months.

But first........EMAILS!

BTW:  Had the family birthday fandango last weekend down at L.B.I.,
and sis and bro got tons of musical gifts from me.  Red, Cafe Paradiso
and Body heat were among them.  Those two recordings have actually
helped me &quot;keep it together&quot; during these rough times.  Strange, huh?
Regardless, they've become very special to me, so I wanted to pass
them along.  Thank you.

Gummers, you too have been a life-saver, and we still have that phone
date to keep!  Will be dropping you an email later on today.

Best wishes to all....CJ aka double X

Oh yes... but they can be removed... or ignored.

Music is life.  It keeps all of us together during the bad times as
well as the good.  And you should be shortly updated on Miss Potter
the film &amp; score... which Gummy has known about for some time but
failed to mention.  The twit and a half.

I just got a present from my favorite...no...wait a minute.  This
can't be from my favorite veggie.  It's got Star Wars stamps on it!
Yep.  It's from Red alright.  Gosh, you feelin' okay, Red?  (He must
be sicker than we know.)

Ahhh...Miss Potter film and score!  Can't wait to watch and listen.

Just stuck in The Last Mimzy and had to cheat by going to the last
track, the song with Roger Waters.  Tell me this isn't right off The
Wall....Comfortably Numb to be exact.  The music's toned down, but
there's no doubt who wrote the lyrics, huh?  A bit repetative, but
okay for a film song.

Will comment more later on.

Ask Cleo... unlike Gummy Flotz Bottom, she's listened AND watched the
film... and acknowldges the merit of both.

I dunno.  Sounded to me like watered down ancient Moody Blues.  It
doesn't fit the film... but... someone thought it did.

That reminds me of that LOST IN SPACE EPISODE where this giant alien
carrot was planning a revolt against the Robinsons for eating
vegetables. I think it was called THE GREAT VEGETABLE REVOLT.

Yes, yes, of course it was.  Now sit quietly.  Here, take these Legos
and make a furnace out of 'em, then try and hawk it to Mrs.
Quiddley-Forester down the hall. Wait until the afternoon, in the
morning she's usually having an out of body experience with a puppet
(so crude) in the body of a whale.

I'm serious. The stupid episode was in the third season where they got
really ridiculous. It was played by one of those British character
actors we see in everything in television during those days in the
sixties.
