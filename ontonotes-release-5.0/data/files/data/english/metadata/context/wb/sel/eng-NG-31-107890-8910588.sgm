Second socket to the right of the meter is your octal socket. The first one
to the right is a Loctal® type.

The one on the left with the larger pin holes is the octal socket. The
one on the right with the smaller holes and the metal contact in the
center is the loctal socket.

If you are so unfamiliar with tube technology that you do not
recognize with octal and loctal bases then you are likely ill-prepared
to calibrate this instrument.

So Dale,
Your saying that someone should not attempt anything until they know
everything.

I'm a ex TV repairman from the 70's who moved into computer repair in
the 80's.
As a ex-Sears bench repairman I never needed a tube tester, I had
access to all the new tubes I needed.
Now I'm retired and I'm learning about tube testers.
So I think I'm more then qualified to calibrate a tube tester.
I just need some guidience.

Question: why is this socket called a &quot;octal&quot;, when both sockets have
access for 8pin tubes?

because is doesn't have a lock on the socket like a Loctal socket has!
and the Octal predated the Loctal by quite a few years... why they called
them... 4,5,6,7 and Octal instead of 8 ?... beats me... later they had
to start calling the 7... 7 largepin after 7 mini came out...

If your going to keep that Hickok 600A you should invest a few bucks
in a &quot;Calibration Tube&quot; .... its really a metal 6L6 good one thats
checked on someone that has a calibrated tester... they mark on tube
what it should read... you stuff into your tester and adjust to read
those numbers... the better tube guys will supply one if requested..

Let us know how the calibration comes out. I've tried several times,
using two routines, and have never successfully calibrated one. And I
have never seen two 600A's that checked a tube the same. Ken

Adjust what? As far as I know, the only adjustment for umho reading is
the shunt pots. If all voltages are correct, is that the only way to
cal? Ken

I think more precisely because it has eight pins.

The fact that years later another 8-pin tube came long does not mean
the original is no longer 8-pins.  ANd it makes sense to keep the
naming constant, so all the people who knew about octal tubes didn't
wonder what this new &quot;zibit&quot; was.

That it confuses latecomers is irrelevant, since both carry disctintive
names.  ANd of course, the &quot;loctal&quot; name, if you dissect it, makes
perfect sense, an 8pin or &quot;octal&quot; tube with something added.  That
suggests it's more than an octal.

Terry, I don't think Dale was trying to be condescending but your
question shows that you have not had much experience with tubes. The
point he was trying to make is that you might actually get that tester
way off calibration which could be easily done. Has nothing to do with
actual  electronic education but real world experience with these
testers. There are only a few people left who really know these critters
as the way they were calibrated was not pure science but each model had
it's own way of being brought into spec. We lost a couple of guys in the
past couple years who were real experts on these, Chris Haedt and
Wendell Hall are 2 I know of. The more you read up on these the better
you will be able to use and understand exactly what they are testing. I
would suggest Alan Douglas' book &quot;Tube Testers and Classic Electronic
Test Gear&quot;, it covers a lot of ground and is just fun reading(if you
love testers like I do)!

No, only that one should at least know the basics of any technology
that they want to work with.
