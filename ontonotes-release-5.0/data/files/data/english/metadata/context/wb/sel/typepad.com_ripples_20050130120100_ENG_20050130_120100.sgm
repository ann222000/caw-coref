Starbucks charges a pretty penny for wireless access and they are
doing the competition an enormous favor. If you are not up to paying
starbucks a $30 monthly fee for wireless access, you can expect to cough
up $6.95 per day to check your email. (cough! cough!)

This makes it easy for other coffee shops and small restaurants to
attract customers by offering free wireless access. Offering free
wireless access can be the determining factor in staying competitive in
a saturated market.

Any business that needs more customers should consider what would
happen to sales if they offered free wireless access. They don't always
need to provide tables, all that is necessary are places to sit down or
places to stand with a shelf to support a laptop.

Bookstores, museums, libraries, snack bars, and some retail stores
might well profit from the extra traffic that free wireless internet
access can bring. How about bowling alleys, barbershops, cocktail
lounges, singles bars and pubs? This puts a new twist on old business
models.

In my recent visit to Floyd, VA, I took full advantage of the free
internet access offered by the Cafe Del Sol to upload posts. I was
interested to see that my wife, Gretchen, wanted time to check her email
once she saw how effortless it was.

Oddfellas Cantina is expecting to follow suit in the next few weeks.
It will be interesting to see how it affects their lunchtime business.

Some experts feel that Starbucks will not be able to continue
charging for access for much longer, but they have certainly established
a pattern that is changing the way salesmen and other road warriors do
business. This NYT article by Katie Hafner suggests that free internet
access builds customer loyalty as well as increased traffic.

Ubiquitous internet access will create a phenomena like the cellphone
craze. Everyone will be online at all trimes. The increased speed of
communication means that more business will be done in less time.

Of course, you may have already figured out where this is
leading....to more stress and higher burnout rates, but that's the
subject of a future post. David, absolutely agree with you on how
certain perks (like wireless access) can build customer loyalty. Wish we
had a locally-owned coffee establishment that offered wi-fi. As it is,
Panera Bread does and they've become a familiar office away from home.
Even if Starbucks does go free wi-fi, Panera still has them beat since
they have free refills on very good coffee.

Starbucks is providing a pricing umbrella that allows smart
competitors to establish a foothold with the mobile digerati. Free
refills and good service will keep customers coming back even after
Starbucks folds their umbrella and provides wireless access at no cost
to customers. Your comment about Panera bread indicates that wi-fi
access can broaden the customer base for many restaurants. One cannot
ignore such an opportunity in the highly competitive world of fast food
restaurants.

Indeed, I look to a future when I can blog from anywhere. (Next step:
cash enough to buy that laptop.) But I came here for your imput on
Floyd. (You can thank Doug Thompson) I live almost three hours away in
Greensboro, NC., but on the rare day I have away from the day job I've
been known to drive to Odd Fellas for lunch then turn around and drive
home. (Usually with a stop at Floyd County Drygoods to visit with Amy
and buy homemade bread. Tell her I said, "Howdy!") I love everything
about Floyd and wish I was there now.

One thing that Starbucks and T-Mobile are offering, though they're
not advertising it very well, is *stable* wireless. (Well, relatively
stable, anyway.) Less than a tenth of a mile from "my" Starbucks is
another coffee shop, Cambridge Coffee, with free wireless. We tried it
one morning, couldn't get a consistant connection, and gave up. It just
wasn't worth the hassle. Same ol' song... you get what you pay for.

I think that free wireless access will become more common. The unit
price of such a perk is very low...yet the benefit perceived by
customers is fairly high. There is potential for abuse, but that can be
mitigated by limiting the time or bandwidth allowed. If you desire a
longer connection or more bandwidth, then you have to pay for it.

David: I subscribed to T-Mobile's Wi-Fi service for nearly two years
to use in both Starbucks and Border's bookstores while traveling. During
a prolonged trip to the St. Louis area in 2003, the Border's in Fairview
Heights, Illinois, became my office for several hours a day (it reached
the point where the counter staff in the store's cafe would bring me
refills of coffee). It saved my butt during the 2004 elections. I also
used Panera's free service in the St. Louis area (their shops are called
St. Louis Bread Company there) but the service kicks you off after 90
minutes. T-Mobile's advantage was T-1 speed. Many of the free services
in locally-owned coffee shops run off cable modems or DSL running at
slower speeds (the service at Cafe del Sol in Floyd runs at 384K) but I
think you're right that free services are a perk that will become
standard fare at most coffee shops. We can hope. BTW, the City of
Roanoke offers free Wi-Fi in their downtown area (although it is
time-limited). It even works on benches on the street and in plazas.
Hopefully, that is something other comunities will consider.
