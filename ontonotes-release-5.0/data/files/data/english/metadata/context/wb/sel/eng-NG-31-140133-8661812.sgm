My God. I have never been to your city and from what I saw last night
on the Travel Channel which had an hour long presentation on
Cleveland, I never want to. I have never seen such drabness, decay and
squalor in any American city, not to mention the constant bleakness
with snow flurries constantly flying about and everything appearing to
be in black and white even though it was actually in full color. They
had people surfing in the winter on Lake Erie right next to the
warning signs of a sewer outlet, and food which at best was suited for
contestants on Fear Factor. They even had a disclaimer which appeared
twice in the hour warning that what you were about to see may not be
appropriate for all viewers. I guess the best new for you fans is that
as pitiful as the Browns are, they are not the worst thing about
living in Cleveland.

Cleveland is a shithole, wow, major scoop! However I make a decent living,
live in a nice house which elsewhere would cost 3x what it costs here. I
feel bad for people who pay $300,000 for a house that's really worth about
$100,000. I'll probably flee to the Carolinas or Tennessee in a few years
regardless because I hate cold weather. But all in all, people make it out
to be Beruit or something. I haven't seen anything here that I haven't seen
in any other major city.

According to the program I saw on the Travel Channel Cleveland has
been crumbling since at least the 60's. Although I agree you that the
money being spent on Iraq is a total waste, that can hardly be the
blamed for what has happened to Cleveland. I would assume that at one
time it was a livable place even though there have always been many
jokes told at the expense of your city. Since I have never been there
my only means to judge the city is what was shown and what I have
heard for many years. What I saw was a dilapidated, colorless,
crumbling town with a demoralized and dying population which they said
has been cut in half since the 60's. It's hard to believe but they
said the median salary for those who have stayed is only 15 thousand
dollars.  That really can't be right I think. Is it? Even the host of
this particular presentation who was a long time Clevelander piled on
trash talk about the city. I would have to believe that if the Travel
Channel could have found anything better about the city to show they
certainly would have shown it, as they didn't make any friends in
Cleveland with that hour long presentation of rust and decay. I can
assure you that if and when the Travel Channel features Baltimore you
will see a vibrant town with up-beat opinions, hope, pride and plenty
to show that is positive. Two years ago prestigious Frommers ranked
Baltimore as one of the top 10 summer travel destinations in the WORLD

So said the president today about New Orleans but have you seen
pictures? What sort of natural or man made disaster is the city
rebuilding from, a nuclear blast?  Cleveland has been crumbling were
not my words. It was the opinion of the Travel Channel which can
certain give a valid opinion about the state of a town and it was
backed up by the host who was a local.

I didnt see this episode but somebody gave a rundown of it elsewhere and
frankly I havent even heard of half the crap they mentioned or featured and
I've lived here for 32 years.

As for the annual income thing, don't mistake Cleveland with the surrounding
area. Nobody with any money lives near the city. It's all about the burbs.
Look, Cleveland relied heavily on the steel industy, therefore it never was
and never will be a glitz and glamor town. But somebody had to do it and
this nation benefited greatly from our services until the politicians fucked
everything up.

A bit to mild for bernout don't ya think? Plus they announced yesterday that
MD was the richest state in the nation (though morally bankrupt IMO).
Wouldn't that have been utilized by the Jewish foot jihad'ist  ; - )

As Rave-On said... if you come to B'more you will see much of the harbor and
surrounding areas rejuvenated. Just don't to far beyond that minute area

Something to be said for the good reasoning behind the B&amp;O Railroad besides

Baltimore and Ohio benefited from each other for so long and in many ways

There are new residential places downtown where some folks have moved to
in recent years.

There's Browns Stadium, Great Lakes Science Museum, Rock &amp; Roll Museum,
Jacobs Field, Quicken Loans Arena, the CSU Convocation Center, Steel
Yard Commons.

Before that, the Playhouse Square Renovation.

Now they're working on the Euclid Avenue Transportation Corridor,
linking Tower City with University Circle and the medical industry in
between.

Next will come the redesign and reconstruction of the I-90 innerbelt.

The town hasn't stood still.

Although the burbs have the affluence, there's still a considerable
amount of regional power and money that comes into the central city to
transact business.

It's preparation for an eventual shift to some form of regional
government. Toronto has it. Some American cities already have it as well.

The $30 million would pay for whatever priorities New Orleans needed to
strengthen public safety, including the hiring of additional cops.  That

&gt;&gt; My God. I have never been to your city and from what I saw last night
&gt;&gt; on the Travel Channel which had an hour long presentation on
&gt;&gt; Cleveland, I never want to. I have never seen such drabness, decay and
&gt;&gt; squalor in any American city, not to mention the constant bleakness
&gt;&gt; with snow flurries constantly flying about and everything appearing to
&gt;&gt; be in black and white even though it was actually in full color. They
&gt;&gt; had people surfing in the winter on Lake Erie right next to the
&gt;&gt; warning signs of a sewer outlet, and food which at best was suited for
&gt;&gt; contestants on Fear Factor. They even had a disclaimer which appeared
&gt;&gt; twice in the hour warning that what you were about to see may not be
&gt;&gt; appropriate for all viewers. I guess the best new for you fans is that
&gt;&gt; as pitiful as the Browns are, they are not the worst thing about
&gt;&gt; living in Cleveland.

&gt;Cleveland is a shithole, wow, major scoop! However I make a decent living,
&gt;live in a nice house which elsewhere would cost 3x what it costs here. I
&gt;feel bad for people who pay $300,000 for a house that's really worth about
&gt;$100,000. I'll probably flee to the Carolinas or Tennessee in a few years
&gt;regardless because I hate cold weather. But all in all, people make it out
&gt;to be Beruit or something. I haven't seen anything here that I haven't seen
&gt;in any other major city.
">

I think that your view of housing prices does not take into
consideration the difference between what you bought a house for and
what you can sell it for. I purchased my house in the greater
Baltimore metropolitan area for about 150K not all that  number of
years ago. Today I could sell it for half a million or more than 3
times what I paid for it for a profit of at least 350K. In your case,
suppose by your example you paid 50K for the house in Cleveland and
now its worth 150. If you sold it you would pocket only 100K. When you
move to the warmer climate like you say you will you will have sticker
shock and that 100K won't go very far. So you would have been far
better off in an area where housing prices were comparable to the rest
of the country and you would have made a far better profit.

The show I mentioned was produced for people who like to travel and
the producers have every reason to present a realistic picture of
whatever location they are filming. I'm sure that many Clevelanders
have gotten a lot of practice having to defend their city since  it
has forever been known as a lack luster town and the brunt of many
jokes. But it is what it is and I see no reason why a channel
dedicated to travel would purposely give the picture they did if it
wasn't true. Other cities do have their problems but in spite of how
you defend it Cleveland was shown as just a horrible horrible place to
exist. That's the picture I and I'm sure most others got of your town.
If you have a beef take it up with the Travel Channel. I'm just the
messenger.

The best way to describe Bernice is this: He (or she) was kind of like a
perverted bum who hops a train (to flee the police - again) to another
city and then trys to give candy to little kids in the park. Just a
really sick twisted freak. I almost felt sorry for him (or her). Some
folks are just born with something wrong with them. The poor slob.

But thanks for the info on the Travel Channel show. Make sure to let all
of the Cleveland ng's know about this, not just the football ng. You
know, maybe there's a Cleveland gardening forum or something you could
pass this info on to. Just a thought....:)

Jeeze, I only mentioned New Orleans because someone said that
Cleveland was rebuilding and I answered- You mean like New Orleans is
rebuilding? to point up that saying a city is rebuilding means very
little when there is so little to show for it. The topic was Cleveland
as shown on the Travel Channel. I'm sure you would rather change the
subject to  New Orleans of Calcutta but that is not the topic. Some of
you here seem  to have a hair trigger and refuse to address the issue.
The Travel Channel showed your city in a very bad light and all you
can talk about is idiot mayors and thieves in another city. But its
senseless to attack me. I didn't invent any of this. I just know what
I saw on TV and it wasn't very pretty. Who here who has commented even
saw the telecast?

&gt;The best way to describe Bernice is this: He (or she) was kind of like a
&gt;perverted bum who hops a train (to flee the police - again) to another
&gt;city and then trys to give candy to little kids in the park. Just a
&gt;really sick twisted freak. I almost felt sorry for him (or her). Some
&gt;folks are just born with something wrong with them. The poor slob.

&gt;But thanks for the info on the Travel Channel show. Make sure to let all
&gt;of the Cleveland ng's know about this, not just the football ng. You
&gt;know, maybe there's a Cleveland gardening forum or something you could
&gt;pass this info on to. Just a thought....:)

Thanks for the explanation JB. You have supplied me with some real
interesting reading today. I tried searching out posts from a Bernie
or Bernice and initially found none. But I did see a lot of posts from
more than a year ago replying  to someone that posted as Brown-Basher
and those who wrote back to him called him Bernie and sometimes
Bernice or other variations of that. So I think I got the right guy (I
assume that it's not a gal). I first have to say that I am impressed
that some of you thought that was me because he wrote in a really good
style with an impressive use of words. But on the other hand, I see
that it was common for anyone who posted either from Baltimore or
against the Browns and wrote reasonably well to be accused of being
him.  In spite of what you have said about him I saw nothing perverted
in what he posted although he certainly was not a fan of Cleveland or
your Browns. In fact the only thing I can see that you might have
against him is that he seemed to really get your goat as indicated by
the violent and sometimes ugly responses he often got. It did seem to
me that even though he was greatly outnumbered he got the best of most
of the arguments.  As I just mentioned, I did see some really vile
replies to him and some that I thought used terribly inappropriate and
perverted ethnic and religious slurs which hardly speaks well for your
side or justifies you calling him perverted, twisted or a freak. I
followed the Internet link he posted and wound up at a really
impressive web site which apparently is his and seems to be inactive
at the moment. I see that he mentioned that he had posted in this
group for 10 years or so and he said that he had goals which had been
met.

Thanks again for pointing me to this guy's posts. I enjoyed the read
and haven't yet gotten through all the things on his web site. I'm
going back for more..

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Cleveland's not crumbling.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's rebuilding.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So said the president today about New Orleans but have you seen
&gt;&gt;&gt; pictures? What sort of natural or man made disaster is the city
&gt;&gt;&gt; rebuilding from, a nuclear blast?

&gt;&gt;That's because the money is falling in the hands of thieves.  Save a
&gt;&gt;couple
&gt;&gt;of streets, New Orleans was a disaster BEFORE Katrina.  They re-elected
&gt;&gt;their idiot mayor, now they can live with it.

&gt;&gt;Gulfport-Biloxi got hit with the same fucking storm.  You can whine and
&gt;&gt;want
&gt;&gt;a free ride the rest of your lives, or you can shut-up and rebuild.

&gt; Jeeze, I only mentioned New Orleans because someone said that
&gt; Cleveland was rebuilding and I answered- You mean like New Orleans is
&gt; rebuilding? to point up that saying a city is rebuilding means very
&gt; little when there is so little to show for it. The topic was Cleveland
&gt; as shown on the Travel Channel. I'm sure you would rather change the
&gt; subject to  New Orleans of Calcutta but that is not the topic. Some of
&gt; you here seem  to have a hair trigger and refuse to address the issue.
&gt; The Travel Channel showed your city in a very bad light and all you
&gt; can talk about is idiot mayors and thieves in another city. But its
&gt; senseless to attack me. I didn't invent any of this. I just know what
&gt; I saw on TV and it wasn't very pretty. Who here who has commented even
&gt; saw the telecast?

You don't live here so I'm curious as to why you'd even give two shits. I
certainly

1. Would not watch a special about Baltimore on some travel channel.
2. If I did, I wouldn't go talking about it in a Ravens football newsgroup.

Welcome back, Bern.

I agree. I always thought it was hilariously pathetic, what he went through
just to &quot;piss&quot; people off and meanwhile we all laughed at him. He paid WAY
