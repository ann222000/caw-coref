I think you're talking about the evaporator drain hose. That won't
effect cooling. Are you sure the compressor is engaging and staying
engaged? If it engages for a few seconds and then disengages over and
over then it's probably low refrigerant. You need a gauge to measure it.

Thx for the input.... I do see the compressor engaging and keeping up.
Also, of the two aluminium tubes that lead to the middle of the back
wall of the chassis, the thinner one is cold to touch when the AC is
running. However, the air coming out of the vents inside is not
cold.... do you think I've some sort of a block somewhere?

Strange.  My 2002 Sentra Air just quit.  The auto places have a great
freon can with a re-usable hose and gauge.  Most likely you are low
and freon and one of these will have your pressure diagosed and
filled again in just a few minutes.

Problem is that mine leaked out again in a week.  When the pressure
is low, the clutch will start the a/c compressor, but if the pressure is
low, it should stop after a while.
