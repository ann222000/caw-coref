Burned microwave popcorn

Last night I walked away from the microwave while popping a bag of
popcorn and didn't hear that kernals had quit popping.  I returned a
minute later--honest, only a minute!!!-only to smell that horrid,
distinctive odor of burned popcorn.  Open the micro and smoke rolled
out.....

I doused the offending bag in water immediately....opened the
windows...sprayed Lysol....put a fan in the window to suck the odor
out....opened a couple of other windows...scoured the micro as best I
could (didn't have any lemon juice or baking soda).

Today the kitchen still reeks....the micro works but IT reeks...and
the odor is lingering everywhere.  I have sprayed Oust (gave up on
Lysol)....I'm wondering if the microwave should be pitched because
it's not possible to clean it out inside and will just continue,
maybe, to be a source of odor?

Thanks for suggestions!

Try a bowl of white vinegar, just set it inside the microwave, close the
door and leave it there, all day and overnight.  It should help a lot.  If
the whole kitchen still stinks, put another bowl of vinegar on the kitchen
counter and leave it there overnight.

Take a saucer, fill it with baking soda, leave it sit in the microwave
for a couple of days. Should absorb all the odor, even that that is
inside the walls. If not, repeat the process. Another method is to
loosely wad up single sheets of newsprint and stuff the microwave full
of it. Will absorb the odor over a couple of days.

It should dissipate eventually.

Try boiling some water in it, that might help.

No, don't toss it.  If you have lemon juice put like half a cup into 2
cups water; run the microwave for like 2.5 minutes.  Once it's done,
wipe down the walls with a paper towel and then leave the door open
(unplugged if yours has that light that turns on when the door is
opened) to "air out" for a few hours (or overnight).

BTW...burnt popcorn smell is one of those major pet peeves at work.
NEVER put a bag in and walk away, even if you use the "popcorn"
button.  When the popping slows down to like 1 pop every 5-10 seconds
take it out.

It doesn't even need to burn without smelling like an explosion at a
chemical factory.

A couple years ago I bought a microwave popper for a couple bucks. It is
basically a plastic bowl with a lid. You just use plain popcorn and
don't get that disgusting heated "space butter" smell.

I worked in a large office area where somebody burned popcorn every
day or two. The odor did finally go away after a couple of hours, and
I think it was the constant ventilation that did the job.

Even without Lysol or other chemicals, lots of fresh air will
eventually clear the stench.

Second that.  I've had employees in theatres burn popcorn many times.
Cook a couple of fresh batches and the odor isn't apparent.  (But
then, you may not make pocorn 32 oz at a time).

OTOH, Act II microwave popcorn is REALLY good.  I don't care if it's space

I would try chlorine bleach (a/k/a Clorox a/k/a sodium hypochlorite
a/k/a NaOCl).  Something tells me it will get rid of whatever is on
the surfaces (at least those that you can get to) in the microwave.

I generally fold a paper towel so it's several layers thick, get it
slightly wet, and then put just a little chlorine bleach directly on
it (by covering the mouth of the bottle, then tipping it momentarily).
Then I have a paper towel I can use to wipe down whatever it is that
needs it.

I don't use those bags - there's far and away too much grease and salt in
them.  You can pop plain old popcorn in the microwave, and control the
amount of oil and salt.  Cheaper, too.

However, this is an occasional problem at work - someone overpops a bag, and
it does reek.  But other than maybe airing the oven out, no one does
anything special, and the smell fades away.

My mom had a brain cramp once and cleaned the microwave with a

Certainly this is a good rule if you're not very familiar with a given
microwave/popcorn combination. We're not terribly far from the office
microwave and there's always that burned smell from time to time. Really I
think its just people trying to get those last few kernels (which is
always a bad idea).

I've use the 'popcorn' button on my microwave for dozens of bags over the
