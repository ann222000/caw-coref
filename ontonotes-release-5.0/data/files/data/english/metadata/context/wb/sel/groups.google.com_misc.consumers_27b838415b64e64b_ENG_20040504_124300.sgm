he'd fit in here quite nicely.

||||
|||| Y'know, ... whenever i read anything Buffett says, it just plain
|||| makes sense. I happened to be reading quite a few stories about
|||| him last weekend, before the above cited announcement.
||||
|||| He's not merely a supergenius, he's a supergenuis with a surfeit of
|||| common sense. Even though he's the second wealthiest man in the
|||| world, he'd fit in here quite nicely.
|||
||| But isn't it really easy for the 2nd richest man in the world to say
||| &quot;you know what, I don't need this tax cut.&quot; Yet, his saying that
||| will (could) effect families making a fraction of a percentage of
||| his income. How convenient to be in his position and not theirs.
||
|| Buffet comments on the economy and how it effects everyone, not his
|| financial situation, nor that of any other individual. Buffet has a
|| long track record of being incredibly correct where the economy is
|| concerned.

His buying all that silver is turning out to be idiotic.

&gt;&gt; He did not buy into the unfulfilled Bush claim that the tax cuts would

&gt; Jobs created is net jobs created. So if there's 100,000 new

&gt;Buffet comments on the economy and how it effects everyone, not his
&gt;financial situation, nor that of any other individual. Buffet has a
&gt;long track record of being incredibly correct where the economy is
&gt;concerned.

"/> It is impossible for anyone, including Buffet, to make a comment on
the economy that universally effects everyone. Doesn't happen.
Certain policies benefit certain economic segments and income
segments. Buffet simply rejects an economic policy that benefits the
income class that he belongs to, in favor of one that would benefit
those at low income levels.

Slant it any way you want to, it is still a philosophy that he has.
And at its core, any philosophy is based in an individual belief
system (i.e., opinion).

&gt; Yeah, right. When Berkshire takes a major position in a company THAT is a

"/> No it isn't. What would-be investors infer from Buffet's investment
decisions is up to them, but Buffet never recommends invididual
companies as investments. He does explain many of his investment
decisions, but not once have I ever heard Buffet (or read) him say
anything like &quot;I suggest you go out and buy XYZ.&quot;

The only investment Buffet comes closest to recommending is his own
company; Berkshire Hathaway, which is essentially a holding firm for
many companies; sort of like a mutual fund.

&gt;&gt; Certain policies benefit certain economic segments and income
&gt;&gt; segments. Buffet simply rejects an economic policy that benefits the
&gt;&gt; income class that he belongs to, in favor of one that would benefit
&gt;&gt; those at low income levels.

&gt;&gt; Slant it any way you want to, it is still a philosophy that he has.
&gt;&gt; And at its core, any philosophy is based in an individual belief
&gt;&gt; system (i.e., opinion).

&gt;Of course, but in Buffet's case, he bases his economic recommendations
&gt;on volumes of research, not arbitrary beliefs and considering his
&gt;business accumen, it is clear that Buffet's prognostications about
&gt;the economy hold a lot more validity than Bush's.

The greatest threat to America's primacy in the world comes not from its
overseas commitments, explains the historian Niall Ferguson in his smart
forthcoming book &quot;Colossus&quot;: &quot;It is the result of America's chronically
unbalanced domestic finances.&quot; The mounting federal budget deficits that
now stretch out as far as the eye can see will mean, if history is any
guide, sharp cutbacks in American military and foreign-affairs spending. We
will see a forced retreat of America's foreign policy similar to the years
after the Vietnam War, only the cuts this time are likely to be much, much
deeper and the resulting chaos far greater.

The commitments that make up America's world role are tolerated as long as
the economy is growing and the budget is large enough to accommodate
everything. But if there were a choice between guns and butter, there's
little doubt what Americans would choose.

With intelligent fiscal management, such a choice would not present
itself. But intelligent fiscal management is not what we have in
Washington these days. Much has been written recently about the
out-of-control federal budget. The tax base has been eroded at the very
moment that a massive new entitlement program, prescription drugs for
the elderly, has been added. Increased funding for security measures is
inevitable and yet there is no effort to tighten nonsecurity spending.
Congress is always irresponsible, but President Bush has not vetoed a
single bill since he took office, the first president to show such
laxity. He now beats all presidents but Lyndon Johnson at domestic
spending. Journalist Mickey Kaus recently spoke with a senior federal
official who said, &quot;I've never seen an administration spend money like
this... The money's flying out the door. I can barely keep up with it...
They give money away on phone calls. No documents. No budget. It's the
worst I've ever seen...&quot;

advisors based on staff advise. But let's recognize that his is very
different from your original point that started this discussion to the
effect that Bush (himself) suffers in terms of economics knowledge
when compared to a Buffet. To repeat, the economic advisors selected
by the Bush Administration do the forecasting and their credentials
are -not- inferior to Buffet's in that respect. the Chairman of
Council of Economic Advisors may be right and he may be wrong, but he
is a well-respected academic who was selected based on superior
credentials. And, BTW, Snow is in office because he isn't an
