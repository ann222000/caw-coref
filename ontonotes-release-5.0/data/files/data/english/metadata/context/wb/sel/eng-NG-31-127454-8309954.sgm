Son of Lupin and Tonks, outcast at Hogwarts, finds the Inferi stone in
the forest that Harry dropped.

Harry says &quot;If I die a normal death, the wand's story will end&quot;.  Now,
in the epilog, who on the train station dropping off their kids do you
think might have his eyes on that wand?

Teddy is not an outcast. I think that JKR said that he had grown up
normal, not a werewolf but a Metamorphmagus like his mother, and he had
the normal life Harry could have had.

I don't think he's an outcast, there's no telling whether or not he is
a werewolf or not, but i doubt so, else there would've been references
to it like &quot;don't forget to drink your potion&quot; or &quot;Neville will help
you out&quot;, etc.

As for the wand.. someone's bound to suspect that the wand is more
than ordinary, and bound to come after it. Who knows, perhaps Malfoy
or his son will someday be unable to resist the temptations... - or
who knows which other wizard may one day fall from grace like that? ;)

Why is someone bound to suspect that the wand is more than ordinary?
They would more than likely suspect that any weirdness came from Harry
rather then the wand.  Add to the fact that the people who held the
wand in living memory, DD and Voldy, were considered very powerful
wizards with very ordinary wands.  Do you think Ron and Hermione are
going to tell?  Harry certainly won't since it'd put him and his
family's life at risk.

No. Grindelwald believed it would allow him to create an army of
inferi - probably without having to go through all the tedious
business of killing people and hexing the body first, like what LV had
to do to get all the inferi in the lake around the birdbath with the
locket in. From what we have seen (and been told) of the Resurrection
Stone's operation, it allows souls of the dead to walk amongst the
living for a while.

(p560 Bloomsbury):
&quot;They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They
resembled most closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary, so
long ago, and he had been memory made nearly solid. Less substantial
than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they moved towards him,
and on each face there was the same loving smile.&quot;

And a little bit later:
&quot;'They won't be able to see you?' asked Harry.
'We are part of you,' said Sirius. 'Invisible to anyone else.'&quot;

An army of invisible, virtually insubstantial souls is not going to be
any use to a Dark Lord, and they are certainly not inferi.

But the Elder Wand is a fairy tale, isn't it?  And Voldy certainly
wouldn't mention it to anyone.  And if the wand Voldy was carrying was
the Elder wand, how is it that Harry was able to defeat it,
considering that the Elder wand is supposed to make the wizard
unbeatable and Voldy was supposed to be the most powerful wizard alive
anyway (with DD dead now)?  Did everyone stop fighting and listen in
when Harry and Voldy started fighting so they heard every word and
understood it?  I think it's safe to say that any 'tales' of the Elder
wand are going to be easily dismissed, especially since Harry put
Dumbledore's wand back in his tomb rather than keeping the 'most
powerful wand every created'.  I would would rather think that people
would think that the wand was dud since the most powerful wizard alive
was defeated by a boy.

Inferi are revived bodies.  They're zombies, basically.  The bodies
brought back by the Resurrection Stone are &quot;neither ghost nor truly
flesh&quot; (pg. 698, US version).
Plus, it seems that Inferi are mindless, soulless bodies.  Lily and
the Marauders (playing at the Three Broomsticks this Friday!  It's a
two sickle cover!) had all their faculties and retain their

No shit.  But how can they get it if they don't know where it is?  I
doubt Harry's gonna advertise where he puts it.  Even if someone
defeats Harry, they still have to find it to actually use it.

Care to quote where Harry mentions, during the duel, where he's going
to put it?  He says it to DD later in the Headmaster's office, yes,
but I don't recall him saying it during the duel.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As for the wand.. someone's bound to suspect that the wand is more

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;who knows which other wizard may one day fall from grace like that? ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt;Why is someone bound to suspect that the wand is more than ordinary?
&gt;&gt;&gt;They would more than likely suspect that any weirdness came from Harry
&gt;&gt;&gt;rather then the wand.  Add to the fact that the people who held the
&gt;&gt;&gt;wand in living memory, DD and Voldy, were considered very powerful
&gt;&gt;&gt;wizards with very ordinary wands.  Do you think Ron and Hermione are
&gt;&gt;&gt;going to tell?  Harry certainly won't since it'd put him and his
&gt;&gt;&gt;family's life at risk.

&gt;&gt;Ummm....because he told the whole school and all the Death Eaters about
&gt;&gt;it during the final duel?

&gt; Did everyone stop fighting and listen in
&gt; when Harry and Voldy started fighting so they heard every word and
&gt; understood it?

I think a lot of them probably did.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think it's safe to say that any 'tales' of the Elder
&gt; wand are going to be easily dismissed, especially since Harry put
&gt; Dumbledore's wand back in his tomb rather than keeping the 'most
&gt; powerful wand every created'.  I would would rather think that people
&gt; would think that the wand was dud since the most powerful wizard alive
&gt; was defeated by a boy.

Harry was the master of the wand.  This was explained.

I think VM said where he took it from.  But I'm not sure, and don't
really feel like looking it up.  I'll leave that to the fanatics.  It's

He did.  But Harry never said to anyone outside the Headmaster
Portraits where he's hiding it.  Nobody else knows.  For all they
know, he buys a bunch of owls, who spend Harry's life flying and
tossing it amongst themselves.
