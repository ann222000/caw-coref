Some humans never admit when they are wrong, and rely on non sequitors
and changing the topic to avoid fessing up.

Socrates taught his students that the pursuit of truth can only begin once
they start to question and analyze every belief that they ever held dear. If
a certain belief passes the tests of evidence, deduction, and logic, it
should be kept. If it doesn't, the belief should not only be discarded, but
the thinker must also then question why he was led to believe the erroneous

Because the writers decided the episode wasn't quite derivative

No.

Firstly the Doctor was the last to be 'infected'.  The Doctor isn't
human and was able to fight off the control somewhat, he was able
to block some of the effects (but it was quite clear he would be
close to dying/regenerating if it had gone on much longer).  The
final result is that the Doctor managed to survive (just) the
infection from the star being.  A human would never be able to
do so.

That statement might carry a bit more weight, Herr Doctor,
if you showed more than a marginal command of the English
language.

That said, there are numerous variants of acceptable English
spelling.

The two most broadly accepted variants are the Queen's
English (ir English English) and American English.

Here in Canada, either is acceptable as long as you are
consistent.  That is, you can't mix Queen's English and
American English in the same document.

Of course, there are a few things to muddy the waters.  The
CP Stylebook allows certain American-isms in addition to the
standard Queen's English.  For example, you can &quot;prioritize&quot;
(American English) you &quot;colour&quot; (Queen's English) choices
quite legitimately here in Canada--even though both English
and American school teachers would nail you to the
blackboard.  The general mish-mash of American and Queen's
English is generally refered to as Canadian English.

Other English speaking nations, Australia for example, are
also developing their own spelling and usage variants.

And if that isn't bad enough, expressions like &quot;Hwaet we
gardena&quot; and &quot;Alle beyon he blithe that to me songe lithe&quot;
are also legitimate English in the correct context.

In defence of Canadian spelling, (1) most English
instruction is done using American text books, and (2)
modern standard Canadian English (such as that found in the
CP Stylebook) is a kind of mongel mixing both American

Someone obviously didn't learn him English really well, did
they?

And before anybody jumps on me for bad English here, in this
context &quot;learn&quot; is a dialectic throwback to an earlier form
of English.  It comes into modern English from the old
English verb &quot;Laeran&quot; (meaning &quot;to teach&quot;) rather than the
old English &quot;Learnian&quot; (meaning &quot;to learn&quot;).  The old
English verb &quot;Laeran&quot; is cognate with the modern German verb
&quot;Lehren&quot; (meaning &quot;to teach&quot;).
