AMD released their new graphics cards on a /Sunday?/

What are you looking for here? Shill of the month award?

You're too late anyhoo, at 7th January 2007.

Go tell your momma you've messed up her internet account, then go to
your room and think about what you've done.

And never play with a computer without an adult present.

looks like Ng2000 is a California USA site, so that is July 1, 2007.

but then again, ng2000.com looks like a billion other sites summarizing news from
others in order to generate advertisement revenue.  bah.  They summarized a summary
from linuxtoday.com.

FUD? The hell you say... don't you know the only reasonable way to
determine which OS you should use is based on a video card that's been on
the market for less than a week? (Clearly this is sarcasm)
