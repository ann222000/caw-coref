A former Zionazi comes face to face with the filth that comprises the
&quot;Jewish state&quot;.

These scum are pushing the US and Canada into wars as well.

Zionazis and their puppets will eventually be hunted down and
eliminated.

Zionofascism will cease to exist.

Just a matter of time.

The Education Of A Zionist
By Luise Light

9-29-7

I grew up in a home with strong Zionist traditions. My uncle was an
official of the Zionist Organization of America and made many trips to
Israel. When in New York, my aunt and uncle were frequent visitors to
our home, especially around holiday time where dinner celebrations
always ended with the singing of Hatikvah, the Israeli national anthem.
On those occasions, they would dazzle us with their stories of
experiences in the Holy Land.

My mother was a lifelong member of Hadassah, the organization that
raises funds for Israeli hospitals and medical research, and I was
expected to carry on that tradition when my mother passed from the
scene. My family had returned to New York after my father's early
retirement to California because of a thyroid condition, in order for
my brother and me to have a Hebrew education. We both were enrolled in
parochial schools where we spent half the day in Jewish studies, and
the other half in the required English ones.

During summers, I was packed off to camp where we spoke, ate and even
played baseball in Hebrew. We fought color wars that had us setting up
watch towers for new settlements in the dead of night without being
detected, and we went on night treks up hillsides to plant our flag at
the summit. We role-played  pioneers establishing the homeland, and we
were expected to be brave, tough, and fluent in Hebrew. Our Israeli
counselors would ridicule us when we didn't measure up to their
expectations.

We were taught the songs and dances of the first Israeli settlers from
Eastern Europe and learned them well enough to demonstrate them for
Israeli youth, who had never heard or seen them, preferring the latest
international pop hits. I fully expected to make &quot;aliyah&quot; to Israel
when I finished college, just as my cousin Zippy had done. While this
was not the goal my parents held for me, everything I knew about Israel
drew me in, almost irresistibly. As I collected money for the Jewish
National Fund, a weekly school assignment, passing around the pale blue
tin boxes that were ubiquitous in Jewish neighborhoods, I imagined
myself planting trees bought with money I collected around new
settlements in the Negev, the southern wilderness.

My older brother was a terrorist. At fifteen, he joined the ranks of
the smallest and most radical of the three underground groups committed
to chasing the British out of Palestine and creating the Jewish State.
Known as the Stern Gang, or more formally, Fighters for the Freedom of
Israel (FFI), they were specialists in assassinations and surprise
attacks on Arab and British foes. They competed for money and attention
with the Irgun, the oldest of the three resistance groups, and Haganah,
the largest and the least radical of the three.

It was rumored that the Stern Gang was responsible for the
assassination of General Allenby on the streets of London. He had been
in charge of British forces in Palestine, and was hated for torturing
captured Jewish prisoners. The group also was implicated in car
bombings, terrorist attacks on British barracks and revenge killings of
Arab leaders. My brother's job was to raise funds from the Jewish
communities of the Eastern seaboard and collect armaments that were
later trans-shipped to Israel.

We knew about this because my father found boxes of guns and explosives
in the basement of a small apartment building he owned in Brooklyn.
Confronting my brother, he ordered him to remove these illegal and
dangerous contents from the building within 48 hours or he would call
in the police. Two days later, two toughs appeared at the door of our
apartment, asking for my father. They threatened his life if he didn't
forget he knew about the guns and explosives, allowing them to be
removed when &quot;the boys&quot; were ready. My father was terrified and
followed orders.

My brother sometimes confided in me about his work. I idolized him as a
hero of the Jewish people, although the real impact of his bloody work
was obscured by the haze of my romantic notions about Israel. One day,
my brother called me into his room and told me he needed my help. He
said he was running a fever and might be too sick to bike a package of
nitroglycerin over the George Washington Bridge the next morning. If he
couldn't do it, he told me, I might have to take his place. I told him
I was prepared, reminding him that I was trained as a scout at Camp
Cejwin. My eyes filled with tears of pride. In the end though, my
brother decided that he couldn't let his kid sister take that risk and
although sick, he managed to carry out the task himself.

At seventeen, just shy of his high school graduation, my brother left
school and worked his way to Brazil on a freighter, washing pots big
enough for him to stand in. He jumped ship in Rio and was taken in by
members of the Jewish community there. The next thing we knew the
military government of Brazil had thrown him in jail and was
considering either throwing away the key or kicking him out of the
country. My parents, through the efforts of New York's Congressional
delegation and a satchel of money, arranged for him to be flown to
Miami by a Brazilian general. There, he was met by my parents and
various U.S. officials who were prepared to arrest him. Fortunately,
that didn't happen for reasons never clear to me.

I didn't see much of my brother after that. He was drafted and sent to
fight in the Korean War where he was made an explosives expert and
spent much of his time dismantling bombs that failed to explode. When
he finished his army stint, he enrolled in college under the GI Bill,
and then in graduate school where he earned a doctorate in clinical
psychology.

I was planning my college career while my brother was getting ready for
graduate school. I wanted to go to a small liberal arts college strong
in literature and writing, my areas of interest, but my parents offered
me a different deal. If I would agree to go to the City University of
New York, which offered a free college education, I could have a year
abroad, all expenses paid, in the country of my choosing. In the end, I
accepted the deal and chose to go to Israel. I couldn't pass up the
chance to visit the Jewish homeland.

It was the refuge where Jews could feel safe, protected by our own
Jewish army. For hundreds of years, Jews had been thrown out of
countries or proscribed in what careers they could pursue. In Europe,
they had been targets of pograms, disenfranchisement, and bigotry for
hundreds of years. The Holocaust showed us that we were not safe
anywhere, even in the countries where once we had prospered and were
socially successful.

My maternal grandfather had been a prominent toymaker with a large
factory near Berlin. He had been given the title of Baron by the Kaiser
for  services to the State. But when he fled the Nazis and came through
Ellis Island, grandfather Louis left everything behind, his title, his
business, his home and lands, and became a simple, poor tailor in
Richmond, Virginia.

It was the Holocaust that woke up American Jews to the cold reality of
a world prejudiced against them. We felt morally committed to Israel as
a safe haven where Jews could live in peace, no matter how our social
and political conditions changed or turned against us.

Given a time-honored commitment to civil rights and human dignity, it
now seems odd to me that in the many discourses and orientations I
received about Zionism, it was never mentioned that the homeland had
been seized from its Arab owners who were driven off their lands to
make way for the State of Israel.

Arabs became known as the enemy of the people of Israel. They stood in
the way of Israel's return to their birthright and historic home. Those
who did not flee their homes and remained in Israel were told that they
could live in peace with their Israeli neighbors, with the rights and
privileges accorded to Israeli Jews, including the right to run for
Parliament, attend the University, and receive social, medical and
economic benefits.

At college, I started to read more about the terrible conditions of
Palestinian refugees who fled Israel and were herded into temporary
camps in neighboring Arab lands. But when I asked my aunt and uncle,
the ZOA &quot;dignitaries&quot; about that, I was cautioned that even asking such
questions could tag me as anti-Semitic, someone who hates the Jews. It
was implied that questioning the actions of the Jewish State could be
dangerous. I was warned to be careful.

Though disturbing, this advice about being careful was lost on me in
the whirlwind of activities getting ready for my trip to Israel. I was
going to attend the Hebrew University during my junior year at college
and study Biblical archeology with my childhood hero, General Yigal
Yadin, the father of Israeli archeology, famous for his work throughout
the world.
Studies in the Promised Land

The 10-day ocean voyage on an Israeli steamship would be the bright
line between my old, soft life in America and a new life as a potential
Israeli immigrant and settler. My cousin Zippy, a heroine who had lived
through the siege of Jerusalem during the Israeli War of Independence
and wrote an award-winning book about it, was going to pick me up at
the port in Haifa and drive me to her home near Tel Aviv, where I would
stay until the start of classes at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

The ship was small by ocean liner standards and most of the passengers
were older couples and business people. At 18, I was the youngest
passenger on board, and an object of intense curiosity or so it seemed.
Walking around the deck for exercise, I usually picked up
companions-older men who followed me, questioned me, tried to make
small talk, with unsmiling, business-like demeanors. I found them
unnerving. The men were humorless and unattractive, but they stuck to
me like flypaper, making my daily walks on the ship deck unpleasant.

One afternoon, as I attempted to elude an uninvited follower, a door
opened and a hand beckoned me in. I hesitated, not wanting to jump from
the frying pan into the fire. But a distinguished looking older
gentleman in a white uniform, with a warm smile and a European accent
said, &quot;Don't worry, I don't mean you any harm.&quot; I searched his face and
found no malice in it so I entered the room. He was the ship's chief
engineer, a courtly gentleman from Italy. He told me that he saw how
uncomfortable I was and thought he could offer me a port in the storm.
We sat on opposite couches and talked about our lives and interests. He
offered me a yogurt, and ate one with me. My visits with Aldo became an
enjoyable habit. At about the same time each day, I stopped by for an
hour of yogurt and small talk with Aldo. It was all quite innocent, but
it may not have seemed so to the crew and passengers who, from that
point on, stared at me and whispered when I walked by.

One morning, when I returned to my stateroom after breakfast, I heard a
knock on the door. I asked who it was, and a man's voice answered, the
ship's purser. I opened the door to find a tall, muscular man in an
officer's white uniform. He pushed me into the room and down on the
bed, shut the door, and proceeded to lower his pants and get on top of
me. This fool was going to rape me! It struck me as completely
incongruous and hilariously funny that it should be an Israeli officer
who should be attacking me! I started laughing hysterically. He told me
to shut up which made me laugh even harder. That did it. Suddenly, he
sprang up, unable to continue. My laughter had disabled him. He let
himself out, slamming the door behind him, which I bolted. He never
tried it again, thankfully, but I kept as low a profile as possible for
the remainder of the trip.

I recognized my cousin portside. She was tall by Israeli standards. We
hugged, she put my belongings in her car, and we drove off. As I stared
out at the hills of the Carmel range through the car window, tears
poured down my cheeks. I didn't know why I was crying but the tears
never stopped the entire time we were driving, and I never figured out
why.

Savyon, the suburb in which my cousin lived with her family, was a
community of terracotta homes in a park-like setting. The air was
redolent with citrus and honeysuckle, and kids were playing soccer in a
neighbor's yard. It was a bucolic scene that might have been in central
Florida or Flagstaff, Arizona.

At the time, one of the most affluent communities in Israel, Savyon was
established in 1954. My cousin's husband, a retired army colonel, civil
engineer, and a member of the diplomatic corps, had helped to plan the
community. I had expected something more rough and ready, more like the
pictures of kibbutzim I had seen in magazines. But it was a pleasant
place to learn about Israeli morés, brush up on my Hebrew, and prepare
for my studies at the university.

The Hebrew University, built into the hills of Jerusalem, was part of
the dream of early Zionists, and it was established with the State of
Israel. During the war of independence, the original campus on Mount
Scopus was cut off from Jewish Jerusalem, and subsequently, a new
campus was built in southwestern Jerusalem at Ein Kerem. This was the
campus I would attend. From there, you could see Arab villages and
olive orchards that had been deserted by their owners after the war,
and now were occupied by Israeli artists and craftspeople. The two
campuses of the university were reunited in 1967, after the Six-Day
War, with the original Mount Scopus campus once again made the main
one.

My first day in Yadin's class in archeology was unforgettable.
Classrooms were designed in the European style, with a separate
entrance for teachers at the head of the classroom and another for
students at the back. All of us students were seated waiting for the
entrance of the great Yadin. The door at the front of the room shook
slightly, then stopped moving. A moment later, a tall, bald man in
tweeds raised a window and climbed into the room. Without pausing a
beat, he walked to the podium, opened a file of notes and began his
lecture. The first thing he told us, in a deeply resonant voice, was
that if we took his class because we admired old, beautiful objects, we
should leave now. There is no room in archeology, he said, for antique
hunters. The work is hard, tedious and unexceptional. Most of the
objects we would deal with would be unremarkable, and we would consider
ourselves lucky to find anything at all much less anything of value. It
felt as if he was talking directly to me.

I also had enrolled in a seminar on Egyptian hieroglyphics, but the
world-famous scholar listed as the teacher was spending a year on
sabbatical in England and his research assistant, a large, tall woman
who looked like a sturdy kibbutznik, would be teaching the seminar. I
was the only one who had enrolled, and the contempt with which the
woman treated me made me feel this was not going to work out well. I
bailed, and signed up for a class in poetry, instead.

I was friendly with Israeli and Palestinian students as well as others
from Nigeria, South Africa, Britain, Belgium, Holland, France, Brazil,
Chile, and elsewhere, all with their own unique story of why they had
come to study in Israel, some for adventure, others because it held a
special significance in their lives. We formed an informal gourmet
society, sharing the pennies we had to spend on food and our culinary
skills.

A sizeable number of Palestinians were enrolled in the university, and
everyone got along well each other. Later, it would be claimed that it
was at tables in the cafeteria of the university that plans for the
first Palestinian Intifada was plotted. The only plots I was aware of
at the time were the secret ingredients in the fragrant feasts prepared
for our monthly, low-budget dinner parties. It was from these culinary
adventures that I learned to cook and love vegetables.

A fellow student from the New York area, a writer like myself
interested in archeology, and I decided to travel south during our
two-week, mid-winter school break. We planned to take a bus from Tel
Aviv to Beersheba, and then hitch a ride to Eilat, the southernmost tip
of Israel on the Red Sea.

I wanted to visit Petra, the red city built by the Nabateans, an Arabic
people who withstood the invasions of Rome, the Crusaders, and the
Byzantines. Built in 600 BC as an impregnable fortress with colonnaded
tombs and temples carved into towering sandstone cliffs, Petra was the
Donnybrook of all invaders who sought to conquer Palestine. Ultimately,
invading armies would abandon the site as too remote and difficult a
place to conquer and hold. Petra is two hours north of the Gulf
ofAquaba, on the Jordanian side. Although Israelis often snuck across
the border to explore the place they called, The Red Rock, and lived to
tell about it, it was dangerous to go there without Jordanian
permission.

At the boisterous bus station in Tel Aviv, we found the one to
Beersheba and got on, sitting among workers with lunch pails, Arab
women holding chickens or babies, and old men with milky eyes who
crunched sunflower seeds incessantly and threw the empty shells on the
floor. The shells scrunched underfoot as people got on the bus and made
their way to an open seat. The old vehicle huffed and puffed and
shuddered as it snaked through the southern wilderness to the bus depot
inBeersheba, four hours away.

It was dusk when we disembarked in a desolate area without a sign or
kiosk to guide us to the local youth hostel, our destination that
evening. A friendly truck driver off-loading produce to a smaller
vehicle suggested that we look for someone at the central market, a
kilometer or so from where we were. He asked us how long we were going
to be in Beersheba and we replied, just overnight, then on to Eilat. He
told us his next stop was Eilat and he could give us a lift. He
suggested that we look for him in the bus depot around noon the next
day. We agreed to meet him.

Walking toward the central market in the direction the truck driver
indicated brought us to a Bedouin encampment, where my companion, Leah
and I lost sight of each other. I kept walking and looking for her,
losing sight of where I was heading which was right in the middle of a
field of camels, some sitting on the ground and others in various
stages of rising awkwardly like a creaky boat on a sea of sand, their
spindly, long, shaggy, dirt-caked legs awkwardly bending space to their
will. They towered over me and I panicked but kept walking through the
crowd of shaggy, smelly beasts. I found a Bedouin women, sitting in the
opening of a tent, dressed all in black with chains of gold coins
stretched across her face, ear to ear, from her chin up to her eyes.
She was feeding a baby at her breast. I signaled to her that I was
looking for water. She called into the tent and a child brought out a
leather pouch and showed me how to drink from it. Reluctantly, I did,
realizing that I felt a whole lot better after I drank the water. I
thanked her and started walking, this time, away from the camels.

Leah, my travel-mate, was wandering around the market buying fruit and
cheese for our journey. She had a vague idea of how to find the Youth
Hostel that was in a residential part of town on the other side of the
market. We started walking away from the market toward our destination.

As the sun set, I had the creepy feeling that we were being followed. I
looked back and saw a car a few lengths behind us, and a small knot of
men, alongside the car. When they saw us looking back at them, one of
them whistled at us, and more men seemed to be joining them. Now, there
was a crowd of men and several cars inching along behind us. I pinched
my companion's arm and said, 'Notice anything? We're the only women on
the street. I don't like the feel of this. I think we're in trouble.&quot;
We spotted an open café, the only public place in sight, and walked in,
selecting a table in the middle of the room with a clear view through
the large pane glass window in front of the shop so we could observe
the crowd outside. Several men came in and sat at tables around the
periphery of the room, making a giant circle around us. When we were
entirely surrounded, the men started table-hopping and whispering to
each other, and we were trapped like roaches in an ant hotel.

Leah suddenly grabbed my arm, and said, sotto vocé, &quot;Don't look now,
but there's a character in a beret and trench coat parading up and down
in front of the café.&quot; She looked terrified. Suddenly, the man in the
trench coat and black beret entered and made a beeline for our table.
Very precisely, in clipped Hebrew, he whispered in my ear loud enough
for Leah to hear, &quot;The car is waiting. In exactly one minute you will
get up and march with me out the door and get into the car.&quot; My jaw
dropped and I looked at him as if he were crazy. Leah was irate. She
started to say, &quot;I will not follow you out to a car&quot; then stopped.
&quot;Listen,&quot; I said to her, I think he's trying to help us. I don't know
what's going on but those other guys don't look nice or friendly. He
looks kind.&quot; He shook his head confirming what I was saying. I started
getting up. &quot;I'm going to take a chance on him and I suggest you do,
too.&quot;

We both followed him out of the café. On the street, he grabbed each of
us firmly by an arm and started walking briskly away from the cars and
mob behind us. &quot;Where are you going,&quot; he asked? We told him we were
headed for the Youth Hostel but we had no idea where it was. I asked
him, &quot;Who are those men, and why are they following us?&quot;

He explained, &quot;They're workers from the copper mines in Dimona. When
they come to town, after not seeing a woman for weeks, they are
desperate for companionship. And you are the only ones available, it
seems.&quot;

Leah blew, &quot;What do you mean available? We're not available to them,
what are they going to do, kidnap us?&quot;

&quot;Precisely,&quot; he replied. &quot;They want to kidnap you and use you for sex.
I saw you were in trouble so I decided to help you. I'm with the
Israeli secret service. I happened to pass by and saw what was
happening.&quot;

As we walked arm and arm, some of the men from Dimona called out to
him, and one came up to him with his wallet out, trying to buy us from
him. Fortunately, he didn't agree to trade us to the highest bidder
just yet. Now, we were really scared. Why weren't we warned how
dangerous this trip was going to be? It never occurred to us that we
had to protect ourselves, not just from Arab terrorists but from
Israeli ones, too.

When we reached the Youth Hostel, there were no lights on, and men were
hiding behind trees who called out to us as we passed. Manny, our
protector, marched into the office and found the manager asleep in the
next room. He quickly told him what was going on and urged that he
protect us if the men came asking for us. The manager pooh-poohed the
whole situation, saying we were just wimpy American girls blowing
things out of proportion to the facts! He no sooner finished his rant
then four men with guns walked into the office, demanding that we be
turned over to them.

Now, the manager bolted into action, grabbing an automatic weapon from
behind a cabinet and screamed at them to back off and clear out! He
wasn't going to let these excuses for men tell him what to do. He told
them he wouldn't hesitate to blow their heads off and they knew and we
knew he meant it. He escorted us to our rooms and suggested we take
turns sleeping to make sure we weren't bothered by anyone, and he would
stand guard, too.

There was at least one more attempt to kidnap us that night, but our
two heroes kept the kidnappers at bay with their guns drawn. Why were
men from copper mines so crazed that all they could think of was
acquiring sex slaves? It took me forty years to learn the answer.

The copper mines in Dimona were in reality Israel's secret nuclear
facility, which in 1960 was just being built with the help of the
French government. The workers at the facility might have suffered some
low-level radiation exposure, which has been associated with
uncontrollable sexual urges. But this gang-like attempt to snatch us
off the streets and use us for sex was outside the pale of civilized
behavior! Obviously, we weren't the first ones to be accosted this way!

In the morning, we headed back to the bus depot, having deciding it
wasn't safe for us to spend any more time in Beersheba. The mob knew
where we were and probably wouldn't stop trying to snatch us. They
would get better at it with each failed attempt and ultimately, with so
many joined in the project, they would succeed.

We spotted our friend, Yossi, the truck driver loading his truck.
Before we approached him, we stopped to argue whether traveling with
him was a good idea or would it mean buying into more trouble.
Considering that he wasn't from Dimona orBeersheba, that he had a
schedule to keep, and there would be two of us riding with him, we
decided he would be a safer choice than the Beersheba gang we met the
night before. We hailed Yossi and he waved us over.

I straddled the gearbox next to Yossi and Leah sat next to me. The
bumpy ride was blessedly uneventful until, halfway to Eilat, Yossi
fished out a rifle from behind the bench seat and proceeded to shoot
out his window with one hand, while driving with the other. I asked him
what he was doing, and he answered, laughing, that he was practicing
his marksmanship because it always pays to be prepared. Did he think we
would run in to any trouble, Leah asked him? &quot;I never think about
trouble,&quot; he replied. &quot;It's no trouble if you're ready.&quot; I couldn't
decide if Yossi was a good guy or one of the tribe of bad guys who had
terrified us the night before.

By the time we reached Eilat it was pitch-dark, a moonless night
without street lights. We asked Yossi how we could find the Youth
Hostel, and he suggested walking to the bus terminal for information
and pointed us in that direction. We walked gingerly in the dark
through sand we couldn't see underfoot. I wondered if there were
scorpions around but quickly released the thought. There wasn't
anything we could do but find a safe place to stay for the night. Ten
minutes later, we were in front of the bus station but it was closed
and no one was around. Outside, behind the station we found a kiosk
with magazines and newspapers, lit by one flickering incandescent bulb
that hung down over the proprietor's head.

Yevgeny, the proprietor, was a short, fat, bald man with a black patch
over one eye. His good eye was large, round, and bloodshot, and he
appeared sweaty and disheveled. He could have marched right out of the
pages of Dostoevsky novel. We asked him if he had a map that would get
us to the youth hostel. He told us that no one would be there this
late, but he knew a place where we could find a room for the night. It
was Shula the Seamstress' place. She rented out a room, sometimes, he
told us, and pulled out a phone from a lower shelf and started to dial.
He talked into the phone in Russian for a moment, then hung up. &quot;She
said a room is available. She doesn't charge much. The room is simple
and clean, and it has two beds.&quot; He scribbled an address and a name on
a piece of paper and handed it to us. &quot;How do we find her place, I
asked?&quot; Yevgeny drew a map.

&quot;It's simple. Walk in this direction for about 20 minutes, and look for
building 73. They all look alike so you have to look for the building
number on the door. Then go up to the third floor to apartment #6. Do
you have a flashlight?&quot; We did.

Building 73 was one of dozens of concrete, slab buildings, each six
stories high and jutting out of the sand in anonymous rows, silhouetted
against the dark sky like sentries. In order to find #73 we had to walk
past two long rows of the buildings and shine our flashlights on every
front door. Finally, we found the right building and walked up to the
third floor toapartment #6. Across the threshold was a large mangy dog,
who muttered a low throaty growl when he saw us. Tentatively, we
reached over the beast, who we promptly named Cerberus, and rang the
doorbell.

The woman who opened the door wore a colorful kimono robe, her frizzy
red hair in riotous disarray. &quot;Are you from Yossi,&quot; she asked? We
nodded. She chased the big dog off the doormat and beckoned us in.
&quot;Come. I'll show you the room.&quot; The main room was spacious but spartan,
stacked with piles of shells of dresses on the floor near a large
sewing machine. She showed us to a small bedroom with a hanging red
bead curtain serving as a door. Inside the room were two neat cots, a
sink and two chairs. The room looked clean and more inviting than
Shula's space which was neither tidy nor particularly clean, from what
we could see. Shula quoted a price of 5 dollars a night for the room,
and asked us how many nights we planned to stay. I replied two nights.
She asked for payment up front, showed us the bathroom, and asked what
time we wanted to wake up. Leah said we would probably sleep in. Shula
warned us that we would hear her sewing machine in the morning and it
might wake us. Don't worry, I told her, we can sleep through anything,
we're so tired.

It was true. The minute we hit our pillows, we were out for the night.
At about seven in the morning, I woke up when Shula's phone rang, and
bolted upright in bed. Shula was talking to someone on the phone. I
heard her say in Hebrew, &quot;Yes, the Americans came. They're here now,
and staying for two nights. Come tomorrow. You can surprise them when
they're sleeping. How much for them? Good. Yes, I agree.&quot; I prodded
Leah and mimed for her to listen but make no sound. She heard the woman
say that they could take us the next night, and looked as horrified as
I felt. We quickly rose, took our things, and set off, planning never
to return although we said nothing and smiled to our innkeeper, as we
left.

After a day of sightseeing and a ride in a glass bottom boat over the
coral reefs to see the spectacular tropical fish and sea creatures in
the Red Sea, the boatman drove us to the Youth Hostel which was perched
high on a steep hill over the Port of Aquaba and the Red Sea. The view
was spectacular. We paid for a night and asked for lodging near the
front door, so we would be alerted by sounds of approaching cars or
other noises in the night in order to protect ourselves. We took turns
sleeping and keeping watch.

Around midnight, Leah shook me awake. A car was coming up the hill and
getting louder minute by minute. We heard muffled voices of several men
and footsteps up to the front door. I whispered to Leah that this was
getting pretty old, and I was good and tired of it. I fished around in
my backpack for the folding knife I used to cut open oranges, and put
on my army surplus camo jacket. &quot;Let me talk to them, but back me up,
Leah. Do you see anything heavy you can use if we need to protect
ourselves?  She had bought a glass paperweight in a craft place at the
port, which she could use if she needed to fight someone off.

Feeling more angry than terrified, I held my flashlight in one hand,
and the open, large folding knife in the other. As the men outside
banged on our door, I opened it a crack. A swarthy, short, pot-bellied
man was standing in front of me. I shined the light in his eyes,
startling him, and held the knife blade in the beam of light. Then I
told him in my best Hebrew, &quot;If you take another step over this
threshold, I will cut your throat from ear to ear.&quot; He must have
believed me because he shut the door abruptly, and a moment later, we
heard the men scurrying off in the car and the car noisily hurtling
down the hill. Although we continued to take turns guarding the front
door, no one else bothered us after that.

To this day, I have no idea if our experiences in Beersheba and Eilat
were usual or unique. Israeli friends I told about them laughed them
off, as if they couldn't have happened and I was imagining things. But
that is certainly not the case.
Zionism Redux

Today, I no longer identify with Zionism that celebrates arrogant,
deadly abuse of power, the kind practiced by the State of Israel.
Reports of Israel's unprovoked attacks against the people of Gaza,
Lebanon and Syria are consistent with the belligerence I myself
experienced on a much smaller scale, forty years ago. I understand that
Israel will do anything to get what it needs, whether it is more secure
borders, greater military prowess, more political control over allies,
or a larger land mass.

It is a picture that Naomi Klein, in her new book, The Shock Doctrine;
The Rise of Disaster Capitalism, calls, &quot;the standing disaster
apartheid state-an economy that expands markedly in direct response to
escalating violence.&quot; Immune to political instability, Israel is now a
model for the globalist agenda and governments like our own are eager
to emulate it and enjoy booming prosperity as they escalate brutality
against enemies and wage wars against the hapless residents of
territories they occupy illegally.

In the last two decades, Israel's parlay of guns and caviar has made
it's economy one of the fastest growing and most robust in the world.
Peace no longer matters to a government like Israel's, whose economy
floats on the  market for anti-terrorism technologies. Israel's high
tech firms and global security companies dominate these markets as more
countries strive to turn themselves into impenetrable fortresses, like
Israel.

It is a recipe for war of the type the Bush Administration proposes, an
endless, global war on &quot;terror.&quot;  It is a philosophy that breeds slaves
and masters, and herds the &quot;surplus&quot; poor into slums behind walls of
steel, stone and concertina wire, so they cannot interfere with the
&quot;freedom&quot; of the markets to exploit workers and keep the populace under
iron-fisted control.

Twenty-first century Zionism has matured into neo-colonialism and this
new colonialism has no room for human rights or the survival and
dignity of ordinary people. It is as dangerous as it is despicable and
inhumane. But people all over the globe are waking up and becoming wise
to the power plays of the elites, and they are beginning to take back
their communities, rebuilding and healing them, and making them more
resilient.

The great struggle of the 21st century is not the race to the top of a
golden pinnacle by a privileged minority, but a social and spiritual
movement sweeping up all in its path.  Examples are the democracy
movement led by Buddhist priests in Burma, compasinos in Bolivia and
Mexico, the micro finance movement in India, and the peace movement in
Palestine and Israel.

Despite missiles, bombs, bullets and floods the people are rising, and
no power on earth will stop them for long. When the people are united,
they take back their power. It is just a matter of time.  ##
