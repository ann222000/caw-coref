My dear Mom recently had her walkway leading up to her house rebuilt,
and the people who did the work did a fine job, except they took down
the railing next to the old walkway. First, I'm not really sure that
that was necessary, but they make some vague claims that you can't
keep the old railing when you rebuild the walk. Does that make sense
to anyone?

Beyond that, they say that a new railing, for maybe ten to twelve feet
of railing, will cost somewhere between $800 and $1000 dollars. They
say the custom metalworking involved is what costs so much. I asked
if they could to a wooden railing, and they said that costs even more.

We're not looking for anything fancy here -- just something to hold
onto, so when the walkway ices up in the winter, there is something
solid and steady to hold onto. It doesn't have to look rich or
impressive. Should this cost anywhere near what this guy is claiming,
or is he price-gouging my Mom? And if this is what custom railing
costs, is there some cheaper but effective off-the-shelf option?

All informed input is much appreciated.

"/> Does the walkway slope? Or do you really mean the front steps? Yeah, a
'pretty' wrought-iron handrail could easily cost that much. If your Mom just
needs a hand rail, you can whip something up out of pipe parts and some
sakcrete for a couple hundred bucks. No idea what your local code says about
such things. Or if you want a little prettier than that, try the nearest
high school or vo-ed center with a welding class, and see if they would be
interested in a 'real world' project to help out a sweet little old lady. It
all would have been easier if the guys doing the walk had set sockets (or
even some old pop cans) in the new sidewalk, to catch the posts for the new
rail.

As ususal on here, could be simple, could be hard, we can't see your house
from here.

"/> Its possible if it was a concrete walkway. It the original railing
was put in place before the concrete was poured, it isnt that
easy to replace the walkway without removing the original railing.

when that isnt necessary so the owner has to buy a new one too.

You seem to have a number of responses. I recommend getting competing bids.
In the absence of complete knowledge, putting out a &quot;Request for
Proposal(RFP)&quot; and receiving competitive bids lets you look at alternative
solutions and costs. This is a small project so a formal RFP is not needed.
Just call around and have different contractors (at least three) come out
and give an estimate. You can go to Home Depot or Lowe's and get their
opinion (which may not be the best, depending upon the expertise of whoever
happens to be there - but, hey, it's free, and they might have a low-cost
solution. I've built three houses and would not venture a guess (each
state, each municipality, each building code, is different.) Everybody here
means well, but you really need local estimates.

up being the last thing we worried about because it took forever to get
someone to come just for an estimate and to show up to do the work. We got
to the point that we didn't care what it cost. We just wanted someone to

the slope, the curve is 3-dimensional, and none of the post tops are right
angles, so it means a lot of field fitting and inventing.

The cheap-out alternative is to piece it in out of off-the shelf parts
(posts and flexible panel sections used for stairways), but that would not
be pretty or user friendly, since the top rail would not be continuous and
the same distance from the pavement all the way up and down. (Picture the
railing on a typical residential ramp for mobilty-impaired people.)

Yeah, this should have been part of the specs and bid for the walkway
replacement. But if your mother needs it, she needs it. A rail is cheaper
than a new hip.

What did they do with the old rail? Even if the posts were rusted out, the
top rail may still be salvagable. If new walkway follows same course as old
one, it could at least be used as a pattern, which would cut the costs for
fabricating the new one.

(I've had to invent stuff for some older relatives myself, so I do
understand...)

you probably haven't had much construction done lately. the
killer these days is the cost of labor. skilled construction
labor to build a ***curved*** metal railing is going to cost a
contractor $45-75/hr in most of the country (counting taxes and
benefits).

it it were me, it'd build a wood one myself. cost of materials
would be $150-$200, which is about what your wild ass guessed.

"/> Like everyone's said, call around to get some estimates. But I think
your wild-ass guess is pretty low if you want something that looks and
performs like it was built and installed by professionals. People who do
professional work have to pay for the overhead of expensive professional
equipment, and they command professional salaries. Things that need to
be done by hand in this country are shockingly expensive, because our
skilled craftspeople expect (and should) earn enough to live a
comfortable middle-class lifestyle, after they cover substantial amounts
of overhead. Figuring in measuring, bending, cutting, fitting, welding,
sanding, prepping, and several coats of pain--how much time do you think
it will take a craftsperson to make this railing? How many tens of
thousands of dollars worth of equipment do you think he will use in the
process? How much do you think is the rent on his workspace? How much of
an installer's time are you taking up to have it installed, and what
sort of equipment does he need? How many other people are behind the
scenes (clerical workers, accountants, delivery drivers, etc.) when you
pay professionals to do professional work?

I'm not saying this to rag on you, and it's quite likely you can get a
lower estimate. But $200-300 also seems pretty lowball when you consider
the amount of work that goes into something like this, and the sort of
skills and equipment it entails.

The price you are getting seem to be right on the mark, especially with
steel prices having risen in the past few years.

The costs of having just about anything done to a home have skyrocketed in
recent years with labor, materials, and energy costs all through the roof.

&gt;&gt; My dear Mom recently had her walkway leading up to her house rebuilt,
&gt;&gt; and the people who did the work did a fine job, except they took down
&gt;&gt; the railing next to the old walkway. First, I'm not really sure that
&gt;&gt; that was necessary, but they make some vague claims that you can't
&gt;&gt; keep the old railing when you rebuild the walk. Does that make sense
&gt;&gt; to anyone?

&gt; Look at the contract she signed. If it didn't spell out that they were
&gt; going to remove the railing, then they weren't authorized to do it.
&gt; I'd look into forcing them to replace it at no cost.

What many people end up doing in this regard is to install a cheap version
that will meet code so that the inspector(s) will sign off.
Then after the fact the owners install what they wanted in the first place.
I designed a nice home for some folks that wanted to have a sair railing
made out of old rusty scythes, rakes and various antique tools which would
not pass code obviously. So they installed a cheap aluminum rainling that
met code then after they moved in they had what they really wanted
installed.
Such are the times we live in.
Regarding the 2&quot; sphere part, I heard that a little kid rolled a cueball off
the 3rd floor deck that hit an old guy on the top of the head and killed
him.
On outside decks we screw a 2&quot;x2&quot; strip of decking material to the deck
directly under the railing to address this issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; above the ground, at least not by more than an inch or two), which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is intended for someone (who has difficulty walking, or in case the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; walkway is iced up) walking along the walkway to support themselves,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but isn't intended to prevent anyone from getting to the other side?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've seen them with posts every 8 feet or so, and the handrail is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; maybe 3 feet above the ground, so you could fit an entire adult
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (edgewise!) under it, and small kids could walk under it without
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ducking. If that's unsafe, why?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sure there's more to the rule than what's posted here - 5 inches
&gt;&gt;&gt; apart
&gt;&gt;&gt; isn't OK, but 2 feet apart is. No one's gonna get stuck in that. (well,
&gt;&gt;&gt; ok, some people, but that's their problem.)

&gt;&gt;Thats not legal around here.
&gt;&gt;Someone can fall through it.

&gt; Fall through what? The walkway I described is on flat ground. If
&gt; you remove the handrail, it's even easier to fall through the gaps
&gt; between blades of grass or whatever than if you left it there.

And no, the codes don't have to make sense.
The OP should find out specifically what the contractors issue is regarding
the removal of the railing.
