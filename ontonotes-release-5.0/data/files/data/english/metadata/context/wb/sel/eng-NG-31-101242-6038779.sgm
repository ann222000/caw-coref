Neptune Sextile Pluto

The planets Neptune and Pluto entered orb of a sextile (* = 60 degrees
apart) aspect in the mid-1940's; and they will remain there until the
2030's.  Normally aspects between Neptune and Pluto are within orb
for only a dozen or so years at a time.  However, Pluto is presently at
a fast place in its orbit so that it is moving at about the same speed
as Neptune, at the same time that the two planets are roughly 60
degrees apart, so they are both in the sextile pattern for about a
century. Thus, there will come a moment in time when there is no one on
earth who doesn't have Neptune and Pluto sextile in their natal
horoscope. What does this mean?
In the first place, where aspects between the faster, inner planets
symbolize relationships and roles to be played in everyday life; the
aspects of the slower, outer planets - of which Neptune and Pluto are
the slowest - symbolize people's adaptation to the social order of
their times.  Aspects of slow planets refer to the assumptions,
activities, and beliefs which identify people with their generation,
and which change but slowly over the course of a lifetime.
Neptune is the planet of intuition and instinct, the receptor for all
the impressions that hover just at the fringes of rational
consciousness. It is the planet of belief, since anything which Neptune
intuits has the appearance of truth (you believe what your intuition
tells you).
Pluto is the planet of analysis and discrimination, the sense of what
is fit, just, and meet -  in a word, the morality.  If Neptune
deludes because it makes its beliefs seems true, Pluto obsesses because
it makes its judgments seem right.
Aspects between Neptune and Pluto produce generations for whom belief
must be the instrument of morality. They are rather more idealistic and
even revolutionary in pursuing their particular visions of utopia than
are generations lacking Neptune-Pluto aspects, who basically just
conform to the social codes instituted by the preceding Neptune-Pluto
aspect generation. These generations are not necessarily more moral or
spiritual than generations lacking Neptune-Pluto contacts, but they are
more self-consciously moral and spiritual. They need to believe that
the human race is progressing towards a goal, and that there is
something which each individual must do in order to help it along.
They demand that the social contract reflect and uphold universal
principles. They feel a need to justify their actions before the throne
of history. They need to believe that they were chosen, willy-nilly, to
bring light to mankind.
The "hard" aspects between Neptune and Pluto (the conjunction, square,
and opposition) tend to produce generations which are stern,
disciplined, and controlled. People born under these aspects are
constrained by their society to repress their own personal desires for
the sake of the common weal. On the other hand, the "soft" aspects
between Neptune and Pluto (the sextile and trine) produce generations
of individualists, for whom the only purpose society serves is to
facilitate the happiness of its individual members.
The generation born with Neptune square Pluto (1809-1825) needed to
believe in the better instincts of the great mass of humanity. The
statesmen of this generation brought about the sweeping destruction of
old social orders and class distinctions and the reorganization of
society along vaster and more inclusive lines.  Bismarck in Germany and
Cavour in Italy welded clusters of small states into unified nations.
Lincoln freed the slaves in America, and Alexander II emancipated the
serfs in Russia.
The current of these times was toward unification, broadening the
social contract to bring more and more people into the governing
process. In the vanguard were the suffragists Susan B. Anthony,
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Lucy Stone; and on the more violent and
revolutionary side, Marx, Engels and Bakunin.  There was an
intellectual tendency to view humanity en masse and to exalt the poor
and downtrodden.  Of the few notable painters of this generation,
Courbet and Millet stand out with their realistic paintings of workers
and peasants.
The literature of this generation also exhibited great compassion for
the suffering of the common man in a world indifferent to him.  The
writing of Dickens, Melville, Dostoevsky, Poe, the Brontes tended to be
dramatic, with an undercurrent of violence and an obsession with
questions of morality and immorality. The sense of the time was that
the cosmos, if not actually hostile, was at least disinterested in the
fate of humanity. The theories of Darwin, Mendel, and Pasteur posited
mechanistic models of nature which implied that the.human condition was
the product of largely impersonal forces.
The square aspect is forever trying to make sense out of the senseless
and to rationalize the irrational.  Dr. Marc Edmund Jones' keyword
for the square is CONSTRUCTION.  With Neptune square Pluto, objective,
analytical mind was ever at war with intuition, so this generation -
the generation of Queen Victoria - never really could trust its own
personal instincts.  Its morality had to be certified by the experience
of humanity as a whole.  Its only hope was that the entire human race
would accept the responsibility for guiding its collective destiny.
The generation born with Neptune conjunct Pluto (1886-1898) needed to
believe in the inspiration of the outstanding personality.
Statesmanship in this generation often approached Caesar-worship.  Its
highly charismatic leaders governed by sheer force of personality,
coupled with direct and absolute methods: Hitler, Mao, Franco, de
Gaulle, Peron, and Tito are examples. When each leader passed on, his
work was largely dismantled by his successors.
The cult of personality even pervaded the sciences.  The theories of
Immanuel Velikovsky, Norbert Weiner, Wilhelm Reich, and T.D. Lysenko
created storms of controversy with rabid partisans and opponents.
Rather than building onto existing bodies of knowledge, the thinkers of
this generation were lone visionaries off on their own personal
tangents and out of the scientific mainstream.
The conjunction is the most subjective of aspects, and the Neptune
conjunct Pluto generation took more stock in feelings than in reason or
logic.  The writers of this generation produced a highly subjective and
stylized body of literature. Brecht, Faulkner, O'Neill and Wilder had
intensely introspective and personalized slants on life, and their
writing and characters tended to be artless and amoral.
Artless and amoral is also a good description of the art and morals of
the Dadaist and Surrealist painters. The art of Duchamps, Arp, de
Chirico, Ernst, Chagall, Miro was highly personal and idiosyncratic, a
revolt against conventional aesthetic sensibilities and a glorification
of unbridled imagination.
The Neptune-Pluto conjunction tended to bring out the delusional side
of Neptune and the obsessive side of Pluto because there was no
separation of analytical mind from intuition, so anything imaginable
was justifiable, and conscience could not be brought in as an outside
check upon morality.  Dr. Jones' keyword for the conjunction aspect
is ACTIVITY:  this generation was too often eager to destroy all that
had gone before in the name of a fanatical search for ideological
purity.  It was a generation of extremists with a narrow and intense
focus, and it centered its hopes in certain personalities of severe
morals and vivid imagination.  It needed to believe in the inspiration
of its prophets.
The previous generation born with Neptune sextile Pluto (l837-1851)
needed to believe in the individual, and in a cosmos both sympathetic
and infinitely pliable.  It believed that it was the function of the
state to serve the individual rather than vice versa, and as a result
its statesmen were neither great innovators nor inspired leaders.
Clemenceau, Cleveland, Hindenburg, McKinley were noted for their
sterile conservatism and their defense of profit and privilege.
This generation was less interested in ultimate ends and meanings than
in ways of getting things done.  It loved to tinker, and it produced
the great experimentors Bell, Edison and Burbank.  Its scientists were
not so much theoreticians as experimentalists: Michelson, Cantor,
Pavlov, Krafft-Ebing made great contributions to the methodologies of
their respective disciplines but they are most notable for the
questions which their new techniques stirred up, but left unanswered.
Even the literature of this generation was marked by technical
refinement and scientific precision.  Zola, Henry James, Strindberg,
Maupassant wrote about human behavior from the standpoint of objective
psychology, reporting even life's sordid and seamy side with clinical
detachment.
In art Neptune sextile Pluto represents technique rather than content,
such as the transient light effects of the Impressionists Monet,
Renoir, Cezanne, Gauguin; or in an earlier Neptune sextile Pluto
generation, the balance and geometrical perfection of High Renaissance
artists such as Michelangelo, Raphael, and Titian.  Impressionism is
considered the beginning of modernism in art because these painters
were the first to regard the act of painting as a technical process
more important than an accurate depiction of subject matter.
Neptune sextile Pluto was usually more interested in form than in
substance.  It believed that form was substance, that technique was an
end in itself.  It loved to objectively analyze intuitive impressions,
to give its instinctive feelings a whirl. The sextile is the most
pragmatic and opportunistic of the aspects, and with Neptune sextile
Pluto, anything realizable was justifiable: whatever seemed to work was
considered good. This generation regarded the world as a laboratory in
which to tinker, and it identified human progress with efficiency and
technical advancement.
For the most part, it was. The previous Neptune sextile Pluto
generation came of age in the 1860s through 1880s, a time of
unprecedented economic and social expansion. In Europe, imperialism was
the vogue, and vast colonial empires were carved out of Africa and
Asia. In America, the West was won. Everywhere western technological
civilization gained undisputed hegemony over native peoples and
cultures. Not only did this civilization spread out, it also began to
assume a more and more complex character.
The Industrial Revolution was in full swing in the advanced nations,
especially in America. In the words of historians Nevins and Commager
in A Pocket History of the  US. (Washington Square Press, 1969), "No
other generation in American history witnessed changes as swift or as
revolutionary as those which transformed the rural republic of Lincoln
and Lee into the urban industrial empire of McKinley and Roosevelt."
The telegraph and rail networks put every part of the country into
communication with every other part, facilitating the rapid movement of
information, raw materials manufactured goods and food stuffs.
Great opportunities opened up, and great fortunes were made. Morality
was a matter of individual conscience, and often great wealth was taken
to be the outward sign of great spiritual worth. This was the era of
the robber barons Rockefeller, Morgan, Frick, Hill and of the trusts
and monopolies. Big Business was born and it quickly seized the reins
of power in America.  Labor unions under leaders such as Gompers and
Powderly arose as a counterbalance to the power of business
combinations. For the first time, national and international factors
were more important to the average person than local conditions.
Burgeoning industry tore at the earth and its resources with the same
abandon with which it exploited labor.  Pollution began to be
recognized as a widespread problem, and wilderness disappeared at a
fantastic rate before the onslaught of loggers, homesteaders, miners
and railroaders.  American civilization in the late 19th Century
exhibited a limitless optimism predicated upon a system of limitless
expansion.
All generations born with Neptune Sextile Pluto are particularly
pragmatic and utilitarian; their watchword is practicality - "if it
works, do it!" (and don't worry about traditional wisdom).  Neptune
Sextile Pluto, like all sextiles, is poised to seize opportunities as
they arise.  Dr. Jones' keyword for the sextile aspect is PRODUCTION.
Sextiles are technocratic rather than philosophical, pragmatic rather
than theoretical.  In contrast to the other aspects between Neptune and
Pluto, the sextile generations produce few exceptional statesmen or
social leaders because the emphasis here is on individual
interpretations rather than reliance on societal fiat. These
generations are not particularly interested in doing what they're told
unless they can see how their own needs are directly served thereby,
and they tend to be suspicious of leaders and authority. Thus in
religion they tend towards individualism, such as the "priesthood of
all believers" of Luther and Zwingli in an earlier Neptune sextile
Pluto generation, which R.H. Tawney (in Religion and the Rise of
Capitalism) characterized as "the triumph of the commercial spirit over
the traditional social ethics of Christendom.  If the reformer did not
explicitly teach a conscienceless individualism, individualism was, at
least, the natural corollary of their teaching."
If the sextile resembles Neptune conjunct Pluto in its "end justifies
the means" amorality, it also inclines to the Neptune trine Pluto faith
in common sense standards of justice and fair play.  The two faces of
Neptune sextile Pluto are exemplified in an earlier generation by
Niccolo Machiavelli (amoral practicality) on the one hand, and Sir
Thomas Moore (Utopian Humanism) on the other.  In Neptune sextile Pluto
generations each individual is expected to come up with his or her own
answers, rather than to rely on experts or interpreters to intercede
for them; to find purpose and meaning for themselves within the bounds
of natural courtesy and respect for other individuals.
The manner in which each individual Neptune sextile Pluto native adapts
him or herself to their generation's ideal of taking personal
responsibility for making one's own choices is shown by the value of
the Neptune sextile Pluto aspect in their birth horoscope. The value is
simply the orb of inexactitude:  if Neptune and Pluto are within one
degree of exact sextile, then the value is one; if greater than one and
less than or equal to two degrees from exactitude, the value is two,
and so on. This technique was devised by Dr. Marc Edmund Jones in his
Lecture - Lesson on Pythagorean Astrology, Sabian Publishing, 1929,
from which the keywords for the aspects were also taken.

DR. JONES' KEYWORDS FOR THE VALUES (Aspect Orbs)

1= EMPHASIS (Doing)     4 = HABIT (Limitation)
2 = CHANGE (Thinking)   5 = EXPRESSION (Skill)
3 = GROWTH (Relating)   6 = EXPANSION (Self-enlargement)

1. EMPHASIS (Doing)  All aspects within one degree of exactitude
reveal their meaning in its purest, knee-jerk-responsive form - "as
near impersonal as it is possible for them to be and yet be individual
experiences."  Thus natives with Neptune sextile Pluto within one
degree of exactness are the most compulsively pragmatic and
individualistic - not in the sense of being rebellious or flaunting
their independence of spirit, but rather they are self-contained lone
wolves. They are idealists off on their own tangents, hence they are
not especially successful in mundane affairs unless the rest of the
chart is dynamic.  They have considerable self-discipline, are self
motivated and self-starting, and are conscientious and dedicated.  On
the negative side they lack perspective:  they are too focused on the
path beneath their feet and easily become mired in their thinking.
Their individualism manifests as a naive doggedness and scrupulosity
which inspires others with its unassuming honesty and integrity.
Examples: Dan Aykroyd, Mikhail Baryishnikov, John Belushi, Alice
Cooper, Farrah Fawcett, Bill Gates, Michael Jackson, Magic Johnson, Jay
Leno, Madonna, Maria Shriver, Stevie Wonder.

2. CHANGE (Thinking).  All aspects between one and two degrees of
exactness indicate flexibility, the ability to adapt oneself to
changing conditions - "universals are only to be perceived in terms
of constant flux."  This means that natives with Neptune sextile Pluto
greater than one but less than two degrees from exactitude are the most
experimentally pragmatic and individualistic: eager to learn new things
and to examine situations and other people's ideas and motivations from
different points of view.  Like the one's, the two's are hardworking
and competent (all Neptune sextile Pluto natives are - Dr. Jones'
keyword for the sextile is PRODUCTION), but the reach here is more
towards understanding than psychological independence. They are
thoughtful, introspective, and arrive at solutions to problems by
thinking them through rather than bulldozing ahead.  On the negative
side, lacking the single-mindedness of the one's, they can come across
as being indecisive, bland, and wishy-washy:  too lacking in firmness
to be masterful (unless the rest of the chart cooperates). Their
individualism manifests as a naive intellectual curiosity which
inspires others with its unpretentious open-mindedness. Examples: David
Bowie, Albert Gore, Kevin Costner, Whitney Houston, Tonya Harding,
Nancy Kerrigan, Elton John, Dan Quayle, Steven Spielberg, Howard Stern,
Robin Williams, Oprah Winfrey.

3. GROWTH (Relating).  All aspects between two and three degrees of
exactitude symbolize friendliness - "the expanding element of simple
co-operation in being.  It is the basis of pure social relationship,
the emanation of ... self to the point of fellowship with other
selves." Accordingly, natives with Neptune sextile Pluto between two
and three degrees of exactitude are the most socially pragmatic and
individualistic: outgoing, gregarious, eager to please; yet still
original - fun-loving and mischievous, with a true sense of irony.
They are cheerfully optimistic, and enjoy other people instead of
analyzing them (two's) or ignoring them (one's).  They live and let
live, and try to turn aside from conflict and unpleasantness. On the
negative side they are inclined to sidestep or slough off problems, to
let things slide until they build to a crisis (rather than tackling
them directly or thinking them through). Their individualism manifests
in a detached, light, unconcerned manner which inspires others with its
graciousness and buoyant hopefulness.  Examples: Princess Anne, Prince
Charles, Princess Diana, Prince, Tom Cruise, Mia Farrow, Arsenio Hall,
Diane Keaton Liza Minelli, Bill Murray, John Travolta, Jann Wenner.

4. HABIT (Limitation). All aspects between three and four degrees of
exactitude symbolize a tenacity and sagacity which must "observe and
classify and understand."  Natives with Neptune sextile Pluto between
three and four degrees of exactness are the most eccentrically
pragmatic and individualistic - highly self-attuned and self-assured,
with great depth and delicacy of feeling. They march to the beat of a
distant drum and have a spirit of errant adventure. They are calm and
knowing, with good intuition and the ability to stop to listen to what
their hearts are telling them. Where the two's reach out for
intellectual comprehension, the outreach of the four's is less
cerebral, more a passionate (and compassionate) lust for life. For the
four's understanding is not so much a matter of formulating ideals as
it is living one's ideals to the fullest, of drinking life to the
dregs.  On the negative side they are stubborn, self-willed, convinced
of their invincibility and rectitude, and inclined to go to the
extremes of human experience (and endurance). Their individualism
manifests in their ability to stand up for themselves with utter
disregard for the social consequence, and they inspire others with
their nobility of spirit and their can-do Quixotism.  Examples: Cher
Bono, Eric Clapton, Hillary Clinton, John Denver, Goldie Hawn, Steve
Martin, Bette Midler, Diana Ross, Bruce Springsteen, Rod Stewart, Alice
Walker.

5.. EXPRESSION (Skill).  All aspects between four and five degrees of
exactitude are ingenious and straightforward - "the clue to a man's
heart lies in his artlessness - simplicity, smooth functioning in
little things."  Natives with Neptune sextile Pluto between four and
five degrees of exactness are the most candidly pragmatic and
individualistic: they are not particularly humble or self-effacing, but
rather waste little energy in affectation or posturing - they are
plain vanilla with no frills, and just get down to the real business at
hand. The striving here is towards reasonableness, fairness, and clear
communication with others. They possess a good-natured bonhomie, which
on the negative side inclines them towards talking rather than doing;
they can be noncommittal or hedging when what is needed is fairness and
taking a stand.  Their individualism manifests in their unvarnished
outspokenness - saying what they think without fear.  They inspire
others with their optimism, frankness, and impartiality.  Examples:
Danny DiVito, Michael Eisner, George Harrison, Janis Joplin, Stephen
King, George Lucas, Jim Morrison, Eddie Murphy, Donald Trump, O.J.
Simpson, Sylvester Stallone, George W. Bush.

6. EXPANSION (Self-enlargement). All aspects between five and six
degrees of exactitude show a no-nonsense practicality: "bending of
outer factors to inner convenience; smoothness in the accomplishment of
things." Natives with Neptune sextile Pluto between five and six
degrees of exactness are the most dispassionately pragmatic and
individualistic:  they are cool, down-to-earth, purposeful and
realistic - ready to roll up their sleeves and get to work. They are
deft at processing, whether this be people or problems, and they are
willing to take on more than their fair share of responsibility, which
on the negative side can lead them to deliberately multiply their
burdens and then feel put upon; or to push into areas where their
counsel is neither needed nor appreciated. Their individualism is
manifested in their ability to meet and even exceed their own (rather
than society's) expectations; and they inspire others with their
thoroughness and selfless dedication.  Examples: Connie Chung, Bill
Clinton, Michael Douglas, Jose Feliciano, Aretha Franklin, Stephen
Hawking, Jimi Hendrix, Calvin Klein, Martin Scoroese, Barbara
Streisand, Marlo Thomas.

For everyone born in this Neptune sextile Pluto generation there comes
a point in time when transiting Pluto arrives at the point that Neptune
occupied in the natal horoscope (for those born in the twentieth
century, this occurs at some time during one's twenties); and because
of Pluto's retrograde (back-and-forth) motion the effect lasts for
almost a year. The specific events triggered by transiting Pluto
conjunct Neptune can occur anytime during that period; but the general
tendency is for them to occur at the beginning or at the end (rather
than in the middle).  A lot of what might be expected to happen depends
on what else is going on at the same time in other transit and
progressions. Generally speaking, however, transiting Pluto conjunct
Neptune presents a major challenge:  important new responsibilities or
commitments.  At first you may doubt your ability to handle them;
there's a question of whether you're really up to it.  Since it's
transiting Pluto, it tends to extremes: thus transiting Pluto conjunct
Neptune is either extremely joyous and fulfilling (the usual case,
since the planets are natally sextile); or else it's an extreme bummer
(if concurrent transit and progressions are unfavorable); but it's
rarely in-between. Thus Pluto means extreme something: you have to push
something to the limits. What is required is acting (and reacting)
according to your gut-level intuition (Neptune) to go with how you feel
rather than what society has told you (the natal Neptune sextile Pluto
influence).  This is a year of maturation, of putting aside your
rose-tinted illusions (Neptune) and coming to grips with life directly
(Pluto).
