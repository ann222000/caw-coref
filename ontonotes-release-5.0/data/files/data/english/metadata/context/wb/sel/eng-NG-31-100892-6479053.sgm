let us define free will as the ability to respond to stimuli with choice
in a manner that is not determined by any factor but itself

let us also define free will as the ability to have any response in with
the same criteria above, under conditions of no stimuli

those who believe in emergent behavior, believe all of our responses are
predetermined by biological means, in fact they believe all of our urges
and desires result from biology

these two theories are in conflict

I, for one, believe I have free will and that NOTHING determines my
choices but myself, I am not saying we do not have conditioned responses
to stimuli, but we choose based on will alone, what are conditioning is

the implication of free will is that no determined system, like biology,
which is determined by the rules of physics, can result in a free will

what follows is that we are not biology, but psychology, that has a
relationship to biology

this also means that are psychology cannot result from any evolution or
physically determined process of creation

it means, psychology is separate from biology in the sense of life after
death

and in the relationship of psychology to biology, it means there must be
an intermediate, since we do not consciously interact with our central
nervous system, yet the will exhibits times of domain over the body

those who believe in behavior that emerges from biology, emergent
behavior, believe a mysterious subconscious mediates the relationship
between the conscious and the central nervous system

but a free will would negate a subsconscious, in that the conscious will
makes the choices, not the subconscious

this leads to a disconnect in reality, if reality requires an
intermediate, the subconscious, that does not exist, there is a hole in
reality, and what we percieve is not reality at all, but an illusion or
dream, that is driven into us based onn our motives and emotions, by
higher intelligence

"Free will" may be treated similar to "consciousness",
as is treated in this Edge contribution :

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;NICHOLAS HUMPHREY
&gt;Psychologist, London School of Economics; Author, The Mind Made Flesh

&gt;I believe that human consciousness is a conjuring trick, designed to fool us into thinking we are in the presence of an
&gt;inexplicable mystery. Who is the conjuror and why is s/he doing it? The conjuror is natural selection, and the purpose has been to
&gt;bolster human self-confidence and self-importance-so as to increase the value we each place on our own and others' lives.

&gt;If this is right, it provides a simple explanation for why we, as scientists or laymen, find the &quot;hard problem&quot; of consciousness
&gt;just so hard. Nature has meant it to be hard. Indeed &quot;mysterian&quot; philosophers-from Colin McGinn to the Pope-who bow down before the
&gt;apparent miracle and declare that it's impossible in principle to understand how consciousness could arise in a material brain, are
&gt;responding exactly as Nature hoped they would, with shock and awe.

&gt;Can I prove it? It's difficult to prove any adaptationist account of why humans experience things the way they do. But here there
&gt;is an added catch. The Catch-22 is that, just to the extent that Nature has succeeded in putting consciousness beyond the reach of
&gt;rational explanation, she must have undermined the very possibility of showing that this is what she's done.

&gt;But nothing's perfect. There may be a loophole. While it may seem-and even be-impossible for us to explain how a brain process
&gt;could have the quality of consciousness, it may not be at all impossible to explain how a brain process could (be designed to) give
&gt;rise to the impression of having this quality. (Consider: we could never explain why 2 + 2 = 5, but we might relatively easily be
&gt;able to explain why someone should be under the illusion that 2 + 2 = 5).

&gt;Do I want to prove it? That's a difficult one. If the belief that consciousness is a mystery is a source of human hope, there may
&gt;be a real danger that exposing the trick could send us all to hell.

How is the choice determined by itself? You seem to be saying that

I cannot imagine a brain under no stimuli. No memories, no prior

As far as I can tell, you have only offered a series of unrelated

You have not yet supported them, explained them, or shown how one

society, etc, then why can evolution *not have produced it?

Perhaps free will is the illusion. The self seems to be. I really do

You believe in a lot of things that aren't true because your conditioning is

because there is nothing to say about the real world which is beyond words.
Language is useful to organise groups of people to cooperate. For instance
planning and running a hunting party. Except for these practical things
language is just a game we engage in for amusement. I amuse myself writing

That's not a very productive way of defining free will, as the
defintion itself excludes it from investigation, by defining it as
something outside the physical realm.

The only thing this definition tells us, is that you have a religious
understanding of free will.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The cental word here is BELIEVE. You don't have any evidence for this
point of view, you just apriori choose to belive that this is how it
is.
That however was clear already from the way you defined free will.

A more productive way of defining free will could be, the subjective
experience feeling that you are making choices,

For my own part I think that a satisfactory explanation to
consiousness  will never be given. Sure, we will be able to pinpoint
the location of specific thoughts and decissions in the brain with
still better accuracy.
But you cant't have an explanation of a subjectiv experience, although
we may be able to explain how this experience arises.

Sorry I don't get this disconnect you talk about.

Can you speak to me in more plain English? I like your ideas that we
have free will, but no one in everyday life speaks like "Let us assume
that bla bla bla".

I just find formality hard to read, and to be honest it detracts from
your message by making it more boring,w hich is a shame as you are
talking about an interesting subject.

Anyhow, I agree we have free will...

My take is that biology affects our decisions. And that biology can
even affect what kind of soul chooses to reincarnate in a body. Kind
of like a driver's tastes affects what car he's gonna buy. But we
still have free will even if biology affects us.

I still don't get the disconnect...

My free will can affect anything. Not just my body but the world
around me. It's just a few trillion times tighter integrated into my
body. And even then, only into certain parts of my body.

Unfortunately, that is because I've inherited a body created by evil
souls, as I live on a planet of evil. Earth is the planet of evil you
know. On other dimensions, there is no war, no lies, no misery or
fear, and the creatures don't eat each other, although there are
things to eat, such as fruits and drinks or other things given to eat
instead of taken.

I think it should be possible to create a "soul attachment material",
sort of like a velcro patch for the soul, to allow souls to
reincarnate into robots... Of course, they'd have to WANT to
reincarnate there, or else they'd arrive, be like "oh wow this feels
funny.... but kinda boring, OK lets go now", and leave! If you wanted
someone to reincarnate into a robot you'd have to make it worthwhile
reincarnating there.

No, I communicated very well with my Thai wife using hugs, holding hands and

We only needed a few words of each other's language, mainly related to food
or money ie the material side of life. The spiritual/sexual (they are the
same thing) stuff needs no words. Free will is an illusion,

So you admit that your inventions are nothing but words and don't exist in

In other words they don't work and have no practical applications.
An idea has to be earthed to manifest in the real world. That is your
disconnect from reality.
You live in an imaginary world of your own and that is insanity.

explains this to my satisfaction. This book should have been recognised as

CNS helps to interact with our bodies... but it's not the only way. It
can be done with free will alone.

I can push my car without getting into the driver's seat. But it's
easier to move by getting inside and using the controls. The same with
our bodies. The driver is not an illusion, and the controls are not an
illusion.

How do you "know" this? At best we observe what appears to be
"free will."

Because it is socially responsible to do so. See the chapter on
the subject in "Black Holes and Baby Universes:" the correct
answer is in there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

All the evidence thus far points to the fact that humans do not
have "free will" and that we live in a clock-work universe where
effect always follows cause. There has never been an observation
on the not sub-atomic level that has been otherwise.

So the ball is still in your court: you must first show that "free
will" exists before you can start saying what its properties are.

We do have choice to a degree - but our choices in any given situation
are mostly limited. So our so-called "free will" is not truly free
(unrestricted) in that respect. Depends on your personality and a lot of
other factors. For some people engaging in a fist fight is never an
option, others have trouble staying away from the excitement.

What about the possibility that were merely are our central nervous
system.  Then the central nervous system could have free will insofar
as it does everything it wants.  And what your nervous system wants is
based on physical contraints.  You are talking as if you and your
central nervous system and you were two different things. When you
refer to yourself you are refering to a soul(or soul like entity)
rather than a organism.  Thus your argument is:  Since I am a soul
there must be a soul.  And sure, maybe you are a soul.  But your
argument is not going to convince anyone because its conclusion is
contained in the premise.   Just out of curiosity:  What is your faith?

&gt; &gt; let us also define free will as the ability to have any response in

&gt; I am on drugs right now, and absolutely none of what you just said makes

&gt; &gt; those who believe in emergent behavior, believe all of our responses

&gt; Emergent properties imply biological determinism? Um, not quite.

&gt; Why don't you try smashing together two other ideas that have nothing to

&gt; believe that Cubism sucks, in fact they reject all post-modern art'?

&gt; &gt; these two theories are in conflict

&gt; What two theories? You have not mentioned any two theories. You started

&gt; *whistles* Theory! Theory! *whistles* Come here, boy! Theeeeoooooorrrryyyy!

&gt; *waits*

&gt; Nope, there is not a single theory anywhere in sight of here.

&gt; &gt; those who believe in behavior that emerges from biology, emergent
&gt; &gt; behavior, believe a mysterious subconscious mediates the relationship
&gt; &gt;  between the conscious and the central nervous system

&gt; You're really not very good at this 'describing what other people
&gt; believe' thing, you know. You should probably stop doing it so much.

&gt; &gt; this leads to a disconnect in reality, if reality requires an
&gt; &gt; intermediate, the subconscious, that does not exist, there is a hole
&gt; &gt; in reality, and what we percieve is not reality at all, but an
&gt; &gt; illusion or dream, that is driven into us based onn our motives and
&gt; &gt; emotions, by higher intelligence

Did you deliberate with yourself before typing the words "Please show
evidence that free will exists. Thank you."? If so, and you hit the
"Send" button, then, yes, you had the freedom to do it, wanted to, and
acted accordingly. You also had the choice not to, but you rejected
it. More likely than not, you have free will.
