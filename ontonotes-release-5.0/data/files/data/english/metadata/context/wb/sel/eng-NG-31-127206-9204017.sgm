What happens, in terms of draft picks, when a player has an option and
declines it? Does the team that lost him still get a draft pick?
Example would be Pettitte, who had an option to return to NYY for $16
m but declined it. Also ARod.

Presumably an A FA would want a player option, even one at a bad
price, if the result were that the new team would not have to give up
a pick. So, it would make sense to require the pick, but I don't know
the rule.

Unless there's some wording in the contract that says otherwise, the
original team still has the right to offer arbitration, and would be
entitled to a pick or picks if the player signed elsewhere (and was
ranked).  Sometimes contracts will actually say that the team can't
offer arbitration if the player doesn't pick up the option, but that
seems to be fairly rare.

So I would guess that they'll be able to offer Pettitte arbitration,
though Andy has said he'd either return or retire.  Cashman said that
they'll honor the $16 million contract if Andy decides to come back,
even though the deadline passed.  (I hope he doesn't go sign with the
Dodgers, because that would come off as very hypocritical, IMHO.)

I'm not sure about the A-Rod situation.  IIRC, Drew's opt-out
prohibited the Dodgers from offering arbitration, which is why Boston
didn't give up a pick for him.  Since Boras handled that contract, I
would assume that A-Rod's is similar, so the Yanks may not be able to
offer arbitration.  Any Yankee fans out there know the story?

I think Pettite is absolutely critical to the Yankees next year. If he
doesn't come back all they have is a bunch of prospects and Wang in
their rotation.

I hope Hal or Hank says something and Pettite decides he doesn't want
any part of the new Boss.

And Mussina, who looked better at the very end of the year than
he did at the end of August/beginning of September (though in and
of itself, that's not saying much).

Wang, Mussina, Hughes, Kennedy, and one of Chamberlain, Rasner,
Igawa, Clippard, or DeSalvo (or someone else of whom I'm not
thinking)?  If Hughes looks like he did in the minors and Kennedy
stays as good as he was in his 20 innings of work in the majors
and if Mussina bounces back... and if everyone stays healthy...

No, it doesn't look terribly good for the Yankees' pitching right
now if they don't re-sign Pettitte (and/or convince Clemens to
return).  Plenty of potential there, but not a lot of depth in
case the young pitchers experience growing pains.

Pettitte can probably get more than $16 million for one year
from the Yankees right now.  Pettitte is as good a bet to be
good next year (offhand) as just about any other pitcher on
the market (now that Schilling is off the market), give or
take Clemens.  If I'm the Yankees, I'm calling up Pettitte's
agent and asking how many truckloads of cash Pettitte wants
in order to return to the team.

With Rodriguez leaving, all of Pettitte, Posada, Rivera,
Clemens, (and anyone else I may be forgetting who is a
free agent) have the Yankees over a barrell -- in ARod,
they're losing 6-8 wins over what currently looks like
his replacement.  All of a sudden, they're not only not
necessarily a good bet for the wild card, there's room
for the Blue Jays to catch them.  God help them if
Christmas time comes and they can't even find the GI
Joe with the Kung Fu Grip!

Catch you later.
