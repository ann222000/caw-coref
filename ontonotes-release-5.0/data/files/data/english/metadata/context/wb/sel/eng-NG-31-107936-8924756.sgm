THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.
-------------------------

HENRY CATTO (chairman emeritus, The Atlantic Council):  I'm Henry
Catto, the chairman emeritus of the Atlantic Council.  I would like to
welcome you all to this second session of our Global Leadership
Series.

Our mission here at the Atlantic Council is to energize the Atlantic
community for the global challenges of the 21st century, and the
purpose of this speakers series is to bring key leaders in the
Atlantic community to the council to discuss these challenges and how
best we can deal with them.  And the biggest one, perhaps, facing us
currently is Iraq.

Before we get to the topic of the evening, I would like to
acknowledge the support of my fellow board member, David Aufhauser,
who, in his role as UBS general counsel, has made possible UBS's
generous support of this Global Leadership Series.

Today it's a particular pleasure for me to introduce General Jim
Jones, who is not only an extraordinary leader but is my successor of
the chairman of The Atlantic Council.  He now heads the Institute for
21st Century Energy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, after serving as
Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and as 32nd Commandant of the
United States Marine Corps.

For the last couple of months, General Jones has served as chair of
the Independent Commission on Security Forces of Iraq and presented
his report this week to -- last week, it was -- to Congress.  He's
here today to share with us his conclusions and what they mean for the
way ahead in Iraq.

Here to make sure that the general answers the tough questions that
you all are likely to throw at him is The Atlantic Council president,
Fred Kempe, who was a veteran journalist and editor for 25 years with
The Wall Street Journal -- will moderate the discussion after General
Jones's introductory remarks.

General Jones?

GEN. JONES:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Henry.

And when I asked Fred what the -- how the program would be shaped, he
said, &quot;Well, 10 minutes of remarks and 45 to 50 minutes of questions,&quot;
and I said, &quot;I'd much prefer the other way around.&quot;  (Laughter.)

I'd like to acknowledge a couple of people that are here.  One, the
former Defense minister of Spain, Mr. Martino --

Q     (Off mike.)

GEN. JONES:  -- of Italy -- pardon me, excuse me -- Italy --

Q     (Laughs.)

GEN. JONES:  -- yeah, all right, time goes by; you -- (inaudible) --
apologize -- who is a very great supporter of the alliance and a great
friend to the United States.  And we're grateful for your presence,
Minister.  Thank you.

And the recently retired vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Ed
Giambastiani.  Ed, it's good to see you tonight.

You know, to start things off on a light note, some of you know who
know me know that I particularly like inter-service humor.  So I
wanted to share a story that may be a true story, about an Air Force
captain who narrowly escaped serious injury recently -- this is from a
newspaper clip that I found this morning -- when he decided to try
horseback riding, even though he had never had any lessons or any
prior experience.

So he mounted the horse unassisted, and the horse immediately sprang
into action.  As it galloped along at a steady and rhythmic pace, the
captain began to slip from the saddle.  In terror, he grabbed for the
horse's mane, but he couldn't get a firm grip.  He tried to throw his
arms around the horse's neck, but he began to slide down the side of
the horse anyway.

The horse galloped along, seemingly impervious to its slipping
rider.  Finally losing his frail grip, the captain attempted to leap
away from the horse and throw himself to safety, but unfortunately his
foot became entangled in the stirrup.  He was now at the mercy of the
horse's pounding hoofs as his head struck the ground over and over and
over.

As his head was being battered against the ground and he was near --
moments away from unconsciousness, to his great fortune a Marine
sergeant who was shopping at Wal-Mart saw him and quickly unplugged
the horse.  (Laughter.)

Q     Thank you!  (Laughter continues.)

GEN. JONES:  It's in honor of General Scowcroft.  (Laughter,
applause.)

(Chuckles.)

I'm not sure Iraq is really what you all really want to talk about
after having gone through the marathons that you've witnessed and no
doubt listened to and the myriad of articles that you've read.  So I'm
certainly not going to go through a long dissertation here about the
commission.  Hopefully some you may have read it, some of you may have
heard something about it, but I'll just give you a very, very brief
overview, and we will get to Q's and A's as quickly as possible.

On the 6th of September, this commission did report to the Congress,
and I want to just go over the four or five main points of the
enacting legislation because it's important as you consider what the
commission did and what it didn't do.

The first part of the enacting legislation was that the commission
was asked to evaluate the capability of Iraqi security forces with
regard to the territorial integrity of the country.  In other words,
can they -- could they protect the country.  And our finding there was
generally no, with some -- with a distinction, and the distinction
being that Iraqi security forces, which comprise the police forces and
the emerging armed forces, have made some progress in being able to
respond to the internal threats of the country.  But the traditional
defense of the nation, the defense of the borders, is something that
is still a ways away, and that distinction is important to keep in
mind.  So the answer to the question is no, but that doesn't
necessarily mean that that's unsatisfactory, it just means it hasn't
arrived yet.

The second one was to deny international terrorists a safe haven,
evaluate their capability with regard to that.  And that's more along
the lines of the internal threat that I was just talking about.  And
we found that on that score the developing Iraqi security forces,
notably the Iraqi army, was more able to take on that mission.

The third question was whether the emerging Iraqi security forces
would be able to bring greater security over the next 12 to 18 months
to Iraq.  And we found that basically, based on the current trend
lines and assuming that they continue, that there were indications to
believe that that answer could be a positive one as well.

And the last one was to evaluate the potential of bringing to -- an
end to sectarian violence by the Iraqi security forces to achieve
national reconciliation.   After our study, we really -- we really
came to the conclusion that that question should have been turned on
its head and the question should have been can the government of Iraq
bring about political reconciliation in order to end sectarian
violence.  It's a little bit of a chicken-and-egg question.  But the
idea that the armed forces of Iraq are going to -- by themselves or
the coalition -- to bring an end to sectarian violence is not really
the recipe that we think is the most -- the easiest one to tackle.  As
a matter of fact, it's a little backwards.  The real overall
conclusion is that the government of Iraq is the one that had to find
a way to achieve political reconciliation in order to enable a
reduction in sectarian violence.

So those were the -- well, the other thing we were asked to do was to
evaluate the Iraqi security forces' capabilities in such areas as
training, equipment, command and control, intelligence, logistics,
those kinds of enablers.  And so we did that as we went along
everywhere, and we found that generally speaking, that while the Iraqi
army, in particular, was able to take on more responsibilities in
terms of the day-to-day combat operations against the internal threats
of the country, that they were still lacking in critical enablers
along those lines.  And so, much more needs to be done before the army
can move in to what is termed an &quot;independent ability to act on its
own.&quot;

So we had 20 commissioners.  We spent the equivalent of about three
weeks in the country and we visited all these sites that you see on
these boards displayed in front of you, this one in Baghdad and this
one country-wide.  We had 15 commissioners that were prior military,
with prior military experience, all retirees, and five very
distinguished chiefs of police under the leadership of Chief Ramsey,
the former head of the District of Columbia's police department.

And I think that the contribution that the police section of our
commission made to clear understanding of the overall security
situation was one of the main -- one of good contributions of the
entire work that the commission did.  And I'm very grateful to them
for their hard work and the quality of their report.

I'd like to talk about -- just to make sure that in this audience, at
any rate, the difference between internal and external threats is
clearly understood, because we think that the evolution of the Iraqi
security forces, and in particular -- the end state of those -- of
that evolution is roughly what we think in terms of how police are
used and how armies are used.  The police, ultimately, the police
organizations of Iraq, should be able to function in such a way as to
achieve internal security in the country.  And that's clear.  And the
end state for the army is to be able to defend the country against its
external threats.

Now, because of the relative different pace at which both
organizations are progressing, it takes -- it takes the Iraqi security
forces, police and army, to do the first mission, to do the internal
security mission now.  They're doing better.  They can't do it
completely, but they're doing better and they're showing progress.
Ultimately, the Iraqi army will migrate over towards the external
security threat, but this is one where we judge that more attention
needs to be made.

And this gets us to the final chapter that we wrote in the report
that deviated a little bit from our charter, tried to put some context
and some interpretive context, if you will, to what it all means.  And
some of those things I'd like to just go over with you very briefly.

The first conclusion that we had to address the surge -- and we think
the surge -- we consider the surge to be a tactic, not a strategy, but
an important tactic to support a strategy -- it was an influx of
troops, and there's two aspects to the surge.  One is Iraqi that
started in January of 2007, and the other one was the coalition, which
came to full operational capability in May -- May-June of this year.
But together they have made a statistical difference in the amount of
attacks in the region in which they were focused, and you would expect
that with that kind of military effort you're going to get that kind
of reaction.  So we think that that was important because it signaled
the willingness and the ability and the capability of some of the
Iraqi army and some Iraq police forces who actually get in there and
mix it up and be successful.

Second -- the second trend that happened almost simultaneously is the
surge, although I think it was somewhat unrelated with the rather
surprising turnaround in the fortunes of al Qaeda in Al Anbar
province.  As a result of their brutality and their savagery against
locals in the region over the years, not just recently, the population
of Al Anbar province, which is a province about one-third the entire
size of the country, turned -- has turned against al Qaeda and sees al
Qaeda as a true occupier of Iraq and have turned with coalition to
achieve some rather spectacular successes.

We can only hope that this success migrates over to other areas of
Iraq.  My guess is, if it does, it would be to the rural areas where
there's ethnic homogeneity, and -- but it's an encouraging event.
It's statistically very impressive, and it goes to show that some
folks were clearly thinking along those lines.  And they're working
together now; the police forces and the army and the coalition in
Anbar province is yielding on a daily basis good results.

The third element was, as I previously mentioned, was just the
improvement of the Iraqi army itself, and that was something that was
pleasant to note.  And we think that the basic underpinnings that you
want to see in a developing army -- the training, the recruits, the
schools, the NCO academies, a center for counterinsurgency operations,
young officers being trained.  Particularly we visited the NATO
contribution at Ar Rustamiyah.  Those are quality organizations,
quality institutions that are producing the next generation of Iraqi
army officers.  And we can be confident that that's a good product.

So while those three things combined don't necessarily indicate a
strategic trend, it does give the basis for some optimism.  And so we
come back at the end of our report to the major conclusion that it's
the government of Iraq that must commit to reconciliation if it wants
to decrease sectarian violence, which is the main root of all violence
in the country.  The number of fatalities caused by al Qaeda is around
15 percent, to give you a sense of the proportion.

In the last chapter, we -- as I said, we tried to interpret some
trends.  And we believe a couple of things: that we must continue to
put more responsibility wherever possible on the Iraqi government and
increasingly wherever possible and with the right pace of things, and
that's an operational decision, to turn over the internal -- the
responsibility for combating internal violence in Iraq to Iraqis.  The
ISF, the Iraqi security forces, is more capable than it was,
significantly more capable than it was last year.  And we think that
this could be a gradual shift that would allow us to move into areas
that are currently unattended to a certain extent but need to be
looked at.

The government of Iraq has got to be made to feel the international
concern and the pressure.  We would think that a Dayton-like
conference with international authorities, governments and the like
would be something that would be very beneficial to underscore the
absolute criticality of that particular event, the reconciliation, to
take place.

The third thing that we concluded was that a strategic shift of
mission and a realignment of the coalition forces over time, as we
said, starting in early 2008, can be contemplated.  And as a matter of
fact, we were pleased to see that in some areas, it's already being
done, notably in Nasiriyah province, where the Australians have shown
a shift to a strategic overwatch concept that is working
extraordinarily well in cooperation with the Iraqi police and the
Iraqi army in that region.

And lastly -- well, two more things.  The fourth conclusion is that
much more focus needs to be placed on the border in the defense of the
critical infrastructures of the country.  We have to do more to train
the Iraqi border police, to equipping them, to use the technologies
and also, where needed, to use coalition forces to make things more
difficult for two countries in particular, Syria and Iran.

One of the main conclusions of our report was that the rise of
Iranian involvement inside the country -- the destabilizing effect,
the numbers of weapons coming across the border, the resources that
are being committed are going to increasingly have a negative effect
on the recovery of Iraq unless it is addressed, and I think that we
made that point rather relatively forcefully.  Eventually, this will
be a role for the Iraqi army, but the capability is not there yet.
Ultimately, it will be, but it's not going to be 12 to 18 months; it's
going to be some years before they can do that.  But the army is
growing at a reasonably good rate.  They're going to expand by three
more divisions in 2008, so that will give them about 13 divisions.
And these are divisions that are generally able to actually get out
there and do things internally in the country.

The last point I would make is that there is a(n) issue of perception
versus reality in Iraq.  The way I would characterize that, for those
of you who've been there -- I've been privileged to go there several
times a year since 2003 -- but some things don't change.  And what
doesn't change is when you land at Baghdad International Airport and
you get hustled off in a -- into your flak jacket and your helmet and
you duck into your up-armored Humvees and you get your safety brief by
the patrol leader and you race down Route Irish and you make it to the
end zone, you have the feeling that you've just survived a narrow
escape with your Maker.  And then you get out and you get hustled into
the briefing room, and the first briefing tells you how good
everything's going in Iraq.  (Laughter.)  So -- and I don't mean that,
you know, in a -- I just mean that more in a humorous way, but there
is some truth to that.  The perceptions and the realities are
sometimes at odds with each other.

And the Green Zone itself is a statement in and of itself.  The fact
that there has to be one is something that creates a perception that
is troublesome.  The perception of the coalition, Americans in
particular, being occupiers has certainly been one of our major
problems.  It hasn't been helped by the fact that we occupied Saddam
Hussein's palaces after he was toppled in 2003.  One might consider as
you look at your footprint and you look at the mass -- the shear mass
of equipment and personnel that we have, as to whether that is really
the size of the force that we need.  Whether it's a superstructure of
the force or the engine room of the force, to use a naval term,
doesn't matter, but I think we have to do whatever we can to give the
impression that we are an expeditionary force and we are not an
occupying force.  And that message has to go out obviously to Iraqis,
but obviously to people in other capitals as well to make sure that we
get that message loud and clear.

Provincial Iraqi control transfer.  We transferred seven provinces to
Iraq.  Frankly, as we said in our testimony, the methodology for that
system is very hard to understand.  The commission recommended that
all 18 provinces be immediately transferred to sovereign Iraqi
control.  It doesn't -- it will not change our workload one iota, and
it certainly avoids the work that we're trying to do to form a
template that we apply to each province to say:  Before we transfer to
Iraqi control you must be able to meet these criteria.

The difference between Basra and northern Iraq is so different that
there is no template for that.  These are 18 provinces, they're all
different; they all have their different degree of difficulties, and
we see no logic that would argue for any delay.  As a matter of fact,
we think the Iraqis -- the system whereby we transfer the provinces
back to Iraqi control actually delays the recovery of the state.

We suggested transition headquarters to visibly show that we are in
fact interested in transition, and we're tracking it in the broad
sense.  It's not just about the security force.  It's about economic
recovery, legal reform and the whole broad nature of transition.  We
believe it ought to be a physical place.  We called it a headquarters,
but it could be a commission of some sort.  But it ought to be where
people can go to be briefed as to where we are today on transition,
what the plan is for the future and how well we're doing in meeting
those standards.

We also emphasized the fact that standards and metrics are important,
and we just as a cautionary note suggested that our standard for
certification and for turning something over ought not to be a U.S.
standard.  We're not going to recreate the 82nd Airborne Division out
of one of the Iraqi divisions, and that ought not to be the standard.
We ought to make sure that what we do is good enough for what Iraq
needs or the defense of its country, for handling its internal
security.  We ought to have the right set of weapons and the right
capabilities, and not try to superimpose something on them, like a
very complex logistics system, for example, that they will not
probably use and don't have the capacity to use for many years.

So I think I'll stop there, Fred, and look forward to taking any
questions that might have come up.

We enjoyed our work.  It was extremely motivating to see the high
quality of all troops, all coalition troops, and the energy and --
that they bring to their jobs, their very dangerous jobs.  And it also
was very good to see some signs of progress along the lines that I
described to you.

Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

MR. KEMPE:  It's when you -- that's what happens when you try to be
too polite and stand for the general when we start -- General Jones,
thank you so much for that presentation.  I think what you've done is
not only deal and -- explain further the commission report, which was
excellent, well-received, but you also focused a little bit more on
the final chapter of the report, which didn't get a lot of notice in
the press or in commentary.

And so I think in my first couple questions, before I turn it over to
the audience, I want to drill down on a couple of those more strategic
issues, rather than tactical issues.  The -- you talked about giving
more responsibility to the Iraqi government.  I wonder if you can be a
little bit more precise on that, and that is how -- what -- this has
come up so often in the debate lately, but how does one encourage the
Iraqi government to be more effective and responsible, rather than
international pressure?  Can you be more precise on that?

And more to the point, in the event it doesn't make progress at the
legislation we're looking at on national reconciliation by next
summer, what's our Plan B?  What's the shift in policy?

GEN. JONES:  Well, I think that there are some pressure points here
that have to be exerted, because as long as we stay in the ethnic
fight, we're losing young members of the coalition, Americans but also
other nationalities as well, to what's an ethnic contest.  It's --
whether you call it a civil war or whatever, and that fundamentally
doesn't sit well with a lot of people.  And that's understandable.

So I think that what our commission was trying to suggest was that
there are ways in which we can show our commitment to making sure that
Iraq survives as a nation, but increasingly make sure that Iraq and
Iraqi capabilities handle the day-to-day ethnic fight.

And that can start relatively quickly, in my view.  I think General
Petraeus alluded to that in his report.  Now, how he does that, and
what the numbers are, are way beyond our purview as a commission.  But
by adopting a more expeditionary force, you are -- you would be doing
some things that you're going to have to do anyway when the day comes
when you do leave.  And if, for some reason, that day is accelerated
for political reasons, your task is a lot easier at the end of the
day.

So when you look around at the huge size of our footprint, the number
of bases, you look at the -- at just the sheer mass of the presence,
you can pretty quickly come to the conclusion that there are some
things that you can do that would make an eventual departure a lot
easier, and yet still achieve your -- still stay true to your mission,
which is to make sure that Iraqis have a chance to develop a
government and a stable nation that will not be overwhelmed one way or
the other by their neighbors, by two in particular.

MR. KEMPE:  And the other issue I thought that was very interesting,
and again, I don't think has been touched upon and given the credit
and the analysis it deserves, is the idea of a Dayton negotiation of
some sort regarding Iraq.  Again, I wonder if you could flesh that out
a little bit.  Who would participate?  What would be your aim?  When
one speaks of Dayton, one does seem to look at separate Kurdish,
Sunni, Shi'a areas, and perhaps them being a change in the
constitution, perhaps even a more federal structure or at least going
very much in that direction.  Is that what you're talking about in
Dayton, both in terms of who would be there and how it would be
organized, but also what desired outcome one would have?

GEN. JONES:  Well, I really haven't gone into those -- into that
level of detail, but it strikes me that absent something like that,
which we did for Bosnia, we've done for other great problems in the
world, that this is something that would at least be helpful, and
would at least rally the international community around a very serious
problem.  I mean, Iraq is not just a U.S. problem or a U.S. and the
partners that are engaged in it -- it's a -- how it comes out is going
to affect, certainly, the region and the Middle East; it's going to
affect the economies; it's going to affect the flow of energy.

It's -- I mean, there are a lot of -- going to affect how we fight
terrorism in the future, depending on how -- there are a lot of
strategic issues here that call, at least in my opinion, for a more
international focus, whether it's a Dayton-like accord or conference.
You know, I'll leave that up to heads of state and diplomats to figure
that out.

But it seems to me that that would be a good thing to do, if only to
accentuate to the young Iraqi government the absolute requirement that
this has to be done.  Because this is -- there's no magic key here,
but this is as close to one as you could possibly find.  Because only
good things can flow from a political reconciliation and the
subsequent standing down of the militias and reducing the violence.
Because if that's done, then Iraq goes from the sense that many people
have, that it's unmanageable, I think, to a manageable problem
relatively quickly.

MR. KEMPE:  How much do our international friends want to help us in
this?  Do you see that changing?  We are the Atlantic Council.  There
are NATO missions, training and otherwise, in Iraq.  Do you see,
through Dayton or other means, a greater internationalization of the
issue involving our allies?

GEN. JONES:  (Audio break) -- you know, I think so.  You know, NATO
has three missions in Iraq and has been there faithfully for a few
years now.  But NATO contributes to the training of Iraqi officers.
It contributes to the equipping of the Iraqi army and it invites
Iraqis to train on foreign soil, as well, in their schools and
whatever that -- I just gave a speech at the NATO Defense College, and
they were -- (audio break) -- Iraqi officers.  They were graduating
from the NATO Defense College in Rome.  So that kind of thing is
certainly very helpful.

But I just -- as a comment, I just think that there's an absence of
international focus on the seriousness of how this comes out.  And
when you look at the Iranian question, which receives an awful lot of
press, both in Europe and around the world and in the United States,
there are some things going on now that General Petraeus and
Ambassador Crocker pointed out that are absolutely spot-on, and they
have to be confronted.  And it doesn't mean that it has to be
confronted militarily, although you can do so by repositioning some
troops.  I'm not suggesting military strikes or any kind of combat
against Iran.  But the international community has to gather around
this point, in my view, in order to halt the success that Iran is
having, particularly in the South, southeastern part of the country,
which is worrisome.

MR. KEMPE:  The -- well, let's -- let me ask one more question, and
then we'll go to the audience.  And please identify yourselves as you
ask your question.

The -- if you're talking about -- we were talking earlier, and you
talked about September as a critical month.  Because there's so much
debate, because of your report, because of the Petraeus testimony,
because of the Crocker testimony, because of a debate that's going on
in town, that it's a critical month, and that perhaps the United
States and citizens of the United States don't really get what's at
stake here.  This is a situation where this has become a domestic
political debate.  A lot of it does take place in the context of a
presidential campaign.

What is it Americans don't get?  What is it you want them to get?
What change of thinking do you want to happen in September?

GEN. JONES:  I'm not sure that Americans don't get it, but I think
that -- I think that much of the discussion that we have on Iraq --
and, you know, you can see that by some of the questions that were
directed at us and also at Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus --
all focus on the tactics of the moment, with a very short-term view in
terms of a result.  And there are strategic questions here that go
out, you know, a much longer period of time that ought to be
addressed.

And so I pay attention to -- I pay attention to the moment,
obviously; but looking beyond an election and looking beyond the
immediacy of the moment and the latest car bomb, if you will, what are
the strategic issues that are at stake here?  What does it mean for us
nationally to fail or to be perceived to have failed or to succeed or
be perceived to have succeeded?  What does it mean for the region,
which is very important to the rest of the world, and what does it
mean globally?  And I think there are some really very important long-
term questions there that have to be addressed.

MR. KEMPE:  Give us one or two.  In short, what are the most
important two things that need -- is it Iran and the rise of Iran?  Is
it --

GEN. JONES:  I think at the strategic level, the biggest problems are
the challenges that Iran places and faces.  I mean, Iran is clearly
trying to subvert the recovery of Iraq, and they're doing it by
committing many resources, a lot of training, a lot of equipment, and
high-tech weapons that are built to defeat our -- defeat our armor and
defeat our forces.  They are engaged in trying to dominate the
southern part of the country, and as a result of that, you are seeing
a fractured Shi'a community with more Shi'a-on-Shi'a fighting now than
before, and a growing influence over the Jaish al-Mahdi and the
militant portion of that particular militant group.

So, what are the strategic imperatives of that happening?  What is it
that happens if Iraq fails as a state and devolves into chaos?  What
does that mean for the region, what does it mean for the globe, what
are the economic repercussions?  And nationally, what does it mean for
the United States?  I mean, what is it that we're going to be
perceived to be 10 or 15 years from now?

Where I think most Americans want to be a nation of great influence
and want to have a dominant voice in the affairs of the globe, having
a failure in Iraq -- or Afghanistan, by the way -- and let me quickly
add that I think Afghanistan deserves to be mentioned in the same
breath every time we mention Iraq because of the strategic
consequences there -- but at the very least you're going to have, if
we're perceived to have failed, you're going to have a massive
increase in the number of jihadists around the world, and it's going
to spread.

I'm not saying it comes automatically to our shores or whatever, but
it is a common problem that we all will face, and you can just see
that on a daily basis by reading the newspapers and how widespread
these networks are, how well resourced they are and what they are.
And this is -- these are two places right now, in Iraq and
Afghanistan, where the rest of the world can take a position, and if
we're successful collectively that would be good.  If we are not, it
will certainly be a bad thing for our children and maybe even our
grandchildren.

MR. KEMPE:  Let me give the former Defense minister of Italy the
first question.

Q     Yes, General Jones.  I'd like to ask you a question and then
explain why I asked the question.

Is it more difficult to train soldiers than to train policemen?
Because as you know, we sent 3,000 military to Nasiriyah; 2,700 were
from the army mostly, but also navy and air force; and only 300 from
the Carabinieri.  Yet the Carabinieri trained 11,000 policemen, and
the army only trained 2,000 soldiers.  Is it more difficult to train
soldiers than to train policemen?

GEN. JONES:  Mr. Minister, I think it depends on the -- what capacity
you're meeting up against.  In Iraq, the situation is that the
Ministry of Defense and its ability to administer the armed forces is
vastly ahead of the Ministry of the Interior and its ability to
administer to the police networks of the nation.  And the differences
between the two are like night and day.

I suspect that -- at least one of the things we observed in the
Ministry of the Interior, aside from the fact that it's overtly
sectarian, that it is -- that there's allegations of corruption and
bureaucratic inefficiency, where even if they have equipment like fuel
and ammunition and weapons and vehicles, that the system is so --
works so poorly that it doesn't get down to the units.  That's a
national problem.  But you know, comparing apples to apples, if you
have the right number of trainers, it should be -- even though it's
different, I think what you want in the police force is a police force
that understands that, above all, you shouldn't do anything that's bad
for the people.

And so there might be some more difficult challenges to get that
process identified, at least in the culture of the police forces,
particularly given their experiences under Saddam Hussein.  So that
may be a little bit harder to do.

But in the main, if all systems are equal, we should be able to do
both.  But I think the flaw in the system is the -- just the
ineffectiveness of the governmental chain.

Thank you for that question.

Q     A very quick follow-up.  General Keane at American Enterprise
Institute last week said in a counterinsurgency, this is the last
thing that gets fixed, the police.  But as you look at that, you have
called to take it apart, restart.  You stand by that in the commission
report.  Is that the way to go?

GEN. JONES:  Well, the police network in Iraq is much broader than
just the national police.  And I know that people who didn't take the
time to read the report keyed on that as saying we recommended
disbanding the entire national police, meaning all of them -- not
true.  The national police is a 25,000-man police that is -- exists at
the national level.  They generally report to the minister of the
Interior and therefore pretty directly to the prime minister.

Unfortunately, this national police is very sectarian.  They're about
85 percent Shi'a in their makeup.  They are universally distrusted and
disliked.  They are associated with some fairly bad things with regard
to human rights and abuses of human rights.  And our chiefs felt very
strongly that that unit ought to be re-missioned and brought down to
something that is more useful to what they need -- response teams,
emergency response teams, SWAT teams and the like, but not any kind of
representation of a -- I'll -- these are my words -- that -- a type of
republican guard that some of us are worried about as being formed.

MR. KEMPE:  I see, I see.  Well, actually, now a lot of questions,
but I saw three, so I'll go to the first three.  One, two and, you,
three.  Please.  Yes.

Q     I am Doug Brooks with the International Peace Operations
Association.  My question is -- you know, even if we stay, it's no
guarantee of success; if we depart, it's no guarantee of failure, but
if things do go south, what is your perspective on the asylum issue?
We have a lot of Iraqis who have worked with our military now, with
our contractors -- I mean, we're talking about thousands and thousands
of people.  You know, what is your take on --

GEN. JONES:  Yeah, well, a little bit outside the commission's lane,
but my personal response is we have to pay -- we would have to pay
very serious attention to that and not duplicate some of the -- or
replicate some of the tragedies of the past.  I mean, you have to --
I'm reasonably sure that people have thought about that already.  And
this is -- this goes part and parcel as to why I think we can adjust
our forces at our -- based on our timeline, in ways that should we
have to make a -- should a political decision be made at some point
that it is time to leave -- maybe it's because of a good thing or a
bad thing -- that we can do so fairly efficiently.  And that's
certainly a key part of it.

Q     General, thank you.  Jeff Steinberg from Executive Intelligence
Review.

Based on your travels around the country, to what extent do you see
the situation as already to a very large extent ethnically cleansed?
And do you see, looking down the road, the dangers of an emerging
Sunni versus Shi'ite conflict as the consequence of some of these
faultlines developing in Iraq?

GEN. JONES:  Well, I grew up kind of in the junior ranks of the
general officers in Bosnia so I had a first -- front row seat on the
subject of ethnic cleansing.  And I wouldn't sit here and tell you
that there hasn't been any of that in Iraq.  There clearly has -- some
of it obviously forcible, but some of it simply because families said,
we can't live here and we're leaving.

So that's unfortunately a fact of life in ethnic conflicts.  You
would wish that it wouldn't be, but it is what it is.  With regard to
ethnic clash between Sunnis and Shi'as, this is obviously the crux of
the problem.

It's interesting to note that in the Iraqi army, we went over there
with the idea that ethnicity was going to be a problem in the armed
forces.  And if you look at the construct of the 10 divisions that
they have right now and the balance between Kurds and Shi'as and
Sunnis and who commands the divisions and the makeup of the divisions,
compared to the ministry of the interior and the police forces,
ethnicity is not as big a problem in the army.  And that was -- that's
a good thing.  But it has to do, I think, with the quality of training
they're getting at the entry level.

We were very pleasantly surprised to see thousands -- thousands -- of
young Iraqis waiting each day to try to be selected to join the army
and, by the way, the police forces as well.  They are being paid.  The
army is being paid at a more consistent rate than the police forces
are, which speaks a little bit to the either sectarianism or the
dysfunction of the Ministry of the Interior.

But this is something that young Iraqis are lining up to do, and
talking to a number of a trainers and talking to the advisers that are
embedded with Iraqi units, who see these -- see them firsthand and
observe them firsthand, the results are -- at least on the army side,
are pretty good.

The Iraqi special forces are judged by our trainers, by U.S.
standards, to be the equal of any special forces in the Persian Gulf
region today.  So that's kind of a compliment.

But I did want to make distinction that ethnicity in the Iraqi armed
forces seems to be not as a big a problem as it is in the police
network.

MR. KEMPE:  Mr. Coe.  Please.

Q     (Without microphone.)  Do you have any idea --

MR. KEMPE:  No -- here we go.  Sorry.

Q     (With microphone.)  Do you have any idea how much overlap there
is between today's Iraqi army and Saddam's army?

GEN. JONES:  I think it's -- following the decisions of the CPA to
essentially dismember the army after the military defeat, and then the
reversal of that to rebuild it, but also vet the more senior officers
that came in, that there's -- there are quite a few people who in the
course of our interviews with them said, &quot;I used to be, I used to
serve, I was,&quot; and associated their previous experience -- the
minister of Defense was a young general in Saddam Hussein's army, if I
recall correctly.  And -- but he's doing just fine at what he's
doing.  He seems -- he's got a strategic vision.  He wants to do
more.  He's running a ministry, I think, that is representative of the
armed forces that he's trying to create.  They can't do everything,
but they're doing better.

Q     Thank you.  I am Bob Pearson, General.  I was ambassador in
Turkey, 2000 to 2003.

GEN. JONES:  I remember you, Mr. Ambassador.

Q     And I thank you for your support in a challenging time.

GEN. JONES:  Thank you.

Q     I wanted to tie together three things you said:  the
expeditionary force, the standards and metrics, and the Dayton
accords, and just pose the question of what success means, because if
the end result is that we have a stable Iraq capable of standing up to
its neighbors, the democratic composition inside the country may not
be the kind of perfect picture --

GEN. JONES:  Right.

Q     -- that many people may be assuming.  And so I think that I
would simply suggest that maybe part of our dialogue tried to begin to
focus on what we mean by success because we will have to explain that
to the American people when we do eventually come out.

Thank you, sir.

GEN. JONES:  I think that your statement stands for itself.  I
completely agree with it.

Q     Define success.  What does it look like?

GEN. JONES:  Well, I -- you know, I think that you have various
levels you get to, and the most critical thing that has to happen in
Iraq right now is stop the inter-ethnic violence, and when you do
that, that's a measure of success.  Now it's not the end state, but it
is -- at least will get us into the -- where the -- I like the analogy
of when you get into these conflicts the first part of the conflict
always has a big m for military and a little p for political.  And
over time as you're doing things right it goes the other way, and
that's what happened in Bosnia.  You want that big political -- big p
for political and then gradually reduce the military, but there are
some interim steps of success that you have to achieve before you get
to that situation.

But I think the ambassador is correct, that ultimately -- whenever
that day is, ultimately Iraqis will probably decide for themselves
what kind of government they want to have, and we'll make that
change.  And all we can hope is that we've done a good job and set
good models, good role models and tried to influence them in the right
way so it comes out okay.

Q     (Name inaudible) -- U.S. correspondent of -- (affiliation
inaudible).

GEN. JONES:  Yes.

Q     I would like to follow up on the political implication of all
those reports.  They might differ in the degree of success or failure,
but there are two tendencies in all the reports.  The success is on
the military side; the failure is on the political side.  And if you
don't name sides, but persons, and the success is with the Americans,
the failure with the Iraqis, which is politically a little bit
dangerous because it leads to the implication maybe they don't deserve
all the sacrifices -- well, in human beings and in dollars.

So is this an appropriate description of the situation?  Is it maybe
fair, but political not correct?  And would you agree or is it
dangerous?  What are your thoughts on that?  Is that a fair
description or is it a little big dangerous description?

GEN. JONES:  Well, if I understand your question correctly, I mean, I
guess my reaction would be that we're really comparing apples and
oranges here.  We're -- what I think we're trying to do is stimulate a
political -- at least in the short term, a political settlement, a way
in which we can get very different factions who don't like each other
very much to come to the table and understand that, you know, for the
good of the nation, you have to come together.  You can't go on like
this.

And obviously it's very hard.  Ambassador Crocker, General Petraeus
work on this every single day, and it's difficult work.  It was
difficult work in Bosnia, as well.  But at the end of the day, there
was a solution and -- but it took some time.  And anyone who gets into
this kind of business thinking less than generational in terms of
total change is miscalculating.  The evidence is clear and the
historical evidence is -- supports that thesis.

So I don't think it's a question of whether we're right politically
and the government is wrong.  There are many fine people in that
government.  I've known President Talabani for a long time.  He is an
Iraqi and he's Kurdish but he's an Iraqi.  I've had others who've gone
out of their way in the last -- during our visits to say -- to
reaffirm the fact that they are Iraqis first.  The minister of defense
goes way out of his way to say that, and frankly I think he can back
it up.

And so if you get that kind of mentality in the government, then it's
not a we/they type issue.  But if they don't do it, then it's fair to
ask yourself ultimately whether your sacrifice is worth it.  And I
think injecting -- you know, generally speaking, trying to fight in
somebody else's civil war is a tough proposition.  Because generally
they all turn on you first and then they turn on themselves.

That's not always the case, but that's one of the reasons we added a
constable, assistant chief constable from Northern Ireland, to our
police delegation.  And his wisdom as a result of years and years in
Northern Ireland was very, very illuminating.  I mean, he said things
that we never would have thought of, because we haven't gone through
that, that he was thinking of, and equating it and drawing parallels
to where the Iraqis were in their life cycle development.

So I don't think it's a we/they thing.  I think it's all of us, and I
think we have to help this government find its way to do the right
thing.  And when I say we, I don't mean the United States.  I say we,
the world community, because we all have stakes in making sure this
comes out the right way.

MR. KEMPE:  We have time just for a couple of more questions.  Oh,
I'm sorry, I didn't see.  Here and then here, please.  And let's take
both of these questions and then come back.

Q     General, Bill Jones from EIR News Service.  There was discussed
in the Baker-Hamilton proposal the possibility of having a regional
conference in which you could bring the countries of the region
together to bring it to bear on the situation in Iraq.  And obviously,
there have been problems especially with Iran but also with Syria.
But it seems to me that that also should play something of a role, and
I was wondering, how do you view the feasibility and possibility of
getting these countries together and placing an emphasis on that.

And secondly, this would also involve a greater international
involvement.  Even the U.N., I think, has indicated that they want to
get involved in Iraq.  And if the international community played a
greater role, would this be a possibility of bringing down the
American footprint, and maybe even the thought of, if necessary, some
kind of a multilateral force under -- peacekeeping force under U.N.
supervision, where European nations would be more willing to work than
they would under present conditions?

MR. KEMPE:  Let me take one or two more questions and then come back
to --

GEN. JONES:  Let me deal with this one real quick.

MR. KEMPE:  Do you want to deal with that?

GEN. JONES:  Let's do that.  Thank you.

I think that anything that could be done politically would be a plus,
whether it's regional, whether it's global, whether the U.N. plays in
it.  I mean, we've got to do -- we've got to do anything we can to
accelerate towards getting to the time where we replace that little
&quot;p&quot; with a big &quot;P&quot; in the solution set.

With regard to U.N. peacekeping forces -- I'll say this most
respectfully, having been in a number of of these things -- that if
you can guarantee a Chapter VI environment, then I would say fine, but
if it's Chapter VII, I would not do it until you get down to Chapter
VI, because the odds of success are not good with regard to U.N.
peacekeping forces.

Q     The difference between peacekeping and peacemaking.

GEN. JONES:  Exactly, yeah.  There's a big difference.

(Arnaud ?).

Q     General, with your reference to Iran, they have a common
border, I believe, of about 900 miles.

GEN. JONES:  (To staff)  Sara (sp), could I have that chart on Iran,
please?  Go ahead, (Arnaud ?).

Q     I'm not quite sure I understand what the incentive to Iran
would be to reach some kind of a modus vivendi with the United
States.  They have four of the world's eight nuclear powers in their
region.  They have 50,000 allegedly hostile troops on their right
flank and about 150,000 or 160,000 on their left flank, and they have
the U.S. fleet at their rear.  Surely it would be to our advantage to
sit down and try to work out a geopolitical deal with Iran; otherwise,
I don't quite see what the interest would be for Iran to make our life
more comfortable.

GEN. JONES:  I would certainly not be comfortable sitting here and
even suggesting that I am an expert on Iranian mindsets.  My only
reason for mentioning it is because I am convinced that on their
current path, they are delaying the recovery of Iraq, and so that's
what I'm addressing.  But certainly, beyond that, your question is
very valid.  I'm just not qualified to enter into that analysis.  But
I am absolutely convinced that where Iraq is concerned, what Iran is
doing is not helpful, and to the contrary, it's very hurtful.

MR. KEMPE:  We have one last question from General Scowcroft.  I have
to apologize.  I know people have been raising their hands, and we've
just run out of time, and I'm really sorry we didn't get around to
everyone, which just shows how many questions are burning on these
issues.

Q     Okay.  Thank you, Fred.  General, there have been some comments
that in some of the things we're doing, we're building in future
problems.  And one of those most frequently raised is the issue of
Anbar province and the aid we're giving to Sunni tribes and so on and
so forth, and that that goes directly contrary to what Maliki is
trying to do, and that we are building in divisions rather than
bringing them together.

GEN. JONES:  Was that a statement?  (Laughs, laughter.)  There's no
question that when you deal with a complex situation like an
insurgency, certainly one that's multifaceted, that to be successful,
sometimes you have to make compromises and you have to make on-the-
field adjustments to achieve successes where you can get a success and
hope that leads to yet another success.

I think that we've done the right thing in Anbar province.  I think
it's incumbent on the government to increasingly show that it's a
government for all Iraqis and not just the majority that happens to be
in power.  I realize that there's a lot of historical baggage with
that concept in Iraq, but this is clearly what has to be done.

And one other thing that impressed us wherever we went -- north,
south, east and west -- was the fact that young Iraqis have this --
seem to have this idea of one Iraq as a nation, and they want to see
it become a nation.  And we've only been at this four and five years
-- and I know for some, that's too long already -- but I come back
onto the point that if you're trying to change a society, if you're
trying to change culture, if you're trying to change years and years
of frustrated, bottled-up tensions, it's not going to happen
overnight.  And I think the best thing that this new government can do
is to try to show the people that it is a government for all Iraqis,
that the assets and the help are being distributed fairly and
equitably, that people who are in law enforcement or in the military
or in the service of the government are being paid, that corruption is
being battled and that they are reaching out to all sectors.

My feeling is that at the senior levels, regardless of whether
they're Shi'a, Sunni or Kurds, they know this.  And so the question
is, how do you get the tribes to work together?

And you know, there are a lot of parallels.  I mean, I go back to my
own experience in Bosnia.  I mean, it was, you know, we were there
during the worst of times, of Sniper Alley, which was -- probably more
risky to drive down Sniper Alley in Sarajevo than going from Baghdad
International to the Green Zone.  And it did -- but it did come to an
end, and they did find the way -- they did find the path.  And we can
only hope that the Iraqis, with our help, our collective help -- I
mean the help of all nations and international organizations -- will
do the same thing.

Fred, thank you.

MR. KEMPE:  Thank you very much.  It seems, to sum up -- and tell me
if this reads you wrong -- but you're telling us that we have to stay
engaged because the costs are too great not to, but we have to get
smarter; that in a way, you are saying the public debate has to shift
here from tactics to strategy.  And one of the things you really seem
to be pushing is for that to go in that direction.  And even as one
does that, one's talking perhaps a little bit less of withdrawal and
surges, and a little bit more about strategically repositioning what
we've got there for that end.  Is that --

GEN. JONES:  Yeah, I think so.  I think we have a lot -- there is a
lot of leverage there, obviously, but it doesn't always have to be
deadlines.  You can just act, and by your act, you can signal what
your intent is.

MR. KEMPE:  Yeah.

GEN. JONES:  So I hope that the current progress that we've seen
continues.  I hope that it goes over into the other ministry that
we've been very hard on.  And I really have some good people in that
ministry that are working hard, but you've got to call it straight.
It's a dysfunctional ministry, and it's affecting the internal
stability and security of the country.  And the external threats, I
think, have to be addressed.  And there's a way, I think, over time,
where the coalition can disengage from the inter-ethnic violence and
reposition itself in different forces structures and all of that that
goes with it, coupled with a lighter footprint that can make it much
more effective and much more efficient and much more acceptable to our
publics, because it is a huge cost in terms of human lives and
resources.  And they have a right to say -- and we want to see -- we
want them -- we want success here.  We want to see that it's working.

I do think we have a good team over there.  I think General Petraeus
and Ambassador Crocker are two of the very best representatives that
we could have, and I think their -- the people that they have working
for them are also highly professional and dedicated, and if we can't
succeed with this team, we're not going to succeed with any other one,
I'm sure.

MR. KEMPE:  Thank you very much.

GEN. JONES:  Thank you.

MR. KEMPE:  Before we give you your well-deserved round of applause,
let me just thank, first of all, our board member David Aufhauser,
general counsel of UBS, for making this whole series possible.  And
it's been a terrific series with Nick Burns and Jan Eliasson, the
special ambassador to Darfur at the U.N.  And we've had a great series
of speakers -- Bob Kimmitt, the number two at the Treasury.  And we're
focusing on global issues.  This is clearly a global issue Atlantic
Council has to focus on.

Thanks to Ambassador Catto, chairman emeritus, who has been a hero
here at the Atlantic Council for the last eight years, for introducing
the session.  General Scowcroft, our international advisory board
member, and it's great to have you onboard as chairman of the Atlantic
Council.  Thank you so much for not only touching on your report but
really going beyond it and putting together the tactical and the
strategic in a way that I hope our leaders and regional leaders will
do as well.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)
