Question
Kevin, PEASE gimme hope and say that this is atleast a possibility.....

Norv is BORING and non motivating....even his postgame confernces put me tu
sleep. And Cotrell just plain SUCKS.....PLEASE tell me its possible to bring
marty back (hes still under contract,) and also to promote Ron Rivera to
DCoordinator. The players would LEAP for joy, and so would the fans.....is
it at all possible. I MISS MARTY!!! and so do these players!

John  /  San Diego

Answer

John, John, wake up. You're dreaming.

As for hope, well, I still like this team. Not playing well against good
teams is the problem.

Question
OK Last time I checked in with you made a crack about Las Cruces being
remote. And that would be right! We have traffic here but nothing like the
San Diego freeway. But you also commented that Las Cruces is in eastern New
Mexico. It isn't-we are in the west. Eastern New Mexicois like Texas-and
we'll leave it at that. But I have been a Charger fan since Fouts, Jefferson
and those days.
So, anyway my question;
What in your opinion is the first thing the Chargers can do to change their
fortunes around in this young season? And are they really in trouble like I
am hearing?
David in western New Mexico
P.S. Years ago San Diego used to be in Dona Ana County-same as Las Cruces.

David Pierre  /  Las Cruces

Answer

Trouble? Yes. But destiny is still in their hands, and they are capable of
cleaning up a few things and turning it around.

These coaches are not the dolts that so many are saying.

As for Las Cruces, so I was not entirely accurate. But I wouldn't say west.
I'd say south central. I used to fly into El Paso to get to Las Cruces back
when I covered college football and basketball.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
Hey Kevin, what is your take on the offensive line and defensive front
seven. On both sides of the ball, the line is losing the battle, which in my
mind is the problem with both our running game and pass coverage.. Is it
that the O-line is overwhelmed with 8 man fronts and still forcing the ball?
or that we haven't established a passing game (until yesterday)? or are
these guys not playing as hard/ good as last year? Nothing is wrong with LT
in my mind, just nowhere to go. The D-line is getting little to no
penetration, and while the D-backs have had some breakdowns, look like they
have better coverage this year than last. It appears less blitzing /
creativity on defense, and total lack of preparation and game time
adjustments What is your take? Coaching? Intensity? Preparation? Edge?

Scott Denson  /  San Diego native/ NC

Answer

Scott, really good points.

The offensive line has not been good as a whole. I will wait to call out
certain guys until after I watch the tape tomorrow. In the first two games,
the interior guys played well but the tackles did not.

You can run against an eight-man front. You can. LT faced some last year.
But you have to hold blocks.

How to judge the D Line? Interesting. They got to Grossman. they essentially
had no time to get to Brady. And Favre is a master at eluding pressure, and
his line is playing well. That said, they have not been good. I am extremely
baffled by the front seven.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
Would you trade for Quentin Jammer for 2 hot dogs (no mustard) a video tape
of Bill Belicheck recording the Chiefs signals 4 years ago and a kick in the
ankle? Is LT whining?

Marc  /  Hudson

Answer

Wrong day to pick on Jammer. He was good Sunday.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
Kevin, I'm very interested to hear your take on today's game. It was
heart-breaking for this longtime Chargers' fan. Your mailbag responses are
often quite a bit more revealing than your articles can be. No question
here, just waiting.

Robin  /  Birmingham, AL

Answer

Waiting for me? That's nice.

I thought the defensive plan was mostly good. Sure, there is some confusion
and I am waiting (ever-so-patiently) to make a judgment on Ted Cottrell. The
problem was the execution. Missed tackles, not enough pressure.

On offense, they did some really good things -- just not enough of them.
Rivers was fantastic -- until the fourth quarter. Weird. Unlike last year.

Favre was awesome. The Packers defense is pretty good.

The Chargers played their best game of the season.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
It was great that the Chargers players finally showed up today. However,
today was somewhat reminiscent of a couple losses last year. At Baltimore,
playcalling was completely predictable in running in obvious situations,
forcing the run and dared to pass. In the playoff game, LT was very
successful in the first half, but the 2nd half they went away from what was
working for them. Today was similar to both... After again unsuccessfully
forcing obvious running plays with 8 man fronts blitzing the gaps, Rivers
gets on fire, finding all kind of openings in the passing game. He is
spectacular, setting a consecutive completion record for the chargers 15/15,
the recievers are part of the offense for the first time this year. After
the best call all season (the swing pass to LT for the TD in the 3rd
quarter), Norv starts forcing the ball on the ground again and getting
conservative to protect a small lead. Run on 1st and 2nd down against
obvious run defenses, leaving 3rd and long, and pass in obvious situations.
GB's game plan was simple, stack the box, blitz, stop LT on the ground...
Memo to Norv -- look at what got the Chargers 14-2 last year, being
UNPREDICTABLE!!! After Bmore last year, the chargers opened up the passing
game, started games passing on 1st down, and forced defenses to guess, and
the majority of LT's touchdowns last year were after they opened up the
passing game. Why abandon what is working? Continuity means doing what
worked last year -- UNPREDICTABILITY!Get a couple touchdown lead, and then
maybe start pounding the ball. After 3 games, it is clear that our new head
coach/ offensive coordinator is completely predictable. The defense is
pretty predictable as well -- not a lot of imagination or adjustments on
either side of the ball. After 3 games, the Chargers are 2 games down from
Denver. Oh yeah, lets not forget all the penalties! Great job Norv on
preparation and playcalling -- again!

Scott Denson  /  San Diego/ Charlotte NC

Answer

They're one game behind Denver.

Does anyone here think the Chargers didn't face eight-man fronts last year?
People, this is an offensive line thing.

The Chargers can't be a gadget offense. Yes, they probabl

Question
FIRE NOVR TURNER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YESTERDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!! TEAM IS
FUSTRATED ALREADY.....AND THE COACH DOSEN'T CARE IF HE WINS OR LOSES....IT'S
OBVIOUS BY THE WAY HE ACTS ON THE SIDELINES NO EMOTION......SAVE LT AND THE
CHARGERS......OPPORTUNITY ONLY COMES AROUND ONLY SO OFTEN!!!

DAVID  /  LAS VEGAS

Answer

So he isn't Marty (i.e., theatrical).

He cares.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
A) Donnie Edwards is no longer on this team. B) The chargers can't stop
anyone from catching passes across the middle or, worse yet, reeling of long
runs after they catch them. Coincidence? Not hardly. For all those Edwards
haters from last year (including apparently our GM) the reason the guy made
most of his tackles 5 yards deep is cuz that's where pass coverage guys are
supposed to make them.

Richard Spahl  /  San diago

Answer

You're right about Donnie.

It was always a danger he would be missed.

But, remember, Wilhelm has been hurt. That can't be held against anyone.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
Has any team replaced a General Manager and a coaching staff after week
three? If so who do you suggest. I think Bill Cower is the right guy. I like
his fire. Which is what we are missing this year. Norv Turner DOES NOT
BELONG in the N.F.L.

Carey  /  San Diego/ Boise ID

Answer

You think it's fire they're missing.

I think it's opposing receivers they're missing after those receivers make
catches.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
Can we get the ball to Vincent Jackson More??We have a new star on this
team and we dont even know how to use him!

rich trickle  /  murphy canyon

Answer

He caught six passes yesterday.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
Was Marty or the Ghost of Marty calling the plays on the drive before the
two minute warning? Two predictable runs up the middle then keeping our best
receiver in to block with LT so we could throw one high and away to Jackson?
We carved them up with the pass the whole game but as soon as we got a lead
we went right into the conservative game of past years. Will it ever end?

How come our defense for years has never been able to stop the slant or
short passes? Our DB's are all exceptionally average cover guys who never
seem to make a big play when it counts. Can we just call a &quot; do over&quot; and
get Wade and Cam back?

Bryan Wiedeman  /  San Clemente

Answer

No do overs. But thanks for asking, because this gives me a chance to
restate my criticism of how February was handled.

I think the mistake AJ and Dean made was in not anticipating Cam and Wade
were going to be gone when they decided to keep Marty.

But it's over, folks.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
Is Philip Rivers the new Rex Grossman?He's not the answer,thats why LT
blasted him on the sideline!He only locks on to one receiver,is affraid to
leave the pocket and can't read defenses! Phillip Rivers your not all the
blame, when the defenses know your gonna run on 1st and second downs then
throw on third, it makes it just a little harder to open up the offense!

Mike Hawk  /  Poway

Answer

I wouldn't say he's afraid to leave the pocket. I'd say he is not good
outside the pocket.

Yes, Rivers has some improving to do.

He is not Rex Grossman. That's just silly, Mike.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
I don't have a question. I have a satement.

It was good to see that Merriman actually touched Favre when at the end of
the game he shook his hand.

Anytime LT is going to argue on the sideline wiht P. Rivers and I don't know
what they are talking about,, I am ON LT' S side. Looks like I was right.
Upon further review, LT was wide open.

Memo to Turner, did you NOT see last years game film where we used Turner
the Burner to wear down the line. Look, I send my horses into the field to
plow and my thoroughbreads into run.... WHAT A JOKE..

I think I will cancel my plans to Glendale. Let's all jut get back to work
and take it one play at a time.. AND YOU A.J., maybe it should be one speed
dial at a time.. HELLO MARTY????

Roni Aguilar  /  San Diego

Answer

I don't have an answer then.

Kevin Acee

Question
Well lets see, fire Marty, Let Donnie go, Let Wade go, Let Cam go, Hire
Norv......WOW San Diego, who is calling the shots???? Oh, A.J. Smith...aka
&quot;The Tirant&quot; When are you gonna realize that HE is the problem. Im sure Drew
Brees is lauphing in New Orleans at his replacement, the AFC &quot;Rex
Grossman&quot;..aka Philip Rivers..What a joke. Super Bowl, not a chance,
Playoffs, not a chance, winning 5 games.....POSSIBLE. See ya San Diego, the
shoe has fell off.

Dorian  /  San Diego

Answer

Philip Rivers' passer rating yesterday was 116.2

He blew a couple throws in the fourth quarter. That means he has to do
better. It does not mean he is Rex Grossman.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
As a long time season ticket holder and a fan now from 1500 miles away, I'm
ashamed of this team. What a waste of talent this year. If not for the Bears
being a dismal offensive team, the Chargers would be 0-3 to start the year.
The NE game was an embarrassment and now this loss to an old Green Bay team.
Shame on the Chargers for wasting last year. shame on them for mailing it in
this year, and shame on Chargers management for the overall pathetic
performance. New stadium at taxpayers and ticket holders expense? Are you
kidding me?

Paul  /  Ohio

Answer

I know why you're calling the Packers old -- driver, favre, the two CBs. But
they are actually the youngest team in the league.

yes, bad start. key word: start.

Question
Are we running the triangle offense??!st down=run to LT, sencond down-=run
to LT ,third down=pass to gates! so predictable!! (the things that make you
go hmmm??

Bart Gingles  /  Pacific Beach

Answer

That made me laugh.

But, really, save for a 57-yard catch-and-run that was Antonio Cromartie's
fault, the Chargers outgained the Packers.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
That is why the chargers cannot call themselves superbowl material. They
are a soft football team. And their coach is no better than marty. He sat on
the ball with a 4 point lead in the 4th quarter.

Talk is cheap  /  Diego

Answer

Soft? Why do you say that? Because they lost?

I agree they could have been a little more aggressive -- maybe with a pass
or two. But they were trying to run out the clock. And I don't know too many
coaches who would have passed on first down at their own 1 or own 11.

TED COTTREL NEED'S TO BE FIRED! THIS DEFENCE DON'T EVEN LOOK LIKE LAST YEAR

BRANDEE JENSEN  /  SO JORDAN UT

Answer

Brandee, you are on the cutting edge of panic.

I haven't watched it again yet, but I think that was for the most part a
decent defensive scheme on Sunday. It was poor execution.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
AJ Smith is a best on picking draft picks than at managing the Cahrgers.
Trading Cleo Lemon just before you play the Dolphins was a mistake,
suspending Gates for one game was a mistake...both games were losses for the
Chargers. Marty did not orchestrate his firing it was AJ...AJ did not let
the head coach hire his assistants something all good head coaches are
allowed to do and Marty was a good head coach,

paul  /  del mar

Answer

I understand where you are coming from, but ...

AJ absolutely did let Marty hire his own assistants. But Marty knew Dean
Spanos did not like coaches hiring family. He tried to hire his brother
anyway. It was the last straw.

We've reported that. I didn't make it up. If you don't want to believe it,
oh well.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
Kevin,

I know the Chargers receivers can catch the ball in stride (Gates is the
only one to do it consistently, and Vincent Jackson caught one Willie Mays
style in Seattle last season), but I haven't seen it this year. It seems
that the receivers seem content this season to curl in on their routes
(facing the QB) catch the ball, and then try to spin out of a crouching
stance for additional yards after the catch, which doesn't seem to amount to
much. A receiver catching the ball in stride is close to indefensible (i.e.
Randy Moss). Is this by playbook design, or is it more likely an attempt to
steady River's play by giving him a stationary target?

John  /  San Diego

Answer

It's the playbook.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
Is it just me or does anyone else out there think that plays to Lo Neal are
a waste of a down? Yes, I could complain about a billion other things but
the next time I see them give the ball to Lo or throw a pass his way, I'm
going to go nuts! Let him block for LT and that's it.. Your thoughts?

Samikesd  /  escondido

Answer

a lot of times that is a checkdown. philip rivers and norv turner don't use
a lot of gray matter thinking about getting lorenzo neal the ball. but
sometimes, too, you do have to mix it up.

if every play could get eight yards ...

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
It would seem that the coaching staff has had an adverse effect on the
field performance of the personnel. I am asking because the &quot;fire&quot; is just
not there like it was last year. Last year, after the second game, the team
always went on the attack, even on defense. This year, the first three games
reflect a more pedestrian approach to the game. Turner has never shown any
inclination to motivate, but relies on a players internal motivation.
Cottell's approach seems to reflect the same approach with more of a
&quot;rocking chair&quot; approach to defense. (ie, sit back and wait) Would you agree
or disagree that the team has lost the &quot;fire&quot; needed to win at this level&gt;

david  /  mcdaniel

Answer

I do not agree they have lost the fire.

They are 1-2. Yesterday was a better game. Much better.

They are attacking on defense. They are simply not tackling very well, and
they have played some good offensive lines and maybe they haven't been put
in the right position all the time.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
well, here we are 1-2 and the nay sayers and bandwagon fans are jumping
ship and calling for the beheading of all coaches and clearing the front
office of everyone but the receptionist. obviously this is not where the
team and fans wanted to be after three games but for God's sake, there are
14 weeks of the season left, let's wait until the bye week and see where we
are before everyone goes into full blown panic mode.

As for the team, i know that after a loss or two there tends to be some
finger pointing, but in talking to the players is there a sense that the
play calling on both sides of the ball needs to improve? or are the players
taking resposibility for their performance? also, you wrote last week that
&quot;this thing reeks of 2005&quot; and as much as I don't want to believe it, I have
that same sense as well. as the insider of all insiders, i need you to tell
the true Chargers fans that this team has the ability and desire to not let
a repeat of 2005 to happen.

Brad  /  La Mesa

Answer

I still believe they have the ledership (and talent) to not repeat 2005.

Those of you prone to the kneejerk reaction might think this is a copout,
but we have to wait until the bye week to assess this thing (and we still
won't know for sure, will we?)

at the bye they will have played every AFC West team and be six games into
the season. They will be 1-5, 2-4, 3-3 or 4-2.

They played a lot better yesterday. A lot better.

Players are mostly being mute about the playcalling. Sure, they can
second-guess some calls on defense especially. But they say they need to
play better. I think they need to play better.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
Hi Kevin,

First, I didn't seem to make too much out of LT and Rivers' &quot;conversation&quot;
on the sideline. Is there anything to be concerned about there?

Also, with all due respect to Tim Sullivan's report card, I thought the
secondary actually played pretty well. Yes, there was the long touchdown and
McCree's tackling was Pop Warner-esque, but Favre had an incredible game.
The secondary showed improvement over last week, but it looks to me like the
problem is lack of pressure. Favre had all day, and you just can't give him
that much time. When Cottrell was hired, I heard he was going to run an
aggressive defense like Wade Phillips (I actually wished Wade were more
aggressive at times,) but it would appear Ted refuses to blitz. Are we ever
going to see him bring 5 or 6 guys??? You gotta give those DB's a chance -
especially against Hall of Fame qb's.

Finally, it sounds like LT is upset at something in specific (as opposed to
just being generally upset about the losses.) What do you think it is?

Thanks for your coverage.

Ed  /  Downtown SD

Answer

If you kept your eyes on every sideline during every game, you'd see stuff
like that.

As for report cards, I think they are one of the most difficult and stupid
things we do. Difficult for anyone to make such judgments immediately after
a game. There's a reason coaches and players watch video.

The Chargers are blitzing more than any team in the NFL. It's a fact.

LT takes losses hard. I honestly have no idea what it is he is being coy
about. I do know after three years of being around him on a regular basis
that he wears his emotions on his sleeve and hates to lose.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
Kevin,
chargers didn't play that bad, despite what happened I think the secondary
showed some very positive signs. I think Jammer had one of his better games,
they played against Bret Frave! Green bay has one of the best secondaries
and River scompleted 15 of 15. It just seems coached don't know the players
yet and who's best under what situations for example I don't think Cromartie
is a physical corner who's going to get a bump on a recv'er. I actually see
the defense playing better, chargers had a chance to win twice on the road
with a drive and needed to run out the clock or kic FG, if can't do that
can't win the NFL. the reason they were 14-2 last year was LT.

My question why is Norv unable to get the running game going? and create
playes to get LT in the game when the opposeing team is stacked in the box?
He's supposed to be great offense mind sorry I havn't seen it.

Where's the offense  /  Solana beach

Answer

Folks, it isn't all Norv. In fact, I'd say it's not Norv at all. Take a look
at the O line.

You're right about Jammer and the secondary. They just didn't do well
enough. Favre is playing like he's five years younger.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
Im not concerned about the Chargers...The three games have been tough, but
once again I have to ask if Norv is the guy. He doesn't seem to have the
knack for getting the team ready to play. GB spreaded them out just like NE
did...the defense seems slow, and out of position. I believe Norv is not the
guy, and let KC come in a have Brodie C pick them apart too. Im lost for
words...

Darrell L.  /  San Diego(MV),CA

Answer

If Brodie Croyle picks them apart, they are in trouble.

The secondary actually played OK. really. (I did not say great.)

They stopped Green Bay on its first possession and scored on their first
possession yesterday. They seemed ready to me.

Kevin Acee

Question
Will the Chargers FIRE NORV anytime soon???????

David  /  SAN DIEGO

Answer

no

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
Why are the Chargers running the ball time after time on first down? Has
Rivers been told not to call any audibles or does Turner feel he has to let
LT run the ball enough to keep him happy? Do the Chargers think they can run
against an &quot;eight in the box&quot; defense?

ASL3676  /  San Diego

Answer

The Chargers have run a lot on first down -- not an inordinate amount
though.
Absolutley, he does not have to keep LT happy by handing him the ball.
Yes, as crazy as it sounds, the Chargers do think they can run (sometimes)
against eight-man fronts.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
What is you thoughts on how to fix the Chargers? Merriman hasn't made a
tackle or done any of his whacko jumping around since he got off his drugs.
The defensive backs cant cover me, and I'm 70 years old and crippled. Rivers
can't ever get out of his own way, he would be something like 2 for 50 if it
were not for Gates. Would not surprize me if they went 3-13.

bobby  /  san diego

Answer

Saying Rivers would be 2 for 50 if it weren't for Gates is like saying Favre
would be 2 for 50 w/o Driver or Brady would be 21 for 50 w/o Moss.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
It seems as though the Chargers are living off of 2006. They are all over
the TV, pushing this and that. Some are known for (sack) dancing more than
winning. Would you agree that this team read a few too many press clippings
from last year combined with a new staff and that has spelled disaster?

paul  /  atlanta

Answer

There might be something to this team believing its own press.

But Merriman doesn't dance anymore.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007

Question
Very simple question for everyone (including myself, until I thought of
this question) buying into the theory that coaching adjustments necessarily
take time to work through, thus explaining the Chargers' start: How the heck
do you explain Dallas?

Arthur  /  Los Angeles

Answer

Excellent point.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
Kevin, this is my last entry. I'm getting tired of you responding to
comments and questions on this site, like the one about are we going to win
another game. I have written several positive things that don't seem to get
read and promoted on this site. This site is all negative and it's wearing
on me just like the frustration of not converting on 3rd and 2 to seal up
the game. Why didn't Norv put some sort of play in that has a higher
percentage of success, not a pinpoint throw to the sideline, we could have
thrown a quick screen to LT or a fake pitch roll out by Rivers and 3 yard
pass to Brandon M. or Gates? Finally, the KC game IS a must win, and we
should win. I think it plays out like this. Win v. KC, Loss to Den, Win v.
Oak, Win v. Houston, Win v. Vikings, Loss v. Colts, Loss v. Jags, Win v.
Balt, Loss KC, Win Tenn., Win v. Lions, Win v. Denver, Win v. Raiders 10-6
Playoffs maybe Division Title. Playoffs ? Since this could be my last entry,
why not answer me back, and I'm sure I won't be able to stay away. Thanks

Chris  /  Annapolis

Answer

Chris, keep the faith.

I like the fake pitch rollout. It always works, doesn't it?

So you have them 3-3 at the bye. I see that.

You also have them enduring another two-game losing streak. Do you think you
will be able to handle that?

And I know I replied to one of your questions last week.

Kevin Acee

Monday, September 24, 2007
Question
Sometimes you have to give credit to the other team,Farve was tremendous,we
lost a close game on the road to
a good football team.The division is still wide open,let's play some ball
next week.Ladanian Tomlinsons comments
are disturbing.Does he seem this frustrated during the week?

Steve  /  San Diego

Answer

Interesting perspective that I think is accurate. Still, at some point they
can't say that anymore -- like this week after playing Kansas City.

As for LT, yes, he is ALWAYS frustrated after losses. He wears it on his
sleeve more than other players.

Kevin Acee

Question
Why in the world would the Chargers get rid of Marty with a 14-2 season
last year? Is this season's loss record relative to a bad decision? Why in
the world would any owner even consider getting rid a coach with a 14-2

Question
9-7?

Is 9-7 good enough for a Wild Card birth in the AFC this year?

As the target market for the product known as the &quot;San Diego Chargers&quot;, I'm
saddened to report that I'm not having as much fun as I was last year. Yes,
even this early on in last season's campaign there was much more happening
on the field and on the sidelines indicating there was hope.

Rob Murphy  /  Wildomar

Answer

In the AFC West, at this point, it appears 9-7 might be good enough to win
the division.

I hate to keep preaching this (I really do) but let's not get ahead of
ourselves.

Things are broken. Look around the league, however, and you will see a lot
of teams where things aren't going well.

This Sunday will mark the quarter point.

Remember, the Chargers started 3-0 in 2001. Mike Riley was fired after that
5-11 season. The next year, the first under Marty, the Chargers were 4-0 and
then finished 8-8.

Question
Kevin,

Please answer the following question...

You know you have a terrible pass defense when:

a) The opposing QB passes on every play and you can't stop him.
b) On 4th and inches from your goal line, still refusing to run, the QB
