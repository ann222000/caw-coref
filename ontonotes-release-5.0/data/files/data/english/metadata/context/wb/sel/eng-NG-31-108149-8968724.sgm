Not totally quiet.
He has been known to break his silence to post CB
topic messages, and gererally act the good guy.

There is a CB shop in this country who use the UK CB
newsgroup. They even promote it on their site.
They post the odd message to announce the release
of their newsletter, but otherwise say little.
One time someone went at them, accusing them of ripping
someone off.  The owner simply stated his case, explaining
why he could not give a full refund on the specific item, and
left it at that.
At no time did he belittle the customer or any other person on
the group, even when the person in question started saying how
he &quot;looked like a gay rapist&quot; (whatever one looks like).
He gained nothing but respect for his reasoned reply and restraint.

I feel that Brian's problem may be a lack of technical expertise
in the relevant field.  Rather than give facts, he has to resort to
trying to discredit those who doubt his claims about the product.

Tell me something, Jim...  In the US of A, is an Electrical Engineer
qualified in the field of electronics, audio, sound theory and radio?
Only, over here, there is a big difference between electrical and
electronic qualifications.
I am not saying that one is lower than the other, just different.

There is intelligence on this newsgroup - but not as we know it, Jim.

Peter.

Afternoon Peter. I have been following the UK.rec.radio.cb ng since its
inception as I was one of the original petitioners for its founding. Its
a rather mellow version of this place.
The definition of an electrical engineer i guess would be what the IEEE
determines what one is.  I was given the position of senior engineer by
my employer at the time (Lockheed Martin) but it didn't really mean
anything to me.

Please show where I call your product &quot;insignificant&quot;, back
up your claim.

The fact is that it is very significant.  For FM CB this
significance is similar to the significance of a bomb up
your ass.
Not very good and extremely messy, but certainly
significant in the damage caused.  Very few people
would want to be stood in an adjacent space and
experience the splatter.

And, if it is not RoHS compliant, UK dealers may find people
like Trading Standards appearing on their doorstep to be
rather significant.
Is it compliant?

I'll bet you wish you had not mentioned RoHS now.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Doesn't make much sense...
">

That's because you do not understand FM CB, and
clearly have not the experience of it that us Brits
have of it.
Otherwise, you would not need telling about the
problems of NBFM CB with just 10KHz channel spacing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  it's innovative and unique.
">

There is nothing &quot;innovative and unique&quot; about splattering
adjacent channels with a speech processor on NBFM CB.
We have been doing it for decades, unfortunately.

We still have the same splatter problem right now.  Only
yesterday I was listening to two people on 19.
Each were splattering the adjacent channels.
But, here's the thing... the one doing the most splattering
was NOT the one who sounded loudest.
So, why did one sound louder with less deviation... especially
when he was NOT the one using a speech processor?

When you understand why one person, with a lower peak
and average deviation, can be louder than the other - then
you can start to see what is really needed for FM CB.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I see your role as one of &quot;spoiler&quot; or should we
&gt; say &quot;unbeknownst shill&quot;.
">

I don't doubt your distorted view of reality.

The reality is that we, here in the UK, have over 26
years of experience with NBFM CB radio in everyday
use, as the only legal CB system.
The experience backs up the bandwidth theory, as
shown on the linked Wiki pages and in books (including
the advanced engineering mathematics book I have sat
here).

There is also the problem of you not having experience
of specific UK radios.  Some have very quiet sounding
audio and, no matter how much you try to turn it up, it
will always sound quiet.

Only a couple of days back, I was speaking to someone
who was sold a speech processor as the answer to her
modulation problems... only to find it did nothing except
distort.
The reason was the poor design of the radio, which a
speech processor or power microphone will not cure.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Evidently, they were not swayed by your passionate works...
">

I have NEVER said that a speech processor is not useful
on AM or SSB. In fact, look back through my posts and
you may find suggestions that they are useful for those
modes.

Please, feel free to push speech processing for use on
AM, SSB or wideband FM... but UK FM CB is none of
those and is unsuitable for such devices.

Read the above carefully... UK FM CB is unsuitable for
your device.  NBFM CB is not good enough for such
techniques.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You are certainly one of the more colorful people out here.
">

Now I get it... you mean that I know too much for your
own good.  Your best try is to attempt to make me look
like a &quot;character&quot;, so that people will not notice that
you dodge questions and fail to give real answers.

Maybe I should make my position clearer, and you can quote this
to your customers... as long as you quote it entirely and do so
equally to those wanting the product for AM, SSB and FM CB:
A good speech processor can be extremely useful for AM and
SSB.  It's use on FM, however, requires a system with sufficient
bandwith.  FM CB does NOT have sufficient bandwidth - so they
should not be used on those systems.
I have not tested the VoiceMax, so can neither recommend it
as &quot;good&quot; or state the opposite - but radio and electronic
theory, and the 26 years experience of UK NBFM CB, show
that NO speech processor should be used on NBFM CB
systems with just 10KHz channel spacing.
This applies equally to the competitor's products.

How's that, clear enough?

Peter.

&gt; Why Do You Need a Speech Processor for Your CB Radio?
">

The simple answer is that you don't.  You need air, you
need water and you need food... but you will survive
without a speech processor.

The word &quot;need&quot; is used by salesmen to create a feeling of
urgency, so you rush out and buy their product without too
much thought or product comparison.

A speech processor is *useful* for AM and SSB CB, but
you really can take your time and shop around for the
best product for your needs.
Here are just a few alternative products:

Lou Franklin's DSP:
http://www.cbcintl.com/dsp.htm
Bobs CB speech processor - kit, pre-built or boxed:
http://bobscb.com/kits/tr_kits.htm
Spectrum Communications speech processor:

&gt; Maintaining a high modulation level is crucial in providing

Transmitter efficiency is set by the output biasing, not
the audio levels.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; operating on AM, FM, or SSB modes.
">

Speech compression is NOT suitable for FM CB - there are
only 10KHz between channels.
Compression works on broadcast FM because they do have
the bandwidth - equal to 30 CB channels for one transmission.

If you want broadcast quality FM, you require broadcast
quality bandwidth.  This would make the whole Citizens'
Band just one single channel.

You cannot put a Pint in a 1/2 Pint jug.  Those who tell you
otherwise are selling something, and really don't care how
they make the sale.

When deciding which product to buy or use, trust is
important. In deciding trust, people may wish to take notice
that the above linked pages make no reference to use
on FM CB.
Do you think they just don't want to sell their product, or
that they are simply not willing to mislead people just to
make a sale?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The average modulation of a typical voice signal is only
&gt; about 40%. This low percentage applied to the transmitter,
&gt; results in less than optimal transmission range.
">

Except in the case of FM (NBFM) CB, where it makes it
possible to fit your transmission on a single channel.
Increasing average audio on an FM CB transmission increases
the average adjacent channel power.  This is then picked up
by people on the next channel, but clipped by those trying
to listen to you on your channel.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; clipping distorts the original signal and sounds fuzzy
&gt; on the air.
">

Fuzzy at best, large amounts of clipping cause severe
distortion and difficulty undestanding the person.
This is a common problem when people try to increase
their peak or average deviation on FM CB.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; VoiceMax holds your transceiver at 100% modulation
&gt; allowing you to punch through heavy channel traffic
">

This does not apply to FM.
The output amplitude of an FM transmitter is constant,
extra deviation will NOT boost your signal above
the &quot;traffic&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; VoiceMax works with your non-amplified dynamic microphone
">

Another issue with FM CB, is that they use very little audio
power to modulate the transmitter. There is not a UK FM CB
made that does not have all it needs to give far more audio
than required... without additional add-on devices.

Peter.

my point is this: there is some question as to the use of a trademark.

also, you seem to have over 10,000 hits on google just for your newsgroup
postings (in non-radio-related groups at that) and very few actual hits for
a company name &quot;Telstar Electronics&quot;.

in any case, you do have a problem with your product (read my other
posting). if you really want it to be credible, have it certified by an
IEEE certified lab or perhaps something similar to Underwriters Labs.

I've seen your particular design. its not new. its a basic design that gets
used in hundreds of other audio related products (mic gain amps in devices
such as the iPOD, iPHONE, other portable audio recording devices, etc)..

you might find that because there is prior art, a patent would be a little
hard to get.

anyway. the point has been made. you have a legal question to answer.

Just because the chip is used in other equiptment does not mean your
implementation in CB radios is &quot;great&quot;. There are legitamate uses for
compression of the audio. DSB-LC and SSB-SC is in my opinion not one
of those applications. For the money invested there is not that much
value added.

most firms here often use their name as part of (or in whole) their name. As

You really do not know who I am (and for that, I pity you).
I can see from all the postings that perhaps you are very wrong (I have read
the reports of 2 qualified and verified engineers who say you are wrong).
you just need to get the message, *trailer trash* (thats right, I call them
like I see them and I see you as TRAILER TRASH).

Now, why don't you go back to school, learn a real trade, or better yet,
give up the trade you are in and go drive a truck (that pretty much seems
like what you are good for anyway *road nigger*).

Perhaps you will die behind the wheel and save us the trouble of removing
you from the gene pool.

Here's where you could start...

&gt; many folks seem to think the targets of there ire

No problem so far, but the following group of words do not
appear to make sense when grouped as they are (or following
the above)...

&gt; have the that duty

Some punctuation may also help.
I guess that should be at the end of the above, as the following
makes sense as a sentence (apart from spelling/typing errors)...

&gt; I person just lump them all under what ever label I
&gt; feel like suing that day

I can cope with typing errors, but I cannot get the meaning of
&quot;have the that duty&quot;

There may also be some ambiguity.
Are you trying to saying that Griffter is not required to guess the
name of his assailant?

If so, then the same applies the other way.  Many people appear
to believe that a person using the newsgroup has a duty to give
their full name and address.

Unless someone is wanting to sell you something or asking for
personal information, does it really matter who they are?  Would
Brian be any better off if they gave their other identity, would
that mean any more to him than no name?

Regards,
Peter.
