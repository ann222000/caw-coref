Officials want speed limit near islands

Hormone therapy coverage bill on hold

CONCORD – A House committee voted to keep custody until next year a
proposed mandate that insurance companies cover hormone treatment for
transsexuals.

The House Commerce Committee voted to retain the proposal one day
after taking initial testimony on it.

Several women and men going through a sex change had urged that New
Hampshire join California and Washington as the only states to fully
cover hormone treatments.

Supporters said it's unfair that males and females can get hormone
supplements covered under insurance but not if it's to change their
gender.
