See part 0 for header information.

&quot;We got them,&quot; she said, even as a wall of static fuzzed in over the comm and
somewhere in the depths of it all Inara's voice said, &quot;Shuttle two commencing
docking - &quot;

Another hit rocked *Serenity*. Bad moment for it... bad moment. &quot;Are they in?&quot;
Badger asked. &quot;Are they safe? We're gorram sitting ducks here!&quot;

&quot;They're in,&quot; River said, gleeful, laughing. &quot;They're alive.&quot;

&quot;Then hit it,&quot; Badger breathed. &quot;Get us the rutting hell out of here.&quot;

&quot;Aye, aye, cap'n!&quot;

He could've sworn the girl was laughing at more'n their survival issue as she
muffled a giggle accompanying the salute and the trite reply.

***

Badger, River and Book were still on the bridge when Mal made his way back up
there. Had seemed for the best River stay, given the possibility of more
attention from the Alliance, and that Book stay given the possibility of, well,
craziness. God alone knew what Badger was doing up there, but from what he'd
heard it had been almost what you might call fortunate he had been, a while
back.

&quot;How we doing?&quot; Mal asked. Gas planet filled the top half of their view,
reflecting *Serenity's* changed position, and the lack of Alliance space
hardware in that view was a definite improvement.

&quot;Keeping out of sight, captain,&quot; Book supplied. &quot;We've established contact with
Zoe and we're on our way now to pick them up, staying under Alliance
radar.&quot;

River looked engrossed with her task of manning the helm, concentration on her
face like she was communing with the ship itself, expression a very picture of
serenity. Mal watched her a moment before dragging his gaze aside. &quot;Damned if
there ain't anything that girl can't do,&quot; he muttered to himself with... well,
perhaps a trace of resentment. Weren't like he'd ever gone and wasted hours on
end trying to get Wash to drum the knack of flying into him, back when.

&quot;How about surgery, captain?&quot; Book suggested mildly. &quot;It's good to see you up
and about.&quot;

&quot;Good to be up and about.&quot; Mal patted the preacher's arm appreciatively, and
since all seemed well on the bridge, turned to leave. In turning, happened to
catch his eye on Badger, and memory gave him reason to pause. &quot;Hear you been
makin' yourself useful having a play at captain in my absence?&quot;

&quot;Screw you, Reynolds,&quot; Badger shot back, unhelpful.

Mal pressed his lips together and nodded consideringly. &quot;Nothing's come up on
the cortex,&quot; he supplied, &quot;so we'll be headed back to Persephone after picking
up the shuttle. All's well and we can be trusting you to keep your mouth shut -
&quot; he glanced toward River, but she was otherwise engrossed &quot; - you'll get off
there. Shouldn't take more'n forty-eight hours in all 'til we have you back on
home soil.&quot;

Badger only looked mighty sour and Mal, unruffled, turned and headed out down
the steps, taking it a mite more careful than usual true enough, but all-in-all
feeling restored. He made his way down through the kitchen and along to the
infirmary.

Wash was conscious and sitting up complaining that the verse had some kind of
universal conspiracy against him as Mal entered. He stared out bemused from
under the arch of Simon's arm, the doctor engaged in dealing with his head
wound, before raising his hand in a weak wave. Simon carried out a fairly
acrobatic manoeuvre to swap hands over and twist around to Wash's other side
without taking the surgical pad off the wound. &quot;You're on your feet,&quot; Wash said
with the giddy content of the concussed.

&quot;That I am.&quot; Mal looked to Simon. &quot;He gonna be all right?&quot;

&quot;He'll be fine.&quot;

&quot;Simon claims his crazy sister's flyin' the ship,&quot; Wash told Mal,
conspiratorially, as though passing on a funny joke. &quot;How about that?&quot;

&quot;That'd be because his crazy sister's flyin' the ship,&quot; Mal responded, deadpan.
&quot;You need anything passed over, doctor?&quot;

Simon pointed, and he carried over the items indicated, then retreated to lean
against a counter while the doctor worked.

&quot;How come nobody told me River could fly the ship?&quot; Wash asked, accusingly.

&quot;Girl's like a sponge,&quot; Mal said. &quot;Picks up all sorts. Knifing. Gunplay...&quot;

Simon protested, &quot;I thought we weren't dwelling on that any more?&quot;

&quot;Best hope she didn't spend too much time with Badger. Wouldn't like to think
the sorts of things she'd be picking up from him.&quot;

&quot;It's kind of sweet, in a... wholly revolting way,&quot; Wash reflected. &quot;Okay, so
not sweet, then. But something. Definitely something. There may not be a word
for it, but that's definitely what it...&quot;

&quot;Yes, Wash,&quot; Mal cut him off, and addressed Simon. &quot;Now that we're all secure,
doctor, you got any cares to tell me precisely what you had to go running off
to find down on that facility?&quot; He didn't make a particular effort to keep the
hostility from his voice, and Wash's eyes tracked between the two of them in
surprise. Simon halted and his mouth hung open a moment, silenced.

Then he shook his head, his eyes drifting down, and his lips worked another few
seconds before it seemed he was able to make the words come. &quot;They did some
work there... a long time ago. A decade, at least, and before... the
information was old. Some of it, it looked like they've been working on for
longer than I've been alive. The prototypes... the men we found... They used
criminals, the insane... disposable minds. But it didn't work, they couldn't
control them. The conclusions I saw before security came in were pointing out
the next step as to be using only the very best. Talking about...&quot; Wash was
forgotten; his hands waved, empty, helpless, through air. &quot;Breeding programs.
Tests. Schools. Filtering methods, to find minds they might use.&quot;

&quot;And they were trying to make readers? Psychics?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes. 'Human weapons', was a phrase I saw used. A weapon.&quot; He looked away,
and laughed bitterly. &quot;My sister's a weapon. No, I didn't find anything useful.
I didn't find anything I don't wish I hadn't found at all.&quot;

Mal just nodded grimly, and turned to head out, before he said anything he'd
regret. Be time aplenty for recriminations later, when the situation in front
of them was dealt with. But the internal comm chimed its cent's-worth, stopping
him in the doorway. &quot;Shuttle's coming to dock, captain,&quot; Book's voice said.

Mal left in chase of the message. Spent a few minutes waiting outside the
shuttle dock before he heard the grind of mechanics that signalled they were
being pulled in tight. Another short stretch of waiting and the door slid
back.

&quot;Captain!&quot; Kaylee's face was one big smile all over at the sight of him.
&quot;You're walking!&quot; She hurled herself into his arms as though to make a point of
his shiny new stability, and near made a lie of it. Nonetheless, he tugged her
to him and returned the hug 'til Zoe stepped out and diverted his
attention.

&quot;Sir.&quot; She smiled, and kneaded his shoulder with a familiar hand. Something
arch and suspicious, though, in the way she queried him, &quot;You sure you're meant
to be up and about? Why, you can't have been off the table more than
twenty-four hours.&quot;

&quot;I'm good,&quot; he said, not about to tell her it was close to half that. &quot;Doc
fixed me up right fine. Just like he said. Spot of unrelated bother, but
there's no call for dragging out the details here and now. How've things been
with yourselves?&quot;

&quot;I did a job,&quot; Kaylee said excitedly. &quot;Fellow needed his XNT7 fixin'. Got us
some credit in, cap'n. Couple of crates need taking over to Nelson, too, ain't
more'n a few hours past Persephone, and half paid up-front.&quot;

&quot;Sounds shiny.&quot;

&quot;'Shiny', he says. Ain't like you had to spend two days trolling the gorram
armpit of the 'verse.&quot; Jayne's familiar griping preceded the man himself out of
the shuttle. Once emerged, he gave Mal's upright state a once-over and nodded,
apparently satisfied to let it pass without comment.

&quot;No,&quot; Mal said, with Jayne-baiting sarcasm. &quot;I just spent them flat on my back
getting needles poked into my skull. You got the short end of that deal all
right.&quot;

&quot;Best let him be, sir,&quot; Zoe said with amusement. &quot;Poor baby. He had a
depressing time.&quot;

&quot;You shouldn't pick on him,&quot; Kaylee berated her, a certain gush in her voice.
Jayne very visibly winced and shrank away from the two women.

&quot;You ladies been intimidating our muscle-man here? I'm shocked you would do
such a thing.&quot; Mal shook his head at them. &quot;Shocked, plain and simple.&quot;

&quot;Gorram it, Mal...&quot; Jayne ducked back into the shuttle and picked up a crate;
stomped off with it down toward the cargo deck. The steps shook with every
over-hard footfall.

Zoe and Kaylee exchanged a look and made what seemed a mighty effort not to
burst out with their giggles. Then Zoe sobered and, looking around, asked,
&quot;Where's that straying husband of mine?&quot;

&quot;Wash is in the infirmary - nothing serious, just took a tumble in a slice of
trouble we had. Reckon he'd be mighty glad to see you, too,&quot; he added. She was
already heading down into the ship, away from him. He looked at Kaylee.
&quot;Simon's there too, doing the patching.&quot;

&quot;Lookin' to get shot of me, captain?&quot;

&quot;No, I - &quot;

Kaylee laughed at him, too, and he swiped a hand through her hair,
comprehensively mussing it by way of retaliation. &quot;*Xie-xie*, cap'n. I'll go
down there now and... say hi to Simon.&quot; She set off as she spoke, near walking
backwards, trying to look like she weren't in any kind of hurry at all.

More slowly, Mal crossed the width of the ship and paused a while outside the
closed door of Inara's shuttle before finally scraping up the resolve to raise
his hand and knock.

&quot;Come in, Mal,&quot; her dry voice said from within.

He opened the door on a back view of her shrugging into a black and silver
robe, and averted his eyes. &quot;Had enough psychics on board, so I thought, with
'em numbering just the one,&quot; he said. &quot;Expecting me?&quot;

&quot;To tell the truth, I didn't think you'd wait so long as this.&quot; Facing him, she
fastened the cord on the front of her robe with a brisk tug, and let her hands
fall to her sides. &quot;Are you going to lecture me now on my choices?&quot; The
faintest hint of retreat, of uncertainty in her face, anticipating fending off
his rage.

&quot;I'm angry with *Simon*,&quot; Mal emphasised. &quot;You're... what's done is done. This
is...&quot; And he faltered. Looked around the shuttle, the fancy accoutrements, the
rich living. Trinkets and threads from a thousand different men and a hundred
different worlds. &quot;What will you do?&quot; he asked, hearing his voice crack.

&quot;What will I *do*?&quot; Inara sat herself down and fussed with teacups and a teapot
on a tray - he wasn't convinced there was any water in the pot, nor nothing but
an excuse for distraction, and he wasn't used to seeing her off-balance enough
to telegraph so blatantly. After a moment she gave up, folding her hands tight
over her knees.

&quot;Worst comes to the worst,&quot; he elaborated. &quot;Which it's like to do, you surely
must see.&quot;

&quot;If it happens, I'll deal with it,&quot; she said. &quot;It was my choice, Mal. You don't
have to shoulder any blame, or add to that tiresome 'weight of the world'
complex of yours. And...&quot; She met his eyes. &quot;I can't say I'm not a little angry
with Simon myself. But I also can't say I'm surprised. He simply... acted
according to his nature. As do we all.&quot;

&quot;Maybe.&quot; Mal grimaced, and shook his head, more to clear it than in any denial
of Inara's piece. He wasn't thinking about Simon just now. Other things had
better priority on his mind. &quot;You'll always have a place here. Don't matter
what happens. Wanted you to know that. Hell, you already know that, and here's
me - &quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said sincerely.

He was uncomfortable under that gaze. Too much going on, he thought, to be
talking on this now. &quot;Well. Since that's all spoke - probably best I get going,
give you some quiet.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Her chin dipped. &quot;You should get some rest. Being dragged from a
hospital bed into the thick of firefights... I imagine it's long past due.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; He turned to go, stopped midway, swung back. &quot;Call me crazy, but is
there something else we're not talking on here? Is this about your
professor?&quot;

She sighed and stood and crossed to the other side of the room to fuss with
something there, almost obscured out of sight in the dimness among the fancy
drapes. Mal waited out the unwelcoming vibes 'til she was forced to speak. &quot;I
didn't get to say goodbye. I didn't get to... talk things out. And now I never
will.&quot;

&quot;He'll be safe, if he plays it right,&quot; Mal said stiffly. &quot;That's a hell of a
lot better'n closure.&quot;

She swore at him violently in Chinese. &quot;You think I don't know that? It doesn't
make it easier, Mal. I don't even know... if he was the same man I knew
anymore. The man I knew would never have worked on developing tools of
slaughter.&quot;

&quot;We all change,&quot; he said. &quot;We all have to.&quot;

Inara shook her head. Not a contradiction so much as an unwillingness to hear.
&quot;Please go,&quot; she told him, sinking down on the edge of her bed with her back to
him. &quot;Tomorrow, we'll talk. Right now I have to be alone.&quot;

Mal started to nod, slowly, then curtailed the gesture she couldn't see.
Feeling uncommonly heavy, he turned and left the shuttle, closing the door
behind him.

Alone, he headed back to his quarters, dragging an aching body felt like the
most part of it was already asleep, dreaming gorram lousy dreams.

***

_Epilogue_

&quot;I will never understand what that girl is seeing in him,&quot; Mal said, shaking
his head. Across the intervening dust and occasional sauntering vagrant of
Eavesdown Docks, River and Badger spoke animatedly.

He queried Wash and Jayne, watching similarly, and they looked just as bemused.
The hot sun seemed to intensify, and Mal reached up a hand to shade his eyes.
Jayne wafted a hat through the air, trying to create himself a spot of a
breeze. The three of them leaned against the mule, parked where it had been in
the shade of *Serenity* not long since, but shaded no longer now the sun had
reached its zenith.

&quot;Herself,&quot; Inara interjected quietly, surprising all of them given that Inara
wasn't having much to say of anything, of late. Mal looked askance at her where
she was perched on the charred seat of the mule in clothes dialled down a level
from her usual grandeur, browns and creams that wouldn't be amiss on any
spacefaring gal of, she had assured him at least, inordinately impeccable
taste. She held a parasol borrowed from Kaylee, and Mal was considering taking
all abandonment of his hard-earned manly image for the sake of joining her
under there.

Under all their questioning attention, Inara carefully elaborated, &quot;River's
brain has been altered - somehow - to sense the thoughts and feelings of
others. That much we know. Badger... he sees her. He desires her. We all want
to be given that kind of rebirth through another's eyes. Every girl wants to be
seen as beautiful... and for River, I would imagine, *whole*. It's only... a
little more literal, in this case, than ordinarily.&quot;

She shrugged, and turned away from their stares. The parasol obscured her face.

&quot;Is this going to happen *every* time someone takes a shine to the girl?&quot; Wash
asked, laughing, his voice raising its pitch in incredulity.

&quot;Maybe.&quot; Inara's voice was sarcastic, beneath the parasol. &quot;But it was also
new, and... I don't think it can be so easy, to find someone who really does
care purely enough that the experience wouldn't be... repellent, in a way.&quot;

&quot;Badger and pure?&quot; Mal quipped. &quot;Strikes me something about that theory just
don't sit right.&quot;

&quot;You don't have to be a saint to love,&quot; Inara said. She tipped the parasol back
and swept her eyes around them all. &quot;After all, even Jayne loves his mother,&quot;
she finished dryly.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Jayne protested.

Mal laughed, and after a moment quietened, returning himself to watching the
two. &quot;It's a tale of forbidden romance, broken dreams and woe, all right,&quot; he
murmured, folding his arms. &quot;They start exchanging tokens or kissing, and I may
just cry.&quot;

Wash dug an elbow in his ribs, and leaned over to advise, with a tip of his
head toward Inara, &quot;The chicks won't love you for that kind of talk, sir. Take
it from the married guy.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Wash,&quot; she said. &quot;Because my illusions of the captain as a romantic and
considerate soul are in severe danger of being shattered.&quot;

Across the dust, Badger and River broke apart, and Badger strode off hatless
into the chaos of the market. Mal watched him corner a couple of his men who'd
been sniffing around a while in the shadows. Words were exchanged, then they
meekly fell in behind him as Badger walked away, his back becoming lost among
the crowds.

&quot;Well, looks like we don't need to be having no worries on account of Badger.&quot;
Mal glanced between Jayne and Wash. &quot;Not that we were having worries on account
of Badger.&quot; And maybe it wasn't the most sensitive of things in the world to
let River walk back into the midst of a round of raucous laughter.

He quieted, and asked her, &quot;You sure you're sure we can trust him not to sell
us out to the feds first chance he gets?&quot;

&quot;I'm sure.&quot; She craned her head, looking into the crowd, focusing on nothing.
She didn't seem unhappy. More like... distant. &quot;He won't betray us. Too
afraid... too involved, now.&quot;

Mal followed her vague gaze, then switched to Inara, then back to River. &quot;I
guess we can trust that.&quot;

&quot;You know it,&quot; River said, and delivered a slap to his rump as she walked
around him and on up into the ship.

For a moment, as the whole bunch of them stared after her, there was silence.
Wasn't to anyone's surprise Jayne being the first to start up laughing again,
nor that the other two followed him prompt when he did. Mal had enough on his
plate with staring.

&quot;Reckon you can let go of your backside now, captain,&quot; Wash said, uncharitably
gleeful. &quot;At least, I don't think she's coming back to assault you again.&quot;

Inara was laughing so hard she all but fell off the mule.

&quot;Little girl's growin' up,&quot; Jayne said, leering, then a bit more uneasy, &quot;What
the hell do we do iffen the next turns out to be one she wants to keep?&quot;

&quot;Worry,&quot; Mal supplied. &quot;Worry for all we're worth.&quot;

&quot;Heck, that's real unromantic of you, Mal.&quot;

&quot;Believe we got that one covered already. Don't care for romance. Care for
keeping my fugitives hid and my ship running, and no gorram complications in
between.&quot;

There was a whisper of shifting cloth as Inara slid off the mule and followed
River inside, and he watched her slim, graceful figure disappear into the shade
of the hold, which was so dark in contrast to the sunlight that once past the
threshold she couldn't be made out at all.

&quot;Maybe we should go join them,&quot; Wash said, looking over his shoulder too.
&quot;Might be that Harrow's responded to your wave by now.&quot;

&quot;No hurry.&quot; Mal leaned against the mule next to Wash and Jayne in the
discomfort and the heat of the sun, breathing the dust stirred up on the air by
feet and hooves and wheels, the noise of Persephone in his ears, standing and
sunning in a stolen moment midst the sure-to-be-fast-returning chaos. Stayed
there 'til Kaylee walked down from the ship to tell them Harrow's message had
come in.

***

Sir Warwick met him in the grounds after the crisply hostile gate guards were
through making him wait an uncivil long while. Didn't escape Mal's notice that
the fellow was going armed, and he was given to recollect that since Sir
Warwick had figured to second him against Atherton in that gorram duel, he must
be fair confident of his ability to stand up to criminals and smugglers should
a situation turn ugly.

Did make him wonder why Sir Warwick had so very much reason to believe this was
a situation would turn ugly. He'd come armed himself, but that was no more than
habit. &quot;Reckon you're a mite less than happy right now, 'bout us tailing out -
&quot; Mal began.

&quot;You break dock with no warning, no message? Show a blatant disregard for all
our prior arrangements? I'd say that's a reason to be more than a 'mite'
unhappy, Captain Reynolds,&quot; Sir Warwick said, with irritation. Of course, he
usually sounded irritated, which did make the situation a fraction hard to
gauge.

Either way, they'd halted their walking less than thirty yards from the gate,
and Harrow had his hands at his sides and Mal had his folded over his
chest.

&quot;Granted, and if you'll just let me explain - &quot;

&quot;Please do.&quot; Sir Warwick swept a hand between them, inviting.

Which made Mal feel all kinds of uneasy and on-the-spot and was no doubt
supposed to, feelings he tried to shove aside for the sake of speaking his
piece. &quot;Short version. Got ourselves a peck of trouble with the local Alliance.
Had to cut loose, didn't know if we'd been tagged. Any message we could've sent
ran the risk of implicating you. Figured we wouldn't want to set the law on our
favourite customer. Kaylee'd miss the fancy meals too much.&quot; He bit off any
more, reached over and brushed down Harrow's shoulders placatingly, and got his
hands slapped away for his trouble.

Sir Warwick turned aside, taking a few steps further along the path, looking
thoughtful. &quot;It shows forethought. And professionalism - if you're telling the
truth, of course.&quot;

&quot;I'm telling the truth,&quot; Mal said, hard. &quot;Don't ask me to elaborate. You don't
want no part of the other business.&quot;

&quot;But your Companion, Inara, did - or so I hear.&quot;

Mal froze. He took a careful breath, and counted a bit, 'fore he said, quite
calm, &quot;You heard about that here?&quot;

Sir Warwick's brows twisted up in something almost amusement. &quot;She's an adjunct
to Persephone's high society, captain. Of course we heard about it. If one of
their over-powdered and perfumed number wears the wrong dress, it's known by
all within an hour. If one becomes a tagged Alliance fugitive... well, let's
just say Atherton Wing isn't going to stop gloating for a while.&quot;

Mal swore, comprehensively, in any language that came to hand. Took him a while
to work his way back around to coherent speech. &quot;Gorram it. Last thing I wanted
was Inara involved. She never was meant to be a part of it. Just renting space,
is all. Not one of the crew, so much. Not one of the crew at all.&quot; He stared
over the lush, green grounds, stretching for miles. Not his world. Inara's
world. And now not hers any more. &quot;Ruined her, is what I've done.&quot;

&quot;I'm sure that's not what happened.&quot; Sir Warwick's response was brisk. &quot;If for
no other reason, Captain Reynolds, than that I severely doubt any claim that
Inara would make a decision in ignorance or under duress. In any case, please
deliver to her my regards, since it seems we will not be meeting this year at
the ball.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Mal said numbly. &quot;I'll do that.&quot;

&quot;I'd suggest you take care on Persephone, captain,&quot; Sir Warwick added. &quot;After
last year's events, there are too many people here who know of Inara's Serra's
association with you.&quot;

He nodded slowly, no words to speak.

&quot;And if I have your assurance that your ship will, this time, be there...&quot;
Harrow frowned in a way made sure Mal knew he was still harbouring no shortage
of irritation. &quot;You can expect my cattle by the end of the afternoon. Business,
after all,&quot; he added, &quot;is still running.&quot;
