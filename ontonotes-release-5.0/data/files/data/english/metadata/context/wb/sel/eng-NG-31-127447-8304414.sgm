A Washington Post article on the subject of drug ties entitled, &quot;Conflict
Alleged in Drug Firms' Education Role,&quot; tied in the vested interests of the
pharmaceutical industry using the annual American Psychiatric Association
convention to illustrate how psychiatrists are entrenched in drug company money.
The article states, &quot;Last year's meeting of the American Psychiatric Association
in Toronto, the field's biggest educational conference, reflects the extent of
corporate sponsorship. In the meeting program, a voluntary listing of the
financial ties to drug firms of the physicians who served as instructors covered
14 pages. Some instructors were sponsored by at least a dozen companies.&quot;
