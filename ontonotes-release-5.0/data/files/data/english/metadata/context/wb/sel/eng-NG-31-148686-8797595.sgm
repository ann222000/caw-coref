I guess the baying of the hounds didn't quite do the trick. Fair warning has been given, the shot across the bow is ready. I don't care if it was made to look like a flag or was one that had been dyed, the symbolism is the same and so is the statement. So be it, release the griffin. I think it's time for the media to get involved as well as the rest of us.

Dear Bob,

Thank you for your concern and for taking the time to write.

As a veteran, myself, I personally find the black flag display offensive, even though I am told this is not an actual flag painted black but a piece made from scratch by the artist. To my mind, the display fails to respect the faithful service of many in our nation who sacrifice their lives for our right as a people to be free. But I know in my own life it was important to grapple with just the views expressed in this display in order to clarify what I believe as a Christian and an American.

As a Christian College we believe it is important for our students to be exposed to, and to examine carefully, points of view that may differ from what we believe. For this reason we have our students read books, hear guest speakers and view works of art that sometimes reflect values and perspectives different from those of Northwestern College. We do not do this flippantly or without caution; our purpose is to help students develop the ability to evaluate what is true, good and beautiful.

We respect your views and would welcome them in the conversation our art students will have about the display. Â Please let me know if you would like to participate.

Sincerely,

Bruce Murphy

Dr. Murphy,

It has come to my attention that one of the pieces of art on exhibit at Northwestern College consists of an American Flag, dyed black.

As a concerned citizen, I am well aware of the cost and sacrifice that has bought our flag's freedom, and what the flag means. Many people, good and strong, have given their lives -- not for the flag, but rather for what the flag represents.

When I see the flag, this is what I see:
. My father, aunt, brother, sister, son wearing a uniform, far from home, scared.
. A voting booth.
. Streets in my hometown that have never seen an enemy's footprint.
. The right to speak my mind.
. A nation that helps others, best it can.
. Friends left forever, their names carved on a wall.
. Home.
. People praying in the church their choice.
. Freedom.

I realize the flag means many things to many people, but one thing we almost all agree with is that the flag represents freedom. This includes the freedom for your students to speak out through artwork, and for your institution to show the artwork. Many of us here in Northwest Iowa wore a uniform and fought for your right to do so, and we will fight anyone who wants to take that freedom away. In return, we ask for respect. To those in your community who fought for the flag, it is a powerful symbol -- one that should not be taken lightly.

I request you remove the artwork in question from your exhibit out of respect for those who brought home the mud and sand of foreign conflicts home on their boots, and for those who did not make it home. The artist is free to express their opinion in other ways, I simply object to his or her choice of medium.

Thank you,
Bob Helwig
