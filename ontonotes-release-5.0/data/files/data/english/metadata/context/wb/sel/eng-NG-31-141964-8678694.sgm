Pasadena man is suing Manilow
City News Service
Article Launched: 09/05/2007 08:35:07 PM PDT

LOS ANGELES - Barry Manilow's former tour manager is suing the
entertainer's companies, alleging he was wrongfully fired because he was
divorcing the daughter of his immediate boss, court papers show.

The Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit filed on behalf of Liberato Fabro
of Pasadena alleges wrongful termination, employment discrimination
because of marital status and because of a disability, plus fraud and
misrepresentation.

Named as defendants are Barry Manilow Production Inc. and Barry Manilow
Townsway Entertainment. A representative for the companies was not
immediately available for comment.

According to the suit filed Tuesday, Fabro worked for Manilow from 1999 to
2006 at an annual salary of $180,000. He was responsible for production of
the entertainer's concert tours, television appearances and live benefit
performances, according to his court papers.

Fabro had knee surgery in October 2005, but continued to work, travel and
manage the singer's shows at the Las Vegas Hilton and other live
appearances, the suit states.

In February 2006, Fabro says he asked for and received permission from his
immediate boss, BMPI President Garry Kief, a leave of absence due
to his physical problems and also because his marriage to Kief's daughter
- who also worked for Manilow's companies - was failing.

When Fabro asked to come back two weeks later, Kief told him to come back
in another two weeks, according to his suit.

In March 2006, Fabro and Kief had a meeting in which his boss asked him to
accept a divorce settlement that was less than what the plaintiff thought
was fair, the suit states. When Fabro refused, he was fired by Kief, who
also told him his knee injury was an issue, according to his court
papers.

Fabro claims Kief told him he could not return to his job because it would
be &quot;too uncomfortable for all the parties involved,&quot; an apparent
reference to the divorce proceedings.

A few thoughts do come to mind here:

1)   What the fuck does any of this have to do with Barry?   If Fabro
is ticked off at Kief, why doesn't he just sue HIM?  (Oh, that's right
- less money - gotta sue the famous client to really cash in, is that
it?)

2)  I find it terribly hard to believe that Garry would ever be stupid
enough to admit to firing someone outright because of a medical
condition.  That's employer suicide.

3) If this opportunistic money-grabbing is any indication of Libby's
true character, Kirsten was smart to dump his sorry ass.

4) Libby's an idiot.  You don't marry the boss's daughter and then
honestly expect to forever keep a cushy job after the divorce goes
through.  Maybe L. should stop acting like a whining baby and try to
support himself through his own talents for a change.  (And, after
this, Libby - who on earth would be crazy enough to hire you?  Or are
you betting a settlement will give you early retirement?)

5)  Kief should fire himself for ever paying that guy $180,000 a
year.

I hope the judge laughs it out of court.

The implications of this law suit could be crushing for Barry and his
family.

My belief would be that if a suitable settlement isn't made, Libby could
well find other means of cashing in.

If you go to:
http://www.aolcdn.com/tmz_documents/0905_barry_docs_wm_01.pdf

You can read the whole suit filed, including dates of emails between Kief
and Fabro.

As I said in my original post, the timing of this suit is really off - not
that there's ever a good time to sue!

I too wondered why it wasn't Garry being sued directly, but I take your
point Brenda.

What's sad for Barry is that the media is picking this up and running
with it without giving the complete details (that Libby was married
and divorced from his boss's daughter, etc.).

And I've now seen 2 other outlets running the same blurb with the same
freakin' typo - this is from Contact Music:

MANILOW SUED BY FORMER EMPLOYEE

Veteran singer BARRY MANILOW is at the centre of a legal battle over
his treatment of a former employee, according to reports. Former tour
manager Liberato Fabro - who worked for the star for seven years - has
filed a case against Manilow, claiming he was given $15,000 (GBP7,500)
in medical bills instead of being allowed to file a worker's
compensation form after a knee injury in 2005, according to TMZ.com.
Fabro further alleges Manilow and his production company, BMPI,
discriminated against him over disability and his martial status - and
is also suing for wrongful termination and fraud.

***
I think someone meant to type &quot;MARITAL&quot; status.

&quot;Martial&quot; status?

Kief fired Fabro because he didn't get his black belt in time?

Holy Godzilla, Batman!

Based on what I read, I believe this guy has a legitimate leg to stand
on (despite his bum knee).
Timing is everything in life and he's not so stupid as to pick now to
release details about the lawsuit.
As for why he's suing Barry?  Barry is at the top of the food chain in
this organization and even though he might have been hired/fired by
Garry, he worked for Barry so he would have to be included as a
defendant.

I totally agree with you.  A sensible and reasonable man would have
quit when the couple filed for divorce.  Libby is obviously out after
money. I hope he gets zip cause that's all he deserves.  Kirsten was
wise divorcing this loser.   Btw, Barry's pic and this story is on
TMZ's site this morning.

If it's true (and we don't know that it is) that Garry promised to pay
medical bills in exchange for Libby's not filing workers comp - and
never followed through - you're right.

But the whole firing-him-because-of-his-marital-status is all crap.
Nobody at Stiletto cares if he's divorced.  But EVERYBODY cares if
he's divorced from the future president of the company.  (It would be
interesting to see exactly why Kirsten initiated proceedings in the
first place - hmmmmmmmmm).

I also find it interesting how often Libby's &quot;depression&quot; is
mentioned.

If you're on MySpace, go look up his page (just type &quot;Libby Fabro&quot; in
the people search box).   If that's depression, I'd sure like to give
it a go.

The tell-all book will make fascinating reading. You know that'll be next -
unless of course this is settled out of court and with a huge pay off.

I'm sure that in the next few hours the Fanilows over on the Barry Net
will be baying for Lib's blood.

Martial status?? That's taking the choreography too far. I know Barry is
in Vegas just like Elvis but somehow I can't see Manilow filling out a
white jumpsuit and high-kicking his way through Burnin' Love.

Hi Peter,

Bet it will never see the light of day.  Since this Libby guy
obviously has no scruples, he would sell out Garry and Barry.
However, I am sure G &amp; B 's attorneys made him sign a prenup as well
as a confidentiality agreement so I don't think the money will be
flowing so fast in this idiot's direction.

Good points Sparky. This Libby guy has no scruples and that is what makes
him dangerous. He can easily blackmail Barry; have an agreement with
lawyers and still write a book, sell his story to the tabloids and do what
he can to create damage to Barry and his companies. Marvin

&gt; &gt; &gt; first place - hmmmmmmmmm).

&gt; &gt; &gt; I also find it interesting how often Libby's &quot;depression&quot; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you're on MySpace, go look up his page (just type &quot;Libby Fabro&quot; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the people search box).   If that's depression, I'd sure like to give
&gt; &gt; &gt; it a go.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Brenda

&gt; &gt; Oh, you mean this page? http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;frie; ...

&gt; &gt; If he and his lawyers have half a brain between them, he'd remove this
&gt; &gt; real quick.

&gt; &gt; Susan

&gt; Well Libby didn't take it down, but it's been set to private since
&gt; yesterday.

Nothing is really private on the internet.  If someone really wanted

His My Space page wasn't such a big deal. His friends were, shall we say,
of the scantily clad variety? One of them liked their Martini's &quot;very
dirty&quot; whatever that means. Thanks, but I think I'll stick to my VO and
soda.

So, I was thinking - What if Libby HAS got a case here? What if he's
telling the truth?

When there's a name involved with most legal cases, it's easy to scream
that the one doing the accusing is an opportunist. But what if Garry did
make those promises and did go back on them?

And if Garry did say that Libby's continued employment could make things
uncomfortable, then as much as he has the right to protect his daughter I
am sure that's not a true legally binding reason to fire someone.

I still say if this does get to court all that Garry tries to protect will
come out - and that includes details of his daughters marriage break up.
I also fear that if Libby settles out of court for a huge or un-disclosed
figure it'll make people ask what are they trying to cover up?

Yes, there is more than likely a confidentiality agreement in place but
that could all become meaningless once the terms of his employment are
questioned and if the money's right, no settlement will stop this guy
talking.

I smell a book deal and several appearances on the Vegas club circuit or
The View at least...

Just to add my two cents:

I don't think it should be legal to fire anyone, just because they get
married or divorced.  Garry never should have hired him if he thought the
man couldn't do the job, let alone keep him in his employee for 7 years if
he wasn't doing a decent job.  Even if he was an &quot;employee at will&quot; they
need a better reason for firing him than he divorced the boss's daughter.
I've worked with couples who have divorced and they handled the situation
like adults and nobody had to be fired.

I'm afraid I think the case has merit, but he really should have sued Kief
and the company, not Barry himself.

Kermit

Aside from the divorce issue, I would like to know why he waited so
long after the surgery to take some type of medical leave.

Let's take out the fact that these two were getting divorced... Here
you have two people that work at the same company, that can end up
dividing the company because of loyalities.  I cannot see the working
environment being conducive, and there always being a worry that
sabotoge might occur after the divorce (or even during).

Regardless of who the person is, this person is going through a very
emotional, probably turblant period of time.  To add to it, they have
had a surgery, that for some unknown reason, did not take medical
leave until months later.  Straight out, the medical part is a big
concern for me.  I would of required this person to take medical
leave, merely to keep there from being an future liabilty. As time
ticked on, and documentation was probably left undone, who would be
able to prove he was not forced to work, which ... worsened his knee
and etc....

Honestly, hiring and working with relatives can have issues, such as
this, that come back on you.  You need documentation of each and every
meeting, notes (minutes) that you can file away, and basically cover
your tushie about what was said (not inferred) and what you agreed
upon and that in this there was a 'clear meeting of the minds'...and
then you send them a copy... and ask for any.... 'changes'... Keep all
email that went back and forth on this, including their 'yes, I agree
this is what we met about and what we dicussed and terms we reached'
and then.. file it...

I think if this was the deal, they need to build the case around not
themselves but how his continually working there would affect those
that he comes in contact with, including clients, vendors and such as
well as co-workers.

But in fairness, if Garry did act in this way, he will have to prove
why he did what he did and that it had merit.  I am a manager, and it
is not that easy... I just got done with my Human Resources Management
course and working on IT Mgmt and class (college) for Supervisors..
its not easy stuff.

peace out

Brenda...

But you know, when you have a law suit about hiring and firing,
supervisors 'can' do things to get the company fired, after all, they
are acting with power bestowed upon them by the agency.... sue the
person and the company.  If the supervisor fired you in err, then the
company is also at fault. these two are joined...Why?

Supervisors and managers with the ability to hire/fire, should know
and understand all local, state and federal policies/laws pretaining
to same.  Ignorance of them is no excuse. When a company gives that
person that decision making ability, they are saying 'yes they know
what they are doing'.....

Its moot about Libby being married to the boss'es daughter, its moot
about Libby's hidden agenda, and it's moot about Garry feeling
'uncomfortable' with him being there - working at the same company,
because in the end, Libby probably does have the law on his side in
this.

Garry will have to prove that there are mitigating circumstances and
that things are not as they appear to be.... that he did have due
cause to fire him.  And I sincerely hope he has good documentation...
to back him up.

I read the document, just the first part but ... sorry, it was badly
written... I see few fact and everything keeps making me want to ask
one question.....

If this was all about his 'disability' then why did he wait so long
after the surgery to take medical leave?  Clearly, the firing would
not be due to his disability or it would of been done 'after' the
surgery and 'before' the medical leave.

The dating in the document is weak, and I do have to ask what sort of
person walks into an office and says 'can I take medical leave' and
fills out no forms.  Then actually 'asks' can he come back? The
initial form should of already given him dates, which should be set to
match what the doctor recommended and I agree, during this time period
he should not do anything appearing to be 'work related'.

I hate to say it but he really did a poor ars job of watching out for
himself.  Forms, use them... signatures, get them... agreements -
understand them....

Sorry... hehe....

I can't imagine anyone being that interested in Libby's myspace page
that they'd hack into it, and by now Libby's probably changed anything
he or his lawyers felt might be damaging. By the way, has anyone
actually read the complaint all the way through? It might answer a few
questions some people have asked about why Barry's been named when it
was Garry who fired Libby. I think the whole situation reeks and I
feel bad for not only Barry because of the timing but Kirsten as
well.

Oh and in case anyone was curious, the Bnet regulars have not only
not called for Libby's blood, they decided that Barry's message board
wasn't the place to discuss the matter and aside from a few posts
they're all excited about the concerts this weekend, the PBS taping,
the QVC appearance, and the upcoming media blitz. Unfortunately, some
of them have also entered a state of hormonal bliss at the thought of
being able to claim a new cardboard Barry at the end of this cd's
promotion. I think I'll go take a dramamine now.

Hi Peter,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

If Libby does go that route, I can imagine what he might include about
family gatherings during holidays, Barry's friendship with Garry and
his relationship with Kirsten as his goddaughter, Barry as a boss,
etc.  Kirsten herself will learn a very hard lesson from this
marriage--bet her next marriage will be to someone who is established
in his career and who can support her and, more to the point, the
prenup will come from HIS side.  Daddy Garry does not want to go
through this twice.  Neither does Barry.  What affects Garry and his
family affects Barry cause he is at the top of the pyramid.  I feel
sorry for Barry, especially at this time; he should be happy with the
new album being released, concerts on the East Coast, a PBS Special in
the works, a five-DVD boxed set, a jazzy Christmas CD, etc.
I do have a question:  would there be fewer problems like this for
Barry if he ( and Garry if he were told ) hired fewer family members?
If Barry continues in Vegas until 2010 because of people who would
lose jobs, that is not fair to him.  If they are talented, they will
find jobs elsewhere.  Was Libby as top notch as a tour manager?  I
think not.  Wonder what he did before he married Kirsten....

Ding-ding-ding.  We have a winner!

I think for the most part, Camp Manilow is a family run business.  If
there were any splits or shifts, it'd be nothing but painful and
uncomfortable and a real mess.  Why do they do that to themselves?

Barry is and owns the company.  When you have a company, sooner or later,
this happens.  The solution is money.  All this guy really wants is to
stick it to the whole bunch. The only way is a lawsuit with a big, PUBLIC,
settlement or publicity fiesta. I didn't see attachments of Dr. statements
or sworn affidavits. If the damage is long term or pain/suffering is
permanent, then it's normal to sue if the company doesn't cover all the
bases.                                             This guy is trouble.
Kirsten would be well advised to marry OUT of the business. Hopefully, the
usual non-disclosure forms were obtained at hiring.
If someone failed to honor promises, it wasn't
Barry. Let's face it.  He doesn't handle day to day details.  He hires
people to do it for him. However, the buck stops with Barry.
BUT, whatever happened to this guy, his
future in the business is damaged by the suit. (Shallow consolation for the
Kiefs.)  The damage to Barry's name is going to have a price tag.  Expect
this guy on the talk show circuit; press releases etc. ad nauseum.  He's
after the money now.  Revenge is served cold.
Barry will pay dearly for any mistakes that were made
in his company.  It acts in his name. This stinks big time. Yes, Barry may
have to work extra time to recoup the cost of this unless someone finds a
way to force an out of court,SEALED settlement.
Don't try to play to this guy's soft side. Ever see a tour mgr.
who had one? What possessed Kirsten to marry an obvious player? One look
would tell you this guy is trouble of one sort or another. I know Barry
adores his God children, but I hope she is adult enough to know what a
mess has been made.  Garry probably does act the protective father and
then as a mgr.. That's not always the right way but it is understandable.
Read this mess. The only real
question I had:  Ok, Libby darlin'.  How much to make this all go away and
no book, interviews, nothing but silence about your time in the company?
Name a price. Bet on it.  He will negotiate.  It won't be pretty or cheap.
The issue isn't who did what or said what.  The issue is, quite simply,
I'm divorced and outta work.  What's it worth to Barry to see a fast and
silent end to the whole damn thing? It's Garry.PR, and the lawyers jobs to
do damage control. Act fast and stop the image damage for poor Barry. We
know he sweated bullets over the &quot;Harmony&quot; litigations.  We don't want
this preying on his mind.  Garry should step up and deal with &quot;family
issues&quot; without involving Barry.

I've met Libby several times, and he was nothing short of charming and
gracious to the fans when he encountered us.  He often treated us with
more kindness (as you know, &quot;we can be kind&quot;) than some of the long-term
employees who have seen us at events for years and won't give you the time
of day.

Not that I'm supporting his lawsuit - however, to judge a person by their
appearance just isn't fair  - to say to &quot;look at him, of course he's a
player&quot; !!   We don't know what happened between him and Kirsten, however,
it was painfully obvious that he was out of here life at past conventions.
But, truth be told, there have been several &quot;players&quot; on the Manilow crew
for years and years.  I remember when one truck driver went to check into
the hotel (1988 - we were staying in the same hotel as the band/crew) and
the front desk manager came out with a TUB full of cards and gifts for
him.  The promise of a back stage pass often was very beneficial to
members of the crew.

---------------

This is very true, because it is Barry's company, that is why the
company name should of been pulled in (and not Barry - the person).
They should be two different things.

I dislike the idea of out of court settlements.....and I am hoping
they had him sign a 'non-disclosure agreement' that contained very
specific language.  In the end? I think you may be right ~  all of the
bad press Barry has avoided could come home to roost on this one.

What really happened well... seems too much 'he said this - he said
that' going on and nothing to back it up.  Courts are not stupid and
have played this game before...

I did not read the emails but this is one of those 'be very careful'
about what you send through company email...

Tough call.. really...

But I am curious, seems he cannot make up his mind - either he wants
the money from the divorce settlement or he wants the money regarding
the dismissal because of a disability?  Which one?  Appears he's
trying to use both here.

I cannot exactly feel sorry for someone that did not cover their back
with signatures and documentation... I had to go bankrupt because I co-
signed for my 'then' spouse's cars and when he defaulted..think anyone
cared when they begin garnishing me $550 PER pay check for ONE car?
and $200 per pay check for the other?  (single mom with five kids -
who left home with nothing for a fresh-start)?

NO... no one cared because I got myself into this pickle... I signed
to pay the debt if he did not - he did not - welll duhhh... of course
they came after me.. and .. lesson learned... My divorce - my kids -
my NOT receiving child support (was fighting for it)..... was moot....
I learned, marriage sucks and every decision can come back and bit you
in the ars... Divorce decree did not protect me at all.

So... I don't feel sorry for him.... or Garry.... get it in writing,
ensure the language is clearn and yank in a lawyer if big money is
involved...

Ok, I too will through my two cents in for what it;s worth.
I too am an individual with a disability and I also had an unkind
experience with Stiletto not recently though. So I am not totally
surprised but yes if it happen  in 2006 why now.  The reason he is
problely sueing Barry because technically the companies are in his
name and if he didn't do it  it is his company so that could be a
reason so all parties in the company are named basically the owner and
the one who did the action in this case the firing. Who knows maybe it
will become a federal ADA issue.
Anyway I am sure was aware he was going to be fired but actually
didn't do the firing. He problely said to Gary something like  do what
you feel is best.
Sometimes it isn't such a goodthing to put your complete trust in
someone in business  affairs

&gt; &gt; I still say if this does get to court all that Garry tries to protect will
&gt; &gt; come out - and that includes details of his daughters marriage break up.
&gt; &gt; I also fear that if Libby settles out of court for a huge or un-disclosed
&gt; &gt; figure it'll make people ask what are they trying to cover up?

&gt; &gt; Yes, there is more than likely a confidentiality agreement in place but
&gt; &gt; that could all become meaningless once the terms of his employment are
&gt; &gt; questioned and if the money's right, no settlement will stop this guy
&gt; &gt; talking.

&gt; &gt; I smell a book deal and several appearances on the Vegas club circuit or
&gt; &gt; The View at least...
