Iraqi resistance cites Russian expert accusing the US of instigating
sectarian bloodshed
Arablinks.blogspot.com

March 21, 2007

Iraqi resistance groups, in the course of their regular daily summary
of incidents, (for Tuesday, March 20, under the heading "Baghdad")
yesterday cited an interview by the Russian news agency Novosti with a
Russian military think-tank official, who said among other things that
American "special forces" are instigating Shiite-Sunni fighting in
Iraq. The point came up in the course of the following report about a
mini-bus bombing:

Bomb rips through Kia passenger bus in Baghdad, as mysterious
bombings increase. Russian expert cites US special services as source
of sectarian tension in Iraq.

In a dispatch posted at 1:20pm Makkah time Tuesday afternoon,
Mafkarat al-Islam reported that a bus carrying civilian passengers
exploded in the Baghdad district of al-Karradah according to an
announcement by the puppet police.

The correspondent for Mafkarat al-Islam reported the source as
saying that a bomb went off in a Kia vehicle in a shopping center near
the al-Karrahda area, which is predominantly Shi'i. The source said
that two people were killed and four more wounded. The injured were
ambulanced to nearby hospitals.

The bombing was one of a growing number of mysterious attacks that
have rocked Baghdad on a daily basis, killing or wounding thousands of
Iraqis amidst claims that regional powers are attempting to keep
sectarian violence raging in the country. Since no groups of the
Resistance take responsibility for the mysterious blasts, suspicions
are widely expressed that intelligence services are behind the bombing
campaign.

Russian geostrategic expert Colonel-General Leonid Ivashov alluded
to precisely this reality in an interview with the RIA-Novosti Press
Agency correspondents Valery Yarmolenko and Zalina Tsopanova on
Monday. Ivashov, who is Vice-President of Russia's Academy of
Geopolitical Problems, reviewed America's military and political
defeat in Iraq and noted the failure of US troops to counter the
guerrilla movement, despite America's advanced technological edge and
the primitive armament of the Resistance. Ivashov remarked that, "the
only thing that is working is not being done by the US troops but by
their special services, namely to organize fighting between Shi'ah and
Sunnis."

Here is a summary I prepared using a machine translation of the Monday
March 19 Novosti article:

Americans suffer military and political defeat in Iraq: Expert

Vice president of the Academy of Geopolitical Affairs Leonid
Ivashov said the state of affairs in Iraq demonstrates the military
and political defeat of the USA and warned Washington against
agression against Iran. He said to put it mildly the Americans'
military results are unsatisfactory, in spite of their technological
superiority. Regular army units in the south were easily defeated, but
it was a different story as soon as they met guerilla resistance in
the cities. Pentagon officials looked in Eastern Europe for expertise
on what was done against guerilla formations in the WWII period, but
this doesn't appear to have helped either. The only thing they are
able to do, he said--and not the army but their special services--is
to organize fights between Shiites and Sunnis. High-tech weaponery
such as electronic spy planes and so on have proven absolutely
ineffective. The war has cost over 3000 killed, 24,000 wounded, and
will have $500 billion by end 08. Republicans have lost prestige and
will lose the White House. EU China India and Russia looking for
alternatives to US monopoly on world order. Anti-americanism
everywhere, even among allies in Europe, is helping consolidate
efforts for a new approach. He said Russia can be one of the leaders
of the multipolar world.

Note that Ivashov also "warned [the US] against agression against
Iran", but the point isn't elaborated.

&gt; &gt;  Since no groups of the
&gt; &gt; Resistance take responsibility for the mysterious blasts, suspicions
&gt; &gt; are widely expressed that intelligence services are behind the bombing
&gt; &gt; campaign.

&gt; Alex you have been in this group long enough to know that al-Qaeda's
&gt; policy is never to admit the terrorist operations they did. The only
&gt; exception I know about is 911.

During the WWII Nazi Generals used to translate Tito's name as TOTAL
INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION,  which of course never existed.
Same thing today if Al Qaeda exists it is only in the sick minds of
neocons like yourself, who do the shadow fighting. What exists is a
tremendous resistance to occupation, no less powerful than the
Partizan movement was in WWII
