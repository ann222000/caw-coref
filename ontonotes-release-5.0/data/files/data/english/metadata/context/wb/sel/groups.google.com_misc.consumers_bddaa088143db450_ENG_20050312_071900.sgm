A privacy/computer expert interviewed on the news the other day said
that it's hard to protect your information by deleting computer files
because they're practically never really deleted--that even
formatting a disk doesn't really delete files. Is this true, and if
so, does anyone know how you really delete files on a hard drive or
floppy disk. I thought that formatting a disk did really wipe it clean.

Having dealt with this a little bit at work (where computer disposal is
a problem) - if I deleted a file in Windows by doing a shift-delete, or
going into DOS prompt and typing the delete command, it's still there
on disk but the operating system sees that area as empty space it can
reuse. Theoretically it could be recovered but it would take someone
with special tools and training to do it. So, for example, if you had
something on your hard drive (ransom note ?) you really didn't want the
cops to find, just doing a delete may not be enough.

Next step is the reformat, which in general writes information over the
whole disk so that it can be reused. This also may not actually write
over top of every byte - not sure on that one.

Even if you write over every byte on the drive, somebody with a lot of
resources like the FBI may be able to go a layer deeper and see what
was there before.

For this reason they make disk-scrubber utilities, which over-write
disks several times with random patterns, thus making sure the data you
thought you'd reformatted can really be considered gone. I did a goold
for the words disk and scrubber, it coughs up tons of ads of course,
like cyberscrub.com, diskwiper.com, I have no clue if those are good
products but that's the kind of product you'd want.

"/> Formatting certainly cleans it off to a degree that you and I
are not going to restore it ourselves. However, with enough
money it can be done easily enough. Certainly if the person who
tells you that it will happen is addressed as &quot;Your Honor&quot;, you
can be sure that whoever he hands it to will in fact be reading
your files soon enough!

It's sort of like a telephone conversation. We all know it is
*private*... but that if you put make information available
that you can't tolerate seeing on the front page of your local
newspaper the next day, there will come a day when that is
exactly what happens.

As to really erasing it? Sufficient heat will do the trick. So
can a 20 pound sledge hammer. Essentially you want the
equivalent of a paper shredder for metal. You want the magnetic
media to be seriously deformed and either melted into one piece
or broken into multiple pieces.

a reformat does NOT write over the disk. in order to wipe a
drive you need special programs that not only do multiple writes
to the disk tracks, but also shift the heads slightly and write
*between* tracks. such wiping does multiple writes of varying
bit patterns to make it hard to recover data. a good technician
with special controller software and sensitive reading heads
could probably still recover some of the data that has been
written over, even with secure bit patterns.

if you want to make a drive unreadable, smash it with a sledge
hammer and then melt it in a very hot fire.

"/> Interesting subject. Twenty years I was using a mix of 5 1/4
inch floppy disk drives, with some that were 400K Double Sided
Double Density (DSDD) and some that were 800K Double Sided Quad
Density (DSQD). The DSQD drives had a smaller read/write head
and could put twice as many tracks on the floppy as a DSDD
drive.

However, if an individual floppy has ever been written by a
regular DSDD drive, with the wide head, it can't be used by the
narrow head DSQD drives. The DSQD head would write a narrow
track right down the middle of the wider DSDD track. A DSDD
drive would see both tracks and produce garbage for sure. A
DSQD drive that was perfectly aligned with that floppy could
read it though, but only the drive that wrote it would ever be
that close, and then only if the temperature didn't change
enough to misalign it slightly.

So disks had to be kept separate, depending on which drives had
written to it... and the only way to switch a floppy disk from
use on one type to use on the other, was to degauss it with a
magnet. Easy, right? Wrong...

Everyone has heard about keeping magnets away from floppies, so
I figurd a big old magnet would do a lot of damage if you got it
up real close. Not the case! I put a nice sized speaker magnet
on a floppy... and it didn't do a thing to it! So I got a
bigger one. That didn't do much either, so I went and got a
*big* speaker magnet (about 4 inches in diameter).

That didn't do enough, but it did screw up the floppy so that at
least the data was now half gone!

What I ended up using was two of those 4 inch speaker magnets.
By putting one on each side of the floppy and rotating it around
a couple times so that every part was well covered, the media
was erased.

If in doubt, the 20 pound sledge hammer is the right way to safely
erase a hard disk.

&gt; that it's hard to protect your information by deleting computer files
&gt; because they're practically never really deleted--that even
&gt; formatting a disk doesn't really delete files. Is this true, and if
&gt; so, does anyone know how you really delete files on a hard drive or
&gt; floppy disk. I thought that formatting a disk did really wipe it clean.

"/> This depends on how you format the disk, but for any of the popular
operating systems, you can easily find a utility that will overwrite
unused regions of a disk with zeroes. Its not a big deal.

&gt;I heard that judges can order you to reveal your PGP password and if you
&gt;refuse you get jailed for contempt of court.

&gt;You only chance is to use a very long password that cannot be remembered
&gt;unless your memory is refreshed by daily use : by the time a court
&gt;orders you to reveal it, you can say you forgot your password since you
&gt;haven't used it for weeks, and perhaps an expert on human memory will
&gt;back you up.

"/> There may be other ways around this. Make your PGP password a confession
to a crime. Then plead the 5th amendment.

There are a number of free tools that integrate with Windows Explorer
which &quot;shred&quot; files. Literally overwriting the original data, making
it unrecoverable. Here's a couple:

Thanks. I think that's basically what I needed. I don't need to hide
stuff from the FBI (although the way things are going, we might reach
that point soon!) I just don't want personal data remaining on disks
that I sometimes send out.

But those programs are SLOW. It takes a while to do even a moderate
numbers of files. What about passing a strong magnet over a floppy?

&gt; I just had a shocking discovery about hard drives. Did you know that

&gt; made out of glass? Maybe I'm the last person on the planet to learn
&gt; this, but I sure was surprised, when I decided to destroy a failed IBM
&gt; drive tonight. I began to scratch the platter and it shuttered into a
&gt; million pieces!

coaster is made of aluminum with a skin of copper-colored stuff.
