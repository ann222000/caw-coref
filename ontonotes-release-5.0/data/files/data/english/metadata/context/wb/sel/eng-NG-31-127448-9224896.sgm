Lies, damned lies, and, uh... read for yourself:

The reason they call evolution a theory is because that is what it
is: a theory. Even Darwin himself, near the end of his life,
apparently repudiated it.

In Genesis each day was partitioned off from the other This
records the origin of the weekly cycle. There is no other
explanation for its existence. To accept the theory that life
evolved over long periods of time refutes the evidence of the
weekly cycle. The theory of evolution and the existence of the
weekly cycle are mutually incompatible.

Do us a favour and post a comment there explaining concisely that this
(the &quot;apparently repudiated&quot; bit) is rubbish.  No, not rubbish.  A
wicked dishonest lie (and irrelevant, but skip that).  I think there's

The day is well-defined.  The week is man-made.  The month is loosely
related to the moon.  The year has definite astronomical meaning.

The 'weekly cycle' is a figment of your imagination.

A sidereal month is (a bit less than) 28 days.

You can divide 28 by 2, 4, 7 or 14, to slice the month into useful
(more or less) even segments.

You wind up with 14, 7, 4 or 2 &quot;weeks&quot; per month, depending on which
you choose.

4 seems the most useful to me.

Point... ;-)

How about outlawing any indication/promotion of *any*
holiday earlier than 10 days prior to the holiday's date,
violations to be punished by forcing the violator to wear
headphones playing a single tune appropriate to the
particular holiday, preferably one as annoying as possible,
and at just below the threshold of hearing damage. The perp
could remove the headphones for 8 hours/day to sleep; we
don't want to be inhumane. ;-)

If it catches on we could apply it to elections...with a
random sampling of campaign speeches taking the place of the
music, and no sleep time off.

Sounds like a reasonable alternative; actually, that would
be &quot;five or six days, with occasional modification&quot;. And
again, the &quot;extra&quot; days could be whenever we wished; I'd
assume most people would prefer an extra holiday during warm
weather, say between whichever months would be about halfway
from the vernal equinox to the summer solstice.

What would *really* be good would be to redefine the second
(and by derivation, the minute and hour) so each day was
composed of 10 hours, each hour divided into 100 minutes of
100 seconds. But given the truly horrendous task of changing
all the reference material *that* will never happen. It
could, since the length of the second is arbitrary, but it
won't. The year/day relationship, of course, isn't a
candidate for &quot;decimalization&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;jatsunr ... @yahoo.com&gt;:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A sidereal month is (a bit less than) 28 days.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That's a lunar month.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can divide 28 by 2, 4, 7 or 14, to slice the month into useful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(more or less) even segments.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You wind up with 14, 7, 4 or 2 &quot;weeks&quot; per month, depending on which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you choose.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;4 seems the most useful to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'd go for 12 months of 30 days each, with the extras as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;intercalary days (5 and sometimes 6) inserted between the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;two months of popular choice, and treated as holidays. Each
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;month to have either 6 5-day or 3 10-day weeks. The year
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would always start on the same day of the week, as would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;each month. Get rid of that &quot;30 days hath September&quot; crap
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;once and for all; we no longer need to honor specific Roman
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;emperors by making &quot;their&quot; months longer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;May I suggest names for the months?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Vendémiaire (from Latin vindemia, &quot;vintage&quot;) Starting Sept 22, 23 or 24
&gt;&gt;&gt;Brumaire (from French brume, &quot;mist&quot;) Starting Oct 22, 23 or 24
&gt;&gt;&gt;Frimaire (From French frimas, &quot;frost&quot;) Starting Nov 21, 22 or 23

&gt;&gt;&gt;Nivôse (from Latin nivosus, &quot;snowy&quot;) Starting Dec 21, 22 or 23
&gt;&gt;&gt;Pluviôse (from Latin pluviosus, &quot;rainy&quot;) Starting Jan 20, 21 or 22
&gt;&gt;&gt;Ventôse (from Latin ventosus, &quot;windy&quot;) Starting Feb 19, 20 or 21

&gt;&gt;&gt;Germinal (from Latin germen, &quot;seed&quot;) Starting Mar 20 or 21
&gt;&gt;&gt;Floréal (from Latin flos, &quot;flower&quot;) Starting Apr 20 or 21
&gt;&gt;&gt;Prairial (from French prairie, &quot;meadow&quot;) Starting May 20 or 21

&gt;&gt;&gt;Messidor (from Latin messis, &quot;harvest&quot;) Starting Jun 19 or 20
&gt;&gt;&gt;Thermidor (from Greek thermos, &quot;hot&quot;) Starting Jul 19 or 20
&gt;&gt;&gt;Fructidor (from Latin fructus, &quot;fruits&quot;) Starting Aug 18 or 19

&gt;&gt;Nice! I can go along with all of these except Messidor; in
&gt;&gt;most of the northern hemisphere the major harvests are quite
&gt;&gt;a bit later than the summer solstice, more like the autumnal
&gt;&gt;equinox.

&gt;I have no clue what the French were harvesting then. Maybe wheat? I know
&gt;peas are also ready, but that's about it.

Perhaps maidens...? ;-)

&gt; weather, say between whichever months would be about halfway
&gt; from the vernal equinox to the summer solstice.

&gt; What would *really* be good would be to redefine the second
&gt; (and by derivation, the minute and hour) so each day was

&gt; 100 seconds. But given the truly horrendous task of changing

&gt; could, since the length of the second is arbitrary, but it
&gt; won't. The year/day relationship, of course, isn't a
&gt; candidate for &quot;decimalization&quot;.

It's only reasonable until you count the days involved in (28 * 15) +
5. (^_^) It was a specific fictional reference, and I wondered if
anybody would catch it.

My bad; sorry.

Of course, if you made it *13* months of 28 days each... ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 100 seconds. But given the truly horrendous task of changing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all the reference material *that* will never happen. It
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could, since the length of the second is arbitrary, but it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; won't. The year/day relationship, of course, isn't a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; candidate for &quot;decimalization&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        It's only reasonable until you count the days involved in (28 * 15) +
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. (^_^) It was a specific fictional reference, and I wondered if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anybody would catch it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Crap! I assumed (bad idea) your math was correct and didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; bother to check it; I was more concerned with nitpicking
&gt;&gt;&gt; your &quot;5 days&quot; (nitpicking without basic fact-checking is
&gt;&gt;&gt; *another* bad idea) and getting on to my screed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; My bad; sorry.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, if you made it *13* months of 28 days each... ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt; And what's the reference you mentioned? Not one of those
&gt;&gt;&gt; idiocies from the Creationist or Expanding Earth asylums, I
&gt;&gt;&gt; hope?
&gt;&gt;        Alas, no. Nothing so interesting. It's from a roleplaying game called
&gt;&gt; &quot;Exalted.&quot; (Yes, I am a geek.)

&gt; Aha! OK, I'm not into RPGs, except those I used to play
&gt; against the computer.

I'm not into RPGs either.  I stick with the lowly ol' shotgun.

I thought that RPG was pretty much replaced by COBOL. Unless, of
course,  your business started on the IBM 1401 and you never upgraded.

You can have the COBOL, I'll take the shotgun.

That occurred to me, but I figured I'd use the abbreviation
anyway. But it also occurs to me that a few claymores
scattered around the property would be a nice option. ;-)
