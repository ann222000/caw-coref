&lt;&lt;Girona (Catalan: Girona, Spanish: *GERONA* ) is a city located in the
northeast of Catalonia, Spain on the confluence of the rivers Ter and
Onyar. The first inhabitants in the region were Iberians. Later, the
Romans made a citadel there, which was given the name Gerunda. The
Visigoths ruled in Girona until it was conquered by Moors. Finally,
Charlemagne reconquered it at the end of the 8th century. Guifré I
incorporated Girona to the county of Barcelona in the 9th century.
Alfons I declared Girona as a city in the 11th century. The 12th
century sees a flourishing of the Jewish community of Girona, with
*one of the most important Cabalistic schools in Europe* . The Rabbi
of Girona, Nahmanidis or Bonastruc ça Porta, was appointed Great
Rabbi of Catalonia. The history of the jewish community of Girona
ends in 1492, when the Catholic Kings expel all the Jews from Spain.
Today, the Jewish ghetto or Call is one of the best preserved
in Europe and a major touristic attraction.&gt;&gt;

_____  *OARING*
_____  *GIRONA*

&lt;&lt;The *GIRONA* set out from Killybegs with the surviving crews of
two other shipwrecks and all their accumulated valuables &amp; cannons.
Once again, increasingly bad weather was encountered which resulted
in the rudder being damaged off Inishowen, now they found themselves
being blown by gale force winds towards the north coast, the power
of the *224 (32 x 7) ROWERS* could do nothing to keep the ship
offshore and she finally struck Lacada Point on October 28th, 1588.&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;The Girona was a Galleass of the Spanish Armada, she carried  a
compliment of 121 sailors, 186 soldiers, 50 bronze cannons and 224
rowers, though when she struck Lacada Point on October 30th 1588, it
is estimated that she had a compliment of around 1200 men on board.
This came about as follows:- The 2nd in command of the Spanish Armada
was Don *ALONSO* Martinez Levia who was aboard the ' Rata Santa Maria
Encoronada', the 'Encoronada' carried a compliment of 420 sailors and
soldiers plus 35 cannons, the ship had proven difficult to manoeuvre in
the winds around the west coast of Ireland and had received a severe
battering by gales before finding shelter in Blacksod Bay, County Mayo.
Dropping anchor, Don *ALONSO* intended to get fresh water and supplies,
repair some minor damage and  wait for a break in the weather before
heading south again. The winds though held strong and the anchors proved
incapable of holding the 900 ton ship, she was gradually blown ashore on
Fahy Strand, Ballycroy. The crew stripped the ship of cannons, stores
and other valuables and set her alight, they then made their way to
nearby deserted Doona Castle which they are said to have fortified with
cannon in preparation for a confrontation with English troops who had
local allies and were active in the area. Another two ships (and maybe
more) arrived in the locality,  the *SANTIAGO* which subsequently
foundered at Poulatornish, Broadhaven and the 'Dunquesa Santa Ana'
which also anchored in  Blacksod Bay. The 'Dunquesa Santa Ana ' had 23
guns, 280 soldiers and 77 sailors on board,  for Don Alonso and his men
it was a godsend. They carried out minor repairs to her, took aboard
fresh water, loaded what had been salvaged from the 'Encoronada' and
set sail hoping to locate other ships of the scattered fleet. Again,
they encountered strong gales which drove them northwards and into
Donegal Bay, the winds did not abate and they were eventually driven
ashore near Ardara in Loughros Mor Bay where the ship foundered. Having
got ashore, a local gave them assistance and shelter, word came that
other Spanish ships were located further along the coast, with his
compliment of men (estimated to have been around 1000) complete with
cannons and valuables, Don Alonso marched  northwards and discovered
that three ships had come in on the gales at Killybegs. The 'Girona' was
undergoing repairs to a damaged rudder sustained in the gales and the
other two, the  'Lavia' and *SAN JUAN* had both foundered. This time,
instead of heading south towards Spain, Don Alonso decided to take the
'Girona'  northwards to Scotland where he believed they could find
relative safety, recuperate and  then make their way back to Spain from
there. The 'Girona' set out from Killybegs with the surviving crews of
two other shipwrecks and all their accumulated valuables and cannons.
Once again, increasingly bad weather was encountered which resulted in
the rudder being damaged off Inishowen, now they found themselves being
blown by gale force winds towards the north coast, the power of the 224
(32 x 7) rowers could do nothing to keep the ship offshore and she
finally struck Lacada Point on October 28th, 1588.  There a varying
accounts as to the numbers who survived, some say three, others five
and some nine,  those that did survive are said to have received shelter
and  assistance from Sorley Boy MacDonnell of Dunluce Castle.
*The rest is folklore* . Stories tell of victims, perhaps even Don
ALonso himself (who knows?) being buried in St. Cuthbert's Graveyard
at Dunluce and others, of survivors settling and marrying into the
local population.  Another fascinating insight into the conditions
endured by survivors was recorded by Francisco De Cuellar who survived
a shipwreck and walked across the north west of Ireland, he made it
across to Scotland and eventually back to Spain.&gt;&gt;

The Spanish Armada and the Wreck of the Girona
.
&lt;&lt;In the late 16th century (1588) Philip II of Spain had sent an
impressive Armada of over 100 ships to invade England a quarrel between
the two countries at the time involved both religion and politics. The
Catholic Phillip II and the Protestant Elizabeth I of England where
between them for their own ends struggling for control of the Atlantic.
.
All did not go well for Philip and after a number of encounters with
Elizabeth's ships the Spanish fleet fled north in an attempt to round
Scotland and Ireland towards the Atlantic. Between September &amp; October
severe North Atlantic storms sank almost 30 Spanish ships of the coast
of Ireland, many sailors were drowned at sea.
.
Those who were fortunate enough not to perished at sea where however
given no less a violent welcome on Irish soil as the Celtic chieftains
murdered the shipwrecked sailors and looted all they could from the
stricken galleons. The nearby Dunluce Castle once had two of the ships
cannon as part of its defence. On learning of the disaster that had
befallen his Armada, Philip II is said to have remarked that he had
sent them to do battle with the English, not the elements.
.
One such Spanish Galleon to flounder was the Girona, sank of the Port
na Spanish the ship was found by a Belgian Archaeologist Robert Sténuit.
The Girona's treasures having been successfully located and recovered
was acquired by the Ulster Museum and forms part of a permanent display

&lt;&lt;Amongst others of the Secret Society were the Careys or Carews. Four
of this family were engaged in the Virginian enterprise. John, helped
with the Revels at Court, and supplied properties. Richard is described
as a writer chiefly on Topgraphy. He died in 1620. His brother George
was knighted by Queen Elizabeth, and is the reputed author of an account
of France and of the Court of Henri IV of France. This work, however,
was not published, or (we believe) heard of until 100 years after his
death, which occured in 1614. This *Sir George Carew* was, from early
youth to latest age, very intimate with Francis Bacon; we are therefore
fully prepared to learn that George and Thomas Carew were, Poets--that
Thomas was also a dramatist, and that he is said to have written the
Masque entitled, &quot;Coelum Brittanicum,&quot; which was performed before the
Court at Whitehall in 1633, and greatly admired. In fact, all these
men were Bacon's &quot;Masks,&quot; engaged in publishing his works.&gt;&gt;

George CAREW (1st E. Totnes)
Born: 29 May 1555
Acceeded: 7 Feb 1625/6
Died: 27 Mar 1629, The Savoy, England
Buried: 2 May 1629, Stratford-on-Avon, Warwickshire, England
Father: George CAREW (Sir)
Mother: Anne HARVEY
Married: Joyce CLOPTON 31 May 1580, Stratford on Avon.

Children:
1. Peter CAREW
...............................
&lt;&lt;Born on 29 May 1555. Second son of George Carew and Anne, daughter
of Sir Nicholas Harvey, who was first archdeacon of Totnes, in Devon,
next dean of Bristol and chief chanter in the cathedral of Salisbury,
afterwards dean of the king's chapel and *dean of Christ's Church* ,
Oxford, lastly dean of Exeter and Windsor.
.
George was educated, like the father, at Broadgates Hall (afterwards
Pembroke College), Oxford, where he stayed from 1564 to 1573, and was
created M.A. at a later date, 17 Sep 1589. From an early age he devoted
himself to military pursuits. In 1574 he entered the service of his 1st
cousin, Sir Peter Carew, in Ireland. In 1575 he served as a volunteer in
the army in Ireland under Sir Henry Sidney, and after filling the post
of captain of the garrison in Leighlin for a few months in 1576, in the
absence of his brother Peter, was appointed lieutenant-governor of the
county of Carlow and vice-constable of Leighlin Castle in 1576.
.
In 1578 he held a captaincy in the royal navy, and made a voyage in the
ship of Sir Humphrey Gilbert. In 1579 and 1580 he was at the head first
of a regiment of Irish infantry and afterwards of a regiment of cavalry
in Ireland. He was made constable of Leighlin-bridge Castle in 1580, on
the death (in a skirmish, 25 Aug, with the Irish) of his brother Peter.
Shortly afterwards Carew killed with his own hand several Irishmen
suspected of slaying his brother, and was severely censured by the
home government for him impetuosity. The Queen, however, showed
much liking for him, and the Cecils were his friends. He became a
gentleman-pensioner to Queen Elizabeth in 1582; sheriff of Carlow
in 1583; and was knighted by his friend the lord deputy of Ireland,
Sir John Perrot, on 24 Feb 1585-1586.
.
He served (1588?92) as Master of the Ordnance to Queen Elizabeth.
.
He took part in the naval expeditions to Cádiz (May 1596) and
the Azores in 1597, when he was Member of Parliament for Queenborough.
In May 1598 was for a short time an envoy to France, when his
companion was Sir Robert Cecil.
.
He was appointed (27 Jan 1599/1600) lord president of Munster,
presumably recommended by his friend Sir Walter Raleigh. At the time
the whole of Ireland was convulsed by the great rebellion of Hugh
O?Neill, Earl of Tyrone. Essex's attempt to crush it failed miserably,
and Carew's relations with the Cecils did not make his advice congenial
to Essex. When Lord Mountjoy was nominated Essex's successor, the
powerful support that Carew lent Mountjoy chiefly enabled the latter
to suppress the revolt. At Kinsale he did especial service, and the
successful raids he made on neighboring castles effectually prevented
the Spaniards from landing in the country after their ejection.
Like all contemporary English officials in Ireland, he ruthlessly
drove his victory home, and the Irish peasants of Munster
were handled with his utmost vigour.
.
As soon as Ireland was pacified, Carew sought to return to England.
His health was failing, and the anxieties of his office were endless,
but while Elizabeth lived his request was overlooked. On Lord Mountjoy's
resignation of the lord-deputyship in May 1603, Carew was allowed to
retire, and Sir Henry Brouncker was promoted to the presidency of
Munster. James I on his accession treated him with marked attention.
Early in Oct 1603 he became Queen Anne's vice-chamberlain, and a few
days later (10 Oct) the receiver-general of her revenues. He was
Member of Parliament for Hastings in the Parliament which met
in 1604, and appointed councillor to the Queen on 9 Aug 1604.
.
On 4 Jun 1605 following he was created Baron Carew of Clopton House,
near Stratford-on-Avon, the property of his wife Joyce, daughter of
John Clopton, whom he married in 1580. On 26 Jun 1608 he was
nominated master of ordnance, and held the post till 5 May 1617.
.
He was keeper of *Nonsuch House and Park* in 1609, of which he was
reappointed keeper for life 22 May 1619, councillor of the colony
of Virginia (23 May 1609), Governor of Guernsey (Feb 1609/10),
commissioner to reform the army and revenue of Ireland (1611),
a privy councillor (19 Jul 1616).
.
Carew visited Ireland in 1610 to report on the condition of the
country, with a view to resettlement of Ulster, and described Ireland
as improving rapidly and recovering from the disasters of the previous
century. In 1618 he pleaded with James I in behalf of Sir Walter
Raleigh, with whom he had lived for more than thirty years on
terms of great intimacy, and Lady Carew proved a kind friend
to Raleigh's family after the execution.
.
In 1621 Carew received, jointly with the Duke of Buckingham and
the Viscount Cranfield, a monopoly for the manufacture of gunpowder.
At the funeral of James I in 1625 he was attacked with Palsy, which
nearly proved fatal. But he recovered sufficiently to receive a few
marks of favour from Charles I, to whose friend Buckingham he had
attached himself. Member of the important council of war to consider
the question of recovering the Palatinate (21 Apr 1624), and
treasurer-general to Queen Henrietta Maria (1626).
.
Carew was created Earl of Totnes on 5 Feb 1625/6. In the following
month the House of Commons, resenting the action of the council of war
in levying money for the support of Mansfield's disastrous expedition,
threatened to examine each of its members individually. Totnes expressed
his readiness to undergo the indignity and even to suffer imprisonment
in order to shelter the King, who was aimed at by the commons, but
Charles proudly rejected Totnes's offer and prohibited any of the
council from acceding to the commons' orders.
.
The Earl died on 27 Mar 1629 at his house in the Savoy, London, and
was buried in the church of Stratford-on-Avon, near Clopton House.
An elaborate monument was erected above his grave by his widow,
with a long inscription detailing his military successes (Dugdale,
Warwickshire, 1730, ii. 686-7). He left no children. Sir George had
a son, named Peter Carew, who died young during his father's life.
.
Carew had antiquarian tastes, and was the friend of Camden,
*Sir Robert Cotton* , and Sir Thomas Bodley. Camden thanked Carew
in his 'Britannia' for the aid he had given him in Irish matters
(ed. Gibson, 1772, ii. 338). He collected material on the history of
Ireland, used later by his secretary, Sir Thomas Stafford, to prepare
the important 'Pacata Hibernia; or, An Historie of the Late Warres of
Ireland' (1633). Sir Thomas Stafford was probably, though the evidence
is incomplete, a natural son of the Earl of Totnes. Stafford served
under Carew, when president of Munster, as captain in the wars in
Ireland during Elizabeth's reign. When Carew died in 1629, it was
intended that Stafford should be buried in the same tomb at
Stratford-on-Avon, and an inscription (printed in Dugdale's
Warwickshire, ii. 686) was engraved on it describing Stafford's
career, leaving the date of death to be filled in. That was
never done, and it is uncertain when Stafford died (he was
alive in 1639) and whether he was buried in Carew's tomb.
.
Carew by his will, dated 30 Nov 1625 and proved on 29 May 1629,
bequeathed to Stafford his vast collection of manuscripts relating to
Ireland, the greater part of which, consisting of thirty-nine volumes.
He spent much of his leisure in constructing pedigrees of Irish
families, many of which in his own hand are still extant. From
Stafford the manuscripts and books passed to Archbishop Laud.
Sir George names in his will his great nephew, Peter Apsley.
.
From Burke's Extinct (London, Harrison, 1883) Sir George Carew, born in
1555, married Anne, daughter of Nicholas Harvey. He was Vice Chamberlain
to the Queen, Lieutenant General of the Ordnance, Lord President of the
Province of Munster, in Ireland, created Baron Carew of Clopton, co.
Warwick, on 4 May 1605; and, in the first year of Charles I, on
7 Feb 1625, he was created Earl of Totnes, co. Devon. A great lover
of historical antiquities, he collected charters and
wrote an historical account of his time in Ireland.&gt;&gt;

...............................................
&lt;&lt;In the 1590s [Sir Thomas Egerton] was a vigorous promoter
of the career of Sir Francis Bacon. John Donne the poet became
his secretary. Another of his secretaries, *GEORGE CAREW* , was
presented with a copy of Arcana arcanissima by Michael Maier and
probably provided hospitality to Maier whilst serving as ambassador
in France. In 1610, when Egerton's son James was killed in a duel,
*Robert FLUDD* and his servant were interrogated by a law officer
for the light they could throw on the affair. Presumably *FLUDD*
had been in attendance on the dying man. Egerton's third wife, the
shrewish Alice, was the widow of Ferdinando, 5th Earl of Derby,
whom Professor Honigmann argues with some trenchancy had been an
early patron of the Bard. A fierce Protestant, if not quite a
Puritan, Egerton originally a good friend to the Earl of Essex
before his fall from grace was to bind himself strongly in
alliance with William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, and the
Earl of Southampton, both famous patrons of Shakespeare.&gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;The first salvage attempts were made within months, on the coast of
County Clare by *Sir George Carew* who complained at the expense &quot;of
sustaining the divers with copious draughts of usequebaugh [whiskey]&quot;.

Sorley Boy MacDonnell recovered 3 brass cannon and
2 chests of treasure from the wreck of the Girona.
.
In 1797 a quantity of lead and some brass guns were raised from
the wreck of an unknown Armada ship at Mullaghderg in County Donegal.
Two miles further south, in 1853, an anchor was recovered
from another unknown Armada wreck.

&lt;&lt;The Girona had anchored in Killybegs harbour while two other ships
had been lost on attempting to enter the harbour. With the assistance of
an Irish chieftain, MacSweeney Bannagh, the Girona was repaired and set
sail in mid-October with 1,300 men on board, including *ALONSO* Martinez
de Leyva. Lough Foyle was cleared, but then a gale struck and the Girona
was driven ashore at Dunluce in County Antrim, Northern Ireland.
.
There were 9 survivors, who were sent on to Scotland
by Sorley Boy MacDonnell; 260 bodies were washed ashore.
.
In 1967 and 1968, off the coast of Portballintrae a team of Belgian
divers brought up the greatest find of Spanish Armada treasure

foundered on Lacada Point at the Giant's Causeway in 1588,
local folklore tell of victims being buried in St. *Cuthbert's*

a 'St Columcille Cross' named after the Irish saint, this was
taken along with other valuables after Sir John Perrott took
the castle on instructions from Queen Elizabeth in 1584.
The castle has seen lots of sieges &amp; battles in its years,
Sorley Boy eventually went to live in Dunaneenie and
the castle came into the possession of his son Randal McDonnell.
Randall set about restoring the castle and built a lavish

in the ill-fated *FENTON* voyage to the East Indies,
for which he may also have purchased a ship, the
Edward Bonaventure (Taylor 14, 19). Along with
the Leicester and the Talbot, the Edward Bonaventure
set out for the Moluccas under the command of
Captain Edward *FENTON* in May of 1582. Having
started out too late in the year to round the Cape,
*FENTON*, upon arriving at Sierra Leone, decided to
cross the Atlantic to Brazil and sail through the
Straits of Magellan to the Pacific. An attack by three
Spanish warships off the coast of Brazil put an end
to these plans, and *FENTON* set sail for home,
reaching England in May of 1583 (Routh, 425-6).&gt;&gt;

.         THE  MERRY  WIVES  OF  WINDSOR
http://www.dlroper.shakespearians.com/merry__wives__of__windsor.htm
.
&lt;&lt;The sub-plot to this play is taken directly from Edward de Vere's
youth, spent in the household of his guardian, Lord Burghley. Even
the characters' names are recognizable. As a ward of court from the
age of 12, the Earl of Oxford's upbringing was given over to the
charge of William Cecil, later Lord Burghley. At Cecil House, in
London's Strand, young Edward was joined by another ward of similar
age, Edward Manners, the 3rd Earl of Rutland. Both young men grew
up together in company with their guardian's daughter, Anne,
six years younger than Edward.
.
The Merry Wives of Windsor takes up the story much later,
when marriage plans were being considered. Lord Burghley had
subsequently met young Philip Sidney, the 17 year-old Earl of
Leicester's nephew, and saw him as a potential husband for his
daughter. Against this, Burghley's wife, Lady Mildred, was
already looking more favourably upon her husband's ward,
Lord Rutland. But Anne had eyes only for Oxford.
.
In the play, this little drama becomes the sub-plot. Sidney was cast
as Master Slender, a name that aptly fitted his physique. Manners
was named Caius after the famous Roman lawyer whose Institutes in
the reign of Justinian came to form the legal basis for the Corpus
Juris Civiles. This naming is especially apt because Manners went
on to enjoy a distinguished legal career and, but for his sudden
death in 1587, was on the threshold of being elected to the
highest office in English law, that of Lord Chancellor.
Anne Cecil retained her Christian name as Anne Page.
Oxford, as one of the principal characters, adopted the name
*FENTON* for himself. This too was apt, because in 1575,
a writer, named Geoffrey *FENTON*, had sought permission to
dedicate his book, Golden Epistles, to the former Anne Cecil.
His endearing address to her left no doubt that she had
won the man's heart. Her father, Lord Burghley, the most
influential figure in Elizabethan politics, but a continual
source of agitation in Oxford's life, was given the servile
name of Page. His wife, Mildred, became Margaret, and
Sidney's uncle, Lord Leicester, is identified as Shallow.
.
As the play develops, so the characters are given dialogue that
reveals what had happened behind the scenes at Cecil House, at a
time when Anne's choice of husband was at issue. It also provides
one of the major reasons why the influential Cecil family were so
emphatically opposed to Oxford being known as Shakespeare; they did
not wish to be identified, since this would inevitably lead to their
private family matters becoming a butt for lower-class ribaldry.&gt;&gt;
