While I appreciate your enthusiasm, posting your show every time it is
updated is frowned upon here. And this is not the first time you have been
informed of this. It sets a bad precedent for others. If everybody thinks it
is ok to post their shows, than this would turn into a podcasters spam fest.
There is a separate group for that.

I'm also getting it crossposted to the Google group, so I get it twice. not
fun. Please stop.

last I read it was cool to post when a special guest is on the show,
last week we had a member of The Rascals - this week a television
star on TLC

Doesn't that qualify?

If every week is "special" then special ain't so special.

To me, it's if the particular episode is of interest to the other members of
the group -- ie, pertaining to podcasting or podcasters.  I like listening
to "Groovin'" as much as the next guy, but I'm not sure the Rascals count.
Now, if the "star" from the Learning Channel is launching a podcast... that
might work.

I know sometimes you might ask yourself "How can I be sure" when it comes to
this stuff.  Hope that provides a ray of hope... Do you feel it?

But special to who? If we all listened to your show, than ya, it would be
special. But seeing as this is the podcasters group, I am doubting that the
majority of us would find a rabbi and a rascal that special. When you reach
your 50th or 100th show, need critique, or have a special interview that
would be of special interest to your fellow podcasters, by all means, share.
But being special every week gets old. All people start hearing is WOLF!

Actually, my special guest on my next episode was going to be a wolf.  I
guess I'll move right on to the vampires now...  &lt;grin&gt;

BTW, I was raised by wolves, and now my Mom doesn't get to be on the show.
And it's all your fault.

OMG. THis is so funny.  About 2 years ago, I interviewed Shmuley's very obese mother on
Lincoln Road in South Beach for Yeast Radio. it wasn't intentional- just happened to run into
someone who was very vocal about her politics and I had to argue with her... It was a
memorable exchange to be sure. Do you have a link for the episosde itself? Please email to
rich ... @bluestein.com.
Thanks,Richard Bluestein
