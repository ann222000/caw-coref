My friend the tank has been after me to get my level 70 preinst into a
heroic with him. My priest has about +900 heal with buffs. I'm not
sure if that is adequate but I can give it a shot.

He thought I needed another Steamvault run to get the rep for a heroic
key but I noticed that I just had to turn in a quest and I'd be
revered. So I get the key and we head into the Slave Pens (Heroic
Mode) with a retro pally, a mage and a rogue. Turns out the rogue
could not get in because he has done the Pens within the last 24
hours. So they want to do the Steamvaults. My friend tells me to pul
out because he wants to do the Pens. The rogue and his friend the mage
are now in their own group and we get another rogue and a warlock and
head into the Pens.

Now I don't want to make excuses but for lag to occur on my PC for my
first battle in a heroic - that is just so not fair. My guess is that
by the time I saw the lifebars down they were down even further and by
the time I got my casts off the players did not have any life despite
my screen showing life. It was awful. And the warlock's succubis did
not produce a seduce after the rogue sapped. Well what's it matter, I
had a bad tiem for PC lag. I did make it out the portal before I got
piled on. I ress everyone and re-buff. I also call up task manager and
shut down all redundant processes and that helped my PC.

But then they start a pull before I am ready and to make matters worse
I think after the rogue sapped it was the succubis that did the
pulling because all the crabs piled on her. I did get some heals off
but to be honest I am gonna take a wild guess and say that starting a
fight when the priest is not ready and using the succubus to pull are
not at the top of the list for things to do in a heroic dungeon.

We leave and go into the Steamvaults.

Ahh that was so much better. SUCCESS!! I feel like I can keep people
alive again. But that was the first two in the front. Time for bigger
packs now.

The first set of nagas I see there is still a problem because after a
sap I never see the succubus successfuly get off a seduce. Despite the
warlock and me getting big time aggro I manage to keep everybody alive
through the fight. I am feelinnmighty powerful as a healer now.

We take out the big bog lord that is around the corner and I feel like
there is hope.I am feeling like I am a heroic healer now and I can do
anything that is needed.

We take out some more nagas but once again I see the succubus get
slapped around and lying on the floor with her ass up in the air like
a pin cushion awaiting some manner of vile penetration. Was this some
type of fantasy that the warlock enjoyed seeing his feisty demoness
take part in? Well we survive another hairy battle so no problem. And
with this being another successful healing job by me I want to yell
out &quot;I am the lizard king, I can do anything&quot; with apologies to Jim
Morrison.

Now what was next? Oh yes the elementals. The warlock was supposed to
banish one. The tank pulls and the lock banishes one but something
strange happened - some of the elementals went after the lock. He is
getting pounded and my healing is working on him and because I turned
my attention to heal him the tank was getting beat on and I let the
tank die. Well I did not let him die but I think you get the picture
of the situation. Because idiot me healed the lock the tank died. But
to be honest given how that fight went from the start and comparing it
to the non-heroic version I would say we were doomed from the get-go
of that battle. Something just did not seem right with the lock
getting pounded on so early.

If my GM reads this she will probably greet me with a &quot;WARLOCK TANK&quot;
when I join WoW tonight. Heh heh, we have these little musings we pass
back and forth every now and then.

But feelings of inadequacy return and I wish to muster up the
wherewithal to pull off another successful healing within a battle.

So we resotck ourselves at the place again for another try.

Now I'm not going to make a claim to know everything there is about
heroic dungeons and the same about warlocks, but I don't think I need
a Master;s Degree in Political Science or Mathematics to theorize that
a warlock does not pull a group of elementals in Heroics Steamvaults
to the party by using BANISH. No way man! No how! Or am I a fool and
it is something that any lock can carry out any day of the week? I am
sure my GM will straighten me out on this seeing as how she
specializes in warlocks, or witches if you prefer the female version.
I mean if the warlock was totally justified in doing so then so be it
- I'll admit that I am crying out for nothing. Of course it might have
helped if I knew he was going to do that so I could have placed the
Prayer of Mending and Renew on him instead of the tank and I could
have bubbled him as well. That might have helped a little but I would
not bet my house on the final outcome. Once I started healing the lock
I got piled on. I thought the meleers would have been able to pull
aggro before I pulled some off the lock but they had too far to run to
catch up to that spot.

Now we call it a night and I tell you I know I need more experience in
Heroics but to have the rogue tell me I need more practice before she
leaves... huh? With a lock pulling the pack by using BANISH? I need
more practice? At what? More practice at teaming with players who wish
to try out crazy experiments in Heroic Dungeons? It may have been my
first heroic but I think there are pretty standard things that one
does and does not do and I have been educated well in most of them by
my guild, my friends and by posters here. My GM feeds much helpful
info over the course of our playing even if we are in different zones
as do a few others in the guild.

Although I was eager to step into the place and give it a try I think
that either I have to go back and continue in a few plain ol' level 70
dungeons and do so with players who at least have an idea of generally
accepted dungeon principles.

I'll take the blame for my PC lagging but I cannot guarantee that I
will be able to keep the group up on every pull gone bad in a heroic,
at least not at this time. I just have not seen enough idiotic things
happen (or have I?) to know the perfect improvisation techniques that
each and every comical unjustified whimsical experiment by others sets
before me.

But hey I am having a shitload of fun and I would not give it up for
the world.  I can only laugh and move on and continue to do those
things that people here and in WOW have educated me on - uh, the
correct things that is.

Okay so if the lock was justified in doing that let me know so I can
humbly state that I'm still a noob and I am pwned by the lowest of
trash mobs.

Three cheers for the heroic dungeon(s)

OH! OH! OH!

Damn, Orion, you sure have leveled fast! I so enjoy reading your tales (the
succubus description - I may never be able to play my warlock alt without
laughing!).

Now, I've stopped playing my priestess for awhile (level 68), so I can't
comment on your experience in a heroic instance - except to say don't blame
yourself for the lag last night. WoW was having big problems with servers. I
had trouble getting in.. and at one point, even though my connection showed
green, I was lagged in a spell, d/c'd and dead when I returned. From the
number of 'spirits' I saw at the graveyard at the same time, I suspect it
wasn't just me.

&lt;snip great story&gt;

I've never run a Heroic SV, but I HAVE run Heroic SP many times.  A
Warlocks' Succubus is never a reliable form of CC in Heroic Slave
Pens.  About 1 in 3-4 times it will work.  And those lobsters hit very
friggin hard.  I know of only one Warlock that can survive in there
when his Seduce fails and that only in the first part because he can
fear yo-yo them.  Further in you can't always do that.

The only real difference between normal instances and Heroics are that
the enemies hit much, much harder and take longer to kill.  I'm a
rogue with about 8900HP buffed and I've 2-3 shotted by those lobsters
on more than one occasion when a pull goes bad and my evasion timer is
up.

I have a team from my brothers guild that has Heroic SP on &quot;farm&quot; so
to speak.  Warrior, Priest, Hunter, Rogue, Warlock.

Hunter Ice traps and a Mages Polymorph are a friggin god-send in
Heroics.  Find a good Ice Trapping hunter and invite him to your
group.  Not having to worry about 1 mob through an entire pull is very
very nice.  Sap is fantastic in normal dungeons because normally you
can DPS down 1-2 mobs in a pull before Sap is up and the other mob
comes running, not so in Heroics.  Sap lasts 30 seconds and if you're
group is really on the ball you can DPS one mob (the skull) down and
start on another before Sap breaks, then you're tank has to pick him
up before the healer dies.  :)  Don't trust Banish or Succubus in
Heroics and you will have much less frustration and more fun runs.
I'm not saying don't use them, at times you have to, but just don't
trust them and keep an eye on the MoB that they're applied to :)

Sounds to me like the warlock has a death wish. You shouldn't have wasted
mana trying to keep him alive. Nothing wrong with using banish, but he
definitely should have waited for the tank to engage before he casted it. As
far as your lag issue, sometimes the server stability just suxxors, and
that's when I choose to work on tradeskills and such, rather than trying an
instance. We'll probably see lots of lag in the upcoming weeks while they
get ready to introduce the voice chat option.

+900 healing? You're not ready for a heroic.

I've been farming a lot of heroics, several that people would classify
as &quot;hard&quot;, and I would say that +1500 healing and 7500 health after
buffs, is like the baseline heroic healer.

I'd take a lesser geared healer for the easy heroics, like Mechanar or
Slave Pens, maybe +1200 healing and 6500 buffed health, but that's my
bottom line.

Yeah, that's a high bar, higher than a beginning Karazhan healer. And
yes, healing a heroic is harder than healing Karazhan.

You basically need crafted epics, reputation gear, blue gear from
level 70 dungeons, and good enchants to reach this gear level.

You also need experience at healing under pressure, so my preference
for any heroic is a healer with a lot of honor kills to his name. When
things go crazy, you want a healer who knows how to survive.

It's not a big deal for the easy heroics, but when you get into the
medium heroics, like Black Morass, Durnholde, and Sethekk Halls, you
get pulls where the healer always generates too much aggro, because
there are just too many mobs around, so someone who can take care of
themselves is a godsend.

Yeah I was concerned that +900 was not gonna cut it. I was thinking
today that some more rep with some factions and rewards could get me
better equipped.

The pressure probably will not be a serious issue down the road. As a
former player of hardcore Diablo:LOD I have had many an exciting
adrenaline rush while being chased around the Chaos Sanctuary avoiding
Diablo's LBOD with my son cheering me on from behind.

I know that is not the ultimate in comparison to a heroic WoW
instrance however there is a lot to said a bout losing a toon forever
to death after 70+ levels in a world where there is no such thing as a
corpse run, at least for the player who just died. It does do
something to build a determination that boils deep within the soul.

I love rogues for heroics. Cripple kiting with a rogue + ranged dps is
easily my favorite way to handle the hard hitting, non-CC'able pulls
that you always find in heroics.

However, I would beg to differ and say that if your group cannot kill
one mob before the sap breaks, your dps players aren't ready for the
heroic. Everyone has to have good gear in a heroic, not just the tank
and healer.

As for warlock spells, I agree. You have to assume banish, seduce, and
chain fear break early (I love chain fear). But it's not limited to
warlock spells, sheep always break early, shackle always breaks early,
and traps alway break early too. You just have to be on the ball with
CC.

The PoM was on the tank. Once I saw them heading for the lock I
probably should have recast it on him. But given how fast his life
went down on arrival the PoM would have only initiated the first heal
on him right? Three elementals charging a lock? I think perhaps that I
have to cast that FADE right after I heal the lock (see exchange
between Ashen and myself in another post) and buy a little more time
in hopes that the meleers will grab that aggro before it heads to me.

Given what I have learned and witnessed, okay perhaps it might be
something that can be accomplished but I think everybody in the group
would have to know that it was the plan of attack so that they could
make adjustments. The rogue and pally were moving towards the tank
when the elementals charged and of course the elementals blew right by
and headed towards the lock.

I gotta go.

However, i disagree with your gear specifications. :)  If someone is
already decked out in Epics, why run the Heroics?  Gear from Heroics
is barely any better than crafted stuff except in specific instances.

You are highly experienced with Heroics and I'm not.  However my rogue
is in all dungeon blues, 1650 (roughly) Attack Power unbuffed, 150 Hit
rating.  My Hemo crits are over 800 now.  I have about 7500HP
unbuffed, in my PvE gear.  I can switch out a couple of pieces and
push that number to 8000, but I lost a little over 50AP doing that.
In your estimation, Am I wearing bad gear to be doing Heroics?

There really is no better gear I can get without PvPing for an insane
amount of time, or running Kara.  Which requires a much steeper gear
check as far as stamina is concerned than I can afford.  And an older
guild that doesn't have any of my Real Life friends in it.  :(

I AM PvPing in Arena's and BG's as often as I can, but I'm not a
&quot;power-gamer&quot;, so full veteran's gear and Arena weapons are a looooong
ways off for me.  :)

You might also want to consider re-evaluating your talent spec.  I'm
no expert but it seems to me the points you have (or had last time I
checked the Armory) in Shadow talents (currently 18 or so) would be
better spent in Discipline talents(currently none) if you're planning
on being the main healer in Heroic runs.

Sounds similar to my rogue's gear and I have no trouble in heroics...
granted I normally go with people who are in epics, but I'd be ok in a

Your health sounds the same as mine and no-one's said mine is too low for
Kara. I've only been in there on my rogue for the first time this weekend
though, and only for 3 bosses, but I had no trouble and even did pretty
decent damage (2nd on my meters for Attumen/Moroes), so gearwise you're
probably fine for it. May want a little more for some bosses (Aran comes to
mind) but that'll come with time.

That sounds excessive tbh; it's what to aim for, sure, but not that

If the lock got aggro from multiple mobs simply because he banish-pulled, his
threat level would have been minimal, so the tank should have been able to pull
them all off him with an AoE spell like thunderclap or demorlaizing shout.

Similarly, if he has minimal aggro because he banish-pulled, then as soon as
you heal him all the mobs on him would come to you (not good), but here Fade
would probably help (you, that is, not the lock since they'd all go back to
him!).

PoM is a bit of a gamble in these situations - it's great because it's instant
cast, but the downside is that the recipient of the PoM also gets the aggro
from the healing done, making it that little bit harder for the mob to be
pulled off.

What would I have done? Tricky question. Probably shield/renew the lock, fade,
and hope the tank is quick (or if there's a mage, hope the mage is quick to
frost nova).
Or use the Soulstone to res everyone ;-)

It's been a long time since I played my warrior (she's still stuck at
level 60) but whenever a group of mobs gets anywhere near me on a pull i
automatically do demoralizing shout and/or thunderclap to grab them all.
If the mobs actually ran straight past the tank, I'd suggest the tank was
a bit slow.

&gt; You might also want to consider re-evaluating your talent spec.  I'm
&gt; no expert but it seems to me the points you have (or had last time I
&gt; checked the Armory) in Shadow talents (currently 18 or so) would be
&gt; better spent in Discipline talents(currently none) if you're planning

Thanks foo,

Seeing as how I am still doing a lot of solo killing for quest gold I
planned to hold those 18 points in shadow for the time being. They
really come in handy. I was going to do a respec for endgaming, but if
heroics warrant an endgaming build then yes I shall surely have to
consider respeccing sooner than I anticipated.

Plus that means I am going to have to perhaps drag the wife along
along and turn the soloing for quest gold into a family matter and get
that gold sooner.

Perhaps I could consider the epic flyer and then a final build. We
shall see.

But good advice, I thought the raids needed more of the end game build
I anticipated and I have to consider that it will be sooner.

&gt; &gt;  went down on arrival the PoM would have only initiated the first heal
&gt; &gt;  on him right? Three elementals charging a lock? I think perhaps that I
&gt; &gt;  have to cast that FADE right after I heal the lock (see exchange
&gt; &gt;  between Ashen and myself in another post) and buy a little more time
&gt; &gt;  in hopes that the meleers will grab that aggro before it heads to me.

&gt; If the lock got aggro from multiple mobs simply because he banish-pulled, his
&gt; threat level would have been minimal, so the tank should have been able to pull
&gt; them all off him with an AoE spell like thunderclap or demorlaizing shout.

&gt; Similarly, if he has minimal aggro because he banish-pulled, then as soon as
&gt; you heal him all the mobs on him would come to you (not good), but here Fade
&gt; would probably help (you, that is, not the lock since they'd all go back to
&gt; him!).

&gt; PoM is a bit of a gamble in these situations - it's great because it's instant
&gt; cast, but the downside is that the recipient of the PoM also gets the aggro
&gt; from the healing done, making it that little bit harder for the mob to be
&gt; pulled off.

&gt; What would I have done? Tricky question. Probably shield/renew the lock, fade,
&gt; and hope the tank is quick (or if there's a mage, hope the mage is quick to
&gt; frost nova).
&gt; Or use the Soulstone to res everyone ;-)

&gt; &gt;  Given what I have learned and witnessed, okay perhaps it might be
&gt; &gt;  something that can be accomplished but I think everybody in the group
&gt; &gt;  would have to know that it was the plan of attack so that they could
&gt; &gt;  make adjustments. The rogue and pally were moving towards the tank
&gt; &gt;  when the elementals charged and of course the elementals blew right by
&gt; &gt;  and headed towards the lock.

&gt; It's been a long time since I played my warrior (she's still stuck at
&gt; level 60) but whenever a group of mobs gets anywhere near me on a pull i
&gt; automatically do demoralizing shout and/or thunderclap to grab them all.
&gt; If the mobs actually ran straight past the tank, I'd suggest the tank was
&gt; a bit slow.

I forget how many ran past the tank. How many smaller elementals are
in that group? It might be that one of them was engaged by the tank
and he did not even know that the others had slipped by.

I'll tell him what MIGHT have happened so he can watch for that on
those risky pulls in the future.

And yes I did aggro them right after the heal. I should have used fade
but I got hit so fast and hard that I used the (I forget the name)
heal that instantly lifts me for a shitload, what's it called?
desperation heal? nah thats not it, but I think you get the picture.

I just had not seen enough experince in that type of heady duty
situation to improvise well enough. Putting this thread here helped.

&gt; &gt;buffs, is like the baseline heroic healer.

&gt; That sounds excessive tbh; it's what to aim for, sure, but not that
&gt; necessary. It's better if the rest of the group is good if you're low
&gt; geared, but 1500 is a lot... I started healing heroics with 1000-1200 I
&gt; think, struggled a bit, I'll admit, but never that badly as long as it was
&gt; a good group.

&gt; &gt;I'd take a lesser geared healer for the easy heroics, like Mechanar or
&gt; &gt;Slave Pens, maybe +1200 healing and 6500 buffed health, but that's my
&gt; &gt;bottom line.

&gt; &gt;Yeah, that's a high bar, higher than a beginning Karazhan healer. And
&gt; &gt;yes, healing a heroic is harder than healing Karazhan.

&gt; Some parts of Kara, I'd agree, I must admit I fall asleep on the trash on
&gt; the way to Attumen these days, but I don't call the likes of Prince or
&gt; Nightbane easier to heal than a heroic, especially when it comes to not
&gt; going oom. Illhoof is a nightmare as well; flash heal is barely enough for
&gt; the sacrificed person and you just can't afford the time for gheal :-/

&gt; &gt;You also need experience at healing under pressure, so my preference
&gt; &gt;for any heroic is a healer with a lot of honor kills to his name. When
&gt; &gt;things go crazy, you want a healer who knows how to survive.

&gt; I have no HKs, and don't consider pvp any kind of preparation for instance
&gt; healing. It's totally different. And the people I've grouped with seem to
&gt; consider me a good enough healer at heroic level...

&gt; &gt;It's not a big deal for the easy heroics, but when you get into the
&gt; &gt;medium heroics, like Black Morass, Durnholde, and Sethekk Halls, you
&gt; &gt;get pulls where the healer always generates too much aggro, because
&gt; &gt;there are just too many mobs around, so someone who can take care of

&gt; Or take a pally tank; no healer aggro in those situations ;-) I don't like
&gt; doing most heroics with a warrior tank, because unless they're very good I
&gt; do end up with aggro, but it's no problem with a paladin.

As usual your posts are enlightening!

Still +900 might have been pushing it for me given my experience.

And now I just ran out of the fish that has +44 and have to send my
hunter to Terokar to catch me a batch.

I'm gonna try for a little bit more but I think I'll ask my friends to
stick with the Underbog Heroic at least to the first boss the packs
are smaller sized.

Despite what you may have heard, Holy builds and soloing aren't
mutually exclusive. Most of the time Zent is puddling around the
outlands on his own grinding for mats and gold and manages just fine.
Maybe not as fast as some other builds but one on one i'll tackle just
about anything. Some points in Disc plus some Holy talents would allow
you to solo just fine and improve you're ability to heal. Check for

Hehe I've sadly been turned off holy soloing of late, perhaps because my
healer build is very badly suited to it, but it's just really painful
currently. Probably if I went back to the build I had while levelling I'd
enjoy it again, just right now whenever I try to solo it's slow, I take a
ton of damage, and go oom faster than I like.

Which makes me really sad, as I loved soloing from 1-60, not sure why it's
so much harder now, as the talents I dropped shouldn't be the ones that
have much impact on my damage; I still have surge of light and the 10%
extra dmg on smite and holy fire :-/ Sometime I'll take a respec and see if
I can make it work for me again, only annoying thing is I'd then want to
respec again to get back to healing mode and it could get expensive fast.

Interesting - I've not done a huge amount of soloing since I hit 70 (every now
and then I do a bunch of quests to earn cash/rep, but on the whole I'm more
often in instances) but I don't have a problem with it.

I do have 5 points in Spirit Tap to reduce downtime between fights, but I think
the main thing that makes a difference is geat - what sort of +spell damage
do you have? (I think I'm on about +650 with my damage gear).

Mind you, I still prefer my hunter for soloing :-)

650 spelldmg here too. I did a little soloing earlier and it was better
than I'd thought it would be, but still nothing like as good as it was back
in 1-60 days... but then I don't have spirit tap or imp shield any more,
which I always did when levelling, same for wand spec. Guess I need to
respec to make soloing work again!

I think that is good CC you had. I can't wait to get my hunter into a
heroic or even a level 70 dungeon. BTW our tank mentiond to me
yesterday that he has been in random high instances with the lock and
that the lock is constantly doing bizarre shit and puls. One time he
had to tell him to lay off on what he was doing so the group was able
to get through an area that he was causing wipes at.

I'm gonna practice up some more and pray for the right combo of tons.
I pick the warrior, my wife's rogue, my priest, a mage we know and
perhaps a random hunter.

So nice job on yoru heroic. you do know that I am somewhat jealous.
Ahhh, only a little and your stroy wil linspire me to continue

&gt; &gt;Interesting - I've not done a huge amount of soloing since I hit 70 (every now
&gt; &gt;and then I do a bunch of quests to earn cash/rep, but on the whole I'm more
&gt; &gt;often in instances) but I don't have a problem with it.

&gt; &gt;I do have 5 points in Spirit Tap to reduce downtime between fights, but I think
&gt; &gt;the main thing that makes a difference is geat - what sort of +spell damage
&gt; &gt;do you have? (I think I'm on about +650 with my damage gear).

&gt; &gt;Mind you, I still prefer my hunter for soloing :-)

&gt; 650 spelldmg here too. I did a little soloing earlier and it was better
&gt; than I'd thought it would be, but still nothing like as good as it was back
&gt; in 1-60 days... but then I don't have spirit tap or imp shield any more,
&gt; which I always did when levelling, same for wand spec. Guess I need to
&gt; respec to make soloing work again!

+650? hmm, I don't feel so inadaquate with my +550 and that might even
be before the food buff. Plus I can alternate my two trinkets.

Yeah I have two sets of gear. One for dungeons or where serious
healing is needed and another for killing.

Maybe if I have a set plan with the wife for going and finishing all
the undone quests together, maybe then I can dump the few shadow
talents into the disciplined - or when it becomes obvious that I am
going to be sending the priest into heroics a lot and the discipline
is the difference between us living and dieing.

Not all heroics are equal... Slave pens is easy. I dunno about SV.
I've heard that Mechanar and Underbog are also quite easy in heroic
mode, but I haven't seen those yet.
