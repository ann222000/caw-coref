Can Lung Cancer Be Prevented?

Article Description:
====================

Lung cancer is the most fatal form of cancer in the US, and other
developed countries, today. And the fact is, that most of the
cancer treatments that work well on other forms of cancer often
don't work well on lung cancer. Add to that the fact that lung
cancer is often not diagnosed until it is far advanced, and it's
easy to understand why this disease is so often fatal.

Can Lung Cancer Be Prevented?

Lung cancer is the most fatal form of cancer in the US, and other
developed countries, today. And the fact is, that most of the
cancer treatments that work well on other forms of cancer often
don't work well on lung cancer. Add to that the fact that lung
cancer is often not diagnosed until it is far advanced, and it's
easy to understand why this disease is so often fatal.

So, preventing lung cancer is even more important than preventing
many other types of cancer simply because the prognosis is often
so poor. And, for most victims of this disease, it is entirely
preventable – simply by not smoking. Eight out of ten people
diagnosed with lung cancer each year are smokers.

Six out of ten people who are diagnosed with lung cancer will die
within one year. Between seven and eight will die within two
years. Treatments are improving, and today there are some long
term lung cancer survivors. But, as we focus on better
treatments, we cannot lose focus on prevention.

Of course the simplest way to prevent lung cancer is not to
smoke. But, there are some other things you can do to help reduce
your risk of lung cancer, whether or not you smoke.

The first is to eat a healthy diet, rich in fruits and
vegetables. Some studies have shown that people who eat a diet
lacking in fruits and vegetables have a higher risk of lung
cancer than those whose diet offers a wide variety of such
foods.

In addition to not smoking, it's important to stay away from
others who smoke. Secondhand smoke is just as dangerous as
smoking yourself. The American Cancer Society reports that
non-smoking spouses of smokers are 30% more likely to get lung
cancer than spouses of non-smokers. In addition, exposure to
asbestos, arsenic and radon increase your risk of lung cancer.

Add Green Tea to Your Diet

Another little known trick for helping protect your body from
many types of disease, including many forms of cancer, is
drinking green tea. Green tea has been shown in many studies to
be effective at protecting health and preventing disease. This is
because green tea is filled with anti-oxidants – some of the most
powerful available.

Anti-oxidants are very effective at combating free radicals that
are created in our bodies as we process food. The free radicals
produced by our bodies damage our cells and our DNA, and
eventually lead to disease if we don't combat them.
Anti-oxidants, however, combat these free radicals before they
can cause damage. If we're getting our fair share of
anti-oxidants each day, we're keeping these free radicals under
control.

Above I mentioned that scientists believe that a diet rich in
fruits and vegetables helps prevent lung cancer. This is also
likely due to the fact that fresh fruits and vegetables are good
anti-oxidant sources. Some vegetables and fruits are better than
others, so for optimum benefit, be sure to include some of the
most powerful in your diet on a regular basis.

The best food sources of anti-oxidants include:

* Artichokes
* Asparagus
* Red Beans
* Blueberries
* Pomegranates
* Dark Chocolate
* Tomatoes

And, green tea. One of the most important anti-oxidants is EGCG,
which is found in abundance in the Camilla sinensis (tea tree)
plant. Green tea is the best form of this anti-oxidant because
it's not fermented during processing. Black tea is fermented,
which changes some of its anti-oxidant compounds. Black tea is
still healthy, but your best anti-oxidant source is green tea.

One study recently reported by the UK Tea Council shines light on
green tea's ability to prevent lung cancer. In particular, this
study showed that green tea appears to have two major functions
that prevent cancer.

Green tea appears to cause apoptosis of abnormal cells. Apoptosis
is the orderly process of cell death. Cell death due to apoptosis
is good, because it is a process of killing off damaged or
unneeded cells. Green tea seems to help the body rid itself of
potentially harmful cells by inducing the process of apoptosis.

Green tea also seems to help prevent lung cancer by inhibiting
the growth of the abnormal lung cells. So, green tea keeps the
cells from growing and spreading until the apoptosis can kills
the cells off. These two powers help to rid the body of abnormal
cells before they can replicate and cause a problem.

Of course, more research is needed to pinpoint exactly how green
tea works, and how we can use it best to prevent lung cancer and
many other diseases. However, in the mean time, there's no
reason not to make green tea part of your daily life.

Green tea is an absolutely safe beverage to consume. It has no
side effects, and even those who are caffeine sensitive can
usually tolerate green tea quite well, because its caffeine
content is very low compared to coffee and sodas. So, do
something good for yourself – drink some green tea!
