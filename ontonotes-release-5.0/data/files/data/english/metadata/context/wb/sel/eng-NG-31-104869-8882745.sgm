Inmate advocates call for independent oversight

rler ... @thnt.com AVENEL — Inmates are powerless to address harassment and mistreatment by custody staff at state facilities such as East Jersey State Prison, stoking tensions, prisoner advocates say.
OAS_AD('Right3');

&quot;There are terrible things that go on in our prisons, and the methods of redress are puny in comparison to the problems that exist,&quot; said Jean Ross, a retired public defender and co-chair of the prison committee at the Newark-based People's Organization for Progress.
Currently, the DOC's own Special Investigation Division investigates issues of misconduct. Advocates say that's a conflict of interest that skews against prisoners.
&quot;There (ought) to be independent oversight,&quot; Ross said.
Advocates say they receive a steady stream of letters from inmates alleging abuse by corrections officers. The most consistent complaints include unreasonable strip searches, excessive force, harassment by officers, and theft of jewelry and other valuables by officers, advocates say.
In Oct. 2006, prisoners at Trenton's New Jersey State Prison went on a hunger strike to protest abuse by corrections officers. Larry Hamm, chairman of POP, met with Department of Corrections Commissioner George Hayman to negotiate on their behalf.
&quot;When people who are under lock and key, under armed guard, step outside of the status quo, they put themselves at risk. So if people are going to put themselves at risk, there must be something to what they're saying. Our experience has been that the same grievances keep coming up year after year,&quot; Hamm said.
Prisoners who allege wrongdoing have a number of options for redress, from writing complaints within the institution to filing a lawsuit, but advocates say all of these methods expose inmates to a risk of reprisals.
Inmates report that complaints filed through institutions are often ignored, said Donna Brewer, executive director of prisoner-advocacy group Garden State CURE Inc. Inmates also report frequently that the officers they complain about retaliate against them, Brewer said.
DOC spokesperson Deirdre Fedeknheuer said the department keeps complaints in locked boxes in an effort to prevent interception.
The Office of the Corrections Ombudsman in the state Department of the Public Advocate directs prisoners to exhaust attempts at the internal complaint system before contacting the ombudsman. The ombudsman received 10,469 complaints in 2006, of which 272 were allegations of harassment. Of those, 50 came from inmates at East Jersey State Prison.
Lawsuits, too, generally require a paper trail to be successful — as well as financial resources and legal expertise, which are in short supply among prisoners, advocates say.
Letters addressed to known advocates can also be risky, Brewer said.
Yet problems behind bars don't necessarily stay inside the prison. If left unremedied, festering resentment can become a community's problem later, advocates say.
&quot;The social end of it is, people don't stay in prison for a lifetime. Seventy-five percent of the people in now are going to be released back into the community,&quot; said Steven Young, chairman of the New Jersey NAACP Prison Project. &quot;If they are abused in prison, that abuse trickles out into the communities. They can come out into the community and do the community harm. It becomes everybody's problem.&quot;
Those with loved ones behind bars also are affected.
&quot;The men at EJSP are someone's father, son and husband, and should be treated as such,&quot; Brewer said.
Yet inmates face a challenge in the greater community, which tends to turn a blind eye to their problems, advocates say.
&quot;Who is really going to defend (prisoners) when the guards are doing wrong? My brother, incarcerated for accessory to murder, who's going to take his side over a prison guard? How does anyone do that?&quot; said Adam Berrios, a Jersey City native.
