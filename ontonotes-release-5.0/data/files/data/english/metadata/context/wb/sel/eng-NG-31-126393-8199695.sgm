7.6 Trespasser Disinformation Tactics

This is a list of the disinformation tactics that the that
the anti-Linux propagandists who post in COLA have been using.
All of these tactics have been used in COLA by the anti-Linux
propagandists against the Linux advocates and the rest of the
COLA readership to further the cause of the anti-Linux
propagandists. This list has been worded as though you are one of
them, so that you can better see through their eyes how they think.

13. Embarrass your opponent.  Locate or create apparently
embarrassing information or detail and utilize it out of all
proportion-trying to create a scandal around it, to hijack a
thread or drive everyone to distraction.

23. Lie.  Lie, lie, lie, lie.  If you do it often enough you may
create the appearance of truth.

Come off it DFS, you know perfectly well that you work where the money is,
take the contracts that are on offer, it doesn't matter what the OS is,
it's the cheque that's important.

I call myself a UNIX man, but I've developed for Windows too. That doesn't

down a particularly good contract that involved Windows platforms.

Do you use Windows to do your development for Windows? Do you use
Windows to test your code? If not, I fear for your customers. If so,
well, you use Windows. I never understood the correlation between what
OS people use, and how smart they are. Most people simply do not give
a shit. If you honestly cared about what OS people were using, you
wouldn't be developing for Windows (assuming of course that you really
are anti-Microsoft, and it isn't just some charade). I have no problem
with you guys making money using and developing for Windows. But if
you're going to spout off anti-Microsoft bullshit while making money
because of them or using their products you're just as hypocritical
and morally corrupt as you claim Microsoft to be.

&gt; admin&quot; and &quot;hardware maven&quot; Hadron Quark, aka Hans Schneider, aka Damian
&gt; O'Leary?
">

Here's what a &quot;double standard&quot; is to a troll:

Joe:    Linux is this, Microsoft is that.
Bill:    Linux is that, Microsoft is this!
Nad-hor:    Double standard!  Double standard!
Whoop!  Whoop!  Whoop!

Hell, even after years of DEC and HP &quot;minicomputers&quot;, I spent a couple
decades developing (application) code almost exclusively for DOS and
Windows.  And I used DOS and Windows for doing (amateurish) MIDI music.

So I was a &quot;Windows user&quot;, and &quot;Windows programmer&quot;, even though I had a
background (not very deep) in UNIX, DEC's RSX-11 and RT-11, and HP's
RTE-IV, and hence didn't have a very high opinion of DOS or Windows.

Ironically, just as Windows started becoming at least a shade of what
Bill Gates endearingly, if laughably, called &quot;the UNIX killer&quot;, I
discovered Linux, and could now afford a machine with something akin
to my favorite OS on it.  And not only that, the developer community
was/is even more open than Microsoft's community (there was a time when
it costs real money to learn anything), and so it was much
easier to dig deeper, and actually get into some system's programming.
In the process I've learned more about UNIX and computing in general,
and learnt most of it running Linux machines.

Of course, that's just my path, and I don't really believe most Windows
users are dumb -- it's really that most computer users aren't very
experienced with the paradigm, and their OS provides nice deep pits with
spikes coated with malware.

Microsoft and Windows do have some nice technology, and if they were
more open about it, and less homicidal to the interests of others, they
could be real contributors to open-source.  Of course, the company's
main interest is business, which is somewhat crippling to the more open
interests of the programmers there, I think.

As for the trolls?  Idiots and assholes, even if they score a point now
and then.

How do you think dictatorships are broken? Also is Microsoft

Are they forcing you to use Windows to run your business? Go to

Verily I say unto thee, that High Plains Thumper spake thusly:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [H]omer: Microsoft is an evil scam.
">

I've never used that phrase, not that it makes much sense anyway - how
can Microsoft be a scam? Perhaps you meant that Microsoft have /done/
something that is a scam? I'm quite prepared to believe it; certainly
the Xbox 360 fiasco might qualify.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Gates Foundation invested in an oil plant in Nigeria just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to make money.
">

I've never used that phrase either, although it is true. Not that I have
a problem with any company making money, my issue is with the fact that
the Gates Foundation purports to help people on the one hand, but then
invests in companies that cause much of the suffering and deprivation to
those same people in the first place. It's called &quot;ethics&quot; - something
with which Gates is apparently unfamiliar.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I love open source.
">

I've never used that phrase either, although it may be inferred from my
leanings. In point of fact I prefer &quot;Free Software&quot; to &quot;Open Source&quot;.
The two are not necessarily the same.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DFS: Where were you in 2005?
">

You've never asked that question. You didn't need to, since I publicly
announced it at the time, and IIRC you responded by asking me what the
job was.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [H]omer: making money
">

Yes I made money, but unlike you I don't feel the need to brag about it
every minute of the day. IMCE the type of people who brag about money
are invariably those who never had any, i.e. the nuevo riche, and the
motivation for bragging is usually the fear of losing it.

I hate to burst your bubble, but making money is not the pinnacle of
human achievement, and like they say - you can't take it with you when
you die. If your best accomplishment in life is &quot;making money&quot; then you
must lead a very sad existence. So tell me DooFy, what will /you/ be
remembered for?

As for me, yes I did earn a living. /Shock horror/ yes I made money. Can
you believe it? I actually went out and /worked/ for a living, and
people had the audacity to /pay/ me for the privilege. Incredible but
true. Even more incredible ... I then took that money and /invested/ it,
in Unit Trusts no less. Good grief, earning money *and* investing it,
what is the world coming to?

But here's what I didn't do; I didn't screw people over, I didn't sell
them something that lacked integrity, I didn't extort money out of
people or blackmail them, I didn't lie to them, in fact I didn't expect
them to do anything that wasn't entirely justified. In my work (at
least) my life has been entirely ethical. I earned every penny.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; working on proprietary software
">

First, I didn't &quot;work on&quot; any software, I merely took the clients
specifications, passed them back to the office, received the completed
packages, installed them, restored backup data, integrated the new
system with several existing support systems, monitored and tuned the
systems, engaged in several meetings with the client, took notes, wrote
several reports, and came home. At no time did I /create/ any software
(discounting scripts).

As for it being proprietary software, it was a bespoke solution,
tailored specifically to the clients requirements, and as such of little
use to anyone else. Much of what the client used was in fact Free
Software (e.g. the LAMP stack). The engineering software comprised
several solutions from disparate vendors, including many embedded
systems for logging and monitoring equipment. The bit that I replaced
was over a decade old and unsuitable for the type of drilling work they
were about to do. In the mix of licenses was proprietary, BSD, GPL, and
others. At no point did I work on, or even witness, any Microsoft software.

And what does any of this have to do with my advocacy of Free Software?

Nothing.

Free Software is my preference. I'd very much like /all/ software to be
Free Software, and I advocate as much at every given opportunity. If it
were up to me then that would in fact be the way of things, but since I
am not ruler of planet earth I don't get to make that decision, and so I
must live and work in a world that is less than perfect, as do we all.

Living in an imperfect world, whilst wishing it could be better, is
*not* hypocrisy. Trying to *make* it a better world, is not hypocrisy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; [quote] 23. Lie.  Lie, lie, lie, lie.  If you do it often enough you
&gt; may create the appearance of truth. [/quote]
">

DooFy's biggest lie is that we're all hypocrites for denying that we're
as obsessed with money as he is. I'm sure he'd like to believe that.
After all, nobody likes to be alone.

7.6 Trespasser Disinformation Tactics

2. Distract your opponent from the issues at hand by accusing
your opponents of being &quot;petty&quot;, &quot;pathetic&quot;, &quot;childish&quot; or any of
a number of other such terms.

17. Don't substantiate your claims.  Refuse to present evidence
to support your invalid claims. Repeat your invalid claims and
have your anti-Linux propagandist comrades do the same. Do the
same for any invalid claims that you have notice your anti-Linux
propagandists comrades make.

23. Lie.  Lie, lie, lie, lie.  If you do it often enough you may

Example of Microsoft jihadism:

1. Fool people for 5 years into thinking your releasing a &quot;ground
breaking&quot; OS.

2. Just before release, remove any and all features that would make a
real change from the previous OS.

3. Be sure to double the licensing fees.

4. Unleash to product to almost universal distain and criticism.

5. Watch as people turn away from your OS and core Office products
holding their noses.

6. Ignore doing things like improving the product or listening to the
customer and continue to spend billions on advertising to insist how
great the product is, even though its unsaleable except through
racketeering and coercion.

gobshite.  In reality, what he is doing is best expressed in the

Paraphrasing from &quot;The Joy of Linux&quot; by Michael Hall &amp; Brian
Proffitt:

Troll--An individual who regularly posts specious arguments,
flames, or personal attacks to a newsgroup, discussion list, or
in email for no other purpose than to annoy someone or disrupt a
discussion. Trolls are recognizable by the fact that they have no
real interest in learning about the topic at hand--they simply
want to utter flame bait. Like the ugly creatures after which
they are named, they exhibit no redeeming characteristics, and as
such, they are recognized as a lower form of life on the Net, as
in, &quot;Oh, ignore him, he's just a troll.&quot;
