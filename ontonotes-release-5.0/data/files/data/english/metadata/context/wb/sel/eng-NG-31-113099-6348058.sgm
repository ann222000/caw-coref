&gt; &gt; The first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history of
&gt; &gt; the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without
&gt; &gt; anti-Semitism is impossible. Zionism agrees with the basic tenet of
&gt; &gt; anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non-Jews.

&gt; &gt; THE SECOND POINT IS IF THE ZEALOTS ARE SO UNABLE TO ACCEPT CO

ESTABLISHING AN IMPERIUM IN IMPERIO: THE JEWS
The Jews had been in England in Anglo-Saxon times dealing in slaves. Jews
however came into England with the Norman Conquest. They made themselves a
threat to the people of this country by (1) clipping the gold coinage and
turning the clippings into bullion for sale overseas (2) dispossessing good
Christian Englishmen of their lands and property by high interest rates in
usury (3) by the ritual murder of young Christian boys by crucifixion and
drawing off the blood for ritual purposes; particularly Hugh of Lincoln in
1255; a child sacrificed in Nottingham in 1279; and the ritual murder of a
boy in Oxford by the Jew Isaac de Pulet in 1290 (Patent Roll. Edward I, mem.
21 21st June, 1290; Public Records Office).
On the 18th of July 1290, by a royal decree, King Edward I in his council
expelled all Jews forever from England. Writs were sent out to the sheriffs
of the English shires informing them that by royal edict all Jews were to
leave the English realm before November 1st 1290, anyone who remained were
to be executed. The population and parliament reacted with relief and great
joy (Calendar of Close Rolls, 18 Edward I, Public Records Office). In his
book Edward I (London, 1988) page 343, Michael Prestwick states that at a
Parliament summoned to Westminster in that July a subsidy was granted and
was collected. This subsidy was a thank offering for the Jews' expulsion

THE JEWS PRESENT BEGGING LETTERS TO CROMWELL
Various Jews made begging petitions to Oliver Cromwell to get him to revoke
the Edict of Expulsion; but Cromwell, being only a commoner, could not
revoke a royal edict and knew this. In February 1658 Cromwell is said to
have made an oral commitment to Antonio Fernandes Cavajal, the leader of the
Jews (buried under the name of Abraham in the Jews' cemetery, London 1659),
assuring his protection. This was in defiance of the recommendations of the
council that the Jews should only be permitted the standing of ordinary
aliens. This is the situation today (lecture by Lucien Wolf to the Jews
College Literary Society in 1877).
Joan Comay, wife of the Israeli Ambassador to the Court of St. James and to
the United Nations wrote in her book Who's Who in Jewish History After the
Period of the Old Testament, published in 1974:
'Manasseh [ben Israel] returned to Holland in October 1657, deeply
distressed at what he considered to be the failure of his mission. Cromwell
remained on friendly terms with him and granted him a pension of £100 a
year. Although Edward I's edict of expulsion was not formally revoked as
Manasseh had hoped, the resumption of Jewish worship achieved the same
practical result. The edict has actually not been revoked to this day.'
Because of the expulsion of the Jews from Europe, the Jews sent an appeal
for advice to the Sanhedrin on the 13th of January 1489. The reply came back
from the Prince of the Jews in Constantinople. It advised the Jews of Europe
to adopt the tactics of the Trojan Horse: to make their sons Christian
priests, lawyers, doctors etc. and to destroy the Christian structure from
within. Thus, by 1990, we have had one known Bah-Mitzvahed bishop in the
Church of England, Bishop Hugh Montefiore, numerous Jewish Queen's Counsels
in the legal profession and at least seven foreign Jews in the House of
Lords.

The Zionist Jewish Role In  - Causing World War II
"In 1941, a Jewish writer, Theodor N. Kaufman, wrote Germany Must Perish.
Kaufman set out a plan for the total destruction of the German population by
a very simple method: the mass sterilisation of all German men and women
between the age of puberty and sixty years."

From a pre-1993 edition of John Tyndall's Spearhead magazine

http://www.corax.org/revisionism/misc/encampment.html
Immediately after Japan declared war on the United States of America, the
order was issued to round up all Americans of Japanese ancestry and imprison
them in large camps. A declaration of war entitles any nation to imprison
its enemy and their sympathizers.
On March 24, 1933, the Jewish World Congress, then under the leadership of
Chaim Weizman, declared war on Germany on behalf of the Jews of the world.
The basic question arises; what were the Germans supposed to do with their
large Jewish population?

thousands of Jews were not bothered by the Nazis or by the fate of their
"convicted" co-religionists. They went on with their daily lives in Germany
while the world was running amok about the "harsh treatment of Jews in
Germany." To illustrate the true "fate of the Jews," one has to look at some
of the prominent Jewish leaders living in Germany at the time.
These are very important questions, because so many prominent Jews survived
the alleged Holocaust. Simon Wiesenthal, Eli Wiesel, Leo Baeck, Max
Nussbaum, and so many more like them. As a matter of fact, approximately 4.5
million Jews "survived."

Why did Rabbi Baeck never leave the Third Reich, the land of concentration
camps and "gas chambers," with all the other 300,000 German Jews who were
allowed to leave for more lucrative lands?

By all accounts, Rabbi Dr. Leo Baeck must have had a very comfortable
existence under the National Socialist Government in Germany. Born in 1873
in Posen, he became a Rabbi in 1897 in Oppeln/Silesia. Interestingly, he was
a Rabbi in Berlin from 1912 until 1943, when he himself was interned at the
Theresienstadt camp, a camp where most of the prominent Jews and resistance
activists were housed. After the war Leo Baeck immigrated to England.

Why did Rabbi Baeck never leave the Third Reich, the land of concentration
camps and "gas chambers," with all the other 300,000 German Jews who were
allowed to leave for more lucrative lands?

Another question should be put to all those false Holocaust "experts" by
asking them how many Jews were gassed in Dachau? As a matter of fact, no one
was ever "gassed" in Germany, or in territories under German control, as has
been established in court

In Schuld und Schicksal (Guilt and Fate) Burg dealt with the Warsaw and Lodz
ghettos. When the German troops occupied Warsaw, they wanted to concentrate
the Jewish population. Real ghettos had been there for centuries but the
assimilated or emancipated Jews had lived far way from the ghettos. Now the
Germans wanted to have the Jews all together. In a practical sense, the
ghetto was also organized for the protection of the Jewish population.
(26-6885, 6886)
The Zionists were happy with this arrangement. An appointed Jewish Council
was the governing body of the ghetto. They had their own police, jails and
everything else. Naturally, there were some who were cruel. One of these was
the vice president of the police, who was later executed. In Burg's eyes,
this execution was evidence that Jews defended themselves against the
minority of Zionists who were using the majority of Jews for their own
purposes. (26-6886, 6887)

Then, when hundreds of thousands of civilians died in massive Allied bombing
raids against German civilians ... and only then ... Rabbi Baeck got out.
And where did he go? To Theresienstadt, because the concentration camp was
never bombed by the Allies, and was the safest place for a Jew to be.
Why did Rabbi Baeck never leave the Third Reich, the land of concentration
camps and "gas chambers," with all the other 300,000 German Jews who were
allowed to leave for more lucrative lands?
It must have been relatively easy to leave Germany. Max Nussbaum, Chief
Rabbi of Berlin until 1940 (who later became Chief Rabbi of Beverly Hills,
CA), immigrated to New York at the advice of Rabbi Stephen Wise. Did Rabbi
Wise already know of the coming war between the United States and Germany in
1940?
One must assume that Rabbi Baeck knew about Rabbi Nussbaum's plan to move to
New York, but again Baeck remained in Berlin. A riddle to be sure, unless
the horrors of Nazism were not that horrible for the Jews after all.
Ø &gt; IS IT TRUE that in 1941 and again in 1942, the German Gestapo offered

That second war was later made certain, not by the intentions of Hitler but
by the determination of his eternal enemies to destroy the new Germany that
he had created.
By the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919 and the Treaty of St. Germain on
20 September of the same year, the German people were thoroughly humiliated.
The British Prime Minister, Lloyd George, wrote:
'The international bankers swept statesmen, politicians, journalists and

ALIEN CONTROL
Is US like Germany of the '30s? Published on Friday, June 11, 2004 by the
Chicago Sun Times  by Andrew Greeley
http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0611-10.htm

The Daily Mail reported on 10 July 1933:
'The German nation, moreover, was rapidly falling under the control of its
alien elements. In the last days of the pre-Hitler regime there were twenty
times as many Jewish government officials in Germany as had existed before
the war. Israelites of international attachments were insinuating themselves
into key positions in the German administrative machine.'
Resentment and resistance began to build up against the alien horde and in
the year before Adolf Hitler came to power Bernard Lecache, President of the
World Jewish League, stated:
'Germany is our public enemy number one. It is our object to declare war
without mercy against her.'
On that same day, 24 March 1933, on the front page of the London Daily
Express appeared the main headlines: "Judaea declares war on Germany: Jews
of all the world unite", and followed with:
'The Israelite people of the entire world declare economic and financial war
on Germany. The appearance of the Swastika as the symbol of the new Germany
revives the old war symbol of the Jews. Fourteen million Jews stand as one
body to declare war on Germany. The Jewish wholesale dealer leaves his
business, the banker his bank, the shopkeeper his shop, the beggar his
miserable hut in order to combine forces in the holy war against Hitler's
people.'
The German government was removing Jews from influential positions and
transferring power back to the German people. This declaration of war by the
Jews on Germany was repeated throughout the world. The first boycott of
Jewish business concerns came after this Jewish declaration of war in April
1933.

http://www.aldeilis.net/zion/zionhol01.html

The Zionist Federation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a
tiny minority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to
represent the Jews of the Reich.
The best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934. Immediately
after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the world supported or were
organising a world wide boycott of German goods. This campaign hurt the Nazi
regime and the German authorities searched frantically for a way disabling
the boycott. It was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull
out, the campaign would collapse.
This problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi party as
early as 21.6.33, outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the
two organisations on the questions of race, nation, and the nature of the
'Jewish problem', and it offered to collaborate with the new regime:

In their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime, the
Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott. The main public act
was the signature of the 'Transfer Agreement' with the Nazi authorities
during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In essence, the agreement was designed
to get Germany's Jews out of the country and into Mandate Palestine. It
provided a possibility for Jews to take a sizeable part of their property
out of the country, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This
right was denied to Jews leaving for any other destination (emphasis - ED).
The Zionist Organisation was the acting agent, through its financial
organisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts 'helping' Jews
to leave the country, breaking the ring of the boycott, exporting German
goods in large quantities to Palestine, and last but not least, enabling the
regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies,
the Jews. After all, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now
the Jews come and agree with them.

After news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the Zionist
Organisation found it possible and necessary to deal with the Nazis, and
import their goods, who could argue for a boycott? This was not the first
time that the interests of both movements were presented to the German
public as complementary. Baron Von Mildenstein, the first head of the Jewish
Department of the SS, later followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to
Palestine. This he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader,
Kurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a series of
favourable articles in Der Sturmer describing the 'new Jew' of Zionism, a
Jew Nazis could accept and understand.

The declared enemy was now right in the middle of their country. Bankers,
industrialists, media moguls, movie producers, merchants, and others,
overnight became enemies of Germany.
No nation in the world would have allowed their declared enemies to freely
roam around the country. The Germans, however, never implemented measures
against the Jews as drastic as the United States did with their Japanese
citizens.

that is absolutely correct. it took 45 years before somebody dared to write
that the highest raking dutch official during ww2 who did not escape to
england was a 100 percent jew (Hirschfeld) he was so glad to be in power and
being the sole person "negotiating"with the germans that the first order he
issued was that the people had to hand over any downed allied pilot and his
crew to the german authorities for which they could a reward of dfls10

I began to find out about the barbaric methods used to rid the fledgling
state of as many Palestinians as possible. The world recoils today
at the thought of bacteriological warfare, but Israel was probably the first
to actually use it in the Middle East. In the 1948 war, Jewish forces would
empty Arab villages of their populations, often by threats, sometimes by
just gunning down a half-dozen unarmed Arabs as examples to the rest.
To make sure the Arabs couldn't return to make a fresh life for themselves
in these villages, the Israelis put typhus and dysentery bacteria into the
water wells.
Uri Mileshtin, an official historian for the Israeli Defense Force, has
written and spoken about the use of bacteriological agents. (1) According to
Mileshtin, Moshe Dayan, a division commander at the time, gave orders in
1948 to remove Arabs from their villages, bulldoze their homes, and
render water wells unusable with typhus and dysentery bacteria.

Giladi wrote this book tell the American people, and especially American
Jews, that Jews from Islamic lands did not emigrate willingly to Israel;
that, to force them to leave, Jews killed Jews; and that, to buy time to
confiscate ever more Arab lands, Jews on numerous occasions rejected genuine
peace initiatives from their Arab neighbors.

http://miscellaneous.press-world.com/v/28142.html

Alex de Tocqueville once observed that it was easier for the world to accept
a simple lie than a complex truth. Certainly it has been easier for the
world to accept the Zionist lie that Jews were evicted from Muslim lands
because of anti-Semitism, and that Israelis, never the Arabs, were the
pursuers of peace. The truth is far more discerning; bigger players in the
world stage were pulling the strings."

Giladi adds: "These players, I believe, should be held accountable for their
crimes, particularly when they willfully terrorized, dispossessed and killed
innocent people on the altar of some ideological imperatives.

"We Jews did not leave our ancestral homes because of any natural enmity
between Jews and Muslims. And we Arabs--and I say Arab because that is the
language my wife and I still speak at home-we Arabs on numerous occasions
have sought peace with the State of the Jews.

"And finally, as a U.S. citizen and taxpayer. we Americans need to stop
supporting racial discrimination in Israel and the cruel expropriation of
lands in the West Bank, Gaza, South Lebanon and the Golan Heights."

BEN-GURION'S SCANDALS : HOW THE HAGANAH AND THE MOSSAD ELIMINATED JEWS

Both Yitzak Rabin and Menachem Begin were to contradict the common belief
that the 1967 war was a defensive attack on the part of Israel. Both claimed
publicly that Israel knew Nasser was not planning to attack. His troop
movements were the pretext for a long planned Israeli move to gain more
territory. Rabin was quoted in Le Monde, February 29, 1968, as saying, "I do
not think Nasser wanted war. The two divisions he sent to the Sinai in May
[1967] would not have been sufficient to launch an offensive against Israel.
He knew it and we knew it." On August 8, 1982, Prime Minister Begin made a
speech saying, "In June, 1967, we again had a choice. the Egyptian army
concentrations in the Sinai did not prove that Nasser was really about to
attack us. We must be honest with ourselves. We decided to attack him" (New
York Times, August 21, 1982).

BEN GURION SCANDALS
How the Hagannah and The Mossad Eliminated Jews
http://www.aaargh-international.org/

If you use the word anti semitic  at all you are obviously leaning on it to
support your
false and weak attack on the facts to color opinion to support the rubbish
you are writing. To support an evaluation of israel that is not just
favorable to israel. But an absolute sycophantic uncritical support which
distorts the facts by being completely untrue, and consists of  either
absolute lies or bordering on or absolute
lies as here put by you with absolute effrontery as fact.

I began to find out about the barbaric methods used to rid the fledgling
state of as many Palestinians as possible. The world recoils today
at the thought of bacteriological warfare, but Israel was probably the first
to actually use it in the Middle East. In the 1948 war, Jewish forces would
empty Arab villages of their populations, often by threats, sometimes by
just gunning down a half-dozen unarmed Arabs as examples to the rest.
To make sure the Arabs couldn't return to make a fresh life for themselves
in these villages, the Israelis put typhus and dysentery bacteria into the
water wells.
Uri Mileshtin, an official historian for the Israeli Defense Force, has
written and spoken about the use of bacteriological agents. (1) According to
Mileshtin, Moshe Dayan, a division commander at the time, gave orders in
1948 to remove Arabs from their villages, bulldoze their homes, and
render water wells unusable with typhus and dysentery bacteria.

Giladi wrote this book tell the American people, and especially American
Jews, that Jews from Islamic lands did not emigrate willingly to Israel;
that, to force them to leave, Jews killed Jews; and that, to buy time to
confiscate ever more Arab lands, Jews on numerous occasions rejected genuine
peace initiatives from their Arab neighbors.

Perfidy
&lt;pdf&gt; New York, Meisner, 1961, 201 p. 1,2 M

I consider Perfidy to be the best, most honest, heart-wrenching story
written about any subject. Specifically, it happens to be about not-widely
publicized facts about "Zionist leaders" of the Ben-Gurion era, their very
slimy connections to Nazi collaborators-and a despicable record in saving
the Jews of Europe (For anyone who disregards this : Israel's "Zionist
leaders" are also taken apart in Tom Segev's, The Seventh Million). Hecht
prophetically states in his opening sentence : "In my own time, governments
have taken the place of people. They have also taken the place of God.
Governments speak for people, dream for them, and determine, absurdly, their
lives and deaths." (Jaywilton)

Dr. Rudolf Kastner was a Jewish Agency official during WWII who was sent to
Hungary to save Hungarian Jews from the holocaust. The top Nazi brass,
Eichmann, Krumey, Becher, Wisliczeny, sized him up, and realized that his
selfish desire for influence and power could be exploited. To prevent a
recurrence of the Warsaw ghetto rebellion, which lasted for 27 days and took
enormous German manpower to crush, the Jew-killers needed an "insider" who
would deceive the hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews into acquiescence.
In return for collaborating with the Nazis, Kastner was offered to select
about 300 prominent Hungarian Jews to be saved from extermination in
Auschwitz.
Kastner agreed. Not only did he deceive the Hungarian Jews, who trusted him
blindly because of his credentials as THE top Zionist in Hungary, but he was
also responsible to the death of Hanna Senesh, a legendary Israeli
parachutist who was sent to Hungary to spy for the British.
During his trial, Kastner lied multiple times under oath. The process of
cross-examination painted a picture of a tormented, schizophrenic Kastner,
who actually believes he did no wrong. The entire Bolshevik ruling clique of
Israel at the time defended him from the charges of collaboration with the
Nazis, because in this trial, they, the ruling clique, were implicated as
well. Just like American Jewry during WWII, the Zionist leaders in Israel
kept quiet about the extermination of Jews by the Nazi Germans. Both were
responsible in great measure for the extent of the genocide---if they did
something, it would have been much less than six million. But American Jewry
didn't want to be regarded as trouble-makers, and the ruling clique in
Israel was the loyal puppy of the British.
The presiding judge ruled against Kastner, and in his opinion implicated the
entire government of Israel. This decision had tremendous consequences for
Israeli society in the years to come. (Concerned Kafir)

With regard to gas chambers, the almost endless procession of false
witnesses and of falsified documents to which I have invited the reader's
attention during this long study, proves, nevertheless, only one thing:
never at any moment did the responsible authorities of the Third Reich
intend to order - or, in fact, order - the extermination of the Jews in this
or any other manner. Did such exterminations take place without orders? This
question has haunted me for 15 years."
The number of Jews who perished in Europe during the war years, he
concluded, could not have been more than about 1.6 million.
Among the many who were impressed by Rassinier was the great American
historian Harry Elmer Barnes. In a 1962 essay, "Revisionism and
Brainwashing," Barnes remarked on "the discouragement and smearing of
outsiders like the distinguished French historian Paul Rassinier, who sought
to expose the exaggerations of the atrocity stories."

The UN Decides a Universal Ban on Revisionism

On November 1st, unanimously and without a vote, the representatives of the

making up the UN adopted - or let be adopted - an Israeli-drafted resolution
proclaiming January
27th "International Day of Commemoration in memory of the victims of the
Holocaust". Moreover, the
resolution "Rejects any denial of the Holocaust as an historical event,
either in full or
part". Historical revisionism thus sees its existence acknowledged by the
whole world, a fact proving
that it has some life in it, but, at the same time, this decision means that
the revisionists find
themselves struck with the reprobation of all the countries of the world. As
for the "State" of the
Vatican, which has no seat at the UN, it had, as early as in 1992, declared:
"There is no historical
revisionism that can call into question the inhuman abyss of the Holocaust"

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 1) After World War I Great Britain accepted the 1922 Mandate for
&gt; Palestine, and then - with League of Nations approval - used its
&gt; article 25 to create two distinct entities within the Mandate-
&gt; designated area.
&gt; 2) The territory lying between the Jordan River and the eastern desert
&gt; boundary &quot;of that part of Palestine which was known as Trans-
&gt; Jordan&quot; (nearly 78 percent) thus became the Emirate of Transjordan.
&gt; This new entity was put under the rule of Emir Abdullah, the eldest
&gt; son of the Sharif of Mecca, as a recompense for his support in the war
&gt; against the Turks, and of Ibn Saud's seizure of Arabia (Faisal,
&gt; Abdullah's brother, later received the even vaster Mandate area of
&gt; Iraq).

&gt; 3) Turning a blind eye to article 15, Great Britain also decided that
&gt; no Jews could reside or buy land in the newly created Emirate. This
&gt; policy was ratified - after the emirate became a kingdom - by Jordan's
&gt; law no. 6, sect. 3, on April 3, 1954, and reactivated in law no. 7,
&gt; sect. 2, on April 1, 1963. It states that any person may become a
&gt; citizen of Jordan unless he is a Jew. King Hussein made peace with
&gt; Israel in 1994, but the Judenrein legislation remains valid today.

&gt; 4) The remaining area west of the Jordan River (comprising about 22
&gt; percent of the original Mandate) was then officially designated
&gt; &quot;Palestine&quot; by Great Britain. As stated in the 1937 Royal Commission
&gt; Report, &quot;the primary purpose of the Mandate, as expressed in its
&gt; preamble and its articles, is to promote the establishment of the
&gt; Jewish National Home.&quot; This was now greatly restricted.

&gt; 5) U.N. General Assembly Resolution 181 (November 29, 1947) authorized
&gt; a Partition Plan in this area: for an Arab and a Jewish state - and
&gt; for a corpus separatum for Jerusalem. The plan was rejected by both
&gt; the Arab League and the Arab-Palestinian leadership. Aided and abetted
&gt; by the neighboring Arab countries, local armed Arab Palestinian forces
&gt; immediately began attacking Jews, who counterattacked. On May 15,
&gt; 1948, the armies of five Arab League states joined these militias in
&gt; the invasion of Israel, but their armies failed in their goal of
&gt; eradicating the fledgling state.

&gt; 6) The armistice boundaries (1949-1967) left Israel with roughly 16.5
&gt; percent, or 8,000 sq. miles, of the original 1922 Mandate area (about
&gt; 48,000 sq. miles), while about five percent - less Gaza, which was
&gt; occupied by the Egyptians - was conquered and occupied in 1948 by
&gt; British General Glubb Pasha, the commander of Abdullah's Arab Legion.
&gt; The historic regions of &quot;Judea and Samaria&quot; - their official names as
&gt; indicated on all British mandate maps until 1948 - were annexed and
&gt; became the &quot;West Bank&quot; of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1950. All
&gt; the Jews were expelled from the area and from the Old City of
&gt; Jerusalem; their synagogues, and even tombstones on the Mount of
&gt; Olives, were destroyed.

&gt; 7) Until King Hussein attacked Israel on June 6, 1967, Jordan's
&gt; recognized de facto boundaries covered 83 percent of Palestine (78
&gt; percent east of the Jordan river, and five percent to the west).
&gt; Following its military defeat in the Six Day War, the Hashemite
&gt; Kingdom of Jordan lost the &quot;West Bank,&quot; which it had illegally annexed
&gt; 19 years earlier, retaining the huge &quot;Transjordan&quot; portion (78
&gt; percent) of the original League of Nations territory.

&gt; 8) Of Jordan's current population of five million, about two-thirds
&gt; (over three million) consider themselves &quot;Arab Palestinians.&quot; They are
&gt; the descendants either of the original Arab Palestinian inhabitants of
&gt; the Trans-Jordan region, or of roughly 550,000 Arab refugees from west
&gt; Palestine who lost their homes after the Arab League armies failed to
&gt; eradicate Israel first in 1948, and again in 1967. Nearly two million
&gt; Jordanian Bedouin citizens and others do not identify themselves as
&gt; Palestinians.

&gt; 9) After the 1967 disaster, an Arab League Summit Conference held in
&gt; Khartoum that November reacted negatively to U.N. Security Council
&gt; Resolution 247: &quot;No peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no
&gt; negotiations with Israel, no concessions on the questions of
&gt; Palestinian national rights.&quot; This was also the determined position of
&gt; the PLO. Apart from Egypt's 1981 peace treaty with Israel, there was
&gt; little change, for the next two decades, in this refusal to negotiate
&gt; according to U.N. Resolution 242.

&gt; 10) In those &quot;West Bank and Gaza&quot; areas, designated by the Oslo
&gt; Accords of 1994 to be placed under the administration of the
&gt; Palestinian Authority (covering about 5.5 percent of the &quot;Greater
&gt; Palestine&quot; area on both sides of the Jordan), there is now a
&gt; population of over 3,200,000, of whom about 35,000 are Christians, but
&gt; none are Jews.

&gt; 11) The population of the Jewish state - a state envisaged in the 1922
&gt; League of Nations Mandate, and confirmed by the U.N.'s 1947 decision -
&gt; is now roughly 6,500,000, of whom roughly 20 percent are Arabs
&gt; (120,000 Christians), Druze, and Bedouin citizens of Israel. Of the
&gt; more than five million Jewish citizens, about one-half are those
&gt; Jewish refugees from Arab countries, and their descendants, who fled
&gt; or left their ancient homeland when massacres, arrests, and ostracism
&gt; made life impossible (a further 300,000 emigrated to Europe and the
&gt; Americas, where they number over a million).

&gt; 12) Today, a tiny, vulnerable Jewish remnant - scarcely 5,000 persons
&gt; - remains in all the Arab world, less than half of one percent from
&gt; the near million who were there in 1948 (this does not include the
&gt; 50,000 in Turkey and Iran, left of about 200,000 in 1945). These are
&gt; the forgotten Jewish refugees from Arab lands, from countries that
&gt; will soon be totally judenrein just as Jordan has been since 1922.

&gt; 13) The 22 Arab League countries cover a global surface of over six
&gt; million square miles, over ten percent of the land surface on earth.
&gt; Israel, by contrast, covers barely 8,000 sq. miles.

&gt; 14) Security Council Resolution 242 has now become the panacea for
&gt; Arab states, yet their interpretation of its key operative paragraph
&gt; does not correspond to the English original, which version alone is
&gt; binding. In March 2002, a Saudi &quot;peace plan&quot; was approved by the Arab
&gt; League in Beirut, but behind it lurks the former 1981 &quot;Fahd Plan&quot; -
&gt; with a facelift - that would leave Israel with impossible borders.
&gt; After the Iraqi menace has been resolved one way or another, what is
&gt; needed for the &quot;Middle East peace process&quot; is a concerted effort to
&gt; support the Mitchell plan, which could one day lead to true peace and
&gt; reconciliation for the whole region. But the Palestinian Authority
&gt; will only become a genuine partner with Israel, alongside Jordan and
&gt; Egypt, if there is a radical break with the past, and a new spirit of
&gt; mutual acceptance prevails between the Arab world and Israel - with
&gt; individual and collective security and dignity for all. This will only
&gt; be feasible if democratic institutions and a respect for human rights
&gt; and the rule of law become the norm, as they now are not. And it will
&gt; only be feasible if the Arab world recognizes the inalienable
&gt; legitimacy of Israel's existence in a part of its historical land.

Irshad Manji: Modern Israel is a far cry from old South Africa

* It's absurd to apply the term apartheid to one of the most
progressive states in the world, maintains Irshad Manji
* February 09, 2007

IN the past year, a stream of thinkers across the West - from
Australian writer Antony Loewenstein to US academics John Mearsheimer
and Stephen Walt - has punctured the usual parameters of debate about
Israel. I, for one, welcome any effort to prevent ideas from
calcifying into ideologies. As a Muslim refusenik, that's what I do by
defying the conventional prejudices of my fellow Muslims. Why would I
resent refuseniks of a different kind?
It's precisely because I embrace intellectual pluralism that I
respectfully challenge Jimmy Carter's recent critique of Israel as an
apartheid state. To be sure, I've long admired the former US
president. In my book The Trouble with Islam Today I cite him as an
example of how religion can be invoked to tap the best of humanity. In
no small measure, it was Carter's appreciation of spiritual values
that brought together Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin and
Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, compelling these former foes to clasp
hands over a peace deal.

Which is why Carter's new book disappoints so many of us who champion
co-existence. Entitled Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, the book argues
that Israel's conduct towards Palestinians mimics South Africa's long-
time demonisation of blacks. Of course, certain Israeli politicians
have spewed venom at Palestinians, as have some Arab leaders towards
Jews, but Israel is far more complex - and diverse - than slogans
about the occupation would suggest. In a state practising apartheid,
would Arab Muslim legislators wield veto power over anything? At only
20per cent of the population, would Arabs even be eligible for
election if they squirmed under the thumb of apartheid? Would an
apartheid state extend voting rights to women and thepoor in local
elections, which Israel didfor the first time in the history of
Palestinian Arabs?

Would the vast majority of Arab Israeli citizens turn out to vote in
national elections, as they've usually done? Would an apartheid state
have several Arab political parties, as Israel does? In recent Israeli
elections, two Arab parties found themselves disqualified for
expressly supporting terrorism against the Jewish state. However,
Israel's Supreme Court, exercising its independence, overturned both
disqualifications. Under any system of apartheid, would the judiciary
be free of political interference?

Would an apartheid state award its top literary prize to an Arab?
Israel honoured Emile Habibi in 1986, before the intifada might have
made such a choice politically shrewd. Would an apartheid state
encourage Hebrew-speaking schoolchildren to learn Arabic? Would road
signs throughout the land appear in both languages? Even my country,
the proudly bilingual Canada, doesn't meet that standard.

Would an apartheid state be home to universities where Arabs and Jews
mingle at will, or apartment blocks where they live side by side?
Would an apartheid state bestow benefits and legal protections on
Palestinians who live outside of Israel but work inside its borders?
Would human rights organisations operate openly in an apartheid state?
They do in Israel.

For that matter, military officials go public with their criticisms of
government policies. In October 2003, the Israel Defence Forces' chief
of staff told the press that road closures in the West Bank and Gaza
were feeding Palestinian anger. Two weeks later, four former heads of
the Shin Bet security service blasted the occupation and called on
Ariel Sharon to withdraw troops unilaterally, which later happened in
Gaza. Would an apartheid state stomach so much dissent from those
mandated to protect the state?

Above all, would media debate the most basic building blocks of the
nation? Would a Hebrew newspaper in an apartheid state run an article
by an Arab Israeli about why the Zionist adventure has been a total
failure? Would it run that article on Israel's independence day? Would
an apartheid state ensure conditions for the freest Arabic press in
the Middle East, a press so free that it can demonstrably abuse its
liberties and keep on rolling? To this day, the East Jerusalem daily
Al-Quds hasn't retracted an anti-Israel letter supposedly penned by
Nelson Mandela but proven to have been written by an Arab living in
The Netherlands.

Even the eminence grise of Palestinian nationalism, the late Edward
Said, stated flat out that "Israel is not South Africa". How could it
be when an Israeli publisher translated Said's seminal work,
Orientalism, into Hebrew? I'll cap this point with a question that
Said himself asked of Arabs: "Why don't we fight harder for freedom of
opinions in our own societies, a freedom, no one needs to be told,
that scarcely exists?"

I disagree: some people still need to be told that Arab "freedoms"
don't compare to those of Israel. The people who need reminding are
those who now push the South Africa analogy a step further by equating
Israel with Nazi Germany. To them, Zionists are committing hate crimes
under the totalitarian nightmare that they dub "Zio-Nazism" (like neo-
Nazism).

When it comes to granting citizenship, Israel discriminates in the
same way as an affirmative action policy, giving the edge to a
specific minority that has faced genocidal injustice. Does this amount
to Nazism? Spare me. As a Muslim, I could become a citizen of Israel
without having to convert. After all, Israel was one of the few
countries anywhere to grant shelter, then citizenship, to the
Vietnamese boatpeople who sought political asylum in the late 1970s. I
don't have to wonder how Syria compares on that score.

Now for the ultimate proof of Israel's flimsy credentials as a bunker
of Hitlerian hate: It's the only country in the Middle East to which
Arab Christians are voluntarily migrating. And they are also thriving
there, notching much higher university attendance rates than the Arab
Muslim citizens of Israel, and enjoying better overall health than
Jews.

The Holy Land is gut-wrenching and complicated. As much as I applaud
Israel's efforts to foster pluralism, I condemn its illegal Jewish
settlements and less visible crimes such as the diversion of water
away from Palestinian towns. These contradictions of the Israeli state
should be exposed, discussed, even pilloried. And they are: openly as
well as often. So there's little point in deciding whose camp is the
paragon of vice or virtue. The better question might be: who's willing
to hear what they don't want to hear? That's the test of whether a
country is more than black or white.
