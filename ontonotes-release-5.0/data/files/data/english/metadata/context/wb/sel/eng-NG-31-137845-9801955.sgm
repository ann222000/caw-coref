A Brief History of Hallowe'en

Author: Christina Aubin [a WitchVox Sponsor]

The Celtic peoples called the time between Samhain (pronounced &quot;SOW-in&quot; in
Ireland, SOW-een in Wales, &quot;SAV-en&quot; in Scotland or even &quot;SAM-haine&quot; in non
Gaelic speaking countries) and Brigid's Day &quot;the period of little sun.&quot; Thus,
Samhain is often named the &quot;Last Harvest&quot; or &quot;Summer's End&quot;.

While almost all Celtic based traditions recognize this Holiday as the end of
the &quot;old&quot; year, some groups do not celebrate the coming of the &quot;new year&quot;
until Yule. Some consider the time between Samhain and Yule as a time which does
not even exist on the Earthly plane. The &quot;time which is no time&quot; was
considered in the &quot;old days&quot; to be both very magickal and very dangerous. So even
today, we celebrate this Holiday with a mixture of joyous celebration and 'spine
tingling&quot; reverence.

The Samhain Holiday begins at sundown on October 31st. The nightide was
always a time to be wary of walking alone in the countryside. So much more on this
Night when the veils between the worlds of humans and spirits was at its
thinnest. Traditional lore speaks of the dead returning to visit their kin and the
doors to the Lands of the Sidhe (pronounced &quot;shee&quot;) or Faery Realm being
opened.

&quot;The Feast of the Dead&quot; (&quot;Fleadh nan Mairbh&quot;) is laid out by many to welcome
these otherworldly visitors and gain their favor for the coming year. Many
folks leave milk and cakes (&quot;Bannock Samhain&quot; ) outside their door on Samhain Eve
or set a place at their table for their ancestors who may want to join in the
celebrations with their kin and family.

Some Witches use a chant at the beginning of the Feast to welcome their
ancestors.

One of these, for example goes like this:

And so it is, we gather again,
The feast of our dead to begin.
Our Ancients, our Ancestors we invite, Come!
And follow the setting of the sun.

Whom do we call? We call them by name

(Name your ancestor that you wish want to welcome.)

The Ancients have come! Here with us stand
Where ever the country, where ever the land
They leave us not, to travel alone;
Flesh of our flesh, bone of our bone!

Grandmothers, Grandfathers, Great be their Power!
Past ones and present-at this very hour!

Welcome within are the dead who are kin,
Feast here with us and rest here within
Our hearth is your hearth and welcome to thee;
Old tales to tell and new visions to see!

It is also customary to light a new candle for the &quot;new year&quot;. This ritual
harkens back to the days when Samhain was one of only two days- the other being
Beltaine-when it was considered correct to extinguish the &quot;hearth fire&quot; and
then to re-light it. If your fire failed at any other time of the year, it was
thought to be very bad luck indeed.

Upon the rekindling of the fire in the morning, this blessing was often said:

We Call Upon The Sacred Three:
To Save... To Shield... To Surround
The Hearth... The House... The Household
This Night, Each Night, Every Night.!
