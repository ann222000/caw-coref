Yesterday, I went to the public library to check out some books on
satanism and witchcraft. I'm trying to summon a demon to do by will.
I walked into the main lobby and noticed that I was being eyed by some
snooty looking librarian. Mind you I hadn't done a damn thing but walk
through the doors. She made no attempt to conceal that she was staring
at me either. She rose, approached me and asked me if she could help
me. I immediately knew that this was some sort of ploy to find out
more information about me. I told her that I needed no help, thanked
her and kept walking forward. Fuck that old crone. She had stereotyped
me as if I were some kind of nigger or thief coming into the library
to bum coins from other patrons. I'd fix her. Earlier during the day,
I'd eaten at Chang's Buffet, a local all you can eat gook food
establishment. By now, the stir fry and soy sauce were brewing some
mighty gas clouds. I passed by the nonfiction section and selected the
books I needed. I already had most of the material components for my
conjuring. All I needed was the actual incantation.
As I walked up to check the books out, I made sure to stand in her
lane. While I was waiting to be checked out I flexed my stomach
muscles in anticipation of letting out a gross fart. I knew I had some
ready. I'd cut several test farts on some yuppie looking cunt in the
romance section so I was primed and ready to expel.
Finally, it was my turn. I placed the books down on the counter along
with my card and squeezed off what must've been a 5 second fart. It
wasn't that loud but it smelled horrible (even by my standards).
She had to have heard it but even if she didn't, there could be no
doubt that she smelt it. It had a sickly sweet aroma to it along with
the reek of 2 day old cabbage and freshly laid dog turd.
I felt some mud behind it as well. Always a good sign that it would
stink.
As she reached forward to get my books, she recoiled in horror. I just
smiled knowing that Toothless, my butthole, had the last word.
