Pennsylvania Dental Board Approves Cavitat Device, NICO - Dumps
Quackbusters...

Opinion by Consumer Advocate  Tim Bolen

Sunday, April 22nd, 2007

Public agencies have relied on the &quot;quackbuster&quot; operation for
expertise in health care issues far too long.  The time when an agency
could fly some &quot;quackbuster&quot; bozo in for a hearing, have them testify
to nonsense for a few hours, and stuff them back on a plane, fat check
in hand, with the sure knowledge they had a &quot;win&quot; is long gone.  The
State of Pennsylvania Chief Counsel's office and the Pennsylvania
Dental Board found that out the hard way, over almost a three year
period, in the &quot;Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Stephen R. Evans, DDS&quot;
case.

The case, which began in 2003, upon the complaint of one of the
&quot;quackbuster&quot; nitwits, dragged through Administrative hearings,
Superior Court, and back to Administrative hearing, then finally found
its way back to the Dental Board - with Orders from the Superior Court
AND an Administrative Law Judge to decide, completely, and unarguably,
on behalf of the Respondent Stephen R. Evans DDS.

The case was one of those affronts that popped up all over the country
attacking dentists who were treating (1) NICO (Neuralgia Induced
Cavitational Osteoporosis), (2)  made use of the FDA approved Cavitat
Medical Device, and (3) recommended vitamins and supplements to their
patients.  There was a flurry of these, they've virtually all been
beaten off - and I'll be talking about that situation separately.

The Pennsylvania Dental Board, and the Chief Counsel's staff assigned
to this case learned more than just not to rely on &quot;quackbuster&quot;
nonsense.  They learned four more hard lessons:  (1)  You can't defeat
real science with crackpot crap.  (2)  NICO  is real - and it isn't
going away.  (3)  The Cavitat device works just like its company
President, Bob Jones, says it does. (4)  Cutting-edge dentists,
interested in updating American dentistry, will fight attacks on their
practices - and they will win.

Even better - Stephen Evans DDS's victory had to rub the &quot;quackbuster&quot;
psyche raw - for the &quot;quackbuster&quot; front-man, Stephen Barrett, runs
his goofy website &quot;quackwatch.com&quot; out of his basement in Allentown,
Pennsylvania.  Once more - Barrett got mega-trammeled in his own home
State.

So, what actually happened?

In short, the State of Pennsylvania, relying on quackpot legal
arguments, dreamed up, I think, in a basement in Allentown,
Pennsylvania, cost the taxpayers a bundle of cash for a prosecution
that simply should not have happened.  The result of the legal action
backfired on Pennsylvania, and the &quot;quackbusters&quot;, and solidified, and
now protects, biological dentistry, the Cavitat device, and the sale
and recommendation of vitamins and supplements by dentists, in
Pennsylvania - and very likely, the rest of the US.

More - the State of Pennsylvania originally started out this case with
Robert S. Baratz MD, PhD, DDS (Bobbie Baratz) as their witness.  But,
before long, they dropped him cold, and went for someone else, who, in
the end, turned out no better than Bobbie would have been.  The word's
getting around about Bobbie.

On April 11th, 2007, a letter was sent to Stephen Evan's attorney
Charlie Brown by representatives of the Pennsylvania Chief Counsel's
office saying:  &quot;Enclosed please find an Order issued by the
Pennsylvania State Board of Dentistry adopting the hearing examiner's
proposed adjudication in the above referenced matter.&quot;

There were five parts to the Order.  (1)  The History.  (2)  The
Discussion.  (3)  The Conclusions of Law.  (4)  The Findings of Fact.
(5)  And the Order itself.  What is of vital importance, nationwide,
to dentistry, are two things, as part of the order, in this case:
(1)  The conclusions of law, and (2)  the findings of fact.  Since I
have a copy that has obviously been FAXed and reFAXed several times,
I'll pull out the important parts for you.

If Tim supports something, beware ---

First there was Hulda Clark, who claimed to have the cure for cancer, but
who after a decade or more has not has not produced a single documented
case.

Then Kingbio, a business scam, producing homeopathic remedies that were fake
even if assessed via normal standards of  homeopathic diagnosis and
prescribing, yet were claimed to be able to treat serious conditions like
cardiac arrhythmias.

Now Cavitat,  a technology that allows unscrupulous dentists to dupe
patients into believing that they are being poisoned by their jaws and need
highly invasive and expensive surgery.    The beauty of this scam is that,
having never been subjected to  validating study, the dentist can advise
surgery treatment to anyone for anything -- from allergies to cancer.

I don't know what the legal issues were here, and Tim is about the last
source that one would trust for an account of them. It does seem that the
law is unable to adequately protect the public from completely unfounded and
even quite damaging medical claims.

Please provide a link to where the Pennsylvania Dental Board (sic)

It is no surpise to me that none of you can trace anything as simple
as a Pennsylvania State Board finding.  It is the hallmark of the
&quot;quackbuster&quot; operation to do research only with what's at hand, and
nothing more.  So if it's not in the coloring book....

(insert laughter here)

Sop far, your response is what's expected from &quot;The Peter
Principle...&quot;

NICO has been scientifically, and legally, proven.  Live with it.
Baratz is a horse's ass...

I found the Judges opinions of your beloved QuackHeads very succinct
... the fake experts were Barrett &amp; Wallace Sampson.

http://www.humanticsfoundation.com/kingbio.htm

Quote:

The trial court concluded NCAHF failed to prove a false or misleading
statement. King Bio’s expert testified the products were safe and
effective. The products were included in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia
and complied with FDA guidelines.

NCAHF presented no evidence that King Bio’s products were not safe and
effective, relying instead on a general attack on homeopathy, made by
witnesses who had no knowledge of, or experience with, King Bio’s
products, and who were found to be biased and unworthy of credibility.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Pennsylvania Dental Board Approves Cavitat Device, NICO - Dumps
&gt; &gt; &gt; Quackbusters...

&gt; &gt; &gt; Opinion by Consumer Advocate  Tim Bolen

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sunday, April 22nd, 2007

&gt; &gt; &gt; Public agencies have relied on the &quot;quackbuster&quot; operation for
&gt; &gt; &gt; expertise in health care issues far too long.  The time when an agency
&gt; &gt; &gt; could fly some &quot;quackbuster&quot; bozo in for a hearing, have them testify
&gt; &gt; &gt; to nonsense for a few hours, and stuff them back on a plane, fat check
&gt; &gt; &gt; in and, with the sure knowledge they had a &quot;win&quot; is long gone.  The
&gt; &gt; &gt; State of Pennsylvania Chief Counsel's office and the Pennsylvania
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dental Board found that out the hard way, over almost a three year
&gt; &gt; &gt; period, in the &quot;Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Stephen R. Evans, DDS&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; case.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The case, which began in 2003, upon the complaint of one of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;quackbuster&quot; nitwits, dragged through Administrative hearings,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Superior Court, and back to Administrative hearing, then finally found
&gt; &gt; &gt; its way back to the Dental Board - with Orders from the Superior Court
&gt; &gt; &gt; AND an Administrative Law Judge to decide, completely, and unarguably,
&gt; &gt; &gt; on behalf of the Respondent Stephen R. Evans DDS.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The case was one of those affronts that popped up all over the country
&gt; &gt; &gt; attacking dentists who were treating (1) NICO (Neuralgia Induced
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cavitational Osteoporosis), (2)  made use of the FDA approved Cavitat
&gt; &gt; &gt; Medical Device, and (3) recommended vitamins and supplements to their
&gt; &gt; &gt; patients.  There was a flurry of these, they've virtually all been
&gt; &gt; &gt; beaten off - and I'll be talking about that situation separately.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The Pennsylvania Dental Board, and the Chief Counsel's staff assigned
&gt; &gt; &gt; to this case learned more than just not to rely on &quot;quackbuster&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; nonsense.  They learned four more hard lessons:  (1)  You can't defeat
&gt; &gt; &gt; real science with crackpot crap.  (2)  NICO  is real - and it isn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; going away.  (3)  The Cavitat device works just like its company
&gt; &gt; &gt; President, Bob Jones, says it does. (4)  Cutting-edge dentists,
&gt; &gt; &gt; interested in updating American dentistry, will fight attacks on their
&gt; &gt; &gt; practices - and they will win.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Even better - Stephen Evans DDS's victory had to rub the &quot;quackbuster&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; psyche raw - for the &quot;quackbuster&quot; front-man, Stephen Barrett, runs
&gt; &gt; &gt; his goofy website &quot;quackwatch.com&quot; out of his basement in Allentown,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pennsylvania.  Once more - Barrett got mega-trammeled in his own home
&gt; &gt; &gt; State.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, what actually happened?

&gt; &gt; &gt; In short, the State of Pennsylvania, relying on quackpot legal
&gt; &gt; &gt; arguments, dreamed up, I think, in a basement in Allentown,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pennsylvania, cost the taxpayers a bundle of cash for a prosecution
&gt; &gt; &gt; that simply should not have happened.  The result of the legal action
&gt; &gt; &gt; backfired on Pennsylvania, and the &quot;quackbusters&quot;, and solidified, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; now protects, biological dentistry, the Cavitat device, and the sale
&gt; &gt; &gt; and recommendation of vitamins and supplements by dentists, in
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pennsylvania - and very likely, the rest of the US.

&gt; &gt; &gt; More - the State of Pennsylvania originally started out this case with
&gt; &gt; &gt; Robert S. Baratz MD, PhD, DDS (Bobbie Baratz) as their witness.  But,
&gt; &gt; &gt; before long, they dropped him cold, and went for someone else, who, in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the end, turned out no better than Bobbie would have been.  The word's
&gt; &gt; &gt; getting around about Bobbie.

&gt; &gt; &gt; On April 11th, 2007, a letter was sent to Stephen Evan's attorney
&gt; &gt; &gt; Charlie Brown by representatives of the Pennsylvania Chief Counsel's
&gt; &gt; &gt; office saying:  &quot;Enclosed please find an Order issued by the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pennsylvania State Board of Dentistry adopting the hearing examiner's

&gt; Pennsylvania Dental Board Approves Cavitat Device, NICO - Dumps
&gt; Quackbusters...

&gt; Opinion by Consumer Advocate  Tim Bolen

&gt; Sunday, April 22nd, 2007

&gt; Public agencies have relied on the &quot;quackbuster&quot; operation for
&gt; expertise in health care issues far too long.  The time when an agency
&gt; could fly some &quot;quackbuster&quot; bozo in for a hearing, have them testify
&gt; to nonsense for a few hours, and stuff them back on a plane, fat check
&gt; in hand, with the sure knowledge they had a &quot;win&quot; is long gone.  The
&gt; State of Pennsylvania Chief Counsel's office and the Pennsylvania
&gt; Dental Board found that out the hard way, over almost a three year
&gt; period, in the &quot;Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Stephen R. Evans, DDS&quot;
&gt; case.

&gt; The case, which began in 2003, upon the complaint of one of the
&gt; &quot;quackbuster&quot; nitwits, dragged through Administrative hearings,
&gt; Superior Court, and back to Administrative hearing, then finally found
&gt; its way back to the Dental Board - with Orders from the Superior Court
&gt; AND an Administrative Law Judge to decide, completely, and unarguably,
&gt; on behalf of the Respondent Stephen R. Evans DDS.

&gt; The case was one of those affronts that popped up all over the country
&gt; attacking dentists who were treating (1) NICO (Neuralgia Induced
&gt; Cavitational Osteoporosis), (2)  made use of the FDA approved Cavitat
&gt; Medical Device, and (3) recommended vitamins and supplements to their
&gt; patients.  There was a flurry of these, they've virtually all been
&gt; beaten off - and I'll be talking about that situation separately.

&gt; The Pennsylvania Dental Board, and the Chief Counsel's staff assigned
&gt; to this case learned more than just not to rely on &quot;quackbuster&quot;
&gt; nonsense.  They learned four more hard lessons:  (1)  You can't defeat
&gt; real science with crackpot crap.  (2)  NICO  is real - and it isn't
&gt; going away.  (3)  The Cavitat device works just like its company
&gt; President, Bob Jones, says it does. (4)  Cutting-edge dentists,
&gt; interested in updating American dentistry, will fight attacks on their
&gt; practices - and they will win.

&gt; Even better - Stephen Evans DDS's victory had to rub the &quot;quackbuster&quot;
&gt; psyche raw - for the &quot;quackbuster&quot; front-man, Stephen Barrett, runs
&gt; his goofy website &quot;quackwatch.com&quot; out of his basement in Allentown,
&gt; Pennsylvania.  Once more - Barrett got mega-trammeled in his own home
&gt; State.

&gt; So, what actually happened?

&gt; In short, the State of Pennsylvania, relying on quackpot legal
&gt; arguments, dreamed up, I think, in a basement in Allentown,
&gt; Pennsylvania, cost the taxpayers a bundle of cash for a prosecution
&gt; that simply should not have happened.  The result of the legal action
&gt; backfired on Pennsylvania, and the &quot;quackbusters&quot;, and solidified, and
&gt; now protects, biological dentistry, the Cavitat device, and the sale
&gt; and recommendation of vitamins and supplements by dentists, in
&gt; Pennsylvania - and very likely, the rest of the US.

&gt; More - the State of Pennsylvania originally started out this case with
&gt; Robert S. Baratz MD, PhD, DDS (Bobbie Baratz) as their witness.  But,
&gt; before long, they dropped him cold, and went for someone else, who, in
&gt; the end, turned out no better than Bobbie would have been.  The word's
&gt; getting around about Bobbie.

&gt; On April 11th, 2007, a letter was sent to Stephen Evan's attorney
&gt; Charlie Brown by representatives of the Pennsylvania Chief Counsel's
&gt; office saying:  &quot;Enclosed please find an Order issued by the
&gt; Pennsylvania State Board of Dentistry adopting the hearing examiner's
&gt; proposed adjudication in the above referenced matter.&quot;

&gt; There were five parts to the Order.  (1)  The History.  (2)  The
&gt; Discussion.  (3)  The Conclusions of Law.  (4)  The Findings of Fact.
&gt; (5)  And the Order itself.  What is of vital importance, nationwide,
&gt; to dentistry, are two things, as part of the order, in this case:
&gt; (1)  The conclusions of law, and (2)  the findings of fact.  Since I
&gt; have a copy that has obviously been FAXed and reFAXed several times,

In the Matter of Mark Probert (Admitted as Mark S. Probert), a
Suspended Attorney, Respondent.
Grievance Committee for the Tenth Judicial District, Petitioner.

92-02731

SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK, APPELLATE DIVISION, SECOND DEPARTMENT

183 A.D.2d 282; 590 N.Y.S.2d 747

November 9, 1992, Decided

PRIOR HISTORY:   [***1]

Disciplinary proceedings instituted by the Grievance Committee for the
Tenth Judicial District. Respondent was admitted to the Bar on
February 15, 1978, at a term of the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court in the Second Judicial Department, under the name Mark S.
Probert.

DISPOSITION: Ordered that the petitioner's motion to impose discipline
upon the respondent based upon his failure to appear or answer is
granted; and it is further,

HEADNOTES: Attorney and Client - Disciplinary Proceedings

Respondent attorney, who is charged with 22 counts of failing to
cooperate with investigations of alleged misconduct by the Grievance
Committee, and who has failed to answer or appear, is disbarred.

COUNSEL:

Frank A. Finnerty, Jr., Westbury (Muriel L. Gennosa of counsel), for
petitioner.

JUDGES: Mangano, P. J., Thompson, Bracken, Sullivan and Harwood, JJ.,
concur.

Ordered that the petitioner's motion to impose discipline upon the
respondent based upon his failure to appear or answer is granted; and
it is further,

Ordered that pursuant to Judiciary Law § 90, effective immediately,
the respondent, Mark Probert, is disbarred and his name is stricken
from the roll of attorneys and counselors-at-law; and it is further,

Ordered that the respondent shall continue to comply with this Court's
rules governing the conduct of disbarred, suspended and resigned
attorneys (22 NYCRR 691.10); and it is further,

Ordered that pursuant to Judiciary [***2]  Law § 90, the respondent,
Mark Probert, is commanded to continue to desist and refrain (1) from
practicing law in any form, either as principal or as agent, clerk or
employee of another, (2) from appearing as an attorney or
counselor-at-law before any court, Judge, Justice, board, commission
or other public authority, (3) from giving to another an opinion as to
the law or its application or any advice in relation thereto, and (4)
from holding himself out in any way as an attorney and
counselor-at-law.

OPINIONBY: Per Curiam.

OPINION:  [*282]

[**747]  By decision and order of this Court dated September 29,
1989, the respondent was suspended from the practice of law until the
further order of this Court based upon his failure to cooperate with
the Grievance Committee. By further order of this Court dated June 4,
1992, the Grievance Committee was authorized to institute and
prosecute a disciplinary proceeding  [*283]  against the respondent
and the Honorable Moses M. Weinstein was appointed as Special Referee.

[**748]  A notice of petition and petition was personally served upon
the respondent on July 2, 1992. No answer was forthcoming. The
petitioner now moves to hold the [***3]  respondent in default. The
motion was personally served upon the respondent on August 14, 1992.
The respondent has failed to submit any papers in response to the
default motion.

The charges involve 22 counts of the respondent's failure to cooperate
with the Grievance Committee in its investigations into complaints of
professional misconduct.

The charges, if established, would require the imposition of a
disciplinary sanction against the respondent. Since the respondent has
chosen not to appear or answer in these proceedings, the charges must
be deemed established. The petitioner's motion to hold the respondent
in default and impose discipline is, therefore, granted. Accordingly,
the respondent is disbarred and his name is stricken from the roll of
attorneys and counselors-at-law, effective immediately

There is Sodium in Sodium Chloride.  There is Chlorine in Sodium

Thank you, Tim for pin-pointing their exact defamations and
disinformation. Kingoff did a nice succinct job.

Your questions are similar to those Darlene Sherrell asked about
flurodiation that got her SLAPP sued by the Sue Happy Barrett ... he
lost to her too, after years and years of having to defend herself.
Her co-defendent died during that SLAPP suit ...

I have a 'feeling' that Barrett &amp; Polevoy are hoping that same fate
befalls us ... it's hard to believe the amount of flacks &amp; flak that
have been filling the internet since he launched their assaults on us.

The Pseudo-Skeptic / Quackbuster Regime have to be held accountable
for the propaganda they have been spreading for years based not on
&quot;science&quot; ... but 'wishin' &amp; a hopin'.

Evidence is clear that there is a subset of people who react very
strongly to amalgam poisoning their systems ... some tolerate well ...
some don't. Their continual false claim that it (or breast implants or
vaccinations or fluoride) is &quot;safe&quot; ignores large bodies of evidence
proving otherwise.

http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/skeptic
SKEPTIC:  One who instinctively or habitually doubts, questions, or
disagrees with assertions or generally accepted conclusions.

TRUE Skeptics, by definition, question and disbelieve the &quot;generally
accepted&quot; ... Barrett's Fake or Pseudo Skeptics do the opposite ...
hailing the phycsian lobby, the AMA

~~~~~~~~~~

I found the Judges opinions of your beloved QuackHeads very succinct
... the fake experts were Barrett &amp; Wallace Sampson.

http://www.humanticsfoundation.com/kingbio.htm

Quote:

The trial court concluded NCAHF failed to prove a false or misleading
statement. King Bio’s expert testified the products were safe and
effective. The products were included in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia
and complied with FDA guidelines.

NCAHF presented no evidence that King Bio’s products were not safe and
effective, relying instead on a general attack on homeopathy, made by
witnesses who had no knowledge of, or experience with, King Bio’s
products, and who were found to be biased and unworthy of credibility.

&quot;Liquid mercury has the ability to dissolve other metals to produce
alloys and these alloys are called amalgams. Amalgam examples are
gold/mercury, silver/mercury and copper/mercury all of which are used
in dentistry&quot;.

http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/vchemlib/mol/glossary/

&quot;Any alloy of mercury and another metal. Some amalgams occur
naturally. Note: There is a mineral known as Amalgam, and, although it
is an amalgam, should not be confused with the term amalgam&quot;.

http://www.inlandlapidary.com/user_area/glossaryA.asp

&quot;An amalgam is any mixture or blending of mercury with another metal
or with an alloy&quot;.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalgam

And don't forget http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/amalgam

It's really simple, Tim - an amalgam is an alloy of mercury and some
other metal or alloy. Nobody is denying that there is mercury in
dental amalgam (for to do so would be stupid), just that there is any
meaning to the term &quot;mercury amalgam&quot;. The use of the term (especially
by someone who has been repeatedly advised of the facts) indicates an
ignorance of metallurgy, chemistry and reality.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;(2)  Then, please show us documentation for the statement &quot;Amalgams
&gt;are safe, effective, &amp; durable.&quot;
">

Anyone who denies that dental amalgam is effective and durable is so
obsessed with amalgam that any attempt at conversation would be
futile, so let's just stick to safe. The fact that literally billions
of amalgam fillings have been inserted over the last 175 years
suggests safety, otherwise there would be millions of people showing
obvious effects, but let's just let the scientists do the talking.
Here are two examples:

Neuropsychological and Renal Effects of Dental Amalgam in Children

JAMA. 2006;295:1775-1783.

Conclusions
In this study, there were no statistically significant differences in
adverse neuropsychological or renal effects observed over the 5-year
period in children whose caries were restored using dental amalgam or
composite materials. Although it is possible that very small IQ
effects cannot be ruled out, these findings suggest that the health
effects of amalgam restorations in children need not be the basis of
treatment decisions when choosing restorative dental materials.

http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/295/15/1775?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS...;

http://tinyurl.com/2n2btu

Neurobehavioral Effects of Dental Amalgam in Children

JAMA. 2006;295:1784-1792.

Conclusions
In this study, children who received dental restorative treatment with
amalgam did not, on average, have statistically significant
differences in neurobehavioral assessments or in nerve conduction
velocity when compared with children who received resin composite
materials without amalgam. These findings, combined with the trend of
higher treatment need later among those receiving composite, suggest
that amalgam should remain a viable dental restorative option for
children.

http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/295/15/1784?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS...;

http://tinyurl.com/2v88hv

But while we are talking about durability:

The longevity of amalgam versus compomer/composite restorations in
posterior primary and permanent teeth

J Am Dent Assoc, Vol 138, No 6, 763-772.

Conclusion.

Although the overall difference in longevity was not statistically
significant, compomer was replaced significantly more frequently owing
to recurrent caries, and composite restorations required seven times
as many repairs as did amalgam restorations.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Please show us documentation that NICO is not a fraud. Some science
would do. The fact that credulous scientifically illiterate stool
handlers are susceptible to fraud should be obvious to anyone, which
is one of the reasons that they  are targeted in the marketing of
fraudulent medical practices.

Would they be the dentists in the list supplied to the court by Aetna?
You know, the ones who submitted fraudulent insurance claims, who were
so unsure about NICO that they had to lie in order to get paid for
treating it.

And again - please point us towards the science.

meaning of. But the fact is that it is a mercury amalgam comprised of
mercury and nickel. it is crucial if the public is going to make
decisions about something that they &quot;something&quot; be expressed in words
they understand.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Amalgams are safe, effective, &amp; durable.

&gt; &gt; But there's no mercury in them, right?? Oh wait, there is mercury in
&gt; &gt; the non existent Mercury amalgam. Lets see...the dentist wears a mask
&gt; &gt; when putting in the nonexistent mercury amalgam to protect him from
&gt; &gt; the mercury vapor that isn't there. Meanwhile the dental patient can't
&gt; &gt; wear a mask to protect them from the vapors, which explains why the
&gt; &gt; nonexistent mercury amalgam is safe.

&gt; See above and see all the Sodium &amp; Chlorine in your body.  You'll see
&gt; it even better if you get into a tub of water with a plugged in hair

&gt; &gt; &gt;NICO is fraud, something

&gt; &gt; You misspelled &quot;Zhen Jue is drunk on his ass which is why he couldn't

&gt; &gt;(1)  Please show some documentation for the statement you made &quot;There

&gt; &quot;Liquid mercury has the ability to dissolve other metals to produce

&gt; gold/mercury, silver/mercury and copper/mercury all of which are used
&gt; in dentistry&quot;.

&gt; http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/vchemlib/mol/glossary/

&gt; &quot;Any alloy of mercury and another metal. Some amalgams occur
&gt; naturally. Note: There is a mineral known as Amalgam, and, although it
&gt; is an amalgam, should not be confused with the term amalgam&quot;.

&gt; http://www.inlandlapidary.com/user_area/glossaryA.asp

&gt; &quot;An amalgam is any mixture or blending of mercury with another metal
&gt; or with an alloy&quot;.

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalgam

&gt; And don't forget http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/amalgam

&gt; It's really simple, Tim - an amalgam is an alloy of mercury and some
&gt; other metal or alloy. Nobody is denying that there is mercury in
&gt; dental amalgam (for to do so would be stupid), just that there is any
&gt; meaning to the term &quot;mercury amalgam&quot;. The use of the term (especially

&gt; &gt;(2)  Then, please show us documentation for the statement &quot;Amalgams
&gt; &gt;are safe, effective, &amp; durable.&quot;

&gt; Anyone who denies that dental amalgam is effective and durable is so
&gt; obsessed with amalgam that any attempt at conversation would be
&gt; futile, so let's just stick to safe. The fact that literally billions
&gt; of amalgam fillings have been inserted over the last 175 years
&gt; suggests safety, otherwise there would be millions of people showing
&gt; obvious effects, but let's just let the scientists do the talking.
&gt; Here are two examples:

&gt; Neuropsychological and Renal Effects of Dental Amalgam in Children

&gt; JAMA. 2006;295:1775-1783.

&gt; Conclusions
&gt; In this study, there were no statistically significant differences in
&gt; adverse neuropsychological or renal effects observed over the 5-year
&gt; period in children whose caries were restored using dental amalgam or
&gt; composite materials. Although it is possible that very small IQ
&gt; effects cannot be ruled out, these findings suggest that the health
&gt; effects of amalgam restorations in children need not be the basis of
&gt; treatment decisions when choosing restorative dental materials.

&gt; http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/295/15/1775?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS; ...

&gt; http://tinyurl.com/2n2btu

&gt; Neurobehavioral Effects of Dental Amalgam in Children

&gt; JAMA. 2006;295:1784-1792.

&gt; Conclusions
&gt; In this study, children who received dental restorative treatment with
&gt; amalgam did not, on average, have statistically significant
&gt; differences in neurobehavioral assessments or in nerve conduction
&gt; velocity when compared with children who received resin composite
&gt; materials without amalgam. These findings, combined with the trend of
&gt; higher treatment need later among those receiving composite, suggest
&gt; that amalgam should remain a viable dental restorative option for
&gt; children.

&gt; http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/295/15/1784?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS; ...

&gt; http://tinyurl.com/2v88hv

&gt; But while we are talking about durability:

&gt; The longevity of amalgam versus compomer/composite restorations in
&gt; posterior primary and permanent teeth

&gt; J Am Dent Assoc, Vol 138, No 6, 763-772.

&gt; Conclusion.

&gt; Although the overall difference in longevity was not statistically
&gt; significant, compomer was replaced significantly more frequently owing
&gt; to recurrent caries, and composite restorations required seven times
&gt; as many repairs as did amalgam restorations.

&gt; http://jada.ada.org/cgi/content/abstract/138/6/763

&gt; &gt;(3)  Then, please show us documentation for the statement &quot;NICO is

&gt; Please show us documentation that NICO is not a fraud. Some science
&gt; would do. The fact that credulous scientifically illiterate stool
&gt; handlers are susceptible to fraud should be obvious to anyone, which
&gt; is one of the reasons that they  are targeted in the marketing of
&gt; fraudulent medical practices.

&gt; &gt;Your third statement is outright defamation, for the term NICO, and
&gt; &gt;the science behind it, can be directly related to specific high-
&gt; &gt;ranking dentists in the US.

&gt; Would they be the dentists in the list supplied to the court by Aetna?
&gt; You know, the ones who submitted fraudulent insurance claims, who were
&gt; so unsure about NICO that they had to lie in order to get paid for
&gt; treating it.

&gt; And again - please point us towards the science.

&gt; &gt;I eagerly await your response, as do, I'm sure, my clients.

&gt; &gt;Would you like to just include, with your response, your real name and

You seem to misunderstand the function of a court. The fact that some

fraud in the wrong way has nothing to do with the validity (or even

Of course it's proved in dentists' offices. It has to be &quot;proved&quot; for
the dentists to then go on and bill the patients for curing it. I have
seen the list of some of the dentists who &quot;proved&quot; it (and then went
on to make insurance claims stating that they had done something else,
something for which the insurance company was prepared to pay). It was
a very impressive list of dentists, and I must thank you again for

I'll say this slowly, so even you can understand.

You said that the Dental Board in Pennsylvania &quot;Approves Cavitat
Device, NICO&quot;. I asked for evidence. There is nothing on the board
site about NICO. I am not interested in any court case, because that
will only represent what a court said. I want to see the Dental Board
say what you  said the Dental Board said.

The fact that you continually refuse to give a reference to anything
officially stated by the Dental Board is evidence that no such
statement exists.

Prove me wrong. Make me look like a fool. Just provide the URL of
somewhere where the Dental Board in Pennsylvania &quot;Approves Cavitat
Device, NICO&quot;.

Can't do it? I didn't think so.

Ha!
Poo-poo on your information reliability
if you can't produce your own backup.

Lack of reliability goes along with your

Thank you for finally admitting that the subject line of this thread
is a lie. I remind you that it was you who started the thread.

No dental board has approved the Cavitat device or recognises the
existence of NICO. Prove me wrong.

&gt;&gt; And again - please point us towards the science.

&gt;&gt; &gt;I eagerly await your response, as do, I'm sure, my clients.

&gt;You lose.  Even the ADA is now warning against mercury amalgams.  Give

Timmie, one of your biggest troubles is that you're not only a liar,
you're a stupid liar.  I say stupid, because it's so easy to
demonstrate in your case.  I just took myself over to the ADA's web
site, and their position, which is quite easy to find if you use the
search function, is that amalgam is a fine restorative material for
children and adults alike.  This position is on a paper dated April
2007, meaning it's recent.

&gt;And NICO has been proven in court and in the dentist's office.  Read

I don't know about Aetna, but I did research NICO and found no
evidence that it even exists as a dental phenomenon.  Locating it
seems to be done something like dowsing -- they just mystically know
it's there, since there's no objective test to show its presence.
Seems to be quite lucrative to treat, though.

Because, Timmie, you have not done that. When asked for proof, you tell
people that they should look it up themselves, in spite of the fact that
many people have already done so.

No, Timmie, the burden of proof remains in your hands. Either provide a
link to the actual documents, or be advised that your failure to do so
once again proves you are a liar.

No one has said that they have. Peter, David and I have looked for the
Pa. Dental Board you fail to further identify and have not located one
agency in Pennsylvania where there is any reference to NICO or Cavitat.
