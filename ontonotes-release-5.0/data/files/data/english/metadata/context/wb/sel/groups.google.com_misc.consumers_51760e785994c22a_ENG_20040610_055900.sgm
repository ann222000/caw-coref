*Kerry Plan Could Cut Insurance Premiums*

Catastrophic Relief Garnering Support

At the center of Kerry's ideas is his proposal to have the federal
government reimburse employers 75 percent of medical bills over $50,000
that a worker runs up in a year. The reimbursement would, in effect,
make the government a secondary insurer and ease costs for employers,
workers and private insurers.

In exchange for the benefit, Kerry would require employers to offer
insurance to every worker and to provide health programs that detect and
manage chronic illnesses such as high blood pressure early enough to
prevent the diseases from worsening.

Kerry's catastrophic-illness relief plan is the only new health care
proposal -- and the most expensive -- of this campaign season. It marks
the first time in 12 years that a political leader has attempted to
reorient the insurance market away from dodging the costliest patients
and in the direction of implementing higher quality of care.

The concept of a national reinsurance pool has garnered support from a
wide spectrum of players from labor unions and former Vermont governor
Howard Dean on the left to former House speaker Newt Gingrich and former
Bush economic adviser R. Glenn Hubbard on the right.

Creating a federal reinsurance program would reduce the sort of
uncertainty that makes it difficult, if not impossible, for small
businesses such as Phoenix Products to afford insurance, Kerry said.

&quot;It clearly would allow us to be more price-competitive,&quot; said Bruce
Bodaken, chairman of Blue Shield of California. Two independent analyses
found that the policy could reduce annual premiums by 10 percent, or
nearly $1,000 per person.

&quot;How do you reduce costs for Americans as well as cover the uninsured?&quot;
Kerry said in an interview. &quot;Mine is the first and only plan that has
sought to do both. In fact, we've found a way to do them.&quot; He envisions
a chain reaction in which lower premiums entice more individuals and
companies to buy insurance, and as more people are covered, costs come
down again.

It is not a new concept. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M.
Nixon considered reinsurance pools for the most extreme medical cases.
Today, the federal government serves as the ultimate reinsurer for
natural disasters and terrorist attacks.

Arth, a self-described libertarian who voted for Bush in 2000, [said] &quot;In this
environment, it is certainly worth looking at,&quot; he said. &quot;Nobody would turn
their back on this kind of relief, even if it only lasted a few years.&quot;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are more details:

http://www.johnkerry.com/issues/healthcare/

Affordable Health Care for Every American

John Kerry believes that your family's health is just as important as any
politician's in Washington. That's why he will give every American access to
the health care plan that the President and Members of Congress already have.
John Kerry has the courage to take on special interests to get health care
costs under control. He will stand up to big insurance and drug companies
that impede progress. John Kerry's health care plan takes care of our most
vulnerable citizens by covering every child and preserving and strengthening
Medicare.

George Bush has chosen to lavish tax cuts upon the wealthiest among us while
working Americans struggle to afford health care for their families. John
Kerry will take a different path. The American health care system has the
world's best doctors and nurses, the finest hospitals and the most effective
drugs. But far too many Americans can't afford or access the system. John
Kerry's health care plan will start by expanding health care coverage to
nearly 95 percent of Americans ? including nearly all children. Kerry is also
committed to assuring high quality health care by including a strong
enforceable patients? bill of rights and reducing medical errors.

Priorities

Give Every American Access to the Same Health Plan As Members of Congress

Nine million Federal employees get health care through the Federal
Employees Health Care Benefits program (FEHBP), which offers a wide range of
health plans with good benefits and affordable premiums. The Kerry plan will
allow every American access to this system. With tax-based incentives to
employers and tax credits to individuals and the self-employed, the Kerry
plan will ensure that this coverage is affordable. The most vulnerable
groups, including the unemployed and people ages 55-64 who are retired or not
covered by their employer, will also receive tax credits. To hold down
premiums, the federal government will reimburse companies for 75 percent of
catastrophic claims - lowering premiums by almost 10 percent or up to $1,000
per family.

Guaranteed Health Care for Every Child

Studies show that kids without health insurance are less likely to get
checkups or treatment for ear infections or asthma. Kids without health care
also have a harder time learning in school. In a new compact with the
states, the Federal government will pick up the cost of Medicaid coverage for
children in exchange for automatic enrollment of all school children eligible
for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Eligibility for coverage will
be extended to 300 percent of poverty-level incomes for children (57,00 for a
family of four), and coverage will be extended to the six million single and
childless adults who are uninsured and live below the poverty line.
Independent experts estimate that the Kerry plan will cover 99 percent of
America?s children.

For Workers In Between Jobs

There are approximately 8 million unemployed people in the United States
today. John Kerry believes that when you lose your job you shouldn't lose
your health care. That is why he is proposing a 75 percent tax credit to
assure workers can keep their health insurance between jobs.

For Retirees and Americans Age 55 to 64

Retirees and Americans age 55 to 64 have the hardest time buying coverage.
This less healthy population is often priced out of affordable coverage.
Kerry?s plan will allow these Americans to buy into the Congressional Health
Plan at an affordable price and give a 25 percent tax credit to make it even
more affordable.

Affordable Prescription Drugs for All

John Kerry supports adding a strong affordable prescription drug benefit to
Medicare. However, he believes that the prescription drug benefit should not
rely on HMOs or undermine retiree coverage that exists today. In addition,
the Kerry plan will reduce drug costs for everyone by: using the federal
government's purchasing power to induce giant drug wholesalers to pass along
to consumers the rebates they get from the drug manufacturers; getting more
affordable generic drugs to the market, giving states the flexibility to
negotiate better deals, and allowing people to buy quality drugs through
Canada.

Making Malpractice Insurance More Affordable

Medical malpractice insurance has become so expensive in some states that
physicians are moving or giving up their practices, cutting access to care
for their patients. The Kerry plan will hold down malpractice premiums by
requiring an impartial review of a claim before an individual could file suit
and by eliminating punitive damages except in egregious cases. Kerry's plan
will not put a cap on legitimate damage awards.

A Strong Enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights

Some candidates don?t believe that the patients? bill of rights matters and
that we should just focus on expanding coverage to the uninsured. John Kerry
disagrees. He believes that health insurance must be worth something when you
need it and he believes that doctors, nurses and patients should make health
care decisions, not HMO bureaucrats. That?s why he will fight for a strong
enforceable patients? bill of rights to assure patients get access to the
specialists they need, can choose their own doctor, have access to a real
appeals process, and can hold HMOs accountable when they make mistakes that
hurt the patients.

Lowering Costs with New Technology

The annual cost of health care in America is $1.6 trillion. About 25 percent
is spent on non-medical items, principally paperwork such as billing and
record-keeping. No other industry is so inefficient. This expensive drain on
the system can be cut in half with modern technology. Kerry's program will
offer a &quot;technology bonus&quot; as an incentive to health care providers and
insurers to update their procedures and switch to electronic records.

Sorry. I answered almost the same as you did, before I read your answer. Of
course you are 100% correct. Anyone who understands our system of government
should know that what you said is exactly the way things work, or don't work if
you are a taxpayer.

By rolling back Bush's huge tax giveaway to people making $200,000 year,
who get the majority of the money. I feel soooooo sorry for them.....not!

That means if you are part of the top 1% who got most of the tax cuts, you
would have to go back and somehow manage to survive on the after tax money you
made during the Clinton boom years. How awful. LOL.....

Remember the _whole_ reason for the tax cut on the wealthy in the first
place was _not_ because they deserve it, it is because some of the money
was supposed to &quot;trickle down&quot; to everyone else. I would much prefer
that money &quot;trickle&quot; thru the economy by funding a smarter health care
plan instead. The more health people are the better they can fit into
the economy.

And by way, Bush's Iraq money and his debt interest and a bunch of other stupid
things of his _also_ come &quot;from taxpayer's money&quot;. I don't know about you but
I would by far prefer to reform our broken down health care system for all
Americans than pay debt interest or throw the money away in the Middle East.

Note that Bush's Iraq war will cost hundreds of billions of dollars with
_no_ revenue raised to pay for it. John Kerry's health care plan will cost
$257 over 10 years and will be fully funded (no new debt added).

&gt;Hardly, healthcare should be &quot;free&quot; no? That leaves the taxpayers and
&gt;employers paying it.

&gt;&gt; It is not a new concept. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M.
&gt;&gt; Nixon considered reinsurance pools for the most extreme medical cases.
&gt;&gt; Today, the federal government serves as the ultimate reinsurer for
&gt;&gt; natural disasters and terrorist attacks.

&gt;&gt; *Kerry Plan Could Cut Insurance Premiums*

&gt;&gt; Catastrophic Relief Garnering Support

&gt;&gt; At the center of Kerry's ideas is his proposal to have the federal
&gt;&gt; government reimburse employers 75 percent of medical bills over $50,000
&gt;&gt; that a worker runs up in a year.

&gt;The Kerry plan would be a windfall for employers and insurance companies.

&gt;What we really need is a
&gt;Universial Single Payer Health Plan.

&gt;Just like the one suggested by Dennis Kucinich.
&gt;He calls his plan 'Medicare for All.&quot;

"/> John Kerry's Health Care Plan is _way_ better than what we got now. I'll take
any improvement over the train wreck we're stuck with now. It would be a
windfall for those employers who wish to use it and maybe a slight help to
insurance companies (or not) but there is also a ton of stuff to help
individuals. e.g. The 75 percent tax credit to assure workers can keep their
health insurance between jobs. JFK's plan is something that will make a HUGE
difference in people's lives, even though it is all voluntary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Give Every American Access to the Same Health Plan As Members of Congress

Nine million Federal employees get health care through the Federal
Employees Health Care Benefits program (FEHBP), which offers a wide range of
health plans with good benefits and affordable premiums. The Kerry plan will
allow every American access to this system. With tax-based incentives to
employers and tax credits to individuals and the self-employed, the Kerry
plan will ensure that this coverage is affordable. The most vulnerable
groups, including the unemployed and people ages 55-64 who are retired or not
covered by their employer, will also receive tax credits. To hold down
premiums, the federal government will reimburse companies for 75 percent of
catastrophic claims - lowering premiums by almost 10 percent or up to $1,000
per family.

Guaranteed Health Care for Every Child

Studies show that kids without health insurance are less likely to get
checkups or treatment for ear infections or asthma. Kids without health care
also have a harder time learning in school. In a new compact with the
states, the Federal government will pick up the cost of Medicaid coverage for
children in exchange for automatic enrollment of all school children eligible
for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Eligibility for coverage will
be extended to 300 percent of poverty-level incomes for children (57,00 for a
family of four), and coverage will be extended to the six million single and
childless adults who are uninsured and live below the poverty line.
Independent experts estimate that the Kerry plan will cover 99 percent of
America?s children.

For Workers In Between Jobs

There are approximately 8 million unemployed people in the United States
today. John Kerry believes that when you lose your job you shouldn't lose
your health care. That is why he is proposing a 75 percent tax credit to
assure workers can keep their health insurance between jobs.

For Retirees and Americans Age 55 to 64

Retirees and Americans age 55 to 64 have the hardest time buying coverage.
This less healthy population is often priced out of affordable coverage.
Kerry?s plan will allow these Americans to buy into the Congressional Health
Plan at an affordable price and give a 25 percent tax credit to make it even
more affordable.

Affordable Prescription Drugs for All

John Kerry supports adding a strong affordable prescription drug benefit to
Medicare. However, he believes that the prescription drug benefit should not
rely on HMOs or undermine retiree coverage that exists today. In addition,
the Kerry plan will reduce drug costs for everyone by: using the federal
government's purchasing power to induce giant drug wholesalers to pass along
to consumers the rebates they get from the drug manufacturers; getting more
affordable generic drugs to the market, giving states the flexibility to
negotiate better deals, and allowing people to buy quality drugs through
Canada.

Making Malpractice Insurance More Affordable

Medical malpractice insurance has become so expensive in some states that
physicians are moving or giving up their practices, cutting access to care
for their patients. The Kerry plan will hold down malpractice premiums by
requiring an impartial review of a claim before an individual could file suit
and by eliminating punitive damages except in egregious cases. Kerry's plan
will not put a cap on legitimate damage awards.

A Strong Enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights

Some candidates don?t believe that the patients? bill of rights matters and
that we should just focus on expanding coverage to the uninsured. John Kerry
disagrees. He believes that health insurance must be worth something when you
need it and he believes that doctors, nurses and patients should make health
care decisions, not HMO bureaucrats. That?s why he will fight for a strong
enforceable patients? bill of rights to assure patients get access to the
specialists they need, can choose their own doctor, have access to a real
appeals process, and can hold HMOs accountable when they make mistakes that
hurt the patients.

Lowering Costs with New Technology

The annual cost of health care in America is $1.6 trillion. About 25 percent
is spent on non-medical items, principally paperwork such as billing and
record-keeping. No other industry is so inefficient. This expensive drain on
the system can be cut in half with modern technology. Kerry's program will
offer a &quot;technology bonus&quot; as an incentive to health care providers and
insurers to update their procedures and switch to electronic records.

&gt;&gt; That's going to be a lot of taxes. I doubt all the corporate
&gt;&gt; profits are going to be enough to cover the current, projected
&gt;&gt; Medicare shortfalls, let alone the extra costs of putting
&gt;&gt; everyone on Medicare. Kucinich is as full of crap as any
&gt;&gt; other politician.

&gt;&gt; -Tom

&gt; Tell me how all of the other industrialized countries in the world are able to afford to provide
&gt; Universal Health Care to their citizens.

"/> High personal taxes and rationing care. Of course, as their
populations age, there will be even higher taxes and more rationing
of care. &quot;Universal&quot; is not a good word to describe nationalized
health care. Health care in Japan is &quot;universal,&quot; but probably
not what most Americans would accept.

&gt;The top 1% got most of tax cuts because they paid most of the taxes,
&gt;what a concept!

"/> Nope. They got most of the tax cuts because they put up the special
interest money to bribe politicians. The top 1% elites got most of the cuts
because taxes on non-wage income was cut much more than wage income
thanks to their special interest money.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Remember the _whole_ reason for the tax cut on the wealthy in the first

&gt;from your income that goes to the IRS. It's money you work for. To
&gt;say someone doesn't &quot;deserve&quot; the money they work for is pure bullshit.
&gt; Do you work? Do you deserve your money that you're paid?

"/> Bullshit. Bush consistently said over and over that the reason for the tax
cuts was supposed to be to create jobs. He sold the tax cuts to congress
solely on the premise that they were supposed to create jobs. Even though his
own economists estimated that the cuts would cost the treasury $400,000 per
job created!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; it is because some of the money
&gt;&gt; was supposed to &quot;trickle down&quot; to everyone else.

&gt;so you don't believe in trickle down economics. Ever get a job from a

"/> LOL. Bush's own economists estimated that the cuts would cost the treasury
$400,000 per job created! (This was wildly optimistic because there were
actually millions of jobs lost since the tax cuts started in 2001).
Any competent person can think of a hundred ways to create jobs for less than
$400,000 per job. The Kerry health care plan will save businesses and
employees $288 billion over 10 years and reduce labor costs by $1000 per
American worker.

*Kerry Plan Could Cut Insurance Premiums*
Catastrophic Relief Garnering Support

&quot;It clearly would allow us to be more price-competitive,&quot; said Bruce
Bodaken, chairman of Blue Shield of California. Two independent analyses
found that the policy could reduce annual premiums by 10 percent, or
nearly $1,000 per person.

Emory University health economist Kenneth E. Thorpe estimates the
reinsurance program would save businesses and employees $288 billion in
premiums over a decade but cost the government $257 billion because of
administrative reductions.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Bush spending $400,000 per (wildly optimistic) job created is hardly efficient,
unless the real purpose for the cuts was to give away a huge windfall to pay
back the wealthy special interest investors in his presidency.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I would much prefer
&gt;&gt; that money &quot;trickle&quot; thru the economy by funding a smarter health care
&gt;&gt; plan instead.

&gt;ah, now you believe in trickle down economics.

"/> The &quot;trickle&quot; can come from any direction. Sideways, up, down, or multiple
directions at once. JFK's health care plan saves business $288 billion
in labor costs over 10 years in addition to directly creating more jobs
and giving tax credits to the middle class. Reducing labor costs on every
job by $1000 alone is quite a strong &quot;trickle&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Americans than pay debt interest or throw the money away in the Middle East.

&gt;Then surely you must support raising taxes on those makeing less than
&gt;$200,000 a year too. Lets double the income taxes on the $0-$50,000
&gt;income tax bracket.

"/> I'm not running for President. Only the top 1% of people making more than
$200,000 would have tax rates rolled back to the Clinton era under Kerry's
plan, probably because they got most of the tax cuts. All Americans
(hundreds of millions of people) would benefit from more health care choices
and cheaper labor costs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Note that Bush's Iraq war will cost hundreds of billions of dollars with

top 1% yes. Is Bush's method of charging a $400,000,000,000 dollar Iraq
war on a government Master Card better? That kind of gross mismanagement is
why debt interest was the 2nd biggest government spending item until Clinton.
Because Bush borrowed the entire amount of the Iraq War, when you factor in
years of debt interest on the unpaid sum, the real cost of the war will
be _trillions_ of dollars paid by American taxpayers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that a worker runs up in a year.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He calls his plan 'Medicare for All.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think he needs to fire his marketing department. Many

John Kerry has the courage to take on special interests to get health care

vulnerable citizens by covering every child and preserving and strengthening
Medicare.

George Bush has chosen to lavish tax cuts upon the wealthiest among us while

world's best doctors and nurses, the finest hospitals and the most effective

Kerry's health care plan will start by expanding health care coverage to
nearly 95 percent of Americans including nearly all children. Kerry is also
committed to assuring high quality health care by including a strong
enforceable patients bill of rights and reducing medical errors.

Priorities

Give Every American Access to the Same Health Plan As Members of Congress

Nine million Federal employees get health care through the Federal
Employees Health Care Benefits program (FEHBP), which offers a wide range of
health plans with good benefits and affordable premiums. The Kerry plan will
allow every American access to this system. With tax-based incentives to
employers and tax credits to individuals and the self-employed, the Kerry
plan will ensure that this coverage is affordable. The most vulnerable
groups, including the unemployed and people ages 55-64 who are retired or not
covered by their employer, will also receive tax credits. To hold down
premiums, the federal government will reimburse companies for 75 percent of
catastrophic claims - lowering premiums by almost 10 percent or up to $1,000
per family.

Guaranteed Health Care for Every Child

Studies show that kids without health insurance are less likely to get
checkups or treatment for ear infections or asthma. Kids without health care
also have a harder time learning in school. In a new compact with the
states, the Federal government will pick up the cost of Medicaid coverage for
children in exchange for automatic enrollment of all school children eligible
for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Eligibility for coverage will
be extended to 300 percent of poverty-level incomes for children (57,00 for a
family of four), and coverage will be extended to the six million single and
childless adults who are uninsured and live below the poverty line.
Independent experts estimate that the Kerry plan will cover 99 percent of
America?s children.

For Workers In Between Jobs

There are approximately 8 million unemployed people in the United States
today. John Kerry believes that when you lose your job you shouldn't lose
your health care. That is why he is proposing a 75 percent tax credit to
assure workers can keep their health insurance between jobs.

For Retirees and Americans Age 55 to 64

Retirees and Americans age 55 to 64 have the hardest time buying coverage.
This less healthy population is often priced out of affordable coverage.
Kerry?s plan will allow these Americans to buy into the Congressional Health
Plan at an affordable price and give a 25 percent tax credit to make it even
more affordable.

Affordable Prescription Drugs for All

John Kerry supports adding a strong affordable prescription drug benefit to
Medicare. However, he believes that the prescription drug benefit should not
rely on HMOs or undermine retiree coverage that exists today. In addition,
the Kerry plan will reduce drug costs for everyone by: using the federal
government's purchasing power to induce giant drug wholesalers to pass along
to consumers the rebates they get from the drug manufacturers; getting more
affordable generic drugs to the market, giving states the flexibility to
negotiate better deals, and allowing people to buy quality drugs through
Canada.

Making Malpractice Insurance More Affordable

Medical malpractice insurance has become so expensive in some states that
physicians are moving or giving up their practices, cutting access to care
for their patients. The Kerry plan will hold down malpractice premiums by
requiring an impartial review of a claim before an individual could file suit
and by eliminating punitive damages except in egregious cases. Kerry's plan
will not put a cap on legitimate damage awards.

A Strong Enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights

Some candidates don?t believe that the patients? bill of rights matters and
that we should just focus on expanding coverage to the uninsured. John Kerry
disagrees. He believes that health insurance must be worth something when you
need it and he believes that doctors, nurses and patients should make health
care decisions, not HMO bureaucrats. That?s why he will fight for a strong
enforceable patients? bill of rights to assure patients get access to the
specialists they need, can choose their own doctor, have access to a real
appeals process, and can hold HMOs accountable when they make mistakes that
hurt the patients.

Lowering Costs with New Technology

The annual cost of health care in America is $1.6 trillion. About 25 percent
is spent on non-medical items, principally paperwork such as billing and
record-keeping. No other industry is so inefficient. This expensive drain on
the system can be cut in half with modern technology. Kerry's program will
offer a &quot;technology bonus&quot; as an incentive to health care providers and
insurers to update their procedures and switch to electronic records.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *Kerry Plan Could Cut Insurance Premiums*

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Catastrophic Relief Garnering Support

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At the center of Kerry's ideas is his proposal to have the federal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; government reimburse employers 75 percent of medical bills over $50,000
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that a worker runs up in a year.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Kerry plan would be a windfall for employers and insurance companies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What we really need is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Universial Single Payer Health Plan.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just like the one suggested by Dennis Kucinich.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He calls his plan 'Medicare for All.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think he needs to fire his marketing department. Many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people don't like Medicare and for good reason. Did
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kucinich mention where the money will come from to cover
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the projected Medicare shortfalls under the current program?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Tom

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, Kucinich would tax the hell out of the rich corporations.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's going to be a lot of taxes. I doubt all the corporate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; profits are going to be enough to cover the current, projected
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Medicare shortfalls, let alone the extra costs of putting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everyone on Medicare. Kucinich is as full of crap as any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other politician.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Tell me how all of the other industrialized countries in the world
&gt;&gt;&gt; are able to afford to provide Universal Health Care to their citizens.

&gt;&gt; High personal taxes

&gt; Nope. We dont.

"/> These look high to me:

$0 – $6,000
Nil

$6,001 – $21,600
17c for each $1 over $6,000

$21,601 - $52,000
$2,652 plus 30c for each $1 over $21,600

$52,001 – $62,500
$11,772 plus 42c for each $1 over $52,000

Over $62,500
$16,182 plus 47c for each $1 over $62,500

What kind of deductions do you get?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; and rationing care.

&gt; Nope, particularly not for the health care that matters.

"/> There are long waiting lists for elective surgeries,
MRI's, etc... That is rationing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Sure, they dont cover the cosmetic crap, if you want to piss your
&gt; money against the wall on that, you're welcome to pay for that yourself.

&gt; And your system rations health care anyway.

"/> Sure. Demand is virtually unlimited, so you have to.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Of course, as their populations age, there will
&gt;&gt; be even higher taxes and more rationing of care.

&gt; Just as true of your system.

"/> Agree in spades.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&quot;Universal&quot; is not a good word to describe nationalized health care.

&gt; Corse it is. It just means that everyone is entitled
&gt; to it, regardless of their capacity to pay for it etc.

"/> Who cares if you can't deliver it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Health care in Japan is &quot;universal,&quot; but probably
&gt;&gt; not what most Americans would accept.

&gt; There's plenty of first world countrys with universal
&gt; health care systems that most americans would accept.

"/> Accept, maybe. Unfortunately, they don't want it enough
to vote for it. Regardless, major reforms will be
necessary as the population ages in First World countries.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Catastrophic Relief Garnering Support

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At the center of Kerry's ideas is his proposal to have the federal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; government reimburse employers 75 percent of medical bills over $50,000
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that a worker runs up in a year.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Kerry plan would be a windfall for employers and insurance companies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What we really need is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Universial Single Payer Health Plan.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just like the one suggested by Dennis Kucinich.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He calls his plan 'Medicare for All.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think he needs to fire his marketing department. Many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people don't like Medicare and for good reason. Did
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kucinich mention where the money will come from to cover
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the projected Medicare shortfalls under the current program?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Tom

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, Kucinich would tax the hell out of the rich corporations.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's going to be a lot of taxes. I doubt all the corporate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; profits are going to be enough to cover the current, projected
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Medicare shortfalls, let alone the extra costs of putting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everyone on Medicare. Kucinich is as full of crap as any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other politician.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tell me how all of the other industrialized countries in the world
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are able to afford to provide Universal Health Care to their citizens.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; High personal taxes

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope. We dont.

&gt;&gt; These look high to me:

&gt; Best get your eyes tested then.

&gt;&gt; $0 - $6,000
&gt;&gt; Nil

&gt;&gt; $6,001 - $21,600
&gt;&gt; 17c for each $1 over $6,000

&gt;&gt; $21,601 - $52,000
&gt;&gt; $2,652 plus 30c for each $1 over $21,600

&gt;&gt; $52,001 - $62,500
&gt;&gt; $11,772 plus 42c for each $1 over $52,000

&gt;&gt; Over $62,500
&gt;&gt; $16,182 plus 47c for each $1 over $62,500

&gt; In practice most pay in the range of 15-20%
&gt; of what they earn in income tax. Those on
&gt; welfare alone pay no income tax.

&gt; And you lot pay much more in state taxes than we do.

&gt; And what matters is the amount collected per
&gt; capita for health care, regardless of who pays
&gt; it. You pay more than twice what we do.

&gt;&gt; What kind of deductions do you get?

&gt; Massive ones for kids, not so much deductions as actual payments.

&gt; Thats one area that I disagree with completely, quite mad.

&gt; Classic middle class welfare, collect the taxes from the
&gt; middle class mostly, because those at the bottom pay
&gt; little if any income tax at all, pump that money thru the
&gt; bureaucracy, and straight back to those it was collected from.

&gt; Barking mad.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and rationing care.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope, particularly not for the health care that matters.

&gt;&gt; There are long waiting lists for elective surgeries, MRI's, etc...

&gt; Nope.

"/> That's not what your press says.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; That is rationing.

&gt; Nope, rationing is refusal to supply.

"/> How long does the wait have to be before you consider it &quot;refusal
to supply.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, they dont cover the cosmetic crap, if you want to piss your
&gt;&gt;&gt; money against the wall on that, you're welcome to pay for that yourself.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And your system rations health care anyway.

&gt;&gt; Sure. Demand is virtually unlimited, so you have to.

&gt; So there wasnt any point in your comment about rationing.

"/> The point is that you are just using a different method of
rationing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, as their populations age, there will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be even higher taxes and more rationing of care.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just as true of your system.

&gt;&gt; Agree in spades.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Universal&quot; is not a good word to describe nationalized health care.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Corse it is. It just means that everyone is entitled
&gt;&gt;&gt; to it, regardless of their capacity to pay for it etc.

&gt;&gt; Who cares if you can't deliver it?

&gt; We can and do deliver it.

&gt; We also have a system of 24/7 medical centers where
&gt; a visit doesnt cost you a cent and the waiting times arent
&gt; anything special, what you lot get when you pay for the service.

&gt; I had a 2 week stay in hospital that didnt cost
&gt; me a cent, except for something to read and
&gt; a TV if I wanted to rent one. I didnt bother.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Health care in Japan is &quot;universal,&quot; but probably
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not what most Americans would accept.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There's plenty of first world countrys with universal
&gt;&gt;&gt; health care systems that most americans would accept.

&gt;&gt; Accept, maybe. Unfortunately, they
&gt;&gt; don't want it enough to vote for it.

&gt; You dont know that, its never been put the vote.

"/> It's been &quot;test balooned&quot; more than once and shot
down each time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Regardless, major reforms will be necessary
&gt;&gt; as the population ages in First World countries.

&gt; Nope, our system will work fine with that. So will
&gt; the system every other first world country has too.

"/> Wrong. Look around at the projected costs. There
is some US$40 trillion in unfunded Medicare liability in
the US. We are taking it from future generations.

There are no waiting lists for non elective surgery.

A very big percentage of those who are in the age groups
that use medical services a lot have medical insurance.
That eliminates waiting time for elective surgery.

Plenty in the age groups that dont use medical services
much dont bother with insurance and just pay for what
surgery they need that is elective. That isnt that expensive
and for those is cheaper than the insurance.

There is no risk whatever of a financial disaster because
all the very expensive surgical proceedures are paid for
by the health care system and dont have waiting lists at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's not what your press says.

&gt;&gt; You seem ready to eat it up when it agrees with you.

&gt; Even you should be able to manage a more

&gt; I have never ever done anything of the kind.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There are no waiting lists for non elective surgery.

&gt;&gt; Yea, apparently they cull people from the waiting

&gt;&gt; list lengths than the doctors themselves quote. Two

&gt; Doesnt happen if you have insurance.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A very big percentage of those who are in the age groups
&gt;&gt;&gt; that use medical services a lot have medical insurance.
&gt;&gt;&gt; That eliminates waiting time for elective surgery.

&gt;&gt; Private insurance tends to frown on people
&gt;&gt; who use a lot of medical services.

&gt; They cant do that here. They cant even refuse you insurance
&gt; here, or charge you more if you use medical services a lot either.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Plenty in the age groups that dont use medical services
&gt;&gt;&gt; much dont bother with insurance and just pay for what
&gt;&gt;&gt; surgery they need that is elective. That isnt that expensive
&gt;&gt;&gt; and for those is cheaper than the insurance.

&gt;&gt; One surgery here can pretty much break you.

&gt; Yep, your system is completely stupid.
&gt; Not the case in any other first world country.

&gt;&gt; Just a normal baby delivery can run an uninsured person US$7k+.

&gt; That is completely free here. No waiting list either.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no risk whatever of a financial disaster because
&gt;&gt;&gt; all the very expensive surgical proceedures are paid for
&gt;&gt;&gt; by the health care system and dont have waiting lists at all.

&gt;&gt; Sorry, but there are waitlists for urgent care

&gt; Lie.

&gt;&gt; and they are getting longer.

&gt; Nor for urgent care they aint.

&gt;&gt; People are also being pushed out beyond

Toss in over-medication, unnecessary tests, etc... and you see

I would prefer not to pay for this kind of stuff. The bureaucracy
adds up to about 20 cents on the dollar (but there are things
like Kaiser that are equal or better than Medicare in terms of
overhead costs). Costs went up 16% last year, so that pretty
much ate any savings we would of had by eliminating bureaucracy.

Affordable Health Care for Every American

John Kerry believes that your family's health is just as important as any
politician's in Washington. That's why he will give every American access to
the health care plan that the President and Members of Congress already have.
John Kerry has the courage to take on special interests to get health care
costs under control. He will stand up to big insurance and drug companies
that impede progress. John Kerry's health care plan takes care of our most
vulnerable citizens by covering every child and preserving and strengthening
Medicare.

George Bush has chosen to lavish tax cuts upon the wealthiest among us while
working Americans struggle to afford health care for their families. John
Kerry will take a different path. The American health care system has the
world's best doctors and nurses, the finest hospitals and the most effective
drugs. But far too many Americans can't afford or access the system. John
Kerry's health care plan will start by expanding health care coverage to
nearly 95 percent of Americans including nearly all children. Kerry is also
committed to assuring high quality health care by including a strong
enforceable patients bill of rights and reducing medical errors.

Priorities

Give Every American Access to the Same Health Plan As Members of Congress

Nine million Federal employees get health care through the Federal
Employees Health Care Benefits program (FEHBP), which offers a wide range of
health plans with good benefits and affordable premiums. The Kerry plan will
allow every American access to this system. With tax-based incentives to
employers and tax credits to individuals and the self-employed, the Kerry
plan will ensure that this coverage is affordable. The most vulnerable
groups, including the unemployed and people ages 55-64 who are retired or not
covered by their employer, will also receive tax credits. To hold down
premiums, the federal government will reimburse companies for 75 percent of
catastrophic claims - lowering premiums by almost 10 percent or up to $1,000
per family.

Guaranteed Health Care for Every Child

Studies show that kids without health insurance are less likely to get
checkups or treatment for ear infections or asthma. Kids without health care
also have a harder time learning in school. In a new compact with the
states, the Federal government will pick up the cost of Medicaid coverage for
children in exchange for automatic enrollment of all school children eligible
for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Eligibility for coverage will
be extended to 300 percent of poverty-level incomes for children (57,00 for a
family of four), and coverage will be extended to the six million single and
childless adults who are uninsured and live below the poverty line.
Independent experts estimate that the Kerry plan will cover 99 percent of
America?s children.

For Workers In Between Jobs

There are approximately 8 million unemployed people in the United States
today. John Kerry believes that when you lose your job you shouldn't lose
your health care. That is why he is proposing a 75 percent tax credit to
assure workers can keep their health insurance between jobs.

For Retirees and Americans Age 55 to 64

Retirees and Americans age 55 to 64 have the hardest time buying coverage.
This less healthy population is often priced out of affordable coverage.
Kerry?s plan will allow these Americans to buy into the Congressional Health
Plan at an affordable price and give a 25 percent tax credit to make it even
more affordable.

Affordable Prescription Drugs for All

John Kerry supports adding a strong affordable prescription drug benefit to
Medicare. However, he believes that the prescription drug benefit should not
rely on HMOs or undermine retiree coverage that exists today. In addition,
the Kerry plan will reduce drug costs for everyone by: using the federal
government's purchasing power to induce giant drug wholesalers to pass along
to consumers the rebates they get from the drug manufacturers; getting more
affordable generic drugs to the market, giving states the flexibility to
negotiate better deals, and allowing people to buy quality drugs through
Canada.

Making Malpractice Insurance More Affordable

Medical malpractice insurance has become so expensive in some states that
physicians are moving or giving up their practices, cutting access to care
for their patients. The Kerry plan will hold down malpractice premiums by
requiring an impartial review of a claim before an individual could file suit
and by eliminating punitive damages except in egregious cases. Kerry's plan
will not put a cap on legitimate damage awards.

A Strong Enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights

Some candidates don?t believe that the patients? bill of rights matters and
that we should just focus on expanding coverage to the uninsured. John Kerry
disagrees. He believes that health insurance must be worth something when you
need it and he believes that doctors, nurses and patients should make health
care decisions, not HMO bureaucrats. That?s why he will fight for a strong
enforceable patients? bill of rights to assure patients get access to the
specialists they need, can choose their own doctor, have access to a real
appeals process, and can hold HMOs accountable when they make mistakes that
hurt the patients.

Lowering Costs with New Technology

The annual cost of health care in America is $1.6 trillion. About 25 percent
is spent on non-medical items, principally paperwork such as billing and
record-keeping. No other industry is so inefficient. This expensive drain on
the system can be cut in half with modern technology. Kerry's program will
offer a &quot;technology bonus&quot; as an incentive to health care providers and
insurers to update their procedures and switch to electronic records.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If by &quot;increase&quot; you mean a rollback on those making more than
&gt;&gt;$200,000 to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rates of the Clinton boom years yes. The richest 1% will have to somehow

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Clinton boom
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;years. Sounds like a terrible hardship LOL. You know what a real
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hardship is?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A child who is sick and can't get treatment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You Libs crack me up. A tax cut is now just a &quot;rollback&quot;, doesn't sound
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;so harsh when you say &quot;rollback&quot; vs. &quot;hike&quot; huh?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Harsh?? You have lost all sense of perspective. Getting the same amount of
&gt;&gt;&gt; after tax income they got in the Clinton boom years for the richest 1% is not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;harsh&quot; by any wild stretch of the imagination.

&gt;&gt;Neither is rolling back those Clinton tax hikes.
&gt; Bush the reactionary has been &quot;rolling back&quot; Republican President Teddy
&gt; Roosevelt's Robber Baron era tax reforms from 100 years ago. Clinton's tax
&gt; rates, making the very wealthy pay a fair share, produced 21 million new
&gt; _jobs_ plus budget _surpluses_, the most prosperous economy in history.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope, many of Bush's tax giveaways are completely new. And JFK could
&gt;&gt;&gt; always borrow the money like Bush does to pay for Bush's spending spiral

&gt;&gt;&gt; That Bush is grossly irresponsible is not a good thing it is a _bad_ thing.
&gt;&gt;Funny, Kerry voted for the Iraq War. If the Iraq War is irresponsible
&gt;&gt;so is Kerry.

&gt; Kerry didn't vote for the wasteful $87 billion windfall giveway on contracts
&gt; to Haliburton and friends, he only voted for what made sense (e.g. _yes_ on
&gt; body armor, _no_ to no bid contracts for Bush's friends). And JFK voted to
&gt; give Bush leverage with the UN, not for Bush's incredible fiasco of mistakes.

&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Affordable Health Care for Every American

&gt; John Kerry believes that your family's health is just as important as any
&gt; politician's in Washington. That's why he will give every American access to
&gt; the health care plan that the President and Members of Congress already have.
&gt; John Kerry has the courage to take on special interests to get health care
&gt; costs under control. He will stand up to big insurance and drug companies
&gt; that impede progress. John Kerry's health care plan takes care of our most
&gt; vulnerable citizens by covering every child and preserving and strengthening
&gt; Medicare.

&gt; George Bush has chosen to lavish tax cuts upon the wealthiest among us while
&gt; working Americans struggle to afford health care for their families. John
&gt; Kerry will take a different path. The American health care system has the
&gt; world's best doctors and nurses, the finest hospitals and the most effective
&gt; drugs. But far too many Americans can't afford or access the system. John
&gt; Kerry's health care plan will start by expanding health care coverage to
&gt; nearly 95 percent of Americans including nearly all children. Kerry is also
&gt; committed to assuring high quality health care by including a strong
&gt; enforceable patients bill of rights and reducing medical errors.

&gt; Priorities

&gt; Give Every American Access to the Same Health Plan As Members of Congress

&gt; Nine million Federal employees get health care through the Federal
&gt; Employees Health Care Benefits program (FEHBP), which offers a wide range of
&gt; health plans with good benefits and affordable premiums. The Kerry plan will
&gt; allow every American access to this system. With tax-based incentives to
&gt; employers and tax credits to individuals and the self-employed, the Kerry
&gt; plan will ensure that this coverage is affordable. The most vulnerable
&gt; groups, including the unemployed and people ages 55-64 who are retired or not
&gt; covered by their employer, will also receive tax credits. To hold down
&gt; premiums, the federal government will reimburse companies for 75 percent of
&gt; catastrophic claims - lowering premiums by almost 10 percent or up to $1,000
&gt; per family.

&gt; Guaranteed Health Care for Every Child

&gt; Studies show that kids without health insurance are less likely to get
&gt; checkups or treatment for ear infections or asthma. Kids without health care
&gt; also have a harder time learning in school. In a new compact with the
&gt; states, the Federal government will pick up the cost of Medicaid coverage for
&gt; children in exchange for automatic enrollment of all school children eligible
&gt; for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Eligibility for coverage will
&gt; be extended to 300 percent of poverty-level incomes for children (57,00 for a
&gt; family of four), and coverage will be extended to the six million single and
&gt; childless adults who are uninsured and live below the poverty line.
&gt; Independent experts estimate that the Kerry plan will cover 99 percent of
&gt; America?s children.

&gt; For Workers In Between Jobs

&gt; There are approximately 8 million unemployed people in the United States
&gt; today. John Kerry believes that when you lose your job you shouldn't lose
&gt; your health care. That is why he is proposing a 75 percent tax credit to
&gt; assure workers can keep their health insurance between jobs.

&gt; For Retirees and Americans Age 55 to 64

&gt; Retirees and Americans age 55 to 64 have the hardest time buying coverage.
&gt; This less healthy population is often priced out of affordable coverage.
&gt; Kerry?s plan will allow these Americans to buy into the Congressional Health
&gt; Plan at an affordable price and give a 25 percent tax credit to make it even
&gt; more affordable.

&gt; Affordable Prescription Drugs for All

&gt; John Kerry supports adding a strong affordable prescription drug benefit to
&gt; Medicare. However, he believes that the prescription drug benefit should not
&gt; rely on HMOs or undermine retiree coverage that exists today. In addition,
&gt; the Kerry plan will reduce drug costs for everyone by: using the federal
&gt; government's purchasing power to induce giant drug wholesalers to pass along
&gt; to consumers the rebates they get from the drug manufacturers; getting more
&gt; affordable generic drugs to the market, giving states the flexibility to
&gt; negotiate better deals, and allowing people to buy quality drugs through
&gt; Canada.

&gt; Making Malpractice Insurance More Affordable

&gt; Medical malpractice insurance has become so expensive in some states that
&gt; physicians are moving or giving up their practices, cutting access to care
&gt; for their patients. The Kerry plan will hold down malpractice premiums by
&gt; requiring an impartial review of a claim before an individual could file suit
&gt; and by eliminating punitive damages except in egregious cases. Kerry's plan
&gt; will not put a cap on legitimate damage awards.

&gt; A Strong Enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights

&gt; Some candidates don?t believe that the patients? bill of rights matters and
&gt; that we should just focus on expanding coverage to the uninsured. John Kerry
&gt; disagrees. He believes that health insurance must be worth something when you
&gt; need it and he believes that doctors, nurses and patients should make health
&gt; care decisions, not HMO bureaucrats. That?s why he will fight for a strong
&gt; enforceable patients? bill of rights to assure patients get access to the
&gt; specialists they need, can choose their own doctor, have access to a real
&gt; appeals process, and can hold HMOs accountable when they make mistakes that
&gt; hurt the patients.

&gt; Lowering Costs with New Technology

&gt; The annual cost of health care in America is $1.6 trillion. About 25 percent
&gt; is spent on non-medical items, principally paperwork such as billing and
&gt; record-keeping. No other industry is so inefficient. This expensive drain on
&gt; the system can be cut in half with modern technology. Kerry's program will
&gt; offer a &quot;technology bonus&quot; as an incentive to health care providers and
&gt; insurers to update their procedures and switch to electronic records.

"/> Downwards is the _least_ efficient way to pump money into the economy right
now and any decent economist knows that. But since this thread is about
John Kerry's health care plan I only need to show how it reduces labor
costs by an average $1000 for every worker.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A16748-2004Jun4
Could Cut Insurance Premiums*
Catastrophic Relief Garnering Support

At the center of Kerry's ideas is his proposal to have the federal
government reimburse employers 75 percent of medical bills over $50,000
that a worker runs up in a year. The reimbursement would, in effect,
make the government a secondary insurer and ease costs for employers,
workers and private insurers.

In exchange for the benefit, Kerry would require employers to offer
insurance to every worker and to provide health programs that detect and
manage chronic illnesses such as high blood pressure early enough to
prevent the diseases from worsening.

Kerry's catastrophic-illness relief plan is the only new health care
proposal -- and the most expensive -- of this campaign season. It marks
the first time in 12 years that a political leader has attempted to
reorient the insurance market away from dodging the costliest patients
and in the direction of implementing higher quality of care.

The concept of a national reinsurance pool has garnered support from a
wide spectrum of players from labor unions and former Vermont governor
Howard Dean on the left to former House speaker Newt Gingrich and former
Bush economic adviser R. Glenn Hubbard on the right.

Creating a federal reinsurance program would reduce the sort of
uncertainty that makes it difficult, if not impossible, for small
businesses such as Phoenix Products to afford insurance, Kerry said.

&quot;It clearly would allow us to be more price-competitive,&quot; said Bruce
Bodaken, chairman of Blue Shield of California. Two independent analyses
found that the policy could reduce annual premiums by 10 percent, or
nearly $1,000 per person.

&quot;How do you reduce costs for Americans as well as cover the uninsured?&quot;
Kerry said in an interview. &quot;Mine is the first and only plan that has
sought to do both. In fact, we've found a way to do them.&quot; He envisions
a chain reaction in which lower premiums entice more individuals and
companies to buy insurance, and as more people are covered, costs come
down again.

It is not a new concept. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M.
Nixon considered reinsurance pools for the most extreme medical cases.
Today, the federal government serves as the ultimate reinsurer for
natural disasters and terrorist attacks.

Arth, a self-described libertarian who voted for Bush in 2000, [said] &quot;In this
environment, it is certainly worth looking at,&quot; he said. &quot;Nobody would turn
their back on this kind of relief, even if it only lasted a few years.&quot;

On their way to extinction because it's possible for the oligarchs to

VDARE.com: 06/14/04 - The Jobs That Aren't

If a nation wants a middle class, it has to work to create and keep it...

http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0618-03.htm
Scrooge &amp; Marley, Inc. -- The True Conservative Agenda

&quot;Scrooge &amp; Marley, Inc. -- The True Conservative Agenda
by Thom Hartmann

&quot;That liberty [is pure] which is to go to all, and not to the few or
the rich alone.&quot;
--Thomas Jefferson to Horatio Gates, 1798.

There is nothing &quot;normal&quot; about a nation having a middle class, even
though it is vital to the survival of democracy.

As twenty-three years of conservative economic policies have now shown
millions of un- and underemployed Americans, what's &quot;normal&quot; in a
&quot;free and unfettered&quot; economy is the rapid evolution of a small but
fabulously wealthy ownership class, and a large but poor working
class. In the entire history of civilization, outside of a small
mercantilist class and the very few skilled tradesmen who'd managed to
organize in guilds (the earliest unions) like the ancient Masons, the
middle class was an aberration.

If a nation wants a middle class, it must define it, desire it, and
work to both create and keep it.

This is because a middle class is the creation of government
participation (conservatives call it &quot;interference&quot;) in the
marketplace, by determining the rules of the game of business and of
taxation, and by providing free public education to all. And it wasn't
until 1776, when Thomas Jefferson replaced John Locke's right to
&quot;life, liberty and property&quot; with &quot;life liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness&quot; that the idea of a large class of working people having the
ability to &quot;pursue happiness&quot; - the middle class - was even seriously
considered as a cornerstone obligation of government.

[snip]

A totally &quot;free&quot; market where corporations reign supreme, just like
the oppressive governments of old, Jefferson said could transform
America &quot;...until the bulk of the society is reduced to be mere
automatons of misery, to have no sensibilities left but for sinning
and suffering. Then begins, indeed, the bellum omnium in omnia, which
some philosophers observing to be so general in this world, have
mistaken it for the natural, instead of the abusive state of man.&quot;

As Jefferson realized, with no government &quot;interference&quot; by setting
the rules of the game of business and fair taxation, there will be no
middle class...&quot;

The U.S. has a very wealthy neighbor, Mexico, who has a small group of
very wealthy people and a huge group of poor people, and few people in
between.

&gt; Nope, we dont. Our total tax take is about the same as yours.

"/> Now that is going to take a bit of data - don't you think?

http://www.mof.go.jp/english/zei/report2/zc001b06.htm

oops - seems that these data suggest otherwise...and

the OECD doesn't seem to think so -

http://www.oecd.org/searchResult/0,2665,en_2649_201185_1_1_1_1_1,00.html

In fact, total tax revenue as a percent of GDP in the Euro 15 is about
41.5% (2001) whereas it is under 30% in the US. Canada? 35+%

Yes, Alice, the Europeans are taxed quite heavily to afford health
care - and the affordability of health care is as big an issue for the
Europeans as it is for Americans.

DATA are king.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Affordable Health Care for Every American

John Kerry believes that your family's health is just as important as any
politician's in Washington. That's why he will give every American access to
the health care plan that the President and Members of Congress already have.
John Kerry has the courage to take on special interests to get health care
costs under control. He will stand up to big insurance and drug companies
that impede progress. John Kerry's health care plan takes care of our most
vulnerable citizens by covering every child and preserving and strengthening
Medicare.

George Bush has chosen to lavish tax cuts upon the wealthiest among us while
working Americans struggle to afford health care for their families. John
Kerry will take a different path. The American health care system has the
world's best doctors and nurses, the finest hospitals and the most effective
drugs. But far too many Americans can't afford or access the system. John
Kerry's health care plan will start by expanding health care coverage to
nearly 95 percent of Americans including nearly all children. Kerry is also
committed to assuring high quality health care by including a strong
enforceable patients bill of rights and reducing medical errors.

Priorities

Give Every American Access to the Same Health Plan As Members of Congress

Nine million Federal employees get health care through the Federal
Employees Health Care Benefits program (FEHBP), which offers a wide range of
health plans with good benefits and affordable premiums. The Kerry plan will
allow every American access to this system. With tax-based incentives to
employers and tax credits to individuals and the self-employed, the Kerry
plan will ensure that this coverage is affordable. The most vulnerable
groups, including the unemployed and people ages 55-64 who are retired or not
covered by their employer, will also receive tax credits. To hold down
premiums, the federal government will reimburse companies for 75 percent of
catastrophic claims - lowering premiums by almost 10 percent or up to $1,000
per family.

Guaranteed Health Care for Every Child

Studies show that kids without health insurance are less likely to get
checkups or treatment for ear infections or asthma. Kids without health care
also have a harder time learning in school. In a new compact with the
states, the Federal government will pick up the cost of Medicaid coverage for
children in exchange for automatic enrollment of all school children eligible
for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Eligibility for coverage will
be extended to 300 percent of poverty-level incomes for children (57,00 for a
family of four), and coverage will be extended to the six million single and
childless adults who are uninsured and live below the poverty line.
Independent experts estimate that the Kerry plan will cover 99 percent of
America?s children.

For Workers In Between Jobs

There are approximately 8 million unemployed people in the United States
today. John Kerry believes that when you lose your job you shouldn't lose
your health care. That is why he is proposing a 75 percent tax credit to
assure workers can keep their health insurance between jobs.

For Retirees and Americans Age 55 to 64

Retirees and Americans age 55 to 64 have the hardest time buying coverage.
This less healthy population is often priced out of affordable coverage.
Kerry?s plan will allow these Americans to buy into the Congressional Health
Plan at an affordable price and give a 25 percent tax credit to make it even
more affordable.

Affordable Prescription Drugs for All

John Kerry supports adding a strong affordable prescription drug benefit to
Medicare. However, he believes that the prescription drug benefit should not
rely on HMOs or undermine retiree coverage that exists today. In addition,
the Kerry plan will reduce drug costs for everyone by: using the federal
government's purchasing power to induce giant drug wholesalers to pass along
to consumers the rebates they get from the drug manufacturers; getting more
affordable generic drugs to the market, giving states the flexibility to
negotiate better deals, and allowing people to buy quality drugs through
Canada.

Making Malpractice Insurance More Affordable

Medical malpractice insurance has become so expensive in some states that
physicians are moving or giving up their practices, cutting access to care
for their patients. The Kerry plan will hold down malpractice premiums by
requiring an impartial review of a claim before an individual could file suit
and by eliminating punitive damages except in egregious cases. Kerry's plan
will not put a cap on legitimate damage awards.

A Strong Enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights

Some candidates don?t believe that the patients? bill of rights matters and
that we should just focus on expanding coverage to the uninsured. John Kerry
disagrees. He believes that health insurance must be worth something when you
need it and he believes that doctors, nurses and patients should make health
care decisions, not HMO bureaucrats. That?s why he will fight for a strong
enforceable patients? bill of rights to assure patients get access to the
specialists they need, can choose their own doctor, have access to a real
appeals process, and can hold HMOs accountable when they make mistakes that
hurt the patients.

Lowering Costs with New Technology

The annual cost of health care in America is $1.6 trillion. About 25 percent
is spent on non-medical items, principally paperwork such as billing and
record-keeping. No other industry is so inefficient. This expensive drain on
the system can be cut in half with modern technology. Kerry's program will
offer a &quot;technology bonus&quot; as an incentive to health care providers and
insurers to update their procedures and switch to electronic records.

to use the plan will save an average of $1000 per worker in health care
costs, and smaller companies could save a lot more than that. Companies
could do whatever they want with the savings. A company might simply add
the savings directly to their profits, increasing the P/E ratio and value of

Affordable Health Care for Every American

John Kerry believes that your family's health is just as important as any
politician's in Washington. That's why he will give every American access to
the health care plan that the President and Members of Congress already have.
John Kerry has the courage to take on special interests to get health care
costs under control. He will stand up to big insurance and drug companies
that impede progress. John Kerry's health care plan takes care of our most
vulnerable citizens by covering every child and preserving and strengthening
Medicare.

George Bush has chosen to lavish tax cuts upon the wealthiest among us while
working Americans struggle to afford health care for their families. John
Kerry will take a different path. The American health care system has the
world's best doctors and nurses, the finest hospitals and the most effective
drugs. But far too many Americans can't afford or access the system. John
Kerry's health care plan will start by expanding health care coverage to
nearly 95 percent of Americans including nearly all children. Kerry is also
committed to assuring high quality health care by including a strong
enforceable patients bill of rights and reducing medical errors.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Since this thread is about John Kerry's health care plan I only need
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to discuss one way: reducing labor costs by $1000 per worker. If a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the company can obviously create many more than one job with its $400,000
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;savings, even before you factor in that the company is better able
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to compete against foreign companies who for the most part are not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;handicapped by health care costs like US companies.

during later stages of relevant Senate/Congress debates many politicians

"/>&quot;We resent very deeply the false war crimes charges he made coming
back from Vietnam in 1971 and repeated in the book &quot;Tour of Duty.&quot; We
think those cast an aspersion on all those living and dead, from our
unit and other units in Vietnam. We think that he knew he was lying
when he made the charges, and we think that they're unsupportable. We
intend to bring the truth about that to the American people.

We believe, based on our experience with him, that he is totally unfit
to be the Commander-in-Chief.&quot;

-- John O'Neill, spokesman, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth

.

&quot;I do not believe John Kerry is fit to be Commander-in-Chief of the
armed forces of the United States. This is not a political issue. It
is a matter of his judgment, truthfulness, reliability, loyalty and
trust -- all absolute tenets of command. His biography, 'Tour of
Duty,' by Douglas Brinkley, is replete with gross exaggerations,
distortions of fact, contradictions and slanderous lies. His contempt
for the military and authority is evident by even a most casual review
of this biography. He arrived in-country with a strong anti-Vietnam
War bias and a self-serving determination to build a foundation for
his political future. He was aggressive, but vain and prone to
impulsive judgment, often with disregard for specific tactical
assignments. He was a 'loose cannon.' In an abbreviated tour of four
months and 12 days, and with his specious medals secure, Lt.(jg) Kerry
bugged out and began his infamous betrayal of all United States forces
in the Vietnam War. That included our soldiers, our marines, our
sailors, our coast guardsmen, our airmen, and our POWs. His leadership
within the so-called Vietnam Veterans Against the War and testimony
before Congress in 1971 charging us with unspeakable atrocities remain
an undocumented but nevertheless meticulous stain on the men and women
who honorably stayed the course. Senator Kerry is not fit for
command.&quot;

-- Rear Admiral Roy Hoffman, USN (retired), chairman, Swift Boat
Veterans for Truth

.

&quot;During Lt.(jg) Kerry's tour, he was under my command for two or three
specific operations, before his rapid exit. Trust, loyalty and
judgment are the key, operative words. His turncoat performance in
1971 in his grubby shirt and his medal-tossing escapade, coupled with
his slanderous lines in the recent book portraying us that served,
including all POWs and MIAs, as murderous war criminals, I believe,
will have a lasting effect on all military veterans and their
families.

Kerry would be described as devious, self-absorbing, manipulative,
disdain for authority, disruptive, but the most common phrase that
you'd hear is 'requires constant supervision.'&quot;

-- Captain Charles Plumly, USN (retired)

.

&quot;Thirty-five years ago, many of us fell silent when we came back to
the stain of sewage that Mr. Kerry had thrown on us, and all of our
colleagues who served over there. I don't intend to be silent today or
ever again. Our young men and women who are serving deserve no less.&quot;

-- Andrew Horne

.

&quot;In my specific, personal experience in both coastal and river patrols
over a 12-month period, I never once saw or heard anything remotely
resembling the atrocities described by Senator Kerry. If I had, it
would have been my obligation to report them in writing to a higher
authority, and I would certainly have done that. If Senator Kerry
actually witnessed or participated in these atrocities or, as he
described them, 'war crimes,' he was obligated to report them. That he
did not until later when it suited his political purposes strikes me
as opportunism of the worst kind. That he would malign my service and
that of his fellow sailors with no regard for the truth makes him
totally unqualified to serve as Commander-in-Chief.&quot;

-- Jeffrey Wainscott

.

&quot;I signed that letter because I, too felt a deep sense of betrayal
that someone who took the same oath of loyalty as I did as an officer
in the United States Navy would abandon his group here (points to
group photo) to join this group here (points to VVAW protest photo),
and come home and attempt to rally the American public against the
effort that this group was so valiantly pursuing.

It is a fact that in the entire Vietnam War we did not lose one major
battle. We lost the war at home... and at home, John Kerry was the
Field General.&quot;

-- Robert Elder

.

&quot;My daughters and my wife have read portions of the book 'Tour of
Duty.' They wanted to know if I took part in the atrocities described.
I do not believe the things that are described happened.

Let me give you an example. In Brinkley's book, on pages 170 to 171,
about something called the 'Bo De massacre' on November 24th of
1968... In Kerry's description of the engagement, first he claimed
there were 17 servicemen that were wounded. Three of us were wounded.
I was the first...&quot;

-- Joseph Ponder

.

&quot;While in Cam Rahn Bay, he trained on several 24-hour indoctrination
missions, and one special skimmer operation with my most senior and
trusted Lieutenant. The briefing from some members of that crew the
morning after revealed that they had not received any enemy fire, and
yet Lt.(jg) Kerry informed me of a wound -- he showed me a scratch on
his arm and a piece of shrapnel in his hand that appeared to be from
one of our own M-79s. It was later reported to me that Lt.(jg) Kerry
had fired an M-79, and it had exploded off the adjacent shoreline. I
do not recall being advised of any medical treatment, and probably
said something like 'Forget it.' He later received a Purple Heart for
that scratch, and I have no information as to how or whom.

Lt.(jg) Kerry was allowed to return to the good old USA after 4 months
and a few days in-country, and then he proceeded to betray his former
shipmates, calling them criminals who were committing atrocities.
Today we are here to tell you that just the opposite is true. Our
rules of engagement were quite strict, and the officers and men of
Swift often did not even return fire when they were under fire if
there was a possibility that innocent people -- fishermen, in a lot of
cases -- might be hurt or injured. The rules and the good intentions
of the men increased the possibility that we might take friendly
casualties.&quot;

-- Commander Grant Hibbard, USN (retired)

.

&quot;Lt. Kerry returned home from the war to make some outrageous
statements and allegations... of numerous criminal acts in violation
of the law of war were cited by Kerry, disparaging those who had
fought with honor in that conflict Had war crimes been committed by US
forces in Vietnam? Yes, but such acts were few and far between. Yet
Lt. Kerry have numerous speeches and testimony before Congress
inappropriately leading his audiences to believe that what was only an
anomaly in the conduct of America's fighting men was an epidemic.
Furthermore, he suggested that they were being encouraged to violated
the law of war by those within the chain of command.

Very specific orders, on file at the Vietnam archives at Texas Tech
University, were issued by my father [Admiral Elmo Zumwalt] and others
in his chain of command instructing subordinates to act responsibly in
preserving the life and property of Vietnamese civilians.&quot;

-- Lt. Col. James Zumwalt, USMC (retired)

.

&quot;We look at Vietnam... after all these years it is still languishing
in isolated poverty and helplessness and tyranny. This is John Kerry's
legacy. I deeply resent John Kerry's using his Swift boat experience,
and his betrayal of those who fought there as a stepping-stone to his
political ambitions.&quot;

-- Barnard Wolff

.

&quot;In a whole year that I spent patrolling, I didn't see anything like a
war crime, an atrocity, anything like that. Time and again I saw
American fighting men put themselves in graver danger trying to
avoid... collateral damage.

When John Kerry returned to the country, he was sworn in front of
Congress. And then he told my family -- my parents, my sister, my
brother, my neighbors -- he told everyone I knew and everyone I'd ever
know that I and my comrades had committed unspeakable atrocities.&quot;

-- David Wallace

.

&quot;I served with these guys. I went on missions with them, and these men
served honorably. Up and down the chain of command there was no
acquiescence to atrocities. It was not condoned, it did not happen,
and it was not reported to me verbally or in writing by any of these
men including Lt.(jg) Kerry.

In 1971, '72, for almost 18 months, he stood before the television
audiences and claimed that the 500,000 men and women in Vietnam, and
in combat, were all villains -- there were no heroes. In 2004, ...

Kerry's 2004 campaign platform. While he has pledged to make it one of his
first priorities, Bush's only pledge is to sit on his ass and ignore
another critical problem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Affordable Health Care for Every American

John Kerry believes that your family's health is just as important as any
politician's in Washington. That's why he will give every American access to
the health care plan that the President and Members of Congress already have.
John Kerry has the courage to take on special interests to get health care
costs under control. He will stand up to big insurance and drug companies
that impede progress. John Kerry's health care plan takes care of our most
vulnerable citizens by covering every child and preserving and strengthening
Medicare.

George Bush has chosen to lavish tax cuts upon the wealthiest among us while
working Americans struggle to afford health care for their families. John
Kerry will take a different path. The American health care system has the
world's best doctors and nurses, the finest hospitals and the most effective
drugs. But far too many Americans can't afford or access the system. John
Kerry's health care plan will start by expanding health care coverage to
nearly 95 percent of Americans including nearly all children. Kerry is also
committed to assuring high quality health care by including a strong
enforceable patients bill of rights and reducing medical errors.

Priorities

Give Every American Access to the Same Health Plan As Members of Congress

Nine million Federal employees get health care through the Federal
Employees Health Care Benefits program (FEHBP), which offers a wide range of
health plans with good benefits and affordable premiums. The Kerry plan will
allow every American access to this system. With tax-based incentives to
employers and tax credits to individuals and the self-employed, the Kerry
plan will ensure that this coverage is affordable. The most vulnerable
groups, including the unemployed and people ages 55-64 who are retired or not
covered by their employer, will also receive tax credits. To hold down
premiums, the federal government will reimburse companies for 75 percent of
catastrophic claims - lowering premiums by almost 10 percent or up to $1,000
per family.

Guaranteed Health Care for Every Child

Studies show that kids without health insurance are less likely to get
checkups or treatment for ear infections or asthma. Kids without health care
also have a harder time learning in school. In a new compact with the
states, the Federal government will pick up the cost of Medicaid coverage for
children in exchange for automatic enrollment of all school children eligible
for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Eligibility for coverage will
be extended to 300 percent of poverty-level incomes for children (57,00 for a
family of four), and coverage will be extended to the six million single and
childless adults who are uninsured and live below the poverty line.
Independent experts estimate that the Kerry plan will cover 99 percent of
America?s children.

For Workers In Between Jobs

There are approximately 8 million unemployed people in the United States
today. John Kerry believes that when you lose your job you shouldn't lose
your health care. That is why he is proposing a 75 percent tax credit to
assure workers can keep their health insurance between jobs.

For Retirees and Americans Age 55 to 64

Retirees and Americans age 55 to 64 have the hardest time buying coverage.
This less healthy population is often priced out of affordable coverage.
Kerry?s plan will allow these Americans to buy into the Congressional Health
Plan at an affordable price and give a 25 percent tax credit to make it even
more affordable.

Affordable Prescription Drugs for All

John Kerry supports adding a strong affordable prescription drug benefit to
Medicare. However, he believes that the prescription drug benefit should not
rely on HMOs or undermine retiree coverage that exists today. In addition,
the Kerry plan will reduce drug costs for everyone by: using the federal
government's purchasing power to induce giant drug wholesalers to pass along
to consumers the rebates they get from the drug manufacturers; getting more
affordable generic drugs to the market, giving states the flexibility to
negotiate better deals, and allowing people to buy quality drugs through
Canada.

Making Malpractice Insurance More Affordable

Medical malpractice insurance has become so expensive in some states that
physicians are moving or giving up their practices, cutting access to care
for their patients. The Kerry plan will hold down malpractice premiums by
requiring an impartial review of a claim before an individual could file suit
and by eliminating punitive damages except in egregious cases. Kerry's plan
will not put a cap on legitimate damage awards.

A Strong Enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights

Some candidates don?t believe that the patients? bill of rights matters and
that we should just focus on expanding coverage to the uninsured. John Kerry
disagrees. He believes that health insurance must be worth something when you
need it and he believes that doctors, nurses and patients should make health
care decisions, not HMO bureaucrats. That?s why he will fight for a strong
enforceable patients? bill of rights to assure patients get access to the
specialists they need, can choose their own doctor, have access to a real
appeals process, and can hold HMOs accountable when they make mistakes that
hurt the patients.

Lowering Costs with New Technology

The annual cost of health care in America is $1.6 trillion. About 25 percent
is spent on non-medical items, principally paperwork such as billing and
record-keeping. No other industry is so inefficient. This expensive drain on
the system can be cut in half with modern technology. Kerry's program will
offer a &quot;technology bonus&quot; as an incentive to health care providers and
insurers to update their procedures and switch to electronic records.

&gt;&gt;tell stories of his rescuing a Green Beret from drowning, killing a Viet

&gt;&gt;Did Bush rescue a Green Beret from drowning? Kill a Viet Cong sniper?
&gt;&gt;Rescue 42 Vietnamese from starvation? No, he used his political
&gt;&gt;connections to jump over a waiting list of hundreds and avoid Vietnam
&gt;&gt;service, then went AWOL.

&gt;&quot;We resent very deeply the false war crimes charges he made coming
&gt;back from Vietnam in 1971 and repeated in the book &quot;Tour of Duty.&quot; We
&gt;think those cast an aspersion on all those living and dead, from our
&gt;unit and other units in Vietnam. We think that he knew he was lying
&gt;when he made the charges, and we think that they're unsupportable. We
&gt;intend to bring the truth about that to the American people.

&gt;We believe, based on our experience with him, that he is totally unfit
&gt;to be the Commander-in-Chief.&quot;

"/> None of those Rush Limbaugh nuts were people who served in _combat_ with
Kerry, and none of this has jack sh*t to do with Kerry getting awarded 3
Purple Hearts, a Silver Star, and a Bronze Star. They found a few people
out of millions in Vietnam who don't like Kerry's politics. What a
surprise! One guy was whining that he didn't think Kerry sufficiently
supported LBJ's decision to send more troops in to Vietnam. I bet the Green
Beret who Kerry saved from drowning and 42 civilians saved by Kerry didn't
give a damn about that. It is disgusting that the GOP is always desperate
to smear Americans. BTW anyone who knows anything about Vietnam knows that
there _were_ war crimes, just like in Iraq when Rumsfield we now know
authorized the abuse of Iraqi prisoners in violation of international
law and shamed all of America.

Here is what the people who actually served in _combat_ with JFK said.

opportunity when you develop a serious or chronic medical problem. There
are some limit protections against this, but the bottom line is that any
American without government insurance (Medicare usually) can lose their
insurance at any time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No one else is &quot;managing&quot; it either.

&gt;&gt;think those cast an aspersion on all those living and dead, from our

&gt;&gt;when he made the charges, and we think that they're unsupportable. We
&gt;&gt;intend to bring the truth about that to the American people.

&gt;&gt;We believe, based on our experience with him, that he is totally unfit

&gt;None of those Rush Limbaugh nuts were people who served in _combat_ with

&gt;out of millions in Vietnam who don't like Kerry's politics. What a
&gt;surprise! One guy was whining that he didn't think Kerry sufficiently
&gt;supported LBJ's decision to send more troops in to Vietnam. I bet the Green
&gt;Beret who Kerry saved from drowning and 42 civilians saved by Kerry didn't
&gt;give a damn about that. It is disgusting that the GOP is always desperate
&gt;to smear Americans. BTW anyone who knows anything about Vietnam knows that
&gt;there _were_ war crimes, just like in Iraq when Rumsfield we now know
&gt;authorized the abuse of Iraqi prisoners in violation of international

Here are some facts about the Australian system:

35% of medical services are paid for by private insurance or out of
pocket - NOT Medicare.

almost 50% of ALL Australians have private insurance for health care
to SUPPLEMENT the Commonwealth Medicare program.

Waiting lists for necessary surgeries are commonplace in your system

http://nsw.nationals.org.au/html/griffith_womans_surgery_date_resched...

From  http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20040331.wwait0331/BN...

&quot;For example, the median waiting time for hip replacement in 2000 was
162 days in Saskatchewan, compared with 98 days in Australia, 87 days
in Denmark, 148 days in Finland, 99 days in Norway and 211 days in the
United Kingdom.&quot;

Here's a treatise on &quot;socialized medicine&quot; that might interest you.

http://www.libertyhaven.com/politicsandcurrentevents/healthcarewelfar...

Your system sucks when you compare it to the US insured population.
The panacea of &quot;universal care&quot; is nothing more than the lowest common
denominator approach. The end result? Everyone gets marginal care
and those with money buy up to excellent care EXCEPT, those who buy up
end up paying for YOUR care as well as theirs - they pay twice.

Next time you post, do DATA, not emotional rhetoric and foot stomping.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe 16% of their populations are in a perpetual holding
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pattern, while awaiting their turn to be scheduled for an operation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The way I hear it from a good friend of mine in Canada,
&gt;&gt;&gt; people wait 6 months or whatever if they are picky about
&gt;&gt;&gt; which doctor does the operation, much less if they let it
&gt;&gt;&gt; be done by any doctor who is rated as qualified to do it.

&gt;Canada has as bad a record for waiting times as England.

"/>  Makes England sound not so bad if that is true.

In the USA, I had to wait a month to get a potentially cancerous mole
examined by a dermatologist. My friend in Canada tells me things are not
that much worse there unless you are picky about which doctor does the
proceedure. I think most doctors willing and supposedly qualified to do a
biopsy will do the job adequately.

My dentist in the USA has a long enough wait for appointments to
recommend scheduling my next 6-month cleaning on my way out from one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And in australia, if you care about that choice of doctor
&gt;&gt; question, you're welcome to have quite affordable
&gt;&gt; medical insurance that eliminates any wait with elective
&gt;&gt; surgery. There isnt any wait with non elective surgery.

&gt;So much for the tax-based Medicare system if you need private
&gt;supplemental insurance to avoid potentially deadly waits for
&gt;&quot;elective&quot; surgery.

&gt;Hey, how long is the wait for that needle biopsy? What about that
&gt;MRI?

"/>  What are your claimed figures for waits?

Most USA citizens need to buy what is a lot more than supplemental
insurance or else they pay out of pocket to get a needle biopsy at all.
And 16% have no coverage at all, even though government spends as high a
fraction of its nations GDP on healthcare as does government in the
nations that have national healthcare.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Some in a hurry for treatment by their favorite doctor pay out of pocket,

&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's generally the best approach here if you
&gt;&gt; arent in the high risk for elective surgery groups, quite
&gt;&gt; a bit cheaper than insurance, particularly if you never
&gt;&gt; actually need any elective surgery over 50 years etc.

&gt;OK - so if you have money in Australia you get faster better care - if
&gt;you don't, you get crappy care?

"/>  In the USA, if you don't have money to pay medical bills but make too
much to qualify for Medicaid you don't get even crappy care once the
emergency room &quot;stabilizes&quot; you - you get none at all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; but Canadians pay much less out of pocket than USA residents
&gt;&gt;&gt; do while having total government spending on healthcare
&gt;&gt;&gt; about the same percentage of GDP than the USA has.

&gt;&gt; Nope, the US spends more than 50% more on a GDP % basis.

&gt;Stupid - WRONG. Public expenditure on health care is 6.6% of GDP in
&gt;the US(2002) and in Australia it is 6.2% (2001 data) and in Canada it
&gt;is 6.7% (2002).

"/>  Maybe Rod was talking about total healthcare expenditures in any given
nation, but I'm surely making a claim as to the portion paid by government.
I think your figures of 6.6% of GDP for the US vs. 6.7% for Canada
indicate that the US taxpayers are getting no bargain for such
government spending that fails to remedy the need of private expenditure
in the hundreds of $ per month per covered person.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe 16% of their populations are in a perpetual holding
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pattern, while awaiting their turn to be scheduled for an operation.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The way I hear it from a good friend of mine in Canada,
&gt;&gt;&gt; people wait 6 months or whatever if they are picky about
&gt;&gt;&gt; which doctor does the operation, much less if they let it
&gt;&gt;&gt; be done by any doctor who is rated as qualified to do it.
&gt; Canada has as bad a record for waiting times as England.

&gt;&gt; And in australia, if you care about that choice of doctor
&gt;&gt; question, you're welcome to have quite affordable
&gt;&gt; medical insurance that eliminates any wait with elective
&gt;&gt; surgery. There isnt any wait with non elective surgery.
&gt; So much for the tax-based Medicare system if
&gt; you need private supplemental insurance to avoid
&gt; potentially deadly waits for &quot;elective&quot; surgery.

"/> Ours has always been a system which combines
medicare and insurance, ever since it was introduced.
And the tax system encourages insurance too.

The big advantage of that approach is that those who
are unlikely to need any elective surgery can choose to
not bother with the insurance when they can afford to
pay for what little elective surgery they might possibly
need, at a much lower cost than total paid in insurance.

I didnt bother with it for 50 years, still dont bother with it.
Had one serious medical problem after the usual childhood
higher risk situations, got that surgery immediately, and
the 2 week stay in hospital, and the post hospital physio
etc completely free, didnt pay a cent for it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Hey, how long is the wait for that needle biopsy?
&gt; What about that MRI?

"/> No wait at all. Happened to a mate of mine who
ended up with a major cancer just before last Xmas.

None of the surgery or chemo etc has cost him a cent.

Ditto with the significant medical treatment
that my father ended up needing in his 90s
either, no wait at all, didnt cost a cent.

The only real problem was that he didnt care much for
hospitals and chose to storm out after a fall ended up
with him in hospital. They appeared to try to bluff him
by telling him that there was a delay with the ambulance
to take him home, because they didnt want him to leave,
and he ended up whistling up a taxi and went home that way.
That was the only cost he incurred and that was peanuts.

The main cost was my airfare when he rang me up
and asked me to look after him after he got home.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Some in a hurry for treatment by their
&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite doctor pay out of pocket,
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's generally the best approach here if you
&gt;&gt; arent in the high risk for elective surgery groups, quite
&gt;&gt; a bit cheaper than insurance, particularly if you never
&gt;&gt; actually need any elective surgery over 50 years etc.
&gt; OK - so if you have money in Australia you get faster
&gt; better care - if you don't, you get crappy care?

and that happens to be one of the high demand areas.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Affordable Health Care for Every American

John Kerry believes that your family's health is just as important as any
politician's in Washington. That's why he will give every American access to
the health care plan that the President and Members of Congress already have.
John Kerry has the courage to take on special interests to get health care
costs under control. He will stand up to big insurance and drug companies
that impede progress. John Kerry's health care plan takes care of our most
vulnerable citizens by covering every child and preserving and strengthening
Medicare.

George Bush has chosen to lavish tax cuts upon the wealthiest among us while
working Americans struggle to afford health care for their families. John
Kerry will take a different path. The American health care system has the
world's best doctors and nurses, the finest hospitals and the most effective
drugs. But far too many Americans can't afford or access the system. John
Kerry's health care plan will start by expanding health care coverage to
nearly 95 percent of Americans including nearly all children. Kerry is also
committed to assuring high quality health care by including a strong
enforceable patients bill of rights and reducing medical errors.

Priorities

Give Every American Access to the Same Health Plan As Members of Congress

Nine million Federal employees get health care through the Federal
Employees Health Care Benefits program (FEHBP), which offers a wide range of
health plans with good benefits and affordable premiums. The Kerry plan will
allow every American access to this system. With tax-based incentives to
employers and tax credits to individuals and the self-employed, the Kerry
plan will ensure that this coverage is affordable. The most vulnerable
groups, including the unemployed and people ages 55-64 who are retired or not
covered by their employer, will also receive tax credits. To hold down
premiums, the federal government will reimburse companies for 75 percent of
catastrophic claims - lowering premiums by almost 10 percent or up to $1,000
per family.

Guaranteed Health Care for Every Child

Studies show that kids without health insurance are less likely to get
checkups or treatment for ear infections or asthma. Kids without health care
also have a harder time learning in school. In a new compact with the
states, the Federal government will pick up the cost of Medicaid coverage for
children in exchange for automatic enrollment of all school children eligible
for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Eligibility for coverage will
be extended to 300 percent of poverty-level incomes for children (57,00 for a
family of four), and coverage will be extended to the six million single and
childless adults who are uninsured and live below the poverty line.
Independent experts estimate that the Kerry plan will cover 99 percent of
America?s children.

For Workers In Between Jobs

There are approximately 8 million unemployed people in the United States
today. John Kerry believes that when you lose your job you shouldn't lose
your health care. That is why he is proposing a 75 percent tax credit to
assure workers can keep their health insurance between jobs.

For Retirees and Americans Age 55 to 64

Retirees and Americans age 55 to 64 have the hardest time buying coverage.
This less healthy population is often priced out of affordable coverage.
Kerry?s plan will allow these Americans to buy into the Congressional Health
Plan at an affordable price and give a 25 percent tax credit to make it even
more affordable.

Affordable Prescription Drugs for All

John Kerry supports adding a strong affordable prescription drug benefit to
Medicare. However, he believes that the prescription drug benefit should not
rely on HMOs or undermine retiree coverage that exists today. In addition,
the Kerry plan will reduce drug costs for everyone by: using the federal
government's purchasing power to induce giant drug wholesalers to pass along
to consumers the rebates they get from the drug manufacturers; getting more
affordable generic drugs to the market, giving states the flexibility to
negotiate better deals, and allowing people to buy quality drugs through
Canada.

Making Malpractice Insurance More Affordable

Medical malpractice insurance has become so expensive in some states that
physicians are moving or giving up their practices, cutting access to care
for their patients. The Kerry plan will hold down malpractice premiums by
requiring an impartial review of a claim before an individual could file suit
and by eliminating punitive damages except in egregious cases. Kerry's plan
will not put a cap on legitimate damage awards.

A Strong Enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights

Some candidates don?t believe that the patients? bill of rights matters and
that we should just focus on expanding coverage to the uninsured. John Kerry
disagrees. He believes that health insurance must be worth something when you
need it and he believes that doctors, nurses and patients should make health
care decisions, not HMO bureaucrats. That?s why he will fight for a strong
enforceable patients? bill of rights to assure patients get access to the
specialists they need, can choose their own doctor, have access to a real
appeals process, and can hold HMOs accountable when they make mistakes that
hurt the patients.

Lowering Costs with New Technology

The annual cost of health care in America is $1.6 trillion. About 25 percent
is spent on non-medical items, principally paperwork such as billing and
record-keeping. No other industry is so inefficient. This expensive drain on
the system can be cut in half with modern technology. Kerry's program will
offer a &quot;technology bonus&quot; as an incentive to health care providers and
insurers to update their procedures and switch to electronic records.

&gt;Vietnam who don't like Kerry's political views. That's what he and his
&gt;kind do and it is strictly for losers to consume.

"/> You didn't bother to read the cites, then. Those veterans served
before, during, and after the conveniently brief military career of
Kerry, and they were not impressed with his claims of bravery.

You are right about one thing, though - there are millions of soldiers
who served in Vietnam who don't like Kerry's political views. Can't
say as I blame them.

morning after revealed that they had not received any enemy fire, and
yet Lt.(jg) Kerry informed me of a wound -- he showed me a scratch on
his arm and a piece of shrapnel in his hand that appeared to be from
one of our own M-79s. It was later reported to me that Lt.(jg) Kerry
had fired an M-79, and it had exploded off the adjacent shoreline. I
do not recall being advised of any medical treatment, and probably
said something like 'Forget it.' He later received a Purple Heart for
that scratch, and I have no information as to how or whom.

Lt.(jg) Kerry was allowed to return to the good old USA after 4 months
and a few days in-country, and then he proceeded to betray his former
shipmates, calling them criminals who were committing atrocities.
Today we are here to tell you that just the opposite is true. Our
rules of engagement were quite strict, and the officers and men of
Swift often did not even return fire when they were under fire if
there was a possibility that innocent people -- fishermen, in a lot of
cases -- might be hurt or injured. The rules and the good intentions
of the men increased the possibility that we might take friendly
casualties.&quot;

&gt;Bullshit. No doubt you think all Americans who opposed the Iraq war
&gt;&quot;committed treason&quot; by &quot;aiding&quot; Saddam Hussein? Americans are guaranteed
&gt;something called &quot;free speech&quot; in a document called the &quot;bill of rights&quot;.

&gt;PCF-44 and PCF-94 have gushed about his poise under enemy fire. They
&gt;tell stories of his rescuing a Green Beret from drowning, killing a Viet
&gt;Cong sniper, and saving 42 Vietnamese civilians from starvation...Nobody
&gt;has campaigned harder for Kerry than his crewmates.

"/>&quot;During Lt.(jg) Kerry's tour, he was under my command for two or three
specific operations, before his rapid exit. Trust, loyalty and
judgment are the key, operative words. His turncoat performance in
1971 in his grubby shirt and his medal-tossing escapade, coupled with
his slanderous lines in the recent book portraying us that served,
including all POWs and MIAs, as murderous war criminals, I believe,
will have a lasting effect on all military veterans and their
families.

Kerry would be described as devious, self-absorbing, manipulative,
disdain for authority, disruptive, but the most common phrase that
you'd hear is 'requires constant supervision.'&quot;

*New Details of Prison Abuse Emerge*
Abu Ghraib Detainees' Statements Describe Sexual Humiliation And Savage
Beatings

Previously secret sworn statements by detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison
in Iraq describe in raw detail abuse that goes well beyond what has been
made public, adding allegations of prisoners being ridden like animals,
sexually fondled by female soldiers and forced to retrieve their food
from toilets.

The fresh allegations of prison abuse are contained in statements taken
from 13 detainees shortly after a soldier reported the incidents to
military investigators in mid-January. The detainees said they were
savagely beaten and repeatedly humiliated sexually by American soldiers
working on the night shift at Tier 1A in Abu Ghraib during the holy
month of Ramadan, according to copies of the statements obtained by The
Washington Post.

The statements provide the most detailed picture yet of what took place
on the cellblock. Some of the detainees described being abused as
punishment or discipline after they were caught fighting or with a
prohibited item. Some said they were pressed to denounce Islam or were
force-fed pork and liquor. Many provided graphic details of how they
were sexually humiliated and assaulted, threatened with rape, and forced
to masturbate in front of female soldiers.

&quot;They forced us to walk like dogs on our hands and knees,&quot; said Hiadar
Sabar Abed Miktub al-Aboodi, detainee No. 13077. &quot;And we had to bark
like a dog, and if we didn't do that they started hitting us hard on our
face and chest with no mercy. After that, they took us to our cells,
took the mattresses out and dropped water on the floor and they made us
sleep on our stomachs on the floor with the bags on our head and they
took pictures of everything.&quot;

Hilas also said he witnessed an Army translator having sex with a boy at
the prison. He said the boy was between 15 and 18 years old. Someone
hung sheets to block the view, but Hilas said he heard the boy's screams
and climbed a door to get a better look. Hilas said he watched the
assault and told investigators that it was documented by a female
soldier taking pictures.

Hilas told investigators that he asked Graner for the time one day
because he wanted to pray. He said Graner cuffed him to the bars of a
cell window and left him there for close to five hours, his feet
dangling off the floor. Hilas also said he watched as Graner and others
sodomized a detainee with a phosphoric light. &quot;They tied him to the
bed,&quot; Hilas said.

Mustafa Jassim Mustafa, detainee No. 150542, told military investigators
he also witnessed the phosphoric-light assault. He said it was around
the time of Ramadan, the holiest period of the Muslim year, when he
heard screams coming from a cell below. Mustafa said he looked down to
see a group of soldiers holding the detainee down and sodomizing him
with the light.

Graner was sodomizing him with the phosphoric light, Mustafa said. The
detainee &quot;was screaming for help. There was another tall white man who
was with Graner -- he was helping him. There was also a white female
soldier, short, she was taking pictures.&quot;

Another detainee told military investigators that American soldiers
sodomized and beat him. The detainee, whose name is being withheld by
The Post because he is an alleged victim of a sexual assault, said he
was kept naked for five days when he first arrived at Abu Ghraib and was
forced to kneel for four hours with a hood over his head. He said he was
beaten so badly one day that the hood flew off his head. &quot;The police was
telling me to crawl in Arabic, so I crawled on my stomach and the police
were spitting on me when I was crawling, and hitting me on my back, my
head and my feet,&quot; he said in his sworn statement.

The detainee said the soldiers eventually brought him to a room and
sodomized him with a nightstick. &quot;They were taking pictures of me during
all these instances,&quot; he told the investigators.
He also said Graner repeatedly threw the detainees' meals into the
toilets and said, &quot;Eat it.&quot;

Hussein Mohssein Mata Al-Zayiadi, detainee No. 19446, told investigators
that he was one of the hooded prisoners shown in photographs
masturbating before American soldiers. &quot;They told my friend to
masturbate and told me to masturbate also, while they were taking
pictures,&quot; he said.

Al-Zayiadi also said he and other detainees were beaten and tossed into
separate cells.

&quot;They opened the water in the cell and told us to lay face down in the
water and we stayed like that until the morning, in the water, naked,
without clothes,&quot; he said in his statement.

He also said soldiers forced him and others to perform like animals.

He said the soldiers told him that if he cooperated with interrogators
they would release him in time for Ramadan. He said he did, but still
was not released. He said one soldier continued to abuse him by striking
his broken leg and ordered him to curse Islam. &quot;Because they started to
hit my broken leg, I cursed my religion,&quot; he said. &quot;They ordered me to
thank Jesus that I'm alive.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It makes coverage more affordable, so it moves toward &quot;Universal&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;coverage. Private insurance protects you just the same as public

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope. In America priviate insurance will drop you at the earliest

&gt;Wrong. A large group has the power to negotiate with an insurer.

&gt;&gt; And
&gt;&gt; you can lose your large group plan at any time, assuming you have one to
&gt;&gt; start with, so protections are limited. Nearly 90 million Americans are
&gt;&gt; uninsured for part of the year. And if being in a large group plan is
&gt;&gt; the only method of getting treatment for your serious condition, than the
&gt;&gt; system is inefficient and downright stupid.

&gt;That is what you are advocating. What is government insurance other

"/> Nope.

The level of government interference we have now is the worst possible
situation because it is just sufficent to guarantee that the system is
horribly screwed up, but stops (barely) the system from collapsing
altogether. It is not a free market system, it is just a horrible screwed
up mess with more problems piling every year.

Affordable Health Care for Every American

John Kerry believes that your family's health is just as important as any
politician's in Washington. That's why he will give every American access to
the health care plan that the President and Members of Congress already have.
John Kerry has the courage to take on special interests to get health care
costs under control. He will stand up to big insurance and drug companies
that impede progress. John Kerry's health care plan takes care of our most
vulnerable citizens by covering every child and preserving and strengthening
Medicare.

George Bush has chosen to lavish tax cuts upon the wealthiest among us while
working Americans struggle to afford health care for their families. John
Kerry will take a different path. The American health care system has the
world's best doctors and nurses, the finest hospitals and the most effective
drugs. But far too many Americans can't afford or access the system. John
Kerry's health care plan will start by expanding health care coverage to
nearly 95 percent of Americans including nearly all children. Kerry is also
committed to assuring high quality health care by including a strong
enforceable patients bill of rights and reducing medical errors.

Priorities

Give Every American Access to the Same Health Plan As Members of Congress

Nine million Federal employees get health care through the Federal
Employees Health Care Benefits program (FEHBP), which offers a wide range of
health plans with good benefits and affordable premiums. The Kerry plan will
allow every American access to this system. With tax-based incentives to
employers and tax credits to individuals and the self-employed, the Kerry
plan will ensure that this coverage is affordable. The most vulnerable
groups, including the unemployed and people ages 55-64 who are retired or not
covered by their employer, will also receive tax credits. To hold down
premiums, the federal government will reimburse companies for 75 percent of
catastrophic claims - lowering premiums by almost 10 percent or up to $1,000
per family.

Guaranteed Health Care for Every Child

Studies show that kids without health insurance are less likely to get
checkups or treatment for ear infections or asthma. Kids without health care
also have a harder time learning in school. In a new compact with the
states, the Federal government will pick up the cost of Medicaid coverage for
children in exchange for automatic enrollment of all school children eligible
for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Eligibility for coverage will
be extended to 300 percent of poverty-level incomes for children (57,00 for a
family of four), and coverage will be extended to the six million single and
childless adults who are uninsured and live below the poverty line.
Independent experts estimate that the Kerry plan will cover 99 percent of
America?s children.

For Workers In Between Jobs

There are approximately 8 million unemployed people in the United States
today. John Kerry believes that when you lose your job you shouldn't lose
your health care. That is why he is proposing a 75 percent tax credit to
assure workers can keep their health insurance between jobs.

For Retirees and Americans Age 55 to 64

Retirees and Americans age 55 to 64 have the hardest time buying coverage.
This less healthy population is often priced out of affordable coverage.
Kerry?s plan will allow these Americans to buy into the Congressional Health
Plan at an affordable price and give a 25 percent tax credit to make it even
more affordable.

Affordable Prescription Drugs for All

John Kerry supports adding a strong affordable prescription drug benefit to
Medicare. However, he believes that the prescription drug benefit should not
rely on HMOs or undermine retiree coverage that exists today. In addition,
the Kerry plan will reduce drug costs for everyone by: using the federal
government's purchasing power to induce giant drug wholesalers to pass along
to consumers the rebates they get from the drug manufacturers; getting more
affordable generic drugs to the market, giving states the flexibility to
negotiate better deals, and allowing people to buy quality drugs through
Canada.

Making Malpractice Insurance More Affordable

Medical malpractice insurance has become so expensive in some states that
physicians are moving or giving up their practices, cutting access to care
for their patients. The Kerry plan will hold down malpractice premiums by
requiring an impartial review of a claim before an individual could file suit
and by eliminating punitive damages except in egregious cases. Kerry's plan
will not put a cap on legitimate damage awards.

A Strong Enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights

Some candidates don?t believe that the patients? bill of rights matters and
that we should just focus on expanding coverage to the uninsured. John Kerry
disagrees. He believes that health insurance must be worth something when you
need it and he believes that doctors, nurses and patients should make health
care decisions, not HMO bureaucrats. That?s why he will fight for a strong
enforceable patients? bill of rights to assure patients get access to the
specialists they need, can choose their own doctor, have access to a real
appeals process, and can hold HMOs accountable when they make mistakes that
hurt the patients.

Lowering Costs with New Technology

The annual cost of health care in America is $1.6 trillion. About 25 percent
is spent on non-medical items, principally paperwork such as billing and
record-keeping. No other industry is so inefficient. This expensive drain on
the system can be cut in half with modern technology. Kerry's program will
offer a &quot;technology bonus&quot; as an incentive to health care providers and
insurers to update their procedures and switch to electronic records.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It doesnt do a damned thing about UNIVERSAL COVER or eliminate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the risk of financial catastrophe with a serious medical
&gt; problem, fool.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It makes coverage more affordable, so it moves toward &quot;Universal&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;coverage. Private insurance protects you just the same as public
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;when you have serious medical problem, idiot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope. In America priviate insurance will drop you at the earliest
&gt; available
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opportunity when you develop a serious or chronic medical
&gt; problem. There
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are some limit protections against this, but the bottom line is that any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; American without government insurance (Medicare usually) can lose their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; insurance at any time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wrong. Large group plans will not do this. There are any

&gt;&gt;&gt; Only because of existing government interference in the free market.

&gt;&gt;Wrong. A large group has the power to negotiate with an insurer.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And
&gt;&gt;&gt; you can lose your large group plan at any time, assuming you have one to
&gt;&gt;&gt; start with, so protections are limited. Nearly 90 million Americans are
&gt;&gt;&gt; uninsured for part of the year. And if being in a large group plan is
&gt;&gt;&gt; the only method of getting treatment for your serious condition, than the
&gt;&gt;&gt; system is inefficient and downright stupid.

&gt;&gt;That is what you are advocating. What is government insurance other

&gt; Nope.

"/> Yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; The level of government interference we have now is the worst possible
&gt; situation because it is just sufficent to guarantee that the system is
&gt; horribly screwed up, but stops (barely) the system from collapsing
&gt; altogether. It is not a free market system, it is just a horrible screwed
&gt; up mess with more problems piling every year.

"/> Agree to some extent, but making it less of a free market system
is not the best answer IMO. Let the consumer take care of the
checkups, routine tests, prescriptions up to a point, doctor visits
for a runny nose, etc... The consumer will beat down the price
of these when they are not just paying a small co-pay. A high
deductible plan can keep people from being ruined
financially by a big, unexpected medical expense. This is the
way insurance is supposed to work anyway.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;than a large group plan? I've never understood why organizations like

&gt; In the US system _anybody_ can lose their group plan at any time by
&gt; forces beyond their control.

"/> It's not as bleak as you make it out to be. I know plenty of
people with serious medical problems in their family who
still have insurance. COBRA protects against loss of insurance
because of job loss to some extent.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Everyone needs to have access to a plan that
&gt; doesn't drop them at the first available opportunity.

"/> True. They should demand it. Unfortunately, the consumer
has been removed from both the transaction of buying the
insurance and the transaction of paying for the service.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Large group plans are
&gt; the only real insurance, but access is arbitrary and limited, lost,
&gt; unavailable, or unaffordable. It guarantees that tens of millions of
&gt; people are locked out, wastes a sh*tload of money, severely limits labor
&gt; mobility, inflates US labor costs, clogs up emergency rooms, wastes billions
&gt; of man hours, ruins finances, etc.

"/> Medicare/Medicaid are major fuck ups, too. The reality is that
we will not be able to afford to provide all the care that
everyone wants/needs as the population ages. Any government
or other plan should take that into account (Medicare does
not).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The nations with socialized medicine have only about the same percentage

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without leaving about 16% of the population lacking healthcare coverage.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe 16% of their populations are in a perpetual holding
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pattern, while awaiting their turn to be scheduled for an operation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The way I hear it from a good friend of mine in Canada,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people wait 6 months or whatever if they are picky about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which doctor does the operation, much less if they let it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be done by any doctor who is rated as qualified to do it.

&gt;&gt;Canada has as bad a record for waiting times as England.

&gt; Makes England sound not so bad if that is true.

"/> On a good day 6 months is possible in England. However, in a country
with 60 million population and 1 million plus waiting for admission to
a hospital for &quot;elective&quot; procedures, it's not the best example of
efficiency.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In the USA, I had to wait a month to get a potentially cancerous mole

and in some counties it can be longer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My friend in Canada tells me things are not
&gt; that much worse there unless you are picky about which doctor does the
&gt; proceedure.

"/> The frasier institute data doesn't agree. in 2001-02 the average
referral wait time was 16 weeks.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think most doctors willing and supposedly qualified to do a
&gt; biopsy will do the job adequately.

"/> Adequate care is what you get.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My dentist in the USA has a long enough wait for appointments to
&gt; recommend scheduling my next 6-month cleaning on my way out from one.

"/> That is a convenience to him, I imagine. Mine does the same. Now,
let me ask you this. If you have a tooth ache, will he see you in the
morning?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; And in australia, if you care about that choice of doctor
&gt;&gt;&gt; question, you're welcome to have quite affordable
&gt;&gt;&gt; medical insurance that eliminates any wait with elective
&gt;&gt;&gt; surgery. There isnt any wait with non elective surgery.

&gt;&gt;So much for the tax-based Medicare system if you need private
&gt;&gt;supplemental insurance to avoid potentially deadly waits for
&gt;&gt;&quot;elective&quot; surgery.

&gt;&gt;Hey, how long is the wait for that needle biopsy? What about that
&gt;&gt;MRI?

&gt; What are your claimed figures for waits?

"/> I asked the question. But just for grins, in NSW one caq get one (a
needle biopsy of the breast) in as little as 6 days if it is urgent
and you may wait up to 90 days depending on hospital and physician.

As far as an MRI is concerned, as part of the scan scam investigation,
waiting times of 3 months or more were reported as common - unless you
went &quot;private&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Most USA citizens need to buy what is a lot more than supplemental
&gt; insurance or else they pay out of pocket to get a needle biopsy at all.

"/> 190 million Americans are covered by private insurance provided
through their employers at a fairly low monthly cost - as little as
$100 for a family of 4. Cost sharing is nominal in most cases - 10%
or so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And 16% have no coverage at all, even though government spends as high a
&gt; fraction of its nations GDP on healthcare as does government in the
&gt; nations that have national healthcare.

"/> Not having health insurance is not the same as not having health care
access. Second, some uninsured elect to be uninsured even though
insurance is available. Some uninsured are uninsured because they
don't avail themselves of available programs (SCHIPs for example).
Some uninsured are uninsured because they are illegal aliens. Some
uninsured are uninsured because they are between jobs and don't make a
commitment to pay for COBRA. Some uninsured are uninsured because
states have elected to raise the bar of eligibility for Medicaid.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Some in a hurry for treatment by their favorite doctor pay out of pocket,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's generally the best approach here if you
&gt;&gt;&gt; arent in the high risk for elective surgery groups, quite
&gt;&gt;&gt; a bit cheaper than insurance, particularly if you never
&gt;&gt;&gt; actually need any elective surgery over 50 years etc.

&gt;&gt;OK - so if you have money in Australia you get faster better care - if
&gt;&gt;you don't, you get crappy care?

&gt; In the USA, if you don't have money to pay medical bills but make too
&gt; much to qualify for Medicaid you don't get even crappy care once the
&gt; emergency room &quot;stabilizes&quot; you - you get none at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but Canadians pay much less out of pocket than USA residents

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope, the US spends more than 50% more on a GDP % basis.

&gt;&gt;Stupid - WRONG. Public expenditure on health care is 6.6% of GDP in

&gt;&gt; Most USA citizens need to buy what is a lot more than supplemental

&gt;190 million Americans are covered by private insurance provided

&gt;$100 for a family of 4. Cost sharing is nominal in most cases - 10%
&gt;or so.

month. Employer and employee are combined paying quite a few thousand per
year without getting the government off the hook for as high a percentage
of GDP as government in Canada pays. Private employers have to get the
money somewhere - from you and me one way or another. If employers did
not pay so much for healthcare, then they would put more money in the
hands of employees and/or shareholders or give better prices to customers
or some combination of this.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Not having health insurance is not the same as not having health care
&gt;access. Second, some uninsured elect to be uninsured even though
&gt;insurance is available. Some uninsured are uninsured because they
&gt;don't avail themselves of available programs (SCHIPs for example).
&gt;Some uninsured are uninsured because they are illegal aliens. Some
&gt;uninsured are uninsured because they are between jobs and don't make a
&gt;commitment to pay for COBRA. Some uninsured are uninsured because
&gt;states have elected to raise the bar of eligibility for Medicaid.

"/>  National healthcare will solve the Medicaid ineligibility problem, and
some people do not elect to have insurance because it costs them $300-$400
a month. Many employers either do not offer it at all or make the

pay everything.

I remember a magazine article a few years ago about a new multimegabuck
device called a &quot;Gamma Knife&quot;. Although the ones in existence were 40%
utilized and some hospitals found it cheaper to fly patients to other
hospitals that had them (including hotel costs) than to install and
maintain one of their own, hospitals without one got one to keep &quot;star&quot;
neurosurgeons from leaving for another hospital that had or was willing to
get one.

I doubt national healthcare will reduce the MRI count in Philadelphia to
one per 550,000.

Three Senate bills which Kerry was the prime sponsor of became &quot;Public

another passed the Senate &quot;without objections. These five total are:

S. 1563 of the 102nd Congress
S. 1206 and S. 1636 of the 103rd Congress
S. 469 of the 105th Congress
S. 791 of the 106th Congress

About 21 resolutions that Kerry was the sponsor of passed in the Senate

And I am not conceding Jonathan Smith's claim that 190 million of the
USA's population are covered by private health insurance anyway:

OK, I may change that on the basis that I spent a couple minutes in the
www.census.gov  website...
( http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/usinterimproj/natprojtab01a.pdf ) and
saw a projection of about 282.125 million population for 2000, 308.936
million for 2010, which I interpolate to 292.849 million for 2004.

This sounds like 190 million being employees and covered family members
covered by private health insurance, 43 million covered by nothing (14.7%
as opposed to the 16% that I recently previously claimed), along with
presumably 59.849 million on Medicare or Medicaid if the 190 million
insured figure is correct, and that one includes Medicare recipients who
are compelled to buy supplemental insurance. And surely Americans
complain about the quality of care for those on Medicaid.
And some of these 190 million with private insurance are paying all of
it from paycheck deduction or otherwise out of pocket, and lowest group
rate I can find from a small employer my way is over $300 per month.
(Some will chip in employer contributions if I land a fulltime job there.)
I have heard of local small employers with nothing under $400/month,
(even worked for one) and higher for plans covering family members other
than the employee.

If healthcare costs and healthcare quality were all I cared about, then
I would get a job in Canada. Even if my neglecting the usual sceduled
dentist visits resulted in a cavity becoming an emergency where I would
take my chances in an ER rather than hope my private dentist in the USA
will treat it the next morning...

USA citizens would only need to buy supplemental insurance rather than

million of the USA's citizens having costly (to them and/or employers)
private health insurance along with 43 million (14.7 % of the population,

USA taxes are lower than those of other industrialized nations mostly

government borrow at this time annually 4-plus % of annual GDP and that is
a bill that future USA taxpayers have to pay plus interest... The only
fiscal years in the past at least 30 where the USA federal government did
not have an annual deficit (as in did not increase the national debt) were
the last few of the ones where the President was the only Democrat elected

"/>  Do Chinese corporations give American employees, American suppliers,
American shareholders and American taxing authorities that can gain from

I think American corporations need a reduction of a nationally imposed
mandate to either pay taxes worse than those of foreign competiing
corporations, or to invest in tax loopholes (necessitated by high-on-a
-global-scale corporate taxes) as opposed to making money by selling goods
and services.

Keep in mind that with the USA's current tax structure, corporations pay
only 6% of the nation's tax bill (according to some wanting corporations
to pay more) despite a nominal Federal tax rate on corporations somewhere
around 30% of net income reported to shareholders.
I believe that there are zillions of tax loopholes to close and
multi-billions of $ that corporations should be investing in ways to
profitably sell goods and services as opposed to tax shelters and
lobbyists working to lower the taxes of their clients (whether or not this
would lower taxes of corporations that are not their clients).

Keep in mind that corporate taxes are paid by corporations' shareholders
(such as your and my IRA and 401K and other investments popular with the
&quot;middle class&quot;), their suppliers (as opposed to suppliers of competitors
foreign enough to avoid USA corporate taxes), and their customers and
their employees.

If you want to tax &quot;corporate fat cats&quot;, the I say do this via
individual taxes designed to hit such &quot;fat cats&quot; as opposed to middle
class and working class employees, contractors and employees thereof, and
customers.
===========================

This is enough of an issue separate from the issue of national
healthcare - I dare say that in any responses to this that I decide to
post followups to, I would change the subject line which should start a
new thread to most with most newsreaders. If I change the subject line,
I will examine the line for newsgroups posted to and eliminate the least

&gt; OK, I may change that on the basis that I spent a couple minutes in the
&gt; www.census.gov  website...
&gt; ( http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/usinterimproj/natprojtab01a.pdf ) and
&gt; saw a projection of about 282.125 million population for 2000, 308.936
&gt; million for 2010, which I interpolate to 292.849 million for 2004.

&gt; This sounds like 190 million being employees and covered family members
&gt; covered by private health insurance, 43 million covered by nothing (14.7%
&gt; as opposed to the 16% that I recently previously claimed), along with
&gt; presumably 59.849 million on Medicare or Medicaid if the 190 million
&gt; insured figure is correct, and that one includes Medicare recipients who
&gt; are compelled to buy supplemental insurance. And surely Americans
&gt; complain about the quality of care for those on Medicaid.
&gt; And some of these 190 million with private insurance are paying all of
&gt; it from paycheck deduction or otherwise out of pocket, and lowest group
&gt; rate I can find from a small employer my way is over $300 per month.
&gt; (Some will chip in employer contributions if I land a fulltime job there.)
&gt; I have heard of local small employers with nothing under $400/month,
&gt; (even worked for one) and higher for plans covering family members other
&gt; than the employee.

"/> Just as a token measure of perspective - a $400 per month car lease
payment is hardly unusual, care insurance for a family, especially if
they have a teen or two, can run $300 per month, too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If healthcare costs and healthcare quality were all I cared about, then

"/> Why? Do you think health care quality in Canada is superior to the
US?

http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/popdwell/T...

That makes 960 per 100K

Here's the equivalent US data.

Number of discharges: 33.7 million
Discharges per 100,000 population: 1,174.6
Average length of stay in days: 4.9
Number of procedures performed: 42.5 million

http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/hospital.htm

Gee - seems you were only half right.

The length of stay in Japan is two or three times that of Canada -
does that mean that the Japanese system is two or three times better?

What about the number of admissions?

Well, we alrweady know that in the US there are more.

What about the number of outpatient services?
Primary care visits are higher in Canada - specialist visits lower.

What about the number of laboratory tests? What about the number of
diagnostics?

In 1994, The University of Michigan Medical school (funded by The
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)) published a study (August 17,
1994 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA))
of Canada vs US consumption. Interestingly, they found that though
Canadians seem to use more primary care, once a disease is identified,
US consumers get much more intensive (and costly) interventions.

The US has a slightly older population and data support that older
people consume more health care services. Utilization rates explain a
lot - you just need to get a bit closer to the data.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; or a combination of the two?

&gt; Or the massive medical insurance bureaucracy in the US.

"/> I already pointed out to you that there isn't one. But believe the
propaganda from the UC/SPers if you like.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Is Canada spending less because they control consumption?

&gt; Nope, in fact its the US that tends to ration health care
&gt; more, done by the medical insurance bureaucracy
&gt; rather than by the health care system itself.

"/> No, they do not. In the US, private insurers have absoulutely no
ability to ration care - they can only refuse reimbursement. And the
argument that this is in effect rationing of care is one that requires
data. Go for it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Private employers have to get the money somewhere
&gt;&gt;&gt; - from you and me one way or another. If employers did
&gt;&gt;&gt; not pay so much for healthcare, then they would put more
&gt;&gt;&gt; money in the hands of employees and/or shareholders or
&gt;&gt;&gt; give better prices to customers or some combination of this.

&gt; And not have the same pressure to export jobs too.

"/> This is the second time you used this strawman. And in case you are
still a bit in the dark, this &quot;exporting&quot; of jobs by multinational
companies doing business around the globe is hardly exporting, now is
it. And do you know where US companies are making DFI? In Europe and
Canada, some in Mexico, and some in India. Why? Because these are
MARKETS for them, too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; So? Is spending 14% of GDP a bad thing?

&gt; Certainly is if you get the same healthcare outcome as spending 7% does.

"/> Well, you have yet to prove that the outcomes are the same. Life
expectancy and infant mortality are insufficient as markers of health
care quality - even the WHO agrees with me on this.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;190 million Americans are covered by private insurance provided

&gt;&gt;&gt; Employer and employee are combined paying quite a few thousand per
&gt;&gt;&gt; year without getting the government off the hook for as high a percentage
&gt;&gt;&gt; of GDP as government in Canada pays.

&gt;&gt;Do you have a reason for this? Is it prices, consumption, or a
&gt;&gt;combination of the two? Is Canada spending less because they control
&gt;&gt;consumption?

&gt;I already poopooed the drug thing - so, now you want to cut the

&gt;a hospital - physicians account for almost a third of all health care
&gt;costs...so, you want to cut salaries? Do you work in health care?

"/>  I have a few points to make:

1. The USA has quite a few unnecessary procedures done at ratepayer
expense. As the first example that comes to my mind, I can't believe all
those cesarian sections done in the USA are necessary, but private
insurance is willing to pay for them at my expense. If we did not pay
surgeons to do unnecessary procedures, then one thing we could possibly
achieve is fewer surgeons and the achieved cost savings going to pay the
laid-off surgeons to make as much as they did before giving us something
more useful than unnecessary surgery. Although with the savings likely to
be spent mostly on services rendered by people that make less than
surgeons do, I think a lower unemployment rate is more likely instead.

2. Patients demand physicians with more experience, so to some extent
only the physicians who already have the desired amount of experience will
get it. This will create a disparity among physician salaries (or
incomes) with patients demanding the ones with higher salaries. Others
are making choices that drive up my healthcare costs because their
healthcare costs do not go up any more if they demand &quot;star&quot; doctors than
if they do not. And the USA's private health insurance system is somehow
willing to pay for demand of &quot;star&quot; doctors at my expense.

3. In the USA physicians typically have to work 100 hour weeks with
poverty income for about four years after graduating from medical school.
I don't believe that first four years gives patients a bargain so much as
creates an artificial barrier that reduces the supply of physicians and
keeps their prices for the most part artificially high. Along with having
people suffering from errors by doctors working under sleep deprivation.
Does this happen in countries where government pays doctors' salaries?

4. Aren't doctor salaries high enough in Canada to achieve none of the
problems I hear being claimed by national healthcare opponents being a
doctor shortage?

5. Maybe it's a lesser reason, but the USA government for a while did pay
medical schools to keep admission slots empty. Many people missed this
and missed Clinton going along with this because they were so absorbed
with Clinton's private life. I doubt a government that pays doctor
salaries more directly than ours does would take an interfering action to
boost them.
Maybe somebody thought the USA spent too much on doctors because the USA
has too many of them, but the law of supply and demand sure comes to my
mind...

6. How about USA-specific costs other than salaries of healthcare
workers? That bit of multimegabuck gamma knives being only 40% utilized
and hospitals acquiring more was more than an anecdote; that was a
nationwide statistic. And the big hospital near my workplace is always
under construction. They have a building less than 10 years old with most
of its first floor being rebuilt, for example. Under the USA's current
system, hospitals sure have some motive to increase some costs to
obviously unnecessary levels. If some of that was spent on adequate
staffing by nurses and some of that was avoided rather than being sucked
from ratepayers... this sounds like an argument in favor of hospitals
being answerable to some bean counters!

And who is paying for all those ads by pharmaceutical companies? I even
see ads that do not even say what the advertized product is supposed to
treat! My health insurance dollars at work?

Physician salaries outpaced average salaries of non-physicians since

someone pointed me to a cite for physician salaraies stagnating for a few
years around then, but my health insurance premiums surely did not

&gt; No, the price differences are part of why the USA private sector pays a
&gt; higher percentage of GDP than Canadian government does in addition to USA
&gt; government paying as high a percentage of GDP as Canadian government does.

"/> In terms of pharmaceutical sales, the US consumes more than Canada in
terms of number of units. State Medicaid systems generally pay less
for drugs (after rebates) than what is listed on the Canada (Ontario)
drug formualary. Medicaid, by law, pays no more (or less) than the
best purchaser (in this case the private insurance sector).
Therefore, the transaction prices, at the insurance level, are
comparable to those in Canada.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hands of employees and/or shareholders or give better prices to customers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or some combination of this.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So? Is spending 14% of GDP a bad thing? Is spending 7% of GDP a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;good thing?

&gt;&gt;&gt; 14% is turning into a major problem. Prices are so high that the USA's

&gt; And I'm certainly not going to believe nurse salaries increased by a

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; My government is paying as high a percentage of GDP on

&gt;&gt;So your solution is to have them control ALL of health care? Gee -

&gt;&gt;not let them screw up the rest?

&gt; My government spends plenty on health care costs that they are
&gt; presently not controlling - employer contributions for healthcare premiums
&gt; of public sector employees!

"/> If the public sector (Mediare as the example) is so damned good at
controlling costs and expenditures, why is it that Federal employees
are insured in the private sector?

Don, you aren't doind so well in this thread. Do you want to give it

If not, I might suggest, in the most gentle and benign way - GET A

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because at least in part countries with national healthcare are able to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; control prices. For example, the USA pharmaceutical companies charge so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much higher prices in the USA

&gt;&gt;&gt;This is not exactly true - the difference in transaction prices at
&gt;&gt;&gt;retail between a cash paying customer in the US and one purchasing
&gt;&gt;&gt;drugs under the Canada provincial formulary system can be substantial.
&gt;&gt;&gt; HOWEVER, the transaction cost to Kaiser for the same prescription is
&gt;&gt;&gt;not any different in the US as the transaction price in Canada.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Considering that 85% of all pharmaceutical sales in the US are covered
&gt;&gt;&gt;under a third party payment program, the price differences, especially
&gt;&gt;&gt;once you adjust for PPP, disappear.

&gt;&gt; No, the price differences are part of why the USA private sector pays a
&gt;&gt; higher percentage of GDP than Canadian government does in addition to USA
&gt;&gt; government paying as high a percentage of GDP as Canadian government does.

&gt;In terms of pharmaceutical sales, the US consumes more than Canada in
&gt;terms of number of units. State Medicaid systems generally pay less
&gt;for drugs (after rebates) than what is listed on the Canada (Ontario)
&gt;drug formualary. Medicaid, by law, pays no more (or less) than the
&gt;best purchaser (in this case the private insurance sector).
&gt;Therefore, the transaction prices, at the insurance level, are
&gt;comparable to those in Canada.

"/>  Then why should I have a prescription plan that covers more of some
prescriptions than I can pay out of pocket at a warehouse club, and why do
USA pharmaceutical companies feel the need to pay lobbyists to get laws
passed against me from getting a better price in Canada for the same
USA-made US-FDA-approved drugs than I can get in the USA?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Private employers have to get the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; money somewhere - from you and me one way or another. If employers did
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not pay so much for healthcare, then they would put more money in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hands of employees and/or shareholders or give better prices to customers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or some combination of this.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So? Is spending 14% of GDP a bad thing? Is spending 7% of GDP a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;good thing?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 14% is turning into a major problem. Prices are so high that the USA's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; government is spending as high a percentage of GDP as Canada government
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does

&gt;&gt;&gt;Does this speak to the efficiency or the inefficiency of the US
&gt;&gt;&gt;government in managing health care?

&gt;&gt; Part is inefficiency or excessive prices on the part of private
&gt;&gt; providers.

&gt;Let's see if I have this right. Providers, providing services to
&gt;government insured (Medicare and Medficaid are the biggest I think)
&gt;are able to extract premium prices (excessive?) and expanding this
&gt;government largess (or inability to negotiate better prices) to the
&gt;entire system of health care delivery will reduce health care costs?

"/>  No, I think the USA government errs oppositely, by paying what USA
healthcare providers can charge with neither competitive bidding nor a
largely single payer system.
Some major chunk of the USA's 6.6% of GDP that its government spends on
healthcare is for employer contributions to private health insurance
premious of public sector employees!
Some lesser chunk is from the US Federal government paying emergency
rooms to handle cold, flus, and ear infections among Medicaid recipients
that (outside of some pilot programs) the US Federal government does not
pay nor require primary care physicians to handle but does require and pay
hospital emergency rooms to handle.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If in fact the government needs
&gt;&gt;&gt;7% of GDP to provide health care to half the population, what makes
&gt;&gt;&gt;you think that it can add the other half for free?

&gt;&gt; Not for free, but a single payer system should get some prices down.

&gt;How? You just told me that in the 50% of the market that the
&gt;government already controls they can't.

"/>  No, what I say is that in much of this the US government pays despite
having failed to control due to lack of a national healthcare system - as
a big example, employer contributions to private health insurance premiums
for public service employees.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; while leaving 15% of the population uncovered

&gt;&gt;&gt;The lack of access to insurance is NOT a medical care delivery issue.
&gt;&gt;&gt;It is a financing issue. One of the world's most efficient and
&gt;&gt;&gt;highest rated systems of health care delivery is successful because
&gt;&gt;&gt;there is a requirement that employers provide health insurance to
&gt;&gt;&gt;employees.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and private coverage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; costing, as you say, $5K per employee per year.

&gt;&gt;&gt;People spend MORE on cars than they do on health care. Is 5k too
&gt;&gt;&gt;much?

&gt;&gt; Annually? Health insurance in each of the last few years cost me more
&gt;&gt; than I ever spent in a year to acquire, insure and maintain a car. Yes, I
&gt;&gt; have one and have had one ever since 1997.

&gt;The 40K Beemer with a four year residual value of 20K is 5K per year.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Employers who foot much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of this are at a competitive disadvantage to employers in countries where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the employer contribution per employee is less.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The cost of labor varies around the world. So?

&gt;&gt; Cost of employing someone in Canada or Japan is less than in the USA

&gt;OK - so then can you use this to explain the higher cost for health
&gt;care delivery? If nurses earn 40K in the US and 20K CAN in Canada....

&gt;&gt; despite workers in those countries having as high a standard of living as
&gt;&gt; they do in the USA.

&gt;But they don't.

&gt;Under WDI PPP methodology, the US &quot;standard of living&quot; is set at $34K,
&gt;Canada at 26K, Australia at 24K. Most of the major EU markets are in
&gt;the 23-26K range except for the three outliers, Lichtenstein,
&gt;Luxembourg, and Switzerland - all above 30K. The reason is primarily
&gt;due to the skewness based on the financial sector dominance in the
&gt;economy.

"/>  The USA has a federal government in the past couple years and also in
the earlyish-mid 1980's through early 1990's taxing quite a few % of GDP
less than they spend, and finding willing borrowers from, as an example,
Japan which has a savings rate about triple the &quot;healthy&quot; 10% that the USA
has only a fraction of - in part by USA workers having to pay so much for
healthcare.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;So, these workers do NOT have as high of a standard of living as US
&gt;workers.

"/>  Some of this is subsidized by US Federal government deficit spending
financed in large part by foreign borrowing. I argue that most of any
other &quot;higher standard of living&quot; that USA workers have is spent on
healthcare expenses that people in other countries don't have to pay.

I do not see statistics there for those covered but for less than 100%

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in Canada!

&gt;&gt;&gt;Personally, protecting the integrity of the drug distribution system
&gt;&gt;&gt;is an important role for the FDA.

&gt;&gt; When I have to pay more to get the *same USA-made drug* because they
&gt;&gt; won't let me get it for less from Canada, that's not integrity.

&gt;&quot;But when you open up the borders to importation, it is my contention
&gt;that you will sacrifice safety. Pharmaceutical products become more
&gt;difficult to monitor and control. The U.S. could turn into a &quot;dumping
&gt;ground&quot; for substandard drug products because this is where the money
&gt;is.&quot;

&gt;I thought this was an interesting statement. It comes from an expert.
&gt; I'll let you think about it and respond.

"/>  Why the need for USA pharmaceutical compamies to lobby against USA
citizens buying from Canada USA-made FDA-approved drugs at a price that
costs less for two national border cropssings than zero?

Who does this expert work for and who is this expert paid by?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Is that where some of my health insurace dollars go - lobbyists for
&gt;&gt; price protectionism?

&gt;Did you know that generic drugs are less expensive in the US than in
&gt;Canada?

"/>  Generic price at the drugstore chains with most stores exceeds half the
brand names. I see on the news enough how warehouse clubs such as Costco
charge 1/3 what the chains with the most stores do. Compare to this, why
is an FDA-approved USA-made drug purchased from Canada after two border
crossings so cheap that the USA manufacturers lobby to make it illegal to
buy even their own FDA-approved drugs if they cross national borders?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I already poopooed the drug thing - so, now you want to cut the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;salaries of health care workers? Labor is the single biggest cost in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a hospital - physicians account for almost a third of all health care
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;costs...so, you want to cut salaries? Do you work in health care?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In 1986 my plan cost $960 per year employer and employee combined.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Since then I went to a cheaper plan that costs $5K per year.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So? I ask for data, and you bring anecdote.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the data. National health care EXPENDITURES year on year
&gt;&gt;&gt;increase from the mid 80's to 2003 were running about 7%. They track
&gt;&gt;&gt;fairly well year on year with the CPI except that the rate is about
&gt;&gt;&gt;double. The reason for the higher rate of increase is NOT inflation,
&gt;&gt;&gt;but utilization. More people using more services more often.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Annual expenditures for health care per capita in 1986 was $1,872. In
&gt;&gt;&gt;2003 it was $5,757. Your anecdote is not supported by national
&gt;&gt;&gt;expenditure data. What should the astute reader believe? Your memory
&gt;&gt;&gt;or my data?

&gt;&gt; How should my memory of a bill that I had to pay be questioned by
&gt;&gt;&quot;cloudy memory&quot;?
&gt; 1986 - how much was your electric bill? What was your car
&gt; payment? What did you pay in rent? How good is your memory?
&gt; Honestly, I can't remeber what I paid for those things.

"/> Your problem.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; As for utilization having some major increase - did that
&gt;&gt; happen in nations with national healthcare?

&gt; You bet it did - and still does. The rate of increase in the US was
&gt; around 8% annualized (from 1985 to 2002). Most OECDs over the same
&gt; time were in the 6 or 7% range, except the UK where its 9% and Norway
&gt; where it approaches 10%.

&gt; These are readily retrievable OECD excel tables. You can run the
&gt; numbers any which way you want.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Physician salaries outpaced average salaries of non-physicians since
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1986, but did not grow by any factor of five.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Neither did health premiums, as I pointed out. Can you understand the
&gt;&gt;&gt;difference between costs and expenditures?

&gt;&gt; You pointed out expenditures growing more slowly, from about twice my
&gt;&gt; premium in 1986 to about 1.2 times my premium in 2003. You did not point
&gt;&gt; out any national average of premiums paid growing more slowly than mine.

&gt; That's the differnce between a single datum and the wonders of
&gt; statistics - and the concept of central tendency.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, in the late 1990's someone pointed me to a cite

&gt;&gt;&gt;Wonderful, another anecdote.

&gt;&gt; National statistic - force me to do so, I wil dig up a cite at a time of
&gt;&gt; the week when I have more time to do so.

&gt; It's not that tough. Try OECD data.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for physician salaraies stagnating for a few years around then, but my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;health insurance premiums surely did not stagnate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;According to the Kaiser Family FoundationEmployer Health Benefits
&gt;&gt;&gt;2003, the annual increas in health insurance premiums between 1995
&gt;&gt;&gt;aqnd 1998 was below the annual rate of inflation.

&gt;&gt; I surely think that it's more than just ananecdote that my health
&gt;&gt; insurance premium about kept up with inflation from 1995 to 1998 despite
&gt;&gt; me stepping down to a lower plan.

&gt; Your single personal observation is not the equivalent of national
&gt; data. Sorry if you aren't happy about this but thats just the way it
&gt; is.

&gt; Look, my salary from 1985 to today increased at three times the rate
&gt; of the average worker - so? Good for me but that doesn't change the
&gt; fact that the average worker didn't see a 15% increase annualized.

&gt;&gt; And how about the time from 1986 to now?

&gt; You tell me? The best data are from 2002. I gave you those.
&gt; Historic data are provided in 1 or 5 year increments, depending.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Not my anecdote, real live verifiable data.
&gt;&gt;&gt;See Exhibit 1.2, p 21 in the report. You can get it at the local
&gt;&gt;&gt;library if you want.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I'm certainly not going to believe nurse salaries increased by a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; factor of five since 1986!

&gt;&gt;&gt;Considering your factor of 5 is wrong and you don't factor in
&gt;&gt;&gt;utilization rates...what can I say?

&gt;&gt; $960 employer/employee combined in 1986, and I step down to a lower plan
&gt;&gt; to have this cost $5K in 2004!

&gt; OK - fine and dandy. But that doesn't change the fact that the
&gt; annulaized increase in health care expenduitures in the US from 1985
&gt; to 2002 was about 8% - equivalent to the rest of the industrialized
&gt; world - normal variances excepted.

&gt;&gt; You say $5K/year is about average now - did I underpay by a factor of
&gt;&gt; almost 2 in 1986?

&gt; Obviously your experience was not consistent with the mean of the
&gt; population. Like with any statistic, your gas mileage may ary.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My government is paying as high a percentage of GDP on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; healthcare as Canada's is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So your solution is to have them control ALL of health care? Gee -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;now that makes sense. They've already screwed up the first half, why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not let them screw up the rest?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My government spends plenty on health care costs that they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; presently not controlling - employer contributions for healthcare premiums
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of public sector employees!

&gt;&gt;&gt;If the public sector (Mediare as the example) is so damned good at
&gt;&gt;&gt;controlling costs and expenditures, why is it that Federal employees
&gt;&gt;&gt;are insured in the private sector?

&gt;&gt; Because the USA's pro-private-sector government has been willing to do
&gt;&gt; so, but cost increases from this about or over double inflation over the
&gt;&gt; past 20 years are changing the minds of quite a few USA voters!

&gt; But as I showed you, the increases are not a function of the financing
&gt; system used to fund expenditures - all health systems are experiencing
&gt; the same pressures and for the same reasons. More people are getting
&gt; more services that are more expensive because they are better and they
&gt; are getting this for a longer period of time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Don, you aren't doind so well in this thread. Do you want to give it
&gt;&gt;&gt;up?

&gt;&gt;&gt;If not, I might suggest, in the most gentle and benign way - GET A
&gt;&gt;&gt;CLUE!

&gt;&gt;&gt;thanks for playing.

&gt;&gt; Did I underpay by a factor of 2 in 1986 but only by a factor of 1.15
&gt;&gt; now?

&gt; I don't know - I still contend you have a case of selective memory.
&gt; Whatever you have observed for your single case is NOT supported by
&gt; national data.

&gt;&gt; Even with me stepping down to a cheaper plan in a time period when
&gt;&gt; many had to do so, with that still allowing my premiums to rise from
&gt;&gt; $960/year to $5K/year when according to you per capita expenditures on
&gt;&gt; healthcare went from about $1.8K to about $5.7K per year? Why should my
&gt;&gt; out-of-pocket expenditures besides premiums also rise when according to
&gt;&gt; you the shortfall from my premium paymwents should have a slight drop?

&gt; Because you want to post that they did.

&gt; Don - I concede - you remember what you remember but regardless, your
&gt; single observation is not general;izable and is an outlier in the
&gt; distribution.

&gt; My data beat your anecdote every time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because at least in part countries with national healthcare are able to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; control prices. For example, the USA pharmaceutical companies charge so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much higher prices in the USA

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is not exactly true - the difference in transaction prices at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;retail between a cash paying customer in the US and one purchasing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;drugs under the Canada provincial formulary system can be substantial.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HOWEVER, the transaction cost to Kaiser for the same prescription is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not any different in the US as the transaction price in Canada.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Considering that 85% of all pharmaceutical sales in the US are covered
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;under a third party payment program, the price differences, especially
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;once you adjust for PPP, disappear.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, the price differences are part of why the USA private sector pays a
&gt;&gt;&gt; higher percentage of GDP than Canadian government does in addition to USA
&gt;&gt;&gt; government paying as high a percentage of GDP as Canadian government does.

&gt;&gt;In terms of pharmaceutical sales, the US consumes more than Canada in
&gt;&gt;terms of number of units. State Medicaid systems generally pay less
&gt;&gt;for drugs (after rebates) than what is listed on the Canada (Ontario)
&gt;&gt;drug formualary. Medicaid, by law, pays no more (or less) than the
&gt;&gt;best purchaser (in this case the private insurance sector).
&gt;&gt;Therefore, the transaction prices, at the insurance level, are
&gt;&gt;comparable to those in Canada.

&gt; Then why should I have a prescription plan that covers more of some
&gt; prescriptions than I can pay out of pocket at a warehouse club,

trade dress, dosages, and apporved labeling can and does vary between
the US and other countries. You will also find that the country of
manufacture varies. However, when a drug is imported to the US from
ex-US, it is subject to FDA inspection, has a required document trail,
and meets the USP and FDA specifications. Intermediaries are
generally precluded from importing drugs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; money somewhere - from you and me one way or another. If employers did
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not pay so much for healthcare, then they would put more money in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hands of employees and/or shareholders or give better prices to customers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or some combination of this.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So? Is spending 14% of GDP a bad thing? Is spending 7% of GDP a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;good thing?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 14% is turning into a major problem. Prices are so high that the USA's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; government is spending as high a percentage of GDP as Canada government
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Does this speak to the efficiency or the inefficiency of the US
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;government in managing health care?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Part is inefficiency or excessive prices on the part of private
&gt;&gt;&gt; providers.

&gt;&gt;Let's see if I have this right. Providers, providing services to
&gt;&gt;government insured (Medicare and Medficaid are the biggest I think)
&gt;&gt;are able to extract premium prices (excessive?) and expanding this
&gt;&gt;government largess (or inability to negotiate better prices) to the
&gt;&gt;entire system of health care delivery will reduce health care costs?

&gt; No, I think the USA government errs oppositely, by paying what USA
&gt; healthcare providers can charge with neither competitive bidding nor a
&gt; largely single payer system.

"/> Medicaid represetns 11% of the total health care budget in the US.
This is a budget that far exceeds that of Canada. Medicare has 40
million plus participants. It is twice the size of Australia and 5
times the size of Sweden.

Kaiser has millions of covered lives though less than the UK's NHS.
Kaiser provides better care for less than the NHS.

How is it that a private sector managed care provider can produce
better quality at a lower cost than a SP/UC system AND the US
government, with twice the resources, cannot?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Some major chunk of the USA's 6.6% of GDP that its government spends on
&gt; healthcare is for employer contributions to private health insurance
&gt; premious of public sector employees!

"/> No, it is not. Health premiums paid by on behalf of Federal employees
are budgeted from the line items for those agencies. They are not
included in the 6.6% of GDP. The 6.6% of GDP are DIRECT payments for
medical services for two major programs - Medicaid and Medicare - plus
various ancillary programs including the VA, DoD, SCHIPS (though that
is typically a Medicaid line item), Workers' comp, county programs and
some (but not all) city or town based welfare programs.

Here's the website from CMS that explains it.

"/> To be eligible for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, hospitals are

varies depending on institution but can be as little as 5% and as much

&gt;&gt;&gt; Not for free, but a single payer system should get some prices down.

&gt;&gt;How? You just told me that in the 50% of the market that the
&gt;&gt;government already controls they can't.

&gt; No, what I say is that in much of this the US government pays despite

"/> Having failed to control is not due to a lack of a national healthcare
system - they have control over a national healthcare system - it is

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; while leaving 15% of the population uncovered

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The lack of access to insurance is NOT a medical care delivery issue.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is a financing issue. One of the world's most efficient and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;highest rated systems of health care delivery is successful because
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;there is a requirement that employers provide health insurance to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;employees.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and private coverage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; costing, as you say, $5K per employee per year.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;People spend MORE on cars than they do on health care. Is 5k too
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;much?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Annually? Health insurance in each of the last few years cost me more
&gt;&gt;&gt; than I ever spent in a year to acquire, insure and maintain a car. Yes, I
&gt;&gt;&gt; have one and have had one ever since 1997.

&gt;&gt;The 40K Beemer with a four year residual value of 20K is 5K per year.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Employers who foot much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of this are at a competitive disadvantage to employers in countries where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the employer contribution per employee is less.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The cost of labor varies around the world. So?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Cost of employing someone in Canada or Japan is less than in the USA

&gt;&gt;OK - so then can you use this to explain the higher cost for health
&gt;&gt;care delivery? If nurses earn 40K in the US and 20K CAN in Canada....

&gt;&gt;&gt; despite workers in those countries having as high a standard of living as
&gt;&gt;&gt; they do in the USA.

&gt;&gt;But they don't.

&gt;&gt;Under WDI PPP methodology, the US &quot;standard of living&quot; is set at $34K,
&gt;&gt;Canada at 26K, Australia at 24K. Most of the major EU markets are in
&gt;&gt;the 23-26K range except for the three outliers, Lichtenstein,
&gt;&gt;Luxembourg, and Switzerland - all above 30K. The reason is primarily
&gt;&gt;due to the skewness based on the financial sector dominance in the
&gt;&gt;economy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I already poopooed the drug thing - so, now you want to cut the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;salaries of health care workers? Labor is the single biggest cost in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a hospital - physicians account for almost a third of all health care
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;costs...so, you want to cut salaries? Do you work in health care?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In 1986 my plan cost $960 per year employer and employee combined.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Since then I went to a cheaper plan that costs $5K per year.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So? I ask for data, and you bring anecdote.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the data. National health care EXPENDITURES year on year
&gt;&gt;&gt;increase from the mid 80's to 2003 were running about 7%. They track
&gt;&gt;&gt;fairly well year on year with the CPI except that the rate is about
&gt;&gt;&gt;double. The reason for the higher rate of increase is NOT inflation,
&gt;&gt;&gt;but utilization. More people using more services more often.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Annual expenditures for health care per capita in 1986 was $1,872. In
&gt;&gt;&gt;2003 it was $5,757. Your anecdote is not supported by national
&gt;&gt;&gt;expenditure data. What should the astute reader believe? Your memory
&gt;&gt;&gt;or my data?

&gt;&gt; How should my memory of a bill that I had to pay be questioned by
&gt;&gt;&quot;cloudy memory&quot;?

&gt;1986 - how much was your electric bill?

"/>  I am not sure about 1986, since I was rooming with someone else then.
But in 1989 electricity cost me 11.something or 12 cents per KWH and it's
about 14 cents per KWH now. Monthly line cost charge increased similarly
little, from to the nearest dollar $5/month to still under $5/month.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What was your car payment?

"/>  I first bought a car in 1996. Never financed a car.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What did you pay in rent?

"/>  1989 - about $300/month for an efficiency. Now, $620 for a 1-bedroom
with a dining area in addition to the kitchen and living room.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;How good is your memory?

"/>  Surely I remember paying $80/month when I started buying health
insurance in 1986 at a 2-99 size group rate. I don't remember what it was
in 1989 as well as I remember that every year where I saw a report in the
news on how much the average cost of health insurance increased in the
past year, it was always close to the increase of the plan I was on and
with few exceptions the annual increase was more than twice the increase
in CPI. More than one year increased by over 10%.

OK, my memory for my 1986 health insurance cost may be 7.95% low since I
could have been paying $80 per 4 weeks ($20 per week) since at that time I
had a weekly pay schedule at an employer that I got health insurance
through. I later switched to a monthly pay schedule while staying in the
same group (and working parttime for that employer) and paying that same
group's rates.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Honestly, I can't remeber what I paid for those things.

&gt;&gt; As for utilization having some major increase - did that
&gt;&gt; happen in nations with national healthcare?

&gt;You bet it did - and still does. The rate of increase in the US was
&gt;around 8% annualized (from 1985 to 2002). Most OECDs over the same
&gt;time were in the 6 or 7% range, except the UK where its 9% and Norway
&gt;where it approaches 10%.

&gt;These are readily retrievable OECD excel tables. You can run the
&gt;numbers any which way you want.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Physician salaries outpaced average salaries of non-physicians since
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1986, but did not grow by any factor of five.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Neither did health premiums, as I pointed out. Can you understand the
&gt;&gt;&gt;difference between costs and expenditures?

&gt;&gt; You pointed out expenditures growing more slowly, from about twice my
&gt;&gt; premium in 1986 to about 1.2 times my premium in 2003. You did not point
&gt;&gt; out any national average of premiums paid growing more slowly than mine.

&gt;That's the differnce between a single datum and the wonders of
&gt;statistics - and the concept of central tendency.

"/>  The rate at which the cost of my plan increased was always pretty close
to the rate at which the national average increased every time I heard it
on the news.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, in the late 1990's someone pointed me to a cite

&gt;&gt;&gt;Wonderful, another anecdote.

&gt;&gt; National statistic - force me to do so, I wil dig up a cite at a time of
&gt;&gt; the week when I have more time to do so.

&gt;It's not that tough. Try OECD data.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for physician salaraies stagnating for a few years around then, but my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;health insurance premiums surely did not stagnate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;According to the Kaiser Family FoundationEmployer Health Benefits
&gt;&gt;&gt;2003, the annual increas in health insurance premiums between 1995
&gt;&gt;&gt;aqnd 1998 was below the annual rate of inflation.

&gt;&gt; I surely think that it's more than just ananecdote that my health
&gt;&gt; insurance premium about kept up with inflation from 1995 to 1998 despite
&gt;&gt; me stepping down to a lower plan.

&gt;Your single personal observation is not the equivalent of national
&gt;data. Sorry if you aren't happy about this but thats just the way it
&gt;is.

&gt;Look, my salary from 1985 to today increased at three times the rate
&gt;of the average worker - so? Good for me but that doesn't change the
&gt;fact that the average worker didn't see a 15% increase annualized.

&gt;&gt; And how about the time from 1986 to now?

&gt;You tell me? The best data are from 2002. I gave you those.
&gt;Historic data are provided in 1 or 5 year increments, depending.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Not my anecdote, real live verifiable data.
&gt;&gt;&gt;See Exhibit 1.2, p 21 in the report. You can get it at the local
&gt;&gt;&gt;library if you want.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I'm certainly not going to believe nurse salaries increased by a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; factor of five since 1986!

&gt;&gt;&gt;Considering your factor of 5 is wrong and you don't factor in
&gt;&gt;&gt;utilization rates...what can I say?

&gt;&gt; $960 employer/employee combined in 1986, and I step down to a lower plan
&gt;&gt; to have this cost $5K in 2004!

&gt;OK - fine and dandy. But that doesn't change the fact that the
&gt;annulaized increase in health care expenduitures in the US from 1985
&gt;to 2002 was about 8% - equivalent to the rest of the industrialized
&gt;world - normal variances excepted.

&gt;&gt; You say $5K/year is about average now - did I underpay by a factor of
&gt;&gt; almost 2 in 1986?

&gt;Obviously your experience was not consistent with the mean of the
&gt;population. Like with any statistic, your gas mileage may ary.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My government is paying as high a percentage of GDP on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; healthcare as Canada's is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So your solution is to have them control ALL of health care? Gee -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;now that makes sense. They've already screwed up the first half, why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not let them screw up the rest?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My government spends plenty on health care costs that they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; presently not controlling - employer contributions for healthcare premiums
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of public sector employees!

&gt;&gt;&gt;If the public sector (Mediare as the example) is so damned good at
&gt;&gt;&gt;controlling costs and expenditures, why is it that Federal employees
&gt;&gt;&gt;are insured in the private sector?

&gt;&gt; Because the USA's pro-private-sector government has been willing to do
&gt;&gt; so, but cost increases from this about or over double inflation over the
&gt;&gt; past 20 years are changing the minds of quite a few USA voters!

&gt;But as I showed you, the increases are not a function of the financing
&gt;system used to fund expenditures - all health systems are experiencing
&gt;the same pressures and for the same reasons. More people are getting
&gt;more services that are more expensive because they are better and they
&gt;are getting this for a longer period of time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Don, you aren't doind so well in this thread. Do you want to give it
&gt;&gt;&gt;up?

&gt;&gt;&gt;If not, I might suggest, in the most gentle and benign way - GET A
&gt;&gt;&gt;CLUE!

&gt;&gt;&gt;thanks for playing.

&gt;&gt; Did I underpay by a factor of 2 in 1986 but only by a factor of 1.15
&gt;&gt; now?

&gt;I don't know - I still contend you have a case of selective memory.
&gt;Whatever you have observed for your single case is NOT supported by
&gt;national data.

"/> I took a look at so far:

http://www.hschange.org/CONTENT/380/table1.shtml

Premiums for large firms increased by 86.8% from 1991-2001, if you
increase 1 by the percentages shown for each of those years.

Yes, I do see 3 years rather than 1 where this did not outpace the CPI,
and two of those 3 the increase was hardly under the CPI. A 4th year was
close, appeared to me hardly over the CPI. Along with 4 years where it
outpaced the CPI by a factor of more than 2, one of them inflating in the
double digits.

Small employer increases were shown for only 7 of the 11 years listed,
but all of those 7 were worse, with the combination of them totalling 3.5%
worse than for large employers. Combine this with the 86.8% increase seen
by large employers and it looks like a fair guess that premiums with small
employers increased by about 93.3% in the 11 year period from 1991-2001.

And while the above site says 2001 had an increase of 10.2% for large
employers and 11% for small employers, the Mississippi Manufacturer's
Association says that the 2001 increase nationwide was 13%. (According to
a Google blurb on the no-longer-available
http://www.medc.ms/The%20Mississippi%20Manufacturers%20AssociationII.ppt )

http://www.epf.org/pubs/newsletters/2003/et20030113.pdf

shows a graph indicating employer-employee costs combined of private
health insurance tripled from 1986-2001. This is including a major break
(even a decrease in one year) in the late 1990's achieved by a shift

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not any different in the US as the transaction price in Canada.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Considering that 85% of all pharmaceutical sales in the US are covered
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;under a third party payment program, the price differences, especially
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;once you adjust for PPP, disappear.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, the price differences are part of why the USA private sector pays a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; higher percentage of GDP than Canadian government does in addition to USA
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; government paying as high a percentage of GDP as Canadian government does.

&gt;&gt;&gt;In terms of pharmaceutical sales, the US consumes more than Canada in
&gt;&gt;&gt;terms of number of units. State Medicaid systems generally pay less
&gt;&gt;&gt;for drugs (after rebates) than what is listed on the Canada (Ontario)
&gt;&gt;&gt;drug formualary. Medicaid, by law, pays no more (or less) than the
&gt;&gt;&gt;best purchaser (in this case the private insurance sector).
&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the transaction prices, at the insurance level, are
&gt;&gt;&gt;comparable to those in Canada.

&gt;&gt; Then why should I have a prescription plan that covers more of some
&gt;&gt; prescriptions than I can pay out of pocket at a warehouse club,

&gt;Care to rephrase this in English? Are you saying that your copay is
&gt;higher than the retail price at a discounter?

&gt;The FDA has determined that reimportation under current regulation is
&gt;not allowed. The FDA has determined that changing the regulation to
&gt;allow reimportation will result in a potential problem in ensuring the
&gt;safety of the drug supply. The pharmaceutical industry as well as
&gt;others concur with this. In recent testimony to Congress the issues
&gt;were laid out.

&gt;&gt; from getting a better price in Canada for the same USA-made

&gt;No, they are not necessarily the same - in fact, you will find that
&gt;trade dress, dosages, and apporved labeling can and does vary between
&gt;the US and other countries. You will also find that the country of
&gt;manufacture varies. However, when a drug is imported to the US from
&gt;ex-US, it is subject to FDA inspection, has a required document trail,
&gt;and meets the USP and FDA specifications. Intermediaries are
&gt;generally precluded from importing drugs.

&gt;&gt; US-FDA-approved drugs than I can get in the USA?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Private employers have to get the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; money somewhere - from you and me one way or another. If employers did
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not pay so much for healthcare, then they would put more money in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hands of employees and/or shareholders or give better prices to customers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or some combination of this.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So? Is spending 14% of GDP a bad thing? Is spending 7% of GDP a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;good thing?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 14% is turning into a major problem. Prices are so high that the USA's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; government is spending as high a percentage of GDP as Canada government
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Does this speak to the efficiency or the inefficiency of the US
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;government in managing health care?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Part is inefficiency or excessive prices on the part of private
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; providers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Let's see if I have this right. Providers, providing services to
&gt;&gt;&gt;government insured (Medicare and Medficaid are the biggest I think)
&gt;&gt;&gt;are able to extract premium prices (excessive?) and expanding this
&gt;&gt;&gt;government largess (or inability to negotiate better prices) to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;entire system of health care delivery will reduce health care costs?

&gt;&gt; No, I think the USA government errs oppositely, by paying what USA
&gt;&gt; healthcare providers can charge with neither competitive bidding nor a
&gt;&gt; largely single payer system.

&gt;Medicaid represetns 11% of the total health care budget in the US.
&gt;This is a budget that far exceeds that of Canada. Medicare has 40
&gt;million plus participants. It is twice the size of Australia and 5
&gt;times the size of Sweden.

&gt;Kaiser has millions of covered lives though less than the UK's NHS.
&gt;Kaiser provides better care for less than the NHS.

&gt;How is it that a private sector managed care provider can produce
&gt;better quality at a lower cost than a SP/UC system AND the US
&gt;government, with twice the resources, cannot?

"/>  Kaiser gets a break from covering those over 65. The main coverage of
those over 65 is a national healthcare plan in the USA as well as in the
countries that have national healthcare for everyone.
I think a fairer comparison is cost of covering Kaiser's customers
against cost in other countries excluding those over 65. I have heard a
few times before how so much of the cost of healthcare is what is spent on
a person in that person's last year of life.

&gt;&gt; hospital emergency rooms to handle.

&gt;To be eligible for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, hospitals are
&gt;required to provide a cetain proportion of uncompensated care. This
&gt;varies depending on institution but can be as little as 5% and as much

is a cost of labor.

National health expenditures are measured at the consumption level.

Canada's health care expenditures are reported at the reimbursement
(consumption) level, not as taxes (premiums) collected. The funds
under CHST are NOT health expenditures but rather transfer payments.

&gt;&gt;1986 - how much was your electric bill?

&gt; I am not sure about 1986, since I was rooming with someone else then.
&gt; But in 1989 electricity cost me 11.something or 12 cents per KWH and it's
&gt; about 14 cents per KWH now. Monthly line cost charge increased similarly
&gt; little, from to the nearest dollar $5/month to still under $5/month.

&gt;&gt; What was your car payment?

&gt; I first bought a car in 1996. Never financed a car.

&gt;&gt;What did you pay in rent?

&gt; 1989 - about $300/month for an efficiency.
&gt; Now, $620 for a 1-bedroom
&gt; with a dining area in addition to the kitchen and living room.

"/> Which explains a lot.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;How good is your memory?

&gt; Surely I remember paying $80/month when I started buying health
&gt; insurance in 1986 at a 2-99 size group rate. I don't remember what it was
&gt; in 1989 as well as I remember that every year where I saw a report in the
&gt; news on how much the average cost of health insurance increased in the
&gt; past year, it was always close to the increase of the plan I was on and
&gt; with few exceptions the annual increase was more than twice the increase
&gt; in CPI. More than one year increased by over 10%.

"/> I gave you the data - so?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; OK, my memory for my 1986 health insurance cost may be 7.95% low since I
&gt; could have been paying $80 per 4 weeks ($20 per week) since at that time I
&gt; had a weekly pay schedule at an employer that I got health insurance
&gt; through. I later switched to a monthly pay schedule while staying in the
&gt; same group (and working parttime for that employer) and paying that same
&gt; group's rates.

&gt;&gt; Honestly, I can't remeber what I paid for those things.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As for utilization having some major increase - did that
&gt;&gt;&gt; happen in nations with national healthcare?

&gt;&gt;You bet it did - and still does. The rate of increase in the US was
&gt;&gt;around 8% annualized (from 1985 to 2002). Most OECDs over the same
&gt;&gt;time were in the 6 or 7% range, except the UK where its 9% and Norway
&gt;&gt;where it approaches 10%.

&gt;&gt;These are readily retrievable OECD excel tables. You can run the
&gt;&gt;numbers any which way you want.

"/> No comment? Good.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Physician salaries outpaced average salaries of non-physicians since
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1986, but did not grow by any factor of five.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Neither did health premiums, as I pointed out. Can you understand the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;difference between costs and expenditures?

&gt;&gt;&gt; You pointed out expenditures growing more slowly, from about twice my
&gt;&gt;&gt; premium in 1986 to about 1.2 times my premium in 2003. You did not point
&gt;&gt;&gt; out any national average of premiums paid growing more slowly than mine.

&gt;&gt;That's the differnce between a single datum and the wonders of
&gt;&gt;statistics - and the concept of central tendency.

&gt; The rate at which the cost of my plan increased was always pretty close
&gt; to the rate at which the national average increased every time I heard it
&gt; on the news.

"/> Well - what you may or may not have heard on the news is of little
consequence, now isn't it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, in the late 1990's someone pointed me to a cite

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wonderful, another anecdote.

&gt;&gt;&gt; National statistic - force me to do so, I wil dig up a cite at a time of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the week when I have more time to do so.

&gt;&gt;It's not that tough. Try OECD data.

"/> Well?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for physician salaraies stagnating for a few years around then, but my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;health insurance premiums surely did not stagnate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;According to the Kaiser Family FoundationEmployer Health Benefits
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2003, the annual increas in health insurance premiums between 1995
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;aqnd 1998 was below the annual rate of inflation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I surely think that it's more than just ananecdote that my health
&gt;&gt;&gt; insurance premium about kept up with inflation from 1995 to 1998 despite
&gt;&gt;&gt; me stepping down to a lower plan.

&gt;&gt;Your single personal observation is not the equivalent of national
&gt;&gt;data. Sorry if you aren't happy about this but thats just the way it
&gt;&gt;is.

&gt;&gt;Look, my salary from 1985 to today increased at three times the rate
&gt;&gt;of the average worker - so? Good for me but that doesn't change the
&gt;&gt;fact that the average worker didn't see a 15% increase annualized.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And how about the time from 1986 to now?

&gt;&gt;You tell me? The best data are from 2002. I gave you those.
&gt;&gt;Historic data are provided in 1 or 5 year increments, depending.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not my anecdote, real live verifiable data.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;See Exhibit 1.2, p 21 in the report. You can get it at the local
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;library if you want.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I'm certainly not going to believe nurse salaries increased by a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; factor of five since 1986!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Considering your factor of 5 is wrong and you don't factor in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;utilization rates...what can I say?

&gt;&gt;&gt; $960 employer/employee combined in 1986, and I step down to a lower plan
&gt;&gt;&gt; to have this cost $5K in 2004!

&gt;&gt;OK - fine and dandy. But that doesn't change the fact that the
&gt;&gt;annulaized increase in health care expenduitures in the US from 1985
&gt;&gt;to 2002 was about 8% - equivalent to the rest of the industrialized
&gt;&gt;world - normal variances excepted.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You say $5K/year is about average now - did I underpay by a factor of
&gt;&gt;&gt; almost 2 in 1986?

&gt;&gt;Obviously your experience was not consistent with the mean of the
&gt;&gt;population. Like with any statistic, your gas mileage may ary.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My government is paying as high a percentage of GDP on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; healthcare as Canada's is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So your solution is to have them control ALL of health care? Gee -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;now that makes sense. They've already screwed up the first half, why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not let them screw up the rest?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My government spends plenty on health care costs that they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; presently not controlling - employer contributions for healthcare premiums
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of public sector employees!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If the public sector (Mediare as the example) is so damned good at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;controlling costs and expenditures, why is it that Federal employees
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are insured in the private sector?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Because the USA's pro-private-sector government has been willing to do
&gt;&gt;&gt; so, but cost increases from this about or over double inflation over the
&gt;&gt;&gt; past 20 years are changing the minds of quite a few USA voters!

&gt;&gt;But as I showed you, the increases are not a function of the financing
&gt;&gt;system used to fund expenditures - all health systems are experiencing
&gt;&gt;the same pressures and for the same reasons. More people are getting
&gt;&gt;more services that are more expensive because they are better and they
&gt;&gt;are getting this for a longer period of time.

"/> Don - wake UP! Learn the hows and whys of the expenditure changes -
and note, the US is NOT alone in this and for the SAME reasons.
Waking up to the reality that the amount spent on medical care is
going up because more people are using more services more often and
with much better technology - jees.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;thanks for playing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Did I underpay by a factor of 2 in 1986 but only by a factor of 1.15
&gt;&gt;&gt; now?

&gt;&gt;I don't know - I still contend you have a case of selective memory.
&gt;&gt;Whatever you have observed for your single case is NOT supported by
&gt;&gt;national data.

&gt; I took a look at so far:

To combine percentage increases of 11.5%, 10.9%, 8.0%, 4.8%, 2.1%, .5%,
2.1%, 3.3%, 4.1%, 7.5% and 10.2% that follow each other, what to do is

1.033, 1.041, 1.075 and 1.102.

My calculator says this works out to 1.867885 - an 86.7885% increase.

&gt;&gt; double digits.

&gt;So?

&gt;&gt; Small employer increases were shown for only 7 of the 11 years listed,
&gt;&gt; but all of those 7 were worse, with the combination of them totalling 3.5%
&gt;&gt; worse than for large employers. Combine this with the 86.8% increase seen
&gt;&gt; by large employers and it looks like a fair guess that premiums with small
&gt;&gt; employers increased by about 93.3% in the 11 year period from 1991-2001.

&gt;So?

&gt;&gt; And while the above site says 2001 had an increase of 10.2% for large
&gt;&gt; employers and 11% for small employers, the Mississippi Manufacturer's
&gt;&gt; Association says that the 2001 increase nationwide was 13%. (According to
&gt;&gt; a Google blurb on the no-longer-available
&gt;&gt; http://www.medc.ms/The%20Mississippi%20Manufacturers%20AssociationII.ppt )

&gt;So?

&gt;&gt; http://www.epf.org/pubs/newsletters/2003/et20030113.pdf

&gt;&gt; shows a graph indicating employer-employee costs combined of private
&gt;&gt; health insurance tripled from 1986-2001. This is including a major break
&gt;&gt; (even a decrease in one year) in the late 1990's achieved by a shift
&gt;&gt; towards managed care.
&gt;&gt; (This site was mainly pointing out how employee share did not increase
&gt;&gt; so badly. But employers had to pick up the tab!)

&gt;So?

&gt;&gt; http://www.kff.org/insurance/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/
&gt;&gt; getfile.cfm&amp;PageID=20688 (split into two lines) says:

&gt;&gt; 1988 - 12.0%
&gt;&gt; 1989 - 18.0%
&gt;&gt; 1990 - 14.0%

&gt;&gt; 2002 - 12.9%
&gt;&gt; 2003 - 13.9%

&gt;&gt; 1991-2001 - similar enough to
&gt;&gt; http://www.hschange.org/CONTENT/380/table1.shtml

&gt;&gt; Add these five years to the 90% increase of 1991-2001 and you get 2003
&gt;&gt; private health insurance premiums costing 3.68 times those of 1988.

&gt;Do you really? Have you ever done the actual calculations?

"/>  Yes I did. 1.9 times 1.12 times 1.18 times 1.14 times 1.129 times 1.139
is the calculation, and the answer is 3.681.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Add to this the 1987 increase (somewhere around 10% in my memory) and
&gt;&gt; the 2004 increase (about 14%, although web searching appears to be giving

&gt;&gt; before the year is done), and 2003 costing 3.68 as much as 1987 becomes
&gt;&gt; 2004 costing about 4.6 times as much as 1986.

&gt;&gt; That's closer to my original anecdote of 5 than to the factor of 3.075
&gt;&gt; worked out from what you posted in message
&gt;&gt;&lt;fbcaefd.0406291154.4f814 ... @posting.google.com&gt;

&gt;&gt; as in national average of per capita healthcare expenditures increasing
&gt;&gt; from $1,872 to $5,757.

&gt;But Donny, those are the data. You got a deal in 1986 if you paid
&gt;HALF of the average annual expenditure - but then again, in 1986 you
&gt;were 18 years YOUNGER.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Look on page 2 of the citation:

&gt;Do the math, stupid. That's an annualized increase of about 7%.
&gt;Assuming the other numbers are right, incorporating the annualized
&gt;increases puts YOUR 1986 premium at about $1,700 assuming a 2004

&gt;You LIED when you said that you paid $960 in 1986.

&gt;So - now what?

"/>  I did not lie. I may not be remembering whether it was $80 per month,
$80 per 4 weeks or $20 per week, so it could have been $1043 per year
rather than $960, but it was definitely one of these two figures.
I did cite statistics supporting a national average of private health
insurance premiums being 4.6 times as high in 2004 as they were in 1986,
except assuming the national average percentage increase from 1986-1987
and 2003-2004 was the same as how I remember mine. I found cites for the
percentage annual increases on a national average basis for all years in
between. This even includes the national average effect of many people
switching to lower cost plans such as PPOs and managed care plans in the
mid-late 1990's as I did.
You question my math for combining annual percentage increases, and I
show how that is done.
My original anecdote was that mine increased by a factor of 5, and I am
conceding what I may not remember correctly from 1986 that could change my
personal figure from 5 to something 8% less.

I claim something hardly more severe than a national average that I can
support, and you call me a liar.

========
And yes, I can show that I was not wrong (as you claimed two postings
earlier) when I said that a family of 4 with a sole breadwinner making US
median individual income is close to your 200% of poverty level that
qualifies for a program based on poverty. (Or maybe only that good for
male breadwinners?)

http://www.census.gov/hhes/income/histinc/p53.html , says median
wage/salary in 2001 (counting only persons 14-plus with wages/salaries)
was $31,519 for men and $21,064 for women.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I took a look at so far:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.hschange.org/CONTENT/380/table1.shtml

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Premiums for large firms increased by 86.8% from 1991-2001, if you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; increase 1 by the percentages shown for each of those years.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You are not very good at math, are you.

&gt;&gt; Ask a math teacher:

&gt;&gt; To combine percentage increases of 11.5%, 10.9%, 8.0%, 4.8%, 2.1%, .5%,
&gt;&gt; 2.1%, 3.3%, 4.1%, 7.5% and 10.2% that follow each other, what to do is
&gt;&gt; multiply by each other 1.115, 1.109, 1.08, 1.048, 1.021, 1.005, 1.021,
&gt;&gt; 1.033, 1.041, 1.075 and 1.102.

&gt;&gt; My calculator says this works out to 1.867885 - an 86.7885% increase.

&gt;Now, run the numbers using the same compounded rates using YOUR base
&gt;premium - and then tell me how it matches. Got it? Good.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I do see 3 years rather than 1 where this did not outpace the CPI,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and two of those 3 the increase was hardly under the CPI. A 4th year was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; close, appeared to me hardly over the CPI. Along with 4 years where it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; outpaced the CPI by a factor of more than 2, one of them inflating in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; double digits.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Small employer increases were shown for only 7 of the 11 years listed,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but all of those 7 were worse, with the combination of them totalling 3.5%
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; worse than for large employers. Combine this with the 86.8% increase seen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by large employers and it looks like a fair guess that premiums with small
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; employers increased by about 93.3% in the 11 year period from 1991-2001.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And while the above site says 2001 had an increase of 10.2% for large
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; employers and 11% for small employers, the Mississippi Manufacturer's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Association says that the 2001 increase nationwide was 13%. (According to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a Google blurb on the no-longer-available
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.medc.ms/The%20Mississippi%20Manufacturers%20AssociationII.ppt )

&gt;&gt;&gt;So?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.epf.org/pubs/newsletters/2003/et20030113.pdf

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shows a graph indicating employer-employee costs combined of private
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; health insurance tripled from 1986-2001. This is including a major break
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (even a decrease in one year) in the late 1990's achieved by a shift
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; towards managed care.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (This site was mainly pointing out how employee share did not increase
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so badly. But employers had to pick up the tab!)

&gt;&gt;&gt;So?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.kff.org/insurance/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; getfile.cfm&amp;PageID=20688 (split into two lines) says:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1988 - 12.0%
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1989 - 18.0%
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1990 - 14.0%

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2002 - 12.9%
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2003 - 13.9%

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1991-2001 - similar enough to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.hschange.org/CONTENT/380/table1.shtml

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Add these five years to the 90% increase of 1991-2001 and you get 2003
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; private health insurance premiums costing 3.68 times those of 1988.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Do you really? Have you ever done the actual calculations?

&gt;&gt; Yes I did. 1.9 times 1.12 times 1.18 times 1.14 times 1.129 times 1.139
&gt;&gt; is the calculation, and the answer is 3.681.

&gt;Then the answer should be obvious to you - you lied.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Add to this the 1987 increase (somewhere around 10% in my memory) and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the 2004 increase (about 14%, although web searching appears to be giving
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thousands of local results as opposed to any easy-to-find national ones
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before the year is done), and 2003 costing 3.68 as much as 1987 becomes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2004 costing about 4.6 times as much as 1986.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's closer to my original anecdote of 5 than to the factor of 3.075
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; worked out from what you posted in message
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;fbcaefd.0406291154.4f814 ... @posting.google.com&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as in national average of per capita healthcare expenditures increasing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from $1,872 to $5,757.

&gt;&gt;&gt;But Donny, those are the data. You got a deal in 1986 if you paid
&gt;&gt;&gt;HALF of the average annual expenditure - but then again, in 1986 you
&gt;&gt;&gt;were 18 years YOUNGER.

&gt;&gt; From then to now I was paying a group rate that did not vary with age.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Look on page 2 of the citation:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;In 2001, the average annual cost of of health benefits...was
&gt;&gt;&gt;$4200...Twenty one years before, in 1980, the total cost [of health
&gt;&gt;&gt;care insurance] was $1047 per year...&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Do the math, stupid. That's an annualized increase of about 7%.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Assuming the other numbers are right, incorporating the annualized
&gt;&gt;&gt;increases puts YOUR 1986 premium at about $1,700 assuming a 2004
&gt;&gt;&gt;premium of $5000.

&gt;&gt; Then why did I step down a plan within the same carrier where I was
&gt;&gt; paying a group rate to get a break that lasted only a couple years?

&gt;Because you need that lie to make your point.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Your $960 number is a flat out fabrication - it doesn't jive with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;real data from national averages.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You LIED when you said that you paid $960 in 1986.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So - now what?

&gt;&gt; I did not lie.

&gt;of course you did - because you dug yourself a hole and can't get out.

&gt;&gt; I may not be remembering whether it was $80 per month,
&gt;&gt; $80 per 4 weeks or $20 per week, so it could have been $1043 per year
&gt;&gt; rather than $960, but it was definitely one of these two figures.

&gt;And I pointed out - your recollection is inconsistent with the
&gt;national data - proved it - and you even prioved it yourself - and you
&gt;still insist that your recollection is accurate.

&gt;Bullshit Donny - admit you are wrong and apologize.

&gt;&gt; I did cite statistics supporting a national average of private health
&gt;&gt; insurance premiums being 4.6 times as high in 2004 as they were in 1986,
&gt;&gt; except assuming the national average percentage increase from 1986-1987
&gt;&gt; and 2003-2004 was the same as how I remember mine. I found cites for the
&gt;&gt; percentage annual increases on a national average basis for all years in
&gt;&gt; between. This even includes the national average effect of many people
&gt;&gt; switching to lower cost plans such as PPOs and managed care plans in the
&gt;&gt; mid-late 1990's as I did.
&gt;&gt; You question my math for combining annual percentage increases, and I
&gt;&gt; show how that is done.
&gt;&gt; My original anecdote was that mine increased by a factor of 5, and I am
&gt;&gt; conceding what I may not remember correctly from 1986 that could change my
&gt;&gt; personal figure from 5 to something 8% less.

&gt;I'll take that as a weasle admission that you erred.

&gt;&gt; I claim something hardly more severe than a national average that I can
&gt;&gt; support, and you call me a liar.

&gt;Because you are. Under the 7% annual average from the data, you would
&gt;be paying 2600, not 5 grand.

"/>  Are you claiming my cites for annual percentage increases for health
insurance premiums are lying?

Let's increase my original claim of $960 by the percentages I cited for
16 years and two where I have a good guess from personal experience but
yet to find a cite for the national figure for:

1987 - 10% (can't yet cite) changes 960 to 1056

1988 - 12% ( http://www.kff.org/insurance/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/
security/getfile.cfm&amp;PageID=20688) changes 1056 to 1182.72

1989 - 18% (same cite) 1182.72 to changes 1393.61

1990 - 14% (same cite) changes 1393.61 to 1590.99

1991 - 11.5% (large firm only figure)
( http://www.hschange.org/CONTENT/380/table1.shtml )
(For 1991-2001 cites figures for large firms, but &quot;all firms&quot;
only 7 of these 11, and for all years when both were
mentioned &quot;all firms&quot; increased worse), changes 1590.99 to
1773.96

1992 - 10.9% (large firm only figure) changes 1773.96 to 1962.32

1993 - 8.5% (all firms figure) changes 1962.32 to 2134.54

1994 - 4.8% (large firms only figure) changes 2134.54 to 2237.00

1995 - 2.1% (all firms figure) changes 2237.00 to 2283.98

1996 - .8% (all firms figure) changes 2283.98 to 2302.25

1997 - 2.1% (large firms only figure) changes 2302.25 to 2350.60

1998 - 3.7% (all firms figure) changes 2350.60 to 2437.57

1999 - 4.8% (all firms figure) changes 2437.57 to 2554.57

2000 - 8.3% (all firms figure) changes 2554.57 to 2766.60

2001 - 11.0% (all firms figure) changes 2766.60 to 3070.93

2002 - 12.9% ( http://www.kff.org/insurance/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/
security/getfile.cfm&amp;PageID=20688) changes 3070.93 to
3467.08

2003 - 13.9% (same cite) changes 3467.08 to 3949.00

2004 - 14% my experience (did not yet find a cite for a national average
figure) changes 3949.00 to 4501.86

If my original claim for paying $960/year in 1986 increased at national
average rates that I can find cites for 16 of the 18 years since 1986 and
by 10% for 1987 over 1986 and 14% for 2004 over 2003, I should be paying
$4501.86/year. Not that far from the 5K that applies to me now.

Does this sound like I made such a claim of how much my rates increased
because I was lying? Or more like I said that my rates increased to an
extent not far from an actual citable national average?

me joining the group whose group rate I pay. Same as all other premium
increases that I endured after I joined the group. Or are you going to

2005 increase?

My $80/month (or $20/week, still don't remember which) that I said
I paid in 1986 was actually for the first year that I was in the group,
which was a 12-month period mostly in 1986 but extending a little into 1987.

Meanwhile, show me a link where I and everyone else can see something
supporting your contention of an increase of:

&quot; Annual expenditures for health care per capita in 1986 was $1,872. In
2003 it was $5,757.&quot; as you claimed in article
&lt;fbcaefd.0406291154.4f814 ... @posting.google.com&gt;. And if this figure is
not specifically for expenditures on those with private health insurance,
then tell us what this is for - along with your cite for how much private
health insurance premiums increased, or else let my cites stand.

I showed links supporting my contentions.

And attacking my credibility does not dispute figures you provided of
USA government spending 6.6% of its GDP to cover only the subset of the
USA's aprox. 290 million excluding (44 million minus illegal immigrants)
and excluding all of the approx. 190 million with employer health
insurance other than public sector employees whose payroll costs are in
the budgets of government agencies counted in the 6.6% figure.

This is not changed by your arguments of how many are uncovered
voluntarily. (Besides, one major reason for sCHIPS eligibles being
uncovered is that they applied and got rejected on the basis of paperwork
errors/omissions. No matter whose fault it is that they were uncovered,
they were trying unsuccessfully to be covered.)

In addition to your 6.6% (according to you correcting me), my government
spends something for employer contributions to private healthcare premiums
for public sector employees whose payroll expenses are not in agencies
whose budgets are paid by your 6.6% figure. This includes most public
sector employees.
Your calling that a payroll expense and not a healthcare expenditure
does not change the fact that my government is spending that money beyond
your 6.6% figure and that it goes to healthcare exenditures (and overhead,
etc. therefrom) outside your 6.6% figure.

And your arguments and your attacks on my credibility do not counter
your figure of Canada's government spending 6.7% of its GDP to give basic
coverage to all of its citizens including its public sector employees.

I still contend that the USA's taxpayers are not getting a bargain for
the USA doing healthcare its way.

Here you go -

In the original you posted these values.

&quot;To combine percentage increases of 11.5%, 10.9%, 8.0%, 4.8%, 2.1%,
.5%,
2.1%, 3.3%, 4.1%, 7.5% and 10.2% that follow each other, what to do is
multiply by each other 1.115, 1.109, 1.08, 1.048, 1.021, 1.005, 1.021,
1.033, 1.041, 1.075 and 1.102.&quot;

In the calculations, you used these values.

&quot;Yes I did. 1.9 times 1.12 times 1.18 times 1.14 times 1.129 times
1.139
is the calculation, and the answer is 3.681.&quot;

and this:

&quot;1987 - 10% (can't yet cite) changes 960 to 1056

1988 - 12% ( http://www.kff.org/insurance/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/
security/getfile.cfm&amp;PageID=20688) changes 1056 to 1182.72

1989 - 18% (same cite) 1182.72 to changes 1393.61

1990 - 14% (same cite) changes 1393.61 to 1590.99

1991 - 11.5% (large firm only figure)
( http://www.hschange.org/CONTENT/380/table1.shtml )
(For 1991-2001 cites figures for large firms, but &quot;all
firms&quot;
only 7 of these 11, and for all years when both were
mentioned &quot;all firms&quot; increased worse), changes 1590.99
to
1773.96

1992 - 10.9% (large firm only figure) changes 1773.96 to 1962.32

1993 - 8.5% (all firms figure) changes 1962.32 to 2134.54

1994 - 4.8% (large firms only figure) changes 2134.54 to 2237.00

1995 - 2.1% (all firms figure) changes 2237.00 to 2283.98

1996 - .8% (all firms figure) changes 2283.98 to 2302.25

1997 - 2.1% (large firms only figure) changes 2302.25 to 2350.60

1998 - 3.7% (all firms figure) changes 2350.60 to 2437.57

1999 - 4.8% (all firms figure) changes 2437.57 to 2554.57

2000 - 8.3% (all firms figure) changes 2554.57 to 2766.60

2001 - 11.0% (all firms figure) changes 2766.60 to 3070.93

2002 - 12.9% ( http://www.kff.org/insurance/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/
security/getfile.cfm&amp;PageID=20688) changes 3070.93 to
3467.08

2003 - 13.9% (same cite) changes 3467.08 to 3949.00

2004 - 14% my experience (did not yet find a cite for a national
average
figure) changes 3949.00 to 4501.86

Now that the proof is here in black and white - done.

But just to make it really clear - you have the balls to make up
numbers:

&quot;Add to this the 1987 increase (somewhere around 10% in my memory)&quot;

and this:

&quot;and the 2004 increase (about 14%, although web searching appears to
be giving
thousands of local results as opposed to any easy-to-find national
ones before the year is done),&quot;

To get this:

&quot;costing 3.68 as much as 1987 becomes 2004 costing about 4.6 times as
much as 1986.&quot;

so you can conclude this:

&quot;That's closer to my original anecdote of 5 than to the factor of
3.075
worked out from what you posted in message&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; A link where I can see your $1,872 and $5,757 figures. Or are you
&gt;&gt;&gt; afraid it will also show something else making the USA's way of doing
&gt;&gt;&gt; things look bad?

&gt;&gt;That's the point, isn't it. You'll do anything to make the US private
&gt;&gt;sector health care system &quot;look&quot; bad.

&gt; Easy enough to do - does not that indicate something is wrong there?

"/> In 1997 Tony Blair admitted his NHS was sorely underfunded. In 2000,
Canada admitted it needed to step up health funding to avoid a crises.
Germany is cutting medical services because they can't raise enough
revnues to meet the current needs of it's population.

Prove to me that 14% of GDP is a bad thing.

&gt; Sites where I found other nations having healthcare inflation as bad as

&gt;&gt; No, I did not make up my actual Blue Cross bill!

&gt;&gt; By any chance, are you depending on my ability to cite for 2004 costing
&gt;&gt; 14% more than 2003 to occur after the election?

&gt;The worst thing is, idiots like you can vote. Most every thing else
&gt;we do that requires any amount of intelligence requires a license -
&gt;except procreation and voting. To procreat, all you need is a penis

&gt;&gt;Yes, you made it up - just like you made up the $960.

&gt;&gt;&gt; By any chance, are you depending on my ability to cite for 2004 costing
&gt;&gt;&gt; 14% more than 2003 to occur after the election?

&gt;&gt;The worst thing is, idiots like you can vote. Most every thing else
&gt;&gt;we do that requires any amount of intelligence requires a license -
&gt;&gt;except procreation and voting. To procreat, all you need is a penis
&gt;&gt;and to vote, all you have to do is be born in the US.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I got $960 increasing to 4.5K, close enough to force you to accuse me
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of making up pre-1990 numbers when I was able to cite 1989, 1988 and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1987.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What more do you want?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A link where I can see your $1,872 and $5,757 figures. Or are you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; afraid it will also show something else making the USA's way of doing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; things look bad?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That's the point, isn't it. You'll do anything to make the US private
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sector health care system &quot;look&quot; bad.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Easy enough to do - does not that indicate something is wrong there?

&gt;&gt;In 1997 Tony Blair admitted his NHS was sorely underfunded. In 2000,
&gt;&gt;Canada admitted it needed to step up health funding to avoid a crises.
&gt;&gt; Germany is cutting medical services because they can't raise enough
&gt;&gt;revnues to meet the current needs of it's population.

&gt;&gt;Prove to me that 14% of GDP is a bad thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you understand that the increased cost of health care is not a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uniquely American phenomenon?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sites where I found other nations having healthcare inflation as bad as
&gt;&gt;&gt; the USA has also said the USA was as badly worse than the others were 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; and 20 years ago then as badly as now! With the USA having higher percent
&gt;&gt;&gt; of GDP spent on healthcare than nations with national healthcare plans now
&gt;&gt;&gt; and 10 and 20 years ago and a uniquely USA high percentage of its citizens
&gt;&gt;&gt; uncovered, I surely say the USA is doing something wrong!

&gt;&gt;And you'd be an idiot - you can't show that spending 14% is a bad
&gt;&gt;thing. Imagine if the US only spent 10% - what would the result be?

&gt;&gt;With a national wealth almost 40% higher than most countries and a
&gt;&gt;standard of living 30% higher, what would you expect us to spend on
&gt;&gt;health?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Americans paying 14% of GDP for healthcare is uniquely American.

&gt;&gt;And the standard of living enjoyed by Americans is unique, too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;By lying you aren't making anyone look bad but yourself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I showed links supporting my contentions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have yet to see one with your $1,872 and $5,757 figures.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's CMS data asshole - numbers I've cited on more than one occasion.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You mention the numbers but not a web page that has them.

&gt;&gt;CMS asshole.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is common knowledge. Even your Kaiser website has the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;numbers.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Show me where - I saw a Kaiser page showing &quot;healthcare expenditure
&gt;&gt;&gt; growth&quot; from 1992 to 2002 supporting your claims (which is bad enough),
&gt;&gt;&gt; but showing faster growth of private health insurance premiums:

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.kff.org/insurance/7031/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/
&gt;&gt;&gt; getfile.cfm&amp;PageID=36091

&gt;&gt;&gt; Shows 2002 premiums over triple those of 1986.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And they mention a source:

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.cms.hhs.gov/statistics/nhe/historical/t11.asp

&gt;&gt;&gt; (tabulated data under the graph labeled &quot;exhibit 1.1&quot;)

&gt;&gt;&gt; That source has two columns showing year-by-year percentage increases in
&gt;&gt;&gt; private health insurance premiums. One is labelled &quot;common benefits&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; (with an explanation notably lacking prescription drugs) and the other is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;all benefits&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The &quot;common benefits&quot; is lower and looks like what Kaiser used. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;all benefits&quot; has percentages working out to 2002 costing 3.7 times as
&gt;&gt;&gt; much as 1986 - slightly more extreme than I claimed in year-by-year work
&gt;&gt;&gt; where you accused me of cherrypicking!

&gt;&gt;&gt; I found in Kaiser's website stuff closer to my claims than to yours as
&gt;&gt;&gt; to how fast my premiums inflated and yet to see $1,872 and $5,757 for
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything. I suggest you post a link to a page with these numbers, unless
&gt;&gt;&gt; that page also mentions other things more favoring to me than to you.

&gt;&gt;No asshole, you made up numbers.

&gt;&gt;The increase in health expenditures in the US between 1986 and 2003
&gt;&gt;was about 300% - and this increase is not uniquely American.

&gt;&lt;SNIP some of the stuff on me adding to your 6.6% of GDP figure&gt;

&gt;To cherrypick and then try and excuse it because its 3 AM is pathetic.

"/>  What I did was switch from &quot;large emploers&quot; to &quot;all employers&quot; for the
years that &quot;all employers&quot; figures was mentioned. In some years &quot;all
employers&quot; was not mentioned, while in every year &quot;large employers&quot; was
mentioned.
In every year of the majority of years that both were mentioned, &quot;all
employers&quot; was worse than &quot;large employers&quot;. Since my Blue Cross group
was/is through a small employer, it is not cherrypicking to use &quot;all
employers&quot; over &quot;large employers&quot; to show citable data to largely support
how my Blue Cross rates inflated by a factor of about 5 from 1986 to 2004.

What would your argument have been if I &quot;stayed the course&quot; and ate the
3% difference accumulated over those 11 years? (The ratio is 1.91/1.86)

&lt;SNIP more of this&gt;

&lt;SNIP another point or two where neither of us added anything new lately&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&lt;SNIP some of the stuff on me adding to your 6.6% of GDP figure&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;ADDING! There you go again, dimwit. Either count expenditures or
&gt;&gt;&gt;count premiums - don't count both!

&gt;&gt; I did not count the expenditures that were paid by the premiums I added.

&gt;Look - the government reimburses about half of all health care

"/> According to you, Canada's does 74% (using your figures of 6.7% of GDP
spent by government and 9% of GDP total) while USA gov't spends according
to you 6.6% of GDP out of a total of 14% - sometimes you said 15%

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;services. The private sector takes care of the other half. End of
&gt;story.

"/>  With the USA gov't (by your figures) costing 6.6% of GDP while Canada's
gov't does it with 6.7% of their GDP to provide basic coverage to
everyone, without having to wait until age 65.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;When an employer pays $5000 for insurance and Blue Cross pays a $5000
&gt;&gt;&gt;bill to a hospital, did the US spend $10,000 on health care? NO.

&gt;&gt; In this example, US spent $5,000 that according to an earlier post by
&gt;&gt; you was not counted in your 6.6%-of-GDP figure if the employee was a
&gt;&gt; public sector employee whose job is not in any of the agencies whose
&gt;&gt; budgets are in your 6.6% figure.

&gt;Because the employee is a Federal one does not make his health care
&gt;insurance a Federal health care expenditure. What is it about this
&gt;you don't get? When BC/BS pays $5000 for an inpatient stay, it falls
&gt;under a non-government payment for health services. When Medicare
&gt;pays for a $5000 inpatient stay, it falls under a Federal government
&gt;heealth care expenditure.

"/>  I did not have USA's Medicare spending anything on this! USA's Medicare
spends money on retired people rather than on employees!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;If you want to count it the other way, then here's what you need to do
&gt;- since the private secote pays TAXES (premiums) for Medicare, then it
&gt;really isn't a government expenditure, it is a transfer payment.

"/>  But when a Federal employee (in most but not all agencies) or a public
school teacher or a police officer (outside a few police forces such as VA
police) or a prison guard or a municipal professional firefighter has
employer contributions to their health insurance premiums, this is
government expenditure that you were so glad to tell me a few postings ago
was not counted in your 6.6% figure for % of USA GDP spent by gov't on
healthcare.
Calling it premiums rather than expenditures does not negate this.
Calling it an orange rather than an apple does not negate this being
tree-borne-fruit that the USA gov't spends money on in addition to
(according to you) your 6.6%-of-GDP figure (according to you) while Canada
has this covered within their (according to you) 6.7%-of-GDP figure.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Got it? Good. That's why you don't mix expendtures for health care
&gt;with premiums for health care insurance - because it results in double
&gt;counting.

"/> (repeat quoting of material that you posted)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;When an employer pays $5000 for insurance and Blue Cross pays a $5000
&gt;&gt;&gt;bill to a hospital, did the US spend $10,000 on health care? NO.

"/>  I counted only once - I counted the most-of-$5K of premiums that a
taxpayer-funded employer pays (that you told me were not in your
6.6%-of-GDP figure in the case of most public sector employees). I did
not count both halves of the $10K!

As I said, I counted the $5,000 only once. If the employee is a public
sector one outside the agencies included in your 6.6%-of-GDP-spent-by-govt
figure, you were so glad to say the employer contributions to premiums
were not counted in your 6.6% figure just to say I was wrong about
something.
Using your claimed (several postings ago) average of employee paying
$100/month, that leaves $3800/year of the $5K/year premiums being
something the taxpayers pay for on behalf of most public sector employees
that (according to you) are not included in your 6.6%-of-GDP figure.

Not double counting, and already covered in your figure of Canada's
figure of 6.7% of GDP.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And with that, I'm done with this argument. As far as I'm concerned,
&gt;you are far too dense to understand and it is pointless to continue.

"/>&lt;SNIP some stuff after this&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If landlords did not pay property taxes, the market would have a higher
&gt;&gt; profit motive to build more rental property. Such a higher supply would
&gt;&gt; lower rents. Or is there no law of supply and demand there?

&gt;You can't be serious. Are you really this dumb?

"/>  (This is a point where I feel I can rest my case on that point! Unless
you would claim that tenants are not hurt by taxes on landlords - would
you rather agree that tenants are not hurt if we passed a new tax or a tax
boost that only hit landlords?)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;The income tax on wage earners at minimum wage, after the tax credits
&gt;&gt;&gt;and offsets, comes out to less than 5% - and that's the social
&gt;&gt;&gt;security part, not the income tax part. Cry me a river.

&gt;&gt; Plus state and local taxes.

&gt;State taxes are based on Fed AGI. With credits and offsets, poor
&gt;people pay little if anything.

"/>  In Pennsylvania, the state income tax is not based on AGI but on total
income. There is a &quot;tax forgiveness&quot; for extremely low income, but this
is not to the extent of not taxing all income that the Feds do not tax.

A fulltime minimum wage earner in Pennsylvania normally pays for PA state
income tax the same percentage of wages that is paid by a Philadelphia
union plumber or union electrician working overtime.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Local the same way.

"/>  Local wage taxes and locval income taxes in PA tax equally every dollar
from number 1 to number 100 billion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Again - let me be very CLEAR...in the US, the upper quintile pays the
&gt;largest share of taxes, the upper two quintiles pay almost two thirds,
&gt;and the upper half almost 95%.

"/>  Which one of us wants to post what the incomes are of these percentiles,
and what their tax burdens are including state and local taxes, income or
otherwise?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So stick it in your ear. For every
&gt;dollar in taxes you pay, I pay at least $10 if not $20 or even more.
&gt;You said you earn four times the minimum wage?

"/> No, I said I earn about 4 times the threshold of Federal taxes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; OK - that puts you in the 50K range. Your tax liability (total) is
&gt; about 25% including all
&gt;the state and federal. $12,500 is what you paid last year, total.
&gt;Add a zero to that and you have JUST my Federal income tax liability -
&gt;after deductions and just on earned income.

"/>  You claimed only a post or two ago to be working class!

&lt;SNIP some stuff traded back and forth at least 2 cycles of posting&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Why do you think Canada spends another 3% of GDP on TOP of their 6.7%?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is that necessary?

&gt;&gt; More than twice as bad

"/>  USA has private expenditures according to you 7% of GDP compared to
Canada's according-to-you 3%.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Bad? Why do you keep insisting that these expenditures are bad?

"/>  According to you, USA healthcare inflation is as bad that of other
industrialized nations and the USA spends 14-15% of GDP on healthcare
while Canada spends 9%. Maintain the current rates of healthcare
inflation and the USA will spend 100% of its GDP on healthcare quite a few
years before Canada does!
