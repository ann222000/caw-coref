The following was written near the end of 1998 at the centennial of
Northeastern University in a fashion that it reads like it was written
shortly after N.U.'s bicentennial in 2098. It is originally from

Bulletin from the Bicentennial
What Wonders the Next Century Will Bring

By Herbert Hadad

The snickering ceased around 2048. The mocking stopped by early 2098.
Odious and insolent words had been heard in tall marbled halls and
paneled boardrooms from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Cambridge,
England. They had been directed, for the better part of 200 years, at
an increasingly sylvan academic metropolis whose main entrance
remained on Huntington Avenue (long since restored from the cumbersome
&quot;Avenue of the Arts&quot;) in the city of Boston. But for believers in the
Northeastern dream, the best was yet to come. The year 2098 would not
yield your typical self-congratulatory bicentennial. No rich graduates
in hard hats posing with silver-plated shovels. No grip-and-grin photo
ops featuring four-foot-long checks. Prolonged speeches by
distinguished statesmen and specially commissioned pieces of
cacophonous music were not prohibited, but attendance at these events
was purely voluntary and exceedingly slim. By the time Northeastern's
bicentennial was over, not only the university, not only Boston, but
this whole cockeyed world was going to be a better place. But first
let's back up 100 years or so.

Around the time of the centennial-which, dusty archives tell us,
occasioned a year-long panoply of celebrations and speeches on
Northeastern's past but only a single magazine article (so far as we
can tell) on the university's potential future-N.U. was a flourishing
educational concern. It had just under 27,000 full- and part-time
undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff numbering
almost 4,500, nearly 140,000 living alumni, and an endowment so
fragile that trustees chronically woke up trembling and screaming in
the middle of the night. Some other institutions, particularly those
whose buildings and reputations were embraced (some would say choked)
by a weed imported from England, chortled about endowments almost too
large to count.

Northeastern had mounted a Centennial Campaign and had in fact doubled
the endowment from $172 million to more than $350 million-not exactly
chump change but still potentially perilous for an important
university. The problem was so acute that the sixth university
president, Richard M. Freeland, who insisted he made no effort to look
like Robert F. Kennedy or orate like William Jennings Bryan, went on
the stump trying to raise funds to ameliorate the problem. One night,
for instance, he rented a ballroom in someone else's club in New York
City and told the gathered alumni numbed on cheese and white wine that
he was worried about the endowment and that Northeastern was ninety-
one percent dependent on tuition, a poor formula for carrying out the
good works and deeds he foresaw for his school. People clapped and
raced for the doors, some blaming their departure on a date with
something called Seinfeld, while others babbled about something called
Baywatch.

But President Freeland was also prescient. He anticipated his
university's future and developed what he came to call his mantra:
&quot;Northeastern is a national research university that is student-
centered, practice-oriented, and urban.&quot; While it did not exactly trip
off the tongue, like &quot;a chicken in every pot&quot; or &quot;hell, no, we won't
go,&quot; Freeland repeated it often enough and ordered it published in so
much university literature that it soon had a profound effect. It was
reported that everyone from trustees and alumni to students and even
an influential professor named Jack Levin began to utter it, often
while burning incense. The slogan became popular in Back Bay T-shirt
emporiums, it insinuated itself into the country's academic psyche,
the National Education Association mounted a seminar on its &quot;hidden
meanings and religious relevance,&quot; and it was translated into some
forty-seven languages. The mantra inspired an aeronautical engineering
student to attempt to skywrite it, but while making a radical turn to
correct some punctuation, his craft plunged into the Charles River and
he had to be rescued.

Like other great epochs, however, the new Northeastern century began
in a wilderness, where the university had to find its way through both
tribulation and triumph. Electronic technology had been harnessed for
higher education even before the beginning of the twenty-first
century, and Northeastern was no laggard in joining this wave.
Eventually, classroom time was reduced to a minimum, and eliminated
altogether in some disciplines, as students pinned their attention to
monitors and computers in their dormitories, soaking up the knowledge
and wisdom of a small, elite corps of professors who delivered
recorded lectures to thousands of students simultaneously.

But no one anticipated another problem. Students spent so much time in
dorms that one day police cordoned off N.U.'s entire residential
neighborhood and health inspectors in protective suits entered. They
found, among other things, barbecue-flavored potato chips that carbon-
tested at twenty-five years and chocolate-covered malted milk balls
that had begun to reproduce themselves. The budget for faculty had
plummeted, to be sure, as had the need for classrooms and
laboratories, but what had been harnessed, it turned out, had spun out
of control. A whole generation of would-be teachers was never trained
or hired, ideas never promulgated, the exciting give-and-take between
student and lecturer never experienced. To its credit, Northeastern
became one of the first universities to abandon the electronic elitist
approach to education. Northeastern returned to the traditional
American methods of education, which it maintained until and beyond
the bicentennial.

The university's newfound stature as a bastion of classical education
attracted the young people of the late twenty-first century in
increasing numbers, despite Boston's cold, damp, and sometimes
snowbound winters and the sniffles these conditions engendered. After
a hasty emergency meeting, the board of trustees decided to forsake
the school's century-old plan for controlled growth and throw open the
doors. Northeastern had been the largest private university in the
United States back in the 1960s and 1970s and, almost exactly a
century later, it again took on the benefits and responsibilities of
that distinction.

Co-op coordinators initially were beside themselves, concerned about
finding career-related jobs for more than 200,000 students that were
not absolutely boring, irrelevant jobs, as some coordinators had
specialized in, once upon a time. School officials shuddered at the
prospect of finding classroom and dormitory space. Others worried
about the adequacy of faculty and staff. In fact, the only site on
campus from which nothing was emitted but subtle murmurs of a serene,
sensual bliss was the bursar's office. It turned out that the worries
of the others were without merit. While some other Boston universities
had expropriated their surroundings to expand (we won't indulge in
name-calling), Northeastern had entered into a partnership with its
community, the adjoining Roxbury neighborhood, providing jobs,
education, housing, dignity, and friendship. By the time of the Great
Influx, as the rush of new students came to be called, the
Northeastern flag flew all the way from Massachusetts Avenue to
Mattapan Square and west to the Dedham line. The towns of Milton and
Westwood vied for the next round of expansion.

So Northeastern had established its credentials beyond any doubt.
Based on the vision of President Freeland and his team, N.U. was
becoming one of the great educational experiments in history. The
Tobin Elementary School in Roxbury was renamed the Tobin Institute at
Northeastern, which had the perfect ring for youngsters who now saw
for themselves a more promising future. It's true that the chorus of
hosannas was far from universal. This was still America, and
competition to be the best and biggest remained intense. Pitiful
catcalls of &quot;upstart YMCA night school&quot; and worse were heard from
ivory towers on occasion, but seemed increasingly quaint, like real
bow ties, watch fobs, and rumbling trolley cars.

Northeastern also began to export its famous cooperative education
program, opening satellite campuses from Hanover, New Hampshire, to
Berkeley, California, and overseas, from Oxford, England, to Beijing.
Research in many areas-the sciences, law, business, and what was once
called &quot;liberal arts&quot; but was now titled Other Important Stuff-thrived
with a stream of huge donations. Some heavy-hitters did not even
insist that their names be attached to new buildings, laboratories,
chairs, walkways, or bricks. This time, our fund-raisers wept in
appreciation.

With this level of success, however, came new and unexpected problems.
As Northeastern glided like a giant pedagogical battleship toward the
end of its second century, there came a sneak attack from the
employment sector. Our students, still sniffling through damp, cold,
and sometimes snowbound winters, were so well-trained and highly
motivated that drafting wars began. Large numbers of students were
tempted into accepting lucrative jobs in warm-weather climes without
completing their education. In what became a landmark meeting,
Northeastern officials consulted those of the National Football League
and National Basketball Association and then composed the Co-op
Compact, under which any job draft was prohibited before graduation.
Serendipitously, the meeting took place in a stadium, once called
Foxboro and now enclosed, that the university had acquired.
Northeastern, with 200,000-plus students, had become a formidable
national sports power and had long ago outgrown the stadiums and
arenas abandoned by several nearby institutions when they became so
outclassed that they dropped athletics entirely. Besides, the
Huntington Avenue monorail to Foxborough got fans to the games in less
time than it once had taken them to reach the Boston Garden, which was
restored in name from the FleetCenter, thankfully retiring a bad
bathroom joke.

Yet at the same time that these bold initiatives were unfolding on the
public stage, a completely discreet research project was also under
way. Eschewing the university's grand and futuristic laboratories and
classrooms, a few faculty members and students were conducting work in
the old YMCA. The year was 2095. Virtually no one knew or cared about
the tinkering. And why should they? Northeastern was enjoying its
status, accepting fewer than ten percent of those applying for
admission, attracting the most brilliant instructors, publishing
academic treatises that became best-sellers, watching with glee as the
endowment clicked into ten figures. The editor of the university
magazine fought with university brass over running a cover photo of
the benefactor who pushed the endowment into the billion-dollar column
presenting a giant check, and won.

Curiously, President Freeland, long since retired, had a role not only
in setting the mission of Northeastern but in selecting his successor
who would serve in 2098. It seems Freeland and his wife, Elsa Nuñez,
had many years earlier introduced a young man and a young woman from
two of the most incompatible families on the planet. But there is
never an accounting for love: a romance had blossomed like a fragrant
flower in the desert, and a family had eventually been established and
flourished. Northeastern's twelfth president, Dr. Arafat-Netanyahu,
never grew tired of telling the story of the family's genesis. And it
fell to Dr. Arafat-Netanyahu to plan the bicentennial and announce the
unexpected big news.

A symposium might sound like a dull little affair by N.U.'s standards
as a preeminent 200-year-old institution, but no one who attended left
as the same person and everyone in attendance became a part of
history. Northeastern invited leaders from the great and modest powers
of the world. Under the intense protection of the university's crack
security force, supplemented by the Boston Police Department, United
States Secret Service, and foreign defense specialists cackling in a
babel of quarrelsome tongues, the leaders met in the Opera House
across the street from the main quadrangle. (The Opera House had been
ingeniously rebuilt on air rights over the Marino Recreation Center.
Righteous protest over the demolition of the original Opera House
finally had borne fruit, and it tasted especially sweet after 140
years.)

There were the usual squabbles over which world representative was
more important than the next, and seating arrangements took a few days
to iron out, followed by the fixing of squealing sound systems, the
rounding up of all the requisite translators, and the dizzying
adjustments of menus to comply with religious and regional choices and
foibles. The caterer who delivered mu-shu pork to the Israeli,
Pakistani, and Iranian delegates was summarily dismissed without a
tip. The one who served all-beef patties to the Hindus in the hall
barely escaped the swipe of a scimitar, for even in those enlightened
times, food had the power to excite the stomach and provoke
intemperate behavior.

But when Dr. Arafat-Netanyahu rose and announced the simple, profound
meaning of the symposium, a miracle occurred. After a prolonged hush,
glorious pandemonium broke out. Shouts of jubilation and exaltation
reverberated across the Opera House. World leaders, who only recently
had threatened one another with the direst of deeds, rattling sabers
and issuing ultimatums, embraced. Some clung to one another,
resembling lovers reluctant to end an exquisite moment. Laughter and
sobs by the scores intermingled, creating a joyful din never before
heard on this Earth. The security forces were at first baffled, but
when they realized there was not a safer, happier place in the world
than the Northeastern Opera House, they laid down their weapons and
bandoliers and walkie-talkies and imitated their chiefs, shaking
hands, hugging their counterparts, shouting heartfelt, often
indecipherable words of praise and affection.

The university research project had been revealed. Working diligently,
unbeknownst to both the campus and the world outside it, N.U. students
and faculty had utilized research funds earmarked &quot;for the benefit of
mankind&quot; and, in the dingy confines of the old YMCA, had aimed to
finally master the secret of the common cold and end the sniffles-not
only for Northeastern students but for all mankind. In this quest,
they, like researchers before them, had failed. But the selfless years
of earnest effort brought an amazing and unexpected reward. Our team
had tripped over the remedy for a malady that had long plagued mankind-
every member of every society from the most pitifully indigent to the
most lavishly advantaged. Our team had discovered the cure for acid
indigestion.

&quot;Burp Heard 'Round the World&quot; read the headline in the next morning's
New York Times. The scrappy Boston Herald led with a Jamaica Plain
homemaker who had chased a cat burglar from her apartment, but also
squeezed the bicentennial news on page one. The Boston Globe, still
smarting from running too many fabricated accounts, initially missed
the story entirely because the editor didn't believe it. He instead
published a page-one piece comparing the salaries and perquisites of
Ivy League college presidents. But a Northeastern copy boy on co-op
saved the day by convincing the editor he'd be transferred to
Fitchburg if he didn't print the biggest story of the century.

Northeastern's naysayers experienced a heartburn that no medical
remedy could relieve. To be sure, no critic of N.U. ever again
delivered a glib and pompous denunciation. In fact, most of them
applied for positions.

Probably the most touching story of the day, aside from the news of
the peptic triumph, was a little sidebar on the inside pages of the
newspapers and the end of the holovision broadcasts. It referred to
Northeastern's mission established a century earlier. The words had
once sounded like something of a boast but now sounded so modest and
obvious: &quot;Northeastern is a national research university that is
student-centered, practice-oriented, and urban.&quot;
