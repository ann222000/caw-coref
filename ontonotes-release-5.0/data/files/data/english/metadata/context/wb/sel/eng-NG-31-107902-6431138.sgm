up , pushing the shiftere back every time I hear it pop out. :(

Have yout tried setting the park brake, placing it in nuetral and
jacking one front tire up to relieve any possible torque bind?

You can also spin the tires is reverse by goosing it to release the bind.

You are very lucky something didn't explode.  A friend literally blew
his T-case in pieces when he wound his up by driving on pavement in 4x4.

It is kinda of hard to spin the rear tires backing up in 4wd unless
you are on a slick surface.  SOmetimes you can run with one side of
vehicle off the road in the grass or gravel and that will unload it.

I have 'no' issues 'at all' burning rubber in 4x4 low in either Jeep on
dry roads.  Had to do it recently when I needed 4 low to get out of the
driveway, then hit the dry road.  The XJ bound up tight.

Somehow this is real funny to here when on one hand you say he is
lucky that the torque bind did not damage case when "burning" rubber
on drive pavement in 4wd (which you think is fine) places even more
stress on Tcase. (a lot more)

Fuck off man,  You implied Jeeps didn't have the power to spin the tires
on pavement in reverse low 4x4, I stated differently.

Stop cutting and pasting bullshit words out of context.

As I have said, I will call a spade a spade and I will not let you twist
my meanings no matter how much you hate 4x4.

Testy aren't we. I never implied that but I did imply that it does
provide a LOT of stress on drive train and your responce kinda shows
that it is ego more than logic that is motivating your comments on
this subject.
