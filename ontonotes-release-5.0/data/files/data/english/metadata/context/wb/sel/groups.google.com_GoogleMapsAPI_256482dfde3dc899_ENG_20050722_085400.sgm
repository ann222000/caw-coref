Let me preface by saying that I am not a programmer. I am a designer. I
have looked and searched the groups for all kinds of keywords (popup,
javascript, etc) to find the answer to this question and have come up
short. My question is:

How can I create a text menu above or below this map that allows my
customers to choose a name of a city if they are new to the area and
are not familiar with the physical location of the cities yet? When
they do so, the map should scroll to the area and open the popup window
with the locations information.

I know this may sound super-easy to many of you, but as a
nonprogrammer, I am at a loss right now. Thanks in advance.

regards,
Dave

I would try searching thr group for the keywords sidepanel and XSTL.
That should give you sufficient hits for what you're looking at doing.
I'm not sure if you could display that information in a popup, but you
would definitly be able to have a sidepanel or a panel on top or below
your map.
