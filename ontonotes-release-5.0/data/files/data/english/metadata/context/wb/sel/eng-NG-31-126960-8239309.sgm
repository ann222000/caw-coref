I'm happy; Terry was one of my favorites.

But then Hoff had to go and &quot;sing&quot; and ruin the evening.  OWWW!!!!  My
ears!!!!!!!!!!!

My scrotum crawled up into my pelvis when they announced that he was
going to sing &quot;This Is The Moment.&quot;  I saw him in 'Jelyll &amp; Hyde' on a
PBS special a couple of years ago, and the Hoff singing that song was
the lowlight of the show.

I could be wrong - but I don't recall them saying the final 4 were
being eliminated in any certain order; they/Jerry seemed to refer to
them simply as Top 4, Top 3, etc. allowing them IMO 'wiggle-room' by
not specifically stating, &quot;Julienne received the fourth highest number
of votes&quot;, or &quot;Cas received more votes than Butterscotch&quot;, etc, the
way Idol does.

AGT, with it's limited number of votes per phone/internet account,
shys away from voting specifics, other than, &quot;So and So is Safe&quot;, and
&quot;So and so is going home.&quot;

Yeah, I'm fine with Terry's win over Haley, but I sure would've liked
to see Cas take it, if only because I see his career path, as a chubby
white guy singing Rasta-Tunes, being a harder road to travel than that
of Fator, who as we all witnessed is already signed to a Vegas gig.

Good luck to'em both though - they seem like really nice guys
deserving of the opportunity they got.

Not necessarily.
Without specificity of actual votes, &quot;Our Top 3&quot; leaves the definition

So so so happy for Terry!   I had a bad feeling early on that Cas was going to
win.   They seem to be focussing on him more.
I don't even know how Butterscotch made it into the Top 4!   I just can't

I was wrong, no doubt about it. She faded in the last couple of weeks as
Terry came on strong.  Good for him.

Her fade cost her the votes of those who would vote for a kid as long as
they perceive them as being close to the best.  That's usually enough to
get a win.  Irwin will have a solid career ahead of her.

Butterscotch......Blake Lewis was better and has a better chance at a
real career.

Same here, Dave....I was really hoping Cas would win, and  voted
faithfully for him every week, as I  thought he was &quot;the all-American
guy&quot; and just so personable with a winning smile and a very unique
voice. He IS a 1st class entertainer, and I really think he will do just
fine.

When it came down to the final two, I had wanted it to be Cas Haley and
Terry Fator, and I knew I would be just as happy if Terry would
win...another really nice chap and one with REAL talent, so he is
deserving of the title , and I was happy to know he already is signed up
for a gig in Vegas. TC will have to go back and see his show, and then
come back on here and tell us all about it..how about it, TC?  :-)

Me too...even though I always voted for Cas, Terry was my 2nd

Yikes! that sounds pretty painful there, Zob! Something like that should
only happen if Giggles was nearby with that sharp knife she carries

Like Taylor Hicks, a better live entertainer than recording artist.
Who's really going to line up for his type of music at the record store

I don't really think it was so much that Juli 'faded', than we just
didn't see much 'growth' as an entertainer, which as talented as she
is, an audience really likes to see.
Even after a number of suggestions by the judges, she/her camp seemed
to insist on performing older, slower, more mature sounding material
which, as good as it was, was just too &quot;old&quot; for a 14yo little girl.
Even the Finale's tune, while I preferred Juli's vocals to Taylor
Swift's, was &quot;meh&quot; even following a ventriloquist with a singing frog
of all things.

I agree it was her's to lose.  You can't blame her material, she made
the choices in concert with her family.  I won't fault her because she
seems to have a very level head and didn't want to go teenage sleazy as
well.  The hard part was being 14.  She's really a tween and that's
difficult to pick a way to go that isn't too old or too slutty, in terms
of her personality, family and beliefs.  I do think she will have a good
career.  It might take a few years or someone like Cowell may step in
and give it a shot now.  Given that the winner was a non-singer, there's
definitely room for TPTB (Cowell) to also push a singer or two....if he
wants to do so.  Candidly, Cas is not Paul Potts and Irwin is not Leona
Lewis....although I think Irwin has much more potential that Cas, and
not just because of the age difference.

She may be one of the most interesting subway and street performers I've
ever seen in an evening gown.  As for the rest, I'll stand with Blake
having a better chance at a real career.

Just as the role of Queen Latifah has been filled with so many obese
women on AI.....the role of Norah Jones is still being filled by Norah
Jones.   Butterscotch is a very rough draft of her, IMHO.

60+ percent.  The eliminations paralleled the poll as well.  Can't
explain Butterscotch...she had no charisma or charm; I FF'ed through
all her performances this season.

Good for him, although it sure smells like a very short term booking but
it might also be a tryout.

You are, absolutely, correct fille.  I'm 100 percent for him if that's
going to fulfill him, or Taylor or anyone.

I'm coming from the perspective that the winner of shows like AGT and AI
really have to bring in big, large, bundles o' bucks in order to
validify the show and keep high ratings etc as well as the total
production machine (network, TPTB, show, etc.) all going well and
succeeding for a long time.  In &quot;that&quot; regard, a small venue performer
doing 150 nights a year on the road is a failure and only in that regard
but it has to matter in that bigger picture.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm sure that not everyone who entertains for a living
&gt; cares about being ultra famous, living in a huge mansion with tons of

&gt; pleased with that. I don't think all that fame and fortune is as
&gt; cracked up as it &quot;appears&quot; to be.

Everyone is an individual and I, largely, agree with you.  Few of us are
fortunate enough to have jobs and careers we love.  Even far fewer are
that much more fortunate to have jobs and careers we love that are
lucrative enough to financially change one's life.  Even if the million
does turn out to be $25,000. for 40 years as an annuity, Cas gave me
every indication that he wanted the cash as much as the win, perhaps
more.  Nothing wrong with that either, just my take.

BTW, if it is an annuity, I wonder if the winner would consider selling
it off on the secondary annuity market for the current value of the
total in today's dollars?

You could see her immaturity in the facial expressions she wore while

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; they'd be happy if Cas or Terry won.  I'm happy!

&gt;&gt; &gt; I was wrong, no doubt about it. She faded in the last couple of weeks as
&gt;&gt; &gt; Terry came on strong.  Good for him.

&gt;&gt; I don't really think it was so much that Juli 'faded', than we just
&gt;&gt; didn't see much 'growth' as an entertainer, which as talented as she
&gt;&gt; is, an audience really likes to see.

&gt;ok, I can see that as the other side of, pretty much, the same coin.

&gt;&gt; Even after a number of suggestions by the judges, she/her camp seemed
&gt;&gt; to insist on performing older, slower, more mature sounding material
&gt;&gt; which, as good as it was, was just too &quot;old&quot; for a 14yo little girl.

&gt;While she shouldn't have done Britney etc., I agree she should have gone
&gt;younger.  Heck, even &quot;A Moment Like This&quot; might have worked.  When I saw
&gt;her &quot;swinging&quot; on her second performance last week...it was over before
&gt;she started.

&gt;&gt; Even the Finale's tune, while I preferred Juli's vocals to Taylor
&gt;&gt; Swift's, was &quot;meh&quot; even following a ventriloquist with a singing frog
&gt;&gt; of all things.

&gt;I agree

I thought Taylor showed her up.   Of course, I preferred Kermit and Terry.

We agree on many things, Bob, but I think this is one of those issues
where we just see things differently -- and there's nothing wrong with
that!

The only similarities I see at all between Mandisa and Queen Latifah
are that they are both big black women. They have completely different
shapes (QL has a classic &quot;Mae West&quot; hourglass figure while Mandisa is
pear shaped) and they have vastly different vocal styles.  In fact,
Mandisa has her own unique sound.  Beyond her rapping, QL has a
remakably standard, mainstream voice that you would be hard put to
identify if you heard her singing on the radio.    I'll agree with you
though that some other AI contestants have evoked Jennifer Holiday --
even aside from the obvious one.

OTOH, some of us hope Potts will be the sand that destroys the Cowell
machine. The world does not need more crap masquerading as high art.
Give us the crap straight, like the High School Musical.

There is nothing wrong with popular (or populist) art nor is high art
inherently superior, but crap like Il Divo, Charlotte Church, and Sarah
Brightman is strictly for rubes who couldn't see the Emperor's winky.
I'd rather hear Della Reese sing Puccini, Elvis sing Martini, and the
Toys sing stuff ripped from the &quot;Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach.&quot;

Anyone for Donkeys competing in dressage?

One could make the same case about all the professional singers who
have been in the AI top 5 or 6 year after year.  Most of them, from
Melinda and Blake Lewis to Bo to Constantine to Clarkson to  just
about all of them.  There are a few unique exceptions such as
Underwood.   But I don't think that the fact that so many of the Idol
Finalists and winners had professional training and/or sang
professionally prior to AI detracted from the show very much.
