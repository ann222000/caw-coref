I have a 3800 watt generator with two 120 volt 15 amp outlets and a 120/240
volt 20 amp twist lock outlet. Can I use this 120/240 volt outlet somehow
with my 120 volt oil/hot water heater with a 100 feet of 12 gauge wire
running from the garage?

how many watts is the heater? sounds ok, provided its not too many
watts.

what other loads do you have?

ideally intall a transfer switch

Its a smaller furnace with one circulation pump so im not sure how many
watts it is. It does not say on the blower and there will not be any other
loads. I transfer switch install costs more then the generator so im going
the cheapo way.
How do I connect the 120/240 twist lock to the 120v furnace?

First, let's start with some proper terminology. Your house has oil-fired hot
water heat, right? What you have is not an &quot;oil/hot water heater&quot;, nor is it a
&quot;furnace&quot;. What you have is a boiler. Furnaces heat air. Boilers heat water.
(If you ever have to call for service, you want to make sure you use the right
terms. Boilers and their associated equipment are a bit more complicated than
furnaces or water heaters, and you don't want the service company to send out
a technician who knows furnaces backward and forward, but hasn't ever seen a
boiler.)

Now that we've got that out of the way, you want to know how to connect the
120/240 circuit to your 120V boiler (and presumably to your 120V circulating
pump as well).

In order to do this properly and safely, you need to have a 4-pin twist lock
receptacle (two hots, neutral, and ground). If you have only 3 pins (two hots,
ground, and no neutral) then you can't use that outlet. Remainder of my post
assumes you have 4 pins.

You'll need to make up your own extension cord for this, using a compatible
twist-lock plug purchased at a hardware or electrical supply store. The other
end, you can hardwire directly to the boiler controls -- but disconnect the
boiler from the house wiring system first, so you're not backfeeding the
breaker panel. Use an extension cord with three conductors, black, white, and
green. Connect as follows:
- green wire to bare wire(s) at boiler, to green screw on plug
- white wire to white wire(s) at boiler, to silver-colored screw on plug
- black wire to black wire(s) at boiler, to *either* of the two brass screws
on the plug (the two brass screws on a 240V plug correspond to the two hot
legs; it doesn't matter which one you use)

That furnace doesn't use 240V does it?  If it doesn't, you don't use
the 120/240V twistlock for it.  You use one of the 120V receptacles.

Presuming that the furnace runs on &lt; 12A (a single 120V 15A circuit
under normal conditions), you may be okay.  However, the blower
startup may noticably load the generator causing significant light
dimming.  In fact, it may stall/brownout the generator or even
damage the furnace.

Remember that motors (blower and pump) have significant start up
current surge.  Meanwhile, the max continuous amps you can draw
from the generator is 15A (3800W is 15A at 240V, OR 15A on _each_
of the two 120V legs).  You generally prefer to have the generator's
surge rating to be double or triple the continuous draw of the motor.
Which, if the blower is 10A, means you need 20A or 30A surge.  You
probably have 20A.  Barely.  Not 30A surge.

We don't know the amp draw requirements of the furnace blower or
pump.  It's going to be very close.

Most generators have 4 pin plugs now.  They're intended to drive
240V/120V circuits - up to and including transfer switches.

A modern standard oil furnace unit will have all of its internals on a
single 120V circuit.  In order to make use of the second leg of
a 120V/240V circuit, you'd have to rewire the guts of the furnace.
And probably unrewire them when you took it off the generator.

Not a good idea.

I noticed the two 120V plugs both have small reset buttons on them. I think
they are called GFI buttons. I was worried that when the blower kicks in it
could trip. The guy that sold me the generator powered the same furnace that
I have so I should be ok. I guess I'll find out soon.

I would use a clamp on ampmeter to check current draw, then add 30%
for motor start up.

is the furnace/ boiler on its own breaker exclusively? what amp is
that breaker?

I would wire the unit to plug. then plug unit in line for normal
operation or generator for emergencies.

give some thought to extension cords, they can be trip hazards and
having a door open in freezing weather with risk of exhaust gas
getting back into home.

better to install a outdoor outlet designed for generators anti shock

You heat water, then you have a boiler not a furnace, and a pump not a
blower. The pump may take only 150w and the Boiler only 20-50. Use a
clamp on amp meter to know draw and see pump surge which may be 6x run
power. You will waste alot of money using a gen to only generate a few
hundred watts to heat your home which will need alot of run time. Many
cheap gen motors only last 3-350 hours that might only be a few months
for you. Also check output of the gen at idle and under load and
recheck it every few days, as you could ruin your boiler as well as
the gen. City power will be alot cheaper.

There is an on/off box above the furnace with a 20 amp fuse in it. It looks
like the blower and pump run to a small box on the furnace with just one
power cable coming from it. This one cable goes up to the on/off box with
the 20 amp fuse.

It sounds like the way to go is to cut the cable and insert a 20 amp
male/female standard 120v plug. When the power goes out, unplug the furnace
from the AC and plug it into the generator.

Its not the most elegant solution but I'll only need it once a year or so.
Im in Canada so it will keep the pipes from freezing up in winter.

&gt;&gt; 120/240 circuit to your 120V boiler (and presumably to your 120V circulating
&gt;&gt; pump as well).

&gt;&gt; In order to do this properly and safely, you need to have a 4-pin twist lock
&gt;&gt; receptacle (two hots, neutral, and ground). If you have only 3 pins (two
&gt; hots,
&gt;&gt; ground, and no neutral) then you can't use that outlet. Remainder of my post
&gt;&gt; assumes you have 4 pins.

&gt;Most generators have 4 pin plugs now.  They're intended to drive
&gt;240V/120V circuits - up to and including transfer switches.

Fine -- if he said that he has a *new* generator, I missed it. I figured it
was possible that he didn't, and wanted to address that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;A modern standard oil furnace unit will have all of its internals on a

That's fine. I told him how to wire a single 120V circuit from a 240V
four-wire source. Where's the problem?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In order to make use of the second leg of
&gt;a 120V/240V circuit, you'd have to rewire the guts of the furnace.
&gt;And probably unrewire them when you took it off the generator.

&gt;Not a good idea.
">

Of course not. But nobody ever suggested using both legs, either. He wanted to
know how he could run his 120V boiler off of a 240V circuit -- and I told him
how, using *half* of that circuit. (Maybe you ought to read my post again, a
bit more closely on the second time around?)

&gt;&gt; Its a smaller furnace with one circulation pump so im not sure how many

&gt;&gt; loads. I transfer switch install costs more then the generator so im going
&gt;&gt; the cheapo way.
&gt;&gt; How do I connect the 120/240 twist lock to the 120v furnace?

&gt;That furnace doesn't use 240V does it?  If it doesn't, you don't use
&gt;the 120/240V twistlock for it.  You use one of the 120V receptacles.
">

He doesn't *have* to use one of the 120V receptacles. It's perfectly possible,
and safe, to derive a 120V circuit from the 120/240 receptacle, which is what
he asked about, and what I told him how to do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Presuming that the furnace runs on &lt; 12A (a single 120V 15A circuit
&gt;under normal conditions), you may be okay.  However, the blower
&gt;startup may noticably load the generator causing significant light
&gt;dimming.  In fact, it may stall/brownout the generator or even
&gt;damage the furnace.
">

If he has hot water heat, he doesn't have a furnace blower. These dire
predictions just aren't even remotely close to reality for a hot-water system.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Remember that motors (blower and pump) have significant start up
&gt;current surge.
">

Significant in comparison to their running current, yes. Significant in
comparison to a 15A breaker, a circulator pump is not even close. Circulator
pumps in residential hydronic systems use fractional-HP motors, typically 1/6
HP or less.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Meanwhile, the max continuous amps you can draw
&gt;from the generator is 15A (3800W is 15A at 240V, OR 15A on _each_
&gt;of the two 120V legs).  You generally prefer to have the generator's
&gt;surge rating to be double or triple the continuous draw of the motor.
&gt;Which, if the blower is 10A, means you need 20A or 30A surge.
">

But he doesn't have a blower. He has a circulator. And it isn't going to draw
anywhere near 10A running -- probably won't even get close to 10A on startup
surge. My hydronic system is running *four* circulators, plus all the
circulator switching controls, plus the boiler controls and ignition, plus the
boiler fan-forced flue, all on a single 15A 120V circuit. We've been in this
house eight years. Never tripped that breaker, not even when switching the
system on for the first time each fall when the boiler and _all_four_
circulators kick on _simultaneously_.

This just isn't an issue with residential hot water systems.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;You
&gt;probably have 20A.  Barely.  Not 30A surge.

&gt;We don't know the amp draw requirements of the furnace blower or
&gt;pump.  It's going to be very close.

No, it won't. He's perfectly fine.

According to miker &lt;mike_ ... @hotmail.com&gt;:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There is an on/off box above the furnace with a 20 amp fuse in it. It looks
&gt; like the blower and pump run to a small box on the furnace with just one
&gt; power cable coming from it. This one cable goes up to the on/off box with
&gt; the 20 amp fuse.
">

Does the circuit feeding the fuse box have a breaker or fuse on
it at the panel?  Is it 15A or 20A?  If the smallest breaker/fuse
on the circuit is 20A, you're going to have a problem.

The generator is only rated for 15A continuous at 120V.  And you're
not supposed to run 20A thru a ordinary 120V receptacle outlet.  If
it needs &gt;15A, on AC power, you will be overstressing the outlet.
When on generator, you'll be overstressing the generator (and
there's no head room for surge) too.

Check the amp ratings _on_ the furnace.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It sounds like the way to go is to cut the cable and insert a 20 amp
&gt; male/female standard 120v plug. When the power goes out, unplug the furnace
&gt; from the AC and plug it into the generator.

&gt; Its not the most elegant solution but I'll only need it once a year or so.
&gt; Im in Canada so it will keep the pipes from freezing up in winter.
">

It's not strictly legal, but in case of emergencies...

Use heavy duty (eg: SO or SOW) flexible stranded cord at least 12ga
for the cable from the furnace and a heavy-duty plug and receptacle.
Eg: Hubbel &quot;spec grade&quot; devices.  It really should be a locking
receptacle, but that won't match the 120V outlets on the generator.

You could get it to use _half_ of the 240V/120V receptacle, so
you can use a matching locking receptacle.  But that will have
a dead leg on it, unless you turn this cable into a &quot;Y&quot; and
feed other things from it.

We saw a lot worse during the ice storm.

Methinks I shoulda.  Now that my suggestion has come around to the

In industrial situations, Canadian codes aren't very anal about
making the outlet match the circuit (in voltage) as long as (a)
the outlet has sufficient amps, and (b) that pattern is used
_only_ for that voltage within a building.  Or at least it used

Using the 120 regular plug will work but you need to know what it
draws, you keep mentioning blower. I imagine your 3800w unit is rated
near 2-2500 continous so it should do fine,, is this a 350 $ chinese

No, it's not. It's an oil-fired *boiler*. You do not have a furnace.

Like I said... the distinction is important whenever you're calling for
service (or posting repair questions on Usenet). Boilers and their associated
equipment are very different from, and more complicated than, furnaces. The
world is full of (apparently) competent furnace techs who don't know their
arses from their elbows when it comes to boilers. And if you need to call a
local HVAC outfit for service on your system, you'd better tell them you have
a boiler, so they send out a *boiler* tech.

Correction: he *might* have a problem, *if* the system draws more than 15A.
Considering that it's a hydronic system, though, this is vanishingly unlikely:
they just don't use all that much power.

He doesn't *have* a furnace. He has a boiler. Hydronic systems don't have
anywhere near the power requirements of forced-air furnaces. It just doesn't
take much power at all to keep the water circulating.
