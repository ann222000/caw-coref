"Two Lebanese shepherds and 100 sheep on Thursday crossed the Blue Line into Israel [...] the U.N. said in a statement.

"Such incidents can endanger (a) very fragile and tense situation," it said.

Last week the Israeli Yediot Aharonot daily reported that dozens of hungry cows whose pasture land in northern Israel were reduced to ashes by Hizbullah rockets found a hole in the border fence and moved to Lebanon for healthier grazing. [...]

After Monday's ceasefire, there were no reports that cows were still crossing Israeli territory into southern Lebanon."

OMG .. they have nothing else to worry except about cows who graze on the "wrong" side of the boarder???
Weird ... if cows cross into Lebanon, is's not worth mentioning .. but if Lebanese sheep come grazing into Israel, it's an incident which "can endanger a very fragile and tense situation"!
Hmmmm, I am afraid I must have missed something here ..

I read one news story where Israel blew up a chicken coop. Of course it is well known fact that chickens are the leaders among the world's terrorists. They spread their terrorism droppings around on the ground. They even reproduce, creating more terrorist chickens.

The IDF captured one terrorist chicken an interrogated the chicken. The IDF was unable to translate the chicken's language and assumed it must be a terrorist code calling for more attacks on Israel.

Hezbollah asked the IDF to release the chicken, saying the chicken ment no harm to Israel. The IDF has refused to release the chicken. An IDF spokesperson was quoted as saying, "We are going to get to the bottom of this fowl mess if we have bomb every chicken coop in the Middle East.

This story is completely untrue. The name of the chicken was changed to protect the innocent.
