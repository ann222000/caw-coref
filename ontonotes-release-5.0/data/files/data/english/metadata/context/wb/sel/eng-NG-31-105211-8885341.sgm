Welcome to Waterworld

Welcome to a special edition of Nobel Intent. Beyond keeping you familiar
with the comings and goings of modern science, we have consistently
expressed concern regarding science education and the public understanding
of science. Key to that understanding are the basic features of science,
such as how scientific concepts are formulated and tested and why they
typically produce a better understanding of the natural world than
alternative approaches.

But science can be a tricky thing to define, and it's sometimes easier to
contrast it with some of the arguments that pose as science. Unfortunately,
most of those issues are entangled with implications that keep the basic
question—is this science?—obscured by emotional responses. Thus, the science
of climatology has become entwined with political, economic, and policy
issues. The science of evolution conflicts with the political and religious
goals of some individuals. Even basic scientific questions about the nervous
system get embroiled in family and personal health issues when topics like
autism and radio frequency radiation are broached.

That's why a special edition of the journal Homeopathy appears to be a gift,
allowing us to look at science and psuedoscience without getting entangled
with politics and religion. Homeopathy claims to be a form of medical
practice that's based on the principle that &quot;like cures like.&quot; Given a set
of symptoms, a homeopath will identify an herb or chemical that causes
similar symptoms. Following a predefined ritual, the homeopath performs a
series of dilutions of that chemical that continue well beyond the point
where there should be no molecules of it left—the final solution is
essentially well-shaken water.

Giving patients water is probably a lot less harmful than many folk remedies
that fly under the scientific radar, but homeopathy has two notable
distinctions. One is that people spend a lot of money on it—the US market
was already close to half a billion dollars in 1999. The second is that
homeopaths have demanded that their field be treated as a science,
performing clinical studies, proposing mechanisms, and even convincing
Elsevier to publish Homeopathy, a peer-reviewed journal.

The articles in this special edition of Homeopathy display a number of
consistent themes: internal inconsistency; a rejection of scientific
standards and methods; and established science is applied to inappropriate
situations (for example, quantum entanglement between people is proposed).
In cases where mechanisms are suggested, they frequently violate our basic
understanding of the natural world. Tying things together are unsupported
assertions and logical leaps that have no place in science. The experience
of reading the journal was like seeing a science publication reflected
through Alice's looking glass.

By criticizing homeopathy, we hope to illuminate the general distinctions
between science and pseudoscience. Hopefully, in finding a topic that's
largely free of baggage, we'll help provide a broader picture of what makes
science distinct from fields that feign scientific legitimacy.

Suppression of water memory

Most special editions start with an editor's comment; this is no exception.
Homeopathy's editor acknowledges that the most widely held theory for
homeopathic action involves the placebo effect. However, he also claims that
there is a growing body of evidence for the efficacy of homeopathy, so water
memory should be further investigated. He makes a bold claim regarding what
the results will be: &quot;There is much work to be done, but at this stage we
can say one thing with certainty: the assertion that homeopathy is
impossible because the 'memory of water' is impossible is wrong.&quot;

The memory of water

Does the rest of this issue bear out this statement? The second article,
entitled &quot;The memory of water: an overview,&quot; acts as an introduction. The
implication of this title is that we should be able to get a good feel for
the state of the field, where it is heading, and what challenges remain.

The author, Martin F. Chaplin, writes with the assumption that the existence
of water memory is obvious. But Chaplin never gives a definition of the
&quot;water memory effect.&quot; As one reads the article, it becomes clear that any
behavior of water that is non-obvious is &quot;water memory.&quot; This allows Chaplin
to present a mix of trivia as if it formed a coherent body of scientific
evidence. Oddly, whenever any of these behaviors must be described, Chaplin
presents an analogy. We have never seen analogy used in scientific writing
as a replacement for a direct, formal argument.

The role of water memory in homeopathy could be demonstrated in two ways:
physical measurement of some structure that was imposed upon water by the
active ingredient or by the demonstrated efficacy of the diluted solution.
Chaplin would, apparently, disagree:

&quot;Editorial comment in the scientific press has subsequently drawn on whether
water can indeed show any 'memory' of its prior history as direct 'proof' of
whether homeopathy can be successful or not. Such linkage is quite
unnecessary and may easily mislead as the two areas utilize fundamentally
differing and entirely independent evidence and should therefore be
considered separately.&quot;

In a certain sense this is true; consistent observations for the efficacy of
homeopathy can and would stand alone. However, no such body of evidence
appears in this issue, which shifts the burden to evidence for the memory of
water. Water memory claims violate several deeply held physical principles
that are backed by a great deal of evidence, so proof of the failure of
these principles should require solid data. Instead, we are subjected to
increasingly wild and far-fetched proposals that, in the absence of direct
evidence, must be investigated as a substitute. Chaplin bristles at the fact
that these proposals have not been well received by the scientific
community, and he suggests that science's high standards for overturning
established principles have &quot;resulted in the slow uptake of new ideas and
the overly long retention of fallacious concepts.&quot;

Let's consider science's track record in this regard. Quantum mechanics,
special, and general relativity spring to mind as examples of radical new
ideas. They went from new hypotheses to accepted theories in less than the
working lifetime of the scientists involved. RNA splicing and interference
were radical at the time yet were quickly accepted on the basis of solid
evidence. This should tell you something about both science and this author.

Water's selective memory

Water memory supposedly only remembers what a homeopath wants it to.

Chaplin also addresses a key question: if water can retain a memory of a
vanished substance, why isn't all water pharmaceutically active? He
responds, &quot;I do not dispute this argument, but it is of no relevance to the
state of known samples of liquid water, where the history concerns just the
sample and is not the sum of the individual memories of all the molecules
since the beginning of time (indeed individual H2O molecules only have
lifetimes of fractions of a second).&quot; How Chaplin reconciles this view with
the fact that homeopathy's use of serial dilutions should constantly be
changing that history is never explained.

Chaplin then moves away from memory and into structure. His claim is that
the active ingredient structures the water, and that structure is somehow
retained during dilution. One of the main references cited is a light
scattering study on samples of water containing various chemical compounds,
all of which aggregate into large-scale domains over the period of several
hours, days, or even months. Sounds like evidence, right? Well, yes, except
that the concentrations studied are between six and ten percent; this leaves
a large gap between these studies and anything related to homeopathy.
The persistence of the memory of water

In the end, water memory and water structure, according to the evidence
presented by Chaplin, are anything but self-evident. This seems to weigh on
Chaplin's mind, but instead of strengthening these arguments, he simply
proposes other potential ways in which homeopathy might work. He moves on to
look at ways in which the active ingredient (or some other random stuff)
might be in the final &quot;medicinal product.&quot; These take the form of, for
example: silica from the glass, residual material on the glass surface, and
(our favorite) aerosol matter. &quot;Although not often recognized, except by
microbiologists, such shaking can also produce aerosols saturating the
laboratory atmosphere for extended periods and offering a route for the
contamination of later dilutions,&quot; he writes.

This is true, but the question to ask is: did the homeopath wear gloves and
a mask? Because if they didn't, that water probably contains more stuff from
the homeopath's breath than any active ingredient—not a confidence-inspiring
thought. It is truly remarkable that Chaplin considers these additions to be
possible explanations for water memory, in part because they obviate the
need for any of his prior explanations.

In the end, this overview provides a clear demonstration of tactics used by
many practitioners of pseudoscience: make a large number of vaguely
scientific arguments in the hope of making the desired conclusion seem
inevitable. It is essential to recognize that a disconnected assemblage of
weak arguments does not create a single, strong scientific argument.

Water memory's forgettable history

Next on the list is &quot;The history of the memory of water&quot; by Yolène Thomas,
which begins with a recounting of some of the original work done by Jacques
Benveniste, descends into a diatribe against Nature for not supporting it,
then finally describes Thomas' current experiments on something she terms
&quot;digital biology.&quot;

Benveniste brought water memory to wide attention by using it as an
explanation for results he reported in Nature: extreme dilutions of a
histamine-containing solution (where no histamine was present) still induced
a response in tests for allergic reactions. Nature, expressing disbelief,
agreed to publish the results provided that they could send an investigative
team to verify that (a) there was no fraud and (b) the experimental
procedure was rigorous.

The team discovered that no fraud had occurred, but the lab's analysis
procedures led to a common statistical error that induced false positives
during individual tests. Benveniste's team had ignored long runs of negative
results, introducing a strong selection bias over time. Under more rigorous
experimental conditions introduced by the investigative team, only null
results were produced.
Water memory ignores the past

A scientific response to the Nature setback might involve repeated tests
under appropriately rigorous conditions. But Thomas doesn't acknowledge that
the original experiments were flawed and suggests that the Nature team
simply asserted fraud. &quot;Three of the four labs involved in the trial
reported statistically significant inhibition of the basophil degranulation
reaction by HD of histamine as compared to the controls. The fourth lab gave
a result that was almost significant.&quot;

This is not very encouraging, since a result that was almost but not quite
statistically significant is, in fact, insignificant. The article doesn't
address any of the specific deficiencies described by the Nature team, so we
cannot tell if the methodology of more recent experiments is improved. The
newer results have been published in peer-reviewed journals (and not only
specialist homeopathy journals), so the scientific establishment is not
preventing researchers from getting their results out, contrary to one of
the themes mentioned by Chapman.

According to one paper, appropriately patterned sound can induce a memory to
form in water.

Thomas claims recent research shows that recordings of white noise that has
passed through a sample with the active ingredient can induce activity when
broadcast at a sample of water. Unfortunately, Thomas chose incredibly
complicated tests of activity using live animals, opening the door to
artifactual results. A more reasonable approach has been suggested here.

It is pretty clear that Thomas and his coworkers still do not understand
science very well, as results are reported in terms of success or failure.
Experiments do not succeed or fail; they either report results in agreement
or disagreement with your hypothesis, or, in the case of a badly-designed
experiment, randomly oscillate between agreement and disagreement. The
following quote gives a pretty good clue about which of these categories the
experiment Thomas is running fits into: &quot;More surprising and mysterious was
the fact that in some cases certain individuals (not claiming special
talents) consistently get digital effects and other individuals get no
effects or perhaps block those effects (particularly when handling a tube
containing informed water).&quot;

Spooky action at a distance in the non-quantum world

Next, we move into quantum mechanics. Could water memory possibly be a form
of entanglement? Lionel Milgrom seems to think so. But this doesn't appear
to be quantum mechanics as we know it. &quot;It is as if at a deep level,
everything in the universe is instantaneously linked together in a vast
holistic matter-energy network of interacting fields which transcends
ordinary concepts of space and time,&quot; Milgrom says. &quot;And we, composed of
trillions of particles are an inseparable part of it: far from what reason
seems to tell us.&quot;

Homeopathy via entanglement of the practitioner, remedy, and patient. Too
bad none of them are quantum objects.

This is a serious misuse of scientific terms; &quot;quantum mechanics,&quot;
&quot;entanglement,&quot; and &quot;coherence&quot; do not imply anything of the sort. The
amount of time particles remain entangled is reduced by every interaction
with other particles. As a result, at any particular moment, most particles
in the universe are not entangled with anything.

Milgrom next introduces some of the properties of water, also using the
unusual method of analogy rather than actual description. He asserts that
the preservation of structure in liquid water is only a small stretch beyond
our present understanding of the transient structures formed by water
molecules. But these structures have a lifetime on the order of a few
picoseconds; something new to our understanding would be required for them
to last for seconds, much less the months homeopathic remedies are stored.
Milgrom proposes that the information is not actually carried by a structure
of water molecules but is an emergent behavior of the whole. Exactly what
emerges and how it emerges are, apparently, left as an exercise for the
reader.

Entangling thermodynamics

Milgrom at least recognizes that emergent behavior in room temperature water
is problematic in that emergent behavior occurs only in systems with
nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The paper does not say what the thermodynamic
system is or what is out of equilibrium, but it's asserted that a quantum
description of the quantum critical points of an apparently classical system
can explain the efficacy of homeopathy. At this point, we would expect to be
introduced to the details of exactly where the quantum behavior manifests
itself and how mixing and diluting changes that behavior. Instead, Milgrom
performs a bait-and-switch by talking about superconductors and superfluids.

In the end, the quantum mechanical explanation for water memory appears to
boil down to this: the Joe who diagnoses the illness and mixes the medicine
becomes, through observation, entangled with it. The Jane who is ill
becomes, through talking to Joe, entangled with him and, by drinking the
mixture, is also entangled with the mixture. This entangled state allows the
active ingredient to transfer its activeness to the patient. Apart from
misunderstanding what constitutes an observer, Milgrom also misuses the
concepts of entanglement and wave function collapse to create a system that
sounds scientific but has absolutely no basis in the field where these
scientific terms apply.

Conveniently, this abuse of physics doubles as an explanation for the
apparent non-efficacy of homeopathic remedies. Apparently, these ideas
&quot;provide a rationale for why RCTs (Randomized Controlled Trials) of
homeopathy often return equivocal results. It suggests the double blind RCT
'collapses' the three-way patient–practitioner–remedy entangled state in a
way analogous to that by which observation collapses a particle's wave
function in the Copenhagen Interpretation of orthodox quantum theory.&quot; In
other words, the efficacy of homeopathy relies on us all averting our gazes.

Dilution without loss

After the dilution of a mixture, pounding the resulting
solution on a table somehow re-establishes its memory.

Two additional papers discuss the process of dilution-succussion cycles.
Homeopathic remedies are created by starting with a mother tincture (MT);
this starting material is then diluted by adding some of its volume to a
larger volume of solvent. Each dilution step is followed by succussion
strokes, where the container holding the mixture is struck against a hard
object a set number of times. The newly succussed mixture may be re-diluted
and re-succussed many times over before being given to patients.

The first paper in this set presents a mathematical model of these
succussion-dilution cycles. Typically, scientific models of this sort are
based on the well-understood properties of the substance being modeled. What
David Anick models is a &quot;(hypothetical) persistent structural feature in
what is chemically pure water,&quot; a species he terms an &quot;active ingredient.&quot;
The term &quot;hypothetical&quot; seems like an understatement, given that water is
well studied, and there is no evidence that stable structures exist in a
vial of reasonably pure water at room temperature and pressure.

Anick then seeks to model the concentration of these structures over the
course of successive succussion-dilution cycles. He manages to model the
dilution properly but invents his own physics to allow structures to
spontaneously form during succussion. Chemistry and thermodynamics are
pretty clear that this isn't possible. No molecules come for free after a
banging against a hard surface.

Dr. Anick applies this questionable model to a variety of situations before
ending on a point I agree with. &quot;The model may not apply... if remedies are
ultimately proved to be mere placebos or markers that support the ritual of
healer-client interaction. The great weakness of the model is that it is
inspired solely by clinical conventions with no direct experimental
support.&quot; Here, for once, he is guilty of understatement, given that there
are experimental indications that many of his assumptions are invalid.

It's all in the glass

In the second paper, Anick evaluates silica derived from glass containers as
a possible basis of homeopathy, suggesting that there are three things
needed for the acceptance of this idea. The first challenge is to &quot;describe
thermodynamically stable parameter(s) that not only show how remedies might
differ from controls, but also how thousands of remedies can all be
different from each other.&quot; The second challenge relates to what exactly
happens during a dilution-succussion cycle. He phrases it this way:
&quot;Whatever pattern or information is in a remedy, it must somehow 'survive'
being mixed into 99 parts of water, and then 'convert' the whole sample to
that same pattern (or a slightly different pattern) when the whole is
succussed.&quot; The third and final challenge is how water becomes altered by
the original solute in the first place.

Water's memory might be based on silica, too. In contrast to electronics,
nobody can say how it got there.

The paper offers a &quot;silica hypothesis,&quot; suggesting that &quot;vial-derived
silicates [could] be the long-sought active ingredients in remedies.&quot; The
hypothesis states that complex silicate structures can form during
succussion strokes and that such structures may be able to answer the three
challenges laid out above. The paper states that determining how such
structures may be biologically active is beyond the scope of its work.

The problem is that glass exists as a near infinite network of chemically
bonded Si(O1/2)4—there is no free SiO2 to dissolve. Despite this, the
authors suggest that vials will typically contain a saturated or
supersaturated solution of Si(OH)4 monomer after the SiO2 in the vial
dissolves.
Contrafactual assertions

Undeterred, the authors take on the task of describing how solute molecules
could seed silicate structures. They correctly note that organic molecules
can be used as templates for patterning silica structures. Since many
initial homeopathic solutions contain organic matter, some of those
molecules may act in this manner. When an organic molecule is used as a
template in the real world, however, it becomes trapped inside the newly
formed silica structure and cannot be used to template another one. The
authors merely state that this doesn't apply to homeopathic solutions.

If we ignore this bit of science-by-fiat, there is still the second
question: how does this work when the solution is diluted to the point where
no template molecules are left? The authors suggest that previously formed
silicates are able to replicate themselves and propose four methods for how
this can happen. I must be blunt here: none of the four have any basis in
reality.

Viewing experimental noise as signal

The entire issue was not composed only of reviews and polemics; a number of
papers purported to provide experimental evidence of water memory. These
studies suffer from a variety of flaws, but the clear message they send is
that it's possible to perform experiments without employing scientific
methodology.

First up is a paper entitled &quot;The 'Memory of Water': an almost deciphered
enigma. Dissipative structures in extremely dilute aqueous solutions.&quot; The
paper seeks to demonstrate and explain the memory of water via various
measurements of homeopathic solutions. However, it also clearly states in
the methods section:

&quot;It is important to emphasize that, from the studies so far conducted,
we cannot derive reproducible information concerning the influence of the
different degrees of homeopathic dilution or the nature of the active
principle (solute) on the measured physicochemical parameters.&quot;

The body of the paper describes a collection of experimental anecdote and
artifact. A few graphs purport to show that the longer you leave a
homeopathic solution, the stronger it becomes. Without so much as an error
bar or any statistics and with the prior admission of no reproducibility,
you could describe us as more than a little skeptical. We will at least give
the authors points for maintaining a measure of scientific objectivity,
since they acknowledge that impurities in the glassware used to prepare
their solutions make up a significant part of their findings. How they
square this with the previous articles that claim dissolved silicates are in
fact responsible for the homoepathic effect is unknown. About the only
take-home message that can be gathered from this article is that if you look
hard enough for information that supports your desired conclusion, you too
can find what looks like a signal in background noise.

Experiments without an experimental method

We continue with a paper entitled &quot;Can low-temperature thermoluminescence
cast light on the nature of ultra-high dilutions?&quot; It states, &quot;Our research
objective has been to try to demonstrate that the high dilutions are
physically different from the diluent and have, indeed, an 'individual
personality'.&quot; This sums up the general approach of homeopaths to research:
they are not out to investigate the properties of a system but rather to
show that a system has the needed properties to justify their pre-ordained
conclusions. This speaks volumes about their approach to science as a
vehicle for respectability rather than as an investigative tool.

The author, Louis Rey, is investigating the defect structure of ice, an
interesting topic. Homeopathic samples are frozen based on the untested
assumption that the resulting ice will retain the structure imparted to the
water. The frozen sample is then irradiated with high-energy photons (X-rays
or similar). This removes some electrons from their normal, bound states,
and they accumulate at defects in the ice. As the ice is reheated, the
electrons overcome the energy barrier necessary for them to return to their
bound state and release energy in the form of light as they do so. By
monitoring the temperature and intensity at which the light is emitted, one
can infer some information about the defect structure of the ice. Similar
studies can be performed using more accurate methods, but we should
emphasize that this technique is sound.

Memories might be locked in place by ice, but you can't tell with this data.

For whatever reason, Rey uses NaCl (table salt) or LiCl dissolved in heavy
water. But the starting concentration is never given, so we only have a
relative scale and never know when the last of the salt is gone. His
experiments on &quot;high&quot; concentrations of salt (1/300 through 1/900 of the
initial concentration) show a light peak that increases with decreasing
dilution; the peak shifts to slightly lower temperatures at low
concentrations. This is just crying out for analysis, but none is
forthcoming. It isn't compared with a control, so we have no way to confirm
that the active ingredient is influencing the results. The scale on the
graph that shows the intensity of the emission is not clearly defined, and
we are never offered a way to compare one graph to another.

It gets worse. In the first graph, all the data is LiCl, and the ice is
irradiated with an electron beam. The second data set uses gamma rays and
water that contained different materials. Clearly, no comparison can be made
between the graphs and, in some cases, between traces on the same graph.
This alone means that we cannot accurately determine if the data are
different—no effect, present or otherwise, can be determined.

The experimental approach here highlights the contrast with science even
more than the review papers. The experiments were designed to reach a
specific conclusion, and standard scientific practices like controls and
data normalization could be discarded en route to that goal.

Unexpected data produces logical leaps

Another data paper was entitled &quot;Long term structural effects in water:
autothixotropy of water and its hysteresis.&quot; The paper is written by two
physicists who have been exploring anomalous results in a specific
experimental system since the 1970s. The system involves a thin, flexible
filament that is used to suspend a metal plate that is immersed in a covered
container of water. Although none of these results appear to have been
published, you can get a feel for them from a paper in the arXiv.

If water were an ideal, frictionless fluid, twisting the filament should
create a stress that is immediately translated into rotational motion of the
plate below it. In their hands, it does not, and not all of their
observations can be explained via the differences between static and dynamic
friction. This isn't a surprise; anyone who has suffered through a high
school physics lab realizes that reality generally deviates from the ideal.
The typical response by scientists is to try to identify any source(s) of
the experimental error and eliminate or control for them.

These researchers have not chosen to go this route. Instead, they have given
the deviation a name (&quot;autothixotropy&quot;), characterized the ways that the
system differs from expectations, and concluded that it must result from a
previously unrecognized property of water.

Autothixotropy's key feature is that as the filament is rotated, plates
submerged in water do not rotate immediately; instead, tension builds until
the plate rotates suddenly. The resistance to the rotation increases with
the amount of time the water has been left undisturbed and increases even
more if the plate is only partially submerged. Resistance also increases if
the water has been boiled and disappears entirely if the water is deionized.
If still water is stirred, resistance vanishes but re-establishes itself
more quickly than in freshly boiled water.

Jumping to unjustified conclusions

Collectively, the NI staff can think of a half-dozen potential sources of at
least some of these phenomena. And we're quite sure that the following
wouldn't have been among them: &quot;In terms of explanation, a hypothesis based
on 'ephemeral polymerisation' of water seems plausible.&quot;

The paper is an odd mix of experimental results and implications that are
normally put in the discussion. It also includes the first &quot;moral lesson&quot;
we've ever seen in a scientific paper.

Moral: If two different observations seem to be mutually incompatible
within the frame of an established theory, the most probable explanation is
not that one of the observations is wrong, but that the theory is wrong or
at least incomplete, and that the observations merely discovered that it was
not self-consisrent [sic].

They're right in the sense that all theories are incomplete, but I'd just
add that not all puzzling data is an indication that a given theory is
incomplete.

When the discussion arrives, there's no justification of the authors'
conclusion that these phenomena point to the existence of complex structures
in water, nor is there any contemplation of alternative explanations.
Instead, the focus is on additional properties of the clusters that are now
assumed to exist. It's as if the authors felt that logically connecting A to
B wasn't needed and they could jump straight to Q.

The very last sentence of the paper is the closest thing to science in the
entire piece. The authors suggest that, &quot;From comparison of experiments with
natural distilled water and deionizated distilled water it is possible to
deduce that the cause of macroscopic clusters of water molecules are the
ions contained in water.&quot; It's phrased to assume the unsupported
conclusions, but there are glimmers of a clue there. We could easily imagine
a set of experiments using various (measurable) dilutions of a collection of
salts that bring us closer to understanding at least some aspects of these
observations.

As the authors have gone since 1978 without demonstrating this sort of
scientific imagination, I expect they'll retire before performing these
sorts of experiments.

An explanation in search of a phenomenon

The special edition does contain a single article that acts as a
counterbalance, one with the phrase &quot;a sceptical view&quot; in the title. Its
abstract is quite blunt, saying, &quot;It has been suggested that water could
retain a &quot;memory&quot; of substances that have been dissolved in it before the
successive dilutions. The paper stresses the fact that this idea is not
compatible with our knowledge of pure water.&quot;

The author's point is that homeopaths should just give up on the whole
&quot;memory of water&quot; thing—it just goes against too much of what we know.
Instead, homeopaths should treat their medicine like any other, and subject
it to a double-blind medical trial. To an extent, this comes across as a
physicist (which the author is) trying to get the pseudoscientists to go
bother some other field. But it's hard to argue with him; it would be the
height of absurdity to rewrite much of what we know about chemistry and
physics in order to incorporate an effect that hasn't been conclusively
shown to exist.

The symptoms of pseudoscience

Those of you who slogged through to the conclusion might be expecting to see
a diatribe against homeopathy in general. But, if the practice of homeopathy
turns water into a mechanism for helping individuals feel better via a
placebo effect, then the only issue with it becomes ensuring that it doesn't
prevent people who really need medical intervention from getting it.

But a subset of the homeopathic community has consistently demanded that
their practice be viewed as scientific, presumably to obtain the credibility
that traditional medicine receives. As our article reveals, they hope to
achieve this without actually engaging in scientific practices. In doing so,
they have adopted many of techniques used in other fields of pseudoscience:

* Ignore settled issues in science: We know a great deal about the
behavior of water (and evolution, and other contentious topics), but there
are many efforts to introduce new science without ever addressing the
existing body of knowledge. As such, many of the basic tenets of topics such
as homeopathy appear to be ungrounded in reality as we understand it.
* Misapplication of real science: Quantum mechanics is an undeniably
successful description of parts of the natural world, but the limitations of
its applicability are widely recognized by the scientific community, if not
the general public. Pseudoscientists such as homeopaths appear to cynically
target this sort of ignorance by applying scientific principles to
inappropriate topics.
* Rejection of scientific standards: Over the centuries, science has
established standards of evidence and experiment to ensure that data remains
consistent and reproducible. But these strengths are presented as weaknesses
that make science impervious to new ideas, a stance that is often
accompanied by...
* Claims of suppression: Pseudoscience is rejected because it does not
conform to the standards held by the scientific community. That community is
depicted as a dangerous hegemony that rejects new ideas in order to
perpetuate a stifling orthodoxy. This happens in spite of many examples of
radical ideas that have rapidly gained not only acceptance, but major
prizes, when they were properly supported by scientific evidence.
* A conclusion/evidence gap: Many areas of pseudoscience do not set out
to examine a phenomenon but rather have the stated goal of supporting a
preordained conclusion. As such, they often engage in excessive logical
leaps when the actual data is insufficient to support the desired
conclusion.
* Focusing on the fringes: All areas of science have anomalous data and
anecdotal findings that are inconsistent with the existing understanding.
But those anomalies should not obscure the fact that the vast majority of
current data does support the predominant theories. In the hands of a
pseudoscientist, these unconnected edge cases are presented as a coherent
body of knowledge that supports the replacement of existing understandings.

Perhaps the clearest theme running through many areas of pseudoscience,
however, is the attempt to make a whole that is far, far greater than the
sum of its parts. Enlarging a collection of terminally-flawed trivia does
not somehow strengthen its scientific significance. This is especially true
when many of the components of the argument don't form a coherent whole. For
example, quantum entanglement, structured water, and silica are essentially
unrelated explanations, and any support for one of them makes no difference
to the others. Yet, somehow, presenting them all at once is supposed to make
the case for water's memory harder to dismiss.

In extracting these consistent themes, it was remarkably easy to recognize
similar instances of most of them in many of the more contentious areas of
pseudoscience, such as intelligent design, creationism, and denial of the
HIV/AIDS connection. We've intentionally avoided discussing those topics in
detail, but we hope those who read this article are willing to perform that
exercise on their own.
