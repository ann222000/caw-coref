I just realized that I have a kind of urgent question (I'm playing
tomorrow). My party has won a huge amount of treasure - more than we
ever expected to get - and now we need to make up wish lists of magic
items to buy. Not everything will be available, but a lot will be - I
hope.

We're playing in the Forgotten Realms, in Cormyr. I'm playing a
7th-level cleric of Tymora, CG. I cast Fly daily, wear very heavy
magical platemail (+1, lesser fortification, Silent Moves), and have a
+1 cloak of resistance. I get into combat pretty often.

Oh, and I also have a +1 steel shield.

Obviously I'll want a periapt of wisdom (as high as possible), a pearl
of power (ditto), and a +1 or better weapon. What else would you put on
your wish list in my situation? I don't have a GP count, but it's very,
very high.

I'd appreciate any suggestions...

If you have the 36,000 gp the single best item you can get is an orange
prism ioun stone (+1 caster level).  If you have to forgo everything
else to get it. do so, some of the other ioun stones are useful too.
Right behind that are metamagic rods.  I don't remember if they had
those in 3.0 though.

If you don't have that kind of money Pearls of power for any level you
tend to use up, probably 2nd level spells if you like to buff.  Wand(s)
of cure light wounds (if you don't have one or more already), scrolls,
wands, potions, or staves of anything else you might need to use
(scrolls for the rare contingencies, wands for the everyday backups).
Boots of speed perhaps if you fight toe to toe often.  Ring of blinking
is also a great defense.

Oh.

Magic hookers and blow!

Barring those, some kind of bag of holding or other magical container
will always come in handy. I've always like the Murlynd's Spoon (I see
it's called a Sustaining Spoon now), but you might want to throw in
some more cash to make the gruel actually taste like something.
Or pack lots of spices and hot sauce.

Do they still have bracers of brachiation? I loved those things.

A rod of metamagic, preferably Quicken.  Even if it's only the lesser,
limited to 3rd level spells or below, my cleric had one last campaign
and it proved very useful, not just for a Quicken Divine Favor/Divine
Power.

However, especially since you just took Extend Spell for those 3.0
ability buff spells, more valueable to you would be a rod of Empower or
even better a rod of Maximize.  With a rod of Maximize on your Extended
Bull's Strength that's +5 strength for 14 hours, guaranteed.  If you
take rod of Empower, you get a range of +3 to +7 depending on your
roll.  The Maximize rod is more efficient.  Also use it on an Extended
Endurance Spell for +5 Consitution for 14 hours a day.

Definitely, a rod of Maximize.

Turn Undead much? A Phylactery of Undead Turning is worthwhile having.

A half-dozen Wands of Cure Light Wounds, so you can concentrate on using

A few applications of Sovereign Glue and Universal Solvent can always be put

Unfortunately there are no rods of metamagic in the 3.0 DMG. Are they
3.5 only, or are they listed in some other 3.0 sourcebook? I don't

While the wands are a great idea, I would pick up a few potions of Cure
Light Wounds.
There are times when YOU might be the one down, and if your party doesn't
have a
caster available to heal you, a potion might just save your life (if it is
down below 0)

Maybe a Figurine of Power to have a mount or guardian available such as a
Stone Horse.
with Horseshoes of a Zephyr.
Or look for an item like the Lantern of Revealing (dispels invisibility).
or and item with a safe space to camp, I forget the whole name but it is an
instant fortress.
Or a rope with Rope Trick to get a safe space to hide and heal.
Portable Hole? Bag of Holding? Gate Rings? I would spend a part of your
fortune getting
items that you cannot duplicate. This way when your party is up against the
wall, you can
McGuyver your way out of it! (I know, I just dated myself with that
reference. McGuyver
was McGuyver before he was Col. McNiel on Stargate!)

Why? The ioun stone only gives you +1 caster level, not spells per day
and access to higher level spells, right?

Sure, it's a nice boost once you've got all the basics, but "forgo
everything"? Is casting 4d8 searing lights instead of 3d8 ones and
having you spells last 8 hours/minutes/round rather than 7 really better
than anything else he could get for 36,000 gp?

A better cloak. Even as a cleric, your saves can never be too high.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I get into combat pretty often.
">

A +1 holy weapon, season to taste with bane if you find yourself
fighting a single creature type (or is bane +2 in 3.0?), elemental
enhacements... not straight plusses, since you can get those easily
enough through greater magic weapon.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Obviously I'll want a periapt of wisdom (as high as possible),

Right. But not too high: if you've got something like 50,000 gp to
spend, you're better of with (for example) a periapt +4, +1 holy weapon
and +1 moderater fortification armour than with a periapt +6 and the
armour, but no weapon.

As a general rule: don't spend it all in one place. :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; a pearl of power (ditto),
">

Not necessarily. Low-level pearls of power are great when you're low
level (when you've got three 1st-level spells, another one is +33%
capacity!), but at high levels, they get prohibitively expensive. I
wouldn't bother with a pearl of power past 3rd level or so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What else would you put on

A necklace of prayer beads that contains a bead of karma (you'll have to
check the specifics, I think there has been some changes 3.0-&gt;3.5). It
lets you boost your caster level by +4 for 10 minutes. Do it at the
start of the day, and get even better enhancements from magic vestment
and greater magic weapon, and they (and bull's stregth &amp;c.) last 4 hours
longer.

But again, if the necklace is more than, say, a third of your spending
money, it's probably not worth it.

Very high? Cube of Force! It will drive your DM nuts... :)
IMO a Portable Hole is one of the coolest items.
And for the loose change (9,000 gp) a Decanter of Endless Water...

I believe the reference in the first few episodes of SG-1 was when
Carter makes a reference to getting the gate working in the first
place (with no DHD), along the lines of "It took us 10 years to
McGuyver the thing."

&gt; &gt; However, especially since you just took Extend Spell for those 3.0
&gt; &gt; ability buff spells, more valueable to you would be a rod of Empower or
&gt; &gt; even better a rod of Maximize.  With a rod of Maximize on your Extended
&gt; &gt; Bull's Strength that's +5 strength for 14 hours, guaranteed.  If you
&gt; &gt; take rod of Empower, you get a range of +3 to +7 depending on your
&gt; &gt; roll.  The Maximize rod is more efficient.  Also use it on an Extended
&gt; &gt; Endurance Spell for +5 Consitution for 14 hours a day.

&gt; &gt; Definitely, a rod of Maximize.

&gt; Unfortunately there are no rods of metamagic in the 3.0 DMG. Are they
&gt; 3.5 only, or are they listed in some other 3.0 sourcebook? I don't
&gt; think I can get 3.5 items.

I think they are in the 3.0 splat book for arcane magic.  Darn it, I
can't remember the name.  There's Defenders of the Faith, Sword &amp; Fist,
Sound &amp; Silence, and the one for wizards and sorcerers.

Just looked it up.  Tome and Blood.  The metamagic rods were first
mentioned there.

Sigh...me and my big mouth.

All in all, the treasure comes to less than 2,000 gp per party member.
Mine will all have to be spent on getting a +1 morningstar, I guess.

You'd think that with every single one of us loaded up to the maximum
with coins, plus a bag of holding and a number of magic items to sell,
we'd have done better than that. So it goes...

Pretty sure it was first episode, where O'Neill first met Carter.  Was Carter
supposed to have been around in the background during the time of the movie,
or did the 'mcgyvering' take place in the 2 years between?

Likely the very first episode -- before the return to Abydos to get Daniel
back.  I think it was 2 years, though I don't recall what they had to do to
improve the device after the movie; it was Carter who invented whatever
newness they needed, and she hadn't been around at the time of the movie).

BTW I recently watched the first season of McGyver on DvD. whoah, ancient
setting.  I don't think he even used duct tape until halfway through the
season.

ut, of course, these are nits and have nothing to do with DnD.
