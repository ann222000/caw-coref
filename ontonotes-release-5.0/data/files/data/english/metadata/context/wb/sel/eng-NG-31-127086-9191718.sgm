Hi everyone,

Just wrote this article for the blog and would appreciate your comments

The Drug-Seeker: an Urban Legend?

I doubt there are many people involved in the wonderful world of
chronic pain on either the treatment side or the lack of treatment side
who haven't heard of that malicious and devious creature known as the
drug-seeker. Depending on one's point of view, he is either a
Svengali-like manipulator able to hypnotize even the most jaded doctors
into forking over Vicodin by the jugful or a pathetic, toothless rube
claiming to be allergic to every drug known to man except that one
beginning with a &quot;d&quot; (Dilaudid, or Demerol). To hear some doctors talk
about it, it seems that everyone with pain is either a drug seeker or a
wuss who couldn't handle a paper cut without an IV morphine drip. But
it seems the drug-seeker is universally blamed by both doctors and
patients alike for the hostile and negative attitudes people with
chronic pain routinely encounter from the medical profession.

One of the interesting things about the drug-seeker phenomenon as it is
often described on many medical blogs is that you often read accounts
of drug seekers that are remarkably consistent from one blog to the
next, as if everyone has encountered the exact same guy using the same
pathetic story to scam for drugs. Usually, it will be an ER nurse or ER
doctor talking about a guy who claims to be allergic to &quot;Tylenol,
ibuprofen, and every other NSAID, and Toradol doesn't do it for me; but
I can take Vicodin and that other drug that begins with a &quot;d&quot;...uh, I
had it the last time I was here...what's that thing called...oh, that's
right! Dilaudid! (or Demerol, both powerful narcotics). If you read
medical blogs a lot, and I do, you will likely encounter some version
of this story with only minor variations.

In fact, this story is so common that someone has even begun marketing
an assortment of magnets and buttons on cafepress.com with a guy in a
hospital gown voicing this very story!

The caption reads:
&quot;YEAH RIGHT!

Well, I hurt my back about three months ago and heat and ice just
aren't cutting it. I'm allergic to Tylenol, Ibuprofen and Naproxen and
Toradol just doesn't work for me. I had really good luck with that one
medicine I got the last time I was here. What was it called? It started
with a &quot;D&quot;. I think.. Does Demerol sound right?

It starts with a &quot;D&quot; all right!
DRUG SEEKER!&quot;

The thing about this story is that it's obvious that anyone actually
using this line is going to earn himself a one-way ticket onto the
blacklist and can forget about ever getting drugs in that hospital
again. No doctor would be likely to give meds to a guy like this
particularly as they all claim to have heard this story a million
times, so you would think that by a simple process of evolution the
drug scammers would either put their heads together and come up with a
better spiel than this, or would be forced to give up on trying to
score drugs at the ER.

Yet according to the DEA, drug scammers are so sophisticated that there
is allegedly an &quot;epidemic&quot; of prescription drug abuse and diversion
going on, and drug seekers must therefore be quite skilled at obtaining
drugs (of course, the DEA is full of crap, too, but I digress). This is
particularly true as most people with real chronic pain problems report
incredible difficulty getting doctors to take their pain seriously and
prescribe any painkillers at all, let alone an adequate dose, and
frequently report being accused of drug-seeking or of being whimps who
can't take pain. If soaking your spear with the blood of your first
&quot;drug-seeker&quot; is a right of passage for many docs, being falsely
accused of being one is a right of passage for people with chronic
pain.

In truth I can see how a sophisticated drug addict who knows how to
play the game would have a far better chance of getting pain meds than
some poor girl who has never had severe pain in her life, but one day
injures her back and limps into the ER complaining of severe pain. She
naively says she's allergic to NSAIDs, but her friend gave her an
OxyContin that worked great for the pain, and &quot;can I have one of
those?&quot;, not realizing that she just signed her own arrest warrant and
won her doctor $50 bucks from the &quot;first drug seeker of the night&quot;
pool.

So I would imagine anyone actually dumb enough to use a story like our
poster boy above would more likely be a legitimate chronic pain patient
who doesn't know any better than a scammer, and that this archetypal
drug seeker you encounter on so many many med blogs is in reality just
an urban legend, stitched together like Frankenstein from bits and
pieces torn from real people with real pain who were too naive to know
they were walking into a minefield when they stepped into their
doctor's office and used the &quot;P&quot; word for the first time. It is highly
improbable that so many different doctors, in so many different places,
would have had so many encounters with this many individual patients
who all presented with almost identical stories.

Snopes.com, the noted debunker of urban legends, defines urban legends
as:

...narratives which put our fears and concerns into the form of
stories or are tales which we use to confirm the rightness of our world
view. As cautionary tales they warn us against engaging in risky
behaviors by pointing out what has supposedly happened to others who
did what we might be tempted to try. Other legends confirm our belief
that it's a big, bad world out there, one awash with crazed killers,
lurking terrorists, unscrupulous companies out to make a buck at any
cost, and a government that doesn't give a damn.

Folks commonly equate 'urban legend' with 'false' (i.e., &quot;Oh,
that's an urban legend!&quot;). Though the vast majority of such tales are
pure invention, a handful do turn out to be based on real incidents,
and whether or not something actually happened has no bearing on its
status as an urban legend. What lifts true tales of this type out of
the world of news and into the genre of contemporary lore is the
blurring of details and multiplicity of claims that the events happened
locally, alterations which take place as the stories are passed through
countless hands. Though there might indeed have been an original actual
event, it clearly did not happen to as many people or in as many places
as the various recountings of it would have us believe.

It definitely seems as if our archetypal drug seeker story meets the
definition of an urban legend, both in the sheer improbability of its
being true in so many different areas, as well as the fact that it
serves to &quot;confirm the rightness&quot; of the medical profession's &quot;world
view,&quot; which is to err on the side of undertreating pain in patients
with legitimate pain problems. If you can convince yourself that
everyone with adverse reactions to drugs or who requests a drug by name
is an addict, you don't have to go home and hate the person you see
staring back at you in the mirror each morning.

Perhaps you should.

How common is &quot;drug seeking&quot; really? No one has ever done a formal
study of actual drug-seeking behavior that I'm aware of, but there have
been numerous studies on the incidence of actual opiate addiction in
chronic pain patients and in the general population as a whole, and
every study I am familiar with show very low rates in both groups, the
highest estimate being less than 3 percent for cp'ers using a rather
bizarre definition of &quot;opioid use disorder,&quot; whatever the hell that is,
and 1 percent for the general population. So it is really hard to see
where this legion of Toradol-shunning Dilaudid zombies is coming from,
given the naked facts.

But facts are things that are readily discarded whenever they prove
inconvenient in the world of medicine, just as they are in the rest of
our world. Far better to cling to convenient half-truths and urban
legends if they make you doctors feel better about yourselves, because
after all, it's all about you. Most likely, there is at most a small
minority of pain patients who fall into the category of drug-seeker and
a very large majority of people with legitimate pain problems being
falsely accused of drug-seeking out of ignorance and bigotry. Many of
those people are forced into the role of drug-seeker by the very fact
that doctors are reluctant and unwilling to treat pain aggressively,
thus it becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. If a guy shows up in your
ER with excruciating pain and you give him 10 Vicodin, why are you
shocked that he would add a &quot;zero&quot; to the &quot;10?&quot; What choice did you
give him? Maybe if you had treated his pain appropriately with an
adequate amount of medication for the $1,600 he brought into your
hospital he wouldn't have had to do that.

Good stuff, Sean!
It may be a bit redundant in the first 4 or so paragraphs, but,
the........*it begins with a D*  is a major thrust of the article so
maybe it is fine. Also, since I am fairly familiar with that script I
might find it redundant when a naïve reader would not. See what the
others think.
Otherwise, I feel it's pretty good.

Hey-don't I know it!!!

When I went into detox-in an attempt to shorten, or avoid my prison
sentence, I remember the phrase being used!  And the 'addiction
specialist' psychiatrist would often try to bring out the behavior in
me-to help me realize that I was an addict.  So, maybe it's been
taught for years.

When I got the flu, I remember this doctor always saying that he'd
prescribe some Tylenol and cough medicine for it...then 'forget' to do
it.  The nurses-all addiction specialists-were all too willing to
point out my;'drug-seeking behavior'.
Of course, there were no opiates there.  I only wanted relief for my
cough, and the minimal relief that Tylenol gave. But, it was still
drug-seeking behavior.

I was taught to act like an addict!

This is interesting!

I'll be working on my own article-'the making of a junkie' or
something like that.  Even before this, it was like the doctors were
waiting to be asked for some mild opiate.  And, they'd grudgingly give
it(at first).  But, when the time came when I became more of a
liability than an asset, they could cut me off with a clear
conscience.

Pseudoaddiction lives!

I kind of had an opposite epiphany like when a drug addict finally
admits his infirmity...the time my parole officer told me to see a
pain doctor.

Admittedly, this isn't a well thought-out post. I just had to say it.
You hit the nail on the head, Sean.  Doctors .
and law enforcement needed a measuring stick for the type of addict
who didn't fit the type that was alredy there..So, th birth of drug-
seeking?

Thanks, Sean.  If only we' been organized 17 years ago!

I have to write things that way as I never know who might be reading. I
have to assume the person reading doesn't know what a &quot;drug-seeker&quot;
even is, or anything about the politics surrounding this issue becasue
outside of groups like this, I'd imagine most people don't. I have been
in support goups for years and never even heard the term &quot;drug seeker&quot;
though I did hear lots of people saying they were accused of being
&quot;addicts,&quot; nor did I ever encounter &quot;drug -seeking&quot; behavior which you
think would have popped up given everyone was talking about pain meds.

oh,,,it's up!

http://conditionpainful.blogspot.com/2007/09/making-of-junkie.html

Are Junkies born, or made?

Me, I suffer from Chronic Pain.  I have since I had the first of three
accidents-a fall down a flight of stairs-in 1979.  But, as opiates
were soon the only effective method of pain control, I soon had the
'addict' label lurking over my head.  One doctor, an orthopedic
specialist, admitting that I was not getting better, used the fact to
stop giving me opiates and muscle relaxers.  Well, that made sense.
Since there was no getting better, there should be no  feeling better.

Still, I kept trying.  I went to different doctors;  I never got
anything stronger than Percocet and that, not for the chronic symptoms-
only when I had an acute condition,  did I get that rare chance at
relief.

I hit my late 30's.  I wasn't getting any younger.  And I felt even
older than I was.

Sometime after my 40th birthday, I saw a chance at relief; some
doctors left their prescription pads unattended, I began to notice.

Do I have to describe the next step?

But this isn't 'the Making of a Criminal'.  So, I skip to almost a
year later. After I've been caught.

My court-appointed lawyer advises me to check into my local hospital's
detox.  I have to wait; he says to make sure that I don't go in
'clean'. I make it, all right.

By then, I've accepted the 'addict' label.  Fortunate for me, since
I'm going to be attending two to three Alcoholics Anonymous, or
Narcotics Anonymous meetings a day. Of course, that's where you
intrdouce yourself by your first name, and say I'm an
alcoholic(addict). Plus, classes by the 'addiction specialist' doctor,
ans similarly-trained nurses.

The first three days, I'm on methadone. Not for pain, but for detox
purposes.  I feel a sense of unreality; a kind of spaciness,  I want
to succeed; but, somehow, I know that I won't.

Throughout, I get the feeling that there's a difference between myself
and the other patients- I'm not better, or more deserving, or even
less of a drug fiend; still, I know that drugs will never be
eliminated from my life.  I get an inkling of what I mean, when I hear
myself ask the doctor, using a thought process that I'm just beginning
to reclaim, if I can go on methadone maintenance indefinitely; he
refuses angrily.  Later, he will say that he'll think abut it, but
it's never brought up again.

For the most part,I get along with the others...we all ourselves 'the
junkies'.  One thing they can't understand, though-two are even
angered by it; whenever we are told to 'talk of the pain' that is
exactly what I talk about-the actual, physical, pain, that I have,
every day, and probably always will.  In turn, they speak about
getting high...well, I've used alcohol, of course, and marijuana, for
that purpose...and, yes, some of the opiates I've been taking have
that effect, sometimes-but I don't have that overwhelming, impulsive
need to get high....just as they don't have the overwhelming,
impulsive need to take painkillers, when the have an ache or pain.

My name is Legend. I am a Chronic Pain Sufferer.

But, I get ahead of myself.

I ask the doctor to prescribe Tylenol for me, so that I can get rid of
some of the pain; he agrees, but keeps putting it off.  Soon, I also
have a case of the flu, along with a hacking cough; It is so bad, that
even my fellow inpatients, and the nurses, sympathize; yet, the doc is
slow in writing the script.

But, during one of my requests, at the nurses' station(where all meds
are handed out) I hear a term, now used quite often, for the very
first time; drug-seeking behavior!

Some kinds of junkies have to be made; and I'm one of them.

Now, I know, and so does everyone else, that I'm not going to get any
opiates, or remotely similar drugs, there; yet, it has been necessary
to put me through the paces...already, I strongly suspected some of
the doctors that I'd consulted, of knowing how bad my pain was, and
letting me wear the mantle of an addict, instead...it was the 'kinder'
approach-especially in the early 1980's, when I was still in my early
30's...Better for me to think that I was in danger of having some
uncontrollable, impulsive, disease, than to know that relief is out
there, but no doctor is going to give it to me, as I needed it.
Doctors just weren't that stupid, they couldn't be.  Well, I guess
it's not for me to know.

So, 'drug-seeking behavior' safely pointed out, I was given my(non-
narcotic, of course) cough medicine, and regular Tylenol; by this
time, my stay is nearly over.  I'm even accepting things more, and
tell one of the NA group leaders that &quot;I'm just starting to think I'll
make it.&quot;

Well, I don't, but that's another story.  We skip ahead to a time
after I've done my prison time, but before I'm free to live as I
choose;  I have a new Parole Officer, and, even though I'm required to
attend a 'drug-free' rehab, outpatient, she notices that I'm in pain-
and insists that I see a pain specialist!

Well, hat's when the Hallelujah Chorus comes in-but  I've had to go
through all of this-just to be told what I already knew-I'm In Chronic
Pain.

For those who have never been to jail or prison, or under the threat-
there are few people, outside of libertarians  and  other ex-cons, who
will accept you, especially as a group;  as I mentioned in my previous
post, no, not even Chronic Pain Sufferers, as a group, will give
universal acceptance I;m usually regarded as someone who 'acted
outside the box', endangering other  Chronic Painer's Status with the
law, and the medical community.  I don't see my crime as something I
needed to do, or  couldn't have done without-but it did put me in a
place where I had no right to judge addicts for using drugs.
Something I think we should all think about, when  we're  living
through hard times, with insufficient medicine and other relief.

&gt; me-to help me realize that I was an addict.  So, maybe it's been
&gt; taught for years.
">

The term &quot;drug-seeker&quot; is something that's been around for years, but I
think it's a term doctors tend to use more than us. There is an
interesting piece from the BMJ of 1969 where a British doctor is
talking about a patient he feels is a drug-seeker. Though he doesn't
use the term per se, he describes the patient as &quot;seeking drugs&quot; &quot;Drug
Seeker&quot; is name of the title.

Note how he talks about &quot;characteristics that make him easily
recognizable.&quot; (Like that he has pain and needs treatment).

The patient in turn expresses the opinion that no one believes he's in
pain, and tries, to no avail, to appeal to the doctor's conscience only
to dismissed with a subtle but nonetheless contemptuous accusation of
sympathy-seeking. The doctor also violates his confidentiality by
printing his name in a medical journal.

The more things change, the more they stay the same.

&gt; When I got the flu, I remember this doctor always saying that he'd

&gt; it.  The nurses-all addiction specialists-were all too willing to
&gt; point out my;'drug-seeking behavior'.
&gt; Of course, there were no opiates there.  I only wanted relief for my
&gt; cough, and the minimal relief that Tylenol gave. But, it was still
&gt; drug-seeking behavior.

&gt; I was taught to act like an addict!

&gt; This is interesting!

This is not surprising, as drug-seeking is essentially an iatrogenic
problem. If people could just treat themselves without having to go to
a doctor, there would be no &quot;seeking&quot; at all. Seeking arises entirely
out of the draconian and barbaric system set up by the doctors and the
drug warriors to protect their monopoly and keep drug prices
artificially inflated.

If we had a system where you had to go to a guy in a white coat and
prove that you were hungry before you could get something to eat, I
suspect &quot;food-seeking&quot; behavior would start to emerge pretty quickly as
well. In fact if you read the accounts of famines and the desperate
measures people resort to to get food, such as killing and eating each
other, drug seeking begins to look pretty tame in comparison. It is
normal, natural and utterly predicatable that if you deprive human
beings of something they need to survive, they will react in certain
ways. To drive people to behave like this is utterly barbaric and
insane.

I could just imagine how this would work: if you wwere fat, you would
be told you are already receiving excessive food, and we are not going
to give you any more. If you were skinny, you would be told there is no
evidence that food is working for you, and you'd be denied on those
grounds. I suspect the power-tripping, arrogance, and contemptuous
attitudes displayed to be identical to what we see as pain patients.

Just to play devil's advocate, let me tell you what I've seen.

Case #1 - C comes into the hospital about every 3-4 weeks complaining
of intractable pain.  Now she already has a central line because her
peripheral veins are shot.  She has Crohn's and a peg tube for meds
and some feedings, though she can certainly scarf down a burger and
fries with no difficulty.

The problem is this...meds given through the peg tube don't give the
same rush as the ones given IV.  She convinces the doc, over and over,
to order the Dilaudid, Phenergan (for nausea), and Benadryl (for
itching) IV push, and they are ordered so that she can get all three
at the same time.  In fact, she demands them at the same time.  No
bodily indicators of pain - no increased pulse, intolerance to
activity, or other language the body uses to tell us it hurts.

C has been observed picking at the area around her peg tube,
irritating it.  She comes in at least once a month with an infection
around the tube, which is unlikely unless it's being (in the doctor's
words) manipulated.

So, every 3 hours on the dot, she's on the call light for her meds.
She wants them given fast (for the rush) and into the closest port to
the end of the central line (faster delivery).  She gets mad at me for
not following her directions.  I tell her that my training taught me
to only give life-saving IV push drugs quickly...that the other ones
must be given slowly to prevent slowed respirations and possible life-
threatening complications.  I dilute the meds in saline so they aren't
so concentrated.

You can watch as the drugs hit her system.  It's like she's stoned.

5 minutes later she's up with her IV pole and best friend, heading
down to the barfeteria to scarf whatever she can find.  She shows up
back on the floor exactly 5 minutes before the 3 hours is up so she
can hit the call light and get more dilaudid, phenergan, and benadryl.

Case #2 - aggressive lady, who has a sick mom.  Every time mom, who is
slowly dying from some nasty disease, comes to the hospital, either
she, her daughter, or both also get admitted for intractable pain.

The difference between this lady and lady number 1 is the belligerent
and aggressive attitude this lady shows.  She yells and demands
treatment and a private room because she is &quot;allergic to latex&quot; (an
undocumented fact).  If she's denied a private room, she starts
screaming racial discrimination and makes her roommates so miserable
they request a transfer.

She, too, gets the dilaudid-phenergan-benadryl combo.  Within 5
minutes she's on her way to the barfeteria and then the smoking area
outside, where she hangs out with her buddies playing cards and
shooting the breeze until - you guessed it - 5 minutes before the due
time for the next medication dose.  Then she hightails it back UP THE
STAIRS and insists she's dying from the pain.

Case #3 - I also had one who would take his IV pole and haul it down
the stairs, pump and all, so he could smoke, all within 5 minutes of
getting HIS dilaudid-phenergan-benadryl cocktail.  Again, the appetite
of a horse, visitors all hours of the day and night, pizzas ordered
in, movies and card games and laughing that makes him require a
private room as well.

These are the drug seekers nurses in hospitals deal with.  To some it
might be an urban legend, but to the experienced nurse there is a big
difference between someone in genuine pain and someone who is looking
for a fix.  And yes, they do exist.  We called them frequent flyers.
We could almost tell you by time interval when they'd be back.

Just my opinion, insignificant as it is...

Dear Sean,

I dropped in to the blog and left a response to the &quot;psychic physician&quot;. I
hope I didn't say anything out of line and tried to stay PC even though he
really pissed me off.
I was wondering (I realize now I dumped it, after working on it for about an
hour. I'll take another shot in the AM) how I submit something to you to see
if you want to put it up. It was about NDAID's and all the daily maxes and
some of the organ disintegrating effects. I just figured folks should know
that kind of stuff.
And you won't hurt my feelings at all if you don't want it or want to change
it around. As far as I'm concerned anything I write, you have permission to
put on your blog. Don't ask, just grab it if you want it

Looking Good--og.

&gt; Hi everyone,

&gt; Just wrote this article for the blog and would appreciate your comments
&gt; on the site.

&gt; http://paynehertz.blogspot.com/2007/09/drug-seeker-urban-legend.html

&gt; --Sean C

&gt; The Drug-Seeker: an Urban Legend?

&gt; I doubt there are many people involved in the wonderful world of
&gt; chronic pain on either the treatment side or the lack of treatment side
&gt; who haven't heard of that malicious and devious creature known as the
&gt; drug-seeker. Depending on one's point of view, he is either a
&gt; Svengali-like manipulator able to hypnotize even the most jaded doctors
&gt; into forking over Vicodin by the jugful or a pathetic, toothless rube
&gt; claiming to be allergic to every drug known to man except that one
&gt; beginning with a &quot;d&quot; (Dilaudid, or Demerol). To hear some doctors talk
&gt; about it, it seems that everyone with pain is either a drug seeker or a
&gt; wuss who couldn't handle a paper cut without an IV morphine drip. But
&gt; it seems the drug-seeker is universally blamed by both doctors and
&gt; patients alike for the hostile and negative attitudes people with
&gt; chronic pain routinely encounter from the medical profession.

&gt; One of the interesting things about the drug-seeker phenomenon as it is
&gt; often described on many medical blogs is that you often read accounts
&gt; of drug seekers that are remarkably consistent from one blog to the
&gt; next, as if everyone has encountered the exact same guy using the same
&gt; pathetic story to scam for drugs. Usually, it will be an ER nurse or ER
&gt; doctor talking about a guy who claims to be allergic to &quot;Tylenol,
&gt; ibuprofen, and every other NSAID, and Toradol doesn't do it for me; but
&gt; I can take Vicodin and that other drug that begins with a &quot;d&quot;...uh, I
&gt; had it the last time I was here...what's that thing called...oh, that's
&gt; right! Dilaudid! (or Demerol, both powerful narcotics). If you read
&gt; medical blogs a lot, and I do, you will likely encounter some version
&gt; of this story with only minor variations.

&gt; In fact, this story is so common that someone has even begun marketing
&gt; an assortment of magnets and buttons on cafepress.com with a guy in a
&gt; hospital gown voicing this very story!

&gt; The caption reads:
&gt; &quot;YEAH RIGHT!

&gt; Well, I hurt my back about three months ago and heat and ice just
&gt; aren't cutting it. I'm allergic to Tylenol, Ibuprofen and Naproxen and
&gt; Toradol just doesn't work for me. I had really good luck with that one
&gt; medicine I got the last time I was here. What was it called? It started
&gt; with a &quot;D&quot;. I think.. Does Demerol sound right?

&gt; It starts with a &quot;D&quot; all right!
&gt; DRUG SEEKER!&quot;

&gt; The thing about this story is that it's obvious that anyone actually
&gt; using this line is going to earn himself a one-way ticket onto the
&gt; blacklist and can forget about ever getting drugs in that hospital
&gt; again. No doctor would be likely to give meds to a guy like this
&gt; particularly as they all claim to have heard this story a million
&gt; times, so you would think that by a simple process of evolution the
&gt; drug scammers would either put their heads together and come up with a
&gt; better spiel than this, or would be forced to give up on trying to
&gt; score drugs at the ER.

&gt; Yet according to the DEA, drug scammers are so sophisticated that there
&gt; is allegedly an &quot;epidemic&quot; of prescription drug abuse and diversion
&gt; going on, and drug seekers must therefore be quite skilled at obtaining
&gt; drugs (of course, the DEA is full of crap, too, but I digress). This is
&gt; particularly true as most people with real chronic pain problems report
&gt; incredible difficulty getting doctors to take their pain seriously and
&gt; prescribe any painkillers at all, let alone an adequate dose, and
&gt; frequently report being accused of drug-seeking or of being whimps who
&gt; can't take pain. If soaking your spear with the blood of your first
&gt; &quot;drug-seeker&quot; is a right of passage for many docs, being falsely
&gt; accused of being one is a right of passage for people with chronic
&gt; pain.

&gt; In truth I can see how a sophisticated drug addict who knows how to
&gt; play the game would have a far better chance of getting pain meds than
&gt; some poor girl who has never had severe pain in her life, but one day
&gt; injures her back and limps into the ER complaining of severe pain. She
&gt; naively says she's allergic to NSAIDs, but her friend gave her an
&gt; OxyContin that worked great for the pain, and &quot;can I have one of
&gt; those?&quot;, not realizing that she just signed her own arrest warrant and
&gt; won her doctor $50 bucks from the &quot;first drug seeker of the night&quot;
&gt; pool.

&gt; So I would imagine anyone actually dumb enough to use a story like our
&gt; poster boy above would more likely be a legitimate chronic pain patient
&gt; who doesn't know any better than a scammer, and that this archetypal
&gt; drug seeker you encounter on so many many med blogs is in reality just
&gt; an urban legend, stitched together like Frankenstein from bits and
&gt; pieces torn from real people with real pain who were too naive to know
&gt; they were walking into a minefield when they stepped into their
&gt; doctor's office and used the &quot;P&quot; word for the first time. It is highly
&gt; improbable that so many different doctors, in so many different places,
&gt; would have had so many encounters with this many individual patients
&gt; who all presented with almost identical stories.

&gt; Snopes.com, the noted debunker of urban legends, defines urban legends
&gt; as:

&gt;    ...narratives which put our fears and concerns into the form of
&gt; stories or are tales which we use to confirm the rightness of our world
&gt; view. As cautionary tales they warn us against engaging in risky
&gt; behaviors by pointing out what has supposedly happened to others who
&gt; did what we might be tempted to try. Other legends confirm our belief
&gt; that it's a big, bad world out there, one awash with crazed killers,
&gt; lurking terrorists, unscrupulous companies out to make a buck at any
&gt; cost, and a government that doesn't give a damn.

&gt;    Folks commonly equate 'urban legend' with 'false' (i.e., &quot;Oh,
&gt; that's an urban legend!&quot;). Though the vast majority of such tales are
&gt; pure invention, a handful do turn out to be based on real incidents,
&gt; and whether or not something actually happened has no bearing on its
&gt; status as an urban legend. What lifts true tales of this type out of
&gt; the world of news and into the genre of contemporary lore is the
&gt; blurring of details and multiplicity of claims that the events happened
&gt; locally, alterations which take place as the stories are passed through
&gt; countless hands. Though there might indeed have been an original actual
&gt; event, it clearly did not happen to as many people or in as many places
&gt; as the various recountings of it would have us believe.

&gt; It definitely seems as if our archetypal drug seeker story meets the
&gt; definition of an urban legend, both in the sheer improbability of its
&gt; being true in so many different areas, as well as the fact that it
&gt; serves to &quot;confirm the rightness&quot; of the medical profession's &quot;world
&gt; view,&quot; which is to err on the side of undertreating pain in patients
&gt; with legitimate pain problems. If you can convince yourself that
&gt; everyone with adverse reactions to drugs or who requests a drug by name
&gt; is an addict, you don't have to go home and hate the person you see
&gt; staring back at you in the mirror each morning.

&gt; Perhaps you should.

&gt; How common is &quot;drug seeking&quot; really? No one has ever done a formal
&gt; study of actual drug-seeking behavior that I'm aware of, but there have
&gt; been numerous studies on the incidence of actual opiate addiction in
&gt; chronic pain patients and in the general population as a whole, and
&gt; every study I am familiar with show very low rates in both groups, the
&gt; highest estimate being less than 3 percent for cp'ers using a rather
&gt; bizarre definition of &quot;opioid use disorder,&quot; whatever the hell that is,
&gt; and 1 percent for the general population. So it is really hard to see
&gt; where this legion of Toradol-shunning Dilaudid zombies is coming from,
&gt; given the naked facts.

&gt; But facts are things that are readily discarded whenever they prove
&gt; inconvenient in the world of medicine, just as they are in the rest of
&gt; our world. Far better to cling to convenient half-truths and urban
&gt; legends if they make you doctors feel better about yourselves, because
&gt; after all, it's all about you. Most likely, there is at most a small
&gt; minority of pain patients who fall into the category of drug-seeker and
&gt; a very large majority of people with legitimate pain problems being

Trisha,

Your opinion is not insignificant. If you read what i wrote carefully,
I never denied that drug seekers exist. What I did say, is that there
is this caricature of a drug seeker shared by just about every medical
blog out there, and this has the characteristics of an urban legend. I
also stated that the problem of drug seeking, while real, has been
grossly exaggerated, and my basis for stating this is that the actual
percentage of opiate addicts in the general population and amongst
cp'ers is actually very low, and yet the majority of people with cp
report being accused of being an addict or seeker, exaggerating or
faking their pain, being a wuss, seeking secondary gains, or some other
assault on their character at some point in their journey through the
medical system. I don't know how you define  &quot;frequent flyers,&quot; but
Scalpel defines them as someone with a toothache showing up in his ER
more than 3 times. Others put the limit at 4. That this is totally
arbitrary and unscientific is obvious on its face.

So the one thing I have to disagree with you on is that &quot;experienced
nurses&quot; can tell the difference between someone in real pain and
someone who is faking. The truth is, experienced doctors and nurses
*think* they can tell the difference, but judging by what you read on
this group and elsewhere, they get it wrong so often it ought to be a
scandal. I have seen drug seeker estimates as high as 85 percent of the
chronic pain population being offered by doctors right here on this
newsgroup, and I think you'll agree that experienced or not, that
estimate is a gross exaggeration and points to a bigger problem in the
system than drug seeking.

I also know people who are or were nurses in my real life support
groups, and they absolutely confirm everythimg I say about these things
and the way people with pain are treated, and the fact that doctors are
rarely punished for abusing patients, but merely pissing off a doctor
can land you on the blacklist to be denied treatment from then on.

Do you know the doctor that commented on my blog, who blogs anonymously
under the name Scalpel, revealed my real name on another blog? Do you
know that he boasts of blacklisting patients on his blog in violation
of the HIPAA laws? While I respect your opinions Trisha, you can't ask
that I take a creep like that on his word when he talks about drug
seekers. And unfortunately, if you read a lot of the med blogs out
there, they all seem to be carbon copies of this guy when it comes to
their attitude.

Trust me OG, I'm not worrried about PC, especially with that guy. He's

Sean:

I'm not denying there is a real problem when it comes to real people
in real pain.  I was just trying to give you a floor nurse's
perspective of one of the many reasons that people who present with
chronic pain, including myself, are looked at as drug-seekers even if
they're not.  These are the people who stick out in our minds and
memories....admitted 5 times in 3 months, staying 10-12 days at a
time, to get that fix and the level of drugs up high enough in the
bloodstream to keep them going for a week or two...then they come back
with another reason why they need more.  Pick at the peg tube till
it's draining and infected and you need IV antibiotics so you can get
your IV narcotics too - can't use the PEG tube because it's infected,
and for some reason oral pain meds just don't work right.  Come up
with reasons why it has to be a specific drug.

Even with a letter from my neurologist and approval from my pain
management specialist, I've been refused care at an emergency room
locally because they thought I was drug-seeking.  Never mind that I
have documented allergies to NSAID drugs, and that I'm already on
Methadone for my pain....they offered me Toradol, an NSAID, or
nothing.  They said they'd call the neurologist and talk to him, but
they weren't changing their minds.  Then they had the balls to bill me
for &quot;services rendered.&quot;  What services?  The laughing and talking
behind my back they didn't think I heard?  The snide comments?  The
implication that I wanted to get stoned?  The suggestion that even
with a pulse of 136 and a blood pressure of 147/110 I wasn't in pain?
Sure.  Let me run right to the bank and get your money.  Okay.  NOT!

It's like many other things in life...there are stereotypes or images
of a specific ethnic group, or income level, or education level, and
those stereotypes are formed because of the ones within that group
that make the most noise, the biggest negative impression, or raise
the most h*ll.  Take &quot;trailer trash.&quot;  I live in a mobile home.  It's
a singlewide.  We paid $25K for it new, all we could afford, after a
tornado ripped the roof off our heads while we were in the old place.
We're buying 4.2 acres of meticulously maintained rural land.  We have
landscaping hubby and I did, and a pond, and chickens, and trees, and
shrubs, and it's beautiful out here.  HOWEVER, when I was working, and
people found out I lived in a (gasp!) trailer, they immediately
thought it was a place with roaches scurrying about, soft floors,
peeling siding, and dark paneling.  They seemed to be shocked that I
was clean and my teeth were white.  They told me how foolish I was to
have a trailer on piers, and not on a foundation or basement, though
at the time that would have cost us an extra $12,500 that we didn't
have, so we did our best with what the insurance company gave us, and
this is the best we could do short of living in the garage.

See what I mean?

I know we all do stereotyping, and I know it's wrong.  However, we do
it because of specific individuals within people groups that we
encounter who leave a lasting impression on us, and that is where the
myth of the drug-seeker (or trailer trash, or junkie, or lazy-*ss
person on disability who could work if they just put their minds to it
and got their fat butts out of bed) comes from.  The numbers of all
these groups who genuinely take advantage of the system or live as the
stereotype imagines it is are very small indeed, but those few who
have made a major impression on us or whoever coins the catch phrase
make enough of an impression that it permeates our thoughts.

Ah, the benefits of mass media...

That's horse poopie!

when i was being undermedicated,  i went around to different Urgent Cares

myself into trouble due to being undermedicated.  But nobody HAS to alter a
prescription.  Nobody HAS to steal.  I didn't HAVE to drink.  I didn't HAVE

Even using and buying grass is different and nowhere NEAR the mere idea of
altering a script.  Grass' legality is rightfully being questioned and is a
more personal decision.  Altering a script is, aside from being illegal,
completely betraying a doctor, who might get his ass canned for having
written a script for an amount that HE DIDN'T WRITE!

We all make decisions, and weight the consequence against the gained relief.
We weight side effects against the help the med may give.  We decide whether
or not to try another person's med, or letting them try ours. (wrong, but
i've done it...and it can turn into an ugly, awkward dance.)  We weigh if we
should try alcohol to join in the fight against the pain.  But those
decisions involve us and our loved ones.

But the idea that a doctor is responsible for &quot;making&quot; a person change a
script because he didn't write it for enough in the first place?

Hi Lavon,

&quot;Make&quot; isn't the right word, but one can be &quot;driven&quot; to take illegal
actions by untreated severe pain

And while one should always take responsibility for one's actions, that
doesn't necessarily mean that others are totally blameless or that there
aren't mitigating circumstances in determining guilt, such as untreated
severe pain.

And, Your point is???

No one HAS to do anything!  But, pain is a great motivator!  Who said
that a doctor is responsible for what a patient steals from his
office? When you were buying marijuana were you as concerned for the
dealer you were buying from?  He's taking a MUCH bigger chance than
any doctor is.  Oh, but he's a criminal?Then what does that make YOU,
in buying from him? No, not just a criminal, but a criminal enabler!
If no one bought his wared,he would be guilty of only the much smaller
crime of possession.  And maybe he wouldn't possess as much-or any-if
it weren't for you, with your needy, pleading, desperate hand out!

Let me see?  You're trying to separate yourself from the 'convicts'.
Nothing new to me.  I've been discriminated against from day one, in
internet groups.  Did you happen to read my entire article?  Or, did
you just pick out the 'naughty points'?  You started to put your white
gloves on then remembered your own past.  So, you altered your
attitude' White boxing gloves!

Why is one drug 'right' and one 'wrong'?  I'd say make morphine legal
and over-the counter-if I had to chose any one drug. why?  Because
morphine has more of a proven track record against pain, than any
other drug!  You may argue for alcohol...but it has more negative side
effects, and does more damage to the internal organs. And, although
there are records of marijuana use that go almost as far back (OK,
maybe AS far-or further-I haven't checked every little thing out!) it
doesn't have such consistent records of success as a pain killer as
does morphine!  And, no, it had nothing to do with legality.  Making
drugs subject to doctor's prescriptions is a relatively new practice-
the major sweep in the US was in 1914.  And marijuana was NOT
included.  It wasn't made illegal by the federal government until
1936, although some states had laws against it.

But, you just HAVE to show your superiority-some way!  So, you can't
say you always used drugs as prescribed, you can't say that every drug
you took was legal, and legally prescribed for you!  Well, you're not
ME!!!!
Oh what if you drank up the dog's marijuana supply-you never forged
scripts!!!

And, why did you snip everything I said out of my post, then attack
me?  You just posted what I quoted from Sean's post, deleted what
said, and assumed I said a lot of things I didn't. .  Well, this whole
thread was started by Sean...concerning his blog.  And. I had
something to say.  You can argue that you did, too-but, I think you
started out to vindicate yourself, realized how little you had to
vindicate, and continued as a personal attack against me.

You claimed once that you thought of this group as your
'playground'.  Well, obviously, this threre isn't a very playful one.
And, your post hardly worked to make it more so.  Well, at least you
gave me the title for my post, when I make it, on my experience with
internet CP groups-'White Boxing Gloves'.  In fact, I wonder why you
don't join, or form a moderated group?  Because you can attack the
'criminals'-but, on this group, the criminals fight back! Oh-right.
You ARE a criminal-but only against the right laws(whatever that
means!)

Not according to some doctors. Both may be considered examples of drug

You were driven to break the rules out of necessity, just like someone
who forges a script. I personally don't regard either as some kind of
major crime. The real crime here is that people are forced to behave
this way by the medical/legal system in this country,  and as enforcers
of this system, I most definitely do blame doctors who give a person a
script for 10 Vicodin or refuse to treat pain at all. When they do
that, they are also making a choice for which they are morally
responsible, or are they absolved of any guilt simply by virtue of
being doctors? If doctors did not have a monopoly on pain meds and you
could easily obtain them anywhere, then forging a script would not be a
crime of necessity but would still be a minor crime in the grand scheme
of things.

But doctors do have a monopoly on the pain meds which many people need
to survive, and to deny them access to the thing they need to survive
is barbaric and insane, and doing what you have to do to survive such a
system, however desperate, makes all the sense in the world. It's like
blaming someone for trying to escape from a concentration camp because
they broke the rules. We should all be fighting to eliminate these
rules altogether, instead of lumping on people who break them out of
necessity.

">

That's highly unlikely, and I would submit that it was the doctor who
betrayed the patient in this instance. He took $1,600 from that patient
for an ER visit, or from that patient's insurance company, and gave
that person 10 Vicodin to shut him up. If a doctor accepts money and
doesn't deliver what he's being paid for, which is pain treatment, then
he is a thief as well.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We all make decisions, and weight the consequence against the gained relief.
&gt; We weight side effects against the help the med may give.  We decide whether
&gt; or not to try another person's med, or letting them try ours. (wrong, but
&gt; i've done it...and it can turn into an ugly, awkward dance.)  We weigh if we
&gt; should try alcohol to join in the fight against the pain.  But those
&gt; decisions involve us and our loved ones.

&gt; But the idea that a doctor is responsible for &quot;making&quot; a person change a
&gt; script because he didn't write it for enough in the first place?

&gt; no
">

So long as the medical profession maintains a monopoly on pain
medications, then yes, the doctor *is* mostly responsible. If you had a
10 year old kid in your house and refused to feed him or allow him to
go elsewhere to get food, and punished him whenever he tried to leave
the house to get food elsewhere or tried to get an adequate amount of
food off you, who would be responsible when the kid finally broke and
stole food off you, the kid, or you? Who is the real criminal, a kid
who steals food out of necessity, or the person who would deprive a kid
of food?

It is the *exact* same thing with the medical/legal system in this
country. Some people are deprived of access to pain medications, and
are also denied the right to go outside the system to get them even if
the system refuses to treat them or undertreats them, which is the norm
in this country. Like the kid trapped in that house, people can try to
convince their captors that they need more pain meds, but if they do
that too often they will be accused of being &quot;addicts&quot; and punished, so
it becomes a catch 22.

Eventually, for some, there is no other option than to break the rules
and try to get what they need elsewhere, which is illegal and results
in punishment, or forge a script and try to defeat the system, which is
also illegal and results in punishment. All options, of course, result
in punishment because having to writhe in agony is also a punishment.
That this is insane should be obvious on its face.

So what does a person do? The most natural thing in the world which is
to try and address the problem at hand the best way they can and hope
they don't get caught, just like that kid, who will eventually either
steal food or try to escape the house to avoid starvation.

&gt; I'm not denying there is a real problem when it comes to real people
&gt; in real pain.  I was just trying to give you a floor nurse's
&gt; perspective of one of the many reasons that people who present with
&gt; chronic pain, including myself, are looked at as drug-seekers even if
&gt; they're not.  These are the people who stick out in our minds and
&gt; memories....admitted 5 times in 3 months, staying 10-12 days at a
&gt; time, to get that fix and the level of drugs up high enough in the
&gt; bloodstream to keep them going for a week or two...then they come back
&gt; with another reason why they need more.  Pick at the peg tube till
&gt; it's draining and infected and you need IV antibiotics so you can get
&gt; your IV narcotics too - can't use the PEG tube because it's infected,
&gt; and for some reason oral pain meds just don't work right.  Come up
&gt; with reasons why it has to be a specific drug.

&gt; Even with a letter from my neurologist and approval from my pain
&gt; management specialist, I've been refused care at an emergency room
&gt; locally because they thought I was drug-seeking.  Never mind that I
&gt; have documented allergies to NSAID drugs, and that I'm already on
&gt; Methadone for my pain....they offered me Toradol, an NSAID, or
&gt; nothing.  They said they'd call the neurologist and talk to him, but
&gt; they weren't changing their minds.  Then they had the balls to bill me
&gt; for &quot;services rendered.&quot;  What services?  The laughing and talking
&gt; behind my back they didn't think I heard?  The snide comments?  The
&gt; implication that I wanted to get stoned?  The suggestion that even
&gt; with a pulse of 136 and a blood pressure of 147/110 I wasn't in pain?
&gt; Sure.  Let me run right to the bank and get your money.  Okay.  NOT!

&gt; It's like many other things in life...there are stereotypes or images
&gt; of a specific ethnic group, or income level, or education level, and
&gt; those stereotypes are formed because of the ones within that group
&gt; that make the most noise, the biggest negative impression, or raise
&gt; the most h*ll.  Take &quot;trailer trash.&quot;  I live in a mobile home.  It's
&gt; a singlewide.  We paid $25K for it new, all we could afford, after a
&gt; tornado ripped the roof off our heads while we were in the old place.
&gt; We're buying 4.2 acres of meticulously maintained rural land.  We have
&gt; landscaping hubby and I did, and a pond, and chickens, and trees, and
&gt; shrubs, and it's beautiful out here.  HOWEVER, when I was working, and
&gt; people found out I lived in a (gasp!) trailer, they immediately
&gt; thought it was a place with roaches scurrying about, soft floors,
&gt; peeling siding, and dark paneling.  They seemed to be shocked that I
&gt; was clean and my teeth were white.  They told me how foolish I was to
&gt; have a trailer on piers, and not on a foundation or basement, though
&gt; at the time that would have cost us an extra $12,500 that we didn't
&gt; have, so we did our best with what the insurance company gave us, and
&gt; this is the best we could do short of living in the garage.

&gt; See what I mean?

&gt; I know we all do stereotyping, and I know it's wrong.  However, we do
&gt; it because of specific individuals within people groups that we
&gt; encounter who leave a lasting impression on us, and that is where the
&gt; myth of the drug-seeker (or trailer trash, or junkie, or lazy-*ss
&gt; person on disability who could work if they just put their minds to it
&gt; and got their fat butts out of bed) comes from.  The numbers of all
&gt; these groups who genuinely take advantage of the system or live as the
&gt; stereotype imagines it is are very small indeed, but those few who
&gt; have made a major impression on us or whoever coins the catch phrase
&gt; make enough of an impression that it permeates our thoughts.

&gt; Ah, the benefits of mass media...

And this is kind of my point, really. Viewing so many people as drug
seekers is really the result of ignorance and bigotry, and is
unscientific. I can accept that doctors and nurses have encountered
people every bit as bad as they say, or who really did moan and groan
over that paper cut. But to treat everyone contemptuously and to deny
treatment to people on the basis of one's experiences with a handful of
people is simply uncivilized.

There are doctors out there who sell drugs, abuse drugs, sexually
harass and even rape their patients, and who commit murders, assuaults
and other crimes. Theft and fraud is epidemic in the medical system,
costing as much as $170 billion a year. That's $170,000 per year  per
doctor on average. On the whole, the medical system in this country is
incredibly corrupt, and I don't how much you got to see of that as a
nurse, but there's no arguing with the stats. Now I'm not trying to
lump them all in together as a bunch of crooks, but I suspect there are
a helluva lot more crooks and creeps in the medical profession,
percentage wise, then there are drug addicts among cp'ers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But facts are things that are readily discarded whenever they prove
&gt; &gt; &gt; inconvenient in the world of medicine, just as they are in the rest of
&gt; &gt; &gt; our world. Far better to cling to convenient half-truths and urban
&gt; &gt; &gt; legends if they make you doctors feel better about yourselves, because
&gt; &gt; &gt; after all, it's all about you. Most likely, there is at most a small
&gt; &gt; &gt; minority of pain patients who fall into the category of drug-seeker and
&gt; &gt; &gt; a very large majority of people with legitimate pain problems being
&gt; &gt; &gt; falsely accused of drug-seeking out of ignorance and bigotry. Many of
&gt; &gt; &gt; those people are forced into the role of drug-seeker by the very fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; that doctors are reluctant and unwilling to treat pain aggressively,
&gt; &gt; &gt; thus it becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. If a guy shows up in your
&gt; &gt; &gt; ER with excruciating pain and you give him 10 Vicodin, why are you
&gt; &gt; &gt; shocked that he would add a &quot;zero&quot; to the &quot;10?&quot; What choice did you
&gt; &gt; &gt; give him? Maybe if you had treated his pain appropriately with an
&gt; &gt; &gt; adequate amount of medication for the $1,600 he brought into your
&gt; &gt; &gt; hospital he wouldn't have had to do that.

&gt; &gt; Hey-don't I know it!!!

&gt; &gt; When I went into detox-in an attempt to shorten, or avoid my prison
&gt; &gt; sentence, I remember the phrase being used!  And the 'addiction
&gt; &gt; specialist' psychiatrist would often try to bring out the behavior in
&gt; &gt; me-to help me realize that I was an addict.  So, maybe it's been
&gt; &gt; taught for years.

&gt; &gt; When I got the flu, I remember this doctor always saying that he'd
&gt; &gt; prescribe some Tylenol and cough medicine for it...then 'forget' to do
&gt; &gt; it.  The nurses-all addiction specialists-were all too willing to
&gt; &gt; point out my;'drug-seeking behavior'.
&gt; &gt; Of course, there were no opiates there.  I only wanted relief for my
&gt; &gt; cough, and the minimal relief that Tylenol gave. But, it was still
&gt; &gt; drug-seeking behavior.

&gt; &gt; I was taught to act like an addict!

&gt; &gt; This is interesting!

&gt; &gt; I'll be working on my own article-'the making of a junkie' or
&gt; &gt; something like that.  Even before this, it was like the doctors were
&gt; &gt; waiting to be asked for some mild opiate.  And, they'd grudgingly give
&gt; &gt; it(at first).  But, when the time came when I became more of a
&gt; &gt; liability than an asset, they could cut me off with a clear
&gt; &gt; conscience.

&gt; &gt; Pseudoaddiction lives!

&gt; &gt; I kind of had an opposite epiphany like when a drug addict finally
&gt; &gt; admits his infirmity...the time my parole officer told me to see a
&gt; &gt; pain doctor.

&gt; &gt; Admittedly, this isn't a well thought-out post. I just had to say it.
&gt; &gt; You hit the nail on the head, Sean.  Doctors .
&gt; &gt; and law enforcement needed a measuring stick for the type of addict
&gt; &gt; who didn't fit the type that was alredy there..So, th birth of drug-
&gt; &gt; seeking?

&gt; &gt; Thanks, Sean.  If only we' been organized 17 years ago!

&gt; oh,,,it's up!

&gt; http://conditionpainful.blogspot.com/2007/09/making-of-junkie.html

&gt; Are Junkies born, or made?

&gt; Me, I suffer from Chronic Pain.  I have since I had the first of three
&gt; accidents-a fall down a flight of stairs-in 1979.  But, as opiates
&gt; were soon the only effective method of pain control, I soon had the
&gt; 'addict' label lurking over my head.  One doctor, an orthopedic
&gt; specialist, admitting that I was not getting better, used the fact to
&gt; stop giving me opiates and muscle relaxers.  Well, that made sense.
&gt; Since there was no getting better, there should be no  feeling better.

&gt; Still, I kept trying.  I went to different doctors;  I never got
&gt; anything stronger than Percocet and that, not for the chronic symptoms-
&gt; only when I had an acute condition,  did I get that rare chance at
&gt; relief.

&gt; I hit my late 30's.  I wasn't getting any younger.  And I felt even
&gt; older than I was.

&gt; Sometime after my 40th birthday, I saw a chance at relief; some
&gt; doctors left their prescription pads unattended, I began to notice.

&gt; Do I have to describe the next step?

&gt; But this isn't 'the Making of a Criminal'.  So, I skip to almost a
&gt; year later. After I've been caught.

&gt; My court-appointed lawyer advises me to check into my local hospital's
&gt; detox.  I have to wait; he says to make sure that I don't go in
&gt; 'clean'. I make it, all right.

&gt; By then, I've accepted the 'addict' label.  Fortunate for me, since
&gt; I'm going to be attending two to three Alcoholics Anonymous, or
&gt; Narcotics Anonymous meetings a day. Of course, that's where you
&gt; intrdouce yourself by your first name, and say I'm an
&gt; alcoholic(addict). Plus, classes by the 'addiction specialist' doctor,
&gt; ans similarly-trained nurses.

&gt; The first three days, I'm on methadone. Not for pain, but for detox
&gt; purposes.  I feel a sense of unreality; a kind of spaciness,  I want
&gt; to succeed; but, somehow, I know that I won't.

&gt; Throughout, I get the feeling that there's a difference between myself
&gt; and the other patients- I'm not better, or more deserving, or even
&gt; less of a drug fiend; still, I know that drugs will never be
&gt; eliminated from my life.  I get an inkling of what I mean, when I hear
&gt; myself ask the doctor, using a thought process that I'm just beginning
&gt; to reclaim, if I can go on methadone maintenance indefinitely; he
&gt; refuses angrily.  Later, he will say that he'll think abut it, but
&gt; it's never brought up again.

&gt; For the most part,I get along with the others...we all ourselves 'the
&gt; junkies'.  One thing they can't understand, though-two are even
&gt; angered by it; whenever we are told to 'talk of the pain' that is
&gt; exactly what I talk about-the actual, physical, pain, that I have,
&gt; every day, and probably always will.  In turn, they speak about
&gt; getting high...well, I've used alcohol, of course, and marijuana, for
&gt; that purpose...and, yes, some of the opiates I've been taking have
&gt; that effect, sometimes-but I don't have that overwhelming, impulsive
&gt; need to get high....just as they don't have the overwhelming,
&gt; impulsive need to take painkillers, when the have an ache or pain.

&gt; My name is Legend. I am a Chronic Pain Sufferer.

&gt; But, I get ahead of myself.

&gt; I ask the doctor to prescribe Tylenol for me, so that I can get rid of
&gt; some of the pain; he agrees, but keeps putting it off.  Soon, I also
&gt; have a case of the flu, along with a hacking cough; It is so bad, that
&gt; even my fellow inpatients, and the nurses, sympathize; yet, the doc is
&gt; slow in writing the script.

&gt; But, during one of my requests, at the nurses' station(where all meds
&gt; are handed out) I hear a term, now used quite often, for the very
&gt; first time; drug-seeking behavior!

&gt; Some kinds of junkies have to be made; and I'm one of them.

&gt; Now, I know, and so does everyone else, that I'm not going to get any
&gt; opiates, or remotely similar drugs, there; yet, it has been necessary
&gt; to put me through the paces...already, I strongly suspected some of
&gt; the doctors that I'd consulted, of knowing how bad my pain was, and
&gt; letting me wear the mantle of an addict, instead...it was the 'kinder'
&gt; approach-especially in the early 1980's, when I was still in my early
&gt; 30's...Better for me to think that I was in danger of having some
&gt; uncontrollable, impulsive, disease, than to know that relief is out
&gt; there, but no doctor is going to give it to me, as I needed it.
&gt; Doctors just weren't that stupid, they couldn't be.  Well, I guess
&gt; it's not for me to know.

&gt; So, 'drug-seeking behavior' safely pointed out, I was given my(non-
&gt; narcotic, of course) cough medicine, and regular Tylenol; by this
&gt; time, my stay is nearly over.  I'm even accepting things more, and
&gt; tell one of the NA group leaders that &quot;I'm just starting to think I'll
&gt; make it.&quot;

&gt; Well, I don't, but that's another story.  We skip ahead to a time
&gt; after I've done my prison time, but before I'm free to live as I
&gt; choose;  I have a new Parole Officer, and, even though I'm required to
&gt; attend a 'drug-free' rehab, outpatient, she notices that I'm in pain-
&gt; and insists that I see a pain specialist!

&gt; Well, hat's when the Hallelujah Chorus comes in-but  I've had to go
&gt; through all of this-just to be told what I already knew-I'm In Chronic
&gt; Pain.

&gt; For those who have never been to jail or prison, or under the threat-
&gt; there are few people, outside of libertarians  and  other ex-cons, who
&gt; will accept you, especially as a group;  as I mentioned in my previous
&gt; post, no, not even Chronic Pain Sufferers, as a group, will give
&gt; universal acceptance I;m usually regarded as someone who 'acted
&gt; outside the box', endangering other  Chronic Painer's Status with the
&gt; law, and the medical community.  I don't see my crime as something I
&gt; needed to do, or  couldn't have done without-but it did put me in a
&gt; place where I had no right to judge addicts for using drugs.
&gt; Something I think we should all think about, when  we're  living
&gt; through hard times, with insufficient medicine and other relief.
">

Great post, Legend. I really respect you for having the guts to write
that when you know many will refuse to accept it. It was  a really
powerful story and I don't know how much it will convince the
unconvinceable, but it meant a lot to me to read it, as it has
reinforced my opinion of drug seeking as a crime of necessity. I'm
going to try and leave a comment on your blog but I want to think about
my response.

&gt; Hi Lavon,

&gt; &quot;Make&quot; isn't the right word, but one can be &quot;driven&quot; to take illegal
&gt; actions by untreated severe pain

&gt; And while one should always take responsibility for one's actions, that
&gt; doesn't necessarily mean that others are totally blameless or that there
&gt; aren't mitigating circumstances in determining guilt, such as untreated
&gt; severe pain.

Howdy, Juba,

I agree that others actions, or inaction, can bring the situation to a boil.
Was mentally trying to parallel it to a martial affair.  What i do or don't
do can, certainly, create a ripe environment for my husband to go elsewhere
for intimacy.... in that case, i would take a share of the blame if he did.
I basically agree with that.   But the responsibility for him actually
getting into the sheets with another woman would be his.  I would be
responsible for the temptation to break his fealty, but not for the sin of
his embracing that temptation.

Word play?  Maybe.  I don't think a lot of us have the trusting openness
with our doctors that we have with our spouses.

Problem is, there is no true equal to a doctor's duty to deal with our pain.
My husband may be frustrated horribly to the point of looking longingly at a
shoe, but it still doesn't equate.  We end up dealing with doctors whom we
will never see again, i.e., ER docs, and we implore them to meet our pain
needs.   I guess, for some of us, its a little like a homeless person asking
us for $100....i get that analogy from the look in the ER docs' eyes when i
present my Dr's note and they see my dosages.   It's like i'm asking them to
do what is beyond my right, or their idea of right, to ask.   How do they
tell those who actually need the hundred bucks versus the folks that do
that, then go around the corner and get into their 2008 Porsche?   Aside
from some insufficient and flawed earmarks, it's a crap-shoot.

The ER doc is almost in the same position for us chronic painers.  Except
for the occasional oddity pain that doesn't fit into our usual pain
schedule, it is our primary care doc, or our pain doc,'s  responsibility to
address our pain (as i was told eight hundred times at a local ER when i was
in an ugly cycle once.)  Of course, all that &quot;responsibility&quot; talk doesn't
do us crap when we are at a 9.5'er and ready to do whatever it takes to end
the pain.  Does that &quot;whatever&quot; include changing a script?

See, i think it demeans us to say &quot;the doctor made me do it.&quot;  I've had
horrible treatment from doctors, and i did some horrible things in response.
But, although there is contributing factors to everything, the final
response, the final reply and how we react, are...and must be, within our
control....unless we are mentally ill and cannot function or reason.

Culpability?  Maybe that's a better word to bat around.  I dunno.

apply....and changing a script is wrong.

&gt; Not according to some doctors. Both may be considered examples of drug
&gt; seeking behavior.

&gt;&gt; &quot;What choice did you give him?  Maybe if you treated his pain
&gt;&gt; appropriately
&gt;&gt; with an adequate amount of medication for the $1600 he brought into your
&gt;&gt; hospital he wouldn't HAVE HAD to do that?&quot;

&gt;&gt; That's horse poopie!

&gt;&gt; when i was being undermedicated,  i went around to different Urgent Cares
&gt;&gt; trying to get extra meds.  I did things a patient shouldn't do.  And i
&gt;&gt; got
&gt;&gt; myself into trouble due to being undermedicated.  But nobody HAS to alter
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; prescription.  Nobody HAS to steal.  I didn't HAVE to drink.  I didn't
&gt;&gt; HAVE
&gt;&gt; to try my dog's medication.

&gt; You were driven to break the rules out of necessity, just like someone
&gt; who forges a script. I personally don't regard either as some kind of
&gt; major crime. The real crime here is that people are forced to behave
&gt; this way by the medical/legal system in this country,  and as enforcers
&gt; of this system, I most definitely do blame doctors who give a person a
&gt; script for 10 Vicodin or refuse to treat pain at all. When they do
&gt; that, they are also making a choice for which they are morally
&gt; responsible, or are they absolved of any guilt simply by virtue of
&gt; being doctors? If doctors did not have a monopoly on pain meds and you
&gt; could easily obtain them anywhere, then forging a script would not be a
&gt; crime of necessity but would still be a minor crime in the grand scheme
&gt; of things.

&gt; But doctors do have a monopoly on the pain meds which many people need
&gt; to survive, and to deny them access to the thing they need to survive
&gt; is barbaric and insane, and doing what you have to do to survive such a
&gt; system, however desperate, makes all the sense in the world. It's like
&gt; blaming someone for trying to escape from a concentration camp because
&gt; they broke the rules. We should all be fighting to eliminate these
&gt; rules altogether, instead of lumping on people who break them out of
&gt; necessity.

&gt;&gt; Even using and buying grass is different and nowhere NEAR the mere idea
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; altering a script.  Grass' legality is rightfully being questioned and is
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; more personal decision.  Altering a script is, aside from being illegal,
&gt;&gt; completely betraying a doctor, who might get his ass canned for having
&gt;&gt; written a script for an amount that HE DIDN'T WRITE!

&gt; That's highly unlikely, and I would submit that it was the doctor who
&gt; betrayed the patient in this instance. He took $1,600 from that patient
&gt; for an ER visit, or from that patient's insurance company, and gave
&gt; that person 10 Vicodin to shut him up. If a doctor accepts money and
&gt; doesn't deliver what he's being paid for, which is pain treatment, then
&gt; he is a thief as well.

&gt;&gt; We all make decisions, and weight the consequence against the gained
&gt;&gt; relief.
&gt;&gt; We weight side effects against the help the med may give.  We decide
&gt;&gt; whether
&gt;&gt; or not to try another person's med, or letting them try ours. (wrong, but
&gt;&gt; i've done it...and it can turn into an ugly, awkward dance.)  We weigh if
&gt;&gt; we
&gt;&gt; should try alcohol to join in the fight against the pain.  But those
&gt;&gt; decisions involve us and our loved ones.

&gt;&gt; But the idea that a doctor is responsible for &quot;making&quot; a person change a
&gt;&gt; script because he didn't write it for enough in the first place?

&gt;&gt; no

&gt; So long as the medical profession maintains a monopoly on pain
&gt; medications, then yes, the doctor *is* mostly responsible. If you had a
&gt; 10 year old kid in your house and refused to feed him or allow him to
&gt; go elsewhere to get food, and punished him whenever he tried to leave
&gt; the house to get food elsewhere or tried to get an adequate amount of
&gt; food off you, who would be responsible when the kid finally broke and
&gt; stole food off you, the kid, or you? Who is the real criminal, a kid
&gt; who steals food out of necessity, or the person who would deprive a kid
&gt; of food?

&gt; It is the *exact* same thing with the medical/legal system in this
&gt; country. Some people are deprived of access to pain medications, and
&gt; are also denied the right to go outside the system to get them even if
&gt; the system refuses to treat them or undertreats them, which is the norm
&gt; in this country. Like the kid trapped in that house, people can try to
&gt; convince their captors that they need more pain meds, but if they do
&gt; that too often they will be accused of being &quot;addicts&quot; and punished, so
&gt; it becomes a catch 22.

&gt; Eventually, for some, there is no other option than to break the rules
&gt; and try to get what they need elsewhere, which is illegal and results
&gt; in punishment, or forge a script and try to defeat the system, which is
&gt; also illegal and results in punishment. All options, of course, result
&gt; in punishment because having to writhe in agony is also a punishment.
&gt; That this is insane should be obvious on its face.

&gt; So what does a person do? The most natural thing in the world which is
&gt; to try and address the problem at hand the best way they can and hope
&gt; they don't get caught, just like that kid, who will eventually either
&gt; steal food or try to escape the house to avoid starvation.

Kids do not do what adults do.  They have limited means and are less
culpable for what they do, and rightly so.

If i pay my housecleaner with a check, and she needs more money than that to
feed her kid that week, is it not wrong for her to alter my check and make
it for more?  I am not her main source of income, and neither is an ER doc a
main source of pain management.  it is not the fault of the ER doc that the
person needed 100 Vicodin.

A person given a 10 Vicodin script from an ER doc but expecting 100,  is
basically like a person who expects to be able to do their once-a-month
shopping from a 7-11.  I realize that some folks do not have sympathetic
primary care docs or pain docs.  I've been there.

I guess the main question i have with this situation is, if caught, does the
person who alters the script expect to not have to be held legally
responsible?

deep peace,
Lavon

See what I mean, Sean?

At least I Thought up a good post title...White Boxing Gloves!

Which I haven't written yet, being that I've been quite sick-but
anyhow, my contacts with online groups-the ones that are moderated-
have been like this, all along.
Here, it wasn't that bad, as it was mainly one person (Wolfie, using
another nym), and some people, while not actually standing up for me,
did sympathize.  But no Yahoo group showed any 'mercy'...I got the
most support, in fact, from the message board of the drug Policy
Alliance.  And, at the time, I think there was only one other
CP'er and he was using marijuana for his pain.

So,ex-cons are discriminated against...did you see, I never said a
word in defense of prescription forging-just used my own experience to
show how a Chronic Pain sufferer can be demoralized, and led to think
a certain way.  I don't know if you ever read the particulars, but I
(actually my lawyer) bargained for me to go to an inmate rehab,that
was a sort of bootcamp.  It didn't require as much rigors as some
programs, but enough for me to have a nervous breakdown.  And really,
if it hadn't already been set up, the prison system wouldn't have sent
me, as I was told-on the first day of processing (All women prisoners
in New York have to be processed thru Bedford Hills-I know, I never
said it before, but Sean has lived in New York, and may be familiar
with the area).

Lavon reasoned that it was because I broke the law, quickly changing
it to a vague break in the trust of the doctor-patient bond-which she
broke, too. I think that people are programmed to think that only
'bad' people go to prison-that, somehow, the good ones get out of I,
even when guilty.  It sucks that people think that way!

In fact, I was pretty quiet about this, until the Rush Limbaugh
incident,  Then, I knew, if he got out of it, it would be because of
his money-nothing else.  and e probably wouldn't even lose his job.

Of course, that came true-even better than I predicted.  I do
remember, one CP advocate, active in the Yahoo groups, who found a
letter from Limbaugh's lawyer, asking CP'ers to write in.  When it
looked as if he wasn't going to have to become a poster boy for pain,
that he could be easily be accepted as another recovering celebrity
addict, I was all but begging the advocate to use me!  I was right
there, willing to share the details, and, by that time, had a real
diagnosis of neuropathy and complications from the accident I
mentioned plus 3 others.  The guy sort of hedged, then disappeared
from the internet, entirely.

I was kicked out of one CP group by a real character.  I was warned
about him, when I first mentioned my prison time, by a woman who was
fairly sympathetic to my needs.  I didn't post again, for about a
week.  When I posted again, I got banned.  No warning, nothing.  just
my second post.  I wrote to the guy,first asking him why.  he said
something about the internet pharmacies. But-when my friend wrote to
me again, she provided parts of the group-which showed that I had
never mentioned online pharmacies. I think I mentioned them on the DPA
message board, or some other open forum, hence the confusion.

I wrote back-this time I was angry-saying that I'd been warned about
him, and that I'd never written what he said. What followed was
bizarre.  He started a thread entitled 'Am I Hated?' and started to
flame me vigorously. I rejoined the group, using another yahoo ID.
This was too much to miss!  Especially when he started to use my real
name, and tell people that if they agreed with me, he'd delete the
group. Of course, they replied like good little clones (although they
couldn't, for the life of them, figure why I'd been kicked out) that
he was wanted, needed, and thy]ey wanted the group to stay!  Which was
the real issue-although none would dare say it to is face.

Love my group, love me.  Or else.

I kind of digressed.  But, tthis guy's attitude was not uncommon.  On
another group, I was removed the day I announced a fellow group
member's suicide. And not a mention was made of why I didn't answer
any of their posts of condolence.

It seems that these groups an their leaders have a zealous need to
separate themselves from addiction and crime in all forms.  And, if
you've actually done time, you HAVE to be an addict! The alternative
is just too much to bear!
Well,I've ranted on, i better go.  I did make the point,or start
to...having gone to pison put me in the unique position of  not being
able to judge a person for being an addict.

And, I don't

&gt; &gt; Hi Lavon,

&gt; &gt; &quot;Make&quot; isn't the right word, but one can be &quot;driven&quot; to take illegal
&gt; &gt; actions by untreated severe pain

&gt; &gt; And while one should always take responsibility for one's actions, that
&gt; &gt; doesn't necessarily mean that others are totally blameless or that there
&gt; &gt; aren't mitigating circumstances in determining guilt, such as untreated

Sean, and make up with Juba? What do you think you're doing? If you
have any integrity at all, you 'll answer me, before this becomes more
embarrassing to you!

I don't understand it! You KNEW that I had been in prison-and why. but
you chose now, when I have published a blog, to attack me-using
someone else's words-which were never meant to apply to my situation,
alone-to launch an attack. Did you read, also, that I may need
surgery? If you read so well, I guess it doesn't matter to you.

Do you remember calling me one of thegood ones.or something like that?
well, when did I change? I'm the same person that I was then, so you
must have been lying then. I;m sure I'm still friends with OG, Wayne,
and many others you call-or called -friends

But if all you can see are prison stripes (women in New York prisons
wear green), I guess it;s just not worth trying to get you to see
reason. You're a fair-weather friend, willing to use a person in pain
to make a point.

&gt;&gt;&gt; minority of pain patients who fall into the category of drug-seeker and
&gt;&gt;&gt; a very large majority of people with legitimate pain problems being
&gt;&gt;&gt; falsely accused of drug-seeking out of ignorance and bigotry. Many of
&gt;&gt;&gt; those people are forced into the role of drug-seeker by the very fact
&gt;&gt;&gt; that doctors are reluctant and unwilling to treat pain aggressively,
&gt;&gt;&gt; thus it becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. If a guy shows up in your
&gt;&gt;&gt; ER with excruciating pain and you give him 10 Vicodin, why are you
&gt;&gt;&gt; shocked that he would add a &quot;zero&quot; to the &quot;10?&quot; What choice did you
&gt;&gt;&gt; give him? Maybe if you had treated his pain appropriately with an
&gt;&gt;&gt; adequate amount of medication for the $1,600 he brought into your
&gt;&gt;&gt; hospital he wouldn't have had to do that.

&gt; WAIT!  wait, wait, wait.....

&gt; There is a difference between seeking more pain meds cuz a pain patient is
&gt; being under-treated and ALTERING A PRESCRIPTION!!!!

&gt; &quot;What choice did you give him?  Maybe if you treated his pain appropriately
&gt; with an adequate amount of medication for the $1600 he brought into your
&gt; hospital he wouldn't HAVE HAD to do that?&quot;

&gt; That's horse poopie!

&gt; when i was being undermedicated,  i went around to different Urgent Cares
&gt; trying to get extra meds.  I did things a patient shouldn't do.  And i got
&gt; myself into trouble due to being undermedicated.  But nobody HAS to alter a
&gt; prescription.  Nobody HAS to steal.  I didn't HAVE to drink.  I didn't HAVE
&gt; to try my dog's medication.

&gt; Even using and buying grass is different and nowhere NEAR the mere idea of
&gt; altering a script.  Grass' legality is rightfully being questioned and is a
&gt; more personal decision.  Altering a script is, aside from being illegal,
&gt; completely betraying a doctor, who might get his ass canned for having
&gt; written a script for an amount that HE DIDN'T WRITE!

&gt; We all make decisions, and weight the consequence against the gained relief.
&gt; We weight side effects against the help the med may give.  We decide whether
&gt; or not to try another person's med, or letting them try ours. (wrong, but
&gt; i've done it...and it can turn into an ugly, awkward dance.)  We weigh if we
&gt; should try alcohol to join in the fight against the pain.  But those
&gt; decisions involve us and our loved ones.

&gt; But the idea that a doctor is responsible for &quot;making&quot; a person change a
&gt; script because he didn't write it for enough in the first place?

&gt; no

&gt; &lt;sigh&gt;

It's not really ignorance.  It is bigotry.  I will agree with that.
It's the cumulation of outstanding and memorable experiences.  As an
oncology nurse I witnessed the death of hundreds of people, but only a
handful stand out in my mind 10 years after leaving that field.  They
were different.  Mostly good different, but different nonetheless.

I agree it's uncivilized, but our society seems to be heading in that
direction anyhow.  Witness road rage.  Where has traffic courtesy
gone?  How about the Visa commericals where people paying with cash
are looked at as holding the line up?  It's not so much about being
kind or considerate any more...it's each man/woman for themselves,
and, yes, that has invaded healthcare just like everything else, and
it sucks.  I can't argue that point.  It also sucks when I go to the
grocery store and the cashier acts like she's doing me a favor by

Again, point taken.  However, the loud obnoxious ones are the ones
that make an impression, and they taint the memory and attitude, and
it rolls over to the next person in chronic pain, and if you're
already overstaffed and having a bad day, you get cranky and short and
take it out on someone who doesn't deserve it.  I'm not justifying
it.  There is no justification.  None at all.  We need to take each
and every person at face value.  But we don't.  And it's not the good
nurses and doctors that get the kudos...it's the jerks and idiots and
creeps that treat people like objects that make the news.  I know lots
of nurses, including myself when I was still able to work, who
treat(ed) patients in pain with dignity and humanity and respect.
There are many, many of them out there who truly care about a patient
who is hurting and who do whatever they have to do to get the pain
under control, even if it means fighting with an arrogant doctor at 3
in the morning until he gives the order for the medication the patient
needs.  And yes, I've done that.  I've gotten docs so mad they got out
of bed and came in to see for themselves that I was telling the
truth.  That doctor ate his words because he had nicked the patient's
liver during surgery and I saved his life because he was bleeding to
death.  But do you hear about those nurses?  Nope...not often enough.
You hear about the ones who act like they never learned a social skill
in their lives.

The whole thing sucks.  I can't agree more.  However, my original
point stands...there are, indeed, drug-seeking patients, and they
raise hell till they get what they want, and they hospital-hop, and
the docs will eventually treat them to shut them up, and they are the
ones that leave the impression on people and make them wary of
dispensing pain medication to people who truly need it for relief and
not for a buzz or a high.  It's not right.  I won't argue that.  But
that's how it goes.

Hi Trisha,

I really liked your response. It is very balanced, and I think you have
a unique perspective having been on both sides of the prescription pad.
I would like to post this article as is on the blog, with my remarks
and your response to them, as I think it makes an excellent middle of
the road viewpoint between those expressed in my article and those of
doctors like Scalpel. I will probably add some commentary at the
beginning to clarify my position and also to offer my opinion on what
you wrote. Would that be okay with you? I am up late with severe pain
and cramping but will do it tomorrow if you approve.

Thanks,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; adequate amount of medication for the $1,600 he brought into your
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; hospital he wouldn't have had to do that.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hey-don't I know it!!!

&gt; &gt;&gt; When I went into detox-in an attempt to shorten, or avoid my prison
&gt; &gt;&gt; sentence, I remember the phrase being used!  And the 'addiction
&gt; &gt;&gt; specialist' psychiatrist would often try to bring out the behavior in
&gt; &gt;&gt; me-to help me realize that I was an addict.  So, maybe it's been
&gt; &gt;&gt; taught for years.

&gt; &gt;The term &quot;drug-seeker&quot; is something that's been around for years, but I
&gt; &gt;think it's a term doctors tend to use more than us. There is an
&gt; &gt;interesting piece from the BMJ of 1969 where a British doctor is
&gt; &gt;talking about a patient he feels is a drug-seeker. Though he doesn't
&gt; &gt;use the term per se, he describes the patient as &quot;seeking drugs&quot; &quot;Drug
&gt; &gt;Seeker&quot; is name of the title.

&gt; &gt;Note how he talks about &quot;characteristics that make him easily
&gt; &gt;recognizable.&quot; (Like that he has pain and needs treatment).

&gt; &gt;The patient in turn expresses the opinion that no one believes he's in
&gt; &gt;pain, and tries, to no avail, to appeal to the doctor's conscience only
&gt; &gt;to dismissed with a subtle but nonetheless contemptuous accusation of
&gt; &gt;sympathy-seeking. The doctor also violates his confidentiality by
&gt; &gt;printing his name in a medical journal.

&gt; &gt;The more things change, the more they stay the same.

&gt; &gt; http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pagerender.fcgi?artid=1629645&amp;pageindex;
&gt; &gt;=1

&gt; &gt;&gt; When I got the flu, I remember this doctor always saying that he'd
&gt; &gt;&gt; prescribe some Tylenol and cough medicine for it...then 'forget' to do
&gt; &gt;&gt; it.  The nurses-all addiction specialists-were all too willing to
&gt; &gt;&gt; point out my;'drug-seeking behavior'.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, there were no opiates there.  I only wanted relief for my
&gt; &gt;&gt; cough, and the minimal relief that Tylenol gave. But, it was still
&gt; &gt;&gt; drug-seeking behavior.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I was taught to act like an addict!

&gt; &gt;&gt; This is interesting!

&gt; &gt;This is not surprising, as drug-seeking is essentially an iatrogenic
&gt; &gt;problem. If people could just treat themselves without having to go to
&gt; &gt;a doctor, there would be no &quot;seeking&quot; at all. Seeking arises entirely
&gt; &gt;out of the draconian and barbaric system set up by the doctors and the
&gt; &gt;drug warriors to protect their monopoly and keep drug prices
&gt; &gt;artificially inflated.

&gt; &gt;If we had a system where you had to go to a guy in a white coat and
&gt; &gt;prove that you were hungry before you could get something to eat, I
&gt; &gt;suspect &quot;food-seeking&quot; behavior would start to emerge pretty quickly as
&gt; &gt;well. In fact if you read the accounts of famines and the desperate
&gt; &gt;measures people resort to to get food, such as killing and eating each
&gt; &gt;other, drug seeking begins to look pretty tame in comparison. It is
&gt; &gt;normal, natural and utterly predicatable that if you deprive human
&gt; &gt;beings of something they need to survive, they will react in certain
&gt; &gt;ways. To drive people to behave like this is utterly barbaric and
&gt; &gt;insane.

&gt; &gt;I could just imagine how this would work: if you wwere fat, you would
&gt; &gt;be told you are already receiving excessive food, and we are not going
&gt; &gt;to give you any more. If you were skinny, you would be told there is no
&gt; &gt;evidence that food is working for you, and you'd be denied on those
&gt; &gt;grounds. I suspect the power-tripping, arrogance, and contemptuous
&gt; &gt;attitudes displayed to be identical to what we see as pain patients.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I'll be working on my own article-'the making of a junkie' or
&gt; &gt;&gt; something like that.  Even before this, it was like the doctors were
&gt; &gt;&gt; waiting to be asked for some mild opiate.  And, they'd grudgingly give
&gt; &gt;&gt; it(at first).  But, when the time came when I became more of a
&gt; &gt;&gt; liability than an asset, they could cut me off with a clear
&gt; &gt;&gt; conscience.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Pseudoaddiction lives!

&gt; &gt;&gt; I kind of had an opposite epiphany like when a drug addict finally
&gt; &gt;&gt; admits his infirmity...the time my parole officer told me to see a
&gt; &gt;&gt; pain doctor.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Admittedly, this isn't a well thought-out post. I just had to say it.
&gt; &gt;&gt; You hit the nail on the head, Sean.  Doctors .
&gt; &gt;&gt; and law enforcement needed a measuring stick for the type of addict
&gt; &gt;&gt; who didn't fit the type that was alredy there..So, th birth of drug-
&gt; &gt;&gt; seeking?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks, Sean.  If only we' been organized 17 years ago!

&gt; &gt;I'm looking forward to reading your article as I have seen your site
&gt; &gt;and you have some very good points that need to be made.

&gt; &gt;--Sean C

&gt; I'm looking forward to reading it too Legend!

&gt; Sean, I love the comparison you made between drug
&gt; seeking and seeking food. I'd think that ANYONE could
&gt; &quot;get it&quot; after reading that!

&gt; If only we could get this sort of common (uncommon) sense
&gt; distributed, perhaps there would be a change...I just hope
&gt; it's in my lifetime, but I'm not betting on it.

Thanks, it's up

http://conditionpainful.blogspot.com/2007/09/making-of-junkie.html

seriously...thank you...though I haven't started working on the next
one, on internet prejudice, yet.
to the rest of you, who have been supportive (and those who haven't-
it's good to rxchange ideas there,as well as ere): I really hope you
visit there-please, I need some comments!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Howdy, Juba,

&gt; I agree that others actions, or inaction, can bring the situation to
&gt; a boil. Was mentally trying to parallel it to a martial affair.  What
&gt; i do or don't do can, certainly, create a ripe environment for my
&gt; husband to go elsewhere for intimacy.... in that case, i would take a
&gt; share of the blame if he did. I basically agree with that.   But the
&gt; responsibility for him actually getting into the sheets with another
&gt; woman would be his.  I would be responsible for the temptation to
&gt; break his fealty, but not for the sin of his embracing that
&gt; temptation.
&gt; Word play?  Maybe.  I don't think a lot of us have the trusting
&gt; openness with our doctors that we have with our spouses.

&gt; Problem is, there is no true equal to a doctor's duty to deal with
&gt; our pain. My husband may be frustrated horribly to the point of
&gt; looking longingly at a shoe, but it still doesn't equate.  We end up
&gt; dealing with doctors whom we will never see again, i.e., ER docs, and
&gt; we implore them to meet our pain needs.   I guess, for some of us,
&gt; its a little like a homeless person asking us for $100....i get that
&gt; analogy from the look in the ER docs' eyes when i present my Dr's
&gt; note and they see my dosages.   It's like i'm asking them to do what
&gt; is beyond my right, or their idea of right, to ask.   How do they
&gt; tell those who actually need the hundred bucks versus the folks that
&gt; do that, then go around the corner and get into their 2008 Porsche?
&gt; Aside from some insufficient and flawed earmarks, it's a crap-shoot.
&gt; The ER doc is almost in the same position for us chronic painers.
&gt; Except for the occasional oddity pain that doesn't fit into our usual
&gt; pain schedule, it is our primary care doc, or our pain doc,'s
&gt; responsibility to address our pain (as i was told eight hundred times
&gt; at a local ER when i was in an ugly cycle once.)  Of course, all that
&gt; &quot;responsibility&quot; talk doesn't do us crap when we are at a 9.5'er and
&gt; ready to do whatever it takes to end the pain.  Does that &quot;whatever&quot;
&gt; include changing a script?
&gt; See, i think it demeans us to say &quot;the doctor made me do it.&quot;  I've
&gt; had horrible treatment from doctors, and i did some horrible things
&gt; in response. But, although there is contributing factors to
&gt; everything, the final response, the final reply and how we react,
&gt; are...and must be, within our control....unless we are mentally ill
&gt; and cannot function or reason.
&gt; Culpability?  Maybe that's a better word to bat around.  I dunno.

&gt; I get and agree that there are contributing factors when a pain
&gt; patient colors outside of the lines to get pain relief.  But right
&gt; and wrong still apply....and changing a script is wrong.

&gt; This is quite refreshing sword play, Juba!
">

I dunno. I've been reading this thread develop with increasing dismay.
It is very unfortunate the way that some people manage to personalize
everything. You were commenting on the big picture, but they decided
that they were being attacked personally and so they turned into a drama
queen about it. Then comes the reference to you being friendly with me,
as if that explains why you would dare to criticize the one who enjoys
wearing the &quot;hair shirt&quot; of a convicted felon as if it were a badge of
honor.

At the risk of getting &quot;certain people&quot; even more worked up, I am going
to attempt to clarify your remarks for those who have had some
difficulty understanding their intent, which was quite obvious to me.

I think your post can be summed-up in the following two quotes:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There is a difference between seeking more pain meds cuz a pain
&gt; patient is being under-treated and ALTERING A PRESCRIPTION!!!!
&gt; But the idea that a doctor is responsible for &quot;making&quot; a person
&gt; change a script because he didn't write it for enough in the first
&gt; place?
&gt; no
">

I really don't see what the problem is. Who is going to disagree with
the above? No one actually did, but somehow it it got turned into
something it was not. Do you need to define what this is not, just for
those who insist on reading things into it? Well, you shouldn't have to.
And likewise you shouldn't be expected to answer people who demand that
you disavow what you've said because (they claim) otherwise your
&quot;integrity&quot; is at stake.

Now that I've come to your aid--so to speak--certain people will likely
make further assumptions about our relationship in order to demonize and
undercut you. For your sake, I will point out that it goes no further
than our being friendly and respectful to each other in this medium and
that we have never had email contact.

Thanks, Top...i do think i erred in not reading the entire thread before
posting on it.  That's harder to do on chronic-pain than it is on ASHM.  I
just read Sean's reply, which stated something i disagreed with.

&gt; And, Your point is???

&gt; No one HAS to do anything!  But, pain is a great motivator!  Who said
&gt; that a doctor is responsible for what a patient steals from his
&gt; office? When you were buying marijuana were you as concerned for the
&gt; dealer you were buying from?  He's taking a MUCH bigger chance than
&gt; any doctor is.  Oh, but he's a criminal?Then what does that make YOU,
&gt; in buying from him? No, not just a criminal, but a criminal enabler!
&gt; If no one bought his wared,he would be guilty of only the much smaller
&gt; crime of possession.  And maybe he wouldn't possess as much-or any-if
&gt; it weren't for you, with your needy, pleading, desperate hand out!

When did i buy marijuana?  But you are using the &quot;it's the buyer's fault

Sweetheart, i don't know how you've been treated on other internet groups.
Funny, but i don't consider myself as &quot;treated&quot; on any group i participate
in.  My post was in now way a personal attack.  It was never meant as an
attack, and, due to my not reading the whole thread, i didn't even know that
the quote was yours.  My newsgroup reader shows Sean as the original poster.

However, knowing who said it would not change what i said.

We all do wrong.  I probably do much more wrong than you'll ever consider.
This flesh lump is not above anybody.  I have broken laws, i have harmed
people, betrayed friends and loved ones and put lots of people at risk in
different levels.  You forget that i am a recovering addict also.  I am as
much a junkie as anyone who'd be stereotyped as such due to clothing and
loss of address.   No, i've not relapsed, and don't seem to have any craving
since my pain has been quieted to a level i can handle.  Even with the oral
Fentanyl gone, i've not seeked other means.  But, had i done so, it would be
me who had done the deed....not the insurance who has denied the payment of
the medication.

&gt; Why is one drug 'right' and one 'wrong'?  I'd say make morphine legal
&gt; and over-the counter-if I had to chose any one drug. why?  Because
&gt; morphine has more of a proven track record against pain, than any
&gt; other drug!  You may argue for alcohol...but it has more negative side
&gt; effects, and does more damage to the internal organs. And, although
&gt; there are records of marijuana use that go almost as far back (OK,
&gt; maybe AS far-or further-I haven't checked every little thing out!) it
&gt; doesn't have such consistent records of success as a pain killer as
&gt; does morphine!  And, no, it had nothing to do with legality.  Making
&gt; drugs subject to doctor's prescriptions is a relatively new practice-
&gt; the major sweep in the US was in 1914.  And marijuana was NOT
&gt; included.  It wasn't made illegal by the federal government until
&gt; 1936, although some states had laws against it.

&gt; But, you just HAVE to show your superiority-some way!  So, you can't
&gt; say you always used drugs as prescribed, you can't say that every drug
&gt; you took was legal, and legally prescribed for you!  Well, you're not

As i stated before, i have done plenty that could have landed my ass in
jail.  I don't consider your actions any worse than anything i have done, or
will do.  I'm superior?!?!?!?!  Since when?  It isn't who i am or who you
are.  The statement was that what was done was the fault of the doctor who
didn't write the script for enough meds. In taking another person's med, i
put her and my doctor at risk.  What i did was illegal, but i didn't HAVE to
do it.  It wasn't anyone's fault but my own.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; WAIT!  wait, wait, wait.....

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; There is a difference between seeking more pain meds cuz a pain
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; patient is being under-treated and ALTERING A PRESCRIPTION!!!!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;What choice did you give him?  Maybe if you treated his pain
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; appropriately with an adequate amount of medication for the $1600 he
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; brought into your hospital he wouldn't HAVE HAD to do that?&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That's horse poopie!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; when i was being undermedicated,  i went around to different Urgent
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cares trying to get extra meds.  I did things a patient shouldn't do.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; And i got myself into trouble due to being undermedicated.  But
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; nobody HAS to alter a prescription.  Nobody HAS to steal.  I didn't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; HAVE to drink.  I didn't HAVE to try my dog's medication.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Even using and buying grass is different and nowhere NEAR the mere
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; idea of altering a script.  Grass' legality is rightfully being
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; questioned and is a more personal decision.  Altering a script is,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; aside from being illegal, completely betraying a doctor, who might
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; get his ass canned for having written a script for an amount that HE
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; DIDN'T WRITE!
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; We all make decisions, and weight the consequence against the gained
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; relief. We weight side effects against the help the med may give.  We
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; decide whether or not to try another person's med, or letting them
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; try ours. (wrong, but i've done it...and it can turn into an ugly,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; awkward dance.)  We weigh if we should try alcohol to join in the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fight against the pain.  But those decisions involve us and our loved
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ones.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But the idea that a doctor is responsible for &quot;making&quot; a person
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; change a script because he didn't write it for enough in the first
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; place?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; no

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Lavon,

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Make&quot; isn't the right word, but one can be &quot;driven&quot; to take illegal
&gt;&gt; &gt; actions by untreated severe pain

&gt;&gt; &gt; And while one should always take responsibility for one's actions, that
&gt;&gt; &gt; doesn't necessarily mean that others are totally blameless or that
&gt;&gt; &gt; there
&gt;&gt; &gt; aren't mitigating circumstances in determining guilt, such as untreated
&gt;&gt; &gt; severe pain.

&gt;&gt; &gt; --
&gt;&gt; &gt; Juba
&gt;&gt; &gt; www.masterjuba.com

&gt;&gt; Howdy, Juba,

&gt;&gt; I agree that others actions, or inaction, can bring the situation to a
&gt;&gt; boil.
&gt;&gt; Was mentally trying to parallel it to a martial affair.  What i do or
&gt;&gt; don't
&gt;&gt; do can, certainly, create a ripe environment for my husband to go
&gt;&gt; elsewhere
&gt;&gt; for intimacy.... in that case, i would take a share of the blame if he
&gt;&gt; did.
&gt;&gt; I basically agree with that.   But the responsibility for him actually
&gt;&gt; getting into the sheets with another woman would be his.  I would be
&gt;&gt; responsible for the temptation to break his fealty, but not for the sin
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; h
&gt; is embracing that temptation.

&gt;&gt; Word play?  Maybe.  I don't think a lot of us have the trusting openness
&gt;&gt; with our doctors that we have with our spouses.

&gt;&gt; Problem is, there is no true equal to a doctor's duty to deal with our
&gt;&gt; pain.
&gt;&gt; My husband may be frustrated horribly to the point of looking longingly
&gt;&gt; at a
&gt;&gt; shoe, but it still doesn't equate.  We end up dealing with doctors whom
&gt;&gt; we
&gt;&gt; will never see again, i.e., ER docs, and we implore them to meet our pain
&gt;&gt; needs.   I guess, for some of us, its a little like a homeless person
&gt;&gt; asking
&gt;&gt; us for $100....i get that analogy from the look in the ER docs' eyes when
&gt;&gt; i
&gt;&gt; present my Dr's note and they see my dosages.   It's like i'm asking them
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; do what is beyond my right, or their idea of right, to ask.   How do they
&gt;&gt; tell those who actually need the hundred bucks versus the folks that do
&gt;&gt; that, then go around the corner and get into their 2008 Porsche?   Aside
&gt;&gt; from some insufficient and flawed earmarks, it's a crap-shoot.

&gt;&gt; The ER doc is almost in the same position for us chronic painers.  Except
&gt;&gt; for the occasional oddity pain that doesn't fit into our usual pain
&gt;&gt; schedule, it is our primary care doc, or our pain doc,'s  responsibility
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; address our pain (as i was told eight hundred times at a local ER when i
&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt; in an ugly cycle once.)  Of course, all that &quot;responsibility&quot; talk
&gt;&gt; doesn't
&gt;&gt; do us crap when we are at a 9.5'er and ready to do whatever it takes to
&gt;&gt; end
&gt;&gt; the pain.  Does that &quot;whatever&quot; include changing a script?

&gt;&gt; See, i think it demeans us to say &quot;the doctor made me do it.&quot;  I've had
&gt;&gt; horrible treatment from doctors, and i did some horrible things in
&gt;&gt; response.
&gt;&gt; But, although there is contributing factors to everything, the final
&gt;&gt; response, the final reply and how we react, are...and must be, within our
&gt;&gt; control....unless we are mentally ill and cannot function or reason.

&gt;&gt; Culpability?  Maybe that's a better word to bat around.  I dunno.

&gt;&gt; I get and agree that there are contributing factors when a pain patient
&gt;&gt; colors outside of the lines to get pain relief.  But right and wrong
&gt;&gt; still
&gt;&gt; apply....and changing a script is wrong.

&gt;&gt; This is quite refreshing sword play, Juba!

&gt; Lavon',

&gt; This puts you in an unusual position.  You attack me, quoting only
&gt; Sean, and make up with Juba? What do you think you're doing? If you

Frankly, Legend, i did not know you'd been to prison.  Either i forgot or,
in the blur of the meds i'm stuck with currently, it did not enter into what

you.  Can't imagine the scarring that must have caused your heart.   I also
didn't remember about your surgery.  I'm saddened that you have to go
through that and will pray, if ya don't mind, for it to heal your pain and
give you a better quality of life..

i have no personal issues with you.  i don't reply or post one thing to one

an issue.  i don't see folks with good and bad hues.  thru my eyes, we are

I use a lot of verbal affection, and i do it for the reasons i stated above.
It is never empty or done lightly.  My affection for you is the same is has

&gt;&gt; This is quite refreshing sword play, Juba!

&gt; I dunno. I've been reading this thread develop with increasing dismay. It
&gt; is very unfortunate the way that some people manage to personalize
&gt; everything. You were commenting on the big picture, but they decided that
&gt; they were being attacked personally and so they turned into a drama queen
&gt; about it. Then comes the reference to you being friendly with me, as if
&gt; that explains why you would dare to criticize the one who enjoys wearing
&gt; the &quot;hair shirt&quot; of a convicted felon as if it were a badge of honor.

&gt; At the risk of getting &quot;certain people&quot; even more worked up, I am going to
&gt; attempt to clarify your remarks for those who have had some difficulty
&gt; understanding their intent, which was quite obvious to me.

&gt; I think your post can be summed-up in the following two quotes:

&gt;&gt; There is a difference between seeking more pain meds cuz a pain
&gt;&gt; patient is being under-treated and ALTERING A PRESCRIPTION!!!!

&gt;&gt; But the idea that a doctor is responsible for &quot;making&quot; a person
&gt;&gt; change a script because he didn't write it for enough in the first
&gt;&gt; place?
&gt;&gt; no

&gt; I really don't see what the problem is. Who is going to disagree with the
&gt; above? No one actually did, but somehow it it got turned into something it
&gt; was not. Do you need to define what this is not, just for those who insist
&gt; on reading things into it? Well, you shouldn't have to. And likewise you
&gt; shouldn't be expected to answer people who demand that you disavow what
&gt; you've said because (they claim) otherwise your &quot;integrity&quot; is at stake.

&gt; Now that I've come to your aid--so to speak--certain people will likely
&gt; make further assumptions about our relationship in order to demonize and
&gt; undercut you. For your sake, I will point out that it goes no further than
&gt; our being friendly and respectful to each other in this medium and that we
&gt; have never had email contact.

I guess there is more history here than i understand.   I appreciate your

Yes, Juba, i've enjoyed our ability to banter and discuss in an untainted
atmosphere....but, Juba, you'd be welcome in my home....as would anyone else
here on this newsgroup or ASHM.  I consider you a friend, respect you as i
always have, but i also have affection for you.  In doing so, it in no way
lessens what i feel for those who have issues with you.  Problem is that i
don't understand the mindset of having affection for one person causing
someone to have less for another.

And our discussion on this thread has been so helpful for me.  I see the
other side from the way you've discussed it, and have more understanding for
it than i've gotten from any other replies.  Thank you!  Also, from reading
what we've discussed, i realize i didn't state my thoughts right.  I miss my

You're really comparing apples to oranges, Lavon. People do not have a
reasonable expectation that the local 7-11 will have everything they
need for a month. They do have a reasonable expectation if they order a
Big Gulp, it will not be 1/10th full when they get it. The local 7-11
has no deep ethical obligation to provide you with a Big Gulp.

Doctors have a moral and fiduciary responsibility to provide medical
care. This includes pain management. If a person came to the ER in
status asthmatics and the ER doc refused to give that person adequate
asthma medication, that would certainly be immoral and unethical on its
face. If that patient raided the med case and stole an asthma inhaler
as an alternative to dying that night, his actions would certainly be
understandab;le, and are a direct consequence of the doctrs refusal to
treat. I am not saying it shoud be legal to steal from the meds case.

If a person goes to an ER for treatment for pain, they should receive
proper treatment and a script large enough to carry them until they can
see another doctor. This is particularly true because if that person is
not adequately treated and goes to another ER, he will be branded a
drug-seeker, and the doctor in question is directly responsible for
that happening, as well. Sometimes, it can take months to get an
appointment and they have to get treatment from *somewhere* in the
meantime, and should not be branded as a &quot;frequent flyer&quot; for doing so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I guess the main question i have with this situation is, if caught, does the
&gt; person who alters the script expect to not have to be held legally
&gt; responsible?
">

Of course the person should expect to be held legally responsible. It
is considered a far worse crime to forge a script then it is to refuse
to treat pain, even though one involves altering a piece of paper and
the other involves altering someone's life, perhaps permanently, but
that is what the law is. I am arguing from a point of ethics and
morality, that in the grand scheme of things, failure to treat pain is
a far more heinous crime, and if you as a doctor perpetrate this crime
against a patient, you are at least partially responsible, morally, for
any desperate actions that person is forced to do as a result.

&gt; that happening, as well. Sometimes, it can take months to get an
&gt; appointment and they have to get treatment from *somewhere* in the
&gt; meantime, and should not be branded as a &quot;frequent flyer&quot; for doing so.

&gt;&gt; I guess the main question i have with this situation is, if caught, does
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; person who alters the script expect to not have to be held legally
&gt;&gt; responsible?

&gt; Of course the person should expect to be held legally responsible. It
&gt; is considered a far worse crime to forge a script then it is to refuse
&gt; to treat pain, even though one involves altering a piece of paper and
&gt; the other involves altering someone's life, perhaps permanently, but
&gt; that is what the law is. I am arguing from a point of ethics and
&gt; morality, that in the grand scheme of things, failure to treat pain is
&gt; a far more heinous crime, and if you as a doctor perpetrate this crime
&gt; against a patient, you are at least partially responsible, morally, for
&gt; any desperate actions that person is forced to do as a result.

Experiences and needs, primal and otherwise, shape what we do and how we
act.  We are still responsible for those actions.

i just wrote a long reply, but my husband got home, and i need more time to
express this.  If you want to get into moral right and wrongs, and who has
the lighter shade of gray, the doctor or the patient, i'd like to argue that
with you.  But, truthfully, my brain doesn't function in the lesser to
greater percentage of culpability debates.  I can only do the
right/wrong/legal reality of the current state of the system stuff.  It
isn't that i don't want to, Sean, i see your argument.  But i tried to do
that with a philosophy major in the music dept at cal state,he daily held
those sorts of discussions in the lobby...same thing with two of my
brother-in-laws, and found that i just can't break my brain into it. I'd
like to be able to, but my brain hits a brick wall.  It's frustrating, but i
can't make orange juice out of my apples.

i fold.

deep peace,
Lavon

Fair enough, Lavon. I really don't think we are going to be able to
convince each other anyway, but I appreciate your comments.

Thanks,
