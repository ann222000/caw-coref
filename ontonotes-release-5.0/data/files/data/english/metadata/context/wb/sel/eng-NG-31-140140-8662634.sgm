Hi All,

After much deliberating and positive advice and feedback from LBS I
pulled the trigger on ordering a Surly LHT complete in the 60 cm size.

As the next shipment of completes arrives at the Australian
distributor in seven days time I still have the chance to alter the
size if need be.

I'm still really worried about the choice I made and suspect that
perhaps a 58 cm would be more
suitable size wise.

I have an inseam of 89.5 cms and a height of 188.5 cms.The LBS used a
type of fitting machine where he was able to dial in the measurements
of a 58 cm and 60 cm Surly LHT frame size which was done over a couple
of weeks.

I'm after a comfortable fit with the handlebars even with or just one
to one and a half inches lower than the saddle and he reckons that
this is more easily done with the 60 cm than a 58 cm and when I
mentioned that I was concerned about the reach he said he will be able
to dial it in using variable stem lengths and angles.

I would appreciate any feedback, I realise that fit is a very
subjective topic but I would love to get rid of this nagging doubt I
have about the 60 cm being too big.

only knowing height and inseam, it's impossible to give someone advice
about what kind of reach they need or whether a given size frame will
be the ideal to start with in this regard. it depends on arm length,
what kind of neck/back angles the rider can tolerate, etc.

remember that in general, what you're really looking at in this case
is top tube length and very little else. you need the top tube length
to be able accomodate a position that's as far in as you need, ideally
without an ultra-short stem. there is zero difference between the 58
and 60 in terms of how high you'll be able to get the bars, because
they both now come with the same uncut fork. (if you were comparing 2
sizes with different ht angles, there would be a negligible but non-
zero difference).

do you have a bike you're extremely familiar with now, whose
positioning is either worth emulating or would work as a baseline for
a different style of riding? ie a road bike with more aggressive
positioning, where you can say &quot;I want the bars around 2 inches higher
than this and maybe half an inch further in.&quot; if you've already got a
bike, this can be a very good way to figure this stuff out, at least
to the extent of knowing what frame size to get. although it wouldn't
really work with any kind of accuracy using an extremely upright
position bike to figure what size of road bike you need, or anything
like that.

also make sure the shop doesn't chop the fork during assembly. very
very few bikes come with uncut forks and there is some potential for
the person assembling the bike to assume it should be cut unless
someone thinks to inform him or her otherwise.

You are taller than me (180 cm) and your &quot;inseam&quot; is longer. I ride a
58cm comfortably with not much seatpost sticking out past the clamp
(approx. 80mm from the clamp to the seat rail, Brooks Champion Flyer)
but I still have enough top tube clearance due to the low bottom
bracket height. My pubic bone to floor measurement is 86.4cm and I
could stand over a 60cm in shoes easily.. The reach on my 58cm is fine
but I have short arm reach. My drop bars are higher than the saddle
and that works for me with my shorter arms to keep my back angle
correct. I use a 90mm stem with a 30 degree rise to get the bars high
enough for me.
You should have no problem riding a 60cm. Do not get a 58 it will be
too small for you.

Ditto on the fork steer tube stuff......if you are buying a frame only
don't let any shop cut it short. The LHT is a tour bike and you may
want all the height possible for your bars. You can always trim it
later when you have your position for long rides dialed in. My bars
are about 4cm  higher than the saddle and its great for me on long
rides, riding on the hoods (no more numb hands). My reach is shorter,
as stated earlier, so it works for me. If you have long arms for  your
height you may be able to get by with a lower bar height/longer stem.
Regardless a 60 cm should fit fine.

You're 5cm taller than me and I ride a 60 quite comfortably. I think
your 60cm will be fine.

Hey there,
I ride a 58cm CC, and have about a 85cm (33.5 inches w/ no clothes or
shoes on) inseam. It fits me very well. I could probably ride the next
size smaller (better standover) but the cockpit would be too cramped.
Riding a big bike is more comfortable. With a 35+ inch inseam, I bet
you could ride the 62cm. Don't worry about it. It'll fit great and
everything will be o.k. I had the same dillema. 56, 58, or 60. I could
ride any of them, but the 58 fits my longer torso, and relatively long
legs just fine. The LHT is built for long hauling on paved and dirt
roads, so standover isn't as critical as on a mtn bike or 'cross bike.
Good Luck.
