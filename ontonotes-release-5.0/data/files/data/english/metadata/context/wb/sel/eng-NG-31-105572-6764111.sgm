Hi Friends!

I'm forwarding you a real nice topic........ for things going on ..... n
on....
Here goes on....
"I didn't get anything done today!"

How many times have you said that lately? Especially after an *exhausting*day!?!

If you're getting further behind the faster you go, ask yourself one
piercing question: How do you spend your time?

And then this one: How sure of that are you? Could you prove it? If you
don't get some real data about your own habits, you can manage to delude
yourself all the way to Executive Wasteland.

My experience working with many capable and accomplished leaders bears out
this truth: Most managers and executives don't spend their time the way they
*think *they do.

For my own time accounting, I've taken to using a simple little
time-tracking device — one of the Yahoo Widgets called, cleverly enough,
TimeTracker < http://widgets.yahoo.com/gallery/view.php?widget=39592 >. It
sits conveniently on the desktop, lets you customize your tracking task
list, and auto records your reported time usage to a spreadsheet. This is
all great.

It's even potentially great if you don't ever open the spreadsheet but use
the widget. That's because by using the TimeTracker, your awareness of how
you use your time will be raised. And that inevitably will affect your
behavior and help you choose how you spend your time.

How leaders spend their time may be disproportionate to optimum.

See the diagram for 16 categories of how leaders spend their time. Of
course, some of these activities shouldn't be on the list. But let's be
grown up and deal with what is. [Aside: I dashed off that little mind map
diagram right in my browser using
MindMeister.com< http://www.mindmeister.com/ >— a collaborative
mindmapping program currently in beta. Sign up for their
newsletter, and you, too, may get to play.]

If you were to use these categories to analyze *your* work life by assigning
two values to each, *Relative Importance* and *Actual Time Spent*, how do
you think they'd square? Many times the relationship between these factors
are of inverse proportions.

If you don't get some real data about your own habits, you can manage to
delude yourself all the way to Executive Wasteland. To do the stuff that
matters, you've got to 1) *track* how you are actually spending your time
now; 2) *plan *to use your time differently; 3) *decide* to change some
routines and kill some habits; and 4) *deploy* your time and energy more
effectively.

Bottom line: You have to put *you* in control of your time, energy and focus
to the degree you can (which for many of us won't be sufficient until we're
drawing down our retirement savings). My experience with many harried
managers is that they are absolutely great at identifying and blaming a
plethora of external factors for encumbering their time, and blind to, or
reluctant to acknowledge, their own significant contributions.

External realities impinge, yes. Of course. Equally true: Most of us can do
more to get more out of the available hours and minutes within our control.
And therein lies the secret.

To be more effective, to affect better results, you need to squeeze more out
of your day by taking more control over it. That will allow you to spend
precious time, energy, and attention on the things that *matter* to
producing the results you're after.

*Start right now.* Identify your high-value activities, honestly assess how
much attention and quality time you're actually giving them — versus lip
service and intention. Then start chopping away at your time and energy
wasters. And put more oomph behind the high-value, high-leverage activities
that really make a difference.

Then, when you go home exhausted, at least you will have accomplished
something.
