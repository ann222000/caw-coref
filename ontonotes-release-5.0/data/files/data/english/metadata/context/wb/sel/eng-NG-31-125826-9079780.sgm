I watched a very disturbing program on BBC4 yesterday, 'The Secret
Life of the Motorway'. In it a lorry driver confessed to taking his
wife shopping in their car every Saturday, involving journeys of
hundreds of miles. The lorry driver said he found it 'relaxing'.
Apparently vast shopping malls are growing up along motorway routes,
to the detriment of the High Street, due to shopaholic/caraholic
motorists. Shame on them!

Its quite simple really. A while back I thought I was becoming
alcoholic but it turned out I wasn't and I had no trouble at all
stopping drinking completely for 6 months, with no withdrawals or any
side effects, not even a craving.

As for my interest in ethanol, that is a result of the greenwash
aggrofuel scams, nothing more.

Now what are you admitting to? I'm not holding my breath.

Indeed, my own local authority spent silly amounts of money excluding
cars from the city. Then they complained that no one uses the High
Street shops anymore. Then they approved conversion of empty premises to
bars. Then they complained about public drunken behaviour.

Currently they attempt to force use of park and ride and complain that
all the trade is going elsehwere.

Of course it's never the fault of the politicians and the latest
proposal is to tax people entering the city in a car, because obviously
this will solve the problem of people not using the shops there.

Exactly. We'll ALWAYS be &quot;three days away from running out&quot;, no matter what

But some people say that HGVs should not be using town centres and taking up
High Street parking places, but that retail should instead take place at
out-of-town purpose-built shopping areas, with good access and dedicated
delivery bays.

A very good question, for a change. Since cars are the main
contributer to food miles and these out-of-town centres can only be
accessed by customers using cars it would seem that shopping areas
within concentrated populations are preferable and where shopping can
also be performed on foot, by bicycle and by home deliveries..

Unfortunately HGVs, which also serve the motorway malls it should be
noted, are a large source of pollution, which is why I would like to
see some distribution placed back on the railways .

&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes I must admit they do seem to provide a horror fascination.The fact

&gt;&gt; &gt; approved of in what might other wise be considered a civilised society
&gt;&gt; &gt; is a constant source of amazement to me.

&gt;&gt; The fact that you consider them to be &quot;machines of death and
&gt;&gt; destruction&quot; is a constant source of amazement to me. However with your
&gt;&gt; decision to abandon cars and your issues about alcohol, as well as your
&gt;&gt; belief that there is such a thing as a &quot;reformed alcoholic&quot; suggests to
&gt;&gt; me that there is a great deal that you're not admitting to.

&gt; Its quite simple really. A while back I thought I was becoming
&gt; alcoholic but it turned out I wasn't and I had no trouble at all
&gt; stopping drinking completely for 6 months, with no withdrawals or any
&gt; side effects, not even a craving.

Giving up alcohol for a few months is a classic sign of alcoholism.

Seems that's like critising the larger retail chains for finding the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The ability of the large retail chains, who are the usual ones to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; occupy the out of town retail parks/centres, to get substantial
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; discounts compared to the average high street single outlet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; business. WRT choice, there's also the question of available
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; floorspace to accommodate an increased range.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Seems that's like critising the larger retail chains for finding the
&gt;&gt;&gt; successful business model and going with it. Perhaps if you want to
&gt;&gt;&gt; regenerate town centres you need to reduce the business rate burden
&gt;&gt;&gt; and make it easy to shop there, lots of free car parks for example
&gt;&gt;&gt; otherwise shoppers will vote with their feet (or cars) as the are
&gt;&gt;&gt; already doing.

&gt;&gt; All of which may or may not be true but is irrelevant to the point I
&gt;&gt; responded to.

&gt; Which neatly avoids my question what am I missing?

I did, unclear, your response may or may not be true but is irrelevent
to the question asked, ie.  &quot;What am I missing?&quot;
