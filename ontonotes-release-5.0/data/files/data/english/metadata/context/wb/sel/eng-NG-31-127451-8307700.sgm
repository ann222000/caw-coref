&gt; Is there something specific about the Korean culture
">

It isn't entirely true that the center of East Asian civilization is
comprised of the successive dynasties of China. Kokuryo was founded not long
before the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ. Kokuryo's founding date is placed
by scholars at 37 B.C. and lasted for about 700 years, at the peak of her
power occupying all of what are now known as Manchuria and North Korea. The
origin of the name of &quot;Korea&quot; or &quot;Corea&quot; is ultimately traced back to
&quot;Kokuryo&quot;, whose brethren and rivals, the kingdoms of Paekche and Shilla,
occupied the southern part of the Korean peninsula. From these are descended
the royal house of Japan. If you are able, consult the articles written by
Japanese scholars themselves.

10 And now behold, this I speak unto their seed, and also to the Gentiles
who have care for the house of Israel, that realize and know from whence
their blessings come.

(Book of Mormon | Mormon 5:10)

We have seen something of the region to which the Israel people removed when
they migrated from the land of Assyria. The region is now known as the
Ukraine. Its western boundary was the Danube, its eastern boundary--later
extended to China and Japan--was the Don.
...
Settlements of the people were found to the south of the Caucasus mountains,
even as far south as Babylonia. These, under the name of Sacae, joined with
Cyrus in the conquest of the city of Babylon at the end of the
Nebuchadnezzar
dynasty.

Settled in Scythia, they undertook wide enterprises of colonization, which
they carried eastward to Lake Baikal, and even to China. It was during this
period of history that the Samurai established the Mikado rule in Japan. It
is more than probable--as many Japanese scholars believe--that they were of
Israel stock. Herodotus describes the Massagetae section of them as &quot;a great
and powerful nation, whose territories extend beyond the river Araxes,
TO THE EXTREME PART OF THE EAST.&quot;

~~Pascoe Goard (The Post-Captivity Names of Israel)

where is neither gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision,
Barbarous or Scythian, bond or free: but Christ is all in all things.

~~Colossians 3:11 (1534 Tyndale translation)

12 Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from
the west; and these from the land of Sinim.

(Old Testament | Isaiah 49:12)

Kokuryo was the leading nation of East Asia, known for her military prowess
and technology. She once defeated and humiliated the invading Su dynasty
armies (numbering in the hundreds of thousands, quite literally) of China,
thereby hastening the fall of the Su dynasty, which was succeeded by the
Tang dynasty. On May 20, 2007, I did receive a revelation of Jesus Christ
that Kokuryo, or the upperclass thereof, was of Israel stock indeed. Not
even the predatory and warlike tribes of Mongolia and Manchuria could have
their way with Kokuryo, which decayed from within, by internal bickerings,
and for this reason was eventually overcome by Shilla.

For if a realm be divided against itself, that realm cannot endure. Or if a
house be divided against itself, that house cannot continue:

~~Mark 3:24-25 (1534 Tyndale translation)

17 ... Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a
house [divided] against a house falleth.

(New Testament | Luke 11:17)

Thirteen centuries ago, the land currently occupied by North and South Korea
consisted of three kingdoms - Kokuryo, Paekche, and Shilla. The people of
Kokuryo were known for their military and intellectual skills (head); the
Shilla were craftsmen (hands); and the Paekche were agrarian (feet).

During this time it was felt that the security of many lay in the strength
of a select few. A group of elite young nobleman developed &quot;a way of life.&quot;
This Way was based upon adherence to a strict code of ethics and a
disciplined life style dedicated to living in harmony with the natural laws
of the universe. This group came to be known as Hwarangdo.

Wars and insurrections were a common part of everyday life. King Chin-Heung
of Shilla, in concert with the Mongols, succeeded in over-throwing the
rulers of Kokuryo and Paekche. The remaining royalty of the defeated Kokuryo
and Paekche kingdoms fled to the mountains or to neighboring islands. One
group of people from Kokuyro sailed to the Island of Hokkaido, while another
group sailed from Paekche to Kyushu, and established some of the first
ancient settlements of Japan.

Journal of Discourses, Vol.2, Pg.268-269, Brigham Young, April 8, 1855:

It is Ephraim that I have been searching for all the days of my preaching,
and that is the blood which ran in my veins when I embraced the Gospel.  If
there are any of the other tribes of Israel mixed with the Gentiles we are
also searching for them.  Though the Gentiles are cut off, do not suppose
that we are not going to preach the Gospel among the Gentile nations, for
they are mingled with the house of Israel, and when we send to the nations
we do not seek for the Gentiles, because they are disobedient and
rebellious.  We want the blood of Jacob, and that of his father Isaac and
Abraham, which runs in the veins of the people.  There is a particle of it
here, and another there, blessing the nations as predicted.

Take a family of ten children, for instance, and you may find nine of them
purely of the Gentile stock, and one son or one daughter in that family who
is purely of the Blood of Ephraim.  It was in the veins of the father or
mother, and was reproduced in the son or daughter, while all the rest of the
family are Gentiles.  You may think that is singular, but it is true.  It is
the house of Israel we are after, and we care not whether they come from the
east, the west, the north, or the south; from China, Russia, England,
California, North or South America, or some other locality; and it is the
very lad on whom father Jacob laid his hands, that will save the house of
Israel.  The Book of Mormon came to Ephraim, for Joseph Smith was a pure
Ephraimite, and the Book of Mormon was revealed to him, and while he lived
he made it his business to search for those who believed the Gospel.

Again, if a pure Gentile firmly believes the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and
yields obedience to it, in such a case I will give you the words of the
Prophet Joseph--&quot;When the Lord pours out the Holy Ghost upon that individual
he will have spasms, and you would think that he was going into fits.&quot;

Joseph said that the Gentile blood was actually cleansed out of their veins,
and the blood of Jacob made to circulate in them; and the revolution and
change in the system were so great that it caused the beholder to think they
were going into fits.

If any of the Gentiles will believe, we will lay our hands upon them that
they may receive the Holy Ghost, and the Lord will make them of the house of
Israel.  They will be broken off from the wild olive tree, and be grafted
into the good and tame olive tree, and will partake of its sap and fatness.
If you take a bud and inoculate it into another tree it ceases to receive
nourishment from its original stock; it must, however, receive nourishment,
or it will die.  Where must it receive its nourishment from?  From the tree
into which it has been introduced; it is supported by it, and becomes
incorporated with it.

It is so with the House of Israel and the Gentile nations; if the Gentiles
are grafted into the good olive tree they will partake of its root and
fatness.

1 HEARKEN, O ye Gentiles, and hear the words of Jesus Christ, the Son of the
living God, which he hath commanded me that I should speak concerning you,
for, behold he commandeth me that I should write, saying:

2 Turn, all ye Gentiles, from your wicked ways; and repent of your evil
doings, of your lyings and deceivings, and of your whoredoms, and of your
secret abominations, and your idolatries, and of your murders, and your
priestcrafts, and your envyings, and your strifes, and from all your
wickedness and abominations, and come unto me, and be baptized in my name,
that ye may receive a remission of your sins, and be filled with the Holy
Ghost, that ye may be numbered with my people who are of the house of
Israel.

(Book of Mormon | 3 Nephi 30:1 - 2)

12 And then, O house of Israel, behold, these shall come from far; and lo,
these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.

Revelations of Jesus Christ 23:71-73

Journal of Discourses, Vol.1, Pg.117 - Pg.118, Brigham Young, February 27,
1853:

The Lord operates upon the principles of continuing to organize, of adding
to, gathering up, bringing forth, increasing and spreading abroad; while the
opposite power does not.  It shows the nature of his opposition to that
peculiar trait of Christianity, based upon the principles of eternal
duration, increase, power, glory, and exaltation; and points out the
difference between the two adverse powers.

Again, what do you love truth for?  Is it because you can discover a beauty
in it, because it is congenial to you; or because you think it will make you
a ruler, or a Lord?  If you conceive that you will attain to power upon such
a motive, you are much mistaken.  It is a trick of the unseen power, that is
abroad amongst the inhabitants of the earth, that leads them astray, binds
their minds, and subverts their understanding.

Suppose that our Father in heaven, our elder brother, the risen Redeemer,
the Saviour of the world, or any of the Gods of eternity should act upon
this principle, to love truth, knowledge, and wisdom, because they are all
powerful, and by the aid of this power they could send devils to hell,
torment the people of the earth, exercise sovereignty over them, and make
them miserable at their pleasure; they would cease to be Gods; and as fast
as they adopted and acted upon such principles, they would become devils,
and be thrust down in the twinkling of an eye; the extension of their
kingdom would cease, and their God-head come to an end.

Language, to convey all the truth, does not exist.  Even in the Bible, and
all books that have been revealed from heaven unto man, the language fails
to convey all the truth as it is.  Truth, wisdom, power, glory, light, and
intelligence exist upon their own qualities; they do not, neither can they,
exist upon any other principle.  Truth is congenial with itself, and light
cleaves unto light, it seeks after itself, and clings thereto.  It is the
same with knowledge, and virtue, and all the eternal attributes; they follow
after and attract each other.  Mercy cleaves to mercy, because it is mercy;
light to light, because it is light, and there is no darkness, no deception,
no falsehood in it.  Truth cleaves unto truth, because it is truth; and it
is to be adored, because it is an attribute of God, for its excellence, for
itself.  It is upon this principle, that these principles should be held,
esteemed, practised.  Any persons, men or women, who do not receive these
principles for the love which they bear towards them, because of their
beauty, excellence, and glory; and because they are congenial to their
feelings upon this principle, are not Saints!  They exist upon their own
basis, and rest upon their own foundation.  Eternal justice, mercy, love,
and truth, never can be moved; they are attributes that correspond, and are
congenial with each other; they promote each other, fortify the heavens, the
Gods, and that which the Gods possess.

Now look upon the opposite side of these principles.  Suppose you say, &quot;We
will give up the pursuits of our holy religion.  We are not Latter-day
Saints.  Let us go and seek after the things of the world, speculate, get
unto ourselves riches, turn away from our duties, neglect the things
pertaining to our salvation, go with the giddy, the frivolous, the seeker
after gold, to California, Australia, or elsewhere, for the purpose of
acquiring wealth.&quot;  I tell you the result of that course.  You would cease
to increase in all the attributes of excellence, glory, and eternal
duration, from that very moment.  So soon as you conceive such ideas, they
find a soil within you prepared to nurture them, and it brings forth their
direful effects; from that very moment you cease to increase.  The opposite
principle seizes you, fastens itself upon you, and you decrease, lessen,
diminish, decay, and waste away in quality, excellence, and strength, until
your organization becomes extinct, oblivion covers you, your name is blotted
out from the Book of Life, from the heavens, from the earth, and from under
the earth, and you will return, and sink into pour natural element, which
cannot be destroyed, though many read the Bible as conveying such an idea,
but it does not.

The principle opposite to that of eternal increase from the beginning, leads
down to hell; the person decreases, loses his knowledge, tact, talent, and
ultimately, in a short period of time, is lost; he returns to his mother
earth, his name is forgotten.

Genghis Khan:

Man's highest joy is victory: to conquer his enemies; to pursue them; to
deprive them of their possessions; to make their beloved weep; to ride on

Martin Bormann:

National Socialist and Christian conceptions are incompatible. The Christian
churches build upon men's ignorance; by contrast N[ational Socialism] rests
upon scientific foundations.

When we [National Socialists] speak of belief in God, we do not mean, like
the naive Christians and their spiritual exploiters, a man-like being
sitting around somewhere in the universe. The force governed by natural law
by which all these countless planets move in the universe, we call
omnipotence or God. The assertion that this universal force can trouble
itself about the destiny of each individual being, every smallest earthly
bacillus, can be influenced by so-called prayers or other surprising things,
depends upon a requisite dose of naivety or else upon shameless professional
self-interest.

&quot;Admittedly it is not honesty which in real life overcomes dishonesty. In
the harsh struggle for existence the stronger, the harder capacity for
self-assertion daily gains the victory and yet it is bitter if this capacity
is based upon intrigue and a burning ambition as in the case before us.&quot;

In all nations, or at least in all civilized nations, there are distinctions

upon these distinctions?  How do Truth, Justice, and Mercy look upon them?

in the street are the same before the Heavens--the same in the eyes of

the nations in their hands, catch them in the dark, and they are the lowest

Above the Law: Billionaires in the Bedroom
Mogul Reportedly Built $30 Million Sex Grotto to Indulge His Desires

By MARCUS BARAM
July 20, 2007

When it comes to sexual deviancy, the rich really are different from the
rest of us.

Instead of hiring cheap hookers for an hour in a motel, they fly in high-end
prostitutes for the weekend to frolic in their underground grotto. Rather
than buying sex toys to liven things up, they'll build a sex vault complete
with bondage and S&amp;M gear.

The latest in a long line of lurid Lotharios is said to be computer chip
mogul Henry T. Nicholas III, who allegedly built a $30 million underground
grotto, complete with hidden doors and secret levers, at his equestrian
estate in Laguna Hills, Calif. According to court documents unearthed by the
Los Angeles Times, Nicholas is said to have planned a &quot;secret and convenient
lair&quot; where he could indulge his &quot;manic obsession with prostitutes&quot; and
&quot;addiction to cocaine and Ecstasy.&quot;

The 47-year-old billionaire, who co-founded Broadcom Corp in 1991, had his
private jet ferry prostitutes from New Orleans, Chicago and Las Vegas to his
lair, nicknamed the Pond, where he provided his rock-star guests with drugs,

including mushrooms and nitrous oxide, according to the draft complaint.

In addition, the complaint dug up by the Times alleges that Nicholas used
the lair as his &quot;personal brothel&quot; until his wife caught him in the act with
a prostitute, according to the paper. His wife, Stacy Nicholas, has since
filed for divorce.

Nicholas' attorney Steven A. Silverstein told the Times that &quot;all of the
allegations are denied.&quot; In 2000, Nicholas told the paper that the
underground facility was a &quot;pump house&quot; to handle runoff from his horse
trails.

The allegations seem to echo other well-publicized cases. Publishing heir
Richard Quadracci reportedly ran a gay sex club, complete with a
1,000-square-foot playroom equipped with a cross, bondage boards, harness
power hoists and other X-rated paraphernalia, out of his penthouse apartment
in Manhattan.

Quadracci claims that he only ran a Web site describing a bondage-themed bed
and breakfast that he planned to open one day. Eventually, his condominium
board sued him and the case was settled in early 2005.

Other notorious cases include Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire financier who
was charged with felony solicitation of a prostitute for hiring underage
girls to give him massages at his Palm Beach mansion. In that case, some of
Epstein's lawyers including famed barrister Alan Dershowitz, reportedly
embarrassed the girls by unearthing their MySpace pages on which they
recounted their drug use.

The Palm Beach Police requested an investigation by the FBI after the
state's attorney reduced the charges in that case. Currently, prosecutors
are expecting the case to go to trial and a case disposition hearing is
scheduled for Nov. 16.

The types of sex and erotic indulgences may vary in each case but they're
all made possible by having money.

&quot;The rich aren't more prone to extreme sex but they are more likely to have
the resources to spend on it,&quot; said Manhattan-based therapist Ian Kerner.
&quot;There are the $2 toothless hookers and the $20,000 call girl virgins but
there's still work for all of them.&quot;

Kerner believes that extreme sexual appetites have less to do with money
than with core desires and instincts shaped by genetics and your upbringing.
But being wealthy and powerful allows you to indulge those cravings --
sometimes with unexpected results.

&quot;I've had cases working with Wall Street bankers who always have to be about
testosterone and they never get to explore their feminine side or their
vulnerable side and these guys often go to dominatrixes and explore being
whipped and spanked,&quot; said Kerner.

They also may feel that their wealth is undeserved and that they need to be
humiliated. &quot;The investment banker who's mastered the universe just wants to
chill out and be dominated.&quot;

Wealthy men and women who are in the public eye may already feel above the
law but they seek the thrill of putting themselves in high-risk situations.
&quot;These are people who feel they can do what they want all the time,&quot; said
Gini Graham Scott, the author of &quot;Homicide by the Rich and Famous.&quot;

&quot;The money lets them indulge every whim and eccentricity and they have the
freedom to experiment,&quot; she explained. &quot;But once they achieve a certain
thrill, they need to expand that. After a while, it gets boring and they
keep pushing the envelope on extreme behavior.&quot;

That certainly seemed to be the case with Fiat heir Lapo Elkann, who was
hospitalized in 2005 after overdosing at the apartment of a 53-year-old
transvestite named Patrizia. After a stint in rehab in Arizona, Elkann moved
to Manhattan, launched a new line of sunglasses and started indulging new
passions: speeding in his family's racecars. Bravo!

7 Yea, and there shall be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry,
for tomorrow we die; and it shall be well with us.

(Book of Mormon | 2 Nephi 28:7)

15 And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands
into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his
feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone
forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did
know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written
by the prophets, that should come.

16 And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves, they
did cry out with one accord, saying:

17 Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did fall down
at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.

18 And it came to pass that he spake unto Nephi (for Nephi was among the
multitude) and he commanded him that he should come forth.

19 And Nephi arose and went forth, and bowed himself before the Lord and did
kiss his feet.

20 And the Lord commanded him that he should arise. And he arose and stood
before him.

21 And the Lord said unto him: I give unto you power that ye shall baptize
this people when I am again ascended into heaven.

22 And again the Lord called others, and said unto them likewise; and he
gave unto them power to baptize. And he said unto them: On this wise shall
ye baptize; and there shall be no disputations among you.

23 Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins through your
words, and desireth to be baptized in my name, on this wise shall ye baptize
them-Behold, ye shall go down and stand in the water, and in my name shall
ye baptize them.

24 And now behold, these are the words which ye shall say, calling them by
name, saying:

25 Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

26 And then shall ye immerse them in the water, and come forth again out of
the water.

27 And after this manner shall ye baptize in my name; for behold, verily I
say unto you, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one; and
I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one.

28 And according as I have commanded you thus shall ye baptize. And there
shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither
shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine,
as there have hitherto been.

29 For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention
is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he
stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.

30 Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger,
one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be
done away.

31 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will declare unto you my
doctrine.

32 And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath
given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth
record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and I
bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and
believe in me.

33 And whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be saved; and
they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God.

34 And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned.

35 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and I bear
record of it from the Father; and whoso believeth in me believeth in the
Father also; and unto him will the Father bear record of me, for he will
visit him with fire and with the Holy Ghost.

36 And thus will the Father bear record of me, and the Holy Ghost will bear
record unto him of the Father and me; for the Father, and I, and the Holy
Ghost are one.

37 And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and become as a little child,
and be baptized in my name, or ye can in nowise receive these things.

38 And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and be baptized in my name, and
become as a little child, or ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.

39 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and whoso
buildeth upon this buildeth upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not
prevail against them.

40 And whoso shall declare more or less than this, and establish it for my
doctrine, the same cometh of evil, and is not built upon my rock; but he
buildeth upon a sandy foundation, and the gates of hell stand open to
receive such when the floods come and the winds beat upon them.

41 Therefore, go forth unto this people, and declare the words which I have
spoken, unto the ends of the earth.

(Book of Mormon | 3 Nephi 11:15 - 41)

The Vapors:

I'm turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese

10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.

11 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish [from] the way, when his
wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed [are] all they that put their trust
in him.

(Old Testament | Psalms 2:10 - 12)

Phylogeny, n.
the evolution of an animal or plant type.

JJ Cale:

If you want to hang out, carry on in phylogeny, it's insane.
If you want to get down, wallow in Evolution, it's in vain.
He don't lie, he don't lie, he don't lie, Lawd Keynes.

If you got bad news, you got to kick them blues, of Thomas Paine.
But when your day is done, you found no empty space, it's inane.
He don't lie, he don't lie, he don't lie, Lawd Keynes.

If yer pain ain't gone and you got to get it up, take procaine.
Don't forget this fact, you can't wash it away, yer Levi's stain.
He don't lie, he don't lie, he don't lie, Lawd Keynes.

6 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about
the city.

7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords [are] in their lips: for
who, [say they], doth hear?

8 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in
derision.

(Old Testament | Psalms 59:6 - 8)

Journal of Discourses, Vol.4, Pg.77, Brigham Young, November 9, 1856:

They may make sharp their two-edged swords, and I will turn out the Elders
of Israel with greased feathers, and whip them to death.

William Congreve (The Mourning Bride):

Musick has Charms to sooth a savage Breast,
To soften Rocks, or bend a knotted Oak.
I've read, that things inanimate have mov'd,
And, as with living Souls, have been inform'd,
By Magick Numbers and persuasive Sound.

Journal of Discourses, Vol.1, Pg.48, Brigham Young, April 9, 1852:

As one of the modern writers has said, &quot;Music hath charms to soothe the
savage breast.&quot;  It has been proved that sweet music will actually tame the
most malicious and venomous beasts, even when they have been stirred up to
violent wrath, and make them docile and harmless as lambs.  Who gave the
lower animals a love for those sweet sounds, which with magic power fill the
air with harmony, and cheer and comfort the hearts of men and so wonderfully
affect the brute creation?  It was the Lord, our heavenly Father, who gave
the capacity to enjoy these sounds, and which we ought to do in His name,
and to His glory.  But the greater portion of the sectarian world consider
it sacrilege to give way to any such pleasure as even to listen to sweet
music, much more to dance to its delightful strains.  This is another short
sermon.
