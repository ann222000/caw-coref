The real answer to the state of rec.antiques is this - you, yes, I am
talking to you, can contribute what you know on the subject of antiques and,
thus, flood the newsgroup with positive posts. This will strangle out the
weeds in much the same way fertilizing the grass will on your lawn.

The real beauty of this plan as opposed to some others is this - It will
work. You have control over what you do, yes you, I am talking to you, and
you can contribute to this group instead of sitting back and watching it like
television. Or just sitting back criticising those who contribute. If you
just want to get your two cents in because you love Ethyl and hate Fred, then
you will just be compounding the problem. Or not contributing at all. But if
you will make a positive contribution and keep doing it, then this will be a
better place for everyone.

There is no excuse for shirking. If there is an excuse for not contributing,
then there is an excuse for every other troublesome thing. Then the whole
thing falls apart. Contributions by those who know the game are the
foundation of this group. What would it be without them?

All of this can be easily be done, but it must be done by YOU. Waiting for
someone else to do it, so you can just sit there and eat more ice cream and
learn all about antiques is not going to change anything. If you want it
changed, you must do it yourself. No one is going to do it for you.

Contribute! Give!

"/> Yes, yes, yes! Excellent idea; but in order to keep the knowledgeable people
communicating you have to give them something back. How long can someone flood
the newsgroup with positive posts when all they get back is negative or smart ass
replies. The only way we are going to have a better newsgoup is if we treat each
other with respect.. We have to stop attacking the poster/messenger. There are
ways to disagree with out starting a third world war.

We can't exchange ideas very long on this group before someone gets upset with
someone else. IMO if someone gets mad and picks up their marbles and goes
home...no matter how knowledgeable so be it. People will only stay if they feel
comfortable and have a need or feel needed. No one is indispensable ..someone
else will come out of hiding and fill the void. The strongest more confident
personalities will do the most posting. Nothing stays the same - people will
always come and go.

I started reading this newsgroup a year ago and the same garbage was going
on.....then it got really good for a long while then it deteriorated again....now
it looks like everyone is pulling together to get things back on track. As long
as enough care the newsgroup will continue.

Hello All,

I was wondering if anyone could help me date and value a teaset that my
sister-in-law has inherited from her grandmother. It has no backstamp
except for what looks like two crossed swords on each piece of the teaset.
It is light blue in colour with delicately handpainted scenes of what look
like Spanish ships in a harbour. Each picture is different on each piece of
the set. I have been told that since it was not backstamped that it is
probably European and possibly from the late 1800's.

Any ideas??
------------
I really feel I must reply to this message from T...I have been lurking on
this ng for about a year now. I posted the above message a while back and
received NO replies re this post (hard to believe no-one knew it might be
meissen). I later learned that the crossed swords were a meissen mark (my
father watched an episode of the antique roadshow) and I reposted re a value
of the teaset. (a big no-no apparently). I had in fact tried to research it
at my local library but could find no useful information on MY particular
teaset (I live in a semi rural area in Australia so I was not surprised by
their lack of good antique information). I am surprised that you guys are
so reluctant to give us &quot;newbies&quot;, as irritating as we must be, (:() a
little information....I am interested in antiques but I am reluctant to post
because newbies generally get flamed for every tiny transgression whether it
be their spelling, their &quot;stupid&quot; question or the &quot;tone&quot; of their e-mail (no
doubt there will be repercussions from posting THIS e-mail!) I have been
reading many ng's over the past year but am stunned that many contributors
to this group feel that giving general ballpark values for antiques is
depriving antique valuers of their bread and butter. How can just giving a
ballpark figure replace the expert opinion of a valuer? Most people who ask
a pieces value would only be interested in a ballpark figure from someone
who might be familiar with a particular piece. I certainly didn't expect an
yone to spend hours researching my teaset so they could give me an expert
valuation. What is wrong with stating (example only-there may not have been
anyone who knew the value of my teaset) &quot;I think your teaset may be worth X
no of dollars but please visit a valuer to get an expert opinion&quot;? I know
that we are meant to be DISCUSSING antiques not just asking questions re
value - but isn't the question of value an important factor in the
acquisition of antiques? What if I wanted to buy more pieces? What if I
had no idea it was valuable and sold it at my local market for $5? (I have
since found out from a helpful person on the net that specialises in meissen
that it may be worth up to $2000!)
I am also a quilter...if I had information that could help a fellow quilter
then I would never say &quot;sorry I learnt the information I have acquired
through years of experience - there's no way I will impart any of this
valuable information to you - go find out for yourself&quot;. Sometimes a little
help from a friendly person can help to get you hooked on a hobby....I have
found the contributors to this ng (apart from a few) to be too reluctant to
give info, and too ready to flame anyone who makes a mistake or spells
something wrongly (or uses all capitals for god sake!).
I will continue to read this newsgroup because of the pearls of wisdom that
are sometimes to be found here (becoming all too few between all the
flaming), but you would have a lot more contributors if you lot weren't so
damn touchy!

I am sorry this is not a more positive post...but I was just wondering if
you knew WHY people are reluctant to post here????
Michelle

Dear Michelle,

If you didn't get an answer to your question about a ball park figure on the
teaset it is probably because the Meissen mark is one of the most reproduced of
all marks. Meissen is a town in Germany and there are many other companies
there that also made porcelain. Much like the area of Limoges in France, any
china made in the town of Meissen or the area of Limoges may be called Meissen
or Limoges but that does not mean it is the valuable porcelain of huge prices.

The crossed swords has been legitimately used by other companies all throughout
Europe. Also, as I said above, it has been heavily reproduced to intentionally
fool people. I checked my &quot;Marks on German, Bohemian, and Austrian Porcelain&quot;
and there were twelve pages of crossed swords marks. The fact that you did not
get a ball park valuation based on your description does not show that the
people on this newsgroup are rude or unsympathetic to posters. Rather, it
shows considerable restraint on our part. There is a vast disparity in value
on porcelain and based on the information you gave any valuation you received
would have been totally worthless. When people are given a full enough
description or a picture to look at, they frequently respond from a position
of knowledge. To just throw out a ballpark figure would be totally
irresponsible. Rather than find fault with the people here, I applaud them for
their restraint.

We love doing research when we have appropriate input. The more we research
the more we learn. However, trying to research a pig in a poke is useless. I
truly hope you won't misconstrue this response as a flame. I am simply trying
to explain to everyone who reads here why frequently you will not see a
response to the &quot;what is it worth&quot; type of questions.

Sincerely,

Ashley

Ashley

Hi, Ash. They never take it well when you tell
them Granny left them a fake. They get downright
snippy about it sometimes.;)
But I maintain that the reason that questions go
unanswered here for the most part because people
are here to GET and not to give. That was the
original point of this thread.

If you took out all the conversatoin about what
r.a. ought to be, all FS posts and WTB posts,
and the requests for free appraisals, what would
be left? Well, Marsall's good jokes. But not
much really. I suspect that as cranky as we all
are, with notable exceptions, of course, we are
all do-gooders at heart. (Again, there are notable
exceptions!)

That might explain why there are so few of us.
Can this be right? Maybe not. Where the hell
are the others? There are supposedly thousands
of readers of this group. Maybe that is just not
so. Maybe we are all alone on this little rock
in cyberspace.

Is there anybody out there?

, but few willing to participate. After one really bad day on rec antiques
I thought of filtering out all the WTB, free appraisals etc, but then I
thought &quot; what would be left &quot;. It worked out to about twelve of us on a
good day, but then twelve is better than none.

"/> Michelle and Mark,

When you posted your original question about the crossed swords
mark, you did get replies. As Ashley, Charleen and others have
stated, it's virtually impossible to determine the origin of an item
bearing the crossed swords mark.

While not the answer you may want/need, it's all we can give.

As for helping people who ask questions: many of us do.
No one here (or elsewhere in the universe) is an expert on
everything - nor can all answers be answered by one person.
Often, you'll find folks all chiming in with bits and pieces of
info - sometimes that can lead to a resolution, sometimes not.

The quandary faced here is this: Many of the questions posted
are either lacking in information (description), request that only
an email reply by sent, want an appraisal (no way can do), or
otherwise are unanswerable in a discussion group format.

It's really a give-and-take situation -- ask for info, but help
someone with something you know about. 95% of the folks
coming here for help never do contribute otherwise.

Kris

: starting to get that impression.....

I haven't noticed that this group is unwilling to share. You may not have
received the information you wanted -- but that's not the fault of this
group (as Ashley pointed out so eloquently.) Your question on value
wasn't one that *could* be given a &quot;ballpark&quot; answer -- it required
specific knowledge of the marks on the back of the porcelain and a look at
the porcelain itself. (Unless, of course, a &quot;ballpark&quot; figure would be
helpful if it were something like $5-$1000...) If you want to provide a
photo of the marks and the set (as long as it's not posted to this group,
but on a web page or something) I am sure there are people who would give
you their considered opinion of the origin and value of the set.

I think of rec.antiques as a sort of informal gathering, perhaps at a pub
(or, in this part of TExas, at an icehouse.) Some of us are dealers, some
of us are collectors, and while we talk about antiques, we talk about
other interests we have in common, too. People are welcome to wander in
and join the conversation, but (just as in real life) someone who blunders
in, interrupts the conversation with a rude demand for an appraisal for
something s/he describes inadequately, to be delivered by phone since s/he
can't be bothered to stick around long enough for an answer, then gets
peeved when his/her demand isn't promptly met, isn't going to be welcomed
with open arms and a round of ale. This group gets that kind of intrusion
often enough that all newcomers that walk in with a blurry photo of a
genuine antique widget under their arm are going to be looked upon with a
jaundiced eye.

I don't mind imparting what information I have to give (some might say I'm
a little too willing to give at too great length... :-D) but I do feel
uncomfortable giving values at long distance, even with an excellent idea
of what the object is and who made it when. It has nothing to do with not
wanting to impart what I know -- it's just that there are so many factors
to take into account, even when some of the variables are a lot more fixed
than is the case with your tea set, that I don't want to give bad
information. Prices for antiques are very subjective, in spite of what
the price guides would have you believe. I don't think blasting every
newcomer who wants to know a value is either effective or called-for, but
I can understand the irritation of those on the receiving end of the
endless requests for values.

In fact, I personally feel a little insulted at the notion that &quot;everyone&quot;
is reluctant to share...

Terri

I guess what &quot;would be left&quot; is the general give and take experienced by any
group of like-minded people of different backgrounds, education and
geography. I have a hard time understanding why we whine so much about the
purity of content. Is this a chartered group of antique one per-centers?
Is there some elitist initiation I missed? Yet no one wants to be a
moderator.

What is it that everyone is seeking, yet seems lost. Show and tell? An
insightful monograph on an obscure potter? A thrilling exposé on an artful
forger? Conservation how to? Travel tips to Antique Alley? Insider's
Guide to the Paris Marché aux Puces? Gash's galleys for the next Lovejoy
mystery? If someone feels obliging and competent to share these - great.
In the meantime I can manage to slog through the drek and choose the nuggets
just fine - without whining - without ranting - without insults - without
profanity [for the most part] - without storming off [Sorry Charley, but
that's not the solution and I feel you know that]. My subscriptions to MAD
and the others satisfies my need to learn about the current affairs in the
antiques world. I come here for a few minutes a day for relief from the
daily grind and the opportunity to chat with friends and strangers -
generally about antiques.

&gt; Hello All,

&gt; I was wondering if anyone could help me date and value a teaset that my
&gt; sister-in-law has inherited from her grandmother. It has no backstamp
&gt; except for what looks like two crossed swords on each piece of the teaset.
&gt; It is light blue in colour with delicately handpainted scenes of what look
&gt; like Spanish ships in a harbour. Each picture is different on each piece of
&gt; the set. I have been told that since it was not backstamped that it is
&gt; probably European and possibly from the late 1800's.

"/> I think the only way you are going to get a reliable answer as to either
history/origin or value is to have an expert on Meissen look at it in
person. As others have noted, the crossed swords mark has been widely
used and abused. The absence of a backstamp could mean that is 1800s
European, and worth somewhere in the four-digit range. It could also
mean that it is 1997 Japanese crap imported with a peel-off sticker
saying &quot;Made in Japan&quot;, and worth somewhere in the low two digits. From
the limited information available, it's not possible to tell.

Sorry - I don't understand... how do you GET without SOMEONE having to
GIVE???? Are you saying that the whole point of this ng is to get, get, get
and to give nothing (or so little that it doesn't count?) Why is everyone
so reluctant to share??? Is this newsgroup for professionals only? I am
starting to get that impression.....maybe I should leave to so that I don't
clutter up your ng with pathetic newbie questions OR maybe if newbies were
more accepted than admonished and if we were helped instead of ridiculed
then just maybe this newsgroup would be filled with interesting questions
and helpful advice, even if it was from other newbies with helpful hints on
a particular book or a tale of woe that taught them a valuable lesson.
PLEASE all you experts, find it in your hearts to share your information
with us (maybe theres something we could share with you) and if you decide
not to, then please let us newbies have a chance to use this ng as a format
for answering our so called stupid questions amongst ourselves, without fear
of reprisal.

&gt;I thought of filtering out all the WTB, free appraisals etc, but then I

The one thing I collect, and many of you have them, though they aren't

cats. (Dead serious, remember?) I know a lot about them, a lot. I would be
more than willing to answer and all questions about cats that I can. I won't
post the information because it belongs in another newsgroup, so private

As I learn more about my chosen areas of collectibles (costume jewelry, Delft,

Almost none of what goes on in the group bothers me, and most is
actually entertaining. I do draw the line at some of the vicious

Come to think of it, though, even that takes me back to my long career

I really feel I must reply to this message from T...I have been lurking on
this ng for about a year now. I posted the above message a while back and
received NO replies re this post (hard to believe no-one knew it might be
meissen). I later learned that the crossed swords were a meissen mark (my
father watched an episode of the antique roadshow) and I reposted re a value
of the teaset. (a big no-no apparently). I had in fact tried to research it
at my local library but could find no useful information on MY particular
teaset (I live in a semi rural area in Australia so I was not surprised by
their lack of good antique information). I am surprised that you guys are
so reluctant to give us &quot;newbies&quot;, as irritating as we must be, (:() a
little information....I am interested in antiques but I am reluctant to post
because newbies generally get flamed for every tiny transgression whether it
be their spelling, their &quot;stupid&quot; question or the &quot;tone&quot; of their e-mail (no
doubt there will be repercussions from posting THIS e-mail!) I have been
reading many ng's over the past year but am stunned that many contributors
to this group feel that giving general ballpark values for antiques is
depriving antique valuers of their bread and butter. How can just giving a
ballpark figure replace the expert opinion of a valuer? Most people who ask
a pieces value would only be interested in a ballpark figure from someone
who might be familiar with a particular piece. I certainly didn't expect an
yone to spend hours researching my teaset so they could give me an expert
valuation. What is wrong with stating (example only-there may not have been
anyone who knew the value of my teaset) &quot;I think your teaset may be worth X
no of dollars but please visit a valuer to get an expert opinion&quot;? I know
that we are meant to be DISCUSSING antiques not just asking questions re
value - but isn't the question of value an important factor in the
acquisition of antiques? What if I wanted to buy more pieces? What if I
had no idea it was valuable and sold it at my local market for $5? (I have
since found out from a helpful person on the net that specialises in meissen
that it may be worth up to $2000!)
I am also a quilter...if I had information that could help a fellow quilter
then I would never say &quot;sorry I learnt the information I have acquired
through years of experience - there's no way I will impart any of this
valuable information to you - go find out for yourself&quot;. Sometimes a little
help from a friendly person can help to get you hooked on a hobby....I have
found the contributors to this ng (apart from a few) to be too reluctant to
give info, and too ready to flame anyone who makes a mistake or spells
something wrongly (or uses all capitals for god sake!).
I will continue to read this newsgroup because of the pearls of wisdom that
are sometimes to be found here (becoming all too few between all the
flaming), but you would have a lot more contributors if you lot weren't so
damn touchy!

I am sorry this is not a more positive post...but I was just wondering if
you knew WHY people are reluctant to post here????

and maybe contribute more but reluctant to get flamed!)&quot;
////////////////////////////////////////////////////

You are absolutely right. From now on we are all just going to spread our legs
and
let whoever wants it have it. It's party time!

Sheesh.

Look, if you do not understand the difference between your quilting hobby and
the trade I pursue to feed my nine growing children, then there is little
reason for me to take much more time trying to explain this to you, is there?
How in the world can you equate trading quilting tips with someone (let me
ask you this, does a quilting tip have any commercial value?) with the
advice you get from a professional. Does your lawyer think that his work is
on par with tips on stitches and brands of thread? It would be rude of you to
ask your doctor for free advice at a cocktail party, right? Right. It is rude
to ask a professional for free advice period. And the vast majority of those
who do the actual answering of the questions here are professionals.

On the whole, if I may speak for dealerdom, we like to talk about this stuff!
We do it all the time! We like people who are like us and are always
learning. But when someone just wants a quickie, just wants the down and
dirty money questions answered then they are just using us for their own
ends. Can you understand that? What is so difficult about this concept? We
are not talking about yarn. We are talking about money. And we are not, as
Mike said, people who make a lot out of this, on the whole, we are bright
people who could be making more elsewhere, but we stay in this for love. Do
you understand that? We do not like to be fucked on the first date and never
called back. Am I making this at all clear to you? Didn't you read the
Little Red Hen when you were a kid? THAT is why we don't give it away. Well,
that is the best I can do. I will bet that this has done no good at all and
your opinion still is that we should all stand, as a milk cow does. I have
tried to show you why we will not. T. P.S. And please thank Ash for her help.
It would be the thing to do, don't you think?

Dear Ashley, just checked Deja News and found your posting..I did NOT
receive it this morning (did you send it to my email address or to the
newsgroup?) I understand that it shows restraint not to give out ballpark
valuations without knowing the details but as a newbie I wasn't sure what
details to give. Somehow I think you guys must have forgotten what it was
like to know NOTHING about antiques. If anyone was interested in my
question wouldn't they have told me what to look for? I received NO replies
at all. Did everyone have to be SO restrained that I didn't get ANY
replies? Not even that it MIGHT be meissen. But that didn't deter me, I
found out through other sources and I kept on reading...but now I feel that
some people are just getting too rude to us newbies and I felt the urge to
say something. As far as loving to give input when you have the right info,
check out Trances email...seems I would have to pay (nothings free you know
just look at the example of the little red hen!) I'm sorry that I didn't
give the right information with my first email, seems that if I had known
more about antiques I would have found everyone very helpful - but I didn't,
oh well, I had better go and become an expert so I can ask questions here!

Email sent to group from Ashley but not on my server:
Dear Michelle,

If you didn't get an answer to your question about a ball park figure on the
teaset it is probably because the Meissen mark is one of the most reproduced
of
all marks. Meissen is a town in Germany and there are many other companies
there that also made porcelain. Much like the area of Limoges in France,
any
china made in the town of Meissen or the area of Limoges may be called
Meissen
or Limoges but that does not mean it is the valuable porcelain of huge
prices.

The crossed swords has been legitimately used by other companies all
throughout
Europe. Also, as I said above, it has been heavily reproduced to
intentionally
fool people. I checked my &quot;Marks on German, Bohemian, and Austrian
Porcelain&quot;
and there were twelve pages of crossed swords marks. The fact that you did
not
get a ball park valuation based on your description does not show that the
people on this newsgroup are rude or unsympathetic to posters. Rather, it
shows considerable restraint on our part. There is a vast disparity in
value
on porcelain and based on the information you gave any valuation you
received
would have been totally worthless. When people are given a full enough
description or a picture to look at, they frequently respond from a
position
of knowledge. To just throw out a ballpark figure would be totally
irresponsible. Rather than find fault with the people here, I applaud them
for
their restraint.

We love doing research when we have appropriate input. The more we research
the more we learn. However, trying to research a pig in a poke is useless.
I
truly hope you won't misconstrue this response as a flame. I am simply
trying
to explain to everyone who reads here why frequently you will not see a
response to the &quot;what is it worth&quot; type of questions.

Sincerely,

Ashley

Later ruder email received from Ashley:
You know, Michelle, I took time this morning to give you what I thought was
a
very thourough analysis of the situation and a helpful answer. Did I even
receive a thank you? No! All you did was come back and accuse everyone
again
of not giving. Perhaps we get a little tired of helping and get the kind of
response you just gave in return for our efforts. If you can't read and
understand what I wrote in my original answer then you are missing the
point.
So how about this: I think your teaset is worth $8766.69. Now, I have
given
you a ballpark figure. Does this make you happier?

So sorry T that I have suggested that you or other professionals would want
to give anybody free advice over the net. I should have offered to pay you
first. In fact the builder who came to our house the other day to give us
some advice on a renovation..maybe we should have offered to pay him for
HIS friendly professional advice. In fact next time I go to the pharmarcist
over here and ask about a particular medication or my childs sore finger
perhaps i should offer to pay HIM for his professional advice too...in fact
next time I go to my quilting shop and ask how they managed to get their
applique so beautifully positioned maybe I should offer to pay them for
their free and friendly advice (they are a BUSINESS you know and maybe they
have 10 kids to feed!).....there are so many people willing to give their
time and experience to help others that it just makes you look awfully
cheap.

Now I am not suggesting that you should offer vauluations for free to your
customers in your shop or give away your wares for free but this is the
internet for god sake, I am half way across the world. I am not, as you
suggest,asking for a valuation, or to pick your brain of every piece of
useful info that you have learned over the years, or for you to give me any
of your antiques (which is more like what the farm animals wanted from the
little red hen - don't you think???). What I am asking for is a little
advice! What I would have liked is to have someone say &quot;look I think the
crossed swords are a meissen mark but they could also be other things
like.xxx...what the hell is the use of a DISCUSSION group if people don't
want to spend the time to type an email and discuss it. Maybe I should have
written &quot;could you please tell me what co. might have used the crossed
swords mark and if you can't do that then maybe you could tell me whether
there were other companys that used and abused this mark (but that would
have required some knowledge of the subject in the first place of which I
had none because I was a NEWBIE)and maybe you could tell me whether it is
valuable or maybe not and perhaps you could tell me what books to look at to
find out or maybe you could just tell me that I'm rude for asking and fob me
off!!!
What do you want us newbies to say?? We are NEWBIES. We don't know what
questions to ask! We are hoping that you can help us to ask the right
questions..to point us in the right direction. Am I making myself
understood?

If someone came into your shop and asked whether an antique looking object
was valuable or just an old piece of junk what would you say? Would you
tell them to go away and get an appraisal or would you try and be helpful?
I was not suggesting that quilting is anything like antique dealing only
that customer service and a friendly attitude are requisite to any BUSINESS
and that helpful advice is a very generous thing to give and much
appreciated by most people..(including me)..but maybe this is not the case
for a professional antique dealer like yourself..perhaps everything must be
paid for. Why do you suggest that I just wanted a &quot;quickie&quot;. I was all set
to learn. How could you tell from my email (or any other for that matter)
that a quickie is all we newbies want? Can YOU understand that? If that was
what I wanted then why have I been reading this ng ever since? Understand?
And another objection: WHY DO YOU HAVE TO USE SUCH FOUL LANGUAGE (the
anonimity of the net seems to bring out the worst in some people) Am I
making myself clear to YOU???

I would like you to give us an example of a newbie question that would not
be treated with ridicule. Not many I have read would pass muster with you.
We HAVE to ask the right question, we HAVE to make sure we spell it right,
we ARE NOT allowed to ask about price (sacrilige!) we ARE NOT to offer an
opinion re this god given newsgroup. What are we allowed to do and say??

I am sorry if I made out that everyone on this group is unhelpful..this is
not the case..though it is obvious from the replies I have received to my
personal email address re this subject that the people who agree with my
analysis of this group are reluctant to make their comments known to this
group through fear of reprisal (much like I have in the past). I am not so
silly that I believe any of this would mean anything to YOU 'T' (you are
the professional and I'm just the lowly newbie afterall) so I won't expect
any change in your opinion or email ettiquette...I think that you have made
it very clear that you professionals only want likeminded &quot;professionals&quot; on
this newsgroup - the rest of us ask too many stupid questions and only want
a &quot;quickie&quot; (apparently!). I give up...nobody wants to hear why we lurkers
don't contribute or at least one lurkers opinion, so I'm off..have fun
flaming eachother...

Thankyou Ash for your help. (I always thank people who help me &quot;T&quot;)..but I

&gt;learning. But when someone just wants a quickie, just wants the down and
&gt;dirty money questions answered then they are just using us for their own
&gt;ends. Can you understand that? What is so difficult about this concept? We
&gt;are not talking about yarn. We are talking about money. And we are not, as
&gt;Mike said, people who make a lot out of this, on the whole, we are bright
&gt;people who could be making more elsewhere, but we stay in this for love. Do
&gt;you understand that? We do not like to be fucked on the first date and
never
&gt;called back. Am I making this at all clear to you? Didn't you read the
&gt;Little Red Hen when you were a kid? THAT is why we don't give it away.
Well,
&gt;that is the best I can do. I will bet that this has done no good at all and
&gt;your opinion still is that we should all stand, as a milk cow does. I have
&gt;tried to show you why we will not. T. P.S. And please thank Ash for her
help.

"/> In that case, no one should ever post a question here, be it about
value, history, cleaning, restoration, or anything else. Most dealers
want the public to be better informed about antiques, even if it means
offering free information and advice. Most ethical dealers even want
the public to be better informed about values, so that they aren't
ripped off by those who give this business a bad name.

Interestingly, when I subscribed to a criminal law mailing list, someone
would periodically post &quot;The cops kicked in my neighbors door without a
warrant and found a marijuana plant.&quot; And the lawyers on the list would
happily get into a long discussion of the Fourth Amendment and the
exclusionary rule and the exceptions, because they enjoy talking about
law and giving out a little free advice when it can do some good.

OTOH, they weren't going to interview witnesses, write briefs, do
extensive research, negotiate plea bargains, or appear in court for
free.

That's where I would draw the line. If someone posts a question (or
walks up to me in the antique mall and asks), and I know the answer or
can find it easily (or if it intrigues me enough to do some research for
my own edification), I'm happy to give an answer. I don't charge for
off-the-cuff informal opinions; I don't know any antique dealer (or
other professional) who does. If someone wants me to do extensive
research, cite comparable values, and type up a formal appraisal that a
tax assessor or insurance co. would accept, and appear as an expert
witness if the matter came to litigation, then they should expect to pay
a fee.

Dear... Sorry, I don't think I caught the name,

Did you understand the message written by John-Henry Collinson and Kristine
Reeves in reply to your post ? Do you see why your local
tradesmen/professionals/whatever are willing to dispense free advice? If not,
read that post again. It is well written and very clear. And did you read the
post written by CTS MEOU? Good points made there too. Please consider the
possibility that you have been wrong about all this. It seems to be likely,
doesn't it? And if you don't mind, let me say this. Being in the wrong about
something like this is no big deal. We are not performing surgery on children
here, we are talking about antiques. There are no winners or losers. There is
ONLY the truth. Those who wish to have the most of the truth that they can
will freely admit it when they are wrong and EMBRACE the truth! There are not
many members of the Flat Earth Society here. We are all pretty much able to
accept facts as facts. That is how we learn. Facts are not personal. Best
Wishes, T.

Marianne,
What kind of wine goes with roast leg of cat? AND, how long should I
leave an 8lb. Maine Coon Cat in the microwave to be fully cooked?
Thanks for your help....   BURP !
excuse Me,

Doug W

I'm still chucking. You got a belly laugh from me this morning -
thanks!!
In answer to your questions:
1) Wine: my choice would be saki
2) Cooking time for a 8lb Maine Coon would depend on whether or not it
was stuffed and with what. I do not recommend microwaving meat unless it
is ground. Regardless, 8lbs is rather small for a Maine Coon, so it must
be a young one. In a 350 degree oven, a good rule of thumb would be 15
minutes per pound unstuffed and 20 minutes per pound stuffed.
Bon appetit,
Marianne

Ah! Another Blue Willow collector! If you have Gaston's book, 2nd
edition, take a look at Plate #225 - it's a carnival glass pitcher and
glass set... for a better pic, take a look at mine:

http://www.ao.net/~chaos/jwillow2.jpg

I picked it up for $20 last month at Renningers (antique fair held every
weekend). I honestly thought I'd never find the glasses, not even on
eBay, and then last week in my usual search for &quot;willow -wind -pussy,&quot;
five of the glasses appeared - hubby won the bid for me as a Christmas
present!

Most of my BW is Japanese dinnerware - the stuff I use every day. But
I'm slowly adding some nice English and Dutch pieces, and I always
search out the weird... picked up a &quot;ship's lamp&quot; which isn't much more
than an American BnB plate with a brass swinging lamp drilled though it
for $2 at Renningers a few months ago. And have two English tins -
polychrome willow - one I've had for 20+ years and another I found at a
local flea market full of sea shells recently. &lt;grin&gt;

Do you have any odd or unusual pieces?
Have fun, Michele

"/>  Beautifully said Rich!

I've lurked on this group in '92-93 (I remember Charleen from then - she
started my budding interest in porcelain and ceramics) and got back online in
'97 - and the first thing did was dig up rec.antiques.
It is however incredibly frustrating to be faced with the vicious circle
where to deserve to be taught you already have to be quite knowlegable. I have
learned many interesting things lurking here (boy do I miss Charlie
already...) but often even general, non value-related questions I'd love to
see the answer to go ignored... We newbies can help by passing on the tidbits
we've learned here to the even newer folks who blunder in (At least I can point
the perennial &quot;old sewing machine&quot; posts at the antique sewing machine site).
Some days it feels very much like only serious professionals with deep pockets
are tolerated, and the rest of us should hie ourselves off to the corner to
hang our heads in shame, for ever daring to trouble the greats with our
insignificant discards of another era, or horrors and riducule, actually
liking these things... I never will be a professional dealer (in this area
infested with malls and seasonal shops), and likely my home will never be in
Architectual Digest, but I still consider myself entitled to be fascinated
with the history and place in time of antiques, and yes, their value. Dealers
will always be able to outbid me at auctions, and beat me to the early bird
yard-sale deals, but I can always hope I might someday find something they
missed, if only I could recognize it.
I just wish there were a little less vitriol and name-calling some days -
it leaves a bad taste in one's mouth, and it has done a very sorry job of
driving away some of the most interesting members. I agree with T's post that
the most effective way to dilute the poisonous threads is to post positively
but T is also one of the most aggressive posters on occasion. Can we please
practice what we preach here?

&gt;At a minimum, it is only polite for you to contact the author of

&gt;On a more serious note, it can be argued that posting someone's
&gt;e-mail to the net without their permission is a violation of
&gt;copyright law. Under that law, even though a letter was
&gt;addressed to you, it does not grant you the right to publish the
&gt;contents, as that is the work of the author and the author
&gt;retains copyright (even if no explicit copyright mark appears).
&gt;Basically, your letters are your intellectual property. If
&gt;someone publishes your letters they are violating your copyright.
&gt;This principle is well-founded in &quot;paper media,&quot; and while
&gt;untested in electronic forums such as Usenet, the same would

That's precisely true (you took the time to get the reference,

There HAVE been court cases regarding online services (now,

While I'm not certain of the outcome of such cases, I do know
that they have occurred - and have been expensive for both

Hiya, Doug...

Nope, sorry. You're wrong, wrong, wrong. The recipient owns a copy. The
right to reproduce it belongs to the writer. According to copyright law,
the writer holds the copyright despite whomever owns the original draft.
This was recently upheld in a court regarding the impending publication
of Princess Di's love letters. It was determined that even though the
lover owned the letters, Di's children owned the right to reproduce them.

I'm going through something similar right now, trying to obtain the
copyright or license to publish some manuscripts of a composer I've been
researching which are owned by the Library of Congress. The originals
were willed to the LOC by his widow. The LOC owns the MSs, but the
copyrights to all his music were willed to another family member. Since
they are unpublished, the copyrights, even though unregistered, belong
to the copyright heir and will not expire before Dec. 31, 2002. Means,
if I want to use them, I have to buy the rights.

Trust me on this, or off with your head! ;)

Tracy

Tracy,
So what you're telling me IS, if I post an e-mail in r.a that I received
from some clueless poster (usually an AOLer &lt;G&gt;) that I received in
response to sending them the FAQs url along with my 'suggestions',that I
have broken a LAW?? When I post someone's e-mail and state that it IS
an e-mail and include their headers along with the said e-mail (giving
them 'credit' as the writer)that I have broken a copywrite LAW? Is there
an EXACT statute or 'case' that you can refer me to concerning a final
decision on internet (e-mail) abuse?
BTW, everytime that Ronnie or Charleen or one of the 'others' that
gives the long drawn out , detailed 'answers' to questions asked here in
r.a taken from an 'uncredited' source aren't THEY breaking the same LAW?
Everytime that I post a description or price from a price guide aren't I
and others here breaking a copywrite LAW?
WARNING ! I may, at any time, post ANY e-mail that I receive to a
newsgroup or forward it to someone else and anyone that doesn't like it
can just sue me..... In other words, I am NOT convinced.........YET.
Keep trying,though. I'm not prepared to die fighting this cause and I
don't even feel wounded........YET. &lt;G&gt;

are free to show it to anyone you want as long as you say that it was

That extra bit of knowledge that we do not know it what keeps any hobby
interesting and any leisure activity rewarding.
In most areas of collecting there are always going to be little niches.
No one can know all things about all antiques for example.
Anitiques is a broad topic covering many time periods, and both original and
reproduction pieces. Sometimes antiques are seen on television or in movies or
at conventions or in private collections and it drives our passions and
commitments. And often one hobby leads to another.
Such has been true with me. If you have ever seen anything in any movie or
television show and ever wanted to just own it to hold onto
history and on your own little artifact and your own most precious
antique so to speak
then visit

http://www.uncg.edu/~mjcrawle/welcome4.htm  World's largest online database of
links to sites of production used props and costumes. Locate anything used on
screen in any movie or television show. Also in this post there was mention
of cats.  www.reelclothes.com  still has the bowl used by the dog in As good as
it gets I believe. If this type of item or any other from the unique to the
exotic to the classic interests you then visit my page. and be sure to visit
the links section for links to site of antique dealers, toy dealers and
everything else unique and special. Several antique sites are paid
advertisers of my site so you can know that what my site has will interest
the general antique collector as well as the most exotic collector of
anything imagineable.

The purpose of quoting someone else's copyrighted work also has a bearing
-- for example, for purposes of reviewing the work or for educational
purposes, you can quote pretty extensively, exceptions which are covered
under &quot;fair use.&quot; I'd say that when someone here on rec.antiques quotes
(and attributes) a printed source, even at length, for the purpose of
explaining some aspect of Art Deco style, for example, that probably falls
under &quot;fair use&quot; and would be perfectly legal. These are completely
different circumstances than publishing someone else's e-mail on a Usenet
newsgroup, and since fair use has been covered pretty extensively by
precedent, it's unlikely that you're going to be sued for quoting
someone's published work while you're enlightening rec.antiques readers.

I *would* be careful about posting someone else's e-mail, however -- while
this area of law hasn't been tried much yet, so there's not a lot of
precedent to use as a guide, there's enough to make me think that someone
would have grounds to sue you for publishing their private e-mail in a
public forum. Private e-mail is considered copyrighted material, whether
you register the copyright or not, and copyright includes the right to
decide when and where your copyrighted material is published. It's also
been determined legally that material on web pages is &quot;published&quot; the same
way material in books and newspapers is, so if you've put someone else's
copyrighted material on a web page in a manner not consistent with fair
use, and without the permission of the copyright owner, you're violating
copyright law. I'd say the only real question here is whether Usenet
newsgroup posts are &quot;published&quot; in the same way web pages are -- and I'd
guess that a court *would* consider it to be so.

So are you going to get sued for publishing someone's e-mail on a
newsgroup? Probably not. Personally, I wouldn't do it for reasons that
have nothing to do with the legality of the matter, but (as a writer with
a vested interest in upholding copyright law) the possibility of violating
someone's copyright makes me even less anxious to try it out...

In the very few areas in which I'm at all competent, most of the short

People who expect short answers to everything are either uninformed or not
too savvy. Plus, folks who give longer answers (I do this often)
may simply have been doing something long enough to actually have a little
knowledge and know that short answers for some things create problems.
There are some folks who like to expound, too. No harm there, in my

Well, I don't usually mix into these sorts of things, but it
plagiarism is usually an open and shut case, isn't it? ;)
This is an EASY one. Either it is or it is not.

If someone is accusing someone of it, let him prove it.
If it is not proved, such an accusation is BULLSHIT. We
are opperating under the priciple of innocent
until proved guilty, aren't we? Or is this just kangaroo
court? It is easy to cast aspersions, any moron
can do it.

If you can prove it do so. If not, if you can't prove it, if
you cannot back up what you say, cannot substantiate your
accusations, then you are a low motherfucker.

Prove it if you can. Let's see it. I will be happy to apologise,
be on your team, just what ever you want if you can prove it,
but let's see it first. Let's see the proof.

from this author, now it appears the author wishes to draw Charleen
(and &quot;others&quot;) into it as well.

I think it's suffice to say, that the original author has little long
term knowledge or experience on the subject of antiques nor would it
appear has spent IMNSHO any time, formally or hobby based, in the
study or research of the **overall** subject.

I collect much material and many articles on the subject of antiques,
(professional, academical, and personal) and their related history,
social and cultural. Much of it is from past college and post-study,
much of it has been passed to me by other like minded friends, and via
the way of professional colleagues, either academics or street-wise
dealer/collectors. I am on the whole appreciative for such information
from where ever it comes, I never query the source, much of the time
it is OBVIOUS that such information, that I receive, is third-party
from another source, and most these source can not be &quot;credited&quot; as
the original source may not always be known.

... And much of it from books that I own and books that I hire from
my local library usually renewed every 4-5 weeks, and the lion's share
is from inside my own head from ... somewhere.

The point ... it's not just a simple &quot;matter&quot; (as it would appear to
the author) of writing a long drawn out answer, for &quot;an answer's sake&quot;
and playing the big guy. But, based upon MANY other sources, fresh
ones, as well as the old stuff learnt a long time ago, and same time
fully understanding what ONE has or is writing about.

IMO ... I am fully aware and familiar with the subject I post to this
ng and am fully confident I can expand, or counter-argue with any or
most responses that I receive or meet in this ng. It is also plain to
me, &quot;others&quot; that post long drawn out answers are not ALWAYS fully
aware or truly understand the data they have submitted.

I would challenge the author of this original comment, to engage me in
discussion on ANY of the informative posting that I have made to this
ng and to present their alternate viewpoint on the subject through
logical and intelligent responses.

Finally I take strongly and find it most offensive to be accused of
plagiarism, especially, from the clown in residence. If that is the
charge, then the original author must also accuse most, if not all,
reference works and historians of the same charge ... I await the
challenge.

Their was no need to answer the cheap jibe of a second class mind
Ronnie. One is instantly aware if someone is 'copying out of a book' or
if someone understands his/her subject. You are not guilty of
plagiarism. which is not to say we agree with all you say.

All the snide raddled regulars on this NG would be gleefully pointing
the finger at anyone they felt was guilty of plagiarism.

Now back to the fun of reading people tie themselves into knots trying
to define modernism as if it is a single set down theory rather than a
collection (of sometimes opposing) philosophical concepts.

Long Live Fidel Castro.

&gt;This is an EASY one. Either it is or it is not.

&gt;If you can prove it do so. If not, if you can't prove it, if
&gt;you cannot back up what you say, cannot substantiate your

&gt;Prove it if you can. Let's see it. I will be happy to apologise,
