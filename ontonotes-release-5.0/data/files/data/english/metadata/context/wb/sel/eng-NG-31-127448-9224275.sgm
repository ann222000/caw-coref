Please excuse a question from a layman, but I'm interested in knowing why
the current human population is split between males and females almost
50/50.
In the human species, wouldn't it be an evolutionary advantage to have lots
of females and a few men, similar to a pride of lions?
Aren't females more valuable, evolutionarily speaking?
If so, shouldn't there be more of them? (Maybe I wish there was!)

I suppose that if there were some kind of evolutionary advantage to
different numbers of males and females, then a way could be found. After
all, sexual dimorphism does appear in some mammal species. However, it
seems to me that because of the way an individual's sex is determined,
the system is set up for a 50/50 split. (I hope an entomologist can
explain how bees really do it. Hormones must have something to do with
it.) So because that trait is so hard to change, I think that species
find ways to cope with that limitation in the setup.

It would? How? I'm not aware of lions being born disproportionately
female. Have you researched where male lions go? Horses have harems, too
... and bachelor herds for the stallions who don't have harems.

Natural selection doesn't care about the good of the species.  Okay,
strictly speaking, natural selection is not the sort of thing that can
care about anything, any more than gravity or density is, but the
point is, if a trait better enables the individual who bears it to
pass on his (or her) genes, that trait will become more common,
regardless of its effects on the species as a whole.

Suppose we start out with a situation where, say, four girls are born
for every boy.  For this analysis, we will ignore complications such
as childhood deaths, differential death rates for males and females,
adultery, lifelong celibacy, infertility, and such, and assume
everyone marries and has children.  In such a situation, the average
man, assuming replacement level reproduction, will have five children,
while each of his four wives has an average of 1.25 children.

Therefore, a son will, on average, give you four times as many
grandchildren as a daughter.  So any mutations that make you more
likely to produce male offspring than female will have a very high
fitness, assuming they have no other, antagonistic effects.  As long
as females outnumber males, male offspring will be more valuable *from
the standpoint of the individual's genes*.  Obviously, this will
reverse as soon as males start to outnumber females.  So no matter
what is good for the species as a whole, natural selection will favor
a rough balance of the sexes.

Note that the above makes a number of tacit assumptions, which don't
hold for all species.  Boys and girls are about equally expensive to
raise.  If one sex is much more expensive to raise than the other,
this will factor into which sex it pays to have more of.  Humans tend
not to mate with very close kin, as do many other species.  In species
where offspring of the same parents mate with each other, then
daughters do outnumber sons, since there is no advantage to producing
more sons if they're going to end up competing for the same very
limited pool of mates (and since the winner will mate with all of them
anyway).

Reminds me of the guy who found an ancient vase. When he rubbed it, a
genie appeared and asked what his third and final wish would be.

The man said, &quot;Hold up. What about my first two wishes?&quot;

&quot;Your second wish was to have everything returned to the way they were
before your first wish,&quot; replied the genie, &quot;so choose carefully.&quot;

The man considered for a while, then said, &quot;I would like six beautiful
wives.&quot;

The genie said, &quot;Your wish is granted. Interestingly, that was your
first wish, as well.&quot;

Should yield equal numbers *at conception* but not necessarily at birth.
We know, for example, that among humans male fetuses are very slightly more
susceptible to a variety of problems which result in spontaneous
termination.  In fact, among humans, at conception there are more male
fetuses than female.  Among babies, males are more susceptible to various
diseases.  Among adults, men are usually more at risk of fatal &quot;accident.&quot;
It isn't until you consider the population as a whole that you get an
overall slight preponderance of women.

Also see
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071105202335.htm

and google &quot;aberrant sex ratio&quot; for a lot of information about
deviation from a 1:1 ratio.

Theoretically, there should be equal number of sperm with X and with Y
chromosomes (in animals that use the XY system of sex determination)
and equal number of conceptions of males and females but in reality it
doesn't always work that way.  Biology is always more complicated than
it &quot;should&quot; be!  And there are an awful lot more ways of determining
sex than using Y chromosomes (and I don't mean using a ZZ/ZW system
which is just XX/XY in reverse).

It could have something to do with effective population size.  Ne =
4NmNf/(Nm + Nf). Ne = effective population size, Nm = number of males,
Nf = number of females.  Genetically the population isn't the number
of individuals that you can count, but the number that contribute to
the next generation.  If you had a region that could support 200
individuals and your sex ratio was 1:1 you have a much larger
effective population size if they breed in pairs than if they breed
(say 1:10).  Due to factors like inbreeding depression, the larger
your effective population size is the healthier the population can
stay.

Actually more males are born than females in humans.  By breeding age
the ratio is about even due to higher male mortality, and by
retirement age the ratio far favors females.  I've seen explanations
for this claiming that males do more dangerous activities, and have
more accidents, but males are probably the weaker sex in terms of
viability.

There is a trade off.  The larger the effective population size the
slower evolution is under similar selective pressures.  Smaller
effective population sizes can more quickly change to meet changes in
environment, but may maintain less genetic variation and be less
genetically able to adapt.

Nature seems to like the 1:1 ratio.  Even in species with a skewed
mating ratio you still have just as many males and females born, they
utilize the environment and consume resources, but only a fraction of
the males contribute genetically.  There can be greater selection
pressure put on males, but the effective population size goes down.
As long as there are enough resources to maintain a viable population
the ratio skew works.  There was a series of papers more than half a
decade ago that explored how large a population is needed to prevent
genomic meltdown due to inbreeding depression.  It was something like
an effective population size of around 10,000 for any endangered
species.  This is a large number.  You have to consider that a lot of
the population is juvenile, and that this 10,000 only considers those
adults that contribute reproductively.  If your breeding ratio was
around 1:10 you would need to maintain 3 times 10,000 that are
actively breeding along with the additional juveniles and extra males.

I think sex ratios in general are tackled in detail in &quot;The Red
Queen.&quot; Which is a wonderful book for many other reasons as well.

Short answer: whatever is rarer becomes more valuable. So in a
population that has 'extra' females, there's an advantage to any gene
line that can produce more males to cash in on the surplus. And vice
versa. The net result is a slight wobble around 50/50.

Although IIRC the selection pressure is not toward equal numbers of
individuals but equal effort input. If in a given species it takes X
effort to produce a female offspring and 2X to produce a male
offspring, the stable ratio would not be 1:1 but 2:1.

It's exactly like The Free Market(tm.) Funny how the same people who
love feedback systems when economics does them hate them when biology
does them.

I cannot imagine it happening in mammals or birds.  They generally
have no trouble finding mates.  But here is an example of a mite:
http://evilutionarybiologist.blogspot.com/2007/10/extraordinary-sex-r...

That link also has a PDF link to Bill Hamilton's excellent article on
the topic of sex ratios.

Sex ratios is an important topic to me because though it seems obvious
in hindsight I had to stumble across the explanation accidentally
while running my own simulations.  I was trying to create an unequal
sex ration in a population and it refused to cooperate.  I think it
took me a week of screwing around with it before I realized it was not
a software bug.

Steven J''s reply was accurate for why humans, which, like most
mammals, are locked into an XY sex determination system, tend to
produce a sex ratio that is close to (but not identical to -- at birth
there is a slight excess of males) 50/50.

But XY is not the only sex determination system.  And wide deviations
from the 1:1 sex ratio exists in nature.  In fact, more than the
simple male (small motile gamete producer) and female (larger nutrient
richer gamete producer) dichotomy exists.

In some environments, even the mammals wind up with distorted sex
ratios.  In the naked mole rat, there is only one fecund female (and
3-4 actively sperm-producing males) in the colony.  Even more common
in mammals is a distortion of the *effective* sex ratio in herd or
tribe animals where one male, the alpha male, is effectively the major
mating male, making the *effective* sex ratio different from the
actual sex ratio.

Needless to say, the sex ratio is much easier to manipulate in ants
and bees (by fertilizing or not fertilizing an egg).  In this group of
organisms, there is effectively one reproductive female and many
males.  But sex ratio also can be manipulated in some coral fishes
(where the alpha female becomes the alpha male when the male is
removed -- the ratio is biased in favor of favor of females, which is
the usual bias)

Is it possible, that evolution no longer effects which sex will be
born? I know in China, people prefer male heirs to female, and as a
result of the one child law often abort  female fetuses. As a result
there are millions more men in China, than women.

I know most couples who have more than one child want &quot;one of each.&quot;

ratio more than evolution?

Women were usually considered a liability, not an asset. Most cultures
fathers were expected to pay a man a dowry to marry his daughter, then
she would move in with the husbands family. While a son would be paid
to marry someone, bringing her and her assets into the household and
caring for the parents as they aged.

One: pet peeve. &quot;effect&quot; is a noun, &quot;affect&quot; is a verb. E.g. &quot;My new
insurance takes effect on Monday and it will affect my plans to have
surgery.&quot;

Two: I think you're mixing up evolutionary change and cultural change.
The change in local customs in China (e.g. those laws, the ability to
determine a baby's sex in utero, and abortion available as an option)
has been going on for less than fifty years. Evolutionary change takes
thousands of years. There's a good case to be made that humans haven't
yet adapted on an evolutionary level to domestic animals and
agriculture, which has been going on some 15,000 years.

The current Chinese sex imbalance has nothing to do with evolution. If
the rules stayed the same for 10,000 years and over time there were
more boys conceived and born without medical involvement, THAT would
be evolution.

(Just like if you took a room full of redheads and bleached them
blonde, it would have zero effect on how many redheaded -genes- are
present. Or how many redheaded children they'd have.)

Others have answered your question. I would like to question your question.
I think you are asking to wrong one. Implied in you question is, “What
would be the best for the species?” when natural selection happens to
individuals.

It becomes a matter of game theory. If an individual “helps the species” by
generating more females, others will take advantage of this target rich
environment by producing more males. So there is an ongoing pressure for
even numbers.

Oh no, that´s what humans do. The sex of a crocodile e.g. is
determined by the sex of the temperature of the eeg in the nest. Many
fish change sex during life. Some animals have only one sex and are
all hermaphrodites. And there are species that have 13 sexes, that all
are able to mate with the 12 other sexes.
Nature is much more inventive than you could imagine.

So you would be happy to be kicked out of the group you grew up in
when you reached sexual maturity.

Fend for yourself until you could kill the dominant male of another
social group.

Eat all his children, and then impregnate all the females.

Then spend the rest of your life defending your harem against all the
young hopefuls, until the day when you got too old to fight.

What kind of civilisation could possibly emerge from such a biological
system?

&gt; &gt; Note that the above makes a number of tacit assumptions, which don't
&gt; &gt; hold for all species.  Boys and girls are about equally expensive to
&gt; &gt; raise.  If one sex is much more expensive to raise than the other,
&gt; &gt; this will factor into which sex it pays to have more of.  Humans tend
&gt; &gt; not to mate with very close kin, as do many other species.  In species
&gt; &gt; where offspring of the same parents mate with each other, then
&gt; &gt; daughters do outnumber sons, since there is no advantage to producing
&gt; &gt; more sons if they're going to end up competing for the same very
&gt; &gt; limited pool of mates (and since the winner will mate with all of them
&gt; &gt; anyway).

&gt; Is this difference in numbers present at birth in some species of
&gt; mammals and birds?
">

Not that I know, although there is much that I don't know; marked
disparity in birth ratios is known from a number of arthropod groups,
but I do not recall instances in vertebrates.  Of course, humans
themselves exhibit a small disparity in birth ratios: approximately
105 boys are born for every 100 girls, IIRC.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

IIRC, human males produce (or at least ejaculate) roughly twice as
many &quot;Y&quot; sperm as they do &quot;X&quot; sperm, but the sperm carrying the &quot;Y&quot;
chromosome are slighter and more fragile (that &quot;more males than
females die at every age&quot; applies even before conception, apparently)
and die at a higher rate on the trip through the vagina and uterus.
On the assumption that there is some sort of genetic mechanism behind
this disparity, mutations could easily adjust the ratio of male to
female offspring by adjusting the ratio of &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; sperm.  _Mutatis
mutandis_, I would think that this would work for species using the ZW
sex-chromosome system.  If a species uses, e.g. temperature at which
eggs incubate to determine sex, then, again, presumably some mutation
could change the temperature that triggers changeover from one sex to
the other, and hence the ratio of sexes produced at any given
temperature.  And of course there are other systems (e.g. in many
insect species, males are haploid and females are diploid, but many
insect species have very skewed sex ratios anyway).  So I think this
should be a general principle: sex ratio is adjustable through
evolution.

No contradiction, just a balance.  If the effective population size is
too small you have trouble maintaining genetic variation.  Look at
humans.  We have one fifth the genetic variation as a lot of other
species.  We think that this was due to a population bottle neck
within the last couple hundred thousand years along with several that
might have happened since.  If we hit a situation where we needed that
genetic variation where would we get it?  We'd be out of luck.  I've
seen estimates where the effective population size of humans went down
to around 1000.  It will take some time to get that variation back.

With a smaller effective population you can change allele frequencies
much more rapidly due to selection, but you lose genetic variation
through drift due to things like inbreeding and bad luck.  It isn't
cut and dried.  You have to consider a lot of factors to figure out
what is going on.

While there are other reasons for a nearly 1:1 ratio, so ably
described by other posters, there is one consideration not yet
mentioned. Raising children for hunter-gatherers is so labor intensive
that it requires the efforts of two adults full-time for a couple or
three decades. A separate bachelor herd of unpartnered males might not
be interested in helping support their cousins' children. This need
for a full-time dad is generally considered part of the explanation
for females (physiologically) hiding their time of fertility, etc.

I note also that slightly more males are born than females. Does
anyone know if, in hunter-gatherer societies, the ration of young
adults ended up being more balanced?

Sorry to disagree -- and no games, just straight serious stuff.  The
verb 'effect' meaning to cause to happen, to bring about is not at all
archaic and is quite different from the verb 'affect' meaning to
influence.  It may not be common parlance but that does not mean it
should not be used when needed.  You are right that the noun 'affect'
is pronounced differently than the verb but it is hard to make that
distinction when writing.

Now just what do you mean by 'stand by'?  Are you on your feet
adjacent to a printout of your earlier post or are you in a special
inactive mode, ready to become activated in case you need to effect
some particular result?

&gt; I suppose that if there were some kind of evolutionary advantage to
&gt; different numbers of males and females, then a way could be found. After
&gt; all, sexual dimorphism does appear in some mammal species. However, it
&gt; seems to me that because of the way an individual's sex is determined,
&gt; the system is set up for a 50/50 split. (I hope an entomologist can
&gt; explain how bees really do it. Hormones must have something to do with
&gt; it.) So because that trait is so hard to change, I think that species
&gt; find ways to cope with that limitation in the setup.

&gt;&gt; In the human species, wouldn't it be an evolutionary advantage to have
&gt;&gt; lots
&gt;&gt; of females and a few men, similar to a pride of lions?

&gt; It would? How? I'm not aware of lions being born disproportionately
&gt; female. Have you researched where male lions go? Horses have harems, too
&gt; ... and bachelor herds for the stallions who don't have harems.

Okay, bad example, but I'm sure there are examples of animal populations
where females are born in mumbers significantly greater than males

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Aren't females more valuable, evolutionarily speaking?

&gt; Why do you say so?
">

Sloppy thinking, probably.
Originally, I was thinking along the lines of the idea that because females
are limited in their ability to reproduce and pass on their genes (about one
a year) and males are not so limited (about 5 times a night, as I recall
from my younger days) then I came to the conclusion that the quickest way to
populate a planet would be to have many women in it serviced by a few men
(sounds great to me!)
Then I remembered that it's not about the general population of the species
as a whole, but the reproduction and continuation of individual genes, so it
wouldn't matter if those genes were passed on via a male or female, but then
I came back around to thinking that it's possible for a man to spread his
genes much further than a woman, which would favour men, but then I got even
more confused. ;-(

&gt; Natural selection doesn't care about the good of the species.  Okay,
&gt; strictly speaking, natural selection is not the sort of thing that can
&gt; care about anything, any more than gravity or density is, but the
&gt; point is, if a trait better enables the individual who bears it to
&gt; pass on his (or her) genes, that trait will become more common,
&gt; regardless of its effects on the species as a whole.
">

Eventually, I realized that,(dumb, I know) which is why I then started
thinking that if it is easier for a man to pass on his genes than it is for
a woman, then evolutionarily speaking, why aren't there more men?
Which THEN led me to thinking that if the situation favoured more men and
less women, then male reproduction would be further restricted by the lack
of availability of women, which would in turn favour women, then my poor
brain started to frazzle simply thinking about the conundrum. ;-(

Maybe I should do less thinking.heh.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Suppose we start out with a situation where, say, four girls are born
&gt; for every boy.  For this analysis, we will ignore complications such
&gt; as childhood deaths, differential death rates for males and females,
&gt; adultery, lifelong celibacy, infertility, and such, and assume
&gt; everyone marries and has children.  In such a situation, the average
&gt; man, assuming replacement level reproduction, will have five children,
&gt; while each of his four wives has an average of 1.25 children.

Why would each wife have less than 2 children?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Therefore, a son will, on average, give you four times as many
&gt; grandchildren as a daughter.  So any mutations that make you more
&gt; likely to produce male offspring than female will have a very high
&gt; fitness, assuming they have no other, antagonistic effects.  As long
&gt; as females outnumber males, male offspring will be more valuable *from
&gt; the standpoint of the individual's genes*.  Obviously, this will
&gt; reverse as soon as males start to outnumber females.  So no matter
&gt; what is good for the species as a whole, natural selection will favor
&gt; a rough balance of the sexes.
">

Mmmmmmokay.
But could you explain that as if you were talking to Homer Simpson?
;-)
I still don't see why women would be limited to 1.25 children.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Note that the above makes a number of tacit assumptions, which don't
&gt; hold for all species.  Boys and girls are about equally expensive to
&gt; raise.  If one sex is much more expensive to raise than the other,
&gt; this will factor into which sex it pays to have more of.  Humans tend
&gt; not to mate with very close kin, as do many other species.  In species
&gt; where offspring of the same parents mate with each other, then
&gt; daughters do outnumber sons, since there is no advantage to producing
&gt; more sons if they're going to end up competing for the same very
&gt; limited pool of mates (and since the winner will mate with all of them
&gt; anyway).

&gt;&gt; Aren't females more valuable, evolutionarily speaking?
&gt;&gt; If so, shouldn't there be more of them? (Maybe I wish there was!)

&gt;&gt; Please excuse a question from a layman, but I'm interested in knowing why
&gt;&gt; the current human population is split between males and females almost
&gt;&gt; 50/50.
&gt;&gt; In the human species, wouldn't it be an evolutionary advantage to have
&gt;&gt; lots
&gt;&gt; of females and a few men, similar to a pride of lions?
&gt;&gt; Aren't females more valuable, evolutionarily speaking?
&gt;&gt; If so, shouldn't there be more of them? (Maybe I wish there was!)

&gt; I think sex ratios in general are tackled in detail in &quot;The Red
&gt; Queen.&quot; Which is a wonderful book for many other reasons as well.

&gt; Short answer: whatever is rarer becomes more valuable. So in a
&gt; population that has 'extra' females, there's an advantage to any gene
&gt; line that can produce more males to cash in on the surplus. And vice
&gt; versa. The net result is a slight wobble around 50/50.

I appreciate that answer, thanks

I can imagine triploid species that need three individuals sexually

that exist in nature? :D

&gt;&gt; No contradiction, just a balance.  If the effective population size is

&quot;around 1000&quot; does not equal 8. Actually, the bottleneck according to
the flood story would be 5 humans, since Noah's sons would not count
separately from Noah and his wife (unless she had been extracurricular
while he was off ark building).

I've been thinking about buying a boat (one of these:
http://www.yachtingnz.org.nz/tracker/ ). What puts me off is the amount
of time involved. I expect building a boat means you spend even less
time with your spouse.

That does not exist, one major (but not the only) reason being that
meiosis does not work for triploid cells.  There is no good way to get
from triploid to haploid with the machinery modern cells possess. Then
there is the problem of getting three distinctly different individuals
together for fertilization.

There are indeed many triploid species, the common banana is one, but
they reproduce vegetatively.
