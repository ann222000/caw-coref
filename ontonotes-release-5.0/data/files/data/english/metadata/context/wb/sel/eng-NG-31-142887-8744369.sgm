(CNN) -- More rain brought more grief to the already-drenched Midwest,
pushing rivers and streams past their banks, while a new round of storms
spawned possible twisters that left a trail of damage.

Two people take a boat down flooded Main Street in Ottawa, Ohio, on Friday.

Severe weather swept through Michigan on Friday, with a possible tornado
touchdown in the town of Fenton, according to affiliate WNEM. The area was
under a curfew after the storm, which destroyed several homes and knocked
down trees, the station reported.

But it's the flooding -- the worst in almost a century in some areas --
that's causing the most misery.

In Illinois, Gov. Rod Blagojevich declared five counties state disaster
areas Friday after seeing the extent of the flooding, the Chicago Tribune
reported.

&quot;Everything you have, everything you worked for is gone right now,&quot; Vicky
Metzger, a resident of St. Charles, Illinois, told CNN affiliate CLTV.

&quot;It's out of our control. Mother Nature overtook us, there's not a thing we
can do now,&quot; she said.

The floods have been blamed for at least 17 deaths, according to an
Associated Press count. Hundreds of homes have been damaged.

Meanwhile, about 200,000 customers remained without power in the Chicago
area Friday after severe storms moved through the region Thursday evening, a
ComEd spokesman told affiliate WGN.

Thousands of passengers at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport were
significantly delayed early Friday as 90 percent of departures were running
late or very late overnight.

The weather also cut power to parts of the O'Hare complex, witnesses said
Friday.

In flooded Ottawa, Ohio, emergency crews patrolled by boat looking for
anyone in need of help as many of the city streets remained submerged.

But people weren't the only ones in need of assistance.

The Coast Guard helped to rescue about 70 pure-bred cats from a flooded home
Friday, CNN's David Mattingly reported.

Their owners refused to leave the animals behind as the waters rose. After
three days, the couple finally got the help they needed to move the cats to
higher ground.  Watch the cats being rescued »

At 9 p.m. ET Friday, flood warnings were in effect for parts of Kansas,
Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and South
Dakota.

Earlier, bad weather played havoc with travel in the Midwest and Southeast.

An Air France flight from Paris to Chicago was diverted to Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, where passengers became restive while being forced to wait on the
plane for seven hours, CNN affiliate WISN reported.

&quot;Forcing us to sit seven hours on a plane and not even let us sit in here
[the airport terminal] while they sort it out; leaving us on a
non-air-conditioned plane for seven hours until they got customs people here
was unforgivable,&quot; a passenger told WISN.

Passengers also got stuck on a plane for hours in Georgia.

In Atlanta, a major hub for Delta Air Lines, thunderstorms tied up air
traffic, forcing authorities to divert more than 30 planes to nearby
airports, a company spokeswoman said.

&quot;The weather has been a nightmare with diversions,&quot; Delta spokeswoman Susan
West said.

Scores of passengers on a flight from the Dominican Republic to Atlanta were
kept on board a Delta MD-88 for more than five hours after being rerouted to
Columbus, Georgia.

Bryan Pettigrew, a passenger on Flight 242, said that after his plane
landed, refueled and was taxiing to the gate, its wing clipped a nearby
Boeing 757.

&quot;There were a lot of [planes] in a small area ... and, as the plane was
being positioned, the wing of Flight 242 grazed the nose of a 757,&quot; West
said.

No one was injured, and the larger 757 was undamaged, West said. Delta
eventually sent another plane to ferry the passengers to Atlanta.

Nashville International Airport in Tennessee also had weather problems
overnight, with up to 80 percent of its flights running late or very late.

Meanwhile, a heat wave continues to add to the misery.

A 7-month-old baby in St. Louis, Missouri, and a 2-year-old toddler near
Cincinnati, Ohio, died Thursday after being left in hot cars, CNN affiliate
WLWT reported.

Cincinnati public schools canceled classes Friday as temperatures flirted
with 100 degrees, WLWT reported.

After touring flood-stricken Findlay and other towns Thursday in northwest
Ohio, Gov. Ted Strickland said, &quot;Mother Nature was not kind to us.&quot;  See
images of flooding from all over »

Bucyrus, Ohio, endured 9 inches of rain in about a 24-hour period, he said.

Strickland has declared an emergency in nine counties and promised to ask
the federal government for assistance.

&quot;The major problem was a decision of Mother Nature to pour large amounts of
water on this region and other regions across our country in a very short
period of time,&quot; Strickland said.  See tips for surviving floods »

The Des Moines River rose after 5½ inches of rain pounded central Iowa.
Streets flooded in Lehigh, Iowa, leaving several homes isolated, CNN
affiliate KCCI reported.

&quot;You want it to stop, but I guess we're pretty good-natured about the whole
deal, but, you know, what do you do? You can't control it,&quot; Lehigh homeowner
Mark Johnson told KCCI as his dog swam around.

Mary Lovejoy of Omaha, Nebraska, ended up sleeping with her grandchildren in
a park after storms ripped the roof off her house, CNN affiliate KETV
reported. Rain pouring through the roof ruined most of the family's
possessions, including their clothes, and their food spoiled during a power
outage, Lovejoy told the station.

A local church gave her $20 to buy groceries, but it didn't go very far.

&quot;That's what I'm worried about, is getting them food and getting them their
school clothes and stuff and trying to get back some of the stuff we lost,&quot;
a tearful Lovejoy told KETV.

President Bush declared a major disaster in three Minnesota counties
Thursday, making federal funding available to flood victims
