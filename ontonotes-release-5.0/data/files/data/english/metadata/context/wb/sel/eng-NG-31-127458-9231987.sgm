My lovely other half has decided that it's my birthday, and she's run
out of Land Rover stuff to buy me, she's going to get me a compressor
for my soon to be finished workshop.

One she's seen in Machine Mart (what a girl!) are about £120. So thats
my budget. Any recommendation?

What do you want to use it for? A sensible spec. for continual impact
wrench use would be very different from that needed for a little light
airbrush use.

get atleast 2.5-3hp and as big a tank as you can afford. I struggle to
spray big panels with a 30L tank - you can just do it if you are
careful and can polish the edge in afterwards but more capacity would
be great!

Thats what I did when I got the plasma cutter that eats air.

The text in the catalogues can be very misleading.

Thank you all,
The reason i didnt mention what I was going to use it for was because
i didnt really know. A bit of spraying is likely

The one that Derek mentioned
http://www.machinemart.co.uk/shop/product/details/teigerteiger

was the one I was looking at which seems the right price and size. The
only advice I was given by a mate supposedly in the know was to get a
50ltr tank which gives you a but more &quot;range&quot; when spraying. With the
above compressor, what air tools would i be able to run with it?

I'm confused as to why a large tank is supposed to be better for spraying -
surely a smaller tank just requires more frequent input/top up from the
compressor, as the air is drawn down by whatever tools are being used? I
would have thought that tank size was neutral (within reason) - a 25l tank
just requiring topped up by the compressor twice as often as a 50l tank at
the same filled pressure, with no impact on the tool performance?....k

Big list mate ( I think Netto did a load last week so likely still some
about very cheap ) Spray gun, Shutz gun, air ratchet , impact driver,
nibbler, cutoff tool , metal shears, drill , airline,grinder, pop riveter
( saves a load of grief), stapler/nailgun etc etc because you are not using
it on a production line the compressor gets time to catch up though I reckon
spraying say the side of 101 might be pushing it a bit 7cfm is a fair
rate.Machine mart usually post a consumption table (optomistic IMO) or check
on this list for  cfm and your christmas list

When spraying with a small tank you run out of air - which means you
have to stop and wait for the tank to refil again.
I could get half a car bonnet/roof out of mine before having to stop
and wait for a minute before doing the other half - obviuosly this
means that you can end up with a visible line in the spraying where
the wet edge has dryed (which can take some polishing out afterwards!)
.
When it runs out of puff it also doesnt spray properly. my gun starts
blowing big lumps rather than a nice fine spray when it runs out of
air pressure..

I was using a HVLP gun and a 2.5hp compressor (which has a lot more
grunt that the 1.5hp ones like the OP is looking at but a 30l tank) -
and even that couldnt keep up with the amount of air that the spray
gun wanted.

With air tools - running my cheap impact wrench at 90psi I get maybe
20-30 seconds of go from it before i can hear the compressor kick in
again to recharge the tank - There isnt enough air to take all the
stubborn nuts off a single 101 wheel without a wait for it to
recharge.

thinking further - this would be true if you had a really really
powerful pump/compressor attached to your tank.
It needs to produce more air than you can use - but like i said - my
compressor wont do that and it is higher rated than the ones the OP is
considering.

yes kept it and plan to do the same! :) im going to build a shelf to
hold it round the back of my shed (compressor is going in the shed in
a heavily insulated box to cut down on the noise!)

It is simple to plumb up twin recievers on a compressor from what i
have read. You just need to T it in. Since a pipe on my compressor
broke its using 101 braided hose already to feed the regulator so
should be easy!.

I have all the 101 pipework stashed in the loft - im sure there were
some T pieces in there.

Just gonna put one of them in before the output regulator/water trap.
Will probably do it all through some of the quick release connectors
too so I can move it about easily if needed.

I've got a small one here, 2HP/25l, and I've stopped using it in favour of
one of these:

http://www.axminster.co.uk/product-Axminster-AW30HP-3hp-Direct-Driven...

although it's gone up about 15 quid since I bought it!

nice bit of kit but it needs a good supply - running it on a too-long, not
fat enough extension lead to it failing to re-start.  Now it's on a shorter
fatter extension it kicks in OK.

I meant to add most of the compressors apart from the swingeingly expensive
kit use Euro std connectors which cost a bomb
http://www.abbeypowertools.co.uk/subprod/air-line-couplings-0001579.aspx
unless of course you buy in packs from screwfix where they are as cheap as
chips ignore the blister pack ones on ebay they tend to leak air due to a
slight design
difference.
