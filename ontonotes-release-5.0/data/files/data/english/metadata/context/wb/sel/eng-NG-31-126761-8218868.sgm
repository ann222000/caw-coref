IDEAS KILL: SCIENCE SHINES A LIGHT ON PORT ARTHUR DEATHS

April 2006

A few months before the Port Arthur Massacre, a glamorous current
affairs presenter showed Australia how easy it was to get the guns
used in massacres.  She demonstrated every step, emphasising that she
knew nothing about guns and had never held a licence. She filmed the
guns lying on the street and cut in similar scenes from after
massacres.  An activist showed her (and us) how to load and shoot the
guns. She showed us how these guns 'designed for killing people' are
easy to use, then blew apart a target like the head of a victim.

Then a gun control activist offered a key to worldwide infamy: &quot;We are
going to have a massacre in Tasmania like those elsewhere!&quot;  He sold
the massacre in Tasmania as certainty, almost destiny.
They Showed the way to Death

After seeing this show, Allen Burrows travelled from Victoria to
Tasmania, bought a gun as he had been shown by the program, and killed
himself.  Coroner Ian Matterson found he acted on a script provided by
that current affairs segment.

In the study of suicide, media reporting has been shown to cause extra
suicides and even murder-suicides.  Even in self-destruction people
copy other similar people.

It was shown as early as 1980 that car and aircraft fatal accidents
rose after publicity for suicides.  Some drivers and pilots were
influenced enough to take others with them in death (Phillips 1980).
Many lives have since been saved because reporters changed the way we
report suicide.
As for Suicide, So for Other Violence

But what about other dramatic acts of violence? Airline hostage
crises, car chases, home invasions, terror bombings, arson, family
murder-suicides, and mass shootings -  these stories come in waves
then fade away.

The string of mass killings was partly caused by the way our media
culture sends the script to the killers.  Review the evidence:

* News and current affairs reporting gives powerful rewards for
horror crimes - worldwide name recognition and repeating of the
killers' words.
* The reporting style that causes suicide contagion is normal for
mass shootings.
* The crimes are tightly clustered in time, a new one while the
last one is still echoing around the current affairs shows.
* The crimes follow a very few story lines; postal worker kills
after dismissal; trench-coat mafia kills at school; lonely obsessed
oddball kills in a crowded place.
* Only the first killer in the Australian series, Knight, had a
prior history of serious violence; the subsequent ones have a prior
history of excessive passivity (Cantor 2001).
* Mass killers keep media reports of earlier massacres, and go out
of their way to get the same weapons and act the same way.

Not A Virus - A Script

Stephen Pinker in 'How the Mind Works' addresses the Port Arthur
massacre as following a script that cuts across cultures: the 'amok',
a male who revenges his lack of status in a suicidal murder spree.
Forensic psychiatrist Professor Paul Mullen of Monash University has
worked with mass killers, and says they are following a taught
cultural script.  Professor Mullen made it clear that Bryant wanted to
be the very worst mass killer: &quot;He asked me: &quot;Have I got the record?&quot;&quot;

So what is the script Bryant read? The world's media lavished coverage
on massacres from around the world and his own country. Both TV and
newspaper reporting over and over gave prominence to the names and
words of mass killers and said how easy it would be to happen here.

A few months after the current affairs program that led to Allen
Burrows suicide, Thomas Hamilton murdered a group of children in
Dunblane.  The media went berserk.  They showed the script Thomas
Hamilton followed; they emphasised his name, the guns he used, the
planning, his lost social standing and the everyday innocence of the
location.  They rounded up the usual activists again to tell us how it
would surely happen here next.

As the frenzy started to die down Martin Bryant drove to Port Arthur
and launched his own killing spree.

At the time, commentators emphasised the 'mysteriousness' of why these
killings happen.  They posited dark forces in our society and violence
at the root of human nature.  If the idea is true that a culturally
taught script caused the massacres, it should throw light on the
'mystery'.

Why Tasmania, not Queensland which had even easier gun laws?
Significantly, there was a difference in the media scripts in
1995-96.  Anti-gun activism had a high profile in Tasmania. Activist
media rhetoric repeatedly emphasised the concept 'we are going to have
a massacre in Tasmania'.  To the wrong person this scripts the
possibility and frames it as destiny.

What makes a person choose to do such a thing? Rewards and guidance.
These killers were nobodies until their massacres.  Media reports
reward the killers with name recognition, repeat their words and
highlight their insignificant lives.  The reports show how to get the
guns and use them, none more explicitly than the report in question.

Why did the mass shootings stop? Many authorities believed that there
would be more massacres despite the new laws, because we thought the
availability of guns was the cause and only some would be eliminated.

Most importantly Martin Bryant was captured alive.  According to the
script theory, this inhibits copycats because they see the perpetrator
face the consequences.

The script model says that faced with uncertainty, a person looks to
another similar person as a guide.  Bryant, deciding whether to plead
guilty, asked what Julian Knight, the perpetrator of the Hoddle Street
massacre, pleaded.

The innocent victims of Martin Bryant, scripted not to resist, hid
under tables and held still while he killed them.

Now consider the 2002 Monash University killings.  A foreign student
was afraid to account to his family for failing his course.  He was
mentally ill, and he saw a form of escape in the amok script.  Weeks
of media coverage of the Washington snipers showed the way.  He killed
two people, but heroic bystanders prevented him from killing others or
himself.  The message was reinforced - the massacre script was not
working anymore.

The cultural script idea makes sense of acts that once seemed
senseless.
The Danger Was Known

Was this danger known in 1995? Yes.  Phillips' research on suicide
from 1980 onward roused heavy controversy in media and public health
circles.  Cramer in 1993 detailed how Time and Newsweek articles were
kept and followed by American mass killers. Guidelines to prevent
contagion and copycat violence were hotly debated in the early 1990s,
and the ideas were well known in the news business.  To this day
individual newspapers enforce guidelines on suicide reporting but the
Australian Press Council guidelines merely acknowledge the possibility
of some impact.

This single media story did not alone cause the Port Arthur massacre,
but the evidence is persuasive that it was part of the cause.  The
news culture probably caused not just one, but a string of massacres.
Our broadcast and print journalists, with their activist sources, gave
Martin Bryant the idea, showed him how and offered huge rewards -
incentive to murder 35 innocent people.
