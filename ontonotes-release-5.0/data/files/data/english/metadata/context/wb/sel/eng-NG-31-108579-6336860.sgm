Reposting of an old article with a message that remains significant.
This book, "The TMJ Iatroepidemic", is still available.  If interested,
please email me for information.  The full thread is available on Google
and it's quite interesting to review.  What has and hasn't changed???

I'm hoping this post will link up with the old one for convenience.
We'll see.

&gt; Somehow this odd word: iatroepidemic,  easily (seems to) evokes the
&gt; idea that it is about &quot;blame&quot;.  This is not true.  It is a word that
&gt; should tell us that we need to go back to the books and study where
&gt; things went wrong in order to get going (again) in a correct direction
&gt; where there is less chance of harming patients because of the
&gt; application of medical ideas to patient care.
&gt; An iatroepidemic results from a process involved with the development
&gt; of medical knowledge.  The phases of transcription, translation, and
&gt; decay are crucial to the development of medical knowledge.  Sometimes
&gt; what is thought to be a good idea is discovered in time not to have
&gt; been such a good idea afterall.  It might have been a terrible idea
&gt; but until it is understood where the ideas went wrong... well, what is
&gt; to say the next ideas are any better?  Research has the potential to
&gt; keep harmful practices away from masses of patients... but if the
&gt; research its flawed... we still risk this problem.  Science is still
&gt; at the hands of mankind.  It is not divine.  Errors can and do happen.
&gt; There is an enormous difference between an iatroepidemic in its pure
&gt; sense and malpractice or worse yet, fraud in healthcare.   Fraud and
&gt; negligence are not the same matters.  And an iatroepidemic and
&gt; malpractice and negligence are not the same matters.  But there is a
&gt; point at which there is or will be overlapping.   For example, if a
&gt; maxillofacial surgeon in the USA implanted Proplast into a patient's
&gt; TMJ in the year 2000, the innocence of that particular tangent of the
&gt; TMJ iatroepidemic no longer applies.  If in 1986, a maxillofacial
&gt; surgeon misrepresented the materials used by Vitek in TMJ implants,
&gt; the misrepresentation of fact would need to be investigated.  Who is
&gt; to say that misrepresentation existed?  If an article had been
&gt; published in the professional journals advising surgeons to advise
&gt; their patients incorrectly,  you can see how complicated the matter
&gt; can become.  Would the surgeon have been to &quot;blame&quot; or was the surgeon
&gt; just following the profession's leaders who were published and
&gt; therefore &quot;authoritative&quot; on their subject matter?
&gt; For those of you who have read the book &quot;The TMJ Iatroepidemic&quot;, you
&gt; might realize that the book delivered more than one message.  There is
&gt; ample ambiguity, there is hyperbole, there is metaphor, and there is a
&gt; feeling of human imperfection and struggle.  The content of the
&gt; collective text reveals certain attitudes which are known to foster
&gt; iatroepidemics.   There comes a point at which a particular
&gt; individual's or group's attitude crosses the line between what is
&gt; understandably acceptable to those sincerely wanting to understand and
&gt; what is not.  This &quot;line crossing&quot; can be experienced by reading that
&gt; book.
&gt; Deciding how to weave the story that was needed to be told in order to
&gt; give life to the TMJ iatroepidemic was not a simple decision.   Like
&gt; any good recipe, the &quot;chef&quot; needs to decide how much of any single
&gt; ingredient is just the right amount for the desired flavor... in the
&gt; case of this book, no matter how you cut it, it seems there is too
&gt; much of everything.  But in the real world, this is exactly how it is
&gt; for the patients and many of the doctors who were, are, or continue to
&gt; be caught up in this dilemma.  There is just too much anger, too much
&gt; arrogance, too much bitterness, ... too much lack of trust, ... and
&gt; too much harm to the patients harmed.
&gt; When reading that book, if the reader thinks it is a struggle to
&gt; understand what is what... it is nothing compared to the actual living
&gt; of the patient who struggles to understand what is what... what was
&gt; what... what will be.
&gt; The TMJ iatroepidemic got its start because of what was thought to be
&gt; good medicine but turned out to be not as good as it needed to be. In
&gt; some aspects, it turned into terrible disaster.  This in and of itself
&gt; is a human tragedy but not a crime.  The matter and question of crime
&gt; is not the same as the iatroepidemic.  But without the iatroepidemic,
&gt; the matters thought to be criminal might not have had a breeding
&gt; ground.  Opportunism is a powerful motivator.   The question of
&gt; criminal activity arrives in various tangents of the iatroepidemic.
&gt; This is another reason why thorough understanding of the harm can not
&gt; be underestimated if we are to fully understand this problem
&gt; historically as it relates to treatment (physical and psychological)
&gt; today and tomorrow.
&gt; It is my belief as a &quot;TMJ patient&quot; (I believe the TMJ is central to my
&gt; suffering) that much of what happened, especially to implant
&gt; recipients, will simply never be known and the outcome of what lies
&gt; ahead will come when and if it arrives in the future.  These people,
&gt; the TMJ implant recipients of materials that failed to be safe or
&gt; effective are an orphan population by definition.  Defined, this
&gt; means: approximately less than 250,000 Amercians -- (whatever the
&gt; decided percentage is, I don't know -- so we should remember that the
&gt; number is dynamic) and as a general rule,  orphan diseases are not
&gt; given the attention they deserve mostly because of economics.
&gt; What does all this mean anyway???
