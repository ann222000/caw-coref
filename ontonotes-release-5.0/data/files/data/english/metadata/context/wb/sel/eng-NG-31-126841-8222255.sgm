Bill Kristol: On the Train to Delusionville
by Arianna Huffington
July 16, 2007
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/bill-kristol-on-the-...

I know it's a pretty high bar, but Bill Kristol, the founder of the
Project for a New American Century that spawned the Iraq war, the man
whose editorials often seem to be inserted directly into the president's
speeches, and who once boasted that &quot;Dick Cheney does send over someone
to pick up 30 copies of [The Weekly Standard] every Monday,&quot; has now
just written the single most deceptive piece of the entire war.

The charitable view is that he's lost his mind. The less charitable view
is that he's now officially surpassed Dick Cheney as the most
intellectually dishonest member of the neocon establishment (the highest
of all high bars). The truth-shattering piece appeared yesterday on the
front page of the Washington Post Outlook section. It is entitled &quot;Why
Bush Will Be A Winner.&quot;

I had a preview of this deluded triumphalist drivel a couple of days
earlier -- on Thursday afternoon specifically. Even more specifically, I
was on the 4:00 pm Amtrak Acela from New York to Washington.

Kristol was sitting a row behind me, talking on his cell phone with
someone who apparently shared his optimism. &quot;'Precipitous withdrawal'
really worked,&quot; I overheard him say, clearly referring to the
president's use of the term in that morning's press conference. &quot;How
many times did he use it? Three? Four?&quot; he asked his interlocutor, and
the conversation continued with a round of metaphorical back-slapping
for the clever phrase they had &quot;come up with.&quot;

I, of course, have no idea who was on the other end. Tony Snow, perhaps?
After all, he and Kristol were colleagues before Snow left Fox. But
whoever it was, the emphasis during their conversation on the
significance of the &quot;clever&quot; phrase has been emblematic of the White
House prepping of the president.

Instead of sending their boss out with the real facts or logical
arguments, Bush's aides and their friends (see Kristol) concoct some
nonsense phrase in the spin lab, hand it to him and tell him to go out
there and repeat it as often as he can. The latest is &quot;precipitous
withdrawal.&quot; It's the new &quot;cut and run.&quot; It's actually not all that new:
back in January 1969, Richard Nixon used it again and again in his
famous &quot;Silent Majority&quot; speech: &quot;The precipitate withdrawal of American
forces from Vietnam would be a disaster not only for South Vietnam but
for the United States and for the cause of peace.&quot; Again and again
throughout the speech, Nixon used the phrase to paint the nightmarish
consequences of a &quot;precipitate withdrawal&quot; from Vietnam. Almost forty
years later, George Bush is using the slightly tweaked &quot;precipitous
withdrawal&quot; to paint his own nightmarish scenario of what will happen if
American forces leave Iraq. And for that, apparently, we have Bill
Kristol to thank. At least partially.

In an interview with David Carr in March 2003, Kristol sounded just as
pleased with himself and with his president as he's sounding today. &quot;I'm
a little amused but pleased,&quot; he said, &quot;that the bus has become more
crowded and that it is headed in the right direction.&quot; Well, the bus is
a lot less crowded today -- and a lot more dilapidated. But Kristol
remains as confident as ever that he and Cheney and their other neocon
friends are still steering it in the right direction.

It is truly incredible that, at this late date in the Iraq debacle,
there are still people who believe that a few well-focus-grouped phrases
will change the tragic facts on the ground.

My chance encounter on the 4:00 pm Amtrak was a glimpse into their
thinking. Kristol's Washington Post piece is the entire Bush-era
conservative brain laid bare.

It isn't pretty. In fact, the Washington Post should have put some kind
of warning on the piece for pregnant women, heart patients, and anyone
with an allergy to bullshit. And if the pipeline from Kristol to the
White House works the same for this piece as for &quot;precipitous
withdrawal,&quot; the country is in even worse shape than we thought.

So what did he say? I'll take it in order, and focus on national
security.

After allowing that the war has been &quot;difficult,&quot; he writes that &quot;we now
seem to be on course to a successful outcome.&quot;

Really? Not only does he give no evidence for this, not only does he
ignore all the overwhelmingly contradictory evidence; he also
conveniently neglects to even define what a &quot;successful outcome&quot; would
be.

Then comes an onslaught of lies:

&quot;The war in Afghanistan has gone reasonably well.&quot;

Afghanistan is in fact teetering on the precipice of chaos. Indeed, 2006
saw the highest number of coalition deaths since the war began. The next
highest before that? 2005. The Taliban is making a comeback and unrest
among Afghans is growing. Obviously, Kristol's definition of &quot;reasonably
well&quot; is very different than the experts'.

Then he's onto Pakistan, where, according to Kristol, &quot;al-Qaeda may once
again have a place where it can plan, organize and train.&quot; But,
according to the National Intelligence estimate, there is no &quot;may&quot; about
it, and this is not a future possibility, but a current reality. And, in
what is unequivocally one of the greatest failures of the Bush
administration, the NIE report concludes that al-Qaeda is &quot;better
positioned&quot; to &quot;strike the West&quot; than at any time since 9/11.

But no worries, because, according to Kristol, &quot;These Waziristan havens
may well have to be dealt with in the near future. I assume Bush will
deal with them, using some combination of air strikes and special
operations.&quot;

Hear that? We're apparently just going to sort of casually start bombing
Pakistan. That's the sort of thing that would make me nervous if I
thought Kristol had any pull with the White House. Oh, wait...

Then on to Iraq. Just imagine what would have happened if we hadn't gone
in:

&quot;...Saddam Hussein would be alive and in power and, I dare say,
victorious...&quot;

Victorious? What does that mean? This, according to Kristol: &quot;...He
might well have restarted his nuclear program, and his connections with
al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups would be intact or revived and even
strengthened...&quot;

Ah, yes, that old, completely discredited war horse, the
Saddam/al -Qaeda connection rides again. That'll no-doubt be high on the
setlist when Kristol and Cheney are still touring with BushMania in
2012.

Then, putting aside his future delusions, Kristol treats us to his
current ones:

&quot;We are routing al-Qaeda in Iraq, we are beginning to curb the
Iranian-backed sectarian Shiite militias and we are increasingly able to
protect more of the Iraqi population...&quot;

Actually, a growing percentage of the Iraqi population is no longer even
in Iraq. Since we invaded Iraq, around 2 million Iraqis have left the
country, with another 2 million still there, but having fled their
homes.

But Kristol is just warming up. Now he starts to swing for the fences:

&quot;The fact is that military progress on the ground in Iraq in the past
few months has been greater than even surge proponents like me expected,
and political progress is beginning to follow.&quot;

Preposterous. What &quot;political progress&quot; is he talking about? The fact
that the Iraqi parliament is about to take the month of August off? Even
President Bush's own &quot;mixed bag&quot; interim report on the benchmarks found
little or no positive movement on political goals.

Gosh, Bill, how can we keep this great success going?

&quot;It would help if the administration would make its case more
effectively and less apologetically.&quot;

In other words: they should be repeating more of the clever phrases he
sends over to them.

Also:

&quot;It would help if Bush had more aides who believed in his policy, who
understood that the war is winnable and who didn't desperately want to
get back in (or stay in) the good graces of the foreign policy
establishment...&quot; (i.e. more people like Kristol).

&quot;If the president,&quot; Kristol concludes, &quot;stands with Petraeus and
progress continues on the ground, Bush will be able to prevent a sellout
in Washington.&quot;

What does he mean by &quot;a sellout?&quot; Is he already dusting off the
stabbed-in-the-back theory from Vietnam: that, of course, we could have
won, if only the soldiers hadn't been stabbed in the back by the media
and anti-war liberals.

Kristol has plans for the next president too: &quot;Following through to
secure the victory in Iraq and to extend its benefits to neighboring
countries will be the task of the next president.&quot;

Extend its benefits? Hear that 2008 GOP presidential candidates? Bill
Kristol thinks you should run on a platform of &quot;I pledge to take what we
did in Iraq to even more countries around the world.&quot;

For Kristol, &quot;What it comes down to is this: If Petraeus succeeds in
Iraq, and a Republican wins in 2008, Bush will be viewed as a successful
president. I like the odds....&quot;

I'll take that bet. And you can, too. Kristol will be sitting in for an
online chat at the Washington Post Monday at noon. It's entitled:
&quot;Outlook: Bush Will Win.&quot;

===================

Why Bush Will Be A Winner
By William Kristol
July 15, 2007
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/13/AR200...

I suppose I'll merely expose myself to harmless ridicule if I make the
following assertion: George W. Bush's presidency will probably be a
successful one.

Let's step back from the unnecessary mistakes and the self-inflicted
wounds that have characterized the Bush administration. Let's look at
the broad forest rather than the often unlovely trees. What do we see?
First, no second terrorist attack on U.S. soil -- not something we could
have taken for granted. Second, a strong economy -- also something that
wasn't inevitable.

And third, and most important, a war in Iraq that has been very
difficult, but where -- despite some confusion engendered by an almost
meaningless &quot;benchmark&quot; report last week -- we now seem to be on course
to a successful outcome.

The economy first: After the bursting of the dot-com bubble, followed by
the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, we've had more than five years of steady
growth, low unemployment and a stock market recovery. Did this just
happen? No. Bush pushed through the tax cuts of 2001 and especially 2003
by arguing that they would produce growth. His opponents predicted dire
consequences. But the president was overwhelmingly right. Even the
budget deficit, the most universally criticized consequence of the tax
cuts, is coming down and is lower than it was when the 2003 supply-side
tax cuts were passed.

Bush has also (on the whole) resisted domestic protectionist pressures
(remember the Democratic presidential candidates in 2004 complaining
about outsourcing?), thereby helping sustain global economic growth.

The year 2003 also featured a close congressional vote on Bush's other
major first-term initiative, the Medicare prescription drug benefit.
Liberals denounced it as doing nothing for the elderly; conservatives
worried that it would bust the budget. Experts of all stripes foresaw
great challenges in its implementation. In fact, it has all gone
surprisingly smoothly, providing broad and welcome coverage for seniors
and coming in under projected costs.

So on the two biggest pieces of domestic legislation the president has
gotten passed, he has been vindicated. And with respect to the two
second-term proposals that failed -- private Social Security accounts
and immigration -- I suspect that something similar to what Bush
proposed will end up as law over the next several years.

Meanwhile, 2005-06 saw the confirmation of two Supreme Court nominees,
John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr. Your judgment of these two
appointments will depend on your general view of the courts and the
Constitution. But even if you're a judicial progressive, you have to
admit that Roberts and Alito are impressive judges (well, you don't have
to admit it -- but deep down, you know it). And if you're a conservative
constitutionalist, putting Roberts and Alito on the court constitutes a
huge accomplishment.

What about terrorism? Apart from Iraq, there has been less of it, here
and abroad, than many experts predicted on Sept. 12, 2001. So Bush and
Vice President Cheney probably are doing some important things right.
The war in Afghanistan has gone reasonably well.

Western Pakistan, where President Pervez Musharraf's deals with the
Taliban are apparently creating something like havens for terrorists, is
an increasing problem. That's why our intelligence agencies are worried
about a resurgent al-Qaeda -- because al-Qaeda may once again have a
place where it can plan, organize and train. These Waziristan havens may
well have to be dealt with in the near future. I assume Bush will deal
with them, using some combination of air strikes and special operations.

As for foreign policy in general, it has mostly been the usual mixed
bag. We've deepened our friendships with Japan and India; we've had
better outcomes than expected in the two largest Latin American
countries, Mexico and Brazil; and we've gotten friendlier governments
than expected in France and Germany. China is stable. There has been
slippage in Russia. The situation with North Korea is bad but
containable.

But wait, wait, wait: What about Iraq? It's Iraq, stupid -- you (and 65
percent of your fellow Americans) say -- that makes Bush an unsuccessful
president.

Not necessarily. First of all, we would have to compare the situation in
Iraq now, with all its difficulties and all the administration's
mistakes, with what it would be if we hadn't gone in. Saddam Hussein
would be alive and in power and, I dare say, victorious, with the United
States (and the United Nations) by now having backed off sanctions and
the no-fly zone. He might well have restarted his nuclear program, and
his connections with al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups would be intact
or revived and even strengthened.

Still, that's speculative, and the losses and costs of the war are real.
Bush is a war president, and war presidents are judged by whether they
win or lose their war. So to be a successful president, Bush has to win
in Iraq.

Which I now think we can. Indeed, I think we will. In late 2006, I
didn't think we would win, as Bush stuck with the failed
Rumsfeld-Abizaid-Casey strategy of &quot;standing down&quot; as the Iraqis were
able to &quot;stand up,&quot; based on the mistaken theory that if we had a &quot;small
footprint&quot; in Iraq, we'd be more successful. With the new
counterinsurgency strategy announced on Jan. 10, backed up by the troop
&quot;surge,&quot; I think the odds are finally better than 50-50 that we will
prevail. We are routing al-Qaeda in Iraq, we are beginning to curb the
Iranian-backed sectarian Shiite militias and we are increasingly able to
protect more of the Iraqi population.

If we sustain the surge for a year and continue to train Iraqi troops
effectively, we can probably begin to draw down in mid- to late 2008.
The fact is that military progress on the ground in Iraq in the past few
months has been greater than even surge proponents like me expected, and
political progress is beginning to follow. Iran is a problem, and we
will have to do more to curb Tehran's meddling -- but we can. So if we
keep our nerve here at home, we have a good shot at achieving a real,
though messy, victory in Iraq.

But can Bush maintain adequate support at home? Yes. It would help if
the administration would make its case more effectively and less
apologetically. It would help if Bush had more aides who believed in his
policy, who understood that the war is winnable and who didn't
desperately want to get back in (or stay in) the good graces of the
foreign policy establishment.

But Bush has the good fortune of having finally found his Ulysses S.
Grant, or his Creighton Abrams, in Gen. David H. Petraeus. If the
president stands with Petraeus and progress continues on the ground,
Bush will be able to prevent a sellout in Washington. And then he could
leave office with the nation on course to a successful (though painful
and difficult) outcome in Iraq. With that, the rest of the Middle East,
where so much hangs in the balance, could start to tip in the direction
of our friends and away from the jihadists, the mullahs and the
dictators.

Following through to secure the victory in Iraq and to extend its
benefits to neighboring countries will be the task of the next
president. And that brings us to Bush's final test.

The truly successful American presidents tend to find vindication in,
and guarantee an extension of their policies through, the election of a
successor from their own party. Can Bush hand the presidency off to a
Republican who will (broadly) continue along the path of his post-9/11
foreign policy, nominate judges who solidify a Roberts-Alito court, make
his tax cuts permanent and the like?

Sure. Even at Bush's current low point in popularity, the leading GOP
presidential candidates are competitive in the polls with Democratic
Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama. Furthermore, one great
advantage of the current partisan squabbling in Washington is that while
it hurts Bush, it also damages the popularity of the Democratic
Congress-- where both Clinton and Obama serve. A little mutual assured
destruction between the Bush administration and Congress could leave the
Republican nominee, who will most likely have no affiliation with
either, in decent shape.

And what happens when voters realize in November 2008 that, if they
choose a Democrat for president, they'll also get a Democratic Congress
and therefore liberal Supreme Court justices? Many Americans will recoil
from the prospect of being governed by an unchecked triumvirate of
Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. So the chances of a
Republican winning the presidency in 2008 aren't bad.

What it comes down to is this: If Petraeus succeeds in Iraq, and a
Republican wins in 2008, Bush will be viewed as a successful president.

I like the odds.
