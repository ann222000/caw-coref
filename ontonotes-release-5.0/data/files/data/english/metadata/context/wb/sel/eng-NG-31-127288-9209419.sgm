Hi there,

Sage is among the finalists of this year's Les Trophees du Libre competition
in Paris, France.

http://www.tropheesdulibre.org/+Finalists-projects?lang=en

I am going to represent Sage at the finals (each project has to give a 30
minute presentation) and thus prepared some slides available at:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/20071129%20-%20SAGE%20-%20P...

cetril.pdf is the presentation, SAGE_Demo.sws the demo worksheet, and
SAGE_Demo.pdf the PDF version of that demo. The target audience is a group of
people who want to promote open-source but probably are not into mathematics
at all. So presenting that we have a very sophisticated model for p-adic
arithmetic and comparing Sage with Magma might not do the trick. (but Sage is
in the 'scientific software' section, so it is okay to talk a little about
mathematics ;-))

The rules for the competition also indicate what the judges are going to be
looking for:

&quot;&quot;&quot;
All the software will be tested and evaluated according to the criteria set
out below:
- Innovation (coefficient of 3)
- Functionality (coefficient of 3)
- Quality/stability (coefficient of 3)
- Durability (coefficient of 3)
- Utility (coefficient of 4)
- Documentation (coefficient of 3)
- Ease of installation (coefficient of 1)
- General renown (coefficient of -15)
&quot;&quot;&quot;

I believe I've addressed these points implicitly (and I prefer to address them
implicitly) but I'd appreciate feedback on the talk and demo. Also, what else
could go into a demo for non-mathematicians? Is your name missing in the list
of contributes (I generated that from the hg logs)?

Cheers,
Martin

I think this looks really excellent! Possibly there is a typo on page 27.
Did you mean &quot;installation guide&quot; where you said &quot;programming guide&quot;?

I think it looks very good. Just one idea to the point you already
made - I myself haven't heard of magma, before SAGE mentioned it.

I've heard about Matlab, I myself used it a lot, but Python + NumPy +
SciPy can do everything I myself needed in Matlab.

So where SAGE really competes from my point of view is in the
Maple/Mathematica area. This is what should be stressed imho.

Also, that SAGE has a web interface - the notebook() - with sharing
abilities, SSL encryption, etc. So that you can run SAGE on the server
and use it from anywhere. This is something, that Maple/Mathematica
don't have. Neither Giac (also in the final) has it imho.

Another very important point - you just download SAGE, run it and it just works.

You download Giac, and it doesn't work. It cost me many hours to even
compile it, I had to ask the author of Giac to fix the problems (but
he did so quickly), but still, it was like a week, from the first
download, to a running version.

They gave ease of installation a coefficient 1, but it should be 15
instead. If you cannot run it, it doesn't exist.

Here is what I had to do to get Giac running, in February this year:

http://www.google.com/notebook/public/10576738713475585694/BDQIIQwoQ3...

especially browse the old instructions. So you should stress that you
download SAGE, type make and that's it. Or even download the binary,
type ./sage and it runs. When I downloaded the binary of giac (beause
I couldn't make it compile), it didn't run, because they linked to
older versions of libraries than I had.

On page 27 you seem to mention both &quot;SAGE programming guide&quot; and

David,

sorry for the short answer last time, I was in a hurry. I mean the SAGE
programming guide and and the &quot;SAGE Programming for Newbies&quot; book by Ted. I
will clarify this in my slides and include the Installation Guide (which I
forgot).

Martin -- looks great!

Just a few typos:

Outline: Usually people say &quot;pros and cons&quot; instead of &quot;cons and pros&quot;
... *shrug*
p. 13: there's actually a typo in the SAGE window you have going:
admissable -&gt; admissible
p. 16: it's John Bober, not Bobber
p. 21: lots of missing commas between names, and a few typos:
Alexandru Ghitzam -&gt; Alexandru Ghitza
Jen Balakrishnan is repeated
p. 23: bullet point 5, lease -&gt; least
p. 26: bullet point 1, programing -&gt; programming

Hi,

don't you think you should add examples closer to &quot;applied math&quot; as
Discreet Fourier transform, financial math, Finite Element Method, etc
?

Some explanations :
I am a french teacher and if the Jury is not aware of the importance
of p-adic stuff or Elliptic Curve story, it will all appear quiet a
mystery. A lot of research labs, university or schools could be happy
with sage. And i think your presentation should insist on the fact
that SAGE can be used by a huge amount of people and not only
specialists (mathematicians...). It's true that SAGE is great for
professional mathematicians, but it can also do a great job in
education...

More images might help the jury to be convinced of it...

Hope my remarks will help (and let me say your work is very good already...)

Best regards,
philippe Saadé

I have to agree.  The slide where you list p-adic numbers, p-adic
L-functions and p-adic height pairings kinda jumped out at me.  While I'm
obviously interested in that kind of stuff, it won't appeal as much to a
non-specialist audience.

One might argue that as things implemented natively in Sage, these will
count toward the innovation category.  Perhaps, but then you should
emphasize that aspect, and tone down the words that the judges will have
never heard before (ie p-adics).  And I think Philippe does have a point
that Sage does a lot in the innovation category that is more widely
applicable.

Yes.  Like the notebook, interfaces to other programs such as Fortran,
Lisp, PARI, etc., using Python but making it usable for mathematics
via preparsing, very nice 2d graphics, etc.

And i would add a simple image : OpenOffice means that &quot;anybody in the
world&quot; can have access to an &quot;office&quot; suite, which covers 99% of
anybody's need. It's obvious that OpenOffice is NOT the best office
suite and has some limitations.
SAGE might soon be (maybe I'm wrong but...) usable by ANYBODY who
needs to compute maths... or learn maths.

And, IMHO, that should be emphasised ! (how many people in the
audience (not to speak of the jury member's)) have had a bad
experiment in maths and would have loved to use such a software during
their studies or work...

&gt; anybody's need. It's obvious that OpenOffice is NOT the best office
&gt; suite and has some limitations.
&gt; SAGE might soon be (maybe I'm wrong but...) usable by ANYBODY who
&gt; needs to compute maths... or learn maths.

&gt; And, IMHO, that should be emphasised ! (how many people in the
&gt; audience (not to speak of the jury member's)) have had a bad
&gt; experiment in maths and would have loved to use such a software during
&gt; their studies or work...

Agree. This boils down to calculus, so calculus ought to work really
well in SAGE.

&gt; &gt; I have to agree.  The slide where you list p-adic numbers, p-adic
&gt; &gt; L-functions and p-adic height pairings kinda jumped out at me.  While I'm

&gt; &gt; non-specialist audience.

&gt; Definitely completely delete that stuff.   I also recently
&gt; gave a talk (at an AMS meeting in Albuqueque), and it is critical to
&gt; *not* emphasize these sorts of things too much, as I learned the hard
&gt; way.

&gt; &gt; One might argue that as things implemented natively in Sage, these will
&gt; &gt; count toward the innovation category.  Perhaps, but then you should
&gt; &gt; emphasize that aspect, and tone down the words that the judges will have
&gt; &gt; never heard before (ie p-adics).  And I think Philippe does have a point
&gt; &gt; that Sage does a lot in the innovation category that is more widely
&gt; &gt; applicable.

&gt; Yes.  Like the notebook, interfaces to other programs such as Fortran,
&gt; Lisp, PARI, etc., using Python but making it usable for mathematics
&gt; via preparsing, very nice 2d graphics, etc.

Okay, I'll remove the mention of p-adics and add more applied examples. My
Live Demo already was pretty non-pure, though.
