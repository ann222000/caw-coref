It's good, but the heroes are goin doin to easily! These guys defend the
Marvel Universe? No one has come close to taking the Hulk or his crew
down.... Are all the guys in the Hulk's possee stronger than the combined
might of 2, 3, or 4 Earth heroes?

Probably not, but notice it's mostly Hulk doing the fighting and those
guys giving him back-up...and yes, Hulk is stronger than all of his
attackers.

I've been wondering about what it would take to beat Hulk v. 4.0, (or
5.0 or 6, or whatever...)  To wit:

-- what if Rogue (accompanied maybe by Absorbing Man?) laid hands upon
him
and then Juggernaut, Wonder Man, Hercules, and Wolverine all took
turns beating on him

-- could Hank Pym use his Pym Particles to shrink Hulk and the rest of
his
DirtNapBound??

-- taking a page fro Batman v Superman, trick him into grabbing a huge
bunch of electrical wires hooked into New York's grid and then ZAP!

-- taking a page from Spidey v Juggernaut, sink him in quicksand

-- taking a page from Deathstroke , drop a big ass ton o' acid on
him.

-- a nuke dropped on him (point blank)  will make him stronger?
Hmm..worked on the Maestro!

-- a barrage of non-physical attacks: sound and gas. As I wrote in a
post about &quot;Has Anyone Ever Beaten the Hulk?&quot; I remarked that one-on-
one physical attacks of force almost always fail. With a barrage of
sound or gas, the Hulk is usually defenseless. They could get my uncle
Felix to lecture him on how kids today don't know the value of a
dollar and how all this long haired hippie music is crap and....

-- if all else fails gets the goddam Ultimate Nullifier and call it a
day.

Civil War did make World War Hulk more desirable to at least some
percentage of readers.

Without people annoyed at Civil War, a continuing flood of crossovers,
major retcons, characterizations completely changed, heroes written
as jerks or outright villains, and various other things, fewer people
might be happy to just have Hulk smash the Marvel Universe.

Rogue is currently infected with a virus that ramps her power to the
point that she kills whoever she touches.

Though it is possible Hulk's regeneration could keep him alive.
The X-Men never got to try their last resort cure for Rogue, namely to
have her touch Wolverine in the hopes that his regeneration factor would
keep him alive long enough for her to copy it, at which point it would
cure her.

Juggernaut was depowered around the time he became one of the X-Men.
And didn't he run off with Exiles or something?  If so, he wouldn't be
around.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; -- could Hank Pym use his Pym Particles to shrink Hulk and the rest of
&gt; his DirtNapBound??
">

Well, Pym apparently couldn't shrink the deceased Black Goliath
recently for no decent reason.  Then again, no one was even smart enough
to either build an oversized funeral setting to match, or even use Pym
particles on normal materials.  The pro-reg side hasn't exactly been
brimming over in intelligence since right before the start of Civil
War, so they might not think to try.

Then again, a Wasp-sized Hulk is probably still a deadly Hulk.  He's
just harder to target.

(We'd probably just get another storyline solution though, like
claiming Hulk's regeneration counters the effect of Pym particles.
Or gamma radiation does.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; -- taking a page fro Batman v Superman, trick him into grabbing a huge
&gt; bunch of electrical wires hooked into New York's grid and then ZAP!

Would it work here?

Marvel is seemingly taking a page from Doomsday v DC Universe, so it
would probably just stagger him, then he'd get up maybe even madder.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; -- taking a page from Spidey v Juggernaut, sink him in quicksand
">

Sinks or dives to the bottom, then either jumps out or goes sideways
until he finds solid ground to dig through.  Oxygen shouldn't be an
issue, considering he stood on the outside of his ship on the way
back to Earth.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; -- taking a page from Deathstroke , drop a big ass ton o' acid on

PAD wrote Hulk regenerating from having half his body melted to the
bone.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

As you say, Maestro survived.

Maestro also beat a bunch of heros.

Maybe World War Hulk should end with Hulk growing a beard...

Exactly...Civil War was such an utter disappointment that it lowered
everyone's expectations and made the fans want a good old fashioned
ass-kicking for just about everyone in the Marvel Universe.

Not me, Civil War made me drop just about every Marvel comic they put
out, I went from reading about a dozen MU titles to... oh... two and
one of those is getting cancelled and I'm seriously considering
dropping the other.

I don't want Hulk to smash the Marvel Universe, I want Marvel to fall

vanish from the face of the planet forever.  They've pretty much
ruined them all beyond any hope of salvation.

It's not bad.
I've actually enjoyed the WWH:X-men.
And believe it or not, Iron Man was actually readable.
But, then again, I actually didn't hate Civil War, but I didn't like
the crossovers.

It's not harsh, it's what's become of the MU lately under Joey Q's
fucked up leadership.  The Ultimate Universe isn't a whole lot better,
but at least you haven't seen any CW-style mega crossovers there

&gt;&gt;Wow...that's harsh...not necessarily wrong...but harsh.  Personally, I

&gt;It's not harsh, it's what's become of the MU lately under Joey Q's
&gt;fucked up leadership.  The Ultimate Universe isn't a whole lot better,
&gt;but at least you haven't seen any CW-style mega crossovers there
&gt;yet... unfortunately, I'm sure they'll get around to it.

Actually they have done the big crossovers in the Ultimate
verse...they just don't get much hype because there are only a handful
of books...there was Ultimate Six, Ultimate War, the Ultimate Galactus
Trilogy, and, currently, Ultimate Power.

I don't disagree that Quesada needs to go but I still think someone
new could turn things around...at least some of it.

Couldn't be any worse than it is now.  Marvel Comics still has a lot
of potential but, like most media outlets, they're still clinging to a
business model that went out with the dinosaurs.

Again, the impact is mitagated by the fact that there are only a
handful of titles...it's not like the regular Marvel universe where
one of these crossovers impacts dozens of books...but each one of the
Ultimate crossovers has had a lasting impact on at least one of the
books...and pretty much everyone has been used to introduce new
characters and concepts to the Ultimate Universe...especially the
Galactus trilogy.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Is it me or World War Hulk everything that Civil War wasn't?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I mean it frankly is one of the best Marvel &quot;events&quot; in a very
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; long time.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Probably not, but notice it's mostly Hulk doing the fighting and
&gt; &gt;&gt; those guys giving him back-up...and yes, Hulk is stronger than all of
&gt; &gt;&gt; his attackers.

&gt; &gt; I've been wondering about what it would take to beat Hulk v. 4.0, (or
&gt; &gt; 5.0 or 6, or whatever...)  To wit:

&gt; &gt; -- what if Rogue (accompanied maybe by Absorbing Man?) laid hands upon
&gt; &gt; him
&gt; &gt; and then Juggernaut, Wonder Man, Hercules, and Wolverine all took
&gt; &gt; turns beating on him

&gt;   Rogue is currently infected with a virus that ramps her power to the
&gt; point that she kills whoever she touches.
">

Assuming the books continuity lines up.  However in the past strong
willed individuals have overwhelmed Rogue's mind, essentially taking
over her body.  Have her touch him and he might stop.  Or he'll be
more dangerous, because he'll have his strength, and Rogue's ability
to steal powers in her body.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;   Though it is possible Hulk's regeneration could keep him alive.
&gt; The X-Men never got to try their last resort cure for Rogue, namely to
&gt; have her touch Wolverine in the hopes that his regeneration factor would
&gt; keep him alive long enough for her to copy it, at which point it would
&gt; cure her.

&gt;   Juggernaut was depowered around the time he became one of the X-Men.
&gt; And didn't he run off with Exiles or something?  If so, he wouldn't be
&gt; around.

No, he's in New Excalibur.  His power level has dropped.

&gt; &gt; -- a nuke dropped on him (point blank)  will make him stronger?
&gt; &gt; Hmm..worked on the Maestro!

&gt;   As you say, Maestro survived.

&gt;   Maestro also beat a bunch of heros.

&gt;   Maybe World War Hulk should end with Hulk growing a beard...

&gt; &gt; -- a barrage of non-physical attacks: sound and gas. As I wrote in a
&gt; &gt; post about &quot;Has Anyone Ever Beaten the Hulk?&quot; I remarked that one-on-
&gt; &gt; one physical attacks of force almost always fail. With a barrage of
&gt; &gt; sound or gas, the Hulk is usually defenseless. They could get my uncle
&gt; &gt; Felix to lecture him on how kids today don't know the value of a
&gt; &gt; dollar and how all this long haired hippie music is crap and....

&gt;   Actually, they targeted Black Bolt first because they decided he was
&gt; one person that could beat Hulk solo.

The Hulk clap is pretty good about clearing the air around him.  And
he jumps massive distances.

Uhm, yeah...  That's the other thing about current Rogue...

Not long after getting infected, she killed a space-faring mind-
absorbing entity/weapon.  In the process, she absorbed the millions
of minds it held.  So she isn't entirely Rogue anymore, but something
with Rogue's memories.  She's been overwhelmed, but apparently not
by any individual personality, but nor is she schizophrenic.

Well, I did say &quot;assuming the books continuity line up.&quot;  She's
currently in the least important of the three X-men books.  World War
Hulk could be taking place before that.
