1. THE RIVER BANK

The MOLE had been working very hard all the morning, spring-
cleaning his little home. First with brooms, then with dusters; then on
ladders and steps and chairs, with a brush and a pail of whitewash; till
he had dust in his throat and eyes, and splashes of whitewash all over
his black fur, and an aching back and weary arms. Spring was moving in
the air above and in the earth below and around him, penetrating even
his dark and lowly little house with its spirit of divine discontent and
longing. It was small wonder, then, that he suddenly flung down his
brush on the floor, said `Bother!' and `O blow!' and also `Hang
spring-cleaning!' and bolted out of the house without even waiting to
put on his coat. Something up above was calling him imperiously, and he
made for the steep little tunnel which answered in his case to the
gravelled carriage-drive owned by animals whose residences are nearer to
the sun and air. So he scraped and scratched and scrabbled and scrooged
and then he scrooged again and scrabbled and scratched and scraped,
working busily with his little paws and muttering to himself, `Up we go!
Up we go!' till at last, pop! his snout came out into the sunlight, and
he found himself rolling in the warm grass of a great meadow.
`This is fine!' he said to himself. `This is better than
whitewashing!' The sunshine struck hot on his fur, soft breezes caressed
his heated brow, and after the seclusion of the cellarage he had lived
in so long the carol of happy birds fell on his dulled hearing almost
like a shout. Jumping off all his four legs at once, in the joy of
living and the delight of spring without its cleaning, he pursued his
way across the meadow till he reached the hedge on the further side.
`Hold up!' said an elderly rabbit at the gap. `Sixpence for the
privilege of passing by the private road!' He was bowled over in an
instant by the impatient and contemptuous MOLE, who trotted along the
side of the hedge chaffing the other rabbits as they peeped hurriedly
from their holes to see what the row was about.
`Onion-sauce! Onion-sauce!' he remarked jeeringly, and was gone before
they could think of a thoroughly satisfactory reply. Then they all
started grumbling at each other. `How STUPID you are! Why didn't you
tell him----' `Well, why didn't YOU say----' `You might have reminded
him----' and so on, in the usual way; but, of course, it was then much
too late, as is always the case.
It all seemed too good to be true. Hither and thither through the
meadows he rambled busily, along the hedgerows, across the copses,
finding everywhere birds building, flowers budding, leaves
thrusting--everything happy, and progressive, and occupied. And instead
of having an uneasy conscience pricking him and whispering `whitewash!'
he somehow could only feel how jolly it was to be the only idle dog
among all these busy citizens. After all, the best part of a holiday is
perhaps not so much to be resting yourself, as to see all the other
fellows busy working.
He thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered
aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river.
Never in his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous,
full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle
and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that
shook themselves free, and were caught and held again. All was a-SHAKE
and a-shiVER--glints and gleams and sparkles, rustle and swirl, chatter
and bubble. The MOLE was bewitched, entranced, fascinated. By the side
of the river he trotted as one trots, when very small, by the side of a
man who holds one spell-bound by exciting stories; and when tired at
last, he sat on the bank, while the river still chattered on to him, a
babbling procession of the best stories in the world, sent from the
heart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea.
As he sat on the grass and looked across the river, a dark hole in
the bank opposite, just above the water's edge, caught his eye, and
dreamily he fell to considering what a nice snug dwelling-place it would
make for an animal with few wants and fond of a bijo riverside
residence, above flood level and remote from noise and dust. As he
gazed, something bright and small seemed to TWINKLE down in the heart of
it, vanished, then TWINKLEd once more LIKE A TINY STAR. But it could
hardly be a star in such an unlikely situation; and it was too
glittering and small for a GLOW-WORM. Then, as he looked, it winked at
him, and so declared itself to be an eye; and a small face began
gradually to grow up round it, like a frame round a picture.
A brown little face, with whiskers.
A grave round face, with the same TWINKLE in its eye that had first
attracted his notice.
Small neat ears and thick silky hair.
It was the Water Rat!
Then the two animals stood and regarded each other cautiously.
`Hullo, MOLE!' said the Water Rat.
`Hullo, Rat!' said the MOLE.

12. THE RETURN OF ULYSSES

After this climax, the four animals continued to lead their lives, so
rudely broken in upon by civil war, in great joy and contentment,
undisturbed by further risings or invasions. Toad, after due
consultation with his friends, selected a handsome gold chain and locket
set with pearls, which he dispatched to the gaoler's daughter with a
letter that even the Badger admitted to be modest, grateful, and
appreciative; and the engine-driver, in his turn, was properly thanked
and compensated for all his pains and trouble. Under severe compulsion
from the Badger, even the barge-woman was, with some trouble, sought out
and the value of her horse discreetly made good to her; though Toad
kicked terribly at this, holding himself to be an instrument of Fate,
sent to punish fat women with mottled arms who couldn't tell a real
gentleman when they saw one. The amount involved, it was true, was not
very burdensome, the gipsy's valuation being admitted by local assessors
to be approximately correct.

Sometimes, in the course of long summer evenings, the friends would
take a stroll together in the Wild Wood, now successfully tamed so far
as they were concerned; and it was pleasing to see how respectfully they
were greeted by the inhabitants, and how the mother-weasels would bring
their young ones to the mouths of their holes, and say, pointing, `Look,
baby! There goes the great Mr. Toad! And that's the gallant Water Rat, a
terrible fighter, walking along o' him! And yonder comes the famous Mr.
MOLE, of whom you so often have heard your father tell!' But when their
infants were fractious and quite beyond control, they would quiet them
by telling how, if they didn't hush them and not fret them, the terrible
grey Badger would up and get them. This was a base libel on Badger, who,
though he cared little about Society, was rather fond of children; but
it never failed to have its full effect.

THE END
