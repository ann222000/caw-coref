Cowboys 28, Redskins 23: Owens Has Hands All Over Dallas's Win

IRVING, Tex., Nov. 18 -- Only a prayer remained in the playbook for the
Washington Redskins, who appeared ready to knock the Dallas Cowboys
off the razor wire they had been straddling at times this season.

Fittingly, the Cowboys' Terrell Owens was there for a curtain call,
knocking away Jason Campbell's desperation pass as time expired Sunday
in Dallas's 28-23 victory at Texas Stadium.

Owens caught eight passes from Tony Romo, four of them for touchdowns,
and the Cowboys held off a late Redskins rally to improve to 9-1,
equaling the best start in franchise history.

Owens accounted for 173 receiving yards, averaging 21.6 yards a catch
against a secondary missing the All-Pro safety Sean Taylor because of
a knee injury. All three of his catches in the second half resulted in
touchdowns, including two in the fourth quarter. And with the Redskins
needing a miracle from midfield on the final play, he was put in on
defense and again showed his instinct for the ball.

&quot;With this offense, I've told you every week we could strike at any
given point in the game,&quot; Owens said, &quot;whether it's me, Patrick
Crayton, Jason Witten, Sam Hurd or anybody making the big plays.&quot;

Romo completed 22 of 32 passes for 293 yards. His touchdown passes to
Owens covered 4, 31, 46 and 52 yards.

And the Cowboys needed every one of those clutch plays from Owens and
Romo. Dallas has thrived on its reputation for second-half surges,
outscoring opponents after halftime, 201-100. They followed that
pattern again Sunday, but they could not put away the stubborn
Redskins, who pulled to 28-23 on Campbell's 5-yard touchdown pass to
Santana Moss with 3 minutes 45 seconds to play.

Campbell threw for 348 yards, the most by a Washington quarterback
since 2003, completing 33 of 54 attempts with two touchdown passes.

&quot;I told them if we keep having these kinds of games, it's going to
give me gray hair,&quot; said Cowboys Coach Wade Phillips, whose mane
turned that color years ago.

&quot;Under pressure, our team played well. We keep making the big plays.
It just shows the character of this team. We've done it all year.
We've been behind before and have come back. We did it again today.&quot;

The Cowboys maintained their two-game lead in the National Football
Conference East over the Giants, who won at Detroit. At 9-1, the
Cowboys remained tied with the Green Bay Packers for the best record
in the N.F.C. and second only to the undefeated New England Patriots.

On Thursday, the Cowboys will play host to the Jets, and the Packers
will visit Detroit. Should Dallas and Green Bay win, their game at
Texas Stadium on Nov. 29 will be for first place in the conference.

Washington (5-5) was essentially knocked out of the division race and
faces a struggle to stay in contention for a wild-card spot.

&quot;We made too many mistakes especially early on that put ourselves in a
bit of a hole,&quot; Romo said. &quot;But we came back and played good football
when we had to in the second half.&quot;

Some luck always helps, too. The Cowboys dodged a potentially damaging
turn midway through the third quarter. Linebacker Rocky McIntosh
appeared to make a diving interception of Romo's pass to Witten, and
returned the ball to Dallas's 3.

The play was ruled a catch on the field, but officials in the replay
booth overruled the call.

On the next play, Romo threw a long pass to Crayton sprinting down the
right sideline. The pass was thrown well short, but Crayton's attempt
to make the catch resulted in contact with safety Reed Doughty, who
was called for interference.

The 51-yard penalty swung momentum immediately to the Cowboys. Two
plays later, Romo fired a 31-yard touchdown pass to Owens to put
Dallas ahead for good at 14-10.

The Redskins responded with a 39-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham to
cut the deficit to 14-13 after three quarters.

&quot;They tried to put a lot of safeties deep over the top, they tried to
shade the linebackers out there, and we did a great job of adjusting
during the second half,&quot; Owens said. &quot;Those were some things we missed
in the first half.&quot;

Owens moved into third place in the career touchdown reception list
with 126, passing the Colts' Marvin Harrison, and he moved into 11th
place in career receiving yards with 12,744, passing the former
Redskin Art Monk.
