The City of Chicago is developing a futuristic video surveillance system
designed to scan city streets looking for everything from bombs to traffic
jams.

For the past few years Chicago has been rolling out thousands of video
surveillance cameras linked by fiber-optic cables. This

system is intended to give the city's emergency response coordination agency
the ability to remotely keep track of emergencies in real time.

Now, with the help of IBM
Corp.&lt; http://projects.washingtonpost.com/post200/2007/IBM/ &gt;,
Chicago's Office of Emergency Management and Communications (OEMC) is
looking to expand the system's capabilities so that IBM's software can
analyze the thousands of hours of video being recorded by Operation Virtual
Shield.

&quot;That's really going to just throw our camera network into hyperdrive,&quot; said
Kevin Smith, a spokesman with the OEMC. &quot;Ultimately I think what this
software might be able to do is simply recognize suspicious behavior and
alert our operations people and, at times, our crime detections specialists
as to what it sees.&quot;

The software could recognize a package that had been left in a public park
or a car parked where no car is supposed to be, Smith said.

IBM has been pushing a similar technology called Smart Surveillance System
within the retail industry as a tool to fight shoplifting. The Smart
Surveillance System was spun out of IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center
earlier this year.

Now IBM is talking to a number of cities about rolling out similar projects,
according to Sam Docknevich, a Digital Video Surveillance National Practice
Leader with IBM. However none is as advanced as the Operation Virtual Shield
effort. &quot;Chicago is definitely the leading example of the value of
integrating video from multiple organizations and using it to enhance public
safety,&quot; he said.

OEMC's Smith would not say how much the city is spending on the project or
when it expects IBM's video analytics capabilities to go live.

The trick will be to make the analytics software work in a useful way. &quot;The
challenge is going to be teaching computers to recognize the suspicious
behavior,&quot; said Smith. &quot;Once this is done this will be a very impressive
city in terms of public safety.&quot;

*The City of Chicago's OEMC and IBM Launch Advanced Video Surveillance
System*

*IBM and Key Business Partners Incorporate Industry's Most Advanced
Security Capabilities Into City's &quot;Operation Virtual Shield&quot; Project*

&lt; http://www.ibm.com/ &gt;

IBM (IBM &lt; http://money.excite.com/jsp/qt/full.jsp?symbol_search_text=IBM &gt;)
today announced a new project with the City of Chicago Office of Emergency
Management and Communications (OEMC) to implement one of the most advanced
city-wide intelligent security system ever conceived. The engagement is a
part of Chicago's Operation Virtual Shield, a project that encompasses one
of the world's largest video security deployments.

In collaboration with its business partners Firetide and Genetec, IBM has
successfully deployed the infrastructure build-out for Operation Virtual
Shield with plans to expand the network throughout the city. In the first
phase, IBM helped the City experts and network engineers to design and
implement a surveillance strategy infrastructure to capture, monitor and
fully index video for real-time and forensic-related safety applications.
This entailed building a unified fiber network throughout the downtown
Chicago area, deploying a critical wireless infrastructure to offer
flexibility as required, installing hundreds of new surveillance cameras,
linking thousands of preexisting cameras to the network, and creating a
fully redundant back-end system to monitor the video, store the images and
allow for business continuity and disaster recovery applications.

The Chicago OEMC and IBM are now teaming to expand the surveillance system
and to add analytics that provide license plate recognition, trending
projections and intelligent search capabilities to the existing
infrastructure. Chicago's security solution is designed to provide several
benefits to both city officials and citizens including: real-time video
surveillance intelligence for proactive homeland security monitoring; faster
response time to emergencies; more effective deployment of emergency
responders; and increased travel efficiency through traffic congestion
tracking.

&quot;Mayor Richard M. Daley has had, for many years, a grand plan to incorporate
cameras from public entities and private sector businesses into a single
unified system allowing first responders access to real time visual data,&quot;
said Tony Ruiz, Executive Director of Chicago's Office of Emergency
Management and Communications. &quot;IBM is helping enable the City of Chicago's
vision for intelligent security.&quot;

Operation Virtual Shield was designed to allow advanced detection and
notification systems such as IBM's Smart Surveillance Solution to be
plugged-in and tuned as necessary to address new threats. The Smart
Surveillance Solution deployment with Chicago is a first-of-a-kind
implementation to help bring intelligence to city security. This concept was
sparked by the power and capabilities of the City's existing high-tech
multi-million dollar command and control center. The surveillance network is
designed to allow city officials to monitor such mundane activities as
traffic patterns on a day-to-day basis, while also being able to detect
suspicious activity and potential public safety concerns from a centrally
monitored system.

&quot;Cities today are faced with ever-increasing threats and advanced security
surveillance systems can be a critical component in ensuring safety,&quot; said
Mike Daniels, senior vice president, IBM Global Technology Services. &quot;IBM is
proud to be a part of Operation Virtual Shield and the City of Chicago's
visionary approach to homeland security.&quot;

One key factor to the success of the project is Firetide, an IBM business
partner whose wireless network infrastructure supports a wide range of fixed
and mobile wireless public safety applications including covert and overt
video surveillance, traffic control, VoIP communications, and rapid database
access. Firetide's wireless technology is instrumental in allowing the city
to deploy a large number of additional cameras in the exact locations
required, an option which would have been too costly to implement solely on
fiber. Firetide's unique technology allows real-time video to be transported
wirelessly, thereby saving taxpayers millions of dollars in wired
infrastructure costs. IBM is also testing mobile technology utilizing
Firetide's infrastructure to allow first responders access to the video
system via mobile vehicles such as police and fire.

IBM chose Genetec's Omnicast as the main video management platform for
building the Operation Virtual Shield system. Omnicast is the most advanced
IP-based video surveillance recording software in the industry. Genetec's
Omnicast incorporates virtually any type of camera be it IP-based, or analog
via encoders, on to a common platform. In addition, Omnicast allows products
such as IBM's Smart Surveillance Solution to be easily integrated into the
system. This capability along with Omnicast's ability to integrate other
Genetec fixed or mobile systems throughout the City will allow the Smart
Surveillance Solution to analyze video streams multiple cameras, anywhere no
matter if it is a sister agency camera or one from a private enterprise.

We're Watching
*CHICAGO, Sept. 6, 2006*
------------------------------
*(CBS) *If we have learned anything in the last five years, it is this: one
man's symbol of prosperity could be another man's target. And in Chicago,
the heartland's largest city, there are plenty of targets.

&quot;We have the Sears Tower, we have a thriving financial market, we have a
city that looks great,&quot; says Cortez Trotter, whom Mayor Richard Daley
appointed last April to become the city's first-ever chief emergency
officer.

*Correspondent Erin Moriarty* reports on how the city is using cameras and
other methods to keep its citizens safe.

While most Americans don't want to think about potential disasters, Trotter
thinks of little else. &quot;It's something (that) a.) you don't take lightly and
b.) you go home at night thinking, 'I've got to do better. I've got to do
more,'&quot; Trotter explains.

There are a number of new security measures that have been added to make the
city safer.

On the streets of Chicago, you probably won't see the cameras. But these
days, more and more, someone is probably watching you.

&quot;We have people watching all types of things that 10 years ago, we might
have thought there was nothing unusual about it,&quot; says Trotter.

&quot;Operation Virtual Shield&quot; may be the most extensive city surveillance
system in the country, linking about 3,000 cameras, some of which can zoom
in so close, they allow authorities to read license plate numbers.

&quot;We've got them spaced every two blocks,&quot; Trotter explains.

&quot;Now, if that truck is sitting there an hour from now, maybe what we should
do is have a police squad car go by and just check why this truck that's
been sitting for an hour is still sitting there,&quot; Trotter tells
*Moriarty*during a demonstration of the camera system.

And more than 100 private companies are also connecting their cameras to the
system. &quot;Of course Sears is on that list, Boeing is on that list, John
Hancock is on that list. What we're doing is taking their cameras and
feeding them right into our system here,&quot; Trotter explains.

Chicago has had a head start over most cities – in 1995, Mayor Daley had a
vision of putting police, fire and emergency responders into one building.
The project cost $217 million.

&quot;I said, just build me something that we know is gonna last. And, basically
technology would change. It was controversial. Someone said it was a waste
of money,&quot; Daley says. &quot;And unfortunately, when 9/11 came, 'You're a
genius.'&quot;

It is considered state of the art. But there are still large holes in this
&quot;virtual shield.&quot;

For example, there is no screening of passengers getting onto commuter
trains. Pre-screening passengers is impractical, says mass transportation
expert Joe Schofer.

Yet, while the federal government spends about $8 per passenger for aviation
security, only four cents per passenger go towards rail safety.

&quot;I think it's disproportional,&quot; says Schofer.

Chicago's Metra and other rail lines use bomb-sniffing dogs, but as an
undercover investigative report in February by CBS station WBBM pointed out,
they are not foolproof. An investigator carrying a bag with components of
gunpowder walked by one of these dogs; there was no reaction, not even when
the bag was put right in front of the dog.

The kind of terrorism that seems to worry security experts most is
bio-chemical and Chicago has already had a close call. Just six months after
9/11, a man was found in a subway tunnel with the ingredients for cyanide
gas. Joseph Konopka — who called himself &quot;Dr. Chaos&quot; — had no apparent
political agenda. He is now in federal prison.

&quot;How many areas can we be hit by terrorism? Probably more than we could ever
protect,&quot; says Trotter, who admits no city can prevent all attacks, which is
why the response is just as critical.

In Chicago, detailed floor plans of all major buildings are available to all
emergency services. Using the 22nd floor of the Sears Tower as an example,
Trotter explains, &quot;The responding units then know that there's potentially
100 people on that particular floor.&quot;

&quot;We have not only the floor plan, but the actual evacuation procedure on
each and every one of those buildings,&quot; he adds.

Former Illinois Gov. Jim Thompson, who sat on the 9/11 commission, says he
would give Chicago a B for achievement and an A for effort.

Thompson says Chicago – like all American cities — may still have problems
with communications among rescue workers.

&quot;The Congress agreed to turn over radio spectrum to first responders so that
the police and fire can talk to each other, as they were not able to do in
New York. But when do we turn it over? 2009. Why 2009? Why not now?&quot; asks
Thompson.

Trotter says he often thinks of 9/11.

&quot;I watch the video of it often because it keeps me focused,&quot; he says. &quot;As I
see the faces of the public as I walk on the street and we're responsible
for them. And I want them to go on living their lives and feeling
comfortable knowing that at night or early in the morning, I'm doing enough
worrying for everybody.&quot;

*Preparing Chicago: The Office of Emergency Communications*

**

http://www.worldbusinesschicago.com/newsletters/email.Jan06.htm

With the tragic events of Sept. 11th and the lessons learned from them,
Chicago has recognized the importance of interagency coordination and timely
intelligence sharing during emergencies. Mayor Richard M. Daley created a
department whose integration of the latest in surveillance and
telecommunications technology serves to pioneer the fields of local
emergency management, disaster preparedness and homeland security—the Office
of Emergency Management and Communications (OEMC).

The OEMC was charged with the central task of planning for, coordinating and
managing interagency responses to large-scale emergency situations
throughout the city. Since its inception, the OEMC's core mission has
expanded so that it now includes:

- Operating the City's 911 emergency communications system through the
use of advanced computer and telecommunications technology, ensuring rapid
response from first responders
- Coordinating interagency resources and personnel to prepare for,
respond to, and recover from natural or man-made disasters
- Executing the City's homeland security and disaster
prevention/mitigation initiatives
- Administering the Traffic Management Authority that is responsible
for all services related to effective traffic movement in the City

The OEMC's evolution over the past decade into a dynamic, multifaceted
organization is the result of indispensable leadership from individuals like
Cortez Trotter, Ron Huberman and the current Executive Director Andrew
Velasquez III who share Mayor Daley's holistic and collaborative approach to
emergency management and homeland security.

*Unified Command*

*Joint Operations Center*
The Joint Operations Center (JOC) serves as Chicago's central command post
for key city functions during large-scale emergencies. From this center, key
decision-makers have the ability to bring together real-time intelligence
and citywide situational awareness in any emergency situation.

*Operations Center*
The Operations Center (OC) serves as Chicago's central command post for
day-to-day city functions. Designed to mirror a military model of
operations, with thirteen concentric-arc command stations capable of
accessing city department databases and surveillance cameras strategically
located throughout the city viewable on a 25-foot video wall matrix, the OC
oversees the simultaneous exchange of real-time information streams between
various city departments during both planned special events and large-scale
emergency situations.

*Traffic Management Authority*
The Traffic Management Authority (TMA), created in 2004, is part of OEMC's
effort to maximize public safety during city emergency and non-emergency
operations. The ability to coordinate and manage multiple traffic-related
city services—Snow Command, Water Management, Streets and Sanitation—from
one central location facilitates prompt and effective mobilization of
resources, simultaneous tracking of multiple events, instant access to
information sources and timely communication of this information to the
general public. It is in light of the recent natural disasters that the
synergistic benefits of centralized traffic command become all the more
apparent.

*A Unified Surveillance Network*

*Operation Virtual Shield*
Over the past decade and a half, the City of Chicago has laid hundreds of
miles of fiber throughout the city in what is the most impressive example of
OEMC's ongoing efforts to secure Chicago's Operation Virtual Shield (OVS).
OVS is a comprehensive plan to develop, implement and maintain an extensive
citywide fiber optic network and expandable video surveillance system. This
fiber optic backbone will create a &quot;virtual shield,&quot; providing total
homeland security, public safety and traffic management coverage in Chicago,
and will facilitate the deployment of city services in response to emergency
situations.

As a result of this fiber optic infrastructure, surveillance technology will
be linked to the OEMC through a fault-tolerant, self-healing network that
will enable emergency management personnel to view real-time or recorded
video images, monitor biochemical sensors and control traffic signals
throughout the city. The Operations Center will serve as a strategic
information portal, receiving, analyzing and disseminating this critical
intelligence.
