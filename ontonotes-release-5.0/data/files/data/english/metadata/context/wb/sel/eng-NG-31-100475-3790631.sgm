Hi,

I need to buy a car which I then plan to sell in one or two years.

I want to buy a car for either about 7000, or for a lot less, say abotu
2.5-3K.

What is the better option for value? For which price range will the
following number be larger:

Price I can get when selling car - price I paid - any repairs needed
while driving it.

I realise there is no definite answer here, i'm just asking for
suggestions.

I guess what i'm asking is which car price range will depreciate more,
what's the chance that I will have to spend a lot on repairs for the
cheapr car, and how easy will they be to sell eventually.

For 7k I can get a certified car, so any repairs will hopefully be
covered by warranty. But if i spend only 2.5k on a car, what's the
chance that I would need to do major repairs that would cost several
grand - would it be likely that I need to repair it frequently?

Also when I sell the car I will want to do it quickly -- within a week,
how hard would this be to do for both price ranges?

Originally i planned to spend about 7G's, but have been looking on
Craigs list and finding lots of cars for 2-3k. Some with over a hundred
thousand miles, but others that are cheaper brands (daewoo, kia) with
closer to 50 thousand miles and selling for 2-3k.

I live in Houston and will use this car to drive to work along the
freeways.

Thanks for any suggestions.
