Romo vs. Favre: Thursday's game is going to be fun

&lt; http://newsok.com/article/3173905/1196142966 &gt;

Tue November 27, 2007
By Berry Tramel

Tony Romo kept his head a couple of games ago against the Redskins.

Cowboys led by five, late in the game, and Redskin defensive end
Phillip Daniels grabbed Romo, who considered flinging a pass then
thought better of it. Romo took the sack, the Dallas Cowboys punted
and went on to victory.

Romo talked about his wise choice, then sort of grinned and came
clean.

&quot;I'm the last guy to talk about making the right choice when you're
going down,&quot; Romo said.

Not true. That distinction goes to the guy who comes to Texas Stadium
on Thursday night for the NFC game of the year.

Brett Favre.

Dallas-Green Bay. This is going to be fun. In a league of robotic
quarterbacks, a league where Tom Brady and Peyton Manning make one
mistake a month, here comes Favre, the old gunslinger, and Romo, his
protégé, quarterbacking the way Jerry Lee Lewis played the piano. The
way Tony Stewart drives a car.

Romo is the new Favre. Quarterbacks who play the way we all did in the
backyard. Quarterbacks who don't stay between the lines.

You Dallas fans, think back three games ago, at the Meadowlands
against the Giants. Dallas touchdown No. 1 came off a Romo scramble,
when he appeared ready to cross the line of scrimmage and take a
slide, but at the last moment shot-putted a pass to Tony Curtis for a
15-yard touchdown.

Closest thing to a screwball I've seen on the gridiron. And pure
Favre, who has quarterbacked his way into NFL lore and Wisconsin
hearts with unconventional tactics. Favre has thrown 436 touchdown
passes, some of them underhanded, many of them sidearmed and more than
a few falling on his back.

Now comes Romo, Elisha to Favre's Elijah, quarterbacking the same way,
throwing more than his share of dubious passes, but taking over a
storied franchise.

Remember the Buffalo game in October. Romo threw four first-half
interceptions and five overall but rallied the Cowboys to a most
improbable victory. Pure Favre.

These guys play with a joy not seen in the button-down world of
quarterbacks. How many times have we seen Favre, after a crucial
touchdown pass, sprint all over the field with his arms raised,
sometimes running backwards?

Now we see Romo furiously stepping onto the field, directing his
defense as it sets up for a Hail Mary pass in the final seconds
against the 'Skins.

Then after the game comes a boyish charm that makes you think for a
second that these guys really haven't figured out they're still not on
the sandlots of Burlington, Wisc., or Kiln, Miss.

Favre has taken the Packers on a wild adventure. Sixteen years he's
quarterbacked Green Bay, to a Super Bowl title and two NFC
championships and a thousand thrills. Over 60,000 yards and 719
combined interceptions or sacks, which ought to be a record if it's
not.

Now here's Romo in year No. 2 of what already has been a rollercoaster
ride. The hot October of 2006, the playoff push last December, the
muffed hold in Seattle, the 10-1 start in 2007.

And before Romo assumes the mantle of America's favorite quarterback,
he takes the field against the old war horse from whom he well
learned.

This is Dallas-Green Bay, two 10-1 teams, but homefield advantage and
the Super Bowl's inside track take a back seat Thursday night to the
quarterbacks.

Favre-Romo. This is going to be fun.

I guess this guy didn't realize that Favre (afaik) never threw 5 ints and
won. In act, I don't believe Favre has ever thrown 4 and won.

Favre's ints have that habit of turning into 6 points within seconds.
