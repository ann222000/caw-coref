Hi all,

Our school is currently using Trac with Active Directory, and we've
recently come across an issue where two of our users are unable to log
onto Trac with their network accounts, but they are not locked out of
the network.  Has anyone seen or heard of an issue like this?  Please
let me know if you need anymore information, too.

Thanks in advance,

More info would be good.

1. Any error messages regarding the two users?
2. How are you doing the authentication? Apache + mod_auth_ldap?
AccountManager + LDAP?

As far as a reason off the top of my head, I've got no clue.  You could
try catching a few of us in #trac on irc.freenode.net also.  I should be
around at mostly the same times as you, as I am also in the Portland area.

The two users get the following error message:

&quot;Authorization Required
This server could not verify that you are authorized to access the
document requested.  Either you supplied the wrong credentials (e.g, bad
password), or your browser doesn't understand how to supply the
credentials required.&quot;

As for the authentication method, I'm not quite sure.  I was handed the
task of Trac admin when I started working here several months ago.  The
person who did it before me was the one who set everything up, but he
didn't leave much documentation behind when he left.

I've been digging through the files on our trac server, and I found a
reference to the TracAccountManager plugin in the /trac/cache directory
and the ldapplugin in the /trac/plugins directory.

Is there any way to tell which authentication method is used, or any
other insight where to look for this issue?

Thanks again in advance.

Documentation is SOOOO overrated ;)

Please provide the [components] and [account-manager] sections of your
trac.ini file.

Also, look at your apache config and see if you see a section for
/login.  If it exists, please post what you can of it (you might need to
sanitize it a little).

Also, not that I want to cause a medium-violation, but it may be easier,
and quicker, to trouble shoot this via IRC.  #trac on irc.freenode.net

Thanks for the help.  We managed to get the issue fixed.  It turns out,
the error was something completely unrelated to Trac, and instead with
the directory.
