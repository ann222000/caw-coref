It's a digrance that this anti male fat negro would have a murderer on her
show. Is that Stedman guy a homosexual? I can't imagine any man shagging
OOprah for any amount of money.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I will not be surprised if O.J. Simpson's book publisher
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; takes an interest.  Which &quot;media network&quot; that is, I leave
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you to discover -- as a sort of exercise for the student,

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snicker&gt; Well, Oprah is a heckuva hint... &lt;g&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahh, you've been a bit MSdirected.  The publisher is part
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Rupert Murdoch's holdings.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, as we all know, when theres $$$ to be made, the purveyors
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of pop media will happily sell out their own sex...

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; LOL!   Of course they will.  They'll sell out their own sex,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the other sex, church, government, and anything else that
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; will make a buck!   Unfortunately,  that's part of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fiduciary duty of the corporation to its stockholders---
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it has to try to maximize profits no matter gets trashed.

&gt;&gt; &gt; If this was true, then corporate mishaps like Enron and huge &quot;golden
&gt;&gt; &gt; parachutes&quot; for failed CEO's (Carly Fiora, hired on gender, not
&gt;&gt; &gt; ability)
&gt;&gt; &gt; wouldn't happen...

&gt;&gt; I think the golden parachutes for failed CEOs can sometimes be
&gt;&gt; a long-term  profit enhancer.   It certainly seems to have worked
&gt;&gt; for the HP board despite their little phone pretexting scandal.

&gt; You seem to have confused causality with correlation.

&gt; HP succeeding DESPITE the mishaps of Fiora is not evidence that they

HP was sucessful long before this female set them back.

Corporations cut jobs to eliminate the areas of the company that are not
profitable and a drain. This makes the company stronger and the stock price
usually increases. A company is not going to close certain plants or lay off
workers if they're making money there.

I'm not to fond of Oprah either.  She's to into herself.  She proves

I wouldn't say that.  The thing about Oprah is she is so paranoid
about her weight and having a baby makes a woman gain weight during
the pregnancy.  She can't stand to think that she might not look like
the god she isn't for a few months plus she'd have to shed the pounds
afterwards.  Like I said she is to into herself.

Absolutely.  MarkB provided absolutely no justification for Fiora's
golden parachute producing anything of value for the company.

Often yes, sometimes no.

Corporations are run by humans and humans can do stupid things.  Just as
people may sell off something of value when they have rusting lawn
furniture in the backyard, corporate heads can do the same.

I remember one executive saying the opposite of great is mediocre.  Many
companies often are marginally profitable because bad management
practices are tolerated despite a profitable business plan.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This makes the company stronger and the stock price
&gt; usually increases.

The PERCEPTION of such causes the price to usually increase.

It's not uncommon therefore for companies to engage in layoffs for no
reason whatsoever other than to help spike up their price even at the
expense of long term profits...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A company is not going to close certain plants or lay off
&gt; workers if they're making money there.
">

A &quot;company&quot; might think twice about doing such a thing, but CEO's and
executives who want to put on a show of &quot;restructuring&quot; might consider
it.  If they have a golden parachute, they aren't going to care about
long term profits.

Consider this scenario: An executive gets paid to restructure a company
and a huge guaranteed golden parachute.  He doesn't know the business
plan (or care) so he just closes off a profitable plant anyway and waits
a year and takes the money and runs.

It's shocking this still happens and a bit of a mystery why stockholders
put up with such shenanegans.  Too many, sadly, don't look at the fine
print and draw the same conclusions you do (and THOSE are the casual
&quot;daytraders&quot; who look at simplistic reports that take the hit.)

Philosophically, if it helped establish someone in a certain class then
it wasn't worthless crap.  The questions such as what theme song was in

But in terms of producing value for society in their chosen field, it
was often crap.  Hey, I love Shakespeare, but for an achitect or
engineer or medical doctor, it's worthless crap.
