I am looking for an expert in the feild of hockey collectibles. I have
a 1957 NHL Hockey Crest featuring the &quot;Original Six&quot; teams logos, this
is felt on satin like material with rough cloth backing. Crest is mint
as has never been out of the Album. I am looking for someone who either
knows what this is worth or can point me towards the experts. If your
information results in a sale I will pay a finders fee of 5%. Email me
at k ... @iname.com if you can help.

Thank You
Rodney
