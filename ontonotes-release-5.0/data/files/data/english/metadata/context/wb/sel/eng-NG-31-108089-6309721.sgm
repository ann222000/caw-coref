Sunday morning coffee with a shot of Bailey's for all -

There's a lot of stuff on the internet telling you how to do an
883/1200 conversion, but I've chosen the easy way:

Just ordered an '07 XL 1200L, vivid black, mag wheels - taking
delivery in May.

As they say in Upper East Tennessee, YeeHaa...:-)

Diane, but I'll always be "harleywoman883"....

Cool!  Without a doubt that's the least labor-intensive way to do it.
And to move up to a rubber mounted drive train at the same time.

Hell, I don't know, maybe somebody wants to buy pics of his 2000 883c.
Email him and ask what he wants for those pics, we'll get Key to resize

If Key can resize that direction.

Piece of cake, really.  The tank is a one-piece with *no*
crossover, making removal a five-minute job with no gas spillage.

Top end is basically the same as any Evo.  Primary is midly
different.  Unless you have to do some cam work (which you won't with
the nice cams in the 1200) or tranny work (which you do *not* want to
do on an '04 and up, since it requires splitting the cases), there's
not much you haven't already done on Big Twins.

Belt and/or pulley changes are a breeze.  Oh, wait...I forgot
who I was talking to:  The pulley is on the *right* side &lt;sfsf&gt;.  And
the intake manifold bolts still suck if they get seized!

Besides, don't those new-fangled machines come with a two-year
warranty?

No shit?  No more trap door?  That will make tranny work a pain in the
ass. That was one of the things I liked most about wrenching on
Sportsters. You could yank the sprocket and the primary and have the
tranny out and on the bench in a jiffy.  Half a jiffy if you were fast.

Of course, on the other hand, big-power Sporties would occasionally flex
the trapdoor and blow the lower rear quarter out of the case.  Which was
another way of getting at the transmission, I suppose.

Heh...And that was the point.  More solid, easier for them to
assemble, based on the Buell and, mainly, when's the last time you had
to do work on an XL 5-speed tranny...At least that was the reasoning
when it was explained to me.

Then, one of the first '05 Buell we got got bought by a
parts guy who worked at the dealership.  For some reason, it never
shifted right.  After trying everything, making sure the shifter was
in properly (something they *definitely* improved.  No more stupid
wave washer or alignement procedure for that.  Just push two
spring-loaded tabs in, and pop the shifter right on.  Nice), etc, It
was decided the cases had to come apart.

I took everything apart and found that the Factory forgot to
put the bolt in that held the shift detent in the case (or it was in
very loosely.  The bolt was floating inside the cases, and the drum
was the only thing holding the detent in).

How much time did H-D allow for this operation in their
Warranty book?  I believe it was 6-8 hours or so!

Phil...the "Don't get me started on that..." Asshole(tm)...
